The Report forms Part XL. of the\r\nZoological Series of Reports on the Scientific Results of the Expedition,\r\nand is the largest single Report of the series which has up to this time\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nThe Manuscript of the Systematic Part was written by Professor Haeckel in\r\nthe English language, and was received by me in instalments on the 12th\r\nAugust 1884, 13th July and 4th December 1885, and 3rd June 1886. The\r\nIntroduction was written in German and was translated into the English\r\nlanguage by Mr. W. E. Hoyle of the Challenger Editorial Staff; the German\r\ntext being received in instalments between the 15th July 1886, and the 25th\r\nJanuary 1887.\r\n\r\nThe Challenger Naturalists found the representatives of this group of\r\nanimals to be universally distributed throughout ocean waters, and their\r\ndead remains to be nearly equally widely distributed over the floor of the\r\nocean, the relative abundance and the species differing, however, with\r\nchange of locality, and their abundance or variety being intimately\r\nconnected with some of the most interesting and intricate problems of\r\ngeneral oceanography.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance that so distinguished a Naturalist, with\r\nsuch an intimate knowledge of the RADIOLARIA, should have been willing to\r\nundertake the laborious examination and description of the extensive\r\ncollections made during the Expedition. Professor Haeckel has devoted ten\r\nyears of his life to this work, and this Report sets forth the results of\r\nhis labours, on the conclusion of which he will be congratulated by all\r\nNaturalists. The entire literature of the RADIOLARIA (from 1834 to 1884) is\r\ncompletely recorded, and the older species (both living and fossil)\r\nredescribed, so that the Report is a complete Monograph, which will be an\r\ninvaluable aid to all future Investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHALLENGER OFFICE, 32 QUEEN STREET,\r\n    EDINBURGH, _1st February 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nVOYAGE OF H.M.S. CHALLENGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#ZOOLOGY.#\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Report on the RADIOLARIA collected by H.M.S. Challenger during the Years\r\n  1873-76. By ERNST HAECKEL, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Zoology in the\r\n  University of Jena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe significance of the Radiolaria in regard to the relations of life in\r\nthe ocean has been increased in a most unexpected manner by the discoveries\r\nof the Challenger. Large swarms of these delicate Rhizopoda were found not\r\nonly at the surface of the open ocean but also in its different\r\nbathymetrical zones. Thousands of new species make up the wonderful\r\nRadiolarian ooze, which covers large areas of the deep-sea bed, and was\r\nbrought up from abysses of from 2000 to 4000 fathoms by the sounding\r\nmachine of the Challenger. They open a new world to morphological\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nWhen ten years ago (in the autumn of 1876) I accepted the enticing\r\ninvitation of Sir Wyville Thomson to undertake the investigation of these\r\nmicroscopic creatures, I hoped to be able to accomplish the task with some\r\ndegree of completeness within a period of from three to five years, but the\r\nfurther my investigations proceeded the more immeasurable seemed the range\r\nof forms, like the boundless firmament of stars. I soon found myself\r\ncompelled to decide between making a detailed study of a selection of\r\nspecial forms or giving as complete a survey as possible of the varied\r\nforms of the whole class; and I decided upon the latter course, having\r\nregard both to the general plan of the Challenger Reports, and to the\r\ninterests of our acquaintance with the class as a whole. I must, however,\r\nconfess at the close of my work that my original intention is far from\r\nhaving been fulfilled. The extraordinary extent and varied difficulties of\r\nthe undertaking must excuse the many deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe special examination of the Challenger collection was for the most part\r\ncompleted in the summer of 1881; I collected its results in my Entwurf\r\neines Radiolarien-Systems auf Grund von Studien der Challenger-Radiolarien\r\n(Jenaische Zeitschr. f. Naturw., Bd. xv., 1881). Since the manuscript of\r\nthis preliminary communication was completed only a few days before my\r\ndeparture for Ceylon, and since I was unable to correct the proofs myself,\r\nseveral errors have crept into the Prodromus Systematis Radiolarium\r\nincluded in it. These have been corrected in the following more extensive\r\nworking out of it. Even at that time I had distinguished 630 genera and\r\nmore than 2000 species; but on the revision of these, which I undertook\r\nimmediately on my return from India, this number was considerably\r\nincreased. The total number of forms here described amounts to 739 genera\r\nand 4318 species; of these 3508 are new, as against 810 previously\r\ndescribed. In spite of this large number, however, and in spite of the\r\nastonishing variety of the new and marvellous forms, the riches of the\r\nChallenger collection are by no means exhausted. A careful and patient\r\nworker who would devote a second decade to the work, would probably\r\nincrease the number of new forms (especially of the smaller ones) by more\r\nthan a thousand; but for a really complete examination, the lifetime of one\r\nman would not suffice.\r\n\r\nThe richest source of the Challenger material is the Radiolarian ooze of\r\nthe central Pacific Ocean (Stations 265 to 274). This remarkable deep-sea\r\nmud consists for the greater part of well-preserved siliceous shells of\r\nPolycystina (SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA). Not less important, however,\r\nespecially for the study of the ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA, are the wonderful\r\npreparations stained with carmine and mounted in Canada balsam on the spot\r\nby Dr. John Murray. One such preparation (_e.g._, from Station 271) often\r\ncontains twenty or thirty, sometimes even fifty new species. In many of\r\nthese preparations the individual parts of the unicellular organism are so\r\nwell preserved that they show clearly the characteristic peculiarities of\r\nthe legions and orders. Since the material for these preparations was taken\r\nwith the tow-net, not only from the surface of the sea but also from\r\ndifferent bathymetrical zones, it furnishes valuable conclusions regarding\r\nthe chorology, as well as the physiology and morphology of the group. For\r\nmany new discoveries I am indebted to the study of such preparations, of\r\nwhich I have examined about a thousand from 168 different Stations (compare\r\n§ 240). In addition to these about 100 bottles were handed to me,\r\ncontaining partly bottom-deposits, partly tow-net gatherings.\r\n\r\nSir Wyville Thomson, who directed the investigations of the Challenger with\r\nso much devotion, and only partly saw its results, has laid me under a deep\r\ndebt of obligation; not less is this the case, however, with his successor,\r\nDr. John Murray. I am especially indebted to both gentlemen for the freedom\r\nthey have allowed me in the carrying out of my work, and especially for the\r\npermission to include a description of all known Radiolaria in the\r\nChallenger Report, which has thus become a second edition many times\r\nenlarged of my Monograph published in 1862. Since all previous literature\r\nof the subject has been consulted and critically revised, it is hoped that\r\nthis Report will form a useful foundation for future investigations. All\r\nnames of sufficiently described Radiolaria published during the first half\r\ncentury of our knowledge of the class (from 1834 to 1884), are inserted in\r\nalphabetical order in the index at the end of this work.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the treasures of the Challenger, my own collection of\r\nRadiolaria has yielded many new forms whose description is here included.\r\nOn my journeys to the Mediterranean (an account of which is given in the\r\nintroduction to my Monograph of the Medusæ), I have given special attention\r\nto these delicate microscopic organisms for more than thirty years. Besides\r\nthe various points on the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean at the Canaries\r\n(in the winter of 1866-67) yielded many interesting new forms; whilst my\r\nvoyage across the Indian Ocean, from Aden to Bombay, in November 1881,\r\nthence to Ceylon and back by Socotra in March 1882, was still more\r\nproductive. In particular, some extended excursions which I had the\r\nopportunity of making from Belligemma and Matura (at the southern extremity\r\nof Ceylon) gave me an insight into the rich treasures of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nMost important, however, as regards the knowledge of the Indian Radiolaria,\r\nare the collections which Captain Heinrich Rabbe of Bremen has so\r\nbeautifully preserved during his many voyages through that region. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Madagascar and the Cocos Islands more especially, and also\r\nin the Sunda Archipelago, he met with large swarms of Radiolaria, among\r\nwhich were many new and remarkable forms. These were of special value for\r\ncompleting the chorology, and the more so since the course of the\r\nChallenger in the Indian Ocean lay very far to the southwards. I will\r\ntherefore take this opportunity of repeating my best thanks to Captain\r\nRabbe for the friendly donation of his valuable collection.\r\n\r\nThe Radiolarian fauna of the North Atlantic Ocean, which was previously but\r\nlittle known and only slightly increased by the investigations of the\r\nChallenger, received a valuable increase from the interesting collections\r\nmade by Dr. John Murray on various expeditions to the Færöe Islands (on the\r\n\"Knight Errant\" in 1880 and on the \"Triton\" in 1882). A large number of new\r\nRadiolaria were captured in the Færöe Channel, partly at the surface of the\r\nGulf Stream, partly at various depths, and the proof was thus furnished\r\nthat at certain points in the North Atlantic Ocean Radiolaria are very\r\nrichly developed. I am further indebted to Dr. John Murray for the free use\r\nof this important material as well as for much other assistance in the\r\ncarrying out of my work. Another rich source of Radiolaria I found in the\r\nalimentary canal of pelagic animals from all seas. Medusæ, Siphonophoræ,\r\nSalpæ, Pteropoda, Heteropoda, Crustacea, &c., which live partly at the\r\nsurface of the sea and partly at various depths, and swallow large masses\r\nof Radiolaria, often contain numbers of their shells well-preserved in\r\ntheir intestine. The alimentary canal of Fishes and Cephalopods too, which\r\nlive upon these pelagic animal frequently contains considerable quantities\r\nof siliceous shells; and another newly discovered source has been found in\r\nthe coprolites of the Jurassic period, which consist largely of Radiolarian\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of this complicated system of organisms, I have\r\nendeavoured on the one hand to give accurately the forms and dimensions of\r\nthe species observed, and on the other hand to present a survey of the\r\nrelationships of the different genera and families; and in this I have\r\nstriven especially to combine the phylogenetic aims of the natural system\r\nwith the essentially artificial divisions of a practical classification.\r\nBeing, however, a conscientious supporter of the theory of descent, I can\r\nof course lay no stress upon the value of the categories, which are here\r\ndistinguished as Legions, Orders, Families, Genera, &c. All these\r\nartificial systematic grades I regard as of merely relative value; and from\r\nthe same cause I attach no importance to the distinction of all the species\r\nhere described; many of them are probably only developmental stages, and\r\nlike my predecessors I have determined their boundaries on subjective\r\ngrounds. In the systematic working out of so much material one always runs\r\nthe risk of doing either too much or too little in the way of creating\r\nspecies; but in the light of the theory of descent this danger is of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nIn the carrying out of this extensive task the friendly aid of Dr. Reinhold\r\nTeuscher of Jena was of the greatest benefit to me; at my request he was at\r\nthe trouble of making a large number of accurate drawings with the camera\r\nlucida, and he also undertook a long series, amounting to some 8000,\r\naccurate micrometric measurements, which were of the greatest value in the\r\nattempt to settle the important question of the constancy of the various\r\nspecies; I have alluded to this in a note at the conclusion of the Report\r\n(p. 1760). My best thanks are due to Dr. Teuscher for the patient and\r\ncareful manner in which he discharged these tedious tasks.\r\n\r\nThe figures of new species of Radiolaria (about 1600 in number) which\r\nappear in the atlas of one hundred and forty plates accompanying this\r\nReport, were nearly all drawn with the camera lucida, partly by Mr. Adolph\r\nGiltsch and partly by myself. The names of the genera which appear at the\r\nbottom of the plates have in many cases been changed since they were\r\nprinted off, as may be seen from the explanations which accompany them. Had\r\nit been possible to complete the examination of the material before the\r\nplates were commenced this might have been avoided, and in many cases a\r\nbetter selection of figures might have been made. All the drawings have\r\nbeen made upon the stone by the practised hand of Mr. Adolph Giltsch, in\r\nhis usual masterly manner, and his lithographic work, which has lasted\r\nfully ten years, is the more valuable since he has himself microscopically\r\nstudied the greater part of the species figured. The fact that the atlas\r\npresents so full a picture of the marvellous wealth of form of the\r\nRadiolaria is especially due to his lively interest in the work, to his\r\nunwearying care, and to his morphological acuteness. May it be the means of\r\ninducing many naturalists to study more deeply this inexhaustible kingdom\r\nof microscopic life, whose endless variety of wonderful forms justifies the\r\nsaying--_Natura in minimis maxima_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIRST PART.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL INTRODUCTION--                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n    I.

The central capsule is\r\npartly the general central organ of the Radiolarian cell, partly the\r\nspecial organ of reproduction, since its intracapsular protoplasm, along\r\nwith the nuclei embedded in it, serves for the formation of flagellate\r\nspores. The extracapsulum is partly the general organ for intercourse with\r\nthe outer world (by means of the pseudopodia), partly the special organ of\r\nprotection (calymma) and nutrition (sarcomatrix). The majority of\r\nRadiolaria develop also a skeleton for support and protection, which\r\npresents the utmost variety of form, and is generally composed of silica,\r\nsometimes of an organic substance (acanthin). The Radiolarian cell usually\r\nleads an isolated existence (Monozoa _vel_ Monocyttaria); only in a small\r\nminority (of one legion) are the unicellular organisms united in colonies\r\nor coenobia (Polyzoa _vel_ Polycyttaria).\r\n\r\n  The extent of the Radiolaria, as limited by the above definition, which I\r\n  have made as compact as possible, differs in several important respects\r\n  from that allowed to the group by all previous diagnoses. The shortest\r\n  expression of its scope might perhaps be:--Rhizopoda with central capsule\r\n  and calymma; for the most important character of the Radiolaria, and that\r\n  by which they are distinguished from all other Rhizopoda, is the\r\n  differentiation of the unicellular body into two principal parts of equal\r\n  importance and their separation by a constant capsule-membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Two Subclasses of the Radiolaria._--The systematic catalogue of the\r\nRadiolaria, which forms the second part of this Report, and is brought up\r\nto the year {ii}1884, contains 20 orders, 85 families, 739 genera, and 4318\r\nspecies. The consideration that but a small proportion of the ocean his yet\r\nbeen investigated renders it likely, however, that even this large number\r\ndoes not include the half of the recent species. The great progress which\r\nour knowledge of the organisation of the Radiolaria has made, by means of\r\ncomparative study, renders it possible to arrange this enormous mass of\r\nforms in four main divisions or legions, and these are again related in\r\npairs, so that two divisions of the highest rank or subclasses are\r\nconstituted, the _Porulosa_ (or _Holotrypasta_) and _Osculosa_ (or\r\n_Merotrypasta_).\r\n\r\n  The division of the Radiolaria into two subclasses and four legions (or\r\n  principal orders), I sought to establish in 1883 in a communication on\r\n  the Orders of the Radiolaria (Sitzb. Jena Gesellsch. Med. u. Naturwiss.,\r\n  February 16, 1883). As a believer in the theory of descent, I regard all\r\n  the systematic arrangements of specialists as artificial, and all their\r\n  divisions as subjective abstractions, and hence I shall be guided in the\r\n  establishment of such groups as subclasses, legions, orders, &c., by\r\n  purely practical considerations, especially by the desire to give as\r\n  ready a survey as possible of the complex multitude of forms (compare §§\r\n  154 to 156).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Porulosa or Holotrypasta._--The subclass Porulosa or Holotrypasta\r\nincludes the two legions, PERIPYLEA or SPUMELLARIA, and ACTIPYLEA or\r\nACANTHARIA, which agree in the following constant and important\r\ncharacters:--(1) The _Central Capsule_ is primitively a sphere, and retains\r\nthis homaxon form in the majority of the species. (2) The _Membrane_ of the\r\ncentral capsule is everywhere perforated by very numerous minute pores, but\r\npossesses no larger principal aperture (osculum). (3) The _Pseudopodia_\r\nradiate in all directions and in great numbers from the central capsule,\r\npassing through its pores. (4) The _Equilibrium_ of the floating\r\nunicellular body is in most Porulosa pantostatic (indifferent) or\r\npolystatic (plural-stable), since a vertical axis is either absent, or, if\r\npresent, has its two poles similarly constituted. (5) The _Ground-forms_ of\r\nthe skeleton are therefore almost always either spherotypic or\r\nisopolar-monaxon, very rarely zygotypic. The two legions of the Porulosa\r\nare distinguished mainly by the skeleton of the SPUMELLARIA (or PERIPYLEA)\r\nbeing siliceous, never centrogenous, nor composed of acanthin, whilst in\r\nthe ACANTHARIA (or ACTIPYLEA) it is always centrogenous and made up of\r\nacanthin; hence in the former the nucleus is always central, in the latter\r\nalways excentric.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Osculosa or Merotrypasta._--The subclass Osculosa or Merotrypasta\r\nincludes the two legions MONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA, and CANNOPYLEA or\r\nPHÆODARIA, which agree in the following constant and important\r\ncharacters:--(1) The Central Capsule is originally monaxon (ovoid or\r\nspheroidal) and retains this ground-form in most of the species. (2) The\r\n_Membrane_ of the central capsule possesses a single large principal\r\naperture (osculum) at the basal pole of the vertical main axis. (3) The\r\n_Pseudopodia_ radiate from a stream of sarcode which passes out from the\r\ncentral capsule only on one side, namely, through the principal aperture.\r\n(4) The _Equilibrium_ of the floating body is {iii}monostatic or unistable,\r\nsince the two poles of the principal axis are always more or less different\r\nfrom each other. (5) The _Ground-forms_ of the skeleton are, therefore, for\r\nthe most part grammotypic (centraxon) or zygotypic (centroplan), rarely\r\nspherotypic. The two legions of the Osculosa are distinguished chiefly by\r\nthe principal opening (osculum) being closed by a porous plate (porochora\r\nwith its podoconus) in the NASSELLARIA (or MONOPYLEA), and by a radiate\r\ncover (operculum with its astropyle) in the PHÆODARIA (or CANNOPYLEA).\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _The four Legions of Radiolaria._--The four principal groups of\r\nRadiolaria, to which we have given the name \"legions,\" are natural units,\r\nsince the most important peculiarities in the structure of the central\r\ncapsule are quite constant within the limits of the same legion, and since\r\nall the forms in the same legion may be traced without violence to the same\r\nphylogenetic stem. The four legions are, however, related to each other, in\r\nso far as they all exhibit those characters which distinguish the\r\nRadiolaria from other Protista. The two which compose the Porulosa (§ 3)\r\nseem somewhat more nearly related to each other than to the two which make\r\nup the Osculosa (§ 4). When, however, the attempt is made to bring them all\r\ninto a phylogenetic relationship, it undoubtedly appears that the\r\nSPUMELLARIA (or PERIPYLEA) are the primitive stem, out of which the other\r\nthree have been developed as independent branches. All three have been\r\nderived, probably independently, from the most ancient stem-form of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, the spherical _Actissa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Peripylea or Spumellaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call \"PERIPYLEA\"\r\non account of the constitution of their central capsule, or \"SPUMELLARIA\"\r\non account of the nature of their skeleton, are separated from the other\r\nthree legions of the class by the combination of the following constant\r\ncharacters:--(1) The _Membrane_ of the central capsule is single and evenly\r\nperforated all over by innumerable fine pore-canals, but without any larger\r\nprincipal opening (osculum). (2) The _Nucleus_ always lies centrally in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA monozoa and is serotinous, for it divides only at a later\r\nperiod into the nuclei of the spores; in the SPUMELLARIA polyzoa it is\r\nprecocious, and divides early into many small nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_\r\nare exceedingly numerous and distributed evenly over the whole surface of\r\nthe central capsule. (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The\r\n_Skeleton_ is seldom wanting, is never centrogenous, and is always\r\nsiliceous. (6) The _Ground-form_ of the central capsule is originally\r\nspherical (often modified); that of the skeleton is also spherical or, in\r\nthe majority of cases, derived in different ways from the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Actipylea or Acantharia._--These Radiolaria which we call \"ACTIPYLEA\"\r\non account of the constitution of their central capsule, or \"ACANTHARIA\"\r\nfrom the formation of their skeleton, are separated from the other three\r\nlegions by the combination of the following constant characters:--(1) The\r\n_Membrane_ of the central capsule is single and {iv}perforated by numerous\r\nfine pore-canals, which are regularly distributed in series or groups, but\r\nwithout a larger principal opening (osculum). (2) The _Nucleus_ is always\r\nexcentric and generally precocious, since it divides early by a peculiar\r\nprocess of budding into numerous small nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are\r\nvery numerous and distributed regularly in groups (or series united into a\r\nnetwork). (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The _Skeleton_ is\r\ngenerally present, always centrogenous, and composed of acanthin. (6) The\r\n_Ground-form_ of the central capsule is originally spherical (often\r\nmodified), that of the skeleton polyaxon (often modified).\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Monopylea or Nassellaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call \"MONOPYLEA\"\r\nfrom the formation of their central capsule, or \"NASSELLARIA\" from the\r\nnature of their skeleton, are distinguished from the other three legions of\r\nthe class by the combination of the following constant characters:--(1) The\r\n_Membrane_ of the central capsule is single, and has only one large\r\nprincipal opening (osculum) at the basal pole of the vertical main axis;\r\nthis osculum is closed by a perforated lid (porochora or operculum porosum)\r\nfrom which there arises within the central capsule a peculiar cone of\r\nthreads or pseudopodia (podoconus). (2) The _Nucleus_ is usually excentric\r\nand is always serotinous, since it only divides at a comparatively late\r\nperiod into spore-nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are not very numerous and\r\narise by division of a single stem or bundle of threads of sarcode, which\r\nissues from the porochora. (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The\r\n_Skeleton_ (very rarely absent) is never centrogenous, but always\r\nextracapsular and siliceous. (6) The _Ground-form_ of the central capsule\r\nis always monaxon (with a vertical allopolar main axis), originally ovoid,\r\noften modified; that of the skeleton is also generally monaxon, often\r\nmodified (triradial or bilateral).\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Cannopylea or Phæodaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call \"CANNOPYLEA\"\r\nfrom the constitution of their central capsule, or \"PHÆODARIA\" on account\r\nof their peculiar phæodium, are distinguished from the other three legions\r\nby the combination of the following characters:--(1) The _Membrane_ of the\r\ncentral capsule is double, consisting of a strong outer and delicate inner\r\ncapsule, and has only one principal opening (osculum) at the basal pole of\r\nthe vertical main axis; this osculum is closed by a radiate cover\r\n(astropyle or operculum radiatum), from the centre of which arises an\r\nexternal tubular spout (proboscis). Occasionally a few small accessory\r\nopenings (parapylæ) are present besides the principal opening. (2) The\r\n_Nucleus_ lies centrally or subcentrally in the capsule (in the vertical\r\nmain axis), and is serotinous, inasmuch as it only divides at a late period\r\ninto spore-nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are usually very numerous and\r\narise from a thick sarcomatrix, formed by the spreading out of a thick stem\r\nof sarcode, which issues from the astropyle. (4) The _Calymma_ always\r\ncontains a phæodium or peculiar voluminous excentric mass of pigment. (5)\r\nThe _Skeleton_ (very rarely absent) is never centrogenous, always\r\nextracapsular and formed of a silicate of carbon. (6) The {v}_Ground-form_\r\nof the central capsule is always monaxon (with a vertical allopolar main\r\naxis) and generally spheroidal; that of the skeleton is very varied.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Synopsis of

_Individuality of the Radiolaria._--Like other Protozoa the Radiolaria\r\nare unicellular organisms, the whole fully developed organisation of which\r\nfalls under the category of a single cell, both morphologically and\r\nphysiologically. Since this view is based upon the composition of the\r\nindividual body out of two different morphological elements, nucleus and\r\nprotoplasm, it is at once justified in the case of the majority of\r\nRadiolaria, in which the plasmatic body encloses only a single nucleus (the\r\nso-called \"Binnen-Bläschen\"); such is the case in all the SPUMELLARIA\r\nmonozoa, NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA. This aspect of the case might appear\r\ndoubtful in those Radiolaria in which the simple primary cell-nucleus\r\ndivides early into numerous small secondary nuclei, as is the case in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA polyzoa and most ACANTHARIA. Strictly speaking, the\r\nmultinucleate central capsule should in such cases be regarded as a\r\nsyncytium; but since the individual unity of the unicellular organism is as\r\nclearly defined in these precocious multinuclear Radiolaria as in the\r\nordinary serotinous forms, the former must be considered unicellular\r\nRhizopods just as are the latter. This mode of regarding {vi}the case is\r\nthe more necessary, inasmuch as the early division of the nucleus has no\r\nfurther influence upon the organisation. Just as in many other classes of\r\nthe Protista there are monozootic (solitary) and polyzootic (social) forms,\r\nso also in the Radiolaria there are in addition to the ordinary monozootic\r\nor monobious forms certain families in which colonies or coenobia are\r\nformed by the association of individuals; this distinction may be expressed\r\nby the terms \"Monocyttaria\" and \"Polycyttaria.\"\r\n\r\n  The unicellular nature of the Radiolaria was first established by Richard\r\n  Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33),[1] and brought into conformity with our\r\n  present histiological knowledge and the new reform of the cell-theory.\r\n  Huxley, however, who was in 1851 the first to examine living Radiolaria\r\n  accurately, declared _Thalassicolla nucleata_ to be a unicellular\r\n  Protozoon, and the individual central capsules of _Sphærozoum punctatum_\r\n  to be cells, but, owing to the then condition of the cell-theory, he was\r\n  unable to give a conclusive demonstration of this view. Later, when\r\n  Johannes Müller in 1858 and myself in 1862 recognised the peculiar\r\n  \"yellow cells\" which occur in large numbers in many Radiolaria as true\r\n  nucleated cells, it appeared impossible any longer to maintain the\r\n  unicellular nature of the Radiolaria; also the great complication which I\r\n  showed to exist in the structure of _Thalassicolla_ appeared to\r\n  contradict it. Only after Cienkowski (1871) and Brandt (1881) had shown\r\n  that the \"yellow cells\" do not belong to the Radiolarian organism, but\r\n  are symbiotic unicellular algæ, was it possible to revive and demonstrate\r\n  anew the unicellular nature of the Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Morphological Individuality._--From the morphological standpoint the\r\nindividuality of the unicellular elementary organism is obvious in the\r\nordinary solitary Radiolaria (Monobia), and is to be so regarded that the\r\nwhole body with all its constituent parts, and not merely the central\r\ncapsule, is to be regarded as _a cell_. Naturally the xanthellæ or yellow\r\ncells (§§ 76, 90), which as independent algæ live in symbiosis with many\r\nRadiolaria, must be excluded. The unicellular organisation of the\r\nRadiolaria is further to be distinguished from that of the other Protista,\r\ninasmuch as an internal membrane (capsule-membrane) separates the central\r\n(medullary) from the peripheral (cortical) portion. In the coenobia of the\r\nsocial Radiolaria (or Polycyttaria), the morphological individuality\r\npersists only as regards the medullary portions of the aggregated cells\r\n(the individual central capsules), while the cortical portions fuse\r\ncompletely to form a common extracapsulum. Hence in these SPUMELLARIA\r\npolyzoa two different stages of morphological individuality must be\r\ndistinguished, the _Cell_ as a _Morphon of the first stage_, and the\r\n_Coenobium_ as a _Morphon of the second stage_.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Physiological Individuality._--From the physiological standpoint also\r\nthe individuality of the unicellular organism is immediately obvious in the\r\ncase of the ordinary solitary Radiolaria (Monobia); as in other Protista it\r\nfulfils all the functions of life by itself alone. This physiological\r\nindividuality of the monobious Radiolarian cell is furthermore not\r\ninfluenced by the xanthellæ, which live as independent algæ in symbiosis\r\nwith many Radiolaria; even though these often by the production of starch\r\nassist in the {vii}nourishment of the Radiolaria, yet they are by no means\r\nindispensable to them. On the other hand, the physiological individuality\r\noffers more complicated relations in the social Radiolaria (Polycyttaria)\r\nwhich live united in colonies or coenobia. Here the actual _Bion_ (or the\r\nfully developed physiological individual) is not represented by the\r\nindividual cells, but by the whole multicellular coenobium, which in each\r\nspecies has a definite form and size. In these coenobia, which are usually\r\nspherical or cylindrical jelly-like masses, several millimeters in\r\ndiameter, numerous cells are so intimately united that only their medullary\r\nportions (the central capsule with the endoplasm) remain independent; the\r\ncortical portions (calymma and exoplasm) on the contrary uniting into a\r\ncommon extracapsulum. This discharges, as a whole, the functions of\r\nlocomotion, sensation, and inception of nutriment, while the separate\r\ncentral capsules act in the main only as reproductive organs (forming\r\nspores) and partly also as the central organs of metastasis (digestion).\r\nEach coenobium may also be regarded as a polycyttarium, _i.e._, a\r\n\"multicellular Radiolarian,\" whose numerous central capsules represent so\r\nmany sporangia or spore-capsules.\r\n\r\n  On this head compare the section in my monograph of 1862 (L. N. 16),\r\n  entitled Die Organisation der Radiolarien-Colonien; _Polyzoen_ oder\r\n  _Polycyttarien?_ (pp. 116 to 126); and also R. Hertwig, Zur Histologie\r\n  der Radiolarien, 1876 (L. N. 26, p. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n14. _Monocyttaria_ and _Polycyttaria_.--In the majority of the Radiolaria\r\neach unicellular organism passes its individual life in an isolated\r\ncondition (as a Monocyttarium). Only in a part of the SPUMELLARIA numerous\r\nunicellular individuals are united into societies which are regarded as\r\ncoenobia or colonies (Polycyttaria). This is the case in three different\r\nfamilies belonging to the PERIPYLEA, in the Collozoida (without a skeleton,\r\nPl. 3), the Sphærozoida (with a Beloid skeleton, Pl. 4), and the\r\nCollosphærida (with a Sphæroid skeleton, Pls. 5-8). All three families of\r\nPolycyttaria (or social Radiolaria), agree in their mode of forming\r\ncolonies, since the central capsules of the social individuals remain\r\nseparate and lie in a common jelly-like mass, which is formed by the fusion\r\nof their extracapsulum. The chief part of the voluminous colonies, which\r\nattain a diameter of several millimetres (sometimes more than 1 cm.), and\r\nare generally spherical, ellipsoidal or cylindrical, consists therefore of\r\nthe jelly-like calymma, and this is penetrated by a sarcoplegma, to whose\r\nmeshes all the individual organisms contribute by means of the pseudopodia,\r\nwhich radiate from their sarcomatrix. A further peculiarity in which the\r\nsocial SPUMELLARIA differ from the solitary consists in the fact that the\r\nformer are precocious and the latter serotinous in the division of the\r\nnucleus (§ 64). Whilst in the solitary or monozootic SPUMELLARIA the middle\r\nof the central capsule is occupied by the simple nucleus, and this divides\r\nonly at a late period (immediately before the formation of spores) into the\r\nnumerous spore nuclei, in the colonial or polyzootic SPUMELLARIA this\r\ndivision takes place very early, and the middle of each central capsule is\r\nusually occupied by an oil-globule.\r\n\r\n  {viii}The colonial Radiolaria were described as early as the year 1834 by\r\n  Meyen, the first investigator of the class, under the name _Sphærozoum_,\r\n  and, as _Palmellaria_, compared with the gelatinous colonies of the\r\n  Nostochineæ. The first accurate observations upon their structure were,\r\n  however, made in 1851 by Huxley, who described examples of all three\r\n  families under the name _Thalassicolla punctata_.  More extended,\r\n  however, were the investigations of Johannes Müller, who in his\r\n  fundamental work (1858) divided the whole class Radiolaria into\r\n  _Solitaria_ and _Polyzoa_.  The _Radiolaria solitaria_ he divided into\r\n  Thalassicolla, Polycystina and Acanthometra, the _Radiolaria polyzoa_\r\n  into Sphærozoa (without a shell) and Collosphæra (with a shell).  The\r\n  most accurate delineation of the Polycyttaria was given by Hertwig in his\r\n  beautiful memoir, Zur Histologie der Radiolarien (1876). Quite recently,\r\n  however (1886), since the completion of my manuscript upon the Challenger\r\n  Radiolaria, a very complete Monograph of the Polycyttaria has appeared by\r\n  Karl Brandt, Die colonie-bildenden Radiolarien (Sphærozoen) des Golfes\r\n  von Neapel und der angrenzenden Meeres-Abschnitte (276 pp., 8 pls.,\r\n  Berlin).  It contains in particular most valuable contributions to the\r\n  physiology and histology.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. _The Central Capsule and Extracapsulum._--The special peculiarity of\r\nthe unicellular Radiolarian organism, by which it is clearly distinguished\r\nfrom all other Rhizopoda (and indeed from most other Protista), is its\r\ndifferentiation into two separate chief constituents, the central capsule\r\nand extracapsulum, and the formation of a special membrane which separates\r\nthem. This, the capsule-membrane, is not to be compared with an ordinary\r\ncell-membrane, as an external layer, but rather to be regarded as an\r\ninternal differentiated product. The extracapsulum or external (cortical)\r\nportion of the body is in most Radiolaria more voluminous than the central\r\ncapsule or inner (medullary) portion. The exoplasm of the former (the\r\ncortical or extracapsular protoplasm) is emphatically different from the\r\nendoplasm of the latter (the medullary or intracapsular protoplasm).\r\nBesides the most important vital processes are distributed by division of\r\nlabour so completely between them that they appear most distinctly\r\nco-ordinated. The central capsule is on the one hand the general central\r\norgan of the \"cell-soul\" for the discharge of its sensory and motor\r\nfunctions (comparable to a ganglion-cell), on the other hand the special\r\norgan of reproduction (sporangium). The extracapsulum, also, is not less\r\nsignificant, since on the one hand its calymma acts as a protecting\r\nenvelope to the central capsule, as a support to the pseudopodia, and a\r\nfoundation for the skeleton or a matrix for the development of the shell,\r\nand on the other hand its pseudopodia are of the utmost importance as\r\nperipheral organs of movement and sensation as well as of nutrition and\r\nrespiration. The _central capsule_ and the _extracapsulum_ are therefore to\r\nbe regarded both morphologically and physiologically as the two\r\n_characteristic co-ordinated principal parts_ of the unicellular\r\nRadiolarian organism.\r\n\r\n  In most of the more modern delineations of the Radiolaria the central\r\n  capsule is regarded as the \"cell proper\" and its membrane as the\r\n  \"cell-wall.\" The following facts are opposed to the correctness of this\r\n  interpretation:--1. In most Radiolaria the exoplasm is clearly different\r\n  from {ix}the endoplasm, and the former is more voluminous than the\r\n  latter. 2. In all Radiolaria the division of labour is so carried out\r\n  between the central capsule and the extracapsulum, that the physiological\r\n  significance and independence of both principal parts of the cell is\r\n  almost equally great. 3. It is only in the ACANTHARIA that the formation\r\n  of the skeleton takes place within the central capsule; in all the other\r\n  three legions it is quite independent of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. _The Malacoma and Skeleton._--Whilst the division of the unicellular\r\norganism into central capsule and extracapsulum is undoubtedly the most\r\nimportant character of the Radiolarian organism, the development of a\r\nskeleton of peculiar and most varied form is of very striking significance.\r\nThis skeleton is _always a secondary product of the cell_, but is always\r\nanatomically so independent, and so clearly marked off from the soft parts\r\nor malacoma, that it seems advisable to regard both separately in a general\r\nmorphological survey. The skeleton stands in a different relation to each\r\nof the two principal constituents of the malacoma. Only in the ACANTHARIA\r\nis it centrogenous and developed from the central capsule outwards. In the\r\nother three legions the skeleton never arises in the centre of the capsule;\r\nin the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA it is always extracapsular; in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA it is also outside the central capsule originally, but\r\nafterwards becomes often surrounded by it, and finally lies in most cases\r\npartly within and partly without the central capsule. The chemical basis of\r\nthe skeleton in the ACANTHARIA is the curious acanthin (an organic\r\nsubstance allied to chitin), in the PHÆODARIA a silicate of carbon, and in\r\nthe NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA silica.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. _Ground-Forms of the Radiolaria (Promorphology)._--The ground-forms of\r\nthe Radiolaria exhibit a greater variety than those of any other class in\r\nthe organic world, greater indeed than is to be found in all the remaining\r\ngroups together. For every conceivable ground-form which can be defined in\r\nthe system of promorphology is actually present in the Radiolaria; their\r\nskeleton exhibits, as it were, in material existence, certain geometrical\r\nground-forms which are found in no other organisms. The cause of this\r\nunexampled richness in different forms lies chiefly in the static relations\r\nof the Radiolaria, which swim freely in the sea, partly also in the\r\npeculiar plasticity of their protoplasm and the material of their\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\n  Regarding the general system of ground-forms compare my Generelle\r\n  Morphologie (1866, Bd. i. pp. 375-552; Bd. iv., Allgemeine\r\n  Grundformenlehre). The ground-forms there proposed and systematically\r\n  defined have, however, found but little acceptance (chiefly, no doubt,\r\n  owing to the difficult and complicated nomenclature); but having now,\r\n  twenty years after their publication, anew carefully revised and\r\n  critically studied them, I can find no sufficient reason for abandoning\r\n  the principles there adopted. On the contrary the study of the Challenger\r\n  Radiolaria during the last ten years, with its incomparable wealth of\r\n  forms, has only confirmed the accuracy of my system of ground-forms. The\r\n  customary treatment of these in zoological and botanical handbooks (such\r\n  as those of Claus and Sachs) is quite insufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n{x}18. _The Principal Groups of Geometrical Ground-Forms._--The great\r\nvariety of the geometrical ground-forms which are actually realised in the\r\nvariously shaped bodies of the Radiolaria, renders it desirable to classify\r\nthese in as small a number as possible of principal groups and a larger\r\nnumber of subdivisions. As extensive principal groups four at least must be\r\ndistinguished; the _Centrostigma_ or Sphærotypic, the _Centraxonia_ or\r\nGrammotypic, the _Centroplana_ or Zygotypic, and the _Acentrica_ or Atypic.\r\nThe natural centre of the body, about which all its parts are regularly\r\narranged, is in the first group a point (stigma), in the second a straight\r\nline (principal axis), in the third a plane (sagittal plane), in the fourth\r\na centre is of course wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _The Centrostigma or Sphærotypic Ground-Forms._--The first group of\r\ngeometrical ground-forms, here distinguished as sphærotypic or the\r\ncentrostigma, is undoubtedly the most important among the Radiolaria,\r\ninasmuch as if these be considered monophyletic, it must be the original\r\none from which all the other ground-forms have been derived. The common\r\ncharacter of all these sphærotypic ground-forms is that their natural\r\ncentre is a point (stigma); thus there is no single principal axis (or\r\nprotaxon) such as is characteristic of the two following groups. The\r\nsphærotypic ground-forms are subdivided into two important smaller groups,\r\nthe _spheres_ (Homaxonia) and the _endospherical polyhedra_ (Polyaxonia).\r\nThe spherical ground-forms, fully developed in the central capsule and\r\ncalymma of _Actissa_ and the #Sphæroidea# as well as in many ACANTHARIA,\r\npresent no different axes; all possible axes passing through the centre of\r\nthe body are equal (Homaxonia). In the endospherical polyhedra, on the\r\ncontrary, numerous axes (three at least) may be distinguished, which are\r\nprecisely equal to each other and different from all the remaining axes\r\n(Polyaxonia). If the extremities of these axes, or the poles, which are all\r\nequidistant from the common centre, be united by straight lines, a\r\npolyhedral figure is produced whose angles all lie in the surface of the\r\nsphere. According as the poles of the axes are at equal, subequal, or at\r\ndifferent distances from each other, we may divide the endospherical\r\npolyhedra into regular, subregular and irregular. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd.\r\ni. pp. 404-416.)\r\n\r\n\r\n20. _The Centraxonia or Grammotypic Ground-Forms._--The second principal\r\ngroup of organic ground-forms, here called grammotypic or centraxonia, is\r\ncharacterised by the fact that a straight line (gramma) or a single\r\nprincipal axis (protaxon) forms the natural centre of the body. This\r\nimportant and extensive group is divided into two subgroups, those with one\r\naxis (Monaxonia) and those with crossed axes (Stauraxonia); in the latter\r\ndifferent secondary transverse or cross-axes may be distinguished, but not\r\nin the former. In the Monaxonia, therefore, every transverse section of the\r\nbody perpendicular to the principal axis is a circle, in the Stauraxonia,\r\non the contrary, a polygon. The Monaxonia are further subdivided into two\r\ngroups, in one of which the two poles of the principal axis {xi}are equal\r\nand similar (Isopolar), in the other of which they are different\r\n(Allopolar); in the former the two halves of the body, which are separated\r\nby the equatorial plane (or the largest transverse plane, perpendicular to\r\nthe principal axis), are equal, in the latter unequal. Among the isopolar\r\nuniaxial ground-forms (Monaxonia isopola) may be mentioned the ellipsoidal,\r\nspheroidal, lenticular, &c.; to the allopolar uniaxial forms (Monaxonia\r\nallopola) belong the conical, hemispherical, ovoid, &c. In the same way the\r\npyramidal ground-forms with crossed axes are divisible into two groups,\r\naccording as the two poles of the principal axis are equal or not. The\r\nground-form of the former is the double pyramid, that of the latter the\r\nsingle pyramid. Both the double and the single pyramids may again be\r\nsubdivided, each into two important lesser groups, the regular and the\r\namphithect. In the first division the equatorial plane of the double and\r\nthe basal plane of the single pyramid is a regular polygon (square, &c.),\r\nwhilst in the other division it is an elongated or amphithect polygon\r\n(rhombus, &c.); the crossed axes are equal in the former, unequal in the\r\nlatter. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 416-494.)\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _The Centroplana or Zygotypic Ground-Forms._--The third principal group\r\nof ground-forms includes those which are bilaterally symmetrical in the\r\nordinary sense, or zeugitic or zygotypic; the natural centre of their body\r\nis a plane. These forms are the only ones in which the distinction between\r\nright and left is possible, since their body is divided by the median plane\r\n(planum sagittale) into two symmetrical halves (right and left). In all\r\nthese zeugites the position of every part is determined by three axes\r\nperpendicular to each other, and of these three dimensive axes two are\r\nallopolar, one is isopolar. The two unlike poles of the principal (or\r\nlongitudinal) axis are the oral and aboral, the two unlike poles of the\r\nsagittal (or vertical) axis are the dorsal and ventral; the two similar\r\npoles of the frontal (or transverse) axis, however, are the right and left.\r\nThis important group of zeugitic or bilateral forms may also be divided\r\ninto two clearly distinct lesser groups, the _Amphipleura_ and the\r\n_Zygopleura_. In the Amphipleura (or bilaterally radial ground-forms) the\r\n\"radial two-sided\" body is produced by modification of a regular pyramid\r\n(as _Spatangus_ from _Echinus_), and hence is composed of several (not less\r\nthan three) antimeres. In the Zygopleura (or bilaterally symmetrical\r\nground-forms) on the other hand, the bodies consist of two antimeres (as in\r\nall the higher animals, Vertebrata, Arthropoda, &c.). (See Gener. Morphol.,\r\nBd. i. pp. 495-527.)\r\n\r\n\r\n22. _The Acentrica or Atypic Ground-Forms._--Among the acentrica or\r\nanaxonia are included all those ground-forms which are absolutely\r\nirregular, and in which neither a definite centre nor constant axes can be\r\ndistinguished (_e.g._, most Sponges). These quite irregular ground-forms\r\nare very rare among the Radiolaria, but nevertheless there may be referred\r\nto them the amoeboid central capsule of some #Colloidea# (_Collodastrum_,\r\np. 27, Pl. 3, figs. 4, 5) among the SPUMELLARIA, the irregular shells of\r\nmany Collosphærida {xii}(Pl. 8, fig. 2), and the absolutely irregular\r\nshells of the Phorticida and Soreumida among the #Larcoidea#. (See Gener.\r\nMorphol., Bd. i. p. 400.)\r\n\r\n\r\n23. _The Subsidiary Groups of Geometrical Ground-Forms._--The four natural\r\nprincipal groups of ground-forms, which have just been defined according to\r\nthe nature of the centre of their bodies, may be divided again into\r\nnumerous subsidiary groups, defined by the relations of the constant axes\r\nand the two poles of each axis, as well as by the number of the axes and\r\nthe differentiation of the secondary with respect to the principal axis.\r\nThe most important of these subsidiary groups into which the principal ones\r\nare immediately divided are the following:--(1) The _Centrostigma_ (or\r\nsphærotypic) are divided into spheres (Homaxonia) and endospherical\r\npolyhedra (Polyaxonia). (2) The _Centraxonia_ (or grammotypic) into\r\nuniaxial (Monaxonia) and those with crossed axes (Stauraxonia); among the\r\nformer of these may be distinguished the isopolar (phacotypic) and the\r\nallopolar (conotypic); among the latter the double and single pyramids. (3)\r\nThe _Centroplana_ (or bilaterals) are divided into amphipleura (or\r\nbilaterally radial) and zygopleura (or bilaterally symmetrical). (4) The\r\n_Acentrica_ (or Anaxonia) or absolutely irregular ground-forms, present no\r\nspecial subdivisions.\r\n\r\n  For a complete system of the geometrical ground-forms and their relation\r\n  to promorphological classification, see Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.\r\n  555-558.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. _The Spherical or Homaxon Ground-Form._--The spherical is the only\r\nabsolutely regular ground-form, since only in it are all axes which pass\r\nthrough the centre equal; it is very often realised among the Radiolaria,\r\nespecially in the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA, where it furnishes the common\r\noriginal ground-form, but it is often to be seen in the shells of many\r\nPHÆODARIA (in most #Phæosphæria#); on the other hand, it is never found\r\namong the NASSELLARIA. Geometrical spheres, in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, are only to be found among the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA, namely, in\r\nthe central capsule of many #Collodaria# (Pls. 1, 2) and all #Sphæroidea#\r\n(Pls. 11-30) as well as many Acanthometra and Acanthophracta (Pls.\r\n128-138). Nevertheless, speaking generally, one includes those central\r\ncapsules and skeletons which have been distinguished here as endospherical\r\npolyhedra. (On these ground-forms see Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 404-406.)\r\n\r\n\r\n25. _The Endospherical Polyhedral Ground-Form._--The endospherical\r\npolyhedron or polyaxon ground-form naturally follows the spherical or\r\nhomaxon. Under it are included all polyhedra whose angles fall in the\r\nsurface of a sphere; this ground-form is especially common among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, especially in the shells of #Sphæroidea#, but is also found\r\namong the ACANTHARIA (especially in the Astrolophida and #Sphærophracta#),\r\nas well as among the #Phæosphæria# (in most genera of the Orosphærida,\r\nSagosphærida, and Aulosphærida). Strictly speaking, all those\r\nlattice-shells which have {xiii}been incorrectly called \"spherical\" belong\r\nto this category, for they are none of them true spheres in the geometrical\r\nsense (like the central capsules of the #Sphæroidea#), but rather\r\nendospherical polyhedra, whose angles are indicated by the nodal points of\r\nthe lattice shell, or the radial spines which spring from them. These\r\nendospherical polyhedra may be divided into three groups, the regular,\r\nsubregular, and irregular. Of _regular polyhedra_, properly so-called, it\r\nmay be shown geometrically that only five can exist, namely, the regular\r\ntetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. All these are\r\nactually manifested among the Radiolaria, although but seldom.  Much more\r\ncommon are the _subregular endospherical polyhedra_, _e.g._, spherical\r\nlattice-shells with regular hexagonal meshes of equal size; they are never\r\nexactly equal nor perfectly regular, but the divergences are so\r\ninsignificant that they escape superficial observation (Pl. 20, figs. 3, 4;\r\nPl. 26, figs. 1-3). On the contrary in the _irregular endospherical\r\npolyhedra_ the meshes of the lattice-sphere are more or less different in\r\nsize and often in form also (Pl. 28, figs. 4, 8; Pl. 30, figs. 4, 6). The\r\nfive truly regular polyhedra require separate notice on account of their\r\nimportance. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 406.)\r\n\r\n\r\n26. _The Regular Icosahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose\r\ngeometrical type is the regular icosahedron (bounded by twenty equilateral\r\ntriangles) is rarely exemplified, but it occurs among the PHÆODARIA in the\r\nCircoporid genus _Circogonia_ (Pl. 117, fig. 1), and also in certain\r\nAulosphærida, but, apparently, only as an accidental variation (_e.g._,\r\n_Aulosphæra icosahedra_). Furthermore, this ground-form may also be assumed\r\nto occur in those #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shells bear twelve\r\nequidistant radial spines (_e.g._, many species of _Acanthosphæra_,\r\n_Heliosphæra_, and other Astrosphærida); the basal points of these spines\r\nindicate the twelve angles of the regular icosahedron. (See on this head\r\nGener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 411.)\r\n\r\n\r\n27. _The Regular Dodecahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose\r\ngeometrical type is the regular dodecahedron (or pentagonal dodecahedron),\r\nbounded by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, is very rarely\r\nfound perfectly developed, as in _Circorrhegma dodecahedra_ (Pl. 117, fig.\r\n2). This form is by no means so common among the Radiolaria as in the\r\npollen grains of plants (_e.g._, _Buchholzia maritima_, _Fumaria spicata_,\r\n_Polygonum amphibium_, &c.). It can, however, be regarded as present in all\r\nthose #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shells bear twenty equal and\r\nequidistant radial spines (_e.g._, many species of _Acanthosphæra_,\r\n_Heliosphæra_, and other Astrosphærida); the basal points of these spines\r\nmark out the twenty angles of the regular pentagonal dodecahedron. (See\r\nGener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 412.)\r\n\r\n\r\n28. _The Regular Octahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose\r\ngeometrical type is the regular octahedron (bounded by eight equilateral\r\ntriangles), commonly appears among the SPUMELLARIA in the family\r\nCubosphærida (p. 169, Pls. 21-25). In {xiv}these #Sphæroidea# the typical\r\nground-form is usually indicated by six equal radial spines, which are\r\nopposed to each other in pairs, and lie in three similar axes perpendicular\r\nto each other; these are the three axes of the tesseral crystallographic\r\nsystem; one of them is vertical, whilst the other two cross each other at\r\nright angles in its centre. Occasionally, too, the spherical form of the\r\nlattice-shell passes over into that of the regular octahedron (Pl. 22,\r\nfigs. 8, 10). The same form recurs in _Circoporus_ (Pl. 117, fig. 6) among\r\nthe PHÆODARIA. In the vegetable kingdom it is exhibited by the antheridia\r\nof _Chara_. It is not found in the NASSELLARIA and ACANTHARIA. (See Gener.\r\nMorphol., Bd. i. p. 412.)\r\n\r\n\r\n29. _The Regular Cubic Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose geometrical\r\ntype is that of a die or cube, is actually presented in a very striking\r\nmanner by various Radiolaria. Among the SPUMELLARIA it occurs in certain\r\n#Sphæroidea#, _e.g._, in the Astrosphærid genera _Centrocubus_ and\r\n_Octodendron_ (Pl. 18, figs. 1-3); in these the central medullary shell is\r\na complete cube, bounded by six equal squares, from the eight angles of\r\nwhich eight equal radial spines project. This form can also be regarded as\r\npresent in those #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shell bears eight\r\nequal and equidistant radial spines (many Astrosphærida). Besides these the\r\ncubic ground-form is to be seen in certain NASSELLARIA of the family\r\nTympanida, especially in _Lithocubus_ (Pl. 82, fig. 12; Pl. 94, fig. 13),\r\nin many species of _Acrocubus_, _Microcubus_, &c.; the twelve bars of its\r\nlattice-skeleton correspond often exactly to the edges of the cube. (See\r\nGener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 413.)\r\n\r\n\r\n30. _The Regular Tetrahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose\r\ngeometrical type is the regular tetrahedron, bounded by four equilateral\r\ntriangles, occurs less frequently in the Radiolaria than the other four\r\nregular polyhedra. Among the SPUMELLARIA it is found in the #Beloidea#, and\r\nespecially in those members of the Thalassosphærida and Sphærozoida whose\r\nspicules bear four equal branches, diverging at equal angles from a common\r\ncentre. Precisely the same structure is seen also among the NASSELLARIA in\r\nsome #Plectoidea#, as in _Tetraplagia_ among the Plagonida, and\r\n_Tetraplecta_ among the Plectanida. The skeleton of both these genera\r\nconsists of four equal rods, which radiate at equal angles from a common\r\ncentre, just as do the axes of the regular tetrahedron. The tetrahedral\r\nform of these #Plectoidea# is the more important and interesting since on\r\nthe one hand it is related to the similar spicular form of the #Beloidea#,\r\nand on the other perhaps furnishes the starting point from which _Cortina_\r\namong the NASSELLARIA may be derived (_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_). (See\r\nGener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 415.)\r\n\r\n\r\n31. _The Isopolar-Monaxon or Phacotypic Ground-Form._--The isopolar\r\nuniaxial or phacotypic ground-form is characterised by the possession of a\r\nvertical main axis with {xv}equal poles, whilst no transverse axes are\r\ndifferentiated. All horizontal planes which cut the axis at right angles\r\nare circles, and increase in size from the poles towards the equator. The\r\nmost important ground-forms of this group are the _phacoid_ (the lens or\r\noblate spheroid) and the _ellipsoid_ (or prolate spheroid). Phacoids (or\r\ngeometrical lenses with blunt margins) are very often presented by the\r\ncentral capsules of the #Discoidea# and of many ACANTHARIA (Quadrilonchida\r\nand Hexalaspida), but the lattice-shells of many SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA\r\nexhibit the same form, as also do a few PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, _Aulophacus_).\r\nTrue geometrical ellipsoids are seen in the central capsules of many\r\n#Prunoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA, and of many Amphilonchida and\r\nBelonaspida among the ACANTHARIA. Furthermore, the lattice shells of many\r\nspecies of these groups retain the same essential form, _e.g._, many\r\nEllipsida, Druppulida, and Spongurida (Pls. 13-17, and 39), as well as most\r\nBelonaspida. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 422.)\r\n\r\n\r\n32. _Allopolar-Monaxon or Conotypic Ground-Form._--The allopolar uniaxial\r\nor conotypic ground-form is characterised by the possession of a vertical\r\nmain axis whose two poles are unlike, while no transverse axes are\r\ndifferentiated.  All horizontal planes cutting the main axis at right\r\nangles are circles, and decrease more rapidly from the largest plane\r\ntowards the basal than towards the apical pole.  The most important\r\nground-forms of this group are the ovoid, the cone, and the hemisphere.\r\nThey often occur (and in geometrical perfection) in the egg-shaped central\r\ncapsule and podoconus of the NASSELLARIA, as well as in the shells of\r\nseveral groups of this legion, particularly in the Cyrtocalpida or\r\nMonocyrtida eradiata (Pl. 51, figs. 10-13), and in many Stichocyrtida\r\neradiata; furthermore, they are also seen among the PHÆODARIA, _e.g._,\r\ncertain Challengerida (Pl. 99, figs. 19-22). (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i.\r\np. 426.)\r\n\r\n\r\n33. _The Regular Dipyramidal or Quadrilonchial Ground-Form._--The\r\nground-forms whose geometrical type is the regular double pyramid are\r\ncharacterised by a vertical main axis which possesses equal poles, and\r\nwhich is crossed at its centre by several equal transverse axes. The\r\nhorizontal equatorial plane is therefore a regular polygon, and divides the\r\nbody into two equal regular pyramids.  The simplest and commonest form of\r\nthis group is the quadratic octahedron, the ground-form of the quadratic\r\ncrystallographic system; its equatorial plane is a square. This regular\r\ndipyramidal ground-form occurs among the SPUMELLARIA in the shells of the\r\nStaurosphærida as well as of many #Discoidea#, in which several equidistant\r\nradial spines or arms lie in the quadratic equatorial plane of the body,\r\nand project from the margin of the lenticular disc (_e.g._, _Sethostaurus_,\r\nPl. 31; _Histiastrum_, Pl. 46, &c.). It is, however, among the ACANTHARIA\r\nthat the most important part is played by this ground-form (and especially\r\nby the quadratic octahedron); it forms the basis of all those\r\n#Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta# in which twenty radial spines are\r\ndisposed according to the Müllerian Law, and in which {xvi}the four\r\nequatorial spines are of equal dimensions (Icosacantha). (See Gener.\r\nMorphol., Bd. i. p. 436-446.)\r\n\r\n\r\n34. _The Amphithect Dipyramidal or Lentelliptical Ground-Forms._--The\r\nground-forms whose geometrical type is the lenticular or \"triaxial\"\r\nellipsoid, may also be designated amphithect double pyramids; they are\r\ncharacterised by the possession of a vertical main axis which has similar\r\npoles, and is crossed at its middle by two transverse axes, unequal but\r\nisopolar. The horizontal equatorial plane of the body is therefore an\r\namphithect or elongated polygon (a rhombus in the simplest case possible),\r\nand divides the whole body into two equal amphithect pyramids. The simplest\r\nand commonest form of this group is the rhombic octahedron, which is also\r\nthe ground-form of the rhombic crystallographic system. It plays an\r\nimportant part in those ACANTHARIA in which twenty radial spines are\r\ndisposed according to the Müllerian Law, but in which the two pairs of\r\nequatorial spines are unequal (different geotomical and hydrotomical axes,\r\nsee p. 719); to this category belong the Amphilonchida (Pl. 132),\r\nBelonaspida (Pl. 136), Hexalaspida (Pl. 139), and Diploconida (Pl. 140). A\r\nform essentially identical obtains also among the SPUMELLARIA in the\r\nmajority of the #Larcoidea#, both in their triaxial lattice-shells, and in\r\ntheir lentelliptical central capsules, which present geometrically accurate\r\ntriaxial ellipsoids, with three unequal isopolar axes at right angles to\r\neach other. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 446-452.)\r\n\r\n\r\n35. _The Regular Pyramidal Ground-Forms._--The ground-forms whose\r\ngeometrical type is the regular pyramid, and which are the most conspicuous\r\nin the Medusæ, Polyps, Corals, and regular Echinoderms (the Radiata of\r\nearlier authors), are almost confined among the Radiolaria to the legion\r\nNASSELLARIA; they occur, however, in the great majority of these, and\r\nespecially in those families which may be classed together as \"#Cyrtoidea#\r\ntriradiata et multiradiata.\" Strictly speaking, however, almost all these\r\nNASSELLARIA, at all events in their origin, are bilateral or dipleuric,\r\nsince the primary sagittal ring with its characteristic apophyses marks out\r\nthe sagittal median plane, and further, since the three feet of the basal\r\ntripod are usually divided into an unpaired dorsal (pes caudalis) and two\r\npaired ventral or lateral (pedes pectorales, dexter et sinister). On the\r\nother hand, it is noteworthy, firstly, that among the primitive\r\n#Plectoidea# there are perfectly regular radial forms, without any\r\nindication of an original bilateral symmetry, and secondly, that similar\r\nforms are also very common among the #Cyrtoidea#, probably as secondary\r\nradial forms, developed from primitive bilateral ones. Similar cases also\r\noccur in certain PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, the Medusettida and Tuscarorida, Pls.\r\n100, 120), but they are entirely wanting among the ACANTHARIA and\r\nSPUMELLARIA. The multiradial NASSELLARIA have arisen from the triradial by\r\nthe interpolation of three, six, nine, or more interradial and adradial\r\nsecondary apophyses between the three primary perradial ones. (See Gener.\r\nMorphol., Bd. i. pp. 459-874.)\r\n\r\n\r\n{xvii}36. _The Amphithect Pyramidal Ground-Forms._--The ground-forms whose\r\ngeometrical type is the amphithect pyramid, are distinguished from the\r\nregular pyramidal forms, just discussed, chiefly by the form of the basal\r\nplane, which is not a regular, but an amphithect or elongated polygon (in\r\nthe simplest case a rhombus). Hence in this case the allopolar main axis of\r\nthe body is crossed by two transverse axes which are isopolar and at right\r\nangles, but are unequal; they cannot, however be distinguished as sagittal\r\nand frontal axes as is the case in the zeugites. In the animal as well as\r\nin the vegetable kingdom, an important part is played by this ground-form,\r\n_e.g._, in the Ctenophora, where it is the rhombic pyramid.  Among the\r\nRadiolaria it is not common, though it is clearly expressed among the\r\nNASSELLARIA in a number of #Stephoidea# (Stephanida and Tympanida), as well\r\nas in many #Spyroidea# (_e.g._, the bipedal Zygospirida). It is very\r\naccurately developed among the PHÆODARIA in the bivalved #Phæoconchia#\r\n(Pls. 121-128), where the two valves of the shell (dorsal and ventral) are\r\ngenerally exactly alike, their median keels corresponding to the poles of\r\nthe sagittal axis. In the slit between the two valves lie the two secondary\r\nopenings (right and left) of the tripylean central capsule, corresponding\r\nto the two poles of the frontal axis, and the main axis stands\r\nperpendicularly to both these, its oral pole being indicated by the\r\nastropyle, or principal aperture. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.\r\n479-494.)\r\n\r\n\r\n37. _The Amphipleural Ground-Forms._--By the term amphipleural ground-forms\r\nare to be understood those usually defined as \"bilaterally radial\"; their\r\ngeometrical type is a half amphithect pyramid. The best known examples of\r\nthis form in the animal kingdom are the bilateral five-rayed Echinoderms\r\n(_Spatangus_, _Clypeaster_), in the vegetable kingdom the symmetrical\r\nfive-rayed flowers (_Viola_, _Trifolium_). The three dimensive axes have\r\nthe same relation as in the zygopleura, to be next discussed, and which\r\nalso resemble them in being divisible only by one plane (the sagittal\r\nmedian plane) into two equal halves. They differ, however, the amphipleural\r\nbody not being made up of two antimeres, but of at least three pairs of\r\nantimeres (or three parameres), being therefore primitively radial. Hence\r\neach of the symmetrical halves of the body contains more than one antimere.\r\nAmong the Radiolaria this form does not occur in the SPUMELLARIA,\r\nACANTHARIA, or PHÆODARIA; it is very common, however, among the\r\nNASSELLARIA; many #Cyrtoidea# multiradiata and #Spyroidea# multiradiata\r\nshow this bilaterally radial ground-form, inasmuch as the body consists of\r\ntwo symmetrical halves, and is also composed of numerous (usually three,\r\nsix, nine, or more) radial parameres. In the multiradiate Dicyrtida and\r\nTricyrtida the cephalis (the first joint) is usually bilateral, whilst the\r\nthorax (the second joint) is multiradial. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.\r\n495-506.)\r\n\r\n\r\n38. _The Zygopleural Ground-Forms._--As zygopleural or dipleural\r\nground-forms, as opposed to the amphipleural, are classed those zeugites or\r\ncentroplana which are known {xviii}as \"bilaterally symmetrical\" in the\r\nstrictest sense of the term. This is the most important ground-form in the\r\nanimal kingdom, inasmuch as it obtains almost exclusively among the higher\r\nanimals (Vertebrata, Articulata, Mollusca, Vermes). The body consists of\r\nonly two antimeres, which correspond to the two symmetrical halves of the\r\nbody. Of the three dimensive axes two are allopolar, one isopolar; the oral\r\npole of the longitudinal main axis is different from the aboral; the dorsal\r\npole of the sagittal axis is different from the ventral; but the right pole\r\nof the frontal axis is equal to the left. The right antimere is usually\r\nprecisely similar to the left (Eudipleura), more rarely it is slightly\r\ndissimilar or asymmetrical (Dysdipleura). Among the Radiolaria this\r\nground-form is entirely wanting in the Porulosa or Holotrypasta\r\n(SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA), but on the contrary it is very common in the\r\nOsculosa or Merotrypasta (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA). In the NASSELLARIA it\r\nis of special importance, for the typical _Cortina_ (the combination of the\r\nprimary sagittal ring with the basal tripod) exhibits the zygopleural\r\nground-form clearly sketched out; indeed it is usually clearly seen even in\r\nthe sagittal ring itself, for its ventral segment is more strongly curved\r\nthan the dorsal; its basal (or oral) pole is always different from the\r\napical (or aboral). Of the three feet of the basal tripod the unpaired\r\n(caudal) one is directed dorsally and backwards, the two paired (pectoral)\r\nones ventrally and forwards. The majority of the NASSELLARIA may be\r\nregarded as modifications of this original ground-form. Its relation to the\r\nprimitively triradiate tripod presents a still unsolved problem, and the\r\nnumerous relations of the zygopleural to the multiradiate ground-forms in\r\nthe NASSELLARIA are exceedingly complicated. The zygopleural ground-form is\r\nless widely distributed among the PHÆODARIA, though it is very\r\ncharacteristically developed in the rich and varied group of Challengerida\r\n(Pl. 99). (See Gener.

In this respect the first rank is taken by statical\r\nconditions, especially the indifferent or stable equilibrium of the whole\r\norganism, which floats freely in the water. With regard to these\r\nfundamental statical relations, three principal groups of ground-forms may\r\nbe distinguished, pantostatic, polystatic, and monostatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. _Pantostatic Ground-Forms._--By pantostatic or indifferently stable\r\nground-forms are meant those in which the centre of gravity coincides with\r\nthe centre of the body, so that they are in equilibrium in any given\r\nposition. Strictly speaking, the only form which possesses perfectly\r\nindifferent equilibrium is the sphere, that being the only truly homaxon\r\nand perfectly regular form. Nevertheless, in a somewhat wider sense many\r\nPolyaxonia, especially the endospherical polyhedra with very numerous\r\nsides, may be {xx}included in this category. Such indifferently stable\r\nbodies are found among the SPUMELLARIA in many #Collodaria# and\r\n#Sphæroidea#, as well as in the Astrolophida among the ACANTHARIA. On the\r\ncontrary they are entirely wanting among the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA,\r\nsince their central capsule constantly presents a main axis with a\r\ndifferentiated basal pole, and determines the position of stable\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n42. _Polystatic Ground-Forms._--Those ground forms are defined as\r\npolystatic or multistable in which the body is in equilibrium in several\r\ndifferent positions (though not in an infinite number). The number of these\r\npositions is usually twice as many as that of the constant equal isopolar\r\naxes exhibited by the form. Hence the regular polyhedra have as many\r\npositions of equilibrium as they have angles or sides, the icosahedron\r\ntwenty, dodecahedron twelve, octahedron eight, cube six, tetrahedron four.\r\nThe isopolar monaxon ground-forms (lens, ellipsoid, cylinder) and the\r\ndiplopyramidal ground forms (quadrilonchial and lentelliptical) have two\r\npositions of stable equilibrium, since the two poles of the vertical axis\r\nare equal and similar and the body is divided into equal halves by the\r\nequatorial plane. This is the case in many SPUMELLARIA (especially\r\n#Discoidea#, #Prunoidea#, and #Larcoidea#), as well as in the great\r\nmajority of ACANTHARIA. Perhaps the same holds good also in certain\r\nNASSELLARIA (_e.g._, isopolar Tympanida) and PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, isopolar\r\n#Phæosphæria#), though here unistable equilibrium appears to be\r\nnecessitated by the constant main axis of the central capsule and the\r\ndifferentiated basal pole of the main axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. _Monostatic Ground-Forms._--Those ground-forms are classed as\r\nmonostatic or unistable in which the body is in equilibrium only in one\r\nposition, since the centre of gravity of the body lies in a constant\r\nvertical axis below its centre. This fixed position is only rarely and\r\nexceptionally found among the SPUMELLARIA (_e.g._, in _Xiphostylus_,\r\n_Sphærostylus_, _Lithomespilus_, _Lithapium_) and among the ACANTHARIA\r\n(_e.g._, in _Zygostaurus_ and _Amphibelone_). On the contrary it is quite\r\nusual among the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA (with but few exceptions); for\r\nhere a vertical main axis, with a differentiated basal pole, is determined\r\neven by the formation of the central capsule, and usually also by the\r\ncorresponding structure of the skeleton. Among the NASSELLARIA this basal\r\npole, with the porochora of the central capsule, appears always to be the\r\nlower; as also in most #Phæogromia# among the PHÆODARIA. In the peculiar\r\nbivalved #Phæoconchia#, on the other hand, the basal pole with the\r\ncannopyle is directed upwards; as also in the Challengerida and\r\nTuscarorida. The #Phæosphæria# and #Phæocystina# are probably to a large\r\nextent polystatic. In general unistable equilibrium may be assumed in the\r\nfollowing categories of ground-forms:--(1) Allopolar monaxon (conical and\r\novoid); (2) pyramidal (regular and amphithect); (3) Centroplana\r\n(amphipleura and zygopleura); (4) Anaxonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n{xxi}44. _Principal Axes._--From the foregoing consideration of the\r\nstatical conditions and their direct causal connection with the geometrical\r\nground-forms of the Radiolaria, the great mechanical significance of the\r\ndifferentiation of definite axes in these unicellular free-swimming\r\norganisms will be manifest. The most important of these is the primary main\r\naxis (axis principalis, or protaxon), which in all cases has a vertical\r\ndirection. It is wanting in the Centrostigma (spheres and endospherical\r\npolyhedra), and in the Anaxonia (acentra). It is isopolar in the phacotypic\r\nforms (Monaxonia isopola), and in the double pyramids (Stauraxonia\r\nisopola). It is allopolar in all monastatic ground-forms, in the conotypic\r\nforms (Monaxonia allopola), pyramids (Stauraxonia allopola), and the\r\nCentroplana (or bilateral forms).\r\n\r\n\r\n45. _Secondary or Transverse Axes._--In contrast to the vertical main axis\r\nall the other constant axes differentiated in the body may be called\r\n\"secondary axes,\" or \"transverse axes,\" since they cross the former at\r\ndefinite points. All ground-forms whose vertical axis is crossed by a fixed\r\nnumber of such axes at definite angles may be called \"Stauraxonia.\" They\r\nare divided into two groups, double pyramids and single pyramids; in the\r\nformer the two poles of the main axis (or the two halves of the body\r\nseparated by the equatorial plane) are similar (Stauraxonia homopola), in\r\nthe latter dissimilar (Stauraxonia heteropola). If all the secondary axes\r\nbe equal, the stauraxon ground-form is regularly radial. If some of them be\r\nunequal they are arranged in certain relations towards two primary\r\ntransverse axes, perpendicular to each other, to which all the other\r\nsecondary axes are subsidiary; the ground-forms are then either amphithect\r\nor bilateral. The two primary transverse axes, which may also be designated\r\n\"ideal transverse axes\" (euthyni), divide the vertical main axis in its\r\ncentre; one of them is the sagittal, the other the frontal. These three\r\ndimensive axes give the factors which accurately determine the ground-form\r\nand the dimensions in most Radiolaria; the vertical main axis determines\r\nthe length (principal axis); one horizontal transverse axis determines the\r\nthickness (sagittal axis), and the other the breadth (frontal axis). Those\r\nground-forms in which the transverse axes are isopolar are termed\r\n\"amphithect,\" and those in which the one (frontal or lateral) is isopolar\r\nand the other (sagittal or dorso-ventral) is allopolar, are termed\r\n\"bilateral,\" or better \"zeugitic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n46. _Primary and Secondary Ground-Forms._--The geometrical sphere must be\r\nregarded as the original ground-form of the Radiolaria; it being understood\r\nthat its monophyletic derivation from a single stem-form, _Actissa_, is\r\ncorrect. The simplest forms of _Actissa_ (_Procyttarium_, Pl. 1, fig. 1)\r\nare in fact geometrically _perfect spheres_; indeed even the individual\r\nparts which compose their unicellular bodies (nucleolus, nucleus, central\r\ncapsule and calymma) are concentric spheres. But in addition the central\r\ncapsules of most other SPUMELLARIA, especially the #Sphæroidea#, as well as\r\nof many ACANTHARIA {xxii}are true spheres. Furthermore the simple or\r\nconcentrically composed lattice-spheres of #Sphæroidea#, #Sphærophracta#,\r\nand #Phæosphæria# may be regarded as spheres, although strictly speaking\r\nthey are endospherical polyhedra. From the primary spherical form of the\r\nRadiolaria all other secondary forms may be derived in the following\r\norder:--1. By the development of a main axis the Monaxonia arise. 2. By the\r\ndevelopment of transverse axes the Stauraxonia arise. 3. In both groups\r\n(Monaxonia and Stauraxonia) the two poles (or upper and lower halves of the\r\nbody) are at first similar (Isopola). 4. By differentiation in the two\r\npoles or halves of the body (distinction between the basal pole and the\r\napical) the forms with different poles (Allopola) arise. 5. The transverse\r\naxes of the Stauraxonia are at first equal (regular pyramids and double\r\npyramids). 6. By differentiation in the transverse axes (distinction\r\nbetween the sagittal and the frontal axis) the amphithect pyramids and\r\ndouble pyramids arise. 7. From the amphithect pyramids the Amphipleura\r\narise by differentiation of both poles of the sagittal axis. 8. The\r\nzygopleural ground-form appears last, as the simplest form of the\r\nAmphipleura.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. _The Ground-Forms of the Spumellaria._--The SPUMELLARIA, being the\r\noldest and most primitive Radiolaria, have for the most part either\r\nindifferent or multistable equilibrium; _e.g._, all #Colloidea# and\r\n#Beloidea# which have a spherical central capsule, and also most\r\n#Sphæroidea#. Among these primitive Centrostigma true spheres and\r\nendospherical polyhedra are represented in the utmost variety, and the\r\nregular polyhedra in particular. By the development of a vertical main axis\r\nthese Centrostigma have also given rise to very numerous Centraxonia, which\r\nare usually isopolar, very rarely allopolar. Sometimes they are Monaxonia\r\n(circular in transverse section), sometimes Stauraxonia (polygonal in\r\ntransverse section). The vertical main axis is longer in the #Prunoidea#,\r\nshorter in the #Discoidea# than any of the other axes. The #Larcoidea# are\r\ndistinguished by their lentelliptical or triaxial ellipsoid form; the three\r\ndifferent but isopolar axes corresponding with those of the rhombic\r\noctahedron; but even among the #Sphæroidea#, #Prunoidea#, and #Discoidea#,\r\nthis form is sometimes produced by the differentiation of two different\r\ntransverse axes at right angles to each other. Whilst these ground-forms\r\n(Centraxonia and Centrostigma) occur in the utmost variety among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, the centroplanar (or true bilateral) ground-form is entirely\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. _The Ground-Forms of Acantharia._--In the small family Astrolophida,\r\nwhich contains the most archaic forms of the legion (_Actinelius_,\r\n_Astrolophus_), the ACANTHARIA show a direct relation to the most primitive\r\nSPUMELLARIA (_Actissa_), and like these have indifferent equilibrium; their\r\ncentral capsule is a sphere, their calymma an endospherical polyhedron,\r\nwhose angles are indicated by the distal ends of the numerous {xxiii}equal\r\nradial spines. In the great majority of ACANTHARIA, however (all\r\n#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), twenty radial spines are present,\r\nregularly distributed, according to Müller's icosacanthan law, in five\r\nparallel circles, each containing four crossed spines (p. 717). Usually the\r\ntwenty spines are equal, and the ground-form is the quadratic octahedron,\r\nor a regular double pyramid with sixteen sides. But in some groups (the\r\nAmphilonchida and Prunophracta) two opposite equatorial spines are much\r\nmore strongly developed than the other eighteen, and therefore the\r\nhydrotomical axis in the equatorial plane is larger than the geotomical\r\naxis (p. 719); the isopolar stauraxonian form passes over into the\r\nallopolar, and the ground-form becomes the rhombic octahedron or the\r\namphithect double pyramid (compare §§ 33 and 34, and p. 720). The\r\ncentroplanar ground-form is entirely wanting in the ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n49. _The Ground-Forms of the Nassellaria._--The NASSELLARIA all possess\r\nmonostatic ground-forms, inasmuch as by the very structure of their\r\nmonopylean central capsule a vertical main axis is necessitated, whose\r\nbasal pole occupies the porochora. The same arrangement is also for the\r\nmost part clearly recognisable in the corresponding structure of the\r\nskeleton, which is generally either centraxon or centroplanar. Among their\r\nmanifold skeletal forms different larger groups of ground-forms may be\r\nrecognised according as the vertical allopolar main axis is crossed by\r\ndifferentiated transverse axes or not (Stauraxonia or Monaxonia); the\r\nformer are either triradial or multiradial. The triradial, with three\r\nlateral or terminal radial apophyses, constitute the greater part of the\r\nNASSELLARIA, and have probably been derived originally from the triradial\r\n#Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Triplecta_); a more careful examination,\r\nhowever (especially with reference to the structure of the cortinar\r\nseptum), reveals the fact that the ground-form is not strictly regularly\r\npyramidal (with three equal radii), but amphipleural (with two paired\r\nventral and one unpaired dorsal radius), and that it usually passes over\r\ninto a distinctly zygopleural form. The same holds true of the multiradial\r\nNASSELLARIA, where for the most part three interradial or six adradial\r\n(sometimes more) apophyses are intercalated between the three primary\r\nperradial ones; sometimes here also the ground-form is a quite regular\r\nhexagonal or nonagonal pyramid, but usually it is more or less amphithect\r\nor amphipleural. Among the eradial NASSELLARIA, which have no radial\r\napophyses, the ground-form is sometimes allopolar monaxon (conical, ovoid,\r\nhemispherical, &c.), sometimes amphithect pyramidal (even in the simplest\r\nStephanida, _Archicircus_, &c.), or sometimes distinctly zygopleural or\r\nbilateral (many #Plectellaria#).\r\n\r\n\r\n50. _The Ground-Forms of the Phæodaria._--The PHÆODARIA agree with the\r\nNASSELLARIA in the possession of a primitively centraxon ground-form, and\r\nlike them are monostatic, since a vertical main axis whose basal pole\r\npasses through the astropyle is present, owing to the characteristic\r\nstructure of their cannopylean central capsule. In {xxiv}the great majority\r\nof PHÆODARIA the spheroidal central capsule also possesses a pair of\r\nparapylæ near the opposite apical pole of the main axis (Tripylea), and\r\nthese determine (as the right and left secondary openings) an isopolar\r\nfrontal axis. Hence, strictly speaking, in most PHÆODARIA the central\r\ncapsule has the geometrical ground-form of the amphithect pyramid (as in\r\nthe Ctenophora), with an allopolar vertical main axis, and two unequal, but\r\nisopolar, horizontal transverse axes. In many PHÆODARIA the skeleton also\r\nhas this amphithect pyramidal ground-form, _e.g._, the bivalved\r\n#Phæoconchia# and part of the #Phæogromia#. On the contrary, in the rest of\r\nthe PHÆODARIA the skeleton exhibits very various geometrical ground-forms,\r\nindependent of that of the central capsule. In the #Phæosphæria# it forms\r\npreferably spheres or endospherical polyhedra, as also in the Castanellida\r\nand Circoporida among the #Phæogromia#; among the Circoporida there are\r\nalso seen with remarkable distinctness the regular polyhedra (especially\r\nthe dodecahedron and icosahedron). Isopolar monaxonia are found among the\r\nAulosphærida (_Aulatractus_) and Orosphærida; allopolar monaxonia among the\r\nChallengerida (_Lithogromia_). The Medusettida and Tuscarorida show various\r\nforms of regular pyramids (allopolar Stauraxonia); and finally, the\r\nChallengerida are for the most part centroplanar or bilateral. Thus the\r\nPHÆODARIA present a great wealth of different geometrical ground-forms in\r\nthe development of their skeleton, not in that of their central capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--THE CENTRAL CAPSULE.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. _Components of the Central Capsule._--In all Radiolaria without\r\nexception, at some period of life or other, the central portion of the soft\r\nbody is separated from the peripheral portion by an independent,\r\nanatomically recognisable membrane; this membrane with all its contents is\r\ndesignated the central capsule, and is the peculiar central organ of the\r\nunicellular body, which distinguishes the Radiolaria most clearly from the\r\nother Rhizopoda. In the great majority of the Radiolaria the volume of the\r\ncentral capsule is less than that of the surrounding peripheral soft body\r\nwhich we place in opposition to it as \"extracapsulum.\" The\r\n\"capsule-membrane,\" which separates these two constituents, arises very\r\nearly in most Radiolaria, and persists throughout their whole life. In some\r\nspecies, however, the membrane only appears later, immediately before the\r\nformation of the spores, and hence is absent for a considerable period.\r\nRegarded as a whole, then, the capsule consists of the following\r\nparts:--(1) the capsule-membrane; (2) the enclosed endoplasm, or\r\nintracapsular protoplasm; (3) the nucleus. But in addition, many other\r\nnon-essential structures may be enclosed in the central capsule, especially\r\nhyaline spheres (vacuoles), fatty spheres, pigment granules, crystals, &c.\r\n\r\n  The central capsule was first described in my Monograph in 1862 (pp.\r\n  69-82) as the most characteristic component of the Radiolarian organism,\r\n  and distinguished from the whole extracapsular {xxv}soft body. The fact\r\n  that it has recently been reported as absent by various authors is due to\r\n  their having observed young or unripe specimens, before the formation of\r\n  the spores. In some species of #Polycyttaria# and ACANTHARIA the membrane\r\n  persists only a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. _The Primary Form of the Central Capsule._--The form of the central\r\ncapsule is originally a geometrical sphere; and if in accordance with our\r\nmonophyletic hypothesis all Radiolaria are to be derived from one common\r\nstem-form (_Actissa_, see p. 12), then the central capsule of this common\r\nstem-form must be regarded as perfectly spherical (_Procyttarium_, p. 13,\r\nPl. 1, fig. 1). Since, further, the enclosed nucleus and the surrounding\r\ncalymma of this primitive archaic form must also be spheres, and since the\r\nnucleus lies in the centre of the body, and the protoplasm is evenly\r\ndistributed between it and the membrane, it follows that no axes or\r\nexcentrically differentiated parts are to be distinguished in this most\r\nprimitive Radiolarian. Rather in the primary central capsule all parts are\r\nconcentrically and evenly arranged round its centre. This primary spherical\r\nform becomes modified in most Radiolaria into various secondary\r\nground-forms, which are correlated partly with the structure of the capsule\r\nitself, and partly also with the development of openings in its membrane.\r\nIn general the ground-form of the central capsule is polyaxon in the\r\nPorulosa (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA); but in the Osculosa centraxon forms\r\nare more frequently observed; in the NASSELLARIA the ovoid (allopolar\r\nmonaxon) form is predominant, and in the PHÆODARIA the rhomboid or\r\namphithect pyramid. In these latter, the astropyle indicates the basal pole\r\nof the vertical main axis, whilst the two parapylæ (right and left) mark\r\nthe poles of the frontal transverse axis. In the NASSELLARIA the centre of\r\nthe porochora corresponds with the basal pole of the main axis, whilst no\r\ntransverse axes are originally present.\r\n\r\n\r\n53. _The Secondary Forms of the Central Capsule._--The original purely\r\nspherical form of the central capsule persists only in the minority of the\r\nRadiolaria, namely, the greater part of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA; it\r\npasses over into various other secondary forms in the majority of the\r\nclass, in the whole of the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, and in a considerable\r\nportion of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA. These secondary or derived forms\r\nmay be divided into two quite distinct groups, which may be designated\r\nendometamorphic and exometamorphic; in the former the cause of the\r\ndivergence of the secondary form from the sphere lies in the internal\r\nstructure of the central capsule; in the latter it lies in the external\r\ninfluence exerted by the growth of the skeleton. Obviously the former\r\nseries of modifications is more significant than the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n54. _The Endometamorphic Forms of the Central Capsule._--The secondary\r\nforms of the central capsule, which are due to internal causes connected\r\nwith its growth, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  {xxvi}A. _The Ellipsoidal Central Capsule_, with one axis elongated, so\r\n  that it becomes the vertical main axis of the body.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Among the SPUMELLARIA, _Actiprunum_ (p. 14), _Colloprunum_ (p. 25,\r\n    Pl. 3, fig. 9), most #Prunoidea# (p. 288).\r\n\r\n    _b._ Among the ACANTHARIA, many Amphilonchida (p. 782, Pl. 132, figs.\r\n    2, 6), and Belonaspida (p. 861).\r\n\r\n    _c._ Among the NASSELLARIA, many #Plectoidea# (p. 905, Pl. 91, figs. 5,\r\n    9), #Stephoidea# (p. 937, Pl. 81, fig. 16), Monocyrtida (Pl. 51, fig.\r\n    3), &c.\r\n\r\n  B. _The Cylindrical Central Capsule_, with considerable elongation of the\r\n  vertical main axis, which is several times as long as the horizontal\r\n  transverse axis.\r\n\r\n    _a._  Amongst the SPUMELLARIA, _Collophidium_ (p. 26, Pl. 3, figs. 1-3)\r\n    and many #Prunoidea# (_Spongurus_, &c.).\r\n\r\n    _b._  Among the ACANTHARIA, some Amphilonchida.\r\n\r\n  C. _The Discoidal, Spheroidal, or Lenticular Central Capsule_, with one\r\n  axis shorter than the others, which becomes the vertical main axis.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Among the SPUMELLARIA, _Actidiscus_ (p. 15), _Collodiscus_ (p.\r\n    27), and the large group #Discoidea# (p. 408).\r\n\r\n    _b._ Among the ACANTHARIA, many Quadrilonchida (p. 768, Pl. 131), and\r\n    most Hexalaspida (p. 874).\r\n\r\n    _c._ Among the NASSELLARIA, certain #Stephoidea# and #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\n    _d._ Among the great legion PHÆODARIA the spheroidal central capsule is\r\n    almost always more or less flattened in the direction of the main axis\r\n    (p. 1525, Pls. 101-128).\r\n\r\n  D. _The Lentelliptical Central Capsule_ (or triaxial ellipsoid), with\r\n  three unequal but isopolar axes at right angles to each other, the\r\n  sections in all three dimensions of space being ellipses.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Among the SPUMELLARIA, _Actilarcus_ and the large group\r\n    #Larcoidea# (p. 604).\r\n\r\n    _b._ Among the ACANTHARIA, certain Amphilonchida and Belonaspida.\r\n\r\n  E. _The Polymorphic, Amoeboid or Irregular Central Capsule._\r\n\r\n    _a._ Among the SPUMELLARIA, _Collodastrum_ (p. 28, Pl. 3, figs. 4, 5),\r\n    and some #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n55. _The Exometamorphic Forms of the Central Capsule._--The secondary forms\r\nof the central capsule, which are brought about by external causes, chiefly\r\ndependent on the formation of the skeleton, are very various and in many\r\ncases devoid of special interest; in other instances, on the contrary, they\r\nare of great importance, because of the clear relation of cause and effect\r\nwhich can be traced between the development of the skeleton and of the\r\ncapsule. The most important phenomena to be recorded in this connection are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  {xxvii}I. SPUMELLARIA.--(A) In many of the #Sphæroidea#, the central\r\n  capsule of which is originally enclosed by a simple lattice-sphere, it\r\n  puts out protrusions through the meshes of the shell, thus forming\r\n  club-shaped processes, corresponding in number with the meshes of the\r\n  lattice (Pl. 11, figs. 1, 5; Pl. 20, fig. 1_a_; Pl. 27, fig. 3, &c.). The\r\n  whole surface of the spherical capsule may thus be covered with numerous\r\n  independent radial clubs of equal size, but usually they unite again\r\n  outside the shell to form a simple sphere with smooth surface. (B) In\r\n  many #Prunoidea# whose originally ellipsoidal body has become cylindrical\r\n  by the marked prolongation of the main axis, the central capsule is\r\n  divided by a series of constrictions into segments, which correspond with\r\n  the annular constrictions of the skeleton (Pls. 39, 40). (C) In most\r\n  #Discoidea# whose lentiform or discoidal shell develops radial arms at\r\n  its margin, the central capsule sends out processes into these arms, and\r\n  adapts itself to the stellate form of the skeleton (p. 409, Pl. 43, fig.\r\n  15; Pl. 47, &c.) (D) In many #Larcoidea# whose growth is originally\r\n  lentelliptical, but later spiral or irregular, the central capsule\r\n  follows the mode of growth and develops irregular protuberances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II. ACANTHARIA.--Whilst the central capsule of most ACANTHARIA retains\r\n  its primitive spherical form, in a minority of the group it passes over\r\n  into various secondary forms, which are directly determined by the growth\r\n  of the skeleton; especially common are lappet or club-shaped prominences\r\n  which follow the larger radial spines. Hence the central capsule may\r\n  assume the form of a violin, with two lobes corresponding to the two\r\n  poles of the elongated main axis, as in many Amphilonchida (p. 782, Pl.\r\n  132, fig. 10), and the Diploconida (p. 884, Pl. 140). On the other hand\r\n  the central capsule becomes cruciform, with four lobes disposed at right\r\n  angles, as in Lithoptera and other Quadrilonchida (p. 768, Pl. 131, fig.\r\n  10, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  III. NASSELLARIA.--The primitive ellipsoid or ovoid form of the central\r\n  capsule persists only in a few NASSELLARIA, such as the simplest and most\r\n  archaic forms, the Nassellida, many #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#,\r\n  Monocyrtida, &c. In the great majority of the NASSELLARIA, on the\r\n  contrary, the ellipsoid or ovoid form passes over into a secondary form\r\n  which is usually characterised by the presence of lobes, and is obviously\r\n  dependent upon the previous development of the skeleton. In many\r\n  #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea# (probably the majority), a bilobed central\r\n  capsule is formed (with symmetrically equal right and left lobes), since\r\n  the primary vertical sagittal ring interferes with the growth in the\r\n  median plane (Pl. 90, figs. 7-10). In other {xxviii}#Spyroidea#, on the\r\n  contrary, and the majority of the #Cyrtoidea#, the central capsule forms\r\n  at its basis rounded lobes, which protrude and hang down from the meshes\r\n  of the cortinar plate; and since this latter has usually three or four\r\n  large pores, the capsule similarly develops three or four processes (Pl.\r\n  53, fig. 19; Pl. 55, figs. 4-11; Pl. 59, figs. 4-13; Pl. 60, figs. 3-7;\r\n  Pl. 65, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n56. _The Membrane of the Central Capsule._--The capsule-membrane or\r\nenvelope of the central capsule is both morphologically and physiologically\r\none of the most important parts of the Radiolarian body, for it separates\r\nits two main constituents, the capsule with its nucleus and endoplasm and\r\nthe extracapsulum with the calymma and exoplasm. The capsule-membrane is\r\ninvariably present at some time or other during the life of the organism,\r\neven though in a few species it may persist only for a short time. It is\r\ncharacterised in general by its power of resistance to chemical and\r\nphysical reagents, and appears to be related to the elastic tissues or\r\nperhaps even more to the chitinous substances. Its thickness is usually\r\nless than 0.0001, though in certain groups it ranges between 0.001 and\r\n0.002, and in many of the larger Radiolaria (such as Collida and PHÆODARIA)\r\nit may attain a thickness of 0.003 to 0.006 or more. In the three legions\r\nSPUMELLARIA, ACANTHARIA, and NASSELLARIA the capsule-membrane is single,\r\nwhile in the PHÆODARIA it is always double, being composed of a firm outer\r\nand a delicate inner membrane, which are in contact at only few points.\r\nUsually it is quite structureless, except for its apertures; the thicker\r\nmembrane showing occasionally a fine concentric lamination. In certain\r\nlarge #Colloidea# (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla_, Pl. 1, fig. 5_b_) the membrane\r\nis covered on the inner surface by a network of polygonal ridges, and in\r\nsome large PHÆODARIA with remarkable small curved rods (Pl. 114, fig. 13).\r\nIn all Radiolaria the membrane is perforated by definite openings or pores,\r\nthrough which the intracapsular and extracapsular protoplasm are in direct\r\ncommunication. These openings (or \"pylae\") show very characteristic and\r\nconstant differences in the four legions, which have given rise to the\r\nnames--PERIPYLEA, ACTIPYLEA, MONOPYLEA, CANNOPYLEA.\r\n\r\n  The capsule-membrane was first indicated as the most important and\r\n  absolutely constant component of all Radiolaria, and as the differential\r\n  character of the class, in my Monograph (1862, pp. 69-71). The careful\r\n  investigations of R. Hertwig have confirmed this view and at the same\r\n  time have yielded the most important conclusions regarding the nature and\r\n  systematic significance of the openings in the capsule (_op. cit._, 1879,\r\n  pp. 105-107). On the contrary, Karl Brandt has recently propounded the\r\n  theory that the capsule-membrane is by no means a constant part of the\r\n  Radiolarian organism, but is lacking in certain species of _Collozoum_\r\n  and _Sphærozoum_ (1881, p. 392). This contradiction is explained by the\r\n  fact that in some #Collodaria# and #Acanthometra# the formation of the\r\n  central capsule takes place much later than in the other Radiolaria, in\r\n  some {xxix}species indeed only just prior to the development of the swarm\r\n  spores. I have recognised the presence of it in all species which I have\r\n  investigated (more than a thousand), and even in those in which Brandt\r\n  denies its existence. It is often very delicate and may easily be\r\n  overlooked, especially when the contents of the capsule are colourless,\r\n  but in all cases by the prudent application of staining fluids and other\r\n  reagents its presence may be demonstrated. Even in those cases in which\r\n  the contour of the capsule was not visible, and its contents appeared to\r\n  pass without definite boundary into the matrix of the extracapsulum, it\r\n  was possible by the use of appropriate stains or reagents, which would\r\n  not penetrate the capsule, or of those solvents which were capable of\r\n  dissolving its contents and of causing it to swell up like a distended\r\n  bladder, to recognise the existence of the membrane. Those Radiolaria in\r\n  which it is truly absent are young animals of species in which the\r\n  membrane is only formed immediately before sporification, and persists\r\n  but for a short time (_e.g._, species of _Collozoum_, _Sphærozoum_,\r\n  _Acanthometra_, _Acanthochiasma_, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n57. _The Capsule-Openings of the Peripylea (or Spumellaria)._--The\r\ncapsule-membrane of the PERIPYLEA is generally perforated by extremely fine\r\nand numerous pores, which are distributed at equal distances over the whole\r\nsurface, and are precisely alike in all parts of the capsule. Hence the\r\nSPUMELLARIA may be called \"Holotrypasta\" or \"Porulosa\"; they agree with the\r\nACTIPYLEA in being devoid of an osculum or operculum; they are\r\ndistinguished from the latter group mainly in that their pores are equally\r\ndistributed over the whole surface of the capsule, whilst in the ACTIPYLEA\r\nthe pores are disposed in definite groups or lines, separated by large\r\nimporous areas.\r\n\r\n  The central capsule of the SPUMELLARIA, with its innumerable fine and\r\n  evenly distributed pores, must be regarded as the primitive arrangement,\r\n  from which the different central capsules of the three other legions have\r\n  been developed. The central capsule of the ACTIPYLEA has been derived\r\n  from that of the PERIPYLEA by reduction in the number of the pores and\r\n  their distribution in definite, regularly disposed areas in the membrane.\r\n  The central capsule of the Osculosa is characterised by the formation of\r\n  a special main-aperture (osculum) at the basal pole, which is closed in\r\n  the MONOPYLEA by the porochora, and in the CANNOPYLEA by the astropyle;\r\n  the remaining pores, with the exception of the accessory openings of many\r\n  CANNOPYLEA, remain undeveloped in both these legions. In the same way\r\n  Hertwig regards the central capsule of the PERIPYLEA as the primitive\r\n  form (1879, L. N. 33, p. 107).\r\n\r\n\r\n58. _The Capsule-Openings of the Actipylea (or Acantharia)._--The\r\ncapsule-membrane of the ACTIPYLEA is perforated by very numerous fine\r\npores, which are regularly distributed over the surface of the central\r\ncapsule, and separated by imporous intervals. Hence the ACANTHARIA belong\r\nto the \"Holotrypasta\" or \"Porulosa\"; they have neither osculum nor\r\noperculum, and agree in this particular with the PERIPYLEA; but they are\r\nseparated from these latter chiefly by the fact that their pores are much\r\nless numerous, and marked off into regularly arranged groups or lines by\r\nimporous intervals. In the PERIPYLEA, on the contrary, the pores are much\r\nmore numerous and are evenly distributed over the whole surface of the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n  {xxx}The central capsule of the ACANTHARIA has hitherto been for the most\r\n  part confounded with that of the SPUMELLARIA, and no clear distinction\r\n  has been drawn in this respect between the two legions of the Porulosa.\r\n  Hertwig, who in 1879 first discovered the remarkably different structure\r\n  of the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA), recognised no distinction\r\n  between the structure of the capsules in the PERIPYLEA and ACTIPYLEA (his\r\n  Acanthometrea), and supposed that in both these legions \"very fine pores\r\n  were evenly distributed in large numbers over the capsule-membrane\"\r\n  (_loc. cit._, p. 106). I have, however, during the last few years\r\n  convinced myself, by the careful comparative investigation of numerous\r\n  ACANTHARIA, that in this respect they are quite distinct from the\r\n  SPUMELLARIA (with perhaps the exception of the Astrolophida, which are\r\n  nearly related to the primitive _Actissa_). The number of pores in the\r\n  ACTIPYLEA is usually very much smaller than in the PERIPYLEA, and they\r\n  are regularly arranged in groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n59. _The Capsule-Openings of the Monopylea (or Nassellaria.)_--The\r\ncapsule-membrane of the MONOPYLEA always possesses a single large\r\nmain-opening, an osculum, which lies at the basal pole of the main axis,\r\nand is closed by a circular perforated lid (operculum porosum). When seen\r\nfrom the surface this lid appears as a clearly defined porous area\r\n(porochora or area porosa), and forms the horizontal base of a peculiar\r\ncone, which stands vertically in the interior of the capsule and may be\r\ndesignated the \"thread-cone\" (podoconus). The NASSELLARIA may hence be\r\ntermed \"Merotrypasta\" or \"Osculosa,\" like the CANNOPYLEA; the structure and\r\nsignificance of the circular lid (operculum), which closes the main-opening\r\n(osculum) is, however, quite different in the two legions. Whilst the lid\r\nof the CANNOPYLEA (astropyle) is solid, traversed by radial ribs, and only\r\nperforated in its centre by a short tube (proboscis), in the MONOPYLEA the\r\noperculum (porochora) is always perforated by numerous vertical fine pores,\r\nand is in connection with the peculiar internal \"pseudopodial cone\"\r\n(podoconus, Pl. 51, figs. 5, 13; Pl. 81, fig. 16; Pl. 91, fig. 5; Pl. 98,\r\nfig. 13). The pores are separated by small vertical, highly refractive rods\r\n(opercular rhabdillæ); these become intensely stained by carmine, and are\r\neither evenly distributed over the surface of the porochora or arranged in\r\ndefinite groups. The outer or distal end of each rod is rounded, sometimes\r\nthickened like a club or split into lobes; the inner or proximal end is\r\nusually pointed, and stands in connection with a myophane thread of the\r\npodoconus (see § 79). The primary circular form of the porochora, in which\r\nthe opercular rhabdillæ are evenly distributed in a horizontal plane,\r\nundergoes various secondary modifications in many NASSELLARIA. The\r\ntriradial structure of the skeleton, which characterises the majority of\r\nthe legion, causes a splitting of the base of the central capsule into\r\nthree or four lobes; this division also affects the porochora, which lies\r\nin the centre of the base, so that the rhabdillæ become arranged in three\r\nor four equal circles. If, however, the lobes of the central capsule become\r\nlarger and protrude through the three or four collar pores of the cortinar\r\nseptum, the central porochora may separate entirely into three or four\r\nelongated tracts, which lie on the axial side of the magnified lobes; the\r\nrhabdillæ are then arranged over the whole surface of {xxxi}these tracts,\r\non the outer aspect of which run the longitudinal myophane fibrillæ of the\r\npodoconus (compare §§ 79 and 99).\r\n\r\n  The porous area of the MONOPYLEA was first described by Hertwig in 1879,\r\n  and shown to be the characteristic main-opening of the central capsule in\r\n  various families belonging to this legion (L. N. 33, pp. 71, 73, 83, 106,\r\n  Taf. vii., viii.). According to his view \"the capsule-membrane in the\r\n  porous area becomes thickened around each pore into a rod, perforated by\r\n  a canal,\" and the intracapsular protoplasm passes outwards through these\r\n  fine canals (_loc. cit._, p. 106). I am not able to share this\r\n  interpretation, but think rather that I have convinced myself by the\r\n  examination of some living NASSELLARIA, and of many well-stained and\r\n  preserved preparations in the Challenger collection, that the rods are\r\n  _solid_, specially modified portions of the capsular wall, and that the\r\n  protoplasm does not pass through them but through pores which lie between\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. _The Capsule-Openings of the Cannopylea (or Phæodaria)._--The\r\ncapsule-membrane of the CANNOPYLEA always possesses only a single large\r\nmain-opening or osculum, which lies at the basal pole of the vertical main\r\naxis, and is closed by a circular radiated lid (operculum radiatum). This\r\noperculum appears, when seen from the surface, as a sharply defined\r\nstellate area (astropyle), from the middle of which arises a shorter or\r\nlonger cylindrical tube, the proboscis. Hence the PHÆODARIA, like the\r\nMONOPYLEA, belong to the \"Merotrypasta\" or \"Osculosa\"; the structure and\r\nsignificance of the circular operculum, which closes the main-opening\r\n(osculum), are, however, quite different in the two legions. Whilst the\r\noperculum of the MONOPYLEA (porochora) is perforated by numerous fine\r\nvertical pores, and connected with the peculiar internal pseudopodial cone\r\n(podoconus), this structure is entirely wanting in the CANNOPYLEA, and\r\ninstead of it there is a solid operculum, with radial ribs which originate\r\nat the base of its central tubular mouth; this tube (proboscis) is\r\ncylindrical, often conical at the base, of very variable length and with a\r\nround aperture at either end. In spite of the great difference which the\r\nvarious families of CANNOPYLEA exhibit in the formation of their skeleton\r\nand its appendages, the constitution of this characteristic stellate\r\nmain-opening (astropyle) is always essentially the same; both the stellate\r\noperculum itself, and the proboscis which rises from its centre, show only\r\nslight differences in the various groups. In addition to this large\r\nmain-opening most PHÆODARIA possess several small accessory openings\r\n(parapylæ); and usually two of these are present, placed symmetrically\r\nright and left of the aboral pole of the main axis and in the frontal plane\r\n(Pl. 101, figs. 2, 6, 10; Pl. 104, figs. 1, 2_a_). Sometimes there are more\r\nnumerous accessory openings (three to six or more) regularly arranged, as\r\nin the two peculiar families, Circoporida and Tuscarorida; occasionally\r\nalso there is only a single parapyle, at the aboral pole of the main axis\r\n(_e.g._, in _Tuscaridium_). The parapylæ seem to be quite absent in the\r\nfamilies Challengerida, Medusettida, Castanellida, and perhaps also in\r\nother PHÆODARIA. The form and structure of the small accessory openings\r\nappear to be always the same. The {xxxii}outer capsule-membrane is elevated\r\nin the form of a short cylindrical tube or \"apertural ring\" (collare\r\nparaboscidis), the external margin of which bends inwards, and at the base\r\nof the ring passes over into the delicate internal capsule membrane. Upon\r\nthis apertural ring is situated a longer or shorter \"apertural cone\"\r\n(paraboscis), which is a tubular, cylindrical or conical, prolongation of\r\nthe membrane, open externally.\r\n\r\n  The peculiar capsule-openings of the PHÆODARIA were first discovered and\r\n  carefully described by Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33, pp. 95, 107). He found\r\n  in all the six genera which he examined _three_ openings, a main-opening\r\n  at the basal pole of the main axis and two accessory openings, one on\r\n  either side of the apical pole; hence he named the whole group\r\n  \"TRIPYLEA.\" This name, however, is not applicable to the numerous\r\n  PHÆODARIA mentioned above, which have only a main opening without any\r\n  accessory openings, nor to those genera in which the number of the latter\r\n  is variable. I have, therefore, replaced Hertwig's designation by the\r\n  term \"CANNOPYLEA,\" which has reference to the peculiar tubular form of\r\n  the opening. This I find much more developed in many PHÆODARIA than\r\n  Hertwig has represented, and I must also, in certain particulars, dissent\r\n  from his delineation of the minute structure, although this is in the\r\n  main remarkably accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. _The Nucleus._--The nucleus, enclosed in the central capsule of all\r\nRadiolaria, behaves in every respect like a true cell-nucleus, and thus\r\nlies at the base of the now universal opinion, that the whole Radiolarian\r\norganism, in spite of its varied development and remarkable variations, is\r\nunicellular and remains throughout life a true individual cell. This\r\nimportant theory is not invalidated by the fact that the nucleus undergoes\r\npeculiar modifications in many groups, and in certain groups presents\r\nappearances seldom or never seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n62. _Uninuclear and Multinuclear Radiolaria (Monocaryotic and\r\nPolycaryotic)._--All Radiolaria present two different conditions in respect\r\nof the behaviour of the nucleus, since in their young stages they are\r\nuninuclear (_monocaryotic_), and in later stages multinuclear\r\n(_polycaryotic_). This is readily explained by the fact that each\r\nindividual Radiolarian is developed from a simple unicellular swarm-spore,\r\nand that afterwards, before the formation of swarm-spores, the single\r\nnucleus divides into many small nuclei. Thus in the Radiolaria the nucleus\r\nis pre-eminently the _organ of reproduction and inheritance_. The division\r\nof the originally single nucleus into many small nuclei may take place,\r\nhowever, at very different periods, so that the Radiolaria may be divided\r\nin this respect into precocious and serotinous.\r\n\r\n\r\n63. _Serotinous and Precocious Radiolaria._--In the great majority of the\r\nRadiolaria the division of the nucleus takes place only at a late period, a\r\nshort time or even immediately before the process of spore formation; it\r\nthen breaks up rapidly into numerous small nuclei (always more than one\r\nhundred, sometimes many thousands), and each of these {xxxiii}either\r\nbecomes itself the nucleus of a swarm-spore, or by repeated division gives\r\nrise to a group of spore-nuclei. All those Radiolaria which are uninuclear\r\nduring the greater part of their existence, and in which the process of\r\ndivision is late, and takes place rapidly, are called \"serotinous\" or\r\nlate-dividing forms. To this category belong all PHÆODARIA and NASSELLARIA,\r\nas well as all the solitary or monozoic SPUMELLARIA and some ACANTHARIA. On\r\nthe other hand, the name \"precocious,\" or early dividing, is applied to\r\nthose Radiolaria in which the division of the nucleus takes place very\r\nearly, and in which, therefore, the cell is multinuclear during the greater\r\npart of its existence. This is the case in all the social or polyzootic\r\nRadiolaria (Polycyttaria, Pls. 3-8), and also in the great majority of the\r\nACANTHARIA, both #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta#. In the last two\r\ngroups, however, there are numerous exceptions, and these are seen in\r\nremarkably large species, characterised by the great size of the central\r\ncapsule. From a phylogenetic point of view, the conclusion is allowable\r\nthat the precocious forms are secondary, and have arisen by adaptive\r\nmodification from the primitive serotinous stem. In the Polycyttaria (or\r\nsocial SPUMELLARIA, _i.e._, the three families Collozoida, Sphærozoida, and\r\nCollosphærida), the cause of the adaptation lies most probably in the\r\nformation of the colony itself, for all these three families are so closely\r\nrelated to three corresponding families of serotinous, monozootic\r\nRadiolaria (Thalassicollida, Thalassosphærida, Ethmosphærida), that certain\r\nspecies of the latter are hardly to be distinguished from isolated\r\nindividuals of the former. Perhaps the remarkable formation of the large\r\ncentral oil-globule, which particularly characterises the Polycyttaria, is\r\nthe prime cause of their early nuclear division. In the ACANTHARIA the\r\ncause is most likely to be found in the characteristic _centrogenous\r\ndevelopment_ of their acanthin skeleton, whose radial bars first of all\r\nappear in the centre of the capsule. Hence arises directly the excentric\r\nposition of the nucleus, which in the archaic stem of ACANTHARIA\r\n(_Actissa?_) was probably central. In any case, but little weight is to be\r\nlaid upon the precocious division of the nucleus in the ACANTHARIA in\r\ngeneral, inasmuch as in certain species (both #Acanthometra# and\r\n#Acanthophracta#) the more usual serotinous division persists.\r\n\r\n\r\n64. _Central and Excentric Nuclei._--The position of the nucleus in the\r\ninterior of the central capsule was no doubt primitively central, and this\r\nsituation in the geometrical centre of the original spherical central\r\ncapsule has been accurately retained in all monozootic SPUMELLARIA; in the\r\npolyzootic families of this legion (Polycyttaria), on the contrary, it is\r\nobscured by the precocious division of the nucleus. In the other three\r\nlegions, which may be phylogenetically derived from the SPUMELLARIA, the\r\nposition of the nucleus is rarely central, but usually excentric, or at\r\nmost subcentral. In the ACANTHARIA (both #Acanthometra# and\r\n#Acanthophracta#) the central position of the nucleus is at once excluded\r\nby the constantly centrogenous development of the skeleton; the nucleus is\r\ntherefore always excentric, and may lie at either side; it usually\r\n{xxxiv}divides very early into numerous separate nuclei, which are usually\r\ndistributed in the peripheral portions of the central capsule. In the\r\nNASSELLARIA the development of the porochora, and of the podoconus which\r\nstands upon it, brings about the formation of a vertical axis, and in\r\nconsequence the central capsule assumes a monaxon form (usually ovoid or\r\nconical); the nucleus then lies in the main axis, but excentrically between\r\nthe apex of the podoconus and the aboral pole. In many NASSELLARIA,\r\nhowever, especially when the podoconus is so large that its apex approaches\r\nthe aboral pole of the central capsule, the nucleus is pressed to one side\r\nand lies quite excentrically. The PHÆODARIA exhibit a different\r\narrangement; the large spheroidal nucleus is always subcentral, so that its\r\nmain axis corresponds with that of the concentric spheroidal central\r\ncapsule; but since the astropyle always occupies the oral pole of the\r\nlatter, and since the distance of the nucleus from this pole is always\r\nsomewhat different from its distance from the other, it follows that,\r\nstrictly speaking, the nucleus never lies accurately in the geometrical\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n65. _Homogeneous and Allogeneous Nuclei._--The nucleus of the Radiolaria\r\nnot only exhibits a similar structure and composition, and suffers similar\r\nmodifications to those which are found to occur in the case of other\r\ncell-nuclei, but also to some extent shows very peculiar developmental\r\nforms, which are seldom or never found in other cells. In the first place\r\nthe nuclei may be divided into homogeneous and allogeneous, the former are\r\nstructureless and consist of a uniform mass of nuclein, whilst the latter\r\nare composed of different substances and show various structural relations.\r\n_Homogeneous_ nuclei, whose whole mass is uniform and exhibits no\r\nstructural differentiation, are probably always to be found in the\r\nswarm-spores; in the fully developed Radiolarian body they are found only\r\nin the first legion, SPUMELLARIA, and that both in many Monozoa (especially\r\nsmall #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea#) and in the Polyzoa (or Polycyttaria).\r\nThe whole mass of these homogeneous nuclei, which are usually spherical or\r\nellipsoidal, consists of uniform, perfectly clear and transparent nuclein,\r\nand becomes evenly stained by carmine, hæmatoxyline, &c.  They may be\r\nreadily distinguished by these means from the clear vacuoles or \"hyaline\r\nvesicles,\" which are evenly distributed in the endoplasm of many\r\nRadiolaria, and may be confused with the former. _Allogeneous_ nuclei,\r\nwhich are always composed of different parts and often show complicated\r\nstructural relations, are found developed in the great majority of\r\nRadiolaria. The most important differentiation exhibited by these secondary\r\nforms is the separation of the nuclear mass into a firm nuclear substance\r\n(caryoplasm) and a fluid nuclear juice (caryolymph). In addition in each\r\nnucleus a nucleolus is visible, and often several or many may be seen (see\r\n§§ 67 to 70).\r\n\r\n\r\n66. _The Form of the Nucleus._--The nucleus of the Radiolaria shows greater\r\nvariations in form and structure than are to be found in the majority of\r\ncell-nuclei; {xxxv}exception must, however, be made in the case of many\r\nanimal ovicells, which, in their peculiar form and composition, often\r\nrecall large Radiolarian nuclei. With respect to the external shape two\r\nmain forms may be distinguished, as primary and secondary. The _primary\r\nform_ of the Radiolarian nucleus is the sphere; it occurs not only in most\r\nswarm-spores, but also in most adult forms belonging to the legion\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and in individual instances in other groups; indeed the nuclei\r\nof most SPUMELLARIA, as also the concentric central capsules in which they\r\nlie, are true geometrical spheres. The _secondary forms_ of the nucleus are\r\nfound in the majority of adult Radiolaria, and arise from the primary\r\nspherical forms in various ways, either by the elongation or contraction of\r\none axis, or by the formation of apophyses or processes. The most important\r\nof these secondary forms are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Ellipsoidal nuclei_, arising by elongation of one principal axis;\r\n  very common among the NASSELLARIA, as well as in many #Prunoidea# and\r\n  #Larcoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA; also in several ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n  2. _Discoidal nuclei_, arising by contraction of one principal axis,\r\n  sometimes lenticular or spheroidal, biconvex, sometimes shaped like a\r\n  disc or coin; especially common in the #Discoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA,\r\n  also in some ACANTHARIA; the large nucleus of the PHÆODARIA is always\r\n  spheroidal or almost spherical, with a slightly shortened main axis.\r\n\r\n  3. _Stellate nuclei_, spherical, and armed with evenly distributed radial\r\n  club-shaped or conical processes; rare but very characteristic,\r\n  especially in the two large Thalassicollida _Thalassopila_ (Pl. 1, fig.\r\n  3), and _Thalassophysa_ (Monogr. d. Radiol., Taf. i.); also in some\r\n  #Sphærellaria# (Pl. 11, fig. 5).\r\n\r\n  4. _Amoeboid nuclei_, with unequal processes irregularly arranged, in\r\n  certain irregular forms of SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n  5. _Lobate nuclei_, with several (usually two or three) large ovoid or\r\n  pyriform lobes, which protrude into corresponding larger lobes of the\r\n  central capsule, in many NASSELLARIA, especially the multiarticulate\r\n  #Cyrtoidea# (Pl. 59, figs. 12, 13). The budding nucleus of the ACANTHARIA\r\n  is also lobate (Pl. 129, figs. 6-11).\r\n\r\n\r\n67. _The Nucleus of the Peripylea._--The nucleus of the SPUMELLARIA or\r\nPERIPYLEA shows in certain groups a very primitive arrangement, indeed the\r\narchaic structure from which the various forms of nuclei of other\r\nRadiolaria may be derived; but on the other hand, in other groups it\r\nexhibits very peculiar and remarkable differentiations. In the first place\r\nit may be noted that the monozootic or solitary SPUMELLARIA usually possess\r\na single serotinous nucleus, which only divides into numerous swarm-spores\r\nat a late period; {xxxvi}whilst, on the contrary, the polyzootic colonial\r\nSPUMELLARIA (or Polycyttaria) are uninuclear only in the young state (Pl.\r\n3, fig. 12), and speedily present numerous small homogeneous nuclei, which\r\nhave arisen by precocious division of a single nucleus; these are usually\r\nspherical and 0.008 to 0.012 mm. in diameter. The serotinous nucleus of the\r\nmonozootic SPUMELLARIA, in many divisions of this large legion, and\r\nespecially in the simply constituted #Sphæroidea#, is a homogeneous sphere\r\nof nuclein, lying in the middle of the central capsule. In many other cases\r\nit assumes the form of a spherical vesicle (\"Binnen-Bläschen\"), whose fluid\r\nor semi-fluid contents are enclosed by a more or less firm membrane. This\r\nvesicle often contains a single central spherical _nucleolus_ (Pl. 1, figs.\r\n1_l_, 4_l_), but sometimes a variable number of small excentric nucleoli\r\n(Pl. 1, figs. 1_a_, 2_a_). The nuclear membrane is often somewhat thick,\r\npresenting a double contour, and in such cases may even exhibit a fine\r\nradial striation, the expression of minute pores (Pl. 1, fig. 2_a_). In the\r\ncolossal nuclei (as much as 1 to 2 mm. in diameter) of certain large\r\nThalassicollida the nucleolus presents a very remarkable form, becoming\r\nstellate by the protrusion of processes, which may again branch in a\r\ndendritic fashion (as in the common _Thalassicolla nucleata_), or it may\r\ndevelop into a very long cylindrical thread, which is disposed in\r\nserpentine coils, and in _Thalassophysa pelagica_ passes into the different\r\ncæcal processes of the stellate nucleus. In many #Sphæroidea#, whose\r\nskeleton is composed of numerous concentric lattice spheres, the small\r\ncentral spherical nucleus lies at first within the innermost of these (the\r\nmedullary shell); but afterwards it grows through the meshes of the\r\nlattice-work, and the radiating club-shaped processes thus formed (Pl. 11,\r\nfig. 5) unite with each other outside the medullary shell, and form an\r\nexternal nuclear sphere which completely encloses the latter. In the\r\nPolysphærida (with several concentric lattice-shells) and in the\r\nSpongosphærida (with spongy lattice-spheres), this process may be several\r\ntimes repeated, so that eventually the central spherical nucleus attains\r\nconsiderable dimensions, and encloses two or more concentric lattice-shells\r\nwith their radial connecting rods. The nuclear membrane is in these cases\r\nusually penetrated by radial bars, which connect the outermost of the\r\nenclosed shells with the remaining cortical shells which surround the\r\ncentral capsule. The same remarkable arrangement is also very common among\r\nthe #Discoidea#. The small spherical primary nucleus is in such instances\r\nimmediately surrounded by the innermost earliest developed lattice-shell,\r\naround which the concentric rings are subsequently deposited; it then grows\r\nout through the meshes, and the processes fuse outside the ring to form a\r\nhomogeneous lentiform nucleus (Pl. 43, fig. 15). The same process recurs in\r\ncertain #Prunoidea# and #Larcoidea#, whilst in other SPUMELLARIA of these\r\ngroups (_e.g._, Pylonida) the lobate processes of the nucleus remain free.\r\n\r\n  Both the simple serotinous nucleus of the monozootic SPUMELLARIA, and the\r\n  numerous precocious nuclei of the Polycyttaria, were first described in\r\n  my Monograph in 1862, the former as the \"endocyst\" (\"Binnen-Bläschen\"),\r\n  the latter as \"spherical transparent vesicles\" (\"Kugelige\r\n  {xxxvii}wasserhelle Bläschen\"). I was in error, however, in regarding the\r\n  latter as identical with the so-called \"hyaline spherules\" in the central\r\n  capsule of many Monozoa, which rather belong to the category of\r\n  intracapsular vacuoles (see § 72). The credit of recognising, by the aid\r\n  of the modern methods of staining, the distinctness of these two\r\n  structures, which may readily be mistaken for each other, and of\r\n  demonstrating the true nature both of the serotinous and precocious\r\n  nuclei, belongs to Richard Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n68. _The Nucleus of the Actipylea._--The nucleus of the ACANTHARIA or\r\nACTIPYLEA shows very peculiar relations in respect of structure and\r\ndivision, particularly special forms of lobular budding, which belong to\r\nthe characteristic peculiarities of this singular legion, and are not found\r\namong other Radiolaria. The position of the nucleus is _always excentric_,\r\neven in the youngest ACANTHARIA, for the centrogeneous formation of the\r\nskeleton, the constant development of the earliest radial portions of it in\r\nthe middle of the central capsule, forces the nucleus from its normal\r\ncentral position. The majority of the ACANTHARIA, like most Polycyttaria,\r\nare precocious, the primary nucleus early dividing into numerous small\r\nnuclei (see note A below). Nevertheless there are many exceptions to this\r\nrule in different families, _e.g._, _Stauracantha_, _Xiphacantha_,\r\n_Phatnacantha_, and _Pristacantha_ among the #Acanthometra#, and\r\n_Stauraspis_, _Echinaspis_, _Dodecaspis_, and _Phatnaspis_ among the\r\n#Acanthophracta#. In these instances the primary nucleus remains for a long\r\ntime as a simple excentric ellipsoidal or irregularly round body, even in\r\nthe fully developed stage, and only at a very late period (sometimes just\r\nbefore the formation of the spores) divides into many small nuclei. Since\r\nthis serotinous division of the nucleus takes place in different genera of\r\nvery various groups, it can only be decided by further investigations how\r\nwidely it is spread among the ACANTHARIA, and upon what circumstances it is\r\ndependent (see note B). The division of the nucleus appears to be\r\nprecocious in the majority of this legion, and a number of small nuclei\r\nappear to be early formed by a peculiar process of budding; in most fully\r\ndeveloped ACANTHARIA these are disposed in one or two layers under the\r\nsurface of the central capsule, but if their numbers increase to any\r\nconsiderable extent, the whole space between the skeletal rods becomes\r\nfilled with small nuclei; sometimes these are homogeneous, sometimes\r\nvesicular, 0.002 to 0.012 mm. in diameter; usually they are spherical and\r\nhave a small nucleolus (compare Pl. 129, figs. 6-11, and note C).\r\n\r\n  A.  The numerous nuclei, which are to be found in the central capsule of\r\n  most mature ACANTHARIA, were first described in my Monograph (1862) as\r\n  \"spherical, transparent vesicles, provided with a small dark granule\" (p.\r\n  374, Taf. xv. figs. 2, 5; Taf. xvi. figs. 2, 4; Taf. xxi. fig. 7, &c.).\r\n  Their more minute constitution and peculiar origin were first accurately\r\n  delineated by R. Hertwig (1879, _loc. cit._, pp. 11-24, Taf. i-iii.).\r\n\r\n  B. The fact that in a number of ACANTHARIA the nucleus does not divide\r\n  early as in the majority of the legion, but only at a later period, was\r\n  first observed by R. Hertwig in a species of #Acanthometra# (_Xiphacantha\r\n  serrata_), and a species of #Acanthophracta# (_Phatnaspis\r\n  {xxxviii}mülleri_ = _Haliommatidium mülleri_) (_loc. cit._, pp. 11 and\r\n  27). This serotinous division of the nucleus seems, however, to be rather\r\n  widely spread in both sublegions of the ACANTHARIA; I have found, not\r\n  only in the forms above mentioned, but also in several others belonging\r\n  to different genera, a single large excentric nucleus, even in those\r\n  individuals in which the skeleton was fully developed.\r\n\r\n  C. The peculiar mode of nuclear budding, by which these small nuclei\r\n  arise, appears to proceed in the following manner (Pl. 129). The\r\n  vesicular primary nucleus, which, in consequence of the centrogeneous\r\n  development of the skeleton protrudes as it grows into irregular lobes\r\n  (Pl. 129, fig. 9), assumes a peculiar concavo-convex form, sometimes that\r\n  of a hood or dish, sometimes that of a kidney or sausage. The convex\r\n  surface is apposed to the capsule-membrane, while the concave is turned\r\n  towards the central star of the skeleton (fig. 6). There is now formed at\r\n  the centre of the convex surface of the strong, doubly-contoured, nuclear\r\n  membrane, a flask-shaped invagination with a narrow neck and expanded\r\n  base; the membrane now becomes disposed in peculiar folds, which at the\r\n  narrow aperture of invagination appear as folds, but on the expanded body\r\n  of the flask take the form of concentric rings, laid closely side by side\r\n  (Pl. 129, fig. 10). The convex bottom of the flask, which is directed\r\n  towards the concave proximal side of the nucleus, becomes again\r\n  invaginated by a central conical apophysis of the enlarged nucleolus,\r\n  which is situated between them. Usually the nucleolus has already become\r\n  flattened into a lentiform shape, and upon its distal face a conical\r\n  apophysis has been developed, which is divisible into a darker proximal\r\n  and clearer distal portion. The tip of the latter appears to be in direct\r\n  connection with the nuclear membrane at the centre of the base of the\r\n  flask-shaped invagination (figs. 6, 10). At this stage of development the\r\n  nucleus of the ACANTHARIA generally presents the characteristic form of a\r\n  hood-shaped, concavo-convex vesicle, whose radial axis is also the axis\r\n  of the flask-shaped distal invagination, and of the depressed conical\r\n  nucleolus, which lies between the latter and the concave side of the\r\n  nucleus.  After this peculiar invagination has persisted for some time in\r\n  connection with the enlarged nucleolus, both disappear, and then a\r\n  remarkable growth of lobular processes takes place on the concave\r\n  proximal side of the hood or kidney-shaped nucleus; from four to eight\r\n  knobs of unequal size usually appear, and their thickened wall encloses a\r\n  variable number of small of nucleoli; these are at first few but\r\n  afterwards more numerous (fig. 7). Subsequently these knobs or lobes\r\n  become completely separated by constriction from the original central\r\n  mass of the nucleus, and appear as so many separate independent\r\n  \"sausage-shaped bodies\" in the hollow central capsule (fig. 8). Each of\r\n  the bodies now appears, and at first on its convex aspect, to form a\r\n  large number of small nucleoli, which either separate by constriction\r\n  from it or become free by its breaking up and lie in numbers in the\r\n  central capsule. Finally the buds or lobes of the nucleus break up\r\n  entirely into such nucleoli, which are evenly distributed in the central\r\n  capsule, and become the nuclei of the swarm-spores (fig. 11). Compare R.\r\n  Hertwig, L. N. 33, Taf. i.-iii. pp. 19-25.\r\n\r\n\r\n69. _The Nucleus of the Monopylea._--The nucleus of the mature forms of the\r\nNASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA is generally simple or lobate, homogeneous or\r\nvesicular and _excentric_, and appears only to divide into numerous small\r\nnuclei just before the formation of the spores. Nevertheless I have\r\nsometimes, though not often, seen in representatives of very various\r\nfamilies of the MONOPYLEA, the central capsule filled with many small\r\nspherical homogeneous nuclei (Pl. 53, fig. 19). Hence all the families of\r\nthis legion appear to be serotinous, their simple primitive nucleus\r\npersisting for a long period. It {xxxix}is commonly placed excentrically,\r\nand most usually in the apical or aboral portion of the central capsule,\r\neither between its apex and the podoconus, or quite excentrically on the\r\ndorsal aspect. The simple nucleus of the NASSELLARIA usually appears to be\r\nvesicular and to possess a somewhat firm membrane, clear contents, and a\r\nrather large, dark coloured nucleolus. In many NASSELLARIA the nucleus is\r\nspherical or ellipsoidal (Pl. 53, fig. 11); whilst in many #Stephoidea# and\r\n#Spyroidea#, where the central capsule is constricted by the sagittal ring\r\nand divided into two symmetrical lateral lobes, the nucleus partakes of the\r\nsame mode of growth and appears in the middle of the capsule as a\r\ntransversely placed ellipsoid or even as a short cylinder (Pl. 90, figs. 7,\r\n9). The most remarkable modification in the form of the nucleus is to be\r\nfound in the multi-articulate #Cyrtoidea#. Here it is usually enclosed in\r\nthe cephalis and is spherical, ellipsoidal or spheroidal, often flattened\r\nalmost into a disc. If now the central capsule increase greatly in size and\r\nput forth three or four clavate lobes which hang down through the pores of\r\nthe cortinar septum into the thorax (or even into the succeeding joints),\r\nthe nucleus usually undergoes similar modification, and three or four\r\nfinger-like apophyses are developed from its base, which project into the\r\ncorresponding lobes of the central capsule (Pl. 59, figs. 4, 12, 13).\r\n\r\n  The numerous small, spherical, homogeneous nuclei which are to be found\r\n  in the central capsules of those NASSELLARIA, which are ripe and about to\r\n  develop spores, were described in 1862 in my Monograph, as \"numerous,\r\n  small, transparent, spherical cells\" in the case of various #Cyrtoidea#\r\n  (_Arachnocorys_, _Lithomelissa_, _Eucecryphalus_, _Eucyrtidium_, &c.)\r\n  (_loc. cit._, pp. 302, 305, 309, 321, &c.), and I find them of the same\r\n  form and dimensions, but deeply stained with carmine in many preparations\r\n  in the Challenger collection. R. Hertwig has delineated them very\r\n  accurately in the case of _Tridictyopus_ (1879, _loc. cit._, p. 84, Taf.\r\n  vii. fig. 3). He was also the first to recognise the uninucleate\r\n  condition of the NASSELLARIA, which is much more frequently observed than\r\n  the serotinous multinucleate condition, and he described very clearly the\r\n  peculiar lobed nuclei which arise in #Cyrtoidea#, owing to the protrusion\r\n  of the nucleus through the cortinar septum (_loc. cit._, p. 85, Taf.\r\n  viii. figs. 3-8).\r\n\r\n\r\n70. _The Nucleus of the Cannopylea._--The nucleus presents the same\r\nremarkable structures in all species of the PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA which\r\nhave been examined, and closely resembles the germinal vesicle of an\r\namphibian ovum, being a large spherical or spheroidal vesicle with numerous\r\nnucleoli. Its diameter usually amounts to half or two-thirds, sometimes\r\neven three-quarters, that of the central capsule. The vertical main axis of\r\nthe latter is also that of the nucleus, which usually lies somewhat nearer\r\nto the aboral pole. The nucleus is generally rather more strongly\r\ncompressed in the direction of the main axis than the capsule itself. The\r\nmembrane of the vesicular nucleus is thin, but firm, and encloses a clear\r\nor finely granular mass of nuclein. The number and size of the contained\r\nnucleoli are variable even in one and the same species, and stand in\r\ninverse ratio to each other, an obvious result of the gradual process of\r\ndivision. Commonly {xl}from twenty to fifty roundish or spherical, strongly\r\nrefracting nucleoli, are present; more rarely there are several hundred\r\nvery small ones.  Sometimes the nucleus is penetrated by fine trabeculæ, in\r\nwhose meshes lie the nucleoli (Pl. 101, fig. 2). In certain nuclei, which\r\ncontained a few large nucleoli, these were of irregular form, probably the\r\nresult of amoeboid movements (Pl. 101, fig. 1). In the formation of spores\r\nin the CANNOPYLEA, the nucleus apparently becomes dissolved, and its\r\nnumerous nucleoli develop directly into the nuclei or mother-nuclei, which\r\nproduce the nuclei of the flagellate spores. Furthermore, many PHÆODARIA\r\nseem to multiply by simple cell-division, since very commonly (especially\r\nin the #Phæocystina# and #Phæoconchia#) two large nuclei (right and left),\r\nmay be met with in one central capsule; sometimes also a single large\r\nnucleus, in which a sagittal constriction marks the commencing division of\r\nthe capsule (Pl. 101, figs. 2, 36; Pl. 104, fig. 3; Pl. 124, fig. 6, &c.).\r\n\r\n  The large nucleus of the PHÆODARIA was first described in my Monograph in\r\n  1862, in the case of _Aulacantha_ (p. 263), _Aulosphæra_ (p. 359), and\r\n  _Coelodendrum_ (p. 361), as a \"large, spherical, thin-walled endocyst,\"\r\n  from 0.1 to 0.2 mm. in diameter. More detailed descriptions, especially\r\n  with respect to the behaviour of the nucleoli were given by R. Hertwig in\r\n  1879 (L. N. 33, p. 97).\r\n\r\n\r\n71. _The Endoplasm or Intracapsular Protoplasm._--In all Radiolaria the\r\nintracapsular protoplasm, which, for the sake of brevity, may be termed\r\n\"endoplasm,\" constitutes originally, and especially in the earliest stages,\r\nthe only important content of the central capsule, except the nucleus. In\r\ncertain SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, of simple structure and of small\r\ndimensions, this condition persists for a long period, and the endoplasm\r\nthen appears as a homogeneous, colourless, turbid or finely granular,\r\nmucous, semi-solid mass, which cannot be distinguished from the ordinary\r\nundifferentiated protoplasm of young cells; no definite structure, and in\r\nparticular, no fibrillar network, can be discovered in it even by the use\r\nof the customary reagents. In the great majority of the Radiolaria,\r\nhowever, this primitive homogeneous condition of the endoplasm is very\r\ntransient, and it soon undergoes definite modifications, becoming\r\ndifferentiated into separate parts or producing new constituent contents.\r\nSuch products of the internal protoplasm are in particular hyaline spheres\r\n(vacuoles and alveoles), oil-globules, pigment-bodies, crystals, &c. The\r\nmost important of the differentiations which take place in the endoplasm is\r\nthat into an internal, granular, _medullary_ substance and an external,\r\nfibrillar, _cortical_ substance; although the various legions behave\r\nsomewhat differently in this respect (§§ 77-80).\r\n\r\n\r\n72. _Intracapsular Hyaline Spheres._--The central capsule of very many\r\nRadiolaria contains in its endoplasm numerous spherical bodies of varying\r\nsize, which consist of watery or albuminous fluid, and have previously been\r\nregarded as nuclei, or described as products of the internal protoplasm,\r\nunder various names, such as \"spherical transparent {xli}vesicles\" (see\r\nnote A, below), \"albumen spheres\" (see B), \"gelatinous spheres\" (see C),\r\n\"alveolar cells\" (see D), &c. Some of these spheres are perfectly\r\ntransparent, structureless and of varying refractive power, producing the\r\nimpression of drops of fluid; others contain various formed constituents,\r\nsuch as oil-globules, fat-granules, pigment-granules, concretions,\r\ncrystals, &c. From a morphological point of view they may all be divided\r\ninto two categories, membraneless vacuoles and vesicular alveoles.  The\r\n_vacuoles_ are simple spherical drops of fluid or of gelatinous material,\r\ndevoid of a special envelope, but immediately surrounded by the endoplasm.\r\nThe _alveoles_, on the other hand, are true vesicles with a thin spherical\r\nenvelope, enclosing a drop of fluid or jelly. This envelope is commonly\r\nvery thin, homogeneous, and often scarcely discernible, so that in practice\r\na sharp line of demarcation cannot be drawn between alveoles and vacuoles;\r\nthe former are usually somewhat larger than the latter. The fact is,\r\nnevertheless, certain that the hyaline spheres, which may be isolated on\r\nrupturing the central capsule of many Radiolaria, in certain cases,\r\nparticularly in large species, possess a clear, anatomically demonstrable\r\nmembrane, whilst in others no such appearance is presented.  It may be\r\nassumed that the vesicular alveoles are developed from the drop-like\r\nvacuoles by increase in size, and by the precipitation of a delicate\r\nenvelope from the endoplasm. The character common to all these hyaline\r\nspheres, whether vacuoles or alveoles, is found in their aqueous, not\r\nadipose, constitution, and in their clear transparent appearance, which\r\nallows of no structure (the above-mentioned contained bodies excepted)\r\nbeing recognised. Their refractive power and consistency vary somewhat, and\r\nprobably their chemical constitution still more. Sometimes they are\r\nstrongly refractive and shining, and sometimes feebly refractive and pale;\r\ntheir consistency shows all intermediate stages between a thin fluid, which\r\nreadily disappears in water, and a firm, insoluble jelly. As regards their\r\nchemical composition (which is probably very variable), the hyaline spheres\r\nmay be best divided into two groups, the organic and inorganic. The\r\n_inorganic hyaline spheres_ are simple drops of saline solution without any\r\ncarbonaceous constituent; the _organic_, on the other hand, contain a small\r\nquantity of organic matter dissolved in the watery fluid, and may be either\r\nalbuminous or gelatinous spheres.  The formed contents which are commonly\r\npresent are of very various natures, usually small fat-granules, more\r\nrarely larger fat-granules or pigment-granules, sometimes concretions or\r\ncrystals. In many groups, especially among the large PHÆODARIA and\r\n#Collodaria#, the numerous hyaline spheres are remarkable for their equal\r\nsize and even distribution throughout the endoplasm (Pl. 1, figs. 1, 4; Pl.\r\n104, fig. 2, &c.). In some genera belonging to the Thalassicollida the\r\nalveoles are of enormous size (Pl. 1,  figs. 2, 3); they then become\r\nflattened by mutual pressure into polyhedra and distend the central capsule\r\nto unusual dimensions (in _Physematium_ and _Thalassolampe_ 8 to 12 mm.).\r\n\r\n  A. The \"_spherical hyaline vesicles_,\"  which I described in my Monograph\r\n  (1862, p. 71) as among the most important and constant contents of the\r\n  central capsule, are partly vacuoles, {xlii}partly homogeneous nuclei.\r\n  Most recent investigators, Bütschli in particular (1882, L. N. 41), have\r\n  pointed out and rightly criticised this confusion. The criticism might,\r\n  however, have been more justly expressed by stating that, in the\r\n  preparation of my Monograph (1859-1862), I did not make use of modern\r\n  methods of demonstrating the nucleus by staining fluids, which were quite\r\n  unknown at the time, and only discovered a decade later. In fact, without\r\n  the aid of such reagents, it is quite impossible to distinguish between\r\n  the various \"spherical transparent vesicles,\" of which those found in the\r\n  central capsule of the PHÆODARIA and many monozootic #Collodaria# are\r\n  simple vacuoles lying in the endoplasm, whilst, on the other hand, those\r\n  of the Polycyttaria and many other Radiolaria are true homogeneous\r\n  nuclei. For not only are the general appearance of the small clear\r\n  spheres, their refractive power, and regular distribution in the\r\n  endoplasm quite similar, but they are also of much the same size, for the\r\n  diameter ranges from 0.005 to 0.015 mm., being generally between 0.008\r\n  and 0.012 mm. In addition to this there is generally in each hyaline\r\n  sphere a dark brightly shining granule, which, in the case of the\r\n  vacuole, is simply a fat-granule, whilst in the case of the nucleus, it\r\n  is a true nucleolus. The small hyaline spheres in the young uninucleate\r\n  capsules of the Polycyttaria are simple vacuoles (Pl. 3, fig. 12), whilst\r\n  in the ripe multinucleate capsules they are true nuclei (Pl. 3, figs. 3,\r\n  8, 9), and it is quite impossible to discriminate between these two\r\n  conditions without the use of reagents. This has been expressly\r\n  recognised by R. Hertwig, who has the merit of having been the first to\r\n  clearly distinguish, by the aid of staining fluids, between these two\r\n  different constituents (1879, L. N. 33, p. 108).\r\n\r\n  B. The \"_albumen spheres_,\" which were first observed by A. Schneider in\r\n  1858 in the common cosmopolitan _Thalassicolla nucleata_ (L. N. 13, p.\r\n  40), and which appear to occur in only a few other Thalassicollida, are\r\n  distinguished from the ordinary hyaline spheres of about the same size by\r\n  their higher refractive power and by certain albuminoid reactions,\r\n  especially the coagulation of a membranous envelope under the influence\r\n  of certain reagents (see my Monograph, p. 250, and Hertwig, L. N. 26,\r\n  1876, p. 46). They often enclose various formed contents, and require\r\n  further investigation.\r\n\r\n  C. The _gelatinous spheres_ of various sizes, found in the endoplasm of\r\n  the Radiolaria, agree in their reactions (especially in staining by\r\n  certain reagents) with the common extracapsular jelly of the calymma, and\r\n  are hence distinguishable both from the true (coagulable) \"albumen\r\n  sphere,\" and from the ordinary watery vacuoles.\r\n\r\n  D. The _alveoles_, which are only accurately known in the case of certain\r\n  large monozootic #Collodaria#, but which also seem to occur in the\r\n  central capsule of other remarkably large Radiolaria, were described in\r\n  my Monograph in the case of _Thalassolampe margarodes_ and _Physematium\r\n  mülleri_, under the name \"intracapsular alveolar cells\" (1862, pp. 77,\r\n  254, 257). They are not, however, true nucleated cells, and the body\r\n  described as a nucleus is not such in reality. Nevertheless these large\r\n  hyaline spheres do possess a special envelope, as I have recently\r\n  convinced myself by the examination of ruptured central capsules of\r\n  _Thalassolampe maxima_, _Thalassopila cladococcus_, and _Physematium\r\n  atlanticum_ (Pl. 1, figs. 2, 3). The central capsule of these\r\n  #Collodaria# becomes distended to most unusual dimensions (2 to 12 mm. in\r\n  diameter) by the great development of these large hyaline vesicles, each\r\n  of which measure from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. _The Intracapsular Fat-Globules._--Fat is present in the central\r\ncapsule of all Radiolaria in larger or smaller quantities, and generally\r\nappears in the form of very {xliii}numerous, small, spherical granules,\r\nwhich are either distributed evenly in the endoplasm (as an emulsion) or\r\nenclosed in the vacuoles; the latter, in particular, is the case in most\r\nPHÆODARIA, perhaps generally. In this group each vacuole contains as a rule\r\na single dark, shining fat-granule, and sometimes also an irregular bunch\r\ncomposed of from two to five or more granules. In addition to these small\r\nfat-granules (_granula adiposa_) which are always present, the central\r\ncapsule of many Radiolaria contains also larger fat-globules (_globuli\r\nadiposi_). These appear to be generally wanting in the PHÆODARIA, and are\r\non the whole rare in the ACANTHARIA; whilst, on the contrary, they are very\r\ncommon in the NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA. The Polycyttaria or social\r\nRadiolaria are as a rule distinguished by the possession of a single large\r\ncentral oil-globule, which lies in the centre of the central capsule, and\r\nis on an average about one-third of it in diameter (Pl. 3, figs. 4, 5).\r\nThis is absent, however, in those young capsules of the Polycyttaria in\r\nwhich the primary nucleus is centrally situated (Pl. 3, fig. 12). Those\r\nspecies of Polycyttaria whose central capsule reaches a considerable size,\r\noften enclose numerous oil-globules, and in _Collophidium_ (species of\r\n_Collozoum_ with an elongated cylindrical capsule, Pl. 3, figs. 1, 3) the\r\naxis of each capsule is occupied by a row of numerous oil-globules.  In the\r\nmonozootic SPUMELLARIA, in which the nucleus is always centrally situated,\r\nthe large oil-globules are, of course, excentric, being in apposition to\r\nthe inner surface of the capsule-membrane (Pl. 1, fig. 3; Pl. 2, figs. 2,\r\n5). In the #Discoidea# the oil-globules, which are often present in large\r\nnumbers, form elegant concentric rings around the central nucleus, and in\r\nthose species with segmented arms, there are one or more transverse rows in\r\neach segment (Pl. 43, fig. 15). In the NASSELLARIA the number and\r\ndistribution of the oil-globules are dependent upon the form of the central\r\ncapsule. When this is simple, without lobes, and ovoid or conical, they\r\ngenerally lie in its aboral half above the podoconus (Pl. 51, figs. 5, 13;\r\nPl. 97, fig. 1). When, on the contrary, the basal portion of the capsule\r\nsends out three or four dependent processes (as in the majority of the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#), a large globule may generally be seen in the swollen distal\r\npart of each conical or ovoid lobe (Pl. 53, fig. 19; Pl. 60, figs. 4-7). In\r\nmany #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea#, whose central capsule is separated into\r\ntwo lateral portions by the constriction corresponding to the sagittal\r\nring, each of these contains either a single large globule or a group of\r\nsmall ones (Pl. 90, figs. 7, 10). These oil-globules are usually colourless\r\nand highly refractive; rarely they are yellow or brown, sometimes\r\nrose-coloured, or an intense blood-red (_e.g._, in _Thalassophysa\r\nsanguinolenta_) or even orange (in _Physematium mülleri_). In many\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and particularly in the Polycyttaria, an albuminous substratum\r\nmay be recognised in them, which is sometimes disposed in layers, and after\r\nextraction of the fat presents the appearance of a laminated sphere. The\r\nphysiological significance of the oil-globules is twofold; in the first\r\nplace they tend to diminish the specific gravity of the organism; in the\r\nsecond they may be utilised as a reserve store {xliv}of nutriment. In the\r\nlatter respect they are of special importance in the process of\r\nspore-formation, each flagellate spore usually containing a fat-granule.\r\n\r\n\r\n74. _The Intracapsular Pigment-Bodies._--In the majority of Radiolaria when\r\nobserved alive, the central capsule is coloured, only in the minority is it\r\ncolourless.  The colour is never diffuse, but always due to the formation\r\nof definite pigment granules or vesicles, which are sometimes distributed\r\nevenly throughout the endoplasm, sometimes aggregated in the central or\r\nperipheral regions.  Their form may be either spherical, irregularly\r\nrounded, or polyhedral.  They vary much in dimensions, but in most cases\r\nare immeasurably small, and appear under a high magnifying power as fine\r\ndust; occasionally, however, their diameter may amount to from 0.001 to\r\n0.005 or more. The chemical constitution of the intracapsular pigment is\r\nunknown in most Radiolaria, and is probably very various. In many instances\r\nthe pigment-granules consist of fat, in others not.  The commonest colours\r\nare yellow, red, and brown; violet and blue are rare, and green still\r\nrarer. Sometimes a definite tone of colour prevails throughout a whole\r\ngroup, and may then be attributed to inheritance, _e.g._, red is found in\r\nmost #Sphæroidea#, and blue in the Polycyttaria (see note A). One colour is\r\nalmost always constant in the members of the same species. True\r\npigment-cells, belonging to the Radiolarian organism, do not occur within\r\nthe central capsule. The peculiar yellow cells which are found in the\r\ncentral capsule of many ACANTHARIA are symbiotic xanthellæ (see § 76).\r\n\r\n  A. The number of Radiolaria whose pigment has been examined in the living\r\n  state, is too small to allow of any general conclusions being drawn.\r\n  Regarding the different colours known, see my Monograph, L. N. 16, p. 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n75. _The Intracapsular Crystals._--The crystals found in the central\r\ncapsule of many Radiolaria may be divided into two groups, of very\r\ndifferent significance; small crystals, which are very widely distributed,\r\nand large crystals, which occur in only a few genera. The _small crystals_\r\nmay also be termed \"spore-crystals,\" since each swarm-spore often contains\r\nsuch a crystal. They are rod-like or spindle-shaped, and consist of an\r\norganic substance which probably serves as a reserve of nutriment for the\r\ndeveloping spores. Such spore-crystals have been observed in numerous\r\nSPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA belonging to various families, and are probably\r\npresent throughout the two legions which make up the Porulosa. On the other\r\nhand, they have not been noticed in the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and\r\nPHÆODARIA), the few swarm-spores belonging to these groups which have been\r\nobserved not exhibiting any crystals. The _large crystals_, which occur in\r\nsmall numbers in the endoplasm, have hitherto only been observed in a few\r\nspecies of SPUMELLARIA, belonging to the Polycyttaria. They were first\r\nnoticed in the common _Collosphæra huxleyi_, and regarded as coelestin.\r\nThey are also found in the central capsule of many other Collosphærida,\r\n_e.g._, _Buccinosphæra_ (Pl. 5, figs. 11, 12). Crystal-masses,\r\ncrystal-sheaves, or spherical masses of radiating acicular crystals are\r\nenclosed in {xlv}the vacuoles or \"albumen globules\" of _Thalassicola\r\nnucleata_ and other Thalassicollida, as well as in the central capsule of\r\n_Coelographis_ and some other PHÆODARIA (Pl. 127, figs. 4-7). All these\r\nlarge crystals are probably to be regarded as excretory products.\r\n\r\n\r\n75A. _The Intracapsular Concrements._--Concretions, either mineral or\r\norganic, of varying form and constitution, are to be found in the endoplasm\r\nof Radiolaria belonging to very different families. They are most abundant\r\nand multiform in _Thalassicolla nucleata_, being usually circular or\r\nelliptical discs, which are concentrically laminated and highly refractive,\r\nresembling starch-grains. Among them twin forms may frequently be observed,\r\nas though the concrements were in process of division (see note A). Similar\r\namyloid concretions are to be seen in the central capsule of different\r\nSPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, _e.g._, in _Cephalospyris triangulata_ (Pl.\r\n96, fig. 28). Violin-shaped, highly refractive concrements have been\r\nobserved in the central capsule of numerous SPUMELLARIA, NASSELLARIA, and\r\nACANTHARIA, _e.g._, _Thalassosphæra_, _Spongosphæra_, _Plegmosphæra_,\r\n_Cyrtocalpis_, _Peripyramis_, _Botryocella_, &c. (see note B). The chemical\r\nconstitution of these concrements is insufficiently known.\r\n\r\n  A. The amyloid concretions of _Thalassicolla nucleata_ have been\r\n  described in detail in my Monograph (pp. 80, 250, Taf. iii. figs. 2, 3),\r\n  and by R. Hertwig in the Histologie der Radiolarien (1876, p. 47, Taf.\r\n  iii. figs. 9-13).\r\n\r\n  B. The violin-shaped concretions of _Thalassosphæra bifurca_ have been\r\n  figured in my Monograph (pp. 80, 261, Taf. xii. fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n76. _The Intracapsular Xanthellæ._--The xanthellæ, zooxanthellæ, or\r\nsymbiotic \"yellow cells\" are found within the central capsule only in the\r\nACANTHARIA, whilst in other Radiolaria they only occur in the\r\nextracapsulum. They are most frequent in the #Acanthometra#, rarer in the\r\n#Acanthophracta#, but even in the former they are often wanting. Their\r\nnumber is very variable, but usually small, from ten to thirty in one\r\ncapsule. They lie for the most part immediately below the capsule membrane,\r\nin the cortical layer of the endoplasm. The form of the yellow cells is\r\neither spherical or ellipsoidal, often also spheroidal or even lentiform.\r\nThe diameter varies from 0.01 to 0.03 mm. They possess a distinct membrane\r\nand an excentric nucleus, and contain numerous yellow pigment-granules in\r\nthe endoplasm. This yellow pigment dissolves in mineral acids to form a\r\ngreen fluid, and in other respects also behaves somewhat differently from\r\nthe yellow pigment in the extracapsular yellow cells of the SPUMELLARIA and\r\nNASSELLARIA. In both cases, however, the xanthellæ are not integral\r\nportions of the organism, but unicellular algae, living as parasites or\r\nsymbiontes in the body.\r\n\r\n  A. The yellow cells in the central capsule of the ACANTHARIA were first\r\n  observed by Joh. Müller (L. N. 12, pp. 14, 47). In my Monograph I\r\n  described them at greater length, and indicated their differences from\r\n  the extracapsular yellow cells of other Radiolaria (L. N. 16, pp. 77,\r\n  86). Since then, R. Hertwig has demonstrated their cellular nature (L. N.\r\n  33, pp. 12, 113), and still more recently {xlvi}Brandt has given further\r\n  accurate information regarding their occurrence, constitution, and\r\n  physiological significance (L. N. 39, ii. Art., p. 235, figs. 62-73).\r\n\r\n\r\n77. _The Endoplasm of the Peripylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA is usually distinguished by a more or less\r\ncomplete radial arrangement, which does not occur in the same form in other\r\nRadiolaria; it may be regarded as characteristic of this legion, for it\r\nprobably occurs in all the species at some period of life or other, and\r\nstands in a direct causal relationship with the typical structure of the\r\ncapsule-membrane in all the \"PERIPYLEA\" (see note A). For as this is\r\ncommonly perforated by very numerous pores distributed at equal intervals\r\nover the whole surface of the capsule, and since a communication between\r\nthe intra- and extracapsular sarcode takes place through these, the radiate\r\nstructure of the endoplasm may be readily explained as due to the influence\r\nof radial currents which take place continuously or intermittently in the\r\nendoplasm. This radiate structure is most obvious when the endoplasm\r\ncontains no secondary products or only an insignificant amount of these,\r\nand thus appears colourless and almost homogeneous, or only finely\r\ngranular. Under these circumstances, an optical section of the central\r\ncapsule usually reveals a distinct radial striation; numerous narrow,\r\nstraight, dark streaks alternating regularly with still narrower clear\r\nones; the latter consist of homogeneous, the former of more or less\r\ngranular protoplasm (Pl. 20, fig. 1_a_). Often there may be distinguished\r\nin each darker streak a single straight row of strongly refracting (fat?)\r\ngranules, sometimes several such rows. Occasionally the whole endoplasm\r\nbecomes divided up into a number of large \"radial wedges,\" club-shaped,\r\nconical or pyramidal masses of granular protoplasm, separated by clear\r\ndivisions of hyaline plasma (_e.g._, in _Actissa radiata_, p. 14, where in\r\nthe optical section of the central capsule, between the membrane and the\r\nnucleus, twenty-five dark radial wedges of equal size were separated by\r\nthick clear partitions of hyaline protoplasm). In the majority of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA this radial striation is partially or entirely concealed by the\r\nformation of pigment or of other products. Very often it is only visible in\r\nthe cortical layer, which lies immediately below the capsule-membrane (Pl.\r\n1, figs. 1, 3). The remarkable \"centripetal cones\" which characterise the\r\nThalassicollid genus _Physematium_, and were formerly described as\r\n\"centripetal cell-groups,\" are probably a special development of these\r\ncortical radial wedges; they are conical cortical bodies, regularly\r\ndistributed on the inner surface of the membrane of the central capsule,\r\nand disposed with the apex turned towards the centre (see note B). More\r\nrarely than in the cortical layer, a similar radial structure is to be\r\nfound in the innermost medullary layer immediately surrounding the nucleus.\r\nHere the endoplasm sometimes breaks up into fine radial threads, which are\r\nanatomically separable and hang down from the free nucleus as thin\r\nprocesses (see note C). In some cases it is also possible to isolate radial\r\nrods from the cortical layer of teased out central capsules.\r\n\r\n  {xlvii}A. The radial structure of the endoplasm was first described in my\r\n  Monograph (1862, p. 74), though R. Hertwig (1879, p. 112) was the first\r\n  to indicate its typical significance in the case of the PERIPYLEA, and to\r\n  demonstrate its causal relation with the radial currents in the central\r\n  capsule of this legion. More recent investigations have led me to the\r\n  conviction that this phenomenon is more widespread, and often more\r\n  strongly developed, than was formerly imagined, and that it is probably\r\n  one of the typical characters of all SPUMELLARIA (at least of the\r\n  Monozoa).\r\n\r\n  B. The centripetal cones of _Physematium_, which have hitherto been known\r\n  only in these colossal Thalassosphærida, were fully described in my\r\n  Monograph under the name \"conical centripetal cell-groups\"; by their\r\n  first discoverer, A. Schneider (L. N. 13), they were termed \"nests,\" and\r\n  compared with the \"nests\" (central capsules) of the Polycyttaria. In the\r\n  _Physematium mülleri_ of the Mediterranean (hitherto only observed by\r\n  Schneider and myself at Messina) it appeared as though each centripetal\r\n  cone were composed of a group of from three to nine (usually four or\r\n  five) slender wedge-shaped cells, whose common centripetal apex was\r\n  produced into a radial thread of sarcode (L. N. 16, p. 258, Taf. iii.\r\n  fig. 7). Since then (1866) I have observed at Lanzerote, in the Canary\r\n  Islands, a nearly related form, which I take to be _Physematium\r\n  atlanticum_, Meyen.  In this, however, the \"centripetal cell-groups\" were\r\n  wanting, and the whole cortical layer of the endoplasm was cleft into\r\n  numerous radial portions, each enclosing a nucleus (probably the\r\n  mother-cells of flagellate spores, see p. 35).\r\n\r\n  C. The radial fibres of the medullary endoplasm which cling to an\r\n  extracted nucleus have been observed by Hertwig in certain #Sphæroidea#\r\n  (_Diplosphæra_, _Arachnosphæra_) (L. N. 33, p. 40).\r\n\r\n\r\n78. _The Endoplasm of the Actipylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA is often distinguished by a partial or complete\r\nradial arrangement like that of the PERIPYLEA, but differing in the number,\r\nsize, form, and distribution of the radial portions into which the\r\nendoplasm is differentiated. For since the pores of the capsule membrane\r\nare distributed at equal distances all over the surface in the SPUMELLARIA,\r\nwhilst in the ACANTHARIA they are arranged in definite groups, and since\r\nthe number and arrangement of the pores has a direct influence upon the\r\ninternal currents of the endoplasm, it follows that the radial structure in\r\nthe latter legion must be very different from that in the former. In\r\naddition to this there must not be forgotten the important influence which\r\nthe early centrogenous formation of the skeletal rods exercises upon the\r\ndisposition and growth of the intracapsular structures. Hence the endoplasm\r\nof the ACANTHARIA does not separate into innumerable thin, closely packed\r\nradial wedges or cortical radial rods, but into a small number of large\r\npyramidal portions between which run the radially disposed heterogeneous\r\nportions of the contents of the capsule, viz., the radial bars of acanthin\r\nand the peculiar intracapsular \"axial threads.\" As a direct consequence of\r\nthe regular disposition of these heterogeneous radial portions, which is\r\noften characteristic of the various families of the ACANTHARIA, a\r\ncorresponding differentiation of the endoplasm is brought about; it divides\r\ninto a number of conical or pyramidal portions (radial pyramids), whose\r\nbases rest upon the capsule-membrane and whose apices are directed towards\r\nthe centre of {xlviii}the capsule (the central star of the skeleton).\r\nThese radial pyramids are, however, but rarely visible, being usually more\r\nor less concealed by a dark pigment.\r\n\r\n  The differentiations of the endoplasm in the central capsule of the\r\n  ACTIPYLEA have been but little investigated, but they appear to vary\r\n  somewhat in the different groups of this legion. In all ACANTHARIA in\r\n  which the twenty radial bars are regularly arranged according to the\r\n  Müllerian law (see p. 717) and in which axial threads constant in number\r\n  and disposition run between them from the central star to the\r\n  capsule-membrane, it obviously follows that the endoplasm must be divided\r\n  into more or less distinct radial pyramids, and this must the case\r\n  whether these take the form of continuous tracts or of actually separable\r\n  portions. The regular polygonal figures, often seen on the surface of the\r\n  central capsule (with special distinctness in _Acanthometron elasticum_\r\n  and _Acanthometron pellucidum_) separated by a network of granular\r\n  threads, are the bases of such radial pyramids (see Hertwig, L. N. 43, p.\r\n  12, Taf. i. figs. 1-7).\r\n\r\n\r\n79. _The Endoplasm  of the Monopylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nNASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA is distinguished from that of any of the other\r\nthree legions by the development of a quite peculiar fibrillar structure,\r\nthe axial \"pseudopodial cone,\" which may shortly be termed the \"podoconus\"\r\n(foot-cone). Since this is in direct correlation with the peculiar\r\nstructure of the capsular opening, the large \"porochora,\" which is situated\r\nat the basal pole of the main axis, it is quite as characteristic of the\r\nlegion as the latter itself (see note A). The podoconus is primitively a\r\nvertical regular cone whose circular base occupies the horizontal porochora\r\nor \"basal porous area\" of the central capsule, while its vertical axis\r\ncoincides with that of the latter. The apex of the cone, usually somewhat\r\nrounded off, is therefore directed towards the aboral or apical pole of the\r\ncentral capsule and separated from it by a larger or smaller interval. In\r\nthis interval the nucleus originally lies (as in Pl. 51, fig. 13; Pl. 98,\r\nfig. 13); but it is usually displaced subsequently and lies excentrically.\r\nThe cone is of very variable height; on an average its vertical height is\r\nabout equal to the diameter of its horizontal base; these dimensions are,\r\nhowever, dependent upon the form of the central capsule; the height being\r\ngreater in slender ovoid or conical capsules, and less in depressed\r\nsphæroidal or discoidal ones, than the diameter of the base. The podoconus\r\nconsists of differentiated endoplasm, which becomes more deeply stained by\r\ncarmine and offers greater resistance to solvents than the surrounding\r\nfinely granular protoplasm. The apex, especially, becomes very intensely\r\nstained. It always exhibits a very characteristic fine but distinct\r\nstriation, numerous straight radial lines diverging from the apex of the\r\ncone towards the base. The number of these striæ appears to correspond with\r\nthat of the vertical rods in the porochora, and each of these latter stands\r\napparently in direct communication with the basal end of an apical stria (§\r\n59). These threads are probably differentiated constant contractile threads\r\nof endoplasm, or even myophanes, comparable with the contractile cortical\r\nthreads of the CANNOPYLEA and the permanent axial threads of the ACTIPYLEA.\r\n The numerous modifications, {xlix}undergone by the form and contents of\r\nthe central capsule in the different groups of MONOPYLEA, especially those\r\ndue to the formation of the skeleton, are not without influence upon the\r\npodoconus. The most important divergencies from the above described primary\r\nform are the following:--(1) The vertical axial cone becomes oblique, its\r\naxis inclining in the sagittal plane and approaching either the dorsal or\r\nthe ventral wall of the capsule; the cause of this appears to be usually\r\nthe excentric development of the growing nucleus or the formation of a\r\nlarge oil-globule. (2) The smooth mantle of the podoconus becomes divided\r\nby three longitudinal furrows into three equal prominent ridges, which\r\ncorrespond to three circular lobes in the porochora; the cause of this\r\nbasal triradial lobular formation lies probably in the triradial\r\ndevelopment of the skeleton in many NASSELLARIA or in the cortinar\r\nstructure of the collar septum. (3) The simple podoconus splits into three\r\nor four elongated lobes, which eventually become almost completely\r\nseparated and correspond to the lobes of the central capsule, in the axial\r\nwall of which they lie as longitudinally striated bands. The behaviour of\r\nthese bands justifies the hypothesis that the podoconus is a muscular\r\ndifferentiated portion of the endoplasm and is composed of myophane\r\nfibrillæ, whose contraction determines the opening of the central capsule.\r\n\r\n  A. The podoconus of the MONOPYLEA was first described by R. Hertwig in\r\n  1879, and recognised as a characteristic component of the central capsule\r\n  in the most various groups of this legion (in #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#,\r\n  #Spyroidea#, and #Cyrtoidea#; see his figures, _loc. cit._, Taf. vii.,\r\n  viii., and the description, pp. 71, 73, 83, 106). Hertwig called it the\r\n  \"pseudopodial cone,\" and regarded it as a conical process of the\r\n  capsule-membrane, which is developed from this latter and projects from\r\n  the porous area into the interior of the central capsule; \"it is\r\n  penetrated by fine canals which arise at the apex of the cone, diverge\r\n  towards the base, and terminate there in the rods of the pseudopodial\r\n  area. The intracapsular protoplasm penetrates at the apex of the\r\n  pseudopodial cone into its fine canals, runs along them and emerges from\r\n  the rods of the porous area in the form of slender threads\" (_loc. cit._,\r\n  p. 19). I cannot agree with this view of Hertwig, although I have been\r\n  able to confirm the accuracy of his description by my own observations\r\n  upon numerous excellently stained and preserved preparations in the\r\n  Challenger collection. As I have proved by numerous teased out\r\n  preparations, and as Hertwig himself correctly states, \"the cone is more\r\n  readily detached from the membrane than from the protoplasm, when the\r\n  capsule is teased\" (_loc. cit._, p. 73). Hence I regard the podoconus not\r\n  as a differentiated portion of the capsule-membrane but as endoplasm, and\r\n  believe that it is composed of myophanes or \"contractile muscular\r\n  fibrils\" in the same manner as the cortical layer of the CANNOPYLEA.\r\n  Probably the contraction of these fibrils serves to raise the opercular\r\n  rods and hence to allow the exit of the endoplasm through the pores which\r\n  lie between these opercular rhabdillae (compare § 59).\r\n\r\n\r\n80. _The Endoplasm of the Cannopylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nPHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is distinguished from that of the other three\r\nlegions by several characteristic peculiarities, which are very important,\r\nsince they stand in causal relation to the typical structure of the\r\ncapsule-membrane and in particular of its {l}remarkable aperture. In the\r\ncase of many and perhaps of all PHÆODARIA the endoplasm is differentiated\r\ninto a granular medullary and a thin fibrillar cortical layer, the former\r\nof which usually encloses numerous small vacuoles, while the latter\r\ncontains muscular fibrillæ. In the voluminous central capsule of large\r\nPHÆODARIA the whole cortical layer of the endoplasm, which lies immediately\r\nbelow the delicate inner capsule-membrane, sometimes appears delicately and\r\nregularly striated, and most distinctly so under the apertures, towards the\r\ncentre of each of which the dark striæ are radially directed (see note A,\r\nbelow). These striæ are probably contractile muscular fibrillæ; or\r\n\"myophanes,\" by whose contraction the openings are voluntarily widened. In\r\nthe Tripylea this fibrillar star is much more strongly developed under the\r\nastropyle (the main opening) than under the parapylæ (or accessory\r\nopenings); and probably the peculiar radial structure of the operculum of\r\nthe former is due to the stronger development of these radial fibrils\r\n(being their impression). In many PHÆODARIA, indeed, the fine myophane\r\nfibrils are only visible under the apertures, whilst in others they form a\r\ncontinuous fibrillar cortical layer on the whole inner surface of the inner\r\ncapsule-membrane; the fine fibrillæ run meridionally from one pole of the\r\nmain axis to the other; perhaps the whole central capsule may change its\r\nform in consequence of their contractions. The medullary portion of the\r\nendoplasm, which lies below this thin cortical layer, is usually finely\r\ngranular in the PHÆODARIA, and permeated by numerous spherical vacuoles,\r\nwhich are noteworthy from their equal size and regular distribution. Each\r\nclear vacuole usually contains a dark shining fat-granule, more rarely a\r\ngroup of such granules (see note B). Compare § 60, and Pl. 101, figs. 1-3;\r\nPl. 104, figs. 1, 2; Pl. 111, fig. 2; Pl. 128, fig. 2, &c.\r\n\r\n  A. The fine fibrillæ in the cortical layer of the endoplasm were first\r\n  described by Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33, p. 98, Taf x. figs. 6-10). He\r\n  found them, however, only below the three openings in the capsule of the\r\n  Tripylea, where they form three stellate groups of fibrils. I find them\r\n  very clearly shown, and with especial distinctness, under the astropyle\r\n  in most PHÆODARIA of which I have had the opportunity of examining\r\n  well-stained and preserved central capsules. In many cases, also, the\r\n  striation is not confined to the apertures, but spreads over the whole\r\n  cortical layer. Perhaps this constitutes in all PHÆODARIA a thin\r\n  myophane-sheet, whose contractile fibrils run from one pole of the main\r\n  axis to the other and cause by their contraction changes in the form of\r\n  the spheroidal central capsule.\r\n\r\n  B. The granular medullary portion of the endoplasm of the PHÆODARIA, with\r\n  its numerous clear spherical vacuoles, was first described in my\r\n  Monograph (1862), in the case of _Aulacantha_ (p. 263), _Aulosphæra_ (p.\r\n  359), and _Coelodendrum_ (p. 361) as a \"finely granular, mucous substance\r\n  (intracapsular sarcode), packed more or less closely with clear spherical\r\n  vesicles from 0.005 to 0.015 mm. in diameter, each of which contains one\r\n  or two, rarely three, dark shining granules.\" That these clear spheres\r\n  are true vacuoles was first clearly proved by Hertwig (L. N. 33, p. 98).\r\n  As a rule all the vacuoles of the same central capsule are of equal size\r\n  (generally from 0.008 to 0.012 mm. in diameter), and are distributed at\r\n  equal intervals throughout the finely granular endoplasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{li}CHAPTER III.--THE EXTRACAPSULUM.\r\n\r\n(§§ 81-100).\r\n\r\n81. _The Components of the Extracapsulum._--The extracapsulum or\r\nextracapsular malacoma, under which name are included all those parts of\r\nthe soft body which lie outside the central capsule, consists of the\r\nfollowing constant, and important constituents:--(1) The _calymma_ or\r\nextracapsular jelly-veil; (2) the _sarcomatrix_ or layer of exoplasm\r\nimmediately surrounding the membrane of the central capsule; (3) the\r\n_sarcodictyum_ or network of exoplasm, covering the surface of the calymma;\r\n(4) the _pseudopodia_ or radial fibres of exoplasm, which may again be\r\nsubdivided into intracalymmar pseudopodia, uniting the sarcomatrix and\r\nsarcodictyum, and extracalymmar pseudopodia, radiating freely into the\r\nwater outside the calymma.\r\n\r\n\r\n82. _The Calymma._--The calymma or extracapsular jelly-veil of the\r\nRadiolaria is always the most voluminous portion of the extracapsulum, and\r\nin spite of its simple structureless constitution is of great morphological\r\nand physiological importance. In all Radiolaria this gelatinous mantle\r\ncompletely surrounds the central capsule, but is separated from its outer\r\nsurface by a continuous, though thin, layer of exoplasm, the sarcomatrix.\r\nThe pseudopodia radiating from the latter pierce the calymma, form the\r\nsarcodictyum at its surface, and radiate from its nodal points freely into\r\nthe surrounding water. The calymma is rarely visible in living freshly\r\ncaptured Radiolaria, examined in sea-water, for its gelatinous substance is\r\nperfectly hyaline, colourless and pellucid, and possesses the same\r\nrefractive index as sea-water; but when the object is removed from this\r\nfluid and transferred to carmine solution or some other colouring matter,\r\nthe extent and figure of the calymma become apparent, for the staining\r\nfluid does not at first penetrate into the gelatinous material. When this\r\nhas taken place, however (after a longer or shorter time), and the\r\ngelatinous material has become coloured, its form and size may be observed\r\nby the converse experiment; the object is transferred once more to water\r\nand the outlines of the calymma become as clear as those of the central\r\ncapsule. The same is the case with dead specimens in which the sticky\r\nsurface of the calymma has become covered with dust.\r\n\r\n  The jelly-veil of the Radiolaria was recognised even by the earliest\r\n  observers of the group, Meyen (1834), and Huxley (1851), and compared\r\n  with that of the Palmellaria; the former noticed it in _Physematium_ and\r\n  _Sphærozoum_ (L. N. 1, p. 283), and the latter in _Thalassicolla_ and\r\n  _Collosphæra_ (L. N. 5, p. 433). In all these SPUMELLARIA, both in the\r\n  monozootic _Thalassicolla_ and in the polyzootic _Sphærozoum_ and\r\n  _Collosphæra_, the calymma is very voluminous and filled with large\r\n  alveoli. Meyen called them \"muco-gelatinous masses, in the interior of\r\n  which are contained small equal-sized vesicles\"; Huxley likewise found\r\n  clear vesicles in the jelly and compared them with Dujardin's vacuoles.\r\n  Johannes Müller observed the jelly-veil in many different Radiolaria, in\r\n  particular in the #Acanthometra#, first discovered by him, but\r\n  erroneously believed that it only originated {lii}after death by\r\n  liquefaction of the sarcode (L. N. 12, p. 6). This mistake is, however,\r\n  easy to understand, since in living Radiolaria the calymma is usually\r\n  invisible on account of its perfect transparency, whilst in dead\r\n  specimens it is usually quite distinct on account of the dust clinging to\r\n  its adhesive surface. I myself believed that the formation of the\r\n  voluminous hyaline jelly-veil was only partially due to liquefaction\r\n  after death, but that it was to some extent present in the living\r\n  organism and that it might vanish and subsequently reappear by means of\r\n  imbibition (L. N. 16, pp. 109, 110). R. Hertwig was the first to\r\n  demonstrate, in 1879, that the jelly-veil is constantly present in living\r\n  Radiolaria, that it forms the basis of the extracapsular malacoma and\r\n  surrounds the central capsule as a second protective sheath (L. N. 33, p.\r\n  114).\r\n\r\n\r\n83. _The Structure of the Calymma._--The extracapsular jelly-veil appears\r\nstructureless in most Radiolaria, inasmuch as it represents a homogeneous\r\npellucid excretion of the exoplasm and contains neither fibres nor other\r\nformed structures. In some groups, however, definite structural characters\r\nbecome secondarily developed. The most common and striking of these is the\r\nformation of alveoles, which takes place in the extracapsulum (see § 86).\r\nIn consequence of this the calymma assumes a remarkable frothy consistency\r\nand appears to be composed of large, clear, thin-walled vesicles; this is\r\nespecially the case in the #Collodaria# (#Colloidea#, Pls. 1, 3, and\r\n#Beloidea#, Pls. 2, 4), and in many large PHÆODARIA, especially among the\r\n#Phæocystina# (Phæodinida and Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101, and Aulacanthida,\r\nPls. 102-104). More rarely the calymma is not permeated by vacuoles, but\r\nthere appear in it fine striæ parallel to the surface as though it were\r\ncomposed of thin concentric laminæ like an onion; perhaps these are the\r\nexpressions of a different quantity of water in the various layers. In the\r\ncalymma of many Radiolaria thin, straight, radial lines are to be seen,\r\nwhich are probably pseudopodia, and not to be attributed to any structural\r\nmodification, or they may be slender canals which serve for the exit of the\r\npseudopodia. On the outer surface of the calymma of different Radiolaria,\r\nand especially in the ACANTHARIA, a peculiar network of fibres is to be\r\nfound, composed of polygonal meshes, like elastic fibres, probably due to a\r\nlocal thickening of the jelly. These polygonal meshes are often very\r\nregularly distributed between the radial spines of the #Acanthometra#, and\r\nstand in a definite relation to them. The fibres which form the meshes are\r\noften rather strong, resembling elastic fibres, as above-mentioned, and\r\neither simple or composed of bundles of very fine fibrillæ (L. N. 33, p.\r\n15, Taf. i. fig. 1, Taf. ii. fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n84. _The Consistency of the Calymma._--The gelatinous material of which the\r\ncalymma of the Radiolaria consists is a pellucid mass, rich in water and\r\nusually quite hyaline and structureless; its consistency is very variable.\r\nIn the majority of the Radiolaria it may perhaps be about equal to that of\r\nthe jelly which composes the umbrella of most Medusæ; but as in these\r\nlatter it may vary between very wide extremes, constituting on the one hand\r\na very soft jelly-mantle, offering but little {liii}resistance to\r\nmechanical influences and almost disintegrating under the eyes of the\r\nobserver, and on the other hand forming a firm gelatinous shell, comparable\r\nto cartilage in hardness, elasticity, and power of mechanical resistance.\r\nIn many Radiolaria of large dimensions with an alveolar calymma (especially\r\nin numerous #Collodaria# and PHÆODARIA) this may be split by means of\r\ndissecting needles and the central capsule extracted like the stone from a\r\ncherry, and then it is easy to ascertain that the firmness and elasticity\r\nof this jelly-veil are not less than those of a cherry. The different\r\ndegrees of consistency in the various Radiolaria may be dependent either\r\nupon the relative amount of water which they contain, or upon qualitative\r\nor quantitative variations in the organic substance of which the jelly\r\nconsists. Great importance is to be attached to the considerable\r\nconsistency of the calymma, because it furnishes the indispensable\r\ngroundwork for the deposition of many parts of the skeleton and\r\nparticularly of the lattice-shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n85. _The Primary and Secondary Calymma._--In most Radiolaria the external\r\nform and volume of the calymma are different at different stages of growth,\r\nand this difference is mainly dependent upon the development of the\r\nskeleton. Hence it is advisable to distinguish in general the primary from\r\nthe secondary calymma. The _primary calymma_ is in the great majority of\r\nRadiolaria a perfect sphere, in the middle of which lies the concentric\r\ncentral capsule; on the surface of this gelatinous plate the primary\r\nspherical lattice-shell is secreted in most SPUMELLARIA and\r\n#Acanthophracta#, as well as in those PHÆODARIA which possess a spherical\r\nshell; in the remaining PHÆODARIA also and in the NASSELLARIA, where the\r\nlattice-shell is not spherical but monaxon, it is secreted on the surface\r\nof the primary calymma. This takes place at a definite time, very important\r\nin the development of the Radiolarian, which for the sake of brevity we\r\nshall term the \"_lorication-period_.\" Since the firm surface of the primary\r\ncalymma furnishes the necessary foundation for the deposition of the\r\nprimary lattice-shell, it is of the greatest mechanical significance in all\r\nshell-bearing Radiolaria. The _secondary calymma_ arises only after the\r\nlorication-period by further growth of the primitive jelly-mantle and in\r\nthe fully developed Radiolarian usually encloses wholly or partially the\r\nexternal parts of the skeleton, in consequence of which it assumes the most\r\nvarious forms. Very often the secondary calymma is polyhedral, being\r\nstretched between the radial spines of the skeleton, the distal ends of the\r\nlatter then forming the fixed points of the gelatinous polyhedron.\r\n\r\n\r\n86. _The Extracapsular Vacuoles and Alveoles._--The calymma of the\r\nRadiolaria usually appears completely homogeneous and hyaline without any\r\nstructure; sometimes it encloses numerous clear vesicles, vacuoles or\r\nalveoles, and then assumes a frothy appearance, the expression of a more or\r\nless distinct alveolar structure. {liv}The clear vesicles to which this is\r\ndue are either spherical, or polyhedral from mutual pressure, and like the\r\nsimilar ones in the central capsule may be divided into membraneless\r\nvacuoles and vesicular alveoles. The _vacuoles_ are simple drops of fluid,\r\nwithout a special envelope, and immediately surrounded by the gelatinous\r\nsubstance of the calymma, in which they appear as simple cavities. The\r\n_alveoles_ on the contrary are true vesicles, with a thin envelope, which\r\nencloses a drop of fluid or a globule of jelly; in the latter case its\r\ncontents are different in refracting power and amount of contained water\r\nfrom the substance of the surrounding calymma. A sharp boundary between the\r\nmembraneless vacuoles and the vesicular alveoles cannot be drawn in the\r\ncase of the extracapsular hyaline spheres any more than in the\r\nintracapsular; the envelope of the alveoles is sometimes very distinct and\r\neven anatomically separable, whilst at other times it is very thin and\r\nscarcely recognisable; it may occasionally arise and disappear within a\r\nvery short time (see note A). There is no doubt that in the calymma as in\r\nthe central capsule the vesicular alveoles are secondary products, which\r\nhave arisen from the vacuoles by the secretion of an enveloping membrane.\r\nThis membrane is either a delicate sheath of exoplasm, or a firmer and more\r\nresistant skin, distinct from the exoplasm, and probably an excretion from\r\nit (_e.g._, Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3). In many cases the outer surface even of the\r\nvacuoles is covered by a network of pseudopodia, which form a sarcoplegma\r\nsimilar to a fenestrated alveolar membrane. The colourless pellucid fluid\r\nin the vacuoles and alveoles is usually simple sea-water, more rarely it\r\ncontains a small quantity of albumen (\"albumen-spheres\") or jelly\r\n(\"gelatinous spheres\"). The size of these spheres is very variable. Quite\r\nsmall vacuoles may be found in the calymma of many Radiolaria. Large\r\nvacuoles, on the other hand, producing the appearance of an alveolar\r\nstructure, are confined to but few groups, to a part of the SPUMELLARIA\r\n(#Colloidea#, #Beloidea#, and a few #Sphæroidea#), and to the #Phæocystina#\r\n(PHÆODARIA with incomplete skeleton); besides they occur only rarely in\r\nindividual genera, _e.g._, _Nassella_ among the skeletonless NASSELLARIA.\r\nSince the volume of the calymma is much increased by the development of\r\nvacuoles, and the power of mechanical resistance is at the same time much\r\nincreased, the fact is explained that the vacuoles occur mainly in\r\nRadiolaria which have no skeleton or only an incomplete one (see note B).\r\nAmong the monozootic #Collodaria# the alveolar structure is especially well\r\ndeveloped in the following genera; _Thalassicolla_ (Pl. 1, figs. 4, 5),\r\n_Thalassophysa_, _Thalassoplancta_, _Lampoxanthium_ (Pl. 2, figs. 1, 2);\r\namong the PHÆODARIA in most genera of the Phæodinida, Cannorrhaphida and\r\nAulacanthida (Pls. 101-104), and probably also in other voluminous\r\nPHÆODARIA (_e.g._, #Phæosphæria#). The alveoles or vacuoles in the calymma\r\nof these large Radiolaria lie usually in several layers, one above another,\r\nand increase in size from within outwards. The Polycyttaria or social\r\nRadiolaria (the three families Collozoida, Sphærozoida and Collosphærida)\r\nwithout exception have an alveolar structure, and the special form of\r\n{lv}their colonies or coenobia is to a great extent determined by the\r\ndevelopment, number, size and arrangement of the alveoles in their calymma\r\n(compare Pls. 3-8). In these cases there is not unfrequently developed a\r\nlarge central alveole (see note C) whose thickened wall encloses a globe of\r\njelly and serves as the central support of the whole colony (Pl. 5, fig.\r\n1). Still more striking, however, is the arrangement of certain\r\nPolycyttaria, where each individual of the colony (or each central capsule\r\nwith its calymma) is enclosed in a large alveole, whose firm wall often\r\nattains considerable thickness (Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3). The whole colony then\r\nappears as an aggregate of numerous cells, each of which possesses two\r\nenvelopes, the inner central capsule and the outer alveolar membrane;\r\nbetween these lies in the Collosphærida the siliceous lattice-shell (Pl. 6,\r\nfig. 2). These pericapsular alveoles may be regarded as an outer cell-wall\r\nmore correctly than the membrane of the central capsule itself, but the\r\narrangement may also be compared to the temporary encystation of other\r\nProtista (see note D).\r\n\r\n  A. The extracapsular vacuoles in the calymma were first observed in 1851\r\n  by Huxley, in _Thalassicolla_ and _Sphærozoum_, and compared with\r\n  Dujardin's sarcode vacuoles (L. N. 5). Afterwards J. Müller noticed that\r\n  generally these \"large clear vesicles are covered by a fine membrane,\"\r\n  and hence he called them \"alveoles\" (L. N. 12, pp. 3, 7, &c.). In my\r\n  Monograph I have described them more in detail as \"extracapsular\r\n  alveoles\" (1862, p. 88, Tafs. i.-iii. xxxii.-xxxv.). Ever since then the\r\n  point has been debated whether these clear spaces are simple vacuoles in\r\n  the sense of Huxley or vesicular alveoles as stated by J. Müller. This\r\n  contention is unnecessary, for both varieties are present, and often no\r\n  sharp line can be drawn between them. R. Hertwig has recently come to the\r\n  conclusion that they are as a rule \"membraneless vacuoles,\" but that they\r\n  \"sometimes become surrounded by a special envelope\" (L. N. 33, p. 31). He\r\n  even succeeded \"in extracting from a _Collosphæra_ the large vesicle\r\n  which lies in the centre of many colonies and removing its covering of\r\n  central capsules and jelly.\"\r\n\r\n  B. The _mechanical importance_ of the alveolar structure, which certainly\r\n  increases the elasticity and mechanical resistance of the voluminous\r\n  calymma, has not yet been sufficiently realised; in the case of those\r\n  Radiolaria which have no skeleton, or at all events no lattice-shell, it\r\n  may take the place of this as a protective envelope. Furthermore, by\r\n  taking in and giving out water it may discharge a hydrostatic function,\r\n  causing the organism to rise or sink in the water.\r\n\r\n  C. The _large central alveole_ found in the colonies of many Polycyttaria\r\n  (especially Collosphærida) and first described in my Monograph (Taf.\r\n  xxxiv. fig. 1), has since then been observed by Hertwig, Bütschli, and\r\n  other investigators, and recognised as the \"central support of the whole\r\n  colony, surrounded by a delicate membrane\" (compare L. N. 33, p. 31, and\r\n  L. N. 41, p. 436). In a colony of _Trypanosphæra transformata_ (Pl. 5,\r\n  fig. 1), which I observed living while in Ceylon in 1881, the membrane of\r\n  the large central alveole was surrounded by a firm network of\r\n  sarcoplegma, and could be mechanically isolated from the central\r\n  jelly-sphere which it enclosed.\r\n\r\n  D. The _pericapsular alveoles_, figured in Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3, from a\r\n  _Sphærozoum_, and in Pl. 6, fig. 2, from a _Siphonosphæra_, were very\r\n  well preserved in some preparations in the Challenger collection; perhaps\r\n  their development coincides with the formation of spores, and may be\r\n  regarded as an encystation.\r\n\r\n\r\n{lvi}87. _The Extracapsular Fat-Globules._--Fat is probably as widely\r\ndistributed in the exoplasm as in the endoplasm of the Radiolaria; a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the small, dark, highly refractive granules\r\nappear to consist of fat; most likely they are for the most part direct\r\nproducts of metastasis. These widely-spread granules, which are sometimes\r\ncoloured, and which by their passive motion produce the phenomenon of\r\ngranular circulation in the exoplasm, are not the only fatty structures in\r\nthe extracapsulum; larger globules sometimes occur. In certain large\r\n#Collodaria# (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla melacapsa_, Pl. 1, fig. 5;\r\n_Thalassophysa sanguinolenta_, &c.) radial series of oil-globules are found\r\nin the calymma, especially in its proximal portion; in others the central\r\ncapsule is surrounded by a layer of oil-globules (situated in the\r\nsarcomatrix). In the PHÆODARIA a part of the phæodium appears to consist of\r\nfat-globules.\r\n\r\n\r\n88. _The Extracapsular Pigment._--The formation of colouring matters in the\r\nextracapsulum is on the whole rare in the Radiolaria, apart from the\r\n\"yellow cells\" (see § 91) and from the peculiar phæodium of the PHÆODARIA,\r\nwhich will be separately treated of in the next paragraph. Considerable\r\nmasses of extracapsular pigment, usually black or blue, rarely brown or\r\nred, are found only in a few Radiolaria belonging to the first three\r\nlegions; most often in the SPUMELLARIA. Some large #Collodaria#, _e.g._,\r\nthe common _Thalassicolla nucleata_ and a few other species of this genus\r\n(Pl. 1, fig. 4), are characterised by a rich deposit of black or blue\r\npigment in the sarcomatrix and in the proximal portion of the calymma.\r\nBrown pigment is deposited in the calymma of many #Sphæroidea# and\r\n#Discoidea#, as well as of some NASSELLARIA (_Cystidium_, _Tridictyopus_,\r\n&c.). In a part of the ACANTHARIA red pigment granules are thickly strewn\r\nin the sarcoplegma and pass along the free pseudopodia, as for example in\r\n_Actinelius purpureus_ and _Acanthostaurus purpurascens_. The composition\r\nand significance of these extracapsular pigments are not completely known.\r\n\r\n  On the extracapsular pigment of _Thalassicolla nucleata_, compare my\r\n  Monograph, pp. 87, 251. On the red extracapsular pigment-granules of the\r\n  ACANTHARIA, see L. N. 19, pp. 345, 364, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. _The Phæodium of the Phæodaria._--The PHÆODARIA, which are\r\ndistinguished from the other three legions of Radiolaria by the double\r\nmembrane of the central capsule, and the peculiar structure of the\r\nmain-opening (astropyle), differ also in other points, the most important\r\nof which is the constant presence of a voluminous mass of extracapsular\r\npigment. This possesses a peculiar constitution and special significance,\r\nand is not to be confounded with the extracapsular pigment-granules of\r\nother Radiolaria (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla_), and hence it has been\r\ndistinguished by the name \"Phæodium,\" and the individual granules which\r\ncompose it as \"Phæodella\" (see note A). The phæodium is always excentric in\r\nposition relatively to the central capsule, of which it {lvii}surrounds the\r\noral half in the form of a voluminous concavo-convex cap, hiding the\r\nastropyle at its basal pole so completely that the latter is rarely visible\r\nuntil the phæodium has been removed (Pls. 99-104; Pl. 115, fig. 8; Pl. 123,\r\n&c.). The central capsule is generally almost completely embedded in the\r\nphæodium, so that only its aboral pole (with the two parapylæ in the\r\nTRIPYLEA) projects. In the #Phæogromia#, in which the lattice-shell\r\npossesses a special opening and the central capsule lies excentrically in\r\nthe aboral position of its interior, the phæodium occupies the oral aspect,\r\nbetween the capsule and the aperture (Pls. 99, 100, 118-120, &c.). In the\r\npeculiar family Coelographida (Pls. 126-128) a special receptacle (galea\r\nwith its rhinocanna) for the phæodium is developed outside the bivalve\r\nshell, within which the central capsule lies. The proboscis, which in all\r\nPHÆODARIA arises from the centre of the astropyle, lies in the vertical\r\naxis of the phæodium and is entirely surrounded by it. The volume of the\r\nphæodium in the majority of the PHÆODARIA may be said to be about as great\r\nas that of the central capsule, although in some species it is considerably\r\nlarger. Its colour is always dark, usually between green and brown,\r\ncommonly olive-green or blackish-brown, rarely reddish-brown or black. The\r\nphæodellæ or pigment-granules which make up the greater part of the\r\nphæodium (see note B) are irregular in form and unequal in size and show no\r\ndefinite structure; usually they are spherical or ellipsoidal, and exhibit\r\nfine parallel striæ which run transversely or obliquely (Pl. 101, fig. 3,\r\n6, 10; Pl. 103, fig. 1, &c.). Between the larger granules is usually found\r\na thick dust-like mass of innumerable very small grains. The physiological\r\nsignificance of this peculiar phæodium is still unknown, but is probably\r\nconsiderable, judging from its large size and especially from its constant\r\ntopographical relation to the astropyle; the latter consideration would\r\nlead to the supposition that it plays an important part in the nutrition\r\nand metastasis of the PHÆODARIA (see note C).\r\n\r\n  A. The phæodium of _Aulacantha_, _Thalassoplancta_, and _Coelodendrum_\r\n  was first described in 1862, in my Monograph, as an excentric\r\n  extracapsular mass of pigment of blackish-brown or olive-green colour\r\n  (pp. 87, 262, 264, 361, Taf. ii. iii. xxxii.). Since then John Murray,\r\n  who investigated many living PHÆODARIA during the Challenger expedition,\r\n  has shown its general distribution in this legion (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.,\r\n  vol. xxiv. p. 536, 1876). From the constancy of its presence I gave the\r\n  legion the name PHÆODARIA in 1879 (L. N. 34).\r\n\r\n  B. With regard to the special composition of the phæodium and the\r\n  constitution of the phæodellæ, see the general description of the\r\n  PHÆODARIA, pp. 1533-1537.\r\n\r\n  C. Perhaps the phæodellæ are to some extent symbiontes with the\r\n  PHÆODARIA; the xanthellæ present in most other Radiolaria are absent in\r\n  this legion.\r\n\r\n\r\n90. _The Extracapsular Xanthellæ._--Xanthellæ or Zooxanthellæ, symbiotic\r\n\"yellow cells,\" are very commonly found in the extracapsulum of the\r\nRadiolaria, especially in many SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA; whilst in the\r\nACANTHARIA similar yellow cells usually only occur within the central\r\ncapsule, and in the PHÆODARIA their {lviii}presence has not been certainly\r\ndemonstrated. The extracapsular Xanthellæ are found most abundantly in the\r\n#Collodaria#, both in the monozootic Thalassicollida and in the polyzootic\r\nSphærozoida. They occur in smaller numbers in the #Sphærellaria#, and in\r\nmany divisions of the latter they seem to be entirely absent. Also it\r\nsometimes happens that, though present in large numbers in some\r\nSPUMELLARIA, they are entirely absent in others nearly related to them;\r\nindeed, this has also been observed in the case of different individuals of\r\nthe same species. This fact alone is sufficient to show that the Xanthellæ\r\nare not an integral part of the Radiolarian organism (as was formerly\r\nbelieved) but parasites or more correctly symbiontes, which live as\r\ninhabitants of the calymma. More recent investigations have shown, that\r\nbesides the yellow pigment-grains they contain starch or an amyloid\r\nsubstance, that is to say, vegetable reserve materials, that their thin\r\nenvelope contains cellulose, and that their yellow colouring-matter\r\nresembles chlorophyll and is related to that of the Diatomaceæ\r\n(\"Diatomin\"). Hence they are now generally regarded as unicellular Algæ,\r\nnearly related to those which occur as symbiontes in other marine animals\r\n(_Exuviella_, &c.). The starch, which they develop with the formation of\r\noxygen, may serve as nutriment to the Radiolaria, while the carbonic acid\r\nyielded by the latter is also beneficial to the Xanthellæ. The form of the\r\nXanthellæ is usually spherical and elliptical, often also sphæroidal or\r\ndiscoidal. Their diameter is usually between 0.008 and 0.012 mm., rarely\r\nmore or less. The differences exhibited by Xanthellæ which live in\r\ndifferent groups of Radiolaria demand further investigation, which will\r\nperhaps lead to the establishment of several species of the genus\r\n_Zooxanthella_. At present _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_, in the calymma\r\nof SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, may be clearly distinguished from\r\n_Zooxanthella intracapsularis_, in the central capsule of the ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n  The \"yellow cells\" were first described in 1851 by Huxley, in the\r\n  #Collodaria#, and afterwards by J. Müller (1858) in many SPUMELLARIA and\r\n  NASSELLARIA. In my Monograph (1862, pp. 84-87) I gave a detailed account\r\n  of their structure and increase by division, and laid special emphasis on\r\n  the fact that they are the only elements in the Radiolarian organism\r\n  which \"are _undoubtedly cells_ in the strict histological sense of the\r\n  word.\" Afterwards, in my Beiträge zur Plastiden-Theorie, I showed the\r\n  constant presence of \"starch in the yellow cells of the Radiolaria\"\r\n  (1870, L. N. 21). Shortly afterwards Cienkowski observed that the yellow\r\n  cells live independently and reproduce themselves after the death of the\r\n  Radiolaria, and in consequence first put forth the hypothesis that they\r\n  do not belong to the Radiolarian organism, but that they are unicellular\r\n  Algæ parasitic upon it (1871, L. N. 22). This view was ten years later\r\n  more fully established by Karl Brandt, and elucidated by comparison with\r\n  the symbiosis of the gonidia of Algæ, and the hyphæ of Fungi in the\r\n  formation of Lichens, which had in the meantime become known (1881, L. N.\r\n  38). Brandt gave this unicellular yellow Alga the name _Zooxanthella\r\n  nutricola_, and afterwards gave fuller details regarding its remarkable\r\n  vital relations (L. N. 39). Patrick Geddes, who named it _Philozoon_,\r\n  supplemented this account and showed experimentally that it gives off\r\n  oxygen under the influence of sun-light (1882, L. N. 42, 43).  In\r\n  consequence {lix}of this there is no doubt that all Xanthellæ (the\r\n  _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_ of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and the\r\n  _Zooxanthella intracapsularis_ of the ACANTHARIA, and possibly also the\r\n  _Zooxanthella phæodaris_ of the PHÆODARIA) do not originally belong to\r\n  the Radiolarian organism, as was believed up to the time of Cienkowski,\r\n  but penetrate actively into it from without, or are taken in passively by\r\n  means of the pseudopodia. In any case their symbiosis, when they are\r\n  associated with the Radiolarian cell in large numbers, may be of great\r\n  advantage to both parties, since the metastasis of the Xanthella is\r\n  vegetable, that of the Radiolarian animal in character. In any case their\r\n  symbiosis is to a large extent accidental, by no means as necessary as in\r\n  the case of the Lichens. See on these points in addition to Brandt and\r\n  Geddes (_loc. cit._) also Geza Enz, Das Consortial-Verhältniss von Algen\r\n  und Thieren, Biol. Centralbl., Bd. ii. No. 15, 1883, Oskar Hertwig, Die\r\n  Symbiose oder das Genossenschaftsleben im Thierreich, Jena, 1883, and\r\n  Bütschli, Die Radiolarien, in Bronn's Klass. u. Ord. d. Thierreichs, 1882\r\n  (L. N. 41, pp. 456-462).\r\n\r\n\r\n91. _The Exoplasm or Extracapsular Protoplasm._--The extracapsular\r\nprotoplasm, which may be shortly termed the \"exoplasm\" (or ectosarc), is\r\nprimitively in all Radiolaria (and especially in their earliest development\r\nstages) the only important constituent of the extracapsulum, besides the\r\ncalymma. Although the extracapsular and intracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nRadiolaria are everywhere in direct communication, and although the\r\nopenings in the membrane of the central capsule bring about an interchange\r\nbetween them, still the two portions of sarcode show certain constant and\r\ncharacteristic differences, which are due to the physiological division of\r\nlabour between the central and peripheral parts of the body and their\r\ncorresponding morphological differentiation. The extracapsular, like the\r\nintracapsular, protoplasm is originally homogeneous, but may afterwards\r\nbecome differentiated in various ways, producing the special constituents\r\nof the extracapsulum. Such \"external protoplasmic products\" are vacuoles,\r\npigment-bodies, &c. More important, however, are the topographically\r\ndifferent sections into which the exoplasm may be divided according to its\r\nrelations to the central capsule and the calymma. In this respect the\r\nfollowing parts may be generally distinguished--(1) the _Sarcomatrix_, or\r\nfundamental layer of the exoplasm, which surrounds the central capsule as a\r\ncontinuous sheath of sarcode and separates it from the calymma; (2) the\r\n_Sarcoplegma_, an irregular network of the exoplasm, which spreads\r\nthroughout the gelatinous material of the calymma; (3) the _Sarcodictyum_\r\nor network of sarcode on the outer surface of the calymma; and (4) the\r\n_Pseudopodia_, which project outwards from the latter and radiate into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. _The Sarcomatrix._--The sarcomatrix, being \"the fundamental layer of\r\nthe pseudopodia\" (or \"matrix of the exoplasm\"), constitutes the proximal\r\ninnermost section of the extracapsular sarcode, and in all Radiolaria forms\r\na thin continuous mucous layer, which covers the whole outer surface of the\r\ncentral capsule and separates it from the surrounding calymma (see note A,\r\nbelow). The sarcomatrix communicates internally {lx}through the openings of\r\nthe central capsule with the endoplasm, whilst externally the pseudopodia\r\nor mucous threads arise from it, which by their union form the sarcoplegma.\r\nThe sarcomatrix is only interrupted in the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA by\r\nthose parts of the skeleton which perforate the membrane of the central\r\ncapsule. In all NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, as in the #Collodaria#, it\r\nappears as a perfectly continuous sarcode-envelope of the central capsule.\r\nIts thickness is variable; in general it is most strongly developed in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, less so in the NASSELLARIA, and is thinnest in\r\nthe ACANTHARIA. The thickness seems, however, to vary even in one and the\r\nsame individual, the difference depending partly upon the different stages\r\nof development and partly upon nutritional conditions. After abundant\r\ninception of nutriment the thin protoplasmic layer of the matrix is\r\nthickened and turbid, rich in granules and irregular masses, which are\r\nprobably due to enclosed but only half-digested food; xanthellæ also, as\r\nwell as foreign bodies taken up with the nutriment, such as frustules of\r\nDiatoms and shells of smaller Radiolaria, and of pelagic infusoria, larvæ,\r\n&c., are often, especially in large individuals, aggregated in considerable\r\nquantities in the matrix. After long fasting, on the contrary, this is poor\r\nin these enclosed bodies and in granules; it then forms a thin colourless\r\nmore or less hyaline mucous coating to the central capsule. From a\r\nphysiological standpoint the sarcomatrix is to be regarded as the _central\r\norgan of the extracapsulum_, and as of pre-eminent significance. Probably\r\nit is not only the most important organ for the nutrition of the Radiolaria\r\n(especially for digestion and assimilation in particular), but perhaps is\r\nalso the central organ of perception. On the other hand the sarcomatrix\r\nbelongs to those components of the Radiolarian organism which take no part\r\nin the formation of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n  A. The sarcomatrix was first described in my Monograph in 1862 (p. 110)\r\n  as the \"Mutterboden der Pseudopodien,\" possessing a pre-eminent\r\n  physiological importance. Compare also my paper on the sarcode elements\r\n  of the Rhizopoda (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., Bd. xv. p. 342, 1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n93. _The Sarcoplegma._--By the name sarcoplegma, as distinguished from the\r\nremaining extracapsular sarcode, is understood the intracalymmar web of\r\nexoplasm or \"ectosarcode network,\" which ramifies within the gelatinous\r\nmass of the calymma. Internally it is in direct connection with the\r\ncontinuous sheath (sarcomatrix), which encloses the central capsule, whilst\r\nexternally it is in contact with the superficial sarcode network\r\n(sarcodictyum) which surrounds the calymma. The configuration of this\r\nexoplasmic web, which penetrates the jelly-veil in all directions, is\r\nexceedingly variable; in most Radiolaria it is extremely irregular in form,\r\nlike the protoplasmic network in the ground-substance of many kinds of\r\nconnective tissue. In some groups, however, it assumes a rather regular\r\nshape which it appears to retain (_e.g._, in many ACANTHARIA). It must be\r\nassumed also that in those instances where the consistency {lxi}of the\r\ncalymma approaches that of cartilage, the tracks of the exoplasmic threads\r\nremain constant, but accurate observations are wanting as to how far the\r\nconfiguration of the sarcoplegma is constant or variable in the different\r\ngroups, as well as regarding its peculiar behaviour in those Radiolaria\r\nwhose calymma is characterised by the formation of vacuoles or alveoles\r\n(see § 86). Usually it envelops the larger alveoles in the form of a\r\nreticulate veil. In many #Collodaria# the exoplasm is aggregated at certain\r\npoints of the intracalymmar web, so that large balls or amoeboid bodies\r\nappear to be distributed between the alveoles, _e.g._, in _Thalassophysa\r\npelagica_ and _Thalassicolla melacapsa_ (Pl. 1, figs. 4, 5). The\r\nsarcoplegma is metamorphosed directly into silex in the Radiolaria\r\nspongiosa, or those genera which possess a spongy cortical skeleton, and\r\nwere formerly known as Spongurida; to this category belong the\r\nSpongosphærida (Pl. 18) and Spongodiscida (Pl. 47) as well as certain\r\nNASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA. The single siliceous spicules, which are\r\nirregularly interwoven to form the spongy web, are to be regarded as the\r\nsilicified threads of the intracalymmar sarcode network. From a\r\nphysiological point of view the sarcoplegma is of importance both for the\r\nnutrition and motion of the Radiolaria, since it brings the sarcomatrix and\r\nthe sarcodictyum, with the pseudopodia which radiate from it, into direct\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\n94. _The Sarcodictyum._--The sarcodictyum may be defined as the\r\nextracalymmar network of exoplasm, and is a reticular covering which lies\r\nupon the outer surface of the gelatinous calymma. Internally, the\r\nsarcodictyum is in direct communication with the sarcoplegma, or the web of\r\nexoplasmic threads which ramifies in the gelatinous substance of the\r\ncalymma; externally, on the other hand, the pseudopodia radiate freely from\r\nit; thus its relation to these is similar to that which the sarcomatrix\r\nbears to the roots of the sarcoplegma. Relations similar to those which\r\nhave led to the separation of the primary from the secondary calymma,\r\ninduce us to distinguish also a primary and secondary sarcodictyum. The\r\noriginal or _primary sarcodictyum_ ramifies over the surface of the\r\noriginal or primary calymma, and like this is of pre-eminent importance in\r\nthe formation of the primary lattice-shell; if we regard the surface of the\r\nprimary calymma as the indispensable foundation for the deposition of this\r\nlatter, then the primary sarcodictyum furnishes the material from which it\r\nis developed: silex in the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, a silicate of\r\ncarbon in the PHÆODARIA, and acanthin in the ACANTHARIA. It may indeed be\r\nsaid that the primary lattice-shell of the Radiolaria arises by a direct\r\nchemical metamorphosis of the primary sarcodictyum, by a chemical\r\nprecipitation of the dissolved skeletal material (silex, silicate, or\r\nacanthin), which was stored up in the exoplasm of the sarcodictyum. Hence a\r\ndeduction from the special conformation of the former to that of the latter\r\nis permissible. The particular form of the primary lattice-sphere with its\r\nregular or irregular meshes is due to the corresponding form of the primary\r\nsarcodictyum; both regular and irregular forms of this {lxii}commonly\r\noccurring. The form of the _regular sarcodictyum_ with circular or regular\r\npolygonal, usually hexagonal, meshes is constantly maintained during the\r\nformation of the regular lattice-shells (_e.g._, Pl. 12, figs. 5-10; Pl.\r\n52, figs. 8-20; Pl. 96, figs. 2-6; Pl. 113, figs. 1-6). The form of the\r\n_irregular sarcodictyum_, on the other hand, with irregular polygonal or\r\nroundish meshes, persists during the development of the irregular\r\nlattice-shells (_e.g._, Pls. 29, 70, 97, 106). All this is true also of the\r\n_secondary sarcodictyum_, or the exoplasmic network which ramifies over the\r\nsurface of the secondary calymma. The secondary lattice-shells, which are\r\ndeposited on the surface of the latter, retain the configuration of the\r\nsecondary sarcodictyum, by the chemical metamorphosis of which they have\r\noriginated; this is the case in many SPUMELLARIA which develop several\r\nconcentric lattice-shells (Pl. 29), in some NASSELLARIA (Pl. 54, fig. 5),\r\nin the Phractopeltida among the ACANTHARIA (Pl. 133), and in the\r\ndouble-shelled PHÆODARIA, Cannosphærida, and part of the Coelodendrida and\r\nCoelographida (Pls. 112, 121, 128). In those Radiolaria which form no\r\nlattice-shell whatever, the conformation of the sarcodictyum is usually\r\nirregular, with meshes of irregular form and unequal size; sometimes,\r\nhowever, they seem to be very regular, as in many #Acanthometra# (Pl. 129,\r\nfig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n95. _The Pseudopodia._--On the whole the pseudopodia or thread-like\r\nprocesses of the exoplasm exhibit in the Radiolaria the same characteristic\r\npeculiarities as in all true Rhizopoda; they are usually very numerous,\r\nlong and thin, flexible and sensitive filaments of sarcode, which show the\r\npeculiar phenomena of granular movement. Their physiological significance\r\nis in several respects very great, for they serve as active organs for the\r\ninception of nutriment, for locomotion, sensation, and the formation of the\r\nskeleton (see note A, below). The presence of a calymma, however, which\r\ndistinguishes the Radiolaria from the other Rhizopoda, brings about certain\r\nmodifications in the behaviour of the pseudopodia. If in general all the\r\nthreads, which arise from the sarcomatrix or fundamental layer and radiate\r\noutwards, be called \"pseudopodia,\" then that part of them which is included\r\nin the gelatinous substance of the calymma and forms the sarcoplegma may be\r\ntermed the \"collopodia\" (or intracalymmar pseudopodia), and the remaining\r\nportion, which passes outwards from the sarcodictyum freely into the water,\r\nmay be described as \"astropodia\" (or extracalymmar pseudopodia). In many\r\nRadiolaria these two portions present some differences in morphological and\r\nphysiological respects, and certain distinctions are probably generally\r\npresent (see note B). Apart from this universal differentiation in the\r\ndifferent groups of the Radiolaria, specially modified forms of pseudopodia\r\nmay be recognised as the axopodia and myxopodia of the ACANTHARIA (see §\r\n95, A), and the sarcode-flagellum of certain SPUMELLARIA (see note C).\r\n\r\n  A. The pseudopodia of the Radiolaria have been so fully described in my\r\n  Monograph, in 1862, both morphologically and physiologically, that I need\r\n  only refer to the account there given {lxiii}(pp. 89-127); for\r\n  supplementary observations see R. Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33, p. 117) and\r\n  Bütschli (1882, L. N. 41, pp. 437-445).\r\n\r\n  B. The _Astropodia_, or free radiating pseudopodia, are in many\r\n  Radiolaria more or less clearly distinguishable from the collopodia,\r\n  which form the sarcoplegma within the calymma; how far these distinctions\r\n  depend upon a permanent differentiation (especially in the ACANTHARIA and\r\n  PHÆODARIA) needs further investigation.\r\n\r\n  C. The _sarcode-flagellum_ (perhaps better termed _axoflagellum_) was\r\n  first described in my Monograph (1862, p. 115) in the case of various\r\n  #Discoidea# (Taf. xxviii. figs. 5, 8; Taf. xxx. fig. 1). Hertwig has\r\n  given a substantially similar account of the organ in some other\r\n  #Discoidea# (L. N. 33, p. 67, Taf. vi. figs. 10, 11); probably this\r\n  peculiar structure is confined to the order #Discoidea# among the\r\n  SPUMELLARIA, but is widely distributed within its limits. The\r\n  axoflagellum is a thick cylindrical thread of sarcode, finely striated\r\n  and pointed towards its free end. It always lies in the equatorial plane\r\n  of the discoidal body, and always unpaired in one of its axes; in the\r\n  triradiate #Discoidea# it is in the axis of the unpaired principal arm\r\n  and opposite to it (Pl. 43, fig. 15). In the Ommatodiscida (p. 500, Pl.\r\n  48, figs. 8, 19, 20) the axoflagellum probably passes out through the\r\n  peculiar marginal ostium of the shell. Perhaps it is always connected\r\n  with the central nucleus by intracapsular axial fibres, and is to be\r\n  regarded as a specially differentiated bundle of pseudopodia (or\r\n  axopodia?).\r\n\r\n\r\n95A. _The Myxopodia and Axopodia._--The two forms of pseudopodia which we\r\ndistinguish as myxopodia and axopodia differ markedly from each other both\r\nmorphologically and physiologically. The _myxopodia_, or ordinary free\r\npseudopodia, which are found in large numbers in all Radiolaria, and\r\nconstitute their most important peripheral organs, are simple homogeneous\r\nexoplasmic threads, which arise from the sarcodictyum or extracalymmar\r\nsarcode network, and radiate freely into the water; here they may branch\r\nand combine by anastomosis to form a changeable network, but they never\r\ncontain an axial thread. The _axopodia_, on the other hand, are\r\ndifferentiated pseudopodia, which consist of a firm radial thread, and a\r\nsoft covering of exoplasm; they penetrate the whole calymma in a radial\r\ndirection and project freely from its surface, and generally (if not\r\nalways) they are produced inwards to the middle of the central capsule,\r\nperforating its membrane; their proximal end is lost in a dark central heap\r\nof granules. Such axopodia are at present known with certainty only in the\r\nACANTHARIA, where they are widely, and perhaps universally, distributed.\r\nTheir development in this legion probably stands in direct causal relation\r\nto the peculiar structure of the central capsule and the centrogenous\r\nformation of the skeleton. Since the radial skeletal rods of the\r\n#Acanthometra# possess originally a thin coating of protoplasm, it may be\r\nsaid that the centrogenous axopodia of this group became differentiated in\r\ntwo ways, the firm axial threads of one section remaining very thin and\r\ncovered by protoplasm, whilst those of the other section became\r\nmetamorphosed into radial bars of acanthin. This hypothesis acquires more\r\nprobability from the regular distribution and arrangement of the axopodia\r\nin the ACANTHARIA; they usually stand at fixed intervals {lxiv}between the\r\nradial bars, singly or in groups; sometimes their number seems to be not\r\ngreater than that of the bars, whilst in other cases a circlet or group of\r\naxopodia corresponds to each radial bar. Perhaps their fine axial thread\r\nconsists of acanthin. At all events the axopodia are constant organs\r\n(probably sensory, like the \"palpocils\") and not retractile like the\r\nmovable myxopodia.\r\n\r\n  The axial threads in the pseudopodia of the #Acanthometra# were first\r\n  discovered by R. Hertwig, who accurately described their peculiar\r\n  structure and arrangement (L. N. 33, pp. 16, 117).\r\n\r\n\r\n96. _The Myophriscs of the Acanthometra._--The #Acanthometra# are\r\ncharacterised by a very peculiar differentiation of the exoplasm, namely,\r\nby the formation of myophriscs or contractile threads from the\r\nsarcodictyum. In most (and perhaps in all) ACANTHARIA of this order each\r\nradial bar is surrounded by a circlet of such contractile threads, which\r\nwas first described as a \"ciliary corona\" (see note A, below). The number\r\nof contractile threads in each circlet usually amounts to from ten to\r\ntwenty, rarely being more than thirty and less than eight; it often appears\r\nto be constant in the individual species (see note B). In the living state\r\nthe myophriscs are long, thin filaments, the pointed distal end of which is\r\ninserted into the radial bar, whilst the thicker proximal end is attached\r\nto the surface of the calymma, which is elevated round the base of each rod\r\ninto the form of a gelatinous cone or skeletal sheath (see note C).\r\nProbably the myophriscs lie on the outer surface of the apical portion of\r\nthis gelatinous cone, and are hence to be regarded as exoplasmic threads\r\ndifferentiated from the sarcodictyum. Sometimes, however (as in\r\n_Acanthochiasma_), they fuse into a contractile membrane and form the\r\nenvelope of a cone, whose interior is occupied by a gelatinous papilla of\r\nthe calymma. On mechanical irritation the myophriscs contract rapidly and\r\nsuddenly, like muscle-fibrillæ, becoming at the same time thicker, and\r\nhence are very different from pseudopodia. Their distal point of insertion\r\nbeing fixed to the firm acanthin rod, they raise by their contraction the\r\nskeletal sheath, to which their bases are attached or in the surface of\r\nwhich they lie. The result of their contraction is therefore a distention\r\nand increase in volume of the calymma, with which is no doubt connected an\r\ninception of water into the gelatinous mass, and hence a diminution in its\r\nspecific gravity. Probably the #Acanthometra# contract their myophriscs\r\nvoluntarily when they wish to rise in the water; when these relax the\r\ncalymma collapses owing to its elasticity, water is then expelled and the\r\nspecific gravity increases. From a physiological point of view, then, the\r\nmyophriscs are to be regarded as a hydrostatic apparatus, morphologically\r\nas myophanes or muscular fibrillæ, such as also occur in the intracapsular\r\nprotoplasm (see §§ 77-80). On more violent irritation and after the death\r\nof the #Acanthometra# the myophriscs separate from the radial bars and\r\nremain attached to the distal ends of the conical gelatinous sheaths as\r\nfree \"ciliary coronas.\" At the same time, {lxv}they melt into short, thick,\r\nhyaline rods, the so-called \"gelatinous cilia.\" The myophriscs are found\r\nonly in the order #Acanthometra#, and are wanting in the #Acanthophracta#,\r\nas well as in the other three legions of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n  A. The \"_ciliary coronas_\" on the skeletal rods of dead #Acanthometra#\r\n  were first described by the discoverer of this order, Johannes Müller,\r\n  and referred to as \"the stumps of the contracted, thickened threads\" (L.\r\n  N. 12, p. 11, Taf. xi.).\r\n\r\n  B. The \"_number of the gelatinous cilia_\" I found constant in certain\r\n  species of #Acanthometra#, and stated in my Monograph (L. N. 16, p. 115)\r\n  \"that here is to be found the first differentiation of the diffuse\r\n  sarcode into definite organs of regular definite number, size, and\r\n  position, which deserve the name tentacles rather than pseudopodia.\"\r\n\r\n  C.  The nature of the myophriscs as fibrillæ allied to muscles was first\r\n  discovered by R. Hertwig, who described them as \"structures of peculiar\r\n  nature,\" under the name of \"contractile threads,\" and pointed out in\r\n  detail their histological and physiological peculiarities (L. N. 33, pp.\r\n  16-19, Taf. i.).\r\n\r\n\r\n97. _The Exoplasm of the Peripylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA is in communication with the intracapsular sarcode\r\nby the innumerable fine pores of the capsule-membrane, and like these pores\r\nis evenly distributed over the whole surface. The sarcomatrix which\r\nimmediately surrounds the central capsule is moderately strong, and sends\r\nout innumerable long, thin pseudopodia, which probably correspond to the\r\npores of the membrane. Their number is markedly greater in the SPUMELLARIA\r\nthan in the other three legions. The ramifications and communications which\r\nthe radiating fibres of the sarcomatrix undergo within the calymma,\r\napparently present the most manifold variations, so that the sarcoplegma or\r\nintracalymmar network thus formed has very diverse forms. On the surface of\r\nthe calymma the exoplasmic threads constitute a variously disposed\r\nsarcodictyum, a regular or irregular exoplasmic network, by the\r\nsilicification of which a primary lattice-shell arises in the majority of\r\nthe SPUMELLARIA. The free ends of the pseudopodia, which arise from this\r\nextracalymmar network and radiate out into the water, appear in most\r\nSPUMELLARIA to be relatively short, but exceedingly numerous. Specially\r\nmodified pseudopodia and axial threads in particular do not seem to occur\r\nin this legion. Perhaps, however, among the latter may be reckoned the\r\nremarkable pseudopodia which combine to form the sarcode flagellum in many\r\n#Discoidea# (and perhaps in other SPUMELLARIA). This axoflagellum is a\r\nparticularly strong thread of sarcode, arising from a definite point in the\r\ncentral capsule; it is cylindrical or slenderly conical in form, much\r\nlonger, stronger, and more contractile than the ordinary pseudopodia; it\r\ncontracts in a serpentine fashion on mechanical irritation and seems to\r\noriginate by the fusion of a bundle of pseudopodia (compare § 95, C).\r\n\r\n\r\n98. _The Exoplasm of the Actipylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA differs in several important respects from that of\r\nother {lxvi}Radiolaria, and appears to undergo more significant\r\ndifferentiations than that of the three other legions. Since the pores in\r\nthe wall of the central capsule are not distributed evenly and at equal\r\nintervals over its whole surface (as in the PERIPYLEA), but rather exhibit\r\na regular disposition in groups at unequal intervals, the number of\r\nprojecting pseudopodia is much less and the law of their arrangement\r\ndifferent from that which obtains in the PERIPYLEA (§ 58). In many and\r\nprobably in all ACANTHARIA they are divided into two groups, those which\r\narise from the centre of the capsule and possess firm axial threads, and\r\nthose which have not these characters (compare § 95, A). The axopodia, or\r\nstiff pseudopodia with axial threads, arise from the centre of the capsule,\r\nare present in much smaller numbers than the soft and flexible myxopodia,\r\nand are regularly disposed between the radial bars of acanthin, usually so\r\nthat they are as far removed from them as possible, _i.e._, in the centre\r\nbetween each three or four bars; these latter may indeed be regarded as\r\nstrongly developed axial threads, which have become changed into acanthin\r\n(§ 95, A). The soft myxopodia, or pseudopodia without axial threads, are\r\nmuch more numerous than the others, and arise from the sarcodictyum or\r\nexoplasmic network which ramifies over the surface of the calymma. Their\r\nnumber and arrangement seem, however, in many (if not in all) ACANTHARIA to\r\nbe regular and not to possess the extraordinary variability seen in the\r\nother three legions. In many #Acanthometra# the sarcodictyum exhibits a\r\nsymmetrical conformation, with regular or subregular, polygonal (mostly\r\nhexagonal) meshes, and generally the stronger threads of the sarcodictyum\r\nsecrete a firm, homogeneous or fibrillar, striated substance, which forms a\r\nnetwork of ridges on the surface of the calymma. In the #Acanthophracta#\r\nthe place of this is taken by the acanthin network of the primary\r\nlattice-shell. The axopodia of the #Acanthometra# are usually about as long\r\nas the radial spines between which they stand; their stiff axial thread is\r\nsurrounded by a soft sheath of protoplasm, communicating with the thin\r\nsarcomatrix which surrounds the central capsule. Numerous branches pass\r\ninto the calymma from the exoplasmic sheath of the axial threads, and form\r\nby their interweaving a loose sarcoplegma. The most peculiar differentiated\r\nproducts of the exoplasm of the ACANTHARIA, however, are the myophane\r\nfibrillæ of the #Acanthometra#, which have already been described under the\r\nname of myophriscs (§ 96).\r\n\r\n\r\n99. _The Exoplasm of the Monopylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nNASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA arises only from the porochora, or the\r\nintracapsular podoconus, the oral base of which is formed by this porous\r\narea. The pseudopodia or protoplasmic threads which pass through the pores\r\nof the latter, united into a bundle, are not very numerous (in most\r\nNASSELLARIA probably between thirty and ninety), and unite just outside it\r\nto form a thick discoid sarcomatrix; this covers the porochora completely\r\nbelow, and spreads out in the form of a thin envelope of exoplasm over the\r\nwhole {lxvii}surface of the central capsule; at the apical portion of the\r\nlatter the sarcomatrix is often so thin that it can only be recognised by\r\nthe aid of reagents; it separates the membrane of the central capsule from\r\nthe surrounding calymma. The pseudopodia, which penetrate the latter and by\r\nloose anastomoses from a wide-meshed sarcoplegma within it, are usually not\r\nvery numerous. The greater part of them radiate in a bunch downwards from\r\nthe basal disc of the sarcomatrix, and a smaller number arise from the\r\nthinner envelope which covers the remainder of the central capsule (Pl. 51,\r\nfig. 13; Pl. 65, fig. 1; Pl. 81, fig. 16). On the outer surface of the\r\ncalymma the collopodia, which have passed through it, unite to form the\r\nsarcodictyum, and through the silicification of this the primary\r\nlattice-shell arises in the great majority of the NASSELLARIA. From the\r\nsurface of the sarcodictyum arise the astropodia, or free pseudopodia which\r\nradiate outwards into the water. Their number in most MONOPYLEA is\r\nrelatively small, but their length appears to be very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n100. _The Exoplasm of the Cannopylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the\r\nPHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is much better developed as regards volume than in\r\nthe other three legions, and is connected with the intracapsular sarcode by\r\nonly a few apertures in the capsule-membrane. In most PHÆODARIA three of\r\nthese are present, the astropyle or main-opening at the oral pole of the\r\nmain axis, and the two lateral parapylæ or accessory openings on either\r\nside of the aboral pole (§ 60). In several families the latter appear to be\r\nwanting, whilst in others their number is increased; these families have\r\nnot yet, however, been observed during life. The protoplasm projects both\r\nfrom the oral main-opening and from the two aboral accessory openings in\r\nthe form of a thick cylindrical rod; the tube into which each opening is\r\nproduced in many PHÆODARIA (longer in the case of the astropyle, shorter in\r\nthe parapylæ) being regarded as an excretion from this protoplasmic\r\ncylinder. The sarcode threads within the tube appear like a bundle of\r\nfibrils, either quite hyaline or finely striated. After issuing from the\r\nmouth of the aperture they pass over into a thick sarcomatrix, which\r\nsurrounds the central capsule entirely and separates it from the enclosing\r\ncalymma. In the neighbourhood of the basal astropyle the sarcomatrix is\r\nusually swollen into a thick lenticular disc, which is in direct contact\r\nwith the peculiar phæodium of this legion (§ 89). The pseudopodia, which\r\nradiate from the sarcomatrix, and form by anastomosis a wide-meshed\r\nsarcoplegma within the calymma, are usually not very numerous in the\r\nPHÆODARIA, but are very strong. Sometimes two stronger bundles of\r\ncollopodia may be distinguished at the two poles of the main axis, an oral\r\nbundle (in the direction of the proboscis of the astropyle) and an aboral\r\nbundle (at the opposite pole between the parapylæ). The collopodia of the\r\nsarcoplegma unite at the surface of the calymma into a regular or irregular\r\nsarcodictyum, which, in most PHÆODARIA produces by the secretion of a\r\npeculiar silicate the primary lattice-shell. {lxviii}The free astropodia,\r\nwhich pass outwards from the sarcodictyum into the water, are in most\r\nPHÆODARIA very numerous (Pl. 101, fig. 10). Since, however, only a few\r\nspecies of this great legion have been observed in a living state, their\r\npseudopodia require further accurate examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--THE SKELETON.\r\n\r\n(§§ 101-140).\r\n\r\n101. _The Significance of the Skeleton._--The skeleton of the Radiolaria is\r\ndeveloped in such exceedingly manifold and various shapes, and exhibits at\r\nthe same time such wonderful regularity and delicacy in its adjustments,\r\nthat in both these respects the present group of Protista excels all other\r\nclasses of the organic world. For, in spite of the fact that the\r\nRadiolarian organism always remains merely a single cell, it shows the\r\npotentiality of the highest complexity to which the process of skeleton\r\nformation can be brought by a single cell. All that has been brought to\r\npass in this direction by single tissue-cells of animals and plants does\r\nnot attain the extremely high stage of development of the Radiolaria. Only\r\nvery few Rhizopoda of this very rich and varied class fail to exhibit the\r\npower of forming this firm supporting and protecting organ--indeed, only\r\nten of the seven hundred and thirty-nine genera which are enrolled in the\r\nlist of the Challenger collection, namely, six genera of SPUMELLARIA (five\r\nThalassicollida, _Actissa_, _Thalassolampe_, _Thalassopila_,\r\n_Thalassicolla_, _Thalassophysa_, Pl. 1, and one genus of Collozoida,\r\n_Collozoum_, Pl. 3), and in addition two genera of NASSELLARIA (the\r\nNassellida, _Cystidium_ and _Nassella_, Pl. 91, fig. 1), and two genera of\r\nPHÆODARIA (the Phæodinida, _Phæocolla_ and _Phæodina_, Pl. 101, figs. 1,\r\n2). These skeletonless forms of Radiolaria are, however, of extreme\r\ninterest, since they include the original stem-forms of the whole class as\r\nwell as of its four legions. All Radiolaria which form skeletons have\r\noriginated from soft and skeletonless stem-forms by adaptation, and that\r\npolyphyletically, for the skeletal types of the four legions have been\r\ndeveloped independently of each other (§ 108).\r\n\r\n\r\n102. _The Chemical Peculiarities of the Skeleton._--The chemical\r\ncomposition of the skeleton shows very marked variations in the different\r\nlegions of the Radiolaria. The two legions SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA\r\n(united formerly as \"Polycystina\") form their skeleton of pure silica (see\r\nnote A, below); the legion PHÆODARIA of a silicate of carbon (see note B),\r\nand the ACANTHARIA of a peculiar organic substance--acanthin (see note C).\r\nThis explains the well-known fact that the deposits of fossil Radiolaria\r\n(or Polycystine marls) are composed exclusively of the skeletons of\r\nSPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, those of the ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA being\r\nentirely absent (in the case of the last group, however, exception must be\r\nmade in favour of the Dictyochida, or those PHÆODARIA {lxix}whose skeleton\r\nis made up of isolated scattered tangential siliceous fragments). The\r\nenormous deposits of Radiolarian skeletons in the deep sea of today, which\r\nconstitute the Radiolarian ooze, consist, like the fossil Polycystine\r\nmarls, almost exclusively of the shells of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA,\r\nthough here the acanthin skeletons of the ACANTHARIA may be present in very\r\nsmall numbers, and the silicate skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, which offer\r\nmore resistance to the solvent action of sea-water, somewhat more\r\nabundantly. Calcareous skeletons do not occur in the Radiolaria (see note\r\nD).\r\n\r\n  A. The pure siliceous skeletons of the Polycystina were first recognised\r\n  in 1833 by Ehrenberg in chalky marls (L. N. 2, p. 117).  Since the two\r\n  legions ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA were entirely unknown to Ehrenberg, his\r\n  name Polycystina has reference only to the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  B. The silicate skeleton of the PHÆODARIA was formerly taken by me for a\r\n  purely siliceous one. When I described the first PHÆODARIA in my\r\n  Monograph in 1862, I was only acquainted with five genera and seven\r\n  species, whilst the number of PHÆODARIA here described from the\r\n  Challenger amounts to eighty-four genera and four hundred and sixty-five\r\n  species. In the vast majority of these (though not in all) the skeleton\r\n  becomes more or less intensely stained by carmine, and is also more or\r\n  less charred at a red heat, in some even becoming of a blackish-brown. In\r\n  many PHÆODARIA, furthermore, the hollow skeletal tubes are destroyed by\r\n  the continued action of heat. They are also, for the most part, strongly\r\n  acted upon, or even destroyed by boiling caustic alkalis, whilst boiling\r\n  mineral acids have no effect upon them. The best method of cleaning the\r\n  skeletons of PHÆODARIA from their soft parts is to heat them in\r\n  concentrated sulphuric acid, and then add a drop of fuming nitric acid;\r\n  in this they are not dissolved even on prolonged heating. From these\r\n  facts it would appear that the skeletons of the PHÆODARIA consist of a\r\n  compound of organic substance and silica, or a \"carbonic silicate.\" The\r\n  more intimate composition yet remains to be discovered, as also the\r\n  manifold differences which the various families of PHÆODARIA seem to show\r\n  in respect of its composition. The small skeletal fragments of the\r\n  Dictyochida (the only remains of PHÆODARIA which occur as fossils) appear\r\n  to consist of pure silica.\r\n\r\n  C. The acanthin skeleton of the ACANTHARIA was first described as such in\r\n  my Monograph (1862, pp. 30-32). Johannes Müller, the discoverer of this\r\n  legion, took them for siliceous skeletons and defined the #Acanthometra#\r\n  as \"Radiolaria without lattice-shell, but with siliceous radial spines\"\r\n  (L. N. 12, p. 46). I formerly supposed that the acanthin skeletons in\r\n  some of the ACANTHARIA were partially or wholly metamorphosed into\r\n  siliceous skeletons, but, according to the investigations of R. Hertwig,\r\n  this does not appear to be the case; he showed that the skeletons of the\r\n  most varied #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta# are completely dissolved\r\n  under the longer or shorter action of acids, and supposes that in all\r\n  ACANTHARIA, without exception, the skeleton is composed of acanthin\r\n  (1879, L. N. 33, p. 120). Quite recently Brandt has found that the\r\n  acanthin spines dissolve not only in acids, alkalis, and \"liquor\r\n  conservativus\" (as I had shown), but also in solutions of carbonate of\r\n  soda (1 per cent.), and even of common salt (10 to 20 per cent.); he\r\n  concludes from this that they consist of an albuminoid substance\r\n  (vitellin) (L. N. 38, p. 400). I am unable to share this view, for I have\r\n  never been able to see some of the most important reactions of albumen in\r\n  any of the skeletons which I have examined, such for example as the\r\n  xanthoproteic reaction, the red coloration with Millon's test, &c. They\r\n  do not become {lxx}yellow either with nitric acid or with iodine. In\r\n  dilute mineral acids they dissolve more rapidly than in concentrated. My\r\n  usual method of cleansing the skeleton of ACANTHARIA (which has been\r\n  practised with the same result on thousands of specimens) consists in\r\n  heating the preparation in a small volume of concentrated sulphuric acid\r\n  and then adding a drop of fuming nitric acid; all other constituents (the\r\n  whole central capsule and the calymma) are thus very rapidly destroyed;\r\n  the skeleton remains quite uninjured and withstands the combined action\r\n  of the mineral acids for a longer or shorter time, though on prolonged\r\n  heating it also is dissolved. I do not therefore regard acanthin as an\r\n  albuminous substance, but as one related to chitin.\r\n\r\n  D. Calcareous skeletons have not been certainly demonstrated in the\r\n  Radiolaria, and probably do not occur. Sir Wyville Thomson in his\r\n  Atlantic (1877, L. N. 31, vol. i. p. 233, fig. 51) described under the\r\n  name _Calcaromma calcarea_, a Radiolarian which contained scattered in\r\n  its calymma numerous calcareous corpuscles \"resembling the rowels of\r\n  spurs.\" These are identical with the \"toothed bodies, recalling crystal\r\n  balls,\" which Johannes Müller figured in the Mediterranean _Thalassicolla\r\n  morum_ so early as 1858, and compared with the \"siliceous asterisks of\r\n  _Tethya_\" (L. N. 12, p. 28, Taf. vii. figs. 1, 2). I formerly regarded\r\n  these peculiar calcareous corpuscles, whose solubility in mineral acids I\r\n  had observed, as spicules of a Thalassicollid, and hence described the\r\n  species in my Monograph as _Thalassosphæra morum_ (L. N. 16, p. 260). I\r\n  have, however, seen reason to change my view, and am now led to suppose\r\n  that those peculiar calcareous corpuscles, which may be named\r\n  \"_Calcastrella_,\" are not formed by the Radiolarian itself, but are\r\n  foreign bodies which have been accidentally incorporated into the calymma\r\n  of a Thalassicollid (_Actissa_). These corpuscles occur, often in large\r\n  numbers, in many preparations in the Challenger collection, and in the\r\n  calymma of other Radiolaria, chiefly #Discoidea#, hence it would appear\r\n  that they are foreign bodies taken up by the pseudopodia and carried into\r\n  the calymma by the circulation of the sarcode. The Radiolaria which Sir\r\n  Wyville Thomson figured as _Calcaromma calcarea_, and Müller as\r\n  _Thalassicolla morum_, I regard as species of _Actissa_ (see p. 13),\r\n  perhaps _Actissa radiata_ of the Pacific, and _Actissa primordialis_ of\r\n  the Mediterranean (compare the description of the Thalassosphærida of the\r\n  Challenger collection, pp. 30, 31).\r\n\r\n\r\n103. _The Physical Properties of the Skeleton._--The skeletons of all\r\nRadiolaria are characterised pre-eminently by a high degree of _firmness_,\r\nwhich fits them to serve as protective and supporting apparatus. This is\r\nobvious in the case of the pure siliceous shells of the Polycystina; but\r\nthe acanthin framework of the ACANTHARIA also possesses a degree of\r\nstiffness but little inferior, whilst the silicate skeletons of the\r\nPHÆODARIA seem on the whole to be not so firm. The hollow skeletal tubes of\r\nthe last-named, which are filled with gelatinous material, are very brittle\r\non account of the delicacy of their walls. Their _elasticity_ also is very\r\nsmall, whilst that of the acanthin spines is considerable. The thin long\r\nneedles of many ACANTHARIA are very elastic, as are also the bristle-like\r\nsiliceous spicules of many SPUMELLARIA. The _refractive power_ of the\r\nskeleton in the various legions is very different, depending upon the\r\nchemical constitution. The siliceous skeleton of the Polycystina\r\n(SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA) and the silicate skeleton of the PHÆODARIA\r\nhave the same refractive index as glycerine, and hence become invisible\r\nwhen mounted in that fluid; they then become visible only on addition of\r\n{lxxi}water, and are clearer in proportion to the quantity of water which\r\nis added. The refractive index of acanthin is, however, very different from\r\nthat of glycerine, so that the skeletons of ACANTHARIA are readily visible\r\nwhen mounted in this fluid. In water, the skeletons of all Radiolaria\r\nappear about equally refractive, as also in Canada balsam. The substance of\r\nthe skeleton appears almost entirely hyaline, colourless, and transparent.\r\nVery rarely it is faintly coloured (in some ACANTHARIA). A cloudy opaque\r\nconstitution is seen in some PHÆODARIA (especially in the \"porcellanous\r\nshells\" of Tuscarorida and Circoporida, Pls. 100, 114-117); when dried,\r\nthese appear by reflected light milky-white or yellowish-white; the cause\r\nof this opacity lies partly in the peculiar \"cement-like structure\" of\r\nthese porcellanous shells, partly in their fine porosity, and the minute\r\nair-bubbles contained in their thick walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n104. _The Elementary Structure of the Skeleton._--The general constitution\r\nof the skeleton--or more accurately expressed, of the morphological\r\nelements of which the skeleton consists--is of such a nature that it may be\r\ntermed structureless. Both the organic acanthin skeletons of the ACANTHARIA\r\nand the silicate skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, as well as the inorganic\r\nsiliceous skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, appear under the\r\nmicroscope perfectly homogeneous, transparent, colourless, and crystalline.\r\nOnly very rarely do they show traces of a concentric striation, which\r\narises from the deposition of the skeletal substance in layers; as, for\r\nexample, the thick spines of some PHÆODARIA (Pls. 105-107, &c.). Some of\r\nthe PHÆODARIA, however, form an exception to this rule, inasmuch as their\r\npartially tubular skeletal elements possess a remarkable porcellanous\r\nstructure. In the tubular or Cannoid skeleton, which occurs in most\r\nCANNOPYLEA, the lumen of the thin-walled flinty tube is filled with jelly,\r\nand frequently a thin siliceous thread runs in its axis, and is connected\r\nwith the wall by transverse threads (§§ 127, 139). The elementary structure\r\nof the opaque porcellanous shells, which distinguish the two families\r\nCircoporida (Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), is quite peculiar.\r\nNumerous fine siliceous spicules lie scattered irregularly in a finely\r\ngranular or porous matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n105. _Complete and Incomplete Lattice-Shells._--In the great majority of\r\nRadiolaria (in all four legions) the skeleton has the form of a delicate\r\nlattice-shell or a receptacle in which the central capsule is enclosed. In\r\na small minority, however, this is not the case. The skeleton then consists\r\nonly of isolated rigid pieces (radial or tangential spicules), or of a\r\nsimple ring (sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#), or of a basal tripod with\r\nor without a loose tissue of trabeculæ, &c. (#Plectoidea#); the central\r\ncapsule is then not surrounded by a special latticed receptacle, but only\r\nrests upon the skeletal trabeculæ. According to these different\r\narrangements, two principal groups or sublegions may be distinguished in\r\neach legion, of which one set (Cataphracta) are characterised by a complete\r\n{lxxii}lattice-shell, whilst the others (Aphracta) are without it. The\r\nRADIOLARIA APHRACTA, then, or Radiolaria without a complete skeleton, are\r\nthe #Collodaria# (p. 9), the #Acanthometra# (p. 725), the #Plectellaria#\r\n(p. 895), and the #Phæocystina# (p. 1543). On the other hand, the\r\nRADIOLARIA CATAPHRACTA, or Radiolaria with a complete skeleton, are the\r\n#Sphærellaria# (p. 49), the #Acanthophracta# (p. 791), the #Cyrtellaria#\r\n(p. 1015), and the #Phæocoscina# (p. 1590).\r\n\r\n  Upon this basis the first subdivision of the Radiolaria was made by\r\n  Johannes Müller, who recognised three groups:--\"I. _Thalassicolla_,\r\n  without receptacle, naked or with spicules; II. _Polycystina_, with a\r\n  siliceous receptacle; III. _Acanthometra_, without receptacle, but with\r\n  siliceous radial spines\" (L. N. 12, p. 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n106. _The Ectolithia and Entolithia (Extracapsular and Intracapsular\r\nSkeletons)._--The relation of the skeleton to the central capsule in the\r\nRadiolaria is very various in many respects; in the first instance two\r\ngreat groups, _Ectolithia_ and _Entolithia_ (see note A), may be\r\ndistinguished topographically by mere external observation; in the former\r\nthe skeleton lies entirely outside the central capsule; in the latter,\r\npartially at all events, within it. The _Ectolithia_, with a completely\r\nextracapsular skeleton, include all NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, as well as a\r\ngreat part of the SPUMELLARIA (all #Collodaria# and the most archaic forms\r\nof #Sphærellaria#); the _Entolithia_, on the other hand, in which the\r\nskeleton lies partly within, partly without the central capsule, include\r\nall ACANTHARIA and the majority of the SPUMELLARIA (most #Sphærellaria#,\r\nsee note B).\r\n\r\n  A. The difference between Ectolithia and Entolithia was applied in my\r\n  Monograph in 1862 (p. 222) to separate the Monocyttaria into two main\r\n  groups. The arrangement was, however, quite artificial, being contrary to\r\n  the natural relations of the larger groups, as was shown seventeen years\r\n  later by the discovery of the different structural relations of the\r\n  central capsule.\r\n\r\n  B. Among the ACANTHARIA, which all possess primitively an intracapsular\r\n  and centrogenous skeleton, the remarkable _Cenocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 11),\r\n  seems to furnish the single exception; in it the skeleton consists of a\r\n  simple spherical shell which encloses the concentric central capsule. The\r\n  exception is, however, only apparent; the twenty perspinal pores of the\r\n  shell show that they were originally in connection with twenty\r\n  centrogenous acanthin spines, and that those have disappeared by\r\n  retrograde metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n107. _Perigenous and Centrogenous Skeletons._--Much more important than the\r\ntopographical relation of the skeleton to the central capsule, according to\r\nwhich the Ectolithia and Entolithia are separated from each other (§ 106),\r\nis the original development of the skeleton within or without the central\r\ncapsule, which gives rise to the distinction between perigenous and\r\ncentrogenous skeletons. _Centrogenous skeletons_ are found only in the\r\nACANTHARIA, which are further distinguished from all other Radiolaria by\r\ntheir skeleton being formed of acanthin; in all ACANTHARIA the formation of\r\nthe skeleton begins in the middle of the central capsule, from which twenty\r\n(the number is inconstant only in the {lxxiii}small group #Actinelida#)\r\nradial spines are centrifugally developed. The three other legions, on the\r\ncontrary, possess on the whole a _perigenous_ skeleton, which _originally_\r\ndevelops outside the central capsule and never in its middle. In the\r\nNASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA the skeleton retains this extracapsular position,\r\nas also in the #Beloidea# and part of the #Sphærellaria# among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA; in the great majority of the latter, however, the primary\r\nperigenous skeleton is subsequently enveloped by the growing central\r\ncapsule, so that it lies partially within it (§ 109).\r\n\r\n\r\n108. _Polyphyletic Origin of the Skeleton._--The skeleton of the Radiolaria\r\nhas undoubtedly originated polyphyletically, for it is impossible to derive\r\nits manifold varieties from a single ground-form, or to regard them as\r\nmodifications of one type. It is much more probable that the different\r\nskeletonless Radiolaria have entered upon different ways of skeleton\r\nformation quite independently of each other. At the outset it is quite\r\nclear that the skeletons of the _four legions have originated independently\r\nof each other_. Further, it is certain that within the legion of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA the Beloid skeletons of the #Collodaria# are not connected with\r\nthe Sphæroid skeletons of the #Sphærellaria# and the forms derived from\r\nthem (see § 109). In the same way the skeletons of the PHÆODARIA are\r\npolyphyletic; probably in this legion the Beloid, Sphæroid, Cyrtoid, and\r\nConchoid skeletons have been developed quite independently (see § 112). In\r\nthe NASSELLARIA, on the other hand, it is possible that all the skeletal\r\nforms are to be derived monophyletically from a single simple primitive\r\nform (either the sagittal ring or basal tripod?) (see § 111). Still more\r\nprobable is it that the ACANTHARIA have arisen monophyletically, for all\r\nthe forms of their acanthin skeleton may be derived without violence from\r\n_Actinelius_ (see § 110).\r\n\r\n\r\n109. _The Skeleton of the Spumellaria._--The skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA\r\nor PERIPYLEA consist of silica, and are very different and of independent\r\norigin in the two orders of this legion. The first order, #Collodaria#,\r\nhave either no skeleton whatever (#Colloidea#, p. 10, Pls. 1, 3), or their\r\nskeleton is _Beloid_, a loose extracapsular envelope of spicules,\r\nconsisting of numerous unconnected portions; the separate parts are usually\r\ndisposed tangentially, either as simple or compound siliceous spicules\r\n(#Beloidea#, p. 28, Pls. 2, 4). The second order of SPUMELLARIA, on the\r\nother hand (#Sphærellaria#, p. 49), develops a siliceous lattice-shell\r\nwhich consists of a single piece, and is remarkable for the extraordinary\r\nvariety of its forms (pp. 50-715, Pls. 5-50). To this order belong not less\r\nthan three hundred genera and seventeen hundred species of the Challenger\r\nRadiolaria (that is, about two-fifths of all the genera and species). In\r\nspite of this extreme richness in different forms this large group must be\r\nregarded as _monophyletic_, since all its forms may be quite naturally\r\nderived from a common stem-form, a _simple lattice-sphere_ (_Cenosphæra_,\r\np. 61, Pl. 2). The twenty-eight families of #Sphærellaria# may be\r\ndistributed in four suborders, among which the #Sphæroidea# constitute the\r\n{lxxiv}stem-forms, since they retain the original spherical shape (Pls.\r\n5-8, 11-30). In the other three suborders a vertical main axis is\r\ndeveloped, which in #Prunoidea# is longer, in #Discoidea# shorter than the\r\nother axes of the shell. Hence the shell of the #Prunoidea# (p. 284, Pls.\r\n13, _bis_, 17, 39, 40) is ellipsoidal or cylindrical, that of the\r\n#Discoidea#, on the other hand, lenticular or discoidal (p. 402, Pls.\r\n31-38, 41-48). Finally, the shell of the fourth suborder, #Larcoidea#, is\r\nlentelliptical; it has the ground-form of a triaxial ellipsoid, and is\r\ncharacterised by the possession of three unequal dimensive axes, or three\r\nisopolar axes of different lengths perpendicular to each other (p. 599,\r\nPls. 9, 10, 49, 50).\r\n\r\n\r\n110. _The Skeleton of the Acantharia._--The skeletons of the ACANTHARIA or\r\nACTIPYLEA are distinguished from those of all other Radiolaria by two very\r\nimportant peculiarities; in the first place, they consist not of silica but\r\nof a peculiar organic substance, _Acanthin_, and secondly, their\r\ndevelopment is centrogenous, numerous radial spines or acanthin spicules\r\nbeing formed which are united in the middle of the central capsule. Hence\r\nthe ACANTHARIA are the only Radiolaria in which the skeleton originates\r\nfrom the first in the middle of the central capsule. The number of radial\r\nspines is primitively indefinite, variable, and often considerable (more\r\nthan a hundred), but in the great majority it is limited to twenty. In\r\naccordance with this the legion may be divided into two orders, the more\r\narchaic small group Adelacantha, with an indefinite number of spines, and\r\nthe more recent group, Icosacantha, which has been developed from them and\r\npossesses twenty regularly disposed spines; of the three hundred and\r\nseventy-two species of ACANTHARIA which have been hitherto described, about\r\nfive per cent. belong to the former, about ninety-five per cent. to the\r\nlatter division (see note A, below). The numerous genera of Icosacantha may\r\nthen be again divided into two suborders, of which the #Acanthonida# (p.\r\n740, Pls. 130-132) produce no complete lattice-shell, and thus agree with\r\nthe #Actinelida#, with which they may be united as #Acanthometra# in the\r\nbroader sense (or ACANTHARIA without a lattice-shell). The\r\n#Acanthophracta#, on the other hand (p. 791, Pls. 133-140), produce a\r\ncomplete lattice-shell, usually by means of two opposite or four crossed\r\ntransverse processes, which arise from each radial spine and unite with\r\neach other (see note B, below). In most #Acanthophracta# the lattice-shell\r\nremains single; only in the Phractopeltida does it consist of two\r\nconcentric lattice-spheres (p. 847, Pl. 133, figs. 1-6). Furthermore, the\r\nwhole order #Acanthophracta# may be subdivided into two suborders according\r\nto the different ground-form of the lattice-shell; this remains spherical\r\nin the #Sphærophracta# (the three families Sphærocapsida, Dorataspida,\r\nPhractopeltida, Pls. 133-138). On the other hand, it assumes another form\r\nin the #Prunophracta#; it becomes ellipsoidal in the Belonaspida (Pl. 136,\r\nfigs. 6-9), discoidal or lentiform in the Hexalaspida (Pl. 139); and\r\nfinally takes the shape of a double cone in the Diploconida (Pl. 140).\r\n\r\n  {lxxv}A.  The group Adelacantha consists only of the suborder\r\n  #Actinelida#, with the three families Astrolophida, Litholophida, and\r\n  Chiastolida (p. 728, Pl. 129, figs. 1-3); the number of the radial spines\r\n  is very different and variable, sometimes only from ten to sixteen, but\r\n  usually from thirty to fifty, and often more than one hundred; they are\r\n  generally irregularly distributed, and not as in the second main\r\n  division. This latter, the Icosacantha, always possesses _twenty_ radial\r\n  spines, which are regularly disposed according to a constant law, the\r\n  so-called \"Müllerian\" or \"Icosacanthan\" law; the twenty spines are always\r\n  so placed between the poles of a spineless axis that they form five zones\r\n  each of four spines; the four spines of each zone are equidistant from\r\n  each other, and also from the same pole, and alternate with those of the\r\n  neighbouring zones, so that the whole twenty lie in four meridian planes,\r\n  which cut out an angle of 45° (compare pp. 717-722, Pls. 130-140). In\r\n  spite of the manifold variations in form which are developed in the\r\n  Icosacantha, they may all be derived from a common stem-form,\r\n  _Acanthometron_ (p. 742), since the law of distribution of the twenty\r\n  spines is constantly inherited.\r\n\r\n  B.  An exception is found in the peculiar family Sphærocapsida (p. 797,\r\n  Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135, figs. 6-10). Here the shell is composed of\r\n  innumerable small, perforated plates, which arise on the surface of the\r\n  calymma independently of the spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n111. _The Skeleton of the Nassellaria._--The skeletons of the NASSELLARIA\r\nor MONOPYLEA consist of silica, and are never composed of separate\r\nportions, but constitute always a single continuous piece. The ground-form\r\nis originally monaxon, corresponding to that of the central capsule, with a\r\nconstant difference between the two poles of the vertical main axis. The\r\nground-form is never spherical or polyaxon as in the lattice-shells of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and the skeleton never consists of hollow tubes, as in the\r\nPHÆODARIA. The legion NASSELLARIA may be divided into two orders; in the\r\n#Plectellaria# (three suborders #Nassoidea#, #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#)\r\nthe skeleton does not form a complete lattice-shell; in the #Cyrtellaria#,\r\non the other hand, which are derived from these, the siliceous skeleton\r\nforms a complete lattice-shell enclosing the central capsule. The number of\r\nforms thus developed is astonishingly great, so that among the NASSELLARIA\r\nno less than two hundred and seventy-four genera and sixteen hundred and\r\neighty-seven species may be distinguished, almost as many as in the\r\n#Sphærellaria#. In spite of this great variety of forms the legion\r\nMONOPYLEA is probably monophyletic; at least all the different skeletal\r\nforms may be derived from three elements which are combined in the most\r\nmanifold fashion; (1) the _sagittal ring_, a simple siliceous ring, which\r\nlies vertically in the sagittal plane of the body, encircles the central\r\ncapsule and comes into contact with it at the basal pole of the main axis\r\n(§ 124); (2) the _basal or oral tripod_, composed of three diverging radial\r\nspines, which meet in the middle of the basal pole of the central capsule\r\n(or in the centre of the porochora) (§ 125); (3) the _cephalis_, or\r\nlattice-head, a simple ovoid or subspherical lattice-shell, which encloses\r\nthe central capsule and stands in connection with it at the basal pole of\r\nits main axis. Any one of these three important structural elements of the\r\nNASSELLARIAN skeleton may possibly be the starting-point {lxxvi}for all the\r\nremaining forms of the MONOPYLEA; the great difficulty in their\r\nphylogenetic derivation lies in the facts that, on the one hand, any one of\r\nthe three elements may alone constitute the skeleton, and on the other\r\nhand, in the great majority of the legion, two or three are united together\r\n(compare §§ 182-185).\r\n\r\n\r\n112. _The Skeleton of the Phæodaria._--The skeleton of the PHÆODARIA or\r\nCANNOPYLEA is always extracapsular, usually consists of a silicate of\r\ncarbon (more rarely of pure silica), and in the majority of the legion is\r\ncomposed of hollow cylindrical tubes, whose siliceous wall is very thin,\r\nand whose lumen is filled with gelatinous material (§ 127). The manifold\r\nand remarkable skeletal forms occurring in this legion are not\r\nmonophyletic, since they cannot be derived from a common stem-form; they\r\nare, on the contrary, polyphyletic, various skeletonless PHÆODARIA\r\n(Phæodinida) have independently acquired skeletons of different form and\r\ncomposition. The legion PHÆODARIA can be subdivided into four orders, the\r\nskeletons of which present the following important distinctions:--(1) The\r\n#Phæocystina# possess only incomplete Beloid skeletons (§ 115), composed of\r\nmany separate pieces, sometimes tangentially (Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101),\r\nsometimes radially arranged (Aulacanthida, Pls. 102-105). (2) The\r\n#Phæosphæria# form Sphæroid skeletons (§ 116), usually only a simple\r\nlattice-shell without special aperture (Pls. 106-111); two concentric\r\nshells united by radial bars occur only in the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112). (3)\r\nThe #Phæogromia# are distinguished by the formation of a simple Cyrtoid\r\nskeleton (§ 123) resembling that of the Monocyrtida; the monothalamus\r\nlattice-shell is usually ovoid or helmet-shaped, more rarely polyhedral or\r\nalmost spherical; a vertical main axis can always be distinguished, at the\r\nbasal pole of which is an aperture usually armed with teeth or spines (Pls.\r\n99, 100, 113-120). (4) The #Phæoconchia# are distinguished from all other\r\nRadiolaria by the possession of a bivalved shell like that of the\r\nConchifera; the two valves of this Conchoid skeleton must be distinguished\r\nas dorsal and ventral, as in the Brachiopoda (Pls. 121-128). The fifteen\r\nfamilies of PHÆODARIA which are arranged in the four orders just mentioned,\r\npresent such great differences among themselves, that the skeleton must be\r\nregarded as probably polyphyletic even within the limits of each order.\r\n\r\n\r\n113. _Types of Skeletal Formation._--No less than twelve different\r\nprincipal forms may be distinguished as morphological types of the\r\nformation of the skeleton in the Radiolaria; some of these are peculiar to\r\na single legion or even to a smaller group; but sometimes the same form\r\noccurs in several legions. Some types occur only in an isolated manner,\r\nindependently of the others, but most exist in various combinations with\r\nother types. Of the twelve described below the Conchoid and Cannoid occur\r\nonly in the PHÆODARIA; the Plectoid and Circoid only in the NASSELLARIA;\r\nthe Astroid only in the ACANTHARIA; the remaining seven types are found in\r\nseveral legions in the same form and hence are polyphyletic.\r\n\r\n\r\n{lxxvii}114. _The Astroid Skeleton._--Under the name \"Astroid\" we place the\r\npeculiar star-shaped skeletons of the ACANTHARIA in opposition to those of\r\nall other Radiolaria, for they are separated from them not only\r\nfundamentally by reason of the chemical nature of their substance\r\n(Acanthin, § 102), but also by their centrogenous origin, and the resulting\r\nstellate form (Pls. 129-140). The ACANTHARIA are the only Radiolaria in\r\nwhich the skeleton arises within the central capsule by the formation of\r\nnumerous rays or radial spines of acanthin which project on all sides from\r\nthe centre. Originally these are united at this point, their conical or\r\npyramidal points meeting and being supported one upon another. In the great\r\nmajority of ACANTHARIA this loose apposition is constant, so that when the\r\nsoft parts are destroyed the skeleton falls to pieces. Only in a few forms\r\nin this legion are the central ends of the spines fused so that the whole\r\nskeleton forms a connected star (_Astrolithium_). The small group\r\nChiastolida (or Acanthochiasmida) is characterised by the fact that the two\r\nrays which are opposite to one another in each axis unite and form a\r\ndiametral bar. The skeleton is almost always composed of twenty radial\r\nspines, which are regularly disposed (Icosacantha), only in the small\r\nprimitive group #Actinelida# is the number variable (Adelacantha, § 110).\r\n\r\n\r\n115. _The Beloid Skeleton._--As Beloid or spicular skeletons are grouped\r\ntogether all those which consist of several disconnected portions; these\r\nalways lie outside the central capsule, either within the calymma or on its\r\nsurface. Such extracapsular Beloid skeletons are entirely wanting in the\r\nACANTHARIA and NASSELLARIA; they occur only in the #Beloidea# among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and in the #Phæocystina# among the PHÆODARIA; the individual\r\nBeloid portions of the former are solid, those of the latter hollow. In\r\nboth groups the simplest forms of the separate portions are simple\r\nunbranched needles (_Thalassosphæra_, _Thalassoplancta_, _Physematium_,\r\n_Belonozoum_, among the SPUMELLARIA; _Cannobelos_ and _Cannorrhaphis_ among\r\nthe PHÆODARIA); usually these spicules are disposed tangentially over the\r\nsurface of the calymma. Among the #Beloidea# branched spicules occur more\r\ncommonly than these simple ones; they are either stellate (with many rays\r\nunited in a centre) or twin-like, with a tangential bar, from each pole of\r\nwhich two or three (seldom more) radial branches project (Pls. 2, 4). Among\r\nthe PHÆODARIA the subfamily Dictyochida is characterised by the annular\r\nshape of its Beloid portions, either simple rings, or hat-shaped or\r\npyramidal bodies with a latticed cap over the ring (Pl. 101, figs. 3-14;\r\nPl. 114, figs. 7-13). The family Aulacanthida among the PHÆODARIA, alone\r\npossesses hollow _radial tubes_, which penetrate the whole calymma, and\r\nproject distally over its surface, whilst their proximal ends rest upon the\r\nsurface of the central capsule. Although in these cases the enclosed\r\nproximal end is always simple, the free distal end develops the most\r\nvarious processes in adaptation to its prehensile functions (Pls. 102-105).\r\n\r\n\r\n{lxxviii}116. _The Sphæroid Skeletons or Lattice-Spheres._--The\r\n\"lattice-spheres\" or sphæroid skeletons are the simplest and most primitive\r\nforms of lattice shells, and are widely distributed in the three legions\r\nSPUMELLARIA, ACANTHARIA, and PHÆODARIA, whilst they are entirely wanting in\r\nthe NASSELLARIA. The round lattice-shell is either a true sphere in the\r\ngeometrical sense, or an endospherical polyhedron, _i.e._, a polyhedron,\r\nall whose angles lie in the surface of a sphere (§ 25). In general,\r\n_primary_ and _secondary_ lattice-spheres may be distinguished, of which\r\nthe former are secreted on the outer surface of the primary, the latter on\r\nthat of the secondary calymma (§ 85). Furthermore, _simple_ and _compound_\r\nlattice-spheres may be distinguished, the latter of which consist of two or\r\nmore concentric lattice-spheres firmly united by radial bars; in such cases\r\nthe innermost lattice-sphere is always to be regarded as the oldest or\r\nprimary, all the succeeding ones as secondary, and the outermost as the\r\nyoungest (§ 129). The simple lattice-spheres are usually to be regarded as\r\nprimary; they may, however, occasionally be secondary, in which case the\r\nprimary shell, originally enclosed, has been lost by degeneration (as, for\r\nexample, in the case of the Aulosphærida and some #Sphærellaria#).\r\n\r\n\r\n117. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Spumellaria._--The lattice-spheres or\r\nSphæroid skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA exhibit in spite of their simple type\r\nof structure, an extraordinary variety in the formation of the lattice-work\r\nand radial apophyses, so that in the systematic portion of this work no\r\nless than one hundred and seven genera and six hundred and fifty species\r\nare distinguished; these are united in one suborder, the #Sphæroidea# (pp.\r\n50-284, Pls. 5-8, 11-30). It may be divided into two main divisions, the\r\n_Monosphærida_ with a single primary lattice-sphere (Pls. 12-14, 21, 26,\r\n27), and _Pliosphærida_ (or Sphæroidea concentrica) whose skeleton consists\r\nof two or more concentric lattice-spheres united by radial bars. The latter\r\nare subdivided into Dyosphærida with two concentric lattice-spheres (Pls.\r\n16, 19, 20, 22, 28); Triosphærida, with three spheres (Pls. 17, 24, 29);\r\nTetrasphærida, with four (Pls. 23, 30); Polysphærida, with five or more\r\n(Pls. 15, 23); and Spongosphærida, with spongy lattice-spheres (Pls. 18,\r\n25). A special group is made up of the simple lattice-spheres of the social\r\nCollosphærida (or Sphæroidea polyzoa) (Pls. 5-8); these are usually more or\r\nless irregular, and characterised by the development of peculiar tubular\r\nprocesses; the latter are generally wanting in the Sphæroidea monozoa,\r\nwhose lattice-shell is very regularly formed. This distinction is\r\ninteresting and important, inasmuch as the regular lattice-spheres are\r\nexplained by the independent development of the free-swimming Monozoa,\r\nwhilst the irregular spheres are due to the mutual dependence of the social\r\nPolyzoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n118. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Acantharia._--The lattice-shells or\r\nSphæroid skeletons of the ACANTHARIA are immediately distinguishable from\r\nthose of all other Radiolaria by their centrogenous development and the\r\ncentral union of the radial spines by which they are supported; the only\r\nexception is furnished by the remarkable genus _Cenocapsa_ {lxxix}(Pl. 133,\r\nfig. 11), in which the radial spines are absent, not primitively, however,\r\nbut in consequence of degeneration; for the twenty cross-shaped perspinal\r\npores, originally due to the twenty radial spines, are still present. In\r\nthe most nearly allied genera, _Porocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 7) and\r\n_Cannocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 8), the proximal part of the twenty radial\r\nspines is still present, while their distal portion has degenerated; hence\r\nin this case they do not stand in direct communication with the spherical\r\nshell. On the other hand, this primitive connection persists in the genera\r\n_Astrocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 9, 10), and _Sphærocapsa_ (Pl. 135, figs.\r\n6-10). The five genera just mentioned form the peculiar family\r\nSphærocapsida (pp. 795-802); the spherical shell is in these cases composed\r\nof very numerous small plates disposed like a pavement, each plate or aglet\r\nbeing perforated by a pore canal; in addition to which there are twenty\r\nlarger (perspinal) pores (or twenty cross-shaped groups each of four\r\naspinal pores) at those important points where primitively the twenty\r\nradial spines penetrate the calymma. This peculiar porous \"pavement shell\"\r\nhas probably been developed (independently of the twenty radial spines)\r\nupon the calymma of the #Acanthonida# (_Acanthonia_, p. 749) by the action\r\nof the sarcodictyum; it has, therefore, quite a different morphological\r\nsignificance from the spherical lattice-shell of the Dorataspida, which is\r\ncomposed of tangential apophyses of the twenty Acanthonid spines (pp.\r\n802-847, Pls. 134-138). Each radial spine here forms either two opposite or\r\nfour crossed transverse processes, and since their branches spread over the\r\nsurface of the spherical calymma and are united suturally at their\r\nextremities, the peculiar lattice-sphere of the Dorataspida arises. This\r\nextensive family is again divided into two subfamilies:--the Diporaspida\r\n(Pls. 137, 138) possess always only two opposite apophyses, and form by the\r\nunion of their branches two opposite primary apertures or aspinal meshes.\r\nThe Tessaraspida, on the other hand (Pls. 135, 138), have always four\r\ncrossed transverse processes, and form by their union four primary aspinal\r\nmeshes. From the Diporaspida are probably to be derived the Phractopeltida\r\n(p. 847, Pl. 133, figs. 1-6), the only ACANTHARIA which possess a double\r\nlattice-sphere; their double concentric spherical shell may be compared\r\nwith that of the Dyosphærida.\r\n\r\n\r\n119. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Phæodaria._--The lattice-spheres or\r\nSphæroid skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, which are generally developed quite\r\nregularly, though occasionally in a modified form, fall in the order\r\n#Phæosphæria# into two groups of very different structure, each of which\r\nincludes two families. The first group (_Phæosphæria inarticulata_)\r\ncontains the families Orosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) and Sagosphærida (Pl.\r\n108); the lattice-work of the former consists of irregular polygonal meshes\r\nand very coarse, partially hollow trabeculæ; in the latter, on the other\r\nhand, it consists of triangular meshes and very slender filiform trabeculæ;\r\nin both families the whole sphæroid skeleton forms a single unsegmented\r\npiece as in most #Sphæroidea#. In the second group of {lxxx}#Phæosphæria#\r\n(_Phæosphæria articulata_), on the other hand, the lattice-sphere is\r\nsegmented in quite a peculiar manner, and composed of hollow cylindrical\r\ntangential tubes, which are separated by astral septa at the nodal points\r\nof the network; this remarkable structure characterises the two families,\r\nAulosphærida (Pls. 109-111) and Cannosphærida (Pl. 112); the segmented\r\nlattice-sphere of the former is simple and hollow; while that of the latter\r\nis connected by centripetal radial tubes with a simple concentric inner\r\nshell, which is sometimes solid, sometimes latticed, and provided with a\r\nmain-opening corresponding to the astropyle of the enclosed central\r\ncapsule. Since in the Aulosphærida also, hollow centripetal radial tubes\r\nproject from the segmented lattice-sphere, it is possible that they have\r\nbeen derived from the Cannosphærida by the loss of the primitive internal\r\nshell. A special peculiarity of many #Phæosphæria# (_Oroscena_,\r\n_Sagoscena_, _Auloscena_, &c.) consists in the fact that the whole surface\r\nof the lattice-sphere is regularly covered with pyramidal or tent-shaped\r\nprominences (Pl. 106, fig. 4; Pl. 108, fig. 1; Pl. 110, fig. 1). A simple\r\nlattice-sphere quite similar to that of most Monosphærida also constitutes\r\nthe skeleton of the Castanellida (Pl. 113), but since it possesses a\r\nspecial main-opening, it must be referred promorphologically to the Cyrtoid\r\nshells of the #Phæogromia#.\r\n\r\n\r\n120. _The Prunoid Skeleton or Lattice-Ellipsoid._--The \"lattice-ellipsoids\"\r\nor Prunoid skeletons have arisen from the lattice-spheres or Sphæroid\r\nskeletons by more energetic growth and elongation of one axis; this is the\r\nmain axis of the body and is probably always vertical; its two poles are\r\ncommonly equal. The Prunoid skeleton is either a true ellipsoid in the\r\ngeometrical sense or an \"endellipsoidal polyhedron\" (_i.e._, a polyhedron,\r\nall the angles of which lie in an ellipsoidal surface). By further\r\nelongation of the main axis, the ellipsoidal form passes over into the\r\ncylindrical, the polar surfaces of the cylinder being usually rounded,\r\nrarely truncated. The rich order #Prunoidea# (pp. 284-402) contains\r\nnumerous modifications of this form of shell which arise on the one hand by\r\nthe formation of transverse constrictions, on the other by the apposition\r\nof concentric secondary shells. In respect of the latter, simple and\r\ncompound Prunoid shells can be distinguished as in the case of the Sphæroid\r\nshells. In the compound Prunoid shells either all the concentric\r\nlattice-shells may be ellipsoidal or the inner may be spherical. More\r\nimportant differences are found in the transverse annular constrictions,\r\nwhich give the Prunoid skeleton a segmented appearance; in this respect,\r\nthree principal forms may be distinguished (p. 288):--(A) _Monoprunida_,\r\nwith unsegmented shell, having no transverse constriction (Pls. 15-17); (B)\r\n_Dyoprunida_, having a shell with two segments and one (equatorial)\r\ntransverse constriction (Pl. 39); (C) _Polyprunida_, with three or more\r\nparallel transverse constrictions, by means of which the shell is divided\r\ninto four or more segments (Pl. 40). In the same manner as the #Prunoidea#\r\nhave arisen from the #Sphæroidea# among the SPUMELLARIA by greater\r\n{lxxxi}development of the vertical main axis, the ellipsoidal Belonaspida\r\nhave arisen from the spherical Dorataspida among the ACANTHARIA (p. 859;\r\nPl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9). The main axis of the ellipsoid in\r\nthis case is always occupied by the opposite equatorial spines of the\r\nhydrotomical axis (pp. 719, 860). In the legion PHÆODARIA a similar\r\nprolongation of the main axis rarely occurs; it is found, however, in\r\n_Aulatractus_ (Pl. 111, figs. 6, 7), the lattice-shell of this Aulosphærid\r\nbeing sometimes truly fusiform, sometimes rather ellipsoidal or even\r\ndouble-conical.\r\n\r\n\r\n121. _The Discoid Skeletons or Lattice-Discs._--The \"lattice-discs\" or\r\nDiscoid skeletons are characteristic of the SPUMELLARIAN group #Discoidea#,\r\nand have arisen from the lattice-spheres of the #Sphæroidea# by a less\r\ndevelopment of one axis, which is the main axis of the body, and is\r\nprobably usually vertical; its two poles are always equal. The Discoid\r\nlattice-shell is either a biconvex lens (with a thin margin), or a plane\r\ndisc (a shortened cylinder with thick margin), or some form intermediate\r\nbetween the two. All Discoid shells show a horizontal median plane or\r\nequatorial plane, by which they are divided into two equal halves, an upper\r\nand lower; the margin of the lens itself is originally the equator. The\r\nmain axis, the shortest of all the axes of the shell, stands vertically in\r\nthe centre of the equatorial plane. Among the PHÆODARIA Discoid shells\r\nrarely occur (_Aulophacus_), as also among the ACANTHARIA (Hexalaspida).\r\n\r\n\r\n122. _The Larcoid Skeleton or Lentelliptical Lattice-Shell._--The\r\nlentelliptical lattice-shells, which may be shortly designated \"Larcoid,\"\r\nare especially characteristic of the #Larcoidea#, a large order of\r\nSPUMELLARIA (pp. 599-715; Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50). In addition they recur among\r\nthe ACANTHARIA, in the small family Hexalaspida (p. 872, Pl. 139), and the\r\nfamily Diploconida (p. 881, Pl. 140), which is derived from it. These\r\nlentelliptical lattice-shells are all characterised by the clear\r\ndifferentiation of three unequal, but isopolar dimensive axes, _i.e._, the\r\nthree geometrical axes, perpendicular to one another, which determine the\r\nform of the shell, are of unequal length; the two poles of each are,\r\nhowever, equal. The geometrical ground-form is, therefore, a triaxial\r\nellipsoid (§ 34). In the rich order #Larcoidea# the lentelliptical\r\nlattice-shell shows many variations in its development.\r\n\r\n\r\n123. _The Cyrtoid Skeleton._--Cyrtoid skeletons are those lattice-shells\r\nwhich possess a vertical main axis with two different poles (Monaxonia\r\nallopola); the upper pole is usually termed the apical, the lower the\r\nbasal. Such Cyrtoid shells are characteristic of the great majority of the\r\nNASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA (and especially of the #Cyrtellaria#); they are\r\nalso found in a large division of the PHÆODARIA (the #Phæogromia#), and in\r\nsome SPUMELLARIA. In general the manifold Cyrtoid shells may be divided\r\ninto two large groups, those with one and those with several chambers. The\r\n_monothalamous_ Cyrtoid shells are usually ovoid, conical, cap- or\r\nhelmet-shaped; their {lxxxii}internal cavity is simple, without\r\nconstrictions or septa. Among the NASSELLARIA they occur in the Monocyrtida\r\n(Pls. 51-54, 98), where they have received the name \"Cephalis.\" A form of\r\nshell, essentially the same, is found amongst the PHÆODARIA in the order\r\n#Phæogromia#, more especially in the Challengerida (Pl. 99), Medusettida\r\n(Pls. 118-120), and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), many of these latter closely\r\nresembling many Monocyrtida. Such monothalamous Cyrtoid shells occur much\r\nmore rarely among the SPUMELLARIA (_e.g._, among the #Prunoidea# in\r\n_Lithapium_, _Lithomespilus_, _Druppatractus_, Pls. 13, 14, &c.).\r\nPolythalamous Cyrtoid shells (Pls. 55-80) occur exclusively in the\r\nNASSELLARIA, and exhibit in this legion an astonishing variety of\r\nstructure; they are distinguished from the monothalamous forms by the\r\ndevelopment of internal septa, or of annular incomplete diaphragms, which\r\nusually correspond to the external constrictions; their interior is thus\r\ndivided into two or more communicating compartments. Among the\r\npolythalamous Cyrtoid shells may be distinguished three principal groups,\r\nthe Stichocyrtid, Zygocyrtid, and Polycyrtid. Zygocyrtid shells are\r\ncharacteristic of the #Spyroidea# (Pls. 84-90), and are distinguished by a\r\nbilobate cephalis (cephalis bilocularis); the median sagittal ring, or a\r\ncorresponding constriction, divides the shell into right and left\r\ncompartments. Polycyrtid shells (Pl. 96) are peculiar to the #Botryodea#,\r\nand characterised by a multilobate cephalis (cephalis multilocularis).\r\nStichocyrtid shells are those in which the primary cephalis remains simple,\r\nand new joints are successively added to its basal pole; such shells occur\r\nin the majority of the #Cyrtoidea#. Secondary chambers are sometimes added\r\nin the other two groups (#Botryodea# and #Spyroidea#). When, as often\r\nhappens in these polythalamous Cyrtoid shells, two or three distinct joints\r\nfollow each other, the first is called the \"cephalis,\" the second the\r\n\"thorax,\" and the third the \"abdomen\" (Tricyrtida Pls. 64-75).\r\n\r\n\r\n124. _The Circoid Skeleton._--This is a very important and remarkable type\r\nof skeletal formation, which occurs exclusively in the legion NASSELLARIA,\r\nwhere it plays a very prominent part; its characteristic element is the\r\n\"sagittal ring,\" a simple, vertical, siliceous ring, which surrounds the\r\ncentral capsule in its sagittal plane, and is specially differentiated in\r\nits basal portion. This \"primary sagittal ring\" whose vertical allopolar\r\nmain axis coincides with that of the Monopylean central capsule embraced by\r\nit, is characteristic of all members of the order #Stephoidea# (p. 931,\r\nPls. 81-83, 92-94); here it forms by itself the skeleton of the Stephanida\r\n(Pl. 81); in the Semantida (Pl. 92) it is combined with a horizontal basal\r\nring, in the Coronida (Pls. 82, 93) with a vertical frontal ring and in the\r\nTympanida (Pls. 83, 94) with two horizontal rings, an upper mitral and a\r\nlower basal. In the great majority of these #Stephoidea# there often\r\ndevelop in definite places characteristic processes or apophyses, whose\r\nbranches combine to form a loose tissue or an incomplete lattice-shell.\r\nThis becomes complete in the #Cyrtellaria#, the majority of which retain\r\nmore or less {lxxxiii}distinct traces of the sagittal ring. Hence the\r\nskeletons of all NASSELLARIA may be derived monophyletically (Hypothesis A,\r\np. 893) from a simple sagittal ring (_Archicircus_ and _Lithocircus_, Pl.\r\n81). This theory, however, encounters the great difficulty that in many\r\n#Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, &c.) it is combined in a remarkable\r\nmanner with the basal tripod of the #Plectoidea#, whilst in these latter it\r\nis entirely wanting (compare p. 894).\r\n\r\n\r\n125. _The Plectoid Skeleton._--Those forms are distinguished as Plectoid in\r\nwhich three, four, or more radial siliceous spines proceed from a common\r\npoint, which lies excentrically outside the central capsule and at the\r\nbasal pole of its vertical allopolar main axis. This peculiar type of\r\nskeletal formation only occurs in the legion NASSELLARIA, and is specially\r\ncharacteristic of the order #Plectoidea# (p. 898, Pl. 91). But since the\r\nessential elements of this remarkable skeleton also occur in many other\r\nNASSELLARIA, sometimes combined with the Circoid, sometimes with the\r\nCyrtoid skeleton, it perhaps has a fundamental significance in this legion;\r\nat all events it is possible to derive monophyletically all the other forms\r\nof this legion from it (Hypothesis B, p. 893). The simplest form of the\r\nPlectoid skeleton is a tripod, the three feet of which either lie in a\r\nhorizontal plane (_Triplagia_, Pl. 91, fig. 2), or correspond to the three\r\nedges of a low pyramid (_Plagiacantha_). A fourth ray is sometimes added,\r\nwhich stands vertically upon the summit of the pyramid (_Plagoniscus_,\r\n_Plagiocarpa_, Pl. 91, figs. 4, 5). In other #Plectoidea# three secondary\r\nrays are intercalated between the three primary (Hexaplagida, &c.); seldom\r\nthe number is greatly increased (Polyplagida, &c.). The rays are rarely\r\nsimple, but usually branched; in the Plagonida (Pl. 91, figs. 2-6) the\r\nbranches remain free; in the Plectanida (Pl. 91, figs. 7-13) they are\r\nunited to form a loose wicker-work. From such a web a perfect Cyrtoid shell\r\nmay arise. Several forms of Plagonida may also be readily confounded with\r\nthe isolated triradiate or quadriradiate spicula of many Beloid skeletons\r\n(_Sphærozoum_, _Lampoxanthium_, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n126. _The Spongoid Skeleton._--From the simple lattice-skeleton which the\r\nmajority of Radiolaria possess, some of them develop a spongy shell; the\r\ntrabeculæ of the lattice-work, situated in one plane in the former, are\r\ndeveloped in the latter in different planes and cross irregularly in all\r\ndirections; thus arises a kind of wicker-work of more or less spongy\r\nstructure, usually with very thin trabeculæ and irregular meshes. Such\r\nSpongoid shells are most common among the SPUMELLARIA, especially in the\r\n#Sphæroidea# (Spongosphærida, Pl. 18) and #Discoidea# (Spongodiscida, Pls.\r\n41-47), more rarely in the #Prunoidea# and #Larcoidea#. Lattice-work of\r\nsimilar spongy structure occurs very seldom among the NASSELLARIA, _e.g._,\r\nin some #Plectoidea# (Pl. 91) and #Cyrtoidea# (_Spongocyrtis_,\r\n_Spongopyramis_, _Spongomelissa_, &c., Pl. 56, fig. 10; Pl. 64, figs. 5-10,\r\n&c.). Among the PHÆODARIA spongy skeletons are very rare; they {lxxxiv}are\r\nto be seen in some #Phæosphæria# (_Oroplegma_, Pl. 107, fig. 1;\r\n_Sagoplegma_, Pl. 108, fig. 2; _Auloplegma_, Pl. 111, fig. 8). No Spongoid\r\nskeletons are known among the ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. _The Cannoid Skeleton._--Cannoid or tubular skeletons are those which\r\nare composed of hollow tubes; they occur exclusively in the PHÆODARIA or\r\nCANNOPYLEA. Tubular processes, nevertheless, occur in some other\r\nRadiolaria, as, for example, among the SPUMELLARIA in a portion of the\r\nCollosphærida (_Siphonosphæra_, _Caminosphæra_, Pls. 6, 7), and of the\r\n#Prunoidea# (_Pipetta_, _Cannartus_, &c., Pl. 39, figs. 6-10, &c.), also\r\namong the NASSELLARIA in _Theosyringium_ (Pl. 68, figs. 4-6), _Cannobotrys_\r\n(Pl. 96, figs. 3, 4, 8-11, 20-22), &c. In all these cases, however, the\r\ntubes are direct processes of the cavity of the shell, the trabeculæ of the\r\nlattice-work being solid. Only in the CANNOPYLEA are the lattice-bars\r\nthemselves, the radial spines and appendicular organs, generally tubular\r\n(hence the designation \"Pansolenia\"). The lumen of the thin-walled\r\nsiliceous tubes is filled with jelly, and hence the specific gravity of the\r\nrelatively large skeleton is considerably diminished. This peculiarity is\r\nnot found in all CANNOPYLEA; it is wanting in all Sagosphærida and\r\nConcharida, as well as in a part of the Orosphærida and Castanellida; in\r\nthe latter there are found intermediate stages between hollow and solid\r\nskeletal rods. Very often a fine siliceous thread runs in the axis of the\r\ntubes, which is connected with its wall by lateral branches (Pl. 110, figs.\r\n4, 6; Pl. 115, figs. 6, 7). More seldom the tubes are divided by horizontal\r\nsepta into a series of chambers (Medusettida, Pls. 118-120). The two\r\nfamilies Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111) and Cannosphærida (Pl. 112) are\r\ndistinguished from all other PHÆODARIA by the fact that their tubes are\r\nseparated by astral septa in the nodal points of the lattice-shell (§§ 112,\r\n134).\r\n\r\n\r\n128. _The Conchoid Skeleton._--By the name \"Conchoid skeletons\" are\r\ndistinguished the bivalved lattice-shells which occur exclusively in the\r\nlegion PHÆODARIA; they are quite characteristic of the #Phæoconchia# or\r\n_Phæodaria bivalvia_, which embrace three families:--Concharida (Pls.\r\n123-125), Coelodendrida (Pls. 121, 122), and Coelographida (Pls. 126-128).\r\nThe two valves of the lattice-shell of the Concharida are simple,\r\nhemispherical, or boat-shaped, whilst in the Coelodendrida and\r\nCoelographida tubes grow out from them, which branch and usually give rise\r\nby anastomosis to a second external bivalved shell. In all #Phæoconchia#\r\nthe two valves are so disposed about the central capsule that an open slit\r\nremains between them, into which open the apertures of the central capsule;\r\nand since all these _Phæodaria conchoidea_ are TRIPYLEA, with three typical\r\nopenings in the central capsule, and since the two lateral accessory\r\nopenings lie at either side of the aboral pole, and the unpaired\r\nmain-opening at the oral pole of the main axis, it follows that the two\r\nvalves are to be regarded as dorsal and ventral as in the Brachiopoda (not\r\nright and left as in the Lamellibranchiata). The dorsal and ventral\r\n{lxxxv}valves are usually equal, but in a portion of the Concharida they\r\npresent constant differences. In this family the two valves are attached to\r\neach other by their free edges, just as in the bivalved Mollusca and\r\nDiatoms; and these edges may either be smooth (Conchasmida, Pl. 123, figs.\r\n1-6), or dentate (Conchopsida, Pls. 124, 125); the valvular connection of\r\nthe latter is sometimes strengthened by a special ligament which unites the\r\ntwo valves at the aboral pole (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9). The form of the valve\r\nis sometimes hemispherical, sometimes boat-shaped, with a sagittal keel.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. _Medullary and Conical Shells._--In all Radiolaria whose skeleton\r\nconsists of a double shell or of two concentric lattice-shells united by\r\nradial bars, an inner medullary shell (testa medullaris) and an outer\r\ncortical shell (testa corticalis) may be distinguished (see note A, below).\r\nThe medullary shell is usually to be regarded as a primary, the cortical as\r\na secondary structure. Such double shells occur among the SPUMELLARIA in\r\nthe Dyosphærida (Pls. 19, 20), as well as in many #Prunoidea# (Pls. 39,\r\n40), #Discoidea# (Pls. 33, 34), and #Larcoidea# (Pls. 9, 10); among the\r\nACANTHARIA only in the family Phractopeltida (Pl. 133); among the\r\nNASSELLARIA only in very few #Cyrtoidea# (_e.g._, _Periarachnium_, Pl. 55,\r\nfig. 11), and finally among the PHÆODARIA in the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112) as\r\nwell as in part of the Coelodendrida (Pl. 121) and Coelographida (Pls. 127,\r\n128). In most cases (if not always?) the cortical shell arises by the\r\ngrowth of radial spines from the surface of the medullary shell; these\r\nbecome united at equal distances from the centre by transverse apophyses,\r\nthe surface of the secondary calymma furnishing the basis for their\r\nsecretion (§ 85). Nevertheless, it seems that in many #Sphærellaria# the\r\nformation of the whole cortical shell proceeds simultaneously (at a\r\ndefinite dictyotic period) like that of the primary medullary shell (see\r\nnote B). Whilst in the PHÆODARIA, ACANTHARIA, and NASSELLARIA, at most two\r\nconcentric shells are formed, in many SPUMELLARIA their number increases\r\ncontinuously with additional growth; in many #Sphærellaria# it rises to\r\nfour, eight, or even more, as well as in many #Discoidea# (if the\r\nconcentric, peripherally disposed rings of chambers be regarded as\r\nincomplete flattened shells). In these cases either only the innermost\r\nprimary lattice-shell is to be styled \"medullary shell,\" or at most the two\r\ninnermost (inner and outer medullary shells), all the others being\r\ncortical.\r\n\r\n  A. The distinction between medullary and cortical shells was originally\r\n  based in my Monograph (1862, p. 50) upon the topographical relation of\r\n  the lattice-shells to the central capsule, inasmuch as I regarded all\r\n  intracapsular shells as medullary, all extracapsular as cortical.\r\n  Hertwig, however (1879, p. 122), rightly pointed out that this\r\n  distinction is unpractical, \"because the same lattice-shell in the same\r\n  species may lie within or without the central capsule, according to the\r\n  size of the latter.\" He proposes, therefore, to restrict the term\r\n  medullary shell to the innermost, and to call all the others cortical; a\r\n  course which seems justified by the special significance of the primary\r\n  innermost lattice-shell (\"as the point of origin of the radial spines\").\r\n  But in most #Sphærellaria# which form three or more concentric shells,\r\n  the two innermost, which lie near together within the {lxxxvi}central\r\n  capsule, are very different in size and dictyosis from all the others\r\n  which lie outside, and are separated by wider interspaces (compare Pls.\r\n  17, 24, 29-32, 40, &c.). In these cases it appears better to regard the\r\n  two inner as inner and outer medullary shells, and all the others as\r\n  cortical shells. The character of the dictyosis in the intracapsular and\r\n  extracapsular shells is often so different that I have made it the basis\r\n  of separation of _Thecosphæra_ and _Rhodosphæra_ among the Liosphærida\r\n  (p. 60), of Elatommatida and Diplosphærida among the Astrosphærida (p.\r\n  208), &c.\r\n\r\n  B.--R. Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33, pp. 40, 123) separates the true\r\n  (simultaneously formed) \"cortical shells\" (_e.g._, of _Actinomma_,\r\n  _Cromyomma_) from the arachnoid \"siliceous networks\" (_e.g._, of\r\n  _Diplosphæra_ and _Arachnosphæra_) which are formed by the successive\r\n  union of tangential apophyses of the radial spines. Whether this\r\n  principle is right in the theory or not, it cannot be carried out\r\n  practically. Compare also Pl. 25, fig. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n130. _Dictyosis or Lattice Formation of the Skeleton._--In the great\r\nmajority of Radiolaria the dictyosis or formation of lattice-work, and\r\nespecially the formation of a variously-shaped \"lattice-shell,\" plays such\r\nan important part that the whole class has long been popularly known in\r\nGermany by the name \"lattice animalcules\" (\"Gitterthierchen\" or\r\n\"Gitterlinge\") (_Protista dictyota_). The old name Polycystina also (1838),\r\nalthough referring only to the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, is derived from\r\nthe lattice-work of the siliceous skeleton. The extremely various forms in\r\nwhich this is manifested furnish the means of distinguishing species. The\r\nspecific conformation of the skeletal lattice-work is usually caused by the\r\nspecial disposition of the sarcodictyum (§ 94), whose exoplasmatic threads\r\nbecome silicified or (in the ACANTHARIA) converted into bars of acanthin.\r\nIn many cases, however, the form of the lattice is mainly dependent upon\r\nthe situation and form of the radial spines or of special processes from\r\nthem. With respect to their origin, two varieties of lattice may be\r\ndistinguished--simultaneous and successive. _Simultaneous dictyosis_ occurs\r\nespecially in the simple lattice-shells of the #Sphærellaria# and\r\nPHÆODARIA, where, at a given moment (\"dictyotic moment\") the _whole_\r\nlattice of the shell is excreted on the surface of the calymma. _Successive\r\ndictyosis_, on the other hand, is found more particularly in the\r\nlattice-shells of the ACANTHARIA (and in the concentric cortical shells of\r\nmany #Sphærellaria#), which develop from the separate lattice-plates formed\r\nby the apophyses of the radial spines, and hence not at the same moment.\r\nThe lattice-shells of the #Cyrtellaria#, which gradually grow out from a\r\nsagittal ring or a basal tripod, arise by successive dictyosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n131. _Dictyosis of the Spumellaria._--Siliceous lattice-structures are\r\nwanting in the first section of the SPUMELLARIA, the #Collodaria#, but in\r\nthe second section, #Sphærellaria#, they are developed in extraordinary\r\nvariety of details. In spite of this extreme richness in different forms,\r\nthe lattice-shells of the SPUMELLARIA may all be derived from one and the\r\nsame primitive ground-form, a simple lattice-sphere with regular hexagonal\r\nmeshes (_Phormosphæra_, p. 61, Pl. 12, figs. 9-11; _Heliosphæra_, &c.).\r\n{lxxxvii}The siliceous bars which bound these regular and subregular meshes\r\nare at first exceedingly then and filiform; afterwards they become thicker\r\nor spread out laterally, whence the meshes often become round with a\r\nhexagonal frame (Pl. 12, fig. 5; Pl. 28, fig. 1). If the latter vanish, a\r\nlattice-shell with simple circular meshes is formed. Very commonly the\r\nregular form of the meshes or pores becomes more or less irregular,\r\npolygonal, or roundish. Hence, in general, four different principal forms\r\nof dictyosis may be distinguished among the SPUMELLARIA; viz. (1) regular\r\nor subregular _hexagonal_ meshes; (2) regular or subregular _circular_\r\nmeshes; (3) irregular _polygonal_ meshes; (4) irregular _roundish_ meshes.\r\nThe three latter forms are to be regarded as secondary, derived from the\r\nprimary first form. In those SPUMELLARIA which possess several concentric\r\nlattice-shells enclosed one within another, either these have all the same\r\nform of dictyosis, or the lattice-work of the innermost primary shell is\r\ndifferent from that of the outer secondary shells (Pls. 19, 20); sometimes\r\nthese latter also differ more or less among themselves (§ 129).\r\n\r\n\r\n132. _Dictyosis of the Acantharia._--The lattice-structures of the\r\nACANTHARIA differ essentially from those of other Radiolaria in several\r\nparticulars. Firstly, they consist not of silica but of acanthin (§ 102);\r\nsecondly, they are always secondary formations, usually developed from\r\ntransverse processes of the primary centrogenous radial spines; thirdly,\r\ntheir formation is not simultaneous (at the same time over the same shell),\r\nbut successive (proceeding from the individual radial spines tangentially\r\ntowards the middle of the intervals); fourthly, the configuration of the\r\nnetwork is due to the relative position of the spines and the mode of union\r\nof their transverse apophyses. Since they are at right angles to the\r\nspines, and since the branches of the apophyses are at right angles to\r\nthem, the original ground-form of their dictyosis is a lattice-work with\r\nquadrangular meshes; these are often quite regular and square (Pl. 130,\r\nfigs. 5, 6; Pl. 136, figs. 2, 9, &c.); more commonly they are rectangular\r\nor irregularly quadrangular (Pl. 131, fig. 10; Pl. 133, figs. 2, 3, &c.).\r\nIn the majority of the ACANTHARIA the quadrangular form of the meshes\r\npasses over into an irregularly polygonal or roundish one (Pls. 137, 138).\r\nVery often the primary meshes of the lattice-shells, which immediately\r\nsurround the radial spines, are larger and more regular (\"aspinal pores\"),\r\nwhilst the numerous secondary meshes between them are smaller and irregular\r\n(\"coronal pores\"; Pl. 135, figs. 1-4, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n133. _Dictyosis of the Nassellaria._--The siliceous lattice-structures of\r\nthe NASSELLARIA are formed on the whole like those of the SPUMELLARIA, with\r\nwhich they were formerly united under the name \"Polycystina.\" In this group\r\nalso there may be distinguished as two main forms the regular and\r\nirregular. In the NASSELLARIA the regular lattice-structures generally\r\nexhibit hexagonal or circular meshes, whilst the irregular are either\r\npolygonal or roundish; the irregular forms are, however, much more abundant\r\nthan the {lxxxviii}regular, and a further distinction from the SPUMELLARIA\r\nconsists in the fact that the primary skeletal elements, from which the\r\nlattice is secondarily developed, exercise a predominant influence upon\r\ntheir form. These primary elements in the majority of the NASSELLARIA are\r\nto be seen in two morphologically most important structures:--first, the\r\n_primary sagittal ring_, which embraces the central capsule in the median\r\nplane (§ 124); and secondly, the _basal tripod_ (§ 125), whose three\r\ndiverging rays proceed from the base of the central capsule, whilst\r\ncommonly a fourth vertical ray supports the dorsal side of latter (compare\r\nPls. 81-91, p. 892). In the majority of the NASSELLARIA these two primary\r\nelements appear in combination, whilst in others only one of them is\r\nrecognisable. In addition there occur numerous monaxon lattice-shells in\r\nwhich neither of these elements can be recognised, but a simple ovoid\r\nlattice-shell (cephalis) alone forms the whole skeleton or its primary part\r\n(Pl. 51, fig. 13; Pl. 98, fig. 13). The great difficulty in the\r\nmorphological interpretation and phylogenetic derivation of the\r\nNASSELLARIAN skeleton lies in the fact that each of these three\r\nelements--the primary sagittal ring, the basal tripod, and the latticed\r\ncephalis--may form the whole skeleton by itself or be combined with one or\r\nboth of the others (p. 893). Even nearly related or at all events very\r\nsimilar forms may differ very greatly in this respect. With regard to the\r\nmanifold forms of their dictyosis it follows that it is partly dependent\r\nupon one of the two first elements, partly independent. In the\r\n#Plectellaria# (or those NASSELLARIA which do not possess a complete\r\nlattice-shell) the lattice-work is usually irregular and arises by union of\r\nthe ramifications, which proceed either from the primary sagittal ring\r\n(Pls. 81, 82, 92-94) or from the basal tripod (Pl. 91). In the\r\n#Cyrtellaria# (or NASSELLARIA with a complete lattice-shell, Pls. 51-80),\r\non the other hand, the lattice-work is sometimes regular, sometimes\r\nirregular, being often very different in the different joints of a\r\nsegmented shell (Pl. 72); a great part of it arises independently of the\r\ntwo chief morphological elements, and develops according to laws similar to\r\nthose which regulate the dictyosis of the SPUMELLARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n134. _Dictyosis of the Phæodaria._--The lattice-structures of the\r\nPHÆODARIA, which consist of a silicate of carbon (§ 102), are on the whole\r\nnot developed in such variety as those of the other Radiolaria, but exhibit\r\nseveral essentially different types of structure, not reducible to a common\r\nprimitive type of lattice-work. In one portion of this legion there occurs\r\nan ordinary simple lattice-work (as in SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA), with\r\nsolid trabeculæ; of these the Castanellida (Pl. 113) and Concharida (Pls.\r\n123-125) have usually regular or subregular, circular meshes, sometimes\r\nhexagonally framed; the Orosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) large irregular\r\npolygonal meshes with thick trabeculæ, the Sagosphærida (Pl. 108) large\r\ntriangular meshes with thin filiform trabeculæ. The Challengerida (Pl. 99)\r\nare characterised by a very delicate regular lattice-work, with minute\r\nhexagonal pores, like a Diatomaceous frustule. The Medusettida (Pls.\r\n118-120) {lxxxix}show a peculiar alveolar structure, numerous small\r\ncompartments being enclosed between two parallel plates. In the Circoporida\r\n(Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100) the opaque porcellanous shell has\r\na peculiar cement structure (§ 104), and the lattice-structure is confined\r\nfor the most part to characteristic rings of pores at the base of the\r\nhollow tubes, which arise from the shell. The most peculiar lattice-work,\r\nhowever, appears in the segmented shell of the Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111)\r\nand Cannosphærida (Pl. 112). In the former the large meshes of the\r\nlattice-work are usually subregular and triangular, in the latter\r\npolygonal; the trabeculæ are hollow cylinders, filled with jelly, and\r\ncontaining usually a central axial thread. In each nodal point of the\r\nlattice, in which three or more tangential tubes meet, these are separated\r\nby stellate or astral septa.\r\n\r\n\r\n135. _Radial Spines of the Skeleton._--The skeleton in the great majority\r\nof Radiolaria is armed with radial spines, which are of great importance in\r\nthe development of their general form and of their vital functions. From a\r\nmorphological point of view the number, arrangement, and disposition of the\r\nspines is usually the determining factor as regards the general form of the\r\nskeleton. Physiologically they discharge distinct functions, as organs of\r\nprotection and support; they act also, like the tentacles of the lower\r\nanimals, as prehensile organs, since their points, lateral branches, barbed\r\nhooks, &c. serve to hold fast nutritive materials. In general main-spines\r\nand accessory spines may be distinguished in most Radiolaria; the former\r\nare of pre-eminent importance in determining the figure of the skeleton;\r\nthe latter are merely appendicular organs. The main-spines present such\r\ncharacteristic and important differences in the various legions of\r\nRadiolaria that they must be considered separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n136. _Radial Spines of the Spumellaria._--The radial spines, which exhibit\r\nmost manifold variations in the large order #Sphærellaria#, present\r\ncharacteristic differences in its four suborders. In the #Sphæroidea# their\r\nnumber and disposition serve for the separation into families (p. 59); the\r\nCubosphærida (Pls. 21-25) always possess six radial main-spines, which\r\nstand opposite to each other in pairs and lie in three diameters of the\r\nshell, which are at right angles to each other and correspond to the axes\r\nof the regular crystallographic system. The Staurosphærida (Pl. 15) have\r\nfour spines, which form a regular cross and stand opposite to each other in\r\npairs, in two axes at right angles. The Stylosphærida (Pls. 13-17) show\r\nonly two main-spines, which are opposed to each other in the vertical main\r\naxis of the body. Finally, the Astrosphærida (Pls. 18-20, 26-30) are\r\ncharacterised by a larger and variable number of radial spines (eight,\r\ntwelve, twenty or more), sometimes regularly, sometimes irregularly\r\narranged. Among the other #Sphærellaria# the #Prunoidea# (Pls. 13-17, 39,\r\n40) are most allied to the Stylosphærida with two opposite main-spines; the\r\n#Discoidea# (Pls. 31-47), on the other hand, to the Staurosphærida with\r\nfour crossed spines; there exist, however, #Discoidea# with two opposite,\r\nthree marginal, or numerous radial main-spines; it is {xc}characteristic of\r\nthis suborder that they all usually lie in the horizontal median plane of\r\nthe lenticular shell, arising from its equatorial margin. The #Larcoidea#\r\n(Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50) show a great variety in the number and arrangement of\r\ntheir radial main-spines, which in the different families of this suborder\r\nstand in direct causal relation to the various forms of growth of the\r\nshell; usually the primary main-spines lie either in the three different\r\ndimensive axes, at right angles to each other, whose differentiation is\r\ncharacteristic of the lentelliptical Larcoid shell (§§ 34, 122) or in\r\ndefinite diagonal axes, which cut the former obliquely. The radial spines\r\nof the SPUMELLARIA are _never_ united in the centre of the body, but arise\r\nseparately from the surface of the primary central lattice-shell (medullary\r\nshell), more rarely from one of the secondary (cortical) shells, which\r\nenclose it. Their form is originally three-edged (sometimes pyramidal,\r\nsometimes prismatic); the cause of this is to be found in their origin from\r\nthe nodal points of the lattice-shell, whose meshes are primitively\r\nhexagonal; hence three trabeculæ unite in each nodal point, and are\r\nproduced into three edges of the spine. Very commonly, however, the spines\r\nare round (conical or cylindrical), more rarely polygonal. The three edges\r\nare often delicately toothed, not unfrequently spirally twisted around the\r\naxis of the spine (Pl. 21, figs. 1, 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n137. _Radial Spines of the Acantharia_.--The radial spines of this legion\r\nhave a much greater significance than in the other three classes of\r\nRadiolaria, since here alone they are the primary determining factors in\r\nthe skeletal structure, and grow outwards from the middle of the central\r\ncapsule. This centrogenous origin of the radial spines is as characteristic\r\nof the ACANTHARIA as their chemical constitution, which is not siliceous\r\nbut acanthinic (§ 102). Furthermore, their form is in most cases so\r\npeculiar that even an isolated ACANTHARIAN spine can be generally\r\ndistinguished from one belonging to either of the other three legions. In\r\nthe great majority of the ACANTHARIA (all #Acanthonida# and\r\n#Acanthophracta#) twenty radial spines are constantly present, which,\r\ndisposed according to a definite geometrical law, make up the skeleton\r\n(compare § 110 above and p. 717). The twenty spines are generally simply\r\napposed to each other in the centre (either by the surfaces or the edges of\r\ntheir pyramidal base); more rarely they are completely united and form a\r\nsingle star-like piece of acanthin (_Astrolithium_). Very rarely\r\n(_Acanthochiasma_) each two opposite spines are united so that ten\r\ndiametric bars cross in the middle of the central capsule. Whilst in the\r\ngreat majority of ACANTHARIA these twenty radial spines are present, the\r\nsmall group #Actinelida# is characterised by the possession of an\r\ninconstant, often very large number, sometimes over one hundred. Among\r\nthese #Actinelida# are probably to be found the stem-forms of the whole\r\nlegion. The variously modified spines of the ACANTHARIA may be grouped in\r\nthree main categories: (1) round (cylindrical or conical); (2) four-edged\r\n(prismatic or pyramidal); (3) two-edged (leaf- or sword-shaped). The latter\r\nvery commonly bear two {xci}opposite transverse processes, the former four\r\ncrossed ones. By ramification and union of these apophyses arise the\r\nlattice-shells of the #Acanthophracta# (excepting the Sphærocapsida).\r\n\r\n\r\n138. _Radial Spines of the Nassellaria._--The radial spines in this legion\r\nshow as great a variety in their form as in the SPUMELLARIA, and, as in\r\nthem, are solid, siliceous bars, usually three-edged (prismatic or\r\npyramidal), or round (cylindrical or conical); more seldom they are\r\npolygonal in section. The great majority of the NASSELLARIA are, however,\r\ndistinguished by a triradial structure, three primary radial bars diverging\r\nfrom the base of the central capsule (usually from the centre of the\r\nporochora); there is usually in addition a fourth apical spine, which\r\npasses upwards vertically or obliquely on the dorsal aspect of the central\r\ncapsule. These three or four typical radial spines of the NASSELLARIA may\r\nbe derived with great probability from the basal tripod of the #Plectoidea#\r\n(_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_, &c., Pl. 91); and since this tripod is very\r\ncharacteristically combined in _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_ with the primary\r\nsagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#, the three typical rays may be generally\r\ndesignated \"cortinar feet,\" in contradistinction to the other radial\r\nprocesses of the NASSELLARIAN skeleton.  One of the three descending basal\r\nfeet (\"pes caudalis,\" Pls. 91-95, C) is always unpaired, and lies in the\r\nvertical median plane (or sagittal plane), just as does the vertically\r\ndirected apical spine, which originally forms the dorsal bar of the\r\nsagittal ring, and is produced upwards into the \"apical horn,\" (marked _a_\r\non the plates). The other two basal feet are paired, and diverge right and\r\nleft, forwards and downwards (\"pedes pectorales,\" _p.p._). Six-rayed\r\nNASSELLARIA, in which three secondary (interradial) feet are intercalated\r\nbetween the three primary (perradial) cortinar feet, are less common than\r\nthe three-rayed forms. In some groups the number rises still higher, nine,\r\ntwelve, or even more secondary feet being intercalated between the three\r\nprimary. Besides, accessory radial spines may be developed on different\r\nparts of the shell, which have sometimes a definite relationship to the\r\ntypical radial spines, sometimes not. Their form and ramification are very\r\nvarious (Pls. 51-98).\r\n\r\n\r\n139. _Radial Spines of the Phæodaria._--The radial spines of the PHÆODARIA\r\nare very clearly distinguished from those of other Radiolaria by the fact\r\nthat they are usually hollow tubes, rarely solid bars. As a rule, the tubes\r\nare cylindrical, often slightly fusiform or conical, their siliceous wall\r\nis very thin, and their lumen filled with jelly; a fine thread of silica\r\nusually runs in the axis, and in several families is connected by fine\r\ntransverse threads with the wall of the tube (Pl. 110, figs. 4, 6; Pl. 115,\r\nfigs. 6, 7). The peculiar family Medusettida is characterised by a very\r\nremarkable segmentation of the hollow spines (Pls. 118-120). Each tube is\r\ndivided by a series of septa into chambers, which communicate by a central\r\nor excentric opening in each septum, an arrangement resembling the\r\nsiphuncle of the chambered Cephalopod shells. The number and\r\n{xcii}arrangement of the radial tubes in most PHÆODARIA is indefinite and\r\nvery variable; only in a few families is the number constant in each\r\nspecies and genus, and the disposition regular. The Medusettida (Pls.\r\n118-120) resemble the NASSELLARIA, inasmuch as equal radial feet diverge\r\nfrom the base of their shell, sometimes three in number (_Cortinetta_, Pl.\r\n117, fig. 9), sometimes four (_Medusetta_, Pl. 120, figs. 1-4), sometimes\r\nsix (_Gazelletta_); _Gorgonetta_ is specially distinguished by the\r\npossession of six ascending and six descending spines regularly alternating\r\n(Pl. 119). The Tuscarorida (Pl. 100) usually have three or four equidistant\r\nfeet. The Circoporida (Pls. 115-117), on the other hand, rather approach\r\nthe #Sphæroidea#, their spherical or regular polyhedral shell having a\r\ndefinite number of tubular radial spines, which arise at regular intervals\r\nfrom their angles; _Circoporus_ has six, _Circospathis_ nine, _Circogonia_\r\ntwelve, and _Circorrhegma_ twenty radial tubes. Very rarely the tubes of\r\nthe PHÆODARIA are angular, usually they are round, more or less\r\ncylindrical, though they are often bifurcated or even ramified, and exhibit\r\na great wealth of the most delicate appendages; siliceous hairs, bristles,\r\nspines, barbed or anchor-like hooks, spathillæ, brushes, circlets, &c.\r\n(compare Pls. 99-128).\r\n\r\n\r\n140. _Main-Spines and Accessory Spines._--As accessory spines (Paracanthæ)\r\nwe oppose to the main-spines (Protacanthæ), just described, all those\r\nprocesses which have no determining influence upon the formation of the\r\nskeleton as a whole, but are to be regarded as secondary constituents of\r\nthe skeleton, or appendicular organs of inferior significance. They are\r\ndeveloped in the utmost variety, sometimes as hairs or bristles, sometimes\r\nas thorns or clubs, either straight or curved (often zigzag), smooth or\r\nbarbed; sometimes standing vertically upon the shell, or directed towards\r\nthe centre, sometimes obliquely, or rising at a definite angle. In those\r\nSPUMELLARIA whose lattice-shell consists of several concentric spheres, the\r\naccessory spines generally arise from the outermost, the main-spines, on\r\nthe contrary, from the innermost. In the NASSELLARIA, multifarious forms of\r\naccessory spines are especially developed in the order #Plectellaria#. In\r\nthe PHÆODARIA they are often furnished with delicate appendages, _e.g._,\r\nanchor-hooks, spathillæ, coronets, &c. Among the ACANTHARIA the accessory\r\nspines which arise from the surface of the shell in the #Acanthophracta#\r\nare very characteristic. They are not radially disposed (like the similar\r\nsuperficial spines of the SPUMELLARIA), but parallel to the radial\r\nmain-spines from whose transverse processes they arise. Since in all these\r\n#Acanthophracta# the twenty radial main-spines are opposite to each other\r\nin pairs, all the accessory spines (often several hundred) are parallel to\r\nten different regularly disposed axes of the lattice-shell (Pls. 134-138).\r\n\r\n  The skeletons of the Radiolaria, in addition to the general relations\r\n  which have been discussed above, present numerous and important special\r\n  differences in the various larger and smaller groups. These are indicated\r\n  in detail in the descriptions of the legions, orders, and families in the\r\n  systematic portion of this Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{xciii}BIOGENETICAL SECTION.\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RADIOLARIA IN THE YEAR\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--ONTOGENY OR INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n(§§ 141-152.)\r\n\r\n141. _Individual Developmental Stages._--The germinal history of the\r\nRadiolaria presents great obstacles to direct observation, and hence is\r\nvery incompletely known. The fragmentary observations, however (having been\r\nmade on Radiolaria of very various groups and supplemented by comparative\r\nanatomical considerations), allow us to draw a general picture of the\r\nessential developmental processes in this great class. It may probably be\r\nassumed that in all Radiolaria, after maturation, the central capsule\r\ndischarges the function of a sporangium, and its contents are broken up\r\ninto numerous flagellate swarm-spores (zoospores). After these flagellate\r\nswarm-spores (resembling _Astasia_) have emerged from the ruptured central\r\ncapsule, they probably pass over into a _Heliozoan_-stage (_Actinophrys_)\r\nand then after the formation of a jelly-veil into the condition of\r\n_Sphærastrum_. Afterwards, when a membrane is formed between the outer\r\njelly-veil and the inner nucleated cell-body, an _Actissa_-stage arises,\r\nwhich exhibits in its simplest form the differentiation of the spherical\r\nunicellular body into the central capsule and calymma. _Actissa_ thus\r\nrepresents both ontogenetically and phylogenetically the primitive\r\ncondition of the Radiolarian organism, and may thus be regarded as the\r\npoint of departure of all other forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n142. _The Astasia-Stage._--The formation of flagellate zoospores in the\r\nmature central capsule is probably to be regarded as the common form of\r\nindividual development in all Radiolaria; since the whole contents are\r\nutilised in the formation of these swarm-spores, and since the\r\nextracapsulum takes no share in the process and perishes after they are\r\nevacuated, the _central capsule_ may be regarded as a _sporangium_ (see\r\nnote A, below). The zoospores of the Radiolaria generally arise in the\r\nfollowing way:--the nucleus of the unicellular organism, sometimes early,\r\nsometimes late (and in several different ways, §§ 63-70) breaks up into\r\nnumerous small nuclei, and each of these surrounds itself with a small\r\nportion of the endoplasm. Very often, perhaps generally, this endoplasm\r\ncontains one or several fat-granules and sometimes also a small oblong\r\ncrystal; from the protoplasm {xciv}of the small roundish or ovoid cells\r\nprotrudes one or more vibratile flagella. The fully developed spores, which\r\ncommence their vibrations even within the central capsule, emerge when it\r\nruptures, and swim about freely in the surrounding water by means of the\r\nflagellum. At this stage of its existence the young Radiolarian represents\r\nessentially the simplest form of the Flagellata, such as _Astasia_ or\r\n_Euglena_; the unicellular body is for the most part ovoid or\r\nsubcylindrical, sometimes fusiform or reniform, usually from 0.004 to 0.008\r\nmm. in diameter (Pl. 1, fig. 1_c_; Pl. 129, fig. 11). In the anterior part\r\nof the flagellate cell, immediately behind the base of the flagellum, lies\r\na homogeneous, spherical nucleus, whilst in the posterior part are usually\r\nseveral small fat-granules and often also a small oblong crystal (hence the\r\nname \"crystal-spore,\" \"Krystall-Schwärmer\"). The number of vibrating\r\nflagella, which are extremely long and fine, seems to be variable, usually\r\none, sometimes two, occasionally perhaps three, or even four or more (see\r\nnote B).\r\n\r\n  A. The formation of the motile spores in the central capsule was first\r\n  observed by J. Müller in _Acanthometra_ (1856, L. N. 10, p. 502), then by\r\n  A. Schneider in _Thalassicolla_ (1858, L. N. 13, p. 41), and finally by\r\n  myself in _Sphærozoum_ (1859, L. N. 16, p. 141). These older observations\r\n  were, however, incomplete, for the origin of the motile corpuscles from\r\n  the contents of the central capsule was not observed. The first complete\r\n  and detailed observations upon the formation of spores in the Radiolaria\r\n  were published in 1871 by Cienkowski (L. N. 22, p. 372, Taf. xxix.); they\r\n  relate to two different Polycyttaria, _Collosphæra_ and _Collozoum_.\r\n  These investigations were supplemented by R. Hertwig on _Collozoum_ and\r\n  _Thalassicolla_ (1876, L. N. 26, pp. 28, 43, &c.); on _Collozoum_ he made\r\n  the important discovery that the Polycyttaria form two kinds of spores,\r\n  one with and the other without crystals, and that the latter are divided\r\n  into macrospores and microspores (compare the chapter on \"Reproduction,\"\r\n  §§ 212-216). Quite recently Karl Brandt has confirmed these observations,\r\n  and has extended them to all the genera of Polycyttaria (1881, L. N. 38,\r\n  p. 393, and 1885, _loc. cit._).\r\n\r\n  B. The number of flagella, projecting from each spore, is very difficult\r\n  to determine, owing to their extraordinary length and slenderness. It\r\n  appeared to me that in the majority of those Radiolaria whose spores I\r\n  investigated only a single flagellum could be demonstrated with\r\n  certainty, although sometimes two, springing from a common base, seemed\r\n  to be present. Compare the chapter on \"Reproduction,\" (§ 215) and the\r\n  recent work of Karl Brandt on Sphærozoea (1885, L. N. 52, pp. 145-174).\r\n\r\n\r\n143. _The Actinophrys-Stage._--The fate of the flagellate zoospores which\r\nemerge from the mature central capsule of the Radiolaria has not hitherto\r\nbeen decided by actual observation; all attempts to rear the swarming\r\nzoospores have been in vain, for they have soon died. From what we know,\r\nhowever, of the comparative morphology of the Protista, the hypothesis is\r\nfully justified, that between the _Astasia_-stage of the flagellate\r\nswarm-spores, and the well-known _Actissa_-stage of the simplest\r\nRadiolaria, there lies an intermediate developmental stage, which may be\r\nregarded as being essentially the simplest Heliozoan form, _Actinophrys_ or\r\n_Heterophrys_. The swarm-spore is very probably converted directly in to a\r\nsimple floating _Heliozoon_ by its elongated or ovoid body {xcv}becoming\r\nspherical and by fine pseudopodia protruding all round instead of a single\r\nflagellum; the nucleus at the same time assuming a central position.\r\n\r\n\r\n144. _The Sphærastrum-Stage._--The _Actinophrys_-stage of the young\r\nRadiolaria, which proceeds immediately from the flagellate zoospore, is\r\nprobably connected with the _Actissa_-stage by an intermediate form, which\r\nmay be regarded as a simple skeletonless _Heliozoon_ with a jelly-veil; a\r\nwell-known example of such a form is _Sphærastrum_ (in the solitary, not\r\nthe social condition) and _Heterophrys_. This important intermediate form\r\nhas arisen from the simple _Actinophrys_-stage by the excretion of an\r\nexternal structureless jelly-veil, such as is formed in many other Protista\r\n(_e.g._, in the encystation of many Infusoria). The young Radiolarian in\r\nthis second _Heliozoon_-stage becomes a simple cell with pseudopodia\r\nradiating on all sides; its body consists of three concentric spheres, the\r\ncentral nucleus, the protoplasmic body proper, and the surrounding calymma\r\nor jelly-veil. When a firm membrane is developed between the last two\r\nspheres this _Sphærastrum_-stage passes over into the _Actissa_.\r\n\r\n  The gap in our empirical knowledge which still exists between the\r\n  flagellate stage (§ 142) and the simplest Radiolarian stage (_Actissa_, §\r\n  145), can be filled hypothetically only by the assumption of several\r\n  _Heliozoon_-stages following one upon another. It is possible also that\r\n  the capsule-membrane is not formed between the endoplasm and exoplasm (as\r\n  here supposed), but that the membrane was formed first outside the cell\r\n  and the extracapsulum subsequently secreted around it.\r\n\r\n\r\n145. _The Actissa-Stage._--The first SPUMELLARIAN genus, _Actissa_, is not\r\nonly the simplest form actually observed among the Radiolaria, and the true\r\nprototype of the whole class, but also the simplest form under which the\r\nRadiolarian organisation can be conceived. It is therefore extremely\r\nprobably that _Actissa_ not only forms the common stem-form of the whole\r\nclass in a phylogenetic sense, but is also its common ontogenetic or\r\ngerminal form. Probably in all Radiolaria the _Sphærastrum_-stage develops\r\nimmediately into the typical _Actissa_-stage, by the formation of a firm\r\nmembrane between the protoplasmic body of the spherical Heliozoan cell and\r\nits jelly-veil. Thus arises the characteristic central capsule, which is\r\nwanting in the nearly related Heliozoa. It is further probable that all\r\nRadiolaria in their early stage will so far conform to the state of things\r\nin _Actissa_ as to have the capsule-membrane of the spherical skeletonless\r\ncell perforated everywhere by fine pores. This structure is retained in all\r\nSPUMELLARIA, whilst in the other three legions those structural relations\r\nof the capsule which are characteristic of each develop from the\r\n_Actissa_-stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n146. _The Ontogeny of the Spumellaria._--In the simplest case the\r\nindividual development in the SPUMELLARIA ceases with the _Actissa_-stage.\r\nIn all other genera of this legion diverging forms proceed from this, of\r\nwhich the different growth of the three dimensive {xcvi}axes on the one\r\nhand (§§ 44, 45), and the differentiation of the various parts of the\r\nunicellular organism with the formation of the skeleton on the other, are\r\nof pre-eminent significance. Even in the varying growth of the central\r\ncapsule in the different dimensions of space in the skeletonless\r\n#Colloidea#, four different modes may be distinguished, which further, in\r\nthe corresponding development of the skeleton, furnish the basis for the\r\norigin of the four orders of #Sphærellaria#. The most primitive and\r\nsimplest form of growth, equal extension in all directions, is found in the\r\nspherical central capsule and the concentric spherical skeletons\r\n(_Procyttarium_, #Sphæroidea#). When the growth of the central capsule\r\nproceeds more rapidly in the direction of the vertical main axis than in\r\nany other direction, the ellipsoidal or cylindrical central capsule\r\n(_Actiprunum_) arises, and the vertically elongated skeleton of the\r\n#Prunoidea#, which is derived from it. When, on the contrary, the growth of\r\nthe central capsule and lattice-shell is less in the direction of the\r\nvertical main axis than in any other direction, the lenticular or discoid\r\ncentral capsule (_Actidiscus_) arises, and the corresponding lenticular\r\nshell of the #Discoidea#. Finally, even quite early in many SPUMELLARIA,\r\nthe growth of the central capsule and of the corresponding lattice-shell in\r\nthe three dimensive axes is different, and hence arise the lentelliptical\r\nforms whose geometrical type is the triaxial ellipsoid or the rhombic\r\noctahedron (_Actilarcus_, #Larcoidea#). Thus the origin of the four orders\r\nof #Sphærellaria# is simply explained by a varying growth in the different\r\ndimensive axes. The _primary_ (innermost) lattice-shell is in this legion\r\nalways _simultaneously_ developed (suddenly excreted at the moment of\r\nlorication from the sarcodictyum). The _secondary_ lattice-shells, on the\r\nother hand, which surround the former concentrically, and are united with\r\nit by radial bars, arise _successively_ from within outwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n147. _The Ontogeny of the Acantharia._--The individual development of the\r\nACANTHARIA in the simplest case (_Actinelius_) stops at a point which\r\ndiffers from the _Actissa_-stage only in the change of radial axial threads\r\ninto acanthin spines. In the small group #Actinelida#, their number remains\r\nvariable and usually indeterminate (Adelacantha), whilst in the great\r\nmajority of the legion (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#) the number is\r\nconstantly twenty, and those spines are regularly arranged according to the\r\nMüllerian law in five parallel circles, each containing four crossed spines\r\n(Icosacantha). The simplest form among these latter is _Acanthometron_,\r\nwhich may be regarded both ontogenetically and phylogenetically as the\r\ncommon starting-point of all the Icosacantha. Within this extensive group\r\nvariations in the length of the dimensive axes appear, similar to those\r\nobserved in the SPUMELLARIA. In the Astrolonchida and #Sphærophracta# the\r\ncentral capsule remains spherical, extending equally in all directions; and\r\ncorrespondingly the lattice-shell, which is excreted on the surface of the\r\nspherical calymma, remains spherical. In the Belonaspida (just as in the\r\n#Prunoidea#) {xcvii}this form passes over into an ellipsoid by prolongation\r\nof one axis; on the contrary, in the Hexalaspida (as in the #Discoidea#)\r\nthe discoidal or lenticular form arises by shortening of an axis. Finally,\r\nin the Diploconida, and in some Hexalaspida in which the growth is\r\ndifferent in all three dimensive axes (as in the #Larcoidea#), both the\r\ncentral capsule and the shell assume the lentelliptical form. The\r\nlattice-shell of the #Acanthophracta# is usually successive in its\r\ndevelopment, since from each of the twenty radial spines two or four\r\ntangential apophyses proceed, whose branches subsequently unite and combine\r\nto form the lattice-shell. Only in the peculiar Sphærocapsida can the\r\npavement-like shell arise simultaneously or in a moment of lorication.\r\n\r\n\r\n148. _The Ontogeny of the Nassellaria._--The individual development of the\r\nNASSELLARIA in the simplest instance remains stationary at the skeletonless\r\nNasselid stage (_Cystidium_, _Nassella_), which can be immediately derived\r\nfrom the foregoing _Actissa_-stage by the disappearance of the pores in the\r\nupper (apical) hemisphere of the central capsule, whilst in the lower\r\n(basal) portion they are modified to form a porochora; the podoconus is\r\ndeveloped within the endoplasm upon this latter. Usually the spherical form\r\nof the central capsule passes over into an ovoid or ellipsoidal one, the\r\nvertical axis which passes through the centre of the porochora being\r\nelongated. From the skeletonless Nassellida the other NASSELLARIA may be\r\nderived both ontogenetically and phylogenetically by the excretion of an\r\nextracapsular siliceous skeleton. Unfortunately, the earliest stages in the\r\nformation of this skeleton are unknown, and hence no answer can at present\r\nbe given to the important question, in what order the three primary\r\nskeletal elements of the NASSELLARIA (the basal tripod, sagittal ring, and\r\nlatticed cephalis) appear (compare §§ 111 and 182). If, for example, in\r\n_Cortina_ and _Tripospyris_ the basal tripod were to appear first in the\r\nontogeny, and the sagittal ring were developed from this, then the\r\n#Plectoidea# would be rightly considered to be the oldest forms in the\r\nphylogeny of the skeleton-forming NASSELLARIA; and in the contrary case the\r\n#Stephoidea# would be so regarded. The relations of growth in the three\r\ndimensive axes are very variable in the NASSELLARIA; the three most\r\nimportant factors in this respect (partly separately and partly in\r\ncombination) are; (1) the development of the basal tripod to a triradial\r\nstauraxon form (the ground-form being a three-sided pyramid); (2) the\r\ndevelopment of the sagittal ring in the median plane of the body (the\r\nvertical axis having the poles different); (3) the development of the\r\nlatticed cephalis outside the central capsule (the poles of the vertical\r\naxis being again different). Since the development both of the skeleton and\r\nof the malacoma is characterised in most NASSELLARIA by the stronger growth\r\nof the vertical axis and the differentiation of the two poles, the\r\nallopolar monaxon ground-form acquires a predominant significance in this\r\nlegion (§ 32); the starting point of most of the further modifications is\r\nthe basal pole of the vertical main axis. Next to this the sagittal axis is\r\nusually the most important determining factor (its dorsal and ventral poles\r\nbeing {xcviii}usually different), more rarely the frontal axis (with equal\r\nright and left poles). In the zygothalamous #Spyroidea# (as in the\r\n#Stephoidea#) the formation of the shell proceeds from the sagittal ring,\r\nwhilst in the polythalamous #Cyrtoidea# the latticed cephalis is always the\r\nstarting point, from which a series of joints (thorax, abdomen, and in the\r\nStichocyrtida, the numerous post-abdominal joints) successively arise\r\n(unipolar growth).\r\n\r\n\r\n149. _The Ontogeny of the Phæodaria._--The individual development of the\r\nPHÆODARIA in the simplest case stops with the skeletonless condition of the\r\nPhæodinida (_Phæodina_, _Phæocolla_), which can be immediately derived from\r\nthe foregoing _Actissa_-stage by the disappearance of the pores in the\r\ngreater part of the central capsule, the characteristic astropyle being\r\ndeveloped at the basal pole (§ 60). Since this particular form and\r\nstructure of the spheroidal central capsule remains the same in all\r\nPHÆODARIA, whilst the formation of their skeleton follows very different\r\ndirections, it follows that further common paths of development are\r\nexcluded both ontogenetically and phylogenetically. What will be laid down\r\nin this respect as regards the phylogeny of the different groups of\r\nPHÆODARIA (§§ 194-199) holds true also of their ontogeny. The relations of\r\ngrowth in the three dimensive axes are hence very different in the\r\nskeletons of the various groups of PHÆODARIA. This difference is best\r\nmarked in the #Phæoconchia#, whose bivalved lattice-shells have as their\r\nground-form the rhomboid pyramid of Ctenophora. In most #Phæogromia# the\r\nmonaxon lattice-shell may develop simultaneously by sudden excretion at a\r\nparticular moment of lorication; this is also the case with the polyaxon\r\nlattice-shells of the #Phæosphæria#. In their future growth the development\r\nof basal or radial apophyses is of special importance. In the majority of\r\nthe PHÆODARIA these apophyses are tubes of silicate filled with jelly\r\n(often provided with an axial siliceous thread); thus their development is\r\ndistinguished by complications which are absent in the case of the other\r\nthree legions.\r\n\r\n\r\n150. _Growth._--The growth of the body in the Radiolaria, as in all other\r\norganisms, is the fundamental function of individual development (see note\r\nA). All structural relations which this richest class of the Protista\r\nexhibits may be referred to different forms of growth, either of the\r\nunicellular malacoma or of the skeleton which it produces. In general the\r\nspecial development of the skeleton is dependent upon that of the central\r\ncapsule, and of the sarcodictyum on the surface of the calymma; in the\r\nfurther growth, however, the conditions are reversed, and the condition of\r\nthe skeleton already formed directly determines the further development of\r\nthe central capsule and of the calymma with its sarcodictyum. The four\r\nlegions of Radiolaria show, speaking generally, certain characteristic\r\ndifferences in growth, which are due in great part to the different\r\nstructure and ground-form of their central capsule. In the two legions of\r\nthe Porulosa (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA), in which the central capsule is\r\noriginally spherical and {xcix}the ground-form of the skeleton either\r\npolyaxon or isopolar monaxon, two fundamental and variously combined\r\ndirections of growth are recognisable; firstly, the _concentric_ growth\r\n(equal increase of volume in all directions), and secondly, multipolar or\r\n_diametral_ growth (hypertrophy of certain parts in the direction of\r\ndefinite pairs of radii). A different state of things obtains, however, for\r\nthe most part, in the two legions of the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and\r\nPHÆODARIA), in which the central capsule possesses a vertical main axis\r\nwith different poles, and the structure of the skeleton is determined by\r\nthis allopolar monaxon ground-form. The two fundamental directions of\r\ngrowth here combined in the most various ways are, firstly, _unipolar_\r\ngrowth (starting from the basal pole of the vertical main axis), and\r\nsecondly, radial or _pyramidal_ growth (characterised by the different\r\ndevelopment of separate parts in the direction of definite radii). Whilst\r\nthe growth of the _malacoma_ is dependent on intussusception (as in most\r\norganic structures capable of imbibing), the growth of the _skeleton_ in\r\nall Radiolaria takes place by apposition (see note B).\r\n\r\n  A. The earliest investigations into the modes of growth in the Radiolaria\r\n  are due to J. Müller (L. N. 12, pp. 21-33). More detailed communications\r\n  I gave myself in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 150-159). The relations\r\n  there sketched have now, in consequence of the examination of the\r\n  Challenger collection, undergone many important additions, and in some\r\n  divisions, important modifications; these are for the most part treated\r\n  of in the general account of the separate families.\r\n\r\n  B. The view here maintained, that the skeleton of all Radiolaria grows\r\n  only by apposition, appeared formerly to have certain exceptions. I\r\n  thought I had shown that in _Coelodendrum_ the thin-walled tubes grew not\r\n  only in length but also in thickness, with continuous increase in the\r\n  lumen (L. N. 16, pp. 152, 360). Further K. Brandt concluded, from the\r\n  varying size of the median bars in the twin-spicules of _Sphærozoum_,\r\n  that these siliceous structures grow by intussusception (L. N. 38, p.\r\n  401). Both suppositions have been proved erroneous and I have come to the\r\n  opinion that in all Radiolaria the skeleton grows by apposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n151. _Regeneration._--Whilst the general course of individual development\r\n(perhaps without any exception in the Radiolaria), begins with the\r\nformation of zoospores in the central capsule, there yet occurs in some\r\ngroups a different form of ontogeny, introduced by simple division of the\r\nunicellular organism, and coming under the term \"regeneration\" in its wider\r\nsense. This spontaneous division occurs quite commonly in the Polycyttaria\r\n(or social SPUMELLARIA), and produces their colonies (compare the chapter\r\non Reproduction, § 213). On the contrary, it has not been observed in the\r\nsolitary SPUMELLARIA, nor in the ACANTHARIA and NASSELLARIA; possibly,\r\nhowever, the peculiar ACANTHARIAN family, Litholophida, has arisen by the\r\ndivision of Acanthonida (compare p. 734). Among the PHÆODARIA division is\r\ncommonly observed in the order #Phæocystina# (which have an incomplete\r\nBeloid skeleton or none), and also in the #Phæoconchia#. In all these cases\r\nthe increase by division is nothing else than an ordinary case of\r\ncell-division, in which bisection of the nucleus precedes that of the\r\ncentral capsule. The regeneration by {c}which each of the two\r\ndaughter-cells develops to a complete mother-cell depends upon simple\r\ngrowth. Another form of regeneration, different from this, has been\r\nobserved in _Thalassicolla_. If the central capsule be extracted\r\nartificially from the large concentric calymma, the enucleated central\r\ncapsule produces a new extracapsulum, with sarcomatrix, pseudopodia, and\r\ncalymma. This experiment may be repeated several times with the same\r\nresult. (Compare A. Schneider, 1867, L. N. 20.)\r\n\r\n\r\n152. _The Formation of Colonies._--The individual development of colonies\r\ntakes place in all three families of the Polycyttaria (Collozoida,\r\nSphærozoida, Collosphærida) in the same simple way, by the repeated\r\ndivision of a single monozootic SPUMELLARIAN. Since these divisions only\r\naffect the central capsule and not the extracapsulum, the sister-cells,\r\nwhich arise by repeated division of the mother, remain enclosed in a common\r\nrapidly growing calymma. Probably in all Polycyttaria the commencement of\r\nthe formation of colonies immediately follows the _Actissa_-stage of the\r\nmonozootic mother-cell (or takes place in the _Thalassicolla_-stage, which\r\narises from the former by the development of alveoles in the calymma). The\r\nsimple central nucleus separates (by direct nuclear division) into two\r\nhalves, and the central capsule follows this process of bisection, becoming\r\nconstricted in the middle between the two daughter nuclei (Pl. 3, fig. 12).\r\nIn the further growth of the colony the process of division proceeds in the\r\nolder, now multinucleate, central capsules, in which an oil-globule has\r\ntaken the place of the original nucleus; then the division of the\r\noil-globules precedes that of the central capsule (Pl. 5, fig. 1). Another\r\nmode of growth of the colonies is the multiplication of the central\r\ncapsules by gemmulation, or the formation of the so-called \"extracapsular\r\nbodies\" (Gemmulæ, § 214). The characteristic skeletal structure of the\r\ndifferent species appears at a later stage. Whether ripe central capsules\r\ncan emerge from the social bond of a coenobium, and, having become\r\nisolated, establish the formation of a new colony, is very doubtful. The\r\nvarious forms which the coenobium assumes in the different species of\r\nPolycyttaria, are due partly to simple growth, partly to the development of\r\nlarge vacuoles in the calymma.\r\n\r\n  The _form and size_ of the coenobia appear in many fully developed\r\n  Polycyttaria to exhibit specific differences, which require further\r\n  investigation; in the young stage, on the contrary, they are simple\r\n  spheres or ellipsoids, often cylindrical or sausage-shaped (Pl. 3, figs.\r\n  1, 4, 6, 11).  In some species the cylindrical gelatinous bodies become\r\n  moniliform, and separated by transverse constrictions into many segments,\r\n  each of which encloses a large alveole (Pl. 3, fig. 10). The rare\r\n  ring-shape (Pl. 4, fig. 1) which I figured in 1862 in the case of\r\n  _Collozoum_ (L. N. 16, p. 522, Taf. xxxv. fig. 1), I have recently\r\n  observed in different species of Polycyttaria; it is capable of a very\r\n  simple mechanical explanation, both ends of a sausage-shaped colony\r\n  having been accidentally brought into contact by a wave and having united\r\n  by agglutination. Quite recently Brandt has given a very complete account\r\n  of the development, form, and growth of Polycyttarian colonies in his\r\n  work on the colonial Radiolaria of the Bay of Naples (1885, L. N. 52, pp.\r\n  71-85).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{ci}CHAPTER VI.--PHYLOGENY OR GENEALOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\n(§§ 153-200.)\r\n\r\n153. _Sources of Phylogenetic Knowledge._--For the purpose of constructing\r\na hypothetical genealogical tree of the Radiolaria, as of all other\r\norganisms, three sources of information are open to us, viz., palæontology,\r\ncomparative ontogeny, and comparative anatomy. In the present case,\r\nhowever, these three sources are of very different value; the first two are\r\nat present only very inadequately known and have only been partially\r\ninvestigated, hence they can only be utilised to a very slight extent. The\r\ncomparative anatomy of the Radiolaria, on the other hand, is so completely\r\nknown, and affords such certain glimpses into the morphological relations\r\nof the related groups, that by its aid we are in a position at all events\r\nto lay down the general features of their phylogeny with some probability,\r\nand to lay the foundation of a natural system.\r\n\r\n\r\n154. _Natural and Artificial Systems._--Although in the classification of\r\nthe Radiolaria, as in the case of all other organisms, the natural system\r\nmust be regarded as the goal of systematic classification, our phylogenetic\r\nknowledge of the Radiolaria is too fragmentary and inadequate to admit of\r\nthe systematic arrangement here adopted being regarded as a thoroughly\r\nconsistent natural system, that is, as representing the true genealogical\r\ntree of the class. Owing, however, to the extraordinary variety of form of\r\nthe Radiolaria, and the complicated relationships of the larger and smaller\r\ngroups, a synoptical grouping of the different categories and the erection\r\nof a complete, even if to some extent artificial, system, becomes a logical\r\nnecessity. Under these circumstances, and regard being had to both these\r\nconditions, the following systematic treatment of the Radiolaria will\r\nappear as a _compromise between the natural and artificial systems_, like\r\nall other zoological and botanical classificatory attempts. On the one\r\nhand, the attempt is made to arrange the larger and smaller groups as\r\nnearly as possible according to their phylogenetic relationships, whilst,\r\non the other hand, the practice of circumscribing each by a definition as\r\nclear and logical as possible has been carried out. Since these two efforts\r\nnaturally often come into contact, the insufficiency of many parts of the\r\narrangement is obvious, hence its hypothetical and provisional character is\r\nemphatically stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n155. _Systematic Categories._--The categories or different orders of\r\ndivisions have in the Radiolaria, as in all other organisms, no _absolute_\r\nsignificance, but only a _relative_ value. In itself it is quite\r\nunimportant whether the whole group be regarded, as at first, as a _family_\r\n(Ehrenberg, 1847), or as an _order_ (J. Müller, 1858), or as a _class_\r\n(Haeckel, {cii}1881). These different views are regulated, on the one hand,\r\nby the known extent of the group and by the amount of our acquaintance with\r\nit, and on the other, by comparison with related groups and by reference to\r\ntheir conventional disposition. When, therefore, the whole class,\r\nRadiolaria, is here divided into two subclasses, four legions, eight\r\norders, eighty-five families, &c., these artificial categories are drawn up\r\nonly in the conviction that by this means the easiest survey and most\r\nthorough insight into the system as a whole may be attained; this latter\r\nwill indeed approach as far as possible the ideal of a natural system, but\r\nmust on numerous practical grounds always remain more or less artificial.\r\nSince it is to be expected that with the progress of our systematic\r\nknowledge the rank of the various categories will rise, it is possible that\r\nin the future the arrangement of the group may be somewhat as\r\nfollows:--_Phylum_, RADIOLARIA; _Four Classes_, SPUMELLARIA, NASSELLARIA,\r\nACANTHARIA, PHÆODARIA; _Eight Legions_ (Nos. I.-VIII. in the following\r\nTable); _Twenty Orders_ (Nos. 1-20 in the Table), &c.\r\n\r\n  Four Legions. Eight Sublegions.   Twenty Orders.

According to the individual views of\r\nthe systematist and the general survey which he has attained of the smaller\r\nand larger systematic groups, the conception of a species adopted in his\r\npractical work will be wider or narrower. In the present systematic\r\narrangement a medium extent has been adopted. It is shown that in the\r\nRadiolaria, as in all other extensive groups of organisms, the constancy of\r\nthe species is very variable in the different groups. Many families of\r\nRadiolaria are very rich in \"bad species,\" _i.e._, very _variable_ forms,\r\nin which the process of the formation of species is seen in progress; such,\r\nfor example, are--among the SPUMELLARIA, the Sphærozoida, Stylosphærida,\r\nPhacodiscida and Pylonida; among the ACANTHARIA, the Amphilonchida and\r\nPhractopeltida; among the NASSELLARIA, the #Stephoidea# and #Botryodea#;\r\nand among the PHÆODARIA, the Aulacanthida, Sagosphærida, Castanellida and\r\nConcharida. On the {civ}other hand, in some families numerous \"good\r\nspecies\" may be distinguished, since the intermediate connecting forms are\r\nno longer present and the forms have become _relatively constant_. As\r\ninstances of such families may be mentioned, among the SPUMELLARIA, the\r\nAstrosphærida, Cyphinida, Porodiscida and Tholonida; among the ACANTHARIA\r\nthe Quadrilonchida and Dorataspida; among the NASSELLARIA, the #Spyroidea#\r\nand #Cyrtoidea#; among the PHÆODARIA, the Challengerida, Medusettida,\r\nCircoporida and Coelographida. The more carefully the different groups are\r\nstudied, the more numerous the individuals of each species under\r\ncomparison, the greater becomes the number of \"bad\" species among the\r\nRadiolaria, and the smaller the number of good ones. Originally, no doubt,\r\nall \"species bonæ\" were \"malæ.\" There may be observed in the manifold\r\nskeletal forms of the Radiolaria, on the one hand, the utmost accuracy of\r\nconfiguration, and on the other, the greatest variability, and hence a\r\ncareful comparative study of them leads to a firm conviction of the gradual\r\n\"Transformation of Species,\" and of the truth of the \"Theory of Descent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n157. _Palæontological Development._--The palæontology of the Radiolaria\r\nalready offers very considerable material for study; but in consequence of\r\nits incompleteness this is of little value for the study of the phylogeny\r\nof the class. By far the larger portion of the fossil Radiolaria belong to\r\nthe Tertiary period; only quite recently have numerous well-preserved\r\nfossil Radiolaria been described from the Mesozoic period, and especially\r\nfrom the Jura. Of Palæozoic Radiolaria (from the coal measures) only slight\r\ntraces are known. Moreover, the fossil Radiolaria hitherto known have been\r\nfound only in very circumscribed and widely separated localities. The\r\nmajority of all the species belong to the small island of Barbados.\r\nAlthough our palæontological acquaintance with the Radiolaria must\r\nnecessarily be incomplete for this reason, it is still more so since at\r\nleast thirty out of the eighty-five families (that is more than a third)\r\ncould not possibly leave any fossil remains, either because they possess no\r\nskeleton, or because of its chemical composition.\r\n\r\n  Of the four legions of the Radiolaria, the ACANTHARIA (on account of the\r\n  solubility of their astroid acanthin skeletons) have entirely vanished\r\n  and have never been found fossil. Of the PHÆODARIA, whose silicate\r\n  skeleton is not as a rule capable of fossilisation, only one section\r\n  (Dictyochida) of a single family (Cannorrhaphida) has been observed\r\n  fossil. Hence the fossil remains of the Radiolaria belong almost\r\n  exclusively to the two legions, SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, which were\r\n  formerly united under the term \"Polycystina.\" Among these, however, the\r\n  skeletonless Thalassicollida, Collozoida, and Nassellida could leave no\r\n  traces. Hence there only remain fifty-five families of which we might\r\n  expect to find fossil siliceous skeletons. Even of these, however,\r\n  scarcely the half are certainly known in the fossil condition, whilst of\r\n  the remainder nothing certain is known; for example, of the large order\r\n  #Larcoidea# (among the SPUMELLARIA) and of the #Stephoidea# (among the\r\n  NASSELLARIA) with a few isolated exceptions, no fossils are known. The\r\n  great majority of fossil Radiolaria belong to the two NASSELLARIAN orders\r\n  #Cyrtoidea# and #Spyroidea# (two relatively very highly developed\r\n  groups); next to these follow the orders {cv}#Discoidea# and #Sphæroidea#\r\n  among the SPUMELLARIA. From these palæontological facts it is obvious\r\n  that our present very incomplete acquaintance with the fossil Radiolaria\r\n  is quite insufficient to warrant us in drawing any conclusions from it\r\n  regarding the phylogenetic development or palæontological succession of\r\n  the individual groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n158. _Origin of the Four Legions._--The agreement of all Radiolaria in\r\nthose constant and essential characters of the unicellular body, which\r\ndistinguish them from all other Protista (especially the differentiation of\r\nthe malacoma into a central capsule and extracapsulum), justifies the\r\nconclusion that all members of this class have been developed from a common\r\nundifferentiated stem-form. Only the simplest form of the SPUMELLARIA, a\r\nskeletonless spherical cell with concentric spherical nucleus and calymma,\r\ncan be regarded as such. The simplest form of the Thalassicollida which is\r\nnow extant (_Actissa_, _Procyttarium_, p. 12), corresponds so exactly to\r\nthe morphological idea of that hypothetical stem-form that it may\r\nunhesitatingly be regarded in a natural system as the common point of\r\norigin of the whole class. On the other hand, _Actissa_ is so closely\r\nrelated to the simple Heliozoa (_Actinophrys_, _Actinosphærium_,\r\n_Heterophrys_, _Sphærastrum_, &c.) that its origin from this group of\r\nRhizopoda is exceedingly probable. The three legions ACANTHARIA,\r\nNASSELLARIA, and PHÆODARIA are to be regarded as three main diverging\r\nbranches of the genealogical tree, which have been developed in different\r\ndirections and are only connected by their simplest stem-forms\r\n(_Actinelius_, _Nassella_, _Phæodina_) with the stem-form of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, the primordial _Actissa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n159. _Phylogeny of the Spumellaria._--The legion SPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA\r\nis to be regarded as the common stem-group of the Radiolaria, and its\r\nsimplest form, _Actissa_, as the primitive genus or radical form of the\r\nwhole class; for it possesses in the simplest and most undifferentiated\r\nform all those characters by which the Radiolaria are distinguished from\r\nother Protista; all the other genera of the class may be derived from it by\r\nsuccessive modifications. Considered as a legion the whole group\r\nSPUMELLARIA is undoubtedly monophyletic, for all its members possess those\r\nessential characters by which it is distinctively marked off from the other\r\nthree legions, more especially a simple capsule-membrane, which is\r\neverywhere evenly perforated by innumerable small pores; the nucleus lies\r\noriginally in the centre of the spherical central capsule. Furthermore, all\r\nSPUMELLARIA lack those positive characters which distinguish the three\r\nremaining legions--the centrogenous acanthin skeleton of the ACANTHARIA,\r\nthe basal porochora and the monaxon podoconus of the NASSELLARIA, the\r\nastropyle and phæodium of the PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n160. _Origin of the Spumellaria._--The genus _Actissa_ (p. 12, Pl. 1, fig.\r\n1) presents the Radiolarian type in its simplest and most primitive form--a\r\nspherical central capsule, which encloses in its middle a spherical\r\nnucleus, and which is surrounded by a spherical calymma. The whole\r\nunicellular body consists, therefore, of three concentric spheres, {cvi}and\r\npossesses neither skeleton nor alveoles, nor other differentiated parts.\r\nThe innumerable fine pseudopodia, which issue from the central capsule\r\nthrough the evenly distributed pores in its membrane, radiate in all\r\ndirections through the calymma and pass out over its surface. _Actissa_\r\ncan, therefore, be directly derived phylogenetically from the simplest\r\nskeletonless Heliozoa (_Actinophrys_, _Heterophrys_, _Actinosphærium_,\r\n_Sphærastrum_). The only essential difference between the two consists in\r\nthe development of the _central capsule_, which in _Actissa_ separates as a\r\ndistinct membrane the endoplasm from the exoplasm. This differentiation\r\nwhich we regard is the most important distinguishing character of the\r\nRadiolaria, has been transmitted by inheritance, along with the formation\r\nof flagellate spores in the central capsule, from _Actissa_, the primitive\r\nparent to all the other Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n{cvii}161. _Hypothetical Genealogical Tree of the Spumellaria_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LARCOIDEA                   DISCOIDEA\r\n                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n                          Streblonida           PHACODISCARIA\r\n                               |                  Coccodiscida\r\n                               |   THOLONIDA           |\r\n                               |        |              |\r\n       PRUNOIDEA               |        |              |\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Soreumida|        |              |\r\n                          |    |        |              |\r\n  Zygartida               |    |        |              |\r\n      |                   |    |        |              |\r\n      |                   |    |Zonarida|              |\r\n      |                   |Lithelida|   | SPHÆROIDEA   |CYCLODISCARIA\r\n      |                   |    |    |   |~~~~~~~~~~~~~ |   Spongodiscida\r\n      |                   |    |    |   |Stylosphærida |Pylodiscida|\r\n      |              Phorticida|    |   |     |        |     |     |\r\n      |                   |    |    |   |     |        |     |     |\r\n  Panartida               |    |    |   |     |        |     |     |\r\n      |          Artiscida|    +----+---+     |        |     |     |\r\n      |                |  |         |         |        |     |     |\r\n      |                |  |         |         |  Phacodiscida|     |\r\n      |Spongodruppida  |  |         |         |        |     |     |\r\n      |     |          |  |         |   Staurosphærida |     +-----+\r\n      |     |          |  |     Pylonida      |        |        |\r\n      |     |          |  |         |         |        |        |\r\n  Cyphinida |          |  +---------+         |        |        |\r\n      |     |          |       |              |        |   Porodiscida\r\n      |     |          |       | Astrosphærida|        |        |\r\n      +-----+          |       |        |     |        |        |\r\n        |              |       |        |     |   Cenodiscida   |\r\n        |Spongellipsida|   Larnacida    |     |        |        |\r\n        |      |       |       |        |     |        |  Archidiscida\r\n        |      |       |       |        |Cubosphærida  |        |\r\n   Druppulida  |       |       |        |     |        +--------+\r\n        |      |       |       |        |     |              |\r\n        |      |       |       |        |     |Collosphærida |\r\n        |      |       |       |        |     |     |        |\r\n        |      |       |   LARNACILLA   +-----+-----+        |\r\n        |      |       |   (Trizonium)        |              |\r\n        | Spongurida   |       |              |              |\r\n        +------+-------+       |              |              |\r\n               |               |              |              |\r\n           Ellipsida       Larcarida      Liosphærida    Cenodiscida\r\n         (CENELLIPSIS)   (CENOLARCUS)    (CENOSPHÆRA)   (CENODISCUS)\r\n               |               |              |              |\r\n         [Actiprunum?]    [Actilarcus?] [Procyttarium]  [Actidiscus?]\r\n               |               |              |              |\r\n               +---------------+------+-------+--------------+\r\n                                      |\r\n               CENOSPHÆRA (Common stem-form of all Sphærellaria?)\r\n                     |     |\r\n                     |     |        POLYCYTTARIA\r\n                     | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n                     |Collosphærida  Collozoida  Sphærozoida  }\r\n                     |     |             |          |         } BELOIDEA\r\n                     +-----+             |   Thalassosphærida }\r\n                        |                |          |\r\n                   Ethmosphærida         |          |\r\n                        |                |          |\r\n                        +----------------+----------+\r\n                                         |\r\n                                    COLLOIDEA\r\n                                         |\r\n                                  Thalassicollida\r\n                                         |\r\n                                      ACTISSA\r\n\r\n\r\n{cviii}162. _Collodaria and Sphærellaria._--Whilst in all SPUMELLARIA the\r\nmalacoma agrees in possessing the characteristic features of the legion,\r\nand thus justifies its derivation monophyletically from the common\r\nstem-form _Actissa_, the different forms of skeleton, on the other hand,\r\ncannot all be referred to the same fundamental form. More especially the\r\n_spherical lattice-shell_, from which all the numerous skeletal forms of\r\nthe #Sphærellaria# may be derived, cannot have arisen from the incomplete\r\nBeloid skeleton which characterises the #Beloidea# among the #Collodaria#.\r\nIt is probable rather that the formation of the skeleton has taken place\r\nindependently in those two groups of SPUMELLARIA. From the skeletonless\r\n#Colloidea#, as the common stem-group of the SPUMELLARIA, two different\r\nmain groups have diverged, on the one hand the #Beloidea#, whose skeleton\r\nconsists of separate spicules scattered in the extracapsulum, and on the\r\nother hand, the #Sphærellaria#, which have formed a simple lattice-sphere\r\naround the central capsule; from this the manifold forms of the remaining\r\nSPUMELLARIA may be derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n163. _Descent of the Sphærellaria._--The extensive order #Sphærellaria#,\r\nwhich includes all SPUMELLARIA with a complete lattice-shell, develops an\r\nextraordinary variety of skeletal structures; these may, nevertheless, all\r\nbe derived without violence from a common stem-form, or simple spherical\r\nlattice-shell, _Cenosphæra_. The main stem of the order, the extensive\r\nsuborder #Sphæroidea# (Pls. 5-30), is derived immediately from _Cenosphæra_\r\n(p. 61, Pl. 12); three diverging branches of it being represented by the\r\nother three suborders, the #Prunoidea# (Pls. 16, 17, 39, 40) being\r\ndeveloped by elongation, and the #Discoidea# (Pls. 31-48) by shortening of\r\nthe vertical main axis, whilst the #Larcoidea# (Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50) have\r\noriginated by the modification of the spherical lattice-shell into a\r\nlentelliptical or triaxial ellipsoidal one. Although the monophyletic\r\nderivation of all #Sphærellaria# from _Cenosphæra_ is exceedingly probable,\r\nthe possibility of a polyphyletic origin for the group is by no means\r\nexcluded. For even in the skeletonless primitive genus of all the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_ (as well as in the social _Collozoum_), there are\r\nfound, in addition to the usual spherical types, other species (or\r\nsubgenera, p. 12) whose central capsule is not spherical but a modification\r\nof the sphere; in _Actiprunum_ ellipsoidal; in _Actidiscus_ lenticular; in\r\n_Actilarcus_ lentelliptical; if such modified forms of _Actissa_ were to\r\ndevelop their lattice-shells independently, then their form would\r\ncorrespond to that of the central capsule; and such simple ellipsoidal,\r\ndiscoidal, and lentelliptical lattice-shells might have been the primitive\r\nforms of the #Prunoidea#, #Discoidea# and #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n164. _Genealogical Tree of the Sphæroidea._--_Cenosphæra_, the simplest\r\nform of the spherical lattice-shell, may be unhesitatingly regarded as the\r\ncommon stem-form of all the #Sphæroidea# (pp. 50-284, Pls. 5-30).\r\n_Cenosphæra_ (p. 61, Pl. 12) arose directly from _Actissa_ simply by the\r\nsilicification of the spherical exoplasmatic network of the sarcodictyum\r\naround the central capsule, on the surface of the concentric calymma. From\r\nthis simple siliceous extracapsular lattice-sphere all other forms of\r\n#Sphæroidea# have arisen, in the main by the manifold combination of two\r\nsimple processes, first by the formation of radial spines on the surface of\r\nthe lattice-sphere, and second, the addition of concentric spherical\r\nlattice-shells. Both processes may be utilised as the foundation for a\r\nsystematic treatment of the #Sphæroidea# (compare pp. 52-58).\r\n\r\n  If in the #Sphæroidea# the characteristic number and disposition of the\r\n  _radial spines_ be regarded as the most important heritable peculiarity\r\n  of the different families, then we have the following natural\r\n  arrangement:--(1) Liosphærida, without radial spines; (2) Cubosphærida,\r\n  with six radial spines (opposite in pairs in three axes perpendicular to\r\n  each other); (3) Staurosphærida, with four radial spines (in two axes\r\n  crossed at right angles); (4) Stylosphærida, with two opposite radial\r\n  spines (in the vertical main axis); and (5) Astrosphærida, with numerous\r\n  regularly or irregularly distributed radial spines (eight to twenty or\r\n  more). If, on the contrary, more stress be laid upon the number of the\r\n  concentric lattice-shells, then we have the following artificial\r\n  grouping:--(1) Monosphærida, with one simple lattice-sphere; (2)\r\n  Dyosphærida, with two concentric lattice-spheres; (3) Triosphærida, with\r\n  three; (4) Tetrasphærida, with four; (5) Polysphærida, with numerous\r\n  (five to twenty or more) concentric lattice-shells; (6) Spongosphærida,\r\n  with a spongy spherical shell. In general the former arrangement appears\r\n  more natural than the latter, since the number of primary radial spines,\r\n  which grow out from the primary lattice-sphere, determines their\r\n  ground-form from the outset, whatever may be the number of secondarily\r\n  added shells. Strictly speaking, according to the view adopted, these\r\n  Liosphærida which have several shells, on the outer surface of which\r\n  there are no radial spines, ought to be classified according to the\r\n  number and arrangement of their internal radial connecting beams and\r\n  distributed among the other families. The practical application of this\r\n  correct principle meets, however, with great difficulties. Also in many\r\n  cases the phylogenetic relations of the different #Sphæroidea# are more\r\n  complicated than would appear from both these classificatory principles.\r\n  In general their phylogeny will quite correspond with their ontogeny,\r\n  since from the innermost first formed {cix}lattice-shell (primary\r\n  medullary shell) a number of radial spines arises, and upon these the\r\n  secondary shells are formed from within outwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n165. _Genealogical Tree of the Prunoidea._--The suborder #Prunoidea# is\r\nvery closely related to the #Sphæroidea#, and is distinguished from it by\r\nthe elongation of one axis; from the simple lattice-sphere (_Cenosphæra_)\r\nis developed a latticed ellipsoid (_Cenellipsis_, Pl. 39, fig. 1). The\r\ndevelopment of this vertical isopolar main axis is foreshadowed even among\r\nthe #Sphæroidea#, in that family in which two opposite radial spines grow\r\nout of the primary lattice-sphere at the two poles of the vertical main\r\naxis (Stylosphærida, Pls. 13, 14). These latter pass over without any sharp\r\nboundary into those forms of #Prunoidea# whose ellipsoidal lattice-shell\r\nbears two opposite main-spines (Stylatractida, Pls. 15, 16). Other very\r\nintimate relationships between the #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea# are\r\nindicated in certain of the latter by the fact that of the two concentric\r\nlattice-shells the inner (medullary) shell is spherical, the outer\r\n(cortical) shell ellipsoidal (Pl. 39, figs. 3, 7, 8, 14, 19); often three\r\nconcentric lattice-shells are present, of which the two inner are spherical\r\nintracapsular medullary shells, whilst the outer is an extracapsular\r\ncortical shell, ellipsoidal or cylindrical in form (Pl. 39, figs. 4, 12,\r\n17, 18). Owing to the manifold nature of these phylogenetical relations and\r\nthe variety of their combinations, the derivation of the individual\r\n#Prunoidea# from the #Sphæroidea# is rendered very difficult; in addition\r\nto which it is possible that the simplest #Prunoidea# (_Cenellipsis_,\r\n_Ellipsidium_) have been directly developed from the skeletonless\r\n_Actiprunum_ (a form of _Actissa_ with ellipsoidal central capsule, p. 14)\r\nby the excretion of a simple ellipsoidal lattice-shell on the surface of\r\ntheir calymma.\r\n\r\n  The phylogeny of the #Prunoidea# is especially complicated by the\r\n  formation of peculiar transverse constrictions, perpendicular to the\r\n  longitudinal axis. They are wanting only in the Monoprunida (Ellipsida,\r\n  Druppulida, and Spongurida); the Dyoprunida (Artiscida and Cyphinida, Pl.\r\n  39, figs. 9-19) possess only one such constriction (in the equatorial\r\n  plane); the Polyprunida, on the other hand, have three, five, or more\r\n  parallel constrictions (Panartida and Zygartida, Pl. 40). The chambers,\r\n  which are separated off by these constrictions, may be regarded as polar\r\n  sections of incomplete cortical shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n166. _Genealogical Tree of the Discoidea._--The suborder #Discoidea# is\r\nclosely related to the #Sphæroidea#, but separated from it by shortening of\r\none axis; from a simple lattice-sphere (_Cenosphæra_) a latticed lens or\r\nflattened spheroid is developed, whose circular equatorial plane is larger\r\nthan any other section (_Cenodiscus_, Pl. 48, fig. 1). The formation of\r\nthis horizontal equatorial plane is perhaps indicated in that family of\r\n#Sphæroidea# in which four crossed radial spines, lying in one plane, are\r\ndeveloped (Staurosphærida, Pls. 15, 31, 42). The morphological and\r\nphylogenetical relations of the #Discoidea# to the #Sphæroidea# are\r\nprecisely the converse of those of the #Prunoidea#; in the latter the\r\nvertical axis appears longer, in the former shorter than any {cx}other axis\r\nof the body. The #Discoidea# are probably polyphyletic, having originated\r\nfrom several different groups of #Sphæroidea#; at least two essentially\r\ndifferent main groups may be distinguished among them; of these the one is\r\ncharacterised by the formation of a large extracapsular lenticular cortical\r\nshell (Phacodiscaria), whilst in the other this typical \"Phacoid shell\" or\r\nlattice-lens is wanting (Cyclodiscaria, compare pp. 403-409).\r\n\r\n  The Phacodiscida (Pls. 31-35) perhaps constitute the primitive group of\r\n  the Phacodiscaria, their lenticular or Phacoid cortical shell being\r\n  connected by radial bars with one or two concentric spherical medullary\r\n  shells; they may have originated directly from the Dyosphærida or\r\n  Triosphærida by flattening of the spheroidal cortical shell. From the\r\n  Phacodiscida the Cenodiscida (if indeed they be not the primitive\r\n  stem-form) have been developed by retrogression and loss of those\r\n  medullary shells. The Coccodiscida (Pls. 36-38), on the other hand, have\r\n  been developed from the Phacodiscida by the addition of concentric rings\r\n  of chambers, which may be regarded as incomplete cortical shells, only\r\n  the equatorial portion of which is developed. Perhaps the Porodiscida,\r\n  the primitive group of the Cyclodiscaria, have arisen in a similar way;\r\n  they lack, however, the typical Phacoid shell, the concentric rings of\r\n  chambers being directly applied to a small spherical medullary shell in\r\n  the equatorial plane (Pls. 41-46). If those rings from the commencement\r\n  be interrupted by three interradial gaps (gates) the family Pylodiscida\r\n  arises (Pl. 38, figs. 6-20). If, on the contrary, the concentric radially\r\n  divided chambers of the Porodiscida become quite irregular and spongy,\r\n  they pass over into the Spongodiscida (Pls. 46, 47). It is not, however,\r\n  impossible that part of the #Discoidea# (especially the Cenodiscida) have\r\n  originated directly from skeletonless #Collodaria# with a lenticular\r\n  central capsule, such as are found in a subgenus of _Actissa_\r\n  (_Actidiscus_, p. 15).\r\n\r\n\r\n167. _Genealogical Tree of the Larcoidea._--The suborder #Larcoidea#\r\npresents in the structure, composition, and development of its variously\r\nformed lattice-shells much more complicated relations than the other\r\n#Sphærellaria#; it is essentially distinguished from them by the\r\ncharacteristic ground-form of its lattice-shells, which is a \"lentellipsis\"\r\nor a triaxial ellipsoid (also the ground-form of the rhombic\r\ncrystallographic system, the rhombic octahedron). Hence all parts of the\r\nbody are regularly disposed with respect to three different dimensive axes;\r\nall three axes, perpendicular one to another, are isopolar but of different\r\nlengths; the longest is the vertical main axis, the mean the horizontal\r\nfrontal axis, the shortest the horizontal sagittal axis. In the great\r\nmajority of the #Larcoidea# the lentelliptical ground-form is indicated in\r\nthe central capsule, even when it is not at once obvious in the skeleton.\r\nSince such lentelliptical central capsules are developed even in _Actissa_\r\n(_Actilarcus_, p. 16), it is possible that the simplest #Larcoidea# may\r\nhave arisen directly from these by deposition of a simple lentelliptical\r\nlattice-shell in the sarcodictyum, on the surface of the calymma\r\n(_Cenolarcus_, Pl. 50, fig. 7). It is more probable, however, that these\r\nsimplest forms (_Cenolarcus_, _Larcarium_) have been developed from the\r\nsimplest #Sphæroidea# (_Cenosphæra_), by the spherical body growing\r\nunequally in the three dimensions of space. It appears especially likely\r\n{cxi}from a study of the concentrically disposed lattice-shells of some\r\n#Larcoidea# (_Coccolarcus_, _Larcidium_, Pl. 50, fig. 8), in which the\r\ninner medullary shell is spherical, the outer cortical shell more or less\r\nelliptical. In the great majority of #Larcoidea# the latter arises in quite\r\na peculiar manner, three broad lattice-zones, which are developed in three\r\nplanes at right angles to each other, growing out from a small spherical or\r\nlentelliptical medullary shell, _Trizonium_, _Larnacilla_ (compare pp. 600,\r\n615, 628, &c.).\r\n\r\n  The trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell commences by the formation of a\r\n  transverse girdle, by the union of two lateral latticed processes, which\r\n  spring right and left in the equatorial plane from the poles of the\r\n  frontal axis of a lentelliptical medullary shell (_Monozonium_, p. 633,\r\n  Pl. 9, fig. 1). This is followed by a second lateral girdle, which lies\r\n  in the frontal plane and proceeds from its lateral poles (_Dizonium_, p.\r\n  634, Pl. 9, figs. 2, 3). Finally the sagittal girdle is formed, lying in\r\n  the sagittal plane and arising from the lateral girdle on the two poles\r\n  of the main axis (_Trizonium_, p. 637, Pl. 9, fig. 4). Whilst the gaps\r\n  between the three zones of this trizonal shell remain open in the\r\n  Pylonida, in _Larnacilla_, the important primitive form of the Larnacida,\r\n  they are closed by lattice-work (Pl. 50, figs. 3-8). From this trizonal\r\n  _Larnacilla_-shell the great majority of Larcoid shells may be derived.\r\n  Such a system of zones may be repeated (Diplozonaria) or even developed a\r\n  third time (Triplozonaria, p. 632). In most #Larcoidea# the zones are\r\n  secondarily connected by lattice-work. In the Tholonida (Pl. 10) each of\r\n  the two opposite latticed wings of a zone becomes a closed dome. In the\r\n  Zonarida (Pl. 50, figs. 9-12) these domes are partially or wholly\r\n  bisected by constrictions or latticed septa which are developed in the\r\n  three dimensive planes. The Lithelida (Pl. 49, figs. 1-7) are\r\n  characterised by the fact that one of each pair of opposite latticed\r\n  processes (or half zones) grows more strongly than the other, and that\r\n  the larger completely embraces the smaller so as to form a complicated\r\n  spiral. Whilst in this case the spiral lies in a plane, in the\r\n  Streblonida (Pl. 49, figs. 8, 9) it becomes turbinoid like a gastropod\r\n  shell and forms an ascending spiral. Finally, two small families of\r\n  #Larcoidea# are characterised by quite irregular growth (a very rare\r\n  occurrence among the Radiolaria); these are the simple-chambered\r\n  Phorticida (Pl. 49, figs. 10, 11) and the many chambered Soreumida (Pl.\r\n  49, figs. 12, 13). The phylogenetic relationship of these families of\r\n  #Larcoidea# is probably very complicated and demands closer investigation\r\n  (compare pp. 599-604).\r\n\r\n\r\n168. _Descent of the Polycyttaria._--The polyzootic or colonial Radiolaria,\r\nwhich we unite in the group Polycyttaria (sometimes known as \"Sphærozoea\"),\r\nbelong without doubt to the legion SPUMELLARIA, for they possess all the\r\npeculiarities by which these PERIPYLEA are distinguished from the other\r\nlegions of the Radiolaria. Only the morphological position of the\r\nPolycyttaria in that legion, and their phylogenetic relation to the\r\nmonozootic or solitary SPUMELLARIA, can be variously interpreted. The three\r\nfamilies which we distinguish among the Polycyttaria are so closely related\r\nto three different families of the Monocyttaria, that they may be directly\r\nderived from them by the formation of colonies. According to this\r\n_triphyletic hypothesis_ the social skeletonless Collozoida (Pl. 3) would\r\nbe descended from the solitary Thalassicollida (Pl. 1), the polyzootic\r\nSphærozoida with a Beloid skeleton (Pl. 4) from the monozootic\r\n{cxii}Thalassosphærida (Pl. 2), and the colonial Collosphærida with a\r\nSphæroid skeleton (Pls. 5-8) from the solitary Ethmosphærida (Pl. 12, &c.).\r\nMany species of monozootic and polyzootic forms in all three groups are so\r\nalike that they can only be distinguished by the fact that the one series\r\nare colonial, the others solitary. On the other hand, there are some\r\nreasons which would justify a monophyletic hypothesis for the Polycyttaria,\r\n_e.g._, the precocious nuclear division; in this case it would be most\r\nnatural to hold that the Sphærozoida and Collosphærida have arisen as two\r\ndiverging branches from the Collozoida, whilst the latter are nothing else\r\nthan colonial Thalassicollida.\r\n\r\n\r\n169. _Phylogeny of the Acantharia._--The legion ACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA is\r\ndistinguished by its peculiar acanthin skeleton, which develops\r\ncentrogenously, as well as by the disposition in groups of the pores in its\r\ncentral capsule, and its excentric usually precocious nucleus; it is thus\r\nso different from all other Radiolaria as undoubtedly to furnish,\r\nphylogenetically considered, an independent stem (§ 7). This stem is only\r\nconnected at the root by _Actinelius_ with the primitive form of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_. The stem is monophyletic, since all the forms\r\nbelonging to it may be derived without violence from _Actinelius_ as a\r\ncommon primitive form.\r\n\r\n\r\n170. _Origin of the Acantharia._--The genus _Actinelius_ (p. 730, Pl. 129,\r\nfig. 1), which may naturally be regarded as the common primitive form of\r\nall ACANTHARIA, possesses a spherical central capsule, which in consequence\r\nof the early division of the nucleus (§ 63), encloses numerous small\r\nnuclei; from its centre arise many simple radial spines of equal size,\r\nwhich penetrate the central capsule. A large number of radial pseudopodia\r\nissue between the spines from the sarcomatrix which surrounds the capsule.\r\n_Actinelius_ may have been directly derived from _Actissa_, the common\r\nstem-form of all Radiolaria, by the division of the pseudopodia into two\r\ngroups, myxopodia, which remained soft, and axopodia, which became firm (§\r\n95A). As the latter became changed into strong acanthin rods, and touched\r\neach other in the centre, they forced the nucleus from its originally\r\ncentral position and brought about its early division. _Actinelius_ is also\r\nof all Radiolaria the form which, next to _Actissa_, most nearly approaches\r\nthe Heliozoa. If the stiff axial threads of _Actinosphærium_ be conceived\r\nof as partially converted into acanthin spines, and its nucleated medullary\r\nsubstance as separated from the alveolar cortical layer by a membrane\r\n(central capsule), then _Actinelius_ would be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxiii}171. _Hypothetical Genealogical Tree of the Acantharia_:--\r\n\r\n                                Diploconida\r\n                                     |\r\n                                     |\r\n    Phractopeltida              Hexalaspida             Cenocapsida\r\n         |                           |                       |\r\n         |          Phatnaspida      |     Lychnaspida       |\r\n         |               |           |          |            |\r\n         |               |           |          |       Porocapsida\r\n         |               |      Coleaspida      |            |\r\n         |               |           |          |            |\r\n         |  Ceriaspida   +-----+-----+          |            |\r\n         |     |               |                |            |\r\n         +--+--+               |                |            |\r\n            |             Belonaspida           |            |\r\n            |                  |                |            |\r\n       Phractaspida            |           Stauraspida       |\r\n            |                  |                |            |\r\n            |                  |                |       Astrocapsida\r\n            |                  |                |       Sphærocapsida\r\n            +-------+----------+          ------+------      |\r\n                    |                           |            |\r\n                Diporaspida                Tessaraspida      |\r\n            (Dorataspida dipora)     (Dorataspida tetrapora) |\r\n                 |        |                 |          |     |\r\n                 |        +--------+--------+          |     |\r\n                 |                 |                   |     |\r\n                 |           [Dorataspida]             |     |\r\n                 |                                     |     |\r\n                 |                                     |     |\r\n                 |                Quadrilonchida       |     |\r\n                 |                     |               |     |\r\n          Phractacanthida              |      Stauracanthida |\r\n                 |                     |               |     |\r\n                 |    Amphilonchida    |               +--+--+\r\n                 |         |           |                  |\r\n                 |         |           |              Acanthonia\r\n                 |         |           |                  |\r\n                 +---------+--------+--+------------------+\r\n                                    |\r\n                              Astrolonchida\r\n                                    |\r\n             Litholophida           |              Chiastolida\r\n                  |                 |                   |\r\n                  |           Zygacanthida              |\r\n                  |            Acanthonida         Actinastrum\r\n                  |           Acanthometron             |\r\n  Astrolophida    |                 |                   |  Acanthochiasmida\r\n       |          |                 |                   |         |\r\n       |          |                 |                   |   Acanthometron\r\n       |          |                 |                   |         |\r\n       +----------+-----------------+-------------------+---------+\r\n                                    |\r\n                                Actinelida\r\n                                Actinelius\r\n                                    |\r\n                                    |\r\n                                 Actissa\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxiv}172. _Adelacantha and Icosacantha._--The numerous forms of\r\nACANTHARIA, here disposed in twelve families and sixty-five genera, may be\r\ndivided phylogenetically into two main groups of very different\r\nextent--_Adelacantha_ and _Icosacantha_. The more primitive group,\r\n_Adelacantha_, have an indefinite and variable number of radial spines,\r\nwhich are always quite simple in form and usually irregularly distributed;\r\nthis main division includes only the one order #Actinelida#, with six\r\ngenera, among which is _Actinelius_, the common stem-form of all the\r\nACANTHARIA. The more recent group, Icosacantha, includes all the other\r\nACANTHARIA (fifty-nine genera), and is very markedly distinguished from the\r\nAdelacantha by the fact that the radial spines are always twenty in number,\r\nand arranged according to Müller's law (compare pp. 717-725, and § 110).\r\nSince this regular disposition (in five alternating zones each of four\r\nspines) has been retained by inheritance in the whole of the Icosacantha,\r\nit is probable that this large group has been developed monophyletically\r\nfrom a twig of the Adelacantha; _Actinastrum_ (p. 732) and _Chiastolus_ (p.\r\n738) still present connecting links between the former and the latter,\r\nbetween _Actinelius_ and _Acanthometron_.\r\n\r\n\r\n173. _Acanthonida and Acanthophracta._--The extensive main division\r\nIcosacantha (§ 110), which embraces all ACANTHARIA with twenty radial\r\nspines, disposed according to Müller's law, may be subdivided into two\r\nlarge groups or orders:--the #Acanthonida# (p. 740, Pls. 130-132) and the\r\n#Acanthophracta# (p. 791, Pls. 133-140). The latter possess a complete\r\nextracapsular lattice-shell, which the former have not. The more recent\r\n#Acanthophracta# may be derived phylogenetically from the more primitive\r\n#Acanthonida# simply by the development of this lattice-shell, with which\r\nprocess are usually (perhaps always) connected certain alterations in the\r\nmalacoma, _e.g._, degeneration of the myophriscs (§ 96). The most primitive\r\nform of all Icosacantha is the genus _Acanthometron_ (p. 324), in which all\r\nthe twenty acanthin spines are of the simplest constitution and of equal\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n174. _Differentiation of the Acanthonida._--The order #Acanthonida#, which\r\nembraces all Icosacantha which have no complete lattice-shell, divides\r\nearly into three main branches, the three families Astrolonchida,\r\nQuadrilonchida, and Amphilonchida (p. 727, Pls. 130-132). The first of\r\nthese constitutes the common stem-group from which the other two as well as\r\nthe whole group #Acanthophracta# have been developed; the common stem-form\r\nof all is _Acanthometron_ (§ 173). All the Astrolonchida (p. 740, Pl. 130)\r\nhave twenty radial spines of equal size and similar form. On the other\r\nhand, in the Quadrilonchida (p. 766, Pl. 131) the four equatorial spines\r\ndiffer from the others in size and sometimes also in form. In the\r\nAmphilonchida (p. 781, Pl. 132) two opposite equatorial spines (lying in\r\nthe hydrotomical axis) are much larger than the other eighteen and of a\r\ndifferent shape. Of the three families of the #Acanthonida# the most\r\nimportant is the primitive group Astrolonchida, for from this the various\r\nstem-forms of the #Acanthophracta# arise. They are subdivided according to\r\nthe formation of the spines into three subfamilies: the Zygacanthida, with\r\nsimple spines without apophyses (or transverse processes); the\r\nPhractacanthida, with two opposite apophyses on each radial {cxv}spine, and\r\nthe Stauracanthida, with four crossed apophyses on each radial spine. The\r\nthree genera of the Zygacanthida represent the stem-forms of the three\r\nfamilies, since the radial spines in _Acanthometron_ (the most primitive\r\nform of #Acanthonida#) are cylindrical, in _Zygacantha_ two-edged, and in\r\n_Acanthonia_ four-edged (p. 741).\r\n\r\n\r\n175. _Capsophracta and Cladophracta._--The extensive order\r\n#Acanthophracta#, which embraces all ACANTHARIA with a complete\r\nlattice-shell, is polyphyletic, its main subdivisions have been developed\r\nindependently from different branches of the #Acanthonida#. The whole order\r\nmay be divided directly into two main groups, the #Capsophracta# and\r\n#Cladophracta# (p. 793), which differ in the structure and the origin of\r\ntheir lattice-shell. The group (or suborder) #Capsophracta# includes only\r\nthe single family Sphærocapsida (p. 795, Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135,\r\nfigs. 6-10); the lattice-shell arises independently of the twenty radial\r\nspines, being made up like a pavement of innumerable small acanthin plates,\r\nunited by a kind of cement; each plate being perforated by a fine pore. In\r\naddition twenty larger main pores (or groups of four pores each) are\r\npresent, corresponding to the twenty radial spines; these are always equal,\r\nquadrangular prismatic, without transverse processes as in _Acanthonia_. In\r\nthe #Cladophracta#, which include the five remaining families of the\r\n#Acanthophracta#, the structure and origin of the lattice-shell are quite\r\ndifferent; the lattice-shell is here made up of the branches of the\r\ntransverse processes, which radiate tangentially from the twenty radial\r\nspines and are only united secondarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n176. _Ascent of the Dorataspida._--The group #Cladophracta#, or those\r\nACANTHARIA whose lattice-shell arises by the union of transverse\r\nprocesses of the twenty radial spines, includes five different\r\nfamilies, whose stem-group is the family Dorataspida, with a simple\r\nspherical lattice-shell. This family itself is, however, diphyletic in\r\norigin, being composed of two essentially and originally different\r\nsubfamilies--Diporaspida and Tessaraspida (p. 803). The Diporaspida (p.\r\n808, Pls. 137, 138) have been developed from the Phractacanthida, and as\r\neach radial spine of the latter bears two opposite apophyses, so the\r\nlattice-shell of the former has forty primary aspinal pores (two on the\r\nbase of each spine). On the other hand, the Tessaraspida (p. 830, Pls. 135,\r\n136) have been developed from the Stauracanthida, and as each radial spine\r\nof the latter bears four crossed apophyses, so the lattice-shell of the\r\nformer has eighty primary aspinal pores (four at the base of each spine).\r\n\r\n\r\n177. _Descent of the Diporaspida._--Whilst the Tessaraspida (§ 176) have\r\ngiven rise to no new groups which could take rank as independent families,\r\nno less than four separate families of ACANTHARIA have arisen from the\r\nDiporaspida. The Phractopeltida (Pl. 133, figs. 1-6) are distinguished from\r\nall other ACANTHARIA by the possession of two concentric spherical\r\nlattice-shells, and have probably been developed from the {cxvi}Diporaspida\r\nin the same way as the Dyosphærida from the Monosphærida among the\r\n#Sphæroidea#; in that case the smaller inner lattice-sphere (medullary\r\nshell) would be the primary, and the larger outer sphere (cortical shell)\r\nthe secondary; this latter shows forty primary aspinal pores like those of\r\nthe Diporaspida. The possibility is not excluded, however, that the small\r\ninner lattice-sphere of the Phractopeltida is a secondary product. The\r\nthree remaining families, which must be regarded as descendants of the\r\nDiporaspida, form together a single phylogenetic series, and are separated\r\nfrom the primitive group mainly by the fact that the original spherical\r\nform of the lattice-shell has been modified into one distinguished by an\r\nelongated equatorial axis (the hydrotomical axis); hence the #Prunophracta#\r\n(pp. 794-859). The ellipsoidal Belonaspida have arisen directly by\r\nhypertrophy of the two opposite equatorial spines of this hydrotomical axis\r\n(p. 859, Pl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9; perhaps they have also\r\narisen directly from the Amphilonchida). In the lentelliptical Hexalaspida\r\n(Pl. 139) all six spines which lie in the hydrotomical meridian plane (two\r\nequatorial and four polar) are very strongly developed, the remaining\r\nfourteen being rudimentary. Finally, in the Diploconida the two conical\r\nsheaths of the two opposite hydrotomical equatorial spines are so\r\npredominant that they take the chief part in the formation of the\r\nhour-glass-shaped shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n178. _Phylogeny of the Nassellaria._--The legion NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA\r\nis so clearly characterised by the peculiar porochora, which closes the\r\nosculum at the oral pole of the monaxon central capsule, and by the\r\npodoconus connected with it, that there can be no doubt that\r\nphylogenetically it represents an independent stem (§ 8). This stem is only\r\nconnected at its base by means of _Cystidium_ and _Nassella_ with _Actissa_\r\nand _Thalassicolla_, the stem-forms of the SPUMELLARIA. This stem is\r\nmonophyletic, inasmuch as all its members may be derived without violence\r\nfrom the skeletonless Nassellida (_Nassella_, _Cystidium_, p. 896, Pl. 91,\r\nfig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n179. _Origin of the Nassellaria._--The Nassellida (p. 896), which may\r\nnaturally be considered as the common stem-group of the NASSELLARIA, are\r\nmost nearly related among other Radiolaria to the Thalassicollida, and in\r\nboth these skeletonless families the simplest forms, _Cystidium_ and\r\n_Actissa_ correspond; on the other hand, those which have arisen from them\r\nby the formation of alveoles in the calymma (_Nassella_ and\r\n_Thalassicolla_) also correspond. The origin of the simplest Nassellida\r\nfrom these primitive Thalassicollida may be explained by supposing that the\r\nnumerous (formerly evenly distributed) pores of the capsule membrane became\r\nobliterated in the upper (apical) half of the central capsule, whilst in\r\nthe lower (basal) half they became correspondingly more strongly developed;\r\nhence the porochora was formed at the oral pole of the vertical main axis,\r\nand a differentiation of the endoplasm proceeding from this gave rise to\r\nthe characteristic podoconus. Both these organs still at present exhibit\r\nvery various degrees of progressive development.\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxvii}180. _Hypothetical Genealogical Tree of the Nassellaria._\r\n\r\n                               CYRTOIDEA.\r\n                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n             BOTRYODEA        _Triradiata_\r\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n            Pylobotryida       Podocampida\r\n                 |                  |\r\n                 |   _Eradiata_     |    _Multiradiata_       SPYROIDEA\r\n                 |        |         |                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n                 |   Lithocampida   |     Phormocampida   Androspyrida\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |\r\n            Lithobotryida |     Podocyrtida      |            |\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |\r\n                 |    Theocyrtida   |      Phormocyrtida      |\r\n      Tholospyrida\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |        |\r\n            Cannobotryida | Tripocyrtida         |      Phormospyrida  |\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |        |\r\n                 |   Sethocyrtida   |       Anthocyrtida      |        |\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |        |\r\n                 |        |    Tripocalpida      |            |        |\r\n                 |        |         |            |            |        |\r\n                 |   Cyrtocalpida   |       Phænocalpida      +---+----+\r\n                 |        |         |            |                |\r\n  STEPHOIDEA     |        +---------+------------+           Zygospyrida\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~   |                  |                 (Spyroidea\r\n      triradiata)\r\n       Tympanida |             Tripocalpida                       |\r\n           |     |    (Cyrtoidea triradiata monocyrtida)          |\r\n           |     |                  |                             |\r\n  Coronida |     +------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n    |      |                        |\r\n    |   Semantida                   |\r\n    |      |                        |\r\n    +--+---+                   Cyrtellaria\r\n       |                            |\r\n       |      Cortiniscus           |\r\n       |            |               |\r\n  Stephanida        |               |\r\n       |            |               |\r\n       +-----+------+               |\r\n             |                      |\r\n           Cortina  *---------  Cortinida          (PLECTELLARIA)\r\n                                (Cortina)\r\n                                    |\r\n             Plectaniscus ---- Plagoniscus   ---- }\r\n                                    |             }\r\n             Tetraplecta  ---- Tetraplagia   ---- }  PLECTOIDEA\r\n                                    |             }  Plectanida\r\n             Plectophora  ----  Plagiacantha ---- }      |\r\n                                    |             }      |\r\n             Triplecta    ----  Triplagia    ---- }  Plagonida\r\n                                    |             }\r\n                                Nassoidea\r\n                               (Nassellida)\r\n                                    |\r\n                                Nassella\r\n                               (Cystidium)\r\n                                    |\r\n                                 Actissa\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxviii}181. _Plectellaria and Cyrtellaria._--The extensive legion\r\nNASSELLARIA far surpasses the other three legions in the endless variety of\r\nits skeletal structures, and owing to the complicated relationships of its\r\nnumerous families presents no lack of difficult phylogenetic problems. All\r\nNASSELLARIA may be divided first into two main groups or sublegions,\r\n#Plectellaria# and #Cyrtellaria#; the latter having a complete\r\nlattice-shell, the former not. Probably the #Cyrtellaria# have been\r\npolyphyletically developed from several different groups of #Plectellaria#.\r\nThese groups are, however, connected in such manifold ways that a\r\nmonophyletic origin of all the NASSELLARIAN skeletons from one original\r\nelement is possible. Such a primitive element may have been furnished by\r\nany one of three different skeletal parts, the sagittal ring, the basal\r\ntripod, and the latticed cephalis (compare pp. 891-895, Bütschli, L. N. 40,\r\n41).\r\n\r\n\r\n182. _Phylogenetic Skeletal Elements of the Nassellaria._--The multiform\r\nskeleton of the NASSELLARIA may be referred in different ways to one of the\r\nthree above-mentioned structural elements. Each of these (p. 891) may by\r\nitself form the skeleton; the sagittal ring in the simplest #Stephoidea#\r\n(_Archicircus_, _Lithocircus_), the basal tripod in the simplest\r\n#Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Plagiacantha_), the latticed cephalis in the\r\nsimplest #Cyrtoidea# (_Cyrtocalpis_, _Archicapsa_). In the great majority\r\nof the NASSELLARIA, however, two of these elements, or even all three, are\r\nfound combined. In most #Cyrtellaria#, more especially, both the sagittal\r\nring and the basal tripod may be recognised in the lattice-shell, though\r\noften only in slight rudiments or scarcely perceptible traces. In the\r\n#Plectellaria# also (which possess no latticed cephalis) there are\r\nindividual genera with complete development both of the sagittal ring and\r\nbasal tripod; this important combination is especially well represented in\r\nthe Cortinida (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, _Stephanium_, _Stephaniscus_,\r\n_Tripocoronis_, &c.). The greatest difficulty as regards the phylogeny of\r\nthe NASSELLARIA lies in the fact that the most various combinations of the\r\nthree elements are presented by closely related or very similar forms. If,\r\nin spite of this, a monophyletic hypothesis as to the origin of the\r\nNASSELLARIA seems essential all sides of the three possible hypotheses must\r\nreceive full consideration and critical comparison (§§ 183-191).\r\n\r\n\r\n183. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Plectoidea._--The monophyletic\r\nhypothesis (No. 2, p. 893) which regards the basal tripod as the common\r\norigin of the skeleton of all NASSELLARIA, starts from the simplest forms\r\nof the #Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Plagoniscus_, _Triplecta_,\r\n_Plectaniscus_, &c., Pl. 91). All #Plectoidea# may be immediately derived\r\nas diverging twigs of these, as well as all triradial and multiradial forms\r\nof #Cyrtoidea# and #Spyroidea#; for in all these cases the distinctive\r\ntriradial (or the derived multiradial) form of skeleton appears directly\r\nderivable from the simple basal tripod of the former. The same is perhaps\r\nalso true of many #Botryodea#. {cxix}Furthermore, certain important forms\r\nof #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, _Stephanium_, _Stephaniscus_,\r\n&c.), which have a characteristic combination of the sagittal ring and\r\nbasal tripod, may be immediately derived from such forms of #Plectoidea# as\r\n_Plagoniscus cortinaris_, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, _Plectaniscus\r\ncortiniscus_, &c. On the contrary, those #Stephoidea# and #Cyrtoidea# in\r\nwhich the basal tripod is wanting can only be derived from the #Plectoidea#\r\nby the assumption that this structure has disappeared in consequence of\r\nphylogenetic degeneration. The monophyletic derivation of the NASSELLARIA\r\nfrom the #Plectoidea# has more internal probability than that from the\r\n#Stephoidea#, since it is easier to suppose that the Cortinida (_Cortina_,\r\n_Stephanium_, &c.) have been derived from the #Plectoidea# (_Plagoniscus_,\r\n_Plagiocarpa_) than the converse. This view is the basis of the\r\nhypothetical tree shown in § 180.\r\n\r\n\r\n184. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Stephoidea._--The monophyletic\r\nhypothesis (No. 1, p. 893) which regards the primary sagittal ring as the\r\ncommon starting point of the skeleton in all NASSELLARIA, starts from the\r\nsimplest forms of #Stephoidea# (_Archicircus_, _Lithocircus_, &c., Pl. 81).\r\nAll #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea# may be immediately derived from these, as\r\nalso the majority of the #Cyrtoidea# and probably of the #Botryodea#. Those\r\nnumerous forms of the last two groups, however, which possess no trace of a\r\nsagittal ring, can only be derived from the former by the supposition that\r\nthe latter has completely disappeared in in consequence of gradual\r\nphylogenetic degeneration. The same holds true also of the #Plectoidea#,\r\nalthough certain forms (_e.g._, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, Pl. 91, fig. 5;\r\n_Plectaniscus cortiniscus_, Pl. 91, fig. 9) appear to indicate the\r\ncommencing formation of the sagittal ring by the concrescence of two\r\nbranches, which approach each other from the upper part of the apical rod\r\nand the ventral part of the basal rod. In any case, it is a fact of great\r\nphylogenetic significance, that the primary sagittal ring in the cephalis\r\nof the #Cyrtoidea# shows all conceivable stages of degeneration (compare\r\nBütschli, L. N. 40, 41, as well as the general account of and critical\r\ncomparison of the NASSELLARIA, pp. 889-895, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n185. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Cyrtoidea._--The monophyletic\r\nhypothesis (No. 3, p. 894) which regards the latticed cephalis as the\r\ncommon point of origin of all the skeletons of the NASSELLARIA, starts from\r\nthe simplest forms of the #Cyrtoidea#, that is, from the Cyrtocalpida or\r\neradial Monocyrtida (_Archicorida_, _Archicapsida_, Pls. 51, 52, 98). All\r\n#Cyrtoidea# and #Botryodea# may be regarded as divergent forms of these\r\nmonothalamous #Cyrtoidea#; the polythalamous simply by the addition of\r\nfresh joints at the basal pole, the triradiate and multiradiate by the\r\ndevelopment of three or more apophyses. The origin of the sagittal ring\r\n(which presents every stage of development and degeneration in the\r\n#Cyrtoidea#) may be regarded as a mechanical thickening of the latticed\r\nplate in the sagittal circumference of the cephalis. By stronger\r\n{cxx}development of this ring and coincident sagittal constriction of the\r\ncephalis the order #Spyroidea# may be derived from the #Cyrtoidea#.  On the\r\nother hand, the #Plectellaria#, which possess no cephalis, and indeed no\r\ncomplete lattice-shell whatever, may be derived from the Monocyrtida by the\r\nassumption of a degeneration of this structure; the sagittal ring having\r\nbeen preserved in the #Stephoidea#, and the tripod of the Tripocalpida in\r\nthe #Plectoidea#. Although such a monophyletic derivation of the\r\nNASSELLARIA from the Cyrtocalpida is possible, and though here, too, the\r\nCortinida play an important part as connecting links, this hypothesis has\r\nless internal probability than that of the derivation from the #Stephoidea#\r\n(§ 184) or #Plectoidea# (§ 183).\r\n\r\n\r\n186. _Genealogical Tree of the Plectoidea._--The order #Plectoidea#\r\nincludes those NASSELLARIA whose rudimentary skeleton does not contain the\r\ncharacteristic sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#, but consists of several\r\n(at least three) radial spines, which proceed from a point in the centre of\r\nthe porochora. The branches of these radial spines remain free in the\r\nPlagonida, whilst in the Plectanida they unite with each other to form a\r\nloose meshwork (not, however, a complete lattice-shell). The number and\r\narrangement of the radial spines, which serve for generic distinctions, are\r\nthe same in both families, so that each genus of the Plectanida has arisen\r\nfrom a corresponding genus of the Plagonida. The simplest Plagonida, which\r\npossess a basal tripod (_Triplagia_ or _Plagiacantha_ with three rays,\r\n_Tetraplagia_ with four rays) are probably to be regarded as forming the\r\ncommon origin of the whole order. These agree with certain three- and\r\nfour-rayed skeletal pieces of the #Beloidea# (Thalassosphærida and\r\nSphærozoida); and also the four and six-rayed twinned pieces of the latter\r\n(spicula bigemina and trigemina) repeat in the same fashion the skeleton of\r\nthe former (_Plagonidium_, _Plagonium_). This similarity, however, is a\r\nmere analogy and possesses no phylogenetic significance. On the other hand,\r\ncertain Plagonida (_Plagoniscus_, _Plagiocarpa_), and the corresponding\r\ngenera of Plectanida (_Plectaniscus_, _Periplecta_) seem to have important\r\nphylogenetic relations to certain #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_,\r\n&c.); the sagittal ring of the latter having perhaps arisen by the vertical\r\napical spine of the former having been connected with their horizontal\r\nbasal rod by two ventral apophyses growing out opposite to each other\r\n(compare pp. 902, 914, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, Pl. 91, fig. 5). In this\r\ncase the Plectanida would belong to the simplest stem-forms of the\r\nNASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. _Genealogical Tree of the Stephoidea._--The order #Stephoidea#\r\nincludes all those NASSELLARIA whose skeleton does not form a complete\r\nlattice-shell, but consists of one or more rings, and often of a loose\r\nmeshwork which arises by the union of branches of the rings. A _vertical\r\nsagittal ring_ is constantly present, embracing the central capsule in the\r\nmedian sagittal plane, and forming at its basal pole various processes, the\r\nstarting point for other skeletal forms. The most important of these is the\r\ntripodal _Cortina_ {cxxi}(p. 950, § 182). The Stephanida are the most\r\narchaic family among the #Stephoidea# (p. 937, Pl. 81), perhaps indeed\r\namong all the NASSELLARIA (§ 184); in them the sagittal ring and its\r\nprocesses alone constitute the skeleton; secondary rings and meshes are\r\nwanting. Two diverging families, the Semantida and Coronida, have been\r\ndeveloped from the Stephanida, and from one of them the family Tympanida\r\nhas arisen.\r\n\r\n  The Semantida (p. 953, Pl. 92) develop a horizontal basal ring at the\r\n  oral side of the vertical sagittal ring; the basal meshes or lattice\r\n  gates, which remain between the former and the latter, are the important\r\n  cortinar pores (one pair jugular, one pair cardinal, p. 954); they\r\n  usually appear inherited in the cortinar septum of the #Cyrtellaria#. In\r\n  the Coronida (p. 967, Pls. 82, 94) a second vertical ring (the frontal\r\n  ring) appears in addition to the sagittal ring; it lies in the frontal\r\n  plane at right angles to the latter. Finally the Tympanida (p. 987, Pls.\r\n  93, 94) have probably arisen from the Semantida by the formation of a\r\n  second horizontal ring (mitral ring) parallel to the basal and attached\r\n  to the upper portion of the sagittal ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n188. _Genealogical Tree of the Spyroidea._--The extensive order #Spyroidea#\r\nis of especial interest in connection with the phylogeny of the\r\nNASSELLARIA, since all its members show two well-developed skeletal\r\nelements in combination, the sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea# and the\r\nlatticed cephalis of the #Cyrtoidea#; the majority possess also the basal\r\ntripod of the #Plectoidea# (or a radial skeleton derived from it). Hence\r\nthere is a possibility of deriving the stem-forms of the #Spyroidea# from\r\neach of these three groups. The four families of this order exhibit similar\r\nrelationships to those of the four families of #Cyrtoidea#; the common\r\nstem-group is the family Zygospyrida; from this the Tholospyrida have\r\narisen by the development of a galea on the apical pole, the Phormospyrida\r\nby the addition of a thorax on the basal pole. The Androspyrida may be\r\nderived either from the Tholospyrida by the formation of a basal thorax, or\r\nfrom the Phormospyrida by the development of an apical galea. Some groups,\r\nhowever, such as the peculiar Nephrospyrida (Pl. 90) have probably been\r\ndeveloped directly from the #Stephoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n189. _Genealogical Tree of the Botryodea._--The peculiar order #Botryodea#\r\n(p. 1103), which is both difficult to investigate and insufficiently known,\r\npresents great phylogenetic difficulties both as to its ascent and descent.\r\nProbably the different genera of this order have been polyphyletically\r\ndeveloped from different groups of #Cyrtoidea# (perhaps also to some extent\r\nof #Spyroidea#) by the formation of lobes in the cephalis. The three\r\nfamilies of #Botryodea# are related to each other in the same way as are\r\nthe three first families of the #Cyrtoidea#. From the single-jointed\r\nCannobotryida (corresponding to the Monocyrtida), the two-jointed\r\nLithobotryida (corresponding to the Dicyrtida), may be derived by the\r\ndevelopment of a basal thorax, and from the latter the three-jointed\r\nPylobotryida (like the Tricyrtida) by the addition of an abdomen. In the\r\nlast two families the forms with an open basal mouth {cxxii}(Botryopylida\r\nand Botryocyrtida) are to be regarded as primitive: the Botryocellida and\r\nBotryocampida have arisen by the closure of this mouth with a basal\r\nlattice-plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n190. _Genealogical Tree of the Cyrtoidea._--The multiform and extensive\r\ngroup #Cyrtoidea# presents the greatest difficulties to be found in the\r\nphylogeny of the NASSELLARIA, because their morphological relations are\r\nmost complicated, and because similar forms very often appear to be of\r\nquite different origin. The great majority of the #Cyrtoidea# show more or\r\nless clearly a combination of the three structural elements: sagittal ring,\r\nbasal tripod, and latticed cephalis (p. 891). There are also, however,\r\nnumerous #Cyrtoidea#, whose skeleton no longer shows any trace of the\r\nsagittal ring. Many of these show as the basis of the skeleton a strong\r\nbasal tripod with an apical spine, around which the cephalis has obviously\r\nbeen secondarily developed, _e.g._, the remarkable Euscenida (p. 1146, Pls.\r\n53, 97) and the interesting Callimitrida (p. 1217, Pls. 63, 64). These may\r\nhave been derived immediately from the #Plectoidea# without any relation to\r\nthe #Stephoidea#. There are also numerous true Monocyrtida, whose shell\r\nconsists of a simple latticed cephalis without a trace of the sagittal ring\r\nor basal tripod (Cyrtocalpida, Pl. 51, figs. 9-13; Pl. 98, fig. 13); these\r\nmay have been developed directly from the skeletonless Nassellida by the\r\nformation of a simple ovoid _Gromia_-like shell, and may have no relation\r\neither to the #Stephoidea# or #Plectoidea#. On these grounds, as well as\r\nfrom the complicated relationships of the many smaller groups of\r\n#Cyrtoidea#, it is probable that the whole order has been developed\r\npolyphyletically from different divisions of the #Plectellaria#.\r\n\r\n\r\n191. _Systematic Arrangement of the Cyrtoidea._--Although for the reasons\r\njust given no systematic arrangement of the #Cyrtoidea# can at present, or\r\nfor a long time in the future, be regarded as other than artificial, yet\r\nsome general principles of classification for this extensive group can be\r\nlaid down, which may serve as starting points for some future natural\r\ndisposition. This is especially true of the relations which in an\r\nartificial system (p. 1129) were primarily utilised for the distinction of\r\ntwelve families and twenty-four subfamilies; the number of segments in the\r\nshell, the number of radial apophyses (and parameres), and the constitution\r\nof the basal aperture of the shell.\r\n\r\n  As regards the _number of segments_, separated by transverse\r\n  constrictions, of which the shell is composed, it is dependent upon the\r\n  secondary addition of new joints at the basal pole of the main axis.\r\n  Hence all many-jointed #Cyrtoidea# are to be derived from single-jointed\r\n  ones, and the four sections thus distinguished (Monocyrtida, Dicyrtida,\r\n  Tricyrtida, Stichocyrtida) form a phylogenetic series. Very often,\r\n  however, the primary cephalis disappears owing to retrograde\r\n  metamorphosis; and in such cases the single joint of the apparent\r\n  Monocyrtida is formed of the thorax (_e.g._, {cxxiii}Pls. 52, 54, &c.).\r\n  As regards the _number of radial apophyses_, three sections of\r\n  #Cyrtoidea# may be distinguished;  the Pilocyrtida with three, the\r\n  Astrocyrtida with numerous apophyses, and the Corocyrtida with none (p.\r\n  1129). The last two may in general be regarded as two divergent branches\r\n  from the first, for the eradiate Corocyrtida have probably been formed\r\n  from the triradial Pilocyrtida by entire loss of the radial apophyses,\r\n  whilst on the other hand the multiradiate Astrocyrtida have arisen from\r\n  them by additions to the primary apophyses (interpolation of interradial\r\n  between the perradial ones). As regards the _constitution of the\r\n  shell-aperture_, the #Cyrtoidea# may be divided into Cyrtaperta and\r\n  Cyrtoclausa (p. 1129); in general the Cyrtoclausa (with latticed\r\n  shell-aperture) have arisen from the Cyrtaperta (with simple open mouth);\r\n  in many Monocyrtida the converse may be supposed, the  simple basal mouth\r\n  having been formed by degeneration of a basal lattice.\r\n\r\n\r\n192. _Phylogeny of the Phæodaria._--The legion PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is\r\nso clearly marked off from other Radiolaria by the double membrane of the\r\ncentral capsule and the astropyle at its oral pole, as well as by the\r\nextracapsular phæodium, that it must be regarded phylogenetically as an\r\nindependent stem (§ 9). This stem is only connected at its root by\r\n_Phæodina_ with the stem-form of the SPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_. The stem\r\nitself is monophyletic, inasmuch it its members may be derived without\r\nviolence from the skeletonless Phæodinida (_Phæodina_, _Phæocolla_). On the\r\nother hand, the formation of the skeleton of the PHÆODARIA is undoubtedly\r\npolyphyletic, different Phæodinida having independently commenced the\r\nformation of a skeleton and having carried it out in very different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n193. _Origin of the Phæodaria._--The Phæodinida (p. 1544, Pl. 101), which\r\nmay naturally be regarded as the common stem-group of the PHÆODARIA, have\r\ntheir nearest relations among other Radiolaria in the Thalassicollida (p.\r\n10); and since this family is to be regarded as the primitive group of all\r\nRadiolaria, they may be directly derived from them phylogenetically. The\r\nessential modifications by which the primitive Phæodinida have arisen from\r\nthe more archaic Thalassicollida are of three kinds; (1) the doubling of\r\nthe membrane of the central capsule; (2) the reduction of the numerous fine\r\npores in the membrane and the formation of an osculum, and of an astropyle\r\nclosing it, at the oral pole of the main axis; (3) the production of an\r\nextracapsular phæodium.  This last may, perhaps, be regarded as a\r\nunilateral hypertrophy of the voluminous pigment masses which are deposited\r\nin the sarcomatrix of certain Thalassicollida. Of the two genera of\r\nPhæodinida hitherto known, probably _Phæodina_ (Pl. 101, fig. 2) approaches\r\nthe original stem of the PHÆODARIA more nearly than _Phæocolla_ (Pl. 101,\r\nfig. 1), for the latter exhibits only the large main opening of the central\r\ncapsule (astropyle), whilst the former possesses also a pair of accessory\r\nopenings (parapylæ). The hypothetical stem-form (_Phæometra_) presumably\r\nhad a larger number of small parapylæ (like many Circoporida and\r\nTuscarorida), and the astropyle was probably but little differentiated from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxxiv}194. _Hypothetical Genealogical tree of the Phæodaria:_--\r\n\r\n                             PHÆOCONCHIA\r\n                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n        PHÆOSPHÆRIA        Coeloplegmida           PHÆOGROMIA\r\n     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        |                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n  Aularida                      |                Tuscarorida\r\n     |                          |                   |\r\n     |Aulonida                  |  Coelodrymida     |\r\n     |   |                      |        |          |\r\n     +---+                Coelotholida   |          |\r\n       |                  Coelographida  |          |   Haeckelinida\r\n       |                        |        |          |           |\r\n       |            Conchopsida |  Coelodorida      |           |\r\n  Aulosphærida           |      | Coelodendrida     |Circogonida|\r\n       |                 |      +----+---+          |     |     |\r\n       |            Conchasmida      |              |     |     |\r\n       |             Concharida      |              |     |     |\r\n       |   Sagmarida     +-----------+              |     +--+--+\r\n       |        |                |                  |        |\r\n  Cannosphærida |                |Castanellida      |  Circoporida\r\n       |        |                |     |            |        |\r\n       |        |Oroscenida  Concharida|            +------+-+\r\n       |        |     |          |     |                   |\r\n       |    Sagenida  |          |     |                   |\r\n       | Sagophærida  |          |     |Gazellettida       |\r\n       |        |     |          |     |     |             |\r\n       |        |  Oronida       |     |     |Pharyngellida|\r\n       |        |Orosphærida     |     |     |      |      |\r\n       |        |     |          |     |     |      |      |\r\n       +--------+-----+          |     |     |      |      |\r\n                |                |     |     |      |      |\r\n                +--------------+-+     |     |      |      |\r\n                               |       |Euphysettida|      |\r\n                               |       |Medusettida |      |\r\n                               |       |     |      |      |\r\n                               |       |     |Lithogromida |\r\n                               |       |     |Challengerida|\r\n                           Phæodinida  |     |      |      |\r\n                               |       |     |      |      |\r\n            PHÆOCYSTINA        |       +-----+-+----+      |\r\n       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    |               |           |\r\n   Aulacanthida                |               |           |\r\n       |Cannobelida Catinulida |               +------+----+\r\n       |    |             |    |                      |\r\n       |    | Dictyochida |    |                      |\r\n       |    |     |       |    |                      |\r\n       |    +-----+-------+    |                      |\r\n       |          |            |                  Phæodinida\r\n       |    Cannorrhaphida     |       Phæodinida     |\r\n       |          |            |           |          |\r\n       +----------+------------+----+------+----------+\r\n                                    |\r\n                                 Phæodina\r\n                                    |\r\n                               (Phæometra)\r\n                                    |\r\n                                 Actissa\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxxv}195. _Phæocystina and Phæocoscina._--Whilst the malacoma of all\r\nPHÆODARIA possesses the characteristics of the legion, and hence justifies\r\nthe assumption of a monophyletic origin, the skeleton, on the other hand,\r\nshows in the different groups such manifold and fundamental variations that\r\na polyphyletic origin of the latter is indubitable. Different Phæodinida\r\nhave commenced the formation of the skeleton independently, and it has\r\nprogressed in different directions. In the #Phæocystina# it remained\r\nincomplete and led to the formation of various Beloid skeletons, whilst the\r\n#Phæocoscina# developed complete lattice-shells. Both of these divisions\r\ntoo are to be regarded as polyphyletic, since the skeletal forms of the\r\ndifferent groups cannot be derived without violence from a common primitive\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n196. _Phæocystina with a Beloid Skeleton._--The order #Phæocystina#\r\nincludes all PHÆODARIA which have no complete lattice-shell; it contains,\r\nfirstly, the skeletonless Phæodinida (the common stem-group of the legion),\r\nand secondly, the Phæacanthida, or PHÆODARIA with a Beloid skeleton (§\r\n115). The latter are divisible into several very different groups (at least\r\ntwo or three) which are probably different in origin. The Aulacanthida\r\n(Pls. 102-105) form radial tubes which perforate the calymma, their\r\nproximal end resting upon the surface of the central capsule, whilst the\r\ndistal extremity projects freely outwards. The skeleton of the\r\nCannorrhaphida, on the other hand, is composed of many separate portions\r\nwhich are never radially arranged but are either placed tangentially to the\r\nsurface of the calymma or scattered irregularly in its gelatinous mass.\r\nFurthermore, in the three subfamilies of which this family is composed, the\r\nindividual skeletal portions are so different that they have probably\r\narisen independently of each other; in the Cannobelida they form\r\ncylindrical tangential tubes (Pl. 101, figs. 3-5), in the Catinulida flat\r\nbasin or cap-like structures (Pl. 117, fig. 8), in the Dictyochida hollow\r\nrings, from which small pyramids are developed by unilateral formation of\r\nlattice-work (Pl. 101, figs. 9-14; Pl. 114, figs. 7-12).\r\n\r\n\r\n197. _Phæosphæria with a Sphæroid Skeleton._--The order #Phæosphæria#\r\nincludes those PHÆODARIA which possess a spherical (sometimes slightly\r\nmodified) lattice-shell without the characteristic aperture of the\r\n#Phæogromia#. They have probably arisen independently of these, though they\r\nmay have been derived from the Castanellida by loss of the shell-aperture,\r\nwhich was present originally. The four families which we have distinguished\r\namong the #Phæosphæria#, are so different in the structure of their\r\nlattice-shell that their phylogenetic connection is doubtful. In the\r\nOrosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) and the Sagosphærida (Pl. 108) the whole\r\nlattice-shell consists of a single piece and is unjointed (without astral\r\nsepta); in the former it is very firm and massive, with thick laminated\r\ntrabeculæ and polygonal meshes; in the latter it is very delicate and\r\nbrittle, with filiform trabeculæ and large {cxxvi}triangular meshes.  On\r\nthe other hand, the voluminous shell of the Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111),\r\nand of the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112), is characterised by a very peculiar\r\nsystem of joints; it is composed of numerous separate cylindrical tubes,\r\nwhich are placed tangentially and united at the nodes by stellate\r\npartitions or astral septa. The Cannosphærida possess further a simple\r\ncentral Cyrtoid shell, connected with the outer jointed shell by hollow\r\nradial trabeculæ. Since many Aulosphærida possess rudiments of such\r\ncentripetal trabeculæ it is possible that these latter have been derived\r\nfrom the former by the loss of the central Cyrtoid shell; the formation of\r\nthis monaxon shell perhaps indicates descent from the #Phæogromia#\r\n(Castanellida).\r\n\r\n\r\n198. _Phæogromia with a Cyrtoid Skeleton._--That order of the PHÆODARIA\r\nwhich we designate #Phæogromia#, contains many very different forms, all\r\nagreeing in the possession of a Cyrtoid skeleton, or a monaxon\r\nlattice-shell, which has a large aperture at one pole of its vertical main\r\naxis (§ 123). This Cyrtoid skeleton is sometimes ovoid or conical,\r\nsometimes lentiform or helmet-shaped, sometimes polyhedral or almost\r\nspherical. Although the principle of its structure is simple and often like\r\nthat of the Monocyrtida among the NASSELLARIA, yet the structure of the\r\nwall and of the apophyses is so different in the various groups of the\r\n#Phæogromia#, that the order is probably polyphyletic, and its Cyrtoid\r\nshells have arisen independently of each other. Only in the Castanellida\r\n(Pl. 113) does the shell-wall usually consist of simple lattice-work; in\r\nthe Challengerida, on the other hand (Pl. 99), it has an extremely fine\r\nDiatom-like structure; in the Medusettida (Pls. 118-128) a peculiar\r\nalveolar structure, and in the Circoporida (Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida\r\n(Pl. 100) it possesses a characteristic porcellanous constitution (with\r\ntangential spicules in a porous cement-mass); in the latter of these groups\r\nthe surface is smooth, in the former peculiarly tabulate; the two families\r\nhave also different stem-forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n199. _Phæoconchia with a Conchoid Shell._--The order #Phæoconchia# (Pls.\r\n121-128) is separated not only from all other PHÆODARIA, but also from all\r\nother Radiolaria, by the possession of a bivalved shell resembling that of\r\na Lamellibranch; the two valves of this Conchoid skeleton are to be\r\ninterpreted as dorsal and ventral (§ 128). Probably these bivalved shells\r\nare independent products, but possibly they may have been formed by the\r\nbisection of a simple spherical lattice-shell; in the former case the\r\n#Phæoconchia# would be directly descended from the Phæodinida, in the\r\nlatter from the Castanellida. The three families which we have\r\ndistinguished among the #Phæoconchia#, probably constitute a connected\r\nstem, the most primitive group of which are the Concharida (Pls. 123-125).\r\nFrom these the Coelodendrida (Pls. 121, 122) have next arisen by the\r\nformation of a \"galea\" upon the apex of each valve, and the growth of\r\nhollow tubes from this helmet-like structure. Finally, the Coelographida\r\n{cxxvii}(Pls. 120-128) have been developed from the Coelodendrida by the\r\nformation of a basal nasal tube (rhinocanna) from each galea, and the\r\nformation of a median or paired frenulum, which connects the opening of the\r\nnasal tube with the apex of the galea. In the Coelodendrida, as well as in\r\nthe Coelographida, there are two different subfamilies, of which the more\r\nprimitive (Coelodorida, Coelotholida) have free branches from the hollow\r\nradial tubes, whilst the more recent (Coelodrymida, Coeloplegmida) form an\r\nouter bivalved shell by anastomosis of the branches of the tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n200. _The Fundamental Biogenetic Law._--The causal connection between\r\nontogeny and phylogeny, which finds its most precise statement in the\r\nfundamental biogenetic law, holds in general for the Radiolaria as for all\r\nother organisms. In order to furnish direct proof of this, however, a\r\ncomplete empirical knowledge both of individual and of palæontological\r\ndevelopment would be necessary. In both these directions, as has been shown\r\nin the foregoing chapters, our knowledge of the Radiolaria is very\r\nincomplete and fragmentary, but still we are able to convince ourselves\r\nindirectly of the validity of the law as applied to Radiolaria by the aid\r\nof comparative anatomy. This is now so fully known to us (§§ 1-140) that we\r\nare able not only to draw a complete and satisfactory picture of their\r\nmorphology, but also to arrive at most important conclusions regarding the\r\nontogeny and phylogeny of the individual groups. As regards the formation\r\nof the multiform skeleton of the Radiolaria, most of the ontogenetic series\r\nof forms, with which we have become acquainted by comparative anatomy, are\r\nof _palingenetic_ nature; that is, they are primarily due to inheritance\r\nand thus of direct phylogenetic significance. On the other hand, among the\r\nontogenetic phenomena of the Radiolaria, as far as they have yet been\r\ninvestigated, only very few are _cenogenetic_, that is, brought about by\r\nadaptive modification and without direct significance as regards phylogeny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxxviii}PHYSIOLOGICAL SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--VEGETATIVE FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\n(§§ 201-217.)\r\n\r\n201. _Mechanism of the Functions._--The vital phenomena of the Radiolaria\r\nare dependent upon the mechanical functions of their unicellular body, and\r\nlike those of all other organisms, are to be referred to physical and\r\nchemical natural laws. All processes which appear in the life of the\r\nRadiolaria are, therefore, ultimately to be explained by the attraction and\r\nrepulsion of the smallest particles, which compose the different portions\r\nof their unicellular body; and the sensation of pleasure or the opposite is\r\nin its turn the exciting cause of these elementary movements. Many adaptive\r\narrangements in the Radiolarian organism may produce the appearance of\r\nbeing the premeditated result of causes working towards an end\r\n(\"zweckthätig,\" _causæ finales_), but as opposed to this deceptive\r\nappearance it must here be expressly stated that these may be recognised in\r\naccordance with the developmental theory as the necessary consequence of\r\nmechanical causes (_causæ efficientes_).\r\n\r\n  Our _physiological_ acquaintance with the Radiolaria has by no means\r\n  progressed so far as our _morphological_, so that the incomplete\r\n  communications which are placed here for the sake of completeness must be\r\n  regarded merely as preliminary fragments, not as fully elaborated\r\n  results. Since my recent investigations have been mainly in the direction\r\n  of morphology, I can add but little to the physiological conclusions,\r\n  which I stated at length in my monograph twenty-four years ago (L. N. 16,\r\n  pp. 127-165). Recently the vegetative physiology of the Radiolaria has\r\n  been much advanced by the recognition of the symbiosis with the Xanthellæ\r\n  (§ 205, L. N. 22, 39, 42). In addition Karl Brandt has recently (1885)\r\n  published several important contributions to the physiology of the\r\n  Polycyttaria or Sphaerozoea (L. N. 52).\r\n\r\n\r\n202. _Distribution of Functions._--The distribution of the functions among\r\nthe various parts of the unicellular organism of the Radiolaria corresponds\r\ndirectly to their anatomical composition, so that physiologically as well\r\nas morphologically the central capsule and the extracapsulum appear as the\r\ntwo coordinated main components. On the one hand the _central capsule_ with\r\nits endoplasm and enclosed nucleus is the central organ of the \"cell-soul\"\r\n(Zellseele), the unit regulating its animal and vegetative functions, and\r\nthe special organ of reproduction and inheritance. The _extracapsulum_\r\nforms, on the other hand, by its calymma the protective envelope of the\r\ncentral {cxxix}capsule, the support of the soft pseudopodia and the\r\nsubstratum of the skeleton; the calymma acts also as a hydrostatic\r\napparatus, whilst the radiating pseudopodia are of the greatest importance\r\nboth as organs of nutrition and adaptation, as well as of motion and\r\nsensation (§ 15). If, however, the vital functions as a whole be divided in\r\naccordance with the usual convention into the two great groups of\r\n_vegetative_ (nutrition and reproduction) and _animal_ (motion and\r\nsensation), then the central capsule would be mainly the organ of\r\nreproduction and sensation, and the extracapsulum the organ of nutrition\r\nand motion.\r\n\r\n  The numerous separate vital phenomena, which by accurate physiological\r\n  investigation may be distinguished in the unicellular Radiolarian\r\n  organism, may be distributed in the above indicated conventional fashion\r\n  into a few larger and several smaller groups; it must always be borne in\r\n  mind, however, that these overlap in many respects, and that the division\r\n  of labour among the different organs in these Protista is somewhat\r\n  complicated, notwithstanding the apparent simplicity of their unicellular\r\n  organization. A general classification of the groups of functions is\r\n  difficult, because each individual organ discharges several different\r\n  functions. Thus the central capsule is pre-eminently the organ of\r\n  reproduction and inheritance, but not less (though less conspicuous) is\r\n  its importance as the psychical central organ, the unit regulating the\r\n  processes of sensation, motion, and also nutrition. In this last respect\r\n  it is comparable to the nerve-centres of the Metazoa, whilst the\r\n  peripheral nervous system of the latter (including the organs of sense\r\n  and the muscles) are in the present instance represented by the\r\n  pseudopodia, which are at the same time the most important organs of\r\n  nutrition and adaptation. In the calymma also in similar fashion several\r\n  different physiological functions are united.\r\n\r\n\r\n203. _Metastasis._--The functions of metastasis and nutrition have in all\r\nRadiolaria a purely animal character, so that these Rhizopoda from the\r\nphysiological standpoint are to be regarded as truly _unicellular animals_,\r\nor Protozoa (\"Urthiere\"). Since they do not possess, like plants, the power\r\nof forming synthetically the compounds (protoplasm, carbohydrates, &c.)\r\nnecessary for their sustenance, they are compelled to obtain them\r\nready-formed from other organisms. Like other true animals they evolve\r\ncarbon dioxide by the partial oxidation of those products, and hence they\r\nsuccessively take up the oxygen necessary to their existence from their\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n  The question whether the Radiolaria are to be regarded as true animals I\r\n  discussed fully from various points of view in 1862, and finally answered\r\n  in the affirmative (L. N. 16, pp. 159-165). Afterwards, when in my\r\n  Generelle Morphologie (1866) I sought to establish the kingdom Protista,\r\n  I removed the Radiolaria along with the other Rhizopoda from the animal\r\n  kingdom proper and placed them in the kingdom Protista (Bd. i. pp.\r\n  215-220; Bd. ii. p. xxix). Compare also my Protistenreich (L. N. 32) and\r\n  my Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte (vii. Aufl., 1879, p. 364). Both these\r\n  steps appear fully justified when considered in the light of our present\r\n  increased knowledge. From the _physiological_ standpoint the Radiolaria\r\n  appear as unicellular _animals_, for in this respect the animal character\r\n  of their metastasis (that proper to an oxidising organism) furnishes the\r\n  sole {cxxx}criterion. On the other hand, from the morphological\r\n  standpoint, they are to be classed as neutral Protista, for in this\r\n  respect their unicellular character is the prominent feature, and\r\n  distinguishes them from all true multicellular animals (Metazoa). Compare\r\n  my Gastræa Theorie (1873, Jena. Zeitschr. für Naturwiss., Bd. viii. pp.\r\n  29, 53).\r\n\r\n\r\n204. _Nutrition._--The nutritive materials which the Radiolaria require for\r\ntheir sustenance, especially albuminates (plasma) and carbohydrates\r\n(starch, &c.), they obtain partly from foreign organisms which they capture\r\nand digest, and partly directly from the Xanthellæ or Philozoa, the\r\nunicellular Algæ, with which they live in symbiosis (§ 205). _Zooxanthella\r\nintracapsularis_, found in the ACANTHARIA (§ 76), is probably of the same\r\nsignificance in this respect as _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_ of the\r\nSPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA (§ 90); and perhaps the same is true also of\r\n_Phæodella extracapsularis_ (or _Zoochlorella phæodaris_?) of the PHÆODARIA\r\n(§ 89). The considerable quantity of starch or amyloid bodies, elaborated\r\nby these inquiline symbiontes, as well as their protoplasm and nucleus, are\r\navailable, on their death, for the nutrition of the Radiolaria which\r\nharbour them. Nutrition by means of other particles obtained by the\r\npseudopodia from the surrounding medium is by no means excluded; indeed it\r\nmay be regarded as certain that numerous Radiolaria (especially such as\r\ncontain no symbiotic Algoid cells) are nourished for the most part or\r\nexclusively by this means. Diatoms, Infusoria, Thalamophora (Foraminifera)\r\nas well as decaying particles of animal and vegetable tissues can be seized\r\ndirectly by the pseudopodia and conveyed either to the sarcodictyum (on the\r\nsurface of the calymma) or to the sarcomatrix (on the surface of the\r\ncentral capsule) in order to undergo digestion there. The indigestible\r\nconstituents (siliceous shells of Diatoms and Tintinnoidea, calcareous\r\nshells of small Monothalamia and Polythalamia, &c.) are here collected\r\noften in large numbers and removed by the streaming of the protoplasm.\r\n\r\n  The inception and digestion of nutriment, as it usually appears to take\r\n  place by the pseudopodia, has already been so fully treated in my\r\n  Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 135-140), and since then in my paper on the\r\n  sarcode body of the Rhizopoda (L. N. 19, p. 342), that I have nothing of\r\n  importance to add. Quite recently Karl Brandt has expressed a doubt as to\r\n  whether the taking up of formed particles by the pseudopodia and their\r\n  aggregation in the calymma be really connected with the process of\r\n  nutrition. He is disposed rather to believe that these foreign bodies are\r\n  usually only accidentally and mechanically brought into the calymma, and\r\n  that the nourishment of the Radiolaria is derived exclusively or\r\n  pre-eminently from the symbiotic Xanthellæ (L. N. 52, pp. 88-93). I must,\r\n  however, maintain my former opinion, which I have only modified insomuch\r\n  that I now regard the sarcodictyum (on the outer surface of the calymma,\r\n  § 94) rather than the sarcomatrix (on the outer surface of the central\r\n  capsule, § 92) as the principal seat of true digestion and assimilation.\r\n  From the sarcodictyum the dissolved and assimilated nutritive matters may\r\n  pass by the intracalymmar pseudopodia (or sarcoplegma, § 93) into the\r\n  sarcomatrix, and hence may reach the endoplasm through the openings in\r\n  the central capsule. To what an extent the Radiolaria are capable of\r\n  taking up even large formed bodies into the calymma, is shown by the\r\n  {cxxxi}striking instance of _Thalassicolla sanguinolenta_, which becomes\r\n  so deformed by the inception of numerous coccospheres and coccoliths,\r\n  that I described it as a special genus under the name _Myxobrachia_\r\n  (compare pp. 23, 30; also L. N. 21, p. 519, Taf. xviii., and L. N. 33, p.\r\n  37).\r\n\r\n\r\n205. _Symbiosis._--Very many Radiolaria, but by no means all members of\r\nthis class, live in a definite commensal relation with yellow unicellular\r\nAlgæ of the group Xanthellæ. In the ACANTHARIA they live within the central\r\ncapsule (_Zooxanthella intracapsularis_, § 76), in the SPUMELLARIA and\r\nNASSELLARIA, on the other hand, within the calymma but outside the central\r\ncapsule (_Zooxanthella extracapsularis_, § 90); in the PHÆODARIA a special\r\nform of these symbiotic unicellular Algæ appears to inhabit the phæodium in\r\nthe extracapsulum, and to compose a considerable portion of the phæodellæ\r\n(_Zooxanthella phæodaris_, § 90, or better perhaps _Zoochlorella\r\nphæodaris_, § 89). Undoubtedly this commensal life is in very many cases of\r\nthe greatest physiological significance for both the symbiontes, for the\r\nanimal Radiolarian cells furnish the inquiline Xanthellæ not only with\r\nshelter and protection, but also with carbon dioxide and other products of\r\ndecomposition for their nutriment; whilst on the other hand the vegetable\r\ncells of the Xanthellæ yield the Radiolarian host its most important supply\r\nof nutriment, protoplasm and starch, as well as oxygen for respiration.\r\nHence it is not only theoretically possible, but has been experimentally\r\nproved, that Radiolaria which contain numerous Xanthellæ can exist without\r\nextraneous nutriment for a long period in closed vessels of filtered\r\nsea-water, kept exposed to the sunlight; the two symbiontes furnish each\r\nother mutually with nourishment, and are physiologically supplementary to\r\neach other by reason of the opposite nature of their metastasis. This\r\nsymbiosis is not necessary, however, for the existence of the Radiolaria;\r\nfor in many species the number of Xanthellæ is very variable and in many\r\nothers they are entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n  The symbiosis of the Radiolaria and Xanthellæ, or \"yellow cells\" (§§ 76,\r\n  90) was first discovered by Cienkowski in 1871 (L. N. 22). Ten years\r\n  later this important and often doubted fact was established by extended\r\n  observations and experiments almost simultaneously by Karl Brandt (L. N.\r\n  38, 39) and Patrick Geddes (L. N. 42, 43). This commensal life may be\r\n  compared with that of the lichens, in which an organism with vegetable\r\n  metastasis (the Algoid gonidia) and an organism with animal metastasis\r\n  (the Fungoid hyphæ) are intimately united for mutual benefit. But the\r\n  symbiosis of the Xanthellæ and Radiolaria is not as in the lichens a\r\n  phenomenon essential for their development, but has more or less the\r\n  character of an accidental association. The number of the inquiline\r\n  Xanthellæ is so variable even in one and the same species of Radiolaria,\r\n  that they do not appear to be exactly essential to its welfare; and in\r\n  many species they are entirely wanting. Their significance is\r\n  questionable in the case of those numerous deep-sea Radiolaria which live\r\n  in complete darkness, and in which, therefore, the Xanthellæ, even if\r\n  present, could excrete no oxygen on account of the want of light.\r\n  Nevertheless it is possible that the phæodellæ of the PHÆODARIA (usually\r\n  green, olive, or brown in colour), which are true cells, represent\r\n  vegetable symbiontes, {cxxxii}which in the absence of sunlight are able\r\n  to evolve oxygen by the aid of the phosphoresence of other abyssal\r\n  animals. Since the PHÆODARIA are, for the most part, dwellers in the\r\n  deep-sea, and since the voluminous phæodium must be of great\r\n  physiological importance, a positive solution of this hypothetical\r\n  question would be of no small interest (compare § 89).\r\n\r\n\r\n206. _Respiration._--The respiration of the Radiolaria is animal in nature,\r\nsince all Protista of this class, like all other true Rhizopoda, take in\r\noxygen and give off carbon dioxide. Probably this process goes on\r\ncontinuously and is tolerably active, as may be inferred from the fact that\r\nRadiolaria cannot be kept for long in small vessels of sea-water unless\r\neither they contain numerous Xanthellæ or the water is well aërated. The\r\noxygen is obtained from two sources, either from the surrounding water or\r\nfrom the enclosed Xanthellæ, which in sunlight evolve considerable\r\nquantities of this gas. Correspondingly, the carbon dioxide which is formed\r\nduring the process of oxidation of the Radiolaria is either given up to the\r\nsurrounding water or to the inquiline Xanthellæ, which utilise it for their\r\nown sustenance (§§ 204, 205).\r\n\r\n  The significance of the symbiotic Xanthellæ for the respiration of the\r\n  enclosing Radiolaria may be shown experimentally in the following way. If\r\n  two Polycyttarian colonies of equal size, both of which contain numerous\r\n  Xanthellæ, be placed in equal quantities of filtered sea-water in sealed\r\n  glass tubes, and if one tube be placed in the dark the other in the\r\n  light, the colony in the former rapidly perishes, but not that in the\r\n  latter; the Xanthellæ excrete only under the influence of sunlight the\r\n  oxygen necessary for the life of the Radiolarian (compare Patrick Geddes,\r\n  L. N. 42, p. 304).\r\n\r\n\r\n207. _Circulation._--In the protoplasm of all Radiolaria, both inside and\r\noutside the central capsule, slow currents may be recognised which fall\r\nunder the general term circulation, and have already been compared to the\r\ncyclosis in the interior of animal and vegetable cells, as well as to the\r\nsarcode streams in the body of other Rhizopoda. These plasmatic currents or\r\n\"plasmorrheumata\" probably continue throughout the whole life of the\r\nRadiolaria, and are of fundamental importance for the performance of their\r\nvital functions. They depend upon slow displacements of the molecules of\r\nthe plasma (plastidules or micellæ) and cause a uniform distribution of the\r\nabsorbed nutriment and a certain equalisation of the metastasis.\r\nFurthermore they are of great importance also in the inception of\r\nnutriment, the formation of the skeleton, locomotion, &c. Sometimes the\r\ncirculation is directly perceptible in the plasma itself; but usually it is\r\nonly visible owing to the presence of granules (sarcogranula), which are\r\nsuspended in the plasma in larger or smaller numbers. The movements of\r\nthese granules are usually regarded as passive, due to the active\r\ndisplacement of the molecules of the plasma. Although the intracapsular\r\nprotoplasm is in communication with the extracapsular through the openings\r\nin the capsule membrane, nevertheless the currents exhibit certain\r\ndifferences {cxxxiii}in the two portions of the malacoma. It is sometimes\r\npossible, however, to recognise the direct connection between them and to\r\nobserve how the granules pass through the openings in the capsule-membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n208. _Currents in the Endoplasm._--Intracapsular circulation or a certain\r\nslow flowing of the plasma within the central capsule is probably just as\r\ncommon in the Radiolaria as without it, but it is not so easy to observe in\r\nthe former case as in the latter. A more satisfactory proof of these\r\nendoplasmatic currents is furnished by the arrangement of the protoplasm\r\nwithin the central capsule, since this is (at all events in part) an effect\r\nproduced by them. In this respect the two main divisions of the class show\r\ncharacteristic differences. In the Porulosa (the SPUMELLARIA, § 77, and the\r\nACANTHARIA, § 78) the endoplasm is in general distinguished by a more or\r\nless distinct radial structure, which is to be regarded as the effect of\r\nalternating centripetal and centrifugal radial streams. In the Osculosa, on\r\nthe other hand, this radial structure is absent and the intracapsular\r\nplasmatic streams converge or diverge towards the osculum or main-opening\r\nin the central capsule which lies at the basal pole of its main axis, and\r\nthrough which the mass of the endoplasm issues into the calymma. The two\r\nlegions of the Osculosa, however, present differences in this respect. In\r\nthe NASSELLARIA (§ 79) the endoplasmatic currents appear to unite in an\r\naxial main stream at the apex of the monaxon central capsule, and this\r\napical stream seems to split into a conical bundle, the individual threads\r\nof which pass diverging between the myophane fibrillæ of the podoconus\r\ntowards the basis of the central capsule, and issue through the pores of\r\nthe porochora. In the PHÆODARIA (§ 80), on the other hand, meridional\r\ncurrents of endoplasm are probably present on the inner surface of the\r\ncapsule, which flow from the aboral pole of the vertical main axis to its\r\nbasal pole, and return in the reverse direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n209. _Currents in the Exoplasm._--Extracapsular circulation, or a distinct\r\nflowing of the plasma outside the central capsule, may be readily observed\r\nin all Radiolaria which are examined alive; this is most readily seen in\r\nthe astropodia, or those free pseudopodia which radiate from the\r\nsarcodictyum on the surface of the calymma into the surrounding water. The\r\ngranular movement is often quite as clear in the sarcodictyum itself, and\r\nmay be recognised in the collopodia, which compose the irregular plasmatic\r\nnetwork within the calymma. More rarely it is possible to follow the\r\ngranular stream thence through the sarcomatrix, and further into the\r\ninterior of the central capsule. In general the direction of the\r\nextracapsular protoplasmic streams is radial, and it is frequently\r\npossible, even in a single free astropodium, to observe two streams\r\nopposite in direction, the granules on one side of the radial sarcode\r\nthread moving centripetally, those on the other side centrifugally. If the\r\nthreads branch, and neighbouring ones {cxxxiv}become united by connecting\r\nthreads, the circulation of the granules may proceed quite irregularly in\r\nthe network thus formed. The rapidity and character of the extracapsular\r\ncurrents are subject to great variations.\r\n\r\n  The different forms of extracapsular sarcode currents have been already\r\n  very fully described in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 89-126), and in my\r\n  critical essay on the sarcode body of the Rhizopoda (L. N. 19, p. 357,\r\n  Taf. XXVI.).\r\n\r\n\r\n210. _Secretion._--Under the name _secretions_, in the strict sense, all\r\nthe skeletal formations of the Radiolaria may be included. They may be\r\ndivided according to their chemical composition into three different\r\ngroups: pure silica in the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, a silicate of\r\ncarbon in the PHÆODARIA, and acanthin in the ACANTHARIA (compare § 102). It\r\nmay indeed be assumed that these skeletons arise directly by a chemical\r\nmetamorphosis (silicification, acanthinosis, &c.) of the pseudopodia and\r\nprotoplasmic network; and this view seems especially justified in the case\r\nof the Astroid skeleton of the ACANTHARIA (§ 114), the Spongoid skeleton of\r\nthe SPUMELLARIA (§ 126), the Plectoid skeleton of the NASSELLARIA (§ 125),\r\nthe Cannoid skeleton of the PHÆODARIA (§ 127), and several other types. On\r\ncloser investigation, however, it appears yet more probable that the\r\nskeleton does not arise by direct chemical metamorphosis of the protoplasm,\r\nbut by secretion from it; for when the dissolved skeletal material (silica,\r\nacanthin) passes from the fluid into the solid state, it does not appear as\r\nimbedded in the plasma, but as deposited from it. However, it must be borne\r\nin mind that a hard line of demarcation can scarcely, if at all, be drawn\r\nbetween these two processes. In the ACANTHARIA the intracapsular sarcode is\r\nthe original organ of secretion of the skeleton; in the other three\r\nlegions, on the other hand, the extracapsulum performs this function (§§\r\n106, 107). In addition to the skeleton, we may regard as secretions (or\r\nexcretions) the intracapsular crystals (§ 75) and concretions (§ 75A), and\r\nperhaps certain pigment-bodies (§§ 74, 88); and further, the calymma (§ 82)\r\nmay be considered to be a gelatinous secretion of the central capsule, and\r\nperhaps also the capsule-membrane, in so far as it represents only a\r\nsecondary excretory product of the unicellular organism.\r\n\r\n\r\n211. _Adaptation._--The innumerable and very various adaptive phenomena\r\nwhich we meet with in the morphology of the Radiolaria, and especially in\r\nthat of their skeleton, are like other phenomena of the same kind, to be\r\nultimately referred to altered nutritional relations. These may be caused\r\ndirectly either by the influence of external conditions of existence\r\n(nutrition, light, temperature, &c.), or by the proper activity of the\r\nunicellular organism (use or disuse of its organs, &c.), or, finally, by\r\nthe combined action of both causes in the struggle for existence. In very\r\nmany cases the cause to which the origin of a particular form of Radiolaria\r\nis due may be directly perceived or at least guessed at with considerable\r\nprobability; thus, for example, the lattice-shells {cxxxv}may be explained\r\nas protective coverings, the radial spines as defensive weapons, and the\r\nanchor-hooks and spathillæ as organs of prehension, which are of advantage\r\nto their possessors in the struggle for existence; the regular arrangement\r\nof the radial spines in the Radiolaria may also be explained on hydrostatic\r\ngrounds, it being advantageous that the body should be maintained in a\r\ndefinite position of equilibrium, &c. The well-known laws of _direct_ or\r\n_actual adaptation_, which we designate cumulative, correlative, divergent\r\nadaptation, &c., here explain a multitude of morphological phenomena. The\r\nconnection is less distinct in the case of the laws of _indirect_ or\r\n_potential adaptation_, although this must play as important a part in the\r\nformation of the Radiolaria as in that of other organisms (compare on this\r\nhead my Generelle Morphologie, Bd. ii. pp. 202-222).\r\n\r\n\r\n212. _Reproduction._--The most common form of reproduction in the\r\nRadiolaria is the formation of spores in the central capsule, which in this\r\nrespect is to be regarded as a sporangium (§ 215). In many Radiolaria\r\n(Polycyttaria and PHÆODARIA), however, there occurs in addition an increase\r\nof the unicellular organism by simple division (§ 213); upon this the\r\nformation of colonies in the social Radiolaria is dependent (§ 14).\r\nReproduction by gemmation is much less common, and has hitherto been\r\nobserved only in the Polycyttaria (§ 214). In this group alone there also\r\noccur at certain times two different forms of swarm-spores which copulate,\r\nand thus indicate the commencement of sexual reproduction (Alternation of\r\nGenerations, § 216). The general organ of reproduction is in all cases the\r\ncentral capsule, whilst the extracapsulum never takes an active part in the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n213. _Cell-Division._--Increase by cell-division among the Radiolaria in\r\nthe early stage, before the formation of the skeleton, is widely\r\ndistributed (perhaps even general?); in the adults of this class it is\r\nrather rare and limited to certain groups. It is most readily observed in\r\nthe Polycyttaria; the growth of the colonies in this social group depends\r\nmainly (and in many species exclusively) upon repeated spontaneous division\r\nof the central capsule; all the individuals of each colony (in so far as\r\nthis has not arisen by the accidental fusion of two or more colonies) are\r\ndescendants of a single central capsule, which has arisen from an asexual\r\nswarm-spore (§ 215) or from the copulation of two sexual swarm-spores (§\r\n216). Whilst the central capsules of the colonies continually increase by\r\ndivision, their calymma remains a common gelatinous sheath. Among the\r\nSPUMELLARIA reproduction by simple cell-division probably occurs also in\r\nmany monozootic #Collodaria#. Among the ACANTHARIA the peculiar group\r\nLitholophida has perhaps arisen by the spontaneous division of\r\n#Acanthonida# (see p. 734). Among the PHÆODARIA increase by cell-division\r\nseems to occur commonly in many groups, as in the #Phæocystina#, which have\r\nno skeleton (Phæodinida, Pl. 101, {cxxxvi}fig. 2), or only an incomplete\r\nBeloid skeleton (Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101, figs. 3, 6, and Aulacanthida, Pl.\r\n104, figs. 1-3). The #Phæosphæria# also (Aulosphærida, Coelacanthida) and\r\nthe #Phæogromia# (Tuscarorida, Challengerida) appear sometimes to divide;\r\nat all events, their central capsule often contains two nuclei. Of special\r\ninterest  is the spontaneous division of the #Phæoconchia#, especially the\r\nConcharida (Pl. 124, fig. 6). In all monozootic Radiolaria, the nucleus\r\nfirst divides by a median constriction into two equal halves (usually by\r\nthe mode of direct division); then the central capsule becomes constricted\r\nin the middle (in the PHÆODARIA in the vertical main axis), and each\r\nportion of the capsule retains its own nucleus. In the #Phæoconchia# each\r\nhalf or daughter-cell corresponds to one valve of the shell, dorsal or\r\nventral, so that probably on subsequent separation each daughter-cell\r\nretains one valve of the mother-cell, and forms a new one for itself by\r\nregeneration (as in the Diatoms). In the polyzootic Radiolaria, which\r\nalready contain many small nuclei, but usually only a single central\r\noil-globule in each central capsule, the division of the latter is preceded\r\nby that of the oil-globule. In many Polycyttaria the colony as a whole\r\nmultiplies by division.\r\n\r\n  The increase of the central capsule by division was first described in\r\n  1862 in my Monograph (L. N. 16, p. 146); since then R. Hertwig (L. N. 26,\r\n  p. 24) and K. Brandt (L. N. 52, p. 144) have confirmed my statement. In\r\n  the PHÆODARIA the division of the central capsule appears always to take\r\n  place in the main axis; in the bilateral sometimes in the sagittal,\r\n  sometimes in the frontal plane. In the Tripylea each daughter-cell seems\r\n  to retain one parapyle and half the astropyle (compare the general\r\n  description of the PHÆODARIA, Pl. 101, figs. 1-6, Pl. 104, figs. 1-3, and\r\n  also Hertwig, L. N. 33, p. 100, Taf. x. figs. 2, 11). Regarding the\r\n  spontaneous division of colonies of the Polycyttaria, see K. Brandt, L.\r\n  N. 52, p. 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n214. _Cell-Gemmation._--Reproduction by gemmation has hitherto been\r\nobserved only in the social Radiolaria, but in them it appears to be widely\r\ndistributed, and in very young colonies is perhaps almost universally\r\npresent. The gemmules or capsular buds (hitherto described as\r\n\"extracapsular bodies\") are developed on the surface of young central\r\ncapsules before these had secreted a membrane. They grow usually in\r\nconsiderable numbers, from the surface of the central capsule, which is\r\nsometimes quite covered with them. Each bud usually contains a\r\nraspberry-like bunch of shining fatty globules, and by means of reagents a\r\nfew larger or a considerable number of smaller nuclei may be recognised in\r\nthem; the naked protoplasmic body of the bud is not enclosed by any\r\nmembrane. As soon as the buds have reached a certain size they are\r\nconstricted off from the central capsule and separated from it, being\r\ndistributed in the meshes of the sarcoplegma by the currents in the\r\nexoplasm. Afterwards each bud becomes developed into a complete central\r\ncapsule by surrounding itself with a membrane when it has attained a\r\ndefinite size. From the special relations of the process of nuclear\r\nformation, which take place in the multiplication of the {cxxxvii}social\r\ncentral capsules by gemmation and by cell-division, it would appear that\r\nthe capsules produced by the former method afterwards produce anisospores,\r\nwhilst those in the latter way yield isospores (§ 216).\r\n\r\n  The gemmules or capsular buds of the Polycyttaria were first accurately\r\n  described by Richard Hertwig (L. N. 26, pp. 37-39), under the name\r\n  \"extracapsular bodies,\" and their significance rightly indicated; earlier\r\n  observers had incidentally mentioned and figured them, but had not seen\r\n  their origin from the central capsule. Quite recently Karl Brandt has\r\n  given a very painstaking account of them in the different Polycyttarian\r\n  genera (L. N. 52, pp. 179-198). In the Monocyttaria such a formation of\r\n  buds has not yet been observed. The basal lobes of the central capsule,\r\n  which occur in many NASSELLARIA, are not buds, but simple processes of\r\n  the capsule, due to its protrusion through the collar pores of the\r\n  cortinar septum (§ 55).\r\n\r\n\r\n215. _Sporification._--Asexual reproduction by the formation of movable\r\nflagellate spores has been hitherto observed only in a very small number of\r\ngenera; but since these belong to very different groups, and since the\r\ncomparative morphology of the capsule appears to be similar throughout as\r\nregards the structure and development of its contents, it may be safely\r\nassumed that this kind of reproduction occurs quite generally in the\r\nRadiolaria. In all cases it is the contents of the central capsule, from\r\nwhich the swarm-spores are formed, both nucleus and endoplasm taking an\r\nequal share in the process; in all cases the spores produced are very\r\nnumerous, small, ovoid or reniform, and have one or two very long slender\r\nflagella at one extremity (see §§ 141, 142). Since the whole contents of\r\nthe mature central capsule are used up in the formation of these flagellate\r\nzoospores, it discharges the function of a sporangium. The division of the\r\nsimple primary nucleus into numerous small nuclei, which usually\r\n(serotinous Radiolaria) takes place only shortly before sporification, but\r\nsometimes (precocious Radiolaria, § 63) happens very early, is the\r\ncommencement of the often repeated process of nuclear division, which\r\nterminates with the production of a very large number of small\r\nspore-nuclei. The nucleolus often divides very peculiarly (§ 69, C). Each\r\nspore nucleus becomes surrounded by a portion of endoplasm and usually\r\nreceives in addition one or more fatty granules, and sometimes also a small\r\ncrystal (hence the \"crystal-spores\"). The size of the flagellate zoospores\r\nwhich emerge from the ruptured central capsule and swim freely in the water\r\nby means of their flagellum, varies generally between 0.004 and 0.008 mm.\r\nThe extracapsulum is not directly concerned in the sporification, but\r\nundergoes degeneration during the process and perishes at its conclusion.\r\n\r\n  The first complete and detailed observations on the formation of spores\r\n  in the Radiolaria were published by Cienkowski in 1871 and related to two\r\n  genera of Polycyttaria, the skeletonless _Collozoum_ and the\r\n  spherical-shelled _Collosphæra_ (L. N. 22, p. 372, Taf. xxix.). These\r\n  were subsequently continued and supplemented by R. Hertwig (1876, L. N.\r\n  26, pp. 26-42, and L. N. 33, p. 129), and a general summary of these\r\n  results has been given by Bütschli (L. N. 41, pp. 449-455).\r\n  {cxxxviii}Recently Karl Brandt has given a very detailed and fully\r\n  illustrated account of the sporification of the Polycyttaria (L. N. 52,\r\n  pp. 145-178). I have also had the opportunity during my sojourn in the\r\n  Canary Islands (1866), in the Mediterranean at Corfu (1877), and\r\n  Portofino (1880), as well as in Ceylon (1881), of observing the\r\n  development of flagellate zoospores from the central capsule of\r\n  individuals of all four legions: among the SPUMELLARIA in certain\r\n  #Colloidea#, #Beloidea#, #Sphæroidea#, and #Discoidea#, among the\r\n  ACANTHARIA in several #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta#, among the\r\n  NASSELLARIA in individuals belonging to the #Stephoidea#, #Plectoidea#,\r\n  and #Cyrtoidea#, and among the PHÆODARIA in one Castanellid. In most\r\n  zoospores I could distinctly observe only a single long flagellum;\r\n  sometimes, however, two or even three appeared to be present, but the\r\n  determination of their number is very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n216. _Alternation of Generations._--A peculiar form of reproduction, which\r\nmay be designated \"alternation of generations,\" appears to occur generally\r\nin the Polycyttaria, but has not yet been observed in the Monocyttaria. All\r\n#Collozoida#, #Sphærozoida#, and Collosphærida which have hitherto been\r\ncarefully and completely examined with respect to their development, are\r\ndistinguished by the production of two different kinds of swarm-spores,\r\nisospores and anisospores. The _Isospores_ (or monogonous spores)\r\ncorrespond to the ordinary asexual zoospores of the Monocyttaria (§ 215);\r\nthey possess a homogeneous, doubly refracting nucleus of uniform\r\nconstitution and develop asexually, without copulation. The _Anisospores_\r\n(or amphigonous spores), on the other hand, are sexually differentiated and\r\npossess a heterogeneous, singly refracting nucleus of twofold constitution;\r\nthey may therefore be distinguished as female macrospores and male\r\nmicrospores. The _Macrospores_ (or gynospores, comparable with the female\r\nmacrogonidia of many Cryptogams) are larger, less numerous, and possess\r\nlarger nuclei, which are less easily stained, and have a fine filiform\r\ntrabecular network. On the other hand the _Microspores_ (or _androspores_,\r\ncomparable with the male microgonidia) are much smaller and more numerous,\r\nand are distinguished by their smaller nuclei, which have thicker tuberculæ\r\nand become stained more intensely. The gynospores and androspores are\r\ndeveloped in the #Collozoida# and #Sphærozoida# in the same individual, but\r\nnot in the Collosphærida. It is very probable that these two forms of\r\nanisospores copulate with each other after their exit from the central\r\ncapsule and thus produce a new cell by the simplest mode of sexual\r\nreproduction. But, since the same Polycyttaria, which produce these\r\nanisospores, at other times give rise to ordinary or asexual isospores, it\r\nis further possible that these two forms of reproduction alternate with\r\neach other, and that the Polycyttaria thus pass through a true alternation\r\nof generations. This has not yet been observed in the Monocyttaria, and\r\nhence these latter seem to bear to the Polycyttaria a relation similar to\r\nthat in which the sexless solitary Flagellata (Astasiea) stand to the\r\nsexual social Flagellata (Volvocinea). In the two analogous cases the\r\nsexual differentiation may be regarded as a consequence of the social life\r\nin the gelatinous colonies.\r\n\r\n  {cxxxix}The _sexual differentiation of the Polycyttaria_ was first\r\n  discovered in 1875 by R. Hertwig, and accurately described in the case of\r\n  _Collozoum inerme_ as occurring in addition to the formation of the\r\n  ordinary crystal-spores (L. N. 26, p. 36); compare also the general\r\n  discussion of Bütschli (L. N. 41, p. 52). Recently Karl Brandt has\r\n  demonstrated the formation of both homogeneous isospores (crystal-spores)\r\n  and heterogeneous anisospores (macro- and microspores) in seven different\r\n  species of Polycyttaria, and has come to the conclusion that in all\r\n  social Radiolaria there is a regular alternation between the former and\r\n  latter generations. Compare his elaborate account of the colonial\r\n  Radiolaria of the Gulf of Naples (L. N. 52, pp. 145-178).\r\n\r\n\r\n217. _Inheritance._--Inheritance is to be regarded as the most important\r\naccompaniment to the function of reproduction, and especially in the\r\npresent case, because the comparative morphology of the Radiolaria\r\nfurnishes abundant instances of the action of its different laws. The laws\r\nof _conservative inheritance_ are illustrated by the comparative anatomy of\r\nthe larger groups; thus, in the four legions the characteristic\r\npeculiarities of the central capsule are maintained unaltered in\r\nconsequence of continuous inheritance, although great varieties appear in\r\nthe skeleton in each legion. The individual parts of the skeleton furnish\r\nby their development on the one hand and their degeneration on the other,\r\nespecially in the smaller groups, examples of _progressive inheritance_.\r\nThus in the SPUMELLARIA the constant formation of the primary lattice-shell\r\n(a central medullary shell) and its ontogenetic relation to the secondary\r\none, which is developed concentrically round it, can only be explained\r\nphylogenetically by conservative inheritance, whilst on the other hand the\r\ncharacteristic differentiation of the axes in the various families of\r\nSPUMELLARIA is to be explained by progressive inheritance. In the\r\nACANTHARIA the arrangement of the twenty radial spines (in accordance with\r\nMüller's law, §§ 110, 172) was first acquired by a group of the most\r\narchaic #Actinelida# (Adelacantha) through hydrostatic adaptation, and has\r\nsince been transmitted by inheritance to all the other families of the\r\nlegion (Icosacantha). The morphology of the NASSELLARIA is not less\r\ninteresting, because here several different heritable elements (the primary\r\nsagittal ring and the basal tripod) combine in the most manifold ways in\r\nthe formation of the skeleton (compare §§ 123, 124, 182). The affinities of\r\nthe genera in the different families yield an astonishing variety of\r\ninteresting morphological phenomena, which can only be explained by\r\nprogressive inheritance. The same is true also of the PHÆODARIA. In this\r\nlegion the primary inheritance is especially manifested in the constant and\r\nfirm structure of the central capsule with its characteristic double wall\r\nand astropyle, whilst the formation of the skeleton in this legion proceeds\r\nin different directions by means of divergent adaptation. The morphology of\r\nthe Radiolaria thus proves itself a rich source of materials for the\r\nphysiological study of adaptation and inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxl}CHAPTER VIII.--ANIMAL FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\n(§§ 218-225.)\r\n\r\n218. _Motion._--In addition to the internal movements which appear\r\ngenerally in the unicellular Radiolaria and have already been mentioned as\r\nplasmatic currents in treating of the circulation (§§ 207-209), two\r\ndifferent groups of external motor phenomena are to be observed in this\r\nclass: first, the _contraction_ of individual parts, which brings about\r\nmodifications of form (§ 220), and secondly, voluntary or reflex\r\n_locomotion_ of the whole body (§ 220). These movements are partly due to\r\nchanges in form of undifferentiated plasmatic threads or sarcode filaments,\r\npartly to the actual contraction of differentiated filaments which are\r\ncomparable to muscle fibrillæ, and must therefore be distinguished as\r\nmyophanes. In addition to this, endosmose and exosmose probably play an\r\nimportant part in some of the locomotive phenomena, but nothing is yet\r\ncertainly known regarding these osmotic processes. We are at present\r\nequally ignorant whether all the movements of the Radiolaria are simply\r\nreflex (direct consequences of irritation) or whether they are in part\r\ntruly spontaneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n219. _Suspension._--From direct observation of living Radiolaria, as well\r\nas from deductive reasoning, based upon their morphology (and especially\r\ntheir promorphology, §§ 17-50), the conclusion appears justified that all\r\nProtista of this class in their normal condition float suspended in the\r\nsea-water, either at the surface or at a definite depth. A necessary\r\ncondition of this hydrostatic suspension is that the specific gravity of\r\nthe Radiolarian organism must be equal to, or but slightly greater than\r\nthat of sea-water. The increase in specific gravity brought about by the\r\nproduction of the siliceous skeleton, is compensated by the lighter fatty\r\nglobules, and partly perhaps by the calymma, especially when the latter\r\ncontains vacuoles or alveoles. The fluid or jelly contained in the latter\r\nappears to be for the most part lighter than sea-water (containing no salt,\r\nor only a very small quantity?). But if the specific gravity of the whole\r\nbody should be generally (or perhaps always) slightly greater than that of\r\nsea-water, then the organism would be prevented from sinking, partly by the\r\nincreased friction, due to the radiating pseudopodia and the radial spines\r\nusually present, and partly perhaps by active (if only feeble) movements of\r\nthe pseudopodia.\r\n\r\n\r\n220. _Locomotion._--Active locomotion of the whole body, which is very\r\nprobably to be regarded as voluntary, occurs in the Radiolaria in three\r\ndifferent modes; (1) the vibratile movement of the flagellate swarm-spores;\r\n(2) the swimming of the floating organisms; (3) the slow creeping of those\r\nwhich rest accidentally upon the bottom. {cxli}The _vibratile_ movement of\r\nthe swarm-spores is the result of active sinuous oscillation of the single\r\nor multiple flagellum, and is not essentially different from that of\r\nordinary flagellate Infusoria (see note A). Of the active swimming of\r\nmature Radiolaria, only that form is known which is vertical in direction\r\nand causes the sinking and rising in the sea-water. This is probably, for\r\nthe most part (perhaps exclusively), due to increase or diminution in the\r\nspecific gravity, which is perhaps brought about by the retraction or\r\nprotrusion of the pseudopodia; slow, oscillating, sinuous motions of these\r\norgans have been directly observed to take place (though very slowly) in\r\nsuspended living Radiolaria. The most important hydrostatic organ is\r\nprobably the calymma, by the contraction of which the specific gravity is\r\nincreased, while it is diminished by its expansion; the contraction is\r\nprobably brought about by active contraction of the sarcodictyum, and is\r\nconnected with exosmosis, while the expansion is probably due to the\r\nelasticity of the calymma and the inception of water by endosmosis. In the\r\n#Acanthometra# (§ 96) the peculiar myophriscs appear to be charged with the\r\nduty of distending the gelatinous envelope, and thus diminishing the\r\nspecific gravity; the latter increases again when the myophriscs are\r\nrelaxed, and the calymma contracts by virtue of its own elasticity (see\r\nnote B). The slow _creeping locomotion_ exhibited by Radiolaria on a glass\r\nslide under the microscope, does not differ from that of the Thalamophora\r\n(Monothalamia and Polythalamia), but can only occur normally when the\r\nanimal accidentally comes into contact with a solid surface or sinks to the\r\nbottom of the sea. Whether this actually occurs periodically is not known\r\n(see note C). The slow or gliding locomotion exhibited by creeping Monozoa\r\non a glass slide is due to muscle-like contractions of bundles of\r\npseudopodia, just as in the case of the social central capsules of Polyzoa,\r\nwhich live together in the same coenobium and are able to move within their\r\ncommon calymma sometimes centrifugally to its surface, sometimes towards\r\nthe centre where they aggregate into a roundish mass (see note D).\r\n\r\n  A. Regarding the movement of the flagella in mature swarm-spores compare\r\n  L. N. 22, p. 375; L. N. 26, pp. 31, 35; L. N. 41, p. 452, and L. N. 52,\r\n  p. 170.\r\n\r\n  B. On the active vertical swimming movements of mature Radiolaria,\r\n  especially the cause of sinking and rising, see L. N. 16, p. 134; L. N.\r\n  41, p. 443, and L. N. 52, pp. 97-102.\r\n\r\n  C. On the active horizontal creeping movements of mature Radiolaria on a\r\n  firm ground, compare L. N. 12, p. 10, and L. N. 16, pp. 132-134.\r\n\r\n  D. Regarding the motion of social central capsules within the same\r\n  coenobium and the changes thus brought about in the structure of the\r\n  calymma, see L. N. 16, pp. 119-127, and L. N. 52, pp. 75-82.\r\n\r\n\r\n221. _Contraction._--Motions, which are due to the contraction of\r\nindividual portions and cause changes in volume or form, have been partly\r\nalready spoken of under the head of locomotion (§ 220) and are partly\r\nconnected with other functions. Examples may be seen in the contraction of\r\nthe central capsule and of the calymma. A certain {cxlii}contraction of the\r\ncentral capsule is probably brought about by the myophanes, which arise by\r\ndifferentiation of the endoplasm and hence may assume different forms in\r\nthe four legions. In the SPUMELLARIA, where numerous radial fibrillæ run\r\nfrom the central nucleus to the capsule membrane (§ 77), the endoplasm is\r\nprobably driven out evenly through all the pores of the capsule membrane by\r\ntheir simultaneous contraction, and hence the volume of the capsule is\r\ndiminished in all directions.  The ACANTHARIA probably behave similarly,\r\nbut are different, inasmuch as the number of their contractile radial\r\nfibrillæ is less, and special axial threads (§ 78) are already\r\ndifferentiated. In the NASSELLARIA it is probable that owing to the\r\ncontraction of the divergent myophane fibrillæ in the podoconus the\r\nvertical axis of the latter is shortened, the opercular rods of the\r\nporochora are lifted, and the endoplasm driven out of its pores, so that\r\nthe volume of the monaxon central capsule is diminished (§ 79). In the\r\nPHÆODARIA the same result is probably brought about by the contraction of\r\nthe cortical myophane fibrillæ, which run meridionally along the inside of\r\nthe capsule membrane from the apical to the basal pole of the vertical main\r\naxis, where they are inserted into the periphery of the astropyle; since\r\nthe volume of the capsule is diminished by their contraction (their\r\nspheroidal figure becoming more nearly spherical) the endoplasm will be\r\ndriven out through the proboscis of the astropyle. Whilst these\r\ncontractions of the central capsule are largely due to differentiated\r\nmuscle-like threads of endoplasm (myophanes), this appears to be but rarely\r\nthe case with the contractions of the extracapsulum (_e.g._, the myophriscs\r\nof the #Acanthometra#, § 96). Most of the phenomena of contraction which\r\ncan be observed in the calymma and pseudopodia depend upon exoplasmatic\r\ncurrents (§ 209).\r\n\r\n\r\n222. _Protection._--Of the utmost importance, both for the physiology and\r\nfor the morphology of the Radiolaria are their manifold protective\r\nfunctions, which we now consider under the heading \"protection.\" From the\r\nphysiological point of view the consideration of the exposed situation in\r\nwhich the delicate, free-swimming Radiolarian organism lives, and the\r\nnumerous dangers which beset it in the struggle for existence, would lead\r\n_a priori_ to the expectation, that many special protective adaptations\r\nwould be developed by natural selection. On the other hand, morphological\r\nexperience shows us that this latter has been in action for immeasurable\r\nperiods, and has gradually produced an abundance of the most remarkable\r\nprotective modifications. Examples of these may be found in the formation\r\nof the voluminous calymma, as a gelatinous protective covering for the\r\ncentral capsule, and further, the formation of the capsule membrane itself,\r\nwhich separates the generative contents of the central capsule from the\r\nnutritive exoplasm. The phosphorescence of the central capsule, too (§\r\n223), may be regarded as a useful protective arrangement; as also the\r\nradiating of the numerous pseudopodia in all directions from the surface of\r\nthe calymma; for they are of great significance to the {cxliii}well-being\r\nof the organism, both as sensory organs and as prehensile organs. By far\r\nthe most important and most varied means for the actual defence of the soft\r\nbody is to be seen in the endless modifications of the skeleton; first, in\r\nthe production of the enclosing lattice-shells and projecting radial\r\nspines, but especially also in the very varied structure of the individual\r\nparts of the skeleton, and in the special differentiation of the small\r\nappendicular organs which grow out from it (hairs, thorns, spines, scales,\r\nspathillæ, anchors, &c.). Finally \"mimicry\" possesses a considerable\r\nsignificance among the different forms of adaptation which are to be\r\nobserved in this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n223. _Phosphorescence._--Many Radiolarians shine in the dark, and their\r\nphosphorescence presents the same phenomena as that of other luminous\r\nmarine organisms; it is increased by mechanical and chemical irritation, or\r\nrenewed if already extinguished. The light is sometimes greenish, sometimes\r\nyellowish, and appears generally (if not always) to radiate from the\r\nintracapsular fatty spheres (§ 73). Thus these latter unite several\r\nfunctions, inasmuch as they serve, firstly, as reserve stores of nutriment,\r\nsecondly, as hydrostatic apparatus, and thirdly, as luminous organs for the\r\nprotection of the Radiolaria; probably the light acts by frightening other\r\nanimals, for the phosphorescent animals are provided with spines,\r\nnettle-cells, poison glands or other defensive weapons. The production of\r\nthe light depends probably, as in other phosphorescent organisms, upon the\r\nslow oxidation of the fat-globules, which combine with active oxygen in the\r\npresence of alkalis. Phosphorescence is very likely widely distributed\r\namong the Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n  The shining of the Radiolaria in the dark has been noticed by the\r\n  earliest observers of the class (see L. N. 1, p. 163, L. N. 16, p. 2, and\r\n  L. N. 52, pp. 136-139). In the winter of 1859 I observed the production\r\n  of light in the case of many monozootic and polyzootic Radiolaria, but\r\n  inadvertently omitted to record the fact in my Monograph. I made more\r\n  accurate observations in the winter of 1866 at Lanzerote in the Canary\r\n  Islands, and convinced myself the the light emanates from the central\r\n  capsule, and in particular from the fat-globules contained in it. In most\r\n  Polycyttaria (both #Collosphærida# and #Sphærozoida#), when each central\r\n  capsule contains a large central oil-globule the light radiates from it.\r\n  In _Collozoum serpentinum_ (Pl. 3, figs. 2, 3) each cylindrical central\r\n  capsule contains a row of luminous spherules like a string of beads. In\r\n  _Alacorys friderici_ (Pl. 65, fig. 1) the four-lobed central capsule\r\n  contains four shining points. Karl Brandt has recently made more detailed\r\n  communication on this point (L. N. 52, p. 137).\r\n\r\n\r\n224. _Sensation._--The general irritability which we ascribe to all\r\norganisms, and as the basis of which we regard the protoplasm, remains at\r\nan inferior stage of development in the Radiolaria. For although they are\r\nsubject to various stimuli, and certainly possess a power of\r\ndiscrimination, special sensory organs are not differentiated; the\r\nperipheral portions of the protoplasm, and especially the pseudopodia,\r\nrather act both as organs of the different kinds of sensation and various\r\nmodes of motion. That different Radiolaria have attained different degrees\r\nof development in this respect may be seen {cxliv}partly by direct\r\nobservation of the reaction of the living organism towards various stimuli,\r\nand partly by the comparison of the different conditions of existence under\r\nwhich Radiolarians exist, both in the most various depths of the ocean and\r\nin all climatic zones (see note A). In general the Radiolaria seem to be\r\nsensitive to the following stimuli; (1) pressure (see note B); (2)\r\ntemperature (see note C); (3) light (see note D); (4) chemical composition\r\nof the sea-water (see note E). The reaction towards these stimuli,\r\ncorresponding to the sensation of pleasure or dislike which they call\r\nforth, is shown in various forms of motion of the protoplasm, changes in\r\nthe currents in it, contraction of the central capsule, changes in the\r\nsize, position, and form of the pseudopodia, changes in the volume of the\r\ncalymma (by the evocation of water), &c. Among the sensory functions of the\r\nRadiolaria must be especially mentioned their remarkably developed\r\nperception of hydrostatic equilibrium (see note F), as well as their\r\nperception of distances, so clearly shown in the production of equal\r\nlattice-meshes and other regularly formed skeletal structures (see note G).\r\n\r\n  A. I can add but little to the communication which I made twenty-four\r\n  years ago regarding sensation in the Radiolaria (L. N. 16, pp. 128-131).\r\n  The most important point would be the great difference in irritability\r\n  which must obtain between the pelagic, zonarial and abyssal Radiolaria,\r\n  which may be assumed from a consideration of their very different\r\n  conditions of existence as regards pressure, light, warmth, nutrition,\r\n  &c. It is natural to suppose that the numerous abyssal Radiolaria,\r\n  discovered by the Challenger, which live at great depths (2000 to 4500\r\n  fathoms) in complete darkness, in icy cold and under an enormous\r\n  pressure, must have quite different sensations of pleasure from their\r\n  pelagic relatives which live at the surface of the sea under an\r\n  equatorial sun. Karl Brandt has recently added much to our knowledge\r\n  regarding the special action of different vital conditions upon the\r\n  various Polycyttaria and the degrees of their irritability (L. N. 52, pp.\r\n  113-132).\r\n\r\n  B. Regarding the sensation of pressure or sensation of touch of the\r\n  Radiolaria and the various degrees of their mechanical irritability, see\r\n  L. N. 16, p. 129; L. N. 41, p. 464.\r\n\r\n  C. Regarding the sensation of warmth or temperature-sense and its\r\n  dependence upon different climatic relations, see L. N. 16, p. 129; L. N.\r\n  52, pp. 114-129.\r\n\r\n  D. Regarding the sensation of light, compare L. N. 16, p. 128; L. N. 42,\r\n  p. 304; L. N. 52, pp. 102-104, 114.\r\n\r\n  E. Regarding the sense of taste of the Radiolaria or their peculiar\r\n  sensitiveness towards the different chemical composition of the water,\r\n  change in its salinity, presence of organic impurities, &c., see L. N.\r\n  16, p. 130; L. N. 52, pp. 103, 113. This chemical irritability seems to\r\n  be the most highly developed sense in the Radiolaria, even more so than\r\n  their mechanical irritability.\r\n\r\n  F. The perception of hydrostatic equilibrium among the Radiolaria is\r\n  immediately visible from the position which their bodies, floating freely\r\n  in the water, assume spontaneously, and from the symmetrical development\r\n  of the skeleton, which by its gravitation necessitates a definite\r\n  position. It may be assumed that the development of the various\r\n  geometrical ground forms which correspond to a definite position of\r\n  equilibrium, is the result of this particular kind of perception (compare\r\n  §§ 40-45).\r\n\r\n  {cxlv}G. The plastic perception of distance of the pseudopodia is shown\r\n  by the symmetry with which the forms composing the regular skeletal\r\n  structures (_e.g._, the ordinary lattice-spheres with regular hexagonal\r\n  meshes, the radial spines with equidistant branches) are excreted from\r\n  the exoplasm. Both this form of sensation and the one first mentioned\r\n  (note F) have hitherto received scarcely any attention, but are deserving\r\n  of a thorough physiological investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n225. _The Cell-Soul (Zellseele)._--The common central vital principle,\r\ncommonly called the \"soul,\" which is considered to be the regulator of all\r\nvital functions, appears in the Radiolaria as in other Protista in its\r\nsimplest form, as the cell-soul. By the continual activity of this central\r\n\"psyche\" all vital functions are maintained in unbroken action, and in\r\nuniform correlation. It is also probable that by it the stimulations which\r\nthe peripheral portions of the cell receive from the outer world are first\r\ntransmitted into true sensation, and that, on the other hand, the volition,\r\nwhich alone calls forth spontaneous movements, proceeds from it. The\r\ncentral capsule is most likely the sole organ of this cell-soul or central\r\npsychic organ, and the active portion may be either the endoplasm or the\r\nnucleus, or both. The central capsule may thus (apart from its function as\r\na sporangium, § 215) be regarded as a simple ganglion cell, physiologically\r\ncomparable to the nervous centre of the higher animals, whilst the exoplasm\r\n(sarcomatrix and pseudopodia) are to be compared to the peripheral nervous\r\nsystem and sense organs of the latter. The great simplicity of the\r\nfunctions of the cell-soul which appear in the Radiolaria, and the intimate\r\nconnection of their different psychic activities, give to these unicellular\r\nProtista a special significance for the comprehension of the monistic\r\nelements of a natural psychology.\r\n\r\n  Regarding the theory of the cell-soul as the only psychological theory\r\n  which is able to explain naturally the true nature of the life of the\r\n  soul in all organisms as well as in man, see my address on cell-souls and\r\n  soul-cells (\"Zellseelen und Seelenzellen\") in Gesammelte populäre\r\n  Vorträge aus dem Gebiete der Entwickelungslehre, Heft 1, p. 143; Bonn,\r\n  1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{cxlvi}CHOROLOGICAL SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.--GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n(§§ 226-240.)\r\n\r\n226. _Universal Marine Distribution._--Radiolaria occur in all the seas of\r\nthe world, in all climatic zones and at all depths. Probably under normal\r\nconditions they always float freely in the water, whether their usual\r\nposition be at the surface (pelagic), or at a certain depth (zonarial), or\r\nnear to the bottom of the sea (abyssal). This appears both from numerous\r\ndirect observations, as well as from conclusions which may be drawn from\r\ntheir organisation (and especially their promorphology) regarding their\r\nfloating life (compare §§ 40-50, 219, 220). Hitherto no observation has\r\nbeen recorded, which justifies the assumption that Radiolaria live anywhere\r\nupon the bottom of the sea (on stones, Algæ, or other firm substances),\r\neither sessile or creeping. They perform the latter action, however, when\r\nthey fall accidentally upon a firm basis or are accidentally placed upon\r\nit, but they seem normally always to float freely in the water with\r\npseudopodia radiating in all directions. Active free-swimming movements are\r\nonly met with in the case of the flagellate zoospores (§ 142). The\r\ndevelopment of Radiolaria in large masses is very remarkable (see note A),\r\nand in many parts of the ocean is so great that they play an important part\r\nin the economy of marine life, especially as food for other pelagic and\r\nabyssal animals (see note B). Medium salinity of the water seems to be most\r\nfavourable to their development in masses, although it is not unknown in\r\nseas of high and low salinity (see note C). There are no Radiolaria in\r\nfresh water (see note D).\r\n\r\n  A. The development of Radiolaria takes place in many parts of the ocean\r\n  in astonishingly large masses on the surface, in different strata, and\r\n  near the bottom. The #Collodaria# (and especially the Sphærozoida) often\r\n  cover the surface of the sea in millions, and form a shining layer,\r\n  phosphorescent in the dark like the _Noctilucæ_, as I observed in 1859 in\r\n  the Strait of Messina, in 1866 at the Canaries, and in 1881 in the Indian\r\n  Ocean. Similar masses of _Sphærozoum_ and _Acanthometron_ were seen by\r\n  Johannes Müller on the French and Ligurian coasts (L. N. 12), and John\r\n  Murray found another in the Gulf Stream, off the Færöe Islands, from the\r\n  surface to a depth of 600 fathoms; considerable masses of large PHÆODARIA\r\n  live there also.\r\n\r\n  B. The alimentary canal of Medusæ, Salpæ, Crustacea, Pteropoda, and many\r\n  other pelagic animals is a rich field for the discovery of Radiolaria,\r\n  and many of the species hereinafter described are from such sources.\r\n  Fossil coprolites too (_e.g._, those from the Jura) often contain many\r\n  Polycystina.\r\n\r\n  C. Some ACANTHARIA (#Acanthometra#) and PHÆODARIA (species of _Mesocena_\r\n  and _Dictyocha_) {cxlvii}live in the Baltic; I found their skeletons in\r\n  the alimentary canal of _Aurelia_, Ascidians and Copepods.\r\n\r\n  D. The so-called \"fresh-water Radiolaria,\" which have been described by\r\n  Focke, Greeff, Grenacher and others, are all Heliozoa, without either\r\n  central capsule or calymma.\r\n\r\n\r\n227. _Local distribution._--As regards their local distribution and its\r\nboundaries the Radiolaria show in general the same relations as other\r\npelagic animals. Since they are only to a very slight extent, if at all,\r\ncapable of active horizontal locomotion, the dispersion of the different\r\nspecies from their point of development (or \"centre of creation\") is\r\ndependent upon oceanic currents, the play of winds and waves and all the\r\naccidental causes which influence the transport of pelagic animals in\r\ngeneral. These passive migrations are here, however, as always, of the\r\ngreatest significance, and bring about the wide distribution of individual\r\nspecies in a far higher degree than any active wanderings could do. Any one\r\nwho has ever followed a stream of pelagic animals for hours and seen how\r\nmillions of creatures closely packed together are in a short time carried\r\nalong for miles by such a current, will be in no danger of underestimating\r\nthe enormous importance of marine currents in the passive migration of the\r\nfauna of the sea. Such constant currents may, however, be recognised both\r\nnear the bottom of the sea and at various depths, as well as at the\r\nsurface, and are therefore of just as much significance for the abyssal and\r\nzonarial as for the pelagic Radiolaria. It is easy to explain by this means\r\nhow it is that so many animals of this class (probably indeed the great\r\nmajority) have a wide range of distribution. The number of _cosmopolitan_\r\nspecies which live in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans is already\r\nrelatively large. In each of these three great ocean basins, too, many\r\nspecies show a wide distribution. On the other hand, there are very many\r\nspecies which are hitherto known only from one locality, and probably many\r\nsmall local faunas exist, characterised by the special development of\r\nparticular groups. The observations which we at present possess are too\r\nincomplete, and the rich material of the Challenger is too incompletely\r\nworked out, to enable any definite conclusions to be drawn regarding the\r\nlocal distribution of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n  The statements made in the systematic portion of this Report regarding\r\n  the distribution of the Challenger Radiolaria are very incomplete. In\r\n  most cases only one locality is mentioned, and that is the station (§\r\n  240) in the preparations or bottom deposit from which I first found the\r\n  species in question. Afterwards I often found the same species again in\r\n  one or more additional stations (not seldom in numerous preparations both\r\n  from the Pacific and Atlantic), without the possibility of adding them to\r\n  the habitat recorded under the description. The necessary accurate\r\n  determination and identification of the species (measuring the different\r\n  dimensions, counting the pores, &c.), would have occupied too much time,\r\n  and the writing of this extensive Report would have lasted not ten but\r\n  twenty or thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n228. _Horizontal Distribution._--From the extensive collections of the\r\nChallenger and from the other collections which have furnished a welcome\r\nsupplement to them, it appears {cxlviii}that Radiolaria are distributed\r\nthroughout all seas without distinction of zones and physical conditions,\r\neven though these latter may be the cause of differences in their\r\nqualitative and quantitative development. In the case of the Radiolaria as\r\nwell as of many other classes of animals, the law holds good that the\r\nrichest development of forms and the greatest number of species occurs\r\nbetween the tropics, whilst the frigid zones (both Arctic and Antarctic)\r\nexhibit great masses of individuals, but relatively few genera and species\r\n(see note A). In the Challenger collection the greatest abundance of\r\nspecies of Radiolaria is exhibited by those preparations which were\r\ncollected at low latitudes in the immediate neighbourhood of the equator;\r\nthis is true both of the Atlantic (Stations 346 to 349) and of the Pacific\r\n(Stations 266 to 274); in the former the richest of all is Station 347\r\n(lat. 0° 15' S.), in the latter Station 271 (lat. 0° 33' S.) (see note B).\r\nFrom the tropics the abundance of species seems to diminish regularly\r\ntowards the poles, and more rapidly in the northern than in the southern\r\nhemisphere; the latter also appears, considered as a whole, to possess more\r\nspecies than the former. A limit to the life of the Radiolaria towards the\r\npoles has not yet been found; the expeditions towards the North Pole (see\r\nnote C), like those towards the South (see note D), have obtained\r\nbottom-deposits and ice enclosures which contained Radiolaria; in some of\r\nthe most northerly and most southerly positions which were reached the\r\nnumber of Radiolaria enclosed in the ice was relatively great.\r\n\r\n  A. The greater abundance of Radiolaria in the tropical seas is probably\r\n  to be explained by the more favourable conditions of existence, and in\r\n  particular the larger quantity of nutritive material (especially of\r\n  decayed animals) and not by the higher temperature of the surface, for at\r\n  depths of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms where the abyssal Radiolaria live,\r\n  the temperature is but little above the freezing point or even below it\r\n  (compare the bottom temperatures in the list of Challenger Stations, §\r\n  240).\r\n\r\n  B. Station 271 of the Challenger Expedition, situated almost on the\r\n  equator in the Mid Pacific (lat. 0° 33' S.), exceeds all other parts of\r\n  the earth, hitherto known, in respect of its wealth in Radiolaria, and\r\n  this is true of the pelagic as well as of the zonarial and abyssal forms.\r\n  In the Station List the deposit at this point is stated to be\r\n  \"Globigerina ooze\"; but after the calcareous matter has been removed by\r\n  means of acid, the purest Radiolarian ooze remains, rich in varied and\r\n  remarkable species. More than one hundred new species have been described\r\n  from this Station alone.\r\n\r\n  C. Regarding the Arctic Radiolaria compare the contributions of Ehrenberg\r\n  (L. N. 24, pp. 138, 139, 195) and Brady on the English North Polar\r\n  Expedition, 1875-76 (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1878, vol. i. pp. 425,\r\n  437).\r\n\r\n  D. Regarding the Antarctic Radiolaria, compare § 230, note A, and\r\n  Ehrenberg, Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6, Taf. xxxv., A.), also L. N. 24, pp.\r\n  136-139.\r\n\r\n\r\n229. _Fauna of the Pacific Ocean._--From the splendid discoveries of the\r\nChallenger, and the supplementary observations obtained from other sources,\r\nthe Pacific seems to be the ocean basin which is richest both\r\nquantitatively and qualitatively in Radiolarian life, {cxlix}excelling both\r\nthe Indian and Atlantic Oceans in this respect. It may be assumed with\r\ngreat probability that by far the largest portion of the Pacific has a\r\ndepth of between 2000 and 3000 fathoms, and that its bottom is covered\r\neither with Radiolarian ooze (§ 237) or with a red clay (§ 239), which\r\ncontains many SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and has probably been derived\r\nfor a great part from broken down and metamorphosed Radiolarian ooze (see\r\nnote A). Pure Radiolarian ooze was found by the Challenger eastwards in the\r\nCentral Pacific (over a wide area between lat. 12° N. and 12° S., Stations\r\n265 to 274), and also westwards in the latitude of the Philippines, twenty\r\ndegrees to the east of them (between lat. 5° N. and 15° N.). The great\r\nabundance of Radiolaria present in the neighbourhood of the Philippines and\r\nin the Sunda Sea was already known from other investigations (note B). The\r\nred clay also, which covers a great part of the bottom of the North\r\nPacific, and which was obtained of very constant composition by the\r\nChallenger between lat. 35° N. and 38° N., from Japan to the meridian of\r\nHonolulu (from long. 144° E. to 156° W.), is so pre-eminently rich in\r\nRadiolaria that it often approaches in composition the Radiolarian ooze,\r\nand has probably been derived from it. The track of the Challenger through\r\nthe tropical and northern parts of the Pacific describes nearly three sides\r\nof a rectangle, which includes about half of the enormous Pacific basin,\r\nand from this as well as from other supplementary observations it may with\r\ngreat probability be concluded that by far the largest part of the bed of\r\nthe Pacific (at least three-fourths) is covered either with Radiolarian\r\nooze or with red clay, which contains a larger or smaller amount of the\r\nremains of Radiolaria. With this agrees also the important fact that the\r\nnumerous preparations of pelagic materials and collections of pelagic\r\nanimals, which were collected by the Challenger in the Pacific, almost\r\nalways indicate a corresponding amount of Radiolarian life on the surface.\r\nThis is true in particular also of the South Pacific, between lat. 33° S.\r\nand 40° S. (from long. 133° W. to 73° W., Stations 287 to 301); the surface\r\nof this southern region and the different bathymetrical zones were rich in\r\nnew and peculiar species of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n  A. Many specimens of bottom-deposits from the Pacific, which are entered\r\n  in the Challenger lists either as \"red clay\" or \"Globigerina ooze,\"\r\n  contain larger or smaller quantities of Radiolaria, and the number of\r\n  different species of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA which they contain is\r\n  often so great that the deposit might have been almost as appropriately\r\n  termed \"Radiolarian ooze,\" _e.g._, Stations 241 to 245, and 270, 271\r\n  (compare §§ 236-239).\r\n\r\n  B. Pacific Radiolarian ooze was first obtained by Lieutenant Brooke (May\r\n  11, 1859) between the Philippines and Marianne Islands, from a depth of\r\n  3300 fathoms (lat. 18° 3' N., long. 129° 11' E.). Ehrenberg, who first\r\n  described it, found seventy-nine different species of Polycystina in it,\r\n  and reported \"that their quantity and the number of different forms\r\n  increased with the depth\" (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.\r\n  Berlin, 1860, pp. 466, 588, 766).\r\n\r\n\r\n230. _Fauna of the Indian Ocean._--As regards its Radiolarian fauna the\r\nIndian Ocean is the least known of the three great basins. Still the few\r\nlimited spots, regarding which {cl}investigations are forthcoming, indicate\r\na very rich development of Radiolarian life. Probably it approaches more\r\nnearly the fauna of the Pacific than that of the Atlantic, both as regards\r\nthe abundance and the morphological characters of its species. The\r\nresearches of the Challenger are very limited and incomplete as regards the\r\nIndian Ocean, for the expedition only just touched upon this great ocean\r\nbasin (2000 to 3000 fathoms deep) at its two extremities (westwards at the\r\nCape of Good Hope and eastwards at Tasmania), its course lying for the most\r\npart south of lat. 45° S. and extending beyond lat. 65° S. (from Station\r\n149 to 158, south of lat. 50° S.). It is true that this portion of the\r\nSouth Indian Ocean was shown to contain Radiolaria everywhere, but these\r\nwere more plentiful in individuals than in species. Only from Station 156\r\nto Station 159 (between lat. 62° and 47° S., and long. 95° and 130° E.) was\r\nthe bottom, which consisted partly of Diatom ooze and partly of Globigerina\r\nooze, richer in species (see note A). The gaps left by the Challenger in\r\nthe investigation of the Indian Ocean, have, however, been to some extent\r\nfilled from other sources. As early as 1859 the English \"Cyclops\"\r\nexpedition had shown that the bottom of the Indian Ocean to the east of\r\nZanzibar (lat. 9° 37' S., long. 61° 33' W.) is covered with pure\r\nRadiolarian ooze (see note B). Also since the Tertiary rocks of the Nicobar\r\nIslands are for the most part of the same composition, and since a great\r\nabundance of Radiolaria has been shown to be present both in the east part\r\nof the ocean, between the Cocos Islands and the Sunda Archipelago (see note\r\nC), and in the northern part or Arabian Sea between Socotra and Ceylon (see\r\nnote D); it may be assumed with great probability that the greater part of\r\nthe basin of the Indian Ocean, like that of the Pacific, is covered either\r\nwith Radiolarian ooze or with the characteristic red clay. With this agrees\r\nthe richness of the surface of the Indian Ocean in Radiolaria of the most\r\nvarious groups, which has been more extensively demonstrated.\r\n\r\n  A. The Radiolarian fauna collected by the Challenger on the voyage from\r\n  the Cape to Melbourne, shows in part, namely, from Station 156 to Station\r\n  158, very peculiar and characteristic composition; in particular, the\r\n  Diatom ooze of Station 157 passes over in great part into a Radiolarian\r\n  ooze, mainly composed of #Sphærellaria#. This is worthy of a more\r\n  thorough investigation than I was able, owing to lack of material and\r\n  time, to give it.\r\n\r\n  B. The remarkably pure Radiolarian ooze of Zanzibar, discovered by\r\n  Ehrenberg in 1859, was the earliest known recent example of that deposit.\r\n  It was brought up by Captain Pullen of the English man-of-war \"Cyclops,\"\r\n  from a depth of 2200 fathoms, between Zanzibar and the Seychelles, and\r\n  \"under a magnifying power of 300 diameters, showed at the first glance a\r\n  mass of almost pure Polycystina, such as no sample of a deep-sea deposit\r\n  has hitherto shown. It is very noticeable that in the whole of this mass\r\n  of living forms, no calcareous shells are to be seen\" (Ehrenberg, L. N.\r\n  24, pp. 148, 149).\r\n\r\n  C. For the most important material from the Indian Ocean, I am indebted\r\n  to Captain Heinrich Rabbe of Bremen, who during many voyages in the\r\n  Indian Ocean, in his ship \"Joseph Haydn,\" made numerous collections in\r\n  different localities with the tow-net and the trawl, and admirably\r\n  preserved the rich collections thus made. The greatest abundance of\r\n  Radiolaria was found in those {cli}obtained to the east of Madagascar,\r\n  and next in those from the neighbourhood of the Cocos Islands. I take\r\n  this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Captain Rabbe for the\r\n  liberality with which he placed all this valuable material at my\r\n  disposal.\r\n\r\n  D. On my voyage from Aden to Bombay, and thence to Ceylon (1881), and\r\n  especially on my return journey from Ceylon, between the Maldive Islands\r\n  and Socotra (1882), I carried on a number of experiments with a surface\r\n  net, which yielded a rich fauna of pelagic animals, and among them many\r\n  new species of Radiolaria, for observation. On several nights when the\r\n  smooth surface of the Indian Ocean, unrippled by any wind, shone with the\r\n  most lovely phosphorescent light, I drew up water from the surface with a\r\n  bucket, and obtained a rich booty. A number of other new species of\r\n  Radiolaria from very various parts of the Indian Ocean I obtained from\r\n  the alimentary canal of pelagic animals, such as Medusæ, Salpæ,\r\n  Crustacea, &c. Although the total number of Radiolaria known to me from\r\n  the Indian Ocean is much less than from the Atlantic and Pacific, there\r\n  are several new genera and numerous species among them, which show that a\r\n  careful study of this fauna will be of wide interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n231. _Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean._--The Atlantic Ocean in all parts, of\r\nwhich the pelagic fauna has been examined, has shown the same constant\r\npresence of Radiolaria, and in certain parts of its abyssal deposits a\r\nlarger or smaller quantity of different types belonging to this class; on\r\nthe whole, however, its Radiolarian fauna is inferior to that of the\r\nPacific, and probably also to that of the Indian Ocean, both in quantity\r\nand quality. Pure Radiolarian ooze, such as is so extensively found on the\r\nfloor of the Pacific, and in certain places in that of the Indian Ocean,\r\nhas not yet been found in the Atlantic (see § 237). The red clay, too, of\r\nthe deep Atlantic does not seem to be so rich in Radiolaria as that of the\r\nPacific; nevertheless, the number of species peculiar to the Atlantic is\r\nvery large, and at certain points the abundance of species as well as of\r\nindividuals seems to be scarcely less than in the Pacific. This is\r\nespecially true of the eastern equatorial zone not far from Sierra Leone,\r\nStations 347 to 352 (see note A); also of the South Atlantic between Buenos\r\nAyres and Tristan da Cunha, Stations 324, 325, 331 to 333 (see note B);\r\nand, lastly, in the North Atlantic in the Gulf Stream and near the Canary\r\nIslands (see note C). The fauna of the latter agrees for the most part with\r\nthat of the Mediterranean (see note D). In addition to the material\r\ncollected by the Challenger, other deep-sea investigations have furnished\r\nbottom-deposits from different parts of the ocean, which have proved very\r\nrich in Radiolaria (see note E). Furthermore, since the island of Barbados\r\nconsists for the most part of fossil Radiolarian ooze, it is very probable\r\nthat at certain parts of the tropical Atlantic true Radiolarian ooze, like\r\nthat of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, will eventually be found in depths\r\nbetween 2000 and 3000 fathoms, perhaps over a considerable area.\r\n\r\n  A. The tropical zone of the eastern Atlantic seems to be especially rich\r\n  in peculiar Radiolaria of different species. This is shown by numerous\r\n  preparations from the surface, and from various depths (between lat. 3°\r\n  S. and 11° N., and long. 14° W. to 18° W.), which were made towards the\r\n  {clii}end of the cruise. Unfortunately no bottom-deposits were obtained\r\n  from the most important stations (except Nos. 346 and 347, depths 2350\r\n  and 2250 fathoms) in this region; at these the deposit was a Globigerina\r\n  ooze containing numerous different species of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n  B. In the South Atlantic, between Buenos Ayres and Tristan da Cunha\r\n  (between lat. 35° S. and 43° S., long. 8° W. and 57° W.) there appears to\r\n  be a long stretch covered partly with Globigerina ooze (Stations 331 to\r\n  334), or red clay (Stations 329, 330), partly with blue mud (Stations 318\r\n  to 328), which contains not only large masses of individuals but numerous\r\n  peculiar species of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA. The preparations from\r\n  the surface-takings of this region are also rich in these, as well as in\r\n  peculiar PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n  C. The northern part of the Atlantic appears on the whole to be inferior\r\n  to the tropical and southern portions as regards its richness in\r\n  Radiolaria, and from the western half more especially, only few species\r\n  are known. From my researches at Lanzerote in 1866-67, it appears that\r\n  the pelagic fauna of the Canary Islands is very rich in them, as is also\r\n  the Gulf Stream in the neighbourhood of the Færöe Channel, according to\r\n  the investigations of John Murray (see his Report on the \"Knight-Errant\"\r\n  Expedition, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin., vol. xi., 1882).\r\n\r\n  D. The Radiolaria of the Mediterranean are of special interest, because\r\n  almost all our knowledge of these organisms in the living conditions and\r\n  of their vital functions has been derived from investigations conducted\r\n  on its shores. Johannes Müller laid the foundation of this knowledge by\r\n  his investigations at Messina, and on the Ligurian and French coasts at\r\n  Nice, Cette, and St. Tropez (L. N. 10). The many new Radiolaria which I\r\n  described in my Monograph (L. N. 16, 1862), were for the most part taken\r\n  at Messina, the place which possesses a richer pelagic fauna than any\r\n  other, so far as is yet known, in the Mediterranean. Other new species I\r\n  found afterwards at Villafranca near Nice, in 1864 (L. N. 19), at\r\n  Portofino near Genoa (1880), at Corfu (1877), and at other points on the\r\n  coast. In Messina also, Richard Hertwig collected the material for his\r\n  valuable treatise on the Organisation of the Radiolaria (L. N. 33), after\r\n  he had previously made investigations into their histology at Ajaccio in\r\n  Corsica (L. N. 26). Lastly, at Naples, Cienkowski (L. N. 22) and Karl\r\n  Brandt (L. N. 38, 39, 52) carried out their important investigations into\r\n  the reproduction and symbiosis of the Radiolaria. With respect to the\r\n  character of its Radiolaria, the Mediterranean fauna is to be regarded as\r\n  a special province of the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\n  E. Among the smaller contributions which have been made towards our\r\n  knowledge of the Atlantic Radiolarian fauna, the communications of\r\n  Ehrenberg on the deposits obtained in sounding for the Atlantic cable,\r\n  and on the Mexican Gulf Stream near Florida, deserve special mention (L.\r\n  N. 24, pp. 138, 139-145).\r\n\r\n\r\n232. _Vertical Distribution._--The most important general result of the\r\ndiscoveries of the Challenger, as regards the vertical or bathymetrical\r\ndistribution of the Radiolaria, is the interesting fact that numerous\r\nspecies of this class are found living at the most various depths of the\r\nsea, and that certain species are limited to particular bathymetrical\r\nzones, _i.e._, are adapted to the conditions which obtain there. In this\r\nrespect three different Radiolarian faunas may be distinguished, which may\r\nbe shortly termed \"pelagic,\" \"zonarial,\" and \"abyssal.\" The _pelagic_\r\nRadiolaria swim at the surface, and when they sink (_e.g._, in a stormy\r\nsea), only descend to a small depth, probably not more than from {cliii}20\r\nto 30 fathoms (§ 233). The complicated conditions of existence created by\r\nthe keen struggle for existence at the surface of the sea, give rise to the\r\nformation of very numerous pelagic species, especially of Porulosa\r\n(SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA). The _abyssal_ Radiolaria are very different\r\nfrom those just mentioned; they live at the bottom of the deep-sea, not\r\nresting upon nor attached to it, but probably floating at a little distance\r\nabove it, and are adapted to the conditions of existence which obtain there\r\n(§ 235). Here the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA) seem to predominate.\r\nThe _zonarial_ Radiolaria live floating at various depths between the\r\npelagic and abyssal species (§ 234). In their morphological characters they\r\ngradually approach the pelagic forms upwards and the abyssal downwards.\r\n\r\n  The views which have hitherto been held regarding the bathymetrical or\r\n  vertical distribution of the Radiolaria have been entirely altered by the\r\n  magnificent discoveries of the Challenger, and especially by the\r\n  important observations of Sir Wyville Thomson (L. N. 31) and John Murray\r\n  (L. N. 27). These two distinguished deep-sea explorers have, as a result\r\n  of their wide experience, been convinced that Radiolaria exist at all\r\n  depths of the ocean, and that there are large numbers of true deep-sea\r\n  species which are never found at the surface of the sea nor at slight\r\n  depths (L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 236-238; L. N. 27, pp. 523, 525). The\r\n  result of my ten years' work upon the Challenger Radiolaria, and the\r\n  comparative study of more than a thousand mountings from all depths, has\r\n  only been to confirm this opinion, and I am further persuaded that it\r\n  will some day be possible by the aid of suitable nets (not yet invented)\r\n  to distinguish different faunistic zones in the various depths of the\r\n  sea. In this connection may be mentioned the specially interesting fact\r\n  that the species of Radiolaria of one and the same family present in the\r\n  different depths characteristic morphological distinctions, which\r\n  obviously correspond to their different physiological relations in the\r\n  struggle for existence. Owing to those extensive discoveries, the\r\n  representation which I gave in my Monograph (1862, L. N. 16, pp. 172-196)\r\n  of the vertical distribution of the Radiolaria, and of their life in the\r\n  greatest depths of the sea, has been entirely changed. Compare also\r\n  Bütschli (L. N. 41, p. 466).\r\n\r\n\r\n233. _The Pelagic Fauna._--The surface of the open ocean seems everywhere,\r\nat a certain distance from the coast at least, to be peopled by crowds of\r\nliving Radiolaria. In the tropical zone these pelagic crowds consist of\r\nmany different species, whilst in the frigid zones, on the other hand, they\r\nare made up of many individuals belonging to but few species. Most of these\r\ninhabitants of the surface may be regarded as truly pelagic species, which\r\neither remain always at the surface or descend only very slightly below it.\r\nProbably most Porulosa (both SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA) belong to this\r\ngroup; whilst but few Osculosa occur in it, and fewer PHÆODARIA than\r\nNASSELLARIA. In general the pelagic Radiolaria are distinguished from the\r\nabyssal by the more delicate and slender structure of their skeletons; the\r\npores of the lattice-shells are larger, the intervening trabeculæ thinner;\r\nthe armature of spines, spathillæ, anchors, &c., is more various and more\r\nhighly developed. Numerous forms are to be found among the pelagic\r\n{cliv}Radiolaria which have either an incomplete skeleton or none at all.\r\nWhen the pelagic forms leave the surface on account of unfavourable\r\nweather, they appear only to sink to slight depths (probably not below 20\r\nor 30 fathoms). Within the limits of the same family the size of the\r\npelagic species seems to be on an average greater than that of the related\r\nabyssal forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n234. _The Zonarial Fauna._--Between the pelagic fauna living at the surface\r\nof the open sea and the abyssal, which floats immediately over the bottom,\r\nthere appears to be usually a middle fauna, which inhabits the different\r\nbathymetrical zones of the intermediate water, and hence may be shortly\r\ncalled the \"zonarial\" fauna.  The different species of Radiolaria which\r\ninhabit these different strata in the same vertical column of water present\r\ndifferences corresponding to those of the plants composing the several\r\nzones of vegetation, which succeed each other at different heights on a\r\nmountain; they correspond to the different conditions of existence which\r\nare presented by the different strata of water, and to which they have\r\nbecome adapted in the struggle for existence. The existence of such\r\nbathymetrical zones has been shown by those important, if not numerous,\r\nobservations of the Challenger, in which the tow-net was used at different\r\ndepths at one and the same Station. In several cases the character of the\r\nRadiolarian fauna at different depths presented characteristic differences.\r\n\r\n  For the present, and until we are better acquainted with the characters\r\n  of the Radiolarian fauna at different depths, we may distinguish\r\n  provisionally the following _five bathymetrical zones_:--(1) The\r\n  _pelagic_ zone, extending from the surface to a depth of about 25\r\n  fathoms; (2) the _pellucid_ zone, extending from 25 to 150 fathoms, or as\r\n  far as the influence of the sunlight makes itself felt; (3) the _obscure_\r\n  zone, extending from 150 to 2000 fathoms, or from the depth at which\r\n  sunlight disappears to that at which the influence of the water\r\n  containing carbonic acid begins and the calcareous organisms vanish; (4)\r\n  the _siliceous_ zone, extending from 2000 or 2500 to about 3000 fathoms,\r\n  in which only siliceous not calcareous Rhizopoda are found, and in which\r\n  the peculiar conditions of the lowest regions have not yet appeared; (5)\r\n  the _abyssal_ zone, in which the accumulation of the oceanic deposits,\r\n  and the influence of the bottom currents, create new conditions of\r\n  existence. So far as our isolated and incomplete observations of the\r\n  zonarial Radiolarian fauna extend, it appears that the subclass Porulosa\r\n  (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA) predominates in the two upper zones, and as\r\n  the depth increases is gradually replaced by the subclass Osculosa\r\n  (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA), so that the latter predominates in the two\r\n  lowest zones. The obscure zone which lies in the middle is probably the\r\n  poorest in species. In general, the morphological characters of the\r\n  zonarial fauna appear to change gradually upwards into the delicate form\r\n  of the pelagic and downwards into the robust constitution of the abyssal;\r\n  so also the average size of the individuals (within the limits of the\r\n  same family) appears to increase upwards and decrease downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n235. _The Abyssal Fauna._--The great majority of Radiolaria which have\r\nhitherto been observed, and which are described in the systematic portion\r\nof this Report, have been obtained from the bottom of the deep-sea, and\r\nmore than half of all the species have been {clv}derived from the pure\r\nRadiolarian ooze, which forms the bed of the Central Pacific at depths of\r\nfrom 2000 to 4000 fathoms (§ 237). Many of these abyssal forms were brought\r\nup with the malacoma uninjured, and they show, both when mounted\r\nimmediately in balsam, and when preserved in alcohol, all the soft parts\r\nalmost as clearly as fresh preparations of pelagic Radiolaria. These\r\nspecies are to be regarded as truly abyssal, _i.e._, as forms which live\r\nfloating only a little distance above the bottom of the deep-sea, having\r\nbecome adapted to the peculiar conditions of life which obtain in the\r\nlowest regions of the ocean. Probably the majority of the PHÆODARIA belong\r\nto these abyssal Radiolaria, as well as a large number of NASSELLARIA, but\r\non the other hand, only a small number of ACANTHARIA and SPUMELLARIA are\r\nfound there. A character common to these abyssal forms, and rarely found in\r\nthose from the surface or from slight depths, is found in their small size\r\nand their heavy massive skeletons, in which they strikingly resemble the\r\nfossil Radiolaria of Barbados and the Nicobar Islands. The lattice-work of\r\nthe shell is coarser, its trabeculæ thicker and its pores smaller than in\r\npelagic species of the same group; also the apophyses (spines, spathillæ,\r\ncoronets, &c.), are much less developed than in the latter. From these true\r\nabyssal Radiolaria must be carefully distinguished those species whose\r\nempty skeletons, devoid of all soft parts, occur also in the Radiolarian\r\nooze of the deep-sea, but are clearly only the sunken remains of dead\r\nforms, which have lived at the surface or in some of the upper zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n236. _Deposits containing Radiolaria._--The richest collection of\r\nRadiolaria is found in the deposits of ooze which form the bed of the\r\nocean. Although the pelagic material skimmed from the surface of the sea,\r\nand the zonarial material taken by sinking the tow-net to various depths,\r\nare always more or less rich in Radiolaria, still the number of species\r\nthus obtained is, on the whole, much less than has hitherto been got merely\r\nfrom deep-sea deposits. Of course the skeletons found in the mud of the\r\nocean-bed, may belong either to the abyssal species which live there (§\r\n235), or to the zonarial (§ 234), or to the pelagic species (§ 233), for\r\nthe siliceous skeletons of these latter sink to the bottom after their\r\ndeath. Almost all these remains found in the deposits belong to the\r\nsiliceous \"Polycystina\" (SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA); PHÆODARIA occur but\r\nsparingly, and ACANTHARIA are entirely wanting, for their acanthin skeleton\r\nreadily dissolves. The abundance of Radiolaria varies greatly according to\r\nthe composition and origin of the deposits. In general marine deposits may\r\nbe divided into two main divisions, terrigenous and abyssal, or, more\r\nshortly, muds and oozes. The _terrigenous_ deposits (or muds) include all\r\nthose sediments which are made up for the most part of materials worn away\r\nfrom the coasts of continents and islands, or brought down into the sea by\r\nrivers. Their greatest extent from the coast is about 200 nautical miles.\r\nThey contain varying quantities of Radiolaria, but much fewer than those of\r\nthe next group. The _abyssal_ deposits (or oozes) usually commence at a\r\ndistance of from 100 to 200 nautical miles {clvi}from the coast. In general\r\nthey are characterised by great uniformity, corresponding to the constancy\r\nof the conditions under which they are laid down; they may be divided into\r\nthree categories, the true Radiolarian ooze (§ 237), Globigerina ooze (§\r\n238), and red clay (§ 239). Of these three most important deep-sea\r\nformations the first is by far the richest in Radiolaria, although the\r\nother two contain often very many siliceous shells.\r\n\r\n  The marvellous discoveries of the Challenger have thrown upon the nature\r\n  of marine deposits an entirely new light, which justifies most important\r\n  conclusions regarding the geographical distribution and geological\r\n  significance of the Radiolaria. Since Dr. John Murray and the Abbé Renard\r\n  will treat fully of these interesting relations in a forthcoming volume\r\n  of the Challenger series (Report on the Deep-Sea Deposits), it will be\r\n  sufficient here to refer to their preliminary publication already\r\n  published (Narrative of the Cruise of H.M.S. Challenger, 1885, vol. ii.\r\n  part ii. pp. 915-926); see also the earlier communications by John Murray\r\n  (1876, L. N. 27, pp. 518-537), and by Sir Wyville Thomson (The Atlantic,\r\n  L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 206-246). In the Narrative (_loc. cit._, p. 916)\r\n  the following table of marine deposits is given:--\r\n\r\n                       {Shore formations,       } Found in inland\r\n                       {Blue mud,               }   seas and along the\r\n                       {Green mud and sand,     }   shores of\r\n                       {Red mud,                }   continents.\r\n  Terrigenous deposits.{\r\n                       {Volcanic mud and sand,  } Found around oceanic\r\n                       {Coral mud and sand,     }   islands and along the\r\n                       {Coralline mud and sand, }   shores of continents.\r\n\r\n                       {Globigerina ooze,       } Found in the abysmal\r\n                       {Pteropod ooze,          }   regions of the\r\n  Abysmal deposits.    {Diatom ooze,            }   ocean basins.\r\n                       {Radiolarian ooze,       }\r\n                       {Red clay,               }\r\n\r\n237. _Radiolarian Ooze._--By Radiolarian ooze, in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, are understood those oceanic deposits, the greater part of which\r\n(often more than three-quarters) is composed of the siliceous skeletons of\r\nthis class. Such _pure_ Radiolarian ooze has only been found in limited\r\nareas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is most conspicuous in the\r\nCentral Pacific, between lat. 12° N. and 8° S., long. 148° W. to 152° W.,\r\nthe depth being everywhere between 2000 and 3000 fathoms (Stations 266 to\r\n268 and 272 to 274). In the deepest of the Challenger soundings (Station\r\n225, 4475 fathoms) the bottom is composed of pure Radiolarian ooze, as well\r\nas at the next Station in the Western Tropical Pacific (Station 226, 2300\r\nfathoms), the latitude varying from 12° N. to 15° N., and the longitude\r\nfrom 142° E. to 144° E. In the Indian Ocean also, pure Radiolarian ooze was\r\nfound in the year 1859 between Zanzibar and the Seychelles, this being the\r\nfirst known example of it (§ 230). On the other hand, it has not yet been\r\nfound in the bed of the Atlantic; but the Tertiary formations of Barbados\r\n(Antilles, § 231) like those of the Nicobar Islands (Further India), are to\r\nbe regarded as pure Radiolarian {clvii}ooze in the fossil condition.\r\n_Mixed_ Radiolarian ooze is the name given to those deposits in which the\r\nRadiolaria exceed any of the other organic constituents, although they do\r\nnot make up half the total mass. To this category belong a large number of\r\nthe Challenger soundings which are entered in the Station list either as\r\nred clay or Globigerina ooze. Such mixed Radiolarian ooze has been\r\ndiscovered (A) in the North Pacific in an elongated area of red clay\r\nextending from Station 241 to Station 245 (perhaps even from Station 238 to\r\nStation 253), that is, at least, from long. 157° E. to 175° E., between\r\nlat. 35° N. and 37° N.; (B) in the tropical Central Pacific in the\r\nGlobigerina ooze of Stations 270 and 271. The ooze from the latter station,\r\nsituated almost on the equator (lat. 0° 33' S., long. 151° 34' W.), is\r\nspecially remarkable, for it has yielded more new species of SPUMELLARIA\r\nand NASSELLARIA than any other Station, not excluding even the neighbouring\r\nStations 268, 269, and 272. Probably such mixed Radiolarian ooze is very\r\nwidely distributed in the depths of the ocean, as, for example, in the\r\nSouth Pacific (Stations 288, 289, 300, and 302), and in the Southern Ocean\r\n(Stations 156 to 159); also in the South Atlantic (Stations 324, 325, 331,\r\n332) and in the tropical Atlantic (Stations 348 to 352). When carefully\r\npurified and decalcified by acids, Radiolarian ooze appears as a fine\r\nshining white powder; in the raw state it is yellowish or reddish,\r\nsometimes reddish-brown or dark brown in colour, according to the quantity\r\nof oxides of iron, manganese, &c., which it contains. Calcareous skeletons\r\n(especially the tests of pelagic Foraminifera) do not occur at all or only\r\nin very minute quantities in _pure_ Radiolarian ooze from more than 2000\r\nfathoms, whilst specimens of _mixed_ ooze often contain considerable\r\nquantities of them.\r\n\r\n  Pure Radiolarian ooze was first described by Dr. John Murray as regards\r\n  its peculiar nature and composition under the name \"Radiolarian ooze\"\r\n  (1876, L. N. 27, pp. 525, 526); compare also Sir Wyville Thomson (The\r\n  Atlantic, L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 231-238), and John Murray (Narr. Chall.\r\n  Exp., L. N. 53, vol. i. pt. ii. pp. 920-926, pl. N. fig. 2). The\r\n  different specimens of pure Radiolarian ooze obtained by the Challenger\r\n  from the Pacific, and handed to me for investigation, are from depths of\r\n  from 2250 fathoms to 4475 fathoms, and may be divided according to their\r\n  composition into three different groups:--I. The Radiolarian ooze of the\r\n  Western Tropical Pacific, Stations 225 and 226, from depths of 4475 and\r\n  2300 fathoms (lat. 11° N. to 15° N., and long. 142° E. to 144° E.). II.\r\n  The Radiolarian ooze of the northern half of the Central Pacific,\r\n  Stations 265 to 269, from depths of 2550 to 2900 fathoms. III. The\r\n  Radiolarian ooze of the southern half of the Central Pacific, Stations\r\n  270 to 274, from depths of 2350 to 2925 fathoms. A fourth group would be\r\n  constituted by the Radiolarian ooze from the Philippines, which was\r\n  brought up by Brooke in 1860 near the Marianne Islands from 3300 fathoms,\r\n  and described by Ehrenberg (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.\r\n  Berlin, 1860, p. 765). The Diatom ooze, too, found by the Challenger in\r\n  the Antarctic regions (Stations 152 to 157) is in some parts so rich in\r\n  Radiolaria that it passes over into true Radiolarian ooze. Regarding the\r\n  Radiolarian ooze from Zanzibar, obtained by Captain Pullen in 1859 from\r\n  2200 fathoms (§ 230), we have only the incomplete communications of\r\n  Ehrenberg (L. N. 24, p. 147). A more accurate knowledge of these deposits\r\n  from the Indian Ocean, and of {clviii}those which we may with probability\r\n  expect from the tropical eastern Atlantic, will be sure to increase very\r\n  widely our knowledge of the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n238. _Globigerina Ooze._--Next to the Radiolarian ooze proper the\r\nGlobigerina ooze is the deposit which is richest in the remains of\r\nRadiolaria. Often these are so abundant that it is doubtful to which\r\ncategory the specimen should be referred (_e.g._, Stations 270 and 271, see\r\n§ 237). In fact, the two pass without any sharp boundary into each other,\r\nand both present transitions to the Diatom ooze. Next to red clay (§ 239),\r\nGlobigerina ooze is the most widely distributed of all sediments, and forms\r\na large part of the bed of the ocean at depths of 250 to 2900 fathoms\r\n(especially between 1000 and 2000 fathoms). It covers extensive areas at\r\ndepths below 1800 fathoms, and in still deeper water is replaced by red\r\nclay. It is a fine-grained white, grey, or yellowish powder, which\r\nsometimes becomes coloured rose, red, or brown owing to the admixture of\r\noxides of iron and manganese. True Globigerina ooze consists for the most\r\npart of the accumulated calcareous shells of pelagic Foraminifera,\r\nprincipally _Globigerina_ and _Orbulina_, but also _Hastigerina_,\r\n_Pulvinulina_, &c. It contains usually from 50 to 80 per cent. of calcium\r\ncarbonate, the extreme values being 40 and 95 per cent. After this has been\r\nremoved by acids, there remains a residue, which consists partly of the\r\nsiliceous shells of Radiolaria and Diatoms, and partly of mineral particles\r\nidentical with the volcanic elements of the red clay.\r\n\r\n  Regarding the composition and significance of the Globigerina ooze, see\r\n  John Murray (L. N. 27, pp. 523-525, and L. N. 53, vol. i. p. 919).\r\n  Recently this author has separated from the Globigerina ooze (_sensu\r\n  stricto_), the _Pteropod ooze_, distinguished from the former by the\r\n  greater abundance of Pteropod shells and calcareous shells of larger\r\n  pelagic organisms which it contains. It is found in moderate depths (at\r\n  most 1500 fathoms), and contains fewer Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n239. _Red Clay._--This is quantitatively the most important of all deep-sea\r\ndeposits, covering by far the greatest extent of the three great ocean\r\nbasins at depths greater than 2200 fathoms. It thus far surpasses in area\r\nthe other deposits, both Radiolaria and Globigerina oozes, and commonly\r\nforms a still deeper layer beneath them. Probably these three deep-sea\r\ndeposits together cover about three-eighths of the whole surface of the\r\nearth, that is, about as much as all the continents together, whilst only\r\ntwo-eighths are covered by the terrigenous deposits. Red clay is\r\nprincipally composed of silicate of alumina, mixed in various proportions\r\nwith other finely granular substances; its usual red colour, which\r\nsometimes passes over into grey or brown, is more especially due to\r\nadmixture of oxides of iron and manganese. Calcareous matter is usually\r\nentirely wanting, or present only in traces, whilst free silica is found in\r\nvery variable, often considerable quantities. The chief mass of the red\r\nclay consists of volcanic ashes, pumice, fragments of lava, &c., whilst a\r\nlarge part of it is generally composed of shells of Radiolaria or fragments\r\nof {clix}them; in many places the number of well-preserved skeletons\r\ncontained in the red clay is very considerable, so that it passes over\r\ngradually into the Radiolarian ooze (_e.g._, in the North Pacific, Stations\r\n238 to 253, see § 237). Hence it may be supposed that a large part of the\r\nred clay consists of decomposed Radiolarian ooze.\r\n\r\n  The characteristic composition and fundamental significance of the red\r\n  clay in the formation of the deep-sea bed were first made known by the\r\n  discoveries of the Challenger (compare John Murray, 1876, L. N. 27, p.\r\n  527, and Narr. Chall. Exp., L. N. 53, vol. i. pt. ii. pp. 920-926, pl. N;\r\n  also Wyville Thomson, The Atlantic, L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 226-229).  The\r\n  mineral components of the red clay are for the most part of volcanic\r\n  origin, due to the decomposition of pumice, lava, &c. Among the organic\r\n  remains found in it, the siliceous skeletons of Radiolaria are by far the\r\n  most important, and their number is often considerable. A large portion\r\n  of the red clay appears to me to consist of broken down Radiolarian\r\n  shells, in which a peculiar metamorphism probably has taken place. Sir\r\n  Wyville Thomson was of opinion that a considerable proportion of it\r\n  consisted of the remains of Globigerina ooze, the calcareous constituents\r\n  of which had been removed by the carbon dioxide in the deep-sea water (L.\r\n  N. 31, _loc. cit._). Among these remains, however, the siliceous\r\n  skeletons of the Radiolaria play a significant and often the most\r\n  important part. Furthermore, John Murray has called attention to the fact\r\n  that in many deep-sea deposits yellow and red insoluble particles remain,\r\n  which unmistakably present the form of Radiolarian shells (L. N. 27, p.\r\n  513). At Station 303 he found \"amorphous clayey matter, rounded yellow\r\n  minerals, many Radiolaria-shaped;\" at Station 302 there was sediment\r\n  \"consisting almost entirely of small rounded red mineral particles; many\r\n  of these had the form of both Foraminifera and Radiolaria; and it seemed\r\n  as if some substance had been deposited in and on these organisms.\"\r\n  Similar transitions from well-preserved Radiolarian shells into amorphous\r\n  mineral particles I have found in several other specimens of Challenger\r\n  soundings, and consider them a further argument for the supposition that\r\n  the Radiolaria often take an important share in the formation of the red\r\n  clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n240. _List of Stations at which Radiolaria were observed on the Challenger\r\nExpedition._--The 168 Stations recorded below, in soundings or surface\r\npreparations from which I found Radiolaria, belong to the most various\r\nparts of the sea which the Challenger traversed during her voyage round the\r\nworld; they constitute about half of the (364) observing Stations contained\r\nin the official list published in the Narrative of the Cruise (Narr. Chall.\r\nExp., vol. i. part ii. Appendix ii.).\r\n\r\n  In addition to the particulars given in the list regarding the\r\n  geographical position of the Station, depth, temperature, and composition\r\n  of the bottom deposit, I have added the result of my investigations as\r\n  regards the relative abundance of the Radiolaria in each. The five\r\n  letters (A to E) denote the following degrees of frequency:--A, abundant\r\n  Radiolaria (AI, pure Radiolarian ooze; AII, mixed Radiolarian ooze); B,\r\n  very numerous Radiolaria (but not a predominating quantity); C, many\r\n  Radiolaria (medium quantity); D, few Radiolaria; E, very few Radiolaria\r\n  (as they occur almost always). In using these symbols regard has been had\r\n  to abundance of the abyssal as well as of the zonarial and pelagic forms\r\n  (§ 232); sometimes also the estimated number of Radiolaria has been\r\n  inserted, based upon information given by John Murray in his Preliminary\r\n  Report (L. N. 27), and in the Narrative of the Cruise (L. N. 53), as well\r\n  as by Henry B. Brady in his Report on the {clx}Foraminifera (Zool. Chall.\r\n  Exp., part xxii., 1884). From Stations 348 to 352 in the Eastern Tropical\r\n  Atlantic no specimens of the bottom were obtained, but a rich pelagic\r\n  Radiolarian fauna was demonstrated by numerous preparations from the\r\n  surface. The depths are given in fathoms and the temperature in degrees\r\n  Fahrenheit. In the column describing the nature of the bottom the\r\n  following abbreviations are used:--\r\n\r\n  rad. oz. = Radiolarian ooze (§ 237).\r\n  gl. oz. = Globigerina ooze (§ 238).\r\n  r. cl. = red clay (§ 239).\r\n  pt. oz. = Pteropod ooze (see p. clviii).\r\n  di. oz. = Diatom ooze (see p. clvii).\r\n  bl. m. = blue mud,        } terrigenous deposits\r\n  gr. m. = green mud,       }  (see p. clvi).\r\n  volc. m. = volcanic mud,  }\r\n  r. m. = red mud.\r\n\r\n  +----------+-----------+--------+------------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |          |           |        |   Bottom   |           |   Relative   |\r\n  |Challenger| Locality. |Depth in|Temperature,| Nature of | Abundance of |\r\n  | Station. |           |Fathoms.|    ° F.    |  Bottom.  |  Radiolaria. |\r\n  +----------+-----------+--------+------------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |          |           |        |            |           |              |\r\n  |     1.   |  N.

DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n(§§ 241-250.)\r\n\r\n241. _Historical Distribution._--Radiolaria are found fossil in all the\r\nmore important groups of the sedimentary rocks of the earth's crust. Whilst\r\na few years ago their well-preserved siliceous skeletons were only known in\r\nconsiderable quantity from Cainozoic marls (§ 242), very many SPUMELLARIA\r\nand NASSELLARIA have recently been found in Mesozoic and a few in Palæozoic\r\nstrata. By the aid of improved modern methods of investigation (especially\r\nby the preparation of thin sections of very hard rocks) it has been shown\r\nthat many hard siliceous minerals, especially cryptocrystalline quartz,\r\ncontain numerous well-preserved Radiolaria, and sometimes are mainly\r\ncomposed of closely compacted masses of such siliceous shells; of this kind\r\nare many quartzites of the Jura (§ 243). These Jurassic quartzes\r\n(Switzerland), as well as the Tertiary marls (Barbados) and clays (Nicobar\r\nIslands), are to be regarded as \"fossil Radiolarian ooze\" (§ 237). Dense\r\nmasses of compressed SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA form the principal part of\r\nthese rocks. Isolated or in smaller quantities, fossil Polycystina,\r\nbelonging to different families of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, also occur\r\nin in other rocks, and even in some of Palæozoic origin. Since specimens\r\nhave also been recently found both in Silurian and Cambrian strata, it may\r\nbe stated that as regards their historical distribution, Radiolaria occur\r\nin all fossiliferous sedimentary deposits, from the oldest to those of the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n242. _Cainozoic Radiolaria._--The great majority of fossil Radiolaria which\r\nhave hitherto been described, belong to the Cainozoic or Tertiary period,\r\nand in fact, to its middle portion, the Miocene period. At this period the\r\nrichest and most important of all the Radiolarian formations were\r\ndeposited, such as the pure \"Polycystine marl\" of Barbados (see note A),\r\nalso that of Grotte in Sicily (see note B), and the clay of the Nicobar\r\nIslands (see note C). Besides the above-mentioned deposits, which may be\r\ndesignated \"pure\" fossil Radiolarian ooze, many deposits containing these\r\norganisms have recently been discovered in widely separated parts of the\r\nearth, partly of the nature of tripoli or marl, partly resembling clay.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned in the first place many coasts and islands of\r\nthe Mediterranean, both on the south coast of Europe (Sicily, Calabria,\r\nGreece), and the north coast of Africa (from Oran to Tripoli). The\r\nextensive layers of tripoli which are found in these Mediterranean Tertiary\r\nmountains belong to the upper Miocene (Tortona stage), and consist partly\r\nof marl rich in calcareous matter, and resembling chalk, partly passing\r\nover into plastic clay or \"Kieselguhr\" (§ 246). The quantity of Radiolaria\r\ncontained varies, and is more conspicuous the fewer the calcareous shells\r\nof Foraminifera present. Similar Tertiary Polycystine formations occur in\r\nsome parts of America (see note D); probably they have a very wide\r\ndistribution. In their general morphological characters, the Tertiary\r\nSPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA {clxv}are related to those forms which are\r\nfound in the recent Radiolarian ooze of the depths of the Pacific,\r\nespecially to the species which are characteristic of the Challenger\r\nStations 225, 226, 265 and 268. Many living genera and families (_e.g._,\r\nmost #Larcoidea# and #Stephoidea#) have not yet been found in the Tertiary\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n  A. The famous Polycystine marl of Barbados in the Antilles, which Robert\r\n  Schomburgk discovered forty years ago, belongs to the Miocene formation,\r\n  and is the richest and best known of all the important Radiolarian\r\n  deposits (see L. N. 16, pp. 5-8). After Ehrenberg had published in\r\n  December 1846 the first preliminary communication regarding its\r\n  composition out of masses of well-preserved Polycystina, he was able in\r\n  the following year to describe no less than 282 species from it; he\r\n  distributed these in 44 genera and 7 families (L. N. 4, 1847, p. 54). In\r\n  the year 1854 Ehrenberg published figures of 33 species in his\r\n  Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6,  Taf. xxxvi.); but it was only in 1873 that he\r\n  published descriptions of 265 species (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d.\r\n  Wiss. Berlin, Jan. 30, pp. 213-263). Finally there followed in 1875 his\r\n  Fortsetzung der Mikrogeologischen Studien, mit specieller Rücksicht auf\r\n  den Polycystinen-Mergel von Barbados (L. N. 25). On the thirty plates\r\n  which accompany this the last work of Ehrenberg, 282 species are figured\r\n  and named, of which 54 are SPUMELLARIA (13 #Sphæroidea#, 8 #Prunoidea#,\r\n  33 #Discoidea#), and 228 NASSELLARIA (2 #Stephoidea#, 38 #Spyroidea#, and\r\n  188 #Cyrtoidea#). The fourth section of this memoir contains a survey of\r\n  the Polycystine formation of Barbados (pp. 106-115), and the fifth\r\n  section the special description of a large specimen of rock from Mount\r\n  Hillaby in Barbados (see also L. N. 28, p. 117, and L. N. 41, pp.\r\n  476-478). The account given by Ehrenberg of the Polycystina of Barbados\r\n  is in many respects very incomplete, and very far from exhausting this\r\n  rich mine of remarkable forms. This may be readily seen from the\r\n  twenty-five plates of figures of Polycystins in the Barbados Chalk\r\n  Deposit published by Bury in 1862 (L. N. 17). The number of species here\r\n  figured (140 to 142) is about half of those given by Ehrenberg; and there\r\n  are among them numerous generic types, some of great interest, which were\r\n  entirely overlooked by the latter; _e.g._ _Saturnalis_ (#Sphæroidea#),\r\n  _Cannartidium_ (#Prunoidea#), _Tympanidium_ (#Stephoidea#),\r\n  _Cinclopyramis_ (#Cyrtoidea#), &c. Finally, Ehrenberg always (until 1875)\r\n  ignored Bury's atlas, which had been published thirteen years ago and was\r\n  quite accessible to him. How different were the contents of the two works\r\n  may easily be seen from the following abstract.\r\n\r\n_Comparative View of the Species of Fossil Radiolaria from Barbados made\r\nknown by the figures of Bury in 1862 and of Ehrenberg in 1875._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+--------------------+--------+-----------+-------+\r\n  |    Legion.        |            Order.  |  Bury. | Ehrenberg.| Total.|\r\n  +-------------------+--------------------+--------+-----------+-------+\r\n  |  I.

N. 40), and\r\n  gave in particular a very accurate morphological analysis of 12 new\r\n  NASSELLARIA (3 #Stephoidea#, 3 #Spyroidea#, and 6 #Cyrtoidea#; L. N. 40,\r\n  Taf. xxxii., xxxiii.). The number of the fossil species collected in the\r\n  Barbados marl is, however, greater than would appear from the\r\n  above-quoted communications. My respected friend, Dr. R. Teuscher, of\r\n  Jena, has, at my request, made a large number (about a thousand) of very\r\n  accurate drawings with the camera lucida of Polycystina from Barbados\r\n  (see p. 1760). From these it appears that the variations in the structure\r\n  of the shells, with respect to number, size, and form of the\r\n  lattice-pores, of the spines, &c., is much greater than would be supposed\r\n  from the figures of Ehrenberg and Bury. I have thus come to the\r\n  conviction that the number of species from Barbados (using the word\r\n  \"species\" in the sense understood by those authors) is not less than 400\r\n  and probably more than 500. Descriptions of some particularly interesting\r\n  new species from this series have been included in the systematic account\r\n  of the Challenger Radiolaria. A complete critical investigation of the\r\n  Radiolaria of Barbados, and especially an accurate comparison of these\r\n  Cainozoic species with the Mesozoic forms from the Jura, on the one hand,\r\n  and with recent types on the other, must be left to the future for its\r\n  accomplishment (see § 246).\r\n\r\n  B. The Cainozoic Polycystine tripoli or marl of the Mediterranean coast,\r\n  which is probably always of Miocene origin, forms very extensive mountain\r\n  ranges both in the south of Europe (Sicily, Calabria, Greece) and in the\r\n  north of Africa (from Oran to Tripoli) (§ 246). Hitherto, however, only\r\n  one locality has been thoroughly investigated, namely, Grotte in the\r\n  province of Girgenti in Sicily (L. N. 35). In the accurate account which\r\n  was given of it by Stöhr in 1880, 118 species were described, distributed\r\n  in 40 genera (L. N. 35; pp. 72-84); of these 118 species 78 are quite\r\n  new, 25 are identical with previously known fossils, and 29 identical\r\n  with living forms. Among them are 73 SPUMELLARIA (28 #Sphæroidea#, 8\r\n  #Prunoidea#, and 37 #Discoidea#), but only 40 NASSELLARIA (1\r\n  #Stephoidea#, 6 #Spyroidea#, and 33 #Cyrtoidea#), and 5 PHÆODARIA\r\n  (Dictyochida). The other parts of Sicily from which the same upper\r\n  Miocene tripoli has been investigated (belonging to the Tortona stage)\r\n  have proved less rich than Grotte. The best known of these places is\r\n  Caltanisetta, since upon three genera discovered here (_Haliomma_,\r\n  _Cornutella_, _Lithocampe_) the group Polycystina was founded by\r\n  Ehrenberg in 1838 (see L. N. 16, p. 3). Afterwards 31 species were\r\n  described from this locality, of which 23 were again found in Grotte. The\r\n  richest deposit on the Mediterranean coast, however, appears to be at\r\n  Oran. A small specimen of the Kieselguhr found there, which was recently\r\n  sent to me by Professor Steinman, proved to be pure Radiolarian ooze,\r\n  very similar to that now found in the Central Pacific, and contained many\r\n  hitherto undescribed species; it is deserving of careful investigation\r\n  and comparison.\r\n\r\n  C. Regarding the Tertiary Radiolarian clay of the Nicobar Islands, see §\r\n  247 and L. N. 25, pp. 116-120. Its fauna is incompletely known; probably\r\n  it is of Miocene or Oligocene origin.\r\n\r\n  D. Cainozoic tripoli, containing larger or smaller quantities of\r\n  Radiolaria, appears to be rather widely distributed in America. Ehrenberg\r\n  has described such from South America (polishing-slate from Morro di\r\n  Mijellones, on the coast between Chili and Bolivia), and from North\r\n  America (Richmond and Petersburg in Virginia, Piscataway in Maryland).\r\n  Similar deposits are also found in the Bermuda Islands (L. N. 4, 1855-56;\r\n  L. N. 6, Taf. 18; L. N. 16, pp. 3-9; L. N. 41, pp. 475-478, and L. N. 25,\r\n  pp. 2-6).\r\n\r\n\r\n{clxvii}243. _Mesozoic Radiolaria._--From the Mesozoic or Secondary period\r\nnumerous well-preserved Radiolaria have recently been described. They\r\nbelong for the most part to the Jurassic formation (see notes A, B, C),\r\nwhilst the more recent Chalk (see note D) and the older Trias (see note E)\r\nhave hitherto yielded but few species. All the main divisions of the Jura,\r\nboth the upper (Malm) and the middle (Dogger), and especially the lower\r\n(Lias) appear in certain localities to be very rich in well-preserved\r\nshells of fossil Polycystina. Most of these are aggregated together in\r\ncoprolites and quartzites (jasper, chert, flint, &c., § 248). The majority\r\nare #Cyrtoidea#, the minority #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea# in almost equal\r\nproportions; a few #Beloidea# (_Sphærozoum_) and #Phæocystina# (Dictyocha)\r\nare also found among them. The general morphological character of these\r\nJurassic Radiolaria is very different from that of the nearly related\r\nTertiary and living forms. In general, their siliceous shells are firmer\r\nand more massive, usually also somewhat larger, but of simpler structure.\r\nThe manifold delicate appendages (spines, bristles, feet, wings, &c.) which\r\nare so richly developed in the living SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and are\r\nalso well shown in the Tertiary species, are entirely wanting in the\r\nmajority of the Jurassic Polycystina. The #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea# are\r\nall simple spherical or ellipsoidal lattice-shells (Monosphærida);\r\nconcentric lattice-shells (Polysphærida) are entirely wanting. The\r\n#Cyrtoidea# are, for the most part, devoid of radial processes or basal\r\nfeet (Eradiata); triradiate and multiradiate forms, such as are found\r\nabundantly in the recent and Tertiary formations, are very rare. The large\r\nnumber of many-jointed forms (Stichocyrtida) and of #Cyrtoidea# with\r\nlatticed basal opening is very striking.\r\n\r\n  A. The most important work on the Jurassic Radiolaria, regarding which\r\n  but little was known prior to the year 1885, is the valuable and in some\r\n  respects very interesting Beiträge zur Kenntniss der fossilen Radiolarien\r\n  aus Gesteinen des Jura, by Dr. Rüst of Freiburg i. B. (1885,\r\n  Palæontographica, Bd. xxxi. 51 pp. with 12 plates). Unfortunately this\r\n  important work was issued only when about half of the present Report was\r\n  printed off, so that it was no longer possible to include the 234 species\r\n  there described in its systematic part. I have therefore elsewhere given\r\n  a list of the Jurassic Radiolaria, and at present only make the following\r\n  remarks:--Of the 234 species described, the larger half (130) belong to\r\n  the NASSELLARIA (#Cyrtoidea#), the smaller half (102) to the SPUMELLARIA\r\n  (38 #Sphæroidea#, 14 #Prunoidea#, and 50 #Discoidea#). In addition, there\r\n  are 2 PHÆODARIA depicted, and several spicules which are probably to be\r\n  referred to the #Beloidea#. Among the 130 #Cyrtoidea# (of which 2 are\r\n  described as #Botryodea#), there are 24 Monocyrtida, 14 Dicyrtida, 22\r\n  Tricyrtida, and 70 Stichocyrtida. Just as striking as the predominant\r\n  number of the last is the fact that there are only very few triradiate\r\n  (9) and multiradiate (4) species found among these 130 #Cyrtoidea#, as\r\n  also the large number of species with latticed basal opening;\r\n  #Stephoidea# appear to be entirely wanting. The rich material of jasper,\r\n  chert, flint, and coprolites in which Dr. Rüst found these Radiolaria, is\r\n  derived for the most part from the Jurassic rocks of Germany (Hanover,\r\n  South Bavaria), Tyrol, and Switzerland (compare § 248).\r\n\r\n  {clxviii}B. Jurassic Radiolaria from Italy, also found in jasper, which\r\n  are closely related to the forms from Germany and Switzerland described\r\n  by Dr. Rüst, were made known so long ago as 1880 by Dante Pantanelli in\r\n  his treatise I Diaspri della Toscana e i loro Fossili (Rome, 1880, 33 pp.\r\n  60 figs.). Pantanelli believes, however, that this jasper is for the most\r\n  part of Eocene origin; but from his description, and especially from the\r\n  morphological character of the forms which he figures, it appears very\r\n  probable \"that these Tuscan jaspers from Galestro, like those of the\r\n  Swiss conglomerates, are found in a secondary locality and belong to the\r\n  Jurassic period\" (Rüst, L. N. 51, p. 3). Unfortunately the figures of\r\n  Pantanelli are so small and incomplete that a reliable determination of\r\n  the species is hardly possible; for example, the lattice-work is only\r\n  given in ten of the sixty figures. Among the 32 recorded species 15 are\r\n  SPUMELLARIA (6 #Sphæroidea# and 9 #Discoidea#) and 17 NASSELLARIA (4\r\n  #Stephoidea# and 13 #Cyrtoidea#); many of which seem to be identical with\r\n  the forms more accurately described by Dr. Rüst (compare p. 1762).\r\n\r\n  C. From the Lias of the Alps and more particularly \"from the lower\r\n  Liassic beds of the Schafberg near Salzburg,\" Dr. Emil von Dunikowski in\r\n  1882 described 18 species of fossil Radiolaria (L. N. 44, pp. 22-34, Taf.\r\n  iv.-vi.); most of these are #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea# and appear to\r\n  have been more or less altered by petrological changes; their spongy\r\n  structure is probably secondary.\r\n\r\n  D. Cretaceous Radiolaria have been hitherto described only in very small\r\n  numbers; quite recently Dr. Rüst has found a larger number chiefly in\r\n  flints from the English chalk, but they have not yet been published. In\r\n  1876 Zittel described 6 very well-preserved species from the upper chalk\r\n  of North Germany (L. N. 29, pp. 76-96, Taf. ii.); among them were 1\r\n  #Sphæroidea#, 1 #Discoidea#, 1 Dictyocha, and 3 #Cyrtoidea#.\r\n\r\n  E. Triassic Radiolaria have recently been discovered by Dr. Rüst in\r\n  chert, but have not yet been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n244. _Palæozoic Radiolaria._--The number of Radiolaria which are known from\r\nthe Palæozoic or Primary formations is much less than from either the\r\nMesozoic or Cainozoic periods. Here, however, the investigations of recent\r\ntimes have yielded important information; a few species, at all events, of\r\nPolycystina (mostly #Sphæroidea#) are now known from various Palæozoic\r\nformations, and not only from the Permian (\"Zechstein\") and the\r\nCoal-measures, but also from the older Devonian and Silurian systems. Even\r\nin the still older Cambrian rocks a few fossil Radiolaria have been found.\r\nAll these Palæozoic Radiolaria are Polycystina of very simple form and\r\nprimitive structure, mostly simple SPUMELLARIA (latticed spheres,\r\nellipsoids, lenses, &c.), but partly also simple NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  The important discoveries which have recently been made by Dr. Rüst\r\n  regarding the occurrence of Radiolaria in all the Palæozoic formations\r\n  have not yet been published. From conversations with this estimable\r\n  palæontologist I have learned, however, that he has pursued his fruitful\r\n  investigation of the Mesozoic quartzites (§ 243), and has met with no\r\n  less success in the case of similar Palæozoic structures. Although the\r\n  number of species hitherto discovered is relatively small, the important\r\n  conclusion appears to be warranted that they extend as far as the\r\n  Silurian and Cambrian systems. All these very ancient SPUMELLARIA\r\n  (#Sphæroidea#) and NASSELLARIA (#Cyrtoidea#) {clxix}exhibit very\r\n  primitive structural relations. The occurrence of fossil Polycystina in\r\n  the Carboniferous formation of England has been incidentally mentioned by\r\n  W. J. Sollas:--\"In the carboniferous beds of North Wales pseudomorphs of\r\n  Radiolaria in calcite occur, along with minute quartz crystals\" (Ann. and\r\n  Mag. Nat. Hist., 1880, ser. 5, vol. vi. p. 439); and in the siliceous\r\n  slate-beds of Saxony Rothpletz has shown the existence of a few\r\n  #Sphæroidea# (Zeitschr. d. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch., 1800, p. 447).\r\n\r\n\r\n245. _Abundance of Radiolaria in the Various Rocks._--The relative quantity\r\nof well-preserved or at all events recognisable Radiolaria in the different\r\nrocks is very variable. In this respect three different degrees may be\r\ndistinguished, which may be called shortly \"pure, mixed, and poor\"\r\nRadiolarian formations. The _pure_ Radiolarian rocks consist for the\r\ngreater part (usually much more than half, sometimes even more than\r\nthree-quarters) of closely compacted often calcined masses of siliceous\r\nPolycystine shells. To this category belong the pure Miocene Polycystine\r\nmarls of Barbados (§ 246), the Tertiary Polycystine clay of the Nicobar\r\nIslands (§ 247), and the Polycystine quartz of the Jura (§ 248). All these\r\npure Radiolarian rocks may be regarded as fossil Radiolarian ooze (§ 237),\r\nand are certainly of deep-sea origin, having probably been deposited at\r\ndepths greater than 2000 fathoms. Their palæontological character also is\r\nin favour of this view, for the abyssal Osculosa (§ 235) are more abundant\r\nand richer in species than the pelagic Porulosa (§ 233). The elevation of\r\nthis deep-sea layer above the surface of the sea appears to have taken\r\nplace but seldom; it has only been observed on a large scale at Barbados\r\nand in the Nicobar Islands. The _mixed_ Radiolarian rocks are much more\r\ncommon; they were probably deposited at much less depths, or perhaps are\r\nnot true deep-sea formations at all. The siliceous shells of Polycystina\r\nalways constitute less than half (sometimes less than one-tenth) of their\r\nmass, and are less prominent than other siliceous remains (Diatoms), or\r\ncalcareous remains (Foraminifera), or in some cases than the mineral\r\nconstituents (pumice, &c.). To this group belong many of the\r\nabove-mentioned Tertiary marls and clays (especially the Mediterranean\r\nTripoli), also many flints, cherts, and other quartzites from Mesozoic\r\nstrata (especially from the Jura), and probably also some palæozoic\r\nquartzites. The marine ooze from which they have originated may have been\r\ndeposited at very various, even at slight, depths of the ocean. Formations\r\n_poor_ in Radiolaria, which contain only a few species of SPUMELLARIA and\r\nNASSELLARIA mingled with other fossil remains and mineral particles, occur\r\nin all formations and are probably very widely distributed. Further careful\r\nexamination of thin sections (especially of coprolites) will yield here a\r\nrich harvest of new forms. Both the mixed and the pure Radiolarian\r\nformations may be divided according to their petrographic characters into\r\nthree groups, which, however, are connected by intermediate varieties--(1)\r\nsoft, chalky marl (§ 246), (2) plastic clay (§ 247), and (3) hard, flinty\r\nquartz (§ 248).\r\n\r\n\r\n{clxx}246. _Radiolarian Marl._--Those soft, friable rocks, which contain a\r\nlarge quantity of calcareous matter, but consist for the most part of the\r\nshells of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, are called Radiolarian or\r\nPolycystine marl, often more correctly Polycystine tripoli; the best known\r\nexample of them is the chalky marl of Barbados in the Antilles (§ 242). The\r\nTertiary mountain system of this island, which in Mount Hillaby rises to a\r\nheight of 1147 feet and includes about 15,800 acres, consists almost\r\nexclusively of these remarkable masses of rock. Most of it appears as a\r\nsoft, earthy, often chalky marl, with a considerable but variable amount of\r\ncalcareous matter. Those specimens, the greater half of which is composed\r\nof well-preserved siliceous shells of Polycystina, and which contain little\r\nlime, approach the tripoli and \"Kieselguhr.\" Those specimens, however,\r\nwhich contain the largest amount of calcareous matter resemble common\r\nwriting chalk in consistency, and consist for the most part of shells of\r\nForaminifera and their fragments; of these there are only few species but\r\nlarge numbers of individuals, generally in small fragments with a fine\r\ncalcareous powder between them. They may be regarded as fossil Globigerina\r\nooze (§ 238). In a third group of specimens from Barbados the quantity of\r\nfragments of pumice and other volcanic matters predominates; the amount of\r\nclay is also very considerable; these deposits pass over partly into actual\r\nclay partly into volcanic tuff. A fourth group exhibits relations to a\r\ncoarser often ferruginous material, and although the shells of Polycystina\r\nare less abundant in it, still it may be shown to be composed largely of\r\nfragments and metamorphosed remains of them. The colour of this deposit,\r\nwhich in some places passes over into sandstone, in others into clay, is\r\nusually rather dark, grey, brown, sometimes red and occasionally black\r\n(bituminous). The Radiolarian marls of the first two groups, which\r\nsometimes approach the white chalk, sometimes the Kieselguhr, are grey, or\r\neven pure white (see note A). The same constitution is exhibited by the\r\nyellowish or white, very light and friable Polycystine marls of Sicily,\r\nwhich in Caltanisetta approach the chalk, and in Grotte the Kieselguhr. In\r\nGreece (Ægina, Zante, &c.), on the other hand, they pass over into plastic\r\nclay, and the same occurs in the Baden marl of the Vienna basin. In North\r\nAfrica, however, on the Mediterranean shores of which the Radiolarian marl\r\nseems to be very widely distributed (from Tripoli to Oran), it sometimes\r\nbecomes changed into actual firm polishing slate, sometimes into\r\npulverulent Kieselguhr or tripoli (Terra tripolitana, see note B). Most of\r\nthese Radiolarian marls appear to date from the middle Tertiary (Miocene)\r\nperiod, and to be deep-sea formations.\r\n\r\n  A. The Polycystine marl of Barbados appears at different parts of the\r\n  island to present greater variations in its petrographical and\r\n  zoographical composition than would appear from Ehrenberg's description\r\n  (1875, L. N. 25, pp. 106-116). Through the kindness of one of my former\r\n  students, Dr. Dorner, to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my\r\n  thanks for the favour, I received a large number of specimens of Barbados\r\n  rock, taken from various parts of the island, and they exhibit very great\r\n  variations in their external appearance, their chemical composition, and\r\n  the {clxxi}Radiolaria which they contain. The white specimens resembling\r\n  Kieselguhr contained approximately 60 to 70 per cent. by volume of\r\n  Radiolarian shells, the yellowish marl 40 to 50 per cent., and the brown\r\n  and black (bituminous) marl 10 to 20 per cent. or less. Two analyses of\r\n  the first, which my friend Dr. W. Weber was good enough to carry out,\r\n  yielded different results from those which are given by Ehrenberg on the\r\n  basis of Rammelsberg's analyses (L. N. 25, p. 116). The results of both\r\n  are here given for comparison.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------\r\n       Ehrenberg-Rammelsberg      |         Weber I.         |  Weber II.\r\n      (Fragment from Hillaby).    |  (Chalk-like Fragment).  |(Tripoli-like\r\n                                  |                          |  Fragment).\r\n  --------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------\r\n  Silicate of alumina,      59.47 |Silica,              52.2 |        71.3\r\n  Alumina and oxide of iron, 1.95 |Alumina (with traces      |\r\n  Calcium carbonate,        34.31 |  of oxide of iron), 12.3 |        11.2\r\n  Water,                     3.67 |Lime and magnesia,   31.9 |        14.8\r\n                                  |Carbon dioxide,       3.2 |         2.7\r\n                           ______ |                    _____ |       _____\r\n        Total,              99.40 |      Total,         99.6 |       100.0\r\n  --------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------\r\n\r\n  For further comparison I here add the three different analyses of Miocene\r\n  Tripoli-marls from Sicily, given by Stöhr on the authority of Fremy,\r\n  Schwager, and Mottura (Tagebl. d. fünfzigsten Versamml.

The Radiolarian marl of the Mediterranean appears, judging by the\r\n  accounts already published, to stretch along a considerable part of the\r\n  coast in the earlier and middle Tertiary formations; thus it occurs of\r\n  similar composition in widely separated localities, in Sicily, Calabria,\r\n  Zante, and Greece; in North Africa from Tripoli to Oran and probably much\r\n  farther. So long ago as 1854 Ehrenberg, in his Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6)\r\n  gave a series of important, even if incomplete, communications regarding\r\n  the \"chalky white calcareous marl of Caltanisetta\" (Taf. xxii.), the\r\n  \"Platten marl of Zante\" (Taf. xx.), the \"plastic clay of Ægina\" (Taf\r\n  xix.), and the \"polishing slate of Oran\" (Taf. xxi.). In 1880 Stöhr\r\n  showed in his fundamental description of the Tripoli from {clxxii}Grotte\r\n  in Sicily (L. N. 35) that its Radiolarian fauna is much richer than\r\n  Ehrenberg supposed. The same is the case in the Tripoli of Caltanisetta,\r\n  and also in the Baden marl of the Vienna basin. The richest deposit\r\n  appears to be the pure Kieselguhr-like Tripoli from Oran; a small\r\n  specimen, which was recently sent to me by Professor Steinmann of\r\n  Freiburg, i. B., contained many hitherto undescribed species, and was at\r\n  least as rich as the purest Barbados marl.\r\n\r\n\r\n247. _Radiolarian Clays._--Among the Radiolarian or Polycystine clays we\r\ninclude the firm, often plastic, formations, which contain a larger\r\nproportion of Radiolaria than of other organic remains. The first of these\r\nto be mentioned is the Cainozoic formation of the Nicobar Islands in\r\nFurther India, which rises to a height of 2000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, and consists for the most part of coloured masses of clay of varying\r\nconstitution; on Car Nicobar these are mostly grey or reddish, on the\r\nIsland of Camorta they are partly strongly ferruginous and red and yellow\r\n(_e.g._ at Frederickshaven), partly white and light, like meerschaum\r\n(_e.g._ at Mongkata). The latter varieties appear to pass over into pure\r\nloose Polycystine marl like that of Barbados, the former into calcareous\r\nsandstone. Although the Polycystine clays of the Nicobar Islands are as yet\r\nonly very incompletely known, it may be concluded with great probability\r\nthat they are true deep-sea formations and nearly allied to those recent\r\nforms of red clay, which by their abundance in Radiolaria most nearly\r\napproach the Radiolarian ooze, such for example as the red clay of the\r\nNorth Pacific between Japan and the Sandwich Islands (Stations 241 to 245,\r\ncompare §§ 229 and 239). With this view agrees also the greater or less\r\nquantity of pumice dust and other volcanic products. Probably Radiolarian\r\nclays like those of the Nicobar Islands occur also in other Tertiary rocks;\r\npart of the Barbados marl passes by gradually increasing content of clay\r\ninto such; and in this case also the amount of included pumice is often\r\nconsiderable. Many mixed Radiolarian marls of the Mediterranean (_e.g._, of\r\nGreece and Oran) also appear to pass over at certain points into\r\nRadiolarian clay.\r\n\r\n  The Radiolarian clays of the Nicobar Islands are unfortunately very\r\n  incompletely known both as regards their geological nature and their\r\n  palæontological composition. The communications of Rink (Die\r\n  Nikobaren-Inseln, eine geographische Skizze, Kopenhagen, 1847) and of\r\n  Ehrenberg (L. N. 6, p. 160 and L. N. 25, pp. 116 to 120) leave many\r\n  important questions unanswered. The latter has only figured twenty-three\r\n  species in his Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6, Taf. xxxvi.). In his tabular list\r\n  of names (L. N. 25, p. 120) he only incompletely records thirty-nine\r\n  species, although in 1850, immediately after the first examination of the\r\n  Nicobar clay, he had distinguished \"more than a hundred species, partly\r\n  new, partly identical with those of Barbados\" (L. N. 16, p. 8). I have\r\n  unfortunately been unable in spite of many efforts, to obtain for\r\n  investigation a specimen of Nicobar clay. The only microscopical\r\n  preparation (from Ehrenberg's collection), which I was able to examine,\r\n  contained several hitherto undescribed species. A thorough systematic\r\n  examination of these important Radiolarian clays is a pressing necessity,\r\n  especially as they seem to be markedly different from those of the\r\n  Mediterranean (from Ægina, Zante, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n{clxxiii}248. _Radiolarian Quartzes._--Under the name Radiolarian or\r\nPolycystine quartzes are included those hard, siliceous rocks, which\r\nconsist for the most part of the closely compacted shells of SPUMELLARIA\r\nand NASSELLARIA. To these \"cryptocrystalline quartzes,\" or better,\r\nquartzites, belong more especially the pure Radiolarian formations of the\r\nJura, which have been described as flint, chert, jasper, as well as other\r\ncryptocrystalline quartzites. Most of the rocks of this nature hitherto\r\nexamined are from Germany (Hanover, South Bavaria), Hungary, Tyrol, and\r\nSwitzerland; others are known from Italy (Tuscany). They occur both in the\r\nupper and middle, but especially in the lower Jurassic formation (also in\r\nthe lower layers of the Alpine Lias). A small part of them has been\r\nexamined in their primary situation (the red jaspers of Allgäu and Tyrol),\r\nthe greater part, however, only as loose rolled stones in secondary\r\nsituations (thus in Switzerland in the breccia of the Rigi, in the\r\nconglomerate of the Uetli-Berg, and in many boulders of the Rhine, the\r\nLimmat, the Reuss, and the Aar). The greatest abundance, however, of\r\nJurassic Radiolaria has been yielded by the silicified coprolites from the\r\nLias of Hanover. These \"Radiolarian coprolites\" are roundish or cylindrical\r\nbodies, which may attain the size of a goose-egg; they probably originated\r\nfrom Fish or Cephalopods, which had fed upon Crustacea, Pteropoda, and\r\nsimilar pelagic organisms, whose stomachs were already full of Radiolarian\r\nskeletons. Next to the coprolites the richest is the red jasper, whose\r\ncolour varies from bright to dark red; it constitutes a true \"silicified\r\ndeep-sea Radiolarian ooze.\" The \"_Aptychus_ beds\" also of South Bavaria and\r\nTyrol are very rich, and have furnished about one-third of all the\r\nRadiolaria known from the Jura; most of the species too are very well\r\npreserved (compare § 243).\r\n\r\n  Regarding the remarkable composition and manifold varieties of the\r\n  Jurassic Radiolarian quartz, the very full treatise of Dr. Rüst may be\r\n  consulted (L. N. 51). The very interesting Radiolarian coprolites, which\r\n  that author has discovered in the lower and middle Jura of Hanover, occur\r\n  in astonishing numbers in the iron mines at the village of Gross-Ilsede,\r\n  four and a half miles south of the town of Peine. They constitute from 2\r\n  to 5 per cent. by weight of the Liassic iron ore; of this latter, in the\r\n  year 1883 alone, not less than two hundred and eighty million kilograms\r\n  were excavated. It is very probable that the careful microscopic\r\n  examination of thin sections of coprolites, as well as of flints, chert,\r\n  jasper, and other quartzites, would yield a rich harvest of fossil\r\n  Radiolaria in other formations also. In Italy Dante Pantanelli has\r\n  discovered interesting Polycystine jaspers in Tuscany (L. N. 36, 45);\r\n  these also appear to occur in the Jura (compare § 243, and L. N. 51, pp.\r\n  3-10).\r\n\r\n\r\n249. _Fossil Groups._--The preservation of Radiolaria in the fossil state\r\nis, of course, primarily dependent on the composition of their skeleton.\r\nHence the ACANTHARIA, whose acanthin skeleton although firm is readily\r\nsoluble, are never found fossil. The same is true of the skeletons of the\r\nPHÆODARIA, which consist of a silicate of carbon; here, however, a single\r\nexception is found in the Dictyochida, a subfamily of the Cannorrhaphida,\r\nthe isolated parts of whose skeletons appear to consist of pure silica, and\r\n{clxxiv}are often found fossil. Of the two other legions those families\r\nwhich possess no skeleton are of course excluded; the Nassellida among the\r\nNASSELLARIA, and the Thalassicollida and Collozoida among the SPUMELLARIA.\r\nThus of the 85 known families there remain scarcely 55 of which the\r\nskeletons may be expected in the fossil state; and of these scarcely half\r\nhave been actually observed in this condition. Of the 20 orders of this\r\nclass enumerated in § 155, the following 9 may be, for palæontological and\r\ngeological purposes, completely excluded:--(A) The 4 orders of ACANTHARIA\r\n(1, #Actinelida#; 2, #Acanthonida#; 3, #Sphærophracta#; 4, #Prunophracta#);\r\n(B) 3 orders of PHÆODARIA (5, #Phæosphæria#; 6, #Phæogromia#; 7,\r\n#Phæoconchia#); (C) 1 order of NASSELLARIA (8, #Nassoidea#); (D) 1 order of\r\nSPUMELLARIA (9, #Colloidea#). From a geological point of view the following\r\n6 orders, although occasionally found fossil, are of quite subordinate\r\nimportance:--(A) Among the SPUMELLARIA (10, #Beloidea#, and 11,\r\n#Larcoidea#); (B) among the NASSELLARIA (12, #Plectoidea#; 13,\r\n#Stephoidea#; 14, #Botryodea#); (C) among the PHÆODARIA (15, the\r\n#Phæocystina#). On the other hand the following 5 orders, which are the\r\nmain constituents of Radiolarian rocks, are of pre-eminent geological\r\nimportance:--(A) Among the SPUMELLARIA (16, #Sphæroidea#; 17, #Prunoidea#;\r\n18, #Discoidea#); (B) among the NASSELLARIA (19, #Spyroidea#, and 20,\r\n#Cyrtoidea#). The numerical relation in which the different families of\r\nthese orders appear in the Radiolarian formations may be seen on consulting\r\n§ 157.\r\n\r\n\r\n250. _Fossil and Recent Species._--The fact that there are many Radiolaria\r\nliving at the present day, whose shells are found fossil in Tertiary rocks,\r\nis of great phylogenetic and geological significance. This appeared to be\r\nthe case even from the older observations upon the Polycystina of the\r\nBarbados marl (see note A), but more recent and extensive observations both\r\nupon these and upon the Miocene Radiolaria of Sicily, have shown that the\r\nnumber of these \"living fossil\" forms is much greater than was previously\r\nsupposed (see note B). Among the Miocene Radiolaria numerous species, both\r\nof SPUMELLARIA (especially #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea#) and of NASSELLARIA\r\n(especially #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#) are not to be distinguished from\r\nthe corresponding still living forms (see notes C, D). On the other hand,\r\nthose genera, which are rich both in species and individuals (recent as\r\nwell as fossil), present continuous series of forms which lead gradually\r\nand uninterruptedly from old Tertiary species to others still living, which\r\nare specifically indistinguishable from them. These interesting\r\nmorphological facts are capable of direct phylogenetic application, and\r\nfurnish valuable proofs of the truth of the theory of descent.\r\n\r\n  A. Ehrenberg, in his list of fossil Polycystina (L. N. 25, pp. 64-85,\r\n  1875), records 325 species of which 26 are still living.\r\n\r\n  {clxxv}B. Stöhr, in his list of Miocene Radiolaria from Grotte (L. N. 35,\r\n  p. 84, 1880), records 118 species, of which 29 are still living.\r\n\r\n  C. Teuscher, who at my request has made a large number of comparative\r\n  measurements and drawings, both of fossil and living Radiolaria, comes to\r\n  the conclusion that numerous SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA from Barbados\r\n  are to-day extant and unchanged in the Radiolarian ooze of the deep\r\n  Pacific Ocean (compare § 242A, and p. 1760, Note).\r\n\r\n  D. From the comparative investigations, which I have made during the last\r\n  ten years into the recent deep-sea Radiolaria of the Challenger\r\n  collection and the Miocene Polycystina of Barbados, it appears that about\r\n  a quarter of the latter are identical with living species of the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{clxxvi}BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.--LITERATURE AND HISTORY.\r\n\r\n251. _List of Publications from 1834 to 1884_:--\r\n\r\n    _Note._--In the text the references to the following publications are\r\n    indicated by the letters L.

A historical and critical\r\ndiscussion of the works which appeared within the first twenty-eight years\r\nof this period (from 1834 to 1862) is contained in the historical\r\nintroduction to my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 1-24); I shall therefore\r\ngive here only a brief survey of the investigations published during\r\nthe last twenty-three years (from 1862 to 1885). The most important\r\nsteps in our progress during this period we owe to the following\r\nnaturalists:--Cienkowski (1871), Ehrenberg (1872 and 1875), Richard Hertwig\r\n(1876 and 1879), Karl Brandt (1881 and 1885), Bütschli (1882), and Rüst\r\n(1885). To the valuable works of these authors must be added a number of\r\nsmaller contributions, which are recorded in the foregoing Bibliography.\r\nSome communications from dilettanti, written with insufficient knowledge of\r\nthe subject, and hence of no value, are mentioned for the sake of\r\ncompleteness in the \"Phaulographic Appendix\" (compare L. N. 55-60, also L.\r\nN. 26, p. 9).\r\n\r\nThe first important advance in our knowledge of the organisation of the\r\nRadiolaria, made after the publication of my Monograph (1862), was the\r\ndemonstration of the nature of the extracapsular \"yellow cells.\" In the\r\nyear 1870 I showed that these yellow cells contain starch (L. N. 21, p.\r\n519). I regarded them, as did all authors up to that time, as integral\r\nparts of the Radiolarian organism, and hence considered this to be\r\nmulticellular; for no doubt was possible regarding the true cellular nature\r\nof these remarkable, nucleated, yellow globules, which I had thoroughly\r\nstudied in 1862. It was first shown by Cienkowski in 1871 that the yellow\r\ncells of the #Collodaria# remain unchanged even after the death of these\r\norganisms, \"that they continue to grow uninterruptedly, and eventually\r\nmultiply by division\" (L. N. 22, pp. 378-380, Taf. xix. figs. 30-36).\r\nCienkowski concluded from these important observations that the yellow\r\ncells are not integral parts of the Radiolarian body, but \"parasitic\r\nstructures,\" independent, unicellular organisms, which live only as\r\nparasites in the body of the Radiolaria (compare § 90).\r\n\r\nThis important recognition underwent ten years later a further development\r\nand complete establishment by the extensive investigations of Karl Brandt\r\n(L. N. 38, 39) {clxxx}and Patrick Geddes (L. N. 42, 43). This arrangement\r\nwas compared by Brandt to the remarkable symbiosis of the Algoid gonidia\r\nand Fungoid hyphæ in the organisation of the Lichens, which had been\r\nrecently discovered, and since he recognised the independent nature of the\r\nyellow cells, as unicellular Algæ, in all divisions of the Radiolaria, he\r\nfounded for them the genus _Zooxanthella_. Geddes named them _Philozoon_,\r\nand showed experimentally that they give out oxygen under the influence of\r\nsunlight (compare § 90). The great physiological importance of the yellow\r\ncells in the metastasis of the Radiolaria, and, when they are developed in\r\nlarge quantities, in the economy of marine organisms in general, has\r\nrecently been insisted upon by Brandt (see § 205 and L. N. 52, pp. 65-71,\r\n86-94).\r\n\r\nThe proof that the yellow cells do not belong to the Radiolarian organism\r\nitself, but only live parasitically in it, was a necessary preliminary to\r\nthe very important step which next took place in our knowledge of the\r\norganisation of the Radiolaria. This step consisted in the demonstration\r\nthat the whole body of the Radiolaria, like that of all other Protista, is\r\nonly a single cell. It was Richard Hertwig who in two remarkable works (L.\r\nN. 26, 33) firmly established this fundamental theorem of the unicellular\r\nnature of the Radiolaria. In his treatise on the histology of the\r\nRadiolaria (L. N. 26, 1876) he published complete investigations into the\r\nstructure and development of the Sphærozoida and Thalassicollida. Since he\r\nmade use of the modern methods of histological examination, and especially\r\nof staining fluids, which he was the first to apply to the study of the\r\nRadiolaria, he was able to show that no true cells (apart from the\r\nparasitic yellow cells) are to be found in their bodies, but rather that\r\nall their morphological components are to be regarded as differentiated\r\nparts of a single true cell, and in particular that the central capsule\r\nincludes a genuine nucleus.\r\n\r\nA wider foundation for this important discovery and its applicability to\r\nall divisions of this extensive class, was given by Hertwig in a second\r\nwork on the organisation of the Radiolaria (L. N. 33, 1879). Among the\r\nnumerous discoveries by which this work enriched the natural history of the\r\nRadiolaria must be specially mentioned the recognition of the fundamental\r\ndifferences exhibited by the main divisions of the class in the structure\r\nof their central capsule. Hertwig first observed that the capsular membrane\r\nis double in the PHÆODARIA but single in the other Radiolaria (§ 56); the\r\nformer he named \"TRIPYLEA\" because he discovered in their capsular membrane\r\na large, peculiarly constructed main opening and two small accessory\r\nopenings. The NASSELLARIA, in which he found a single porous area at the\r\nbasal pole of the main axis, with a cone of pseudopodia rising from it, he\r\ncalled on this account \"MONOPYLEA\"; whilst the other Radiolaria, whose\r\ncapsular membrane is perforated on all sides with fine pores, were termed\r\n\"PERIPYLEA.\" Besides the central capsule, Hertwig laid stress upon the\r\nsignificance of the gelatinous envelope as a constant and important\r\nconstituent of the body. He also devoted attentive consideration to the\r\nmorphology of the skeleton, and on the basis of certain\r\n{clxxxi}phylogenetic conclusions which he drew from it, he arrived at an\r\nimproved systematic arrangement in which he distinguished six orders:--(1)\r\n#Thalassicollea#, (2) #Sphærozoea#, (3) #Peripylea#, (4) #Acanthometrea#,\r\n(5) #Monopylea#, (6) #Tripylea#. The numerous isolated discoveries with\r\nwhich Hertwig enriched the morphology of the Radiolaria, have been already\r\nalluded to in the appropriate paragraphs in the anatomical portion of this\r\nIntroduction (see L. N. 42, pp. 340, 341).\r\n\r\nThe new and interesting group, which was thus erected into an order under\r\nthe name TRIPYLEA, I had already a year previously separated from the other\r\nRadiolaria as \"_Pansolenia_\" in my Protistenreich (L. N. 32, p. 102).\r\nSince, however, neither the three capsular openings of the TRIPYLEA nor the\r\nskeletal tubes of the Pansolenia are present in all the families of this\r\nextensive order, I substituted in 1879 the more suitable name PHÆODARIA,\r\nwhich is applicable to all members of the group (L. N. 34). In the\r\npreliminary memoir then published regarding the Phæodaria, a New Group of\r\nSiliceous Marine Rhizopods, I distinguished four orders, ten families, and\r\nthirty-eight genera. The great majority of these new forms (among which\r\nwere no less than 465 different species) were first discovered by the\r\ndeep-sea investigations of the Challenger. John Murray was the first who\r\ncalled attention to the great abundance in the deep sea of these remarkable\r\nRhizopods, and to the constant presence of their peculiar, dark,\r\nextracapsular pigment body (phæodium); even in 1876 he described a portion\r\nof them as Challengerida (L. N. 27, p. 536; L. N. 53, p. 226). The earliest\r\nobservations on the PHÆODARIA were made at Messina in 1859, where I\r\nexamined five genera of this remarkable group alive (compare p. 1522 and L.\r\nN. 16).\r\n\r\nBy the discovery that the PHÆODARIA, although differing in important\r\nrespects from the other Radiolaria, still conform to the definition of the\r\nclass, a new and extensive series of forms was added to this latter, and by\r\ntheir closer investigation a fresh source of interesting morphological\r\nproblems was disclosed. In other groups, however, morphology was advanced\r\nby comparative anatomical studies. In addition to the smaller contributions\r\nof various authors, mentioned in the foregoing bibliography, I may\r\nspecially refer to the valuable Beiträge zur Kenntniss der\r\nRadiolarien-Skelete, insbesondere der der Cyrtida by O. Bütschli (L. N. 40,\r\n1882). On the basis of careful comparative anatomical studies,\r\ninvestigations into the skeletal structure of a number of fossil\r\n#Cyrtoidea# and critical application of the recently published researches\r\nof Ehrenberg into the Polycystina of Barbados (L. N. 25), Bütschli\r\nattempted to derive the complicated relations of the Monopylean skeletons\r\nphylogenetically from a simple primitive form,--the primary sagittal ring.\r\nEven if this attempt did not actually solve the very difficult\r\nmorphological problem in question, still the critical and synthetic mode in\r\nwhich it was carried out deserves full recognition, and furnishes the proof\r\nthat the comparative anatomy of the skeleton in the Radiolaria not less\r\nthan in the Vertebrata, is a most interesting and fruitful field of\r\nphylogenetic investigation. A {clxxxii}further demonstration of this was\r\nfurnished by Bütschli in the general account of the organisation of the\r\nRadiolaria which he published in 1882 in Bronn's Klassen und Ordnungen des\r\nThierreichs (L. N. 41).\r\n\r\nIn our knowledge of the developmental history of these Protista the last\r\ntwo decades have witnessed less progress than in their comparative anatomy.\r\nThe most important advance in this direction has been the proof that in all\r\nthe main groups of the class the contents of the central capsule are used\r\nin the formation of swarm-spores. The movements of these zoospores in the\r\ncentral capsule had indeed been observed by several previous authors in the\r\ncase of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA (L. N. 10, 13, 16; compare also §\r\n142, Note A). The origin of the flagellate spores from the contents of the\r\ncentral capsule and their peculiar constitution were, however, first\r\ndescribed fully by Cienkowski in 1871 (L. N. 22, p. 372). Soon after this,\r\nR. Hertwig discovered that in the social Radiolaria (Polycyttaria or\r\nSphærozoea) two different forms of zoospores are formed, one with, the\r\nother without crystals, and that the latter are also divided into\r\nmacrospores and microspores (compare L. N. 26, and § 142). Recently this\r\nsexual differentiation has been shown by Karl Brandt to exist in all the\r\ngroups of Sphærozoea, and its regular interchange with the formation of\r\ncrystal-spores has been interpreted as a true \"alternation of generations\"\r\n(compare L. N. 52 and also § 216). The other forms of development also,\r\nespecially reproduction by cell-division (§ 213) and gemmation (§ 214),\r\nhave been elucidated by the recent investigations of the same author.\r\n\r\nThe palæontology of the Radiolaria has of late made important and\r\ninteresting advances. Until ten years ago fossil remains of this class were\r\nknown exclusively from the Tertiary period; almost the only source of our\r\ninformation was to be found in the researches of Ehrenberg, commenced in\r\n1838, continued in his Mikrogeologie in 1854, and concluded in his last\r\nwork (L. N. 25) published in 1875 (compare L. N. 16, pp. 3-9, 191-193). In\r\nthe year 1876 a number of Mesozoic Radiolaria from the chalk were described\r\nby Zittel (L. N. 28), and afterwards others from the Jura by Dunikowski (L.\r\nN. 44). That fossil Radiolaria occur in Mesozoic formations, especially in\r\nthe Jura, as well preserved and as abundantly as in the Tertiary rocks of\r\nBarbados, was shown in 1883 by Rüst (L. N. 48). By the examination of\r\nnumerous thin sections he discovered that in all the main divisions of the\r\nJurassic formation (Lias, Dogger, Malm) there are distributed jaspers,\r\nflints, cherts, and other quartzites, which consist largely of the\r\nsiliceous shells of Polycystina; the same is true also of many Coprolites\r\nfound in the Jura. The full account of these and the descriptions and\r\nfigures of 234 Jurassic species, distributed in 76 genera, are contained in\r\nthe Beiträge zur Kenntniss der fossilen Radiolarien aus Gesteinen des Jura\r\n(L. N. 51, 1885). But even in the older rocks, the Trias, the Permian, and\r\nCarboniferous systems, and even as far downwards as the Silurian and\r\nCambrian formations, Rüst has recently shown the existence of fossil\r\nRadiolaria, {clxxxiii}and thus increased the known period of the\r\ndevelopmental history of the class by many millions of years (§ 244).\r\n\r\nThe great significance of the Radiolaria in geology and palæontology has\r\nbeen brought into new light not only by these extensive discoveries, but\r\nalso by the important relations which have been shown to exist between the\r\nRadiolarian rocks and the deep-sea deposits of the present day. In this\r\ndirection the wonderful discoveries of the Challenger, and especially the\r\ninvestigation of the deep-sea deposits by Wyville Thomson (L. N. 31) and\r\nJohn Murray (L. N. 27), have furnished us with new and valuable information\r\n(compare §§ 236-239, and §§ 245-250). The Tertiary Polycystine formations\r\nof Barbados and the Nicobar Islands, with which we have been acquainted for\r\nthe last forty years, as also the Mesozoic Radiolarian quartzes, which have\r\nonly recently been made known to us from the Jura, are ascertained to be\r\nfossil representatives of the same deep-sea deposits which now occur in the\r\nform of Radiolarian ooze (§ 237), and to some extent also of Globigerina\r\nooze and red clay (§§ 238, 239), on the bottom of the ocean, at depths of\r\nfrom 2000 to 4500 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThese investigations into fossil Radiolaria and their comparison with\r\nrecent deep-sea forms have a further general significance, inasmuch as the\r\nidentity of many living and fossil species from the Tertiary formation has\r\nbeen shown beyond all doubt. In this direction the numerous measurements\r\nand accurate comparisons which I have made during the last ten years of the\r\nabyssal forms in the Challenger collection, and of fossil species from\r\nBarbados and Caltanisetta, have brought to light many important facts. In\r\nthis I had the able assistance of my friend, Dr. Reinhold Teuscher (compare\r\n§ 250, and p. 1760). Further valuable contributions in this direction are\r\nfound in the careful observations and comparative measurements recently\r\npublished by Emil Stöhr (L. N. 35, 1880), regarding the Radiolarian fauna\r\nof the Tripoli of Grotte in the province of Girgenti, Sicily. From these it\r\nappears that the number of Miocene species which are still extant, is much\r\ngreater than would appear from the results of Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg himself, towards the end of his long and laborious life,\r\ncollected the results of the systematic and palæontological researches,\r\nwhich he had begun thirty-seven years previously (L. N. 16, pp. 3-12) into\r\nthe Polycystina, in two large works (L. N. 24, 25). The first treatise (L.\r\nN. 24, 1872) contains the Mikrogeologische Studien über das Kleinste Leben\r\nder Meeres-Tiefgründe aller Zonen und dessen geologischen Einfluss, with a\r\nlist of 279 Polycystina observed by him from the deep-sea, as well as\r\nfigures of 127 species. The second work (L. N. 25, 1875) contains the\r\nFortsetzung der Mikrogeologischen Studien, mit specieller Rücksicht auf den\r\nPolycystinen-Mergel von Barbados; the list of fossil Polycystina observed\r\nby him includes 325 species, of which 26 are still extant; 282 of them are\r\nfigured on the thirty plates accompanying the memoir. By means of these\r\nnumerous figures, as well as by the appended systematic and chorological\r\ntables, Ehrenberg furnished a welcome {clxxxiv}supplement to the numerous\r\ncommunications regarding the Polycystina, which he had made to the Berlin\r\nAcademy since 1838, and which he had published in his Mikrogeologie in\r\n1854. It will always be the merit of this zealous and indefatigable\r\nmicroscopist that he first called attention to the great wealth of forms\r\nexisting in this class; he separated systematically about 500 species, and\r\npublished drawings of about 400; in addition to which he was the first to\r\nlay stress upon the great chorological and geological importance of the\r\nRadiolaria.\r\n\r\nWith these systematic and descriptive, chorological and palæontological\r\nworks, however, which relate exclusively to the Polycystina, the merits of\r\nthe famous naturalist of Berlin are exhausted as regards this class of\r\nanimals. Of the organisation of the Radiolaria, Gottfried Ehrenberg\r\nremained entirely ignorant up till his death in 1876. All that a number of\r\nfamous naturalists had observed during a quarter of a century as to the\r\nstructure and life-history of the Radiolaria, all the important discoveries\r\nof Huxley (1851), Johannes Müller (1858), Claparède (1858), Cienkowski\r\n(1871), and many others (L. N. 1-22), and all that I had published in my\r\nMonograph (1862) on the basis of three years' study of their anatomy and\r\nphysiology--all this Ehrenberg ignored, or rather, he regarded it all as\r\nworthless rubbish of science, as a chaos of devious errors, resting upon\r\nincomplete observations and false conclusions. His strange \"special\r\nconsiderations regarding the Polycystina\" (L. N. 24, pp. 339-346) and the\r\ngeneral \"concluding remarks\" (L. N. 25, pp. 146-147) leave no room for\r\ndoubt on this point. Ehrenberg indeed doubted to the last whether any\r\nobserver had seen living Radiolaria at all (L. N. 25, p. 108).\r\n\r\nThe invincible obstinacy with which Ehrenberg maintained his preconceived\r\nopinion of the high organisation of the Radiolaria, and entirely ignored\r\nthe contrary observations of other naturalists, is explained by the\r\nconsistency with which he held to the end the \"principle peculiar to\r\nhimself of the universally equal development of the animal kingdom\" (L. N.\r\n16, p. 7). From the complicated arrangement of their siliceous shells he\r\nconcluded that the animals inhabiting them must possess a structure\r\ncorrespondingly complex, and nearly related to that of the Echinodermata\r\n(Holothuria). Like all other animals the Radiolaria must possess systems of\r\norgans for locomotion, sensation, nutrition, circulation, and reproduction.\r\nWhilst Ehrenberg originally interpreted the Polycystina as siliceous\r\nInfusoria polygastrica, and regarded them as compound Arcellina, he\r\nafterwards classed them sometimes with the Echinodermata (Holothuria),\r\nsometimes with the Bryozoa, sometimes with the Oscillaria (see L. N. 41, p.\r\n336). Although a decided opponent of the cell-theory he called them\r\n\"multicellular animalcules\" (Polycystina), interpreting the pores of the\r\nsiliceous shell as cells. To-day the opposite term (Monocystina) might be\r\nadopted to express their unicellular organisation. It was a remarkable\r\nirony of fate that in the self-same year (1838) in which Schwann of Berlin\r\nmade by his foundation of the cell theory the greatest advance in the whole\r\n{clxxxv}of Biological Science, that Ehrenberg, all his life the most\r\nzealous opponent of that theory, published his great work on the Infusoria,\r\nand at the same time established the \"family of multicellular animalcules\r\nor Polycystina\" (L. N. 16, p. 4).\r\n\r\nThe \"short systematic survey of the genera of cellular animalcules\" given\r\nby Ehrenberg in 1875 (L. N. 25, p. 157), is only a new edition, increased\r\nby sixteen genera, of his first systematic arrangement of the Polycystina\r\nof 1847 (L. N. 4, p. 53). Since I have already given a full discussion of\r\nthis in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 214-219), I need only here remark that\r\na correct understanding of his very inadequate generic diagnoses is only\r\npossible by the aid of his figures. Relying upon these I have retained\r\nalmost all Ehrenberg's genera, although entirely new definitions of most of\r\nthem have been necessary.\r\n\r\nThe same is true also of the two orders which Ehrenberg distinguished in\r\nhis class of \"Zellenthierchen.\" The first order is constituted by his\r\n\"Netzkörbchen\" (Monodictya or NASSELLARIA) formerly known as \"Polycystina\r\nsolitaria\"; they include our #Cyrtoidea#, the greater part of Hertwig's\r\nMonopylea. Ehrenberg's second order is the \"Schaumsternchen\" (Polydictya or\r\nSPUMELLARIA), previously called \"Polycystina composita\"; they include the\r\nPeripylea of Hertwig, as well as the Spyridina (our #Spyroidea#), which\r\nbelong properly to the NASSELLARIA. Although Ehrenberg's statements\r\nregarding the organisation of both these orders were quite erroneous, and\r\nhis knowledge even of the structure of their shells very defective, I still\r\nthought it advisable to retain his names for the groups, since they\r\nconstituted his one successful effort in the systematic treatment of the\r\nRadiolaria (compare L. N. 41, p. 336).\r\n\r\nThe sketch of a systematic arrangement of the Radiolaria (L. N. 37), which\r\nI published in 1881 on the basis of the study of the Challenger Radiolaria,\r\nresembles, in respect of seven orders being distinguished, the new system\r\nwhich R. Hertwig founded in 1879, in consequence of the variations which he\r\ndiscovered in the structural relations of the central capsule (L. N. 33, p.\r\n133). It differs, however, inasmuch as his Sphærozoea (my Polycyttaria) are\r\nhere divided into two orders, Symbelaria (#Collosphærida#) and Syncollaria\r\n(#Sphærozoida#). In that sketch too I separated for the first time the two\r\nsubclasses Holotrypasta (Porulosa) and Merotrypasta (Osculosa). The fifteen\r\nfamilies established by Hertwig were then raised to twenty-four. The six\r\nhundred and thirty genera, which I then distinguished, are still for the\r\nmost part retained, some, however, in a restricted sense, or with amended\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\nThe differential characters of the orders and families of the Radiolaria,\r\ngiven in the Prodromus in 1881, were amended in a further communication\r\nwhich I gave in 1883 regarding the orders of the Radiolaria (L. N. 46, p.\r\n17). There I reduced the seven orders to four, the structural relations of\r\nthe central capsule being precisely the same in the Polycyttaria and\r\n#Collodaria# as in the #Peripylea#. The survey of the affinities of the\r\nclass was thus rendered much simpler and clearer, and the\r\n{clxxxvi}hypothetical genealogical tree, which I then published, has been\r\nstill further carried out in Chapter VI. of the present Introduction (see\r\n§§ 153-200).\r\n\r\n\r\n253. _General Survey of the Growth of our Systematic Acquaintance with the\r\nRadiolaria from 1834 to 1885._\r\n\r\n  1834. MEYEN (L. N. 1) describes 2 genera and species of\r\n  #Collodaria#:--_Sphærozoum fuscum_ and _Physematium atlanticum_.\r\n\r\n  1838. EHRENBERG (L. N. 2) founds the family Polycystina upon 3 fossil\r\n  genera (with 6 species):--_Lithocampe_, _Cornutella_, _Haliomma_.\r\n\r\n  1847. EHRENBERG (L. N. 4) publishes his preliminary communications\r\n  regarding the fossil Polycystina of Barbados and distinguishes 282\r\n  species, distributed in 44 genera and 7 families. In the tabular view of\r\n  the genera he distinguishes two orders:--I. #Solitaria#--(1)\r\n  Halicalyptrina, (2) Lithochytrina, (3) Eucyrtidina; and II.\r\n  #Composita#--(4) Spyridina, (5) Calodictya, (6) Haliommatina, (7)\r\n  Lithocyclidina (compare L. N. 16, pp. 214-219).\r\n\r\n  1851. HUXLEY (L. N. 5) gives the first accurate account of living\r\n  Radiolaria, and describes 2 species of the genus _Thalassicolla_\r\n  (_nucleata_ and _punctata_); under the latter are included 4 genera of\r\n  #Sphærozoea#:--_Collozoum_, _Sphærozoum_, _Collosphæra_, _Siphonosphæra_\r\n  (compare L. N. 16, pp. 12-14).\r\n\r\n  1854. EHRENBERG (L. N. 6) publishes in his Mikrogeologie, figures of\r\n  seventy-two species of fossil Polycystina (without descriptions).\r\n\r\n  1855. JOHANNES MÜLLER (L. N. 8, p. 248) describes the first\r\n  _Acanthometra_, and elucidates its affinity to Huxley's _Thalassicolla_\r\n  and Ehrenberg's Polycystina.\r\n\r\n  1858. JOHANNES MÜLLER (L. N. 12) establishes the new group Radiolaria as\r\n  a special order of the Rhizopoda, and includes in it the Thalassicolla,\r\n  Polycystina, and Acanthometra as closely related families. He opposes\r\n  these radiate Rhizopoda to the Polythalamia, and describes 50 species\r\n  observed by him living in the Mediterranean, these he arranges in 20\r\n  genera, of which 10 are new. The figures are contained in eleven plates\r\n  (see L. N. 16, pp. 22-24).\r\n\r\n  1858. CLAPARÈDE (L. N. 14) describes the first #Plectoidean#\r\n  (_Plagiacantha arachnoides_) and two species of _Acanthometra_, which he\r\n  had observed living in Norway (see L. N. 16, p. 18).\r\n\r\n  1860. EHRENBERG (L. N. 4) gives a short diagnosis of 22 new genera of\r\n  Polycystina, based on the investigation of numerous deep-sea species\r\n  brought up by Brooke from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The number of\r\n  his genera is thus increased to 66 (compare L. N. 16, pp. 10, 11).\r\n\r\n  1862. ERNST HAECKEL (L. N. 16) embraces in his Monograph of the\r\n  Radiolaria all the species hitherto known either by figures or\r\n  descriptions, and arranges them in 15 families and 113 genera; of which\r\n  latter 46 are new. The number of new species observed living amounts to\r\n  144. In a \"survey of the Radiolarian fauna of Messina\" (p. 565) he\r\n  records 72 genera and 169 species. Most of these are figured in the\r\n  accompanying atlas of thirty-five plates.\r\n\r\n  {clxxxvii}1862. BURY (L. N. 17) gives in an atlas of twenty-five plates,\r\n  photographed from drawings, the figures of numerous fossil Polycystina of\r\n  Barbados (without descriptions), of which many are new species overlooked\r\n  by Ehrenberg (compare § 242, above).\r\n\r\n  1872. EHRENBERG (L. N. 24) gives a list of names (without description) of\r\n  all the Polycystina observed by him from the bottom of the sea, 279\r\n  species, of which 127 are figured on twelve plates.\r\n\r\n  1875. EHRENBERG (L. N. 25) gives a list of names of all the fossil\r\n  Polycystina observed by him (from Barbados, the Nicobar Islands and\r\n  Sicily), 326 species, of which 282 are figured (compare § 242 above). In\r\n  a new \"Systematic Survey of the Genera\" the number of these is given as\r\n  63. The 7 families are the same as given in 1847 (see above), as also the\r\n  two orders (NASSELLARIA = Solitaria, SPUMELLARIA = Composita).\r\n\r\n  1876. ZITTEL (L. N. 29) describes the first fossil Radiolaria from the\r\n  chalk (6 species) and establishes the new Cyrtoid genus _Dictyomitra_.\r\n\r\n  1876. JOHN MURRAY (L. N. 27) establishes the new family Challengerida,\r\n  and figures 6 new generic types of PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n  1879. RICHARD HERTWIG (L. N. 33) first describes the fundamental\r\n  differences in the structure of the central capsule, and in accordance\r\n  with them divides the Radiolaria into six orders:--(1) Thalassicollea,\r\n  (2) Sphærozoea, (3) Peripylea, (4) Acanthometrea, (5) Monopylea, (6)\r\n  Tripylea (p. 133). These are subdivided into 18 families, and their\r\n  phylogenetic affinities discussed (p. 137). On the ten plates, several\r\n  new species from Messina are figured, among them the types of several new\r\n  genera (_Cystidium_, _Coelacantha_, _Echinosphæra_) (compare § 252).\r\n\r\n  1879. ERNST HAECKEL (L. N. 34) founds the order PHÆODARIA as a \"new group\r\n  of marine siliceous Rhizopods,\" and distinguishes in it 4 suborders, 10\r\n  families and 38 genera.\r\n\r\n  1880. EMIL STÖHR (L. N. 35) describes the Miocene \"Radiolarian fauna of\r\n  the tripoli from Grotte in Sicily,\" 118 species, of which 78 are new;\r\n  among them is the new genus _Ommatodiscus_, the type of a new family,\r\n  Ommatodiscida. The new species are figured on seven plates.\r\n\r\n  1880. DANTE PANTANELLI (L. N. 36) describes 30 species of fossil\r\n  Polycystina from the jaspers of Tuscany, which he regarded as Eocene, but\r\n  which were probably of Jurassic origin (compare § 243, note B, above).\r\n\r\n  1881. ERNST HAECKEL (L. N. 37) publishes a \"Sketch of a classification of\r\n  the Radiolaria on the basis of the study of the Challenger Collection,\"\r\n  and distinguishes in his \"conspectus ordinum\" (p. 421) 2 subclasses and 7\r\n  orders, and in the \"prodromus systematis Radiolarium\" (pp. 423-472) 24\r\n  families with 630 genera, among which are more than 2000 new species.\r\n\r\n  1882. BÜTSCHLI (L. N. 40) on the basis of studies of the fossil Monopylea\r\n  of Barbados, investigates the \"mutual relations of the Acanthodesmida,\r\n  Zygocyrtida and Cyrtida,\" and gives a critical revision of the genera of\r\n  these \"Cricoidea;\" a number of new species are described and figured\r\n  (Tafs. xxxii., xxxiii.), and some new genera of Stichocyrtida established\r\n  (_Lithostrobus_, _Lithomitra_, &c.).\r\n\r\n  1882. DUNIKOWSKI (L. N. 44) describes 18 new fossil Polycystina from the\r\n  lower lias of the Salzburg Alps, among them the types of 3 new genera\r\n  (_Ellipsoxiphus_, _Triactinosphæra_, and _Spongocyrtis_).\r\n\r\n  {clxxxviii}1883. ERNST HAECKEL (L.

This class is exclusively\r\nmarine, and has in general the characteristic organisation of the\r\nRhizopoda, with the development of numerous _pseudopodia_ from the surface\r\nof the cell; but it differs from all other Rhizopoda in the possession of a\r\npeculiar _membrane_, dividing the cell-body into two different parts; the\r\n_central capsule_ or the internal part with the _nucleus_, and the external\r\npart or _extracapsulum_ with the _calymma_; propagation by flagellated\r\nspores produced in the central capsule; the sarcode or the _protoplasm_ of\r\nboth parts communicates by fine _pores_, piercing the separating membrane,\r\nwhich is called the _capsule-membrane_.\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ or the inner part of the Radiolarian body is\r\nconstantly composed of three essential parts, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. _The Central Nucleus_ (a true cell-nucleus).\r\n\r\n  2. _The Intracapsular Sarcode_ (endosarc) or surrounding internal\r\n  protoplasm.\r\n\r\n  3. _The Capsule Membrane_ or enveloping porous membrane.\r\n\r\n{2}Besides these constant and essential elements, the central capsule\r\ncontains very commonly (but not constantly) some other enclosed structures,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  4. An internal or intracapsular skeleton.\r\n\r\n  5. Intracapsular vacuoles or alveoli.\r\n\r\n  6. Fat-granules or oil-globules.\r\n\r\n  7. Crystals of different composition.\r\n\r\n  8. Pigment-granules.\r\n\r\n_The Extracapsulum_, or the outer part of the Radiolarian body is also\r\nconstantly composed of three essential elements,--\r\n\r\n  1. _The Calymma_, or the thick extracapsular _jelly-veil_, completely\r\n  enveloping the whole central capsule.\r\n\r\n  2. _The Matrix_, or the maternal tissue of the external protoplasm,\r\n  enveloping immediately the capsule-membrane as a thin continuous layer of\r\n  _extracapsular sarcode_ (ectosarc).\r\n\r\n  3. _The Pseudopodia_, or the very numerous thread-like filaments of\r\n  protoplasm, which radiate from the matrix; whilst their inner part is\r\n  enclosed in the calymma, their outer part floats freely in the sea-water.\r\n\r\nBesides these three constant and essential elements, the extracapsulum\r\ncontains very commonly (but not constantly) some other enclosed structures,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  4. An external or extracapsular skeleton.\r\n\r\n  5. Extracapsular vacuoles or alveoli.\r\n\r\n  6. Fat-granules or oil-globules.\r\n\r\n  7. Pigment-granules or a peculiar large body of dark extracapsular\r\n  pigment, the \"phæodium.\"\r\n\r\n  8. \"Xanthellæ\" or \"zooxanthellæ,\" peculiar yellow cells, which contain\r\n  starch and are unicellular yellow Algæ, living as \"Symbiontes\" in true\r\n  Symbiosis with a great many Radiolaria.\r\n\r\n_The Nucleus_ of the Radiolaria is a large true simple cell-nucleus,\r\noriginally a solid spherical, roundish or longish body of nuclein. It is\r\nplaced either in the centre of the capsule (in most Peripylea) or\r\nexcentrically (in most other Radiolaria). Originally solid, the nucleus is\r\ncommonly differentiated later into an outer dense nuclear-membrane and an\r\ninner softer or fluid content; either with one single nucleolus or with a\r\nvariable number of nucleoli. Originally always simple, the nucleus becomes\r\nafterwards constantly divided into numerous small nuclei, each of which,\r\ntogether with a part of the surrounding {3}protoplasm, forms a\r\nvibratile-spore or \"flagellate-spore.\" This division in the Acantharia and\r\nin the social (or colonial) Peripylea begins very early, in all other\r\nRadiolaria much later, immediately before propagation.\r\n\r\n_The Endoplasm_ or \"endosarc,\" or \"intracapsular protoplasm\" or \"inner\r\nsarcode,\" in all Radiolaria originally fills that space within the capsule,\r\nwhich is not taken up by the nucleus. It seems to be employed mainly for\r\nthe purpose of propagation, becoming divided earlier or later into numerous\r\nsmall particles, each of which surrounds a small particle of the nucleus\r\nand forms together with it a flagellate-spore. Besides this the endoplasm\r\nof the Radiolaria seems to have a great significance for the nutrition,\r\nmainly for the interchange of materials. It becomes very often vacuolate or\r\nalveolate, filled with smaller or larger spherical drops of fluid; it\r\nproduces very commonly smaller fat-granules or larger oil-globules, and\r\nfurther pigment-granules of different colours, more rarely crystals and\r\nother peculiar enclosed parts.\r\n\r\n_The Membrane_ or \"capsule-membrane\" is the most typical and characteristic\r\npart of the body of a Radiolarian, sufficient of itself to separate this\r\nclass from all other Rhizopoda. At the same time, by its different shape it\r\npresents the best means for the systematic distinction of the four\r\nsubclasses or \"legions\" of the class. The membrane is composed of a special\r\norganic matter (probably nearly related to chitin) and combines density\r\nwith elasticity to a high degree. Observed with a high power of the\r\nmicroscope its margin (or section) appears commonly simple-edged, but often\r\nin larger forms distinctly double-edged.\r\n\r\nThe legion PHÆODARIA is distinguished by a double membrane (the thinner\r\ninner and thicker outer membranes being separated by an interval); in the\r\nthree other legions it is simple. The membrane completely separates the\r\nintracapsular from the extracapsular body, both communicating only by\r\ncertain pores or openings in the membrane. With reference to this important\r\ncommunication, the whole class can be divided into two subclasses,\r\nHolotrypasta and Merotrypasta: the HOLOTRYPASTA contain the Peripylea and\r\nActipylea, in which the membrane is pierced by innumerable very small\r\npores; the MEROTRYPASTA consist of the Monopylea and the Cannopylea, in\r\nwhich the membrane exhibits only one large main opening, distinguished in\r\nthe former by a peculiar \"porous area,\" in the latter by an \"osculum\" or a\r\nprolonged tubule.\r\n\r\n_The Calymma_ or \"jelly-veil\" is the most characteristic part of the\r\nextracapsular body in all Radiolaria; in the majority of the class it is\r\nthe most voluminous part of the whole body, being much more voluminous than\r\nall the other parts taken together. The calymma is a structureless, clear,\r\nand transparent jelly-envelope which always includes the whole central\r\ncapsule and often also the whole extracapsular skeleton. Owing to the high\r\ndegree of its consistence, this jelly-veil takes a very important part in\r\nthe formation of the extracapsular skeleton, furnishing the matrix for the\r\ndeposition of its tangential parts.\r\n\r\n{4}_The Matrix_ or the \"maternal tissue of the pseudopodia\" is formed in\r\nall Radiolaria by the thin layer of exoplasm or of extracapsular sarcode,\r\nwhich immediately envelops the central capsule and is itself enclosed by\r\nthe calymma. This continuous sarcode-cover of the capsule communicates by\r\nits pores or openings with the endoplasm or the intracapsular sarcode;\r\nwhilst from its outer surface arise the pseudopodia. The morphological\r\nsignification of the matrix is very small, but the physiological importance\r\nis very great, for it seems to be the chief organ of many vital functions.\r\n\r\n_The Pseudopodia_ or the very fine, long, thread-like filaments of exoplasm\r\narise in all Radiolaria in very great numbers from the surface of the\r\nmatrix, and exhibit in general the same characteristic shape as in the\r\nother Rhizopoda. Their inner or proximal part is enclosed within the\r\njelly-veil or calymma, whilst their outer or distal part floats freely in\r\nthe sea-water. Their special motions and modifications exhibit considerable\r\nvariations in different groups, their tendency to ramify, anastomose, and\r\nform networks being in some cases very small, in others very great. Also\r\nthe characteristic motion of granules in the pseudopodia is very different.\r\nIn general those most important exoplasmatic filaments serve as organs both\r\nfor the vegetative functions of nutrition, and for the animal functions of\r\nmotion and sensation.\r\n\r\n_The class_ Radiolaria can be divided according to its varying structure\r\ninto four different legions or subclasses, the characters of which are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PERIPYLEA OR SPUMELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by innumerable very\r\n  fine pores. Fundamental form originally homaxon or spherical. Skeleton\r\n  wanting or siliceous. No phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The\r\n  Peripylea comprise two orders:--\r\n\r\n  A.  COLLODARIA (without lattice-shell).\r\n  B.  SPHÆRELLARIA (with lattice-shell).\r\n\r\nII.  ACTIPYLEA OR ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by innumerable fine\r\n  pores. Fundamental form originally homaxon or spherical. Skeleton\r\n  acanthinic (not siliceous). No phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The\r\n  Actipylea consist of two orders:--\r\n\r\n  A.  ACANTHOMETRA (without complete lattice-shell).\r\n  B.  ACANTHOPHRACTA (with complete lattice-shell).\r\n\r\n\r\n{5}III. MONOPYLEA OR NASSELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by a porous-area, or\r\n  by one single large opening, divided into numerous very fine pores.\r\n  Fundamental form originally monaxon or egg-shaped. Skeleton siliceous. No\r\n  phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The Monopylea comprise two\r\n  orders:--\r\n\r\n  A.  PLECTELLARIA (without complete lattice-shell).\r\n  B.  CYRTELLARIA (with complete lattice-shell).\r\n\r\nIV. CANNOPYLEA OR PHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n  Membrane of the central capsule double, perforated by one simple\r\n  main-opening, prolonged into a tubulus, and besides this commonly by one\r\n  or two (rarely more) small accessory openings. Fundamental form\r\n  originally monaxon or egg-shaped. Skeleton siliceous. Constantly a\r\n  peculiar dark pigment-body or \"phæodium\" in the extracapsular calymma.\r\n  The Cannopylea comprise two orders:--\r\n\r\n  A.  PHÆOCYSTINA (without lattice-shell).\r\n  B.

Skeleton wanting or siliceous. Fundamental\r\nform originally spherical.\r\n\r\nThe legion SPUMELLARIA vel PERIPYLEA, in the extent here defined, was\r\nconstituted by me in 1883 in my paper on Die Ordnungen der Radiolarien.[2]\r\nI propose to retain for this legion either the name SPUMELLARIA of\r\nEhrenberg (1875) or PERIPYLEA of Hertwig (1879), although both groups have\r\nnot quite the same extension. We exclude from the SPUMELLARIA the Spyridina\r\n(united with them by Ehrenberg) and include the Collodaria. With the\r\nPeripylea of Hertwig we unite his Thalassicollea and Sphærozoea. To avoid\r\nany confusion it would perhaps be better to name this legion \"Peripylaria.\"\r\n\r\nThe SPUMELLARIA agree with the ACANTHARIA in the structure of the simple\r\ncapsule-membrane, which is perforated by numerous small pores (but devoid\r\nof the large main opening, which the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA possess),\r\nwhence we unite both the former as Holotrypasta, both the latter as\r\nMerotrypasta.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two legions of Holotrypasta is determined by the\r\nskeleton, which in the SPUMELLARIA is either siliceous or wanting, whilst\r\nin the Acantharia it consists of the peculiar organic substance, acanthin.\r\n\r\nThe legion SPUMELLARIA is by far the largest and most important of the four\r\nlegions of Radiolaria, as well with respect to the number of different\r\nforms, as to the enormous masses of individuals, which we encounter living\r\nand fossil. We distinguish in this legion not less than thirty-two\r\ndifferent families, three hundred and sixteen genera, and more than\r\nseventeen hundred species.\r\n\r\nThe classification of this large group requires for its better\r\ncomprehension a careful division into larger and smaller groups. We divide\r\nit therefore first of all into two orders, #Collodaria# and #Sphærellaria#,\r\nas proposed in the paper mentioned above.[3]\r\n\r\nThe #Collodaria# have no perfect latticed skeleton, and comprise two\r\nsuborders or sections: in the #Colloidea# the skeleton is entirely wanting,\r\nin the #Beloidea# it is represented by a variable number of siliceous\r\nneedles or spicules, scattered in the calymma around the central capsule.\r\n\r\n{7}The #Sphærellaria# differ from the #Collodaria# in the possession of a\r\nperfect siliceous skeleton, which is originally a latticed spherical shell,\r\nenveloping the central capsule. By modification of this fenestrated sphere\r\narises an enormous mass of different forms, which we dispose in\r\ntwenty-eight families, and these in four larger groups, suborders or\r\nsections,--#Sphæroidea#, #Prunoidea#, #Discoidea#, and #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe #Sphæroidea#, the common ancestral group of the #Sphærellaria#, possess\r\na skeleton which is either a simple fenestrated sphere, or composed of two\r\nor more concentric latticed spheres, which are united by radial beams; more\r\nrarely it becomes more or less spongy.\r\n\r\nThe #Prunoidea# are derived from the #Sphæroidea# by prolongation of the\r\nlatticed sphere in one axis; the skeleton therefore becomes here\r\nellipsoidal or cylindrical (often with annular transversal constrictions).\r\n\r\nThe #Discoidea# on the contrary must be derived from the #Sphæroidea# by\r\nshortening in one axis; here therefore the fenestrated shell becomes more\r\nor less lenticular or iscoidal (often with radial spines or arms in the\r\nequatorial plane, on the circular margin).\r\n\r\nThe #Larcoidea#, the fourth section, differ from the three foregoing\r\nsections by the different growth of the shell in three different dimensions\r\nof space; therefore here the fenestrated shell becomes \"lentelliptical,\" or\r\na \"triaxial ellipsoid,\" its length, breadth, and height being different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Skeleton_ consists in all SPUMELLARIA either of pure _silica_ or of a\r\npeculiar silicate. The siliceous bars and beams constituting it are\r\ninvariably _solid_, as also in the NASSELLARIA, never hollow, as in the\r\nPHÆODARIA. Never is the skeleton composed of acanthin, as in all\r\nACANTHARIA. Whilst in the first order of SPUMELLARIA, #Collodaria#, the\r\nform of the spicula, or the scattered needles, composing the skeleton, is\r\nvery simple, _never latticed_, in the second order, the #Sphærellaria#, it\r\nis constantly latticed or fenestrated, often also spongy.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the lattice-shell in the #Sphærellaria#\r\nis originally spherical (homaxon), as preserved in all #Sphæroidea#; in the\r\n#Prunoidea# and #Discoidea# it becomes monaxon, with one single axis\r\n(prolonged in the former, shortened in the latter); in the #Larcoidea# it\r\nbecomes triaxon, by different growth in three principal axes, perpendicular\r\none to another. The further development of radial parts of the skeleton in\r\nthese three axes is very important for the \"promorphology\" of the\r\nRadiolaria.\r\n\r\n_The Malacoma_, or the whole soft body of the SPUMELLARIA as opposed to the\r\nskeleton, exhibits some differences of structure in two different groups,\r\nwhich were separated formerly (1862) as Monocyttaria and Polycyttaria,\r\ncorresponding to the \"Radiolaria monozoa and polyzoa\" of Johannes Müller\r\n(1858).\r\n\r\nThe #Monocyttaria# (or the Spumellaria solitaria) live isolated as single\r\ncells--like {8}all other Radiolaria--and are never aggregated in colonies;\r\nthe calymma includes one single central capsule, and this again one central\r\nnucleus, which does not become divided until full maturity.\r\n\r\nThe #Polycyttaria# on the contrary (or the Spumellaria socialia) live\r\naggregated in large colonies; the calymma includes a variable number of\r\nassociated central capsules and each of these commonly one central\r\noil-globule, whilst the original simple nucleus commonly becomes very early\r\ndivided into numerous small nuclei.\r\n\r\n_The Nucleus_ of the SPUMELLARIA is originally constantly _central_, placed\r\nquite in the centre of the concentric capsule, and it retains this central\r\nposition in all Monocyttaria or solitary Peripylea; whereas in the\r\nPolycyttaria--in consequence of its early division--its place is commonly\r\ntaken by a central oil-globule. Whilst the numerous nuclei of the latter\r\nare very small, the single nucleus of the former is comparatively large,\r\nextremely large (more than a millimeter in diameter) in some gigantic\r\n#Collodaria#.\r\n\r\n_The Endoplasm_ or the intracapsular sarcode exhibits in the greater number\r\nof SPUMELLARIA a more or less distinct radial striation. It encloses a\r\ngreat variety of different parts; vacuoles, oil-globules, pigment-granules,\r\ncrystals, &c.\r\n\r\n_The Membrane_ of the capsule in all SPUMELLARIA is simple (never double as\r\nin the _Phæodaria_) and everywhere equally perforated by innumerable small\r\npores; in the thick, double-edged membrane of many large #Collodaria# these\r\npores appear (in the optical section of the capsule-wall) as distinct fine\r\nradial canals, very densely and regularly disposed.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ in the SPUMELLARIA is originally a _geometrical\r\nsphere_, and this simple globular form is preserved in all #Sphæroidea#,\r\nand in the greatest part of #Colloidea# and #Beloidea#. By prolongation of\r\none axis the form becomes _ellipsoidal_ (or even cylindrical) in the\r\n#Prunoidea#, and in some few forms of #Colloidea#. By shortening of one\r\naxis it becomes _lenticular_ (or even discoidal) in the _Discoidea_, and in\r\nsome few forms of #Colloidea#. By unequal growth in three different axes,\r\nperpendicular one to another, the capsule becomes _lentelliptical_ in all\r\n#Larcoidea#. Very rarely the capsule assumes in the SPUMELLARIA a\r\npolyhedral or irregular (sometimes even amoeboid) form, only in a few\r\n#Colloidea#.\r\n\r\n_The Calymma_, or the jelly-veil including the central capsule, is very\r\nvoluminous in many SPUMELLARIA of gigantic size, mainly in the large\r\n#Colloidea#, and in all Polycyttaria or social Radiolaria. It includes here\r\na considerable number of large vacuoles or \"alveoli.\" The calymma never\r\nexhibits in this legion the dark voluminous phæodium, possessed by all\r\nPHÆODARIA.\r\n\r\n_Xanthellæ_ or \"zooxanthellæ\" are numerous in the calymma of most\r\nSPUMELLARIA, but by no means constant; they are very variable in number and\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n_The Matrix_, placed between the calymma and central capsule, is, in the\r\nmajority of the SPUMELLARIA, a rather thick layer of granular exoplasm.\r\n\r\n_The Pseudopodia_ arising from it are very numerous, equally disposed over\r\nthe whole {9}surface, and are in general rather fluid, exhibiting a\r\nconsiderable tendency to ramify, anastomose, and form networks. The\r\nmovement of granules is commonly lively. In the Polycyttaria all capsules\r\nof one colony or \"coenobium\" are connected by the dense variable network of\r\nanastomosing pseudopodia.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Orders and Suborders of_ SPUMELLARIA.\r\n\r\n  I.

Never in this\r\norder is there any trace of the latticed or fenestrated shell, which\r\ncharacterises the second order, #Sphærellaria#. The skeleton exhibits no\r\ntrace of phylogenetic connection in the two orders.\r\n\r\nIn my monograph (1862) two families appertaining to this order are\r\ndescribed, the Collida (p. 244) and the Sphærozoida (p. 521). Both families\r\ncontain forms with and without a skeleton. Of the solitary or monozous\r\nCollida the Thalassicollida are devoid of a skeleton, whilst the\r\nThalassosphærida are provided with a skeleton. Of the social or polyzous\r\nSphærozoida the Collozoida are without a skeleton, the Rhaphidozoida\r\nprovided with one. As the special form in both skeletophorous subfamilies\r\nis exactly the same, I prefer now to associate them in the suborder\r\n#Beloidea#, and to oppose them to the other two skeletonless subfamilies,\r\nwhich are united under the name of #Colloidea#.\r\n\r\n{10}_Synopsis of the four Families of Collodaria._\r\n\r\n  Suborder I.         { Solitary cells, living\r\n   COLLOIDEA.         {  as isolated individuals\r\n                      { (_Colloidea monozoa_),       1.

COLLOIDEA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA without skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Colloidea# comprises all those SPUMELLARIA in which no\r\nskeleton is developed. The whole body is therefore soft--a true\r\nmalacoma--and is composed only of two essential parts, the central capsule\r\nand the enveloping extracapsulum. The suborder contains only two different\r\nfamilies, the solitary #Thalassicollida# (or Colloidea monozoa) and the\r\nassociated #Collozoida# (or Colloidea polyzoa). Both families are very\r\nnearly allied, and differ only in one single essential character: the\r\nsolitary life of the former, the social union of the latter. It seems to be\r\nmerely in consequence of this difference that the cleavage of the nucleus\r\ncommonly takes place very late in the former, very early in the latter.\r\n\r\nTherefore the full-grown Thalassicollida (till immediately before\r\npropagation) commonly exhibit one single nucleus in the centre of the\r\ncapsule, whilst in the Collozoida the capsule is distended by numerous\r\nsmall nuclei. In these latter the centre of the capsule usually contains\r\none large oil-globule, whilst in the former oil-globules are either\r\nwanting, or scattered in large numbers in the endoplasm, or disposed in one\r\nlayer on the inside of the capsule membrane.\r\n\r\nIn the solitary Thalassicollida each capsule is enclosed in its own\r\npeculiar spherical calymma, whilst in the associated Collozoida all\r\ncapsules of the colony are united in one common, very voluminous calymma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily I. #THALASSICOLLIDA#, Haeckel, 1862.\r\n\r\n  _Thalassicollida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 246.\r\n  _Thalassicollida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Colloidea# solitaria.\r\n\r\nThe family Thalassicollida comprises all solitary SPUMELLARIA without a\r\nskeleton. The oldest and best known form of this family is the genus\r\n_Thalassicolla_, as restricted by {11}Johannes Müller.[4] The most common\r\nrepresentative of it, the cosmopolitan _Thalassicolla nucleata_, was first\r\ndescribed by Huxley in 1851. But as early as 1834 another large\r\nRadiolarian, appertaining either to this or to a nearly allied family, had\r\nbeen described by Meyen as _Physematium atlanticum_. A third genus was\r\ndetected by me in 1859 at Messina and figured under the name _Thalassolampe\r\nmargarodes_.[5] A very accurate histological description of these forms was\r\ngiven in 1876 by Richard Hertwig.[6] The same author figured in his\r\nOrganismus in 1879 a very interesting simpler form under the name\r\n_Thalassolampe primordialis_ (Taf. iii. fig. 5). Some similar forms had\r\nalready been observed by me, and are here united with it to form the first\r\ngenus _Actissa_.[7]\r\n\r\n_Actissa_ is of the highest general interest as the most simple and typical\r\nform of all Radiolaria, and as the common ancestral form, from which all\r\nother forms of this large class may be derived. Its unicellular body\r\nexhibits neither the extracapsular alveoli of _Thalassicolla_, nor the\r\nintracapsular alveoli of _Thalassolampe_, and shows all essential\r\ncharacters of the Radiolarian type in its most simple form (Pl. 1, figs. 1\r\nto 1_c_). The simple cell-body is composed of a spherical central capsule\r\nand a concentric, spherical, enveloping calymma, both separated by a thin\r\nmembrane which is perforated by innumerable pores. The capsule includes the\r\nendoplasm and in the centre a simple spherical nucleus with nucleolus; at\r\nthe time of propagation this latter becomes cleft into numerous small\r\nnuclei, each of which, together with a small piece of the surrounding\r\nendoplasm, forms a flagellated zoospore (fig. 1_c_). The extracapsulum is\r\nformed by the large, structureless, spherical calymma or concentric\r\njelly-veil enveloping the capsule, and by the thin granular matrix or the\r\nlayer of exoplasm which separates the calymma from the membrane. From this\r\nmatrix or maternal tissue arise innumerable very long and thin pseudopodia,\r\nas simple radiating filaments, the proximal part of which is included in\r\nthe calymma, whilst the distal part floats freely in the sea-water (Pl. 1,\r\nfig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe other Thalassicollida differ from their common ancestral form,\r\n_Actissa_, mainly by the higher histological differentiation of the\r\nunicellular body. Whilst in _Thalassicolla_ and _Thalassolampe_ the nucleus\r\nremains a single sphere as in _Actissa_, it becomes branched or covered\r\nwith radial blind saccules in _Thalassopila_ and _Thalassophysa_; also the\r\nintracapsular protoplasm develops here a great variety of peculiar\r\ndifferent corpuscles, as oil-globules, pigment-granules, concentric\r\nconcretions, crystals, &c. But the most striking peculiarity by which the\r\nother Thalassicollida differ from _Actissa_ is the development of large\r\nvesicular alveoli, either within or without the capsule; the unicellular\r\nbody reaches by this inflation the extraordinary size of 5 to 10 mm. or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n{12}_Synopsis of the Genera of Thalassicollida._\r\n\r\n  A.

The\r\nspherical body is composed of a simple spherical capsule and a concentric\r\nspherical calymma or jelly-envelope. Neither the former nor the latter\r\ncontains alveoli. The central capsule possesses a strong membrane\r\nperforated by small pores, and contains in the intracapsular sarcode\r\nnumerous small pellucid vacuoles, and in its middle a simple, concentric,\r\nspherical nucleus (often with some nucleoli); sometimes also one or more\r\noil-globules. The extracapsularium forms a soft, voluminous, structureless\r\ncalymma or enveloping jelly-sphere, perforated by the numberless, fine\r\npseudopodia, which radiate outwards from the matrix or the thin granulated\r\nsarcode-layer, surrounding the capsule. Often (but not constantly)\r\nxanthellæ or yellow cells are scattered in it. _Actissa_ differs from the\r\nfollowing skeletonless genera in the absence of all alveoli; it has neither\r\nintracapsular alveoli (like _Thalassolampe_) nor extracapsular alveoli\r\n(like _Thalassicolla_). The first observed species of this genus is that\r\nwhich I found in 1866 at the Canary Islands, _Actissa prototypus_; the\r\nsecond is that which Hertwig accurately described in 1879, from the\r\nMediterranean (Messina), _Actissa primordialis_; the third I observed in\r\n1881 at Ceylon, frequent and sporiparous, _Actissa princeps_. A fourth\r\nspecies (_Actissa radiata_) exhibited a distinct radial segmentation of the\r\ncapsule-contents. These four species are quite spherical. Six other\r\nspecies, occurring in different preparations from the Challenger, are\r\ndistinguished by modifications of the spherical capsule-form and may\r\nrepresent three different subgenera (or, perhaps better,\r\ngenera?)--_Actiprunum_ ellipsoidal, _Actidiscus_ lenticular, _Actilarcus_\r\nlentelliptical; perhaps these are the ancestral forms of the three\r\nsections: #Prunoidea#, #Discoidea#, #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{13}Subgenus 1. _Procyttarium_, Haeckel, 1879.\r\n\r\n  _Procyttarium_, Haeckel, Natürl.

By\r\nthese the central capsule is inflated to an extraordinary size, which in\r\n_Thalassolampe maxima_ exceeds that of most other Radiolaria. From the\r\nnearly allied _Thalassopila_ it differs by the simple spherical nucleus,\r\nfrom _Physematium_ by the absence of spicula. Of the two species of the\r\ngenus the first observed _Thalassolampe margarodes_, 1862, is\r\nMediterranean, the second, _Thalassolampe maxima_, 1882, is Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Thalassolampe margarodes_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Thalassolampe margarodes_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

In the movable\r\nprotoplasmic network between the large alveoles a considerable number of\r\nlarge yellowish or orange oil-globules. Extracapsular jelly-envelope very\r\nthin, contains small yellow bodies (zooxanthellæ). (Compare the accurate\r\ndescription of this Mediterranean species in my monograph and in Hertwig's\r\nwork.) In the Canary Islands I found very often a large variety of it, of\r\ndouble and triple the size, distinguished by the delicate orange colour of\r\nthe intracapsular oil-globules.

Nucleus profusely branched or papillated, its spherical\r\nsurface covered with numerous (more than a hundred) finger-shaped obtuse\r\nblind sacs, about as long as its radius. Protoplasm of the central capsule\r\nforming a loose network between the large roundish alveoles, in the\r\ncortical zone radially striped and containing one layer of large dark\r\noil-globules. These are regularly distributed on the inside of the\r\ncapsule-membrane and separated by intervals, twice as broad as its\r\ndiameter, giving to the capsule-surface a spotted appearance.

Nat. Hist., ser.\r\n2, vol. viii. p. 433.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Thalassicollida without intracapsular alveoles, but with\r\nlarge roundish or globular alveoles within the extracapsular calymma.\r\nNucleus in the centre of the capsule simple spherical, not branched.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Thalassicolla_ was proposed by Huxley in 1851, for a certain\r\nnumber of different voluminous jelly-like Radiolaria, which he had observed\r\nliving during his voyage in the \"Rattlesnake\" through the tropical seas,\r\nand of which he gives an excellent description--the first accurate\r\nobservations on living Radiolaria. Johannes Müller afterwards removed from\r\nthis genus the social genera _Sphærozoum_ and _Collosphæra_ (formerly\r\n_Thalassicolla punctata_), and retained as type of the genus _Thalassicolla\r\nnucleata_. In 1862 in my Monograph I added two other species,\r\n_Thalassicolla pelagica_ and _Thalassicolla zanclea_, and later (1870)\r\n_Thalassicolla sanguinolenta_. Now I think it better to separate the last\r\ntwo species as a new genus, _Thalassophysa_, characterised by the papillate\r\nor branched nucleus, and to retain in _Thalassicolla_ only those forms with\r\nsimple spherical nucleus. For both genera the extracapsular, voluminous,\r\nspherical calymma or jelly-envelope, with numerous large alveoles, is\r\ncharacteristic. The membrane of the central capsule in _Thalassicolla_ is\r\nnow structureless (subgenus _Thalassicollarium_, with three species), now\r\ncharacterised by a peculiar structure, prominent ridges on the inside of\r\nthe membrane, which form a network with polygonal plates, resembling an\r\nepithelium (Pl. 1, fig. 5_b_; subgenus _Thalassicollidium_, with four\r\nspecies). Of the seven species here described, two are cosmopolitan, widely\r\ndistributed, and common; one is Mediterranean, one Atlantic, and three\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Thalassicollarium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Membrane of the central capsule structureless, only\r\nperforated by innumerable very small radial pores.\r\n\r\n\r\n{19}1. _Thalassicolla pellucida_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpherical body very soft, transparent, clear and colourless, without any\r\npigment.

Radiol., p. 522.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Colloidea# socialia.\r\n\r\nThe family Collozoida comprises all associated or colony-building\r\nRadiolaria without skeleton. We unite here all these skeletonless\r\nRadiolarian colonies into one single genus _Collozoum_, constituted (1862)\r\nin my Monograph (p. 522). The oldest known form of it was the _Collozoum\r\ninerme_, described firstly by Johannes Müller (1856) as _Sphærozoum\r\ninerme_. Two other species of the genus were figured (1862) in my Monograph\r\n(p. 522, Tafn. xxxii., xxxv.). A most accurate description of its\r\nhistological structure and {24}development was given in 1876 by Richard\r\nHertwig in his Histologie der Radiolarien (pp. 12-42, Tafn. i., ii.). A\r\nnumber of other very remarkable forms of _Collozoum_ have been observed by\r\nme during the last few years, and partly figured in Pl. 3.\r\n\r\n_Collozoum_, as the only representative of this family, is sufficiently\r\ndistinguished from all other Radiolaria by the definition \"_Skeletonless\r\nRadiolarian Colonies._\" These occur floating on the surface of all warmer\r\nseas, often in astonishing masses, and may be easily confounded, owing to\r\ntheir external resemblance, with the jelly-like egg-masses of certain\r\nMollusca. _Collozoum_ is derived either from _Actissa_ or from\r\n_Thalassicolla_, simply by multiplication of the unicellular body and by\r\nreunion of the associated capsules in one common calymma or jelly-veil;\r\nthis is constantly alveolated, as in _Thalassicolla_. As in _Actissa_, the\r\nform of the central capsule remains either spherical, or it becomes\r\nellipsoidal or discoidal, rarely polyhedral or amoeboid. In _Collozoum_ as\r\nin all colonial Radiolaria, the original central nucleus commonly undergoes\r\ncleavage very early into numerous small nuclei, whilst its place is usually\r\ntaken by a central oil-globule. This peculiarity may serve often (but not\r\nconstantly) for the distinction of isolated capsules of _Collozoum_ from\r\n_Actissa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 6. _Collozoum_,[13] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 522.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Skeletonless colonies of Radiolaria.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Collozoum_, as already mentioned, is the only representative of\r\nits family, and comprises all Radiolaria living associated in colonies, and\r\nhaving no skeleton. Therefore _Collozoum_ possesses all the peculiarities\r\ndescribed above. Although the floating colonies of this genus occur in\r\nenormous masses on the surface of all warmer seas, nevertheless the number\r\nof different species in this genus is not great, and amounts only to\r\nthirteen. If this number increase by further investigations, the subgenera\r\ndistinguished in the following description can be advanced to the range of\r\ngenera; in which case _Collodinium_ (or _Collozoum_ sensu restricto) will\r\nbe characterised by the spherical form of its central capsules,\r\n_Colloprunum_ by the ellipsoidal form (Pl. 3, fig. 9), _Collophidium_ by\r\nthe cylindrical, very prolonged form (figs. 2, 3), _Collodiscus_ by the\r\nlenticular or discoidal form, and _Collodastrum_ by the indefinite,\r\npolyhedral, or amoeboid form (figs. 4, 5).\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Collodinium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Form of the central capsules spherical or subspherical,\r\nnever polyhedral, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical.\r\n\r\n\r\n{25}1. _Collozoum inerme_, Haeckel (Pl. 3, figs. 10-12).\r\n\r\n  _Collozoum inerme_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

BELOIDEA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with an imperfect skeleton, composed of numerous\r\nsolid needles or spicula, scattered irregularly in the calymma.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Beloidea# comprises all those SPUMELLARIA which possess an\r\nimperfect or rudimentary skeleton, composed of a variable number of\r\nisolated spicula scattered in the extracapsulum. The suborder contains only\r\ntwo different families, the solitary Thalassosphærida (or Beloidea monozoa)\r\nand the associated Sphærozoida (or Beloidea polyzoa). Both families are\r\nvery nearly allied, and differ only in one single character: the solitary\r\nlife of the former, the social union of the {29}latter. It seems to be\r\nmerely a consequence of this difference that the cleavage of the nucleus\r\ncommonly takes place very late in the former, very early in the latter.\r\n\r\nCommonly, therefore, the full-grown Thalassosphærida (until immediately\r\nbefore their propagation) exhibit one single nucleus in the centre of the\r\ncapsule, whilst in the Sphærozoida the capsule is distended with numerous\r\nsmall nuclei. In these latter the centre of the capsule usually contains\r\none large oil-globule, whilst in the former oil-globules are either wanting\r\nor scattered in large numbers in the endoplasm, or disposed in one layer on\r\nthe inside of the capsule membrane.\r\n\r\nIn the solitary Thalassosphærida each capsule is enclosed in its own\r\npeculiar spherical calymma, whilst in the associated Sphærozoida all the\r\ncapsules of the colony are united into one common, very voluminous,\r\nalveolated calymma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily III. #THALASSOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel, 1862, (Pl. 2).\r\n\r\n_Thalassosphærida_, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 255.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Beloidea# solitaria.\r\n\r\nThe family Thalassosphærida comprises all solitary SPUMELLARIA with an\r\nimperfect skeleton, composed of numerous solid needles or spicula,\r\nscattered around the central capsule in the calymma. The structure of the\r\nunicellular soft body is quite the same as in the Thalassicollida; it\r\ndiffers from these only in the possession of the extracapsular skeleton.\r\nAll needles of this skeleton are solid siliceous spicula, never hollow, as\r\nin the similar Cannorrhaphida among the PHÆODARIA. In the special structure\r\nand form of the skeleton the Thalassosphærida agree perfectly with the\r\nwell-known, colony-building Sphærozoida; they differ from these only by\r\ntheir hermit-like life and by some peculiarities derived from this solitary\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known form of this family is probably the first Radiolarian,\r\nobserved in the living state, described in 1834 by Meyen as _Physematium\r\natlanticum_ (see p. 35). A second form was figured in my Monograph (1862)\r\nas _Thalassosphæra bifurca_ (p. 260, Taf. xii. fig. 1). A third form was\r\nthere described under the name _Thalassosphæra morum_; this remarkable form\r\nwas first observed by Johannes Müller, and figured under the name\r\n_Thalassicolla morum_ (1858, Abhandl., p. 28, Taf. vii. figs. 1, 2). The\r\nsame form was afterwards observed living by myself in the Mediterranean, as\r\nwell as in the Atlantic, and in great numbers by the late Sir Wyville\r\nThomson in the Pacific. The latter gave a good figure of it with some\r\nvaluable remarks in his excellent work, The Atlantic (1877, vol. i. p. 233,\r\nfig. 51). He called this peculiar Rhizopod _Calcaromma calcarea_, on\r\naccount of the very peculiar _calcareous_ bodies \"looking in outline like\r\nthe rowels of spurs,\" which are accumulated in great quantity around the\r\ncentral capsule, in the calymma. Further investigations have convinced me\r\nthat these peculiar stellate {30}bodies of carbonate of lime, for which we\r\npropose the name \"Calcastrella,\" are not parts of the skeleton produced by\r\nthe Radiolarian, but foreign bodies picked up by its extracapsular sarcode\r\n(in the same way as the Coccoliths are picked up by _Thalassicolla\r\nsanguinolenta = Myxobrachia!_). These Calcastrella occur also in the\r\ncalymma of some Discoidea and other Radiolaria; they are either unicellular\r\ncalcareous Algæ, or foreign bodies of other origin. The _Collodarium_,\r\nhowever, described as _Thalassicolla morum_ and _Calcaromma calcarea_,\r\nseems to be a simple _Actissa_, which has picked up a number of\r\nCalcastrella.\r\n\r\nThe Challenger collection has yielded a number of other true\r\nThalassosphærida, which partly agree with _Thalassosphæra_ in the simple\r\nstructure of the unicellular body (resembling _Actissa_), and partly differ\r\nfrom it in the development of alveoles, either within or without the\r\ncentral capsule (similar to _Thalassolampe_ and _Thalassicolla_). The solid\r\nsiliceous spicula, which occur in great numbers scattered in the calymma,\r\nagree perfectly in form with the spicula of the colony-building\r\nSphærozoida. A characteristic difference between the social and the\r\nsolitary #Beloidea# seems to be determined by the cleavage of the nucleus,\r\nwhich takes place in the latter very late, in the former very early.\r\nTherefore in the large central capsule of the mature solitary\r\nThalassosphærida, we commonly find one large nucleus in the centre, and a\r\nnumber of oil-globules around it in the endosarc, or disposed in one layer\r\non the inside of the capsule-membrane (Pl. 2, figs. 2, 5); whereas in the\r\nmuch smaller associated capsules of the Sphærozoida one large oil-globule\r\nis placed commonly in the centre, and a great number of small nuclei\r\nscattered in the endoplasm (compare above, p. 24).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Thalassosphærida._\r\n\r\n  A.

Müller\r\nhad formerly called _Thalassicolla morum_. This latter form is\r\ncharacterised by peculiar _calcareous_ bodies \"looking in outline like the\r\nrowels of spurs, scattered irregularly in the gelatinous envelope,\" and was\r\ntherefore afterwards called \"_Calcaromma calcarea_\" by Sir Wyville\r\nThomson.[15] As already mentioned above, these calcareous rowels are\r\nforeign bodies, picked up by an _Actissa_ (see p. 29). I here confine the\r\ngenus _Thalassosphæra_ to those solitary #Beloidea# in which the body\r\nexhibits no alveoles, and the siliceous solid spicula in the calymma are\r\nquite simple needles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thalassosphæra belonium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpicula thin cylindrical rods, more or less curved, pointed at both ends,\r\nwith smooth surface (similar to the needles of _Rhaphidozoum italicum_).\r\nCentral capsule spherical, three times as large as the central nucleus,\r\nwithout larger oil-globules.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.1 to 0.12, length of the\r\nspicula 0.04 to 0.08.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thalassosphæra rhaphidium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nSpicula thick cylindrical rods, more or less curved, pointed at both ends,\r\ncovered with numerous strong conical thorns, perpendicular to the axis.\r\nCentral capsule spherical, four times as broad as the central nucleus, with\r\ntwenty to thirty large oil-globules on the inside of the membrane.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.2, length of the spicula\r\n0.12 to 0.16.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 347, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 8. _Thalassoxanthium_,[16] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 470.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Thalassosphærida without alveoles, with numerous branched or\r\ncompound spicula in the calymma.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Thalassoxanthium_ differs from the foregoing _Thalassosphæra_,\r\nby the ramification of the spicula, and has therefore the same relation to\r\nit as _Sphærozoum_ to _Belonozoum_.

Radiol., p. 521.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Beloidea# socialia.\r\n\r\nThe family #Sphærozoida# comprises all associated or colony-forming\r\nRadiolaria, which are provided with an imperfect skeleton, composed of\r\nnumerous solid needles or spicula, scattered around the central capsule in\r\nthe calymma. The structure and form of this skeleton is quite the same as\r\nin the preceding solitary Thalassosphærida, but on the other hand, the\r\nstructure and form of the colonies and of the included numerous central\r\ncapsules is the same as in the skeletonless Collozoida.\r\n\r\nThe oldest well-known form of Sphærozoida is the common cosmopolitan\r\n_Sphærozoum punctatum_, probably first observed in 1834 by Meyen, and\r\ncalled _Sphærozoum fuscum_, afterwards more accurately described by Huxley\r\nin 1851.\r\n\r\n{39}Other forms were afterwards described by Müller and by myself in\r\n1862.[21] Further investigations have shown me that some species of this\r\nfamily are among the most common Radiolaria, and occur in astonishing\r\nnumbers on the surface of all warmer seas. But the number of species is\r\ncomparatively small, and their distinction is very difficult, as all the\r\ndifferent forms are very variable and connected by intermediate forms--a\r\ntruly \"_transformistic_\" group.\r\n\r\nThe only character sufficient for the constitution of genera in this\r\ntransformistic group is found in the form and composition of the spicula;\r\nthe very variable form of the jelly-calymma and the enclosed central\r\ncapsule being without value for this purpose. But also the form of the\r\nspicula is very variable, and not always constant. In some species the\r\nparticular form of the spicula is transmitted by constant heredity, whilst\r\nin others it is very inconstant, even in one and the same individual.\r\n(Compare the remarks on variability in the general introduction.)\r\n\r\nAs the number of various forms is rather great, it seems to be advisable to\r\ndistinguish the three following genera.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Sphærozoida._\r\n\r\n  A.

Johannes Müller\r\ndescribed a number of species, which were partly skeletonless\r\n(_Collozoum_), partly armed with simple or with compound spicula. The\r\nspecies with simple spicula we refer here to _Belonozoum_, the species with\r\ntwo or more different kinds of spicula to _Rhaphidozoum_, while we unite in\r\n_Sphærozoum_ all species with one kind of branched or compound spicula.

SPHÆRELLARIA, Haeckel, 1881.\r\n\r\n  _Sphærellaria_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 421.\r\n  _Sphæridea_ vel _Peripylea_, Hertwig, 1879, Organismus der Radiol., p.\r\n      133.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with latticed or spongy shell.\r\n\r\nThe order #Sphærellaria#, the second order of Radiolaria, comprises all\r\nthose SPUMELLARIA in which the skeleton is a latticed or fenestrated, often\r\nmore or less spongy, siliceous shell. Originally this shell is a simple\r\nextracapsular lattice-sphere, in which the central capsule is included;\r\nfrom this simple ancestral form an enormous {50}mass of different and often\r\nvery complicated forms is derived; this order is by far the largest, and in\r\nmorphological respects the most important and most interesting, of all\r\nRadiolaria. It contains not less than twenty-eight different families,\r\nthree hundred and five genera, and more than sixteen hundred species.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862) seven families appertaining to this group are\r\ndescribed--the Ethmosphærida, Cladococcida, Ommatida, Spongurida, Discida,\r\nLithelida, and Collosphærida. The astonishing increase of this group by the\r\ndetection of a large series of new and interesting forms, and particularly\r\nof important connecting forms between very different branches of it, now\r\nenables me to give a much better arrangement. I discern now four suborders\r\nor sections of #Sphærellaria#, according to the different geometrical form\r\nof the central capsule and of the latticed shell enveloping it. The first\r\nof these, and the common ancestral group of the whole order, is the\r\n#Sphæroidea#, with spherical capsule; in the #Prunoidea# it becomes\r\nellipsoidal or cylindrical by prolongation of one axis; in the #Discoidea#\r\nlenticular or discoidal by shortening of one axis; in the #Larcoidea#\r\nlentelliptical, or triaxon-ellipsoid, by different growth of the capsule in\r\nthree different \"dimensive axes.\"\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Four Suborders of_ #Sphærellaria#.\r\n\r\n  Central capsule    { Shell a simple sphere or a\r\n   spherical.        {  system of concentric spheres,  1. #Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\n  Central capsule    { Shell a simple ellipsoid or a\r\n   ellipsoidal or    {  cylinder with annular\r\n   cylindrical.      {  transverse constrictions,      2. #Prunoidea#.\r\n\r\n  Central capsule\r\n   lenticular or     { Shell a biconvex lens or a\r\n   discoidal.        {  flat disk,                     3. #Discoidea#.\r\n\r\n  Central capsule\r\n   lentelliptical or { Shell a triaxon-ellipsoid, with\r\n   triaxon.          {  three different axes,          4. #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nSuborder I. SPHÆROIDEA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Sphæroida_, _Sphæridea_, _Sphærida_, Haeckel, 1878, Protistenreich, p.\r\n      103.\r\n  _Sphæridea_, R. Hertwig, 1879, Organismus der Radiol., p. 39.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with spherical central capsule (very rarely\r\nsomewhat modified, or allomorphous); with spherical fenestrated siliceous\r\nshell (often an endospherical polyhedron, very rarely of more modified,\r\nsubspherical form or allomorphous). Growth of the shell in the three\r\ndimensive axes equal.\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Sphæroidea#, the first and most important of the four of the\r\n#Sphærellaria#, comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the original\r\ngeometrical {51}spherical form is quite constantly preserved in the central\r\ncapsule, and commonly also in the fenestrated shell enveloping the latter,\r\nalthough in many forms the sphere is more or less modified; very frequently\r\nit is an \"endospherical polyhedron,\" _i.e._, a polyhedron all the angles\r\n(or the nodes of the network) of which lie upon the surface of a\r\ngeometrical sphere; more rarely the spherical form is more or less modified\r\nand irregular. In the great majority of #Sphæroidea# there is no external\r\nindication of the three dimensive axes; but in many forms they are\r\nindicated by the regular position of certain external radial spines or\r\ninternal radial beams. However, in no case are those three axes expressed\r\nin the form of the shell itself and of the enclosed spherical central\r\ncapsule; this is the main character by which the #Sphæroidea# differ from\r\nthe following sections:--#Prunoidea#, #Discoidea#, #Larcoidea#, all three\r\nof which arise from them.\r\n\r\nThe section #Sphæroidea#, in the sense here restricted, was founded by me\r\nin my Protistenreich (1878, p. 103) and adopted by Hertwig (1879) in his\r\nOrganismus der Radiolarien (p. 39). The different groups appertaining to\r\nthis large section were characterised more accurately in my Prodromus\r\n(1881, pp. 448-456); there I gave the characters of six subfamilies with\r\nthirty tribes, containing ninety-three genera. Formerly, in my Monograph\r\n(1862), the #Sphæroidea# were disposed in five different\r\nfamilies:--Ethmosphærida, Cladococcida, Ommatida, Spongosphærida,\r\nCollosphærida. At that time I could not separate them sufficiently from\r\nsome ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA, which have a similar spherical\r\nlattice-shell.\r\n\r\nAs the number of different genera and species in the #Sphæroidea# is much\r\ngreater than in all other sections of SPUMELLARIA, many forms were already\r\ndescribed by former authors. In the oldest system of Ehrenberg (1847, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 53) they represent one part of his Haliommatina (with four\r\ngenera, _Haliomma_, _Chilomma_, _Stylosphæra_, _Spongosphæra_). Most\r\nspecies, however, of these genera are #Discoidea#. Also in the latest\r\nsystem of Ehrenberg (1875, _loc. cit._, p. 157) his Haliommatina are a\r\nconfused conglomeration of different SPUMELLARIA (#Sphæroidea#,\r\n#Discoidea#, and #Prunoidea#).\r\n\r\nThe section #Sphæroidea# is the largest division of #Sphærellaria#,\r\ncomprising not less than one hundred and seven genera and six hundred and\r\nfifty species. This enormous number (easily to be augmented by further\r\ninvestigations) requires a careful disposition in different families and\r\nsubfamilies. For this disposition two different principles only can be\r\nemployed: firstly, the number and disposition of the _radial spines_;\r\nsecondly, the number of the _concentric latticed spheres_, which are\r\nconnected by radial beams. I give here the preference to the first\r\nprinciple, whilst in my Prodromus (1881) I had preferred the second. The\r\nquestion, which of the two principles is more important for the\r\nclassification of #Sphæroidea#, is very difficult to answer; probably in\r\nmany cases the former, in many the latter is more important for their\r\nphylogeny.\r\n\r\n{52}Regarding the number of the concentric shells which compose the\r\nlatticed carapace of the #Sphæroidea#, we can distinguish six families,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n     I. Monosphærida (with one single shell).\r\n    II. Dyosphærida (with two concentric shells).\r\n   III. Triosphærida (with three concentric shells).\r\n    IV. Tetrasphærida (with four concentric shells).\r\n     V. Polysphærida (with five or more concentric shells).\r\n    VI. Spongosphærida (with spongy shells).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, regarding the number of the radial spines and their\r\nregular disposition on the shell-surface, we can distinguish five families,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n     I. Liosphærida (without radial spines).\r\n    II. Stylosphærida (with two radial spines, opposite in one axis).\r\n   III. Staurosphærida (with four radial spines, opposite in pairs in two\r\n      axes, perpendicular one to another).\r\n    IV.

Originally this\r\nshell is probably everywhere an extracapsular or \"cortical shell,\" which is\r\ndeveloped on the outside of the jelly-veil enveloping the central capsule,\r\nand serves as a protective carapace for these soft enclosed parts. But with\r\nthe progress of growth the central capsule becomes larger than the\r\nincluding shell, and sends out through its pores club-shaped prolongations\r\nor cæcal-sacs (Pl. 11, figs. 1, 5; Pl. 19, figs. 2, 3, 5; Pl. 20, fig.\r\n1_a_; Pl. 27, fig. 3). These protruded sacs may fuse together again outside\r\nthe shell and form a spherical bladder, now enveloping the smaller shell;\r\nthe latter now becomes an intracapsular or \"medullary shell.\"\r\n\r\nAs #Pliosphærida# (or _Sphæroidea concentrica_) we can oppose to the simple\r\nMonosphærida all other #Sphæroidea#, the lattice-shell of which is composed\r\nof two or more concentric shells, connected by radial beams. Probably all\r\nPliosphærida (or at least the greater part of them) arise from the\r\nMonosphærida by centrifugal growth; two or more radial spines are developed\r\nfrom the surface of the simple lattice-sphere, and are united together by\r\ncommunicating lateral branches, developed at equal distances from the\r\ncentre; and this same process may be repeated, two, three, four, or more\r\ntimes. In this way originate the characteristic systems of concentric\r\nspheres, all united by piercing radial beams which arise from the surface\r\nof the innermost sphere (not from its centre). Regarding this mode of\r\ngrowth, we can distinguish the innermost as \"original\" or \"primary\" shell,\r\nand all subsequent ones as \"apposed\" or \"secondary\" shells; if the number\r\nof concentric shells amount to three or more, commonly both innermost\r\nshells lie within the central capsule and are medullary shells, whilst all\r\nothers lie outside it and are therefore cortical shells. This difference\r\ncan be commonly recognised also in the isolated shell, without its central\r\ncapsule; the distance between the cortical and the medullary shells being\r\ncommonly much larger than the distance between the two medullary shells.\r\n\r\nThe #Dyosphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with two concentric shells, are the\r\nmost numerous among the Pliosphærida. Commonly in this group the inner or\r\nprimary shell lies within the central capsule as a true \"medullary shell,\"\r\nwhilst the outer lies outside it as a \"cortical shell\"; therefore the\r\nradial beams, connecting both, pierce the wall of the capsule. But in\r\nseveral forms, mainly in the peculiar group of Diplosphærida, both\r\nconcentric shells remain outside the central capsule, and both are\r\ntherefore \"cortical shells.\"\r\n\r\nThe #Triosphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with three concentric shells, are\r\nalso very rich in different forms, though not so numerous by far as the\r\nDyosphærida. Commonly in the Triosphærida both inner shells lie within the\r\ncentral capsule as \"medullary shells,\" whilst the third lies outside it as\r\na \"cortical shell\"; therefore the central capsule remains intermediate in\r\nsize between the outer and the middle shell. But in some genera (_e.g._,\r\n_Rhodosphæra_) both outer shells are cortical and only the {54}innermost is\r\na medullary shell. In this case the size of the capsule remains\r\nintermediate between the inner and the middle shell.\r\n\r\nThe #Tetrasphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with four concentric shells, are\r\nin general not frequent, and not rich in different forms. In most of the\r\nobserved species two inner shells are medullary, two outer cortical shells,\r\nthe former within, the latter without, the central capsule; and the wall of\r\nthe capsule, pierced by the connecting radial beams, lies between the two\r\nmiddle shells. But there are some Tetrasphærida in which all four shells\r\nseem to be external or cortical shells.\r\n\r\nThe #Polysphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with five or more concentric\r\nshells, seem of course to offer the greatest possibility for the\r\ndevelopment of very different forms; but in reality this group is the\r\npoorest and smallest of all; and only one part of it, the Arachnosphærida,\r\nis rather common. In this peculiar division the shell is composed of five\r\nto ten or more, very delicate, cobweb-like concentric shells, which are\r\nconnected by radial beams; all are cortical shells, and lie outside the\r\ncentral capsule. Much more rare are those Polysphærida, in which both\r\ninnermost shells, as true medullary shells, lie within the central capsule,\r\nall others being outside it. The total number of concentric shells in this\r\ngroup is commonly between five and ten, rarely more.\r\n\r\nThe #Spongosphærida# are distinguished from all other #Sphæroidea# by the\r\nspongy structure of the spherical shell, which is composed wholly or\r\npartially of an irregular spongy framework. The relation of this group to\r\nthe other groups of #Sphæroidea# is probably rather complicated, for in\r\nsome Spongosphærida the whole shell is composed of massive spongy\r\nreticulation, whilst in others it contains a spherical central cavity, and\r\nin a third group this cavity is filled up by one or two concentric\r\nlattice-shells, connected by radial beams. Many of these Spongosphærida are\r\nvery common, and of considerable size.\r\n\r\nThe #Collosphærida# form a peculiar separate group of #Sphæroidea#,\r\ndistinguished from all others by their social life or aggregation in\r\ncolonies (coenobia). They represent the only group of #Sphærellaria# in\r\nwhich this association of numerous individual capsules or cells is\r\nrealised. The shell is almost constantly simple, without regularly disposed\r\nradial spines; therefore they may be called \"social Monosphærida,\" or\r\nbetter \"polyzoic Ethmosphærida.\" Only in one small group (Clathrosphærida)\r\nthe shell, enveloping every central capsule, is double or surrounded by an\r\nexternal mantle; these may be compared to the Diplosphærida (or better to a\r\npart of the Carposphærida, _Liosphæra_, p. 76). In most of the\r\nCollosphærida the lattice-shell is more or less irregular in form and\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lattice Work_ of the fenestrated shells is in the #Sphæroidea# of the\r\ngreatest variability, and its innumerable modifications serve mainly for\r\nthe distinction of species. In general we can distinguish as the most\r\nimportant modifications a _regular_ network (with equal size, form, and\r\ndistance of the pores or meshes) and an _irregular_ network (with\r\n{55}differences in the size, form, or distance of the meshes or pores). In\r\nboth groups the pores may be either angular or round; so that there may\r\nexist together four different main forms of network--(A) regular lattice\r\nwith equal hexagonal pores; (B) regular lattice with equal circular pores;\r\n(C) irregular lattice with unequal polygonal pores; (D) irregular lattice\r\nwith unequal roundish pores. Besides these modifications, the pores may be\r\nprolonged into tubules which are directed radially towards the outside\r\n(rarely towards the inside) of the sphere. In other cases they are\r\nsurrounded by elevated or honeycomb-like frames.\r\n\r\n_The Radial Spines_ exhibit in the #Sphæroidea# the greatest variety in\r\nform, size, disposition, &c., and their numerous modifications serve mainly\r\nfor the distinction of genera, their peculiar formation and size also for\r\nthe distinction of species. In general we may distinguish as the most\r\nimportant modifications primary and secondary spines. The primary spines or\r\n\"main spines\" are commonly direct outward prolongations of the internal\r\nradial beams, connecting the concentric shells. The secondary or\r\n\"by-spines\" arise only from the surface of the lattice-shell, without\r\nreference to the internal beams. The by-spines are commonly smaller, and\r\nmuch more numerous than the main spines. Regarding the form, the radial\r\nspines are either roundish (cylindrical or conical, often also club-shaped,\r\nrarely spindle-shaped) or angular (commonly three-sided, prismatic or\r\npyramidal). The spines are constantly solid, never hollow; the \"internal\r\ncanals,\" described by some authors, are only microscopic views of the\r\ntransparent edges. In many cases the spines are branched or forked. The\r\nmost important difference in the variable shape of the spines is their\r\nregular or irregular number and disposition, which afford characters for\r\nthe distinction of our five families.\r\n\r\n_The Three Dimensive Axes_--or the three diameters of the sphere,\r\nperpendicular one to another--are in the great majority of the #Sphæroidea#\r\nsignificant in the promorphological consideration of the body, and are\r\nindicated either by the position of the external radial spines, or at least\r\nof the internal radial beams, connecting the concentric spheres. Commonly\r\ntwo radial spines are placed opposite in each axis. The most perfect group\r\nin this respect seems to be that of the Cubosphærida, in which the three\r\naxes are represented by three pairs of spines. Next come the\r\nStaurosphærida, in which two axes in cross-form are exhibited by two pairs\r\nof spines. The most simple group are the Stylosphærida, in which only one\r\npair of spines is developed, indicating one single axis. These three\r\nfamilies form together a continuous natural series,--the #Sphæroidea# with\r\nreal dimensive axes,--and exhibit at the same time relations to the three\r\nother suborders of #Sphærellaria#, the #Larcoidea#, #Discoidea#, and\r\n#Prunoidea# respectively. At both ends of this series stand two other\r\nfamilies, on one side the Liosphærida, without any radial spines on the\r\nsurface of the sphere, on the other side the Astrosphærida, in which the\r\nradial spines are developed in great and variable numbers, at least eight\r\nto twelve, commonly twenty to forty, often more than a hundred or even a\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n{56}The #Liosphærida# comprise all those #Sphæroidea# in which the surface\r\nof the shell is smooth, without radial spines (Pls. 12, 20). The simplest\r\nof these are the Ethmosphærida, with one single lattice-shell, enveloping\r\nthe spherical central capsule. _Cenosphæra_, the most simple form of the\r\nEthmosphærida, may be regarded as the common ancestral form of all\r\n#Sphæroidea#, in an ontogenetical as well as in a phylogenetical and\r\nmorphological sense. From this simple lattice sphere all other #Sphæroidea#\r\ncan be derived either by radial or by tangential growth. If the radial\r\nbeams, arising from the surface of the simple fenestrated sphere, become\r\nconnected (at equal distances from the centre) by tangential beams, we get\r\nthe compound shells of the \"Liosphærida concentrica\" (with two, three,\r\nfour, or more concentric spheres). The radial beams connecting these\r\nexhibit in many Liosphærida the same regular disposition and number as the\r\nexternal radial spines in the Astrosphærida. Perhaps these forms in a\r\n\"natural system\" would be better united (_e.g._, Liosphærida with twelve or\r\ntwenty internal radial beams, and Astrosphærida with twelve or twenty\r\nexternal radial spines); but in many cases (mainly for higher numbers) the\r\ncertain determination of their number and disposition is very difficult or\r\nquite impossible.\r\n\r\nThe #Cubosphærida# (Pls. 21-25) represent the large and very important\r\nfamily of #Sphæroidea#, in which all three dimensive axes are equally\r\ndistinguished by pairs of spines, corresponding to three axes of a cube or\r\nof a regular octahedron, agreeing therefore also with the three axes of the\r\ncubic or regular crystalline system. In the majority of the Cubosphærida\r\nthe six radial spines are accurately opposite each other in pairs in three\r\naxes, perpendicular one to another, and commonly they are of equal size and\r\nform; but in some genera the three pairs of spines become differentiated,\r\nwhilst both spines of each pair remain equal. Either one pair is larger\r\nthan the two others (which are equal), corresponding to the axes of the\r\nquadratic crystalline system; or all three pairs are different\r\n(corresponding to the three unequal axes of the rhombic crystalline\r\nsystem); the former nearer to the #Discoidea#, the latter to the\r\n#Larcoidea#. We may suppose with some probability, that the Cubosphærida\r\nare for the most part the common ancestral group of those #Sphæroidea#, in\r\nwhich a certain number of radial spines or beams is disposed in a regular\r\norder; the Staurosphærida may be derived from them by loss of one pair of\r\nspines, the Stylosphærida by loss of two pairs of spines, and most\r\nAstrosphærida by multiplying the radial spines, six to fourteen or more\r\nsecondary spines being added to the six primary \"dimensive spines.\"\r\nHowever, in many Astrosphærida (_e.g._, in those with eight spines,\r\n_Centrocubus_, _Octodendron_, &c.) the regular geometrical disposition of\r\nthe radial spines seems to follow another mathematical order, quite\r\nindependent of the Cubosphærida.\r\n\r\nThe #Staurosphærida# (Pl. 15) are distinguished by the possession of four\r\nradial spines, opposite in pairs in two axes, perpendicular one to another.\r\nThis rectangular cross determines a certain plane, the \"equatorial plane,\"\r\nand this brings the Staurosphærida near {57}to the #Discoidea#, mainly to\r\nthose which also bear on the periphery of the circular equatorial plane\r\nfour crossed spines (such as _Staurodisculus_, _Stethostaurus_,\r\n_Staurodictya_, &c.). But in these cruciform #Discoidea# the shell and the\r\nenclosed central capsule are discoidal or lenticular, whilst in the\r\nStaurosphærida they remain spherical. Commonly the cross is quite regular,\r\nwith four right angles and four equal beams; but often also it becomes more\r\nor less irregular. In some genera one pair of equal opposite spines is\r\nlarger than the other pair. These forms represent the three different axes\r\nof the rhombic crystal system, whilst the common regular Staurosphærida\r\nrepresent those of the quadratic crystal system. The latter can be derived\r\nfrom the Cubosphærida (representing the regular crystal system) by\r\nreduction of one axis and loss of its pair of spines. In general the number\r\nof species (and particularly of the individuals) is much smaller in the\r\nStaurosphærida than in all other families of #Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\nThe #Stylosphærida# (Pls. 13-17) can be derived from the Cubosphærida by\r\nreduction of two dimensive axes and loss of two pairs of spines. Therefore,\r\nhere one pair of spines only is developed, opposite in one single axis.\r\nThis \"monaxonial\" form brings the Stylosphærida very near to the\r\nellipsoidal #Prunoidea# (mainly to many two-spined forms of Ellipsida and\r\nDruppulida); but they differ from these by the spherical (not ellipsoidal)\r\nform of the central capsule and of the enclosing lattice-shell. In the\r\ngreater part of the Stylosphærida both spines are of equal size and form,\r\naccurately opposite in the \"main axis.\" But in many forms both spines\r\nbecome unequal in size or form, often very different. More rarely they are\r\nnot accurately opposed, but placed in two different axes, intersecting at a\r\nsmall variable angle. The small group of Saturnalida presents a very\r\nremarkable and peculiar structure, in which both spines (at equal distances\r\nfrom the centre) are united by a circular or elliptical ring (Pl. 13, figs.\r\n15, 16; Pl. 16, figs. 16, 17).\r\n\r\nThe #Astrosphærida# are distinguished from the other #Sphæroidea# by the\r\ngreat and variable number of their external radial spines (Pls. 11, 18-20,\r\n26-30). Commonly this number amounts to from twelve to twenty, rarely to\r\nonly eight to ten, very often to thirty-two to forty or more; in many\r\nspecies more than one hundred are present. As already mentioned above, it\r\nwould be important to distinguish between primary spines (as outer\r\nprolongations of the inner radial beams) and secondary spines (developed\r\nfrom the surface of the shell), but in many cases this distinction is\r\ndifficult or impossible. More practical is the distinction between larger\r\n\"main spines\" and smaller \"by-spines.\" The size and form of the radial\r\nspines is extremely variable. Much more important is their number and\r\ndisposition. In general we can here distinguish the following different\r\ncases:--(A) radial spines are developed from all the nodal points of the\r\nnetwork on the shell surface; (B) the number of the spines is smaller than\r\nthat of the nodal points, but they are irregularly scattered; (C) the\r\nradial spines exhibit a limited number and a certain regular disposition.\r\nIn this latter case the following modes of distribution seem to be the most\r\nimportant:--(_a_) eight spines placed in the four diagonal axes of the\r\n{58}regular cube (Pl. 18, figs. 1-3); (_b_) twelve spines (placed in the\r\ncorner axes of the regular icosahedron); (_c_) fourteen spines (six placed\r\nin the three dimensive axes of the regular octahedron, eight in the centres\r\nof its eight faces); (_d_) twenty spines (placed either in the same order\r\nas in many #Larcoidea# and ACANTHARIA [?], or in the twenty corners of the\r\nregular dodecahedron); (_e_) thirty-two spines (twelve placed in the twelve\r\ncorners of the regular icosahedron, twenty in the centre of its triangular\r\nfaces). Besides these most important and quite geometrical modes of\r\ndisposition there also seem to occur in the Astrosphærida the following\r\nsubregular (or symmetrical?) modes: 9, 10, 16, 18, 24, 40, 60, 80. But it\r\nis very difficult to give a correct account of these modes. In every case\r\nthis manifold and regular disposition of the radial spines is of the\r\nhighest interest for the study of general \"Promorphology.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ is in all #Sphæroidea# (without any exception) a\r\nperfect sphere in the geometrical sense, even in those forms in which the\r\nenclosing lattice-shell is more or less irregular (_i.e._, many\r\nCollosphærida). This is the most important character, which separates the\r\n#Sphæroidea# from all other #Sphærellaria#. For in the #Prunoidea# the\r\ncapsule is ellipsoidal, with one prolonged axis; in the #Discoidea#\r\nlenticular, with one shortened axis; in the #Larcoidea# lentelliptical,\r\nwith three different dimensive axes. The central capsule is originally\r\nalways enclosed by the lattice-shell; but in many cases with increasing\r\ngrowth this relation becomes inverted; the capsule sending out many\r\nclub-shaped blind sacs through the meshes of the lattice-shell, and these\r\nmelting together outside the latter, a new membrane is formed, enclosing a\r\n\"medullary shell.\"\r\n\r\n_The Nucleus_ of the cell exhibits a very different shape in the solitary\r\nand the social #Sphæroidea#. In the solitary or monozoic #Sphæroidea# the\r\ncentre of the central capsule is occupied by a large spherical concentric\r\nnucleus, with or without nucleoli; also this nucleus is originally always\r\nwithin the innermost lattice-shell, but with increasing size may overgrow\r\nand enclose it. A short time before the formation of the vibratile spores\r\nthe central nucleus becomes resolved into many small nuclei. In the social\r\nor polyzoic #Sphæroidea#--the Collosphærida--commonly the simple central\r\nnucleus very early (a long time before the formation of the spores) is\r\ndivided into a great number of small nuclei, whilst the centre of the\r\ncapsule becomes filled with a large oil-globule. Therefore we find the same\r\ndifference between the solitary and social forms in the #Sphæroidea# as in\r\nthe #Colloidea#. Here also the calymma, or the jelly-mantle, enveloping the\r\ncentral capsule, is in the social forms very large and voluminous,\r\ndifferentiated into alveoles, whilst in the solitary forms it is much\r\nsmaller, without alveoles.\r\n\r\n{59}_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\n                 { A.

ASTROSPHÆRIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily V. #LIOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel, 1881.\r\n\r\n_Liosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# without radial spines on the surface of the\r\nspherical shell; living solitary (not associated in colonies).\r\n\r\nThe family #Liosphærida# comprises all those solitary #Sphæroidea# in which\r\nthe surface of the spherical shell is not armed with radial spines. Nearly\r\nthe half of this large group is formed by the Ethmosphærida, in which the\r\ncarapace is a quite simple, spherical lattice-shell; this subfamily is\r\nprobably the common ancestral group from which all other #Sphæroidea#, or\r\neven all #Sphærellaria#, can be derived in a phylogenetical as well as in a\r\nmorphological sense. The central capsule in this first subfamily is\r\nconstantly enclosed by the fenestrated shell, and separated from it by the\r\njelly-veil. The shell is therefore an extracapsular or medullary shell.\r\n\r\nTo these simple Ethmosphærida all other subfamilies can be opposed as\r\n\"Liosphærida concentrica,\" as their carapace is composed of two or more\r\nconcentric lattice-shells; two in the Carposphærida, three in the\r\nThecosphærida, four in the Cromyosphærida, five or more in the\r\nCaryosphærida. In all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are\r\nsimple (not spongy) fenestrated shells. In a sixth subfamily, in the\r\nPlegmosphærida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of spongy\r\nwicker-work, with or without a latticed medullary shell in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe internal radial beams, in the \"Liosphærida composita\" connecting the\r\nconcentric spheres, exhibit in their number and disposition similar\r\nimportant differences, such as the external radial spines in the\r\nAstrosphærida. The following eight {60}different cases of regular\r\ndisposition were observed:--(A) two opposite beams in one axis; (B) four\r\nbeams, opposite in pairs in two axes perpendicular one to another; (C) six\r\nbeams, opposite in pairs in the three dimensive axes; (D) eight beams,\r\nopposite in pairs in the four diagonals of the regular cube; (E) twelve\r\nbeams corresponding to the twelve axes of the regular icosahedron; (F)\r\nfourteen beams quite regularly disposed (six corresponding to the three\r\naxes of the regular octahedron, eight to the central points of its faces);\r\n(G) twenty beams (probably corresponding to the twenty corners of a regular\r\ndodecahedron); (H) thirty-two beams, regularly disposed. Rarely the number\r\nof the radial beams is intermediate between these eight cases, and rarely\r\nit is higher; then commonly the disposition is irregular. The regularity of\r\ntheir disposition in the great majority of cases is very remarkable and\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Liosphærida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Akad.\r\nd. Wiss. Berlin, p. 237.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with one single latticed sphere, with simple\r\nshell-pores (not prolonged into free tubuli) and with simple shell-cavity\r\n(without internal radial beams).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cenosphæra_ is the most simple form of all SPHÆROIDEA, and may\r\nbe regarded as the common ancestral form of this order. The siliceous\r\nlatticed shell, in which the central capsule is enclosed, represents a\r\nsimple regular sphere, with simple cavity. The pores of the shell-wall are\r\nsimple, not prolonged into radial tubuli (as in _Ethmosphæra_ and\r\n_Sethosphæra_). According to the different form of the pores, the numerous\r\nspecies of this genus can be disposed in four different subgenera. Some\r\nspecies may be easily confounded with isolated shells of the corresponding\r\nsocial _Collosphæra_; but in this latter the spherical shell-form is\r\ncommonly more or less irregular, in _Cenosphæra_ quite regular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Phormosphæra_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 448.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Pores of the shell regular or subregular, hexagonal or\r\ncircular, with hexagonal frames or lobes; all nearly of equal size and\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cenosphæra primordialis_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nShell very thin walled, smooth. Pores hexagonal, regular, or subregular;\r\ntwelve to fifteen on the half meridian of the shell; bars between them\r\nextremely delicate (only visible when three hundred or four hundred times\r\nenlarged). Diameter of the shell nine to ten times that of the meshes. This\r\nspecies is remarkable for the extreme delicacy of the arachnoidal network\r\nof the simple spherical shell; it may be regarded as the common ancestral\r\nform of all #Sphæroidea#. The shell equals that of _Heliosphæra tenuissima_\r\n(figured in my Monograph, 1862, pl. ix. fig. 2), but differs from it by the\r\nsmooth surface and the absence of all spines or thorns. I observed this\r\nspecies living in the Indian Ocean, near Ceylon, in 1882; the spherical\r\ndiameter of the central capsule is about one-third of that of the shell;\r\nthe contents of the central capsule are colourless {62}and transparent,\r\nexcept the central dark globular nucleus.

I have\r\nobserved only two, nearly identical specimens of this genus, both with\r\nregular, hexagonal pores and thin bars; the beams were implanted in the\r\ncorners of the hexagons. In one specimen the surface was covered with short\r\nradial bristles, whilst these in the other specimen were prolonged into\r\nradial spines (like _Acanthosphæra_).

Therefore both\r\nshells are here cortical shells, both separated by a distance, which is\r\nconstantly much smaller than the radius of the inner shell; whereas in\r\n_Carposphæra_ this distance is at least as large as that radius (commonly\r\nmuch larger). In _Carposphæra_ the number of pores in both shells is never\r\nthe same; in several species of _Liosphæra_ this number is the same, each\r\nouter regular hexagonal pore exactly corresponding to an inner; the six\r\ncorners of each connected by six short radial beams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Melitomma_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Pores of both shells regular, in each shell all of nearly\r\nequal size and form.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Liosphæra hexagonia_, n. sp.

Müller[45] (Pls. 5-8).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# living associated in colonies, united by an\r\nalveolar jelly-body, and connected by the network of anastomosing\r\npseudopodia.\r\n\r\nThe family #Collosphærida# comprises all polyzous or social #Sphæroidea#,\r\nand constitutes the only polyzoic group among the SPHÆRELLARIA. This group\r\nwas first constituted by J. Müller as \"_Radiolaria polyzoa_ with\r\nshells.\"[46] Formerly following his authority, in my Monograph I had\r\nseparated them from the other #Sphæroidea# and united them with the social\r\nCollodaria (Sphærozoida).[47] Also R. Hertwig in his Organismus der\r\nRadiolarien[48] united them with his Sphærozoea. In my Prodromus[49] I had\r\nretained this isolated position. But a further careful study has convinced\r\nme that this isolation is not truly natural, and that the Collosphærida are\r\nonly \"social Ethmosphærida\" which have arisen from this solitary subfamily\r\nby adaptation to colonial life. There are some forms of Collosphærida which\r\nare nearly identical with some forms of Ethmosphærida, only differing from\r\nthe latter by their association in colonies; and in some forms of both\r\ngroups it is quite impossible to decide whether the isolated shells\r\nappertain to one or to the other family.\r\n\r\nThe isolated shell of the Collosphærida is almost constantly (with few\r\nexceptions) a simple extracapsular lattice-shell, as in the Monosphærida;\r\nonly the small group of Clathrosphærida (with the genera _Clathrosphæra_\r\nand _Xanthiosphæra_) exhibit an exception, the simple lattice-shell being\r\novergrown by an external mantle or veil of very thin, cobweb-like,\r\nirregular lattice-work (Pl. 8, figs. 6-11). Therefore these Clathrosphærida\r\nbear to the Acrosphærida (or the common simple Collosphærida) a relation\r\nsimilar to that which _Liosphæra_ (p. 76) bears to _Cenosphæra_; both\r\nshells are extracapsular \"cortical shells\" at a very short distance apart.\r\nIn the Collosphærida true concentric medullary shells never occur; the\r\ncentral capsule always lies quite freely in the simple or double cortical\r\nshell, separated from it by a jelly-veil.\r\n\r\nAlthough a well marked difference in the simple lattice-shell of the social\r\nCollosphærida and the solitary Ethmosphærida does not exist, nevertheless\r\nin most cases the two shells can be distinguished by a practiced observer.\r\nThe simple fenestrated shells of the monozoic Ethmosphærida are commonly\r\nquite regular spheres in a mathematical sense, or regular \"endospherical\r\npolyhedra\"; whereas in the Collosphærida they are commonly more or less\r\nirregular, often to an extraordinary degree (Pls. 5-8). Some species of\r\nCollosphærida, however, also possess quite regular spherical shells.\r\nAnother difference is often shown in the lattice-work of the shells, which\r\nin the Collosphærida is nearly always very irregular, and exhibits a\r\npeculiar tendency to the {93}production of radial, conical, or cylindrical\r\ntubules. These occur as well on the inside as on the outside of the shell,\r\nand the tubules are now more conical, now more cylindrical; their wall\r\neither solid or pierced by pores (Pls. 5-8). The tubules are commonly very\r\nirregular in form, size, and disposition; distinguished, however, by a\r\nnumber of hereditary peculiarities, which are sufficient for the\r\ndistinction of genera. Similar tubules occur also in some genera of\r\nsolitary Ethmosphærida (_Coscinomma_, _Ethmosphæra_, _Conosphæra_, &c., Pl.\r\n12); but the tubules are here much more regular and not so highly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nBesides the tubules of the fenestrated shells, in some genera of\r\nCollosphærida the surface is armed with irregular thorns, rarely with more\r\nregular radial spines. But these spines obtain constantly the character of\r\naccessory by-spines, and remain short and thin. In this family typical\r\nradial spines never occur in a regular and characteristic disposition,\r\ncorresponding to dimensive axes, as is the case in nearly all solitary\r\n#Sphæroidea#, only excepting the Liosphærida. Commonly these spines or\r\nthorns serve as protective arms for the shell-meshes, surrounding them\r\noften in the form of coronels. Often the lattice-plate of the irregular\r\nroundish shell is tubercular, elevated into irregular protuberances,\r\nbearing on the top a short spine or thorn (Pl. 8).\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ of the Collosphærida is always a regular sphere, as\r\nin all other #Sphæroidea#; it is constantly placed within the\r\nlattice-shell, and commonly much smaller than it, separated from it by a\r\nthick jelly-veil. A remarkable difference from the solitary #Sphæroidea# is\r\nshown in the early division of the nucleus. Commonly the central capsule of\r\nthe Collosphærida contains in its centre a large oil-globule, surrounded by\r\nvery numerous small nuclei. R. Hertwig estimated this difference as so\r\nimportant, that he separated the social \"Sphærozoea\" and the solitary\r\n\"Peripylea\" as two different orders. As already shown above (p. 7, 24), we\r\ncannot support this separation, and are now convinced that this difference\r\nin the development of the spores--just as in the #Collodaria#--is the\r\nconsequence of an adaptation to social life.\r\n\r\nThe common jelly-body, in which the numerous central capsules and their\r\nenveloping shells are united, exhibits in the Collosphærida quite the same\r\ncharacters as in the other social Radiolaria, the Collozoida and\r\nSphærozoida. The jelly-body is very voluminous, commonly spherical, often\r\ncylindrical, of considerable size; constantly containing numerous large\r\nalveoles. Often each shell is enclosed in a separate alveole with rather\r\nsolid wall (Pl. 6, fig. 2). Sometimes in the dead colonies all shells are\r\nunited in the central part of the jelly-body, whilst its peripheral part is\r\ncomposed of a stratum of large alveoles (Pl. 8, fig. 11); at other times no\r\nalveoles are visible (Pl. 7, fig. 11). In many living colonies I found a\r\nvery large spherical alveole with thick wall in the centre of the spherical\r\ncolony, surrounded by many strata of delicate thin-walled alveoles (Pl. 5,\r\nfig. 1).  In this case often the inner younger capsules were naked,\r\n{94}without shells, the outer only surrounded by shells. Already in my\r\nMonograph I had described the same peculiar formation.[50]\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Collosphærida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Therefore a certain distinction between the isolated shells of the\r\ntwo genera is often very difficult or even impossible; but commonly this\r\ndistinction is possible owing to the circumstance, that in the majority of\r\nthe _Collosphæræ_ the shell is more or less irregular roundish or\r\npolyhedral, not quite spherical, as in _Cenosphæra_. _Dermatosphæra_,\r\nEhrenberg, is a _Collosphæra_ with small pores (compare L.

However, the distinction of both\r\nnearly allied groups is sometimes difficult.\r\n\r\nThe most simple Stylosphærida are the _Xiphostylida_, with one single\r\nspherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can\r\nbe opposed as \"Stylosphærida concentrica,\" as their carapace is composed of\r\ntwo or more concentric lattice-shells: two in the Sphærostylida, three in\r\nthe Amphistylida, four in the Cromyostylida, five or more in the\r\nCaryostylida. In all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are\r\nsimple (not spongy) fenestrated spheres. In a sixth subfamily, in the\r\nSpongostylida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of a spongy\r\nirregular wicker-work, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.\r\n\r\nBoth the radial spines in all Stylosphærida are opposed normally in one\r\naxis; but in many species besides the normal form occur individual\r\nabnormalities, in which the two spines are not accurately opposed in this\r\nmain axis, but placed in two different axes, intersecting at a smaller or\r\nlarger angle. In the majority of the Stylosphærida both opposite spines\r\nhave the same size and form; but in some genera they are more or less\r\ndifferent, often in a very striking degree. The same differences occur in\r\nthe nearly allied groups of #Prunoidea#, in the Ellipsida and Druppulida.\r\n\r\nThe distal ends of both spines are commonly free; but in the small group of\r\nSaturnalida (_Saturnalis_ with one single shell, _Saturnulus_ with two\r\nconcentric shells, _Saturninus_ with three concentric shells) the distal\r\nends of both spines are united, at equal distances from the centre, by a\r\ncircular or elliptical ring. This remarkable peculiarity occurs in no other\r\ngroup of #Sphæroidea#, and consequently brings the Saturnalida into close\r\nrelation with the #Discoidea#.\r\n\r\n{122}_Synopsis of the Genera of Stylosphærida._\r\n\r\n                  {              {Both spines\r\n                  {Polar spines  { equal,      45. _Xiphosphæra_.\r\n                  { free, without{\r\n  I.

By these \"two main axes\" an equatorial plane\r\nis determined, which approximates them to the #Discoidea#. But in the\r\nlatter the shells as well as the central capsule become more or less\r\nflattened, lenticular, or discoidal, whilst in the former they remain\r\nspherical. However, some forms of both groups are very similar, and\r\ninspection from different sides (and mainly from the margin of the\r\nequatorial plane) is required to determine the spherical (not compressed)\r\nshell-form of the Staurosphærida. As a rule the species of this family are\r\nmuch rarer, and much less numerous, than those of all the other\r\n#Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\nThe most simple Staurosphærida are the Staurostylida, with one single\r\nspherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can\r\nbe opposed as \"Staurosphærida concentrica,\" since their carapace is\r\ncomposed of two or more concentric lattice-shells; two in the\r\nStaurolonchida, three in the Stauracontida, four in the Staurocromyida,\r\nfive or more in the Staurocaryida. In all these four subfamilies the\r\nconcentric shells are simple (not spongy) fenestrated spheres. In a sixth\r\nsubfamily, in the Staurodorida, the shell is wholly or partially composed\r\nof irregular spongy wickerwork, with or without a medullary shell in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n_The Four Radial Spines_ in all Staurosphærida are normally opposed in\r\npairs in two axes perpendicular one to another, and therefore together form\r\na rectangular cross. But in many species besides this normal form\r\nindividual abnormalities occur, in which the four spines in the equatorial\r\nplane are not quite accurately opposed, so that the four angles between\r\nthem are not right angles, but more or less unequal. More rarely also their\r\nposition in the equatorial plane is not accurately retained, so that they\r\nare placed in two, three, or four different meridian planes, intersecting\r\nat very small variable angles.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of Staurosphærida all four radial spines are quite\r\nequal, and of the same size and form. But in some genera there takes place\r\na more or less considerable differentiation of the four spines, commonly in\r\npairs, so that the two opposite spines of each pair are equal, but the\r\npairs different (_Staurostylus_, _Staurolonchidium_). More rarely also both\r\nspines of one pair become unequal, whilst those of the other pair remain\r\nequal (_Stauroxiphos_). Very rarely all four spines assume a different size\r\nor form.\r\n\r\n\r\n{152}_Synopsis of the Genera of Staurosphærida._\r\n\r\n  I.

These three axes are\r\nthe typical \"dimensive axes,\" which are more or less differentiated in the\r\n#Larcoidea#. But in these latter the shell itself and the enclosed central\r\ncapsule become affected by the unequal growth in the three axes, whilst in\r\nthe former the capsule constantly, and commonly also the shell, remains\r\nspherical. Sometimes the shell assumes the form of a regular octahedron,\r\nfrom the six corners of which arise the six radial spines, indicating its\r\nthree axes.\r\n\r\nThe most simple Cubosphærida are the Hexastylida, with one single,\r\nspherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can\r\nbe opposed as \"Cubosphærida concentrica,\" as their carapace is composed of\r\ntwo or more concentric lattice-shells--two in the Hexalonchida, three in\r\nthe Hexacontida, four in the Hexacromyida, five or more in the Hexacaryida.\r\nIn all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are simple (not\r\nspongy), fenestrated spheres. In a sixth subfamily, in the Hexadorida, the\r\nshell is wholly or partially composed of irregular, spongy wicker-work or\r\nloose reticulations, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe _Six Radial Spines_ of the Cubosphærida are normally opposite in pairs\r\nin the three dimensive axes, each of which is perpendicular to the other\r\ntwo. But in many species besides this normal form occur individual\r\nabnormalities, in which the six spines are not quite accurately opposed,\r\nbut more or less divergent; and often also the three dimensive planes\r\n(determined each by two axes) are not quite regular, but more or less\r\nuneven. More rarely the six spines appear disposed in quite an irregular\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of the Cubosphærida all six spines are quite equal, of\r\nthe same size and form. But in some genera a more or less considerable\r\ndifferentiation takes place, so {170}that two pairs or all three pairs of\r\nspines become different; very rarely, also both spines of one pair become\r\nunequal (probably only an individual abnormality). Those variations\r\ncorrespond to the differences between the crystalline systems. The common\r\nCubosphærida, with three equal spine-pairs, correspond to the regular or\r\ncubic system, with three equal axes. The rarer forms (_Hexastylarium_,\r\n_Hexaloncharium_, _Hexacontarium_) exhibit two equal pairs and one\r\ndifferent pair; they correspond to the quadratic system, with three\r\nperpendicular axes, two of which are equal, the third unequal. Still more\r\nrare are those forms (_Hexastylidium_, _Hexalonchidium_), in which all\r\nthree pairs of spines are different, corresponding to the three unequal\r\naxes of the rhombic crystalline system.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cubosphærida._\r\n\r\n                  {All six radial spines simple,\r\n  I.

The extreme\r\nvariability and richness of form in this family is mainly due to the\r\ndifferent size, shape, and disposition of these radial spines.\r\n\r\nThe simplest Astrosphærida are the Coscinommida, with a single spherical or\r\npolyhedral lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can\r\nbe opposed as \"Astrosphærida composita,\" since their skeleton is composed\r\nof two or more concentric lattice-shells: two in the Haliommida, three in\r\nthe Actinommida, four in the Cromyommida, five or more in the Caryommida.\r\nIn these four subfamilies the concentric shells are all simple (not spongy)\r\nfenestrated spheres or endospherical polyhedra. In the sixth subfamily, the\r\nSpongiommida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of spongy irregular\r\nwicker-work, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.\r\n\r\n_The Number of the Radial Spines_ in the Astrosphærida is extremely\r\nvariable, and ranges from eight to forty or more; in many cases more than\r\none hundred. Often each nodal-point of the network develops on the shell\r\nsurface one spine. Still more frequently the number of the spines is less\r\nthan that of the nodal-points. In all concentric Astrosphærida, having two\r\nor more concentrical shells, we can distinguish \"primary spines,\" as outer\r\nprolongations of the inner radial beams connecting the shells, and\r\n\"secondary spines,\" developed only on the outer surface of the shell.\r\nNaturally the former are of much greater importance than the latter. But we\r\ncan also often distinguish among the latter larger \"main spines\" and\r\nsmaller \"by-spines,\" the latter commonly much more numerous than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n_The Disposition of the Radial Spines_, either regular or irregular, is a\r\nsubject of great morphological interest, and remains to be exhausted by\r\nfurther observations. The following cases of regular disposition have been\r\nobserved by me--(A) eight spines, opposite in pairs in four axes\r\ncorresponding to the four diagonal axes of a cube; (B) nine spines,\r\nregularly disposed at equal distances (?) (not opposed in pairs); (C) ten\r\nspines, disposed at equal distances (?); (D) twelve spines, regularly\r\ndisposed, corresponding to the twelve corners of the regular icosahedron;\r\n(E) fourteen spines, quite regularly disposed (six corresponding to the\r\nthree axes of a regular octahedron, eight to the central points of its\r\neight faces); (F) sixteen spines, regularly disposed (?); (G) twenty spines\r\n(very common!), either disposed in the same manner (after the law of\r\nJohannes Müller) as in the ACANTHARIA (?), or corresponding to the twenty\r\ncorners of the regular or pentagonal dodecahedron, or disposed in the same\r\nmanner as in many #Larcoidea# (Tholonida, &c., to be described afterwards);\r\n(H) twenty-four spines, regularly disposed (?); (I) thirty-two spines,\r\nquite regularly disposed (twenty corresponding to the twenty corners of the\r\nregular dodecahedron, twelve to the central points of its twelve faces);\r\n(K) forty spines, nearly regularly (or quite symmetrically?) disposed. If\r\nthe number of the spines amounts to more than forty, it is as a rule\r\nimpossible to determine their regular disposition in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n{208}_Synopsis of the Genera of Astrosphærida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The inner spherical\r\nshell of all Diplosphærida is composed of very delicate beams and large\r\npores, which are either regular hexagonal or irregular polygonal (never\r\nroundish). From its surface arise a variable number (twenty to thirty) of\r\nstout long radial spines, which are invariably longer than the shell\r\ndiameter (often two to three times as long or more), and of three-sided\r\nprismatic form, the three edges either smooth or serrate, often with three\r\nrows of lateral branches (commonly three to five branches in each row); the\r\nlatter are invariably of the same form, concavely curved towards the spine,\r\nand decrease in size towards the distal end. From the three edges of each\r\nmain spine in all Diplosphærida, at equal distances from the centre, arise\r\nsix very thin, thread-like lateral branches (a pair from each edge) and\r\nconnect the spine in a tangential direction with all neighbouring spines.\r\nIn this manner the polyhedral outer shell is formed, the meshes of which\r\ntherefore are always very large and triangular. Sometimes each of these\r\nprimary triangular meshes becomes filled up with a secondary network,\r\neither of regular quadrangular or of irregular polygonal secondary meshes.\r\nBesides the constant twenty to thirty large main spines, in the majority of\r\nDiplosphærida bristle-shaped radial by-spines arise, either from the inner\r\nshell (_Diplosphæra_) or from the outer (_Drymosphæra_), or from both\r\n(_Astrosphæra_). They are absent only in _Leptosphæra_. Commonly the\r\nby-spines are simple, rarely forked or branched. The central capsule in the\r\nDiplosphærida is usually enclosed in the inner shell; often it completely\r\nfills up the latter, or drives out a cæcal protuberance through each mesh;\r\nbut these processes rarely unite outside. The average size of the\r\nDiplosphærida, which are all pelagic organisms, is much larger than that of\r\nthe other Haliommida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Leptosphærella_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Radial spines simple, without lateral branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Leptosphæra hexagonalis_, n. sp.

Fundamental form monaxon, usually with the poles\r\nof the prolonged dimensive main axis equal.\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Prunoidea# comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the\r\nfenestrated spherical shell appears prolonged into one axis. The geometric\r\nfundamental form of the shell, which in the #Sphæroidea# was a sphere, in\r\nthis case therefore becomes an ellipsoid, and whilst in the former all axes\r\noriginally have the same value (Homaxonia), {285}here one main axis is\r\nconstantly larger than all other axes (Monaxonia). Usually both poles of\r\nthis main axis are equal (Haplopola); but in some genera both poles become\r\ndifferent (Diplopola).\r\n\r\nIn the #Sphæroidea# all planes going through the centre of the shell are\r\ncircular, whereas in the #Prunoidea# only those planes are circular which\r\nare perpendicular to the main axis; all other planes going through the\r\ncentre are elliptical; the largest of these are the meridian planes, in\r\nwhich is situated the main axis. Commonly all meridian planes are equal, as\r\nno transverse axes (or cross axes) are differentiated.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862) only very few forms of #Prunoidea#, such as\r\n_Didymocyrtis_ and _Spongurus_, are described, and the greater part of them\r\nare distributed under different genera of #Sphæroidea#, such as _Haliomma_\r\nand _Actinomma_. In my Prodromus (1881) I separated them as the family\r\nZygartida (p. 462). But it seems now much more convenient to restrict this\r\nterm to a particular family and to give a wider extension to the whole\r\nsuborder under the name #Prunoidea# (called after the characteristic\r\nellipsoidal form of a plum, or _Prunus_, with its stone).\r\n\r\nThe suborder #Prunoidea# comprises seven different families, of which the\r\nEllipsida constitutes the simplest and the probable common ancestral group.\r\nIn all Ellipsida the fenestrated shell is simple, and never composed of\r\nconcentric or twin shells. In their primitive genus _Cenellipsis_, the\r\nwhole shell is geometrically nothing more than a simple ellipsoid (Pl. 39,\r\nfigs. 1, 2). By development of radial spines it passes into _Ellipsidium_,\r\nby development of spongy framework into _Spongellipsis_. In the greater\r\npart of this family large spines are developed on both poles of the main\r\naxis of the shell, but sometimes instead of these solid spines, two\r\nopposite hollow fenestrated tubes are developed (_Pipettella_, Pl. 39, fig.\r\n6).\r\n\r\nThe second family of #Prunoidea#, the Druppulida, is much richer in\r\ndifferent forms than the simple Ellipsida. In this case the ellipsoidal\r\nshell is composed of two or three (rarely more) concentric shells.\r\nConstantly one or two of these fenestrated shells are enclosed in the\r\ncentral capsule, and may therefore be called \"medullary shells\"; and one or\r\ntwo (rarely more) lie outside the central capsule, \"cortical shells.\" The\r\ninner medullary shells (one or two) are either spherical or ellipsoidal;\r\nthe outer cortical shells (one or two, rarely more) are always ellipsoidal.\r\nAll concentric shells are connected by radial beams. In the simplest form\r\nof the subfamily, _Druppula_ (Pl. 39, fig. 3), one medullary shell is\r\nconnected with one cortical shell. By duplication of the medullary shell\r\narises _Prunulum_ (Pl. 39, fig. 4), and by duplication or multiplication of\r\nthe cortical shell _Cromyodruppa_ (Pl. 15, figs. 1-4) is formed. In by far\r\nthe greater portion of this subfamily large spines are developed on both\r\npoles of the main axis of the cortical shell (Pls. 16, 17), but sometimes\r\nalso instead of these solid spines two opposite hollow fenestrated tubes\r\nare developed (_Pipetta_, Pl. 39, figs. 7, 8).\r\n\r\n{286}A third family of #Prunoidea#, closely allied to the two preceding\r\nfamilies, is the Spongurida, in which we include all #Prunoidea# with an\r\nellipsoidal or cylindrical, unjointed shell, in which the lattice-work of\r\nthe cortical shell is transformed into an irregular, siliceous framework.\r\nIn the simplest form, _Spongellipsis_, the simple lattice-shell of\r\n_Cenellipsis_ is substituted by an external spongy envelope. In other cases\r\n(_Spongurus_ and allied genera) the whole cavity of this external spongy\r\nshell is distended with a fine spongy framework. The subfamily of\r\nSpongodruppida is distinguished by the possession of a simple or double\r\nlatticed medullary shell; this lies in the midst of the central capsule,\r\nand is connected by radial beams (perforating its membrane) with the\r\nenveloping spongy cortical shell. The surface of the latter may bear either\r\nradial spines, or two opposite strong polar spines, at the poles of the\r\nmain axis (Pl. 17, fig. 12).\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the Ellipsida and Druppulida are two other families of\r\nthe #Prunoidea#, the Artiscida and Cyphinida, which differ from the former\r\nby a circular constriction in the equatorial plane of the ellipsoidal\r\nshell; and in this way assume a characteristic twin form, like a figure of\r\neight. In the Artiscida the shell is simple (as in the Ellipsida), whereas\r\nin the Cyphinida it is composed of two or more concentric shells (as in the\r\nDruppulida). The simplest form of the Artiscida is _Artiscus_ (Pl. 39, fig.\r\n9), differing from _Cenellipsis_ in the ring-shaped, equatorial\r\nconstriction. In other Artiscida polar appendages are developed on both\r\npoles of the main axis, either in the form of solid, strong spines\r\n(_Stylartus_), or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Cannartus_, Pl. 39, fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThe family Cyphinida differs from the Druppulida in the equatorial\r\nconstriction of the shell, and from the Artiscida in the presence of two or\r\nmore concentric shells. One or two of these concentric fenestrated shells\r\nare enclosed in the central capsule (and therefore may be called \"medullary\r\nshells\"); the others (one or two, rarely more) lie outside of the central\r\ncapsule (therefore \"cortical shells\"). The internal \"medullary shells\" are\r\nalways spherical or somewhat lenticular, compressed from both sides; the\r\nexternal \"cortical shells\" have constantly a ring-like constriction in the\r\nequatorial plane, and \"twin-shells\" are therefore like a figure of eight.\r\nThe simplest form of this subfamily is _Cyphanta_, composed of a simple\r\nmedullary shell and a simple cortical shell, the two being connected in the\r\nequatorial plane by radial beams. In Cyphonium (Pl. 39, fig. 12) the\r\nmedullary shell is doubled, and in _Cypassis_ (Pl. 39, fig. 13) the\r\ncortical shell likewise. On both poles of the main axis strong spines are\r\noften developed (_Cyphinus_, Pl. 39, fig. 14), or hollow fenestrated tubes\r\n(_Cannartidium_, Pl. 39, figs. 16-19).\r\n\r\nThe equatorial constriction of the ellipsoidal shell, which characterises\r\nthe Artiscida and Cyphinida, is repeated or multiplied in the two following\r\nfamilies, in the Panartida and Zygartida; in the former we find three\r\nring-like strictures, in the latter five or more (lying in parallel\r\ntransverse planes); therefore the fenestrated shell is composed in the one\r\ninstance of four chambers, in the other of six or {287}more; all the\r\nchambers form a single series and have a common main axis. All\r\nconstrictions lie in planes parallel to the equatorial plane of the\r\noriginal ellipsoid; in the centre of the latter constantly lies a double\r\n\"medullary shell,\" composed of two concentric, either spherical or\r\nlenticular, compressed shells. In all Panartida we call the two inner\r\nchambers (on both sides of the equatorial constriction) \"proximal\r\nchambers,\" the two outer chambers (on the poles of the main axis) \"distal\r\nchambers.\" The four-chambered cortical shell of the Panartida is either\r\nsimple (in _Panartus_, Pl. 40, figs. 1-4) or double, with an external\r\nmantle (as in _Peripanartus_, Pl. 40, figs. 5-7). The simplest form of the\r\nsubfamily is _Panartus_ (_loc. cit._). In this case also on both poles of\r\nthe main axis may be developed solid spines, or hollow fenestrated tubes\r\n(_Panarium_, Pl. 40, fig. 9).\r\n\r\nThe seventh and last family of the #Prunoidea#, the Zygartida is most\r\nnearly allied to the Panartida, and appears as a further developmental step\r\nfrom that family. Whilst in the Panartida the cortical shell is constantly\r\nfour-chambered, with three parallel ring-like constrictions, in the\r\nZygartida it is always prolonged and composed of six or more chambers,\r\nseparated by five or more ring-shaped constrictions, in the middle of which\r\nis the equatorial stricture. In the centre of the latter (as also in the\r\nPanartida) always lies the double medullary shell, composed of two\r\nconcentric, spherical, or lenticular shells. The number of the chambers of\r\nthe cortical shells is commonly six or eight (with five to seven ring\r\nstrictures), but it often mounts to ten and sometimes to twenty (with\r\nnineteen strictures), as in some species of _Zygartus_ (Pl. 40, fig. 13).\r\nAll the chambers lie in one series, one behind another, with a common main\r\naxis. The cortical shell is usually simple (in _Ommatocampe_, Pl. 40, fig.\r\n10), sometimes double (in _Desmocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 12), rarely triple (in\r\nZYGOCAMPE, Pl. 40, fig. 13). In all three cases hollow fenestrated tubes\r\nmay be developed on the poles of the main axis.\r\n\r\nThe morphological references and the phylogenetic affinities of all\r\n#Prunoidea# are so complex, that they seem to represent a quite natural\r\ngroup; all forms of it may be derived from the common ancestral form\r\n_Cenellipsis_. But a far more difficult question is the manner in which its\r\npedigree may be constructed. The oldest family is probably the simplest,\r\nnamely, Ellipsida. From this the Druppulida may be derived by production of\r\nmedullary shells, the Artiscida by equatorial constriction. The Cyphinida\r\ncan be produced either from the Druppulida by equatorial constriction or\r\nfrom the Artiscida by development of medullary shells. The Panartida appear\r\nas further developmental steps of the Cyphinida, by duplication of the\r\nchamber number; and the Zygartida as further productions of the Panartida,\r\nby increasing the number of the chambers.\r\n\r\nThe seven subfamilies of the #Prunoidea# can be arranged in two sections\r\naccording to the presence or absence of medullary shells. The Ellipsida,\r\nSpongellipsida, and Artiscida possess a simple cortical shell, without a\r\nmedullary shell; they represent the {288}section Cenoprunida. All other\r\nfamilies possess medullary shells, and so represent the section\r\nCoccoprunida.\r\n\r\nAnother character, which can be employed in the arrangement of the seven\r\nsubfamilies in some larger groups, is the presence or absence of ring-like\r\nconstrictions, by which the cortical shell is divided into chambers. I. The\r\nMonoprunida comprise all forms without any constriction, of which the\r\nEllipsida are without a medullary shell, the Druppulida with one or two\r\nmedullary shells, and the Spongurida with a spongy cortical shell. II. The\r\nDyoprunida contain all forms with a cortical twin shell, or with two\r\nchambers separated by one equatorial constriction, of which the Artiscida\r\nare without a medullary shell and the Cyphinida have one or two medullary\r\nshells. III. The Polyprunida comprise all forms with several (three or\r\nmore) constrictions, which separate four or more chambers, of which the\r\nPanartida have three constrictions and four chambers, and the Zygartida\r\nfive or more constrictions and six or more chambers.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the #Prunoidea# is originally ellipsoidal\r\n(monaxial), and preserves this form in the greater part of the genera. In\r\nsome groups, where the axis of the ellipsoid is much prolonged, it passes\r\nover to the cylindrical form (with hemispherical vaultings on both poles),\r\nas in _Spongurus_ and _Spongocore_, in many Panartida and Zygartida. Very\r\noften the ellipsoidal or cylindrical capsule gets annular transverse\r\nconstrictions, corresponding to those of the enveloping cortical shell (one\r\nsingle, equatorial stricture in the Artiscida and Cyphinida, three\r\nstrictures in the Panartida, five or more in the Zygartida). In the\r\nCenoprunida (Ellipsida and Artiscida, also in _Spongellipsis_) the central\r\ncapsule lies freely in the cavity of the cortical shell, separated from its\r\ninner surface by the jelly-envelope; in all other groups it contains a part\r\nof the skeleton, the medullary shell and the beams which connect it with\r\nthe enveloping cortical shell.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of_ #Prunoidea#.\r\n\r\n                         {a.

Central capsule ellipsoidal or cylindrical,\r\nwithout annular equatorial constriction.\r\n\r\nThe family #Ellipsida# comprises the simplest forms of #Prunoidea#, and\r\nprobably represents the ancestral forms of this whole suborder. The\r\nfenestrated shell, which encloses the ellipsoidal central capsule, is a\r\nperfectly simple \"cortical shell\" of the same form, without enclosed\r\n\"medullary shell.\" Its form is commonly a regular monaxial ellipsoid;\r\nsometimes a little modified by unequal growth of the two poles of the main\r\naxis. Two opposite large spines are often developed at these poles, or it\r\nmay be that instead of these, two hollow fenestrated tubes are present.\r\n\r\nThe ellipsoidal fenestrated shell exhibits in the regular Ellipsida all the\r\ncharacters of a geometric ellipsoid; one main axis surpasses in length all\r\nother possible axes. All sections going through this main axis are\r\n\"meridian sections,\" with elliptical periphery; all sections perpendicular\r\nto the main axis are \"transverse sections,\" with circular periphery. The\r\nlargest of these is the equatorial section, which divides the main axis\r\ninto halves. The diameter of this equatorial plane is the \"minor axis\" of\r\nthe ellipsoid.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the two axes of the ellipsoidal shell, of the major\r\nvertical or main axis and the minor horizontal or equatorial axis, is\r\ncommonly between 6 : 5 and 3 : 2. In the former case it approaches the\r\nspherical shell, from which it is derived; in the latter case it becomes\r\nalmost fusiform or cylindrical. The network of silex, constituting the\r\nshell, is constantly a simple latticed lamella, never composed of\r\nconcentric shells (as in Druppulida) or spongy (as in Spongurida). The\r\nnetwork is often very regular and elegant, in other cases irregular.\r\n\r\nThe simplest genus among the Ellipsida, and probably the common ancestral\r\nform of the whole subfamily, is the genus _Cenellipsis_, possessing a\r\nsimple ellipsoidal shell without any appendages. It is derived from\r\n_Cenosphæra_ (the simplest spherical shell) by the prolongation of one\r\naxis. _Cenellipsis_ passes over into _Ellipsidium_ by the production of\r\nradial spines on the surface (corresponding to _Heliosphæra_). _Axellipsis_\r\nis a peculiar genus differing from _Cenellipsis_ in an axial rod, which\r\ncorresponds to the minor or equatorial axis. In all other genera of the\r\nsubfamily both poles of the main axis are distinguished by peculiar polar\r\nprolongations, either hollow fenestrated tubes (as in _Pipettella_) or\r\nstrong solid spines. Both polar spines are of equal size and similar form\r\nin _Ellipsoxiphus_, unequal in _Ellipsostylus_. From the latter is derived\r\n_Lithapium_, by reduction and loss of one spine (so that only one remains);\r\n_Lithomespilus_, by production of a bunch of several spines at one pole. In\r\nthe three latter genera both poles of the main axis are unequal, in all\r\nothers equal.\r\n\r\n{290}The central capsule of the Ellipsida is in all cases ellipsoidal, and\r\noccupies the largest part of the shell, being separated from its inner\r\nsurface by a thinner or thicker jelly-mantle.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Ellipsida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Ellipsoidal shell without polar appendages (neither solid spines nor\r\n  hollow tubes at the poles of the axis).\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Surface without    {Shell cavity\r\n    radial spines.   {  simple, without\r\n                     {  an axial rod,     122. _Cenellipsis_.\r\n                     {\r\n                     {Shell cavity\r\n                     {  with a transverse\r\n                     {  axial rod,        123. _Axellipsis_.\r\n\r\n  Surface covered with radial spines,     124. _Ellipsidium_.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Ellipsoidal shell with polar appendages (either solid spines or hollow\r\n  fenestrated tubes) at the poles of the main axis.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Solid spines of    {Shell cavity\r\n    similar shape,   {  simple, without\r\n    at both poles of {  axial rods,       125. _Ellipsoxiphus_.\r\n    the main axis.   {\r\n                     {Shell cavity\r\n                     {  with a cross of\r\n                     {  axial rods,       126. _Axoprunum_.\r\n\r\n  Solid spines of    {Two polar spines\r\n    different shape, {  of different\r\n    at both poles    {  shape,            127. _Ellipsostylus_.\r\n    of the main      {\r\n    axis.            {A bunch of spines\r\n                     {  at one pole\r\n                     {  only,             128. _Lithomespilus_\r\n                     {\r\n                     {Only a single\r\n                     {  spine at one\r\n                     {  one pole,         129. _Lithapium_.\r\n\r\n  Two hollow fenestrated tubes opposite,\r\n    at the poles of the main axis,        130. _Pipettella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 122. _Cenellipsis_,[161] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition_.--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, without radial\r\nspines and without polar tubes.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cenellipsis_ is the simplest and most primitive form, not only\r\namong the Ellipsida, but also among the #Prunoidea#, and it may therefore\r\nbe regarded as the common ancestral form of the whole family.

It may therefore be derived from\r\n_Xiphosphæra_ by prolongation of the axis in which lie both polar spines;\r\nbut it may also be derived from _Cenellipsis_ by the production of two\r\nequal spines at the poles of the main axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{296}Subgenus 1. _Ellipsoxiphetta_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Network of the shell regular, with pores of equal size and\r\nsimilar form.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Ellipsoxiphus elegans_, n. sp.

Within the cavity of the shell four radial rods arise from\r\nits inner surface, two in the main axis, two in the smallest axis,\r\nperpendicular to the former; their free inner ends are at the same distance\r\nfrom the centre.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Axoprunum_ possesses precisely the same shell as the foregoing\r\n_Ellipsoxiphus_, but differs from it in a very remarkable peculiarity. The\r\ntwo polar spines are centripetally prolonged into two internal beams, and\r\nperpendicular to these are two other, opposite, transverse beams, marking\r\nthe minor axis of the ellipsoid. The free inner ends of all four radial\r\nrods bear little thickened knobs, and are at the same distance from the\r\ncentre. It therefore appears as though a central, spherical, medullary\r\nshell had been lost, and this gives a strong support to the important\r\nhypothesis, that in many #Sphærellaria#, where the medullary shell is\r\nabsent, it may have been lost by phylogenetic reduction or retrograde\r\nmetamorphosis. In this case _Axoprunum_ (and _Ellipsoxiphus_) would arise\r\nfrom _Lithatractus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Axoprunum stauraxonium_, n. sp.

The distance between two opposite\r\nbeams equals one-third of the minor axis, and indicates probably the\r\ndiameter of the lost spherical medullary shell.

Both axes of the ellipsoid bear the proportion of 3 : 2. Network of\r\nthe shell and of the tubes irregular with small rounded pores of different\r\nsize, separated by broader bars (often twice to three times as broad), four\r\nto six pores on the half equator of the shell. (This species somewhat\r\nrecalls _Solenosphæra serpentina_, Pl. 7, fig. 7; but the tubes are\r\nstraight, not contorted.)\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoid 0.2, shorter axis 0.14; length\r\nof the tubes 0.4 to 0.5, breadth 0.03; pores of the network 0.001 to 0.002,\r\nbars 0.003 to 0.004.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Central area of the Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Pipettella prismatica_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 6).\r\n\r\nShell ellipsoidal, thick walled, distinctly marked off from the two\r\nopposite tubes, which are longer than its main axis and as broad as\r\none-fifth of it; they are nearly four-sided prismatic, with four strong\r\nribs or edges; these are directed parallel to the main axis, in two\r\nmeridian planes, perpendicular to one another. The wall of the shell is\r\nthickened in the equatorial plane, so as to form a slight stricture on the\r\ninside, separating its two halves. Both axes of the ellipsoid bear the\r\nproportion of 7 : 6. Network regular, with circular pores, somewhat broader\r\nthan the bars. The meshes of the shell (fourteen to sixteen on the half\r\nequator) are twice as great as those of the tubes, which are arranged in\r\ntwo longitudinal rows between every two ribs (there being eight\r\nlongitudinal rows on the whole tube). This species is very remarkable for\r\nthe rudimentary internal equatorial stricture of the shell (transition to\r\nthe genus _Cannartus_, Pl. 39, fig. 10), and by the four edges of the\r\ntubes, which indicate two of the dimensive axes, the third being\r\nrepresented by the main axis.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoid 0.14, shorter axis 0.12; length\r\nof the tubes 0.15 to 0.16, breadth 0.03; pores of the shell 0.008 to 0.01,\r\npores of the tubes 0.004.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 225, depth 4475 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{306}Family XII. #DRUPPULIDA#, Haeckel, 1882 (Pls. 15, 16, 17, 39).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with ellipsoidal, latticed (not spongy) shell,\r\ncomposed of two or more concentric shells; a simple or double cortical\r\nshell enclosing one or two internal concentric shells (medullary shells),\r\nwithout equatorial stricture. Central capsule ellipsoidal or cylindrical,\r\nwithout annular equatorial constriction.\r\n\r\nThe family #Druppulida# differs from the Ellipsida only in the possession\r\nof a simple or double medullary shell, which is enclosed in the centre of\r\nthe central capsule, and connected with the ellipsoidal cortical shell\r\n(lying outside it) by radial beams, perforating the membrane of the\r\ncapsule. The Druppulida exhibit therefore the same relation to the\r\nEllipsida that the Dyosphærida among the #Sphæroidea# bear to the\r\nMonosphærida. The cortical shell may be simple or multiple. The whole\r\nfenestrated shell is thus composed of a variable number (two at least) of\r\nconcentric shells, which are connected by radial beams.\r\n\r\n_The Medullary Shell_--enclosed in the centre of the central capsule--is\r\neither simple or double, and composed of two small concentric shells. Their\r\nform is either spherical, or ellipsoidal, or lenticular. If the medullary\r\nshell be ellipsoidal, the main axis of the ellipsoid is the same as in the\r\ncortical shell. Sometimes the inner medullary shell is spherical, the outer\r\nellipsoidal or lenticular. If the medullary shell be lenticular (arising\r\nfrom both poles of the main axis) its vertical axis is also identical with\r\nthat of the cortical shell (Pl. 39, fig. 5).\r\n\r\n_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary and cortical shell, are\r\neither developed in all possible directions (Pls. 16, 17), or limited to\r\nthe equatorial plane, more rarely to the meridional plane. Sometimes the\r\nconnection is produced only by two opposite beams which lie in the minor or\r\nequatorial axis (Pl. 39, figs. 3, 7, 8); more rarely in the major or\r\nmeridional axis (Pl. 17, figs. 7, 8).\r\n\r\n_The Cortical Shell_ is constantly ellipsoidal, rarely with modifications,\r\nsimilar to those which appear in the simple shell of some Ellipsida. As a\r\nrule it is simple, rarely composed of two or more (sometimes six or more)\r\nconcentric ellipsoidal shells (in _Cromyodruppa_ and _Cromyocarpus_). The\r\nouter surface is commonly smooth, more rarely covered with radial spines\r\n(in _Druppocarpus_, _Prunocarpus_, &c.). In the majority peculiar polar\r\nappendages are developed at both poles of the main axis, these being\r\nprolongations of them, either in the form of hollow fenestrated tubes\r\n(_Pipetta_, _Pipettaria_, Pl. 39, figs. 7, 8), or solid strong spines. The\r\ntwo polar spines are either equal in size and similar in form (as in\r\n_Lithatractus_, _Stylatractus_) or unequal (as in _Druppatractus_,\r\n_Xiphatractus_, Pls. 16, 17).\r\n\r\nThe most primitive of all Druppulida is _Druppula_, with simple medullary\r\nshell and simple cortical shell (Pl. 39, fig. 3); _Prunulum_ differs from\r\nit only in the possession {307}of a double medullary shell (Pl. 39, fig.\r\n4). From these two genera all other forms of the subfamily may be derived.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Druppulida is constantly ellipsoidal, larger\r\nthan the concentric enclosed medullary shells, smaller than the surrounding\r\ncortical shell; it is separated from the inner surface of the latter by a\r\nthinner or thicker jelly-mantle.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Druppulida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cortical shell without polar appendages (neither solid spines nor hollow\r\n  tubes at the poles of the main axis).\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 {              {Surface\r\n                 {Medullary     { smooth,  131. _Druppula_.\r\n                 { shell simple.{\r\n                 {              {Surface\r\n  Cortical shell {              { spiny,   132. _Druppocarpus_.\r\n   simple,       {\r\n   ellipsoidal.  {              {Surface\r\n                 {Medullary     { smooth,  133. _Prunulum_.\r\n                 { shell double.{\r\n                 {              {Surface\r\n                 {              { spiny,   134. _Prunocarpus_.\r\n\r\n  Cortical shell }Medullary     {Surface\r\n   composed of   } shell        { smooth,  135. _Cromyodruppa_.\r\n   two or more   } double.      {\r\n   concentric    }              {Surface\r\n   shells.       }              { spiny,   136. _Cromyocarpus_.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Two opposite solid spines, arising from the poles of the main axis.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               {          {Both polar\r\n               {Medullary { spines equal,  137. _Lithatractus_.\r\n               { shell    {\r\n               { simple.  {Both polar\r\n  Cortical     {          { spines\r\n   shell       {          { unequal,       138. _Druppatractus_.\r\n   simple,     {\r\n   ellipsoidal.{          {Both polar\r\n               {          { spines equal,  139. _Stylatractus_.\r\n               {Medullary {\r\n               { shell    {Both polar\r\n               { double.  { spines\r\n               {          { unequal,       140. _Xiphatractus_.\r\n\r\n  Cortical shell composed of two or more\r\n   concentric shells; medullary shell\r\n   double; both polar spines equal,        141. _Cromyatractus_.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Two opposite hollow fenestrated tubes, arising from the poles of the\r\n  main axis.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Medullary shell simple,                  142. _Pipetta_.\r\n\r\n  Medullary shell double,                  143. _Pipettaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 131. _Druppula_,[170] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Druppulida# with simple ellipsoidal, cortical shell, and\r\nsimple medullary shell, without spines or polar tubes.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Druppula_, as the simplest form of the Druppulida, may be\r\nregarded as the common ancestral form of this subfamily.

Radiol., p. 447 (_sensu emendato_).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with spongy ellipsoidal or cylindrical shell,\r\ncomposed wholly or partially of a spongy framework, without equatorial\r\nstricture, with or without an enclosed medullary shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Spongurida# comprises, in the sense here restricted, all those\r\n#Prunoidea# in which the ellipsoidal or cylindrical shell is composed\r\nwholly or partially of an irregular siliceous framework, not of simple\r\nlattice-work. It contains two subfamilies, differing in the absence or\r\npresence of a latticed medullary shell in the middle of the central\r\ncapsule; in the Spongellipsida it is absent, in the Spongodruppida present;\r\nthe former are most nearly related to the Ellipsida, the latter to the\r\nDruppulida, the difference consisting only in the spongy structure of the\r\ncortical shell.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, p. 447) the family Spongurida had a much wider\r\nextent, comprising also a number of #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea#, agreeing\r\nin the spongy {340}structure of the shell. Here we restrict the definition\r\nto those spongy #Sphærellaria# in which the central capsule and the\r\nenclosing spongy cortical shell are ellipsoidal or cylindrical, therefore\r\neach transverse section is a circle, and each meridional section an\r\nellipse, as in all #Prunoidea#.\r\n\r\n_The Cortical Shell_ in all Spongurida is composed of a delicate framework\r\nof irregularly branched and interwoven siliceous threads; commonly this\r\nspongy structure is rather dense or compact, but sometimes also very loose.\r\nIn the simplest form, _Spongellipsis_, the spongy cortical shell contains a\r\nlarge cavity, in which lies freely the central capsule. In _Spongurus_ this\r\ncavity is completely distended by a spongy framework. In this case the\r\nsolid spongy shell becomes often prolonged, and its original ellipsoidal\r\nform passes over into a cylindrical one (as in many Zygartida). Sometimes\r\n(particularly in _Spongocore_, Pl. 48, fig. 6) the cylinder becomes\r\nthree-jointed by two more or less distinct annular constrictions.\r\n_Spongocore_ is distinguished by an outer veil, a thin lattice-lamella,\r\nwhich envelops the spongy shell and is connected with it by radial beams.\r\n\r\n_The Medullary Shell_, absent in the Spongellipsida, is constant in the\r\nsecond subfamily Spongodruppida. It is either a simple latticed shell\r\n(_Spongodruppa_) or double, composed of two concentric latticed shells\r\n(_Spongoliva_); its form is either spherical or ellipsoidal. It lies in the\r\nmiddle of the central capsule, and is connected by radial beams\r\n(perforating the membrane of the latter) with the enveloping spongy\r\ncortical shell.\r\n\r\nIn many Spongurida the surface of the shell is armed with radial spines,\r\nand in some genera (_Spongoprunum_, _Spongatractus_, &c., Pl. 17, fig. 12),\r\non both poles of the main axis, are developed two strong opposite polar\r\nspines, as in many other #Prunoidea#.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Spongurida is either ellipsoidal or\r\ncylindrical. Only in _Spongellipsis_ it lies freely in the internal cavity\r\nof the spongy shell. In all other genera it is perforated by a part of the\r\nskeleton; in the Spongodruppida it contains the simple or double medullary\r\nshell, and the radial beams which perforate its membrane and connect the\r\nlatter with the external spongy cortical shell. In _Spongurus_ and the\r\nallied genera (_Spongocore_, _Spongoprunum_) the whole central capsule is\r\nfilled with a spongy framework which also envelops its surface.\r\n\r\n{341}_Synopsis of the Genera of Spongurida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Central capsule\r\nellipsoidal, with or without equatorial stricture.\r\n\r\nThe family #Artiscida# has a simple fenestrated outer shell, like that of\r\nthe Ellipsida, but differs from these in the presence of an equatorial\r\nconstriction, by which it assumes a characteristic twin form, somewhat\r\nsimilar to a violin (Pl. 39, figs. 9, 10). From the Cyphinida, which have\r\nthe same form of the cortical shell, the Artiscida differ in the absence of\r\nthe medullary shell. It is possible that the Artiscida are descended from\r\nthe Cyphinida (by loss of the medullary shell), but it is more probable\r\nthat they arise from the Ellipsida by an annular constriction in the\r\nequatorial plane (perhaps the formation of the shell originally took place\r\nwhile the central capsule was undergoing division). Both halves of the twin\r\nshell are always of the same size and form. Its outer surface is either\r\nsmooth or covered with radial spines (_Artiscus_, Pl. 39, fig. 9).\r\nSometimes on the opposite poles of the main axis are developed solid spines\r\n(_Stylartus_, Pl. 48, fig. 5) or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Cannartus_, Pl.\r\n39, fig. 10).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ is either simply ellipsoidal, or has also an\r\nequatorial constriction, which divides it into two equal halves.

Central capsule ellipsoidal, commonly with an\r\nequatorial constriction.\r\n\r\nThe family #Cyphinida# have the same characteristic twin-form of the\r\ncortical shell as the Artiscida, but differ from them in the presence of a\r\nsimple or double internal medullary shell, connected with the cortical\r\nshell by radial beams.  The fenestrated shell is therefore composed of two\r\nor more concentric shells as in the Druppulida, but differs from these in\r\nthe ring-like equatorial constriction.\r\n\r\n_The Medullary Shell_, in the middle of the central capsule, is either\r\nsingle or double, composed of two concentric shells.  As in the Druppulida,\r\nthe form of the medullary shells is either spherical (Pl. 39, fig. 12_a_)\r\nor lenticular, compressed from both poles of the main axis (Pl. 39, fig.\r\n18_a_); sometimes the inner medullary shell is spherical, the outer\r\nlenticular.\r\n\r\n_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary shell with the equatorial\r\nconstriction of the cortical shell, lie either all in the equatorial plane\r\n(Pl. 39, fig. 11) or near it on both sides (Pl. 39, figs. 12_a_, 18_a_).\r\n\r\n{360}The _Cortical Shell_ is commonly simple (Pl. 39, figs. 12, 18),\r\nsometimes composed of two concentric shells (Pl. 39, fig. 13), rarely of\r\nthree. As in the Artiscida, also in the Cyphinida, from both poles of the\r\nmain axis solid spines or hollow fenestrated tubes are often developed (Pl.\r\n39, figs. 14, 16-18).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Cyphinida (Pl. 39, fig. 13) is of the same\r\nform as in the Artiscida, generally ellipsoidal, but with an equatorial\r\nring-like stricture, which divides it into two equal halves. It encloses\r\nthe simple or double medullary shell, and is perforated by the radial beams\r\nstarting from this. From the inner surface of the surrounding cortical\r\nshell it is separated by a thicker or thinner jelly-layer, the calymma.\r\n(Compare also Taf. xxii. fig. 14 of my Monograph, 1862.)\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Cyphinida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cortical shell without peculiar spines or hollow fenestrated tubes on\r\n  both poles of the main axis.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cortical twin-   {Medullary shell\r\n     shell simple  {  simple,        155. _Cyphanta_.\r\n                   {\r\n                   {Medullary shell\r\n                   {  double,        156. _Cyphonium_.\r\n\r\n  Cortical twin-   {Cortical shell\r\n    shell double   {  double,        157. _Cypassis_.\r\n    or triple;     {\r\n    medullary      {Cortical shell\r\n    shell double.  {  triple,        158. _Cyphocolpus_.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Cortical shell simple, with peculiar spines or hollow fenestrated tubes\r\n  on both poles of the main axis.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Two opposite     {Medullary shell\r\n    polar spines   {  simple,        159. _Cyphinus_.\r\n    (or bunches    {\r\n    of spines).    {Medullary shell\r\n                   {  double,        160. _Cyphinidium_.\r\n\r\n  Two opposite     {Medullary shell\r\n    hollow         {  simple,        161. _Cannartiscus_.\r\n    fenestrated    {\r\n    polar tubes.   {Medullary shell\r\n                   {  double,        162. _Cannartidium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 155. _Cyphanta_,[194] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and simple medullary\r\nshell, without polar spines or tubes.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cyphanta_ is the most simple of all Cyphinida, and can be\r\nregarded as the common ancestral form of this family.

Central capsule cylindrical, commonly four-jointed (with three\r\ntransverse annular constrictions).\r\n\r\nThe family #Panartida# (Pl. 40, figs. 1-9) is characterised by its\r\nfour-jointed cortical shell, constantly composed of four chambers, lying\r\none behind another in the elongated main axis. They are separated by three\r\nring-like constrictions lying in three parallel transverse planes; the\r\nmiddle of these is the equatorial plane. In the centre of this latter lies\r\nconstantly a double medullary shell.\r\n\r\nThe Panartida must be derived from the Cyphinida by further increase in the\r\nlongitudinal or main axis, and by repetition of the equatorial constriction\r\nin two transverse planes parallel to it and at an equal distance from it.\r\n\r\n{376}_The Medullary Shell_ is always double in this family, composed of two\r\nsmall concentric shells lying in the middle of the central capsule. They\r\nare either spherical or lenticular, compressed towards both poles of the\r\nmain axis; sometimes the inner is spherical, the outer lenticular. From the\r\nequatorial circumference of the latter starts a number of radial beams,\r\nwhich perforate the central capsule, and are inserted into the equatorial\r\nconstriction of the cortical shell. Commonly all radial beams lie in the\r\nequatorial plane, sometimes also a part of them on both sides of it.\r\n\r\n_The Cortical Shell_ is constantly composed of four completely latticed\r\nchambers, which are only separated by the three annular constrictions. In\r\nmany species all four chambers have the same form and size (Pl. 40, fig.\r\n3), but in the greater number of species both proximal (or central)\r\nchambers are different in size, shape, or structure from both distal (or\r\npolar) chambers. The cortical shell is either simple or double, composed of\r\ntwo concentric four-jointed shells; rarely it is triple or multiple,\r\ncomposed of three or more shells fitting one inside the other. Very often\r\nthe outer cortical shell is incomplete, and only developed around the two\r\nproximal chambers of the complete inner cortical shell, both distal\r\nchambers of the latter remaining simple.\r\n\r\nOn both poles of the main axis often are developed solid spines\r\n(_Panicium_, Pl. 40, fig. 4) or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Panarium_, Pl.\r\n40, fig. 9), as in the foregoing families. Besides this, the surface of the\r\ncortical shell may be armed with spines.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Panartida is always cylindrical, on both poles\r\nhemispherical; commonly it is more or less distinctly four-jointed, with\r\nthree ring-like constrictions corresponding to those of the enclosing\r\ncortical shell. From the inner surface of the latter it is separated by a\r\nthinner or thicker jelly-mantle.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Panartida._\r\n\r\n  On both poles of the main { Cortical shell simple,   163. _Panartus_.\r\n    axis neither peculiar   {\r\n    polar spines nor        { Cortical shell double or\r\n    fenestrated tubes.      {   triple,                164. _Peripanartus_.\r\n\r\n  On both poles of the main { Cortical shell simple,   165. _Panicium_.\r\n    axis a large apical     {\r\n    spine or a group of     { Cortical shell double or\r\n    polar spines.           {   triple,                166. _Peripanicium_.\r\n\r\n  On both poles of the main { Cortical shell simple,   167. _Panarium_.\r\n    axis a conical or       {\r\n    cylindrical fenestrated { Cortical shell double or\r\n    tube.                   {   triple,                168. _Peripanarium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 163. _Panartus_,[202] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Panartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary\r\nshell, without polar spines or tubes on both poles of the main axis.\r\n\r\n{377}The genus _Panartus_ represents the common ancestral form of all\r\nPanartida, as all other genera of this subfamily must be derived from it\r\nand are only further developmental stages, from an ontogenetic as well as\r\nfrom a phylogenetic point of view. The cortical shell of _Panartus_ is\r\nconstantly composed of four fenestrated chambers jointed to one another in\r\nthe main axis; both proximal chambers are separated from one another by the\r\nequatorial ring-like constriction, in the centre of which lies the double\r\nmedullary shell; both distal chambers are separated from the former by two\r\nother annular constrictions (in planes parallel to the equatorial plane).\r\nAll four chambers may exhibit the same (kidney-shaped) form and structure\r\n(in the subgenera _Panartella_ and _Panartoma_); or the proximal chamber\r\nmay differ more or less in shape and size from the distal (in the subgenera\r\n_Panartissa_ and _Panartura_). The outer surface of the cortical shell is\r\nsometimes smooth (as in _Panartella_ and _Panartissa_), at other times\r\nspiny or thorny (as in _Panartoma_ and _Panartura_). The double medullary\r\nshell is sometimes spherical, or commonly compressed at both poles and\r\nspheroidal or lenticular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Panartella_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Surface of the cortical shell smooth, without spines or\r\nthorns.

Central capsule cylindrical, commonly annulated\r\n(corresponding to the transverse annular constrictions of the cortical\r\nshell).\r\n\r\nThe family #Zygartida#, the seventh and last of the #Prunoidea#, comprises,\r\nin the sense here restricted, all those #Prunoidea# in which the cortical\r\nshell is annulated and composed of six to twenty or more (at least six)\r\ncameræ, lying one behind another in the elongated main axis, and separated\r\nby five or more annular constrictions. When I constituted this family in\r\n1881 (_loc. cit._), I had given to it a much wider extent, embracing all\r\nthose #Prunoidea# which exhibit annular constrictions of the cortical\r\nshell; as the number of these, in consequence of further researches, is\r\nmuch increased, it seems now more convenient to restrict the family to the\r\nextent here given.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Zygartida must be derived from the Panartida by progressive\r\ngrowth of the cortical shell in the main axis and accompanying increase of\r\nthe number of its chambers. Whilst this number in the Panartida is\r\nconstantly restricted to four, in the Zygartida it amounts to ten, twenty,\r\nor more, and is in the lowest case six (Pl. 40, fig. 10). The maximum\r\nnumber is variable in the different species, but of course also different\r\nin the various degrees of individual development. Each Zygartid is at the\r\nbeginning of its growth a Cyphinid, later a Panartid. The number of the\r\nannular constrictions separating the chambers and lying in parallel\r\ntransverse planes is at least {392}five, but may amount to nineteen, to\r\ntwenty-one or more; they lie constantly in pairs on both sides of the\r\nequatorial constriction (Pl. 40, figs. 12, 13).\r\n\r\nThe cortical shell may either remain simple (_Ommatocampe_, Pl. 40, fig.\r\n10), or become double (_Desmocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 12), or sometimes triple\r\n(_Zygocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 13).  In the latter cases the outer (secondary\r\nand tertiary) cortical shells are commonly incomplete, and only developed\r\naround the proximal chambers of the complete first (primary) cortical\r\nshell, its distal chambers remaining simple.\r\n\r\n_The Medullary Shell_ is constantly double, as in the Panartida; its form\r\nis either spherical or lenticular, compressed in the direction of the main\r\naxis.  It is always connected with the equatorial constriction of the\r\ncortical shell by a number of radial beams, lying either in the equatorial\r\nplane or on each side of it (Pl. 40, figs. 10-13).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Zygartida is constantly cylindrical; its\r\nincreasing growth on both poles of the axis corresponds to that of the\r\nincluding cortical shell. Commonly (but not always) its cylindrical surface\r\nis annulated, with five or more transverse strictures, corresponding to\r\nthose of the cortical shell. From the inner surface of the latter it is\r\nseparated by a jelly-mantle, the calymma.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Zygartida._\r\n\r\n    I.

It\r\nexhibits therefore to the latter the same relation that _Desmartus_ does to\r\n_Desmocampe_ and _Ommatartus_ to _Ommatocampe_; it differs from these by\r\nthe multiplication of the cortical shell, which is composed of at least\r\nthree concentric envelopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Zygartus doliolum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nInner cortical shell composed of six (or more) kidney-shaped chambers, all\r\nnearly of the same size and structure, every chamber with four to five\r\ntransverse rows of irregular, roundish pores, twice to four times as broad\r\nas the bars; the basal pores scarcely larger than the apical pores.

DISCOIDEA, Haeckel (Pls. 31-38, 41-48).\r\n\r\n  _Discida_ vel _Discoidea_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., pp. 56,\r\n      476.\r\n  _Discoida_, _Discoidea_, _Discida_, Haeckel, 1878, Protistenreich, p.\r\n      103.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with discoidal or lenticular central capsule\r\n(often with radial prolongations, rarely allomorphic); with discoidal or\r\nlenticular fenestrated siliceous shell (often with radial spines or\r\nfenestrated arms, rarely allomorphic). Growth reduced or diminished in the\r\ndirection of one dimensive axis.\r\n\r\nThe section #Discoidea# comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the\r\nfenestrated shell is more or less discoidal or lenticular, flattened or\r\ncompressed in the direction of one axis. The geometric fundamental form of\r\nthe latticed shell, which in the #Sphæroidea# is a sphere, here becomes a\r\nflat disk, like a medal, or a biconvex lens, sometimes also a biconcave\r\nlens. The #Discoidea# can be derived from the #Sphæroidea# by shortening of\r\none axis. This shortened vertical axis is the main axis of the disk; both\r\nits poles are constantly equal. Perpendicular to this axis is the\r\nequatorial plane of the disk by which it becomes divided into equal halves.\r\nIn the simplest forms of #Discoidea# all axes of this horizontal equatorial\r\nplane (all \"equatorial axes\" or \"cross axes\") are equal; in the most of the\r\ngenera and species these cross axes are different, so that rays of stronger\r\ngrowth (\"perradii\") alternate with rays of weaker growth (\"interradii\").\r\nThe number of these cross axes distinguishable is commonly two to four,\r\nrarely more. In the direction of these are developed either radial marginal\r\nspines or spongy arms.\r\n\r\nThe order #Discoidea# was founded in my Monograph (1862, p. 476) as the\r\nfamily \"Discida\" (Radiolaria with flat discoidal or biconvex lenticular\r\nshell), comprising the {403}\"_Calodictya_  and _Lithocyclidina_\" of\r\nEhrenberg and a great part of his \"_Haliommatina_.\" As three different\r\nsubfamilies of that family I separated the Coccodiscida (with five genera),\r\nthe Trematodiscida (with seven genera), and the Discospirida (with two\r\ngenera; Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 485). A fourth group of #Discoidea# was\r\nconstituted by the Spongodiscida (with eight genera, including the\r\n_Spongocyclida_), which at that time I united with the Spongurida, because\r\nof their spongy structure (_loc. cit._, p. 452).\r\n\r\nAs the number of fossil #Discoidea# found in the Tertiary rocks of Barbados\r\nand of the Mediterranean shores (Sicily and Greece) is comparatively very\r\nlarge, we find even in the first system of Polycystina of Ehrenberg (1847),\r\nnot less than twelve genera distinguished, viz., six _Calodictya_, two\r\n_Haliommatina_, and four _Lithocyclidina_ (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.\r\nd. Wiss. Berlin, 1847, p. 53). The whole number of Radiolarian genera\r\ndistinguished in that first system was forty-four. The diagnoses of them\r\ngiven by Ehrenberg were as usual very insufficient. The characters of the\r\nthree families given by him were the following:--_Calodictya_--\"Testarum\r\nintus spongiosarum et nucleo destitutarum orbes; _Haliommatina_--Testæ\r\nsubglobosæ nucleus radiatus; _Lithocyclidina_--Testarum disci in media\r\nparte nucleati margine celluloso.\" In the latest work of Ehrenberg (1875,\r\np. 157) the same system was repeated, but some new genera added; and\r\nthirty-eight different species, appertaining to the #Discoidea#, were\r\nfigured in the same work (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1875, Tafs.\r\nxx.-xxx.).\r\n\r\nRichard Hertwig, 1879, in his excellent work, Der Organismus der\r\nRadiolarien (pp. 57-68), gave a detailed description of the skeleton of\r\nsome #Discoidea#, and arrived at the conclusion that this whole family had\r\na spirally constructed skeleton, and should therefore be derived from the\r\nLithelida. But this conclusion is certainly erroneous, and in my opinion\r\nthe whole explanation of that spiral structure, and of its signification in\r\nthe development of #Discoidea#, is the weakest part of that otherwise very\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\nIn my Prodromus (1881, p. 456) I gave a provisional system of the #Discida#\r\nor #Discoidea# from the immense quantity of new material collected by the\r\nChallenger, and could distinguish not less than eighty-four genera. This\r\nnumber is from subsequent research only augmented by seven, so that in the\r\nfollowing pages ninety-one genera with five hundred and one species are\r\ndescribed. In the Prodromus I had disposed them in four different families,\r\nwhich number is now increased to six. These six families can be again\r\ndisposed in two main groups or sections, the #Phacodiscaria# and the\r\n#Cyclodiscaria#, each section with three families.\r\n\r\nThe #Phacodiscaria# are characterised by the possession of a typical\r\n\"phacoid shell,\" and contain the three families Cenodiscida, Phacodiscida,\r\nand Coccodiscida. On the other hand, the #Cyclodiscaria# are distinguished\r\nby the absence of such a \"phacoid shell,\" and contain the three families\r\nPorodiscida, Pylodiscida, and Spongodiscida. Both sections exhibit an\r\nanalogous development.\r\n\r\n{404}The #Cenodiscida# (Pl. 48, figs. 1-3) open the series of the\r\n#Discoidea# as their simplest forms; a discoidal or lenticular simple\r\nlattice-shell encloses a central capsule of the same form, and is separated\r\nfrom it by the calymma or jelly-veil. The common ancestral form of this\r\nfamily is _Cenodiscus_, without radial marginal spines; it can be derived\r\nfrom _Cenosphæra_ in the most simple way, by flattening in one axis. If on\r\nthe equatorial margin of the lens a peculiar solid girdle be developed, we\r\nobtain _Zonodiscus_; in all other genera of the Cenodiscida radial spines\r\nare developed on the margin. As the simple lenticular cortical shell of\r\n_Cenodiscus_, in which the central capsule is enclosed, is most\r\ncharacteristic not only of this family, but also of the two following\r\nfamilies, we call it the phacoid shell (that is, a lenticular extracapsular\r\nor cortical lattice-shell).\r\n\r\nThe #Phacodiscida# (Pls. 31-35), the second family, have the same\r\nextracapsular \"phacoid shell\" as the Cenodiscida, but differ from these by\r\nthe possession of one or two intracapsular concentric medullary shells,\r\nwhich are connected with the former by radial beams, perforating the\r\nlenticular central capsule. The radial beams are commonly numerous, and\r\narranged in two opposite bunches around the shortened main axis. But often\r\nalso besides these occur other longer radial beams, situated in the\r\nequatorial plane; the number of these is commonly four, and they form a\r\nregular rectangular cross, lying opposite in pairs in two equatorial\r\ndiameters, perpendicular one to another. In the simplest genera of this\r\nfamily (the _Sethodiscida_) the equatorial margin of the phacoid shell is\r\nsimple or surrounded by a solid smooth girdle; in all other genera are\r\ndeveloped on the margin solid radial spines lying in the equatorial plane,\r\neither regularly disposed in a somewhat constant number (two to eight,\r\n_Heliosestrida_), or irregularly disposed, in a larger and more variable\r\nnumber (ten to twenty or more, _Heliodiscida_).\r\n\r\nThe #Coccodiscida# (Pls. 36-38) form a third family of the #Discoidea#,\r\ndirectly associated with the Phacodiscida; both have the same\r\ncharacteristic extracapsular \"phacoid shell,\" which is connected by radial\r\nbeams with a simple or double, intracapsular medullary shell. But whilst in\r\nthe foregoing family the equatorial margin of the phacoid shell is simple\r\nor only armed with radial spines, in the Coccodiscida it is surrounded by\r\npeculiar concentric chambered girdles, or rings, which resemble those of\r\nthe following family, the Porodiscida. Each of these \"chambered girdles\" is\r\ncomposed of a circular ring in the equatorial plane, a variable number of\r\nradial beams dividing it into incomplete chambers, and two porous\r\ncover-plates or \"sieve-plates,\" covering the upper and lower face of the\r\ndisk. These sieve-plates may be regarded as incomplete lenticular cortical\r\nshells, which are only developed in the peripheral part of the disk, whilst\r\ntheir central part is represented by the only complete cortical shell, the\r\n\"phacoid shell.\" The number of these concentric chamber-girdles amounts to\r\nfrom one to ten or more. The margin of the disk is either simple\r\n(Lithocyclida) or armed with radial spines (Stylocyclida), or provided with\r\ntwo to five chambered radial arms (Astracturida); the structure of the arms\r\nis the same as that of the girdles.\r\n\r\n{405}The #Porodiscida# (Pls. 41-47), the largest family of all #Discoidea#,\r\nbegins the series of #Cyclodiscaria#, or those #Discoidea# in which there\r\nis no \"phacoid shell,\" but a small simple central chamber surrounded by a\r\nnumber of small latticed chambers of nearly the same size and form. In the\r\nPorodiscida these chambers are arranged in complete circular concentric\r\nrings or spiral convolutions; in the small family of Pylodiscida the\r\ncentral chamber is surrounded by three radial arm-chambers separated by\r\nthree open spaces; in the third family of #Cyclodiscaria#, the\r\nSpongodiscida, all the chambers are arranged more or less irregularly, and\r\nthe whole disk becomes spongy; also the surface of the disk is spongy,\r\nwhilst in both former families it is covered by two regular even porous\r\nplates or \"sieve-plates.\" Probably all #Cyclodiscaria# can be derived\r\nphylogenetically from _Archidiscus_, a very small and simple lenticular\r\ndisk, which is composed of a small spherical latticed central chamber and\r\nof a single concentric chambered ring or girdle; the margin of this ring is\r\nconnected with the central chamber by a variable number of radial beams.\r\nThis _Archidiscus_ can be derived either from _Saturnalis_ (Pl. 13, fig.\r\n16.) by the development of lattice-work between the equatorial ring and\r\nboth polar faces of the concentric central chamber, or from _Sethodiscus_\r\n(Pl. 33, figs. 1-3) by flattening of the lenticular shell, so that the\r\nenclosed inner medullary shell (the central chamber) meets the outer\r\nphacoid shell at both poles.\r\n\r\nThe Porodiscida are commonly flat or biconvex (rarely biconcave) disks, the\r\ncentral chamber of which is surrounded not by a single, but by a variable\r\nnumber (commonly three to six) of concentric chambered girdles or rings;\r\nthey arise from _Archidiscus_ by apposition of new concentric chambered\r\nrings around the first ring, all lying in the equatorial plane. Afterwards\r\nthe disk often becomes thickened by apposition of concentric chamber-rings\r\non both flat sides also, so that two to four or more layers are stratified\r\none over the other. The circular concentric rings often become interrupted,\r\nor spirally convoluted (wholly or partially); also the chambers sometimes\r\nbecome irregularly crowded. But in all cases both surfaces of the disk\r\n(upper and lower) continue to be porous plates or sieve-plates, at least in\r\nthe centre, but they never become spongy.\r\n\r\nThe margin of the disk exhibits in the Porodiscida a great variety of\r\ndifferent forms, serving for distinction of subfamilies and of genera. In\r\nthe Trematodiscida the margin remains quite simple, as in the Archidiscida,\r\nor is only surrounded by a hyaline equatorial girdle. In the Ommatodiscida\r\nit is distinguished by one or two peculiar oscula, surrounded by a corona\r\nof spines. The Stylodictyida are distinguished by a number of solid radial\r\nspines, and the Euchitonida by a number of chambered, or spongy, radial\r\narms, arising from the margin of the disk and lying in the equatorial\r\nplane. The variety of these radial marginal appendages is in the\r\nPorodiscida much greater than in the Coccodiscida.\r\n\r\nThe #Pylodiscida# (Pl. 48, figs. 12-20) represent a new, small, but very\r\nremarkable family of #Discoidea#, all triradial, and distinguished by the\r\npeculiar formation of {406}large open spaces in the latticed discoidal\r\nshell, which reappear in a similar shape among the #Larcoidea# in the\r\nPylonida (_Tetrapyle_, &c.). We get the best understanding of this peculiar\r\nformation if we return to _Archidiscus_, probably the common ancestral form\r\nof all #Cyclodiscaria#, of the Porodiscida as well as of the Pylodiscida\r\nand Spongodiscida. In some species of _Archidiscus_ (_Archidiscus\r\nhexoniscus_, _Archidiscus pyloniscus_, &c.) the small lenticular shell is\r\ncomposed of a spherical latticed central chamber and of a concentric\r\nequatorial girdle composed of six such chambers, either all six equal, or\r\nalternately larger and smaller. This latter form is nearly identical with\r\n_Triodiscus_, and if we imagine the lattice-work of only three\r\nring-chambers complete, whilst that of the three alternating chambers is\r\nreduced to the marginal ring, we get _Triopyle_, by loss of this ring\r\n_Triolene_ (a disk composed of four simple lattice-chambers, lying in one\r\nplane, three radial around one central spherule). The genera mentioned form\r\ntogether the subfamily of Triopylida. In the second subfamily, Hexapylida,\r\nthe same formation is doubled; here three double arm-chambers are separated\r\nby three double spaces (two in each radius). Also here the three distal\r\nspaces may be either quite open (_Pylolena_), or half closed by the\r\nmarginal girdle (_Hexapyle_), or quite loosely latticed (_Pylodiscus_). If\r\nthe margin of this latter form become surrounded by a perfect chambered\r\nequatorial girdle, we get _Discozonium_, and if this acquire a peculiar\r\nmarginal ostium (surrounded by a corona of spines) we arrive at\r\n_Discopyle_. These two latter genera form the third subfamily, the\r\nDiscopylida. The eight genera of Pylodiscida represent therefore a\r\ncontinuous phylogenetic series.\r\n\r\nThe #Spongodiscida# are the sixth and last family of the #Discoidea#,\r\ndiffering from the five other families in the irregular, spongy structure\r\nof the discoidal skeleton; both surfaces of the flat disk (upper and lower)\r\nare here principally covered with a rough, spongy framework, whilst in the\r\nfive other families they are covered by the flat and smooth porous plates\r\nor sieve-plates. Nevertheless there is no sharp boundary between the\r\nSpongodiscida and the closely allied Porodiscida. In these latter also the\r\ndiscoidal shell becomes often more or less spongy (mainly in the peripheral\r\npart, _e.g._, in _Myelastrum_, Pl. 47); but at least the central part of\r\nthe disk here remains constantly covered by sieve-plates. The massive\r\nskeleton of the Spongodiscida is either of perfectly irregular structure,\r\nonly composed of innumerable fine branched siliceous threads, interwoven in\r\nall possible directions; or only the outer part of the disk is composed of\r\nsuch spongy framework, whilst the central part is more or less distinctly\r\ncomposed of concentric chambered rings, as in the Porodiscida. These latter\r\nforms indeed exhibit an immediate transition to this family, and were\r\nformerly (in 1862) separated by me as Spongocyclida. Also the polymorphous\r\nshape of the disk margin in the Spongodiscida is quite analogous to that of\r\nthe Porodiscida. Whilst in the first subfamily, the Spongophacida, the\r\nmargin is quite simple; in the second, the Spongotrochida, it is armed with\r\nsolid radial spines; and in the third, the Spongobrachida, it is provided\r\nwith two, three, {407}or four spongy, radial arms--the former as well as\r\nthe latter lying in the equatorial plane of the disk, either regularly or\r\nirregularly disposed.\r\n\r\n_The Equatorial Margin_ of the lenticular disk exhibits in all six families\r\nof #Discoidea# similar characters, mainly serving for the distinction of\r\nsubfamilies and genera. In the most primitive genera of all six families\r\nthe margin is simple, without radial prolongations (spines or arms); it is\r\nquite simple in _Cenodiscus_, _Sethodiscus_, _Phacodiscus_, _Lithocyclia_,\r\n_Coccodiscus_, _Archidiscus_, _Porodiscus_, _Pylodiscus_, and\r\n_Spongodiscus_. In some genera the simple margin of the lenticular disk is\r\nbordered and surrounded by a thin, hyaline, equatorial girdle of silex,\r\neither quite solid or slightly porous (_Zonodiscus_, _Periphæna_,\r\n_Perizona_, _Perichlamydium_, and _Spongophacus_).\r\n\r\nA quite peculiar and remarkable character of few genera is the development\r\nof one or two oscula, larger marginal openings, which are surrounded by a\r\ncorona of spines, and probable are fit for the issue a peculiar bunch of\r\npseudopodia or of a \"sarcode flagellum.\" Such oscula occur only in two\r\nfamilies of #Cyclodiscaria#; in the Porodiscida and Pylodiscida; in the\r\nformer _Ommatodiscus_, in the latter _Discopyle_ (Pl. 48, figs. 19, 20) is\r\ndistinguished by a single marginal osculum; besides this, in the former\r\noccurs _Stomatodiscus_, with two such oscula, opposite on the poles of one\r\naxis (Pl. 48, fig. 8). These oscula may be compared with the similar polar\r\nformations in some Ellipsida (_Lithomespilus_) and in many Cyrtoidea; but\r\nthey do not prove a nearer affinity with the latter, and are only\r\nanalogous, not homologous.\r\n\r\n_Radial Spines_ occur on the margin in the equatorial plane of the\r\n#Discoidea# in the greatest variety of number, form, size, and disposition.\r\nIf the number be low (between two and eight) they are commonly regularly\r\ndisposed; if the number be larger (ten to twenty or more) their disposition\r\nbecomes commonly more or less irregular. The regular disposition is of\r\ngreat promorphological importance, as indicating the axes in which the\r\ngrowth is preponderant, and introduces other peculiar radial formations.\r\nRegarding these axes we can generally distinguish two groups, _Artiacantha_\r\nwith a paired number (two, four, eight), and _Perissacantha_ with odd\r\nnumbers (usually three). The section of _Artiacantha_ could be divided into\r\nthree following groups:--A. Stylodiscida, with two radial spines only,\r\nlying opposite on both poles of one equatorial axis (the \"first cross\r\naxis\")--_Stylodiscus_, _Sethostylus_, _Stylocyclia_, _Xiphodictya_,\r\n_Spongolonche_ (Pl. 31, figs. 9-12; Pl. 38, fig. 1; Pl. 42, figs. 10-12,\r\n&c.); B. Staurodiscida, with four radial spines, lying opposite in pairs on\r\nthe poles of two crossed equatorial axes, perpendicular to one another\r\n(first and second cross axes)--_Crucidiscus_, _Sethostaurus_,\r\n_Staurocyclia_, _Staurodictya_, _Spongostaurus_ (Pl. 31, figs. 1-8; Pl. 37,\r\nfigs. 1-4; Pl. 42, figs. 1-6; Pl. 48, fig. 2, &c.); C. Octostylida, with\r\neight radial spines, opposite in pairs in four axes, which are crossed at\r\nangles of 45°--_Heliosestrum_, _Astrosestrum_, &c. (Pl. 32, figs. 4, 5; Pl.\r\n34, figs. 3, 6); in this latter case sometimes the radial symmetry is the\r\nsame as in many Medusæ, four larger (perradial) {408}spines alternating\r\nwith four smaller (interradial), indicating radii of first and second\r\norder. The section of _Perissacantha_ is much smaller, and commonly\r\nrepresented only by triradial forms, with three spines at equal distances\r\n(120°)--_Triactis_, _Tripocyclia_, _Tripodictya_, _Spongotripus_, &c. (Pl.\r\n33, fig. 6; Pl. 37, fig. 5; Pl. 42, figs. 7-9).\r\n\r\n_Radial Arms_ on the margin of the disk appear in similar variety of\r\nnumber, form, and disposition as the radial spines; but the number is here\r\ncommonly limited to from two to four, rarely five to six. The arms are\r\nabsent in the families Cenodiscida and Phacodiscida; in the four other\r\nfamilies they return under similar forms. These arms are direct\r\nprolongations of the disk, and exhibit the same structure, so that they may\r\nbe regarded both as centrifugal productions of certain radii, and also\r\ninversely as peripheral parts of a disk, the interjacent radii of which are\r\nreduced. The regular disposition and shape of the arms, an important\r\ncharacter for the distinction of genera and species, is repeated in a quite\r\nanalogous manner in the four above mentioned families, so that we can\r\ndistinguish the following groups--A. Amphibrachida, with two radial arms,\r\nopposite on the poles of one equatorial axis (the first cross\r\naxis)--_Diplactura_, _Amphibrachium_, _Spongobrachium_ (Pl. 38, figs. 3-5;\r\nPl. 44, figs. 6-11); B. Triobrachida, with three radial arms; the most\r\nimportant group (with all Pylodiscida); either all three arms are equal and\r\ndisposed at equal distances (_Trigonactura_, _Dictyastrum_,\r\n_Rhopalodictyum_, Pl. 38, figs. 6-9; Pl. 43, figs. 5, 13, 16; Pl. 48, figs.\r\n12-19), or a single odd arm differs in size and position, and is often\r\nlarger than both the opposite paired arms (_Rhopalastrum_, _Euchitonia_,\r\nPl. 43, figs. 6, 10, 15, &c.); C. Tetrabrachida, with four radial arms,\r\nopposite in pairs in two crossed axes, commonly perpendicular one to\r\nanother, _Stauractura_, _Stauralastrum_, _Spongaster_, &c. (Pls. 46, 47).\r\n\r\nThe arms are commonly simple, undivided, but sometimes also forked or\r\nbranched (Pl. 43, figs. 15, 16; Pl. 47). Their basal parts are either free,\r\nseparately inserted into the margin of the circular central disk, or they\r\nare connected by a \"patagium,\" a peculiar connecticulum, like a\r\nweb-membrane, which is composed of a chambered, commonly more or less\r\nspongy framework, different in texture from the lattice-work of the arms\r\n(Pl. 38, figs. 8, 9; Pl. 43, figs. 9-16; Pl. 46). Sometimes the patagium\r\novergrows the whole shell. A peculiar modification of it appears in\r\n_Stephanastrum_ (Pl. 44, fig. 1), where only the distal parts of the arms\r\nare connected by the ring-shaped patagium, whilst the basal parts are free;\r\ntherefore open gates rest between them, like those of the Pylodiscida (Pl.\r\n48, figs. 12-20).\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ of the #Discoidea# is constantly discoidal, more or\r\nless lenticular; in some cases more biconvex, with vaulted faces and thin\r\nmargin; in others more medal-shaped, with flat faces and thick margin. In\r\nthe Cenodiscida alone the capsule lies freely inside the simple phacoid\r\nshell, and is separated from it by the jelly-veil. In the other five\r\nfamilies the capsule encloses the central parts of the skeleton, and is\r\nenveloped by the superficial parts of it, whilst its membrane is perforated\r\nby radial beams {409}connecting the latter with the former. In the\r\nPhacodiscida and Coccodiscida the capsule encloses the simple or double\r\nmedullary shell, but is itself enclosed by the cortical phacoid shell. In\r\nall #Cyclodiscaria# (in the Porodiscida, Pylodiscida, and Spongodiscida)\r\nthe capsule fills out the greatest part of the chambered or spongy\r\nskeleton, and is only protected by the superficial parts of it, in the\r\nPorodiscida and Pylodiscida by the covering sieve-plates, in the\r\nSpongodiscida by the spongy cortical substance of the shell. The growth of\r\nthe capsule corresponds to that of the including shell, gradually\r\nincreasing on the margin in the equatorial plane. Whilst in the greater\r\nnumber of #Discoidea# its form continues circular, in many forms provided\r\nwith radial arms it enters into the arms and assumes their form. The\r\nprotoplasm of the capsule is commonly coloured by brown or red pigment, and\r\noften contains many oil-globules. The nucleus is originally enclosed by the\r\nmedullary shell or the central chamber, and with increasing size enters\r\ninto the surrounding parts; in the #Cyclodiscaria# it often fills out the\r\ninternal concentric rings. The extracapsular jelly or the calymma is\r\ncommonly thick, and envelops the greater part or the whole body.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Families of the_ #Discoidea#.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

(Pl. 31, fig. 11; Pl. 48, figs. 1-3).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Discoidea# with simple extracapsular phacoid shell (or\r\nlenticular latticed cortical shell), without medullary shell and without\r\nchambered equatorial girdles.\r\n\r\nThe new family #Cenodiscida# opens the long series #Discoidea#, as their\r\nmost simple and primitive form. The circular lenticular central capsule is\r\nenclosed by a {410}simple latticed shell of the same form, only separated\r\nfrom it by a thinner or thicker jelly-veil. The lenticular or discoidal\r\nfenestrated shell is therefore an extracapsular or \"cortical shell,\"\r\nwithout an enclosed medullary shell.\r\n\r\nThe few genera of the Cenodiscida differ only in the shape of the\r\nequatorial margin of the lenticular disk. In the first subfamily,\r\nZonodiscida, the margin is either quite simple (_Cenodiscus_) or surrounded\r\nby a smooth, solid equatorial girdle (_Zonodiscus_). In the second\r\nsubfamily, Trochodiscida, the margin is armed with solid radial spines,\r\nlying in the equatorial plane. According to the number and disposition of\r\nthese marginal spines, we distinguish _Stylodiscus_ (with two spines,\r\nopposite in one equatorial axis), _Crucidiscus_ (with four spines, opposite\r\nin pairs in two equatorial axes, perpendicular one to another),\r\n_Theodiscus_ (with three marginal spines), and _Trochodiscus_ (with\r\nnumerous, commonly twenty to thirty, irregularly disposed spines). The\r\nspines are constantly simple, not branched; sometimes more conical or\r\ncylindrical, at other times more angular or pyramidal.\r\n\r\nThe two convex faces of the lenticular shell are constantly of similar\r\nshape, commonly smooth, sometimes more or less thorny, or armed with\r\nbristle-shaped radial spines. The pores are commonly more or less regular,\r\ncircular, and disposed in series, which are occasionally more radial, at\r\nother times more concentric. If the wall of the hollow lens be rather\r\nthick, the difference in the shape of the central and peripheral pores is\r\noften striking. The central pores perforating the thick wall\r\nperpendicularly are short cylindrical tubes; the marginal pores perforating\r\nit in an oblique direction are longer conical tubes. The bars between the\r\ncentral pores are often somewhat smaller.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Cenodiscida is in all cases a perfect,\r\ncircular, biconvex lens, the equatorial diameter of which is commonly\r\nbetween two-thirds and three-fourths of the enclosing lattice-shell. The\r\ninterval between the two is filled up by the jelly-veil, or the hyaline\r\n\"calymma,\" which is perforated by the numerous pseudopodia that pass\r\nthrough the shell-pores.\r\n\r\nAs the Cenodiscida possess the most simple shell-form of all #Discoidea#,\r\nwe may regard _Cenodiscus_ as the common ancestral form of this large\r\nsection, in the same manner as _Cenosphæra_ is the ancestral form of\r\n#Sphæroidea#, _Cenellipsis_ of the Prunoidea, Cenolarcus of the Larcoidea.\r\nBut it is also possible that a part of Cenodiscida (or all?) arises from\r\nthe Phacodiscida by reduction and loss of the medullary shell. For in some\r\ncases we find arising from the inside of the shell centripetal radial\r\nbeams, which end at a certain equal distance from the hollow centre (Pl.\r\n31, fig. 11; Pl. 38, fig. 2). Cenodiscus itself can be derived either from\r\n_Cenosphæra_ by compression of the spheroidal shell in one axis, or from\r\n_Sethodiscus_ by loss of the intracapsular medullary shell, or from\r\n_Actidiscus_ (the lenticular Actissa) by formation of a cortical shell\r\naround the lenticular central capsule.\r\n\r\n{411}_Synopsis of the Genera of the Cenodiscida._\r\n\r\n  I.

The latticed shell is a simple biconvex lens, and encloses a smaller\r\ncentral capsule of the same form, separated from it by the jelly-veil.\r\n_Cenodiscus_ can be derived phylogenetically either from _Cenosphæra_ by\r\nlenticular flattening of a simple latticed sphere, or directly from\r\n_Actissa_ by formation of a lenticular fenestrated shell around the\r\nlentiform central capsule. Possibly also some forms of _Cenodiscus_ can be\r\nderived from _Sethodiscus_ by reduction and loss of the medullary shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cenodiscus phacoides_, n. sp.

Several species of this genus are very similar to some species of\r\n_Heliodiscus_, and only differ in the absence of the medullary shell,\r\nperhaps in consequence of the phylogenetic loss of it; if this be the case,\r\nthe former are to be derived from the latter (compare p. 410).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Trochodisculus_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Bases of the marginal spines free, not connected by a solid\r\nequatorial girdle.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Trochodiscus cenophacus_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nDisk with smooth surface.

The Phacodiscida bear therefore the same relation to the\r\nCenodiscida that the Disphærida and Trisphærida do to the Monosphærida.\r\n\r\nFormerly several species belonging to the family were described by\r\nEhrenberg and Johannes Müller, but not distinguished from the Sphæroidea,\r\ngenus _Haliomma_ (_e.g._, _Haliomma sol_ et _Haliomma humboldtii_ of the\r\nformer, _Haliomma amphidiscus_ of the latter). For these oldest known\r\nspecies I constituted in 1862 my genus _Heliodiscus_ (Monogr. d. Radiol.,\r\np. 436). Some other genera were afterwards (1875) figured by Ehrenberg as\r\n_Periphæna_ and _Chilomma_. The rich material of the Challenger revealed\r\nthis family as very polymorphic and widely distributed, so that in my\r\nProdromus (1881, p. 457) I could enumerate eighteen different genera of\r\nPhacodiscida. This number is here reduced to fifteen, uniting several of\r\nthem into one genus as \"subgenera.\"\r\n\r\n_The Medullary Shell_ of the Phacodiscida, or the intracapsular latticed\r\nshell, is either simple and spherical, or double, composed of two\r\nconcentric spheres, which are united by a variable number of radial beams.\r\nWe could distinguish therefore as two subfamilies the Carpodiscida (with\r\nsimple medullary shell) and the Thecodiscida (with double concentric\r\nmedullary shell); the former corresponding to the Carposphærida (or\r\n_Dyosphæria_), the latter to the Thecosphærida (or _Triosphæria_). But as\r\nthis difference seems not to be so important as the different shape of the\r\ndisk margin, we prefer this latter as a character {420}for the separation\r\nof subfamilies. The form of the medullary shells is commonly quite\r\nspherical (as also in the above mentioned #Sphæroidea#); sometimes it is a\r\nlittle compressed in the same direction as the enclosing lenticular phacoid\r\nshell. The diameter of the latter is commonly three to four times as large\r\nas the diameter of the medullary shell; if this be double (in the\r\nThecodiscida) then the diameter of the outer medullary shell is commonly\r\nthree to four times as large as that of the inner. The radial beams\r\nconnecting the two seem to be very variable in number and disposition\r\n(compare Pl. 31, fig. 8; Pl. 32, figs. 3, 4_a_, 7, 8_a_; Pl. 33, figs. 2,\r\n3; Pl. 35, figs. 4, 8, 9, &c.).\r\n\r\n_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary shell with the cortical or\r\n\"phacoid shell,\" and which pierce the membrane of the lenticular central\r\ncapsule, are commonly aggregated into two polar bunches around the\r\nshortened axis of the disk (compare Pl. 31, fig. 8; Pl. 32, figs. 3, 8; Pl.\r\n33, figs. 2, 3, &c.). Their number seems to be usually between ten and\r\nthirty. More rarely piercing radial beams lie also in the equatorial plane,\r\nand then commonly as inner prolongations of the outer marginal spines; so\r\nwe find two opposite in one axis, in _Heliostylus_ (Pl. 34, figs. 1, 2), or\r\nfour opposite in pairs in two crossed axes, in _Phacostaurus_ (Pl. 31,\r\nfigs. 1, 2, 7). Often the thickness of the beams increases from the centre\r\ntowards the periphery.\r\n\r\n_The Phacoid Shell_, or the lenticular extracapsular cortical shell,\r\nexhibits in the Phacodiscida quite the same general character as in the\r\nCenodiscida, above described (p. 410). Commonly the equatorial diameter of\r\nthe lens is twice to three times as large as the vertical diameter or the\r\nshortened \"main axis.\" The convexity of both opposite faces is either quite\r\neven to the sharp margin (Pl. 31, fig. 2; Pl. 33, figs. 2, 5), or the\r\ncentral part of the lens is more strongly vaulted, and often the margin is\r\nthickened or truncated (Pl. 31, fig. 10; Pl. 35, fig. 7). The surface of\r\nthe lens is commonly smooth, but sometimes also covered with bristle-shaped\r\nradial spines (Pl. 34, figs. 3, 5; Pl. 32, figs. 2, 3); rarely these spines\r\nare prolonged and branched (Pl. 35, figs. 3, 5). The pores of the phacoid\r\nshell are usually quite regular, circular, and regularly arranged, either\r\nin more concentric or in more radial rows; the latter are sometimes\r\nseparated by radial crests arising towards the margin (Pl. 35, fig. 6). If\r\nthe wall of the phacoid shell be much thickened, the pores in its central\r\npart are shorter and cylindrical, in its marginal part longer and conical\r\n(Pl. 31, fig. 7; Pl. 32, fig. 1).\r\n\r\n_The Margin of the Lens_ of the Phacodiscida is very polymorphic, and\r\nserves mainly for the separation of genera. In the first subfamily,\r\nSethodiscida, it is either quite simple (Pl. 35, figs. 6-8) or surrounded\r\nby a thin solid equatorial girdle, the basal part of which is often\r\nradially striped (Pl. 32, figs. 7, 8). In the second subfamily,\r\nHeliosestrida, we find on the margin a small number of radial spines in the\r\nequatorial plane regularly disposed, either two opposite in one axis (Pl.\r\n31, figs. 9-12) or four opposite in pairs in two crossed axes (Pl. 31,\r\nfigs. 1-8), or eight opposite in pairs in four axes, crossed at angles of\r\n45° (Pl. 34, figs. 3, 6); in the latter case we can sometimes distinguish\r\n{421}(as in many Medusæ) four larger perradial spines alternating with four\r\nsmaller interradial spines. Often in one and the same species occur\r\nabnormalities in number and disposition of the radial spines, three or five\r\nspines instead of four, or also seven or nine spines instead of eight;\r\noften both halves of the disk become asymmetrical. If the number of the\r\nmarginal spines exceed eight to ten, they commonly become very variable in\r\nsize and irregular in disposition; these variations characterise the third\r\nsubfamily, Heliodiscida. Commonly also here all spines lie in the\r\nequatorial plane; but sometimes they become crowded in several parallel\r\ncircles on both sides of the margin (Pl. 32, fig. 1). The form of the\r\nmarginal spines is commonly conical or flattened triangular, often also\r\npyramidal or deeply furrowed (Pl. 31, figs. 6-9). Very rarely the spines\r\nare fenestrated (Pl. 35, fig. 1); only in one genus (_Heliodrymus_) they\r\nare all or partly branched (Pl. 33, fig. 9; Pl. 35, figs. 3, 5).\r\n\r\nThe peculiar development of the phacoid shell has been already described by\r\nJ. Müller (compare my Monograph, 1862, pp. 156, 438).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Phacodiscida is everywhere circular,\r\nlenticular, envelops the medullary shell, and is enclosed by the phacoid\r\nshell, perforated by the radial beams, which connect the latter to the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Phacodiscida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Berlin, p. 214 (_partim_).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Discoidea# with extracapsular phacoid shell (or lenticular\r\nlatticed cortical shell), connected by radial beams with an intracapsular,\r\nsimple or double, concentric medullary shell, and surrounded by one or more\r\nconcentric chambered equatorial girdles on the margin.\r\n\r\nThe family #Coccodiscida# was founded by me in 1862 for those #Discoidea#\r\nwhich agree with the Phacodiscida in the formation of the lenticular\r\n\"phacoid shell\" (including a simple or double medullary shell), but differ\r\nfrom them in the development of peculiar concentric chambered rings or\r\ngirdles around the equatorial margin of the disk, similar to those of the\r\nPorodiscida.\r\n\r\nThe Coccodiscida represent a polymorphic family, in which we here\r\ndistinguish sixteen genera with fifty-seven species; it comprises the\r\ngreater part of those {456}#Discoidea# which Ehrenberg united in his group\r\nLithocyclidina (1875, represented by four genera and eight species);\r\nseveral of these, however, appertain to quite different families, as his\r\n_Astromma entomocora_, _Lithocyclia amphitrites_, &c. His knowledge of the\r\nstructure was very imperfect. The peculiar differentiation of the genera\r\nand species exhibits the greatest analogy to that of the following family,\r\nPorodiscida, though the structure of the central disk in both families is\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\n_The Phacoid Shell_, or the circular, lenticular cortical shell exhibits in\r\nthe Coccodiscida quite the same structure and composition as in the\r\nPhacodiscida, described above (p. 420), so that there can be no doubt as to\r\nthe phylogenetic origin of the former from the latter. Quite in the same\r\nway in both families, the lenticular \"phacoid shell\" is connected by\r\nnumerous, short, radial beams with the intracapsular, simple or double,\r\nmedullary shell; and also here these beams are commonly disposed in two\r\ngroups around the poles of the shortened main axis of the lens, so that\r\ntheir distal ends are implanted in both circumpolar areas (Pl. 36, figs.\r\n2-6; Pl. 37, figs. 3, 7; Pl. 38, figs. 2, 7). The medullary shell is\r\ncommonly simple, spherical, sometimes a little lenticularly compressed;\r\nmore rarely it is double, composed of two concentric lattice-shells, which\r\nare connected by radial beams; in this case either both concentric\r\nmedullary shells are spherical, or the inner is spherical, and the outer\r\nlenticular, very rarely the inner is lenticular also. In average size and\r\nstructure they agree perfectly with those of the Phacodiscida.\r\n\r\n_The Chamber Girdles_ or \"chambered rings\" around the equatorial margin of\r\nthe disk, which constitute the only difference between the Coccodiscida and\r\nthe Phacodiscida, seem to exhibit a considerable degree of difference of\r\nstructure in the numerous species of this family; but I regret that I\r\ncannot explain them here satisfactorily. The study of these structures is\r\nextremely difficult because of the thickness and darkness of the massive\r\nopaque shells; to get a perfect knowledge of them, it is indispensable to\r\ncompare slides made in different directions (horizontal slides through the\r\nequatorial and parallel planes, vertical slides through radial and parallel\r\nplanes, oblique slides in different directions). But this requires a long\r\ntime and a most careful study of the slides, which are very difficult to\r\nget in satisfactory condition. Therefore the following remarks can have\r\nonly a provisional value.\r\n\r\nIn all Coccodiscida we can distinguish on the equatorial chamber-girdle of\r\nthe lens-margin (even on superficial inspection) three different elements\r\nof structure, viz.:--(A) concentric circular rings in the equatorial plane;\r\n(B) numerous radial beams piercing the former and dividing them into\r\nimperfect chambers; (C) porous plates or sieve-plates on both convex faces\r\nof the disk. The probable morphological significance of these three\r\nelements is the following:--Each ring or girdle corresponds to an outer\r\nlenticular cortical shell, which is only developed on the marginal part,\r\nwhilst its central part is represented by the phacoid shell. Therefore the\r\nradial beams (separating the imperfect chambers) are the same as in the\r\nconcentric Polysphærida, and the {457}sieve-plates of the surface are the\r\nporous walls of the cortical shell itself. The correctness of this\r\nexplanation seems to be proved by such forms as figured in Pl. 38, figs. 2,\r\n4, where the whole surface of the phacoid shell is covered by a concentric\r\nchamber-work, as a central continuation of the marginal concentric rings.\r\nIf we imagine a system of perfect concentric lenticular phacoid shells,\r\ncompressed strongly from both poles of the shortened main axis, we get the\r\nsame figure.\r\n\r\nRarely one single girdle only is developed on the equatorial margin of the\r\nlenticular disk (Pl. 37, figs. 2, 3, 5). Commonly the number of concentric\r\ngirdles amounts to three to six, often to ten to twelve or more. Some of\r\nthese largest Coccodiscida reach a considerable size. Commonly all girdles\r\nare of the same breadth, which is about equal to the radius or to the\r\ndiameter of the inner medullary shell. Rarely the first (or innermost)\r\ngirdle differs by its greater breadth from the succeeding ones (Pl. 36,\r\nfig. 8).\r\n\r\nOnly in few Coccodiscida the girdle-building remains restricted to the\r\nequatorial planes, so that all the chambers lie in it. Commonly on both\r\nsides of this plane become developed several layers, and often the number\r\nof these (three to six or more) increases towards the periphery; in other\r\ncases not their number, but their height increases. Therefore very often\r\nthe margin of the discoidal shell is much thickened, as thick as the centre\r\nof the lenticular phacoid shell (or even more); whilst between the latter\r\nand the former (on the proximal girdles) the disk is considerably thinner\r\n(Pl. 36, figs. 2, 4; Pl. 37, figs. 7, 8; Pl. 38, figs. 2, 4). The\r\nstratified layers communicate by large openings between their chambers. The\r\nradial beams are commonly more or less regular and piercing, but also\r\nfrequently irregular and interrupted; often their number increases towards\r\nthe margin by intercalation of new beams.\r\n\r\n_The Pores_ of the sieve-plates, which cover both sides of the chambered\r\ndisk, appear on the margin of the phacoid shell as direct continuations of\r\nthe pores of the latter, and sometimes they are so regularly disposed that\r\none single circular pore is situated on the surface of each chamber (Pl.\r\n36, fig. 7; Pl. 37, fig. 1). But commonly the pores are of variable size\r\nand number, two to three on each chamber, and often quite irregularly\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\n_The Margin_ of the chambered disk exhibits many differences, which afford\r\ncharacters for the distinction of genera. In the first subfamily, the\r\nLithocyclida, the margin is quite simple without radial appendages. In the\r\nsecond subfamily, the Stylocyclida, it is armed with solid radial spines\r\nlying in the equatorial plane, and often regularly disposed in the same\r\nmanner as in the Phacodiscida (compare above, p. 421). In the third\r\nsubfamily, the Astracturida, the margin bears two or more (commonly three\r\nor four) chambered arms, also situated in the plane of the disk, and of the\r\nsame structure as the circular chambered girdles (Pl. 38). In some cases\r\neven the whole system of chamber-girdles is represented only by the radial\r\narms, which are inserted immediately on the margin of the phacoid shell. We\r\nmay regard therefore these formations as imperfect chambered disks, which\r\nare developed only in the direction of certain rays {458}(perradii), and\r\nreduced in the direction of the alternating rays (interradii). In some\r\nAstracturida the chambered arms exhibit a structure different from the more\r\nirregular chamber-work between them, so that we can distinguish the latter,\r\nconnecting the arms like a web-membrane, as a peculiar \"patagium\" (as in\r\nmany Porodiscida) (Pl. 38, figs. 8, 9). Often the distal ends of the\r\nchambered arms are armed with a radial spine (Pl. 38, figs. 5, 6, 9).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Coccodiscida is originally always of the same\r\nform and shape as in their ancestral group, the Phacodiscida; a circular\r\nlenticular disk, which envelops the simple or double medullary shell and is\r\nenclosed by the cortical phacoid shell. But whilst in the Phacodiscida the\r\nphacoid shell envelops the central capsule perfectly, in the Coccodiscida\r\nit envelops only the capsule from the two flat sides (by the upper and\r\nlower sieve-plates); the marginal part of the lenticular capsule overgrows\r\nthe margin of the phacoid shell by peripheral extension, and fills out the\r\nchambered cavity of the concentric girdles. In the Lithocyclida and the\r\nStylocyclida, where there are no chambered arms, the central capsule\r\nremains a simple circular lens or disk; in the Astracturida, where\r\nchambered radial arms surround the margin of the circular central disk, the\r\ncapsule enters also into these arms and fills out the greatest part of\r\ntheir chambered cavities.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Coccodiscida_.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Wiss.\r\n      Berlin, p. 53 (_partim_).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Discoidea# without phacoid shell, with flat discoidal\r\nshell, in which a simple spherical central chamber is surrounded by\r\nconcentric chambered rings (each ring divided by radial beams into\r\nimperfect chambers).  Surface of the disk on the two flat sides covered by\r\na porous sieve-plate.\r\n\r\nThe family #Porodiscida# is by far the largest and richest in different and\r\ncommon forms among all #Discoidea#; already in my Monograph (1862) nine\r\ngenera and twenty-eight species have been enumerated.  Their number is here\r\nincreased to more than thirty genera and two hundred species. Many of these\r\nspecies appertain to the most common and widely distributed SPUMELLARIA,\r\nboth living and fossil. But the study of their structure is not easy, and\r\nrequires (as in the foregoing Coccodiscida) not only careful examination of\r\nthe facial views of the disk, but also of the marginal view and of slides\r\nand sections through different planes.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, pp. 485, 491, 513) I had constituted for these\r\n#Discoidea# two different families, the Trematodiscida and Discospirida;\r\nbut the comparative study of a far greater number of different types in the\r\nChallenger collection has since convinced me that those two families are\r\nbut little different, and united by transitional forms within one and the\r\nsame genus, so that they must be united as Porodiscida. Of the group, which\r\nEhrenberg formerly had called \"Calodictya,\" many genera appertain to the\r\nPorodiscida, whilst many others are true Spongodiscida.\r\n\r\nThe Porodiscida represent the first and the most important family of the\r\n#Cyclodiscaria#, or of those #Discoidea# which are devoid of the peculiar\r\nextracapsular lenticular \"phacoid shell,\" characteristic of the three\r\npreceding families (united therefore as #Phacodiscaria#).  Probably all\r\n#Cyclodiscaria# can be derived from _Archidiscus_, from a morphological as\r\nwell as a phylogenetic point of view. _Archidiscus_ seems to be the common\r\nancestral form not only of the Porodiscida, but also of the nearly allied\r\nPylodiscida and Spongodiscida. This important _Archidiscus_ (Pl. 48, figs.\r\n9-11) is a small lenticular circular disk, in which a simple latticed\r\nspherical central chamber is surrounded by one single concentric ring,\r\nconnected with it by a variable number of radial beams in the equatorial\r\nplane. From this typical _Archidiscus_, as from their \"architype,\" all\r\nother #Cyclodiscaria# may be derived; the Porodiscida by regular apposition\r\nof new concentric chambered rings on the margin, the Spongodiscida by\r\nirregular apposition of a spongy framework, the Pylodiscida by a peculiar\r\ninterrupted, concentric, triradial growth, three radial arm-chambers\r\nalternating with three open gates or holes, so that already the first\r\nchambered ring is not complete.\r\n\r\n{482}_Archidiscus_ (Pl. 48, figs. 9-11) is not only the common phylogenetic\r\nancestral form of all #Cyclodiscaria#, but also the common ontogenetic\r\noriginal form of all Porodiscida, or at least of the greater part of them.\r\nThe numerous species of _Archidiscus_, which are distinguished in the\r\nsequel, are at the same time the embryonic forms of different Porodiscida,\r\ncorresponding to the \"biogenetic main law of development.\" The small shell\r\nof _Archidiscus_ is sometimes completely lenticular, circular, at other\r\ntimes more or less polygonal; commonly on the biconvex centre much thicker\r\nthan on the margin, but sometimes also of nearly equal thickness (like a\r\nmedal or a short cylinder). The latticed central chamber of it is probably\r\nin the majority of species spherical, but in some more or less compressed,\r\nlenticular; the number of small pores on its surface is probably commonly\r\nbetween ten and twenty (four to eight usually being visible on each\r\nhemisphere). The number of radial beams, which connect it with the\r\nequatorial ring, varies commonly from four to eight; but sometimes only two\r\nor three are to be found, in other cases nine to ten or more. The regular\r\ndisposition of these beams (in certain equatorial axes of the disk) is\r\nprobably of great importance, as determining the later development of\r\ncharacteristic radial appendages of the margin in the more highly developed\r\nPorodiscida. The equatorial ring itself, forming the margin of the\r\nlenticular disk, is either a simple solid ring or a broader latticed\r\ngirdle; in the latter case it merges slowly into the opposite sieve-plates\r\nof the two flat disk sides, or the porous \"cover-plates,\" covering its\r\nparallel or convex surfaces. These latter can be regarded as direct\r\nperipheral continuations of the polar regions of the spherical central\r\nchamber. The ring-chambers, surrounding the latter in a single circle, are\r\ncommonly of nearly the same breadth, but often also of different irregular\r\nsize. Their number varies between two and ten or more, but commonly between\r\nfour and eight; each ring-chamber is covered on the upper and lower side by\r\nthe sieve-plate, bounded on the inner (proximal) side by the wall of the\r\ncentral chamber, on the outer (distal) side by the marginal ring, on both\r\nlateral sides by the contiguous neighbouring ring-chambers.\r\n\r\nThe important question as to the phylogenetic origin of _Archidiscus_ can\r\nbe answered in a twofold way. The most simple form of _Archidiscus_\r\n(_Archidiscus dioniscus_) can be derived immediately from the\r\nStylosphærida, _Saturnalis_ (Pl. 13, fig. 16), only by the development of\r\nlattice-work between the equatorial ring and the two polar faces of the\r\nconcentric central chamber (on the surface of the biconvex jelly-mantle).\r\nBut on the other hand _Archidiscus_ may also be derived from the simplest\r\nPhacodiscida, _Sethodiscus_ (Pl. 33, figs. 1-3), by the stronger\r\ncompression of the biconvex lenticular shell, so that the enclosed\r\nmedullary shell on the two poles runs together with the lenticular phacoid\r\nshell, of which only the peripheral part remains free, and thus forms the\r\nchambered ring; this latter explanation seems the more natural in many\r\ncases, as often in the Porodiscida the central chamber is enclosed in one\r\nor two concentric spherical or lenticular lattice-shells.\r\n\r\n{483}The second subfamily of the Porodiscida are the Trematodiscida, which\r\nare derived from the preceding Archidiscida by concentric growth in the\r\nequatorial plane.  In the same way in which the simple chambered ring of\r\n_Archidiscus_ is connected by radial beams with the central chamber, so in\r\n_Porodiscus_ a variable number of concentric rings is connected with that\r\nfirst ring. The number of these concentric rings varies between two and ten\r\nor more, but commonly amounts to between three and five.  The radial beams\r\nconnecting them are either piercing or interrupted; their number increases\r\ngradually from the centre towards the periphery. The chambers between them\r\nare sometimes more regular, at other times more irregular in size and form.\r\n Their upper and lower wall is formed by the two covering \"sieve-plates,\"\r\nor the porous cover-plates, which are continued from the central disk to\r\nthe margin.  If these two sieve-plates continue being parallel, the disk\r\nbecomes medal-shaped or a short cylinder; if the two plates become more or\r\nless concavely vaulted one against the other, the disk becomes biconvex\r\nlenticular, the middle part thicker than the marginal part.  Rarely the\r\ncontrary is the case, the margin thicker than the centre, and then the disk\r\nbiconcave.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph I had separated as two different subfamilies the true\r\nTrematodiscida (with circular concentric rings) from the Discospirida (with\r\nspirally convoluted rings). But the enormous mass of specimens, which I\r\nafterwards examined in the Challenger collection, has convinced me that\r\nthis separation was not natural.  For in one and the same genus of most\r\nnearly allied forms we find on one hand quite regular concentric circular\r\nforms (_Trematodiscus_), on the other hand spirally convoluted forms\r\n(_Discospira_), and connecting between them such forms as are in the\r\ncentral part concentric, in the marginal part spiral (_Perispira_)--or\r\nconversely, these in the centre spiral, on the margin concentric\r\n(_Centrospira_)--and frequently also more or less irregular forms with\r\ninterrupted rings (_Atactodiscus_); therefore, all those genera (Prodromus,\r\n1881, Nos. 448-452) have only the value of subgenera of _Porodiscus_. But a\r\ndistinct genus is _Perichlamydium_, in which the two sieve-plates run on\r\nthe margin of the lens and form a broad hyaline porous or solid girdle.\r\nMore important is the distinction of the Ommatodiscida, in which the margin\r\nof the disk exhibits one larger osculum, armed with a corona of spines\r\n(_Ommatodiscus_), or two oscula, opposite on the poles of one axis\r\n(_Stomatodiscus_).  Whilst in many Porodiscida all chambers of the\r\nconcentric rings lie in one and the same (equatorial) plane, in many others\r\nwith further growth they become stratified in floors, and the whole disk is\r\ntherefore composed of two to four or more parallel disks, each with a\r\nsystem of concentric chambered rings or girdles, quite as in the majority\r\nof the Coccodiscida (p. 457).  Often the central part of the lenticular\r\ndisk becomes thickened by apposition of such floors or strata, whilst the\r\nmarginal part remains simple, with one single stratum.  The communication\r\nbetween the chambers of the different strata seems to be the same as in the\r\nsimilar Coccodiscida.\r\n\r\nAlso the margin of the disk exhibits in the Porodiscida the same\r\ncharacteristic {484}differences as in the foregoing family. In the\r\nsubfamily of Stylodictyida it bears a certain number of solid radial\r\nspines, often regularly disposed (as in the Stylocyclida). In the subfamily\r\nof Euchitonida the margin is distinguished  by the possession of two to six\r\nor more (commonly three or four) chambered arms, also situated in the plane\r\nof the disk, and of the same structure (sometimes more or less irregular,\r\nspongy). These arms are very variable in size, form, and structure, exhibit\r\nthe same peculiarities as in the Astracturida, and are sometimes free, at\r\nother times connected by a \"patagium\" or an interbrachial spongy skeleton\r\nof different structure, like a web membrane (compare above, p. 458). In\r\nsome genera the arms become forked or branched on the distal end.\r\nSometimes their distal end bears a terminal radial spine.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Porodiscida assumes generally the form of the\r\nincluding shell, with or without arms, but is constantly somewhat smaller,\r\nas it remains enclosed by the sieve-plates of the disk surface. Often the\r\ncapsule is filled with many coloured oil-globules, disposed regularly in\r\nthe chamber rows. The nucleus of it is enclosed by the central chamber, and\r\nin many cases by this and the innermost concentric rings.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Porodiscida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

TREMATODISCIDA, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 491\r\n(_sensu emendato et restricto_).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Porodiscida# without radial appendages of the disk (solid\r\nspines or chambered arms on the margin), and without peculiar oscula on the\r\nmargin of the disk, which is composed of two to four or more concentric\r\nrings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 214. _Porodiscus_,[253] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 459.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with simple circular disk, composed of several\r\nrings (without radial appendages or peculiar oscula on the margin of the\r\ndisk).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Porodiscus_ is, next to its ancestral form, _Archidiscus_, the\r\nsimplest and most primitive form of the Porodiscida, from which all other\r\ngenera of this family can be derived. The disk is quite simple, without any\r\nmarginal appendages, composed of a variable number of rings, commonly of\r\ncircular form, sometimes more or less polygonal, elliptical, or irregular.\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, pp. 491, 513) I had separated the species, here\r\nunited in _Porodiscus_, into two different genera: _Trematodiscus_ with\r\nconcentric rings, and _Discospira_ with spiral rings. But the extended\r\nstudy of these very common forms in a great number of specimens in the\r\nChallenger collection has convinced me that the separation of those two\r\ngenera cannot be maintained. In one and the same locality, where one single\r\ncharacteristic disk-form is very common, we find intermingled quite regular\r\ndisks with only concentric, circular rings (_Trematodiscus_), and other\r\ndisks with one single perfect spiral ring (_Discospira_); and between\r\n{492}these a smaller number of specimens, in which the rings of the disk\r\nare partly concentric, partly spiral; either the rings of the central part\r\nof the disk are concentric, the outer spiral (_Perispira_), or the\r\nproportion is inverse (_Centrospira_); and sometimes the whole disposition\r\nof the concentric and spiral rings is irregular, and the rings often\r\ninterrupted (_Atactodiscus_). Therefore it appears more natural to give to\r\nall these different forms only the value of subgenera of _Porodiscus_, as I\r\nhave already proposed in my Prodromus (1881, p. 459). Even the numerous\r\nspecies of _Porodiscus_ (mainly characterised by the equal or different\r\nbreadth of the rings, and by the number, form, and size of the connecting\r\nradial beams and of the superficial pores) are for the most part very\r\nvariable and hard to distinguish, as all those characters are not constant.\r\n_Porodiscus_ is a quite \"transformistic genus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Trematodiscus_, Haeckel, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Sometimes the proximal part of\r\nthe girdle is ribbed by thin radial beams, the distal prolongations of the\r\nradial rods of the central disk.

These remarkable Porodiscida, very nearly allied to\r\n_Porodiscus_, are distinguished by one or two large openings on the margin\r\nof the disk, and these \"marginal oscula\" are constantly armed with a\r\ncoronet of spines (comparable to the osculum coronatum of _Sycon_ in the\r\nCalcispongiæ). Probably in the living Ommatodiscida the osculum is the door\r\nfrom which a \"sarcode-flagellum\" issues (comp. above, p. 407). Perhaps this\r\nosculum is comparable to the peculiar coronet of spines which is developed\r\non one pole of the shell axis in some Ellipsida (_Lithomespilus_,\r\n_Lithapium_). The internal structure of the disk is commonly more or less\r\nobscure, as the lenticular disk is much thickened, sometimes nearly\r\nellipsoidal. It is possible that the Ommatodiscida are more nearly related\r\nto the Lithelida than to the Porodiscida; but there is no indication of an\r\ninternal trizonal medullary shell. Also the apparent resemblance to the\r\nCyrtida is of no morphological value; both groups are of quite independent\r\nphylogenetic origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Ommatodiscinus_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Disk circular.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Ommatodiscus decipiens_, Stöhr.\r\n\r\n  _Ommatodiscus decipiens_, Stöhr, 1880, Palæontogr., vol. xxvi. p. 115,\r\n  Taf. vi. figs. 8, 8_a._\r\n\r\nDisk circular, with two chambered rings around the spherical central\r\nchamber, of equal breadth.

In _Dictyastrum_ these are quite simple and regular,\r\nwithout a patagium, separated by equal angles, so that the whole shell\r\nrepresents a regular, equilateral triangle, if we connect the distal points\r\nof the arms by lines. The genus _Dictyastrum_, founded by Ehrenberg in\r\n1860, differs from his _Rhopalodictyum_--after his own diagnosis--only by\r\nan insignificant difference in the form of the simple arms, which is\r\nscarcely a specific character. I therefore apply this name here in the\r\nabove amended sense, seeing that the only figured species of Ehrenberg\r\n(_Dictyastrum angulatum_) occurs in two different, but externally very\r\nsimilar forms: one of these is a true Porodiscid (_Dictyastrum_) with two\r\nporous covering-plates and concentric rings; the other is a true\r\nSpongodiscid (_Rhopalodictyum_) with quite spongy, irregular network, and\r\nis probably identical with the _Rhopalodictyum truncatum_ of Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Dictyastrella_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Arms with blunt ends, without terminal spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Dictyastrum angulatum_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Dictyastrum angulatum_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k.

This form occurs in two different states, externally quite\r\nidentical; in one state the central disk (as figured, _loc. cit._), is a\r\nsimple lens or hollow disk, containing a medullary shell or \"central\r\nchamber\"; in the other state the central disk is composed of two concentric\r\nrings surrounding the \"central chamber.\" We retain here the name\r\n_Hymeniastrum_ for this latter state, {530}expressed in the diagnosis given\r\nabove, and call the former state (the Coccodiscid) _Hymenactura_ (compare\r\nabove, p. 473). One practical advantage, obtained in this way, is that all\r\ngenera of #Discoidea# ending with \"_-astrum_\" belong to the Porodiscida.\r\n_Hymeniastrum_ differs from _Dictyastrum_ by the possession of a patagium,\r\nand from _Euchitonia_ by the equal size of the angles and the arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Hymenastrella_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Arms with blunt ends, without terminal spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Hymeniastrum leydigii_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Euchitonia leydigii_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

Retaining this species\r\ncorrectly as the type of this genus, I give to it here the above diagnosis.\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, p. 503) I described seven Mediterranean species of\r\n_Euchitonia_. Three of these have in common the characters according to the\r\npresent diagnosis: _Euchitonia mülleri_, _Euchitonia virchowii_,\r\n_Euchitonia beckmanni_; two others appertain (on account of the regular,\r\nnot bilateral form) to _Hymeniastrum_, and two others (on account of the\r\nforked, not simple arms) to _Trigonastrum_. Afterwards (1880) three true\r\nfossil species of _Euchitonia_ were described by Stöhr (_Euchitonia\r\ncruciata_, _Euchitonia zittelii_, and _Euchitonia acuta_). Some species of\r\nthis genus are cosmopolitan, and appertain to the most common and\r\neverywhere represented #Discoidea#.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Stylactis_, Ehrenberg, 1872 (_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Arms with blunt ends, without terminal spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Euchitonia furcata_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Euchitonia furcata_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

Surface of the disk with three open or\r\nlatticed gates on each flat side.\r\n\r\nThe family #Pylodiscida# represents a new small but interesting group of\r\n#Discoidea#, which exhibits rather complex affinities to different groups\r\nof #Sphærellaria#. In my Prodromus (1881, p. 464) I had enumerated only two\r\ngenera of this family, _Triopyle_ and _Hexapyle_, and had united them with\r\n_Tetrapyle_ and allied genera in the family Pylonida. Indeed, the\r\nresemblance of skeletal structure in the two groups is very great. The most\r\nsimple forms of both groups exhibit a simple spherical latticed central\r\nchamber, which is surrounded by few latticed chambers of similar size and\r\nform, separated by open gates. But in the Pylonida these chambers are\r\nopposite in pairs, and form together a complete lattice-girdle around the\r\ncentral chamber, whereas in the Pylodiscida the chambers are not opposite\r\nin pairs in one axis, and form therefore only latticed half girdles, which\r\narise from the central chamber like radial arms, and may perhaps better be\r\ncalled \"arm-chambers\"; their number is constantly three. The free open\r\nspaces between these three arm-chambers form three gates, comparable to the\r\ntwo or four gates of _Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_, &c., and become afterwards\r\nclosed by lattice-work in a similar way in both groups. A more important\r\ndifference between them is indicated by the further mode of growth. The\r\nPylonida build new girdles in all three dimensive planes (alternating in\r\nthe transverse, lateral and sagittal planes); their geometric fundamental\r\nform is therefore the \"lentellipsis\" or the \"triaxial ellipsoid.\" The\r\nPylodiscida, however, grow only at the periphery of the discoidal shell in\r\none single plane (the equatorial plane); their fundamental form is\r\ntherefore the biconvex lens or the flat disk (a shortened cylinder). This\r\nimportant difference is my deciding motive, in separating the latter from\r\nthe former and in regarding the Pylodiscida as true #Discoidea#, the more\r\nso as they can easily be derived from _Archidiscus_, the fundamental and\r\nancestral form of the Porodiscida.\r\n\r\nOne single form of _Archidiscus_ seems to be of peculiar importance in this\r\nrelation, viz., _Archidiscus hexoniscus_ (Pl. 48, fig. 10). In this species\r\nthe simple central chamber is surrounded by a latticed ring or girdle,\r\ncomposed of six equal chambers of the same size and form, all lying in the\r\nsame plane with the central chamber. In a nearly allied species, viz.,\r\n_Archidiscus pyloniscus_, the six ring-chambers are different, three\r\nsmaller (with denser network) alternating with three larger (of looser\r\nnetwork); if we imagine the network of the latter reduced to a marginal bar\r\nwe get _Triopyle_, and if also this bar disappear by reduction we get\r\n_Triolena_, the most simple form of the Pylodiscida. {562}Even _Archidiscus\r\npyloniscus_ may possibly represent the same form among the Porodiscida as\r\n_Triodiscus lenticula_ among the Pylodiscida; this important form indicates\r\nclearly the close affinity of the two families.\r\n\r\nIf we take the latter, nearly identical form as the common starting point\r\nof both families of Cyclodiscaria, then probably _Triopyle_ and _Triolene_\r\nmust be regarded as retrograde forms, derived from _Triodiscus_ in the one\r\ncase, from _Archidiscus_ in the other, by reduction of three interradial\r\narm-chambers, whilst three perradial only remain. But it is also possible\r\nthat the most simple form, _Triolene_, originated independently from some\r\n_Cenosphæra_, three simple radial chambers, like the latticed central\r\nchamber, being derived from the latter by apposition in three equidistant\r\nradii, whilst three other radii between them remained free. In this case\r\nthe other genera of Pylodiscida are derived from their ancestral form\r\n_Triolene_.\r\n\r\nAdopting this latter view, we find that all eight genera of Pylodiscida,\r\nhere distinguished, may be regarded as following members of a continuous\r\nseries. If the three simple arm-chambers of _Triolene_, surrounding the\r\nequal central chamber, become united at their distal ends by a concentric\r\nequatorial ring, then originates _Triopyle_; and this graduates into\r\n_Triodiscus_ by fenestration of the three open gates between the three\r\nlatticed arms. Whilst these three genera form together the subfamily\r\nTriopylida, a second family, Hexapylida, is composed of three other\r\nanalogous genera, in which the same process of development becomes\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n_Pylolena_, the most simple form of Hexapylida, arises from _Triodiscus_ by\r\nthe development of three new arm-chambers (of the second order) which are\r\napposed at the distal end of the three primary arm-chambers (of the first\r\norder) in the same radius. If the distal ends of these three secondary\r\narm-chambers become united by a concentric latticed ring or girdle, we get\r\n_Hexapyle_ (with six open gates, two in each radius), and if its six gates\r\nbecome afterwards closed by loose lattice-work, we arrive at _Pylodiscus_\r\n(a repetition of _Triodiscus_).\r\n\r\nA third subfamily, Discopylida, is formed by the building of a chambered\r\nequatorial girdle around the margin of _Pylodiscus_. This girdle has quite\r\nthe same structure as the similar chambered rings or girdles of the\r\nPorodiscida and Coccodiscida. Between the two sieve-plates of the disk\r\nsurface is enclosed a variable number (twelve to twenty-four or more) of\r\nchambers, imperfectly separated by radial beams, which connect the margin\r\nof the _Pylodiscus_-shell with an outer peripheral concentric ring. In\r\n_Discozonium_ this marginal ring is perfect, whilst in _Discopyle_ it is\r\ninterrupted by a peculiar large opening, a \"marginal osculum\" surrounded by\r\na corona of spines, quite the same remarkable formation which we\r\nencountered in _Ommatodiscus_ among the Porodiscida.\r\n\r\nAll Pylodiscida are therefore triradial (with three perradial arms and\r\nthree interradial gates between them), and many of them have a great\r\nresemblance to certain triradial Porodiscida and Spongodiscida, perhaps not\r\nonly a morphological resemblance, but also {563}a true phylogenetic\r\nrelation. But it is remarkable that we do not find further forms of\r\ndevelopment in this family, by multiplication either of the arm-chambers\r\n(further growth in the three perradii) or of the concentric chambered rings\r\n(in the periphery of the disk margin).\r\n\r\nThe central capsule of the Pylodiscida is constantly flat, discoidal, and\r\nenclosed between the two sieve-plates of the surface.  Its form is either\r\ncircular or triangular.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Pylodiscida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

This peculiar osculum is here also surrounded by a\r\ncorona of spines, and serves probably for the exit or outlet of a bunch of\r\npseudopodia or a \"sarcode-flagellum.\" Only two species of _Discopyle_ have\r\nbeen observed, which represent perhaps better two different genera; in one\r\nspecies the disk is circular, in the other elliptical.

Wiss.\r\n      Berlin, p. 53 (_partim_).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Discoidea# without a phacoid shell, with a flat discoidal\r\nshell, in which a simple spherical central chamber is surrounded by an\r\nirregular spongy framework (sometimes with concentric rings around the\r\ncentral chamber). Surface of the disk quite spongy, without porous\r\nsieve-plates.\r\n\r\nThe family #Spongodiscida# is the sixth and last family of the #Discoidea#,\r\nand bears to the other families of this group the same relation as the\r\nfamily Spongosphærida does to the other #Sphæroidea#, or the Spongurida to\r\nthe other #Prunoidea#. Its characteristic structure consists in the\r\nirregular spongy framework of the disk, and mainly in the rough, irregular\r\nshape of its spongy surface, which is never covered with porous plates\r\n(neither phacoid shell nor corresponding sieve-plates), as in all other\r\n#Discoidea#.  Of course a little spongy structure occurs also in many\r\nPorodiscida {574}and even in some Coccodiscida (principally in the\r\nperipheral part of the disk or its chambered arms); but both flat (or\r\nconvex) surfaces of the disk (at least in the central part) remain here\r\nconstantly as simple lattice-plates, whilst in all Spongodiscida the whole\r\nsurface of the disk is spongy.\r\n\r\nWhen I constituted the family Spongodiscida in my Monograph (1862, pp. 452,\r\n460) I had separated from them the Spongocyclida, exhibiting in the central\r\npart of the disk a more or less distinct concentric arrangement of the\r\nspongy chambers, whilst in the former the delicate spongy framework is\r\nquite irregular, composed of branched siliceous threads, connected and\r\ninterwoven in all directions. But in all Spongocyclida the whole surface of\r\nthe spongy disk is quite as irregularly rough and deprived of smooth\r\nsieve-plates as in all true Spongodiscida, and the more or less concentric\r\nstructure of the central part of the disk in the former (very variable and\r\noften scarcely able to be recognised) seems not sufficient to separate both\r\ngroups; even the single genera cannot be sufficiently separated by this\r\ncharacter. I now therefore give up entirely the group of Spongocyclida (as\r\nalready done in my Prodromus, 1881). Nevertheless the concentric annular\r\nstructure in the dark central part of some Spongodiscida is very\r\ninteresting as transition to the Porodiscida; it indicates already that the\r\nformer are derived from the latter.  Even the single genera in both\r\nfamilies are corresponding.\r\n\r\nIn the new system of \"Polycystina,\" which Ehrenberg gave, 1875 (Abhandl. d.\r\nk. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 157), are enumerated under the _Calodictya_\r\nfour genera \"with spongy disk,\" viz., _Spongodiscus_, _Rhopalodictyum_,\r\n_Dictyocoryne_, _Spongaster_. Indeed these four genera, which I here\r\nretain, are true Spongodiscida, and must be separated from the other\r\n_Calodictya_, the greater part of which are Porodiscida. The number of\r\nspecies of true Spongodiscida now amounts to sixty-seven, which I dispose\r\nin thirteen genera.\r\n\r\nThe whole family may be divided into three subfamilies. The first of these\r\nare the Spongophacida (corresponding to the Trematodiscida among the\r\nPorodiscida), in which the circular margin of the spongy disk bears no\r\nradial appendages; either the margin is quite simple, spongy\r\n(_Spongodiscus_), or surrounded by a hyaline, solid, or porous equatorial\r\ngirdle (_Spongophacus_). The disk is either more lenticular (biconvex) or\r\nmore flat discoidal (a shortened cylinder), rarely a little biconcave\r\n(thicker at the margin than in the centre). The spongy framework of the\r\nsolid disk is either quite irregular (_Spongodisculus_), or in the central\r\npart with concentric circular rings (_Spongocyclia_), or in the central\r\npart spirally convoluted (_Spongospira_).\r\n\r\nThe second subfamily, Spongotrochida, corresponds to the Stylodictyida\r\n(among the #Porodiscida#), and is distinguished by solid radial spines on\r\nthe margin of the disk, disposed in the equatorial plane either irregularly\r\nor regularly (after the same order as in the other families of\r\n#Discoidea#).\r\n\r\nThe third subfamily, Spongobrachida, correspond perfectly to the\r\nEuchitonida {575}(among the Porodiscida), bearing on the disk-margin two,\r\nthree, or four spongy arms, commonly disposed regularly in the equatorial\r\nplane. Here also occurs the peculiar formation of a \"patagium,\" or of an\r\ninterbrachial spongy framework different from that of the arms, which\r\nconnects the arms like a web-membrane in the equatorial plane.\r\n\r\nThe spongy framework exhibits in all these Spongodiscida no remarkable\r\ndifferences, being everywhere composed of fine branched solid siliceous\r\nthreads, interwoven in all directions, with irregular meshes of very\r\ndifferent size.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule of all Spongodiscida is filled up with the same spongy\r\nframework which covers also both its sides. It grows according to the\r\nenveloping skeleton, but remains constantly smaller. The form of the\r\ncentral capsule is circular (lenticular or discoidal) in the Spongophacida\r\nand Spongotrochida, whilst in the Spongobrachida it enters into the radial\r\nspongy arms, developed from the margin of the spongy disk.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Spongodiscida._\r\n\r\n                    {Spongy disk with simple\r\n    I.

In my\r\nMonograph (1862, pp. 452, 460, 469) I had separated the true _Spongodiscus_\r\n(first described by Ehrenberg, _loc. cit._) and the _Spongocyclia_; the\r\nformer being characterised by the irregular spongy framework of the whole\r\ndisk, whilst in the latter this framework includes in the central part some\r\nconcentric circular rings (approaching _Porodiscus_). In the same way\r\nafterwards Stöhr (1880, _loc. cit._) separated the genus _Spongospira_ as\r\nspongy disks, which include in the central part some spiral convolutions.\r\nBut as these differences are rather inconstant and not sharply discernible,\r\nI think it now better to regard these three forms as subgenera of\r\n_Spongodiscus_.

Also\r\nthere is no patagium. _Spongolena_ may easily be confounded with\r\n_Spongurus_ (compare my Prodromus, 1881, p. 461); but in the true\r\n_Spongurus_ (an ellipsoid) the transverse section is circular, in\r\n_Spongolena_ elliptical.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Spongolena rhopalura_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nArms club-shaped, three times as long as broad, at the rounded distal end\r\ntwice as broad as at the base, and twice as long as the diameter of the\r\ncircular central disk.

Radiol., p. 465, Taf.\r\nxxvii. fig. 1, but differs in the compressed lenticular (not ellipsoidal)\r\nform of the central disk; the transverse section of the arm is elliptical,\r\nnot circular.)\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.1, breadth 0.04.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 270, depth 2925 fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Spongolena cypselura_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nArms nearly triangular, not longer than broad, about half as large as the\r\nelliptical central disk, at the broader distal end with two very large,\r\nwidely divergent lateral spines, and between them several smaller, like the\r\ntail of a swallow.

It corresponds to _Dictyastrum_ and\r\n_Rhopalastrum_ among the Porodiscida, to _Trigonactura_ among the\r\nCoccodiscida. The typical species of this genus is _Rhopalodictyum\r\nabyssorum_ of Ehrenberg, the only species figured by him. His diagnosis of\r\nthe genus was very insufficient, and agreed with that of his _Dictyastrum_\r\n(compare above the improved diagnosis of this genus, p. 526, and my\r\nMonograph, p. 466).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Rhopalodictya_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Triangular shell regular, with three arms of equal size and\r\nequidistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Rhopalodictyum abyssorum_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Rhopalodictyum abyssorum_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k.

This latter name I have retained for the similar Porodiscid (above,\r\np. 526), mainly because the genera _Dictyastrum_ and _Rhopalodictyum_,\r\naccording to the insufficient diagnosis of Ehrenberg, seem to be identical.\r\n(Compare my Monograph, 1862, p. 466.)\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.13, basal breadth 0.09, distal breadth\r\n0.1.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Tropical Pacific, Philippine Sea, Station 200, depth 250\r\nfathoms; Atlantic (Mexican Gulf Stream).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Rhopalodictyum subacutum_, Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n  _Rhopalodictyum subacutum_, Ehrenberg, 1861, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.\r\n  Akad. d.

LARCOIDEA, Haeckel, 1883 (Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50).\r\n\r\n_Definition_.--SPUMELLARIA with lentelliptical central capsule (rarely\r\nsomewhat modified or allomorphic), with a lentelliptical fenestrated\r\nsiliceous shell (often modified or allomorphic, and sometimes quite\r\nirregular). Growth different in the three unequal dimensive axes,\r\nperpendicular one to another. The typical Lentellipsis is characterised by\r\nthree elliptical dimensive planes of different sizes, perpendicular one to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe section #Larcoidea#, the fourth and last of the #Sphærellaria#,\r\ncomprises all those forms of this group in which the fenestrated shell\r\noriginally is lentelliptical, characterised by different growth in three\r\ndifferent axes, perpendicular one to another, all three equal on both\r\npoles. The geometrical fundamental form of the shell is therefore a\r\nlentellipsis or a triaxial ellipsoid; and this typical form is preserved\r\ncompletely in the majority of #Larcoidea# in the pure geometrical form of\r\nthe central capsule.\r\n\r\nThe three dimensive axes, which determine the typical form of #Larcoidea#,\r\nare commonly differentiated in such a way, that the first, the longitudinal\r\nor principal axis, is the longest; both its poles, oral and aboral (or\r\nanterior and posterior) are equal. The second, the lateral or transverse\r\naxis, is commonly less than the first, greater than the third axis; both\r\nits poles are the equal lateral poles (right and left not differentiated).\r\nThe third dimensive axis, the equatorial or sagittal axis, is commonly the\r\nshortest; both its equal poles are the sagittal poles (dorsal and ventral\r\npoles not different). The relative size of the three dimensive axes in the\r\nhuman body exhibits similar relations.\r\n\r\nThe three dimensive planes of the #Larcoidea#, the sagittal, lateral, and\r\ntransverse planes, are elliptical, all three of different sizes. The first\r\nplane, the median or sagittal plane, is commonly as regards size between\r\nthe two others; its major axis is the principal, its minor the sagittal\r\naxis; it separates the right half of the body from the left. The second\r\nplane or lateral plane, is commonly larger than the two others; its major\r\naxis the principal, its minor the transverse axis; it separates the dorsal\r\nhalf of the body from the ventral. The third plane, the equatorial or zonal\r\nplane, is commonly less than the two others; its major axis the lateral,\r\nits minor the sagittal axis; it separates the two principal halves of the\r\nbody, the oral and aboral halves.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862) only very few forms of #Larcoidea# are described,\r\n_Tetrapyle_ and _Lithelius_ (the latter representing a peculiar family,\r\nLithelida). In my Prodromus (1881, pp. 463, 464) I disposed all observed\r\nforms of #Larcoidea# in two different families, the Pylonida and Lithelida.\r\nThe rich materials of the Challenger collection have since offered an\r\nastonishing number of new and interesting forms of this section, so that I\r\ncan enumerate here fifty-one genera and two hundred and sixty-five species.\r\nI dispose them here in four subsections and nine families. Three of these\r\nhave regular lentelliptical shells, which are not articulate, and\r\n{600}without annular constrictions (Larcarida, Larnacida, Pylonida); these\r\nform the subsection Pylolarcida. Two other families (Tholonida and\r\nZonarida) are distinguished by annular constrictions, which divide the\r\nregular lentelliptical shell into a number of dome-shaped chambers or\r\ncupolas; we call these Thololarcida. A third group, Spirolarcida, comprises\r\nthe #Larcoidea# with spiral growth; the two families of Lithelida and\r\nStreblemida. Finally a fourth group the Sorolarcida is formed by the\r\n#Larcoidea# with irregular shells, also two families, the Phorticida and\r\nSoreumida.\r\n\r\nThe first family of #Larcoidea#, the Larcarida, contains the most simple\r\nforms, beginning with _Cenolarcus_, a quite simple lentelliptical latticed\r\nshell. In _Coccolarcus_ we find already two concentric shells, connected by\r\nradial beams, an inner medullary and an outer cortical shell. In\r\n_Spongolarcus_ the lentelliptical shell becomes spongy.\r\n\r\nThe second family, Larnacida, is very similar to the Larcarida, and seems\r\nto diverge only by the different mode of connection between the two\r\nconcentric lentelliptical shells. But in truth this slight difference is of\r\ngreat morphological importance, as it depends on a quite different and\r\npeculiar mode of growth. In the foregoing Larcarida (_Coccolarcus_, &c.),\r\nthe concentric shells originate in the same manner as in the concentric\r\n#Prunoidea# and #Sphæroidea#, by radial beams, which arise from the surface\r\nof the inner (medullary) shell and become connected by a network to form\r\nthe outer (cortical) shell. Here, in the Larnacida, a quite similar shell\r\noriginates in a quite different way, first arrived at in the Pylonida\r\n(_Trizonium_). Both concentric shells become here connected by peculiar\r\nlattice girdles, which are developed in the perimeter of the three\r\nelliptical dimensive planes. Firstly, on both sides of a simple, spherical,\r\nor lentelliptical central chamber, arise two lateral wings (on the poles of\r\nthe transverse axis), and build around the former a transverse girdle. This\r\nis crossed by a larger lateral girdle, the minor axis of which is the major\r\nof the former, and perpendicular to both girdles is yet developed a third,\r\nthe sagittal girdle. If the open fissures or \"gates\" between these three\r\ngirdles become closed by network, we obtain _Larnacilla_, the probable\r\nancestral form of all Larnacida.\r\n\r\nWhilst in _Larnacilla_ and _Larnacidium_ this typical trizonal\r\nlentelliptical shell constitutes by itself alone the whole skeleton, in the\r\nother Larnacida it becomes overgrown by outer envelops, and so becomes\r\nenclosed in the interior of the central capsule as a \"_Larnacilla_-shaped\r\nmedullary shell.\" If the enclosing external envelops be simply latticed, we\r\nget the subfamily Larnacalpida; if they be spongy, we get the\r\nLarnacospongida.\r\n\r\nThe third family, Pylonida, is the most important of all #Larcoidea#, as\r\nnot only the largest and most interesting number of species belong to it,\r\nbut also many other genera (far the greater part of all #Larcoidea#) may be\r\nderived from it. The peculiar character of the Pylonida is determined by\r\nthe imperfect fenestration of the lentelliptical shell growing in the three\r\ndimensive axes in a quite different manner. Each elliptical dimensive plane\r\nbecomes circumscribed by an elliptical latticed girdle (or fenestrated\r\n{601}ring), and between these three girdles (perpendicular one to another)\r\nremain wide open fissures of the shell or \"gates\" (_Pylæ_). The beginning\r\nof the shell-building is the same as in _Larnacilla_, the most simple form\r\nof Larnacida. From a quite simple medullary shell, a spherical,\r\nsubspherical, ellipsoidal, or lentelliptical central chamber, arise two\r\nlatticed wings, opposite on the poles of the transverse axis\r\n(_Monozonium_). Both wings are short and wide hollow fenestrated tubes, the\r\naxes of which are parallel to the principal axis. Therefore they form\r\ntogether with the central chamber an elliptical transverse girdle. This\r\nfirst girdle becomes crossed by a second lateral girdle; from both poles of\r\nthe transverse axis arise latticed wings, which unite on the poles of the\r\nprincipal axis, therefore the minor axis of this second larger ring is the\r\nmajor axis of the first smaller ring (_Dizonium_). Between the two crossed\r\nrings remain four wide open gates. Now follows the development of a third\r\nsagittal girdle, arising from both poles of the principal axis and\r\novergrowing the four gates. But as this third girdle is larger than the\r\nsecond, four other larger gates arise between the two (in planes\r\nperpendicular to the former four gates). Now we have the characteristic and\r\nmost important trizonal shell (_Trizonium_), composed of three elliptical\r\nlattice-girdles of different size, perpendicular one to another, and\r\nenclosing a simple central chamber. If the four gates of this _Trizonium_\r\nbecome closed by lattice-work, it passes over into _Larnacilla_, the most\r\nimportant ancestral form of the Larnacida.\r\n\r\nThis most significant \"trizonal shell,\" either incompletely latticed in\r\n_Trizonium_ (with four open gates), or completely latticed by fenestration\r\nof the four gates, in _Larnacilla_, is to be found in far the greater part\r\nof all #Larcoidea#, representing the medullary shell, which is overgrown by\r\nan outer cortical shell. In many #Larcoidea#, in which this\r\n\"_Larnacilla_-shell\" is absent, it is perhaps lost  by phylogenetic\r\nreduction, or retrograde metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe same process of triple girdle-building, by which the typical\r\n_Trizonium_-shell or _Larnacilla_-shell is produced (Haplozonaria), is\r\nrepeated once or twice in the larger forms of Pylonida. The first system of\r\nthree girdles (perpendicular one to another) becomes overgrown by a second\r\nsystem of the same formulation in the Diplozonaria, and this becomes\r\novergrown by a third system in the Triplozonaria; in the highest genus of\r\nthis group, _Pylozonium_, we find not less than nine girdles (three\r\nsystems, each of three girdles). Till now only one genus of the whole\r\npolymorphous family was well known, _Tetrapyle_ (with five girdles, three\r\nof the medullary, two of the cortical shell). If the gates between the\r\ngirdles remain open, all these forms must be regarded as Pylonida; if the\r\ngates afterwards become closed by a network, they pass over into other\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe fourth family of the _Larcoidea_ is the Tholonida, distinguished by the\r\npolythalamous shell being composed of a certain number of roundish or\r\nhemispherical chambers (domes or cupolas), which surround a primordial\r\ncentral chamber in quite regular disposition, lying opposite in pairs on\r\nthe poles of the three dimensive axes. {602}If we imagine that each \"wing\"\r\n(or open half-girdle) of the Pylonida becomes closed by a lattice-work, and\r\nso transformed into a hemispherical or roundish cupola, we obtain the\r\ncharacteristic shell of the Tholonida. Indeed every girdle of the former\r\ncorresponds to a pair of opposite domes of the latter. The axis of each\r\npair of domes is one of the three dimensive axes.\r\n\r\nThe primordial chamber of the Tholonida (or the central chamber, around\r\nwhich all cupolas are regularly disposed) is either a simple lentelliptical\r\nlattice-shell, like _Cenolarcus_, or it is a trizonal shell (with an\r\nenclosed concentric medullary shell), like _Larnacilla_. As in both cases\r\nthe building and the disposition of the cupolas around it are quite the\r\nsame, we can suppose that the whole family of Tholonida may have been\r\nderived originally from _Larnacilla_ (or _Trizonium_), and that the\r\nCenotholida (with a simple central chamber) are sprung from the\r\nCoccotholida (with a _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber) by reduction and\r\nloss of the original medullary shell.\r\n\r\nThe family Tholonida can be divided into three subfamilies according to the\r\ndisposition of the cupola-pairs in one, two, or three dimensive axes. In\r\nthe Cubotholida lie two cupolas on the poles of the transverse axis of the\r\ncentral chamber (corresponding to _Amphipyle_); in the Staurotholida we\r\nfind four cupolas crosswise disposed, on the poles of the transverse and\r\nprincipal axes (corresponding to _Tetrapyle_); in the Cubotholida are at\r\nleast six cupolas, on the poles of all three dimensive axes (corresponding\r\nto _Tholonium_). In all three cases the number of cupolas may be augmented\r\nby the secondary apposition of other chambers or domes in the same\r\ndisposition. Sometimes also the whole cortical shell becomes enclosed by an\r\nexternal veil or mantle of delicate network. The lentelliptical (or often\r\nnearly cubical) central chamber becomes often reduced, so that its sides\r\nare incompletely latticed or widely opened; in some Cubotholida only the\r\ntwelve edges of the eight cornered cubical central chamber remain; its six\r\nsides are quite open and only over-vaulted by the six hemispherical\r\ncupolas. From the opposite points of the latter (in the deep annular\r\nconstrictions between them) often arise radial spines, and these lie\r\ncommonly in diagonal planes, separating the dome-pairs.\r\n\r\nA similar dome-building or a composition of the polythalamous shell by\r\npairs of cupolas we find also in the next (fifth) family, the Zonarida. But\r\nhere the true cause of the peculiar dome-structure is quite different, not\r\nan apposition of new chambers, but the constriction of a cortical\r\nshell-like _Larnacalpis_ by two or more constrictions. These constrictions\r\nlie in dimensive planes (or in planes parallel to these), and therefore the\r\ncupolas are (all or partly) in diagonal planes, a condition quite opposite\r\nto that found in the Tholonida. One of the annular constrictions is\r\nconstantly in the sagittal plane (separating the right and left halves of\r\nthe shell). The number of the constrictions in the few genera is two,\r\nthree, and four, and therefore the number of the cupolas four, six, or\r\neight. As this cortical shell constantly encloses a trizonal medullary\r\nshell (or _Larnacilla_-shell), we cannot doubt that the Zonarida must be\r\nderived from the Larnacida.\r\n\r\n{603}Whilst in all the foregoing five families of #Larcoidea# the\r\nshell-form is regular and their geometrical fundamental form is a\r\nlentellipsis (or a triaxial ellipsoid, with three unequal isopolar\r\ndimensive axes), in the four remaining families of this suborder the shell\r\nbecomes bilateral or irregular (with the poles of the axes unequal). In two\r\nof these families (Lithelida and Streblemida) the growth of the shell\r\nbecomes spiral, in the last two families (Soreumida and Phorticida) quite\r\nirregular. But as in all four families we encounter the typical trizonal\r\nmedullary shell (or _Larnacilla_-shell), we are convinced that they must be\r\nderived (wholly or partially) from the Larnacida.\r\n\r\nThe Lithelida (the sixth family) are #Larcoidea# with spiral growth and\r\nbilateral form (like _Nautilus_); therefore the spiral line lies in one\r\nplane and this spiral plane divides the whole shell into two symmetrical\r\nhalves (right and left). The axis of the spiral (around which the shell\r\nwinds) is a straight line, one of the three dimensive axes. In the greater\r\npart of Lithelida (in the Larcospirida) the primordial of central chamber\r\nof the polythalamous shell is a trizonal medullary shell or\r\n_Larnacilla_-shell, and the growth of the first spiral turning begins as\r\nthe development of the first (transverse) cortical girdle of _Amphipyle_;\r\nbut as one wing (or lateral half) of this girdle grows more rapidly than\r\nthe other, it overgrows the latter and begins the spiral winding; if the\r\nother wing follow and overgrow the first, the spiral becomes double. Each\r\nof the three dimensive girdles (of the Pylonida) may begin the spiral\r\nwinding. There can be no doubt that all these Lithelida (the Larcospirida)\r\nmust be derived from the Pylonida, by unequal growth of the two halves of\r\none girdle. Perhaps from these may also derived the other part of this\r\nfamily, the Spiremida (_Spirema_ and _Lithelius_); in these the primordial\r\nchamber of the spiral shell is simple, and may be derived by reduction of\r\nthe original _Larnacilla_-shell. But it is also possible that the Spiremida\r\nproceed directly from the Larcarida, and that their ancestors did not\r\npossess a _Larnacilla_-shell.\r\n\r\nThe Streblemida (the seventh family) are #Larcoidea# with spiral growth and\r\nasymmetrical form of the polythalamous shell (like _Helix_ or\r\n_Turrilites_); therefore the spiral line is twisted like a winding stair,\r\nand the spiral face is curved and divides the shell into two unequal\r\nhalves. The Streblemida have the same likeness and relation to the\r\nturbinoid Foraminifera (_Rotalia_, _Globigerina_, &c.) as the Lithelida to\r\nthe nautiloid Foraminifera (_Polystomella_, _Nummulina_, &c.). As in these\r\ncalcareous Rhizopods also the peculiar growth of the siliceous Streblemida\r\nbegins from a primordial chamber to which a variable number of roundish\r\nchambers (of increasing size) is apposed. But the building of these\r\nchambers and of their septa is by no means so regular and complete as in\r\nthe greater number of turbinoid Foraminifera. As in a part of this family\r\nthe primordial chamber is _Larnacilla_-shell, these also may be derived\r\nfrom the Larnacida, but the other part (with simple central chamber) is\r\nperhaps produced directly from the Larcarida.\r\n\r\nThe eighth family, Soreumida, is perhaps derived from the Streblemida by\r\nthe loss of the spiral growth. The polythalamous shell is similar to the\r\nlatter, but the chambers are {604}aggregated without any order, like the\r\nAcervulinida among the Foraminifera. In some cases also here the primordial\r\nchamber is a trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell, in other cases it is a simple,\r\nsubspherical or lentelliptical shell.\r\n\r\nThe last family, the Phorticida, is formed of irregular #Larcoidea#, in\r\nwhich a lentelliptical trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell (as an inner medullary\r\nshell) is enveloped by an irregular, latticed, or spongy cortical shell.\r\nThey can be regarded as abnormalities or irregular deformities of Larnacida\r\nor Pylonida.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule of the #Larcoidea# is originally lentelliptical and\r\npreserves this form, the \"triaxial ellipsoid,\" in the greater number of\r\ngenera. In some groups it follows the prevalent growth of the shell in the\r\ndirection of one of the three dimensive axes, and becomes prolonged in this\r\nway. In many chambered forms (particularly Tholonida and Zonarida) the\r\ngrowing central capsule gets constricted, corresponding to the\r\nconstrictions of the shell. In the Soreumida and Phorticida its form often\r\nbecomes irregular.

It commences with _Cenolarcus_, a quite\r\nsimple lentelliptical latticed shell, which is characterised by three\r\nunequal isopolar dimensive axes, perpendicular one to another. The major of\r\nthese three axes is the longitudinal or principal, the middle is the\r\nlateral or transverse, and the minor is the equatorial or sagittal axis (as\r\nin the human body). Among the three dimensive planes, which are determined\r\nby pairs of these axes, the lateral plane is the largest (halved by the\r\ncrossed principal and lateral axes). The intermediate is the sagittal plane\r\nor median plane (halved by the crossed principal and sagittal axes). The\r\nsmallest is the equatorial plane or transverse plane (halved by the crossed\r\nlateral and sagittal axes). Therefore the shell has all the characters of\r\nthe true _Lentellipsis_ or of the \"triaxial ellipsoid,\" and its axes agree\r\nwith the three axes of the \"rhombic crystalline system.\"\r\n\r\nIn the three subfamilies of Larcarida this lentelliptical shell assumes a\r\ndifferent shape: in the Cenolarcida it remains simple, in the Spongolarcida\r\nit becomes spongy (sometimes quite filled out with a spongy framework), in\r\nthe Coccolarcida it is composed of two or more concentric lentelliptical\r\nshells (at least an inner medullary and one outer cortical shell). These\r\nshells are simply connected by radial beams, and not, as in the Larnacida,\r\nby latticed wings (or half girdles).\r\n\r\nThe network of the Larcarida shell is sometimes regular, commonly irregular\r\n(as in the greater number of #Larcoidea#). The surface of the shell is\r\nsometimes smooth or thorny, at other times covered with radial spines.\r\nThese are often symmetrically disposed, either on the poles of the\r\ndimensive axes or in crossed diagonal planes.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule is a true \"lentellipsis\" in a geometrical sense; it is\r\nhalved by three elliptical dimensive planes of different sizes,\r\nperpendicular one to another. In the Cenolarcida the central capsule lies\r\nfreely inside the simple (cortical) shell, only separated from it by the\r\njelly-mantle. In the Coccolarcida it contains the medullary shell, and is\r\nenclosed by the simple or double cortical shell, perforated by the radial\r\nbeams connecting the two shells. The spongy shell of the Spongolarcida\r\nexhibits a different relation to the central capsule: in _Spongolarcus_ the\r\nlatter lies freely in the internal cavity of the spongy shell; in\r\n_Stypolarcus_, where this cavity is quite filled with a spongy network, the\r\ncentral capsule also contains a part of it.\r\n\r\nThe morphological and phylogenetic relations of the Larcarida to the other\r\nfamilies of SPUMELLARIA admit of a different explanation. As this family\r\ncontains the {606}most simple forms of all #Larcoidea#, we can regard the\r\n_Cenolarcus_ as the common ancestral form of this group, having originated\r\nfrom _Actilarcus_ (or the lentelliptical _Actissa_) by the building of a\r\nsimple lentelliptical lattice-shell. But it is also possible that a part of\r\nthe Larcarida (or all?) descend from Larnacida by reduction or loss of the\r\noriginal _Larnacilla_-shell (compare _Cenolarcus triaxonius_, p. 607).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of the Larcarida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The simple latticed shell is distinguished from that of\r\nthe three other genera by its typical lentelliptical form, a triaxial\r\nellipsoid with three dimensive axes of unequal length. Probably\r\n_Cenolarcus_ is the original ancestral form of the #Larcoidea#, derived\r\nfrom _Actilarcus_ (the lentelliptical _Actissa_) by the formation of a\r\nsimple fenestrated shell around the lentelliptical central capsule.

In both the\r\nlentelliptical shell is composed of two concentric shells, an inner\r\n(medullary) and an outer (cortical) shell. But the connection between these\r\nshells and the construction of the inner shell is quite different in the\r\ntwo groups. Whilst in the Larcarida the medullary shell is connected with\r\nthe cortical shell simply by radial beams, here in the Larnacida this\r\nconnection is effected by two latticed lamellæ, which are the lateral wings\r\nof a transverse girdle. Therefore we encounter here for the first time that\r\npeculiar mode of growth which characterises the greater part of the\r\n#Larcoidea#, but particularly the Pylonida. But whilst in the Pylonida\r\nbetween the three crossed lattice-girdles, remain four open gates, here in\r\nthe Larnacida the gates become closed by lattice-work; the lentelliptical\r\ncortical shell becomes perfect.\r\n\r\nThe most simple genus of Larnacida, and no doubt the common ancestral form\r\nof this whole family, is _Larnacilla_ (Pl. 50, figs. 1, 1_a_, 1_b_). The\r\nmost important shell of this typical genus is composed of a simple\r\nlentelliptical medullary shell and of three elliptical latticed girdles\r\nsurrounding it, perpendicular one to another. These three \"dimensive\r\ngirdles\" lie in the perimeter of the three dimensive planes, the minor (and\r\nfirst) in the equatorial plane, the second (and major) in the lateral\r\nplane, the third (and intermediate) in the sagittal plane. Therefore we\r\nhave before us the same \"trizonal shell\" as in the important genus\r\n_Trizonium_ among the Pylonida. But whilst in _Trizonium_, as in all\r\nPylonida, the four gates between the girdles remain open, here in\r\n_Larnacilla_ they become perfectly closed by lattice-work.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the typical \"_Larnacilla_-shell\" begins with a simple,\r\nspherical or lentelliptical lattice-shell, from both sides of which arise\r\ntwo latticed \"lateral wings\" opposite on the poles of the transverse axis.\r\nThese two wings are comparable to the lateral chambers of _Tholartus_\r\n(among the Tholonida), but differ by two large openings. Each wing is a\r\nshort cylindrical tube with latticed wall, open at both ends; the axis of\r\nthe tube (going through the centre of the open ends) is parallel to the\r\nprincipal axis of the whole shell (and of the central chamber). Therefore\r\nboth wings form together a transverse ring, the middle of which encloses\r\nthe central chamber. The distal parts of both wings grow towards the poles\r\nof the principal axis; if they became united here, the second (lateral)\r\ngirdle would be complete. Between it and the first girdle four open gates\r\nremain (\"_Tetrapyle_\"); but these become overgrown by the third or sagittal\r\ngirdle, and at last the gates between this and the two other girdles become\r\nclosed by lattice-work. This perfect fenestration of the trizonal cortical\r\nshell, and the complete closing of the gates between the girdles by\r\nnetwork, is the only difference between _Trizonium_ and _Larnacilla_.\r\n\r\nIn _Larnacilla_ and in the nearly allied _Larnacidium_ (only differing by\r\nradial spines {616}on the surface) the \"trizonal shell\" is an external or\r\n\"cortical shell,\" enclosing the central capsule, the interior of which only\r\ncontains the simple central chamber and the jointed proximal parts of both\r\nlateral wings. In the other genera of Larnacida (by proceeding growth) this\r\ntrizonal _Larnacilla_-shell becomes enclosed by the growing central capsule\r\nand is now only a \"medullary shell,\" whilst on the outside of the central\r\ncapsule in the same manner is developed an outer cortical shell\r\n(_Larnacalpis_, _Larnacantha_); and perhaps the same process may be\r\nrepeated. But sometimes also this cortical shell becomes doubled by a\r\nsimple envelop of network (_Larnacoma_). In the Larnacospongida the\r\ncortical shell is composed of a spongy framework (corresponding to the\r\nSpongolarcida in the foregoing family).\r\n\r\nThe lattice-work of the Larnacida is commonly irregular (as in most other\r\n#Larcoidea#), and its pores have little signification for the different\r\nspecies. On the outer surface often arise radial spines, symmetrically\r\ndisposed either in dimensive planes or in diagonal planes.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule is constantly a true lentellipsis or a \"triaxial\r\nellipsoid,\" characterised by three halving, elliptical dimensive planes,\r\nperpendicular one to another. It bears a different relation to the skeleton\r\nin the two subfamilies of Larnacida. In the first subfamily, the\r\nLarnacillida (_Larnacilla_, _Larnacidium_), the central capsule encloses\r\nonly the simple spherical or lentelliptical central chamber (\"simple\r\nmedullary shell\"), and is enveloped by the trizonal cortical shell. In the\r\nother subfamily, the Larnacalpida (_Larnacalpis_, _Larnacospongus_, &c.),\r\nthis trizonal \"_Larnacilla_-shell\" becomes enclosed by the overgrowing\r\ncentral capsule, which now becomes enveloped by an external, latticed or\r\nspongy, lentelliptical \"cortical shell.\"\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Larnacida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Surface without\r\nradial spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Larnacilla_ represents the most simple form of Larnacida, and at\r\nthe same time the most important common ancestral form, from which the\r\ngreater number of #Larcoidea# may be derived, viz., all those genera which\r\npossess  the characteristic \"_Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell.\" This\r\ntypical form of medullary shell may be derived from the genus _Trizonium_\r\namong the Pylonida by the closing of the four open gates of this genus. The\r\nfree opening of these four gates becomes overgrown and closed by\r\nlattice-work, developed from the free edges of the three crossed girdles,\r\nand thus finally all three girdles are united in the form of a simple\r\nlentelliptical shell (Pl. 50, figs. 1, 1_a_, 1_b_). Seen from the sagittal\r\npoles (or from the poles of the shortest axis, fig. 1), the shell exhibits\r\non both sides of the small spherical medullary shell the two lateral wings\r\nof the transverse girdle from the face; seen from the lateral poles (or\r\nfrom the poles of the transverse axis, fig. 1_a_), one of these wings\r\nappears in the optical section as an oblong ring, which seemingly encloses\r\nthe concentric medullary shell, and on both sides is grown together with\r\nthe sagittal girdle; seen from the principal poles (or from the poles of\r\nthe longitudinal axis, fig. 1_b_), both wings exhibit their elliptical\r\nopening (at the right and left from the central medullary shell). The two\r\nconcentric shells are only connected by the two lateral tube-like wings of\r\nthe transverse girdle; the lateral and the sagittal girdles have no\r\nconnection with the medullary shell.

Medullary shell double, _Larnacilla_-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Larnacalpis_ represents the most simple form of the sub-family\r\nLarnacalpida, and is very important as the common original form of all\r\nthose #Larcoidea# in which a double _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell is\r\nsurrounded by a simple, perfectly closed, latticed, lentelliptical cortical\r\nshell. Therefore the same typical, trizonal, lentelliptical shell, which in\r\n_Larnacilla_ represents the external envelop (or cortical shell) of the\r\ncentral capsule, here in _Larnacalpis_ becomes enclosed as an internal\r\nnucleus (or medullary shell) in the interior of the central capsule, and\r\nthis latter becomes overgrown by a new lentelliptical cortical shell. The\r\nconnection between the two shells of _Larnacalpis_ is either effected by a\r\nnumber of radial beams (e.g., in _Larnacalpis triaxonia_ by six beams\r\nsituated in the three dimensive axes), or by two lateral, latticed,\r\ntube-like wings, which are repetitions of the smaller lateral wings\r\nconnecting its external shell with the internal medullary shell (as in\r\n_Larnacalpis lentellipsis_).

One, two, or three concentric systems of\r\nsuch girdles (each system with three girdles) may be developed.\r\n\r\nThe family #Pylonida# is the most important and interesting among all the\r\n#Larcoidea#, not only because it is much richer in different and peculiar\r\nforms than the other families of this section, but also because it has\r\ndirect and very complex relations to all the other families of #Larcoidea#.\r\nIt is even possible that the Pylonida represent the original ancestral\r\ngroup of the whole section, and that the apparently simpler group of the\r\nLarcarida must be derived from the former by retrogressive metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nTill the year 1881 the family Pylonida, which here now exhibits ten genera\r\nwith eighty-six species, was only represented by one single species,\r\naccurately described and extensively illustrated by Johannes Müller in\r\n1858, the well known and widely distributed cosmopolitan _Tetrapyle\r\noctacantha_ (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 33, Taf. iii.). A\r\nslight modification of it was afterwards described by Ehrenberg as\r\n_Schizomma quadrilobum_ (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1872, Taf.\r\nii. fig. 12). A more accurate description of it, with a good explanation of\r\nits characteristic growth, was given in 1879 by Richard Hertwig in his\r\nOrganismus der Radiolarien (pp. 52-54, Taf. iv. figs. 7, 8; Taf. vi. figs.\r\n2, 5). In my Prodromus (1881, p. 463) I constituted for a large number of\r\nallied species, detected in the Challenger collection, the special family\r\nPylonida, and distinguished among it twelve different genera. However, I\r\nthink it now better to restrict the definition of the family as given in\r\nthe above definition, and to remove from it a number of genera formerly\r\nwith it united, as the genera _Triopyle_ and _Hexapyle_, appertaining to\r\nthe #Discoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic type of all true Pylonida is clearly demonstrated by\r\ntheir peculiar mode of growth, the consequence of which is the imperfect\r\nlattice-work of the fenestrated larcoid shell. This remarkable growth is\r\neffected by the development of elliptical latticed girdles (or rings),\r\nwhich enclose a quite simple, spherical, subspherical, or lentelliptical\r\nprimordial shell. The girdles lie in three different planes, perpendicular\r\nto one another, and are of different sizes; each girdle being somewhat\r\nlarger than the foregoing and somewhat smaller than the following girdle.\r\nBetween these latticed girdles remain on the surface of the shell large\r\nopenings or \"gates,\" which are not closed by network, and it is just the\r\nsymmetrical disposition and form of these open \"gates,\" separated and\r\nenclosed by the fenestrated girdles, which give to the Pylonida their\r\ncharacteristic appearance.\r\n\r\n{629}To understand clearly this peculiar constitution of the Pylonida-shell\r\nby a system of alternating girdles, developing one after the other it is\r\nindispensable to pay careful attention to the three different elliptical\r\ndimensive planes, which characterise all #Larcoidea#, and to the three\r\ndifferent dimensive axes, which bisect those planes. The girdle which first\r\ndevelops around simple primordial shell or central chamber is the\r\ntransverse girdle, lying in the equatorial plane; then comes, secondly, the\r\nlateral girdle, lying in the lateral plane; and thirdly follows the\r\nsagittal girdle, lying in the sagittal or median plane. The three simplest\r\ngenera of the Pylonida--_Monozonium_, _Dizonium_, _Trizonium_--represent\r\nthese three different stages, with one, two, or three girdles. These three\r\ngenera constitute the first subfamily, Haplozonaria (with one single system\r\nof girdles); all three girdles lie in the surface of a simple\r\nlentelliptical cortical shell.\r\n\r\nFrom this first subfamily the other two subfamilies of Pylonida must be\r\nderived, by repetition of the same characteristic process of growth. In the\r\nDiplozonaria a second system of girdles has been developed, constituting a\r\nsecond (outer) cortical shell of lentelliptical form, concentric with the\r\nfirst. Also in this second system the transverse girdle is first developed,\r\nsecondly the lateral girdle, thirdly the sagittal girdle. The three genera\r\n_Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_ (with _Octopyle_), and _Pylonium_ represent these\r\nthree different stages of growth.\r\n\r\nCommonly the growth of the Pylonida stops with the completion of the second\r\nsystem but sometimes the same process is once repeated and a third system\r\nof girdles is formed, constituting a third lentelliptical shell; in this\r\ncase also the succession of the three latticed girdles is the same; firstly\r\nthe (third) transverse girdle is formed, secondly the (third) lateral\r\ngirdle, and thirdly the (third) sagittal girdle. Each of these three\r\ngirdles of the third system encloses concentrically the corresponding\r\ngirdles of the second and first system. The three corresponding genera of\r\nthis third subfamily (Triplozonaria) are _Amphipylonium_, _Tetrapylonium_,\r\nand _Pylozonium_. But in general this highest number of girdles (nine) is\r\nvery seldom reached; commonly the growth of the Pylonida stops with five\r\ngirdles (_Tetrapyle_ and _Octopyle_). More than nine girdles I have never\r\nobserved, though there remains the possibility of the apposition of a\r\nfourth system owing to the peculiar imperfect character of the growth\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe central or primordial chamber of the shell, with which in all Pylonida\r\nthe shell-building commences, is a quite simple, very small fenestrated\r\nshell. Commonly one sees on the surface only five to ten small pores (three\r\nto four on the diameter). Its form seems to be sometimes spherical,\r\nsometimes elongated, ellipsoidal or probably lentelliptical. It may be\r\noriginally a small _Cenolarcus_. This simple central chamber, the true\r\n\"medullary shell\" of the small Haplozonaria, is quite different from the\r\nmedullary shell of the larger Diplozonaria, and particularly of the\r\nwell-known _Tetrapyle_. The former observers, J. Müller as well as R.\r\nHertwig, have described in these forms also the medullary shell as a simple\r\nspherical or oblong body. But a careful {630}comparison of many hundred\r\nspecimens of them and of their dimensions, has convinced me that this was\r\nan error, and that the small spherical or elliptical medullary shell of\r\n_Tetrapyle_ and the other Diplozonaria possesses already the same complex\r\nstructure, composed of a system of three girdles, as _Trizonium_ and\r\n_Larnacilla_. Whilst in the Haplozonaria probably the simple central\r\nchamber only represents the medullary shell (enclosed in the central\r\ncapsule), and the first system of girdles (complete in _Trizonium_) the\r\nexternal cortical shell, with the progressive growth this latter becomes\r\nenclosed in the central capsule and so constitutes the \"trizonal medullary\r\nshell\" of the Diplozonaria and Triplozonaria.\r\n\r\nA very difficult matter is the mode of connection between the cortical and\r\nmedullary shell. In most of the Pylonida it seems that the first or\r\ntransverse girdle (in each system) is produced by the formation of two\r\nlateral wings or chambers (one on each side of the medullary shell), so\r\nthat each wing (or half girdle) represents a short and wide, nearly\r\ncylindrical tube, the axis of which (with free openings on both poles) is\r\nparallel to the principal axis of the medullary shell. In this case\r\n(probably the ordinary one) both principal faces of the medullary shell\r\nitself (dorsal and ventral face) constitute the middle part of the first\r\ngirdle whilst its lateral parts are formed by the wings (comparable to the\r\nlateral chambers of _Amphitholus_).\r\n\r\nIn the second case (probably a much rarer one) there is a free ring-shaped\r\nspace between the medullary shell and the first (transverse) girdle, and\r\nboth are connected by a small number of very short and small radial beams\r\n(R. Hertwig, _loc. cit._, p. 52, line 19 to 21 from above). This mode of\r\nconnection would be the same as is common between the concentric shells of\r\nthe #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea#. The distinction between these two\r\ndifferent modes of connection is often very difficult.\r\n\r\nThe second or lateral girdle is commonly not in direct connection with the\r\nmedullary shell, or only by some scattered radial beams (mainly in the\r\nprincipal axis). This lateral guide arises by prolongation of both wings of\r\nthe transverse girdle in the lateral plane, so that from both sides (right\r\nand left) they become united on the poles of the principal axis. The minor\r\naxis of the elliptical lateral ring (thus formed) is therefore the major\r\naxis of the foregoing (transverse) elliptical ring; the major axes of both\r\nare perpendicular one to another. The major axis of the lateral ring is the\r\nprincipal (or longitudinal) axis of the whole body.\r\n\r\nThe third or sagittal girdle becomes developed from the second almost in\r\nthe same manner as the second from the first. On both poles of the\r\nprincipal axis two latticed wings arise from the lateral girdle, growing\r\nfurther in the direction of an elliptical ring, which represents the\r\nperimeter of the sagittal plane or median plane. These wings are already\r\nmentioned by J. Müller as \"prominent roofs, protecting the gates of the\r\n_Tetrapyle_-shell.\" If these roofs grow towards the equatorial plane of the\r\nshell and become united in pairs on the poles of the sagittal axis, the\r\nthird girdle becomes {631}complete. R. Hertwig supposes that the minor axis\r\nof this sagittal girdle is constantly at the same time the major axis of\r\nthe lateral girdle, but this is not always the case. Very often the size of\r\nboth these girdles is nearly the same, or one is not much larger than the\r\nother. In this case the principal axis of the body is the major axis of the\r\nsecond as well as of the third girdle.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic \"gates\" of the Pylonida, or the large wide openings in\r\ntheir cortical shell, remaining between the crossed latticed girdles, are\r\nin general roundish, sometimes nearly circular, commonly more elliptical,\r\nkidney-shaped or semilunar, their special form varying much according to\r\nthe different form of the girdles. The narrowest part of each girdle, or\r\nits \"isthmus,\" in the case of the halves of the transverse girdle is\r\ncommonly at their origin from the medullary shell, in the case of the\r\nhalves of the lateral girdle at the poles of the principal axis, and in the\r\ncase of the halves of the sagittal girdle at the poles of the sagittal\r\naxis. The number of the gates is quite constant in the different genera. If\r\nonly one girdle (the transverse) be developed, we find only two large\r\ngates, between the two wings on the poles of the principal axis (in\r\n_Monozonium_, _Amphipyle_, _Amphipylonium_). In all other cases there are\r\nfour gates (determining the original name \"_Tetrapyle_\"), as well if only\r\ntwo or if all three girdles be completed. If two girdles be complete (in\r\n_Dizonium_, _Tetrapyle_, _Tetrapylonium_) the four gates lie opposite in\r\npairs on the sagittal faces (two anterior and two posterior gates), and are\r\nlimited by the transverse and lateral girdles. If all three girdles be\r\ncomplete (in _Trizonium_, _Pylonium_, _Pylozonium_) the four gates lie\r\nopposite in pairs on the lateral faces (two dorsal and two ventral gates),\r\nand are limited by the sagittal and the transverse girdles. If we turn the\r\nshell through an angle of 90°, we have the same aspect as in the former\r\ngroup. A sagittal septum sometimes becomes developed, beginning with two\r\npolar beams, rising from the poles of the principal axis. If these polar\r\nbeams become branched and connected with the middle part of the lateral\r\ngirdle, we get a latticed vertical septum, which divides the four gates of\r\n_Tetrapyle_ into eight gates, _Octopyle_.\r\n\r\nThe lattice-work of the Pylonida is commonly very variable and irregular,\r\nwith roundish meshes of very unequal size, therefore without value in the\r\ndetermination of the species. Commonly the outside of the shell is thorny,\r\nand often distinguished by larger radial spines, symmetrically disposed. We\r\ncan separate these into two groups; \"dimensive\" spines, lying in one of the\r\nthree dimensive axes (principal, transverse, or sagittal), and \"diagonal\"\r\nspines, lying crossed in pairs in diagonal axes. Among these latter eight\r\ndiagonal wing-spines, which arise from the lateral edges of the four gates,\r\nare particularly remarkable; they are not only characteristic of _Tetrapyle\r\noctacantha_, but also of a large number of other Pylonida, and form the\r\nstarting-point for many specific forms.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Pylonida is characterised by extraordinary variability and\r\ngreat {632}inclination to individual abnormalities, formation of varieties\r\nand transitions into other families, hence derived, as Larnacida,\r\nTholonida, Lithelida, &c.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule in all Pylonida, in which I could observe it, was a\r\ntrue lentellipsis (or a \"triaxial ellipsoid\" in the geometrical sense, with\r\nthe three unequal isopolar axes of the \"rhombic octahedron\"). In the living\r\nPylonida it is commonly coloured pink or scarlet. During growth its\r\ndimensions are probably more or less changed, and perhaps the axes\r\nalternate. Regarding the relation of the central capsule to the skeleton,\r\nwe can distinguish two different groups, quite as in the nearly allied\r\nLarnacida. In the Haplozonaria (as also in the Larnacillida) the central\r\ncapsule encloses only the central chamber and is enveloped by the first\r\nsystem of girdles, whereas in the Diplozonaria and Triplozonaria (as in the\r\nLarnacalpida) that \"trizonal shell\" becomes enclosed (as the \"medullary\r\nshell\") in the central capsule, which is now enveloped by the second system\r\nof girdles as the \"cortical shell.\"\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Pylonida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

This transverse\r\ngirdle is composed of three parts, the central chamber and two lateral\r\nwings, which represent two short hollow latticed tubes, the axes of which\r\nare parallel to the principal axis. On both principal sides (on the\r\nanterior and posterior faces) there are two large open gates as in\r\n_Amphipyle_. If we imagine the openings of the tube-shaped lateral wings\r\nclosed by lattice-work, _Monozonium_ becomes transformed into _Tholartus_,\r\nthe most simple form of Tholonida.

Müller, 1858, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.\r\nAkad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 154.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,\r\nsurrounded by two crossed latticed cortical girdles, one smaller (primary)\r\ntransverse, and one larger (secondary) lateral girdle. Four gates between\r\nthe two cortical girdles simple, without a sagittal septum.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Tetrapyle_, till 1881 the only known genus of the whole family,\r\nwas founded by Johannes Müller in 1858, and clearly illustrated by the\r\nMediterranean (and common cosmopolitan) _Tetrapyle octacantha_, hitherto\r\nthe best known type of this family. Afterwards (1860, Monatsber. d. k.\r\npreuss. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 832) Ehrenberg founded the genus\r\n_Schizomma_ for a nearly allied form, which exhibits only slight specific\r\ndifferences (compare my Monograph, 1862, p. 434). Some good remarks on the\r\nstructure of this typical genus and its relations to other Pylonida are to\r\nbe found in Richard Hertwig's Organismus, &c., 1879, p. 52, but the true\r\ntrizonal structure of the medullary shell in this genus was not recognised\r\nby him, so that his description agrees more with _Dizonium_. We confine\r\nhere the genus _Tetrapyle_ to those Pylonida for which _Tetrapyle\r\noctacantha_ of J. Müller remains the determining type; the cortical shell\r\nis composed only of two perfect lattice-girdles (the transverse and\r\nlateral), between which four wide gates remain open. This structure is\r\nsimilar to that of _Dizonium_; but whilst here the medullary shell is a\r\nsimple central chamber, in _Tetrapyle_ it is a complete trizonal or\r\n_Larnacilla_-shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Tetrapylissa_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Cortical shell smooth or thorny, but without large,\r\nsymmetrically disposed spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n{645}1. _Tetrapyle circularis_, n. sp.

(Pl. 10).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with regular, completely latticed cortical\r\nshell, which is composed of two to six or more hemispherical or cap-shaped\r\ndomes (vaulted chambers or cupolas). The domes lie opposite in pairs on the\r\npoles of the three dimensive axes, are separated by annular constrictions,\r\nand surround a simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber.\r\n\r\nThe family #Tholonida# represents a peculiar and very remarkable group of\r\nthe #Larcoidea#, distinguished from the other groups of this suborder by\r\nthe characteristic form of the shell, composed of a variable number of\r\nhemispherical domes or cupolas. The middle and original part of the shell\r\nis constantly formed of an elliptical or subspherical central chamber,\r\nwhich often, but not constantly, contains a small medullary shell. An even\r\nnumber (two, four, six, or more) of domes is attached to the poles of the\r\nthree dimensive axes of the central chamber; according as only one, or two,\r\nor all three axes develop cupolas, we distinguish in this family three\r\ndifferent subfamilies (the Amphitholida, Staurotholida, and Cubotholida).\r\nThe Amphitholida (or Tholonida monaxonia) form cupolas only on the two\r\npoles of one single axis, and this axis corresponds to the minor (or\r\ntransverse) axis of the central chamber, we find here therefore constantly\r\nat least two lateral cupolas (Pl. 10, figs. 1-7). The Staurotholida (or\r\nTholonida diaxonia) form cupolas on the poles of two axes perpendicular one\r\nto another; these two axes are the major (principal) and the minor\r\n(transverse) axis of the central chamber, we find here therefore constantly\r\nat least four cupolas crossed in pairs (Pl. 10, figs. 8-11).  The\r\nCubotholida (or Tholonida triaxonia) form cupolas on the poles of all three\r\ndimensive axes (perpendicular one to another); corresponding to the\r\nprincipal, transverse, and sagittal axes of the lentelliptical central\r\nchamber; therefore we find here constantly at least six cupolas, attached\r\nin pairs on the six sides of the central chamber (Pl. 10, figs. 12-17).\r\n\r\nThe number of genera and species in the family #Tholonida# is rather large,\r\nbut the number of individuals is much smaller than in most of the other\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and {661}particularly than in the nearly allied Pylonida; the\r\ngreater number of the species are very rare. Besides this they seem to be\r\nvery variable and inclined to produce numerous abnormalities. Very often\r\nintermediate forms of transition are to be found between the Tholonida and\r\nother #Larcoidea#, particularly the Pylonida and Lithelida. In many species\r\nthe thick-walled shell is very opaque, and offers great difficulties to the\r\nclear study; in the greater number the structure of the shell cannot be\r\nunderstood completely without rolling the shell to the different sides; and\r\nthe distinction between the Staurotholida and Cubotholida is often very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe primordial chamber of the Tholonida, or the central chamber in which\r\nits growth begins, is either a simple lentelliptical shell (without\r\nenclosed medullary shell), like _Cenolarcus_, or it is a trizonal shell,\r\nlike _Larnacilla_, and contains a small concentric medullary shell. But\r\nthis important inner shell of the central chamber offers peculiar\r\ndifficulties for study. In many cases (probably in the greater number)\r\nthere is no doubt the same characteristic trizonal medullary shell, which\r\nwe found in the Larnacida and Pylonida, and this is our principal argument,\r\nif we regard the Tholonida as #Larcoidea#, which are most nearly allied to\r\nboth these families, and in which the fenestrated open cortical girdles of\r\nthe Pylonida are replaced by fenestrated closed cupolas or domes; the\r\ncharacteristic \"gates\" or large fissures in the cortical shell of the\r\nformer are therefore here perfectly closed by network. The Tholonida agree\r\nin this point with the Larnacida, but are distinguished from them by the\r\nprominent vaultings of the hemispherical cupolas or domes, which give them\r\na peculiar appearance. Each pair of domes (opposite on both poles of one\r\ndimensive axis) corresponds to one single girdle of the Pylonida.\r\n\r\nRegarding the absence or presence of a medullary shell in the central\r\nchamber, we may divide the Tholonida into two groups, Cenotholida (without\r\nmedullary shell) and Coccotholida (with medullary shell). The absence of\r\nthe medullary shell in many Tholonida may be either primary (original) or\r\nsecondary (by reduction and loss of it). Probably in the larger proportion\r\n(if not always?) its absence is the consequence of reduction and loss, and\r\nin this case the Cenotholida must be derived phylogenetically from the\r\nCoccotholida, but possibly often (or always?) the contrary may also be the\r\ncase. At present we cannot find certain arguments for one opinion or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the medullary (internal) and the cortical (external)\r\nshell of the central chamber in the Coccotholida is effected by two lateral\r\nwings of a latticed transverse girdle; on both sides of the latter remain\r\nthe four internal open \"gates\" of the Pylonida and Larnacida. Very often\r\nthe limiting edges of these four gates are prolonged into eight external\r\nradial spines which lie opposite in pairs in two crossed diagonal planes,\r\nand correspond to the eight portal-spines of _Tetrapyle octacantha_.\r\nBesides these, we often find four other beams opposite in pairs in the two\r\ncrossed axes (principal and lateral).  Very often also these radial beams\r\n(between medullary and {662}cortical shells) are prolonged on the outside\r\ninto prominent free radial spines. But other spines may also arise from the\r\nsurface. Very remarkable is the presence of twenty symmetrically disposed\r\nradial spines in some forms of Amphitholida (_Amphitholus acanthometra_ and\r\n_Amphitholonium acanthonium_, &c.). It recalls the twenty radial spines of\r\nthe #Acanthonida#, though the laws of distribution in the two similar cases\r\nare quite different.\r\n\r\nThe cortical shell of the Tholonida remains either simple, or it becomes\r\ndoubled by formation of an outer veil or envelope. This outer cortical\r\nshell or \"veil\" may either repeat completely the typical form of the inner\r\nwith its cupolas, or it may form an ellipsoidal envelope without\r\ndome-shaped partitions. Its network is either like that of the inner, or it\r\nis very delicate and irregular, spider-web like. The connection between the\r\ntwo cortical shells is effected by a variable number of radial beams, often\r\nprolonged on the outside into radial spines.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Tholonida by apposition of new chambers is very\r\ncharacteristic, constantly pairs of chambers originating at both opposite\r\npoles of the three dimensive axes, firstly on the transverse axis, secondly\r\non the principal axis, thirdly on the sagittal axis. It is possible that by\r\nrepeated apposition of new chambers the Tholonida are transformed into\r\n#Discoidea#, but commonly the number of domes is restricted, two in the\r\nAmphitholida, four in the Staurotholida, six in the Coccotholida. If new\r\nchambers in an irregular manner or in a spiral order be opposed to those\r\nfirst formed pairs of chambers, the Tholonida may be transformed into\r\nSoreumida, Streblemida, or Lithelida. The phylogenetic connection between\r\nthese families is probably very complex and very worthy of further\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe network of the shell in the Tholonida is sometimes regular, with\r\ncircular (often hexagonally framed) pores of equal size, sometimes\r\nirregular, with roundish pores of unequal size. Commonly the shell is thick\r\nand compact; in those genera in which the cortical shell is doubled, the\r\ninner is commonly compact, the outer a very delicate veil.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule of the Tholonida is originally always enclosed by the\r\ncentral chamber, and like this of lentelliptical form, a triaxial\r\nellipsoid. With the apposition of cupolas the growing central capsule may\r\nform dome-shaped protuberances which enter into the former. So we may find\r\nin the Amphitholida a central capsule with three joints (separated by two\r\nannular parallel constrictions), in the Staurotholida a cross-shaped\r\ncapsule (with four caps around the central lentellipsis), in the\r\nCubotholida a clustered capsule with six caps, surrounding six sides of the\r\ncubical central mass. In the Coccotholida (with medullary shell in the\r\ncentral chamber) the latter encloses in the centre the nucleus of the cell.\r\nThe calymma, or the jelly-veil between the central capsule and the\r\nenveloping shell, probably always exhibits annular constrictions,\r\ncorresponding to those which separate the cupolas of the shell. All these\r\nanatomical peculiarities in the Tholonida require a further accurate study.\r\n\r\n{663}_Synopsis of the Genera of Tholonida._\r\n\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

Therefore\r\nthis species may be the representative of a peculiar genus, the most highly\r\ndeveloped of all Tholonida--_Tholothauma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cubotholonium sphæroides_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nOuter cortical shell (or veil) spherical, with smooth surface; network very\r\ndelicate, with very thin bars and very small irregular, roundish pores.\r\nInner cortical shell simple, composed of six hemispherical cupolas,\r\nsurrounding the six sides of the cubical central chamber, which encloses a\r\nspherical medullary shell (one-third as large as itself).

(Pl. 50, figs. 9-12).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with regular, completely latticed cortical\r\nshell, distinguished by two to four or more annular constrictions, which\r\nlie (all or partly) in the dimensive planes (sagittal, transverse, or\r\nlateral), and by which four to eight or more vaulted cupolas or dome-like\r\nchambers become separated. In the centre of this chambered cortical shell\r\nlies constantly a trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Zonarida# comprises a small number of peculiar #Larcoidea#,\r\nresembling the Tholonida in the composition of the polythalamous cortical\r\nshell by a number of cupolas or dome-shaped protuberances. But the\r\ndisposition and origin of these latter {683}are quite different. Whilst in\r\nthe Tholonida the axes of the domes are dimensive axes, and these are\r\nseparated by annular constrictions lying in diagonal planes, in the\r\nZonarida we find the contrary; the axes of the domes are here diagonal\r\naxes, and these are separated by annular constrictions lying in dimensive\r\nplanes. However, this definition agrees absolutely only in the\r\nfour-chambered _Zonarium_ and in the eight-chambered _Zonidium_, whilst in\r\nthe six chambered _Zoniscus_ only four domes are disposed according to this\r\nlaw, two others, however, in the same manner as in the Tholonida. Therefore\r\nthis genus is intermediate between both families.\r\n\r\n_The Cortical Shell_ of the Zonarida is in all cases completely latticed\r\nand of regular lentelliptical fundamental form, as in the nearly allied\r\nLarnacida and Tholonida. The three dimensive axes are constantly of\r\ndifferent sizes, each with two equal poles; commonly (as in the human body)\r\nthe principal or longitudinal axis is the longest, the sagittal (or\r\ndorso-ventral) axis the shortest; the transverse (or lateral) axis being\r\nintermediate between them. Of the three dimensive planes the lateral plane\r\nis the largest (determined by the principal and transverse axes); the\r\nsmallest is the equatorial plane (crossed by the transverse and sagittal\r\naxes); the sagittal plane (determined by the sagittal and principal axes)\r\nbeing intermediate between them.\r\n\r\nThe annular constrictions of the cortical shell which produce the\r\ndome-shaped protuberances are different in number in the three known\r\ngenera--two, three, or four. To each constriction often (but not always)\r\ncorresponds an internal latticed septum, which connects the cortical with\r\nthe medullary shell. The number of the cupolas is always double the number\r\nof the annular constrictions by which they are separated, therefore four,\r\nsix, or eight.\r\n\r\nIn all known Zonarida the sagittal septum is quite constant, but derived\r\nfrom the original axial rod, which lies in the principal axis. By\r\nramification of this axial beam and reticular connection with the sagittal\r\ngirdle arises the sagittal septum, which we found first in _Octopyle_,\r\nhalving the four gates of _Tetrapyle_. Whilst this sagittal septum (between\r\nright and left halves of the body) is common to all three known genera of\r\nthis family, the number and shape of the other annular constrictions are\r\ndifferent. In _Zonarium_ (Pl. 50, fig. 9) we find only one transverse\r\nconstriction (in the equatorial plane), in _Zoniscus_ (figs. 10, 11) two\r\nparallel transverse constrictions (parallel to the equatorial plane, on\r\nboth sides of it). _Zonidium_ (fig. 12) is a combination of both foregoing\r\ngenera; it has three parallel transverse constrictions (one in the\r\nequatorial plane, and one on each side of it).\r\n\r\n_The Latticed Domes_ (cupolas or chambers) of the cortical shell exhibit\r\ncorrespondingly a different number and disposition in the three known\r\ngenera. In _Zonarium_ are found only four crossed chambers, separated by\r\nthe sagittal and transverse septa; the axes of the four crossed domes are\r\ndiagonal axes, whilst in the similar _Staurotholus_ they are dimensive axes\r\n(principal and transverse axes). In _Zonidium_ we find eight domes, each\r\ncupola of _Zonarium_ being halved by a diagonal septum. _Zoniscus_ is\r\nintermediate {684}between the two foregoing genera, and has six cupolas,\r\nthree on each side of the sagittal septum.\r\n\r\nThe inner communication of the cupolas or chambers is more or less free,\r\nthe lattice-work of the separating septa between them commonly remaining\r\nmore or less imperfect, or represented only by some isolated beams or\r\nmeshes. The outer network of the cupolas is commonly irregular (as in the\r\nmajority of #Larcoidea#), but sometimes distinguished by a small number of\r\nregularly disposed larger apertures (similar to the \"gates\" of the\r\nPylonida). From the surface radial spines often arise in characteristic\r\nnumber and symmetrical disposition, commonly as prolongations of the septal\r\naxes or of the constricted edges.\r\n\r\nThe _Medullary Shell_ in all Zonarida is a true trizonal or\r\n_Larnacilla_-shaped lattice-shell (compare above, p. 600); its perimeter\r\n(or the first lateral girdle) is sometimes more elliptical, at other times\r\nmore hexagonal; the hexagon is amphithect; both its lateral sides are often\r\nconcave and commonly longer than the four other sides.\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ in all Zonarida is in a strict geometrical sense a\r\ntrue lentellipsis (compare above, p. 599); its principal axis is commonly\r\none and a third to one and a half times as great as the transverse axis,\r\nand twice to three times as great as the sagittal axis. The lentelliptical\r\ncentral capsule encloses the trizonal medullary shell, whilst it is\r\nexternally enveloped by the chambered cortical shell.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Zonarida._\r\n\r\n  Two annular constrictions and four cupolas,      301. _Zonarium_.\r\n\r\n  Three annular constrictions and six cupolas,     302. _Zoniscus_.\r\n\r\n  Four annular constrictions and eight cupolas,    303. _Zonidium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 301. _Zonarium_,[341] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Zonarida# with four dome-shaped chambers of the cortical\r\nshell, separated by two annular constrictions (one sagittal and one\r\ntransverse).\r\n\r\nThe genus _Zonarium_ is the most simple form of the Zonarida, and differs\r\nfrom the nearly allied _Larnacalpis_ by two ring-like constrictions, which\r\nare crossed at right angles, one in the sagittal (or median) plane, and one\r\nin the transverse (or equatorial) plane. By these two annular constrictions\r\nfour egg-shaped or kidney-shaped chambers become imperfectly separated,\r\nwhich correspond to the quadrants of the lateral plane. The first cause of\r\nthe marked constrictions may be the formation of the latticed sagittal\r\nseptum, which is found first in _Octopyle_, as halving the four gates of\r\n{685}_Tetrapyle_. Between this septum and the constricted narrow transverse\r\ngirdle the cortical shell grows out in the form of four vaulted cupolas;\r\nevery two opposite domes are congruent, two neighbouring are symmetrically\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Zonarium quadrigatum_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCortical shell quadrangular, one and a half times as long as broad, with\r\nfour rounded corners.

Therefore both\r\nwings of the transverse girdle form here two opposite lateral or\r\n\"equatorial cupolas,\" as in _Amphitholus_. These are separated from four\r\nother domes (the \"corner cupolas\") by two transverse annular constrictions,\r\nwhich correspond to the free edges of the original transverse girdle.

Twelve longer edged radial spines; eight opposite in pairs in two\r\ncrossed diagonal planes (as in the foregoing species), four others in the\r\nlateral plane, opposite in pairs on both sides of the sagittal\r\nconstriction, which is scarcely twice as long as the hexagonal, in the\r\nequatorial plane constricted medullary shell.

Therefore the number of the septa (four) and the domes\r\n(eight) is here doubled. Among the eight cupolas we distinguish four median\r\n(on both sides of the sagittal plane) and four lateral (on both sides of\r\nthe equatorial plane); both groups are of different size and form. Probably\r\n_Zonidium_ is derived from _Zonarium_ by lattice-connection between the\r\neight diagonal wing-spines, which in both species of this genus are\r\npresent, the same as in _Tetrapyle octacantha_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Zonidium octostylium_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nCortical shell nearly quadrangular, with rounded corners and thorny\r\nsurface.

Radiol., p. 515.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with symmetrical spiral shell, divided by the\r\nspiral plane into two symmetrical halves; all windings of the spiral lie in\r\nthis plane. Primordial chamber either simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe family #Lithelida# comprises all those #Larcoidea# in which the growth\r\nof the latticed shell is spirally winding in one plane, _Nautilus_-like.\r\nThey agree in the spiral growth with the following family. But in the\r\nStreblonida the spiral is screw-shaped, {689}ascending (like _Helix_).\r\nTherefore in these latter the geometrical fundamental form of the shell is\r\nasymmetrical or \"dysdipleural,\" whereas in the Lithelida\r\nbilateral-symmetrical or \"eudipleural.\" The lentelliptical or nearly\r\nspherical shell may be divided by a median section into two symmetrical\r\nhalves; the right half is the mirror image of the left half.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1862 I founded the family Lithelida in my Monograph (p. 515), I\r\nknew only one genus, _Lithelius_, with two species. The rich material of\r\nthe Challenger collection contains a great number of similar spirally\r\nconstructed #Larcoidea#, so that at the present time we may distinguish at\r\nleast six genera. These belong to two different subfamilies, which may\r\npossibly be afterwards better separated as families. The first subfamily,\r\nSpiremida, possess a simple, spherical or subspherical, medullary shell;\r\nthe second subfamily, Larcospirida, possess a trizonal or\r\n_Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell. No doubt these latter must be derived\r\nfrom Pylonida, as we observe all stages of development starting from a\r\nsimple _Trizonium_; but perhaps also the Spiremida have the same origin,\r\ntheir simple, spherical or subspherical, medullary shell being derived from\r\na trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell by reduction.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance in both subfamilies of the Lithelida is quite the\r\nsame, and it requires a careful study of the medullary shell to distinguish\r\ncertainly the Spiremida from the Larcospirida. This distinction is often\r\nnot easy, particularly in the larger forms; the shell is often very opaque\r\nand difficult to understand. Only in one position, if the spiral axis be\r\nparallel to the axis of the eye of the observer, and the spiral plane be\r\ntherefore fully seen in the optical plane of the microscope, the spiral\r\nline (or the axial section of the latticed spiral lamella) is distinctly\r\nobserved; in all other positions the figure of the spiral is more or less\r\nindistinct, and the whole microscopical image often quite intricate and\r\nconfused. The sufficient study of this family requires therefore the\r\ncontemplation of the shell from different sides, and is the more difficult,\r\nas the variability of the Lithelida--as of the Pylonida--is extraordinarily\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe description which I gave of _Lithelius_ (1862) in my Monograph is in\r\nsome points erroneous, and was afterwards (1879) corrected by R. Hertwig,\r\nwho explained particularly the near relation of it to _Tetrapyle_. Indeed\r\nthe intermediate forms between the Lithelida and the Pylonida are so\r\nnumerous and so evident in all stages of development, that the derivation\r\nof the former (at least of the Larcospirida) from the latter is quite\r\nclear. The analogy between the structure of the Lithelida and the\r\ncalcareous (foraminiferous) Alveolinida is not so complete as I supposed it\r\nto be in my Monograph (1862); particularly the formation of the small\r\nchambers between the turnings of the spiral lamella is much more complete\r\nin the Alveolinida than in the Lithelida.\r\n\r\nThe cortical shell of all Lithelida has the same geometrical fundamental\r\nform as _Nautilus_ or as the nautiloid Polythalamia (_Polystomella_,\r\n_Nummulites_, &c.); therefore the shell is dipleural, being divided by the\r\nmedian plane into two symmetrical lateral halves. {690}Since the spiral\r\nline lies in the median plane, we will call it the spiral plane; it\r\nseparates the right half from the left. The axis of the body, around which\r\nthe spiral turns (without touching it), is the spiral axis. The latticed\r\npart of the cortical shell, which turns around them, is the spiral lamella.\r\nOnly in one genus of our family, viz., _Tholospira_, are the spiral axis,\r\nthe lateral axis, the spiral plane, and the sagittal plane quite as in\r\n_Nautilus_. In all other genera this disposition is different or is\r\nuncertain. This depends on the different part of the cortical shell, from\r\nwhich the spiral growth begins. In this respect we can distinguish four\r\ndifferent modes.\r\n\r\nIn the Larcospirida (or the Lithelida with _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary\r\nshell) the spiral growth exhibits four quite different forms. It begins\r\nhere with _Larcospira_, in which already the first cortical girdle of the\r\nDiplozonaria determines the spiral growth; one wing of this girdle, the\r\ntransverse girdle of _Amphipyle_, grows more swiftly than the other,\r\novergrows it, and thus turns around the principal axis. In _Pylospira_ the\r\nfirst or transverse girdle is already perfectly formed (as in _Amphipyle_),\r\nand the spiral growth is introduced by the second or lateral girdle of\r\n_Tetrapyle_; one wing of it (the right or the left) grows more swiftly than\r\nthe other, overgrows it, and thus turns around the sagittal axis. In\r\n_Tholospira_ also the second girdle is complete, and the spiral growth\r\nbegins from the third or sagittal girdle. One of its wings grows more\r\nswiftly than the other, overgrows it, and thus turns around the transverse\r\naxis. Consequently we see that each of the three dimensive planes of the\r\nlentelliptical Larcoid-body may be the spiral plane: in _Larcospira_ the\r\ntransverse plane, in _Pylospira_ the lateral plane, in _Tholospira_ the\r\nsagittal plane. Correspondingly the spiral axis in the first genus is the\r\nprincipal, in the second the sagittal, in the third the transverse axis of\r\nthe central _Larnacilla_-shell. Therefore in these three genera the spiral\r\nplane is the plane of the latticed girdle, which determines the spiral\r\ngrowth, one of both its wings overgrowing the other.\r\n\r\nIn each of the three above mentioned genera the spiral may be simple or\r\ndouble; it remains simple if only one of both wings of the turning girdle\r\novergrow the other, and this latter remain a simple half girdle (or\r\ntube-like wing). Whereas the spiral becomes double if the second wing of\r\nthe girdle afterwards follow the example of the first wing and now turn\r\naround it in the same direction. As this happens in all three genera, we\r\ncan subdivide them into six subgenera.\r\n\r\nA quite peculiar form of spiral growth is produced in _Spironium_, in which\r\nthe direction of growth in both lateral wings of the transverse girdle is\r\ninverse from the beginning. The left wing grows against the posterior, the\r\nright wing against the anterior pole of the principal axis, turning around\r\nit in crossed, eight-like spirals. The whole shell afterwards assumes a\r\nlentelliptical form.\r\n\r\nCommonly between the embracing spiral turnings or convolutions a great\r\nnumber of radial beams is developed, irregularly disposed and often\r\nbranching; they support the {691}thin spiral lamellæ and give to the whole\r\nshell more solidity. Often these beams form imperfect radial septa, by\r\nwhich the spiral cavity of the turnings is divided into a variable number\r\nof chambers. But these chambers never become so regular and perfect as in\r\nthe analogous nautiloid Polythalamia.\r\n\r\nIn many Lithelida the growth of the shell reaches a certain limit,\r\nconcluding with the formation of a superficial latticed lamella of\r\nlentelliptical or nearly spherical form. In many other forms of the family\r\nthis seems not to be the case; but these may possibly be younger forms,\r\nafterwards reaching the same limit.\r\n\r\nThe network of the shell in the Lithelida is commonly quite irregular, and\r\nso variable that its special conformation has usually no value in the\r\ndetermination of the species. The surface of the shell is often covered\r\nwith radial spines, which are sometimes arborescent.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule seems always to preserve the same lentelliptical form\r\n(or triaxial ellipsoid) as in all other #Larcoidea#. With the increase of\r\ngrowth it encloses successively a larger part of the spiral cortical shell,\r\nbut on the outside is constantly protected by the last turnings of the\r\nspiral, or by the lattice-lamella of the surface.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Lithelida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

It is most nearly allied to _Larcopyle_, and may, like this, be\r\nderived from _Amphipyle_ (or rather from _Larnacilla_, beginning to\r\ntransform into _Amphipyle_). But whilst in _Larcopyle_ one of the two wings\r\nof the lateral girdle overgrows the other in the direction of the\r\ntransverse axis (turning around the principal axis), here in _Spironium_\r\nboth lateral wings begin at the same time to grow out from the lateral\r\nsides of the _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell; the most remarkable thing\r\nis, however, that the direction of growth in the wings is diverse from the\r\nbeginning: the left wing grows downwards and turns around the lower\r\n(aboral) pole of the principal axis, the right wing grows upwards and turns\r\naround the upper (oral) pole of the same axis. Thus both wings of the\r\nlateral girdle are crossed in diagonal axes, and with increasing growth one\r\novergrows the other in the direction of these diagonals, so as to resemble\r\nthe figure 8 in shape. The open gates remaining between the turnings of the\r\ngirdle become afterwards closed on the surface by irregular lattice-work,\r\nand so the whole cortical shell assumes finally a spherical, ellipsoidal,\r\nor lentelliptical form. Its surface sometimes becomes covered with simple\r\nor branched radial spines. In the interior the eight characteristic\r\negg-shaped gates of _Octopyle_ are commonly (or constantly?) visible, two\r\nstrong radial beams in the principal axis arising from the poles of the\r\nlentelliptical medullary shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Spironetta_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Surface of the shell smooth or rough, but not with radial\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Spironium octonium_, n. sp.

(Pl. 49, figs. 8, 9).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with asymmetrical, spiral, polythalamous shell,\r\ncomposed of a variable number of roundish chambers, which form together an\r\nascending spiral; both halves of the shell unequal. Primordial chamber\r\neither simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe family #Streblonida# comprises those #Larcoidea# in which a number of\r\nchambers is arranged in an ascending spiral, round a simple or trizonal\r\nprimordial chamber, like winding stairs. They show the same spiral\r\nstructure as in the foregoing {703}family, but whilst in the Lithelida the\r\nspiral line lies in one plane (as in _Nautilus_), in the Streblonida it\r\nascends like a screw (as in _Helix_). Therefore the former have the same\r\nrelation, regarding the spiral structure, to the nautiloid Polythalamia as\r\nthe latter to the turbinoid Foraminifera. Indeed the single forms of\r\nStreblemida repeat in their special structure the characteristic genera of\r\nTurbinoida, such as _Globigerina_, _Rosalina_, _Pulvinulina_,\r\n_Hastigerina_, &c. As in these calcareous turbinoid Foraminifera, so also\r\nin the analogous siliceous Streblonida the distinction of species is very\r\ndifficult and open to many objections.\r\n\r\nThe number of species in this family is very small; all are rare and for\r\nthe most part very opaque and difficult to understand, so that the\r\nfollowing distinction of a dozen species can have only a provisional value.\r\nTo get a complete idea of their peculiar structure, the shell must be\r\nturned and observed from different sides, and thus their full study\r\nrequires yet much time and work. There are to be found evident transitional\r\nforms between them and the Lithelida on the one hand and the Soreumida on\r\nthe other. Besides this, most species of Streblonida seem to have more\r\ninclination to individual varieties and abnormalities than the majority of\r\nthe other Radiolaria.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the whole shell is in the Streblonida sometimes more\r\negg-shaped or even subspherical, at other times more top-like or conical,\r\nsometimes nearly discoidal. The height of the shell (or the vertical axis\r\nof the ascending spiral) is occasionally larger, at other times smaller\r\nthan the breadth (or the greatest horizontal diameter, perpendicular to the\r\nheight). Some very flat forms seem to approach the Lithelida. With regard\r\nto the internal screw-formation, the shell of all Streblonida is\r\nasymmetrical.\r\n\r\nThe number of the aggregated incomplete chambers is commonly between ten\r\nand twenty, but ascends sometimes to thirty, forty, or more. Sometimes the\r\nsize of all the chambers is nearly the same, sometimes they increase\r\ngradually, occasionally also very rapidly. The primordial chamber (or the\r\nfirst and oldest) seems to be commonly the smallest, and inversely, the\r\nlast and youngest chamber, the largest. But sometimes (in _Streblopyle_)\r\nalso the contrary may be the case. The form of the single chambers is very\r\nvariable, from the spherical or hemispherical through all transitions\r\nleading to irregular roundish or longish forms. The network is commonly\r\nirregular, with small roundish pores of different sizes, but sometimes also\r\nregular, circular. The surface of the shell is commonly smooth or rough,\r\nrarely covered with radial spines. In most species the reticulation and\r\nparticularly the  separation of the chambers is more or less incomplete.\r\n\r\nAs in the Lithelida, so also in the Streblonida we can distinguish two\r\nsubfamilies. In the Streblacanthida (_Streblonia_, _Streblacantha_) the\r\nprimordial chamber is a simple, spherical, subspherical, or lentelliptical\r\nlatticed shell. In the Streblopylida (_Streblopyle_) the primordial chamber\r\nis trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped, as in the greater number of\r\n#Larcoidea#, composed of three elliptical latticed girdles of unequal size,\r\nperpendicular one to another, and surrounding a simple central chamber. As\r\nin the Lithelida, so also {704}here we cannot certainly say whether the\r\nformer have originated from the latter by reduction of the\r\n_Larnacilla_-shell, or whether both groups be of different origin. The\r\nlatter is perhaps more probable. This family as well as the foregoing\r\nrequires a much more careful study than I could give to it.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Streblonida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The\r\nfirst or primordial chamber, however, in which the growth begins, is in\r\n_Streblonia_ a simple spherical shell, but in _Streblopyle_ a trizonal\r\nshell or _Larnacilla_-shell (compare above, p. 600).

The lattice-work of the latter\r\nis sometimes simple and complete, at other times incomplete, with open\r\ngates (as in the Pylonida), sometimes also spongy. Its form is always more\r\nor less irregular, roundish, often dimply or tuberous; different from most\r\nother #Larcoidea#.\r\n\r\nThe medullary shell is constantly a regular or subregular\r\n_Larnacilla_-shell, composed of three elliptical latticed girdles of\r\ndifferent sizes, perpendicular one to another. This leaves no doubt that\r\nthe Phorticida are true #Larcoidea#. The connection of it with the cortical\r\nshell is rarely effected by radial beams, commonly by two opposite latticed\r\nwings, which are identical with the lateral halves of the transverse girdle\r\nin the Pylonida diplozonaria (_Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_). Often also between\r\nthis transverse and a second (lateral) girdle there remain large open\r\ngates, so that the affinity between these Phorticida and the Pylonida\r\ncannot be doubted. In other cases these gates become closed, so that they\r\nmore nearly approach the Larnacida. From both families they differ by the\r\nirregularity of the papillate or tuberous cortical shell. The network is\r\nmore or less irregular, its surface often thorny, but never covered with\r\nsymmetrically disposed radial spines.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule is lentelliptical, encloses the medullary shell, and is\r\nenveloped by the cortical shell, as in the nearly allied Pylonida and\r\nLarnacida, of which the Phorticida may be regarded as irregular aberrant\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Phorticida._\r\n\r\n  Cortical shell simply latticed,  313. _Phorticium_.\r\n\r\n  Cortical shell spongy,           314. _Spongophortis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{709}Genus 313. _Phorticium_,[353] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Phorticida# with irregular cortical shell of simple\r\nlattice-work, enclosing a lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Phorticium_ comprises all Phorticida in which the irregular\r\ncortical shell is formed by simple lattice-work, not by spongy framework.\r\nWe can divide this genus into two subgenera: in _Phortopyle_ (as in the\r\n_Pylonida_) the lattice-work of the cortical shell exhibits large openings\r\nor gates; in _Phortolarcus_ these gates are perfectly closed by network;\r\nthe former may be regarded as abnormal or irregular Pylonida, the latter as\r\nmodifications of Larnacida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Phortopyle_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Lattice-work of the irregular cortical shell incomplete,\r\nwith large openings or gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Phorticium pylonium_, n. sp.

Primordial chamber either simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe family #Soreumida# contains a small number of #Larcoidea#, different\r\nfrom most other #Sphærellaria# in the complete irregularity of the\r\npolythalamous shell, which is composed of a variable number of roundish\r\nchambers or subspherical latticed shells, aggregated in the form of an\r\nirregular heap. We can distinguish in this family only two genera, with\r\nvery different structure of the central medullary shell or the first\r\nchamber beginning the growth; and these correspond to the two subfamilies\r\nof the nearly allied Streblonida (p. 704). In _Soreuma_ (as in\r\n_Streblonia_) the first or primordial chamber, from which the growth\r\nbegins, is like the others, a simple spherical or irregular roundish\r\nlattice-shell. In _Sorolarcus_, however (as in _Streblopyle_), the first or\r\nprimordial chamber is a trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shell. It is not\r\nimprobable that the former originated phylogenetically from _Streblonia_,\r\nthe latter from _Streblopyle_, by loss of the original spiral order of\r\ngrowth. But it is also possible that these groups have no nearer relation.\r\nAmong the calcareous Foraminifera a very similar form is represented by\r\n_Acervulina_ and its allies.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the whole shell in the Soreumida is sometimes more\r\negg-shaped or lentelliptical, at other times even subspherical,\r\noccasionally quite irregular, tuberous, or clustered. The number of the\r\naggregated chambers is very variable, in _Sorolarcus_ between ten and\r\nthirty, in _Soreuma_ ascending to fifty to eighty, sometimes from one\r\nhundred to one hundred and fifty and more. Their size is sometimes nearly\r\nequal, at other times very different, their form commonly very irregular,\r\nroundish, but sometimes also subspherical or egg-shaped. The network of the\r\nshell is also commonly irregular, with roundish pores of different sizes.\r\nThe surface is usually smooth or rough, rarely covered with radial spines.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule is not known, as I observed only a few skeletons of\r\nthis family.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Soreumida._\r\n\r\n  Primordial chamber of the shell simple, subspherical\r\n    or roundish,                                         315. _Soreuma_.\r\n\r\n  Primordial chamber of the shell trizonal or\r\n    _Larnacilla_-shaped,                                 316. _Sorolarcus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 315. _Soreuma_,[355] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Soreumida# with numerous chambers, aggregated without any\r\nregularity around one simple, spherical or subspherical, central chamber.\r\n\r\n{713}The genus _Soreuma_ contains those Soreumida in which no trace of any\r\nregular structure is found, but all the chambers of the irregular shell are\r\nwithout any order, aggregated around a simple spherical or subspherical\r\ncentral chamber or medullary shell. _Soreuma_ may have originated either\r\nfrom _Sorolarcus_ by loss of the central _Larnacilla_-shell or from\r\n_Cenolarcus_ by irregular apposition of new chambers around the\r\nlentelliptical central chamber or simple Larcoid-shell.

Extracapsulum without phæodium. Skeleton\r\ncentrogenous (its growth proceeding from the centre), acanthinic (organic,\r\nnot siliceous). Fundamental form originally spherical.\r\n\r\nThe legion ACANTHARIA vel ACTIPYLEA, to the extent here defined, was\r\nconstituted by me, 1878, in my Protistenreich (p. 102) under the name\r\n\"PANACANTHA.\" A more accurate definition of this group was given in 1879 by\r\nHertwig under the name ACANTHOMETREA. Both names were replaced by me, 1881,\r\nin my Prodromus (pp. 421, 465) by the more convenient name ACANTHARIA. This\r\nlegion comprises all those Radiolaria which were first described by\r\nJohannes Müller, 1858, as _Acanthometrae_, and also an important part of\r\nhis _Haliomma_. In my Monograph (1862, pp. 371-424) I disposed them in\r\nthree families, Acanthometrida, Diploconida, and Dorataspida.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of genera and species in this legion is much increased\r\nby the rich collection of the Challenger, we can divide all ACANTHARIA into\r\ntwo different orders: #Acanthometra# (without complete lattice-shell) and\r\n#Acanthophracta# (provided with a complete lattice-shell).\r\n\r\nThe ACANTHARIA agree with the SPUMELLARIA in the structure of the simple\r\ncapsule-membrane, which is perforated by numerous small pores (but\r\nconstantly devoid of the large main opening, which the NASSELLARIA and\r\nPHÆODARIA possess, being hence united as \"Merotrypasta\"). We can therefore\r\nunite both former legions as \"Holotrypasta\" (compare above, pp. 5, 6); but\r\nin many ACANTHARIA (if not in all?) the numerous small pores of the\r\ncapsule-membrane exhibit a certain peculiar arrangement not observed in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA; therefore the latter can be regarded as true \"Peripylea\" in\r\nopposition to the former as \"Actipylea.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar main character of all ACTIPYLEA or ACANTHARIA is determined by\r\nthe chemical constitution of their skeleton, which is not silex, but a\r\npeculiar organic substance, called by me in 1862 \"acanthin\" (Monogr. d.\r\nRadiol., pp. 30, 32). In all other Radiolaria the skeleton is composed of\r\nsilex or of a silicate. But besides this {717}chemical difference, an\r\nimportant morphological character of the skeleton also separates the\r\nACANTHARIA from all other Radiolaria: in the latter the skeleton is never\r\ncentrogenous or arising from the centre of the capsule; in strict\r\nopposition to this general fact the skeleton of all ACANTHARIA is\r\ncentrogenous, composed of radial spines, which arise from the central point\r\nof the capsule and pierce its membrane. These characteristic \"radial spines\r\nof acanthin,\" arising from the centre, are never hollow (as formerly was\r\nsupposed), but constantly solid. Their form is extremely variable, and most\r\nimportant for the distinction of genera and species; but more interesting\r\nfrom a general point of view is their peculiar arrangement or disposition.\r\n\r\nThe regular disposition of twenty radial spines has general value almost\r\nfor all ACANTHARIA, with the exception only of the small group of\r\n#Actinelida#. In this latter group the number of radial spines is either\r\nmore or less than twenty, and their disposition is either quite irregular\r\nor follows a peculiar rule. The number of individuals of these\r\n#Actinelida#, compared with that of the other ACANTHARIA, may be scarcely 1\r\nper cent., whilst the latter have more than 99 per cent.; the number of\r\nobserved species is in the former about 5 per cent., in the latter about 95\r\nper cent. Nevertheless the small group of #Actinelida# is very important,\r\nbeing probably the ancestral group from which all other ACANTHARIA have\r\nbeen phylogenetically derived. These other ACANTHARIA, with twenty\r\nregularly disposed radial spines, represent the two large groups of\r\n#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#. For short and clear distinction of\r\nthese two groups of ACANTHARIA, we will call the #Actinelida# (with\r\nirregular number and disposition of radial spines) Adelacantha, in\r\nopposition to the Icosacantha (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), which\r\nall possess twenty regularly disposed radial spines.\r\n\r\nJohannes Müller, the great zoologist, to whom we are indebted for the first\r\ndetection and accurate knowledge of the #Acanthometra#, already recognised\r\nthe regularity in the peculiar disposition of their twenty radial spines\r\n(Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 12, 37). In honour of my\r\ngreat master I have called this regular disposition the \"Müllerian law of\r\nspine disposition,\" and have given a full explanation of it in my Monograph\r\n(1862, pp. 40-45, 371, 372). With regard to its general value for all\r\nIcosacantha (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), we might also call this\r\npromorphological Müllerian law \"the Icosacanthan law.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1862 I had already given the following precise definition of this\r\n\"Icosacanthan law\" (_loc. cit._, p. 40):--\"Between two poles of a spineless\r\naxis are regularly disposed five parallel zones, each with four radial\r\nspines; the four spines of each zone are equidistant one from another, and\r\nalso equidistant from each pole; and the four spines of each zone are so\r\nalternating with those of each neighbouring zone, that all twenty spines\r\ntogether lie in four meridian planes, which intersect one another at an\r\nangle of 45°.\"  For the clear conception of this remarkable Müllerian law,\r\nand for the complete understanding of its high value for the complicated\r\n{718}morphology of all Icosacantha, it is the most profitable way to retain\r\nconstantly in mind for comparison the figure of a terrestrial globe with\r\nits axis and zones. The axis of the globe is the spineless axis of all\r\nIcosacantha, around which all twenty spines are symmetrically disposed; it\r\nis perpendicular to the bisecting equatorial plane, in which lies the\r\nmiddle of the five parallel zones; therefore the four spines, crossed\r\nperpendicularly in this equatorial plane, are called the equatorial spines\r\n(_c_1 to _c_4 in the figures of Pls. 131-140); often, and mainly in the\r\nfamily Quadrilonchida (Pl. 131), these four equatorial spines are much\r\nlarger or of a peculiar form, different from that of the sixteen other\r\nspines. Each pair of the four equatorial spines lies in one equatorial\r\naxis, and this latter is perpendicular to the crossing axis, in which lies\r\nthe other pair of opposite spines. We may regard these two equatorial\r\ndiameters, perpendicular one to another and to the spineless axis, as the\r\ntwo perradial axes or primary axes. Correspondingly the two meridian\r\nplanes, which are determined by one perradial axis and the spineless axis,\r\nmay be called the two primary or perradial meridian planes.\r\n\r\nThe globe is divided by the equatorial plane into two equal halves, the\r\nnorthern and the southern hemisphere. In each hemisphere there are disposed\r\nquite symmetrically eight radial spines, the distal ends of which fall in\r\ntwo parallel circles, a larger tropical circle (nearer to the equator) and\r\na smaller polar circle (nearer to the pole of the spineless axis).\r\nTherefore we call the four spines of the former the \"tropical spines\" and\r\nthe four spines of the latter the \"polar spines.\" The angle between the\r\nformer and the equatorial plane is about 30°, the angle between the latter\r\nand that plane about 60°.\r\n\r\nThe eight polar spines (four northern and four southern) lie in the same\r\ntwo meridian planes as the four equatorial spines. Therefore in each of\r\nthese two perradial planes lie six radial spines, opposite in pairs; two\r\nequatorial and four polar spines. Commonly all eight polar spines are of\r\nthe same size and form; and often they are also equal to the eight tropical\r\nspines; but in some cases (e.g., in some species of Quadrilonchida) they\r\nare much smaller than the twelve other spines, and sometimes even\r\nrudimentary. In all figures of the Pls. 131-140 (and also in my Monograph,\r\n1862, Taf. xv.-xxii.) the polar spines of the northern circle are marked by\r\nthe characters _a_1 to _a_4, the polar spines of the southern circle by the\r\ncharacters _e_1 to _e_4. In the first perradial meridian plane lie _a_1 and\r\n_a_3, _e_1 and _e_3, in the second _a_2 and _a_4, _e_2 and _e_4.\r\n\r\nThe eight tropical spines lie between the eight polar and the four\r\nequatorial spines, four in each hemisphere; their distal points fall in two\r\nparallel circles, which correspond exactly to the two tropics of the globe.\r\nTherefore the four northern tropical spines may be called \"canceral spines\"\r\n(as their ends fall in the Tropic of Cancer) and the four southern\r\ncorrespondingly \"capricornal spines\" (as their points lie {719}in the\r\nTropic of the Capricorn). In the figures of the Pls. 131-140 (as well as in\r\nmy Monograph, 1862, Taf. xv.-xxii.) the four northern or canceral spines\r\nare marked by the characters _b_1 to _b_4, and the four southern or\r\ncapricornal spines by the characters _d_1 to _d_4. Also the eight tropical\r\nspines lie (crossed in pairs) in two meridian planes; they do not lie,\r\nhowever, in those perradial planes, in which are placed the twelve other\r\nspines; but in two different meridian planes, crossing the former at angles\r\nof 45°; we call these the \"secondary\" or \"interradial\" meridian planes.\r\nEach of these planes is determined by the spineless axis and by two crossed\r\ninterradial or secondary axes; in each of the latter lie two opposite\r\ntropical spines. In the first interradial meridian plane lie _b_1 and _b_3,\r\n_d_1 and _d_3, in the second _b_2 and _b_4, _d_2 and _d_4.\r\n\r\nIt is a most interesting and important fact, that in all Icosacantha\r\n(#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#) this regular disposition of the twenty\r\nspines (in five parallel zones and four meridian planes) becomes constantly\r\npreserved by heredity, whilst the form and size of the different spines are\r\nextremely varied by adaptation.\r\n\r\nOnly  in a minority of the Icosacantha are all twenty spines perfectly\r\nequal or nearly equal in size and form; and then it is often very difficult\r\nto distinguish the different zones in their disposition. But in far the\r\ngreater part the size or the form of the twenty spines becomes different in\r\ndifferent zones; and then we can commonly distinguish easily the five\r\ndifferent zones. Firstly, in all Quadrilonchida and Dorataspida, the four\r\nequatorial are distinguished from the sixteen other spines either by form\r\nor by size, and often in a very remarkable degree. As soon as these four\r\nprincipal spines are recognised, it is easy to determine also the sixteen\r\nothers; for the eight polar spines lie in the same two (perradial) meridian\r\nplanes as the former, whilst the eight tropical spines lie in two different\r\n(interradial) meridian planes, intersecting the two former at angles of\r\n45°. Commonly, therefore, this distinction is rather easy.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the Icosacantha all four equatorial spines are exactly\r\nof the same form and size. But in four families the two opposite spines of\r\none equatorial axis are much larger, or of another form, than those of the\r\ncrossing axis. This is the case in the Amphilonchida, Belonaspida,\r\nHexalaspida, and Diploconida. Therefore we here call the major equatorial\r\naxis (with larger spines) the \"hydrotomical axis,\" and the minor axis (with\r\nsmaller spines) the \"geotomical axis.\" Correspondingly, the meridian plane,\r\n in which the two larger equatorial spines are placed (_c_1, _c_3) and the\r\nappertaining four polar spines (_a_1, _a_3, _e_1, _e_3) may be called the\r\n\"hydrotomical plane\"; in the remarkable family of Hexalaspida (Pl. 139) all\r\nsix spines of this hydrotomical plane are much larger than the other\r\nfourteen. Perpendicular to this plane is the second perradial meridian\r\nplane, which we call the \"geotomical plane\"; in it lie the two smaller\r\nequatorial spines (c2, c4) and the corresponding four polar spines (_a_2,\r\n_a_4, _e_2, _e_4). In some Hexalaspida (_Hexonaspis_ and _Hexacolpus_) the\r\nsix spines of the hydrotomical plane become so preponderant that {720}the\r\nother fourteen spines appear rudimentary; and in some of them the two\r\nequatorial spines of the hydrotomical plane are much larger than the four\r\npolar spines of the same plane. This curious relation reaches its maximum\r\nin the Diploconida (Pl. 140).\r\n\r\nThe different development of the two equatorial axes (of the larger\r\nhydrotomical and the smaller geotomical axis) is the first and most\r\nimportant cause of the peculiar forms, which are produced in the four cited\r\nfamilies. We derive these terms also from the metaphor of the terrestrial\r\nglobe. The hydrotomical plane is that meridian plane of the globe which\r\nintersects almost only the water-hemisphere (the island of Ferro in the\r\nAtlantic, the island of Pandora in the Pacific). Perpendicular to this is\r\nthe geotomical plane, the meridian of which intersects great land-masses in\r\nboth hemispheres (Bombay in India, Athabasca in Canada). Both poles of the\r\nsmaller geotomical axis are everywhere equal (the East Indian and the\r\nWestern American). However, both poles of the larger hydrotomical axis (the\r\neastern Atlantic and the western Pacific) are in some genera very\r\ndifferent, _e.g._, in _Amphibelone_ among the Amphilonchida, and in\r\n_Zygostaurus_ among the Quadrilonchida. In this case we call the anterior\r\n(commonly more developed) pole of the hydrotomical axis the frontal pole,\r\nthe opposite posterior (commonly smaller) the caudal pole (Pl. 131, figs.\r\n7, 8; Pl. 132, figs. 9, 10). On both sides of these (right and left) lie\r\nsymmetrically the two equal poles of the geotomical lateral axis.\r\n\r\nThe promorphology of the ACANTHARIA demonstrates that the geometrical\r\nfundamental form in those groups is different. In the majority of the\r\nACANTHARIA, where the two equatorial axes are equal, that form is a double\r\nsquare-pyramid or a \"quadrate octahedron\"; the four equal equatorial spines\r\nindicate the two diagonals of the square, which is the common base of the\r\nunited regular four-sided pyramids; their common axis is the spineless axis\r\nof the body; the ends of the polar spines fall on the edges of the\r\npyramids, while the ends of the tropical spines fall on the halving lines\r\nof their faces. However, in those ACANTHARIA in which the two equatorial\r\naxes become different, the square double pyramid becomes changed into a\r\nrhombic double pyramid; the common base of the united pyramids is thus a\r\nrhombus; the hydrotomical axis is the larger, the geotomical axis the\r\nsmaller diagonal of the rhombus.\r\n\r\nOpposed to the Icosacantha, under the name \"Adelacantha,\" is the small\r\ngroup of Actinelida, in which the number and disposition of the radial\r\nspines is variable, not determined by the Müllerian law. Probably this\r\ngroup is the common ancestral stock, from which the Icosacantha have been\r\nderived by gradual development of their peculiar disposition. Probably the\r\noldest and most primitive form of all ACANTHARIA is _Actinelius_, in which\r\na variable and undetermined (often very large) number of radial spines is\r\nunited in one common central point, and therefore forms a needle-sphere.\r\nWhilst here all spines (often more than a hundred) are of equal size and\r\nform, in the nearly allied _Astrolophus_ large and small spines are\r\nintermingled. Both genera together form the small ancestral family of\r\nAstrolophida. In the strange family of Litholophida the radial spines do\r\nnot {721}radiate within a spherical space (equally disposed in all\r\ndirections), but within a quadrant or even an octant, forming a conical\r\nbrush or pencil.\r\n\r\nOne very remarkable form of #Actinelida# is _Actinastrum_, forming the\r\ntransition from these Adelacantha to the common regular Icosacantha. In the\r\ntwo observed species of _Actinastrum_ we find thirty-two radial spines,\r\ntwenty of which are disposed after the Müllerian law, as in the\r\nIcosacantha. The other twelve are four interradial equatorial spines (lying\r\nin the two secondary meridian planes) and eight perradial tropical spines\r\n(lying in the two primary meridian planes). Therefore here in each primary\r\nmeridian plane are placed ten spines (two equatorial, four tropical, and\r\nfour polar spines), whereas in each secondary meridian plane are placed six\r\nspines (two equatorial and four tropical). But here also all thirty-two\r\nspines are so regularly placed that their free distal ends fall into five\r\nparallel zones, four in each polar zone, eight in each tropical zone, and\r\neight in the equatorial zone.\r\n\r\n_The Central Junction_ of the radial spines in the ACANTHARIA becomes\r\neffected in four different ways:--(1) by simple apposition of the pyramidal\r\ncentral ends or bases; (2) by a basal leaf-cross, or by broad wings, four\r\non each spine, supported one upon the other; (3) by a central concrescence\r\nof the meeting bases of all the twenty spines, growing perfectly together;\r\nand (4) by a concrescence in pairs of every two opposite spines. The most\r\ncommon and probably the original mode of junction is the first--by\r\npyramidal apposition; the spines at the central base are pointed in the\r\nform of a pyramid, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids\r\nare simply placed upon one another. Often the small basal pyramids are\r\nimperfectly separated from the spines by an annular constriction. Commonly\r\nthe basal pyramids of the four equatorial spines are six-sided, those of\r\nthe sixteen other spines five-sided.\r\n\r\nThe second mode of junction, by a basal leaf-cross, is developed from the\r\nfirst and appears as a strengthening or a mechanical elaboration of it.\r\nImmediately above the basal pyramid arise from its radial edges four thin\r\nand broad triangular leaves or wings, and the meeting edges of the\r\nneighbouring wings are in apposition one with the other, so that between\r\nthe bases of every three or four neighbouring spines a hollow pyramidal\r\nspace remains open. The apex of such a pyramidal space is directed towards\r\nthe centre of the body, but separated from it by the small basal pyramid;\r\nits open base is directed outwards. The twenty-two hollow pyramidal spaces\r\nare disposed regularly in four different groups:--(A) Four equatorial\r\nspaces, four-sided, each limited by two equatorial and two tropical spines\r\n(one canceral and one capricornal); (B) eight perizonal spaces (four\r\nnorthern and four southern), four-sided, each limited by one equatorial,\r\ntwo tropical, and one polar spine; (C) eight peripolar spaces (four\r\nnorthern and four southern), three-sided, each limited by one tropical and\r\ntwo polar spines; (D) two polar spaces (one northern and one southern),\r\nfour-sided, each limited by four neighbouring polar spines.\r\n\r\n{722}The third mode of junction, by central concrescence of all twenty\r\nspines, was formerly regarded by me as an important peculiarity, sufficient\r\nfor the separation of subfamilies and genera (Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, pp.\r\n399, 401; Prodromus, 1881, p. 466). But I found afterwards that in many\r\nspecies where the twenty spines commonly remain separated, accidentally\r\nthey grow perfectly together and form one single piece of acanthin--a\r\nstarrulet with twenty rays. Therefore I now think it is more natural to\r\ndivide those species only into different subgenera.\r\n\r\nA fourth and a very different mode of junction, quite sufficient for the\r\ndistinction of different families, is the concrescence in pairs of every\r\ntwo opposite spines, lying in one diameter (in _Acanthochiasma_ and\r\n_Chiastolus_). Here we obtain a number of \"diametral spines\" (each composed\r\nof two originally opposed radial spines) and all these diametral spines are\r\ncrossed loosely near the central point of the body without any solid and\r\npermanent apposition (Chiastolida). However, in some species of this\r\npeculiar family the central part of the diametral spines is twisted like a\r\nscrew or spirally convoluted (Pl. 129, figs. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n_The Form of the Radial Spines_ in the ACANTHARIA is extremely varied, and\r\nconstitutes the main characters for the distinction of nearly four hundred\r\nspecies. But all these different forms may be reduced phylogenetically to\r\nthree different fundamental forms:--(_a_) the cylindrical (with circular\r\ntransverse section), (_b_) the two-edged (with elliptical or lanceolate\r\ntransverse section), and (_c_) the four-edged (with square transverse\r\nsection). No doubt the first (_a_) is the original primitive form, from\r\nwhich the two others are secondarily derived. Triangular spines never occur\r\nin the ACANTHARIA, whilst, however, they are common in the #Sphærellaria#.\r\nThe first and original form, the cylindrical spine, is either a true\r\ncylinder of equal thickness in its whole length, or it is more or less\r\nconical. Rarely the spine is in the distal half spindle-shaped, and thicker\r\nthan in the basal half. The second form, the two-edged spine, is more or\r\nless compressed from two opposite sides; its two edges are either more\r\nblunt, rounded, or more acute, sharp; its transverse section in the former\r\ncase is elliptical, in the latter case lanceolate or rhomboidal. Sometimes\r\nthe two edges are broader and in the form of two thin opposite wings. The\r\ntwo-edged spines may be occasionally shorter, triangular or lanceolate, at\r\nother times longer sword-shaped or linear. The third form, the four-edged\r\nspine, has constantly a square transverse section; the sides of this square\r\nare either even or concave; in the latter case the four edges are broadened\r\nand wing-like, but in the former case not. The quadrangular spines are\r\neither prismatic (of equal breadth throughout their whole length) or\r\npyramidal (becoming gradually thinner towards the distal apex).\r\n\r\n_The Apex of the Radial Spines_, or their free distal end, is in the\r\nmajority of ACANTHARIA simple, conical. In the minority it is either\r\ntruncated or bifid, or four-sided pyramidal, often with two, rarely with\r\nfour prominent parallel teeth. In some forms {723}the bifid spines are so\r\ndeeply cleft that they become forked. Much more interesting and more varied\r\nthan these different forms of the distal end are those of the apophyses of\r\nthe radial spines.\r\n\r\n_The Apophyses of the Radial Spines_, or their \"lateral transverse\r\nprocesses,\" are of the greatest importance for the morphological\r\ndevelopment of the whole subclass. Only in sixteen among the sixty-five\r\ngenera of ACANTHARIA are the apophyses perfectly wanting; in the other\r\ngenera they determine in the first place their general character. In the\r\n#Acanthometra# the apophyses remain perfectly free, whilst in the\r\n#Acanthophracta# their meeting ends or branches compose the latticed shell.\r\nAll differences in form and shape of the apophyses can be reduced to only\r\ntwo primary modes; either the spine bears two opposite or four crossed\r\napophyses; correspondingly all Acantharia apophysaria may be divided into\r\ntwo different main groups, the Zygapophysica (with two opposite lateral\r\nprocesses) and the Staurapophysica (with four crossed lateral processes\r\nopposite in pairs). Both groups have probably no direct phylogenetic\r\nconnection, but seem to be derived independently from different stocks, and\r\nproduce different families. The Zygapophysica are probably derived from\r\nAstrolonchida with two-edged spines (_Zygacantha_), and from this group\r\narise the Diporaspida, the ancestral group of the majority of\r\n#Acanthophracta#. On the other hand the Staurapophysica are probably\r\nderived from Astrolonchida with four-edged spines (_Acanthonia_), and from\r\nthis group arise the Tessaraspida. The apophyses of the #Acanthonida# are\r\npartly simple, partly branched or even latticed; the apophyses of the\r\n#Acanthophracta# are never simple, constantly branched and commonly\r\nlatticed.\r\n\r\n_The Malacoma_ (or the whole soft body of the ACANTHARIA as opposed to the\r\nskeleton) exhibits some peculiarities which distinguish them from the other\r\nRadiolaria, as well in the structure of the central capsule and its nucleus\r\nas in that of the enveloping extracapsular body and the pseudopodia.\r\n\r\nThe _Central Capsule_ is constantly spherical in the far greater number of\r\nthe ACANTHARIA, viz., in the following six families:--Astrolophida,\r\nChiastolida, Astrolonchida, Dorataspida, Sphærocapsida, and Phractopeltida.\r\nAmong these six families the Astrolonchida and Dorataspida are far greater\r\nand far richer in different forms than all the other families. The central\r\ncapsule becomes ellipsoidal or cylindrical, prolonged in one axis, in the\r\nthree families, Amphilonchida, Belonapsida, and Diploconida; it becomes\r\ndiscoidal or lenticular, by the shortening of one axis, in two families,\r\nviz., in the Quadrilonchida and Hexalaspida. Finally, the peculiar family\r\nLitholophida is distinguished by the conical form of its central capsule.\r\n\r\n_The Membrane_ of the central capsule in all ACANTHARIA is simple, commonly\r\nthin, sometimes very delicate; in some species it seems to be developed\r\nlate, just immediately before the formation of the spores; but in no\r\nspecies is it completely missing. The membrane is constantly pierced by\r\ninnumerable fine pores, for the emission of the {724}pseudopodia; but in\r\nmany species (and probably more or less in all ACANTHARIA) there is\r\nrecognisable a certain regularity in the disposition of the numerous\r\npseudopodia and of the pores by which they radiate from the capsule.\r\nSometimes these pores are disposed in a regular network of ramified lines,\r\nwhilst the meshes of this network are devoid of pores; in other cases they\r\nform regular tufts or bushes between the radial spines. Probably in no\r\nACANTHARIA are the pores of the capsule membrane so numerous and so equally\r\ndistributed throughout as in the SPUMELLARIA; we may therefore call the\r\nformer ACTIPYLEA (in opposition to the latter, as PERIPYLEA).\r\n\r\n_The Nucleus_ of the ACANTHARIA is constantly excentric, whilst it is\r\noriginally constantly central in the SPUMELLARIA. This excentric position\r\nis a necessary consequence of the centrogenous development of the radial\r\nspines. Probably connected with this peculiarity is the other, that the\r\nnucleus assumes a peculiar, complicated structure, and that in the greater\r\nnumber of ACANTHARIA it becomes cleft very early, and that this cleavage is\r\neffected by a peculiar kind of gemmation, first detected and very\r\naccurately described by R. Hertwig (compare his Organismus d. Radiol.,\r\n1879, pp. 10-24). However, in the young ACANTHARIA the nucleus is\r\nconstantly simple, and in a certain number of species its cleavage takes\r\nplace late (as in the greater number of SPUMELLARIA).\r\n\r\n_The Endoplasm_, or the intracapsular sarcode, exhibits in the greater\r\nnumber of ACANTHARIA a more or less distinct radial arrangement; but this\r\nis often concealed by the different enclosed products of the\r\nendoplasm--oil-globules, vacuoles, red or different coloured\r\npigment-granules, crystals, &c. Often it encloses a variable number of\r\n\"yellow cells\" (becoming green by mineral acids) to be considered as\r\nsymbiotic xanthellæ.\r\n\r\n_The Calymma_ or the jelly-veil, including the central capsule, in the\r\nACANTHARIA is more or less voluminous, and commonly envelops the skeleton\r\nperfectly. In its surface is sometimes developed a peculiar network of\r\n\"supporting fibres.\" A very peculiar product are the remarkable\r\n\"Myophrisca\" of the #Acanthometra#, which are wanting in the\r\n#Acanthophracta#; they were first detected by Johannes Müller, and figured\r\nas \"Cilien-Kränze,\" afterwards explained by Hertwig as \"contractile Fäden,\"\r\nsimilar to muscular fibrillæ (compare below).\r\n\r\n_The Matrix_, placed between the calymma and central capsule, in the\r\nmajority of the ACANTHARIA is a rather thin layer of granular exoplasm.\r\n\r\n_The Pseudopodia_ arising from it are not so numerous as in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and not so equally disposed over the whole surface. Also their\r\ntendency to ramify, anastomose, and form networks seems to be much less\r\ndeveloped. Commonly they are simple or little ramified. In many cases (and\r\nperhaps everywhere) there may be distinguished two different kinds of\r\npseudopodia:--(1) Axopodia, or permanent pseudopodia (with axial\r\nfilaments?), piercing the wall of the central capsule, and arising from the\r\ncentral mass of endoplasm; and (2) Collopodia, or variable pseudopodia\r\n(without axial filaments), arising outside the capsule from the matrix of\r\nextracapsular sarcode or from the {725}exoplasm on the surface of the\r\ncalymma. These and other differentiations seem to indicate that the\r\npseudopodia in the ACANTHARIA are more highly developed than in the\r\nSPUMELLARIA, and justify the denomination of the former as \"Actipylea.\"\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Orders and Suborders of_ ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

By the absence of such a latticed or fenestrated\r\nshell the #Acanthometra# differ principally from the nearly allied\r\n#Acanthophracta#, the second order of ACANTHARIA, which constantly possess\r\nsuch a complete shell.\r\n\r\nJohannes Müller, who first detected and described the #Acanthometra# (in\r\n1855, _loc. cit._), defined them as follows:--\"Radiolaria without shell,\r\nwith siliceous radial spines\" (1858, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin,\r\np. 46). He described and figured eighteen species of them, disposed in four\r\ngenera (_Acanthometra_ with fifteen species, and _Zygacantha_,\r\n_Lithophyllium_, _Lithoptera_, each with a single species). Among those\r\neighteen species, however, were two \"Acanthometræ cataphractæ,\"\r\nappertaining to the following order, the #Acanthophracta#.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, p. 371) all true #Acanthometra# were united into a\r\nsingle family, Acanthometrida, with the following definition:--\"Skeleton\r\ncomposed of a number of radial spines, piercing the central capsule and\r\nunited in its centre, without {726}latticed shell.\" In the majority of them\r\nI observed that the skeleton did not consist of silex, but of a very\r\npeculiar organic substance, which I called \"acanthin.\" At that time I\r\ndivided the family Acanthometrida into four subfamilies:--(1)\r\nAcanthostaurida, (2) Astrolithida, (3) Litholophida, (4) Acanthochiasmida.\r\nThe two former now represent the suborder #Acanthonida#, the two latter the\r\nsuborder #Actinelida#. The number of genera which I distinguished in my\r\nMonograph amounted to nine, the number of species to fifty. By the rich\r\ncollections of the Challenger this number is so much increased that we can\r\nhere describe twenty-seven genera and one hundred and sixty species.\r\n\r\nRichard Hertwig in his work on the Organismus der Radiolarien (1879, pp.\r\n6-25) adopted my family Acanthometrida, and gave a very accurate\r\ndescription of its anatomical structure. He confirmed my observations that\r\nthe radial spines of this family are never hollow, but solid, and that\r\ntheir chemical substance is not silex, but the organic matter \"acanthin.\"\r\nHe found that the simple nucleus of the Acanthometrida is commonly very\r\nearly cleft, and that the peculiar brushes of filaments on the calymma,\r\ndescribed by Johannes Müller and by me as \"Gallert-cilien,\" are peculiar\r\n\"contractile filaments,\" comparable to the \"muscle-fibrillæ\" of some\r\nInfusoria, or the \"Myophan-filaments\" (Myophrisca).\r\n\r\nThe order #Acanthometra# is here divided into two different suborders of\r\nvery unequal extent and value, the #Actinelida# and #Acanthonida#. The\r\nfirst may be regarded as the common ancestral stock, not only of the\r\nsecond, but of all ACANTHARIA. In the small group of #Actinelida# the\r\nnumber of radial spines is variable and commonly indefinite, often very\r\nlarge (more than a hundred); they are therefore Adelacantha. The second\r\nsuborder, the #Acanthonida#, comprise by far the greatest part of the\r\norder, and possess constantly twenty radial spines, regularly disposed\r\nafter the Müllerian law; they are therefore (like all #Acanthophracta#)\r\nIcosacantha (compare above, p. 717).\r\n\r\nThe #Actinelida# possess constantly simple radial spines, without any\r\napophyses; their form is commonly very simple and primitive. This suborder\r\ncomprises three small but very different families, the Astrolophida,\r\nLitholophida, and Chiastolida. The first family, the Astrolophida, is the\r\noriginal ancestral group. A large and variable, commonly indefinite number\r\nof radial spines is here united in the centre of the spherical central\r\ncapsule and radiating within a spherical space. In the second family, the\r\nLitholophida, a small and variable number of radial spines (between ten and\r\ntwenty) is united in the apex of a conical central capsule and radiating\r\nwithin the quadrant or octant of a spherical space. In the third family,\r\nthe Chiastolida, a variable number of radial spines is grown together by\r\npairs, in such a manner that every two opposite spines (placed originally\r\nin one axis of the spherical central capsule) forms a single \"diametral\r\nspine\"; all these diametral spines are not united in the centre of the\r\ncentral capsule but only crossed loosely near the centre.\r\n\r\n{727}The #Acanthonida#, the second suborder of #Acanthometra#, embraces by\r\nfar the greatest number in this order, viz., all those forms in which\r\ntwenty radial spines are regularly disposed after the Müllerian\r\nlaw--Icosacantha (compare above, p. 717). The radial spines of this\r\nsuborder are either simple or provided with transverse processes (either\r\ntwo opposite or four crossed apophyses). They are commonly united in the\r\nmiddle of the central capsule by their opposed basal ends, forming small\r\npyramids; the meeting triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids being\r\npropped one upon another. Above these small basal pyramids often arises a\r\nbasal leaf-cross formed by four broad triangular leaves or wings with\r\nstraight edges; the meeting thin edges of the neighbouring spines serve for\r\nstrengthening the basal junction and form hollow pyramidal spaces or\r\ncompartments, filled with the contents of the central capsule (compare p.\r\n721). The suborder #Acanthonida# comprises three different families, the\r\nAstrolonchida, Quadrilonchida, and Amphilonchida. The first family, the\r\nAstrolonchida, comprises by far the greater number of the #Acanthonida#;\r\nthose genera in which all twenty spines are perfectly equal or nearly equal\r\nin size and form. In the second family, the Quadrilonchida, the four\r\nequatorial spines are much larger (and often also of another form) than the\r\nsixteen other spines (often also the eight tropical larger than the eight\r\npolar spines). The third family, the Amphilonchida, is distinguished by the\r\npreponderating development of only two opposite equatorial spines, which\r\nare much larger (and often also of another form) than the eighteen other\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Suborders and Families of_ #Acanthometra#.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Suborder I.

ACTINELIDA, Haeckel, 1882.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with a variable number of radial spines,\r\nwhich are commonly irregularly disposed, not according to the Icosacantha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily XXXIII. #ASTROLOPHIDA#, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Astrolophida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Acantharia# with a variable number of simple radial spines,\r\nradiating within a spherical space from one common central point which is\r\nthe centre of the spherical central capsule. No lattice shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Astrolophida# comprises the simplest and the most primitive\r\nforms among all ACANTHARIA, and may therefore be regarded as the common\r\nancestral stock of this whole legion or subclass of Radiolaria. The\r\nacanthinic skeleton is composed of a variable number of quite simple radial\r\nspines, which are united in the centre of the spherical central capsule and\r\nradiate, piercing its walls and the surrounding jelly-veil, within a\r\nspherical space.\r\n\r\nThe first observed form of this family is the ancestral genus _Actinelius_,\r\ntwo different species of which I detected in 1864 in the northern\r\nMediterranean, at Villafranca, near Nice (compare Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool.,\r\n1865, Bd. xv. p. 364, Taf. xxvi. fig. 4). Three other species of the same\r\ngenus were afterwards found by me in the Challenger collections. Whilst in\r\nthis _Actinelius_ all radial spines are of the same size, a new nearly\r\nallied genus, _Astrolophus_ (with two species), differs from it by the\r\ndifferent size of the radial spines, a small number of very large spines\r\nbeing intermingled with a very large number of small spines. In these two\r\ngenera, _Actinelius_ and _Astrolophus_ (the true \"Astrolophida\" _sensu\r\nstrictiori_), the number of the radial spines is quite indeterminable and\r\ntheir arrangement quite irregular and variable.\r\n\r\nA third remarkable genus, _Actinastrum_, differs from these two genera in\r\nthe definite number and regular order  of thirty-two radial spines, and may\r\ntherefore perhaps better represent a peculiar family, Actinastrida. In this\r\ngenus (of which two species were observed) the thirty-two radial spines are\r\ndisposed in such a regular manner that they lie in four meridian planes,\r\nand that their distal ends fall into five parallel zones. These five zones\r\nand these four planes are the same as we find in all Icosacantha (compare\r\nabove, p. 717). Also the constant twenty spines of these latter are present\r\nin _Actinastrum_; but their number is here enlarged by twelve other spines\r\nmissing in the Icosacantha; four of these are secondary or interradial\r\nequatorial spines, lying opposite in pairs between the four primary or\r\nperradial equatorial spines; and eight are perradial tropical spines, lying\r\nbetween the eight interradial tropical spines. Therefore the {729}distal\r\nends of the thirty-two radial spines are disposed regularly in five\r\nparallel zones, and while two zones (the two polar) contain only the points\r\nof every four spines, three zones (the single equatorial and the two\r\ntropical) contain the points of every eight spines. The four meridian\r\nplanes are in _Actinastrum_ the same as in the Icosacantha, crossed in the\r\nspineless axis at angles of 45°. But in the Icosacantha each of the two\r\nperradial meridian planes contains six radial spines (two equatorial and\r\nfour polar), each of the two interradial meridian planes only four tropical\r\nspines. Whereas in _Actinastrum_ each of the two primary or perradial\r\nmeridian planes contains ten spines (two equatorial, four tropical, and\r\nfour polar), each of the two secondary or interradial meridian planes six\r\nspines (two equatorial and four tropical). We find therefore altogether\r\nthirty-two radial spines in three orders; eight equatorial, sixteen\r\ntropical, and eight polar spines.\r\n\r\nOnly one other genus of Radiolaria exhibits the same characteristic\r\ndisposition of thirty-two radial spines as _Actinastrum_, and this is\r\n_Chiastolus_; but here the two opposite spines of each pair are grown\r\ntogether and form one diametral spine; and the sixteen diametral spines are\r\ncrossed in the centre of the capsule. In _Actinastrum_, as in _Astrolophus_\r\nand _Actinelius_, the central ends or bases of all the spines are\r\npyramidal, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring spines rest one\r\nupon another (as in the greater number of #Acanthonida#). The form of the\r\nradial spines in all Astrolophida is quite simple, without lateral\r\nprocesses or apophyses; chiefly cylindrical, more rarely compressed,\r\ntwo-edged or quadrangular.\r\n\r\nThe central capsule in all Astrolophida is spherical, and in the younger\r\nspecimens contains a single large concentric and lobed nucleus, but in the\r\nolder specimens a large number of small nuclei. The surrounding jelly-veil\r\nor calymma seems commonly to envelop the spines perfectly. The piercing\r\npseudopodia radiate everywhere between the spines, and are very numerous\r\nand thin. The circulating granules in them are sometimes red (_Actinelius\r\npurpureus_).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Astrolophida._\r\n\r\n  Radial spines of indefinite {Spines of equal size,    317. _Actinelius_.\r\n  number and of irregular     {\r\n  disposition.                {Spines of unequal size,  318. _Astrolophus_.\r\n\r\n  Radial spines thirty-two, disposed regularly\r\n    in five parallel zones,                             319. _Actinastrum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 317. _Actinelius_,[357] Haeckel, 1865, Zeitschr. f. wiss.

LITHOLOPHIDA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Litholophida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 401.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a variable number of simple radial spines\r\nradiating within a conical space (or within the quadrant of a sphere) from\r\none common central point, which is the apex of the conical central capsule.\r\nNo lattice-shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Litholophida#, represented only by a single genus,\r\n_Litholophus_, differs from all other ACANTHARIA in the remarkable fact\r\nthat the common point, from which the radial spines arise, is not the\r\ngeometrical central point of the whole body, but is quite excentric in\r\nposition, the apex of the conical or pyramidal central capsule. Therefore\r\nthe spines form together a kind of brush or broom.\r\n\r\nWhen I founded the family Litholophida in my Monograph (1862, p. 401) I\r\nknew only a single species, _Litholophus rhipidium_, observed very\r\nfrequently in Messina. Another species, _Litholophus ligurinus_, was\r\nafterwards (1864) found by me at Nice. Six other species were detected in\r\nthe preparations of the Challenger, some of them very frequent. All these\r\neight species of _Litholophus_ are very nearly allied, and exhibit only\r\nslight differences in the form and number of the radial spines; their mode\r\nof excentric connection and the structure of the peculiar soft body is\r\neverywhere the same.\r\n\r\nThe radial spines in all observed Litholophida possess the form of the\r\ngenus _Acanthonia_, _i.e._, they are quite simple, four-sided prismatic or\r\nquadrangular, with square transverse section; their four edges are\r\nsometimes smooth, at other times elegantly denticulate, commonly more or\r\nless prominent or wing-shaped. In the greater number of species they are\r\nvery long and of nearly equal breadth, prismatic; in some species they are\r\nmore pyramidal, thinned towards the distal end; the latter {734}is commonly\r\ntruncated or broken off, sometimes pyramidal. The central end is everywhere\r\nthinned, more or less pyramidal, and the neighbouring spines are propped\r\none upon another by the triangular faces of their small basal pyramids. A\r\nslight pressure is sufficient to destroy their connection.\r\n\r\nThe number and disposition of the radial spines seem to be variable and\r\nirregular, but require further researches. In four of the observed eight\r\nspecies I found constantly ten spines, in two other species from ten to\r\ntwenty (commonly twelve or sixteen), and in two species twenty or more. A\r\ncertain order or disposition of the spines within the conical space in\r\nwhich they radiate could nowhere be ascertained.\r\n\r\nWhen I first observed _Litholophus_, I supposed that it might only be a\r\nmutilated or altered form of an _Acanthonia_. Afterwards, observing many\r\nspecimens with ten spines, I was led to the suggestion that they were\r\nproduced by self-division of an _Acanthonia_, and that the number of the\r\nspines in each half of the body might be afterwards doubled. But this\r\nsuggestion seems to be refuted by the fact that in no other genus of the\r\nnumerous ACANTHARIA is self-division observed, and that many hundreds of\r\n_Litholophus_ which I observed exhibit quite constantly only a single form\r\nof radial spines, that of _Acanthonia_--simple quadrangular spines without\r\nany apophyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 320. _Litholophus_,[360] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

It envelops the basal half of all radial spines in such a\r\nmanner that their basal parts are united in its apex, and their distal\r\nparts pierce the rounded base of the conical capsule (Pl. 129, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe calymma or the jelly envelope of the central capsule is only developed\r\nat its base, where the spines radiate; at the conical mantle of the capsule\r\nit is very thin. The spines seem to be perfectly enclosed in the calymma\r\nand connected with it by the same contractile retinacula or \"myophrisca\"\r\nwhich we observe in the #Acanthonida#.

Radiol., p. 402.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a variable number of simple radial spines,\r\nwhich are grown together in pairs (two opposite spines of each pair\r\nrepresenting together a single diametral spine). Diametral spines crossed\r\nloosely in the centre of the spherical or irregular roundish central\r\ncapsule. No lattice-shell.\r\n\r\n{737}The family #Chiastolida# (or Acanthochiasmida) differs from all other\r\nACANTHARIA in the peculiar mode of the radial spines; these grown together\r\nin pairs in the centre of the body, so that every two spines opposite in\r\none axis of the body form together one single diametral spine. All\r\ndiametral spines are loosely crossed in the middle of the central capsule,\r\nor connected by a peculiar screw-like winding, but not united firmly.\r\n\r\nI established the family Acanthochiasmida in my Monograph (1862, p. 402)\r\nupon the single genus _Acanthochiasma_ (with three species), in which only\r\nten diametral spines are constantly found; I derived these from the twenty\r\nradial spines of the common #Acanthometra#, supposing that every two\r\nopposite spines of the latter (lying in one axis) were grown together in\r\nthe centre, whilst the intimate connection of the twenty radial spines in\r\nthe common centre was dissolved. This opinion was afterwards confirmed by\r\nRichard Hertwig, who observed _Acanthochiasma_ intact in the living state.\r\nAlthough two species of this genus are cosmopolitan and very common, the\r\nnumber of species is very small; I could add to those three older known\r\nforms only a single new species.\r\n\r\nAnother genus of this family, _Chiastolus_, was observed by me only in a\r\nsingle specimen but it is extremely interesting. It has sixteen diametral\r\nspines, disposed quite regularly after the same law of the thirty-two\r\nspines of _Actinastrum_ which we described above (compare above, p. 729).\r\nTherefore we cannot doubt that the former is derived from the latter in the\r\nsame way, every two opposite radial spines (of one axis) being grown\r\ntogether to form a single diametral spine. As we place _Acanthometron_\r\n(with twenty spines) and _Actinastrum_ (with thirty-two spines) in two\r\ndifferent families, it would perhaps be more convenient to separate also\r\n_Acanthochiasma_ and _Chiastolus_ as representatives of two different\r\nfamilies--Acanthochiasmida (with ten diametral spines) and Chiastolida\r\n(with sixteen diametral spines).\r\n\r\nAs we derive _Acanthochiasma_ from _Acanthometron_ by concrescence in pairs\r\nof the twenty radial spines, the Müllerian law of Icosacantha must be\r\nemployed also to the ten diametral spines of the former, therefore two of\r\nthem are equatorial, four tropical, and four polar spines. In the same way\r\nwe may employ the new law of disposition found in the thirty-two radial\r\nspines of _Actinastrum_ equally to the sixteen diametral spines of\r\n_Chiastolus_, which we derive from the former, four of them are equatorial,\r\neight tropical, and four polar spines (compare above, p. 732).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Chiastolida is spherical, and exhibits in\r\ngeneral the same shape as in the #Acanthonida#, and specially in the\r\nAstrolonchida. Of course every diametral spine pierces the capsule twice,\r\nat two points diametrically opposed. In some species of _Acanthochiasma_\r\nthe central capsule is formed very late, so that it seems often to be\r\nabsent. A very accurate description of the capsule and its nucleus, as well\r\nas of the calymma and the pseudopodia, is given by Richard Hertwig in his\r\nOrganismus der Radiolarien (1879, pp. 10-18). The pseudopodia are very\r\nnumerous, and sometimes bear reddish granules.\r\n\r\n{738}_Synopsis of the Genera of Chiastolida._\r\n\r\n  I. Subfamily Chiastolidina.

Four of these spines are equatorial,\r\nfour polar, and eight tropical. We derive _Chiastolus_ from _Actinastrum_\r\nby concrescence of every two opposite spines in one axis of the body\r\n(compare above, pp. 729, 732).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Chiastolus amphicopium_, n. sp.

These cochleary central parts of the\r\nsixteen spines seem to be resting one upon another. Each spine (composed of\r\ntwo opposite equal radial spines) has nearly the form of a double oar. The\r\nsingle observed specimen (preserved in glycerine) exhibited a most regular\r\ndisposition of the thirty-two spines (grown together in pairs in the\r\ncentre).

ACANTHONIDA, Haeckel (Pls. 130-132).\r\n\r\n_Acanthonida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with twenty radial spines, disposed according\r\nto the Müllerian or Icosacanthan law in five zones each of four spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily XXXVI. #ASTROLONCHIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 130).\r\n\r\n_Astrolonchida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with twenty radial spines of nearly equal\r\nsize and similar form, disposed according to the law of the Icosacantha. No\r\nlattice-shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Astrolonchida#, the first and oldest of the #Acanthonida#, is\r\nno doubt the ancestral stock not only of this suborder but also all\r\n#Acanthophracta#, _i.e._, of all Icosacantha or all ACANTHARIA in which\r\ntwenty radial spines are regularly disposed according to the Müllerian law,\r\nforming five zones each of four alternating spines (compare above, p. 717).\r\nThe Astrolonchida differ from the #Acanthophracta# in the absence of a\r\ncomplete lattice-shell, from the other two families of #Acanthonida# (the\r\nQuadrilonchida and Amphilonchida) in the equal size and similar form of all\r\nthe spines. Probably this equality is nowhere quite perfect, since in all\r\nIcosacantha the central bases of the twenty spines exhibit originally\r\ncertain slight differences of form and junction, effected by the regular\r\ndisposition itself. But setting aside this slight difference, only\r\nrecognisable by means of a very accurate investigation of the central\r\njunction (and in thinner spines often not at all recognisable), the twenty\r\nspines of the Astrolonchida appear perfectly equal. Therefore the four\r\nequatorial spines are not distinguished from the sixteen other spines, as\r\nis constantly the case in the two following families.\r\n\r\nThe number of genera (eleven) and of species (seventy-six) in the\r\nAstrolonchida is far larger than in the five other families of\r\n#Acanthometra#, and requires a distinction into three different\r\nsubfamilies. (A) In the Zygacanthida the form of the radial spines is quite\r\nsimple, without apophyses or transverse processes; (B) in the\r\nPhractacanthida each spine bears two opposite apophyses (rarely two\r\nlongitudinal rows of these opposite apophyses); (C) in the Stauracanthida\r\neach spine bears a cross of four apophyses, opposite in pairs (rarely four\r\nlongitudinal crossed rows of apophyses, opposite in pairs). The\r\nPhractacanthida and Stauracanthida appear as two divergent branches of the\r\npedigree, derived independently from the common ancestral stock of\r\nZygacanthida.\r\n\r\nIn the Zygacanthida, constantly devoid of apophyses, we can distinguish\r\nonly three genera, characterised by the different fundamental form of the\r\nradial spines; these are:--(1) _Acanthometron_, with cylindrical or conical\r\nspines (without edges); (2) _Zygacantha_, with compressed and two-edged\r\nspines; (3) _Acanthonia_, with four-edged, prismatic or pyramidal spines.\r\nThe transverse section of the spines is in the first case {741}circular, in\r\nthe second elliptical or lanceolate, in the third square. All the different\r\nforms of spines, which we find in the numerous ACANTHARIA, may be reduced\r\nto these three forms, and among these the second and third are derived from\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nThe development of apophyses or of lateral transverse processes (wanting in\r\nthe Zygacanthida) is of the greatest value for the further differentiation\r\nof the ACANTHARIA. For from the Phractacanthida (with two opposite\r\napophyses on each spine) we must derive the Phrastaspida, the common\r\nancestral stock of the Diporaspida (and therefore also the Belonaspida,\r\nHexalaspida, Diploconida, and Phractopeltida). On the other hand the\r\nStauracanthida (with four crossed apophyses on each spine) have produced\r\nthe Stauraspida, or the ancestral group of the Tessaraspida and\r\nSphærocapsida. From all these #Acanthophracta#, possessing a complete\r\nlattice-shell, the Astrolonchida differ in the absence of such a complete\r\nshell. Also in the few cases in which the apophyses become latticed\r\n(_Doracantha_ among the Phractacanthida, and _Phatnacantha_ among the\r\nStauracanthida), the lattice-plates of the neighbouring spines never meet\r\nwith their edges, as is the case in all #Acanthophracta#. But in a\r\nphylogenetic as well as in an ontogenetic sense the former are the\r\nancestral stock of the latter.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ in the Astrolonchida is commonly spherical, sometimes\r\nwith twenty roundish elevations or conical papillæ, extending radially to\r\nthe basal half of the radial spines. The calymma is voluminous, and forms\r\naround the radial spines conical or cylindrical \"jelly-sheaths,\" which are\r\nconnected with the spines by coronas of Myophrisca (or of the bodies\r\nformerly called \"Gallert-cilien,\" afterwards recognised as \"contractile\r\nFilamente\").\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Astrolonchida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

No lattice-shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Quadrilonchida# differs from the foregoing ancestral family,\r\nthe Astrolonchida, in the unequal development of the twenty radial spines.\r\nThe four equatorial spines are constantly much larger, and often also of\r\nanother form and shape, than the sixteen other spines; often also among\r\nthese the eight tropical spines are larger and of another form than the\r\neight polar spines. Therefore the five parallel girdles or zones of every\r\nfour spines, which in the Astrolonchida are equal, are here distinctly\r\nunequal. The whole body is flattened and compressed in the direction of the\r\nspineless axis, so that the equatorial plane is larger than any other\r\nplane, laid through the centre. In consequence of this flattening the\r\ncentral capsule is also commonly compressed and flattened, lenticular or\r\ndiscoidal, rarely spherical. In the Astrolonchida the \"promorph\" or the\r\n\"geometrical fundamental form\" is constantly a square double pyramid, the\r\naxes of which are of equal length.  In the Quadrilonchida it becomes a\r\nsquare double pyramid, the two equatorial axes of which (or the diagonals\r\nof the square) are constantly longer than all other axes.\r\n\r\nIn the simpler forms of Quadrilonchida are found only two different kinds\r\nof spines, the four larger equatorial spines being of the same size and\r\nform, and the sixteen smaller {767}spines also not differing from one\r\nanother (_Acanthostaurus_, &c.).  But in the majority of this family there\r\nare three different kinds: four larger equatorial spines, eight tropical\r\nspines of middle size, and eight smaller polar spines (_Belonostaurus_,\r\n&c.); the latter become sometimes rudimentary, so that only twelve spines\r\nare developed (four larger equatorial and eight smaller tropical spines).\r\nIn this case the development of the flat discoidal body is much stronger in\r\nthe equatorial plane than in all other planes. These discoidal or\r\nlenticular Quadrilonchida exhibit a relation to the spherical Astrolonchida\r\nsimilar to that which the #Discoidea# exhibit to the #Sphæroidea# among the\r\n#Sphærellaria#.\r\n\r\nA further morphological differentation takes place in the remarkable genera\r\n_Lonchostaurus_ and _Zygostaurus_. In the former (Pl. 131, figs. 4-6) the\r\nfour larger equatorial spines becomes differentiated in pairs, so that the\r\nopposite equal spines of one pair, _c_1, _c_3 (in the longitudinal or\r\nhydrotomical axis), are larger, and often also of another form, than the\r\nopposite equal spines of the other pair, _c_2, _c_4 (in the transverse or\r\ngeotomical axis). The most peculiar form is the rather common _Zygostaurus_\r\n(Pl. 131, figs. 7, 8). Here the two opposite spines of one equatorial axis\r\n(of the longitudinal axis) become very different, so that the anterior or\r\nfrontal spine (_c_1) is very unequal to the posterior or caudal spine\r\n(_c_3), whereas the two opposite spines, of the other equatorial axis (of\r\nthe transverse axis) remain equal (_c_2, _c_4). Therefore the fundamental\r\nforms become here \"amphithect,\" as in the Ctenophora.\r\n\r\nThe numerous Quadrilonchida may be disposed in two different subfamilies:\r\nin the Acanthostaurida all twenty radial spines are simple, without\r\napophyses; in the Lithopterida all twenty spines (or  only one part of\r\nthem) bear two opposite apophyses (or lateral transverse processes). The\r\nformer correspond to the Zygacanthida, the latter to the Phractacanthida\r\namong the Astrolonchida. The two opposite apophyses are simple in\r\n_Quadrilonche_ (Pl. 133, fig. 1). In _Xiphoptera_ they are provided on\r\ntheir distal side with lateral branches which are parallel to the spine\r\nitself. In _Lithoptera_ the spines bear two to four parallel pairs of\r\ntransverse apophyses, and these are crossed by perpendicular branches,\r\nparallel to the spine itself, so that there arise fenestrated wings or\r\nlatticed plates, comparable to the sails of a wind-mill. The lattice-work\r\nof these plates lies in the same meridian plane with the radial spine\r\nitself, and is therefore not comparable to the fenestrated apophyses of\r\n_Doracantha_, of _Phatnacantha_, and of the Dorataspida; in these the\r\nlattice-plates lie in tangential planes, perpendicular to the radial spine.\r\n\r\nThe apophyses of the Lithopterida may be developed either on all twenty\r\nspines equally, or only on twelve spines (four equatorial and eight\r\ntropical, whilst the eight polar spines are simple, Pl. 131, fig. 10), or\r\nonly on the four equatorial spines (whilst the sixteen others are simple,\r\nPl. 131, fig. 9).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Quadrilonchida is rarely spherical, commonly\r\nmore or {768}less compressed from both poles of the spineless axis,\r\nlenticular or discoidal, sometimes square. It is enveloped by a voluminous\r\ncalymma constantly bearing coronals of \"Myophrisca\" (compare p. 724).\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Quadrilonchida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

No\r\nlattice-shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Amphilonchida# is distinguished from all other #Acanthometra#\r\nby the excessive development of two opposite equatorial spines, which are\r\nmuch larger {782}than the eighteen other spines. In my Monograph (1862, p.\r\n389) I had united all these Acanthonida in a single genus _Amphilonche_\r\n(with ten species). Some species of it are very common and widely\r\ndistributed; but in general the number of different forms in this family is\r\nmuch smaller than in the two foregoing families.\r\n\r\nThe two principal spines, which in all Amphilonchida are much larger than\r\nthe eighteen other spines, characterise the \"hydrotomical axis\" or the\r\nlarger equatorial axis. The two other equatorial spines or the \"geotomical\r\nspines\" are much smaller, and commonly of the same size as the eight\r\ntropical and the eight polar spines. In the genera _Amphilonche_ and\r\n_Amphibelone_ these eighteen smaller spines are rather equally developed;\r\nsometimes they are very small or quite rudimentary, so that the skeleton\r\nseems to be represented only by the two very long principal spines (Pl.\r\n132, fig. 4). The genus _Acantholonche_ is distinguished by the unequal\r\nsize of the eight tropical and the eight polar spines, the latter being\r\nmore or less rudimentary. However, the central bases of all twenty spines,\r\nby which they are united in the centre, are constantly present. The genus\r\n_Amphibelone_ is distinguished by the unequal size and form of the two\r\nprincipal spines, one of them the \"caudal spine,\" being larger (and often\r\nof another form) than the opposite \"frontal spine.\"\r\n\r\nThe form of the radial spines is in the Amphilonchida far less varied and\r\ncomplicated than in the other Acanthonida (the Astrolonchida and\r\nQuadrilonchida). Apophyses or lateral transverse processes are never\r\ndeveloped. The three main forms of spines are the same as in the other\r\nAcanthonida; they are (1) either cylindrical or conical (like\r\n_Acanthometron_), or (2) compressed or two-edged (like _Zygacantha_), or\r\n(3) quadrangular or four-edged (like _Acanthonia_). Often the spines are\r\nangular in the inner or proximal, roundish in the outer or distal part. The\r\ndistal apex is commonly simple, conical or pyramidal. The central base is\r\ncommonly also pyramidal, as in the majority of the Acanthonida; and the\r\ntriangular faces of the neighbouring bases are simply propped one upon\r\nanother. More rarely a basal leaf-cross is developed above the basal\r\npyramid. Very rarely the central bases of the united spines grow together\r\nin the centre, so that the whole skeleton forms a single piece of acanthin.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ is rarely spherical, commonly prolonged in the\r\ndirection of the hydrotomical axis; ellipsoidal or cylindrical, sometimes\r\nalso four-sided prismatic; it commonly envelops the greater part of the two\r\nprincipal spines; its structure and contents are the same as in the other\r\nAcanthonida.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Amphilonchida._\r\n\r\n                          { Two opposite large\r\n                          {   principal spines\r\n  Eighteen smaller spines {   (frontal and caudal)\r\n    of nearly equal size  {   equal,                  341. _Amphilonche_.\r\n    and similar form.     {\r\n                          { Caudal spine larger than\r\n                          {   the frontal spine,      342. _Amphibelone_.\r\n\r\n  Eight tropical and eight polar spines of different\r\n    sizes (the latter often rudimentary),             343. _Acantholonche_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{783}Genus 341. _Amphilonche_,[381] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

By the possession of such a complete shell the\r\n#Acanthophracta# differ from their ancestral group, the nearly allied\r\n#Acanthometra#, which represent the older and simpler, first order of\r\nACANTHARIA. All #Acanthophracta# are Icosacantha (like the #Acanthonida#,\r\ntheir ancestral group), and possess twenty radial spines disposed according\r\nto the Müllerian law (compare above, p. 717).\r\n\r\nJohannes Müller, who first observed five representatives of this order,\r\ncalled a part of them \"_Acanthometræ cataphractæ_,\" and united these with\r\nthe true #Acanthometra# (_Acanthometra costata_ and _Acanthometra\r\ncataphracta_; Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 12, 49).\r\nAnother part was united by him with the true _Haliomma_ (_Haliomma\r\nechinoides_, _Haliomma hystrix_, _Haliomma tabulatum_; Abhandl. d. k. Akad.\r\nd. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 36, 37). He supposed that these latter formed\r\nthe immediate transition from the true #Acanthometra# to the true\r\n_Haliomma_, and that their skeleton was siliceous.\r\n\r\n{792}In my Monograph (1862, p. 412) I founded a separate subfamily,\r\nDorataspida, for the \"_Acanthometræ cataphractæ,_\" which I considered as\r\nthe first subfamily of the \"Ommatida.\" That subfamily contained at that\r\ntime only two genera, _Dorataspis_ (with seven species) and\r\n_Haliommatidium_ (with five species). A third genus, _Aspidomma_ (with two\r\nspecies), was united by me with the Haliommatida (because of its double\r\nshell). For a fourth genus (_Diploconus_) with a single species I founded\r\nthe peculiar family of Diploconida. Therefore the whole number of\r\n#Acanthophracta# described in my Monograph amounted only to four genera and\r\nfifteen species. Now the rich collections of the Challenger have added such\r\na great number of new forms, that we may distinguish here thirty-eight\r\ngenera and two hundred and twelve species.\r\n\r\nRichard Hertwig in his excellent work (Der Organismus der Radiolarien,\r\n1879, p. 25) separated his \"Acanthophractida\" perfectly from the \"Ommatida\"\r\n(or the siliceous #Sphæroidea#), and united them with the \"Acanthometrida\"\r\nin his order \"Acanthometrea.\" But he separated them also from the nearly\r\nallied Diploconida, following my former arrangement. He distinctly noted\r\nthat the skeleton in all these Acanthophractida (as well as in the\r\nAcanthometrida) consists not of silex but of the organic substance\r\n\"acanthin.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonishing number of new and interesting forms of #Acanthophracta#\r\nwhich I have found in the rich collection of the Challenger enables me to\r\ndistinguish now in this suborder six different families, two of which are\r\nperfectly new (the Sphærocapsida and the Hexalaspida). But the four other\r\nfamilies also are so much enlarged that their interesting morphology\r\nappears in quite a new and clear light. Far the largest and most important\r\nof these six families is that of the true Dorataspida, which embraces\r\nseventeen genera and one hundred and eight species (more than the other\r\nfive families together). From this largest and oldest ancestral family four\r\nother families have afterwards arisen, whilst a single family, the\r\nSphærocapsida, seems to possess no direct phylogenetic connection with the\r\nfive other families.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar and quite new family of Sphærocapsida (Pl. 133, figs. 7-11;\r\nPl. 135, figs. 6-10) differs from all other #Acanthophracta# in the\r\nsingular structure of the spherical acanthinic shell, composed of\r\ninnumerable small plates or aglets, each of which is pierced by a very\r\nsmall porule. This peculiar pavemented shell (enclosing the central capsule\r\nand separated from it by the jelly-like calymma) seems to be produced on\r\nthe surface of the spherical calymma, immediately by secretion of the\r\npseudopodia, and independently from the twenty radial spines, united in the\r\ncentre of the sphere. On the twenty points, where the spines perforate the\r\nshell, there are originally eighty larger pores (four around each piercing\r\nspine); but there is no certain indication that the shell is produced by\r\nthe meeting apophyses of the twenty spines, as is the case in the five\r\nother families of #Acanthophracta#. Therefore perhaps it is {793}more\r\nnatural to unite these latter into another suborder as #Cladophracta#, and\r\nto separate them from the Sphærocapsida, which may be called Capsophractæ.\r\n\r\nThe Dorataspida (Pls. 134-138), the common ancestral stock of the\r\n#Cladophracta#, in the definition here restricted embraces all those\r\n#Acanthophracta# in which the spherical lattice-shell is simple and\r\ncomposed of the meeting branches of twenty radial spines united in its\r\ncentre. As already pointed out above, this family is probably diphyletic,\r\nand embraces two subfamilies which have been derived originally from two\r\ndifferent forms of #Acanthonida#--the Diporaspida (with two opposite\r\napophyses on each spine) derived from the Phractacanthida, and the\r\nTessaraspida (with four crossed apophyses on each spine) derived from the\r\nStauracanthida; in the former we find originally forty apophyses, in the\r\nlatter eighty apophyses, by the meeting branches of which the spherical\r\nlattice-shell originates. The four following families of #Acanthophracta#\r\nhave probably been derived from the Diporaspida.\r\n\r\nThe Phractopeltida (Pl. 133, figs. 1-6) differ from all other\r\n#Acanthophracta# in the possession of a double lattice-shell, composed of\r\ntwo concentric spheres which are united by the twenty radial spines meeting\r\nin the centre. As all Phractopeltida possess originally only two apophyses\r\non each radial spine, they must be derived from the Diporaspida\r\n(_Orophaspis_), and bear to them the same relation as the Dyosphærida do to\r\nthe Monosphærida. As the spherical central capsule of the Phractopeltida is\r\nenclosed between both shells, smaller than the outer, larger than the inner\r\nshell, the latter may be called \"medullary shell,\" the former \"cortical\r\nshell.\" This family represents among the #Acanthophracta# only the\r\n\"Diplophracta,\" whilst all others are \"Haplophracta.\"\r\n\r\nThe three families here characterised may be called together\r\n\"#Sphærophracta#,\" as their central capsule and the enveloping shell are\r\nconstantly spherical (or the shell sometimes an \"endospherical\r\npolyhedron\"). On the contrary the following three families of\r\n#Acanthophracta# may be united as \"#Prunophracta#,\" as their central\r\ncapsule and shell are never spherical, but either ellipsoidal or lenticular\r\nor of another form. The common ancestral stock of this suborder are the\r\nBelonaspida, in which the form of the central capsule and the enclosing\r\nlattice-shell is ellipsoidal; they are derived from the Dorataspida (and\r\nprobably all from the subfamily Diporaspida) by the prolongation of two\r\nopposite radial spines which are larger than the eighteen others; they are\r\nthe two equatorial spines of the \"hydrotomical axis\" (compare above, p.\r\n719, and Pl. 136, figs. 6-9).\r\n\r\nThe Hexalaspida (Pl. 139) represent a new and very remarkable family,\r\ndistinguished from all other #Acanthophracta# by the preponderating\r\ndevelopment of six stout radial spines, which are much larger than the\r\nfourteen others. These six principal spines lie in one meridian plane of\r\nthe shell (in the \"hydrotomical plane,\" p. 720), and are the two opposite\r\nequatorial spines and the four appertaining polar spines of the same plane.\r\n{794}As the fourteen smaller spines develop their apophyses at smaller\r\ndistances from the centre, the shell assumes a peculiar lenticular or\r\ndiscoidal form, and the margin of this disk bears the six larger spines.\r\nMoreover the enclosed small central capsule is lenticular. The Hexalaspida\r\nmay be derived immediately from the Belonaspida.\r\n\r\nThe Diploconida (Pl. 140) form the last and the most modified family of all\r\n#Acanthophracta#. The remarkable shell exhibits the strange form of a\r\ndouble cone, bearing in its axis two very large opposite spines; these are\r\nthe two equatorial spines of the \"hydrotomical axis\" (p. 719). The\r\ndouble-conical or nearly cylindrical shell is composed of three different\r\nparts or segments; the small middle part is the true lattice-shell of the\r\nHexalaspida and Belonaspida, and bears the eighteen smaller (often quite\r\nrudimentary) radial spines. The two other parts (opposite on both poles of\r\nits hydrotomical axis) are the conical or cylindrical, solid, basal sheaths\r\nof the two large equatorial spines, enveloping their major part. In\r\nconsequence of this peculiar metamorphosis of the shell the Diploconida\r\nrepresent the last and the most aberrant group of all ACANTHARIA.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Suborders and Families of_ #Acanthophracta#.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Suborder I.

SPHÆROPHRACTA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Shell spherical, with twenty radial beams of equal size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily XXXIX. #SPHÆROCAPSIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135, figs.\r\n6-10).\r\n\r\n_Sphærocapsida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple spherical porous shell, composed of\r\ninnumerable very small plates, each of which is pierced by one radial\r\nporule. Twenty radial spines of equal size meeting in the centre of the\r\nshell and disposed according to the Müllerian law of the Icosacantha,\r\nsometimes short and enclosed in the shell, at other times long and piercing\r\nit (rarely rudimentary or quite absent). Shell pierced therefore either by\r\ntwenty larger perspinal pores or by eighty smaller aspinal pores. Central\r\ncapsule spherical, enclosed in the porous shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Sphærocapsida#, founded by me in 1881 for the single genus\r\n_Sphærocapsa_, represents a very peculiar and remarkable group of the\r\n#Acanthophracta#, very different from the five other families of this\r\nsuborder, and probably derived, independently of them, directly from the\r\n#Acanthonida#. Whilst the lattice-shell of the five other families is\r\ncomposed of the meeting branches of lateral apophyses of the twenty spines,\r\nand its meshes are all or partly the intervals between these apophyses, in\r\nthe Sphærocapsida the spherical shell has quite another structure, and is\r\ncomposed of innumerable small plates (each with one pore) which are\r\nsecreted on the surface of the spherical calymma, independently of the\r\ntwenty radial spines, which do not possess true apophyses.\r\n\r\nIn all Sphærocapsida the structure of the spherical shell is quite peculiar\r\nand different from that of all other Radiolaria. It is composed everywhere\r\nof innumerable very small plates or aglets, which are connected irregularly\r\nlike paving-stones, and form a single continuous layer or pavement on the\r\nsurface of the spherical calymma (Pl. 133, fig. 11, _a_; Pl. 135, figs. 8,\r\n10). The small plates or paving-stones, which we will call \"aglets,\" are\r\nconnected at their meeting edges by a kind of cement, and form together\r\nwith it a continuous thick capsule of acanthin. The form of the aglets is\r\ncommonly more or less irregular, roundish or polygonal, sometimes longish\r\n(Pl. 133, fig. 11, _a_), more rarely it becomes rather regular, hexagonal,\r\nsquare, or roundish (Pl. 135, fig. 8). Usually all aglets of one and the\r\nsame individual are of nearly equal size, between 0.01 and 0.02 in\r\ndiameter, rarely less or more. The outer face of the aglets is more or less\r\nconcave, so that the elevated meeting edges of the neighbouring aglets\r\ncommonly form together a prominent network of crests (Pl. 135, figs. 8,\r\n10); rarely the meeting edges partly cover one another like squamules (Pl.\r\n133, fig. 11, _a_). {796}Each small plate or aglet is pierced in its centre\r\nby a single radial canalicule or porule. The dimpled surface, so produced,\r\nresembles somewhat the dimpled plates of _Ceriaspis_, &c. Different from\r\nthese innumerable very small dimples of the surface are the twenty larger\r\n\"spinal dimples,\" or the concave larger plates, which are originally\r\npierced by the twenty radial spines. Before we describe these, we must\r\nexamine the spines themselves.\r\n\r\nThe twenty radial spines of all observed Sphærocapsida (sixteen species)\r\nagree perfectly with those of the genus _Acanthonia_ (p. 749), and\r\nespecially with _Acanthonia tetracopa_, _Acanthonia denticulata_, &c. All\r\ntwenty spines, regularly disposed according to the Müllerian law of the\r\nIcosacantha, are of equal size, constantly four-edged prismatic, of equal\r\nbreadth throughout their whole length. The prominent four edges are\r\nparallel, sometimes smooth, at other times elegantly denticulated. The\r\ncentral bases of the twenty spines are pyramidal, without leaf-cross, and\r\npropped one upon another with their triangular faces, as in the majority of\r\nthe #Acanthonida#.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the twenty radial spines to the spherical shell exhibits in\r\nthe five genera described very peculiar and important differences. In the\r\nfirst described genus, in _Sphærocapsa_, the spines are exactly as long as\r\nthe shell-radius, and therefore are not prominent over the surface of the\r\nshell, with which they are firmly connected; the truncated distal end of\r\nthe spine lies therefore here in the surface of the shell itself, and is\r\nconnected with it by its four edges, between which four open aspinal pores\r\nremain, as in _Tessaraspis_, &c. (Pl. 135, figs. 6-10). In the next allied\r\ngenus, _Astrocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 9, 10), the spines are longer than the\r\nshell-radius, and therefore more or less prominent over its surface; the\r\npiercing part of each spine is also surrounded by four aspinal pores. In\r\nthe two following genera, _Porocapsa_ and _Cannocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 7,\r\n8), the radial spines are shorter than the shell-radius and therefore quite\r\nhidden and withdrawn inside the shell, which they do not reach. But in the\r\nideal prolongation of each spine the shell is pierced by a single large\r\nopening, the \"perspinal pore\" or \"perspinal hole,\" composed of the four\r\nunited aspinal pores. Whilst in _Porocapsa_ the perspinal pores are simple,\r\nthey are prolonged in _Cannocapsa_ into cylindrical tubes, open at both\r\nends. The twenty perspinal holes of these Porocapsida are therefore derived\r\nby confluence of the eighty original aspinal pores of the Astrocapsida and\r\npreserve the same regular disposition, according to the Müllerian law of\r\nthe Icosacantha. Finally, the same law as is valid also in the last genus\r\nis found in _Cenocapsa_; here the radial spines have completely\r\ndisappeared, and the whole skeleton is a simple sphere, but of the same\r\nstructure, and with the same twenty perspinal pores as in _Porocapsa_. It\r\nis very interesting that this spineless _Cenocapsa_ among the ACANTHARIA\r\nexhibits the same shell (a simple hollow sphere) as a last reduced form,\r\nwhich _Cenosphæra_ among the #Sphærellaria# produces as a primitive\r\nancestral form of numerous genera.\r\n\r\n{797}_The Central Capsule_ of the Sphærocapsida is spherical, constantly\r\nsmaller than the enclosing concentric shell, and separated from it by the\r\ncalymma. Its structure seems to be the same as in the #Acanthonida#, and\r\nspecially in the Astrolonchida. The pseudopodia (not yet observed) are\r\nprobably protruded only through the twenty perspinal holes or the eighty\r\naspinal pores.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Sphærocapsida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The\r\ntwenty radial spines of the Icosacantha have perfectly disappeared by\r\ncomplete retrograde metamorphosis, and the only evidence of their former\r\nexistence (in the ancestral genus _Porocapsa_) are the twenty perspinal\r\nholes remaining in the shell. _Cenocapsa_ is the only form of ACANTHARIA\r\nwhich possesses no radial spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Cenocapsa nirvana_, n. sp.

Radiol., p. 412.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple spherical lattice-shell, composed of\r\nthe branched apophyses of twenty equal radial spines meeting in its centre\r\nand disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha. Central capsule\r\nspherical, enclosed in the fenestrated shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Dorataspida# is the most important family of the\r\n#Acanthophracta#, or of those ACANTHARIA in which the radial spines are\r\nconnected by a complete extracapsular lattice-shell. The Dorataspida\r\nrepresent probably the ancestral {803}stock of this whole order, with the\r\nexception of the Sphærocapsida. The four following families of the order\r\nmay be easily derived from the Dorataspida. The number of genera\r\n(seventeen) and of species (one hundred and eight) is in this family\r\ngreater than in the other five families together. When I constituted that\r\nfamily in my Monograph 1862, it comprised only one genus, _Dorataspis_,\r\nwith seven species. The nearly allied genus _Haliommatidium_ (_Phatnaspis_)\r\nbelongs to the Belonaspida.\r\n\r\nThe Dorataspida differ from the other #Acanthophracta# in the simple\r\nspherical lattice-shell, which is composed of the meeting apophyses of the\r\ntwenty radial spines. In three other families of the suborder the shell is\r\nnot spherical, but ellipsoidal (Belonaspida), discoidal (Hexalaspida), or\r\ndiploconical (Diploconida). In the Phractopeltida the spherical shell is\r\ndouble, composed of two concentric lattice-spheres. In the Sphærocapsida\r\nthe simple spherical shell is not composed of the apophyses of the spines,\r\nbut of innumerable small plates.\r\n\r\nThe family Dorataspida may be divided into two very different subfamilies,\r\nwhich are probably derived, independently of one another, from  two\r\ndifferent subfamilies of the Astrolonchida. The first subfamily,\r\nDiporaspida, exhibits on each radial spine two opposite apophyses, like its\r\nancestral group, the Phractacanthida (p. 753); whereas the second\r\nsubfamily, Tessaraspida, possesses on each radial spine four crossed\r\napophyses (opposite in pairs), like its ancestral group, the Stauracanthida\r\n(p. 758). Therefore the composition of the spherical shell, produced by the\r\nmeeting branches of the tangential apophyses, is essentially different in\r\nthe two subfamilies: in the Diporaspida each radial spine is surrounded by\r\ntwo opposite primary aspinal meshes, in the Tessaraspida by four crossed\r\nprimary aspinal meshes.\r\n\r\nAnother principle of division may be established for the whole family by\r\nthe different mode of composition of the shell, and regarding this\r\nimportant difference we may distinguish also two different subfamilies as\r\n#Cladophracta# and #Peltophracta#. In the first and simpler subfamily, the\r\n#Cladophracta#, the shell is composed totally (or sometimes partially) of\r\nthe meeting branches of the apophyses of the neighbouring spines; but in\r\neach single spine (or in the most part of them) the branches of the\r\napophyses are not united, and form no lattice-plate (Pl. 137, figs. 1 to\r\n8). Whereas in the #Peltophracta# the shell is composed constantly of\r\ntwenty perforated plates, as in each single spine the branches of its\r\napophyses are united and form a fenestrated shield with two or four (and\r\nsometimes numerous) pores (Pls. 135, 136, 138).\r\n\r\nIn the Diporaspida as well as in the Tessaraspida we find numerous\r\nrepresentatives of the two groups of the #Cladophracta# and of the\r\n#Peltophracta#; therefore the whole family of Dorataspida may be divided\r\ninto four different tribes. The Diporaspida (with two opposite apophyses on\r\neach spine) are partly #Cladophracta# (the Phractaspida, Pl. 137, figs.\r\n1-4), partly #Peltophracta# (the Ceriaspida, Pl. 138). On the other hand\r\nthe Tessaraspida (with four crossed apophyses on each {804}spine) are also\r\npartly #Cladophracta# (the Stauraspida, Pl. 137, figs. 5-8), partly\r\n#Peltophracta# (the Lychnaspida, Pls. 135-136). The differences and\r\nrelations of these tribes are placed synoptically in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+------------------------+-----------------------\r\n                          | A.

Nevertheless they are never of perfectly the\r\nsame form; in consequence of their peculiar disposition in five zones (each\r\nwith four spines) certain slight differences are effected, so that with\r\naccurate knowledge of the peculiar shell-composition it is generally not\r\ndifficult to distinguish the spines of the equatorial, the two tropical,\r\nand the two polar zones.\r\n\r\nAlready the central bases, by which the twenty spines are united in the\r\ncentre of the sphere, exhibit certain differences in the five zones.\r\nCommonly these bases are small pyramids, all meeting with their apex in the\r\ncentre, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids are supported\r\none upon another. The four equatorial pyramids are commonly six-sided, the\r\nother sixteen five-sided; but sometimes there are eight six-sided and\r\ntwelve five-sided basal pyramids; two opposite polar spines on each pole\r\nhaving a six-sided base (like the four equatorial), the other two polar\r\nspines on each pole having a five-sided base (like the eight tropical).\r\nRarely the central bases are perfectly grown together, forming a single\r\nspherical central piece of acanthin.\r\n\r\nThe three different fundamental forms of radial spines, which are found in\r\nall ACANTHARIA, the cylindrical, the two-edged, and the four-edged (spines\r\nwith circular, with elliptical, and with square transverse section\r\nrespectively) occur also in the different groups of Dorataspida; but\r\ncommonly the two-edged or compressed form is prevalent in the Diporaspida,\r\nthe four-edged or quadrangular form in the Tessaraspida. In the majority of\r\nspecies the spines are thickened in the shell-face, where the apophyses\r\narise, and thinner towards the two ends. Usually the outer or distal part\r\nof the spine (outside the shell) is longer than the inner or proximal part\r\n(inside {805}the shell). The distal apex is commonly simple, conical or\r\npyramidal, rarely bifid or truncate. The edges of the spines are commonly\r\nsmooth, rarely denticulate or serrate.\r\n\r\nThe apophyses, or the lateral transverse processes of the radial spines, in\r\nthe Dorataspida assume the greatest variety and complexity in form, size,\r\nmode of ramification, and in composition of the shell. An expert and\r\npractised observer may determine easily the range of each spine, whether it\r\nbe an equatorial (_c_), or a tropical (_b_, _d_), or a polar spine (_a_,\r\n_e_, Pls. 133-138). The two opposite apophyses of the Diporaspida, as well\r\nas the four crossed apophyses of the Tessaraspida, lie constantly in\r\ncertain meridian planes of the spine, which have a legitimate signification\r\nfor each of the five zones. The comparative morphology of this regular\r\ndisposition of the apophyses and the regular meeting of their branches is\r\nof the greatest interest, and necessary for the complete understanding of\r\nthe complicated structure of these wonderful shells.\r\n\r\nThe pores or meshes of the spherical shell, offering the most varied forms,\r\nmay generally be divided into two different groups, into sutural and parmal\r\nmeshes. The sutural pores are bordered by the meeting branches of the\r\napophyses of two, three, or four neighbouring spines, and therefore also by\r\nthe sutures in which they meet. The parmal pores on the other hand are\r\nbordered only by the united branches of the apophyses of a single spine and\r\npierce the shield or lattice-plate formed by them. Therefore the\r\nshell-meshes of the #Cladophracta# are all sutural pores (Pl. 137, figs.\r\n1-8; rarely and only in a part of the spines parmal pores also: _Zonaspis_,\r\n_Dodecaspis_); whereas the shell-meshes of the #Peltophracta#, piercing the\r\nshields or lattice-plates of all twenty spines, are always partly sutural,\r\npartly parmal pores (Pls. 135, 136, 138). The parmal pores again may be\r\ndivided into two different groups--aspinal and coronal pores. Aspinal pores\r\n(\"ad spinam\") are those which lie immediately on the sides of the radial\r\nspine and are bordered by the primary branches of its apophyses; therefore\r\nconstantly only two in the Diporaspida, four in the Tessaraspida. Coronal\r\npores on the contrary are those which lie in the periphery of the\r\nlattice-plates, surrounding in a circle or crown the aspinal pores and not\r\ntouching the spine itself. In _Dorataspis_, _Ceriaspis_, _Tessaraspis_,\r\n_Lychnaspis_, &c., all parmal meshes are only aspinal pores (Pl. 135, figs.\r\n2-5; Pl. 136); whilst in _Coscinaspis_, _Acontaspis_, _Icosaspis_,\r\n_Hylaspis_, &c., one part of the parmal pores is aspinal, one part coronal\r\n(Pl. 136). The number, form, and size of the coronal pores is very variable\r\nand often very large (sometimes more than a hundred in one plate).\r\n\r\nThe #Cladophracta# exhibit a comparatively simple shell-formation; either\r\nall twenty spines or at least a part of them not forming lattice-plates.\r\nThe most primitive form among these is _Phractaspis_ (Pl. 137, figs. 1, 2).\r\nThe forty apophyses of its twenty spines are simply forked, and their\r\neighty fork-branches united by forty sutures, enclosing twenty-two sutural\r\nmeshes: two square polar meshes (between the four polar spines on the poles\r\nof the spineless axis, _a a a a_ and _e e e e_); eight triangular\r\n{806}circumpolar meshes (each between two polar and one tropical spine, _a\r\nb a_ and _e d e_); eight quadrangular tropical meshes (each between one\r\npolar, one equatorial, and two tropical spines, _a b c b_ and _e d c d_);\r\nand four rhomboidal equatorial meshes (between two tropical and two\r\nequatorial spines, _c b c d_). If the fork-branches be again forked\r\n(_Phractaspidium_, Pl. 137, fig. 3), the number of the sutures and sutural\r\nmeshes is doubled, and the same is the case in _Stauraspis_, the most\r\nsimple form of the Tessaraspida.\r\n\r\nA peculiar small group, and an interesting transition for the\r\n#Cladophracta# to the #Peltophracta#, is presented by the Zonaspida among\r\nthe Tessaraspida (_Zonaspis_ and _Dodecaspis_). Here only one part of the\r\nradial spines bears lattice-plates, the other part not. In _Zonaspis_ the\r\nfour equatorial spines bear lattice-plates, the sixteen other only free\r\nbranches of the apophyses. In _Dodecaspis_ twelve spines are provided with\r\nlattice-plates (four equatorial and eight polar spines), whilst the eight\r\nother (tropical) spines are devoid of them.\r\n\r\nThe #Peltophracta# exhibit a great variety in the form and composition of\r\ntheir twenty lattice-plates or fenestrated shields. In the most simple case\r\n(a part of _Dorataspis_ and _Diporaspis_) the shell is composed of four\r\n(equatorial) hexagonal plates, and sixteen pentagonal plates (four tropical\r\nand four polar); in this case the four polar plates meet on each pole in\r\none common point. More commonly, however, the shell seems to be composed of\r\neight hexagonal plates (four equatorial and the four polar spines of the\r\nhydrotomical plane) and twelve pentagonal plates (eight tropical and the\r\nfour polar spines of the geotomical plane); in this case only two\r\n(hexagonal) polar plates meet on each pole in a suture which separates the\r\ntwo other (pentagonal) polar plates (Pl. 138, fig. 4). In the majority of\r\nthe Dorataspida the composition of the shell is much more complicated and\r\noften very difficult to understand. Often the surface of the plates is\r\ncovered with a network of elevated crests, by which concave blind dimples\r\nare separated (_Ceriaspis_, _Hystrichaspis_, Pl. 138); and sometimes these\r\ndimples become pierced by coronal pores (Pl. 138, fig. 11, &c.).\r\n\r\nPeculiar by-spines or \"accessory spines\" cover the outer surface of the\r\nshell in a great part of Dorataspida, and commonly these most\r\ncharacteristic by-spines are not placed radially, but parallel to the\r\nradial spine, from the lattice-plate of which they arise (Pl. 135, figs. 1,\r\n5; Pl. 137, figs. 4-8; Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, Taf. xxi. figs. 8, 9).\r\nThey are commonly placed perpendicular to the sutural condyles, or the\r\nbranch-ends of the apophyses; so that close to each suture arises a pair of\r\ndivergent by-spines, belonging to the meeting apophyses of the two\r\nneighbouring spines, which meet in the suture (Pl. 137, fig. 4). Rarely\r\nthese thin, bristle-shaped by-spines are quite simple and straight,\r\ncommonly they undulate or are zigzag and often armed with recurved hooks.\r\nSometimes they are also forked or arborescent (Pl. 138, fig. 7).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Dorataspida is constantly spherical and about\r\none-third smaller than the enclosing shell, from which it is separated by\r\nthe spherical calymma. {807}The membrane of the central capsule is commonly\r\nrather thin, and pierced by the twenty radial spines, meeting in the centre\r\nof the capsule. Between these lie innumerable small pores for the radiating\r\npseudopodia; however, in many cases (and perhaps constantly) these pores\r\nexhibit a certain regular disposition. In many species the central capsule\r\nencloses Xanthellæ or symbiotic yellow unicellular Algæ. The nucleus\r\nbecomes cleft very early in the majority of Dorataspida.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Dorataspida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

DIPORASPIDA, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty radial spines, each of which bears\r\ntwo opposite apophyses. The spherical shell is composed either of the\r\nmeeting branches of these apophyses (Phractaspida), or of twenty perforated\r\nplates, produced by concrescence of their branches (Ceriaspida).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Tribe I. #Phractaspida#, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; the spherical shell\r\nis composed only of the meeting branches of the two opposite apophyses,\r\nwhich arise from each radial spine. Therefore the meshes of the shell are\r\nall sutural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 349. _Phractaspis_,[389] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; shell composed only\r\nof the meeting branches of the two opposite apophyses, which arise from\r\neach radial spine. Condyles of the branch-ends without by-spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Phractaspis_ is the most simple and primitive form among all\r\nDorataspida, and may be regarded as the common ancestral form either of\r\nthis whole family, or at least of its first subfamily, the Diporaspida. In\r\nall members of this subfamily the spherical shell is composed of twenty\r\nradial spines, each of which bears two opposite apophyses; but the mode of\r\ncomposition is different in the two tribes of the subfamily, in the\r\nPhractaspida and Ceriaspida. In the simpler tribe, the Phractaspida, the\r\nshell is composed only of the meeting branches of the apophyses of\r\nneighbouring spines; there are no peculiar perforated plates or shields. In\r\nthe Ceriaspida, however, both apophyses of each single spine form a\r\nperforated plate or shield by union of their branches, and the shell is\r\nformed of the meeting edges of these shields. Of course the Ceriaspida must\r\nbe derived from the simpler Phractaspida. _Phractaspis_, as the common\r\nancestral form of both, exhibits a very simple structure of the shell (Pl.\r\n137, figs. 1, 2). Commonly, if the fork-branches of each apophysis be not\r\nagain branched, the shell possesses only twenty-two large meshes and forty\r\nsutures. More rarely their number increases, the fork-branches of the\r\napophyses being again branched (_Phractaspidium_, Pl. 137, fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Phractasparium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Shell with twenty-two meshes, and forty sutures, each spine\r\nwith only four branches, its two apophyses being simply forked.\r\n\r\n\r\n{809}1. _Phractaspis prototypus_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nRadial spines cylindrical, thin, pointed; the outer and inner halves of\r\nnearly equal size. Each spine bears in its middle part two opposite\r\napophyses, which are simply forked; the four condyles of each spine (or the\r\nthickened ends of the fork-branches) are united with the meeting condyles\r\nof the neighbouring spines by sutures. Therefore the network of the\r\nspherical shell is composed of twenty-two large meshes: two square polar\r\nmeshes on each pole (_a a a a_ and _e e e e_); eight triangular circumpolar\r\nmeshes (each between two polar and one tropical spine, _a b a_ and _e d\r\ne_); eight tropical rhomboidal meshes (each between one polar, one\r\nequatorial, and two tropical spines: _a b c b_ and _e d c d_); and four\r\nrhomboidal equatorial meshes (each between two tropical and two equatorial\r\nspines _c b c d_).\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.04;\r\nbreadth of the spines and bars 0.005.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Cosmopolitan; Mediterranean (Corfu), Atlantic (Stations 348,\r\n354), Indian Ocean (Ceylon), Pacific (Stations 253, 265, 274), &c.,\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Phractaspis complanata_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 1).\r\n\r\nRadial spines leaf-shaped, strongly compressed, two-edged, pointed; their\r\nouter part longer than the inner. Each spine with two opposite apophyses\r\nwhich are simply forked, therefore with four condyles. The network with\r\nforty sutures and twenty-two large meshes, as in the foregoing species. The\r\nbroad faces of the eight polar spines lie in two meridian planes, of the\r\nfour equatorial spines in the equatorial plane, of the eight tropical\r\nspines in two planes parallel to the latter. The planes of the leaf-shaped\r\nfork-branches lie in the spherical face.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.02 to 0.03;\r\nbreadth of the fork-branches 0.012.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 343, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Phractaspis condylophora_, n. sp.\r\n\r\nRadial spines quadrangular, thin; their outer pyramidal part shorter than\r\nthe inner. Each spine with four branches, its two opposite apophyses being\r\nsimply forked. The eighty condyles (or sutural ends of the branches) much\r\nthickened, twice to four times as broad as the branches themselves. Network\r\nwith forty sutures and twenty-two large meshes, as in both foregoing\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.04;\r\nbreadth of the condyles 0.01.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Phractaspis bipennis_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  _Dorataspis bipennis_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.

Each spine with four bent branches, its two opposite\r\napophyses being simply forked. Eighty {810}condyles, very thin, pointed. In\r\nthe specimens of this remarkable species, which I first observed in\r\nMessina, two opposite equatorial spines had quite free apophyses, not\r\nconnected with the neighbouring spines; therefore the thin lattice-work of\r\nthe shell exhibited only thirty-six sutures and twenty meshes (two meshes\r\nwith six sutures, six meshes with four sutures, and twelve meshes with\r\nthree sutures). In similar specimens, which I afterwards observed in the\r\nCanary Islands, all four equatorial spines were connected in the same\r\nmanner with the neighbouring spines; therefore they possessed forty sutures\r\nand twenty-two meshes, like _Phractaspis prototypus_ (Pl. 137, fig. 2).\r\nPerhaps the Mediterranean species represents a peculiar genus,\r\n_Phractasplenium bipenne_.\r\n\r\n_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.05;\r\nbreadth of the spines 0.002.\r\n\r\n_Habitat._--Mediterranean (Messina), Canary Islands (Lanzerote), surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 2. _Phractaspidium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Shell with forty to eighty or more meshes, and eighty to one\r\nhundred or more sutures.

Therefore the\r\nmeshes of the shell are partly sutural, partly parmal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 351. _Dorataspis_,[391] Haeckel, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.\r\nd. Wiss. Berlin, p. 811.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by\r\nforty aspinal pores (two pores in each plate). Surface of the shell without\r\ncombs, dimples, and by-spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dorataspis_ opens the long series of the Ceriaspida, or of those\r\nDorataspida in which the shell is composed of twenty plates, each of which\r\nis perforated by two primary aspinal pores. This tribe has arisen from the\r\nsimpler Phractaspida by reunion of the branches of the apophyses in each\r\nsingle spine. If in _Phractaspis_, their common ancestral form  (Pl. 137,\r\nfigs. 1, 2), the neighbouring fork-branches of both opposite apophyses in\r\neach radial spine become recurved and united, they will produce a shield,\r\nwhich is perforated by two pores and between them by the spine itself.\r\nThese two \"primary aspinal pores\" are characteristic of all Ceriaspida;\r\namong these _Dorataspis_ itself is the most simple form. Its shell exhibits\r\ntherefore constantly forty aspinal pores, and besides these a variable\r\nnumber of \"sutural pores\" (in the sutures between the twenty plates). If in\r\neach suture there be only a single pore, we get on the whole fifty-two or\r\nfifty-four pores; if in each suture there be two or three pores, that\r\nnumber becomes doubled or tripled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Doratasparium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Shell with fifty-two sutures; four polar plates on each pole\r\nof the main axis meeting in one point (in the pole itself); therefore all\r\neight polar plates pentagonal and of equal size.

Condyles of the branch-ends\r\nwithout by-spines.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Stauraspis_ is the most simple and primitive form among all\r\nTessaraspida, or that subfamily of Dorataspida, in which the shell is\r\ncomposed of twenty {831}radial spines, each of which bears four crossed\r\napophyses.  The subfamily may be divided into two different tribes, the\r\nStauraspida and Lychnaspida.  In the Stauraspida either all twenty spines,\r\nor a part of them, bear no perforated plates, and the shell is composed\r\nwholly or partially of the meeting branches of their apophyses. In the\r\nLychnaspida, however, the four apophyses of each single spine form, by\r\nreunion of their recurved branches, a plate or shield with four crossed\r\naspinal pores. The Lychnaspida represent therefore a more developed stage\r\nin the shell-formation than the simpler Stauraspida. _Stauraspis_, as the\r\ncommon ancestral form of both, may be derived phylogenetically from\r\n_Xiphacantha_ or _Stauracantha_, which differ only by the apophyses or\r\nbranches of the apophyses not meeting.

The branches of the apophyses of the eight tropical spines form no\r\nlattice-plates by union. Each condyle bears a by-spine.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Dodecaspis_ differs from all other Dorataspida in the peculiar\r\ncomposition of its shell; twelve spines (four equatorial and eight polar\r\nspines) form by union of the branches of their apophyses twelve plates,\r\neach of which exhibits four crossed pores, whilst the eight other\r\n(tropical) spines form no perforated plates, but simply unite with the\r\nneighbouring spines by meeting branches. Some irregularity is often to be\r\nfound in this genus; instead of four pores in each plate there may be two\r\nclosed, the other two which are opposite being open. Several times I\r\nobserved a peculiar \"hemihedral\" variety: only six spines of one meridian\r\nplane (the two equatorial and the four polar spines of the \"hydrotomical\"\r\nplane) exhibited complete shields, whilst the branches of the other\r\nfourteen plates remained open.

In\r\n_Tessaraspis_ and _Lychnaspis_ each plate exhibits only these four primary\r\npores, whilst in _Icosaspis_ and _Hylaspis_ they become surrounded by a\r\ncircle of secondary or coronal pores. If in _Stauraspis_, the common\r\nancestral form of the Tessaraspida, the four crossed apophyses of each\r\nsingle radial spine became recurved and united together, we should have the\r\ntypical plate of _Tessaraspis_, in which the piercing radial spine is\r\nsurrounded by four crossed pores of equal size. The number of sutural\r\npores, between the neighbouring plates, is variable; usually each plate is\r\nsurrounded by a circle of eight to twelve sutural pores. The sutures\r\nbetween the meeting condyles of the apophyses usually remain open; but in\r\nsome species they become obliterated (subgenus _Tessaraspidium_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Tessarasparium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Condyles of the neighbouring plates connected by permanent\r\nopen sutures; therefore the whole shell is composed of twenty separated\r\npieces of acanthin.\r\n\r\n\r\n{836}1. _Tessaraspis arachnoides_, n. sp.

Central capsule\r\nspherical, enclosing the inner and surrounded by the outer concentric\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Phractopeltida# differs from all other ACANTHARIA in the\r\ndevelopment of a double spherical shell, composed of two concentric\r\nlattice-spheres, which are united by twenty radial spines meeting in the\r\ncommon centre. We could therefore oppose the Phractopeltida as\r\n_Diplophracta_ to all other #Acanthophracta# as _Haplophracta_ (with simple\r\nshell). The former exhibit a relation to the latter, similar to that\r\nexhibited by the Dyosphærida to the simple Monosphærida among the\r\n#Sphæroidea#.\r\n\r\nIn my Monograph (1862, p. 423) I described only one genus appertaining to\r\nthis family, _Aspidomma_. I founded it upon the singular _Phractopelta_,\r\ndescribed by {848}J. Müller as _Haliomma hystrix_. A second species of\r\n_Aspidomma_, the _Acanthometra mucronata_ of J. Müller, was probably an\r\n_Astrolonche_. At that time I placed _Aspidomma_ among the Haliommatida,\r\nled by the erroneous opinion that it might represent a transition-form\r\nbetween _Dorataspis_ and _Haliomma_. But I afterwards gave up this view, as\r\nI was convinced that there is no true phylogenetic connection between the\r\nacanthinic Dorataspida (_Actipylea_) and the siliceous Haliommatida\r\n(_Peripylea_). Therefore in my Prodromus (1881, p. 468) I placed\r\n_Aspidomma_ among the Dorataspida and changed its name to _Phractopelta_,\r\nto avoid further confusion with the unrelated Ommatida (#Sphæroidea#). It\r\nformed there, with three nearly related genera, the \"subfamily\r\nPhractopeltida,\" which we now advance to the higher rank of a separate\r\nfamily. (By a typographical mistake the words are printed in the Prodromus\r\n_Phractopelma_ and Phractopelmida, &c., instead of _Phractopelta_ and\r\nPhractopeltida, &c.). The detection of other new species appertaining to\r\nthis family, and a closer anatomical investigation of them, has now led to\r\nthe distinction of five different genera, characterised by other\r\ndifferences than were employed in 1881 in the provisional system of the\r\n\"Prodromus.\"\r\n\r\nThe two concentric spherical lattice-shells of the Phractopeltida,\r\nconnected by radial beams, correspond perfectly to those of the\r\ndouble-shelled Dyosphærida (_Haliomma_, _Diplosphæra_, &c.), and in both\r\ncases we may call the smaller inner the \"medullary shell,\" and the larger\r\nouter the \"cortical shell.\" There is no doubt that the double-shelled\r\nPhractopeltida must be derived phylogenetically from the simple-shelled\r\nDorataspida (just as we derive the double Dyosphærida from the simple\r\nMonosphærida). But it is not yet possible to decide positively which of the\r\ntwo shells is the first formed. Probably the small inner or medullary shell\r\nof the Phractopeltida is the first formed, and corresponds to the simple\r\nspherical lattice-shell of the Dorataspida; and the larger outer or\r\ncortical shell of the former is a later new formation, absent in the latter\r\nfamily. This opinion seems to be confirmed by the genus _Orophaspis_, the\r\nonly form among the Dorataspida, in which the radial spines outside the\r\nshell bear free latticed apophyses. If these twenty apophyses grow further\r\nand meet one another, the second or outer shell of _Phractopelta_ may be\r\nformed. But some objections may be raised to this opinion from the peculiar\r\nstructure and the very small size of the inner shell; and there is some\r\npossibility that this latter is a secondary later product inside of the\r\nprimary cortical shell. The probably phylogenetic series which reveals the\r\norigin of the Phractopeltida is the following:--_Acanthometron_,\r\n_Zygacantha_, _Lithophyllium_, _Phractacantha_, _Doracantha_, _Dorataspis_,\r\n_Orophaspis_, _Phractopelta_.\r\n\r\nThe twenty radial spines exhibit in all Phractopeltida the same\r\ncharacteristic position and relation as in all other Icosacantha, and are\r\nconstantly arranged according to the Müllerian law in four meridian planes,\r\ntheir distal ends falling into five parallel zones. Their distinction in\r\nthe majority of the Phractopeltida is not difficult, {849}since the spines\r\nof the different zones bear apophyses of different shapes. Sometimes the\r\nfour equatorial spines are stouter than the sixteen other spines, and often\r\nthe eight tropical spines are somewhat different in form from the eight\r\npolar and from the four equatorial spines. The length of all twenty spines\r\nis commonly equal. Their form is usually more or less compressed, two-edged\r\n(as in _Zygacantha_), more rarely cylindrical (as in _Acanthometron_), or\r\nsomewhat quadrangular (but not truly prismatic); therefore the transverse\r\nsection of the spines is commonly elliptical or lanceolate, rarely circular\r\nor rhombic, never square; this seems to indicate their origin from\r\n_Zygacantha_. As in all ACANTHARIA, the spines consist of acanthin, not of\r\nsilex. Their central ends are either perfectly grown together, and form a\r\nsingle star of acanthin, or the triangular faces of their small pyramidal\r\nbases are supported one upon another, without true concrescence.\r\n\r\nThe apophyses of the radial spines, by which the two concentric spherical\r\nshells are formed, seem to be constantly four on each spine, two being\r\nopposite in each shell. The proximal pair of opposite apophyses, forming\r\nthe inner or medullary shell, is constantly much smaller than the distal\r\npair composing the outer or cortical shell (Pl. 133, fig. 5). The proximal\r\npair corresponds probably to the two primary apophyses of the Diporaspida\r\n(_Phractaspis_, _Dorataspis_, &c.), whilst the distal pair corresponds to\r\nthe free apophyses of _Orophaspis_ (Pl. 133, fig. 6). Therefore the\r\nPhractopeltida may be derived phylogenetically from the Diporaspida (not\r\nfrom the Tessaraspida). In the common ancestral genus of this family,\r\n_Phractopelta_, the free part of the radial spines (outside the outer\r\nshell) is quite simple, without free apophyses; in all other genera of the\r\nfamily that free part of the spines (either in all twenty spines or only in\r\nsome of them) bears a third pair of lateral apophyses; these may be either\r\nsimple or branched or even latticed; but the outer apophyses (of the third\r\nrank) remain constantly free, and a third lattice-shell is never formed by\r\nunion of their edges (Pl. 133, figs. 2-4).\r\n\r\nThe inner lattice-shell of the Phractopeltida, or their \"medullary shell,\"\r\nis constantly very small (commonly 0.03 to 0.05 mm. in diameter, rarely\r\nmore). Its structure is difficult to make out; in the unbroken shell it is\r\nconcealed by the dense network of the outer shell; in the broken shell it\r\nis commonly destroyed. Usually the pores of the inner shell are very small,\r\ncircular or subcircular, scarcely as broad as the small separating bars. In\r\nthe majority of Phractopeltida their number seems to be about forty, being\r\nprobably the forty primary aspinal pores of the Diporaspida; in some\r\nspecies this number seems to be exceeded, so that perhaps some sutural\r\npores may exist between the aspinal pores; but commonly the twenty plates\r\ncomposing the inner shell (each with two aspinal pores) seems to grow\r\ntogether perfectly by their meeting edges, so that there are no sutural\r\npores between them. Evident sutures were not recognisable in the inner\r\nshell of any Phractopeltida.\r\n\r\n{850}The outer lattice-shell of the Phractopeltida, or their \"cortical\r\nshell,\" is at least twice as broad, commonly about three times as broad, as\r\nthe enclosed inner shell; it is much more varied in composition than the\r\nlatter. Like the greater part of the Dorataspida we may distinguish here in\r\nthe lattice-work two kinds of pores--parmal pores and sutural pores. The\r\nparmal pores are produced by the union of the meeting branches of the\r\napophyses of each single spine, and are therefore visible on each isolated\r\nspine; whilst the sutural pores are formed by the meeting branches of the\r\napophyses of neighbouring spines. The distinction of the parmal and the\r\nsutural pores, easy in most Dorataspida, is difficult in most\r\nPhractopeltida, because the sutures between the meeting branches are\r\nusually very early obliterated. However, the place of the obliterated\r\nsuture is often indicated by the thickened condyles of the apophyses on\r\nboth sides of the suture. Commonly also the form of the sutural pores is\r\nmuch more irregular than that of the parmal pores; the former are more or\r\nless constricted in the middle by the intumescence of the sutural condyles,\r\nwhilst the latter are more roundish, elliptical, kidney-shaped, or square.\r\nThe number of the pores in the outer shell in the typical normal form of\r\nPhractopeltida seems to be the same as in the most species of _Dorataspis_,\r\n_Diporaspis_, &c., between ninety and one hundred, viz., forty parmal pores\r\nand from fifty to sixty sutural pores. However, in many species this number\r\nis increased. Since in all Phractopeltida, each of the twenty plates is\r\ncomposed only of the meeting branches of two opposite apophyses, we find\r\noriginally in each plate only two primary parmal pores or \"aspinal pores.\"\r\nBut in some species there occur four, six, or more pores in each plate; in\r\nthis case two of them only are aspinal pores, all the others being \"coronal\r\npores.\" Moreover, in those species which exhibit on the base of each spine\r\nin the outer shell four crossed pores (Pl. 133, fig. 2), there are not four\r\nequivalent aspinal pores (as in the Tessaraspida), but the two opposite are\r\nprimary or aspinal pores and the other two (different from them in size and\r\nform) coronal pores. However, the number of coronal pores in the\r\nPhractopeltida is never so large as in many Dorataspida, and the same holds\r\ngood also for the increasing number of the irregular sutural pores. In none\r\nof the species observed does the total number of the pores in the outer\r\nshell reach two hundred.\r\n\r\nThe original mode of development of the apophyses composing the outer shell\r\nseems to be imitated by the free apophyses of the third order, which are\r\ndeveloped from the radial spines outside the outer shell in all\r\nPhractopeltida, with the single exception of the simple ancestral genus\r\n_Phractopelta_. These apophyses of the third rank are also originally\r\nconstantly two, opposite to one another (after the type of _Lithophyllium_,\r\n_Dorataspis_, &c.). Commonly they do not remain simple, but become\r\nbranched, and by communication of the neighbouring branches small\r\nlattice-plates arise. Originally each of these free lattice-plates has only\r\ntwo parmal pores, but the number of the parmal pores increases afterwards,\r\nso that we  may distinguish two (primary) {851}aspinal pores, and two,\r\nfour, or more (secondary) coronal pores. In the majority of species the two\r\nopposite apophyses are first crossed at right angles by a transverse beam,\r\nand the two parallel transverse beams are again crossed by perpendicular\r\ntertiary branches (again parallel to the apophyses). In this case the\r\nnetwork of the free lattice-plates becomes more or less rectangular. But in\r\nother species the ramification of the apophyses assumes more the form of\r\nbifurcation or of irregular branching. As already said, the neighbouring\r\nfree lattice-plates of this third order never meet, and therefore a\r\ncomplete third shell is never formed.\r\n\r\nThe different genera of Phractopeltida exhibit very remarkable differences\r\nin the development of free apophyses (or lattice-plates of the third\r\norder). Whilst in the numerous species of the ancestral genus\r\n_Phractopelta_ all twenty spines remain simple, without such apophyses,\r\nonly in a single observed species (representing the genus _Pantopelta_)\r\nwere all twenty spines protected by them. In the three other genera only\r\none part of the spines bears free apophyses, but not the other part. The\r\nmost frequent form is _Dorypelta_ (Pl. 133, fig. 2); here eight spines are\r\nsimple (four equatorial and four polar spines of the hydrotomical plane),\r\nwhilst twelve spines bear apophyses (eight tropical and four polar spines\r\nof the geotomical plane). In _Octopelta_ the eight tropical spines only\r\nbear apophyses, whilst the twelve other (four equatorial and eight polar)\r\nare simple. In _Stauropelta_ finally the four equatorial spines only are\r\nsimple, whilst the sixteen other bear free apophyses (eight tropical and\r\neight polar spines).\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Phractopeltida is constantly spherical, and\r\nenclosed between the two concentric spherical shells; it is therefore\r\nlarger than the inner and smaller than the outer shell. Its wall is pierced\r\nby the twenty radial beams connecting the two shells. The shape of the\r\ncentral capsule and of the enveloping calymma is the same as in the other\r\n#Acanthophracta# and specially in the Dorataspida.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Phractopeltida._\r\n\r\n                           {All twenty spines without\r\n                           {  apophyses in the free\r\n  All twenty spines of the {  external part,           366. _Phractopelta_.\r\n    same form,             {\r\n                           {All twenty spines with\r\n                           {  apophyses in the free\r\n                           {  part,                    367. _Pantopelta_.\r\n\r\n                           {Eight tropical spines with\r\n                           {  apophyses, twelve others\r\n                           {  (eight polar and four\r\n                           {  equatorial) simple,      368. _Octopelta_.\r\n                           {\r\n                           {Twelve radial spines\r\n  Twenty radial spines,    {  (eight tropical and four\r\n    partly without, partly {  polar) with apophyses,\r\n    with apophyses in the  {  eight others (four polar\r\n    free external part,    {  and four equatorial)\r\n                           {  simple,                  369. _Dorypelta_.\r\n                           {\r\n                           {Sixteen radial spines\r\n                           {  (eight tropical and\r\n                           {  eight polar) with\r\n                           {  apophyses, four\r\n                           {  equatorial, simple,      370. _Stauropelta_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{852}Genus 366. _Phractopelta_,[406] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Phractopeltida# with twenty simple radial spines, bearing\r\nno free apophyses outside the outer shell.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Phractopelta_ is the most simple form among the Phractopeltida,\r\nand may be regarded as the common ancestral form of this family.

(Pl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8,\r\n9).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a simple ellipsoidal lattice-shell, composed\r\nof the branched apophyses of twenty radial spines meeting in its centre and\r\ndisposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha. Two opposite\r\nequatorial spines larger than the two others. Central capsule ellipsoidal,\r\nenclosed in the fenestrated shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Belonaspida#, formerly united by me with the Dorataspida (in\r\nthe Prodromus, 1881, p. 468), differs from it in the ellipsoidal form of\r\nthe lattice-shell and {860}the enclosed central capsule. In the spherical\r\nDorataspida, their ancestral family, all twenty radial spines are of equal\r\nsize, whilst here in the Belonaspida two opposite spines are larger than\r\nthe eighteen others. These two larger or principal spines are both\r\nequatorial spines, placed in the longitudinal or major axis of the\r\nellipsoid, or the \"hydrotomical axis\" (compare above, p. 719). The two\r\nother equatorial spines are constantly smaller, and lie in the transverse\r\nor minor axis of the ellipsoid, or the \"geotomical axis.\" The geometrical\r\nproportion of these two determining axes of the ellipsoidal shell is very\r\nvariable (even in one and the same species), commonly 4 : 3 or 3 : 2,\r\nrarely 2 : 1, often only 5 : 4 or 6 : 5. All meridian planes, passing\r\nthrough the principal spines (or the longitudinal axis of the shell) are\r\nelliptical, and of equal size. All transverse planes, perpendicular to that\r\naxis, are circular; the largest of these circular parallel planes is the\r\ngeotomical plane, which passes through the smaller equatorial spines and\r\nthe spineless axis.\r\n\r\nIn the spherical Dorataspida the internal length of the radial spines (or\r\nthe distance between the shell and the centre) is equal in all twenty\r\nspines. In the ellipsoidal Belonaspida this internal length is different,\r\nand commonly exhibits four different degrees; in the two principal spines\r\nit is of first rank, in the eight tropical spines of second rank, in the\r\nfour (hydrotomical) polar spines of third rank, and in the six spines (four\r\ngeotomical polar spines and two transverse equatorial spines) of fourth\r\nrank. These differences of the internal length become more important the\r\nmore the hydrotomical axis is prolonged. Regarding all other qualities (in\r\nform, disposition, and mode of junction at the centre) the ellipsoidal\r\nBelonaspida do not differ from their ancestral group, the spherical\r\nDorataspida (compare above, p. 802). In both families the pyramidal central\r\nbases of the twenty spines are commonly supported one upon another with\r\ntheir triangular neighbouring faces; but sometimes also here (particularly\r\nin _Phatnaspis_) the central bases are perfectly grown together. In this\r\ncase also the sutures of the meeting branches of the apophyses are\r\nobliterated, whilst usually they remain open. Such forms, with spines and\r\nplates perfectly grown together, form a single piece of acanthin, and were\r\nformerly separated by me as a peculiar genus _Haliommatidium_ (Monogr. d.\r\nRadiol., 1862, p. 419). But as I now find this concrescence to be an\r\naccidental and inconstant peculiarity of some species, it no longer seems\r\nto me to be of generic importance.\r\n\r\nThe apophyses of the twenty radial spines, the branches of which compose\r\nthe ellipsoidal lattice-shell, exhibit in all Belonaspida the same\r\nappearance as in the Diporaspida (and especially the Ceriaspida) among the\r\nspherical Dorataspida. Everywhere each radial spine gives off only two\r\nopposite primary apophyses, the fork-branches of which unite together and\r\nform a plate or shield with two aspinal pores (as in _Dorataspis_).\r\nCommonly the shell exhibits only these forty parmal pores, the other meshes\r\nbetween them being sutural pores. Only in one genus, _Phatnaspis_ (Pl. 136,\r\n{861}figs. 6-9), is this number multiplied; the two opposite primary\r\napophyses are here crossed by numerous perpendicular lateral branches, and\r\nthese are again united by secondary perpendicular ramules which are\r\nparallel to the apophyses themselves; therefore each plate here forms a\r\nrhombic shield pierced by very numerous (often more than one hundred) small\r\nquadrangular or circular pores. Only two of these numerous parmal pores are\r\nthe primary aspinal pores (sometimes, as in Pl. 136, fig. 8, distinguished\r\nby their larger size); all others are secondary or coronal pores. Therefore\r\n_Phatnaspis_ repeats the characteristic formation of _Coscinaspis_, from\r\nwhich it differs in its ellipsoidal shell.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the four other genera of the ellipsoidal Belonaspida correspond\r\nperfectly to certain genera of the spherical Dorataspida, and may be\r\nderived from these by hypertrophy or stronger development of two opposite\r\nequatorial spines. In _Thoracaspis_ and _Belonaspis_ (Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9)\r\nthe surface of the shell-plates is without crests and dimples (in the\r\nformer without, in the latter with accessory by-spines); they thus\r\ncorrespond to _Dorataspis_ and _Diporaspis_ among the Dorataspida. In two\r\nother genera the surface of the shell-plates bears a network of elevated\r\ncrests, separating funnel-shaped dimples, in _Dictyaspis_ without, in\r\n_Coleaspis_ with by-spines; these correspond to _Ceriaspis_ and\r\n_Hystrichaspis_ among the Dorataspida. The small by-spines, covering the\r\nsurface, exhibit the same forms as in the Dorataspida; but they are usually\r\nsmaller, and less developed in the Belonaspida.\r\n\r\nThe twenty radial spines are commonly more or less compressed or two-edged,\r\nsometimes very flat, broad, and triangular (Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9). In some\r\nspecies (mainly of _Phatnaspis_) they are very long, thin, and\r\nneedle-shaped (Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, Taf. xxii. figs. 10-12). Rarely\r\nthey are cylindrical, four-edged, or prismatic. The Belonaspida testify by\r\nthis and other peculiarities to their near relation to the Diporaspida and\r\nPhractacanthida and their older origin from _Zygacantha_.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ is in the Belonaspida ellipsoidal, and more or less\r\nprolonged in the hydrotomical or longitudinal axis of the shell. It is\r\nconstantly smaller than the enveloping ellipsoidal shell, and separated\r\nfrom it by the calymma. Its structure and the shape of its nucleus are the\r\nsame as in the nearly allied Dorataspida.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Belonaspida._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  I.

The number of these parmal pores amounts in each\r\nplate to from ten to twenty, often one hundred and twenty or more;\r\ntherefore the number of parmal pores in the whole shell amounts to two\r\nthousand or more. Sometimes the pores are circular, but in this case too\r\nthey are surrounded by quadrangular frames. The quadrangles are sometimes\r\nquite regular squares, sometimes more or less irregular. The thin and\r\nfragile bars between the quadrangular pores form in each plate two peculiar\r\nsystems of parallel crests, which cross at right angles. Commonly the\r\nparallel crests of one system (parallel to the major diameter of the\r\ncompressed radial spines) are equidistant, and pierce from one edge of the\r\nplate to the opposite, whilst the parallel crests of the other system\r\n(parallel to the minor diameter of the spines) are interrupted and at\r\ndifferent distances (Pl. 136, fig. 9); but in other species both crossed\r\nsystems are quite regular. In each plate there is one primary diagonal rib\r\n(often stronger than the parallel crests) which connects the two opposite\r\ncorners of the rhomboidal plate. We can distinguish in this genus three\r\ndifferent subgenera: A. in _Phatnasparium_ the primary diagonal rib arises\r\nfrom both flat sides of the compressed sword-like, radial spines; B. in\r\n_Phatnasplenium_ from both sharp edges of them; C. in _Phatnaspidium_ two\r\ncrossed diagonal ribs arise from four edges of the spines (combination of A\r\nand B). Therefore in the first subgenus (A) two primary aspinal pores are\r\nplaced opposite on the sharp edges of the spines, but in the second (B)\r\ninversely on their flat sides; in the third (C) there are apparently four\r\nprimary aspinal pores, which are probably derived from B or A by division\r\nof the two pores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus 1. _Phatnasparium_, Haeckel.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--In the centre of each rhomboidal plate two primary aspinal\r\npores, opposite on both edges of the compressed spines, from both flat\r\nsides of which the primary diagonal crest arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n{869}1. _Phatnaspis lacunaria_, n. sp.

(Pl. 139).\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a simple discoidal or lenticular\r\nlattice-shell, composed of the branched apophyses of twenty radial spines\r\nmeeting in the centre and disposed according to the Müllerian law of\r\nIcosacantha. Six larger spines in the hydrotomical plane, prominent on the\r\nmargin of the circular or elliptical biconvex lens. Fourteen other spines\r\nmuch smaller or rudimentary. Central capsule biconvex lenticular, enclosed\r\nin the fenestrated shell.\r\n\r\nThe family #Hexalaspida# represents a new small, but very interesting group\r\nof Acanthophracta, which differs from all others in the lentelliptical or\r\ntriaxial form of the lenticular lattice-shell, the margin of which bears\r\nsix larger spines placed in the hydrotomical plane (compare above, p. 719).\r\nThey may therefore be characterised shortly as \"_Acanthophracta\r\nlentelliptica_,\" with three different dimensive axes and six larger\r\nmarginal spines. A closer comparison with the other ACANTHARIA leaves no\r\ndoubt that the Hexalaspida must be derived from the Belonaspida by stronger\r\ndevelopment of six radial spines placed in the hydrotomical plane, namely,\r\ntwo equatorial and four associated polar spines; whilst the six spines of\r\nthe geotomical plane (perpendicular to the former) are much smaller; the\r\neight tropical spines are intermediate in size between the former and the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe geometrical fundamental form of the Hexalaspida (of the central capsule\r\nas well as of the enclosing shell) is therefore lentelliptical, with three\r\ndifferent dimensive axes, and they exhibit among the ACANTHARIA a relation\r\nto the spherical Dorataspida and the ellipsoidal Belonaspida similar to\r\nthat which the lentelliptical #Larcoidea# exhibit to the spherical\r\n#Sphæroidea# and the ellipsoidal #Prunoidea# among the #Sphærellaria#\r\n(compare above, p. 599). The largest of the three dimensive axes (which are\r\nperpendicular to one another) is here the hydrotomical axis, the shortest,\r\non the contrary, the geotomical axis; the intermediate in size being the\r\nspineless axis. The development of the whole body is strongest in the\r\nhydrotomical meridian plane, in which the six principal spines are placed;\r\nit is weakest in the geotomical plane, in which the six smallest spines are\r\nplaced; the eight tropical spines are intermediate in size between the\r\nothers. This peculiar development is illustrated by the figures of Pl. 139,\r\nwhere the four equatorial spines are everywhere marked by _c_, the eight\r\ntropical spines by _b_ and _d_, the eight polar spines by _a_ and _e_.\r\n\r\n{873}Rarely the six hydrotomical or principal spines are of equal size, and\r\nthus the margin of the shell may be quite circular or regularly hexagonal\r\n(Pl. 139, figs. 1-3); the two equatorial spines of the hydrotomical plane\r\nare usually larger than its four polar spines, and thus the margin of the\r\nshell becomes more or less elliptical (Pl. 139, figs. 4-7). Usually (almost\r\nconstantly) these six larger spines are more or less compressed,\r\ntriangular, often very broad and flat; their two edges lie in the\r\nhydrotomical plane. Their two flat surfaces are often furrowed, with\r\nlongitudinal ribs or crests converging towards the simple apex of the\r\nspines.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen smaller spines are regularly disposed according to the\r\nMüllerian law of Icosacantha on both convex sides of the lenticular shell;\r\nthey are not only smaller than the six principal spines, but often also of\r\ndifferent form, much thinner and shorter, sometimes needle-shaped. In the\r\ngenera _Hexonaspis_ and _Hexacolpus_ (Pl. 139, figs. 1, 2) only their inner\r\npart (inside of the shell) is developed, whilst their outer part is quite\r\nrudimentary and not prominent on the surface. Therefore these genera appear\r\nto possess only six marginal spines externally.\r\n\r\n_The Lenticular Shell_ itself offers in the Hexalaspida great difficulties\r\nin the way of accurate study, as its wall is constantly very thick and\r\ndark, often quite opaque and non-transparent. However, prolonged accurate\r\nresearches have convinced me that its structure is essentially the same as\r\nin the Belonaspida and especially in the genera _Dictyaspis_ and\r\n_Coleaspis_. As in these latter the twenty plates of the shell bear high\r\ncrests or combs on the outer surface, and by these funnel-shaped dimples\r\nare separated. The network of these crests is more or less regular (Pl.\r\n139, figs. 1-7). Around the base of each radial spine the shell is usually\r\nelevated in the form of a conical or cylindrical sheath; the crests are\r\nprolonged into the sheaths as longitudinal ribs, parallel to the spine or\r\nconvergent towards its apex. Whilst in _Hexalaspis_ and _Hexonaspis_ these\r\nbasal sheaths are not at all or but little prominent (Pl. 139, fig. 2; Pl.\r\n140, fig. 16), in _Hexaconus_ and _Hexacolpus_ they envelop the basal half\r\n(or even more) of the spines, and very often the circular or elliptical\r\nfree distal edge of the sheath is elegantly denticulated or serrated  (Pl.\r\n139, figs. 1, 3-7; pl. 140, figs. 9-16).\r\n\r\n_The Pores_ of the shell exhibit in the Hexalaspida the same shape as in\r\nthe majority of the Belonaspida. Each spine bears only two broad opposite\r\napophyses, the fork-branches of which unite to form a polygonal shield with\r\ntwo pores. The number of parmal pores is constantly (?) forty, as each\r\nplate possesses only two primary aspinal pores; there are no secondary or\r\ncoronal pores. The numerous (between fifty and one hundred, rarely more)\r\nsmaller pores between the forty parmal pores are probably always sutural\r\npores; however, their number and position is very difficult to determine,\r\non account of the high protecting crests; the majority of the funnel-shaped\r\ndimples between the latter seem to be blind, not perforated. Sometimes all\r\nthe dimples, except the twenty spinal ones, seem to be blind and the\r\nsutural pores appear {874}to have disappeared completely, so that there\r\nremain only twenty aspinal pores (Pl. 139, fig. 4).\r\n\r\nThe internal cavity of the shell in all Hexalaspida is very small, on\r\naccount of the thickness of the massive wall; the latter is often greater\r\nthan the diameter of the cavity. Setting aside this disproportion, the\r\nspace of the cavity is further much reduced by the internal parts of the\r\nthick radial spines, which are united in the centre by their pyramidal\r\nbases (Pl. 140, fig. 15). Usually the twenty bases seem to remain free\r\n(supported one upon another by means of their triangular faces); but\r\nsometimes they seem to grow together perfectly and to form a single central\r\nstar of acanthin. In some species, too, the sutures of the meeting branches\r\nof the apophyses of neighbouring spines seem to grow together, so that the\r\nwhole shell exhibits a single piece of acanthin.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_ of the Hexalaspida is therefore very small and seems\r\nto fill up the greatest part of the shell-cavity. Its form is constantly\r\nmore or less lenticular, sometimes lentelliptical. On account of the\r\nopacity of the shell I could not make out its shape more closely.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Hexalaspida._\r\n\r\n  All twenty spines externally } Sheaths of the spines\r\n    developed, prominent on    }   not prominent,        376. _Hexalaspis_.\r\n    the surface of the         }\r\n    lenticular shell.          } Sheaths of the spines\r\n                               }   prominent,            377. _Hexaconus_.\r\n\r\n  Only six spines (the         }\r\n    hydrotomical spines)       } Sheaths of the spines\r\n    externally developed and   }   not prominent,        378. _Hexonaspis_.\r\n    prominent on the margin    }\r\n    of the disk; the other     } Sheaths of the spines\r\n    fourteen spines not        }   prominent,            379. _Hexacolpus_.\r\n    prominent.                 }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 376. _Hexalaspis_,[416] n. gen.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--#Hexalaspida# with twenty prominent radial spines, which are\r\nnot surrounded by prominent sheaths; the six hydrotomical spines much\r\nlarger than the fourteen others.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Hexalaspis_ is the simplest form among the Hexalaspida, and may\r\nbe derived directly from _Dictyaspis_ among the Belonaspida, by stronger\r\ndevelopment of the six hydrotomical spines.

Radiol., p.404.\r\n\r\n_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple diploconical shell, composed of two\r\nvery large equatorial spines which are opposite in the hydrotomical axis,\r\nare surrounded by conical or cylindrical, often compressed sheaths, and\r\narise from a small central {882}lattice-shell. Eighteen other spines\r\n(disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha) much smaller,\r\noften rudimentary. Central capsule ellipsoidal or diploconical.\r\n\r\nThe family #Diploconida#, founded by me in 1862 for a single Mediterranean\r\nspecies (_Diploconus fasces_), appears to be the most aberrant and strange\r\nform among the ACANTHARIA. As I had met with only a single specimen, very\r\ndark and intransparent in its central part, my observations on its\r\nstructure were imperfect and the explanation of it partly erroneous\r\n(compare my Monograph, pp. 46, 404, Taf. xx. figs. 7, 8). However, I\r\nregarded _Diploconus_ as the representative of quite a peculiar family,\r\nderived from the Acanthometrida, and I correctly compared the large\r\nopposite radial spines of one equatorial axis with the corresponding parts\r\nin _Amphilonche_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Richard Hertwig observed some specimens of _Diploconus fasces_\r\nin the same locality (Messina), and gave an accurate description of its\r\ncentral capsule, including numerous small nuclei (1879, Organismus d.\r\nRadiol., p. 28, Taf. ii. fig. 3). He found also that the peculiar\r\ndiploconical skeleton is not composed of silex, but of acanthin. In the\r\nexplanation of the shell-structure he adopted my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the rich collections of the Challenger I detected ten different forms of\r\nDiploconida, all very rare, and for the most part represented only by\r\nsingle specimens. A twelfth species was found by me in the collection of\r\nCaptain Rabbe from the Indian Ocean. By the study of these new forms, and\r\nparticularly by their comparison with the most nearly allied Hexalaspida\r\nand Belonaspida, it was possible for me to correct some errors in my former\r\ndescription and to give a much more correct description and natural\r\nexplanation of this very peculiar and strange family of Radiolaria (compare\r\nPl. 140).\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic and the most voluminous part of the acanthinic\r\nskeleton in all Diploconida appears as the diploconical or nearly\r\ncylindrical solid \"mantle\" giving them their name and odd appearance (Pl.\r\n140). Usually this mantle is broader on its two opposite terminal openings\r\nthan in its more or less constricted middle part. This latter is now more\r\nspherical or ellipsoidal, now more lenticular, and usually separated from\r\nthe two cones by two slight transverse strictures. On the surface of this\r\nmiddle part twelve to eighteen radial spines, which in _Diplocolpus_ are\r\nrudimentary or absent, are visible in _Diploconus_. The longitudinal axis\r\nof this shell is constantly occupied by a very large pair of opposite stout\r\nprismatic or cylindrical principal spines, which are united in the centre\r\nand usually more or less prominent with their distal apex over the two\r\nopenings of the double cone.\r\n\r\nIn my first communication on the _Diploconus_ (1862, _loc. cit._) I\r\ncorrectly compared these two large spines in the prolonged main axis of the\r\nshell to the principal equatorial spines of _Amphilonche_ (or to the\r\n\"hydrotomical spines,\" _c_1, _c_3); but my explanation of the two peculiar\r\ncones enveloping them was erroneous. I supposed at that time that they were\r\nformed by the eight flattened and leaf-shaped curved {883}tropical spines,\r\nso that around each principal spine the four neighbouring tropical spines\r\n(two of the northern and two of the southern hemisphere) had grow together\r\nby their edges and formed the peculiar conical sheath. I can now say that\r\nthis opinion (afterwards adopted also by Hertwig) was quite erroneous, the\r\ntwo conical or funnel-shaped sheaths being the enlarged basal sheaths of\r\nthe two hydrotomical spines, which we have already seen in the Hexalaspida\r\n(Pl. 139). But whilst in these latter all six principal spines of the\r\nhydrotomical meridian plane are hypertrophied (two equatorial and four\r\npolar spines), in the nearly allied Diploconida only the two opposite\r\nequatorial spines are developed, whilst all other eighteen spines are more\r\nor less atrophied or quite rudimentary. In _Diploconus_ the latter are more\r\nor less evident, whilst in _Diplocolpus_ they disappear externally.\r\n\r\nThe true lattice-shell of the #Acanthophracta# (constantly composed of the\r\nmeeting apophyses of twenty radial spines) is therefore represented in the\r\nDiploconida by the small roundish middle part of the whole shell, which is\r\nusually much smaller than the two opposite cones, and separated from them\r\nby the two slight transverse strictures. Usually this small but most\r\nimportant middle part of the shell is very dark and opaque, on account of\r\nits very thick wall and small pores; but in some species it is clear enough\r\nto ascertain that the structure of this lattice-shell is the same as in the\r\nlenticular Hexalaspida, there being a network of thick crests on the outer\r\nsurface and small pores in the dimples between them. Indeed, in many (and\r\nprobably in all) Diploconida the forty aspinal pores are present which we\r\nfound in all Hexalaspida, Belonaspida, and Diporaspida, so that these four\r\nfamilies of #Acanthophracta# represent one continuous phylogenetical\r\nseries; _Phractaspis_ among the Diporaspida is at the beginning, and\r\n_Diplocolpus_ among the Diploconida at the end of this remarkably\r\ntransformed morphological series.\r\n\r\nThe twenty radial spines in all Diploconida are probably united very firmly\r\n(or even perfectly grown together) in the centre of the small thick-walled\r\nlattice-shell, the inner space of which is extremely reduced. Probably,\r\ntoo, the sutures between the meeting apophyses of the thick radial spines\r\nare often (or even constantly) obliterated by concrescence, so that the\r\nwhole shell forms a single piece of acanthin. But I regret that I cannot\r\nascertain these and other points in the structure of the shell, as the\r\nsmall number of specimens observed did not permit an anatomical examination\r\nto be made. I have no doubt, however, that the structure of the whole of\r\nthe middle main part of the shell is quite the same as in the lenticular\r\nshell of the thick-walled Hexalaspida, and that in both families each of\r\nthe twenty radial spines bears originally only two opposite apophyses.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic mantle of the double cone of the Diploconida, or the\r\nbasal sheath of their two large, perfectly developed principal spines is\r\nusually much larger than the shell itself, and more or less compressed from\r\nboth poles of the shortened geotomical axis. Therefore the transverse\r\nsection of the two cones is usually elliptical, more {884}rarely circular.\r\nTheir widest part is generally the distal opening; more rarely this is a\r\nlittle constricted. The thin transparent lamella of acanthin, representing\r\nthe mantle of the double cone, is commonly ribbed or furrowed by\r\nlongitudinal, parallel or divergent crests, and elegantly denticulated on\r\nthe edge of the distal opening.\r\n\r\nThe two conical or cylindrical halves of the mantle are connected with the\r\ntwo enclosed principal spines not only at the base, where they arise from\r\nthe small central lattice-shell, but also throughout a certain part of\r\ntheir length, by means of two, four, or six wings or leaves, which lie\r\nopposite and in pairs in the meridian planes of those spines. These\r\nmeridian wings are more or less triangular (with broader concave outer\r\nbases), and connected by their axial edge with the spine and by their\r\nperipheral edge with the mantle. They separate two, four, or six conical\r\nspaces or pyramidal compartments in each cone. But these aspinal\r\ncompartments and the separating septa are not new productions of the\r\nDiploconida, but are inherited from their ancestral family, the Hexalaspida\r\n(compare above, p. 873).\r\n\r\nThe eighteen smaller spines in _Diploconus_ are either of nearly equal size\r\nor more or less differentiated. The eight tropical spines are often much\r\nlarger than the eight polar spines. The two geotomical spines, (or the two\r\nopposite equatorial spines of the shortened geotomical axis) are often\r\nquite rudimentary. In _Diplocolpus_ the external part (outside the shell)\r\nis in all eighteen smaller spines rudimentary or atrophied.\r\n\r\n_The Central Capsule_, as shown by Hertwig, contains numerous small nuclei,\r\nand is divided into three parts by the above named two transverse\r\nstrictures; the smaller central part (in the original lenticular\r\nlattice-shell) and the two opposite larger parts, filling up the greater\r\npart of the two conical or cylindrical sheaths, and more or less adopting\r\ntheir form. Corresponding to the shell itself the enclosed capsule is often\r\nmore or less flattened, being compressed at both poles of the geotomical\r\naxis. The pseudopodia seem to proceed only from the two large polar\r\napertures of the sheaths, and form therefore two opposite conical tufts or\r\nbunches.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Genera of Diploconida._\r\n\r\n  All twenty spines more or less developed (sometimes\r\n    eight of them rudimentary),                         380. _Diploconus_.\r\n\r\n  Only the two hydrotomical spines developed (all the\r\n    eighteen others rudimentary),                       381. _Diplocolpus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus 380. _Diploconus_,[420] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d.
