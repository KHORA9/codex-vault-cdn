I have endeavoured\r\nto show how far its application is safe, and in what respect it is\r\nentitled to public approbation and national encouragement.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper, before concluding, to inform the reader, that my\r\nqualifications for the task I have undertaken are founded upon many\r\nyears experience, during which time, I possessed peculiar opportunities\r\nto witness and verify the most extended series of operations that ever\r\nhave been made for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability,\r\nsafety, and general nature of the art of applying coal-gas as a\r\nsubstitute for tallow and oil; and which have, as it were, fixed the\r\nfate of this art. The numerous experiments I instituted, upon a large\r\nscale, by desire of the Gas-Light Company, for the purpose of adducing\r\nthem in my evidence before the House of Commons, and House of Lords, on\r\na former occasion, have enabled me to collect such information as could\r\nnot have been obtained by other means. The substance of these results\r\n(which are printed by order of Government,) are incorporated in this\r\nTreatise, together with such other facts and observations as have\r\npresented themselves in the routine of my profession elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo generalize the results of my observations, and to make them\r\npractically useful to the public, is the aim of the present publication,\r\nand I need scarcely add, that their suffrages to the zeal and industry,\r\nat least, with which I have endeavoured to attain my object, will be a\r\nsource of infinite satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  FREDRICK ACCUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATION.

TREATISE\r\n  ON\r\n  GAS-LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE PROGRESS OF THE ARTS UPON THE MORALS AND CONDITION OF\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\nIt is an undoubted truth, that the successive improvements in the\r\ncondition of man, from a state of ignorance and barbarism, to that of\r\nthe highest cultivation and refinement, are usually effected by the aid\r\nof machinery and expedients, calculated to procure the necessaries, the\r\ncomforts, and the elegancies of life; and that the pre-eminence of any\r\npeople in civilization is, and ought ever to be, estimated by the\r\nproportional state of industry, and useful labour existing among them.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this great and striking truth, no other argument requires to\r\nbe offered, than an immediate reference to the experience of all ages\r\nand places: the various nations of the earth, the provinces of each\r\nnation, the towns, and even the villages of the same province, differ\r\nfrom each other in their accommodations; and are in every respect more\r\nflourishing, the greater their activity in establishing new channels of\r\nuseful employ, calculated to procure the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife. Hence the nations which have shewn the most ingenuity in this way,\r\nare not only the richest, but also the most populous and the best\r\ndefended: the provinces of those nations, are seen to flourish likewise\r\nin proportion to their respective degrees of activity in this respect,\r\nAnd from these exertions it is, as SMITH[1] emphatically remarks, that\r\n“the accommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed\r\nthat of an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the\r\nlatter exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute master of the\r\nlives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.”\r\n\r\n  [1] Wealth of Nations, chap. 1.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange notion of Rousseau to maintain that mankind were\r\nhappier when they resembled wild beasts, than with all the expanded\r\nknowledge of civilized life; and that the cultivation of their\r\nunderstanding had tended to degenerate their virtues. There can be no\r\nvirtue but what is founded on a comprehensive estimate of the effects of\r\nhuman actions, and an animal under the guidance of instinct can form no\r\nsuch estimate.\r\n\r\nThe variety of production, of wants, and fabrication of a civilized\r\nsociety, has given rise to barter or exchange; mutual supply has\r\nincreased the sub-division of labour, and improved the means of\r\nconveyance. Streams, roads, ships, and carriages have extended their\r\nbeneficial intercourse; confidence between man and man has advanced the\r\nmoral principles of society, and afforded a progression, of which the\r\npast gradation may indeed be traced, but to the future part of which\r\nthe imagination can scarcely form a probable outline. And as the moral\r\nand physical powers of man expand, new resources and new agencies are\r\nmade subservient to our commands, which, in an earlier state of society,\r\nwould have appeared altogether visionary.\r\n\r\nWho among the ancients would have listened to the extraordinary scheme\r\nof writing books with such rapidity, that one man, by this new art,\r\nshould perform the work of twenty thousand amanuenses? What philosopher\r\nwould have given credit to the daring project of navigating the widest\r\nocean?--or imagined the astonishing effect of gun-powder--or the\r\nextended application of the steam engine? What mortal would have dared\r\nto dive to the bottom of the sea--or to soar aloft into the air--or bid\r\ndefiance to the thunder of the clouds? Discoveries which have changed,\r\nas it were, the course of human affairs, and the effects of which have\r\nalready carried the intellectual operations of the human mind, to a\r\nheight they could by no other means have attained. The men of those\r\nearly ages, in the confidence of their own wisdom, might have derided\r\nthese discoveries as impossible, or rejected them as visionary; but to\r\nthose, who enjoy the full effects of such, and numerous other successful\r\ninventions, it becomes a duty to reason upon different principles, and\r\nto exert all means in their power to give effect to the progress of\r\nuseful knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe artificial production and supply of light during the absence of the\r\nsun, unquestionably holds a distinguished rank among the most important\r\narts of civilized life.\r\n\r\nIf we could for a moment suppose the privation of artificial light, it\r\nwould follow as an immediate consequence that the greatest part of the\r\nglobe on which we dwell, would cease to be the habitation of man.\r\nWhether he could ensnare or overtake those animals upon whose unprepared\r\nremains he would then be compelled to feed--whether he might store the\r\nfruits of the earth for his winter supply--what might be the physical\r\nand moral consequences of a state of such desolation, may perhaps be\r\nconjectured; but no estimate can show its dreadful magnitude. How much\r\ndo our comforts, and how greatly does the extent of our powers, in the\r\ncommon affairs of life, depend upon the production and supply of\r\nartificial light. The flame of a single candle animates a family, every\r\none follows his occupation, and no dread is felt of the darkness of\r\nnight. It might be a curious speculation to enquire how far, and in what\r\nrespects, the morals of men would become degraded by the want of this\r\ncontrivance. But it is sufficient on the present occasion, that,\r\nprevious to entering upon a dissertation respecting a new art of\r\nillumination, a train of ideas has slightly been hinted at, which cannot\r\nfail to show its magnitude and importance. The methods of procuring and\r\ndistributing light, during the absence of the sun, have not hitherto\r\nattained the extent of their possible perfection: there is yet a wide\r\nfield for improvement in the construction of the instruments of\r\nillumination, and the subject is highly deserving the attention of every\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of lighting houses, streets, and manufactories, by means of\r\nthe inflammable gas, obtainable by distillation from common pit-coal,\r\nprofesses to increase the wealth of the nation, by adding to the number\r\nof its internal resources, and on this ground it is entitled, at least,\r\nto a candid examination.\r\n\r\nThe apparent slight that has been thrown upon this new breach of civil\r\neconomy by some individuals, who appear to be incapable of judging of\r\nits nature, has contributed to deter sensible and well disposed persons\r\nfrom wishing it success. It is the more necessary to state this fact,\r\nbecause, when a mistaken notion once becomes diffused, concerning the\r\nnature of a new project, persons of the best intention are liable to\r\nbecome affected with wrong impressions on their mind. I am neither a\r\nshare holder, nor a governor, nor am I directly or indirectly concerned\r\nin any gas-light association.\r\n\r\nThe object of the succeeding pages, simply is to rescue the art of\r\nillumination with coal-gas from misconception and misrepresentation, and\r\nby a fair, and not overcharged statement of its merits and its\r\ndisadvantages, to appeal from prejudice and ignorance, to the good sense\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT; AND THEORY OF THE ACTION OF CANDLES AND\r\nLAMPS.\r\n\r\nThe flame of burning bodies consists of such inflammable matter in the\r\nact of combustion as is capable of existing in a gazeous state. When all\r\ncircumstances are favorable to the complete combustion of the products,\r\nthe flame is perfect; if this is not the case, part of the combustible\r\nbody, capable of being converted into the gazeous state, passes through\r\nthe luminous flame unburnt, and exhibits the appearance of smoke. Soot\r\ntherefore always indicates an imperfect combustion. Hence flame is\r\nproduced from those inflammable substances only, which are either\r\ntotally volatile when heat is applied to them, so as not to alter their\r\nchemical habitudes--or which contain a quantity of combustible matter\r\nthat is readily volatilized into vapour by heat, or the elements\r\nnecessary for producing such vapour or gazeous products, when the\r\nchemical constitution of the body is altered by an increase of\r\ntemperature. And hence the flame of bodies is nothing else than the\r\ninflammable product, either in a vaporous or in a permanently elastic\r\ngazeous state. Thus originates the flame of wood and coal, when they are\r\nburned in their crude state. They contain the elements of a quantity of\r\ninflammable matter, which is capable of assuming the gazeous state by\r\nthe application of heat, and subsequent new chemical arrangements of\r\ntheir constituent parts.\r\n\r\nAs the artificial light of lamps and candles is afforded by the flame\r\nthey exhibit, it seems a matter of considerable importance to society,\r\nto ascertain how the most luminous flame may be produced with the least\r\nconsumption of combustible matter. There does not appear to be any\r\ndanger of error in concluding, that the light emitted will be greatest\r\nwhen the matter is completely consumed in the shortest time. It is\r\ntherefore necessary, that the stream of volatilized combustible gazeous\r\nmatter should pass into the atmosphere with a certain determinate\r\nvelocity. If the quantity of this stream should not be duly\r\nproportioned; that is to say, if it be too large, its internal parts\r\nwill not be completely burned for want of contact with the air. If its\r\ntemperature be below that of ignition, it will not, in many cases, burn\r\nwhen it comes into the open air. And there is a certain velocity at\r\nwhich the quantity of atmospherical air which comes in contact with the\r\nvapour will be neither too great nor too small; for too much air will\r\ndiminish the temperature of the stream of combustible matter so much as\r\nvery considerably to impede the desired effect, and too little will\r\nrender the combustion languid.\r\n\r\nWe have an example of a flame too large in the mouths of the chimneys of\r\nfurnaces, where the luminous part is merely superficial, or of the\r\nthickness of about an inch or two, according to circumstances, and the\r\ninternal part, though hot, will not set fire to paper passed into it\r\nthrough an iron tube; the same defect of air preventing the combustion\r\nof the paper, as prevented the interior fluid itself from burning. And\r\nin the lamp of Argand we see the advantage of an internal current of\r\nair, which renders the combustion perfect by the application of air on\r\nboth sides of a thin flame. So likewise a small flame is always whiter\r\nand more luminous than a larger; and a short snuff of a candle giving\r\nout less combustible matter in proportion to the circumambient air; the\r\nquantity of light becomes increased to eight or ten times what a long\r\nsnuff would have afforded.\r\n\r\nThe light of bodies burning with flame, exists previously either\r\ncombined with the combustible body, or with the substance which supports\r\nthe combustion. We know that light exists in some bodies as a\r\nconstituent part, since it is disengaged from them when they enter into\r\nnew combinations, but we are unable to obtain in a separate state the\r\nbasis with which it was combined.\r\n\r\nThat in many cases the light evolved by artificial means is derived from\r\nthe combustible body, is obvious, if we recollect that the colour of\r\nthe light emitted during the process of combustion varies, and that this\r\nvariation usually depends not upon the medium which supports the process\r\nof combustion, but upon the combustible body itself. Hence the colour of\r\nthe flame of certain combustibles, even of the purest kind may be tinged\r\nby the admixture of various substances.\r\n\r\nThe flame of a common candle is far from being of an uniform colour. The\r\nlowest part is always blue; and when the flame is sufficiently\r\nelongated, so as to be just ready to smoke, the tip is red or brown.\r\n\r\nAs for the colours of flames that arise from coals, wood, and other\r\nusual combustibles, their variety, which hardly amounts to a few shades\r\nof red or purple, intermixed with the bright yellow light, seems\r\nprincipally to arise from the greater or less admixture of aqueous\r\nvapour, dense smoke, or, in short, of other incombustible products which\r\npass through the luminous flame unburnt.\r\n\r\nSpirit of wine burns with a blueish flame. The flame of sulphur has\r\nnearly the same tinge. The flame of zinc is of a bright greenish white.\r\nThe flame of most of the preparations of copper, or of the substances\r\nwith which they are mixed, is vivid green. Spirit of wine, mixed with\r\ncommon salt, when set on fire, burns with a very unpleasant effect, as\r\nmay be experienced by looking at the spectators who are illuminated by\r\nsuch light. If a spoonful of spirit of wine and a little boracic acid,\r\nor nitrate of copper be stirred together in a cup, and then be set on\r\nfire, the flame will be beautifully green. If spirit of wine be mixed\r\nwith nitrate of strontia, it will, afterwards, on being inflamed, burn\r\nwith a carmine red colour. Muriate of lime tinges the flame of burning\r\nspirit of wine of an orange colour.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] See Chemical Amusement, comprising minute instructions for\r\n  performing a series of striking and interesting chemical experiments,\r\n  p. 8, &c.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the general nature of Gas-Light, it will be necessary\r\nto give a short sketch of the theory and action of the instruments of\r\nillumination employed for supplying light, together with some other\r\nfacts connected with the artificial production and distribution of\r\nlight; such a proceeding will enable us to understand the general nature\r\nof the new system of illumination which it is the object of this Essay\r\nto explain.\r\n\r\nTo procure light for the ordinary purposes of life, we are acquainted\r\nwith no other ready means than the process of combustion.\r\n\r\nThe rude method of illumination consists, as is sufficiently known, in\r\nsuccessively burning certain masses of fuel in the solid state: common\r\nfires answer this purpose in the apartments of houses, and in some\r\nlight-houses. Small fires of resinous wood, and the bituminous fossil,\r\ncalled canel-coal, are in some countries applied to the same end, but\r\nthe most general and useful contrivance is that in which fat, or oil, of\r\nan animal or vegetable kind is burned by means of a wick, and these\r\ncontrivances comprehend candles and lamps.\r\n\r\nIn the lamp the combustible substance must be one of those which retain\r\ntheir fluidity at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. The candle\r\nis formed of a material which is not fusible but at a temperature\r\nconsiderably elevated.\r\n\r\nAll these substances must be rendered volatile before they can produce a\r\nflame, but for this purpose it is sufficient to volatilize a small\r\nquantity of any of them, successively; for this small quantity will\r\nsuffice to give a useful light, and hence we must admire the simple, yet\r\nwonderful contrivance of a common candle or lamp. These bodies contain a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the combustible substance, sufficient to last\r\nseveral hours; they have likewise, in a particular place, a slender\r\npiece of spongy vegetable substance, called the _wick_, which in fact is\r\nthe fire-place, or laboratory where the whole operation is conducted.\r\n\r\nThere are three articles which demand our attention in the lamp--the\r\noil, the wick, and the supply of air. It is required that the oil should\r\nbe readily inflammable; the office of the wick appears to be chiefly, if\r\nnot solely, to convey the oil by capillary attraction to the place of\r\ncombustion; as the oil is decomposed into carburetted hydrogen gas and\r\nother products, other oil succeeds, and in this way a continual current\r\nand maintenance of flame is effected.\r\n\r\nWhen a candle is for the first time lighted, a degree of heat is given\r\nto the wick, sufficient first to melt, and next to decompose the tallow\r\nsurrounding its lower surface; and just in this part the newly\r\ngenerated gas and vapour is, by admixture with the air, converted into a\r\nblue flame; which, almost instantaneously encompassing the whole body of\r\nthe vapour, communicates so much heat to it, as to make it emit a\r\nyellowish white light. The tallow now liquefied, as fast as it boils\r\naway at the top of the wick, is, by the capillary attraction of the same\r\nwick, drawn up to supply the place of what is consumed by the cotton.\r\nThe congeries of capillary tubes, which form the wick, is black, because\r\nit is converted into coal; a circumstance common to it with all other\r\nvegetable and animal substances, when part of the carbon and hydrogen\r\nwhich enter into their composition having been acted on by combustion,\r\nthe remainder and other fixed parts are by any means whatever covered\r\nand defended from the action of the air. In this case, the burning\r\nsubstance owes its protection to the surrounding flame. For when the\r\nwick, by the continual wasting of the tallow, becomes too long to\r\nsupport itself in a perpendicular situation, the top of it projects out\r\nof the cone formed by the flame, and thus being exposed to the action of\r\nthe air, is ignited, loses its blackness, and is converted into ashes;\r\nbut that part of the combustible which is successively rendered volatile\r\nby the heat of the flame is not all burnt, but part of it escapes in the\r\nform of smoke through the middle of the flame, because that part cannot\r\ncome in contact with the oxygen of the surrounding atmosphere; hence it\r\nfollows, that with a large wick and a large flame, this waste of\r\ncombustible matter is proportionately much greater than with a small\r\nwick and a small flame. In fact, when the wick is not greater than a\r\nsingle thread of cotton, the flame, though very small, is, however,\r\npeculiarly bright, and free from smoke; whereas in lamps, with very\r\nlarge wicks, such as are often suspended before butchers’ shops, or with\r\nthose of the lamp-lighters, the smoke is very offensive, and in great\r\nmeasure eclipses the light of the flame.\r\n\r\nA candle differs from a lamp in one very essential circumstance; viz.\r\nthat the oil or tallow is liquefied, only as it comes into the vicinity\r\nof the combustion; and this fluid is retained in the hollow of the part,\r\nwhich is still concrete, and forms a kind of cup. The wick, therefore,\r\nshould not, on this account, be too thin, because if this were the case,\r\nit would not carry off the material as fast as it becomes fused; and the\r\nconsequence would be, that it would gutter or run down the sides of the\r\ncandle: and as this inconvenience arises from the fusibility of the\r\ntallow it is plain that a more fusible candle will require a larger\r\nwick; or that the wick of a wax candle may be made thinner than that of\r\none of tallow. The flame of a tallow candle will of course be yellow,\r\nsmoky, and obscure, except for a short time after snuffing. When a\r\ncandle with a thick wick is first lighted, and the wick snuffed short,\r\nthe flame is perfect and luminous, unless its diameter be very great; in\r\nwhich last case, there is an opake part in the middle, where the\r\ncombustion is impeded for want of air. As the wick becomes longer, the\r\ninterval between its upper extremity and the apex of the flame is\r\ndiminished; and consequently the tallow which issues from that\r\nextremity, having a less space of ignition to pass through, is less\r\ncompletely burned, and passes off partly in smoke. This evil increases,\r\nuntil at length the upper extremity of the wick projects beyond the\r\nflame and forms a support for an accumulation of soot which is afforded\r\nby the imperfect combustion, and which retains its figure, until, by the\r\ndescent of the flame, the external air can have access to the upper\r\nextremity; but in this case, the requisite combustion which might snuff\r\nit, is not effected; for the portion of tallow emitted by the long wick\r\nis not only too large to be perfectly burned, but also carries off much\r\nof the heat of the flame, while it assumes the elastic state. By this\r\ndiminished combustion, and increased afflux of half decomposed oil, a\r\nportion of coal or soot is deposited on the upper part of the wick,\r\nwhich gradually accumulates, and at length assumes the appearance of a\r\nfungus. The candle then does not give more than one-tenth of the light\r\nwhich the due combustion of its materials would produce; and, on this\r\naccount, tallow candles require continual snuffing. But if we direct our\r\nattention to a wax candle, we find that as its wick lengthens, the light\r\nindeed becomes less. The wick, however, being thin and flexible, does\r\nnot long occupy its place in the centre of the flame; neither does it,\r\neven in that situation, enlarge the diameter of the flame, so as to\r\nprevent the access of air to its internal part. When its length is too\r\ngreat for the vertical position, it bends on one side; and its\r\nextremity, coming in contact with air, is burned to ashes; excepting\r\nsuch a portion as is defended by the continual afflux of melted wax,\r\nwhich is volatilized, and completely burned, by the surrounding flame.\r\nHence it appears, that the difficult fusibility of wax renders it\r\npracticable to burn a large quantity of fluid by means of a small wick,\r\nand that this small wick, by turning on one side in consequence of its\r\nflexibility, performs the operation of snuffing itself, in a much more\r\naccurate manner than can ever be performed mechanically. From the above\r\nstatement it appears, that the important object to society of rendering\r\ntallow candles equal to those of wax, does not at all depend on the\r\ncombustibility of the respective materials, but upon a mechanical\r\nadvantage in the cup, which is afforded by the inferior degree of\r\nfusibility in the wax: and that, in order to obtain this valuable\r\nobject, one of the following effects must be produced: either the tallow\r\nmust be burned in a lamp, to avoid the gradual progression of the flame\r\nalong the wick; or some means must be devised to enable the candle to\r\nsnuff itself, as the wax-candle does; or the tallow itself must be\r\nrendered less fusible by some chemical process. The object is, in a\r\ncommercial point of view, entitled to assiduous and extensive\r\ninvestigation. Chemists in general suppose the hardness or less\r\nfusibility of wax to arise from oxygen. Mr. NICHOLSON[3] is led by\r\nvarious considerations to imagine, that the spontaneous snuffing of\r\ncandles made of tallow or other fusible materials, will scarcely be\r\neffected but by the discovery of some material for the wick, which shall\r\nbe voluminous enough to absorb the tallow, and at the same time\r\nsufficiently flexible to bend on one side.\r\n\r\n  [3] Philosophical Journal, 4to Series, Vol. I. p. 70.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF CANDLES, LAMPS,\r\nGAS-LIGHTS, AND OTHER LUMINOUS BODIES.\r\n\r\nThough the eye is not fitted to judge of the proportional force of\r\ndifferent lights, it can distinguish, in many cases with great\r\nprecision, when two similar surfaces, presented together, are equally\r\nilluminated. But as the lucid particles are darted in right lines, they\r\nmust spread uniformly, and hence their density will diminish in the\r\nduplicate ratio of their distance. From the respective situations,\r\ntherefore, of the centres of divergency, when the contrasted surfaces\r\nbecome equally bright, we may easily compute their relative degrees of\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it is assumed as a principle, that the same quantity of\r\nlight, diverging in all directions from a luminous body, remains\r\nundiminished in all distances from the centre of divergency. Thus we\r\nmust suppose, that the quantity of light falling on every body, is the\r\nsame as would have fallen on the places occupied by the shadow; and if\r\nthere were any doubt of the truth of the supposition, it might be\r\nconfirmed by some simple experiment. Therefore, it follows, that, since\r\nthe shadow of a square inch of any surface occupies at twice the\r\ndistance of the surface from the luminous point the space of four square\r\ninches, the intensity of the light diminishes as the square of the\r\ndistance increases. If, consequently, we remove two sources of light to\r\nsuch distances from an object that they may illuminate it in equal\r\ndegrees, we may conclude that their original intensities are inversely\r\nas the squares of the distances.\r\n\r\nHence, if two lights of unequal illuminating powers shine upon the same\r\nsurface at equal obliquities, and an opake body be interposed between\r\nthem and the illuminated surface, the two shadows produced, must differ\r\nin blackness or intensity in the same degree. For the shadow formed by\r\nintercepting the greater light, will be illuminated by the smaller\r\nlight only, and reversely the other shadow will be illuminated by the\r\ngreater light: that is to say, the stronger light will be attended with\r\nthe deeper shadow. Now it is easy, by removing the stronger light to a\r\ngreater distance, to render the shadow which it produces at the common\r\nsurface equal to that afforded by the less. Experiments of this kind may\r\nbe conveniently made by fastening a sheet of white paper against the\r\nwall of a room; the two lights, of whatever nature they are, intended to\r\nbe compared, must then be placed so that the ray of light from each\r\nshall fall with nearly the same angle of incidence upon the middle of\r\nthe paper. In this situation, if a book or other object be held to\r\nintercept part of the light which would have fallen on the paper, the\r\ntwo shadows may be made to appear as in this figure;\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nwhere A represents the surface illuminated by one of the lights only; B,\r\nthe surface illuminated by the other light; C, the perfect shadow from\r\nwhich both lights are excluded. It will easily be understood that the\r\nlights about D and E, near the angle F, will fall with equal incidences\r\nwhen the double shadow is made to occupy the middle of the paper; and\r\nconsequently, if one or both of the lights be removed directly towards\r\nor from the paper, as the appearances may require, until the two shadows\r\nat E and D have the same intensity, the quantities of light emitted by\r\neach will be as the squares of the distances from the paper. By some\r\nexperiments made in this way, the degree of illumination of different\r\nlights may readily be ascertained to the tenth part of the whole. And,\r\nby experiments of this kind, many useful particulars may be shewn. For,\r\nsince the cost and duration of candles, and the consumption of oil in\r\nlamps, are easily ascertainable, it may be shewn whether more or less\r\nlight is obtained at the same expence during a given time, by burning a\r\nnumber of small candles instead of one or more of greater thickness. It\r\nwill therefore be easy to compare the power of different kinds of lamps\r\nor candles, or gas lights, so as to determine the relative cost of each\r\nparticular kind of the combustible substance employed for furnishing\r\nlight:--for example, if a candle and a gas-burner supplying coal-gas,\r\nadjusted by a stop-cock, produce the same darkness of shadow, at the\r\nsame distance from the wall, the strength or intensity of light is the\r\nsame. An uniform degree of intensity of the gas-light may readily be\r\nproduced, by opening or shutting the stop-cock, if more or less be\r\nrequired, and the candle is carefully snuffed to produce the most\r\nregular and greatest quantity of light. The size of the flame in\r\nexperiments of this kind of course becomes unnecessary, and will vary\r\nvery much with the quality of the coal gas. The bulk of the gas\r\nconsumed, and the quantity of tallow used, by weighing the candle before\r\nand after the experiment, furnish the data for ascertaining the relative\r\ncosts of tallow and gas-light, when compared with each other.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made by Count RUMFORD, concerning the quantity of\r\nmaterials requisite for producing a light of a certain intensity for a\r\ngiven time: it was found that we must burn of wax 100, of tallow 101, of\r\noil, in an Argand’s lamp, 129, of an ill-snuffed tallow candle 229\r\nparts, by weight. And with regard to the quantity of carburetted\r\nhydrogen, or coal-gas, I have found that from 18 to 20 cubic feet\r\n(according to the purity of the gas) are required to give a light equal\r\nin duration and in illuminating powers to 1lb. of tallow candles, six to\r\nthe pound, provided they were set up and burnt out one after another.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] 112lbs. of Newcastle coal, called Tanfield Moor, produce, upon an\r\n  average, from 250 to 300 cubic feet of gas, fit for illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE MODE OF COMPUTING THE RELATIVE COST OR\r\nVALUE OF LIGHT, EMITTED BY MEANS OF CANDLES, LAMPS, & OTHER BODIES.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently known that the light of a candle, which is so\r\nexceedingly brilliant when first snuffed, is very speedily diminished\r\nto one-half and is usually not more than one-fifth or one-sixth before\r\nthe uneasiness of the eye induces us to snuff it.[5] Whence it follows,\r\nthat if candles could be made so as not to require snuffing, the average\r\nquantity of light afforded by the same quantity of combustible matter\r\nwould be more than doubled.\r\n\r\n  [5] Ezekiel Walker.--Nicholson’s Journal, Vol. IV. 8vo. Series.\r\n\r\nWhen a lighted candle is so placed as neither to require snuffing or\r\nproduce smoke, it is reasonable to conclude that the whole of the\r\ncombustible matter which is consumed is converted to the purpose of\r\ngenerating light; and that the intensities of light afforded in a given\r\ntime, by candles of different dimensions, are in proportion to the\r\nquantity of matter consumed. That is to say; when candles are made of\r\nthe same materials, if one candle produce twice as much light as\r\nanother, the former will in the same time lose twice as much weight as\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nTo prove the truth of this position, Mr. Walker made the experiments\r\ncontained in the following\r\n\r\nTABLE.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |           |        |        |  Weight  |        |         |\r\n  |           |        |        |  of the  |        |Distance |\r\n  |  No. of   | No. of |Time of | Candles  |Strength| of the  |\r\n  |    the    |   the  |burning.| consumed |   of   | Candles |\r\n  |Experiment.|Candles.|        |   in a   | Light. |from the |\r\n  |           |        |        |   given  |        |  Wall.  |\r\n  |           |        |        |   time.  |        |         |\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |           |        |  h.    | oz. dr.  |        |  Feet.  |\r\n  |          {|    1   |  3  0  | 0   15   |  1     |    7    |\r\n  |   1      {|    3   |  3  0  | 1    1½  |  1 +   |    7    |\r\n  |          {|  Mould |  3  0  | 0   15   |  1     |    7    |\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |          {|    1   |  2 55  | 0   15   |  1     |    8    |\r\n  |   2      {|    3   |  2 55  | 1    0   |  1 +   |    8    |\r\n  |          {|  Mould |  2 55  | 0   15   |  1     |    8    |\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |          {|    1   |  3  0  | 0   15¾  |  1     |    8    |\r\n  |   3      {|    3   |  3  0  | 1    2   |  1⅛    |    8¾   |\r\n  |          {|  Mould |  3  0  | 0    0   |  1     |    9    |\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n  |   4      {|    5   |  3  0  | 1    5   |  1.18  |    8¾   |\r\n  |          {|  Mould |  3  0  | 1    1⅛  |  1.    |    8    |\r\n  +-----------+--------+--------+----------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nThese experiments, Mr. Walker informs us, were made in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\nThree candles, the dimensions of which are given in the table, against\r\n1, 3, and mould. These were first weighed, and then lighted at the same\r\ninstant. At the end of the time inserted in the third column of the\r\nabove table, they were extinguished and weighed again, and the loss of\r\nweight of each candle is contained in the fourth column.\r\n\r\nThe three first experiments were made under such favourable\r\ncircumstance, that there was little doubt of their results being more\r\naccurate than what practical utility requires, but the fourth experiment\r\ncannot be depended on so much, in consequence of the variable light of\r\nNo. 5. This candle was moved so often to keep the two shadows equal,\r\nthat it was found necessary to set down its mean distance from the wall\r\nby estimation; but as this was done before the candles were weighed, the\r\nexperimenter’s mind could not be under the influence of partiality for a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe method which Mr. Walker employed in comparing one light with another\r\nin each experiment, was that which has been described page 24.\r\n\r\n1. The experiments were made at different times, and the light of the\r\nmould candle was made the standard, with which the lights of the others\r\nwere compared; but it must not be understood, that this candle gave the\r\nsame strength of light in every experiment.\r\n\r\n2. The sign + in the 5th column, signifies that the candle against\r\nwhich it is placed, gave a stronger light than the others.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments contained in the table, it appears to be an\r\nestablished law, where combustion is complete, that the quantities of\r\nlight produced by tallow candles, are in the complicate ratio of their\r\ntimes of burning and weights of matter consumed.\r\n\r\nFor if their quantities of matter be equal, and times of burning the\r\nsame, they will give equal quantities of light, _by the experiments_.\r\n\r\nAnd if the times of burning be equal, the quantities of light will be\r\ndirectly as their weights of matter expended.\r\n\r\nTherefore the light is universally in the compound ratio of the time of\r\nburning and weight of matter consumed.\r\n\r\nIf the law which Mr. Walker has endeavoured to prove, both by reason and\r\nexperiment, be admitted, we have a standard with which we may compare\r\nthe strength of any other light.\r\n\r\nLet a small mould candle, when lighted, be so placed as neither to\r\nproduce smoke nor require snuffing, and it will lose an ounce of its\r\nweight in three hours. Let this quantity of light produced under these\r\ncircumstances, be represented by 1.00.\r\n\r\nThen should this candle at any other time, lose more or less of its\r\nweight in three hours than an ounce, the quantity of light will be still\r\nknown, because the quantity of light in a given time is directly as the\r\nweight of the candle consumed.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] To investigate rules for this purpose, 1. Let M represent the\r\n  mould candle, _a_ its distance from the wall, on which the shadows\r\n  were compared, _x_ its quantity of matter consumed in a given time,\r\n  (_t_) and Q the quantity of light emitted by M in the same time: 2.\r\n  Let _m_ represent any other candle, _b_ its distance from the same\r\n  wall, and _y_ its quantity of matter consumed, in the time _t_.\r\n\r\n  Then as the intensities of light are directly as the squares of the\r\n  distances of the two candles from the wall, we have as _a_² : Q ∷ _b_²\r\n  : (_b_² + Q)/_a_² = the quantity of light, emitted by _m_ in the time.\r\n\r\n  Then let us suppose that the quantities of light are directly as the\r\n  quantities of matter consumed in the time _t_, and we have, As _x_ : Q\r\n  ∷ _y_ : (_y_ + Q)/_x_ = the quantity of light emitted by _m_ in that\r\n  time, by hypothesis.\r\n\r\n  Now, when (_b_² + Q)/_a_² (Theo. 1.) is = (Y + Q)/X (Theo. 2.) the\r\n  quantities of light of M and _m_ are directly as their quantities of\r\n  matter consumed in any given time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF INCREASING THE LIGHT OF TALLOW CANDLES, AND TO OBVIATE THE\r\nNECESSITY OF SNUFFING THEM.\r\n\r\nMr. EZEKIEL WALKER has shewn that, if a trifling alteration be made in\r\nthe method of using common tallow candles, they will become excellent\r\nsubstitutes for those of wax.\r\n\r\nA common candle, weighing one-tenth of a pound, containing fourteen\r\nsingle threads of fine cotton, placed so as to form an angle of 30\r\ndegrees[7] with the perpendicular, and lighted, requires no snuffing;\r\nand what is much more valuable for some purposes, it gives a light that\r\nis nearly uniform in strength without the least smoke. These effects are\r\nthus produced:\r\n\r\n  [7] Candlesticks may be made to hold the candle at this angle, or they\r\n  may be so contrived as to hold the candle at any angle at pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen a candle burns in an inclined position, most part of the flame\r\nrises perpendicularly from the upper side of the wick, and when viewed\r\nin a certain direction, it appears in the form of an obtuse angled\r\ntriangle. And as the end of the wick projects beyond the flame at the\r\nobtuse angle, it meets with the air, and is completely burnt to ashes:\r\nhence it is rendered incapable of acting as a conductor to carry off\r\npart of the combustible matter in the form of smoke. By this spontaneous\r\nmode of snuffing, that part of the wick which is acted upon by the flame\r\ncontinues of the same length, and the flame itself very nearly of the\r\nsame strength and magnitude[8].\r\n\r\n  [8] The wick’s not being uniformly twisted throughout, may occasion a\r\n  little variation in the dimensions of the flame.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which may be derived from candles that require no\r\nsnuffing and afford no smoke, may be readily understood; but these\r\ncandles have another property which ought not to be passed over in\r\nsilence. A candle snuffed by an instrument gives a very fluctuating\r\nlight, which, in viewing near objects is highly injurious to the eye;\r\nand this is an inconvenience which no shade can remove. But when a\r\ncandle is snuffed spontaneously, it gives a light so perfectly steady\r\nand so uniformly bright, that the adjustments of the eye remain at rest,\r\nand distinct vision is performed without pain, and without uneasiness.\r\n\r\nCandles, on which Mr. WALKER has made experiments, are described in the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\nTABLE.\r\n\r\n  +-----+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n  |     |No. of candles|         | No. of single |\r\n  | No. | to the pound |Length in|threads of fine|\r\n  |     | avoirdupoise | inches. | cotton in the |\r\n  |     |   weight.    |         |    wick.      |\r\n  +-----+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n  |  1  |      14      |   8.5   |     10        |\r\n  |  2  |      13      |   9.    |     12        |\r\n  |  3  |      10      |   9.74  |     14        |\r\n  |  4  |       8      |  10.    |     20        |\r\n  |  5  |       6      |  10.25  |     24        |\r\n  |Mould|       6      |  13.    |               |\r\n  +-----+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\nNumber 1, 2, and 3. These candles, when lighted and placed to form an\r\nangle of 30° with the perpendicular, require no snuffing: they give\r\nlights which are nearly equal, and combustion proceeds so regularly,\r\nthat no part of the melted tallow escapes unconsumed, except from\r\naccidental causes.\r\n\r\nNo. 4, placed at the angle mentioned above, and lighted, requires no\r\nsnuffing: it gives a light very little stronger than No. 1, but its\r\ncolour is not quite so white, nor its flame so steady.\r\n\r\nNo. 5. This candle, placed at an angle of 30°, and lighted, requires no\r\nsnuffing; its flame is rather fluctuating, and not so white as No. 4,\r\nnor is its strength of light much greater than No. 1. The melted tallow\r\nsometimes overflows when the air in the room is put in motion; yet the\r\nlight of this candle is much improved by being placed in an inclined\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe mould candle, treated in the same manner, affords a very pure steady\r\nflame, without smoke and without snuffing, and its strength of light is\r\nabout equal to that of No. 1.\r\n\r\nThe experiments have not been sufficiently numerous to determine with\r\nprecision which of these candles affords the most light at a given\r\nexpence, but the few experiments which have been made seem to indicate,\r\nthat the quantity of light is nearly as the quantity of combustible\r\nmatter consumed, and thus a candle which is used in the manner pointed\r\nout gives more light than a candle of the same dimension set\r\nperpendicularly and snuffed, because one part of a candle that is\r\nsnuffed, is thrown away, and another part flies off in the form of\r\nsmoke. And this is not the only inconvenience that attends the using\r\ncandles in this manner, and which the other method is free from, for the\r\nlight which it gives is of a bad quality, on account of its being\r\nvariable and undulating.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that a candle is snuffed till it wants snuffing again, its\r\nstrength of light scarcely continues the same for a single minute. And\r\nthat variation which frequently takes place in the height of the flame,\r\nis a matter of still more serious consequence.\r\n\r\nThe flame of a long candle placed vertically when it is snuffed burns\r\nsteadily, is about two inches high, but it very frequently rises to the\r\nheight of four inches or upwards; drops down again in a moment, till it\r\nis less than three inches, and then rises again. In this manner the\r\nflame continues in motion for some time before it returns to its\r\noriginal dimensions. But it does not continue long in a quiescent state\r\nbefore it begins a new series of undulations. In this manner the candle\r\nburns till the top of the wick is seen near the apex of the flame,\r\ncarrying off clouds of smoke. In this state of things the eye becomes\r\nuneasy for want of light, and the snuffers are applied to remove the\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nMr. WALKER further observes, that it is these sudden changes, and not\r\nthe nature of candle-light itself, that do so much injury to the eye of\r\nthe student and artist; and that that injury may be easily prevented, by\r\nlaying aside the snuffers, and in the place of one large candle, let two\r\nsmall ones be used in the manner stated.\r\n\r\nThe following observations on this subject are copied from the Monthly\r\nMagazine, 1805, p. 206.\r\n\r\n“It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the combustion of candles\r\nproceeds the quicker in proportion as the inclination is greater. From\r\nthe experiments which I have made, I should consider an angle of forty\r\ndegrees with the perpendicular as the maximum of inclination, beyond\r\nwhich several considerable inconveniencies would occur; and I should\r\ntake 25 degrees as the minimum of inclination, less than which does not\r\nsufficiently expose the point of the wick to the action of the air.\r\n\r\n“By those who are much in the habit of reading or writing by\r\ncandle-light, it will also be esteemed no inconsiderable addition to the\r\nadvantages already mentioned, that the trouble of seeking and applying\r\nthe snuffers is superseded. A candle of common size in a vertical\r\nposition, requires the application of the snuffers forty-five times\r\nduring its complete consumption.\r\n\r\n“But I found an obstacle to the adoption of Mr. WALKER’s plan, which,\r\nfrom the inclined position of the candle, it did not immediately occur\r\nto me by what means to counteract. Any agitation of the air of the room,\r\noccasioned either by the opening or shutting of a door, or by the quick\r\npassage of a person near the candle, caused the melted tallow to run\r\nover, or, in more familiar language, caused the candle to gutter; which,\r\nwith the candle in this position, became an insuperable bar to the use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n“For the prevention of this inconvenience, I have had a wire\r\nskeleton-shade adapted to a rod bearing the same inclination as the\r\ncandle, and which at bottom joins the candlestick in an horizontal line\r\nof about two inches, terminating in a nozzle fitting that of the\r\ncandlestick.--The distance of this rod from the candlestick, or, which\r\nis the same thing, the length of the foot or horizontal line, is of\r\ncourse to be determined by the distance between the two circles which\r\nform the upper and lower apertures of the shade.--It may serve, perhaps,\r\nmore familiarly to describe this part of the apparatus, to state, that\r\nit bears a perfect resemblance to the two first strokes of the written\r\nfigure 4; and the third stroke, if carried up as high as the first, and\r\nmade sloping instead of upright, will very well represent the situation\r\nof the candle.\r\n\r\n“When a strong light, for the purposes of reading or writing, be\r\nrequired, a white silk or paper may be used, as is common, over the\r\nskeleton; but when it be required that the light should be dispersed\r\nover the room, a glass of a similar shape may be adopted, for the\r\npurpose of preventing the flame from being influenced by any agitation\r\nof the air of the room. If the upper circle of the shade be four inches\r\nin diameter, the apex of the flame will be within it during more than\r\nhalf the time of the complete consumption of the candle; the shade will\r\nnot, therefore, require adjusting for the purpose of preventing injury\r\nto the silk, or whatever else may be used over the skeleton, more than\r\nonce during that time.\r\n\r\n“Being myself much averse to the interruptions which a candle used in a\r\nvertical position occasions, and which, though short, may, under some\r\ncircumstances, be highly vexatious, I wish to extend to others a benefit\r\nwhich I prize rather highly.”\r\n\r\nLord STANHOPE[9] has published a simple method of manufacturing candles,\r\nwhich, according to his Lordship’s statement, is superior to the method\r\nusually employed. The principles upon which the process depends are the\r\nfollowing:--First, the wick of the candle is to have only three-fourths\r\nof the usual number of cotton threads, if the candle be of wax or\r\nspermaceti; and only two-thirds of the usual number, if the candle be of\r\ntallow. Secondly, it is required that the wick in all cases be perfectly\r\nfree from moisture, a circumstance seldom attended to in the\r\nmanufacturing of candles; and thirdly, to deprive the wick of wax\r\ncandles, of all the air which is entangled in its fibres, and this may\r\nconveniently be done, by boiling it in melted wax, till no more air\r\nbubbles, or froth appear on the surface of the fluid.\r\n\r\n  [9] Repository of Arts, Vol. I, p. 86.\r\n\r\nIf these circumstances be attended to, three candles of any size thus\r\nprepared, last as long as four of the same size manufactured in the\r\ncommon way. The light which they afford is superior and more steady than\r\nthe light of common candles; and lastly, candles made in this manner,\r\nwhether of wax, spermaceti, or tallow, do not require to be snuffed as\r\noften. Besides all this, they flame much less, and are consequently\r\nbetter for writing, reading, working and drawing, than candles made by\r\nthe common method.\r\n\r\nThe following observations will enable any person who is willing to try\r\nthe candles manufactured according to Lord Stanhope’s plan, to ascertain\r\nthe real value of the improvements suggested by his Lordship. It shews\r\nalso the result of some experiments, made to ascertain the expence of\r\nburning oil in lamps with wicks of various sizes.\r\n\r\nA taper lamp, with eight threads of cotton, will consume in one hour\r\n225/1000 oz. of spermaceti oil: at six shillings per gallon, the expence\r\nof burning twelve hours is 13.71 farthings.\r\n\r\nAt seven shillings, it is 15.995 farthings.\r\n\r\nAt eight shillings, it is 18.280 farthings.\r\n\r\nN. B. This gives as good a light as tallow candles of eight and ten in\r\nthe pound. This lamp seldom wants snuffing, and casts a steady and\r\nstrong light.\r\n\r\nA taper, chamber, or watch lamp, with four ordinary threads of cotton in\r\nthe wick, consumes 1.664 oz. of spermaceti oil in one hour: the oil at\r\nseven shillings per gallon, the expence of burning twelve hours, 7.02\r\nfarthings.\r\n\r\nAt eight shillings, it is 8.022 farthings.\r\n\r\nAt nine shillings, it is 9.024 farthings.\r\n\r\nTABLE,\r\n\r\n  Exhibiting a series of experiments, made with a view to determine the\r\n  real and comparative expence of burning candles of different sorts and\r\n  sizes.\r\n\r\n  +-------+---------+-----------+--------+----------+-----------------+\r\n  |       |Number of| Weight of |Time one|The time  |The expence in   |\r\n  |       | candles |one candle.| candle |that one  |twelve hours when|\r\n  |       | in one  |           | lasted.|pound will|candles are at   |\r\n  |       | pound.  |           |        |last.     |12s. per dozen,  |\r\n  |       |         |           |        |          |which also shews |\r\n  |       |         |           |        |          |the proportion of|\r\n  |       |         |           |        |          |expence at any   |\r\n  |       |         |           |        |          |price, per dozen.|\r\n  |       +---------+-----------+--------+----------+-----------------+\r\n  |       |         |           |        |          |Farthings and    |\r\n  |       |         | Oz.

The\r\nsame, has been observed by Mr. WARREN, to be the case with flames of\r\ngas-lights, which, when combined, give a much stronger light than they\r\nwould afford, when in a separate state.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in all cases, where flames for producing light are placed near\r\nto each other, it is always beneficial to preserve the heat of the flame\r\nas much as possible. One of the most simple methods of doing this, is no\r\ndoubt, the placing of the several flames together, and as near as\r\npossible to each other without touching, in order that they may mutually\r\ncover and defend each other against the powerful cooling influence of\r\nthe surrounding cold bodies. This principle is now employed in the\r\nLiverpool lamp, which acts by several flat or ribband wicks placed in\r\nthe form of a cylinder. The power of illumination of this lamp is\r\nsuperior in effect and more economical than any other lamp in use--and\r\nas flame is perfectly transparent to the light of another flame which\r\npasses through it, there is no danger of loss of light on account of the\r\nflames covering each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS-LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nA new art of procuring artificial light, which consists in burning the\r\ngazeous fluid obtained by distillation from common pit-coal, has of late\r\nengaged the attention of the public, under the name of _gas-light_.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement that has been given for some years past by the\r\nlegislature to this system of lighting, has induced certain individuals\r\nto apply the coal-gas light for the illumination of streets, houses,\r\nroads, and public edifices. And it is sufficiently known that a company\r\nhas been incorporated by charter under the name of the “_Gas Light and\r\nCoke Company_,” to apply this new art of procuring light, by way of\r\nexperiment, on a large scale, in lighting the streets of the\r\nmetropolis.[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] An Act for granting certain powers and authorities to a company\r\n  to be incorporated by charter, called the “Gas Light and Coke\r\n  Company,” for making inflammable air for the lighting of the streets\r\n  of the metropolis, &c.--Session 1810, 50th Geo. III.\r\n\r\nThe power and authorities granted to this corporate body are very\r\nrestricted and moderate. The individuals composing it have no exclusive\r\nprivilege; their charter does not prevent other persons from entering\r\ninto competition with them. Their operations are confined to the\r\nmetropolis where they are bound to furnish not only a stronger and\r\nbetter light to such streets and parishes as chuse to be lighted with\r\ngas, but also at a cheaper price than shall be paid for lighting the\r\nsaid streets with oil in the usual manner. The corporation is not\r\npermitted to traffic in machinery for manufacturing or conveying the gas\r\ninto private houses, their capital or joint stock is limited to\r\n200,000_l._ and His Majesty has the power of declaring the gas-light\r\ncharter void, if the company fail to fulfil the terms of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE COMBUSTION OF COAL IN ELUCIDATION OF THE NATURE AND\r\nPRODUCTION OF GAS LIGHT.\r\n\r\nPit-coal exists in this island in strata, which, as far as concerns many\r\nhundred generations after us, may be pronounced inexhaustible; and is so\r\nadmirably adapted, both for domestic purposes and the uses of the arts,\r\nthat it is justly regarded as a most essential constituent of our\r\nnational wealth. Like all other bituminous substances, it is composed of\r\na fixed carbonaceous base or bitumen, united to more or less earthy and\r\nsaline matter constituting the ashes left behind when this substance is\r\nburnt. The proportions of these parts differ considerably, in different\r\nkinds of coal; and according to the prevalency of one or other of them,\r\nso the coal is more or less combustible, and possesses the characters\r\nof perfect pit-coal; and by various shades, passes from the most\r\ninflammable canel-coal, into blind, Kilkenny, or stone-coal; and,\r\nlastly, into a variety of earthy or stony substances; which, although\r\nthey are inflammable, do not merit the appellation of coal.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows that when pit-coals are burning in our grates, a flame\r\nmore or less luminous issues from them, and that they frequently emit\r\nbeautiful streams of flame remarkably bright. But besides the flame,\r\nwhich is a peculiar gas in the state of combustion, heat expels from\r\ncoal an aqueous vapour, loaded with several kinds of ammoniacal salts, a\r\nthick viscid fluid resembling tar, and some gases that are not of a\r\ncombustible nature. The consequence of which is, that the flame of a\r\ncoal-fire is continually wavering and changing, both in shape, as well\r\nas brilliance and in colour, so that what one moment gave a beautiful\r\nbright light, in the next, perhaps, is obscured by a stream of thick\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nBut if coals, instead of being suffered to burn in this way, are\r\nsubmitted to distillation in close vessels, all its immediate\r\nconstituent parts may be collected. The bituminous part is melted out\r\nin the form of tar. There is disengaged at the same time, a large\r\nquantity of an aqueous fluid, contaminated with a portion of oil, and\r\nvarious ammoniacal salts. A large quantity of carburetted hidrogen, and\r\nother uninflammable gases, make their appearance, and the fixed base of\r\nthe coal remains behind in the distillatory apparatus in the form of a\r\ncarbonaceous substance, called coke.\r\n\r\nAll these products may be separately collected in different vessels. The\r\ncarburetted hidrogen, or coal-gas, may be freed from the non-inflammable\r\ngases, and afterwards forced in streams out of small appertures, which,\r\nwhen lighted, may serve as the flame of a candle to illuminate a room or\r\nany other place. It is thus, that from pit-coal a native production of\r\nthis country, we may procure a pure, lasting, and copious light; which,\r\nin other cases, must be derived from expensive materials, in part\r\nimported from abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly upon the power of collecting the products afforded by\r\ncoal, with convenience and cheapness, that the promoters of the\r\ngas-light illumination found their claims to public encouragement. They\r\nconceive that the flame which pit-coal yields, as it is now consumed,\r\nis turned to very little advantage: it is not only confined to one\r\nplace, where a red heat is more wanted than a brilliant flame, but it is\r\nobscured, and sometimes entirely smothered, by the quantity of\r\nincombustible materials that ascend along with it and pollute the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThat much inflammable matter is thus lost, is evident from facts that\r\ncome under our daily observation. We often see a flame suddenly burst\r\nfrom the densest smoke, and as suddenly disappear; and if a light be\r\napplied to the little jets that issue from the bituminous parts of the\r\ncoal, they will catch fire, and burn with a bright flame. A considerable\r\nquantity of a gazeous fluid, capable of affording light and heat\r\ncontinually escapes up the chimney, whilst another part is occasionally\r\nignited, and exhibits the phenomena of the flame and light of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the production of gas-light is therefore analogous to the\r\naction of a lamp or candle. The wick of a candle being surrounded by the\r\nflame, is in the same situation of the pit-coal exposed to distillation.\r\nThe office of the wick is chiefly to convey tallow, by capillary\r\nattraction, to the place of combustion. As it is decomposed into\r\ncarburetted hidrogen gas it is consumed and flies off, another portion\r\nsucceeds; and in this way a continued current of tallow and maintenance\r\nof flame are effected. See page 15.\r\n\r\nThe combustion of oil by means of a lamp depends on similar\r\ncircumstances. The tubes formed by the wick serve the same office as a\r\nretort placed in a heated furnace through which the inflammable liquid\r\nis transmitted. The oil is drawn up into these ignited tubes, and is\r\ndecomposed into carburetted hidrogen gas, and from the combustion of\r\nthis gas the illumination proceeds. See p. 15. What then does the\r\ngas-light system attempt? Nothing more than to generate, by means of\r\nsufficient furnaces and a reservoir of sufficient capacity, desired\r\nquantities of the gas, which is the same material of the flame of\r\ncandles or lamps; and then by passing it through pipes to any desired\r\ndistance, to exhibit it there at the mouths of the conducting tubes, so\r\nthat it may be ignited for any desired purpose. The only difference\r\nbetween this process and that of an ordinary candle or lamp, consists in\r\nhaving the furnace at the manufactory, instead of its being in the wick\r\nof the candle or lamp--in having the inflammable material distilled at\r\nthe station, instead of its present exhibitions in oil, wax, or tallow,\r\nand then in transmitting the gas to any required distance, and igniting\r\nit at the orifice of the conducting pipe instead of igniting it at the\r\napex of the wick. The principle is rational, and justified by the\r\nuniversal mode in which all light is produced. Indeed, this discovery\r\nranks among the numerous recent applications of chemical science to the\r\npurposes of life, which promise to be of the most general utility.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the outline here given of the production and\r\napplication of coal-gas, that all the uses of pit-coal are not\r\nexhausted; it will be sufficient to observe, that the complete analysis\r\nof coal, which has been hitherto confined to the laboratory of the\r\nchemist, requiring skill and nicety in the operator, and attended with\r\ngreat trouble and expence, is now so far simplified, that many chaldrons\r\nof coals may be decomposed by one gas-light apparatus in the space of\r\nsix hours, and all the component parts produced in their most useful\r\nshape, at an expence out of all proportion below the value of the\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE DISCOVERY AND APPLICATION OF\r\nCOAL-GAS, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROCURING ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.\r\n\r\nTo assist the reader in comprehending the nature and object of\r\nsubstituting coal-gas for tallow or oil, for the purpose of obtaining\r\nlight, it may be proper to touch slightly upon the successive\r\ndiscoveries that have been made as to the decomposition of coal, and the\r\napplication of its different ingredients. Such a sketch will add to the\r\nmany examples that occur in the history of science and art, showing the\r\nslow progress of mankind in following up known principles, or extracting\r\nfrom acknowledged facts every possible advantage.\r\n\r\nIn the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, V. XLI. so long\r\nago as the year 1739, is recorded a paper, exhibiting an account of some\r\nexperiments made by Dr. James Clayton, from which it appears that the\r\ninflammable nature of coal-gas was then already known. Dr. Clayton\r\nhaving distilled Newcastle coal, obtained, as products of the process,\r\nan aqueous fluid, a black oil, and an inflammable gas, which he caught\r\nin bladders, and by pricking these he was enabled to inflame the gas at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIt is further known, that in the beginning of the last century, Dr.\r\nHales[11] on submitting pit-coal to a chemical examination, found, that\r\nduring the ignition of this fossil in close vessels, nearly one-third of\r\nthe coal became volatilized in the form of an inflammable vapour. Hence\r\nthe discovery of the inflammable nature of coal-gas can no longer be\r\nclaimed by any person now living.\r\n\r\n  [11] Vegetab. Statics, vol. I.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1767, the Bishop of Llandaff[12] examined the nature of the\r\nvapour and gazeous products evolved during the distillation of pit-coal.\r\nThis learned philosopher noticed, that the volatile product is not only\r\ninflammable as it issues from the distillatory vessel, but that it also\r\nretained its inflammability after having been made to pass through\r\nwater, and suffered to ascend through two high curved tubes. The solid\r\nmatters obtained by this venerable prelate, were, an aqueous ammoniacal\r\nfluid, a tenaceous oil, resembling tar, an ammoniacal liquor, and a\r\nspongy coal, or coke.\r\n\r\n  [12] Watson’s Chemical Essays, vol. II.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery and application of the use of coal-gas for the\r\npurpose of illumination is claimed by Mr. Murdoch.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Henry of Manchester, has published the following account[13] of\r\nthis discovery.\r\n\r\n  [13] Thompson’s System of Chemistry, vol. I. p. 52.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1792, at which time Mr. Murdoch resided at Redruth, in\r\nCornwall, he commenced a series of experiments upon the quantity and\r\nquality of the gases contained in different substances. In the course of\r\nthese he remarked, that the gas obtained by distillation from coal,\r\npeat, wood, and other inflammable substances, burnt with great\r\nbrilliancy upon being set fire to; and it occurred to him, that by\r\nconfining and conducting it through tubes, it might be employed as an\r\neconomical substitute for lamps and candles. The distillation was\r\nperformed in iron retorts, and the gas conducted through tinned iron and\r\ncopper tubes to the distance of 70 feet. At this termination, as well as\r\nat intermediate points, the gas was set fire to, as it passed through\r\napertures of different diameters and forms, purposely varied with a view\r\nof ascertaining which would answer best. In some the gas issued through\r\na number of small holes like the head of a watering pan; in others it\r\nwas thrown out in thin long sheets; and again in others in circular\r\nones, upon the principle of Argand’s lamp. Bags of leather and of\r\nvarnished silk, bladders, and vessels of tinned iron, were filled with\r\nthe gas, which was set fire to, and carried about from room to room,\r\nwith a view of ascertaining how far it could be made to answer the\r\npurpose of a moveable or transferable light. Trials were likewise made\r\nof the different quantities and qualities of gas produced by coals of\r\nvarious descriptions, such as the Swansea, Haverfordwest, Newcastle,\r\nShropshire, Staffordshire, and some kinds of Scotch coals.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Murdoch’s constant occupations prevented his giving farther\r\nattention to the subject at that time; but he again availed himself of a\r\nmoment of leisure to repeat his experiments upon coal and peat at Old\r\nCumnock, in Ayrshire, in 1797; and it may be proper to notice that both\r\nthese, and the former ones, were exhibited to numerous spectators, who,\r\nif necessary, can attest them. In 1798, he constructed an apparatus at\r\nSoho Foundry, which was applied during many successive nights to the\r\nlighting of the building; when the experiments upon different apertures\r\nwere repeated and extended upon a large scale. Various methods were also\r\npractised of washing and purifying the air, to get rid of the smoke and\r\nsmell. These experiments were continued, with occasional interruptions,\r\nuntil the epoch of the peace in the spring of 1802, when the\r\nillumination of the Soho manufactory afforded an opportunity of making a\r\npublic display of the new lights; and they were made to constitute a\r\nprincipal feature in that exhibition.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1803 and 1804, Mr. Winsor exhibited at the Lyceum in London\r\nthe general nature of this new mode of illumination though the\r\nmachinery for procuring, and the manner of purifying the gas, he kept a\r\nsecret. He exhibited the mode of conducting the gas through the house,\r\nand a number of devices for chandeliers, lamps, and burners, by which it\r\nmight be applied. Among these he proposed long flexible tubes suspended\r\nfrom the ceiling, or wall of the room, and at the end communicating with\r\nburners or lamps of different kinds. This gentleman showed also by\r\nexperiment, that the flame of the gas-light, produced no smoke; that it\r\nwas not so dangerous as the flame of candles or lamps; that it could not\r\nproduce sparks; and that it was not so readily extinguished by gusts of\r\nwind or torrents of rain.\r\n\r\nMr. WINSOR’s display of gas-lights took place more than two years before\r\nMr. MURDOCH’s priority of right was heard of.\r\n\r\nIn stating these facts I do not mean to say that Mr. MURDOCH derived the\r\nhint of applying the coal-gas from the previous exhibition of Mr.\r\nWINSOR, because it is quite within the bounds of probability that the\r\nideas of Mr. MURDOCH may have arisen totally independent of all\r\nacquaintance with Mr. WINSOR’s.\r\n\r\nThe claims of invention, or the determination of the right of priority,\r\nconcerns the public only so far as the honour and estimation of any\r\nuseful discovery conferred on the inventor may induce other individuals\r\nto devote their talents to similar pursuits; by means of which, more\r\ndiscoveries may be made, and the subject of human invention become\r\nextended, or rendered more useful. For as the mere benefits which\r\nmankind may derive from any particular discovery, they are certainly\r\nmore indebted to the person who first applied the discovery to actual\r\npractice, than to him who first made it, and merely illustrated it by\r\nbarren experiments. Mr. WINSOR certainly pressed on the mind of the\r\npublic with unremitted perseverance and diligence the extensive\r\napplication of gas-light in the year 1802, but he made no new discovery\r\nwith regard to the composition of coal; he did not even invent the mode\r\nof conducting the gas through tubes; and if he has pointed out the\r\nparticulars of the process, he has made a very important, though not the\r\nmost brilliant improvement in this line of business. Mr. WINSOR’s\r\npublications are, perhaps, but ill adapted to promote his cause; and the\r\nexaggerated calculation which the sanguine mind of a discoverer is\r\nnaturally disposed to indulge in, have, to superficial observers, thrown\r\nan air of ridicule and improbability on the whole scheme of lighting\r\nwith gas.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be safely affirmed, that if the same facts had come\r\nforward, under the sanction of some great name in the chemical or\r\nphilosophical world, the public incredulity would long since have been\r\nsubdued; and the plan, which for many years has been struggling for\r\nexistence, would have been eagerly adopted as a national object.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, 1804, Mr. FREDERICK ALBERT WINSOR, took out a patent\r\nfor combining the saving and purifying of the inflammable gas (for\r\nproducing light and heat), the ammonia, tar, and other products of\r\npit-coal, with the manufacture of a superior kind of coke (see\r\nRepertory, 2d Series, v. 172). And, lately, the same gentleman has taken\r\nout a second patent, for further improvements in these processes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1805, Mr. NORTHERN, of Leeds, also directed the attention\r\nof the public to the application of coal-gas, as a substitute for tallow\r\nlight, as will be seen by the following extract of the Monthly Magazine\r\nfor April, 1805.\r\n\r\n“I distilled in a retort, 50 ounces of pit-coal in a red heat, which\r\ngave 6 ounces of a liquid matter covered with oil, more or less fluid as\r\nthe heat was increased or diminished. About 26 ounces of cinder remained\r\nin the retort; the rest came over in the form of air, as it was\r\ncollected in the pneumatic apparatus. I mixed part of it with\r\natmospherical air, and fired it with the electric spark with a tolerable\r\nexplosion, which proves it to be hydrogene.--Whether any of the other\r\ngases were mixed with it, I did not then determine. In the receiver I\r\nfound a fluid of an acid taste, with a great quantity of oil, and, at\r\nthe bottom, a substance resembling tar.\r\n\r\n“The apparatus I make use of for producing light is a refiner’s\r\ncrucible, the top of which (after filling with coal) I close with a\r\nmetal cover, luted with clay or other luting, so as to prevent the\r\nescape of the gas; a metal pipe is soldered into the cover, bent so as\r\nto come under the shelf in the pneumatic trough, over which I place a\r\njar with a stop-cock and a small tube; the jar being previously filled\r\nwith water, the crucible I place on the common or other fire as is most\r\nconvenient; and as the heat increases in it, the gas is forced rapidly\r\nthrough the water into the jar, and regularly displaces it. I then open\r\nthe cock and put fire to the gas, which makes its escape through the\r\nsmall tube, and immediately a most beautiful flame ensues, perfectly\r\nfree from smoke or smell of any kind. A larger light, but not so vivid\r\nor clear, will be produced without passing the gas through water, but\r\nattended with a smoke somewhat greater than that of a lamp charged with\r\ncommon oil.\r\n\r\n“I have great hopes that some active mechanic or chemist will, in the\r\nend, hit on a plan to produce light for large factories, and other\r\npurposes, at a much less expence, by the above or similar means, than is\r\nat present produced from oil.”\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, Mr. SAMUEL CLEGG[14] of Manchester, Engineer,\r\ncommunicated an account of his method of lighting up manufactories with\r\ngas-light to the Society of Arts, for which he received the silver\r\nmedal.\r\n\r\n  [14] This gentleman is at present engineer to the Gas-Light Company.\r\n\r\nSince that time, the application of gas-light has spread rapidly, and\r\nnumerous manufactories and other establishments have been lighted by\r\ncoal-gas.\r\n\r\nIn France, the application of gas-lights to economical purposes, was\r\npointed out long before it was publicly introduced into this country. M.\r\nLE BON had a house fitted up in Paris, in the winter of 1802, so as to\r\nbe entirely illuminated by gas-lights, which was seen by thousands with\r\nadmiration; and had a _brevet d’invention_ (patent) granted to him by\r\nthe French government, for the art of producing light from wood, ignited\r\nin close vessels.\r\n\r\nMany other attempts have been made to derive advantage from the\r\ndifferent ingredients of coal; but they are too obscure to merit\r\nparticular enumeration.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, Mr. MURDOCH presented to the Royal Society his account\r\nof the application of gas-light, and was complimented with Count\r\nROMFORD’s medal for the same.\r\n\r\nThe following statement is taken from Mr. MURDOCH’s paper.\r\n\r\n“The whole of the rooms of the cotton mill of Mr. LEE, at Manchester,\r\nwhich is I believe the most extensive in the United Kingdom, as well as\r\nits counting-houses and store-rooms, and the adjacent dwelling house of\r\nMr. LEE, are lighted with the gas from coal. The total quantity of light\r\nused during the hours of burning has been ascertained, by a comparison\r\nof shadows, (_see page 23_) to be about equal to the light which 2500\r\nmould candles, of six to the pound, would give; each of the candles with\r\nwhich the comparison was made consuming at the rate of 4-10ths of an\r\nounce (175 grains) of tallow per hour.\r\n\r\n“The gas-burners are of two kinds: the one is upon the principle of the\r\nArgand lamp, and resembles it in appearance; the other is a small curved\r\ntube with a conical end, having three circular apertures or\r\nperforations, of about a thirtieth of an inch in diameter, one at the\r\npoint of the cone, and two lateral ones, through which the gas issues,\r\nforming three divergent jets of flame, somewhat like a fleur-de-lis. The\r\nshape and general appearance of this tube has procured it, among the\r\nworkmen, the name of the cockspur burner.\r\n\r\n“The number of burners employed in all the buildings amounts to 271\r\nArgand, and 653 cockspurs, each of the former giving a light equal to\r\nthat of four candles of the description above-mentioned; and each of the\r\nlatter a light equal to two and a quarter of the same candles; making\r\ntherefore the total of the gas-light a little more than equal to that of\r\n2500 candles, six to the pound. When thus regulated, the whole of the\r\nabove burners require an hourly supply of 1250 cubic feet of the gas\r\nproduced from cannel-coal; the superior quality and quantity of the gas\r\nproduced from that material having given it a decided preference in this\r\nsituation over every other coal, notwithstanding its higher price.\r\n\r\n“The time during which the gas-light is used may, upon an average of the\r\nwhole year, be stated at least at two hours per day of 24 hours. In some\r\nmills, where there is over work, it will be three hours; and in the few\r\nwhere night work is still continued nearly 12 hours. But taking two\r\nhours per day as the common average throughout the year, the consumption\r\nin Messrs. Philips and Lee’s mill will be 1250 × 2 = 2500 cubic feet of\r\ngas per day; to produce which 700 weight of cannel-coal is required in\r\nthe retort. The price of the best Wiggan cannel-coal (the sort used) is\r\n13½_d._ per cwt. (22_s._ 6_d._ per ton) delivered at the mill, or say\r\nabout eight shillings for the seven hundred weight. Multiplying by the\r\nnumber of working days in the year (313,) the annual consumption of coal\r\nwill be 110 tons, and its cost 125_l._\r\n\r\n“About one-third of the above quantity, or say forty tons of good common\r\ncoal, value ten shillings per ton, is required for fuel to heat the\r\nretorts, the annual amount of which is 20_l._\r\n\r\n“The 110 tons of cannel-coal, when distilled, produce about 70 tons of\r\ngood coke, which is sold upon the spot at 1_s._ 4_d._ per cwt. and will\r\ntherefore amount annually to the sum of 93_l._\r\n\r\n“The quantity of tar produced from each ton of cannel-coal is from 11 to\r\n12 ale gallons, making a total annual produce of about 1250 ale gallons,\r\nwhich not having been yet sold, it cannot yet be determined its value.\r\n\r\n“The interest of the capital expended in the necessary apparatus and\r\nbuildings, together with what is considered as an ample allowance for\r\nwear and tear, is stated by Mr. LEE at about 550_l._ per annum, in which\r\nsome allowance is made for this apparatus being made upon a scale\r\nadequate to the supply of a still greater quantity of light, than he has\r\noccasion to make use of.\r\n\r\n“Mr. LEE is of opinion that the cost of attendance upon candles would be\r\nas much, if not more, than upon the gas apparatus; so that, in forming\r\nthe comparison, nothing need be stated upon that score, on either side.\r\n\r\n“The economical statement for one year, then, stands thus:\r\n\r\n  Cost of 110 tons of cannel coal                                  £ 125\r\n\r\n  Ditto of 40 tons of common ditto, to carbonise                      20\r\n                                                                    ----\r\n                                                              In all 145\r\n                                                                    ----\r\n  Deduct the value of 70 tons of coke                                 93\r\n\r\n  The annual expenditure in coal, after deducting the value of the\r\n  coke, and without allowing any thing for the tar, is therefore      52\r\n\r\n  And the interest of capital sunk, and wear and tear of apparatus   550\r\n\r\n  Making the total expence of the gas apparatus per annum, about     600\r\n\r\n“That of candles, to give the same light, would be about 2000_l._ For\r\neach candle, consuming at the rate of 4-10ths of an ounce of tallow per\r\nhour, the 2500 candles burning, upon an average of the year, two hours\r\nper day, would, at one shilling per pound, the present price, amount to\r\nnearly the sum of money above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n“If the comparison were made upon an average of three hours per day, as\r\nin most cases, would perhaps be nearer to the truth, and the tear and\r\nwear remaining nearly the same as on the former case, the whole cost\r\nwould not exceed 650_l._ while that of the tallow would be 3000_l._”\r\n\r\nMr. ACKERMAN in this metropolis, has shown that the art of gas-light\r\nillumination is not confined to great manufactories, but that its\r\nadvantages are equally applicable to those on a moderate scale. The\r\nwhole of Mr. ACKERMAN’s establishment, his public library, warehouse,\r\nprinting-offices and work-shops, together with his dwelling house, from\r\nthe kitchen to the drawing-room, has, for these four years past, been\r\nlighted with gas, to the total exclusion of all other lights. The result\r\nof the whole of this proceeding will be obvious from the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  To MR. ACCUM.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  “In answer to your request with regard to my gas-lights, which I now\r\n  have in my house, I take this mode of informing you, that I charge two\r\n  retorts with 240lbs. of coal, half cannel and half Newcastle, from\r\n  which I extract 1000 cubic feet of gas. To obtain this quantity of\r\n  gas, when the retorts are cold, I use from 100 to 110lb. of common\r\n  coals; but when they are in a working state, that is to say, when they\r\n  are once red hot, the carbonising fuel amounts to about 25lb. per\r\n  retort. The bulk of gas thus obtained supplies 40 Argand’s lamps, of\r\n  the large size, for four hours per night, during the long winter\r\n  evenings, together with eight Argand’s lamps and about 22 single\r\n  cockspur burners, for three hours per night: in addition to which my\r\n  printers employ 16 cockspur burners for ten hours per day to heat\r\n  their plates instead of charcoal fire.

All the workmen employed in my establishment consider their\r\n  gas-lights as the greatest blessing; and I have only to add, that the\r\n  light we now enjoy, were it to be produced by means of Argand’s lamps\r\n  or candles, would cost at least 350l. per annum.\r\n\r\n  I am, with respect,\r\n\r\n  Yours,\r\n\r\n  Strand, March 13,\r\n\r\n  1815.\r\n\r\n  R. ACKERMAN.”\r\n\r\n  [15] _Although cannel-coal sells at nearly double the price of\r\n  Newcastle coal, I use it in preference to the latter, because it\r\n  affords a larger portion of gas, and gives a much more brilliant\r\n  light._\r\n\r\nAnother manufacturer who was one of the first that adopted the use of\r\nthis method of illumination in the small way, and who gave a statement\r\nof its advantages to the public, is Mr. COOK, a manufacturer of metal\r\ntoys, at Birmingham, a clear-headed, prudent man, not apt to be dazzled\r\nby a fanciful speculation, but governed in his transactions by a simple\r\nbalance of profit and loss. There is a _naïveté_ in his own account of\r\nthe process which will amuse as well as instruct the reader.\r\n\r\n“My apparatus is simply a small cast-iron pot, of about eight gallons,\r\nwith a cast-iron cover, which I lute to it with sand. Into this pot I\r\nput my coal. I pass the gas through water into the gasometer or\r\nreservoir, which holds about 400 gallons; and, by means of old\r\ngun-barrels, convey it all round my shops. Now, from twenty or\r\ntwenty-five pounds of coal, I make perhaps six hundred gallons[16] of\r\ngas; for, when my reservoir is full, we are forced to burn away the\r\noverplus in waste, unless we have work to use it as it is made: but, in\r\ngeneral, we go on making and using it, so that I cannot tell to fifty or\r\na hundred gallons;--and, in fact, a great deal depends on the coals,\r\nsome coals making much more than others. These twenty-five pounds of\r\ncoal put into the retort, and say twenty-five pounds more to heat the\r\nretort, which is more than it does take one time with another, but I am\r\nwilling to say the utmost, are worth four-pence per day. From this\r\nfour-pence we burn eighteen or twenty lights during the winter season.”\r\n\r\n  [16] A wine-gallon is equal to 231 cubic inches.\r\n\r\nThus are the candles which Mr. COOK used to employ, and which cost him\r\nthree shillings a day, entirely superseded. But, besides his expence in\r\ncandles, oil and cotton for soldering, used to cost him full 30_l._ a\r\nyear; which is entirely saved, as he now does all his soldering by the\r\ngas flame only. For “in all trades in which the blow-pipe is used with\r\noil and cotton, or where charcoal is employed to produce a moderate\r\nheat, the gas flame will be found much superior, both as to quickness\r\nand neatness in the work: the flame is sharper, and is constantly ready\r\nfor use; while, with oil and cotton or charcoal, the workman is always\r\nobliged to wait for his lamp or coal getting up; that is, till it is\r\nsufficiently on fire to do his work. Thus, a great quantity of oil is\r\nalways burned away useless; but, with the gas, the moment the stop-cock\r\nis turned, the lamp is ready, and not a moment is lost.” We must refer\r\nto Mr. COOK’s letter for the details of expence, which he gives with\r\nfaithful minuteness, and always leaning to the side unfavourable to the\r\ngas. The result of the whole is, that he saves 30_l._ out of the 50_l._\r\nwhich his lights formerly cost him: and, when we consider that his\r\ncalculation allows the gas-lights to burn the whole year, and the\r\ncandles only twenty weeks, there can be little doubt, that the savings\r\nin this case follow nearly the same proportion as in the former. If the\r\napparatus be erected even on a smaller scale, “the saving,” Mr. COOK\r\nassures us, “will still be considerable: for the poor man, who lights\r\nonly six candles, or uses one lamp, if the apparatus is put up in the\r\ncheapest way possible, will find it only cost him 10_l._ or 12_l._ which\r\nhe will nearly, if not quite, save the first year.”\r\n\r\nMr. ACKERMAN having, in this town, set the example of lighting his\r\nestablishment with gas, several other individuals soon followed the\r\nattempt. The following statement will show, that this species of light\r\nmay be made use of with the greatest advantage, upon a still smaller\r\nscale, where no great nicety with regard to the apparatus for procuring\r\ngas is required. The following report I have received from Messrs.\r\nLLOYD, of Queen Street, Southwark, thimble manufacturers and\r\nwhitesmiths, who have used the gas-light for soldering and other\r\npurposes these five years past.\r\n\r\n  From 4 pecks or 1 bushel of coals, weighing 69lbs. for\r\n  which we now pay (1809) 1s. we produce 4¾ pecks of\r\n  coke and ½ peck of coal not carbonised remains in the\r\n  distilling pot, which together with the coke weighs\r\n  58lbs. 6 oz. value at 1s. per bushel                         0   1   4\r\n  we procure 6lbs. 4 oz. of tar which we use as pith--it\r\n  saves us                                                     0   1   0\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n                                                               0   2   4\r\n  Deduct for coal                                              0   1   0\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n  Profit on coke and tar                                       0   1   0\r\n                                                              ----------\r\n  The gas yielded by the 4 pecks of coals in the pot, make\r\n  42 brilliant lights, which burn 7 hours.

We are not nice\r\nconcerning the quality of the gas--a great part of it is burned from the\r\ngasometer, without allowing it to purify itself in the gasometer,\r\nbecause our gasometer is not large enough to store up the whole quantity\r\nof gas we want for use.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE PRODUCTION OF GAS-LIGHT, AND DESCRIPTION OF A PORTABLE\r\nAPPARATUS FOR EXHIBITING, IN THE SMALL WAY, THE GENERAL NATURE OF THIS\r\nSPECIES OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nTo obtain carburetted hidrogen, or coal-gas, from common pit-coal, and\r\nto apply it for the purposes of illumination, the coal is introduced\r\ninto large iron cylinders, called retorts, to the apertures of which\r\niron pipes are adapted, terminating in a vessel, or vessels, destined to\r\npurify and collect the gas. The retorts charged with coals and made\r\nair-tight, are placed upon the fire, the action of which extricates the\r\ngazeous products from the coals, together with an aqueous ammoniacal\r\nvapour, and a tenaceous bituminous fluid, or tar, &c. The liquid\r\nsubstances are conveyed into proper vessels, and the gazeous products\r\nare conducted, by means of pipes, under the gasometer, where the gas is\r\nagain washed, and remains ready for use. There are also other pipes\r\nleading from the gasometer, which branch out into smaller ramifications,\r\nuntil they terminate at the places where the lights are wanted. The\r\nextremities of the pipes have small apertures, out of which the gas\r\nissues, and the streams of gas being lighted at those apertures burn\r\nwith a clear and steady flame as long as the supply of gas continues.\r\nAll the pipes which come from the gasometer are furnished at their\r\nextremities with stop-cocks to regulate the admission of the gas. The\r\nburners are formed in various ways, either a tube ending with a simple\r\norifice, at which the gas issues in a stream, and if once lighted will\r\ncontinue to burn with the most steady and regular light imaginable, as\r\nlong as the gas is supplied; or two concentric tubes of brass, or\r\nsheet-iron, are placed at a distance of a small fraction of an inch from\r\neach other, and closed at the bottom. The gas which enters between these\r\ncylinders, when lighted, forms an Argand lamp, which is supplied by an\r\ninternal and external current of air in the usual manner. Or the two\r\nconcentric tubes are closed at the top with a ring having small\r\nperforations, out of which the gas alone can issue, thus forming\r\nsmall distinct streams of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe gas-apparatus, plate 2, will be found very convenient for\r\nexhibiting, in the small way, the general nature of this new art of\r\nillumination, whilst at the same time it may serve to ascertain, at a\r\ntrifling expence, the comparative value of different kinds of coals\r\nintended to be employed for the production of this species of light, as\r\nwell as other occasional purposes connected with the gas-light system of\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nIt consists of three distinct apparatus:--namely, a portable furnace,\r\nfig. 1, plate 2, by means of which the gas is prepared--fig. 2, a\r\npurifyer, or condenser, which separates and purifies the products\r\nobtained from the coal, so as to render the gas fit for the purpose of\r\nillumination--fig. 3, a gasometer, or reservoir for receiving and\r\npreserving the purified stock of gas, and from which it may be\r\ntransferred and distributed as occasion may require. The following\r\nstatement will explain more fully the general nature of this portable\r\nchamber apparatus:--_a_, represents a cast iron retort, such as is used\r\nfor chemical operations in the small way. This retort rests upon a\r\ntripod of hammered iron, placed upon the bars of the grate of the\r\nchemical furnace. Into this retort the coals are put for furnishing the\r\ngas. It is provided with a solid iron stopper ground air-tight into the\r\nmouth of the retort, and the stopper is secured in its place by an iron\r\nwedge passing over it in the centre; by means of which the mouth of the\r\nretort when charged with coal is readily made air-tight, and the stopper\r\nmay easily be removed by knocking out the iron wedge. _b._ is a metal\r\npipe which conveys all the distillatory products from the retort into\r\nthe purifier fig. 2. This tube is bent at right angles at the extremity\r\nwhere it enters the intermediate vessel fig. 2. The purifier fig. 2, is\r\ndivided into three compartments marked _c._ _d._ _e._ The first\r\ncompartment is filled with water, and by means of it an air-tight\r\ncommunication is established with the retort which furnishes the gas.\r\nThe second compartment, _d_, contains a solution of caustic pot-ash\r\ncomposed of about 2 parts of caustic pot-ash and 16 of water, or a\r\nmixture of quick-lime and water of the consistence of very thin cream.\r\nThe object of this compartment is to separate the non-inflammable gases\r\nand other products evolved during the distillation of the coal, from the\r\ncarburetted hidrogen or coal-gas, so as to render it fit for use. The\r\nthird compartment _e_ is left empty to receive the tar and other liquid\r\nproducts. Into the first compartment _c_, all the gazeous and liquid\r\nproducts are delivered, as they become evolved during the distillation,\r\nby means of the pipe _b_. The compartment _d_, of the purifier, or\r\nalcali vessel, is furnished with a wide perpendicular pipe, which serves\r\nto make an air-tight communication with the retort, by allowing the tube\r\n_b_, to pass readily through it. From the chamber _c_, the liquid and\r\ngazeous products pass to the tar-chamber, or compartment _e_, by means\r\nof the descending pipe _f_. The tar and other condensible substances are\r\ntherefore deposited at _e_, whilst the gazeous products alone ascend\r\nfrom the tar-chamber _e_, by the pipe _g_, and down again the pipe _h_,\r\n(which is closed at the top) into the compartment _d_, of the vessel or\r\npurifier, fig. 2. The gas being thus made to pass from the compartment\r\n_e_, up into the pipe _g_, and down the pipe _h_, (which is closed at\r\nthe top) into the purifier _d_, is brought into contact with the liquor\r\nin that vessel, where it is opposed to a pressure in proportion to the\r\nperpendicular height of the column of liquid which it contains. The\r\nfunnel in the compartment _c_, is considerably higher than the purifying\r\napparatus, it therefore allows the liquid which it contains, when\r\npressed upon by the gas, to ascend into it, without overflowing the\r\napparatus, and to descend again as the pressure diminishes--_i_ is\r\nanother wide-mouth funnel, by means of which the chamber _d_, is filled\r\nwith the alcaline solution, or mixture of lime and water. The carbonic\r\nacid gas and sulphuretted hidrogen, evolved during the distillation of\r\nthe coal, are thus made to combine with the alcali or lime, in the\r\ncompartment _d_, of the purifier, forming carbonate and hidro-sulphuret\r\nof lime. The carburetted hidrogen, being left more or less pure, is\r\nconveyed through the pipe _k_, into the gasometer, fig. 3. The\r\ncommunication of the purifier, fig. 2, with the gasometer, is made by\r\nmeans of the well-known water-valve _l_, placed so that the\r\ncommunicating tube _k_, may be easily removed at pleasure--_m_, is a\r\ncock for drawing off the tar, &c. _n_, a gauge-cock for ascertaining the\r\nheight of the liquid in the chamber _d_. The gasometer, fig. 3, the\r\nobject of which is to store up the gas, consists of two principal\r\nparts--namely, a large interior vessel designed to contain the gas, and\r\nan outer cistern or vessel, of rather greater capacity, in which the\r\nformer is suspended, designed to contain the water by which the gas is\r\nconfined. The interior vessel which contains the gas is suspended by\r\nchains or cords hung over pullies, to which weights are attached, so as\r\nto nearly equipoise it. _o_ is a pipe, which communicates with the\r\nwater-valve _l_, and by means of which the gas passes from the purifier,\r\nfig. 2, into the gasometer. The upper end of this pipe is covered, in\r\nthe manner of a hood, by a cylindrical vessel _p_, open at bottom, but\r\npartially immersed beneath the surface of the water contained in the\r\nouter cistern of the gasometer, and perforated round near the lower edge\r\nwith a number of small holes. The gas displaces the water from this\r\nreceiver _p_, and escapes through the small holes, rising in bubbles\r\nthrough the water, so as to expose a large surface to its action, that\r\nit may be properly washed, &c. After rising through the water the gas\r\nenters the gasometer, which is suspended to move up and down by the\r\nchains, pullies, and balance-weights, _q_. From the centre of the\r\ngasometer a tube, _r_, descends, which includes a pipe, _s_, fixed\r\nperpendicular from the bottom of the cistern. The fixed pipe _r_, forms\r\na guide to keep the gasometer always perpendicular. _t_ is also an iron\r\npipe made fast in the centre of the inner vessel, and communicates with\r\nthe upright tube, _s_, in the outer vessel. This contrivance obliges the\r\ngas to pass into the pipe _t_, whilst it also serves to keep the\r\ngasometer steady when nearly out of the outer cistern.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation commences, the gasometer is sunk down nearly to a\r\nlevel with the surface of the water in the outer cistern, and is\r\nconsequently filled with water; but as the gas enters, it rises up to\r\nreceive it. It is to be noted, that the balance-weights _q_ _q_, should\r\nnot be quite so heavy as the gasometer, in order that some pressure may\r\nbe exerted, to force the gas out of the burners with a proper jet. The\r\ngas which issues from the retort enters the purifier as stated already,\r\nand ascends the pipe _o_, into the vessel, _p_, from which it displaces\r\nthe water, and passes out at the small holes, as before described,\r\nrising through the water into the gasometer, and raising it up: the gas\r\nthen passes away to the burners, _u_ _u_. In this manner the process\r\nproceeds until the whole of the volatile products of the coal in the\r\nretort is evaporated. The use of the gasometer is, to equalize the\r\nemission of the gas which comes from the retort more quickly at some\r\ntime than others. When this happens, the interior vessel rises up to\r\nreceive it, and when the stream from the retort diminishes, the weight\r\nof the gasometer expels its contents. When the process is finished, the\r\nretort is suffered to cool, and its ground stopper is then removed to\r\nreplenish it with coal. The residue found in the retort is coke. _v_ _v_\r\nare cocks to let off any liquid that may collect in the pipe _o_ or _t_;\r\nfor if the smallest portion of liquid were to obstruct the free passage\r\nof the gas to the burners, the consequence would be, that the lights\r\nwould not burn steadily--they would, as it is called, _dance_, or become\r\nextinguished. _x_ is the main stop-cock which communicates with the\r\nburners--these, of course, may be placed as convenience may require. _z_\r\n_z_ are two projecting parts in the top of the gasometer; they are\r\nintended to receive the hood _p_, and the upper extremity of the pipe\r\n_t_, so as to allow the gasometer to be wholly immersed into the\r\ncistern. The wheels or pullies of the gasometer have a groove to allow\r\nthe links of the chain to pass freely.\r\n\r\nIn this apparatus there is no provision made for the unequal pressure\r\nwhich the gas suffers, accordingly as the gasometer is more or less\r\nimmersed in water. It will be observed that, in this apparatus, the\r\nweight of the interior vessel is constantly increasing, in proportion as\r\nit fills with gas, and rises out of the water, and consequently, if a\r\nconstant, uniform, counterpoising weight, equal only to that of the\r\ngasometer in the first moment of its rise, be employed, the gas becomes\r\ngradually more and more compressed by that part of the weight of the\r\ngasometer which is not counterpoised, and if its pressure or quantity be\r\nthen estimated by the bulk which it occupies, without making allowance\r\nfor the increasing pressure, a material error must arise, and this, in\r\nthe large way, would give rise to insurmountable difficulties with\r\nregard to the regulation of the size of the flames; which could not be\r\nrendered uniform.\r\n\r\nSuppose the cistern or exterior vessel full of water, and the gasometer\r\npartly filled with gas and partly with water, it is evident that the\r\nbalance-weight may be so adjusted, as to occasion an exact equilibrium,\r\nso that the external air shall not tend to enter into the gasometer nor\r\nthe gas to escape from it; and in this case the water will stand exactly\r\nat the same level both within the gasometer and within the outer\r\ncistern. On the contrary, if the balance-weights be diminished, the\r\ngasometer will then press downwards from its own gravity, and the water\r\nwill stand lower in the gasometer than it does in the cistern; in this\r\ncase, the included air or gas will suffer a degree of compression above\r\nthat experienced by the external air, exactly proportioned to the weight\r\nof a column of water, equal to the difference of the external and\r\ninternal surfaces of the water.\r\n\r\nTo compensate for this increasing weight of the gasometer, and render a\r\nscale of equal graduations accurate, some have ingeniously adopted the\r\nplan of a spiral pulley to the chain, which has the effect of gradually\r\navoiding the evil, but the best way of accomplishing it will be stated\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the philosophy or the production of coal-gas, it proves\r\nthat pit-coal contains solid hidrogen, carbon, and oxigen. When the\r\nintensity of the heat has reached a certain degree, a part of the carbon\r\nunites with part of the oxigen and produces carbonic acid, which by\r\nmeans of caloric is melted into the gazeous state and forms carbonic\r\nacid gas; at the same time, part of the hidrogen of the coal combines\r\nwith another portion of carbon and caloric, and forms the carburetted\r\nhidrogen gas, which varies considerably in its constitution, according\r\nto the circumstances under which it is produced; a portion of olifiant\r\ngas, carbonic oxid, hidrogen, and sulphuretted hidrogen, is also\r\nproduced during the process. The quantities of these products vary\r\naccording to the nature of the coal employed in the process.\r\n\r\nPit-coal is not the only substance which affords carburetted hydrogen;\r\nthis gazeous fluid may be obtained in a great variety of ways, and with\r\nvery considerable differences in specific gravity and proportion of\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nIt is found plentifully native or ready formed on the surface of\r\nstagnant waters, marshes, wet ditches, &c. through which, if examined\r\nclosely, large bubbles will be seen to rise in hot weather, and may be\r\nincreased at pleasure by stirring the bottom or mud with a stick.\r\n\r\nIn close still evenings if a lighted candle is held over the surface,\r\nflashes of blue lambent flame may sometimes be perceived spreading to a\r\nconsiderable distance. All that is not fabulous concerning the _ignis\r\nfatuus_ is probably derived from this source. This species of gas is\r\ntermed for distinction the carburetted hydrogen of marshes. In the\r\npurest form in which it can be collected it is mixed with about 20 per\r\ncent. of azot or nitrogen.\r\n\r\nTo procure the gas for the purpose of philosophical amusement, fill a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle with the water of the ditch, and keep it inverted\r\ntherein with a large funnel in its neck, then with a stick stir the mud\r\nat the bottom just under the funnel, so as to cause the bubbles of air\r\nwhich rise from the mud to enter into the bottle; when by thus stirring\r\nthe mud in various places, the air may be catched in the bottle.\r\n\r\nCarburetted hidrogen gas is also given out very abundantly by all kinds\r\nof vegetable matter when subjected to a scorching heat sufficient to\r\ndecompose them. When heated in close vessels much more gas is obtained\r\nthan when burnt in the open air. If moistened charcoal be put into an\r\nearthen retort and heat be applied till the retort becomes ignited; gas\r\nwill be evolved, consisting partly of carbonic acid, and partly of\r\ncarburetted hidrogen. A gas of similar properties is obtained by causing\r\nsteam to pass through a tube filled with red-hot charcoal; by passing\r\nspirit of wine, or camphor, through red-hot tubes; by distilling oils,\r\nwood, bones, wax and tallow, or any animal or vegetable body whatever.\r\n\r\nIndeed it would be endless to enumerate the various sources of this\r\ngazeous fluid. A most curious variety of carburetted hidrogen gas has\r\nbeen discovered by the associated Dutch chemists (VAN DIEMAN,\r\nTROOSTWYCK, and others) which is procured from ether or alcohol, and has\r\nthe remarkable property of generating a heavy oil when in contact with\r\nchlorine gas. Hence it has been termed oily carburetted hidrogen, or\r\nolifiant gas--it consists of carburetted hydrogen, supersaturated with\r\ncarbon. The oil generated is heavier than water, whitish, and\r\nsemi-transparent. By keeping, it becomes yellow and limpid; its smell is\r\nhighly fragrant and penetrating--its taste somewhat sweet--it is partly\r\nsoluble in water, imparting to it, its peculiar smell. A portion of this\r\ngas always accompanies the common carburetted hidrogen obtained from\r\ncoal, and those sorts of coal that afford the largest quantity of it are\r\nbest suited for the production of gas-light.\r\n\r\nThe nature of carburetted hidrogen obtained from coal varies\r\nconsiderably according to the conditions under which it is obtained. The\r\nfirst part is always much heavier than the last, though still lighter\r\nthan common air, and holds in solution a portion of oil, for on standing\r\nfor some time over water it becomes lighter, and is found to require\r\nless oxygen for saturation than before. The oil which it held suspended,\r\nthen becomes precipitated. The average specific gravity of the first and\r\nlast gas mixed, which may be taken as an average of the whole specific\r\ngravity is to that of common air as 2 to 3--112lb. of common cannel\r\ncoal produce at its _minimum_, from 350 to 360 cubic feet of carburetted\r\nhidrogen gas; but the same quantity of the best Newcastle coal, that is\r\nto say, such as coke, which, when laid on the fire readily undergoes a\r\nkind of semi-fusion, and sends out brilliant streams of flame, produces\r\nupon an average from 300 to 360 cubic feet of this gazeous fluid,\r\nbesides a large portion of sulphuretted hidrogen, carbonic oxid and\r\ncarbonic acid. Half a cubic foot of this carburetted hidrogen, fresh\r\nprepared, that is to say, holding in solution or suspension, a portion\r\nof the essential oil, which is generated during the evolution of the\r\ngas, is equal in illuminating power to from 170 to 180 grains of tallow,\r\n(being the quantity consumed by a candle six to the pound in one hour.)\r\nNow, one pound avoirdupoise is equal to 7000 grains, and consequently\r\none pound of candles of six in the pound, burning one at a time in\r\nsuccession, would last (if we take 175 grains of tallow to be consumed\r\nin an hour) 7000/175 = 40 hours. To produce the same light we must burn\r\none half of a cubic foot of coal-gas per hour; therefore, one-half\r\nmultiplied by forty hours is equal to twenty cubic feet of gas in 40\r\nhours, consequently equal to one pound of candles, six to the pound,\r\nprovided they were burnt one after another. One hundred and twelve\r\npounds of cannel-coal, produce, at its _minimum_, three hundred and\r\nfifty cubic feet of gas; and are equal to three hundred and fifty,\r\ndivided by twenty, which last is equivalent to one pound of tallow,\r\nmaking one hundred and twelve pounds of cannel-coal, equal to 350/20 =\r\n17½lbs. of tallow. Further, one hundred and twelve pounds of\r\ncannel-coal, divided by seventeen and a half of tallow make six and\r\nfour-tenths of cannel-coal, equal to one pound of tallow.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Newcastle coals[17], it may be stated that one chaldron\r\nof Wall’s-End coal may be made to produce in the large way upwards of\r\n11,000 cubic feet of crude gas; which, when properly purified,\r\ndiminishes to nearly 10,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n  [17] One chaldron of Newcastle coal weighs from 2850 to upwards of\r\n  2978lb.\r\n\r\nThe production of carburetted hydrogen, both with regard to quantity and\r\nquality from the same kind of coal depends much upon the degree of\r\ntemperature employed in the distillatory process. If the tar and oil\r\nproduced during the evolution of the gas in its nascent state, be made\r\nto come in contact with the sides of the red hot retorts, or if it be\r\nmade to pass through an iron cylinder or other vessel heated red hot, a\r\nlarge portion becomes decomposed into carburetted hydrogen gas and\r\nolifiant gas, and thus a much larger quantity of gas is produced than\r\nwould be obtained without such precaution from the same quantity of\r\ncoal.[18]\r\n\r\n  [18] One pound of coal-tar produces 15 cubic feet of carburetted\r\n  hidrogen abounding in olifiant gas.\r\n\r\nThe distillation of the coal, (if gas be the chief object) should\r\ntherefore not be carried on too rapidly. Most of the retorts used in the\r\nlarge way, are calculated for containing about one hundred weight of\r\ncoal, and in general, when previously heated, produce from two and\r\none-half to three cubic feet of gas, in four hours for each pound of\r\ncoal they contain; but when the layer of coals in them does not exceed\r\nfour inches in depth, three and one-half to four feet of gas may be\r\nobtained in the same time.\r\n\r\nThe retorts best calculated for large gas-light works are seven or eight\r\nfoot long (without the mouth-piece) and twelve inches in diameter,\r\ntapering down to ten inches--if they are larger the coal which they\r\ncontain cannot be heated properly. The advantages that may be derived\r\nfrom the circumstances before stated are of greater value in the\r\ngas-light manufacture than is often imagined, and the quantity as well\r\nas the quality of the gas is very much influenced by such circumstances.\r\nIf coal be distilled with a very low red heat scarcely observable by\r\ndaylight, the gas produced gives a feeble light--if the temperature be\r\nincreased so that the distillatory vessel is of a dull redness, the\r\nlight is more brilliant and of a better colour--if a bright or\r\ncherry-red heat be employed the gas produced, burns with a brilliant\r\nwhite flame, and if the heat be increased so far that the retort is\r\nalmost white hot, and consequently in danger of melting, the gas given\r\nout, has little illuminating power, and burns with a clear blueish\r\nflame;[19] or if the coal abounds in pyrites or sulphuret of iron, as is\r\nsometimes the case with Newcastle coal, a large quantity of sulphuretted\r\nhidrogen is likewise evolved, which although it increases the\r\nilluminating power of the coal-gas, has the capital disadvantage, of\r\nproducing an intolerable suffocating odour, when the gas is burnt which\r\nis particularly perceptible in low rooms illuminated with such gas.\r\n\r\n  [19] It is chiefly a mixture of carbonic oxid, and hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nThese observations also apply to the distillation of tar, which when\r\ndistilled either in a vaporous or nascent state, during its first\r\nproduction from coal in the ordinary process, or if it be submitted to a\r\nsecond distillation, mingled with a fresh portion of pit-coal, a\r\npractice usually had recourse to when this product cannot be disposed of\r\nmore advantageously. The best depth of coal in the retort for procuring\r\nexcellent gas, and at the same time for yielding the greatest quantity\r\nfrom the same weight in the shortest possible time, is about six inches.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of the coal-gas flame is rather diminished when the gas\r\nhas been long kept over water, and hence for illumination it should be\r\nused as soon as prepared, but of course properly purified.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gas taken up by water is affected by temperature,\r\nbecause the temperature increases its elasticity; the quantity of gas\r\nabsorbed, diminishes as the temperature increases, and increases as the\r\ntemperature diminishes. ½7 part of its own bulk of pure coal-gas is\r\nabsorbed by the water over which it is confined in the gazometer.\r\n\r\nThe chemical constitution of this gazeous fluid is best ascertained by\r\nburning it in a vessel of oxygen gas, over lime-water in a pneumatic\r\nreservoir, by means of a bladder and bent brass pipe. Two products are\r\nthen obtained, viz. water and carbonic acid. That water is produced, may\r\nbe shown by burning a very small stream of the gas in a long\r\nfunnel-shaped tube open at both ends. The formation of carbonic acid is\r\nevinced, by the copious precipitation of the lime-water in the foregoing\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIf carburetted hydrogen be mixed with a sufficient quantity of oxygen\r\ngas or common air and fired by the electric spark, or by any other\r\nmethod, an explosion takes place more or less violent according to the\r\nquantity of carbonaceous matter condensed in the hydrocarbonat; and the\r\nremaining gas consists of carbonic acid, together with any unconsumed\r\ngas, or excess of oxygen, whilst the water condenses in drops on the\r\nsides of the vessel. A few cubic inches of the mixed airs is as much as\r\ncan be conveniently managed at a single explosion; and when any portion\r\nof olefiant gas is present, even this quantity will endanger very thick\r\nglass jars. A very vivid red flame appears at the moment of the\r\nexplosion, and a great enlargement takes place in an instant, after\r\nwhich the bulk is suddenly reduced to much less than the original\r\nquantity. When the carbonic acid is absorbed by lime-water, if the\r\ngasses have been properly proportioned, no gazeous residue is left,\r\nexcept accidental impurities. Though carburetted hydrogen gas, is\r\nsometimes naturally produced in coal-mines, and occasionally mixes with\r\ncommon air, producing dreadful explosions, yet when coal-gas is mixed\r\nwith common air, it does not explode unless the gas be to the air as 1\r\nto 10 nearly. Such are the leading chemical habitudes of this gazeous\r\nproduct. The varieties of carburetted hydrogen gas all agree in being\r\ninflammable; but they possess this property in various degrees, as is\r\nevinced by the variable brightness of the flame which they yield when\r\nset on fire.\r\n\r\n“Messrs. SOBOLEWSKY and HORRER, of St. Petersburgh, have employed wood\r\nfor the purpose of producing carburetted hydrogen gas. The pyroligneous\r\nacid obtained in this operation, when freed from the empyreumatic oil\r\nwith which it is mixed, becomes acetous acid, and is applicable to all\r\nthe uses of vinegar. A cubic cord of wood equal to 2.133 French metres\r\n(a metre being rather more than an English yard), yields 255 Paris\r\npounds of charcoal, and 70 buckets of acid. The latter gives 30 pounds\r\nof tar, after the extraction of it 50 buckets of good vinegar remain.\r\nThe same quantity of wood furnishes 50,000 cubic feet of gas, sufficient\r\nfor the supply of 4000 lamps for five hours.”[20]\r\n\r\n  [20] See Repository of Arts, Vol. XI. No. 36, p. 341.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILITY OF THE GAS-LIGHT ILLUMINATION, WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE\r\nECONOMY.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in the preceding pages it becomes obvious,\r\nthat a substance yielding an artificial light may be obtained from\r\ncommon coal in immense quantities. The attempt to derive advantage from\r\nso valuable a discovery is surely no idle speculation. Let us therefore\r\nnow consider to what objects of public and private utility this mode of\r\nprocuring light may be applied with effect. It is obvious that coal-gas\r\nmay be preserved in a reservoir for any length of time and that it may\r\nbe conveyed by means of tubes to any distance flowing equably and\r\nregularly like water. Those, indeed, who have not seen the contrivance\r\nwill find it difficult to imagine with what ease it is managed. The gas\r\nmay be distributed through an infinity of ramifications of tubes with\r\nthe utmost facility. Near the termination of each of the tubes through\r\nwhich it flows, it is confined by a valve or stop-cock, upon turning\r\nwhich, when required to be lighted, it flows out in an equable stream\r\nand ascends by its specific levity. There is nothing to indicate its\r\npresence; no noise at the opening of the stop-cock or valve--no\r\ndisturbance in the transparency of the atmosphere--it instantly bursts\r\non the approach of a lighted taper, into a brilliant, noiseless, steady\r\nand beautiful flame. Its purity is attested by its not blacking or\r\nsoiling in the least degree the metallic orifice from which it issues,\r\nnor even a sheet of white paper, or polished surface brought in contact\r\nwith it. There is no escape of combustible matter unconsumed, which is\r\nso great a nuisance in all our common lights. The products of the\r\ncombustion are water and carbonic acid gas[21]. The accurate and elegant\r\nexperiments of Dr. W. HENRY have shewn in the most satisfactory manner,\r\nthat considerably less carbonic acid is produced by the flame of\r\ncoal-gas, than by that of oil, tallow, or wax[22], which sufficiently\r\nrefutes the absurd notions that have been circulated respecting the\r\npernicious effects of gas-lights. But if the gas from Newcastle coal is\r\nbadly prepared, or not deprived of the portion of sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\nwhich it usually contains, it then emits fiery sparks and produces a\r\nportion of sulphureous acid by virtue of the union of the oxygen of the\r\nair with the sulphur dissolved in the gas, the consequence of which is,\r\na suffocating odour, which is particularly observable in the higher\r\nstratum of the air of apartments in which the gas is burnt. Such gas\r\nlikewise tarnishes all metallic bodies--it discolours the paintings\r\neffected with metallic oxids, and always produces a suffocating odour\r\nvery noxious to health. It is freed from the sulphuretted hydrogen and\r\nmay be rendered fit for illumination by passing it repeatedly through\r\nvery dilute solutions of sub-acetate of lead, green sulphate of iron,\r\nquicklime and water, or hyper-oxymuriate of lime.\r\n\r\n  [21] The water (which passes off in imperceptible vapour) is generated\r\n  by part of the oxygen of the air uniting with part of the hydrogen,\r\n  which forms the great bulk of the coal-gas: and the carbonic acid gas\r\n  is produced by the union of another portion of the oxygen uniting with\r\n  the smaller portion of carbon, which is the other component part of\r\n  the coal-gas.\r\n\r\n  [22] 100 Cubic inches of carburetted hydrogen from coal, require for\r\n  burning 220 cubic inches of oxygen and produce 100 cubic inches of\r\n  carbonic acid--100 cubic inches of the same gas obtained from wax,\r\n  require for burning 280 cubic inches of oxygen and produce 137 cubic\r\n  inches of carbonic acid--100 cubic inches of the same gas procured\r\n  from lamp-oil, require 190 cubic inches of oxygen for burning, and\r\n  produce 124 cubic inches of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n  The following lines relating to the salubrity of the gas-light\r\n  illumination are copied from Mr. Lee’s evidence in the House of\r\n  Commons, when examined on that subject.\r\n\r\n  Question--“Is the health of your manufacturers at all affected by the\r\n  use of gas?--Answer--Not in the least, or I would not have adopted it.\r\n  I believe I explained to the Committee, that I used the gas-lights in\r\n  my own house first.”\r\n\r\n  Q. “You have not seen the smallest alteration in the health of your\r\n  workmen?--A. Not in the least, for had I seen it, it would have been a\r\n  fatal objection to it.”\r\n\r\n  Q. “And you say the same in regard to the use of the gas-lights in\r\n  your own family?--A. Certainly I do.”\r\n\r\nAs to the brilliancy of the flame, an appeal may be made to every one\r\nwho has witnessed the gas-light illumination, whether it be not superior\r\nto the best wax candle-light, or the light of Argand’s lamps.\r\n\r\nIt may be described as a rich compact flame, burning with a white and\r\nagreeable light. It is also perfectly steady, when the flame is limited\r\nto a moderate size: in large masses, it is subject to that undulation\r\nwhich is common to it with all flames of certain dimensions, and is\r\ncaused by the agitation of the surrounding atmosphere. The gas flame is\r\nentirely free from smell. The coal-gas itself certainly has a\r\ndisagreeable foetid odour before it is burnt, so has the vapour of wax,\r\noil, and tallow, as it comes from a lamp or candle newly blown out. This\r\nconcession proves nothing against the flame of gas which is perfectly\r\ninodorous, a white handkerchief, passed repeatedly through it and\r\napplied to the nose, excites no odour.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar advantage of the gas flame is, that it may be applied\r\nin any direction we please, as there is nothing to spill and the gas is\r\npropelled by a certain force which is always the same, it will burn\r\nequally well in an almost horizontal as in an upright position; and we\r\ncan thus obviate two great objections to all our artificial lights, that\r\ntheir least luminous end is directed downwards where the light is\r\ngenerally most wanted, and that a shade is cast below by the stand or\r\nsupport of the combustible matter.\r\n\r\nThe size, shape and intensity of the gas-flame may be regulated by\r\nsimply turning a stop-cock which supplies the gas to the burner. It may\r\nat command be made to burn with an intensity sufficient to illuminate\r\nevery corner of a room, or so low and dim as barely to be perceived. It\r\nis unnecessary to point out how valuable such lights may be in\r\nnurseries, stables, warehouses, in the chambers of the sick, &c.\r\n\r\nFrom the facility with which the gas-flame can be conveyed in any\r\ndirection, from the diversified application, size and shape which the\r\nflame can be made to assume, there is no other kind of light so well\r\ncalculated for being made the subject of splendid illuminations.\r\n\r\nWhere lustres are required in the middle of a room, the best mode of\r\nconducting the gas to the chandelier, is to pass the gas-pipe through\r\nthe ceiling from the room above, immediately over the lustre. This can\r\nbe easily done without injury to the apartment.\r\n\r\nWhere side-lights and chandeliers are required the tubes need never\r\nappear in sight, but may be concealed in the wall or floor of the\r\nhouse. When transparencies are wanted as decorations for halls, lobbies,\r\n&c. more than light, recesses may be filled with different coloured\r\n_media_, or paintings, and any intensity of light may be thrown on the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIf a number of minute holes are made in the end of a gas pipe, it forms\r\nas many _jets de feu_, which have a very brilliant appearance; these may\r\nsometimes be placed in the focus of a parabolic reflector. In cases\r\nwhere the light is required to be thrown to a distance, other burners\r\nare constructed upon the same principle as the Argand lamp, forming a\r\ncylinder of flame, and admitting a current of air both to the inside and\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the flame of a gas-light with the flame of a candle\r\nwhatever its size may be, it appears just as yellow and dull as the\r\nflame of a common lamp appears when compared with that of a lamp of\r\nArgand. The beautiful whiteness of gas-light never fails to excite the\r\nsurprize and admiration of those who behold it for the first time.\r\n\r\nA large edifice or manufactory lighted by gas, contrasted with one of\r\nthe same kind lighted by candles or lamps, resembles a street on the\r\nnight of a general illumination, compared with the glimmering light of\r\nits ordinary parish lamps.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of one of the parish gas-light lamps, now exhibited in the\r\nstreets of this metropolis, will bear ample testimony of this assertion;\r\nthe light of the parish gas-lamps, is to the intensity of the parish oil\r\nlamps as 1 to 12.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious applications of the gas-light illumination\r\nunquestionably consists in lighting streets, shops and houses; and let\r\nit be observed that as this is found safe and economical, it proves all\r\nthat the most ardent friends of the gas-light system can desire. For in\r\ncontending with the common mode of lighting the streets and shops, the\r\nnew lights must beat out of the market the cheapest of all artificial\r\nlights; and as it has succeeded in doing this it shews in the most\r\nsatisfactory point of view, the prodigious advantages of gas-lights when\r\ncompared with the materials of tallow and oil.\r\n\r\nThe original expence of laying the pipes for conveying the gas, together\r\nwith the cost of the machinery, is all that is required; the preparation\r\nof the gas being itself a lucrative process, no doubt will pay all its\r\nexpences besides the interest of capital, and leave a surplus of profit.\r\n\r\nIndeed the application of the coal-gas, as a substitute for tallow and\r\noil, to illuminate houses, shops, &c. is no longer problematical, a\r\nconsiderable extent of this capital, together with numerous shops and\r\nhouses being already supplied with this species of light.[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] The Liberty of Norton Falgate, as far as Bishopgate-street, is\r\n  lighted with gas-light, from the Chartered Company’s station at Norton\r\n  Falgate; and gas-light pipes are laid from that station as far as the\r\n  west end of Cheapside, and in all the streets north of that great\r\n  thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n  In the West end of the Town, the main pipes for supplying the streets\r\n  and houses with light from the Gas-Light Company, extend through the\r\n  most eligible parts; from their Establishment in Peter-street,\r\n  Westminster, along the line from Pall Mall to Temple-bar, compleatly\r\n  surrounding the parish of St. Martin’s in the Field. Main pipes are\r\n  also placed in the Hay-market, Coventry-street, Long-Acre, St.\r\n  Martin’s-lane; and in the principal parts of the parishes of St. James\r\n  and St. Ann.\r\n\r\n  In the East end of the metropolis, the gas-light _mains_ extend from\r\n  Cornhill to St. Paul’s, Wood-street, Fore-street, &c.--Consent has\r\n  also been given to the incorporated Gas-Light Company for laying their\r\n  pipes in the parish of St. Stephen’s in the Field; St. Paul\r\n  Covent-garden; St. Mary-le-Strand; St. Clement Danes; St. George’s,\r\n  Bloomsbury; St. Giles’s in the Fields; St. Andrew’s, Holborn, above\r\n  the bars; part of the parish of St. Mary-la-bonne; besides several\r\n  other districts, comprehending the whole of the city and suburbs of\r\n  Westminster.\r\n\r\nEnough therefore, has been done to prove the possibility of lighting\r\nhouses, and streets, with gas, which would have been regarded twenty\r\nyears ago as an extravagant paradox.[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] I am informed by Mr. CLEGG, the engineer of the Chartered\r\n  Gas-Light Company, under whose direction the new system of lighting is\r\n  carried on, that the total length of pipe laid down, as mains, in the\r\n  streets of London amounts already to nearly 15 miles.\r\n\r\n  In the Eastern part of London, the same Company is engaged to lay\r\n  their pipes in the principal parts of Whitechapel, Spitalfields, St.\r\n  Luke’s, and the adjoining neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n  One part of the city of London, extending from Temple-bar to the West\r\n  end of Cheapside; from Newgate-street to Holborn Bars, together with\r\n  the intervening streets, is also provided with pipes laid down by\r\n  another gas-light association, who have opened a new Establishment in\r\n  Water-lane, Fleet-street, but are unconnected with the Chartered\r\n  Company. A third company is projected in Southwark, and a fourth in\r\n  the Eastern district of London, creating by a rivalry of interest,\r\n  that laudable competition which always proves beneficial to the public\r\n  at large, and which cannot fail to accelerate the progress of this new\r\n  art of procuring light.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. John the Evangelist in this metropolis has been\r\nilluminated with gas-lights for upwards of two years: the lights\r\nemployed in this edifice is equal to 360 tallow candles eight to the\r\npound. The avenues to the House of Lords and House of Commons,\r\nWestminster-hall, Westminster-bridge; the house and offices of the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, the Mansion-house, and many other\r\nplaces, deserve to be named, as having already adopted this species of\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nAnother advantageous application of the gas-light must be the supplying\r\nof light-houses.\r\n\r\nFrom the splendour and distinguishing forms which the gas-light flame is\r\ncapable of assuming, no light is better calculated for signal-lights\r\nthan this. By means of one single furnace as much gas might readily be\r\nprocured as would furnish a flame of sufficient intensity, during the\r\nlongest winter night, exceeding in brilliancy or intensity of light any\r\nlight-house in Britain or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf every light-house round this island were possessed of a gas-light\r\nfurnace, one-half part of the enormous expence which they at present\r\nrequire would furnish a much more brilliant light. The cheapness of this\r\nlight and its efficacy for the purpose, would soon multiply the number\r\nof light-houses, and thus most essentially contribute to the security of\r\nnavigation on our coast. The gas may be made to issue from tubes by long\r\nnarrow slips, and a surface of flame produced of any given dimensions,\r\nand free from all smoke that would obscure the reflectors.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which the largest gas-light flame is instantly\r\nextinguished by shutting the stop-cock, and the readiness with which a\r\nlong line of gas catches fire by applying a lighted taper to one\r\nextremity, are properties that cannot fail to recommend it for the\r\npurposes of telegraphic communications by night. Another application of\r\nthe gas unquestionably might be the lighting of barracks, arsenals,\r\ndock-yards, and other establishments where much light is wanted in a\r\nsmall place.\r\n\r\nThe annual expence of lighting the barracks of Great Britain is said to\r\nfall little short of 50,000l. a small part of which on the new plan,\r\nwould supply them with a much purer and safer light.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the gas-lights already enumerated must of themselves,\r\njustify us in attaching great importance to the discovery, and if\r\nreduced to practice all over the kingdom, would employ a large capital\r\nin a way the most advantageous and productive. But the utility of this\r\nlight will be almost indefinitely increased to the use of private\r\nfamilies. That such an application is practicable, in all towns of Great\r\nBritain, is obvious, from what has been done already, and that it would\r\nbe highly economical and ornamental, there can be little doubt.\r\n\r\nBy means of gas we may have a pure and agreeable light at command in\r\nevery room of our house, just as we have the command of water, with this\r\nsingular advantage, that these lights may burn for hours within an inch\r\nof the most combustible substance without danger, because they neither\r\ncan burn down like a candle nor emit sparks. These properties make the\r\ngas-lights a most desirable light on board our ships of war, where\r\nsevere regulations are necessary to prevent danger from fire, which\r\nafter all are frequently evaded. The gas-light might be used in the\r\nstore-rooms, and even in the powder magazine, and the captain would\r\ncompletely command the supply of light by the possession of the key\r\nwhich opens and shuts the stop-cock. A small apparatus which may be\r\nerected at a trifling expence would be sufficient for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn shops, counting-houses, and public offices, the advantages are a\r\nwhite light, nearly equal to day-light, a warmth which almost supersedes\r\nthe use of fires, a total absence of smoke, smell, and vapour, and great\r\neconomy of labour.\r\n\r\nThe heat produced by gas-lights must be observed by every one who has\r\nhad an opportunity of attending to it in the most superficial manner,\r\nand the reason why gas-lights produce more heat than oil or candle-light\r\nwill not appear strange to our chemical readers (and who is there now\r\nthat does not know something of chemistry?) when it is considered that\r\nthe gas-light flame condenses more air than the flame of oil and tallow,\r\nand consequently must produce more heat.\r\n\r\nThe flame of gas may be produced in so large a surface, as to be applied\r\nto heat the most spacious apartments as well as to light them.\r\n\r\nIf the gas is made to issue by a circular rim of about twelve inches\r\ndiameter; it forms a sort of an Argand lamp on a great scale, and it is\r\nmanifest that a circumference of three feet of flame will heat the air\r\nvery rapidly, and with such uniformity that we need no longer be exposed\r\nto the partial heating occasioned by the strong draft of a large fire. A\r\nlamp of this description in the centre of a large room, with a very\r\nsmall fire to secure a gradual renewal of the air would enable us to\r\nenjoy the most healthful and agreeable temperature.\r\n\r\nFrom trials made on this subject, I am enabled to state, that three\r\nArgand’s lamps, consuming five cubic feet of gas per hour, are\r\nsufficient to keep a room 10 feet square at a temperature of 55° Fahr.\r\nwhen the air without doors has a temperature of freezing.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] Mr. DALTON’s method of ascertaining the comparative quantity or\r\n  effects of heat evolved during the combustion of different inflammable\r\n  gases, and other substances capable of burning with flame, as stated\r\n  in his System of Chemistry, vol. I. p. 76, deserves to be recommended\r\n  to those who are more immediately interested in this subject. The\r\n  process, which is simple, easy, and accurate, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Take a bladder of any size, (let us suppose for the sake of\r\n  illustration, the bladder to hold or to be equal in capacity to 30,000\r\n  grains of water,) and having furnished it with a stop-cock and a small\r\n  jet pipe, fill it with the combustible gas the heating power of which\r\n  is to be tried. Take also a tinned iron vessel with a concave bottom\r\n  of the same capacity, pour into it as much water as will make the\r\n  vessel and water together equal to the above stated bulk of water in\r\n  the bladder, viz. 30,000 grains. This being done, set fire to the gas\r\n  at the orifice of the pipe, and bring the point of the flame under the\r\n  bottom of the tinned vessel, and suffer it to burn there, by squeezing\r\n  the bladder till the whole of the gas is consumed. The increase of\r\n  temperature of the water in the tinned vessel being carefully noticed\r\n  before and after the experiment, gives very accurately the heating\r\n  power of the given bulk of the inflammable gas.\r\n\r\n  It was thus proved that--\r\n\r\n  Olefiant gas raises an equal volume of water     14°\r\n  Carburetted hidrogen, or coal gas                10\r\n  Carbonic oxid                                    4\r\n  Hidrogen                                         5\r\n  Spermaceti oil 10 grains burnt in a lamp raised\r\n  30,000 grains of water                           5\r\n  Tallow                                           5\r\n  Wax                                              5,75\r\n  Oil of turpentine                                3\r\n  Spirit of wine                                   2\r\n\r\nIn all processes of the arts where a moderate heat is wanted the\r\ngas-light flame will be found very advantageous--even on a large scale\r\nthis flame may be used with profit. It possesses advantages which cannot\r\nbe obtained from flaming fuel, where much nicety is required; because no\r\nfuel can be managed like the flame of coal-gas. For it is well known,\r\nthat when too little air be given to flaming fuel it produces no flame,\r\nbut sooty vapour; and if too much air be admitted to make those vapours\r\nbreak out into flame, the heat is often too violent. It is a fact, that\r\nflame, when produced in great quantity, and made to burn violently, by\r\nmixing with a proper portion of fresh air, driving it on the subject,\r\nand throwing it into whirls and eddies, thereby mixing the air with\r\nevery part of the hot vapour, produces a very intense heat.\r\n\r\nThe great power of a gas-flame does not appear when we try small\r\nquantities of it, and allow it to burn quietly, because the air is\r\nnot intimately brought into contact with it, but acts only on the\r\noutside; and the quantity of burning matter in the surface of a small\r\nflame is too minute to produce much effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut when the flame is produced in large quantity and is freely brought\r\nforward into contact and agitated with air, its power to heat bodies is\r\nimmensely increased. It is therefore peculiarly proper for heating large\r\nquantities of matter to a violent degree, especially if the contact of\r\nsolid fuel with such matter is inconvenient.\r\n\r\nAs the gas-flame may be made to assume any shape and intensity, and as\r\nthere is nothing to spill, it may be exhibited under such variety of\r\nforms and designs, as cannot fail to give rise to the most tasteful\r\nornamental illumination.\r\n\r\nPLATES III. IV. and V. exhibit such designs of different kinds of\r\ngas-lamps, chandeliers, lustres, candelabras, &c. as are already in use\r\nin this Metropolis.\r\n\r\nPLATE III. fig. 1, represents a _Rod Lamp_. The gas passes through the\r\nrod _a_, to the Argand burner, which is surrounded by a cylindrical\r\nchimney, _c_, swelling out at the lower extremity. The construction of\r\nthe Argand burner we have mentioned already, _p._ 78.\r\n\r\nIn all the gas-light burners, constructed on Argand’s plan, care should\r\nbe taken that the flame be in contact with the air on all sides, and\r\nthat the current of air be directed towards the upper extremity of the\r\nflame. This may be effected by causing a current of air to rise up\r\nperpendicular from the bottom of the chimney glass, and to pass out\r\nagain through the contracted part, or upper extremity of the chimney;\r\nbut no other current of air should ever be permitted to come near the\r\ngas-flame, or enter the glass chimney which covers or defends the light;\r\nfor if more air be permitted to mix with the flame than is sufficient\r\nfor the compleat combustion of the coal-gas, it necessarily diminishes\r\nthe heat, and consequently reduces the quantity of light.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. _A Rod Gas Lamp, with branches._ The gas passes through the\r\nhollow rod, _a_, and part of the hollow branch, _b_, to the burner of\r\nthe lamp. The cylindrical shaped glass, _c_, exhibited in this figure,\r\nis not so well adapted for the compleat combustion of coal-gas, as the\r\nbelly-shaped chimney, _c_, represented in fig. 1, 3, 5, 6, because the\r\nascending current of fresh air is not turned out of its perpendicular\r\ncourse, and thrown immediately in a concentrated state, into the upper\r\npart of the flame where the combustion of the gas is less perfect. The\r\nexterior current of air which enters at the bottom into the lamp, rises\r\nmerely with a velocity proportioned to the length of the cylinder, and\r\nto the rarefaction of the air in the same, but without being propelled\r\nto the apex of the flame, as it should do, and is made to do, in the\r\nbellied glass adapted to the lamp, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 3. _A Bracket Lamp._ _a_, the tube which conveys the gas to the\r\nburner; _b_, the stop-cock of the tube.\r\n\r\nFig. 4. _A Pendent Rod Lamp_; in which the gas is supposed to come from\r\na pipe above, through the ceiling, into the pipe, _a_, to supply the\r\nburners.

In whatever state the coal may be when\r\nintroduced into the retort, the coke is uniformly taken out in large\r\nmasses, so that the refuse coal, or dust, and sweepings of the pit,\r\nwhich are now thrown away, may be employed and converted into an\r\nexcellent fuel. Coke is decidedly superior to coal for all domestic, and\r\nmore especially for culinary purposes; the heat which it throws out\r\nbeing more uniform, more intense, and more durable. No flame, indeed,\r\naccompanies it, and it seldom needs the application of the poker,--that\r\nspecific for the _ennui_ of Englishmen; but these deficiences are more\r\nthan balanced by the valuable property of emitting no sparks, of giving\r\nmore heat, and burning free from dust and smoke.\r\n\r\n  [27] The preparation of coke is as follows:--A quantity of large coal\r\n  is placed on the ground in a round heap, of from 12 to 15 feet in\r\n  diameter, and about two feet in height; as many as possible of the\r\n  large pieces are placed on their ends, to form passages for the air;\r\n  above them are thrown the smaller pieces and coal dust, and in the\r\n  midst of this circular heap, is left, a vacancy of a foot wide where a\r\n  few faggots are deposited to kindle it. Four or five apertures of this\r\n  kind are formed round the ring, particularly on the side exposed to\r\n  the wind; there is, however, seldom occasion to light it with wood,\r\n  for other masses being generally on fire, the workmen most frequently\r\n  use a few shovels of coal already burning, which acts more rapidly\r\n  than wood, and soon kindles the surrounding pile; as the fire spreads,\r\n  the mass increases in bulk, puffs up, becomes spongy and light, cakes\r\n  into one body, and at length loses its volatile parts, and emits no\r\n  more smoke. It then acquires an uniform red colour, inclining a little\r\n  to white, in which state it begins to break into gaps and chinks, and\r\n  assumes the appearance of the under part of a mushroom; at this moment\r\n  the heap must be quickly covered with ashes, of which there is always\r\n  a sufficient provision around the numerous fires, where the coke is\r\n  prepared.\r\n\r\nThat coke must give out more heat during its combustion than coal, will\r\nat once become obvious, when we consider that the quantity of matter\r\nwhich, in the combustion of coal is changed from a solid to a state of\r\nelastic fluidity, must necessarily carry off a portion of caloric,\r\nwhich then becomes converted in a latent state without producing heat,\r\nwhilst the glow of the coke radiates caloric with an intensity\r\nunimpaired by any demand of this kind.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that coke, though somewhat more difficult of ignition than\r\ncommon coal, always gives out a more steady, a more lasting, and a more\r\nintense heat.\r\n\r\nThe only inconveniences that attend the use of coke is, that, as it\r\nconsumes, it leaves much more ashes than common coal, charcoal, or wood;\r\nand these much heavier too, which are, therefore, liable to collect in\r\nsuch quantity as to obstruct the free passage of air through the fire;\r\nand further, that when the heat is _very intense_, these ashes are\r\ndisposed to melt or vitrify into a tenacious drossy substance, which\r\nclogs the grate, the sides of the furnace and the vessels. This last\r\ninconvenience is only troublesome, however, when the heat required is\r\nvery great. In ordinary heats, such as are produced by kitchen or\r\nparlour grates, the ashes do not melt, and though they are more copious\r\nand heavy than those of charcoal or wood, they do not choke up the\r\nfire, unless the bars of the grate be too close together.\r\n\r\nThe relative effects of heat produced by coke and coal are as follows:--\r\n\r\nSix hundred pounds of pit-coal are capable of evaporating 10 cubic feet\r\nof water in 20 hours, and 430lb. of coke are capable of evaporating 17\r\ncubic feet of water in 12 hours and a half.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] In order to learn the relative effect of different kinds of fuel,\r\n  with regard to their capability of producing heat, chemistry teaches\r\n  that equal quantities of fuel alike expended, will raise the\r\n  temperature of a given quantity of water through the same number of\r\n  degrees; whence, by knowing the original quantity and temperature of\r\n  water, together with the quantity of fuel expended to raise the water\r\n  to the boiling point, the result sought may be expressed by stating\r\n  the quantity of water at 30 degrees, which would have been raised 180\r\n  degrees by one pound of the fuel employed; or in the form of a rule,\r\n\r\n  Multiply the quantity of water by the number expressing the degrees\r\n  actually raised; multiply the number of pounds of fuel expended by 180\r\n  degrees. Divide the first product by the latter, and the quotient will\r\n  express the water which would have been raised 180 degrees by one\r\n  pound of the fuel. Or equal quantities of water may be compleatly\r\n  evaporated under equal surfaces and circumstances, with the different\r\n  kinds of fuel, the nature of which is to be examined; the quantities\r\n  of fuel expended for that purpose give the relative effect of the\r\n  different kinds of fuel, with regard to their power of producing\r\n  heat.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dundonald has shown that, in the application for burning\r\nlime, a quantity of coke uniformly burns a given portion of lime-stone\r\nin one-third part of the time that the quantity of coal from which the\r\ncoke had been made could do.\r\n\r\nThis effect is to be accounted for from having previously freed the\r\ncoal, or rather its coke, from the moisture and the tar, which it sends\r\nout during combustion, and which condenses on the middle and upper\r\nstrata of stratified limestone and coal in the lime kiln, and impedes\r\nthe whole mass of materials from coming into a rapid and compleat\r\nignition; because the greater the quantity of materials, and the sooner\r\nthe whole is ignited, the better and more economically the lime is\r\nburned, both as to coals and time; the saving of which last is a\r\nmaterial object, especially at lime-kilns where there is in the summer\r\ntime a great demand for lime, the coke occasioning the kilns to hold a\r\n_third more lime_ at the _same time_.\r\n\r\nIn the art of making bricks, in the smelting of metallic ores, and the\r\ndrying of malt, the advantages of coke over coal, are sufficiently\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe following account given by Mr. Davis,[29] shows that the advantages\r\nthat may be derived in the processes of burning lime, plaster of paris,\r\nand bricks, by means of coke, are greater than at first sight might be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n  [29] Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 33, p. 435.\r\n\r\n“The coke obtained in the gas process is so valuable, that it appears\r\ninexplicable that men should not avail themselves of this mode of\r\nprocuring light, to the almost total exclusion of all other methods now\r\nin use. As a landholder, placed among an industrious but wholly\r\nilliterate society of men, I have had the more opportunity of trying\r\nthis species of fuel or coke, which I could not otherwise procure in\r\nthis sequestered spot, at a tolerably cheap rate, for purposes to which\r\nit has not, as far as I know, been hitherto employed. I must tell you\r\nthat I am my own lime-burner, plaster of paris baker, and brick-maker;\r\nand that in these processes of rural economy I have derived the greatest\r\nbenefits from this species of fuel, which I now prepare at a cheap rate,\r\nalthough I waste almost the whole of the light of the coal gas\r\nintentionally. The coal which I employed formerly for the burning of\r\nlimestone into lime, is a very inferior kind of small coal, called here\r\nWelsh culm. The kiln for burning the limestone into lime is a cup-shaped\r\nconcavity, surrounded with solid brick-work, open at the top, and\r\nterminating below by an iron grate. It has a stone door that may be\r\nopened and closed for charging and emptying the furnace when required.\r\nThis furnace I formerly charged with alternate strata or layers of small\r\ncoal and limestone, the latter being broken previously into pieces not\r\nlarger than a man’s fist, until the kiln was completely filled. The\r\nstone is thus slowly decomposed; the upper part of the charge descends,\r\nand when it has arrived at the bottom of the furnace new strata are\r\nsuper-imposed, so as to keep the furnace continually full during a\r\nperiod of 50 hours. The quantity of lime I procured with small coal\r\nformerly amounted to 85 bushels. The strata of coal necessary for the\r\nproduction of this quantity of lime require to be four inches thick, and\r\nthe time necessary for calcination was, as stated already, 50 hours.\r\n\r\n“On applying coke instead of coal, the produce of lime may be increased\r\nto nearly 30 per cent. from the same furnace, and the time required to\r\neffect the calcination of this quantity of lime-stone is reduced to 39\r\nhours: it also requires _less attendance_ and _less labour_, and the\r\nwhole saving, thus accomplished, amounts to more than 50 _per cent. on\r\nthe lime-kiln_.\r\n\r\n“I have lately also employed coke for the burning of bricks. My bricks\r\nare burnt in clamps, made of bricks themselves. The place for the fuel,\r\nor fire-place, is perpendicular, about three feet high. The flues are\r\nformed by gathering or arching the bricks over, so as to leave a space\r\nbetween each of a brick’s breadth; and as the whole of the coal, if this\r\nfuel be employed, must, on account of the construction of the pile, be\r\nput in at once, the charge of the bricks is not, and never can be, burnt\r\nproperly throughout; and the interference of the legislature, with\r\nregard to the measurement of the clamp, is a sufficient inducement for\r\nthe manufacturer to allow no more space for coal than he can possibly\r\nspare.\r\n\r\n“If coke be applied instead of coal, the arches, or empty spaces in the\r\nclamp or pile, as well as the strata of the fuel, may be considerably\r\nsmaller: the heat produced in this case is more uniform and more\r\nintense, and a saving of 30 per cent. at least is gained.\r\n\r\n“In the baking my own plaster-stone I also employ coke. The calcination\r\nof the stone for manure I perform in a common reverberatory furnace, and\r\nthe men who conduct the process (who are otherwise averse to every thing\r\nnew) are much pleased with the steadiness of the fire, and little\r\nattendance which the process requires, when coke is used instead of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n“These are the few facts I wish to state, with regard to the useful\r\napplication of this species of fuel, which, no doubt, hereafter will\r\nbecome an object of economy of incalculable advantage to individuals, if\r\nits nature be better understood than it is at present.”\r\n\r\nThe quantity of coke obtainable from a given quantity of coal varies\r\naccording to the nature of the coal employed. One chaldron of Newcastle\r\ncoal produced, upon an average, in the gas-light manufacture, from one\r\nchaldron and a quarter to one chaldron and a half of well formed coke.\r\nIf the carbonization of the coal has been carried to its utmost point,\r\nthe coke produced, has a brilliant silvery lustre. Such coke is\r\nexcellent for metallurgical operations, because it stands the powerful\r\nblast of the bellows, but for culinary and other purposes of domestic\r\neconomy, the carbonization should not be carried so far, because, the\r\ncoke then produced, kindles more readily and makes a more cheerful fire.\r\n\r\n_Coal-tar_, _Oil_, and _Pitch_.--Another, valuable product obtainable\r\nfrom pit-coal, is coal-tar.[30] This substance is deposited, in the\r\npurification of the coal-gas, in a separate vessel destined to receive\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  [30] In the year 1665, Becher, a German chemist, brought to England\r\n  his discovery for extracting tar from coal, this distillation he\r\n  performed in close vessels. It is not mentioned in the records of the\r\n  time, whether Becher obtained, or rather collected, any other articles\r\n  than the tar.\r\n\r\nThe coal-tar is so called from its resembling common tar in its\r\nappearance, and most of its qualities.\r\n\r\nSeveral works have been, at different times, erected both in England and\r\non the continent, to procure from coal a substitute for tar; but they\r\nturned out unprofitable speculations. In 1781, the Earl of Dundonald\r\ninvented a mode of distilling coal in the large way, which enabled him\r\nnot only to form coke, but, at the same time, to save and collect the\r\ntar. Even this process however, for which a patent was taken out, has\r\ngained very little ground. Its object was still too limited; for though\r\nsome of the ingredients of coal were procured, they were procured at an\r\nexpense that nearly balanced the profits; and no attention whatever was\r\npaid to the coal gas, which constitutes the most important part of coal.\r\n\r\nCoal-tar may be used with advantage for painting and securing wood that\r\nis exposed to the action of air or water. The wood being warmed, the tar\r\nis applied cold, and penetrating into the pores, gives the timber an\r\nuncommon degree of hardness and durability.\r\n\r\nOne chaldron of Newcastle coal produces in the gas-light manufacture\r\nfrom 150 to 180lb of tar, according to the circumstances under which it\r\nis produced. See page 94.\r\n\r\nThe tar obtained from Newcastle coal-tar is specifically heavier than\r\nthat produced from cannel-coal; hence it sinks in water, whereas the\r\nlatter swims on the surface of that fluid.\r\n\r\nTo render the tar fit for use, it requires to be evaporated to give it a\r\nsufficient consistence. If this process be performed in close vessels,\r\na portion of an essential oil is obtained, which is known to colourmen\r\nby the name of oil of tar. To obtain this oil, a common still is filled\r\nwith the coal-tar, and, being properly luted, the fire is kindled and\r\nkept up very moderate, for the tar is very apt to boil up in the early\r\npart of the process. The first product that distils over is principally\r\na brown ammoniacal fluid, mixed however with a good deal of oil. As the\r\nprocess advances, and the heat is increased, the quantity of ammoniacal\r\nliquor lessens, and that of oil increases, and towards the end of the\r\ndistillation the product is chiefly oil.\r\n\r\nThe oil and ammoniacal water which distil over do not mix, so that they\r\nmay be easily separated by decantation. The oil is a yellowish inferior\r\nkind of oil of turpentine, which is very useful in painting ships, for\r\nmaking varnishes, and other coarse out-door work.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred pounds of tar produce, upon an average, fifty-three pounds\r\nof essential oil.\r\n\r\nIf the coal-tar is wanted to be converted into pitch, without obtaining\r\nthe oil which it is capable of furnishing, the evaporation of it may be\r\nperformed in a common boiler; but as it is extremely liable to boil\r\nover, the greatest precaution is necessary in conducting the\r\nevaporation. A boiler constructed on the following plan is very\r\nconvenient for the conversion of coal-tar into pitch. The contrivance\r\nconsists in adding a spout, or rim, to the common boiler, into which the\r\ntar spreads itself as it rises, and by this means becomes cooled, and\r\nthe boiling over is checked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kettle for boiling Tar._]\r\n\r\n1000lb. of coal-tar produce, upon an average, from 460 to 480lb. of\r\npitch. A subsequent fusion, with a gentle heat, converts the coal-pitch\r\ninto a substance possessing all the characters of _asphaltum_.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal Fluid._--The properties of the ammoniacal liquor, which\r\naccompanies the tar, and which is deposited in the tar-cistern, has not\r\nyet been fully investigated. It is employed already in the manufacture\r\nof muriate of ammonia (sal ammoniac). One chaldron of coal affords from\r\n220 to 240lb. of this ammoniacal fluid, which is composed chiefly of\r\nsulphate, and carbonate of ammonia.--Such are the products obtainable\r\nfrom coal.\r\n\r\nHowever certain the practicability of extending the new lights to the\r\ndwelling houses of every town and village is, it cannot be expected that\r\nsuch an event should take place speedily and generally. To eradicate\r\nprejudice, and to alter established habits, is a work which nothing but\r\ntime can effect; because prejudice is the effect of habit, and can\r\nseldom be eradicated from the minds of such individuals as consider the\r\nready occurrence of a proposition as a test of its truth. To establish a\r\nnew philosophical theory has, in every instance, required time\r\nsufficient to educate an entire generation of men. The rejection of the\r\nAristotelian philosophy--the adoption of experimental research--the\r\nsubstitution of the doctrine of gravitation instead of that of vortices,\r\nand the rejection of phlogiston by modern chemists, are sufficiently\r\nillustrative of this assertion. New arts, and new practices, are still\r\nmore difficult to be introduced. The new art of bleaching need merely be\r\nmentioned to prove this assertion. The new grammar--the new rudiments of\r\nscience--the new stile--or the new instrument, however superior to the\r\nold in simplicity, facility, and truth, must be less valuable to the\r\nordinary teacher or artisan, whose memory is familiarized with the\r\nprecepts of the latter, and whose only ambition is to earn his\r\nsubsistence with the least possible exertion.\r\n\r\nThe slowness with which improvements of every kind, make their way into\r\ncommon use, and especially such discoveries as are most calculated to be\r\nof an extended or general utility is very remarkable, and forms a\r\nstriking contrast to the extreme avidity with which those unmeaning\r\nchanges are adopted, which folly and caprice are continually sending\r\nforth into the world under the auspices of _fashion_.\r\n\r\nOn the first view of the subject it appears very extraordinary, that any\r\nperson should neglect, or refuse to avail himself of a proposed\r\ninvention, or improvement, which is evidently calculated to economise\r\nhis labour, and to encrease his comforts; but when we reflect on the\r\npower of habit, and consider how difficult it is for a person even to\r\nperceive the disadvantages or imperfections of former modes to which he\r\nhas been accustomed from his early youth, our surprize will be\r\ndiminished, or vanish altogether.\r\n\r\nMany other circumstances, besides prejudice, are unfavourable to the\r\nintroduction of new and useful discoveries. Among these jealousy,\r\nmalice, envy, and revenge, have too often their share in obstructing the\r\nprogress of real improvement, and in preventing the adoption of plans\r\nevidently calculated to promote the public good.\r\n\r\nA plan like the present, which proposes not only to trench upon domestic\r\nhabits, but to give an entire new direction to a portion of the skill\r\nand capital of the country, must necessarily encounter the most\r\nstrenuous opposition. It is thus that some individuals have mustered all\r\ntheir strength against the introduction of this new art. An endeavour\r\nhas been made to move the public opinion by dismal forebodings of the\r\nGreenland trade, and the subsequent loss of a nursery of British seamen.\r\nThis objection is nothing more than the common clamour that is always\r\nset up against every new means of abridging labour, to which had the\r\npublic listened, an interdict would have been laid upon the spinning and\r\nthreshing machines, the steam engine, and a thousand other improvements\r\nin machinery.\r\n\r\nIndeed such clamour scarcely ever fails to be made when the extension of\r\nmachinery and the abridgement of labour or the application of inanimate\r\npowers are considered. On such occasions, it is stated by certain humane\r\nbut mistaken objectors, that the scheme of mechanical and chemical\r\nimprovement is pointed against the human species--that it tends to drive\r\nthem out of the system of beneficial employment--that the introduction\r\nof machinery is injurious to the labouring class of society, by\r\nabridging their work. Two creatures offer themselves for employment and\r\nsupport--a man and a horse. I must invariably prefer the latter, and\r\nleave the former to starve. Two other beings--a horse and a\r\nsteam-engine, are candidates for my favour. My preference to the latter\r\ntends to exterminate the species of the former. In both cases it is\r\nstated, that the number of intelligent creatures capable of the\r\nenjoyment of happiness must be diminished for want of support; and that,\r\non the whole, the sum of the proposed improvement is not only a less\r\nproportion of good to society, but a positive accession of misery to the\r\nunemployed poor.\r\n\r\nOn this wide and extended argument, which can in fact be maintained\r\nagainst all improvements whatever in no other way than by insisting that\r\nthe savage state of man, with all its wants, its ignorance, its\r\nferocity, and its privations, is preferable to the social intercourse of\r\neffort and division of labour we are habituated to prefer, it may be\r\nsufficient to observe that it includes matter not only for reasoning and\r\ninduction, but also for experiment. By reference to the matter of fact,\r\nthough it must be allowed that new improvements, which change the habits\r\nof the poor, must at first expose them to a temporary inconvenience and\r\ndistress, against which, in fairness, it is the duty of society to\r\ndefend them; yet the invariable result of such improvements is always to\r\nbetter the condition of mankind. A temporary inconvenience to\r\nindividuals must often be incurred for the sake of general national\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nIt is to manufactories carried on by machinery and to the abridgment of\r\nlabour, that this country is indebted for her riches, her independence\r\nand pre-eminent station among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the subject.--The progress of the new mode of\r\nlighting with coal-gas can never wholly supersede the use of candles and\r\nmoveable lights. The objection with regard to the Greenland trade is\r\nequally futile. This traffic, might with more propriety be called a\r\ndrain, than a nursery, of the naval force. The nature of the Greenland\r\nservice requires that the crew should consist chiefly of able-bodied\r\nsailors; and being protected men, not subject to the impress law, they\r\nare thus rendered useless for national defence. The nursery of British\r\nseamen is the coasting trade; and if the gas-light illumination be put\r\nin practice to a large extent, it will increase that trade as much as it\r\nwill diminish the Greenland fishery.\r\n\r\nEven on the extreme supposition that it would annihilate the Greenland\r\nfisheries altogether, we should have no reason to regret the event. The\r\nsoundest principles of political economy must condemn the practice of\r\nfitting out vessels to navigate the polar seas for oil, if we can\r\nextract a superior material for procuring light at a cheaper rate from\r\nthe produce of our own soil.\r\n\r\nIndeed the fisheries will find ample encouragement, and the consequence\r\nof lighting our streets with gas can prove injurious only to our\r\ncontinental friends, one of whose staple commodities, tallow, we shall\r\nthen have less occasion to purchase.\r\n\r\nThere will be less waste indeed, but a greater consumption of coal. The\r\nlower classes of the community are at present very scantily supplied\r\nwith firing; and nothing but a reduction of price is necessary to\r\nincrease to a very large amount the whole average quantity of fuel\r\nconsumed in the country. The lightness of the coke produced in the\r\ngas-light manufacture diminishing the expence of land carriage, will\r\nfacilitate its general diffusion--the comforts of the poor will be\r\nmaterially augmented, and a number of useful operations in agriculture\r\nand the arts be carried on, which are now checked and impeded by the\r\nprice of fuel.\r\n\r\nIf any additional want were wanted for the coke it will readily be\r\nfound in the continental market; coke being much better suited than coal\r\nto the habits of most European nations.\r\n\r\nThe gas-light illumination cannot tend to diminish the coal-trade; on\r\nthe contrary it will prove beneficial to it; it will contribute to lower\r\nthe price of the superior kinds of coal, and keep a level which cannot\r\nbe shaken under any circumstances; it will contribute to prevent\r\ncombinations which do certainly operate to the prejudice of the public,\r\nand do sometimes put this great town at the mercy of particular\r\nproprietors in the north, who deal out coal in the way they please. The\r\ncompetition thus produced, it is impossible not to consider as an\r\nadvantage, which would prevent in future such combinations, and put\r\nthose in London out of the reach of them.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy observation, that the annual importation of coal into this\r\nMetropolis, is above one million and eighty-eight thousand\r\nchaldrons.[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] To give an idea how long there is a probability of Great Britain\r\n  being applied with coal from the rivers Tyne and Wear only, it must be\r\n  observed,\r\n\r\n  _1st_. That the Seams of coal which are now worked at Newcastle and\r\n  Sunderland, are equal to a seam or bed of 15 miles by 20 miles.\r\n\r\n  _2dly_. That this seam, on an average, is at least four feet and a\r\n  half thick.\r\n\r\n  _3dly_, That 1-6th part of the above extent is sufficient for pillars\r\n  to support the roofs of the mines, &c.\r\n\r\n  And, _4thly_, It appears, by experiments, that a cubic yard of coal\r\n  weighs 1 ton, or 20 cwt.\r\n\r\n                                                        London Chaldrons\r\n\r\n  The total consumption of coal from the rivers Tyne\r\n  and Wear known from the register to be                  2,300,000\r\n\r\n  The number of tons in the above quantity taking the\r\n  London chaldron at 27 cwt. is                           3,100,000\r\n\r\n  Now a ton weight of coal is estimated to occupy in\r\n  the earth the space of one cubic yard.\r\n\r\n  The number of cubic yards in the square mile is         3,097,600\r\n\r\n  The beds or seams of coal are, on an average, 4\r\n  feet and a half in thickness, which increases the\r\n  above number of cubic yards in the square mile by\r\n  half the number of square yards to                      1,548,800\r\n\r\n  And hence the square mile of the beds or seams of\r\n  coal we are describing contains, of cubic yards\r\n  and tons of coal                                        4,645,000\r\n\r\n  A deduction of 1-6th for pillars to support the\r\n  mine, &c.                                                 800,000\r\n\r\n  The number of tons per square mile                      5,445,000\r\n\r\n  We have already mentioned the length and breadth of the seams of coal\r\n  to be equal to 20 miles by 15, making an area of 300 square miles, and\r\n  consequently a source of consumption for 375 years.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to the universality of our conclusion, that the price\r\nof coals, differing very much in different places, will occasion a\r\nvariation in the expence of the new mode of illumination. But there are\r\ntwo reasons why this should have less place, because we find, in Mr.\r\nMurdoch’s statement, page 69, that of 600l. the estimated yearly expence\r\nof lighting the cotton mill, 550l. consist of interest of capital, and\r\ntear and wear of apparatus, leaving the cost of coal only 50l. a sum so\r\ntrifling, when we reflect that it replaces 2000l. worth of candles, that\r\nthe price of coal, even where it is highest, can but slightly affect the\r\ngeneral profits.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] See, also, Mr. Ackermann’s statement, page 71.\r\n\r\n_2dly_, The coal, by yielding the gas and other products,--namely, tar,\r\npitch, ammoniacal liquor, &c. of which we have treated already, is\r\nconverted into a substance, increased in bulk, and in the power of\r\nproducing heat, namely, coke; and as a manufactory generally requires\r\nheating as well as lighting, there will be a gain both ways. The\r\nmanufacturer, by distilling his coal, instead of burning it as it comes\r\nfrom the pit, will save his candles and improve his fuel. One effort at\r\nthe outset, in erecting a proper apparatus, will reduce his annual\r\ndisbursement, for these two articles of prime necessity, much in the\r\nsame manner, (though in a far greater degree) as the farmer gains by\r\nbuilding a thrashing machine and laying aside the use of the flail.\r\n\r\nThe principal expence in the pursuit of this branch of civil and\r\ndomestic economy is therefore the dead capital employed in erecting the\r\nmachinery destined for preparing and conveying the gas; the floating or\r\nlive capital is comparatively small. At the same time, were we to offer\r\nan advice to the public on this subject, it would be, that no private\r\nindividual resident in London should attempt to light his premises for\r\nthe sake of economy with coal-gas by means of his own apparatus, whose\r\nannual expence for light does not exceed 60l. because the expence of\r\nerecting and attending a small apparatus is almost as great as one\r\nconstructed on a larger scale would be. For if the quantity of gas\r\nwanted is not sufficient to keep the retorts continually in a red-hot or\r\nworking state, the cost of the gas will be considerably enhanced;\r\nbecause either the empty retorts must be continued red-hot, or the fire\r\nmust be suffered to go out; and the retorts, when cold, cannot be\r\nbrought to a working state, that is to say, be made red hot again, but\r\nat a considerable expence of fuel, which must be wasted to no purpose.\r\nWhereas, if the retorts are constantly kept red hot and in action, one\r\nhalf of the coal necessary to produce a given quantity of gas will then\r\nbe saved. But when a street, or a small neighbourhood is wanted to be\r\nlighted, and the retorts can always be kept in a working state, that is\r\nto say, red hot, the operation may be commenced with safety; because the\r\nsum required for erecting the apparatus, and the labour attending it,\r\ntogether with the interest of money sunk, will then soon be liquidated\r\nby the light which it will afford.\r\n\r\nIndividuals, therefore, may engage in the distillation of coal, and\r\ntrade with advantage in the articles produced by that process, and the\r\nlighting of cities may be accomplished without the aid of incorporated\r\nbodies; and parishes may be lighted by almost as many individuals as\r\nthere are streets in a parish.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments, made by Mr. CLEGG, on the effects produced by a number\r\nof gas-lights, of a certain intensity, there is reason to believe that\r\nthe streets of small towns might be illuminated at a cheaper rate, by\r\nmeans of a tower, or pagoda, furnished with gas-lamps, than can be done\r\nin the ordinary way by street lamps: the gas being conducted to the top\r\nof the building from the apparatus below, and the light directed down\r\nagain, upon the objects to be illuminated, by means of reflectors placed\r\nat a certain angle. By this contrivance, all the main pipes which convey\r\nthe gas through the streets, as well as those collateral ones that\r\nbranch out from them to the street lamps, would be saved, and thus\r\ncompensate for the expense of the tower.\r\n\r\nThe most beneficial application of gas-lights unquestionably is in all\r\nthose situations where a great quantity of light is wanted in a small\r\nplace: and where light is required to be most diffused, the advantages\r\nof this mode of illumination are the least.--Hence, as already stated,\r\nthe lighting of the parish, or street-lamps only, without lighting shops\r\nor houses, can never be accomplished with economy.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed before the reason why the price of coals can have little\r\neffect upon the gas-light; because the very refuse, or small coals,\r\ncalled slack, which pass through the screen at the pit’s mouth, and\r\nwhich cannot be brought into the market--nay, even the sweepings of the\r\npit, which are thrown away, may be employed for the production of\r\ncoal-gas. It makes no difference in what form the coal is used, and this\r\ncircumstance may contribute to enable the coal-merchant to furnish coals\r\nin larger masses, and as they come from the mine, instead of increasing\r\nthe bulk by breaking them into a smaller size,[33] which is a practice\r\ncommonly adhered to. This unquestionably reduces the value of coals;\r\nbecause the quantity of radiant heat generated in the combustion of a\r\ngiven quantity of any kind of fuel depends much upon the management of\r\nthe fire, or upon the manner in which the fuel is consumed. When the\r\nfire burns bright, much radiant heat will be sent off from it; but when\r\nit is smothered up, very little will be generated: most of the heat\r\nproduced will then be expended in giving elasticity to a thick dense\r\nvapour, or smoke, which is seen rising from the fire; and the combustion\r\nbeing very incomplete, the carburetted hidrogen gas of the coal being\r\ndriven up the chimney without being inflamed, the fuel is wasted to\r\nlittle purpose.\r\n\r\n  [33] It is not generally apprehended, how very wasteful the use of\r\n  small coals is in the ordinary open fire-grates. Necessity makes us\r\n  use the poker very much, particularly, when the coals are small; and\r\n  habit prevails even when they are large. By the constant stirring of\r\n  the fire almost the whole of the small coal passes through the bars;\r\n  and consequently a great deal goes to the dust-hole without being\r\n  burnt at all. To prove this, we need only take a shovel full of ashes\r\n  and put them into a pail, and then pouring water over them, which\r\n  being gently run off, will carry away nearly all the light and burnt\r\n  parts: and leave an astonishing quantity of bright unburnt coal, which\r\n  has escaped from the fire-place, in consequence of being small.\r\n\r\n  When the grate of the fire-place is large, and the small coals are\r\n  thrown behind; or when we can have patience enough to bear the cold\r\n  for an hour or two, or contrive to have the fire lighted a long time\r\n  before we want it, the small coal may be of some use, but the fire\r\n  made with it is never strong, nor so bright; and does not burn so long\r\n  as a fire made with large or round coals: it often requires the help\r\n  of the poker, and produces a great quantity of breeze.\r\n\r\n  The loss in the use of small coals is more considerable to the poor,\r\n  who cannot keep large fires. When they want their breakfast or dinner,\r\n  the time they can spare is limited; and to have their water sooner\r\n  boiling, or their meals quicker ready; they must make use of the\r\n  poker, and lose a great deal of coal. This fact is so evident, that\r\n  any body who wishes to make the experiment before recommended, will\r\n  find that much more bright coal goes to the dust-hole of the poor man,\r\n  than to the dust-hole of a rich family, where, the fire-place being\r\n  large, the small coal has more chance of burning.\r\n\r\n  The loss is still greater to the poor, in consequence of the inferior\r\n  sorts of coal which are sold to them. If it is the light sort, it\r\n  burns too quick, and they consume double the quantity; if the strong\r\n  sort, it burns too slow, and is nearly as wasteful; for a great\r\n  quantity of it then goes to the dust-hole without having been lighted\r\n  at all.\r\n\r\n  An incorrect opinion is often entertained, that the real quantity of\r\n  coal contained in a sack is lessened by separating or screening the\r\n  small from the round coals; but we must recollect, that any compact\r\n  body occupies less space than is required to contain the same matter,\r\n  reduced to smaller irregular pieces, or to powder.--Now the screening\r\n  only takes away the finest dusty part of the coals, and admits more\r\n  small pieces of round coals to be filled into the sack.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more perfectly devoid of common sense, and wasteful and\r\nslovenly at the same time, than the manner in which chimney fires, where\r\ncoals are burnt, are commonly managed by servants. They throw on a load\r\nof (perhaps all small) coals at once, through which the flame is hours\r\nin making its way; and frequently it is not without much care and\r\ntrouble that the fire is prevented from going quite out. During this\r\ntime no heat is communicated to the room; and, what is still worse, the\r\nthroat of the chimney being occupied merely by a heavy dense vapour, not\r\npossessed of any heating power, and, consequently, not having much\r\nelasticity, the warm air of the room finds less difficulty in forcing\r\nits way up the chimney and escaping, than when the fire burns bright,\r\nand the coal-gas is ignited. And it happens not unfrequently, especially\r\nin chimnies and fire-places ill-constructed, that this current of warm\r\nair from the room which presses into the chimney, crossing upon the\r\ncurrent of heavy smoke and aqueous vapour which escapes slowly from the\r\nfire, obstructs it in its ascent, and beats it back into the room. Hence\r\nit is that chimnies so often smoke when too large a quantity of fresh\r\ncoals is put upon the fire. So many coals should never be put on the\r\nfire at once as to prevent the free passage of the flame between them,\r\nor to prevent them becoming quickly heated, so as to give out the\r\ncarburetted hidrogen gas which they are capable of furnishing, and to\r\ncause it to be inflamed, In short, a fire should never be smothered: and\r\nwhen attention is paid to the quantity of coals put on, there is little\r\nuse for the poker; and this circumstance will contribute much to\r\ncleanliness, and the preservation of furniture.\r\n\r\nThe author of a paper in the Plain Dealer asserts, that, of the various\r\nperversions of abilities, there is none that makes a human being more\r\nridiculous, than that of attempting to stir a fire without judgment; to\r\nprevent which he lays down the following rules:--1. Stirring of a fire\r\nis of use, because it makes a hollow where, the air being rarefied by\r\nthe adjacent heat, the surrounding air rushes into this hollow, and\r\ngives life and support to the fire, and carries the flame with it. 2.\r\nNever stir a fire when fresh coals are laid on, particularly when they\r\nare very small, because they immediately fall into the hollow place, and\r\ntherefore ruin the fire. 3. Always keep the bottom bars clear. 4. Never\r\nbegin to stir the fire at the top, unless when the bottom is quite\r\nclear, and the top only wants breaking.\r\n\r\nThere is one subject more on which it is necessary to speak.--In the\r\npresent instance, the public has been alarmed by representations that\r\nthe general adoption of gas-lights would expose us to innumerable\r\naccidents, from the inflammable nature of the gas, and the explosion of\r\nthe apparatus in which it is prepared, or the bursting of the pipes by\r\nwhich it is conveyed. But there is no ground for such fears.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the subject will readily allow, that there\r\nis no more risk in the action of a gas-light machinery, properly\r\nconstructed, than there is in the action of a steam-engine, built on\r\njust principles.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the coal-gas requires nothing more than what the most\r\nignorant person, with a common degree of care and attention, is\r\ncompetent to perform. The heating of the gas-furnace, the charging of\r\nthe retorts with coal, the closing them up air-tight, the keeping them\r\nred-hot, and discharging them again, are the only operations required in\r\nthis art; and these, surely, demand no more skill than a few practical\r\nlessons can teach to the meanest capacity. The workman is not called\r\nupon to exercise his own judgment, because, when the fire is properly\r\nmanaged, the evolution of the gas goes on spontaneously, and without\r\nfurther care, till all the gas is extricated from the coal.\r\n\r\nNo part of the machinery is liable to be out of order,--there are no\r\ncocks to be turned, no valves to be regulated; nor can the operator\r\nderange the apparatus but by the most violent efforts. And when the\r\nstock of gas is prepared, we may depend on its lighting power as much\r\nas we depend on the light to be obtained from a certain number of\r\ncandles or oil-lamps.\r\n\r\nThe diversified experiments which have been made by different\r\nindividuals, unconnected with each other, have sufficiently established\r\nthe perfect safety of the new lights; and numerous manufactories might\r\nbe named in which the gas-lights have now been in use for upwards of\r\nseven years, where nothing like an accident has occurred, though the\r\napparatus in all of them is entrusted to the most ignorant man.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to state the causes which have given rise to some of\r\nthose accidents that have spread alarm amongst the public; but of this\r\nit is not my business to speak at length. It is sufficient, on the\r\npresent occasion, to state, that those melancholy occurrences which have\r\nhappened at some gas-light establishments which I have had an\r\nopportunity of examining, were totally occasioned by egregious failures\r\ncommitted in the construction of the machinery. Thus, an explosion very\r\nlately took place in a manufactory lighted with coal-gas, in consequence\r\nof a large quantity of gas escaping into a building, where it mingled\r\nwith common air, and was set on fire by the approach of a lighted\r\ncandle. That such an accident could happen, is an evident proof that the\r\nmachinery was erected by a bungler, unacquainted with the most essential\r\nprinciples of this art; because such an accident might have been\r\neffectually prevented, by adapting a waste pipe to the gasometer and\r\ngasometer house. By this means, if more gas had been prepared than the\r\ngasometer would contain, the superfluous quantity could never have\r\naccumulated, but would have been transported out of the building into\r\nthe open air, in as an effectual manner as the waste-pipe of a water\r\ncistern conveys away the superfluous quantity of water, when the cistern\r\nis full. Such an expedient did not form part of the machinery.\r\n\r\nOther instances might be named, where explosions have been occasioned\r\nthrough egregious mistakes having been committed in the erection of the\r\ngas-light machinery, were this a subject on which I meant to treat.\r\n\r\nThat the coal-gas, when mixed with a certain portion of common air, in\r\nclose vessels, may be inflamed by the contact of a lighted body, as has\r\nbeen stated, page 98, is a fact sufficiently known. But the means of\r\npreventing such an occurrence in the common application of gas-lights,\r\nare so simple, easy, and effectual, that it would be ridiculous to dread\r\ndanger where there is nothing to be apprehended. In speaking thus of the\r\nsafety of the gas-light illumination, I do not mean to deny that no\r\npossible circumstances may occur where the coal-gas may be the cause of\r\naccident. It is certain that the gas, when suffered to accumulate in\r\nlarge quantities in close and confined places, where there is no current\r\nof air, such as in cellars, vaults, &c. and where it can mix with common\r\nair, and remain undisturbed, that it may be liable to take fire when\r\napproached by a lighted body; but I do not see how it is probable that\r\nsuch an accumulation of gas should take place in the apartments of\r\ndwelling houses. The constant current of air which passes continually\r\nthrough the rooms, is sufficient to prevent the possibility of such an\r\naccumulation ever to take place. And with regard to the bursting of the\r\npipes which convey the gas, no accident can possibly happen from that\r\nquarter; because the gas which passes through the whole range of pipes\r\nsustains a pressure equal to the perpendicular weight of about one inch\r\nof water only, and such a weight of course is insufficient to burst iron\r\npipes. Nor could the town when illuminated by gas-lights, be thrown\r\nsuddenly into darkness, as has been asserted might happen by the\r\nfracture of a main pipe, supposing such an event should take place;\r\nbecause the lateral branches, which supply the street-lamps and houses,\r\nare supplied by more than one main; and the consequence of a fracture\r\nwould be only an extinction of the few lamps in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the broken pipe, because the rest of the pipes, situated beyond the\r\nfracture, would continue to be supplied with gas from the other mains,\r\nas will become obvious from the sketch exhibited in the next page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Main pipe, leading from the Gas-light station or\r\napparatus, situated in Brick Lane, near Old St.[34]\r\n\r\nMain pipe, leading from the gaslight apparatus, or station, at Norton\r\nFalgate.[35]\r\n\r\nMain pipe, leading from the gaslight apparatus, or station, in\r\nWestminster.[36]]\r\n\r\n  [34] _The gasometer at this place is equal in capacity to 22000 cubic\r\n  feet._\r\n\r\n  [35] _The capacity of the gasometer here is equal to 15928 cubic\r\n  feet._\r\n\r\n  [36] _At this station the gasometer is equal in capacity to 14808\r\n  cubic feet._\r\n\r\nThe black lines represent the gas-light mains, or largest pipes, from\r\nwhich the smaller pipes branch off: they are connected with each other\r\nat the places marked A B C; and the dotted lines represent the smaller\r\nmains, or collateral branches before-mentioned. The main pipes are all\r\nfurnished with valves, or cocks, placed at about 100 feet distant from\r\neach other. Now let us suppose that a main pipe, in any part of the\r\nstreet marked in the sketch, _Pall Mall_, should break, it is evident,\r\non mere inspection, that the gas which is passing through the main in\r\nthe _Strand_, and which is also connected with the main in the\r\n_Haymarket_, _Piccadilly_, and _Coventry Street_, would continue to\r\nsupply the broken pipe, and the valve nearest to the fracture being\r\nshut, would prevent the loss of any considerable quantity of gas, and\r\nthe few lamps situated between the two valves and the fracture would\r\ntherefore only become extinguished.\r\n\r\nFurther, let us suppose a main pipe should break in _Piccadilly_; in\r\nthat case, the valve being shut on each side of the fracture, the gas\r\nwould be supplied from the mains in the _Haymarket_ and _St. James’s\r\nStreet_. And the same effect would be produced in any part of the town,\r\nsupplied with gas-pipes. Besides all this, in the statement thus far\r\ngiven, we have assumed that all the gas-light mains are supplied with\r\ngas from one manufacturing station only, but which in reality is not the\r\ncase. The range of pipes that convey the gas is connected with three\r\ngas-light establishments, situated at different parts of the town; and\r\nthe gas which is supplied from these stations is connected with the\r\nwhole system of pipes in the streets.[37] If, therefore, one of the\r\nmanufactories should be annihilated, it would make no difference,\r\nbecause the lights would be amply supplied from the other two\r\nmanufacturing stations. Hence it is obvious, that the fracture of any of\r\nthe gas-light mains, or even the total destruction of one or more of the\r\nmanufactories themselves, would be attended with no serious consequence;\r\nand as the system of lighting with gas becomes more extended, the\r\nmanufactories, or stations for supplying it, will also be multiplied, to\r\ngive effect and security to the whole.\r\n\r\n  [37] As shown in the sketch.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no danger can arise from the application of gas-lights in any\r\nway, but what is common to candle-light, and lamps of all kinds, and is\r\nthe fault of none of them. Even in this case the gas-lights are less\r\nhazardous. There is no risk of those accidents which often happen from\r\nthe guttering or burning down of candles, or from carelessly snuffing\r\nthem. The gas-light lamps and burners must necessarily be fixed to one\r\nplace, and therefore cannot fall, or otherwise become deranged, without\r\nbeing immediately extinguished. Besides, the gas-light flames emit no\r\nsparks, nor are any embers detached from them. As a proof of the\r\ncomparative safety of the gas-lights, it need only be stated, that the\r\nFire-offices engage themselves to insure cotton-mills, and other public\r\nworks, at a less premium, where gas-lights are used, than in the case of\r\nany other lights.[38] The excessive expence of insurance arising from\r\nthe numerous candles employed in most of the first rate manufactories,\r\nand the combustible nature of the structure of the buildings; the great\r\ndifficulty of retrieving the injury resulting to a well-organised\r\nbusiness, from the accidental destruction of the machinery, are objects\r\nalone sufficient to furnish the strongest economical, as well as\r\npolitical recommendations, for the adoption of the new lights in all\r\nmanufactories where work is done by candle-light.\r\n\r\n  [38] Since the preceding pages have been printed, I have seen a\r\n  _self-extinguishing gas-lamp_, invented by Mr. CLEGG. This lamp is so\r\n  constructed, that the gas cannot flow to the burner, when the flame\r\n  becomes extinguished. If, therefore, the lamp should be blown out, and\r\n  the stop-cock which supplies the gas be left open, the extinction of\r\n  the flame will effectually shut the valve. The action of this lamp\r\n  depends upon the expansibility of a metallic rod, heated by the flame\r\n  of the lamp, and thus keeping open the valve, whereas, when the lamp\r\n  is extinguished, and the rod becomes cold, it contracts to its natural\r\n  dimensions, and, by that means, effectually closes the valve. The same\r\n  engineer has invented a machine, which both measures and registers, in\r\n  the absence of the observer, the quantity of gas delivered by any pipe\r\n  communicating with a gas-light main. The machine occupies a space of\r\n  about two feet by one foot, and, if put up in a room, house, or other\r\n  place, where gas is burnt, will, at any time, by mere inspection, give\r\n  an account of the quantity of gas consumed in that place during any\r\n  given time. On the present occasion, it would not become me to say\r\n  more on these subjects, which, no doubt, Mr. CLEGG will make known to\r\n  the public; I shall only remark, that these contrivances do signal\r\n  honour to the talents and abilities of the inventor; and that they\r\n  will render the greatest services to those who are engaged in the\r\n  gas-light illumination.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the facts so far detailed, many other advantages,\r\nconnected with the gas-light illumination, will naturally suggest\r\nthemselves to the reader. I have endeavoured merely to point out the\r\nleading characters of the new lights, as they are at present. Ingenious\r\nmen may speculate from what has been done to what remains to be\r\neffected, which, no doubt, will embrace objects of the greatest utility\r\nand most extended national importance. The public attention is awakened\r\nto the new properties of coal, and will not rest till they are\r\nextensively applied to economical purposes. The consequence will be, a\r\nconsiderable defalcation in the revenue. For, in proportion as the\r\ngas-lights are more or less generally adopted in all towns of the\r\ncountry, the consumption of oil and tallow will be diminished, and the\r\nimpost on those articles become less productive; and when this takes\r\nplace, Government, no doubt, will share in the profits, by levying a tax\r\non the new lights. The Exchequer will thus have nothing to fear; as one\r\nbranch of the revenue fails, another, and a more productive one, will\r\nsupply its place.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, when we reflect that the object of the gas-light\r\nillumination is to open a source of national wealth, of which nothing\r\ncan deprive us, to create, we may almost say, new articles of value, its\r\nfriends cannot be thought guilty of great presumption, if they look\r\nforward with confidence to the successful extension of this new art of\r\ncivil economy; and if, contrary to all expectations, the effects of\r\njealousy and prejudice should, in some respect or other, continue here\r\nand there its influence against this new art of procuring light, a firm\r\nperseverance of its application must at length remove that ignorance\r\nwhich alone can give them birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW, EXHIBITING\r\n\r\n  The quantity of GAS, COKE, TAR, PITCH, ESSENTIAL OIL, and AMMONIACAL\r\n  LIQUOR, obtainable from a given quantity of COAL; together with an\r\n  Estimate of the quantity of Coal necessary to produce a quantity of\r\n  Gas, capable of yielding a Light equal in duration of time and\r\n  intensity to that produced by Tallow Candles of different kinds.\r\n\r\n  -----------+------------------------------------------\r\n             |            _Cost of Coal._\r\n             | Minimum.

B. If it be required to know, for how many hours one pound, or one\r\npeck, or one bushel, or one sack, of coal will produce Gas Light equal\r\nto that of a certain number of well-snuffed Tallow Candles, the\r\nproportion of each of the average weights of a pound, peck, bushel, or\r\nsack, to that of the average weight of a chaldron of coal, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n               1 lb. = 2968th part of a chaldron.\r\n  One peck    20     = 148th        ditto.\r\n  One bushel  82     =  36th        ditto.\r\n  One sack   248     =  12th        ditto.\r\n\r\nRULE.--Divide with either of the above parts of weight, the number of\r\nlights opposite to their hours, and the product will be the number of\r\nlights burning for the same number of hours.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.--To know how many lights one peck of coal will give for six\r\nhours, divide the 148th part in 3,500, opposite to the number of six\r\nhours, the product is almost 24 lights. The same rule holds good for any\r\ngiven quantity or number of pounds of coal, in a chaldron, to find how\r\nmany lights, or candles, 12 to the lb. or 6 to the lb. they will give\r\nfor a given number of hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE GAS-LIGHT APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\nExhibits a perspective view of a gas-light apparatus,[40] for lighting\r\nfactories, or small districts of houses. It consists of the following\r\nparts: which may be considered separately.\r\n\r\n  [40] This apparatus was erected by Mr. CLEGG, and is now in action at\r\n  Mr. ACKERMAN’s establishment, in this metropolis.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. The _Retort Furnace_, for distilling the coals. It is built of\r\nbrick-work. The bricks which are exposed to the immediate action of the\r\nfire, are _Welch tumps_, or fire-bricks; they are bedded in clay, or\r\nWindsor loam.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. The _Tar Cistern_, to collect the coal-tar, and other\r\ncondensible products obtained during the distillation of the coals. It\r\nis a cast-iron hollow cylinder, closed at the top with a cast-iron\r\ncover, which has a very small hole to allow the air to escape as the\r\nliquid enters into the vessel.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. The _Lime Machine_, for purifying the crude coal-gas, and to\r\nrender it fit for use. The construction of this machine will be\r\nexplained in plate VII. It is put together of cast-iron plates.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. The _Gasometer_, for collecting and preserving the purified gas,\r\nand for distributing and applying it as occasion may require. It\r\nconsists of two principal parts--namely, a large interior vessel closed\r\nat the top and open at the bottom, made of sheet iron, designed to\r\ncontain the gas, and an outer cistern or vessel, of rather greater\r\ncapacity, constructed of cast-iron plates, in which the former vessel is\r\nsuspended. The latter contains the water by which the gas is confined.\r\nThe interior vessel which contains the gas is suspended by chains hung\r\nover wheels or pullies, to which weights are attached, so as to be just\r\nsufficient to balance the weight of the gasometer, all but a small\r\ndifference, and allowing its slow descent in the manner which is found\r\nas nearly adapted as can be to the proper supply of the lamps. The\r\nweight of the chains must be equal to the specific gravity of the\r\nmaterial of which the gasometer is composed, so as to compensate\r\naccurately for the quantity of water which the gasometer displaces, or\r\nwhat is the same, it must be equal to the loss of weight which the\r\ngasometer sustains, when immersed in the water; and the counterpoise\r\nweight must be equal (or nearly so) to the absolute weight of the\r\ngasometer.\r\n\r\nThe action of these different parts of the apparatus will be obvious\r\nfrom the following explanation:\r\n\r\nA, A, are two iron retorts, placed horizontally, and side by side, in\r\nthe furnace; the mouth of the retorts where the coals are introduced,\r\nprojects into an arched chamber, situated in front of the furnace, as\r\nshewn in the drawing by the broken down brick-work. The object of\r\nsuffering the mouth of the retorts to project into a separate chamber,\r\nis merely to discharge with convenience the red hot coke from the\r\nretorts when the process is at an end; the coke being suffered to fall\r\nto the bottom of the chamber, where it cools, without becoming\r\ntroublesome to the operator. It may be removed from this fire-safe\r\nchamber by the door represented at the end view of the furnace.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation commences, the inner vessel of the gasometer, fig. 4\r\nis sunk down, to expel the air which it contains to a level with the\r\nexterior vessel, or outer cistern, of the gasometer; and, consequently,\r\nbecomes filled with water. As the distillation of the coal in the\r\nretorts proceeds, the liquid and gazeous products evolved from the coals\r\nare transmitted by means of the perpendicular syphon pipes B, B, into\r\nthe horizontal pipe or main condenser C, with which they are connected.\r\nThe liquid which is distilled, collects in the pipe, or main condenser,\r\nC, where it is retained until its quantity has risen so high as to\r\ndischarge itself into the pipe D, which is connected with the upper part\r\nof one of the extremities of the condenser, C. One of the extremities of\r\nthe pipes, B, B, therefore become immersed into the liquid contained in\r\nthe main condenser or pipe C, whilst the vaporous or condensible fluid,\r\nafter having overcome the pressure there opposed to it, is transported\r\ninto the pipe E, which, after passing in a serpentine direction, E, E,\r\n&c. through the exterior vessel or cistern of the gasometer, terminates\r\nin the tar-vessel, fig. 2. Thus the vaporous fluids are condensed by\r\npassing through the serpentine pipe, E, E, &c. and become deposited in\r\nthe tar-cistern, fig. 2; whilst the non-condensible or gazeous products\r\nare made to proceed by the pipe F, which branches off from the pipe E,\r\ninto the lime machine, fig. 3. In this apparatus the gas, as it is\r\nevolved from the coals, comes into contact with slaked lime and water;\r\nthe object of which is, to strip it of its sulphuretted hydrogen and\r\ncarbonic acid gas with which it always abounds, and to render it fit for\r\nillumination. This being accomplished, the purified gas is conducted\r\naway out of the lime machine by means of the pipe G, into the\r\nperpendicular pipe H, which branches up through the bottom of the\r\ngasometer cistern. The upper extremity of this pipe is covered, in the\r\nmanner of a hood, by a cylindrical vessel I, open at bottom, but\r\npartially immersed beneath the surface of the water contained in the\r\nouter cistern of the gasometer, it is also perforated round near the\r\nlower edge with a number of small holes. The gas, as it passes out of\r\nthe pipe H, displaces the water from the receiver I, and escapes through\r\nthe small holes, and is thus made to pass through the water in the\r\ncistern, in which the hood of the pipe I, is partly immersed, so as to\r\nexpose a large surface to its action, that it may once more be washed,\r\nand deprived of all the foreign gazeous products which might have\r\nescaped the action of the lime, whilst it was agitated with this\r\nsubstance in the lime machine, fig. 3. After rising through the water in\r\nthe gasometer cistern, it enters into the gasometer, which then ascends\r\nas the gas accumulates in it.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the process proceeds, until the whole of the volatile\r\nproducts of the coal in the retort are disengaged. The use of the\r\ngasometer is, partly to equalize the evolution of the gas which comes\r\nfrom the retort more quickly at some time than others. When this\r\nhappens, the vessel rises up to receive it, and when the stream from the\r\nretort diminishes, the weight of the gasometer expels its contents,\r\nprovided the main-cock be open. When the process is finished, the retort\r\nis suffered to cool, and its lid is then removed to replenish it with\r\ncoal. When the main stop-cock is then opened, the gasometer descends,\r\nand the gas passes from the gasometer through the pipe K, to the\r\nburners, or main pipe, which communicates with the gas burners or lamps.\r\nL, is a wooden tub or barrel, containing the mixture of lime and water,\r\nfor charging the lime machine; and into which the contents of the\r\nbarrel, L, may be conveyed by the curved pipe M, without admitting\r\ncommon air. N, N, is a water-pipe, to convey fresh water into the\r\ngasometer cistern occasionally; because it is essential that the water\r\nused for washing and purifying the gas should be changed for fresh as\r\nsoon as it becomes dirty; and unless this is done, the gas will not be\r\nperfectly purified by washing, but produce a disagreeable odour when\r\nburnt; the same holds good with regard to the lime machine, the\r\ncontents of which should be renewed occasionally. This pipe also conveys\r\nthe necessary water into the barrel, L. O, is a waste-pipe, to convey\r\nthe water as it becomes impregnated with the impurities of the gas, out\r\nof the gasometer cistern. P, is an agitator, to stir up the contents of\r\nthe lime machine occasionally, Q, Q, are two iron rods, which serve as\r\nstays to guide the motion of the gasometer. R, is an index, connected by\r\nmeans of a shaft and pulley with the axis of one of the gasometer\r\nwheels. This index is graduated to the capacity of the cubical contents\r\nof the gasometer, so as to indicate, by the rising and falling of the\r\ngasometer, its relative contents of gas expressed in cubic feet. S, is\r\nthe waste pipe of the lime machine, to remove the insoluble parts of the\r\nlime. T, represents the iron cover, or lid, which is turned on the\r\nlathe, and ground air-tight, to close up the mouth of the retort, so as\r\nto make readily an air-tight fitting. U is an iron wedge to secure the\r\ncover of the retort. The left-hand retort in the design shows the retort\r\nclosed up, and the cover, or lid of the mouth of it secured by means of\r\nthe wedge, in its place, so as to render the mouth of the retort\r\nperfectly air tight.\r\n\r\nThere is a safety valve attached to this gasometer which could not be\r\nrepresented in the drawing; and the object of which is, to convey away\r\nany portion of gas that might happen to be produced by a careless\r\noperator, when the gasometer is full, and which is thus prevented from\r\naccumulating in the place where the gasometer is erected. It is\r\nrepresented in the right-hand corner of plate VII. where fig. 1 shows\r\nthe edge of the gasometer; 2, the surface of the water in the inside of\r\nthe gasometer; 3, the surface of the water in the outside of the\r\ngasometer, or in the cistern; 4, a pipe issuing from the lower edge of\r\nthe gasometer, and surrounded at its upper extremity with a cup marked\r\n5; 6, the waste pipe, the mouth of which is immersed in water. It is\r\nobvious that, when the gasometer is full, if an additional quantity of\r\ngas should be attempted to be put into it, it will be transported by\r\nmeans of the pipe 4, into the waste-pipe 6; the upper extremity of which\r\nreaches out of the building, and there communicates with the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\nRepresents a Portable experimental Gas Apparatus for exhibiting, in the\r\nsmall way, the general nature of the gas-light illumination.--It is\r\ndescribed page 79.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATES III. IV. V.\r\n\r\nShow designs of various kinds of Gas Lamps, Chandeliers, Candelabras,\r\n&c.--See pages 114, 118, 140.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VI.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Exhibits a design of the _gasometer framing_, or _skeleton_,\r\nwhich serves to give stability and strength to the gasometer. It\r\nconsists of wooden frame work, marked A, A, A, interlaced with iron\r\nrods, B, B, B, &c. The whole framing is so disposed that it will float\r\nin the cistern horizontally, and therefore keep the gasometer perfectly\r\nsteady and level with the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sketches represent various kinds of gas pipes employed\r\nas _mains_ for conveying the gas, and the methods of connecting them.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Represents a longitudinal section of a _Spigot_ and _Faucet\r\nPipe_. These kinds of pipes are applicable in most cases as mains for\r\nconveying gas. A, is called the spigot, and B, the faucet. They are\r\njoined together, and made air tight, by iron cement, the composition of\r\nwhich is as follows:\r\n\r\nTake two ounces of sal ammoniac, one ounce of flowers of sulphur, and\r\nsixteen ounces of cast iron filings or borings. Mix all well together,\r\nby rubbing them in a mortar, and keep the powder dry.\r\n\r\nWhen the cement is wanted for use, take one part of the above powder,\r\nand twenty parts of clean iron borings or filings, and blend them\r\nintimately by grinding them in a mortar. Wet the compound with water,\r\nand when brought to a convenient consistence, apply it to the joints\r\nwith a wooden or blunt iron spatula.\r\n\r\nBy a play of affinities, which those who are at all acquainted with\r\nchemistry will be at no loss to comprehend, a degree of action and\r\nre-action takes place among the ingredients, and between them and the\r\niron surfaces, which at last causes the whole to unite as one mass. In\r\nfact, after a time, the mixture and the surfaces of the flanches become\r\na species of pyrites (holding a very large proportion of iron,) all the\r\nparts of which cohere strongly together.\r\n\r\nThe inner parts of the faucet ought to be no larger in diameter than\r\njust to fit the spigot. This supports the pipe, independently of the\r\ncement, and prevents the risk of hurting the joint from any external\r\nstress. The inner faucet is commonly made about 2½ inches deep, and has\r\nthe spigot inserted 1½ inch into it. The practice of some workmen, is to\r\nmake the outer faucet, or that which contains the cement, six inches\r\ndeep, for all pipes above six inches diameter; and to make the faucets\r\nof all pipes below six inches, the same depth as the diameter of the\r\npipes. It is usual to make the space for the cement, all round the\r\nspigot, from 1 to 1½ inch; that width is required, in order that the\r\ncement may be firmly driven into the joint. When the space is very\r\nnarrow, this cannot be done. On the other hand, when too wide, there is\r\na waste of cement, and a risk of injury from unequal expansion.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Exhibits a profile view of these kinds of pipes when joined\r\ntogether. The spigot and faucet pipes are liable to burst from the great\r\nexpansion of the spigot, and the risk of this accident is increased by\r\nincreasing the space between the spigot and faucet, which requires to be\r\nfilled with cement.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. Represents a longitudinal section of two flanch pipes, and the\r\nmodes of connecting them. A and B, show the parts of the pipes; and C\r\nand D, the flanches. These pipes are also joined together, and rendered\r\nair-tight, by interposing between the flanches rope-yarn, hemp, or some\r\nother pliable material, and iron cement, and then screwing up the faces\r\nof them by means of the bolts and screw nuts.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5. Profile view of the same kind of pipes connected together, A and\r\nB, the pipes; C and D, the flanches; E and F, the bolts.\r\n\r\nFIG. 6. Represents the method of joining spigot and faucet pipes when\r\nthey are to have a turn or angle. This method is convenient when the\r\nplace where the turn required to be made is previously known, and the\r\npipes cast accordingly.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7. Exhibits the method of connecting spigot and faucet pipes when\r\nthey have a round turn. A and B, the junctures of the pipes.\r\n\r\nFIG. 8. Represents a longitudinal section of the mode of joining pipes\r\nby means of what is called a _thimble joint_. The junctures of the pipes\r\nto be connected, are made air tight, as mentioned already, by iron\r\ncement. A, the thimble or small cylinder, with projecting edges, which\r\nunites the pipes B, C.\r\n\r\nFIG. 9. A thimble joint made in two parts, which is sometimes convenient\r\nto join pipes. The parts are joined together by screw bolts, and nuts,\r\nin the usual manner.\r\n\r\nFIG. 10. Section of the same.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11. Represents a profile view of what is called the _saddle joint_.\r\nIt is employed for taking off a branch-pipe. The branch has a piece A B,\r\nformed on its end, and fits round one-half of the outside of the pipe\r\nfrom which it is to proceed. C, is called the saddle, which fits round\r\nthe other half of the pipe. The parts are secured together by screw\r\nbolts, and iron cement. By this method a branch may be formed on any\r\npart of a gas-pipe, by cutting a hole there, and applying the branch to\r\nthat place. Where there is much risk of the inequality of expansion, the\r\njoints at certain places, should be secured by a soft stuffing of hemp\r\nand tallow; but in most cases the joints may be made with iron cement.\r\nLead is frequently used for making the joints of gas pipes instead of\r\niron cement, though cheaper and more easy of repair. The galvanic action\r\nwhich takes place between the lead and iron, soon renders the joints\r\nleaky, and the danger is increased by the unequal expansion of the two\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nFIG. 12. Section of the saddle-joint.\r\n\r\nBefore the gas is suffered to enter into the pipe, they should be proved\r\nto be sound, by the usual process of forcing water into them: The pipes\r\nserving as mains, are placed perfectly solid, so that they cannot give\r\nway; their course should be rectilinear, having a descent of about 1\r\ninch in 9 or 10 feet, to allow the water of condensation which may be\r\ndeposited from the gas by a change of temperature to collect readily at\r\nthe lowermost part.\r\n\r\nFIG. 13. Shows a reservoir for collecting the water of condensation\r\nwhich might accumulate in the pipes. It consists of a receptacle, A, in\r\nwhich the water may pass; B, a branch-pipe closed at the top, by means\r\nof which the water may be removed, by drawing it out with a syringe.\r\nThis receptacle is placed in those situations where pipes incline\r\ntowards each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.\r\n\r\nExhibits a perpendicular section of a gas-light apparatus, calculated\r\nfor lighting towns, or large districts of streets and houses.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. The Retort Furnace. The retorts are placed over each other in\r\none or more rows; so that a certain number of them may be heated by\r\nseparate fire-places. A, A, shows two of the retorts placed horizontally\r\nabove each other; B, the fire-place; C, the flue which causes the fire\r\nto circulate round the retorts so as to heat them equally in every part;\r\nD, the opening of the flue where the fire passes into the chimney; E,\r\nthe ash-pit; F, a chamber in front of the retort furnace, into which the\r\norifice or mouth of the retorts project; G, G, the doors of the chamber,\r\nto enable the workmen to charge and discharge the retorts; H, a funnel\r\nshaped hole at the floor of the chamber F, through which the red hot\r\ncoke as it is discharged from the retorts passes into the arched vault\r\nI; K, the syphon tube; L, the horizontal condenser[41]--the action of\r\nboth of these pipes have been already explained, p. 168; M, main pipe,\r\nwhich conveys the liquid substances from the condenser, to the tar\r\ncistern, fig. 3, and which conducts also the gazeous products into the\r\nlime machine, fig. 2; N N, shows that part of the pipe which is\r\ninterposed between the tar cistern, fig. 3, and the condensing pipe\r\nM,--it passes in a serpentine direction along the inner sides of the\r\ngasometer cistern, and, like the so-called _worm_ in a distillatory\r\napparatus, condenses the products which escape in a vaporous state from\r\nthe condenser L; O, shows the place where the serpentine pipe N N,\r\npasses again out of the gasometer cistern, and its communication with\r\nthe lime machine, fig. 2, and tar chamber, fig. 3. The action of the\r\nlime machine is as follows: The liquid products evolved from the coal,\r\nhaving been deposited in the tar cistern, fig. 3, by means of the\r\nserpentine pipe N, N, the gazeous products which accompany it, are\r\nconveyed by means of the pipe P, which branches out from the pipe O,\r\ninto the interior receptacle of the lime machine marked Q, which\r\nconsists of a vessel open at the bottom, and closed at the top, where it\r\ncommunicates with the pipe O. As the gas accumulates in the interior\r\npart Q, of the lime machine, it is made to pass through the liquid which\r\nit contains, namely, slaked lime and water; and escapes through\r\nappertures made in the horizontal partitions R, R, R, R, into the outer\r\nvessel, S, of the lime machine and from thence it is conducted away by\r\nthe pipe T, T, T, into the additional washing apparatus, of the\r\ngasometer; fig. 4, the construction of this apparatus, greatly resembles\r\nthe lime machine, fig. 2, namely, V, is a water pipe, proceeding from a\r\ncistern U, placed 3 or 4 feet above the orifice of the pipe V; T, T, is\r\nthe gas-pipe, covered with a hood, marked W, and immersed in a small\r\ncistern, having horizontal perforated shelves, like those in the lime\r\nmachine--they fit close to the hood. The gas which enters the hood W,\r\nmeets with a shower of water delivered by the pipe V. The gas, as it\r\npasses through the holes in the horizontal partitions, is, therefore,\r\nagain washed and thoroughly purified from foreign gases which may have\r\nescaped the action of the lime machine; Y, is a waste pipe, the lower\r\nextremity of which is sealed by being immersed in water,--it serves to\r\ncarry away the water delivered by the pipe V, as it has been acted on by\r\nthe gas. The summary action of this gas apparatus is, therefore, as\r\nfollows: The liquid products obtained from the coal during the\r\ndistillation are first deposited in the main condenser L, by means of\r\nthe pipe K, and from whence they cannot escape until a quantity of tar\r\nhas accumulated in it to a certain height, and by this means, one of the\r\nextremities of the pipes K, K, becomes immersed and hermetically sealed\r\nby the liquid which the condenser L, contains. The liquid products,\r\nafter having accumulated to a certain height in the condenser, overflow\r\nthe perpendicular portion which it contains, and discharge themselves\r\ninto the pipe M, from whence they are transported into the tar cistern,\r\nfig. 3, by means of the system of pipes N, N, O, whilst the gazeous\r\nproducts are made to pass by means of the branch pipe P, into the lime\r\nmachine, fig. 2. From this part of the apparatus the gas passes through\r\nthe pipe T, T, T, into the additional or smaller washing apparatus\r\nplaced upon a tressel in the cistern of the gasometer, where it is\r\nagain exposed a second time to the action of a current of fresh water;\r\nand from this vessel the gas ascends into the gasometer. The gasometer\r\nis furnished with a pipe A, closed at the top, and fixed in one corner\r\nof the gasometer, but open at the bottom; it includes another pipe\r\nmarked B, which communicates with the main pipe leading to the burners,\r\nor place where the gas is wanted. The pipe A, which slides over the pipe\r\nB, is perforated at the top, the gas passes through these perforations\r\nand is thus made to enter into the pipe B, and disposed of as mentioned.\r\nC, C, is a tube of safety adapted to the gasometer; its lower extremity\r\nremains sealed by the water in the cistern so long as the gasometer is\r\nnot overcharged with gas; but, if more gas should be made to enter the\r\ngasometer than it is destined to receive, this pipe then delivers the\r\ngas into the funnel-shaped tube D, which reaches through the roof of the\r\ngasometer house, and thus the superfluous quantity of gas is conveyed\r\naway into the open air.\r\n\r\n  [41] The condenser in this apparatus is placed at right angles to the\r\n  row, or rows of retorts. It is furnished at one extremity with a\r\n  partition placed perpendicularly, and of a height equal to about\r\n  one-half of the diameter of the condenser. The object of this\r\n  partition is to prevent the tar, &c. deposited in it, to seal the\r\n  pipes K, K, and not to discharge itself into the pipe M, till this has\r\n  been effected. The partition is seen in the drawing.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical vessel P, of fig. 3, surrounding the orifice of the pipe\r\nO, which delivers the tar into the tar cistern, fig. 3, serves to keep\r\nthis pipe constantly immersed into a portion of tar, so that the\r\ncontents of the cistern may be drawn off by the cock without admitting\r\nair into any part of the apparatus. The tar cistern has a small hole at\r\nthe top, to allow the air which it encloses to escape, as it becomes\r\nfilled with tar and ammoniacal liquor. The main condenser L, is placed,\r\nas shown in the drawing, higher than the level of the water in the\r\ngasometer cistern, to allow a free descent of the distillatory liquids\r\nas they pass from this vessel along into the pipes M, N, O, &c. The\r\ncistern of the gasometer, as well as the lime machine, and tar cistern,\r\nare constructed of cast iron plates, bolted and cemented together with\r\niron cement. The gasometer is made of sheet iron plates rivetted\r\ntogether--E, E, are two iron stays--G, G, are friction wheels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_METHOD of correcting the relative pressure of the Gasometer, so as to\r\ncause the gas which it contains to be uniformly of an equal\r\ndensity._[42]\r\n\r\n  [42] For this elegant contrivance we are also indebted to Mr. CLEGG.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned already that the pressure of the gas in the gasometer\r\nshould be invariable, for it is obvious that the weight of the gasometer\r\nis constantly increasing in proportion as it fills with gas, and rises\r\nout of the water--see p. 88, and 167. To render its pressure uniform, we\r\nfirst take the _absolute_ weight of that part of the gasometer which\r\nbecomes immersed in the water, and knowing the _specific weight_ of the\r\nsubstance of which it is composed, we divide its absolute weight by the\r\nspecific weight of the substance of which it is composed; and this being\r\ndone, we make part of the chain, (measured at right angles from the axis\r\nof the wheels over which it passes downwards towards the top of the\r\ngasometer,) which is equal to the length of that part of the gasometer\r\nwhich becomes immersed in water, equal in weight to the specific gravity\r\nof the substance of which the gasometer is composed. For example, let\r\nus suppose that the part of the gasometer which becomes immersed in\r\nwater weighs 861 _lb._ and that it is composed of sheet iron, the\r\nspecific gravity of which, in round numbers, we will take to be 7. It is\r\nthen evident, that the part of the chain of the gasometer measured\r\ndownward from the axis of the wheel over which it passes, and which is\r\nequal in length to the height of the gasometer, must be loaded with a\r\nweight of, or must itself weigh, 123_lb._ for this would be the weight\r\nof the water displaced by the gasometer; or let us suppose the gasometer\r\nto be made of sheet copper, the specific weight of which (omitting\r\ndecimals) is 8; and that the absolute weight of the gasometer is\r\n1792_lbs._ then the chain of the gasometer equal in length to the height\r\nof the gasometer, immersed into the water must weigh 224_lb._ for this\r\nwould be the weight of the quantity of water which the gasometer\r\ndisplaces. This being accomplished by then adding or diminishing the\r\nabsolute or balance weight of the gasometer, any desired uniform\r\npressure may be effected, and the same bulk of gas will always be of the\r\nsame specific gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS TO WORKMEN ATTENDING THE GAS-LIGHT APPARATUS[43].\r\n\r\n  [43] Copied from a printed direction drawn up by Mr. Clegg, for the\r\n  use of workmen.\r\n\r\nParticular care must be taken to make the joints of the mouth-pieces of\r\nthe retorts perfectly air tight, which may be done in the following\r\nmanner:--Take some common clay, dry, pulverize, and sift it, then add\r\nas much water as will make it into the consistency of treacle; make the\r\nmouth-piece and the lid of the retort clean, lay this luting thinly over\r\nthe turned part of the lid, press the lid so luted gently to the\r\nmouth-piece, and then secure it moderately, by means of the iron wedge:\r\nif the workman observes this rule, he will never fail to make good\r\njoints; but if, on the other hand, the operator is careless and neglects\r\nto remove the old luting, &c. from the turned or smooth part of the\r\nmouth of the retort, and thereby cause a bad joint, the consequence will\r\nbe the loss of a considerable quantity of gas, and a very disagreeable\r\nsmell and smoke.\r\n\r\nThe bridge or row of bricks of the flue C, of the retorts, should never\r\nbe made hotter than a bright red, which may be regulated by the door of\r\nthe ash-pit being kept close shut when the fire is getting too hot. If\r\nthe operator neglects this, and suffers the fire-bricks to arrive at a\r\nbright white heat the retorts will soon be destroyed, and bad gas be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe gasometer should be well examined, at least once a week, to see if\r\nit leaks, by the following method, viz. Let the main stop-cock be shut,\r\nthen make a mark on the gasometer at the water’s edge when it is full or\r\nnearly of gas, there being no gas coming from the retorts at the time,\r\nand if the mark sinks in the water, the gasometer leaks; to find out the\r\nplace, walk slowly round it, and you may perceive the leak by the smell,\r\napply a lighted candle to the part suspected, and if there be gas\r\nissuing from it, it will take fire, and perhaps appear like a small\r\nblue flame--blow it out, and mark the place: thus proceed round the\r\ngasometer till you have found all the places; if you perceive a smell,\r\nand yet cannot produce a flame in the part suspected, take a brush with\r\na little thin white-lead paint, and lay it on the part where you think\r\nthe leak is, and, if it be there, the gas which escapes from the leak,\r\nwill immediately turn the paint brown. After the sides of the gasometer\r\nhave been well examined, and secured by dipping a piece of cloth about\r\nthe size of a shilling, into some melted pitch, tempered with a little\r\nbees-wax and tar, apply the cloth whilst hot to the place with the end\r\nof your finger, rubbing it till it is quite cold; next examine the top\r\nof the gasometer in the same manner,--when it is about two feet high in\r\nthe cistern, it will then be better to get at. The water in the cistern\r\nshould always be kept within 3 or four inches of the top, if suffered to\r\nsink much lower without replenishing, the gas will not pass through a\r\nsufficient quantity of water, and oily particles will be apt to condense\r\nin the pipes, to their great detriment.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to be observed in the place lighted is, that the lamps\r\nand pipes are not suffered to be touched on any pretence whatever, but\r\nby the person entrusted with their care. When a lamp is not wanted, it\r\nmust be completely shut off from the pipe which supplies it, by a\r\nstop-cock provided for the purpose, and not opened again but when a\r\nflame is held over it; not a lighted candle, as the tallow is liable to\r\ndrop into the lamps; lighted paper is better.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATE OF THE PRICE OF A GAS-LIGHT APPARATUS, _IF ERECTED IN LONDON_,\r\n\r\nCapable of affording, every 24 hours, Light equal to 40,000 Tallow\r\nCandles, six in the pound, burning one hour.\r\n\r\n                                                            £.  s.\r\n  Gasometer, to contain 10,000 cubic feet of gas            236  0\r\n\r\n  Wheel-work, regulating chain, ballance-weight for }       160 11\r\n    ditto, with wooden framing                      }\r\n\r\n  Wrought iron cistern for gasometer--36 feet wide, }       500  0\r\n    24 feet long and 16 feet deep                   }\r\n      (_It would weigh about 16 tons._)\r\n\r\n  Wooden framing built around it, to secure ditto           150  0\r\n\r\n  Condenser, cistern and communicating pipes                126  0\r\n\r\n  Lime machine, made of cast iron plates                     82  0\r\n\r\n  Gasometer-house, built of frame-work and weather-boarded  250  0\r\n\r\n  Twenty-four retorts set in brick-work, with furnaces }    336  0\r\n    for ditto, compleat                                }\r\n\r\n                        Sundries                            100  0\r\n                                                         ---------\r\n                                                         £ 1940 11\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A gas-light apparatus complete for work, capable of affording every\r\n  twenty-four hours a quantity of light equal to 1,400 Argand’s Lamps,\r\n  each lamp equal in intensity to six candles, six in the pound, burning\r\n  for five hours, will cost 3,500_l._ if erected in this metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON Price List of the most essential articles[44] employed in the\r\nerection of a Gas-Light apparatus.\r\n\r\n  [44] All the articles are warranted to be perfect and of the best\r\n  kind.
