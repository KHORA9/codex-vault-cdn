HOUGHTON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORS' PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present volume of the series of English translations of M. Arago's\r\nworks consists of his own autobiography and a selection of some of his\r\nmemoirs of eminent scientific men, both continental and British.\r\n\r\nIt does not distinctly appear at what period of his life Arago composed\r\nthe autobiography, but it bears throughout the characteristic stamp of\r\nhis ardent and energetic disposition. The reader will, perhaps, hardly\r\nsuppress a smile at the indications of self-satisfaction with which\r\nseveral of the incidents are brought forward, while the air of romance\r\nwhich invests some of the adventures may possibly give rise to some\r\nsuspicion of occasional embellishment; on these points, however, we\r\nleave each reader to judge for himself. In relation to the history of\r\nscience, this memoir gives some interesting particulars, which disclose\r\nto us much of the interior spirit of the Academy of Sciences, not always\r\nof a kind the most creditable to some of Arago's former contemporaries.\r\n\r\nBut a far higher interest will be found to belong to those eloquent\r\nmemoirs, or éloges of eminent departed men of science, who had attained\r\nthe distinction of being members of the Academy.\r\n\r\nIn these the reader will find a luminous, eminently simple, and popular\r\naccount of the discoveries of each of those distinguished individuals,\r\nof a kind constituting in fact a brief history of the particular branch\r\nof science to which he was devoted. And in the selection included in the\r\npresent volume, which constitutes but a portion of the entire series, we\r\nhave comprised the accounts of men of such varied pursuits as to convey\r\nno inadequate impression of the progress of discovery throughout a\r\nconsiderable range of the whole field of the physical sciences within\r\nthe last half century.\r\n\r\nThe account given by the author, of the principal discoveries made by\r\nthe illustrious subjects of his memoirs, is in general very luminous,\r\nbut at the same time presupposes a familiarity with some parts of\r\nscience which may not really be possessed by all readers. For the sake\r\nof a considerable class, then, we have taken occasion, wherever the use\r\nof new technical terms or other like circumstances seemed to require it,\r\nto introduce original notes and commentaries, sometimes of considerable\r\nextent, by the aid of which we trust the scientific principles adverted\r\nto in the text will be rendered easily intelligible to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIn some few instances also we have found ourselves called upon to adopt\r\na more critical tone; where we were disposed to dissent from the view\r\ntaken by the author on particular questions of a controversial kind, or\r\nwhen he is arguing in support, or in refutation, of opposing theories on\r\nsome points of science not yet satisfactorily cleared up.\r\n\r\nWe could have wished that our duty as translators and editors had not\r\nextended beyond such mere occasional scientific or literary criticism.\r\nBut there unfortunately seemed to be one or two points where, in\r\npronouncing on the claims of distinguished individuals, or criticizing\r\ntheir inventions, a doubt could not but be felt as to the perfect\r\n_fairness_ of Arago's judgment, and in which we were constrained to\r\nexpress an unfavourable opinion on the manner in which the relative\r\npretensions of men of the highest eminence seemed to be decided,\r\ninvolving what might sometimes be fairly regarded as undue prejudice,\r\nor possibly a feeling of personal or even national jealousy. Much as we\r\nshould deprecate the excitement of any feeling of hostility of this\r\nkind, yet we could not, in our editorial capacity, shrink from the plain\r\nduty of endeavouring to advocate what appeared to us right and true; and\r\nwe trust that whatever opinion may be entertained as to the\r\n_conclusions_ to which we have come on such points, we shall not have\r\ngiven ground for any complaint that we have violated any due courtesy or\r\npropriety in our _mode_ of expressing those conclusions, or the reasons\r\non which they are founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\nTHE HISTORY OF MY YOUTH.\r\n\r\nAn Autobiography of Francis Arago                                    1\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY.\r\n\r\nIntroduction                                                        91\r\n\r\nInfancy of Bailly.--His Youth.--His Literary Essays.--His\r\nMathematical Studies                                                93\r\n\r\nBailly becomes the Pupil of Lacaille.--He is associated\r\nwith him in his Astronomical Labours                                97\r\n\r\nBailly a Member of the Academy of Sciences.--His Researches\r\non Jupiter's Satellites                                            103\r\n\r\nBailly's Literary Works.--His Biographies of Charles V.--of\r\nLeibnitz--of Peter Corneille--of Molière                           106\r\n\r\nDebates relative to the Post of Perpetual Secretary of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences                                            110\r\n\r\nHistory of Astronomy.--Letters on the Atlantis of Plato\r\nand on the Ancient History of Asia                                 114\r\n\r\nFirst Interview of Bailly with Franklin.--His Entrance\r\ninto the French Academy in 1783.--His Reception.--Discourse.--His\r\nRupture with Buffon                                                121\r\n\r\nReport on Animal Magnetism                                         127\r\n\r\nElection of Bailly into the Academy of Inscriptions                155\r\n\r\nReport on the Hospitals                                            157\r\n\r\nReport on the Slaughter-Houses                                     165\r\n\r\nBiographies of Cook and of Gresset                                 167\r\n\r\nAssembly of the Notables.--Bailly is named First Deputy\r\nof Paris; and soon after Dean or Senior of the Deputies\r\nof the Communes                                                    169\r\n\r\nBailly becomes Mayor of Paris.--Scarcity.--Marat declares\r\nhimself inimical to the Mayor.--Events of the 6th of October       179\r\n\r\nA Glance at the Posthumous Memoir of Bailly                        193\r\n\r\nExamination of Bailly's Administration as Mayor                    195\r\n\r\nThe King's Flight.--Events on the Champ de Mars                    206\r\n\r\nBailly quits the Mayoralty the 12th of November, 1791.--The\r\nEschevins.--Examination of the Reproaches that might be\r\naddressed to the Mayor                                             211\r\n\r\nBailly's Journey from Paris to Nantes, and then from Nantes to\r\nMélun.--His Arrest in this last Town.--He is transferred to Paris  217\r\n\r\nBailly is called as a Witness in the Trial of the Queen.--His own\r\nTrial before the Revolutionary Tribunal.--His Condemnation to\r\nDeath.--His Execution.--Imaginary Details added by ill-informed\r\nHistorians to what that odious and frightful Event already\r\npresented                                                          225\r\n\r\nPortrait of Bailly.--His Wife                                      250\r\n\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL.\r\n\r\nPersonal History                                                   258\r\n\r\nChronological Table of the Memoirs of William Herschel             266\r\n\r\nImprovements in the Means of Observation                           271\r\n\r\nLabours in Sidereal Astronomy                                      285\r\n\r\nLabours relative to the Solar System                               289\r\n\r\nOptical Labours                                                    301\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPLACE.\r\n\r\nPreliminary Notice                                                 303\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n    (A.)

My\r\nfather, a licentiate in law, had some little property in arable land, in\r\nvineyards, and in plantations of olive-trees, the income from which\r\nsupported his numerous family.\r\n\r\nI was thus three years old in 1789, four years old in 1790, five years\r\nin 1791, six years in 1792, and seven years old in 1793, &c.\r\n\r\nThe reader has now himself the means of judging whether, as has been\r\nsaid, and even stated in print, I had a hand in the excesses of our\r\nfirst revolution.\r\n\r\nMy parents sent me to the primary school in Estagel, where I learnt the\r\nrudiments of reading and writing. I received, besides, in my father's\r\nhouse, some private lessons in vocal music. I was not otherwise either\r\nmore or less advanced than other children of my age. I enter into these\r\ndetails merely to show how much mistaken are those who have printed that\r\nat the age of fourteen or fifteen years I had not yet learnt to read.\r\n\r\nEstagel was a halting-place for a portion of the troops who, coming from\r\nthe interior, either went on to Perpignan, or repaired direct to the\r\narmy of the Pyrenees. My parents' house was therefore constantly full of\r\nofficers and soldiers. This, joined to the lively excitement which the\r\nSpanish invasion had produced within me, inspired me with such decided\r\nmilitary tastes, that my family was obliged to have me narrowly watched\r\nto prevent my joining by stealth the soldiers who left Estagel. It often\r\nhappened that they caught me at a league's distance from the village,\r\nalready on my way with the troops.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion these warlike tastes had nearly cost me dear. It was the\r\nnight of the battle of Peires-Tortes. The Spanish troops in their\r\nretreat had partly mistaken their road. I was in the square of the\r\nvillage before daybreak; I saw a brigadier and five troopers come up,\r\nwho, at the sight of the tree of liberty, called out, \"_Somos\r\nperdidos!_\" I ran immediately to the house to arm myself with a lance\r\nwhich had been left there by a soldier of the _levée en masse_, and\r\nplacing myself in ambush at the corner of a street, I struck with a blow\r\nof this weapon the brigadier placed at the head of the party. The wound\r\nwas not dangerous; a cut of the sabre, however, was descending to punish\r\nmy hardihood, when some countrymen came to my aid, and, armed with\r\nforks, overturned the five cavaliers from their saddles, and made them\r\nprisoners. I was then seven years old.[1]\r\n\r\nMy father having gone to reside at Perpignan, as treasurer of the mint,\r\nall the family quitted Estagel to follow him there. I was then placed as\r\nan out-door pupil at the municipal college of the town, where I occupied\r\nmyself almost exclusively with my literary studies. Our classic authors\r\nhad become the objects of my favourite reading. But the direction of my\r\nideas became changed all at once by a singular circumstance which I will\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nWalking one day on the ramparts of the town, I saw an officer of\r\nengineers who was directing the execution of the repairs. This officer,\r\nM. Cressac, was very young; I had the hardihood to approach him, and to\r\nask him how he had succeeded in so soon wearing an epaulette. \"I come\r\nfrom the Polytechnic School,\" he answered. \"What school is that?\" \"It is\r\na school which one enters by an examination.\" \"Is much expected of the\r\ncandidates?\" \"You will see it in the programme which the Government\r\nsends every year to the departmental administration; you will find it\r\nmoreover in the numbers of the journal of the school, which are in the\r\nlibrary of the central school.\"\r\n\r\nI ran at once to the library, and there, for the first time, I read the\r\nprogramme of the knowledge required in the candidates.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment I abandoned the classes of the central school, where I\r\nwas taught to admire Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine, Molière, and\r\nattended only the mathematical course. This course was entrusted to a\r\nretired ecclesiastic, the Abbé Verdier, a very respectable man, but\r\nwhose knowledge went no further than the elementary course of La Caille.\r\nI saw at a glance that M. Verdier's lessons would not be sufficient to\r\nsecure my admission to the Polytechnic School; I therefore decided on\r\nstudying by myself the newest works, which I sent for from Paris. These\r\nwere those of Legendre, Lacroix, and Garnier. In going through these\r\nworks I often met with difficulties which exceeded my powers; happily,\r\nstrange though it be, and perhaps without example in all the rest of\r\nFrance, there was a proprietor at Estagel, M. Raynal, who made the study\r\nof the higher mathematics his recreation. It was in his kitchen, whilst\r\ngiving orders to numerous domestics for the labours of the next day,\r\nthat M. Raynal read with advantage the \"Hydraulic Architecture\" of\r\nProny, the \"Mécanique Analytique,\" and the \"Mécanique Céleste.\" This\r\nexcellent man often gave me useful advice; but I must say that I found\r\nmy real master in the cover of M. Garnier's \"Treatise on Algebra.\" This\r\ncover consisted of a printed leaf, on the outside of which blue paper\r\nwas pasted. The reading of the page not covered made me desirous to know\r\nwhat the blue paper hid from me. I took off this paper carefully, having\r\nfirst damped it, and was able to read underneath it the advice given by\r\nd'Alembert to a young man who communicated to him the difficulties which\r\nhe met with in his studies: \"Go on, sir, go on, and conviction will come\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nThis gave me a gleam of light; instead of persisting in attempts to\r\ncomprehend at first sight the propositions before me, I admitted their\r\ntruth provisionally; I went on further, and was quite surprised, on the\r\nmorrow, that I comprehended perfectly what overnight appeared to me to\r\nbe encompassed with thick clouds.\r\n\r\nI thus made myself master, in a year and a half, of all the subjects\r\ncontained in the programme for admission, and I went to Montpellier to\r\nundergo the examination. I was then sixteen years of age. M. Monge,\r\njunior, the examiner, was detained at Toulouse by indisposition, and\r\nwrote to the candidates assembled at Montpellier that he would examine\r\nthem in Paris. I was myself too unwell to undertake so long a journey,\r\nand I returned to Perpignan.\r\n\r\nThere I listened for a moment to the solicitations of my family, who\r\npressed me to renounce the prospects which the Polytechnic School\r\nopened. But my taste for mathematical studies soon carried the day; I\r\nincreased my library with Euler's \"Introduction à l'Analyse\r\nInfinitésimale,\" with the \"Résolution des Equations Numériques,\" with\r\nLagrange's \"Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques,\" and \"Mécanique\r\nAnalytique,\" and finally with Laplace's \"Mécanique Céleste.\" I gave\r\nmyself up with great ardour to the study of these books. From the\r\njournal of the Polytechnic School containing such investigations as\r\nthose of M. Poisson on Elimination, I imagined that all the pupils were\r\nas much advanced as this geometer, and that it would be necessary to\r\nrise to this height to succeed.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment, I prepared myself for the artillery service,--the aim\r\nof my ambition; and as I had heard that an officer ought to understand\r\nmusic, fencing, and dancing, I devoted the first hours of each day to\r\nthe cultivation of these accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the time I was seen walking in the moats of the citadel of\r\nPerpignan, seeking by more or less forced transitions to pass from one\r\nquestion to another, so as to be sure of being able to show the examiner\r\nhow far my studies had been carried.[2]\r\n\r\nAt last the moment of examination arrived, and I went to Toulouse in\r\ncompany with a candidate who had studied at the public college. It was\r\nthe first time that pupils from Perpignan had appeared at the\r\ncompetition. My intimidated comrade was completely discomfited. When I\r\nrepaired after him to the board, a very singular conversation took\r\nplace between M. Monge (the examiner) and me.\r\n\r\n\"If you are going to answer like your comrade, it is useless for me to\r\nquestion you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, my comrade knows much more than he has shown; I hope I shall be\r\nmore fortunate than he; but what you have just said to me might well\r\nintimidate me and deprive me of all my powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Timidity is always the excuse of the ignorant; it is to save you from\r\nthe shame of a defeat that I make you the proposal of not examining\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of no greater shame than that which you now inflict upon me.\r\nWill you be so good as to question me? It is your duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You carry yourself very high, sir! We shall see presently whether this\r\nbe a legitimate pride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed, sir; I wait for you.\"\r\n\r\nM. Monge then put to me a geometrical question, which I answered in such\r\na way as to diminish his prejudices. From this he passed on to a\r\nquestion in algebra, then the resolution of a numerical equation. I had\r\nthe work of Lagrange at my fingers' ends; I analyzed all the known\r\nmethods, pointing out their advantages and effects; Newton's method, the\r\nmethod of recurring series, the method of depression, the method of\r\ncontinued fractions,--all were passed in review; the answer had lasted\r\nan entire hour. Monge, brought over now to feelings of great kindness,\r\nsaid to me, \"I could, from this moment, consider the examination at an\r\nend. I will, however, for my own pleasure, ask you two more questions.\r\nWhat are the relations of a curved line to the straight line that is a\r\ntangent to it?\" I looked upon this question as a particular case of the\r\ntheory of osculations which I had studied in Legrange's \"Fonctions\r\nAnalytiques.\" \"Finally,\" said the examiner to me, \"how do you determine\r\nthe tension of the various cords of which a funicular machine is\r\ncomposed?\" I treated this problem according to the method expounded in\r\nthe \"Mécanique Analytique.\" It was clear that Lagrange had supplied all\r\nthe resources of my examination.\r\n\r\nI had been two hours and a quarter at the board. M. Monge, going from\r\none extreme to the other, got up, came and embraced me, and solemnly\r\ndeclared that I should occupy the first place on his list. Shall I\r\nconfess it? During the examination of my comrade I had heard the\r\nToulousian candidates uttering not very favourable sarcasms on the\r\npupils from Perpignan; and it was principally for the sake of reparation\r\nto my native town that M. Monge's behaviour and declaration transported\r\nme with joy.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the Polytechnic School, at the end of 1803, I was placed\r\nin the excessively boisterous brigade of the Gascons and Britons. I\r\nshould have much liked to study thoroughly physics and chemistry, of\r\nwhich I did not even know the first rudiments; but the behaviour of my\r\ncompanions rarely left me any time for it. As for analysis, I had\r\nalready, before entering the Polytechnic School, learnt much more than\r\nwas required for leaving it.\r\n\r\nI have just related the strange words which M. Monge, junior, addressed\r\nto me at Toulouse in commencing my examination for admission. Something\r\nanalogous occurred at the opening of my examination in mathematics for\r\npassing from one division of the school to another. The examiner, this\r\ntime, was the illustrious geometer Legendre, of whom, a few years after,\r\nI had the honour of becoming the colleague and the friend.\r\n\r\nI entered his study at the moment when M. T----, who was to undergo his\r\nexamination before me, having fainted away, was being carried out in the\r\narms of two servants. I thought that this circumstance would have moved\r\nand softened M. Legendre; but it had no such effect \"What is your name,\"\r\nhe said to me sharply. \"Arago,\" I answered. \"You are not French then?\"\r\n\"If I was not French I should not be before you; for I have never heard\r\nof any one being admitted into the school unless his nationality had\r\nbeen proved.\" \"I maintain that he is not French whose name is Arago.\" \"I\r\nmaintain, on my side, that I am French, and a very good Frenchman too,\r\nhowever strange my name may appear to you.\" \"Very well; we will not\r\ndiscuss the point farther; go to the board.\"\r\n\r\nI had scarcely taken up the chalk, when M. Legendre, returning to the\r\nfirst subject of his preoccupations, said to me: \"You were born in one\r\nof the departments recently united to France?\" \"No, sir; I was born in\r\nthe department of the Eastern Pyrenees, at the foot of the Pyrenees.\"\r\n\"Oh! why did you not tell me that at once? all is now explained. You are\r\nof Spanish origin, are you not?\" \"Possibly; but in my humble family\r\nthere are no authentic documents preserved which could enable me to\r\ntrace back the civil position of my ancestors; each one there is the\r\nchild of his own deeds. I declare to you again that I am French, and\r\nthat ought to be sufficient for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe vivacity of this last answer had not disposed M. Legendre in my\r\nfavour. I saw this very soon; for, having put a question to me which\r\nrequired the use of double integrals, he stopped me, saying: \"The method\r\nwhich you are following was not given to you by the professor. Whence\r\ndid you get it?\" \"From one of your papers.\" \"Why did you choose it? was\r\nit to bribe me?\" \"No; nothing was farther from my thoughts. I only\r\nadopted it because it appeared to me preferable.\" \"If you are unable to\r\nexplain to me the reasons for your preference, I declare to you that you\r\nshall receive a bad mark, at least as to character.\"\r\n\r\nI then entered upon the details which established, as I thought, that\r\nthe method of double integrals was in all points more clear and more\r\nrational than that which Lacroix had expounded to us in the\r\namphitheatre. From this moment Legendre appeared to me to be satisfied,\r\nand to relent.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he asked me to determine the centre of gravity of a\r\nspherical sector. \"The question is easy,\" I said to him. \"Very well;\r\nsince you find it easy, I will complicate it: instead of supposing the\r\ndensity constant, I will suppose that it varies from the centre to the\r\nsurface according to a determined function.\" I got through this\r\ncalculation very happily; and from this moment I had entirely gained the\r\nfavour of the examiner. Indeed, on my retiring, he addressed to me these\r\nwords, which, coming from him, appeared to my comrades as a very\r\nfavourable augury for my chance of promotion: \"I see that you have\r\nemployed your time well; go on in the same way the second year, and we\r\nshall part very good friends.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mode of examination adopted at the Polytechnic School in 1804,\r\nwhich is always cited as being better than the present organization,\r\nroom was allowed for the exercise of some unjustifiable caprices. Would\r\nit be believed, for example, that the old M. Barruel examined two pupils\r\nat a time in physics, and gave them, it is said, the same mark, which\r\nwas the mean between the actual merits of the two? For my part, I was\r\nassociated with a comrade full of intelligence, but who had not studied\r\nthis branch of the course. We agreed that he should leave the answering\r\nto me, and we found the arrangement advantageous to both.\r\n\r\nAs I have been led to speak of the school as it was in 1804, I will say\r\nthat its faults were less those of organization than those of personal\r\nmanagement; for many of the professors were much below their office, a\r\nfact which gave rise to somewhat ridiculous scenes. The pupils, for\r\ninstance, having observed the insufficiency of M. Hassenfratz, made a\r\ndemonstration of the dimensions of the rainbow, full of errors of\r\ncalculation, but in which the one compensated the other so that the\r\nfinal result was true. The professor, who had only this result whereby\r\nto judge of the goodness of the answer, when he saw it appear on the\r\nboard, did not hesitate to call out, \"Good, good, perfectly good!\" which\r\nexcited shouts of laughter on all the benches of the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nWhen a professor has lost consideration, without which it is impossible\r\nfor him to do well, they allow themselves to insult him to an incredible\r\nextent. Of this I will cite a single specimen.\r\n\r\nA pupil, M. Leboullenger, met one evening in company this same M.\r\nHassenfratz, and had a discussion with him. When he reëntered the school\r\nin the morning, he mentioned this circumstance to us. \"Be on your\r\nguard,\" said one of our comrades to him; \"you will be interrogated this\r\nevening. Play with caution, for the professor has certainly prepared\r\nsome great difficulties so as to cause laughter at your expense.\"\r\n\r\nOur anticipations were not mistaken. Scarcely had the pupils arrived in\r\nthe amphitheatre, when M. Hassenfratz called to M. Leboullenger, who\r\ncame to the board.\r\n\r\n\"M. Leboullenger,\" said the professor to him, \"you have seen the moon?\"\r\n\"No, sir.\" \"How, sir! you say that you have never seen the moon?\" \"I can\r\nonly, repeat my answer--no, sir.\" Beside himself, and seeing his prey\r\nescape him, by means of this unexpected answer, M. Hassenfratz addressed\r\nhimself to the inspector charged with the observance of order that day,\r\nand said to him, \"Sir, there is M. Leboullenger, who pretends never to\r\nhave seen the moon.\" \"What would you wish me to do?\" stoically replied\r\nM. Le Brun. Repulsed on this side, the professor turned once more\r\ntowards M. Leboullenger, who remained calm and earnest in the midst of\r\nthe unspeakable amusement of the whole amphitheatre, and cried out with\r\nundisguised anger, \"You persist in maintaining that you have never seen\r\nthe moon?\" \"Sir,\" returned the pupil, \"I should deceive you if I told\r\nyou that I had not heard it spoken of, but I have never seen it.\" \"Sir,\r\nreturn to your place.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this scene, M. Hassenfratz was but a professor in name; his\r\nteaching could no longer be of any use.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the second year, I was appointed \"_chef de\r\nbrigade_.\" Hatchette had been professor of hydrography at Collioure; his\r\nfriends from Roussillon recommended me to him. He received me with great\r\nkindness, and even gave me a room in his lodgings. It was there that I\r\nhad the pleasure of making Poisson's acquaintance, who lived next to us.\r\nEvery evening the great geometer entered my room, and we passed entire\r\nhours in conversing on politics and mathematics, which is certainly not\r\nquite the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn the course of 1804, the school was a prey to political passions, and\r\nthat through the fault of the government.\r\n\r\nThey wished forthwith to oblige the pupils to sign an address of\r\ncongratulation on the discovery of the conspiracy in which Moreau was\r\nimplicated. They refused to do so on the ground that it was not for them\r\nto pronounce on a cause which had been in the hands of justice. It must,\r\nhowever, be remarked, that Moreau had not yet dishonoured himself by\r\ntaking service in the Russian army, which had come to attack the French\r\nunder the walls of Dresden.\r\n\r\nThe pupils were invited to make a manifestation in favour of the\r\ninstitution of the Legion of Honour. This again they refused. They knew\r\nwell that the cross, given without inquiry and without control, would\r\nbe, in most cases, the recompense of charlatanism, and not of true\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the Consular into the Imperial Government gave\r\nrise to very animated discussions in the interior of the school.\r\n\r\nMany pupils refused to add their felicitations to the mean adulations of\r\nthe constituted bodies.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lacuée, who was appointed governor of the school, reported this\r\nopposition to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"M. Lacuée,\" cried Napoleon, in the midst of a group of courtiers, who\r\napplauded with speech and gesture, \"you cannot retain at the school\r\nthose pupils who have shown such ardent Republicanism; you will send\r\nthem away.\" Then, collecting himself, he added, \"I will first know their\r\nnames and their stages of promotion.\" Seeing the list the next day, he\r\ndid not proceed further than the first name, which was the first in the\r\nartillery. \"I will not drive away the first men in advancement,\" said\r\nhe. \"Ah! if they had been at the bottom of the list! M. Lacuée, leave\r\nthem alone.\"\r\n\r\nNothing was more curious than the _séance_ to which General Lacuée came\r\nto receive the oath of obedience from the pupils. In the vast\r\namphitheatre which contained them, one could not discern a trace of the\r\ngravity which such a ceremony should inspire. The greater part, instead\r\nof answering, at the call of their names, \"I swear it,\" cried out,\r\n\"Present.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once the monotony of this scene was interrupted by a pupil, son\r\nof the Conventionalist Brissot, who called out in a stentorian voice, \"I\r\nwill not take the oath of obedience to the Emperor.\" Lacuée, pale and\r\nwith little presence of mind, ordered a detachment of armed pupils\r\nplaced behind him to go and arrest the recusant. The detachment, of\r\nwhich I was at the head, refused to obey. Brissot, addressing himself to\r\nthe General, with the greatest calmness said to him, \"Point out the\r\nplace to which you wish me to go; do not force the pupils to dishonour\r\nthemselves by laying hands on a comrade who has no desire to resist.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Brissot was expelled.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, M. Méchain, who had been sent to Spain to prolong the\r\nmeridional line as far as Formentera, died at Castellon de la Plana. His\r\nson, Secretary at the Observatory, immediately gave in his resignation.\r\nPoisson offered me the situation. I declined his first proposal. I did\r\nnot wish to renounce the military career,--the object of all my\r\npredilections, and in which, moreover, I was assured of the protection\r\nof Marshal Lannes,--a friend of my father's. Nevertheless I accepted, on\r\ntrial, the position offered me in the Observatory, after a visit which I\r\nmade to M. de Laplace in company with M. Poisson, under the express\r\ncondition that I could re-enter the Artillery if that should suit me. It\r\nwas from this cause that my name remained inscribed on the list of the\r\npupils of the school. I was only detached to the Observatory on a\r\nspecial service.\r\n\r\nI entered this establishment, then, on the nomination of Poisson, my\r\nfriend, and through the intervention of Laplace. The latter loaded me\r\nwith civilities. I was happy and proud when I dined in the Rue de\r\nTournon with the great geometer. My mind and my heart were much disposed\r\nto admire all, to respect all, that was connected with him who had\r\ndiscovered the cause of the secular equation of the moon, had found in\r\nthe movement of this planet the means of calculating the ellipticity of\r\nthe earth, had traced to the laws of attraction the long inequalities of\r\nJupiter and of Saturn, &c. &c. But what was my disenchantment, when one\r\nday I heard Madame de Laplace, approaching her husband, say to him,\r\n\"Will you entrust to me the key of the sugar?\"\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, a second incident affected me still more vividly.\r\nM. de Laplace's son was preparing for the examinations of the\r\nPolytechnic School. He came sometimes to see me at the Observatory. In\r\none of his visits I explained to him the method of continued fractions,\r\nby help of which Lagrange obtains the roots of numerical equations. The\r\nyoung man spoke of it to his father with admiration. I shall never\r\nforget the rage which followed the words of Emile de Laplace, and the\r\nseverity of the reproaches which were addressed to me, for having\r\npatronized a mode of proceeding which may be very long in theory, but\r\nwhich evidently can in no way be found fault with on the score of its\r\nelegance and precision. Never had a jealous prejudice shown itself more\r\nopenly, or under a more bitter form. \"Ah!\" said I to myself, \"how true\r\nwas the inspiration of the ancients when they attributed weaknesses to\r\nhim who nevertheless made Olympus tremble by a frown!\"\r\n\r\nHere I should mention, in order of time, a circumstance which might have\r\nproduced the most fatal consequences for me. The fact was this:--\r\n\r\nI have described above, the scene which caused the expulsion of\r\nBrissot's son from the Polytechnic School. I had entirely lost sight of\r\nhim for several months, when he came to pay me a visit at the\r\nObservatory, and placed me in the most delicate, the most terrible,\r\nposition that an honest man ever found himself in.\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen you,\" he said to me, \"because since leaving the school\r\nI have practised daily firing with a pistol; I have now acquired a skill\r\nbeyond the common, and I am about to employ it in ridding France of the\r\ntyrant who has confiscated all her liberties. My measures are taken: I\r\nhave hired a small room on the Carrousel, close to the place by which\r\nNapoleon, on coming out from the court, will pass to review the cavalry;\r\nfrom the humble window of my apartment will the ball be fired which will\r\ngo through his head.\"\r\n\r\nI leave it to be imagined with what despair I received this confidence.\r\nI made every imaginable effort to deter Brissot from his sinister\r\nproject; I remarked how all those who had rushed on enterprises of this\r\nnature had been branded in history by the odious title of assassin.\r\nNothing succeeded in shaking his fatal resolution; I only obtained from\r\nhim a promise on his honour that the execution of it should be postponed\r\nfor a time, and I put myself in quest of means for rendering it\r\nabortive.\r\n\r\nThe idea of announcing Brissot's project to the authorities did not\r\neven enter my thoughts. It seemed a fatality which came to smite me, and\r\nof which I must undergo the consequences, however serious they might be.\r\n\r\nI counted much on the solicitations of Brissot's mother, already so\r\ncruelly tried during the revolution. I went to her home, in the Rue de\r\nCondé, and implored her earnestly to coöperate with me in preventing her\r\nson from carrying out his sanguinary resolution. \"Ah, sir,\" replied this\r\nlady, who was naturally a model of gentleness, \"if Silvain\" (this was\r\nthe name of her son) \"believes that he is accomplishing a patriotic\r\nduty, I have neither the intention nor the desire to turn him from his\r\nproject.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from myself that I must henceforth draw all my resources. I had\r\nremarked that Brissot was addicted to the composition of romances and\r\npieces of poetry. I encouraged this passion, and every Sunday, above\r\nall, when I knew that there would be a review, I went to fetch him, and\r\ndrew him into the country, in the environs of Paris. I listened then\r\ncomplacently to the reading of those chapters of his romance which he\r\nhad composed during the week.\r\n\r\nThe first excursions frightened me a little, for armed with his pistols,\r\nBrissot seized every occasion of showing his great skill; and I\r\nreflected that this circumstance would lead to my being considered as\r\nhis accomplice, if he ever carried out his project. At last, his\r\npretensions to literary fame, which I flattered to the utmost, the hopes\r\n(though I had none myself) which I led him to conceive of the success of\r\nan attachment of which he had confided the secret to me, made him\r\nreceive with attention the reflections which I constantly made to him on\r\nhis enterprise. He determined on making a journey beyond the seas, and\r\nthus relieved me from the most serious anxiety which I have experienced\r\nin all my life.\r\n\r\nBrissot died after having covered the walls of Paris with printed\r\nhandbills in favour of the Bourbon restoration.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely entered the Observatory, when I became the\r\nfellow-labourer of Biot in researches on the refraction of gases,\r\nalready commenced by Borda.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this work the celebrated academician and I often\r\nconversed on the interest there would be in resuming in Spain the\r\nmeasurement interrupted by the death of Méchain. We submitted our\r\nproject to Laplace, who received it with ardour, procured the necessary\r\nfunds, and the Government confided to us two this important mission.\r\n\r\nM. Biot, I, and the Spanish commissary Rodriguez departed from Paris in\r\nthe commencement of 1806. We visited, on our way, the stations indicated\r\nby Méchain; we made some important modifications in the projected\r\ntriangulation, and at once commenced operations.\r\n\r\nAn inaccurate direction given to the reflectors established at Iviza, on\r\nthe mountain Campvey, rendered the observations made on the continent\r\nextremely difficult. The light of the signal of Campvey was very rarely\r\nseen, and I was, during six months, in the _Desierto de las Palmas_,\r\nwithout being able to see it, whilst at a later period the light\r\nestablished at the Desierto, but well directed, was seen every evening\r\nfrom Campvey. It will easily be imagined what must be the _ennui_\r\nexperienced by a young and active astronomer, confined to an elevated\r\npeak, having for his walk only a space of twenty square metres, and for\r\ndiversion only the conversation of two Carthusians, whose convent was\r\nsituated at the foot of the mountain, and who came in secret,\r\ninfringing the rule of their order.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I write these lines, old and infirm, my legs scarcely\r\nable to sustain me, my thoughts revert involuntarily to that epoch of my\r\nlife when, young and vigorous, I bore the greatest fatigues, and walked\r\nday and night, in the mountainous countries which separate the kingdoms\r\nof Valencia and Catalonia from the kingdom of Aragon, in order to\r\nreëstablish our geodesic signals which the storms had overset.\r\n\r\nI was at Valencia towards the middle of October, 1806. One morning early\r\nthe French consul entered my room quite alarmed: \"Here is sad news,\"\r\nsaid M. Lanusse to me; \"make preparations for your departure; the whole\r\ntown is in agitation; a declaration of war against France has just been\r\npublished; it appears that we have experienced a great disaster in\r\nPrussia. The Queen, we are assured, has put herself at the head of the\r\ncavalry and of the royal guard; a part of the French army has been cut\r\nto pieces; the rest is completely routed. Our lives would not be in\r\nsafety if we remained here; the French ambassador at Madrid will inform\r\nme as soon as an American vessel now at anchor in the 'Grao' of Valencia\r\ncan take us on board, and I will let you know as soon as the moment is\r\ncome.\" This moment never came; for a few days afterwards the false news,\r\nwhich one must suppose had dictated the proclamation of the Prince of\r\nthe Peace, was replaced by the bulletin of the battle of Jéna. People\r\nwho at first played the braggart and threatened to root us out, suddenly\r\nbecame disgracefully cast down; we could walk in the town, holding up\r\nour heads, without fear henceforth of being insulted.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation, in which they spoke of the critical circumstances in\r\nwhich the Spanish nation was placed; of the difficulties which\r\nencompassed this people; of the safety of their native country; of\r\nlaurels, and of the god of victory; of enemies with whom they ought to\r\nfight;--did not contain the name of France. They availed themselves of\r\nthis omission (will it be believed?) to maintain that it was directed\r\nagainst Portugal.\r\n\r\nNapoleon pretended to believe in this absurd interpretation; but from\r\nthis moment it became evident that Spain would sooner or later be\r\nobliged to render a strict account of the warlike intentions which she\r\nhad suddenly evinced in 1806; this, without justifying the events of\r\nBayonne, explains them in a very natural way.\r\n\r\nI was expecting M. Biot at Valencia, he having undertaken to bring some\r\nnew instruments with which we were to measure the latitude of\r\nFormentera. I shall take advantage of these short intervals of repose to\r\ninsert here some details of manners, which may, perhaps, be read with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nI will recount, in the first instance, an adventure which nearly cost me\r\nmy life under somewhat singular circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne day, as a recreation, I thought I could go, with a\r\nfellow-countryman, to the fair at Murviedro, the ancient Saguntum, which\r\nthey told me was very curious. I met in the town the daughter of a\r\nFrenchman resident at Valencia, Madlle. B----. All the hotels were\r\ncrowded; Madlle. B---- invited us to take some refreshments at her\r\ngrandmother's; we accepted; but on leaving the house she informed us\r\nthat our visit had not been to the taste of her betrothed, and that we\r\nmust be prepared for some sort of attack on his part; we went directly\r\nto an armourer's, bought some pistols, and commenced our return to\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\nOn our way I said to the calezero (driver), a man whom I had employed\r\nfor a long time, and who was much devoted to me:--\r\n\r\n\"Isidro, I have some reason to believe that we shall be stopped; I warn\r\nyou of it, so that you may not be surprised at the shots which will be\r\nfired from the caleza (vehicle).\"\r\n\r\nIsidro, seated on the shaft, according to the custom of the country,\r\nanswered:--\r\n\r\n\"Your pistols are completely useless, gentlemen; leave me to act; one\r\ncry will be enough; my mule will rid us of two, three, or even four\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely one minute had elapsed after the calezero had uttered these\r\nwords, when two men presented themselves before the mule and seized her\r\nby the nostrils. At the same instant a formidable cry, which will never\r\nbe effaced from my remembrance,--the cry of _Capitana!_--was uttered by\r\nIsidro. The mule reared up almost vertically, raising up one of the men,\r\ncame down again, and set off at a rapid gallop. The jolt which the\r\ncarriage made led us to understand too well what had just occurred. A\r\nlong silence succeeded this incident; it was only interrupted by these\r\nwords of the calezero, \"Do you not think, gentlemen, that my mule is\r\nworth more than any pistols?\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the captain-general, Don Domingo Izquierdo, related to me\r\nthat a man had been found crushed on the road to Murviedro. I gave him\r\nan account of the prowess of Isidro's mule, and no more was said.\r\n\r\nOne anecdote, taken from among a thousand, will show what an adventurous\r\nlife was led by the delegate of the _Bureau of Longitude_.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay on a mountain near Cullera, to the north of the mouth of\r\nthe river Xucar, and to the south of the Albuféra, I once conceived the\r\nproject of establishing a station on the high mountains which are in\r\nfront of it. I went to see them. The alcaid of one of the neighbouring\r\nvillages warned me of the danger to which I was about to expose myself.\r\n\"These mountains,\" said he to me, \"form the resort of a band of highway\r\nrobbers.\" I asked for the national guard, as I had the power to do so.\r\nMy escort was supposed by the robbers to be an expedition directed\r\nagainst them, and they dispersed themselves at once over the rich plain\r\nwhich is watered by the Xucar. On my return I found them engaged in\r\ncombat with the authorities of Cullera. Wounds had been given on both\r\nsides, and, if I recollect right, one alguazil was left dead on the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I regained my station. The following night was a\r\nhorrible one; the rain fell in a deluge. Towards night, there was\r\nknocking at my cabin door. To the question \"Who is there?\" the answer\r\nwas, \"A custom-house guard, who asks of you a shelter for some hours.\"\r\nMy servant having opened the door to him, I saw a magnificent man enter,\r\narmed to the teeth. He laid himself down on the earth, and went to\r\nsleep. In the morning, as I was chatting with him at the door of my\r\ncabin, his eyes flashed on seeing two persons on the slope of the\r\nmountain, the alcaid of Cullera and his principal alguazil, who were\r\ncoming to pay me a visit. \"Sir,\" cried he, \"nothing less than the\r\ngratitude which I owe to you, on account of the service which you have\r\nrendered to me this night, could prevent my seizing this occasion for\r\nridding myself, by one shot of this carabine, of my most cruel enemy.\r\nAdieu, sir!\" And he departed, springing from rock to rock as light as a\r\ngazelle.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the cabin, the alcaid and his alguazil recognized in the\r\nfugitive the chief of all the brigands in the country.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, the weather having again become very bad, I\r\nreceived a second visit from the pretended custom-house guard, who went\r\nsoundly to sleep in my cabin. I saw that my servant, an old soldier, who\r\nhad heard the recital of the deeds and behaviour of this man, was\r\npreparing to kill him. I jumped down from my camp bed, and, seizing my\r\nservant by the throat,--\"Are you mad?\" said I to him; \"are we to\r\ndischarge the duties of police in this country? Do you not see,\r\nmoreover, that this would expose us to the resentment of all those who\r\nobey the orders of this redoubted chief? And we should thus render it\r\nimpossible for us to terminate our operations.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, when the sun rose, I had a conversation with my guest,\r\nwhich I will try to reproduce faithfully.\r\n\r\n\"Your situation is perfectly known to me; I know that you are not a\r\ncustom-house guard; I have learnt from certain information that you are\r\nthe chief of the robbers of the country. Tell me whether I have any\r\nthing to fear from your confederates?\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea of robbing you did occur to us; but we concluded that all your\r\nfunds would be in the neighbouring towns; that you would carry no money\r\nto the summit of mountains, where you would not know what to do with it,\r\nand that our expedition against you could have no fruitful result.\r\nMoreover, we cannot pretend to be as strong as the King of Spain. The\r\nKing's troops leave us quietly enough to exercise our industry; but on\r\nthe day that we molested an envoy from the Emperor of the French, they\r\nwould direct against us several regiments, and we should soon have to\r\nsuccumb. Allow me to add, that the gratitude which I owe to you is your\r\nsurest guarantee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will trust in your words; I shall regulate my conduct by\r\nyour answer. Tell me if I can travel at night? It is fatiguing to me to\r\nmove from one station to another in the day under the burning influence\r\nof the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do so, sir; I have already given my orders to this purpose;\r\nthey will not be infringed.\"\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, I left for Denia; it was midnight, when some\r\nhorsemen rode up to me, and addressed these words to me:--\r\n\r\n\"Stop there, señor; times are hard; those who have something must aid\r\nthose who have nothing. Give us the keys of your trunks; we will only\r\ntake your superfluities.\"\r\n\r\nI had already obeyed their orders, when it came into my head to call\r\nout--\"But I have been told, that I could travel without risk.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Francisco Arago.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hombre! vaya usted con Dios_ (God be with you).\"\r\n\r\nAnd our cavaliers, spurring away from us, rapidly lost themselves in a\r\nfield of \"algarrobos.\"\r\n\r\nWhen _my friend_ the robber of Cullera assured me that I had nothing to\r\nfear from his subordinates, he informed me at the same time that his\r\nauthority did not extend north of Valencia. The banditti of the northern\r\npart of the kingdom obeyed other chiefs; one of whom, after having been\r\ntaken, was condemned and hung, and his body divided into four quarters,\r\nwhich were fastened to posts, on four royal roads, but not without\r\ntheir having previously been boiled in oil, to make sure of their longer\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThis barbarous custom produced no effect; for scarcely was one chief\r\ndestroyed before another presented himself to replace him.\r\n\r\nOf all these brigands those had the worst reputation who carried on\r\ntheir depredations in the environs of Oropeza. The proprietors of the\r\nthree mules, on which M. Rodriguez, I, and my servant were riding one\r\nevening in this neighbourhood, were recounting to us the \"grand deeds\"\r\nof these robbers, which, even in full daylight, would have made the hair\r\nof one's head stand on end, when, by the faint light of the moon, we\r\nperceived a man hiding himself behind a tree; we were six, and yet this\r\nsentry on horseback had the audacity to demand our purses or our lives:\r\nmy servant, at once answered him--\"You must then believe us to be very\r\ncowardly; take yourself off, or I will bring you down by one shot of my\r\ncarabine.\" \"I will be off,\" returned the worthless fellow \"but you will\r\nsoon hear news of me.\" Still full of fright at the remembrance of the\r\nstories which they had just been relating, the three \"arieros\" besought\r\nus to quit the high road and cast ourselves into a wood which was on our\r\nleft. We yielded to their proposal; but we lost our way. \"Dismount,\"\r\nsaid they, \"the mules have been obeying the bridle and you have directed\r\nthem wrongly. Let us retrace our way as far as the high road, and leave\r\nthe mules to themselves, they will well know how to find their right way\r\nagain.\" Scarcely had we effected this manoeuvre, which succeeded\r\nmarvellously well, when we heard a lively discussion taking place at a\r\nshort distance from us. Some were saying: \"We must follow the high\r\nroad, and we shall meet with them.\" Others maintained that they must get\r\ninto the wood on the left. The barking of the dogs, by which these\r\nindividuals were accompanied, added to the tumult. During this time we\r\npursued our way silently, more dead than alive. It was two o'clock in\r\nthe morning. All at once we saw a faint light in a solitary house; it\r\nwas like a light-house for the mariner in the midst of the tempest, and\r\nthe only means of safety which remained to us. Arrived at the door of\r\nthe farm, we knocked and asked for hospitality. The inmates, very little\r\nreassured, feared that we were thieves, and did not hurry themselves to\r\nopen to us.\r\n\r\nImpatient at the delay, I cried out, as I had received authority to do\r\nso, \"In the name of the King, open to us!\" They obeyed an order thus\r\ngiven; we entered pell-mell, and in the greatest haste, men and mules,\r\ninto the kitchen, which was on the ground-floor; and we hurried to\r\nextinguish the lights, in order not to awaken the suspicions of the\r\nbandits who were seeking for us. Indeed, we heard them, passing and\r\nrepassing near the house, vociferating with the whole force of their\r\nlungs against their unlucky fate. We did not quit this solitary house\r\nuntil broad day, and we continued our route for Tortosa, not without\r\nhaving given a suitable recompense to our hosts. I wished to know by\r\nwhat providential circumstance they happened to have a lamp burning at\r\nthat unseasonable hour. \"We had killed a pig,\" they told me, \"in the\r\ncourse of the day, and we were busy preparing the black puddings.\" Had\r\nthe pig lived one day more, or had there been no black puddings, I\r\nshould certainly have been no longer in this world, and I should not\r\nhave the opportunity to relate the story of the robbers of Oropeza.\r\n\r\nNever could I better appreciate the intelligent measure by which the\r\nconstituent assembly abolished the ancient division of France into\r\nprovinces, and substituted its division into departments, than in\r\ntraversing for my triangulation the Spanish border kingdoms of\r\nCatalonia, Valencia, and Aragon. The inhabitants of these three\r\nprovinces detested each other cordially, and nothing less than the bond\r\nof a common hatred was necessary to make them act simultaneously against\r\nFrance. Such was their animosity in 1807 that I could scarcely make use\r\nat the same time of Catalonians, Aragons, and Valencians, when I moved\r\nwith my instruments from one station to another. The Valencians, in\r\nparticular, were treated by the Catalonians as a light, trifling,\r\ninconsistent people. They were in the habit of saying to me, \"_En el\r\nreino de Valencia la carne es verdura, la verdura agua, los hombres\r\nmugeres, las mugeres nada_\"; which may be translated thus: \"In the\r\nkingdom of Valencia meat is a vegetable, vegetables are water, men are\r\nwomen, and women nothing.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Valencians, speaking of the Aragons, used to call\r\nthem \"_schuros_.\"\r\n\r\nHaving asked of a herdsman of this province who had brought some goats\r\nnear to one of my stations, what was the origin of this denomination, at\r\nwhich his compatriots showed themselves so offended:\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said he, smiling cunningly at me, \"whether I dare\r\nanswer you.\" \"Go on, go on,\" I said to him, \"I can hear anything without\r\nbeing angry.\" \"Well, the word _schuros_ means that, to our great shame,\r\nwe have sometimes been governed by French kings. The sovereign, before\r\nassuming power, was bound to promise under oath to respect our freedom\r\nand to articulate in a loud voice the solemn words _lo Juro!_ As he did\r\nnot know how to pronounce the J he said _schuro_. Are you satisfied,\r\nseñor?\" I answered him, \"Yes, yes. I see that vanity and pride are not\r\ndead in this country.\"\r\n\r\nSince I have just spoken of a shepherd, I will say that in Spain, the\r\nclass of individuals of both sexes destined to look after herds,\r\nappeared to me always less further removed than in France, from the\r\npictures which the ancient poets have left us of the shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses in their pastoral poetry. The songs by which they\r\nendeavour to while away the tedium of their monotonous life, are more\r\nremarkable in their form and substance than in the other European\r\nnations to which I have had access. I never recollect without surprise,\r\nthat being on a mountain situated at the junction-point of the kingdoms\r\nof Valencia, Aragon, and Catalonia, I was all at once overtaken by a\r\nviolent storm, which forced me to take refuge in my tent, and to remain\r\nthere squatting on the ground. When the storm was over and I came out\r\nfrom my retreat, I heard, to my great astonishment, on an isolated peak\r\nwhich looked down upon my station, a shepherdess who was singing a song\r\nof which I only recollect these eight lines, which will give an idea of\r\nthe rest:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A los que amor no saben\r\n       Ofreces las dulzuras\r\n     Y a mi las amarguras\r\n       Que s'e lo quo es amar.\r\n\r\n     Las gracias al me certé\r\n       Eran cuadro de flores\r\n     Te cantaban amores\r\n       Por hacerte callar.\r\n\r\nOh! how much sap there is in this Spanish nation! What a pity that they\r\nwill not make it yield fruit!\r\n\r\nIn 1807, the tribunal of the Inquisition existed still at Valencia, and\r\nat times performed its functions. The reverend fathers, it is true, did\r\nnot burn people, but they pronounced sentences in which the ridiculous\r\ncontended with the odious. During my residence in this town, the holy\r\noffice had to busy itself about a pretended sorceress; it doomed her to\r\ngo through all quarters of the town astride on an ass, her face turned\r\ntowards the tail, and naked down to the waist. Merely to observe the\r\ncommonest rules of decency, the poor woman had been plastered with a\r\nsticky substance, partly honey, they told me, to which adhered an\r\nenormous quantity of little feathers, so that to say the truth, the\r\nvictim resembled a fowl with a human head. The procession, whether\r\nattended by a crowd I leave it to be imagined, stationed itself for some\r\ntime in the cathedral square, where I lived. I was told that the\r\nsorceress was struck on the back a certain number of blows with a\r\nshovel; but I do not venture to affirm this, for I was absent at the\r\nmoment when this hideous procession passed before my windows.\r\n\r\nWe thus see, however, what sort of spectacles were given to the people\r\nin the commencement of the nineteenth century, in one of the principal\r\ntowns of Spain, the seat of a celebrated university, and the native\r\ncountry of numerous citizens distinguished by their knowledge, their\r\ncourage, and their virtues. Let not the friends of humanity and of\r\ncivilization disunite; let them form, on the contrary, an indissoluble\r\nunion, for superstition is always on the watch, and waits for the moment\r\nagain to seize its prey.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned in the course of my narrative that two Carthusians\r\noften left their convent in the _Desierto de las Palmas_, and came,\r\nthough prohibited, to see me at my station, situated about two hundred\r\nmetres higher. A few particulars will give an idea of what certain monks\r\nwere, in the Peninsula, in 1807.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Father Trivulce, was old; the other was very young. The\r\nformer, of French origin, had played a part at Marseilles, in the\r\ncounter-revolutionary events of which this town was the theatre, at the\r\ncommencement of our first revolution. His part had been a very active\r\none; one might see the proof of this in the scars of sabre cuts which\r\nfurrowed his breast. It was he who was the first to come. When he saw\r\nhis young comrade march up, he hid himself; but as soon as the latter\r\nhad fully entered into conversation with me, Father Trivulce showed\r\nhimself all at once. His appearance had the effect of Medusa's head.\r\n\"Reassure yourself,\" said he to his young compeer; \"only let us not\r\ndenounce each other, for our prior is not a man to pardon us for having\r\ncome here and infringed our vow of silence, and we should both receive a\r\npunishment, the recollection of which would long remain.\" The treaty was\r\nat once concluded, and from that day forward the two Carthusians came\r\nvery often to converse with me.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of our two visitors was an Aragonian, his family had made\r\nhim a monk against his will. He related to me one day, before M. Biot,\r\n(then returned from Tarragon, where he had taken refuge to get cured of\r\nhis fever,) some particulars which, according to him, proved that in\r\nSpain there was no longer more than the ghost of religion. These details\r\nwere mostly borrowed from the secrets of confession. M. Biot manifested\r\nsharply the displeasure which this conversation caused him; there were\r\neven in his language some words which led the monk to suppose that M.\r\nBiot took him for a kind of spy. As soon as this suspicion had entered\r\nhis mind, he quitted us without saying a word, and the next morning I\r\nsaw him come up early, armed with a light gun. The French monk had\r\npreceded him, and had whispered in my ear the danger that threatened my\r\ncompanion. \"Join with me,\" he said, \"to turn the young Aragonian monk\r\nfrom his murderous project.\" I need scarcely say that I employed myself\r\nwith ardour in this negotiation, in which I had the happiness to\r\nsucceed. There were here, as must be seen, the materials for a chief of\r\n_guerilleros_. I should be much astonished if my young monk did not play\r\nhis part in the war of independence.\r\n\r\nThe anecdote which I am about to relate will amply prove that religion\r\nwas, with the Carthusian monks of the _Desierto de las Palmas_, not the\r\nconsequence of elevated sentiments, but a mere compound of superstitious\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nThe scene with the gun, always present to my mind, seemed to make it\r\nclear to me that the Aragon monk, if actuated by his passions, would be\r\ncapable of the most criminal actions. Hence, I had a very disagreeable\r\nimpression when one Sunday, having come down to hear mass, I met this\r\nmonk, who, without saying a word, conducted me by a series of dark\r\ncorridors into a chapel where the daylight penetrated only by a very\r\nsmall window. There I found Father Trivulce, who prepared himself to say\r\nmass for me alone. The young monk assisted. All at once, an instant\r\nbefore the consecration, Father Trivulce, turning towards me, said these\r\nexact words: \"We have permission to say mass with white wine; we\r\ntherefore make use of that which we gather from our own vines: this wine\r\nis very good. Ask the prior to let you taste it, when on leaving this\r\nyou go to breakfast with him. For the rest, you can assure yourself this\r\ninstant of the truth of what I say to you.\" And he presented me the\r\ngoblet to drink from. I resisted strongly, not only because I considered\r\nit indecent to give this invitation in the middle of the mass, but\r\nbecause, besides, I must own I conceived the thought for a moment that\r\nthe monks wished, by poisoning me, to revenge themselves on me for M.\r\nBiot having insulted them. I found that I was mistaken, that my\r\nsuspicions had no foundation; for Father Trivulce went on with the\r\ninterrupted mass, drank, and drank largely, of the white wine contained\r\nin one of the goblets. But when I had got out of the hands of the two\r\nmonks, and was able to breathe the pure air of the country, I\r\nexperienced a lively satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe right of asylum accorded to some churches was one of the most\r\nobnoxious privileges among those of which the revolution of 1789 rid\r\nFrance. In 1807, this right still existed in Spain, and belonged, I\r\nbelieve, to all the cathedrals. I learnt, during my stay at Barcelona,\r\nthat there was, in a little cloister contiguous to the largest church of\r\nthe town, a brigand,--a man guilty of several assassinations, who lived\r\nquietly there, guaranteed against all pursuit by the sanctity of the\r\nplace. I wished to assure myself with my own eyes of the reality of the\r\nfact, and I went with my friend Rodriguez into the little cloister in\r\nquestion. The assassin was then eating a meal which a woman had just\r\nbrought him. He easily guessed the object of our visit, and made\r\nimmediately such demonstrations as convinced us that, if the asylum was\r\nsafe for the robber, it would not be so long for us. We retired at once,\r\ndeploring that, in a country calling itself civilized, there should\r\nstill exist such crying, such monstrous abuses.\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed in our geodesic operations, to obtain the\r\ncöoperation of the inhabitants of the villages near our stations, it was\r\ndesirable for us to be recommended to the priests. We went,\r\ntherefore,--M. Lanusse, the French Vice-Consul, M. Biot, and I,--to pay\r\na visit to the Archbishop of Valencia, to solicit his protection. This\r\narchbishop, a man of very tall figure, was then chief of the\r\nFranciscans; his costume more than negligent, his gray robe, covered\r\nwith tobacco, contrasted with the magnificence of the archiepiscopal\r\npalace. He received us with kindness, and promised us all the\r\nrecommendations we desired; but, at the moment of taking leave of him,\r\nthe whole affair seemed to be spoiled. M. Lanusse and M. Biot went out\r\nof the reception room without kissing the hand of his grace, although he\r\nhad presented it to each of them very graciously. The archbishop\r\nindemnified himself on my poor person. A movement, which was very near\r\nbreaking my teeth, a gesture which I might justly call a blow of the\r\nfist, proved to me that the chief of the Franciscans, notwithstanding\r\nhis vow of humility, had taken offence at the want of ceremony in my\r\nfellow visitors. I was going to complain of the abrupt way in which he\r\nhad treated me, but I had the necessities of our trigonometrical\r\noperations before my eyes, and I was silent.\r\n\r\nBesides this, at the instant when the closed fist of the archbishop was\r\napplied to my lips, I was still thinking of the beautiful optical\r\nexperiments which it would have been possible to make with the\r\nmagnificent stone which ornamented his pastoral ring. This idea, I must\r\nfrankly declare, had preoccupied me during the whole of the visit.\r\n\r\nM. Biot having at last come to seek me again at Valencia, where I\r\nexpected, as I have before said, some new instruments, we went on to\r\nFormentera, the southern extremity of our arc, of which place we\r\ndetermined the latitude. M. Biot quitted me afterwards to return to\r\nParis, whilst I made the geodesical junction of the island of Majorca to\r\nIviza, and to Formentera, obtaining thus, by means of one single\r\ntriangle, the measure of an arc of parallel of one degree and a half.\r\n\r\nI then went to Majorca, to measure there the latitude and the azimuth.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch, the political fermentation, engendered by the entrance of\r\nthe French into Spain, began to invade the whole Peninsula and the\r\nislands dependent on it. This ferment had as yet in Majorca only reached\r\nto the ministers, the partisans, and the relations of the Prince of\r\nPeace. Each evening, I saw, drawn in triumph in the square of Palma, the\r\ncapital of the island of Majorca, on carriages, the effigies in flames,\r\nsometimes of the minister Soller, another time those of the bishop, and\r\neven those of private individuals supposed to be attached to the\r\nfortunes of the favourite Godoï. I was far from suspecting then that my\r\nturn would soon arrive.\r\n\r\nMy station at Majorca, the _Clop de Galazo_, a very high mountain, was\r\nsituated exactly over the port where _Don Jayme el Conquistator_\r\ndisembarked when he went to deliver the Balearic Islands from the Moors.\r\nThe report spread itself through the population that I had established\r\nmyself there in order to favour the arrival of the French army, and that\r\nevery evening I made signals to it. But these reports had nothing\r\nmenacing until the moment of the arrival at Palma, the 27th of May,\r\n1808, of an ordnance officer from Napoleon. This officer was M.\r\nBerthémie; he carried to the Spanish squadron, at Mahon, the order to go\r\nin all haste to Toulon. A general rising, which placed the life of this\r\nofficer in danger, followed the news of his mission. The Captain-General\r\nVivés only saved his life by shutting him up in the strong castle of\r\nBelver. They then bethought themselves of the Frenchman established on\r\nthe _Clop de Galazo_, and formed a popular expedition to go and seize\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nM. Damian, the owner of a small kind of vessel called a Mistic, which\r\nthe Spanish Government had placed at my disposal, was beforehand with\r\nthem, and brought me a costume by means of which I disguised myself. In\r\ndirecting myself towards Palma, in company with this brave seaman, we\r\nmet with the rioters who were going in search of me. They did not\r\nrecognize me, for I spoke Majorcan perfectly. I strongly encouraged the\r\nmen of this detachment to continue their route, and I pursued my way\r\ntowards Palma. At night I went on board the Mistic, commanded by Don\r\nManuel de Vacaro, whom the Spanish Government had placed under my\r\norders. I asked this officer if he would conduct me to Barcelona,\r\noccupied by the French, promising him that if they made any attempt to\r\nkeep him there, I would at once return and surrender myself a prisoner.\r\n\r\nDon Manuel, who up to this time had shown extreme obsequiousness towards\r\nme, had now no words but those of rudeness and distrust. There occurred\r\non the pier where the Mistic was moored a riotous movement, which Vacaro\r\nassured me was directed against me. \"Do not be uneasy,\" said he to me;\r\n\"if they should penetrate into the vessel you can hide yourself in this\r\ntrunk.\" I made the attempt; but the chest which he showed me was so\r\nsmall that my legs were entirely outside, and the cover could not be\r\nshut down. I understood perfectly what that meant, and I asked M. Vacaro\r\nto let me also be shut up in the castle of Belver. The order for\r\nincarceration having arrived from the captain-general, I got into the\r\nboat, where the sailors of the Mistic received me with emotion.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of their crossing the harbour the populace perceived me,\r\ncommenced a pursuit, and it was not without much difficulty that I\r\nreached Belver safe and sound. I had only, indeed, received on my way\r\none slight wound from a dagger in the thigh. Prisoners have often been\r\nseen to run with all speed _from_ their dungeon; I am the first,\r\nperhaps, to whom it has happened to do the reverse. This took place on\r\nthe 1st or 2d of June, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Belver was a very extraordinary personage. If he is\r\nstill alive he may demand of me a certificate as to his priority to the\r\nmodern hydropathists; the grenadier-captain maintained that pure water,\r\nsuitably administered, was a means of treatment for all illnesses, even\r\nfor amputations. By listening very patiently to his theories, and never\r\ninterrupting him, I won his good opinion. It was at his request, and\r\nfrom interest in our safety, that a Swiss garrison replaced the Spanish\r\ntroop which until then had been employed as the guard of Belver. It was\r\nalso through him that I one day learnt that a monk had proposed to the\r\nsoldiers who went to bring my food from the town, to put some poison\r\ninto one of the dishes.\r\n\r\nAll my old Majorcan friends had abandoned me at the moment of my\r\ndetention. I had had a very sharp correspondence with Don Manuel de\r\nVacaro in order to obtain the restitution of the passport of safety\r\nwhich the English Admiralty had granted to us. M. Rodriguez alone\r\nventured to visit me in full daylight, and bring me every consolation in\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nThe excellent M. Rodriguez, to while away the monotony of my\r\nincarceration, remitted to me from time to time the journals which were\r\nthen published at different parts of the Peninsula. He often sent them\r\nto me without reading them. Once I saw in these journals the recital of\r\nthe horrible massacres of which the town of Valencia--I make a mistake,\r\nthe _square of the Bull-fights_--had been the theatre, and in which\r\nnearly the whole of the French established in this town (more than 350)\r\nhad disappeared under the pike of the bull-fighter. Another journal\r\ncontained an article bearing this title: \"Relacion de la ahorcadura del\r\nseñor Arago e del señor Berthémie,\"--literally, \"Account of the\r\nexecution of M. Arago and M. Berthémie.\" This account spoke of the two\r\nexecuted men in very different terms. M. Berthémie was a Huguenot; he\r\nhad been deaf to all exhortations; he had spit in the face of the\r\necclesiastic who was present, and even on the image of Christ. As for\r\nme, I had conducted myself with much decency, and had allowed myself to\r\nbe hung without giving rise to any scandal. The writer also expressed\r\nhis regret that a young astronomer had been so weak as to associate\r\nhimself with treason, coming under the disguise of science to assist the\r\nentrance of the French army into a friendly kingdom.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this article I immediately made my decision: \"Since they\r\ntalk of my death,\" said I to my friend Rodriguez, \"the event will not be\r\nlong in coming. I should prefer being drowned to being hung. I will make\r\nmy escape from this fortress; it is for you to furnish me with the\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\nRodriguez, knowing better than any one how well founded my apprehensions\r\nwere, set himself at once to the work.\r\n\r\nHe went to the captain-general, and made him feel what would be the\r\ndanger of his position if I should disappear in a popular riot, or even\r\nif he were forced to give me up. His observations were so much the\r\nbetter comprehended, as no one could then predict what might be the\r\nissue of the Spanish revolution. \"I will undertake,\" said the\r\ncaptain-general Vivés to my colleague Rodriguez, \"to give an order to\r\nthe commander of the fortress, that when the right moment arrives, he\r\nshall allow M. Arago, and even the two or three other Frenchmen who are\r\nwith him in the castle of Belver, to pass out. They will then have no\r\nneed of the means of escape which they have procured; but I will take no\r\npart in the preparations which will become necessary to enable the\r\nfugitives to leave the island; I leave all that to your responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nRodriguez immediately conferred secretly with the brave commander\r\nDamian. It was agreed between them that Damian should take the command\r\nof a half-decked boat, which the wind had driven ashore; that he should\r\nequip it as if for a fishing expedition; that he should carry us to\r\nAlgiers; after which his reëntrance at Palmas, with or without fish,\r\nwould inspire no suspicion.\r\n\r\nAll was executed according to agreement, notwithstanding the\r\ninquisitorial surveillance which Don Manuel de Vacaro exercised over the\r\ncommander of his \"Mistic.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th July, 1808, we silently descended the hill on which Belver\r\nis built, at the same moment that the family of the minister Soller\r\nentered the fortress to escape the fury of the populace. Arrived at the\r\nshore, we found there Damian, his boat, and three sailors. We embarked\r\nat once, and set sail. Damian had taken the precaution of bringing with\r\nus in this frail vessel the instruments of value which he had carried\r\noff from my station at the Clop de Galazo. The sea was unfavourable;\r\nDamian thought it prudent to stop at the little island of Cabrera,\r\ndestined to become a short time afterwards so sadly celebrated by the\r\nsufferings which the soldiers of the army of Dupont experienced after\r\nthe shameful capitulation of Baylen. There a singular incident was very\r\nnear compromising all. Cabrera, tolerably near to the southern extremity\r\nof Majorca, is often visited by fishermen coming from that part of the\r\nisland. M. Berthémie feared, justly enough, that the rumour of our\r\nescape having spread about, they might dispatch some boats to seize us.\r\nHe looked upon our going into harbour as inopportune; I maintained that\r\nwe must yield to the prudence of the commander. During this discussion,\r\nthe three seamen whom Damian had engaged saw that M. Berthémie, whom I\r\nhad endeavoured to pass off as my servant, maintained his opinion\r\nagainst me on a footing of equality. They then addressed themselves in\r\nthese terms to the commander:--\r\n\r\n\"We only consented to take part in this expedition upon condition that\r\nthe Emperor's aide-de-camp, shut up at Belver, should not be of the\r\nnumber of those persons whom we should help off. We only wished to aid\r\nthe flight of the astronomer. Since it seems to be otherwise, you must\r\nleave this officer here, unless you would prefer to throw him into the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nDamian at once informed me of the imperative wishes of his boat's crew.\r\nM. Berthémie agreed with me to suffer some abuse such as could only be\r\ntolerated by a servant threatened by his master; all the suspicions\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nDamian, who feared also for himself the arrival of Majorcan fishermen,\r\nhastened to set sail on the 29th of July, 1808, the first moment that\r\nwas favourable, and we arrived at Algiers on the 3d of August.\r\n\r\nOur looks were anxiously directed towards the port, to guess what\r\nreception might await us. We were reassured by the sight of the\r\ntri-coloured flag, which was flying on two or three buildings. But we\r\nwere mistaken; these buildings were Dutch. Immediately upon our\r\nentrance, a Spaniard, whom, from his tone of authority, we took for a\r\nhigh functionary of the Regency, came up to Damian, and asked him: \"What\r\ndo you bring?\" \"I bring,\" answered the commander, \"four Frenchmen.\" \"You\r\nwill at once take them back again. I prohibit you from disembarking.\" As\r\nwe did not seem inclined to obey his order, our Spaniard, who was the\r\nconstructing engineer of the ships of the Dey, armed himself with a\r\npole, and commenced battering us with blows. But immediately a Genoese\r\nseaman, mounted on a neighbouring vessel, armed himself with an oar, and\r\nstruck our assailant both with edge and point. During this animated\r\ncombat we managed to land without any opposition. We had conceived a\r\nsingular idea of the manner in which the police act on the coast of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nWe pursued our way to the French Consul's, M. Dubois Thainville. He was\r\nat his country house. Escorted by the janissary of the consulate, we\r\nwent off towards this country house, one of the ancient residences of\r\nthe Dey, situated not far from the gate of Bab-azoum. The consul and his\r\nfamily received us with great amity, and offered us hospitality.\r\n\r\nSuddenly transported to a new continent, I looked forward anxiously to\r\nthe rising of the sun to enjoy all that Africa might offer of interest\r\nto a European, when all at once I believed myself to be engaged in a\r\nserious adventure. By the faint light of the dawn, I saw an animal\r\nmoving at the foot of my bed. I gave a kick with my foot: all movement\r\nceased. After some time, I felt the same movement made under my legs. A\r\nsharp jerk made this cease quickly. I then heard the fits of laughter of\r\nthe janissary, who lay on the couch in the same room as I did; and I\r\nsoon saw that he had simply placed on my bed a large hedgehog to amuse\r\nhimself by my uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe consul occupied himself the next day in procuring a passage for us\r\non board a vessel of the Regency which was going to Marseilles. M.\r\nFerrier, the Chancellor of the French Consulate, was at the same time\r\nConsul for Austria. He procured for us two false passports, which\r\ntransformed us--M. Berthémie and me--into two strolling merchants, the\r\none from _Schwekat_, in Hungary, the other from _Leoben_.\r\n\r\nThe moment of departure had arrived; the 13th of August, 1808, we were\r\non board, but our ship's company was not complete. The captain, whose\r\ntitle was Raï Braham Ouled Mustapha Goja, having perceived that the Dey\r\nwas on his terrace, and fearing punishment if he should delay to set\r\nsail, completed his crew at the expense of the idlers who were looking\r\non from the pier, and of whom the greater part were not sailors. These\r\npoor people begged as a favour for permission to go and inform their\r\nfamilies of this precipitate departure, and to get some clothes. The\r\ncaptain remained deaf to their remonstrances. We weighed anchor.\r\n\r\nThe vessel belonged to the Emir of Seca, Director of the Mint. The real\r\ncommander was a Greek captain, named Spiro Calligero. The cargo\r\nconsisted of a great number of _groups_. Amongst the passengers there\r\nwere five members of the family which the Bakri had succeeded as kings\r\nof the Jews; two ostrich-feather merchants, Moroccans; Captain Krog,\r\nfrom Berghen in Norway, who had sold his ship at Alicant; two lions sent\r\nby the Dey to the emperor Napoleon, and a great number of monkeys. Our\r\nvoyage was prosperous. Off Sardinia we met with an American ship coming\r\nout from Cagliari. A cannon-shot (we were armed with forty pieces of\r\nsmall power) warned the captain to come to be recognized. He brought on\r\nboard a certain number of counterparts of passports, one of which agreed\r\nperfectly with that which we carried. The captain being thus all right,\r\nwas not a little astonished when I ordered him, in the name of Captain\r\nBraham, to furnish us with tea, coffee, and sugar. The American captain\r\nprotested; he called us brigands, pirates, robbers. Captain Braham\r\nadmitted without difficulty all these qualifications, and persisted none\r\nthe less in the exaction of sugar, coffee, and tea.\r\n\r\nThe American, then driven to the last stage of exasperation, addressed\r\nhimself to me, who acted as interpreter, and cried out, \"Oh! rogue of a\r\nrenegade! if ever I meet you on holy ground I will break your head.\"\r\n\"Can you then suppose,\" I answered him, \"that I am here for my pleasure,\r\nand that, notwithstanding your menace, I would not rather go with you,\r\nif I could?\" These words calmed him; he brought the sugar, the coffee,\r\nand the tea claimed by the Moorish chief, and we again set sail, though\r\nwithout having exchanged the usual farewell.\r\n\r\nWe had already entered the Gulf of Lyons, and were approaching\r\nMarseilles, when on the 16th August, 1808, we met with a Spanish corsair\r\nfrom Palamos, armed at the prow with two twenty-four pounders. We made\r\nfull sail; we hoped to escape it: but a cannon-shot, a ball from which\r\nwent through our sails, taught us that she was a much better sailer than\r\nwe were.\r\n\r\nWe obeyed an injunction thus expressed, and awaited the great boat from\r\nthe corsair. The captain declared that he made us prisoners, although\r\nSpain was at peace with Barbary, under the pretext that we were\r\nviolating the blockade which had been lately raised on all the coasts of\r\nFrance: he added, that he intended to take us to Rosas, and that there\r\nthe authorities would decide on our fate.\r\n\r\nI was in the cabin of the vessel; I had the curiosity to look furtively\r\nat the crew of the boat, and there I perceived, with a dissatisfaction\r\nwhich may easily be imagined, one of the sailors of the \"Mistic,\"\r\ncommanded by Don Manuel de Vacaro, of the name of Pablo Blanco, of\r\nPalamos, who had often acted as my servant during my geodesic\r\noperations. My false passport would become from this moment useless, if\r\nPablo should recognize me: I went to bed at once, covered my head with\r\nthe counterpane, and lay as still as a statue.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days which elapsed between our capture and our entrance\r\ninto the roads of Rosas, Pablo, whose curiosity often brought him into\r\nthe room, used to exclaim, \"There is one passenger whom I have not yet\r\nmanaged to get a sight of.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Rosas it was decided that we should be placed in\r\nquarantine in a dismantled windmill, situated on the road leading to\r\nFigueras. I was careful to disembark in a boat to which Pablo did not\r\nbelong. The corsair departed for a new cruise, and I was for a moment\r\nfreed from the harassing thoughts which my old servant had caused me.\r\n\r\nOur ship was richly laden; the Spanish authorities were immediately\r\ndesirous to declare it a lawful prize. They pretended to believe that I\r\nwas the proprietor of it, and wished, in order to hasten things, to\r\ninterrogate me, even without awaiting the completion of the quarantine.\r\nThey stretched two cords between the mill and the shore, and a judge\r\nplaced himself in front of me. As the interrogatories were made from a\r\ngood distance, the numerous audience which encircled us took a direct\r\npart in the questions and answers. I will endeavour to reproduce this\r\ndialogue with all possible fidelity:--\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A poor roving merchant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence do you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"From a country where you certainly never were.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a word, what country is it?\"\r\n\r\nI was afraid to answer, for the passports, steeped in vinegar, were in\r\nthe hands of the judge-instructor, and I had forgotten whether I was\r\nfrom Schwekat or from Leoben. Finally I answered at all hazards:--\r\n\r\n\"I come from Schwekat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this information happily was found to agree with that of the\r\npassport.\r\n\r\n\"You are as much from Schwekat as I am,\" answered the judge. \"You are\r\nSpanish, and, moreover, a Spaniard from the kingdom of Valencia, as I\r\nperceive by your accent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you punish me, sir, because nature has endowed me with the gift\r\nof languages? I learn with facility the dialects of those countries\r\nthrough which I pass in the exercise of my trade; I have learnt, for\r\nexample, the dialect of Iviza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you shall be taken at your word. I see here a soldier from\r\nIviza; you shall hold a conversation with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I consent; I will even sing the goat song.\"\r\n\r\nEach of the verses of this song (if verses they be) terminates by an\r\nimitation of the bleating of the goat.\r\n\r\nI commenced at once, with an audacity at which I really feel astonished,\r\nto chant this air, which is sung by all the shepherds of the island.\r\n\r\n     Ah graciada señora\r\n     Una canzo bouil canta\r\n       Bè, bè, bè, bè.\r\n\r\n     No sera gaira pulida\r\n     Nosé si vos agradara\r\n       Bè, bè, bè, bè.\r\n\r\nAt once my Ivizacan, upon whom this air had the effect of the _ranz des\r\nvaches_ on the Swiss, declared, all in tears, that I was a native of\r\nIviza.\r\n\r\nI then said to the judge that if he would put me in communication with a\r\nperson knowing the French language, he would arrive at just as\r\nembarrassing a result. An _émigré_ officer of the Bourbon regiment\r\noffered at once to make the experiment, and, after some phrases\r\ninterchanged between us, affirmed without hesitation that I was French.\r\n\r\nThe judge, rendered impatient, exclaimed, \"Let us put an end to these\r\ntrials which decide nothing. I summon you, sir, to tell me who you are.\r\nI promise that your life will be safe if you answer me with sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"My greatest wish would be to give an answer to your satisfaction. I\r\nwill, then, try to do so; but I warn you that I am not going to tell you\r\nthe truth. I am son of the innkeeper at Mataro.\" \"I know that innkeeper;\r\nyou are not his son.\" \"You are right. I announced to you that I should\r\nvary my answers until one of them should suit you. I retract then, and\r\ntell you that I am a _titiretero_, (player of marionettes,) and that I\r\npractised at Lerida.\"\r\n\r\nA loud shout of laughter from the multitude encircling us greeted this\r\nanswer, and put an end to the questions.\r\n\r\n\"I swear by the d----l,\" exclaimed the judge, \"that I will discover\r\nsooner or later who you are!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he retired.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, the Moroccans, the Jews, who witnessed this interrogatory,\r\nunderstood nothing of it; they had only seen that I had not allowed\r\nmyself to be intimidated. At the close of the interview they came to\r\nkiss my hand, and gave me, from this moment, their entire confidence.\r\n\r\nI became their secretary for all the individual or collective\r\nremonstrances which they thought they had a right to address to the\r\nSpanish Government; and this right was incontestable. Every day I was\r\noccupied in drawing up petitions, especially in the name of the two\r\nostrich-feather merchants, one of whom called himself a tolerably near\r\nrelation of the Emperor of Morocco. Astonished at the rapidity with\r\nwhich I filled a page of my writing, they imagined, doubtless, that I\r\nshould write as fast in Arabic characters, when it should be requisite\r\nto transcribe passages from the Koran; and that this would form both for\r\nme and for them the source of a brilliant fortune, and they besought me,\r\nin the most earnest way, to become a Mahometan.\r\n\r\nVery little reassured by the last words of the judge, I sought means of\r\nsafety from another quarter.\r\n\r\nI was the possessor of a safe-conduct from the English Admiralty; I\r\ntherefore wrote a confidential letter to the captain of an English\r\nvessel, The Eagle, I think, which had cast anchor some days before in\r\nthe roads at Rosas. I explained to him my position. \"You can,\" I said to\r\nhim, \"claim me, because I have an English passport. If this proceeding\r\nshould cost you too much, have the goodness at least to take my\r\nmanuscripts and to send them to the Royal Society in London.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the soldiers who guarded us, and in whom I had fortunately\r\ninspired some interest, undertook to deliver my letter. The English\r\ncaptain came to see me; his name was, if my memory is right, George\r\nEyre. We had a private conversation on the shore. George Eyre thought,\r\nperhaps, that the manuscripts of my observations were contained in a\r\nregister bound in morocco, and with gilt edges to the leaves. When he\r\nsaw that these manuscripts were composed of single leaves, covered with\r\nfigures, which I had hidden under my shirt, disdain succeeded to\r\ninterest, and he quitted me hastily. Having returned on board, he wrote\r\nme a letter which I could find if needful, in which he said to me,--\"I\r\ncannot mix myself up in your affairs; address yourself to the Spanish\r\nGovernment; I am persuaded that it will do justice to your\r\nremonstrance, and will not molest you.\" As I had not the same persuasion\r\nas Captain George Eyre, I chose to take no notice of his advice.\r\n\r\nI ought to mention that some time after having related these particulars\r\nin England, at Sir Joseph Banks's, the conduct of George Eyre was\r\nseverely blamed; but when a man breakfasts and dines to the sound of\r\nharmonious music, can he accord his interest to a poor devil sleeping on\r\nstraw and nibbled by vermin, even though he have manuscripts under his\r\nshirt? I may add that I (unfortunately for me) had to do with a captain\r\nof an unusual character. For, some days later, a new vessel, The\r\nColossus, having arrived in the roads, the Norwegian, Captain Krog,\r\nalthough he had not, like me, an Admiralty passport, made an application\r\nto the commander of this new ship; he was immediately claimed, and\r\nrelieved from captivity.\r\n\r\nThe report that I was a Spanish deserter, and proprietor of the vessel,\r\nacquiring more and more credit, and this position being the most\r\ndangerous of all, I resolved to get out of it. I begged the commandant\r\nof the place, M. Alloy, to come to receive my declaration, and I\r\nannounced to him that I was French. To prove to him the truth of my\r\nwords, I invited him to send for Pablo Blanco, the sailor in the service\r\nof the corsair who took us, and who had returned from his cruise a short\r\ntime before. This was done as I wished. In disembarking, Pablo Blanco,\r\nwho had not been warned, exclaimed with surprise: \"What! you, Don\r\nFrancisco, mixed up with all these miscreants!\" The sailor gave the\r\nGovernor circumstantial evidence as to the mission which I fulfilled\r\nwith two Spanish commissaries. My nationality thus became proved.\r\n\r\nThat same day Alloy was replaced in the command of the fortress by the\r\nIrish Colonel of the Ultonian regiment; the corsair left for a fresh\r\ncruise, taking away Pablo Blanco; and I became once more the roving\r\nmerchant from Schwekat.\r\n\r\nFrom the windmill, where we underwent our quarantine, I could see the\r\ntricoloured flag flying on the fortress of Figueras. The reconnoitring\r\nparties of the cavalry came sometimes within five or six hundred metres;\r\nit would not then have been difficult for me to escape. However, as the\r\nregulations against those who violate the sanitary laws are very\r\nrigorous in Spain, as they pronounce the penalty of death against him\r\nwho infringes them, I only determined to make my escape on the eve of\r\nour admission to pratique.\r\n\r\nThe night being come I crept on all-fours along the briars, and I should\r\nsoon have got beyond the line of sentinels who guarded us. A noisy\r\nuproar which I heard among the Moors made me determine to reënter, and I\r\nfound these poor people in an unspeakable state of uneasiness, thinking\r\nthemselves lost if I left; I therefore remained.\r\n\r\nThe next day a strong picquet of troops presented itself before the\r\nmill. The manoeuvres made by it inspired all of us with anxiety, but\r\nespecially Captain Krog.[3] \"What will they do with us?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"Alas! you will see only too soon,\" replied the Spanish officer. This\r\nanswer made every one believe that they were going to shoot us. What\r\nmight have strengthened me in this idea was the obstinacy with which\r\nCaptain Krog and two other individuals of small size hid themselves\r\nbehind me. A handling of arms made us think that we had but a few\r\nseconds to live.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the feelings which I experienced on this solemn occasion, I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that the man who is led to death is not as\r\nunhappy as the public imagines him to be. Fifty ideas presented\r\nthemselves nearly simultaneously to my mind, and I did not rack my brain\r\nfor any of them; I only recollect the two following, which have remained\r\nengraved on my memory. On turning my head to the right, I saw the\r\nnational flag flying on the bastions of Figueras, and I said to myself,\r\n\"If I were to move a few hundred metres, I should be surrounded by\r\ncomrades, by friends, by fellow citizens, who would receive me\r\naffectionately. Here, without their being able to impute any crime to\r\nme, I am going to suffer death at twenty-two years of age.\" But what\r\nagitated me more deeply was this: looking towards the Pyrenees, I could\r\ndistinctly see their peaks, and I reflected that my mother, on the other\r\nside of the chain, might at this awful moment be looking peaceably at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish authorities, finding that to redeem my life I would not\r\ndeclare myself the owner of the vessel, had us conducted without farther\r\nmolestation to the fortress of Rosas. Having to file through nearly all\r\nthe inhabitants of the town, I had wished at first, through a false\r\nfeeling of shame, to leave in the mill the remains of our week's meals.\r\nBut M. Berthémie, more prudent than I, carried over his shoulder a great\r\nquantity of pieces of black bread, tied up with packthread. I imitated\r\nhim. I furnished myself famously from our old stock, set it on my\r\nshoulder, and it was with this accoutrement that I made my entrance into\r\nthe famous fortress.\r\n\r\nThey placed us in a casemate, where we had barely the space necessary\r\nfor lying down. In the windmill, they used to bring us, from time to\r\ntime, some provisions, which came from our boat. Here, the Spanish\r\ngovernment purveyed our food. We received every day some bread and a\r\nration of rice; but as we had no means of dressing food, we were in\r\nreality reduced to dry bread.\r\n\r\nDry bread was very unsubstantial food for one who could see from his\r\ncasemate, at the door of his prison, a sutler selling grapes at two\r\nfarthings a pound, and cooking, under the shelter of half a cask, bacon\r\nand herrings; but we had no money to bring us into connection with this\r\nmerchant. I then decided, though with very great regret, to sell a watch\r\nwhich my father had given me. I was only offered about a quarter of its\r\nvalue; but I might well accept it, since there were no competitors for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs possessors of sixty francs, M. Berthémie and I could now appease the\r\nhunger from which we had long suffered; but we did not like this return\r\nof fortune to be profitable to ourselves alone, and we made some\r\npresents, which were very well received by our companions in captivity.\r\nThough this sale of my watch brought some comfort to us, it was doomed\r\nat a later period to plunge a family into sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe town of Rosas fell into the power of the French after a courageous\r\nresistance. The prisoners of the garrison were sent to France, and\r\nnaturally passed through Perpignan. My father went in quest of news\r\nwherever Spaniards were to be found. He entered a café at the moment\r\nwhen a prisoner officer drew from his fob the watch which I had sold at\r\nRosas. My good father saw in this act the proof of my death, and fell\r\ninto a swoon. The officer had got the watch from a third party, and\r\ncould give no account of the fate of the person to whom it had\r\noriginally belonged.\r\n\r\nThe casemate having become necessary to the defenders of the fortress,\r\nwe were taken to a little chapel, where they deposited for twenty-four\r\nhours those who had died in the hospital. There we were guarded by\r\npeasants who had come across the mountain, from various villages, and\r\nparticularly from Cadaquès. These peasants, eager to recount all that\r\nthey had seen of interest during their one day's campaign, questioned me\r\nas to the deeds and behaviour of all my companions in misfortune. I\r\nsatisfied their curiosity amply, being the only one of the set who could\r\nspeak Spanish.\r\n\r\nTo enlist their good will, I also questioned them at length upon the\r\nsubject of their village, on the work that they did there, on smuggling,\r\ntheir principal sources of employment, &c. &c. They answered my\r\nquestions with the loquacity common to country rustics. The next day our\r\nguards were replaced by some others who were inhabitants of the same\r\nvillage. \"In my business of a roving merchant,\" I said to these last, \"I\r\nhave been at Cadaquès;\" and then I began to talk to them of what I had\r\nlearnt the night before, of such an individual, who gave himself up to\r\nsmuggling with more success than others, of his beautiful residence, of\r\nthe property which he possessed near the village,--in short, of a number\r\nof particulars which it seemed impossible for any but an inhabitant of\r\nCadaquès to know. My jest produced an unexpected effect. Such\r\ncircumstantial details, our guards said to themselves, cannot be known\r\nby a roving merchant; this personage, whom we have found here in such\r\nsingular society, is certainly a native of Cadaquès; and the son of the\r\napothecary must be about his age. He had gone to try his fortune in\r\nAmerica; it is evidently he who fears to make himself known, having been\r\nfound with all his riches in a vessel on its way to France. The report\r\nspread, became more consistent, and reached the ears of a sister of the\r\napothecary established at Rosas. She runs to me, believes she recognizes\r\nme, and falls on my neck. I protest against the identity. \"Well played!\"\r\nsaid she to me; \"the case is serious, as you have been found in a vessel\r\ncoming to France; persist in your denial; circumstances may perhaps take\r\na more favourable turn, and I shall profit by them to insure your\r\ndeliverance. In the mean time, my dear nephew, I will let you want for\r\nnothing.\" And truly every morning M. Berthémie and I received a\r\ncomfortable repast.\r\n\r\nThe church having become necessary to the garrison to serve as a\r\nmagazine, we were moved on the 25th of September, 1808, to a Trinity\r\nfort, called the _Bouton de Rosas_, a citadel situated on a little\r\nmountain at the entrance of the roads, and we were deposited deep under\r\nground, where the light of day did not penetrate on any side. We did not\r\nlong remain in this infected place, not because they had pity upon us,\r\nbut because it offered shelter for a part of the garrison attacked by\r\nthe French. They made us descend by night to the edge of the sea, and\r\nthen transported us on the 17th of October to the port of Palamos. We\r\nwere shut up in a hulk; we enjoyed, however, a certain degree of\r\nliberty;--they allowed us to go on land, and to parade our miseries and\r\nour rags in the town. It was there that I made the acquaintance of the\r\ndowager Duchess of Orleans, mother of Louis Philippe. She had left the\r\ntown of Figueras, where she resided, because, she told me, thirty-two\r\nbombs sent from the fortress had fallen in her house. She was then\r\nintending to take refuge in Algiers, and she asked me to bring the\r\ncaptain of the vessel to her, of whom, perhaps, she would have to\r\nimplore protection. I related to my \"_raïs_\" the misfortunes of the\r\nPrincess; he was moved by them, and I conducted him to her. On entering,\r\nhe took off his slippers from respect, as if he had entered within a\r\nmosque, and holding them in his hand, he went to kiss the front of the\r\ndress of Madame d'Orleans. The Princess Was alarmed at the sight of this\r\nmanly figure, wearing the longest beard I ever saw; she quickly\r\nrecovered herself, and the interview proceeded with a mixture of French\r\npoliteness and Oriental courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe sixty francs from Rosas were expended. Madame D'Orleans would have\r\nliked much to assist us, but she was herself without money. All that she\r\ncould gratify us with was a piece of sugarbread. The evening of our\r\nvisit I was richer than the Princess. To avoid the fury of the people\r\nthe Spanish Government sent those French who had escaped the first\r\nmassacres back to France in slight boats. One of the _cartels_ came and\r\ncast anchor by the side of our hulk. One of the unhappy emigrants\r\noffered me a pinch of snuff. On opening the snuff-box I found there\r\n\"_una onza de oro_,\" (an ounce of gold,) the sole remains of his\r\nfortune. I returned the snuff-box to him, with warm thanks, after having\r\nshut up in it a paper containing these words:--\"My fellow-countryman who\r\ncarries this note has rendered me a great service;--treat him as one of\r\nyour children.\" My petition was naturally favourably received; it was by\r\nthis bit of paper, the size of the _onza de oro_, that my family learnt\r\nthat I was still in existence, and it enabled my mother--a model of\r\npiety--to cease saying masses for the repose of my soul.\r\n\r\nFive days afterwards, one of my hardy compatriots arrived at Palamos,\r\nafter having traversed the line of posts both French and Spanish,\r\ncarrying to a merchant who had friends at Perpignan the proposal to\r\nfurnish me with all I was in need of. The Spaniard showed a great\r\ninclination to agree to the proposal; but I did not profit by his good\r\nwill, because of the occurrence of events which I shall relate\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory at Paris is very near the barrier. In my youth, curious\r\nto study the manners of the people, I used to walk in sight of the\r\npublic-houses which the desire of escaping payment of the duty has\r\nmultiplied outside the walls of the capital; on these excursions I was\r\noften humiliated to see men disputing for a piece of bread, just as\r\nanimals might have done. My feelings on this subject have very much\r\naltered since I have been personally exposed to the tortures of hunger.\r\nI have discovered, in fact, that a man, whatever may have been his\r\norigin, his education, and his habits, is governed, under certain\r\ncircumstances, much more by his stomach than by his intelligence and his\r\nheart. Here is the fact which suggested these reflections to me.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the unhoped-for arrival of _una onza de oro_, M. Berthémie\r\nand I had procured an immense dish of potatoes. The ordnance officer of\r\nthe Emperor was already devouring it with his eyes, when a Moroccan, who\r\nwas making his ablutions near us with one of his companions,\r\naccidentally filled it with dirt. M. Berthémie could not control his\r\nanger; he darted upon the clumsy Mussulman, and inflicted upon him a\r\nrough punishment.\r\n\r\nI remained a passive spectator of the combat, until the second Moroccan\r\ncame to the aid of his compatriot. The party no longer being equal, I\r\nalso took part in the conflict by seizing the new assailant by the\r\nbeard. The combat ceased at once, because the Moroccan would not raise\r\nhis hand against a man who could write a petition so rapidly. This\r\nconflict, like the struggles of which I had often been a witness outside\r\nthe barriers of Paris, had originated in a dish of potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards always cherished the idea that the ship and her cargo\r\nmight be confiscated; a commission came from Girone to question us. It\r\nwas composed of two civil judges and one inquisitor. I acted as\r\ninterpreter. When M. Berthémie's turn came, I went to fetch him, and\r\nsaid to him, \"Pretend that you can only talk Styrian, and be at ease; I\r\nwill not compromise you in translating your answers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was done as we had agreed; unfortunately the language spoken by M.\r\nBerthémie had but little variety, and the _sacrement der Teufel_, which\r\nhe had learnt in Germany, when he was aide-de-camp to Hautpoul,\r\npredominated too much in his discourse. Be that as it may, the judges\r\nobserved that there was too great a conformity between his answers and\r\nthose which I had made myself, to render it necessary to continue an\r\ninterrogatory, which I may say, by the way, disturbed me much. The wish\r\nto terminate it was still more decided on the part of the judges, when\r\nit came to the turn of a sailor named Mehemet. Instead of making him\r\nswear on the Koran to tell the truth, the judge was determined to make\r\nhim place his thumb on the forefinger so as represent the cross. I\r\nwarned him that great offence would thus be given; and, accordingly,\r\nwhen Mehemet became aware of the meaning of this sign, he began to spit\r\nupon it with inconceivable violence. The meeting ended at once.\r\n\r\nThe next day things had wholly changed their appearance; one of the\r\njudges from Girone came to declare to us that we were free to depart,\r\nand to go with our ship wherever we chose. What was the cause of this\r\nsudden change? It was this.\r\n\r\nDuring our quarantine in the windmill at Rosas, I had written, in the\r\nname of Captain Braham, a letter to the Dey of Algiers. I gave him an\r\naccount of the illegal arrest of his vessel, and of the death of one of\r\nthe lions which the Dey had sent to the Emperor. This last circumstance\r\ntransported the African monarch with rage. He sent immediately for the\r\nSpanish Consul, M. Onis, claimed pecuniary damages for his dear lion,\r\nand threatened war if his ship was not released directly. Spain had then\r\nto do with too many difficulties to undertake wantonly any new ones, and\r\nthe order to release the vessel so anxiously coveted arrived at Girone,\r\nand from thence at Palamos.\r\n\r\nThis solution, to which our Consul at Algiers, M. Dubois Thainville, had\r\nnot remained inattentive, reached us at the moment when we least\r\nexpected it. We at once made preparations for our departure, and on the\r\n28th of November, 1808, we set sail, steering for Marseilles; but, as\r\nthe Mussulmen on board the vessel declared, it was written above that we\r\nshould not enter that town. We could already perceive the white\r\nbuildings which crown the neighbouring hills of Marseilles, when a gust\r\nof the \"mistral,\" of great violence, sent us from the north towards the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nI do not know what route we followed, for I was lying in my cabin,\r\novercome with sea-sickness; I may therefore, though an astronomer, avow\r\nwithout shame, that at the moment when our unqualified pilots supposed\r\nthemselves to be off the Baléares, we landed, on the 5th of December,\r\nat Bougie.\r\n\r\nThere, they pretended that during the three months of winter, all\r\ncommunication with Algiers, by means of the little boats named\r\n_sandalis_, would be impossible, and I resigned myself to the painful\r\nprospect of so long a stay in a place at that time almost a desert. One\r\nevening I was making these sad reflections while pacing the deck of the\r\nvessel, when a shot from a gun on the coast came and struck the side\r\nplanks close to which I was passing. This suggested to me the thought of\r\ngoing to Algiers by land.\r\n\r\nI went next day, accompanied by M. Berthémie and Captain Spiro\r\nCalligero, to the Caïd of the town: \"I wish,\" said I to him, \"to go to\r\nAlgiers by land.\" The man, quite frightened, exclaimed, \"I cannot allow\r\nyou to do so; you would certainly be killed on the road; your Consul\r\nwould make a complaint to the Dey, and I should have my head cut off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not on that ground. I will give you an acquittance.\"\r\n\r\nIt was immediately drawn up in these terms: \"We, the undersigned,\r\ncertify that the Caïd of Bougie wished to dissuade us from going to\r\nAlgiers by land; that he has assured us that we shall be massacred on\r\nthe road; that notwithstanding his representations, reiterated twenty\r\ntimes, we have persisted in our project. We beg the Algerine\r\nauthorities, particularly our Consul, not to make him responsible for\r\nthis event if it should occur. We once more repeat, that the voyage has\r\nbeen undertaken against his will.\r\n\r\n     _Signed_: ARAGO and BERTHÉMIE.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given this declaration to the Caïd, we considered ourselves quit\r\nof this functionary; but he came up to me, undid, without saying a word,\r\nthe knot of my cravat, took it off, and put it into his pocket. All this\r\nwas done so quickly that I had not time, I will add that I had not even\r\nthe wish, to reclaim it.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this audience, which had terminated in so singular\r\na manner, we made a bargain with a Mahomedan priest, who promised to\r\nconduct us to Algiers for the sum of twenty \"piastres fortes,\" and a red\r\nmantle. The day was occupied in disguising ourselves well or ill, and we\r\nset out the next morning, accompanied by several Moorish sailors\r\nbelonging to the crew of the ship, after having shown the Mahomedan\r\npriest that we had nothing with us worth a sou, so that if we were\r\nkilled on the road he would inevitably lose all reward.\r\n\r\nI went, at the last moment, to make my bow to the only lion that was\r\nstill alive, and with whom I had lived in very good harmony; I wished\r\nalso to say good-bye to the monkeys, who during nearly five months had\r\nbeen equally my companions in misfortune.[4] These monkeys during our\r\nfrightful misery had rendered us a service which I scarcely dare\r\nmention, and which will scarcely be guessed by the inhabitants of our\r\ncities, who look upon these animals as objects of diversion; they freed\r\nus from the vermin which infested us, and showed particularly a\r\nremarkable cleverness in seeking out the hideous insects which lodged\r\nthemselves in our hair.\r\n\r\nPoor animals! they seemed to me very unfortunate in being shut up in\r\nthe narrow enclosure of the vessel, when, on the neighbouring coast,\r\nother monkeys, as if to bully them, came on to the branches of the\r\ntrees, giving innumerable proofs of their agility.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the day, we saw on the road two Kabyls, similar\r\nto the soldiers of Jugurtha, whose harsh appearance powerfully allayed\r\nour fancy for wandering. In the evening we witnessed a fearful tumult,\r\nwhich appeared to be directed against us. We learnt afterwards that the\r\nMahomedan priest had been the object of it; that it originated with some\r\nKabyls whom he had disarmed on one of their journeys to Bougie. This\r\nincident, which appeared likely to be repeated, inspired us for a moment\r\nwith the thought of returning; but the sailors were resolute, and we\r\ncontinued our hazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we advanced, our troops became increased by a certain\r\nnumber of Kabyls, who wished to go to Algiers to work there in the\r\nquality of seamen, and who dared not undertake alone this dangerous\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe third day we encamped in the open air, at the entrance of a forest.\r\nThe Arabs lighted a very large fire in the form of a circle, and placed\r\nthemselves in the middle. Towards eleven o'clock, I was awakened by the\r\nnoise which the mules made, all trying to break their fastenings. I\r\nasked what was the cause of this disturbance. They answered me that a\r\n\"_sebâá_\" had come roaming in the neighbourhood. I was not aware then\r\nthat a \"_sebâá_\" was a lion, and I went to sleep again. The next day, in\r\ntraversing the forest, the arrangement of the caravan was changed. It\r\nwas grouped in the smallest space possible; one Kabyl was at the head,\r\nhis gun ready for service; another was in the rear, in the same\r\nposition. I inquired of the owner of the mule the cause of these unusual\r\nprecautions. He answered me, that they were dreading an attack from a\r\n\"_sebâá_\" and that if this should occur, one of us would be carried off\r\nwithout having time to put himself on the defensive. \"I would rather be\r\na spectator,\" I said to him, \"than an actor in the scene you describe;\r\nconsequently, I will give you two piastres more if you will keep your\r\nmule always in the centre of the moving group.\" My proposal was\r\naccepted. It was then for the first time that I saw that my Arab carried\r\na yatagan under his tunic, which he used for pricking on the mule the\r\nwhole time that we were in the thicket. Superfluous cautions! The\r\n\"_sebâá_\" did not show himself.\r\n\r\nEach village being a little republic, whose territory we could not cross\r\nwithout obtaining permission and a passport from the Mahomedan priest\r\n_président_, the priest who conducted our caravan used to leave us in\r\nthe fields, and went sometimes a good way off to a village to solicit\r\nthe permission without which it would have been dangerous to continue\r\nour route. He remained entire hours without returning to us, and we then\r\nhad occasion to reflect sadly on the imprudence of our enterprise. We\r\ngenerally slept amongst habitations. Once, we found the streets of a\r\nvillage barricaded, because they were fearing an attack from a\r\nneighbouring village. The foremost man of our caravan removed the\r\nobstacles; but a woman came out of her house like a fury, and belaboured\r\nus with blows from a pole. We remarked that she was fair, of brilliant\r\nwhiteness, and very pretty.\r\n\r\nAnother time we lay down in a lurking-place dignified by the beautiful\r\nname of caravansary. In the morning, when the sun rose, cries of\r\n\"_Roumi! Roumi!_\" warned us that we had been discovered. The sailor,\r\nMehemet, he who figured in the scene of the oath at Palamos, entered in\r\na melancholy mood the enclosure where we were together, and made us\r\nunderstand that the cries of \"Roumi!\" vociferated under these\r\ncircumstances, were equivalent to a sentence of death. \"Wait,\" said he;\r\n\"a means of saving you has occurred to me.\" Mehemet entered some moments\r\nafterwards, told us that his means had succeeded, and invited me to join\r\nthe Kabyls, who were going to say prayers.\r\n\r\nI accordingly went out, and prostrated myself towards the East. I\r\nimitated minutely the gestures which I saw made around me, pronouncing\r\nthe sacred words,--_La elah il Allah! oua Mahommed raçoul Allah!_ It was\r\nthe scene of Mamamouchi of the \"Bourgeois Gentilhomme,\" which I had so\r\noften seen acted by Dugazon,--with this one difference, that this time\r\nit did not make me laugh. I was, however, ignorant of the consequences\r\nit might have brought upon me on my arrival at Algiers. After having\r\nmade the profession of faith before Mahomedans--_There is but one God,\r\nand Mahomet is his prophet_, if I had been informed against to the\r\nmufti, I must inevitably have become Mussulman, and they would not have\r\nallowed me to go out of the Regency.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to relate by what means Mehemet had saved us from\r\ninevitable death. \"You have guessed rightly,\" said he to the Kabyls;\r\n\"there are two Christians in the caravansary, but they are Mahomedans at\r\nheart, and are going to Algiers to be adopted by the mufti into our holy\r\nreligion. You will not doubt this when I tell you that I was myself a\r\nslave to some Christians, and that they redeemed me with their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"In cha Allah!\" they exclaimed with one voice. And it was then that the\r\nscene took place which I have just described.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in sight of Algiers the 25th December, 1808. We took leave of\r\nthe Arab owners of our mules, who walked on foot by the side of us, and\r\nwe spurred them on, in order to reach the town before the closing of the\r\ngates. On our arrival, we learnt that the Dey, to whom we owed our first\r\ndeliverance, had been beheaded. The guard of the palace before which we\r\npassed, stopped us and questioned us as to whence we came. We replied\r\nthat we came from Bougie by land. \"It is not possible!\" exclaimed all\r\nthe janissaries at once; \"the Dey himself would not venture to undertake\r\nsuch a journey!\" \"We acknowledge that we have committed a great\r\nimprudence; that we would not undertake to recommence the journey for\r\nmillions; but the fact that we have just declared is the strict truth.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the consular house, we were, as on the first occasion, very\r\ncordially welcomed. We received a visit from a dragoman sent by the Dey,\r\nwho asked whether we persisted in maintaining that Bougie had been our\r\npoint of departure, and not Cape Matifou, or some neighbouring port. We\r\nagain affirmed the truth of our recital; it was confirmed, the next day,\r\non the arrival of the proprietors of our mules.\r\n\r\nAt Palamos, during the various interviews which I had with the dowager\r\nDuchess of Orleans, one circumstance had particularly affected me. The\r\nPrincess spoke to me unceasingly of the wish she had to go and rejoin\r\none of her sons, whom she believed to be alive, but of whose death I had\r\nbeen informed by a person belonging to her household. Hence I was\r\nanxious to do all that lay in my power to mitigate a sorrow which she\r\nmust experience before long.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I quitted Spain for Marseilles, the Duchess confided\r\nto me two letters which I was to forward in safety to their addresses.\r\nOne was destined for the Empress-mother of Russia, the other for the\r\nEmpress of Austria.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I arrived at Algiers, when I mentioned these two letters to\r\nM. Dubois Thainville, and begged him to send them to France by the first\r\nopportunity. \"I shall do nothing of the sort,\" he at once answered me.\r\n\"Do you know that you have behaved in this affair like a young\r\ninexperienced man, or, to speak out, like a blunderer? I am surprised\r\nthat you did not comprehend that the Emperor, with his pettish spirit,\r\nmight take this much amiss, and consider you, according to the contents\r\nof the two letters, as the promoter of an intrigue in favour of the\r\nexiled family of the Bourbons.\" Thus the paternal advice of the French\r\nConsul taught me that in all that regards politics, however nearly or\r\nremotely, one cannot give himself up without danger to the dictates of\r\nthe heart and the reason.\r\n\r\nI enclosed my two letters in an envelope bearing the address of a\r\ntrustworthy person, and gave them into the hands of a corsair, who,\r\nafter touching at Algiers, would proceed to France. I have never known\r\nwhether they reached their destination.\r\n\r\nThe reigning Dey, successor to the beheaded Dey, had formerly filled the\r\nhumble office of \"_épileur_\"[5] of dead bodies in the mosques. He\r\ngoverned the Regency with much gentleness, occupying himself with\r\nlittle but his harem. This disgusted those who had raised him to this\r\neminent post, and they resolved upon getting rid of him. We became aware\r\nof the danger which menaced him, by seeing the courts and vestibules of\r\nthe consular house full, according to the custom under such\r\ncircumstances, of Jews, carrying with them whatever they had of most\r\nvalue. It was a rule at Algiers, that all that happened in the interval\r\ncomprised between the death of a Dey and the installation of his\r\nsuccessor, could not be followed up by justice, and must remain\r\nunpunished. One can imagine, then, why the children of Moses should seek\r\nsafety in the consular houses, the European inhabitants of which had the\r\ncourage to arm themselves for self-defence as soon as the danger was\r\napparent, and who, moreover, had a janissary to guard them.\r\n\r\nWhilst the unfortunate Dey \"épileur\" was being conducted towards the\r\nplace where he was to be strangled, he heard the cannon which announced\r\nhis death and the installation of his successor. \"They are in great\r\nhaste,\" said he; \"what will you gain by carrying matters to extremities?\r\nSend me to the Levant; I promise you never to return. What have you to\r\nreproach me with?\" \"With nothing,\" answered his escort, \"but your\r\ninsignificance. However, a man cannot live as a mere private man, after\r\nhaving been Dey of Algiers.\" And the unfortunate man perished by the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nThe communication by sea between Bougie and Algiers was not so\r\ndifficult, even with the \"_sandalas_,\" as the Caïd of the former town\r\nwished to assure me. Captain Spiro had the cases landed, which belonged\r\nto me. The Caïd sought to discover what they contained; and, having\r\nperceived through a chink something yellowish, he hastened to send the\r\nnews to the Dey, that the Frenchmen who had come to Algiers by land had\r\namong their baggage cases filled with zechins, destined to revolutionize\r\nthe Kabylie. They immediately had these cases forwarded to Algiers, and\r\nat their opening, before the Minister of Naval Affairs, all the\r\nphantasmagoria of zechins, of treasure, of revolution, disappeared at\r\nthe sight of the stands and the limbs of several repeating circles in\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nWe are now going to sojourn several months in Algiers. I will take\r\nadvantage of this to put together some details of manners which may be\r\ninteresting as the picture of a state of things anterior to that of the\r\noccupation of the Regency by the French. This occupation, it must be\r\nremarked, has already fundamentally altered the manners and the habits\r\nof the Algerine population.\r\n\r\nI am about to report a curious fact, and one which shows that politics,\r\nwhich insinuate themselves and bring discord into the bosom of the most\r\nunited families, had succeeded, strange to say, in penetrating as far as\r\nthe galley-slaves' prison at Algiers. The slaves belonged to three\r\nnations: there were in 1809 in this prison, Portuguese, Neapolitans, and\r\nSicilians; among these two latter classes were counted partisans of\r\nMurat and those of Ferdinand of Naples. One day, at the beginning of the\r\nyear, a dragoman came in the name of the Dey to beg M. Dubois Thainville\r\nto go without delay to the prison, where the friends of the French and\r\ntheir adversaries had involved themselves in a furious combat; and\r\nalready several had fallen. The weapon with which they struck each other\r\nwas the heavy long chain attached to their legs.\r\n\r\nEach Consul, as I said above, had a janissary placed with him as his\r\nguard; the one belonging to the French Consul was a Candiote; he had\r\nbeen surnamed _the Terror_. Whenever some news unfavourable to France\r\nwas announced in the cafés, he came to the Consulate to inform himself\r\nas to the reality of the fact; and when we told him that the other\r\njanissaries had propagated false news, he returned to them, and there,\r\nyatagan in hand, he declared himself ready to enter the lists in combat\r\nagainst those who should still maintain the truth of the news. As these\r\ncontinual threats might endanger him, (for they had no support beyond\r\nhis mere animal courage,) we had wished to render him expert in the\r\nhandling of arms by giving him some lessons in fencing; but he could not\r\nendure the idea that Christians should touch him at every turn with\r\nfoils; he therefore proposed to substitute for the simulated duel a real\r\ncombat with the yatagan.\r\n\r\nOne may gain an exact idea of this savage nature when I mention that,\r\nhaving one day heard a pistol-shot, the sound of which proceeded from\r\nhis room, people ran, and found him bathed in his blood; he had just\r\nshot off a ball into his arm to cure himself of a rheumatic pain.\r\n\r\nSeeing with what facility the Deys disappeared, I said one day to our\r\njanissary, \"With this prospect before your eyes, would you consent to\r\nbecome Dey?\" \"Yes, doubtless,\" answered he. \"You seem to count as\r\nnothing the pleasure of doing all that one likes, if only even for a\r\nsingle day!\"\r\n\r\nWhen we wished to take a turn in the town of Algiers, we generally took\r\ncare to be escorted by the janissary attached to the consular house; it\r\nwas the only means of escaping insults, affronts, and even acts of\r\nviolence. I have just said it was the only means. I made a mistake;\r\nthere was one other; that was, to go in the company of a French\r\n\"lazarist\" of seventy years of age, and whose name, if my memory serves\r\nme, was Father Joshua; he had lived in this country for half a century.\r\nThis man, of exemplary virtue, had devoted himself with admirable\r\nself-denial to the service of the slaves of the Regency, and had\r\ndivested himself of all considerations of nationality;--the Portuguese,\r\nNeapolitans, Sicilians, all were equally his brethren.\r\n\r\nIn the times of plague he was seen day and night carrying eager help to\r\nthe Mussulmans; thus, his virtue had conquered even religious hatreds;\r\nand wherever he passed, he and the persons who might accompany him\r\nreceived from multitudes of the people, from the janissaries, and even\r\nfrom the officials of the mosques, the most respectful salutations.\r\n\r\nDuring our long hours of sailing on board the Algerine vessel, and our\r\ncompulsory stay in the prisons at Rosas, and on the hulk at Palamos, I\r\ngathered some ideas as to the interior life of the Moors or the\r\nCoulouglous, which, even now when Algiers has fallen under the dominion\r\nof France, would perhaps be yet worth preserving. I shall, however,\r\nconfine myself to recounting, nearly word for word, a conversation which\r\nI had with Raïs Braham, whose father was a \"_Turc fin_,\" that is to say,\r\na Turk born in the Levant.\r\n\r\n\"How is it that you consent,\" said I to him, \"to marry a young girl whom\r\nyou have never seen, and find in her, perhaps, an excessively ugly\r\nwoman, instead of the beauty whom you had fancied to yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"We never marry without having obtained information from the women who\r\nserve in the capacity of servants at the public baths. The Jewesses are\r\nmoreover, in these cases, very useful go-betweens.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many legitimate wives have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have four, that is to say, the number authorized by the Koran.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they live together on a good understanding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir, my house is a hell. I never enter it without finding them at\r\nthe step of the door, or at the bottom of the stairs; then, each wants\r\nto be the first to make me listen to the complaints which she has to\r\nbring against her companions. I am about to utter blasphemy, but I think\r\nthat our holy religion ought to prohibit a plurality of wives to those\r\nwho are not rich enough to give to each a separate habitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But since the Koran allows you to repudiate even legitimate wives, why\r\ndo you not send back three of them to their parents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? because that would ruin me. On the day of the marriage the father\r\nof the young woman to be married stipulates for a dowry, and the half of\r\nit is paid. The other half may be exacted the day that the woman is\r\nrepudiated. It would then be three half dowries that I should have to\r\npay if I sent back three of my wives. I ought, however, to rectify one\r\ninaccuracy in what I said just now, that my four wives had never agreed\r\ntogether. Once, they were agreed among themselves in the feeling of a\r\ncommon hatred. In going through the market I had bought a young negress.\r\nIn the evening, when I retired to rest, I perceived that my wives had\r\nprepared no bed for her, and that the unfortunate girl was extended on\r\nthe ground. I rolled up my trowsers and laid them under her head as a\r\nkind of pillow. In the morning the distracting cries of the poor slave\r\nmade me run to her, and I found her nearly sinking under the blows of my\r\nfour wives; for once they understood each other marvellously well.\"\r\n\r\nIn February, 1809, the new Dey, the successor of the \"épileur,\" a short\r\ntime after having entered on his functions, claimed from two to three\r\nhundred thousand francs,--I do not remember exactly the sum,--which he\r\npretended was due to him from the French Government. M. Dubois\r\nThainville answered that he had received the Emperor's orders not to pay\r\none centime.\r\n\r\nThe Dey was furious, and decided upon declaring war against us. A\r\ndeclaration of war at Algiers used to be immediately followed by putting\r\nall the persons of other nations into prison. This time matters were not\r\npushed to this extreme limit. Our names might be figuring on the list of\r\nthe slaves of the Regency; but in fact, so far as I was concerned, I\r\nremained free in the consular house. By means of a pecuniary guarantee,\r\ncontracted with the Swedish Consul, M. Norderling, I was even permitted\r\nto live at his country house, situated near the Emperor's fort.\r\n\r\nThe most insignificant event was sufficient to modify the ideas of these\r\nbarbarians. I had come into the town one day, and was seated at table at\r\nM. Dubois Thainville's, when the English Consul, Mr. Blankley, arrived\r\nin great haste, announcing to our Consul the entrance into the port of a\r\nFrench prize. \"I never will uselessly add,\" said he, generously, \"to the\r\nseverities of war; I came to announce to you, my colleague, that I will\r\ngive up your prisoners on a receipt which will insure me the deliverance\r\nof an equal number of Englishmen detained in France.\" \"I thank you,\"\r\nanswered M. Dubois Thainville; \"but I do not the less deplore this event\r\nthat it will retard, indefinitely, perhaps, the settlement of the\r\naccount in which I am engaged with the Dey.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, armed with a telescope, I was looking through\r\nthe window of the dining-room, trying to persuade myself at least that\r\nthe captured vessel was not one of much importance. But one must yield\r\nto evidence. It was pierced for a great number of guns. All at once, the\r\nwind having displayed the flags, I perceived with surprise the French\r\nflag over the English flag. I communicated what I observed to Mr.\r\nBlankley. He answered immediately, \"You do not surely pretend to observe\r\nbetter with your bad telescope than I did with my _Dollond_?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you cannot pretend,\" said I to him in _my_ turn, \"to see better\r\nthan an astronomer by profession? I am sure of my fact. I beg M.\r\nThainville's permission, and will go this instant to visit this\r\nmysterious prize.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, I went there; and this is what I learnt:--\r\n\r\nGeneral Duhesme, Governor of Barcelona, wishing to rid himself of the\r\nmost ill-disciplined portion of his garrison, formed the principal part\r\ninto the crew of a vessel, the command of which he gave to a lieutenant\r\nof Babastre, a celebrated corsair of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThere were amongst these improvised seamen a hussar, a dragoon, two\r\nveterans, a miner with his long beard, &c. &c. The vessel, leaving\r\nBarcelona by night, escaped the English cruiser, and got to the entrance\r\nof Port Mahon. An English \"lettre de marque\" was coming out of the port.\r\nThe crew of the French vessel boarded her; and a furious combat on the\r\ndeck ensued, in which the French got the upper hand. It was this \"lettre\r\nde marque\" which had now arrived at Algiers.\r\n\r\nInvested with full power by M. Dubois Thainville, I announced to the\r\nprisoners that they were about to be immediately given up to their\r\nConsul. I respected even the trick of the captain, who, wounded by\r\nseveral sabre-cuts, had contrived to cover up his head with his\r\nprincipal flag. I re-assured his wife; but my chief care was especially\r\ndevoted to a passenger whom I saw with one arm amputated.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the surgeon,\" I said to him, \"who operated on you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not our surgeon,\" he answered. \"He basely fled with a part of\r\nthe crew, and saved himself on land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, then, cut off your arm?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the hussar whom you see here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy man!\" I exclaimed; \"what could lead you, when it was not your\r\nprofession, to perform this operation?\"\r\n\r\n\"The pressing request of the wounded man. His arm had already swollen to\r\nan enormous size. He wanted some one to cut it off for him with a blow\r\nof a hatchet. I told him that in Egypt, when I was in hospital, I had\r\nseen several amputations made; that I would imitate what I had seen, and\r\nmight perhaps succeed. That at any rate it would be better than the blow\r\nof a hatchet. All was agreed; I armed myself with the carpenter's saw;\r\nand the operation was done.\"\r\n\r\nI went off immediately to the American consul, to claim the assistance\r\nof the only surgeon worthy of confidence who was then in Algiers. M.\r\nTriplet--I think I recollect that that was the name of the man of the\r\ndistinguished art whose aid I invoked--came at once on board the vessel,\r\nexamined the dressing of the wound, and declared, to my very lively\r\nsatisfaction, that all was going on well, and that the Englishman would\r\nsurvive his horrible injury.\r\n\r\nThe same day we had the wounded men carried on litters to Mr. Blankley's\r\nhouse; this operation, executed with somewhat of ceremony, modified,\r\nthough slightly, the feelings of the Dey in our favour, and his\r\nsentiments became yet more favourable towards us in consequence of\r\nanother maritime occurrence, although a very insignificant one.\r\n\r\nOne day a corvette was seen in the horizon armed with a very great\r\nnumber of guns, and shaping her way towards the port of Algiers; there\r\nappeared immediately after an English brig of war, in full sail; a\r\ncombat was therefore expected, and all the terraces of the town were\r\ncovered with spectators; the brig appeared to be the best sailer, and\r\nseemed to us likely to reach the corvette, but the latter tacked about,\r\nand seemed desirous to engage in battle; the English vessel fled before\r\nher; the corvette tacked about a second time, and again directed her\r\ncourse towards Algiers, where, one would have supposed, she had some\r\nspecial mission to execute. The brig, in her turn now changed her\r\ncourse, but held herself constantly beyond the reach of shot from the\r\ncorvette; at last the two vessels arrived in succession in the port, and\r\ncast anchor, to the lively disappointment of the Algerine population,\r\nwho had hoped to be present without danger at a maritime combat between\r\nthe \"Christian dogs,\" belonging to two nations equally detested in a\r\nreligious point of view; but shouts of laughter could not be repressed\r\nwhen it was seen that the corvette was a merchant vessel, and that she\r\nwas only armed with wooden imitations of cannon. It was said in the town\r\nthat the English sailors were furious, and had been on the point of\r\nmutiny against their too prudent captain.\r\n\r\nI have very little to tell in favour of the Algerines; hence I must do\r\nan act of justice by mentioning, that the corvette departed the next day\r\nfor the Antilles, her destination, and that the brig was not permitted\r\nto set sail until the next day but one.\r\n\r\nBakri often came to the French Consulate to talk of our affairs with M.\r\nDubois Thainville: \"What can you want?\" said the latter, \"you are an\r\nAlgerine; you will be the first victim of the Dey's obstinacy. I have\r\nalready written to Livorno that your families and your goods are to be\r\nseized. When the vessels laden with cotton, which you have in this port,\r\narrive at Marseilles, they will be immediately confiscated; it is for\r\nyou to judge whether it would not better suit you to pay the sum which\r\nthe Dey claims, than to expose yourself to tenfold and certain loss.\"\r\n\r\nSuch reasoning was unanswerable; and whatever it might cost him, Bakri\r\ndecided on paying the sum that was demanded of France.\r\n\r\nPermission to depart was immediately granted to us; I embarked the 21st\r\nof June, 1809, on board a vessel in which M. Dubois Thainville and his\r\nfamily were passengers.\r\n\r\nThe evening before our departure from Algiers, a corsair deposited at\r\nthe consul's the Majorcan mail, which he had taken from a vessel which\r\nhe had captured. It was a complete collection of the letters which the\r\ninhabitants of the Baléares had been writing to their friends on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said M. Dubois Thainville to me, \"here is something to\r\namuse you during the voyage,--you who generally keep your room from\r\nsea-sickness,--break the seals and read all these letters, and see\r\nwhether they contain any accounts by which we might profit how to aid\r\nthe unhappy soldiers who are dying of misery and despair in the little\r\nisland of Cabrera.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had we arrived on board the vessel, when I set myself to the\r\nwork, and acted without scruple or remorse the part of an official of\r\nthe black chamber, with this sole difference, that the letters were\r\nunsealed without taking any precautions. I found amongst them several\r\ndispatches, in which Admiral Collingwood signified to the Spanish\r\nGovernment the ease with which the prisoners might be delivered.\r\nImmediately on our arrival at Marseilles these letters were sent to the\r\nminister of naval affairs, who, I believe, did not pay much attention to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI knew almost every one at Palma, the capital of Majorca. I leave it to\r\nbe imagined with what curiosity I read the missives in which the\r\nbeautiful ladies of the town expressed their hatred against _los\r\nmalditos cavachios_, (French,) whose presence in Spain had rendered\r\nnecessary the departure for the Continent of a magnificent regiment of\r\nhussars; how many persons might I not have embroiled, if under a mask I\r\nhad found myself with them at the opera ball!\r\n\r\nMany of the letters made mention of me, and were particularly\r\ninteresting to me; I was sure in this instance there was nothing to\r\nconstrain the frankness of those who had written them. It is an\r\nadvantage which few people can boast having enjoyed to the same degree.\r\n\r\nThe vessel in which I was, although laden with bales of cotton, had some\r\ncorsair papers of the Regency, and was the reputed escort of three\r\nrichly laden merchant vessels which were going to France.\r\n\r\nWe were off Marseilles on the 1st of July, when an English frigate came\r\nto stop our passage: \"I will not take you,\" said the English captain;\r\n\"but you will go towards the Hyères Islands, and Admiral Collingwood\r\nwill decide on your fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have received,\" answered the Barbary captain, \"an express commission\r\nto conduct these vessels to Marseilles, and I will execute it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, individually, can do what may seem to you best,\" answered the\r\nEnglishman; \"as to the merchant vessels under your escort, they will be,\r\nI repeat to you, taken to Admiral Collingwood.\" And he immediately gave\r\norders to those vessels to set sail to the East.\r\n\r\nThe frigate had already gone a little distance when she perceived that\r\nwe were steering towards Marseilles. Having then learnt from the crews\r\nof the merchant vessels that we were ourselves laden with cotton, she\r\ntacked about to seize us.\r\n\r\nShe was very near reaching us, when we were enabled to enter the port of\r\nthe little island of Pomègue. In the night she put her boats to sea to\r\ntry to carry us off; but the enterprise was too perilous, and she did\r\nnot dare attempt it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, 2d of July, 1809, I disembarked at the lazaretto.\r\n\r\nAt the present day they go from Algiers to Marseilles in four days; it\r\nhad taken me eleven months to make the same voyage. It is true that here\r\nand there I had made involuntary sojourns.\r\n\r\nMy letters sent from the lazaretto at Marseilles were considered by my\r\nrelatives and friends as certificates of resurrection, they having for a\r\nlong time past supposed me dead. A great geometer had even proposed to\r\nthe Bureau of Longitude no longer to pay my allowance to my authorized\r\nrepresentative; which appears the more cruel inasmuch as this\r\nrepresentative was my father.\r\n\r\nThe first letter which I received from Paris was full of sympathy and\r\ncongratulations on the termination of my laborious and perilous\r\nadventures; it was from a man already in possession of an European\r\nreputation, but whom I had never seen: M. de Humboldt, after what he had\r\nheard of my misfortunes, offered me his friendship. Such was the first\r\norigin of a connection which dates from nearly forty-two years back,\r\nwithout a single cloud ever paving troubled it.\r\n\r\nM. Dubois Thainville had numerous acquaintances in Marseilles; his wife\r\nwas a native of that town, and her family resided there. They received,\r\ntherefore, both of them, numerous visits in the parlour of the\r\nlazaretto. The bell which summoned them, for me alone was dumb; and I\r\nremained as solitary and forsaken, at the gates of a town peopled with a\r\nhundred thousand of my countrymen, as if I had been in the heart of\r\nAfrica. One day, however, the parlour-bell rang three times (the number\r\nof times corresponding to the number of my room); I thought it must be a\r\nmistake. I did not, however, allow this to appear. I traversed proudly\r\nunder the escort of my guard of health the long space which separates\r\nthe lazaretto, properly so called, from the parlour; and there I found,\r\nwith very lively satisfaction, M. Pons, the director of the Observatory\r\nat Marseilles, and the most celebrated discoverer of comets of whom the\r\nannals of Astronomy have ever had to register the success.\r\n\r\nAt any time a visit from the excellent M. Pons, whom I have since seen\r\ndirector of the Observatory at Florence, would have been very agreeable\r\nto me; but, during my quarantine, I felt it unappreciably valuable. It\r\nproved to me that I had returned to my native soil.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days before our admission to freedom, we experienced a loss\r\nwhich was deeply felt by each of us. To pass away the heavy time of a\r\nsevere quarantine, the little Algerine colony was in the habit of going\r\nto an enclosure near the lazaretto, where a very beautiful gazelle,\r\nbelonging to M. Dubois Thainville, was confined; she bounded about there\r\nin full liberty with a grace which excited our admiration. One of us\r\nendeavoured to stop this elegant animal in her course; he seized her\r\nunluckily by the leg, and broke it. We all ran, but only, alas! to\r\nwitness a scene which excited the deepest emotion in us.\r\n\r\nThe gazelle, lying on her side, raised her head sadly; her beautiful\r\neyes (the eyes of a gazelle!) shed torrents of tears; no cry of\r\ncomplaint escaped her mouth; she produced that effect upon us which is\r\nalways felt when a person who is suddenly struck by an irreparable\r\nmisfortune, resigns himself to it, and shows his profound anguish only\r\nby silent tears.\r\n\r\nHaving ended my quarantine, I went at once to Perpignan, to the bosom of\r\nmy family, where my mother, the most excellent and pious of women,\r\ncaused numerous masses to be said to celebrate my return, as she had\r\ndone before to pray for the repose of my soul, when she thought that I\r\nhad fallen under the daggers of the Spaniards. But I soon quitted my\r\nnative town to return to Paris; and I deposited at the Bureau of\r\nLongitude and the Academy of Sciences my observations, which I had\r\nsucceeded in preserving amidst the perils and tribulations of my long\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nA few days after my arrival, on the 18th of September, 1809, I was\r\nnominated an academician in the place of Lalande. There were fifty-two\r\nvoters; I obtained forty-seven voices, M. Poisson four, and M. Nouet\r\none. I was then twenty-three years of age.\r\n\r\nA nomination made with such a majority would appear, at first sight, as\r\nif it could give rise to no serious difficulties; but it proved\r\notherwise. The intervention of M. de Laplace, before the day of ballot,\r\nwas active and incessant to have my admission postponed until the time\r\nwhen a vacancy, occurring in the geometry section, might enable the\r\nlearned assembly to nominate M. Poisson at the same time as me. The\r\nauthor of the _Mécanique Céleste_ had vowed to the young geometer an\r\nunbounded attachment, completely justified, certainly, by the beautiful\r\nresearches which science already owed to him. M. de Laplace could not\r\nsupport the idea that a young astronomer, younger by five years than M.\r\nPoisson, a pupil, in the presence of his professor at the Polytechnic\r\nSchool, should become an academician before him. He proposed to me,\r\ntherefore, to write to the Academy that I would not stand for election\r\nuntil there should be a second place to give to Poisson. I answered by a\r\nformal refusal, and giving my reasons in these terms: \"I care little to\r\nbe nominated at this moment. I have decided upon leaving shortly with M.\r\nde Humboldt for Thibet. In those savage regions the title of member of\r\nthe Institute will not smooth the difficulties which we shall have to\r\nencounter. But I would not be guilty of any rudeness towards the\r\nAcademy. If they were to receive the declaration for which I am asked,\r\nwould not the savans who compose this illustrious body have a right to\r\nsay to me: 'How are you certain that we have thought of you? You refuse\r\nwhat has not yet been offered to you.'\"\r\n\r\nOn seeing my firm resolution not to lend myself to the inconsiderate\r\ncourse which he had advised me to follow, M. de Laplace went to work in\r\nanother way; he maintained that I had not sufficient distinction for\r\nadmission into the Academy. I do not pretend that, at the age of\r\nthree-and-twenty, my scientific attainments were very considerable, if\r\nestimated in an _absolute_ manner; but when I judged by _comparison_, I\r\nregained courage, especially on considering that the three last years of\r\nmy life had been consecrated to the measurement of an arc of the\r\nmeridian in a foreign country; that they were passed amid the storms of\r\nthe war with Spain; often enough in dungeons, or, what was yet worse, in\r\nthe mountains of Kabylia, and at Algiers, at that time a very dangerous\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nHere is, therefore, my statement of accounts for that epoch. I make it\r\nover to the impartial appreciation of the reader.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Polytechnic School, I had made, in conjunction with M.\r\nBiot, an extensive and very minute research on the determination of the\r\ncoefficient of the tables of atmospheric refraction.\r\n\r\nWe had also measured the refraction of different gases, which, up to\r\nthat time, had not been attempted.\r\n\r\nA determination, more exact than had been previously obtained, of the\r\nrelation of the weight of air to the weight of mercury, had furnished a\r\ndirect value of the coefficient of the barometrical formula which served\r\nfor the calculation of the heights.\r\n\r\nI had contributed, in a regular and very assiduous manner, during nearly\r\ntwo years, to the observations which were made day and night with the\r\ntransit telescope and with the mural quadrant at the Paris Observatory.\r\n\r\nI had undertaken, in conjunction with M. Bouvard, the observations\r\nrelating to the verification of the laws of the moon's libration. All\r\nthe calculations were prepared; it only remained for me to put the\r\nnumbers into the formulæ, when I was, by order of the Bureau of\r\nLongitude, obliged to leave Paris for Spain. I had observed various\r\ncomets, and calculated their orbits. I had, in concert with M. Bouvard,\r\ncalculated, according to Laplace's formula, the table of refraction\r\nwhich has been published in the _Recueil des Tables_ of the Bureau of\r\nLongitude, and in the _Connaissance des Temps_. A research on the\r\nvelocity of light, made with a prism placed before the object end of the\r\ntelescope of the mural circle, had proved that the same tables of\r\nrefraction might serve for the sun and all the stars.\r\n\r\nFinally, I had just terminated, under very difficult circumstances, the\r\ngrandest triangulation which had ever been achieved, to prolong the\r\nmeridian line from France as far as the island of Formentera.\r\n\r\nM. de Laplace, without denying the importance and utility of these\r\nlabours and these researches, saw in them nothing more than indications\r\nof promise; M. Lagrange then said to him explicitly:--\r\n\r\n\"Even you, M. de Laplace, when you entered the Academy, had done nothing\r\nbrilliant; you only gave promise. Your grand discoveries did not come\r\ntill afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nLagrange was the only man in Europe who could with authority address\r\nsuch an observation to him.\r\n\r\nM. de Laplace did not reply upon the ground of the personal question,\r\nbut he added,--\"I maintain that it is useful to young savans to hold out\r\nthe position of member of the Institute as a future recompense, to\r\nexcite their zeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You resemble,\" replied M. Hallé, \"the driver of the hackney coach, who,\r\nto excite his horses to a gallop, tied a bundle of hay at the end of his\r\ncarriage pole; the poor horses redoubled their efforts, and the bundle\r\nof hay always flew on before them. After all, his plan made them fall\r\noff, and soon after brought on their death.\"\r\n\r\nDelambre, Legendre, Biot, insisted on the devotion, and what they termed\r\nthe courage, with which I had combated arduous difficulties, whether in\r\ncarrying on the observations, or in saving the instruments and the\r\nresults already obtained. They drew an animated picture of the dangers I\r\nhad undergone. M. de Laplace ended by yielding when he saw that all the\r\nmost eminent men of the Academy had taken me under their patronage, and\r\non the day of the election he gave me his vote. It would be, I must own,\r\na subject of regret with me even to this day, after a lapse of forty-two\r\nyears, if I had become member of the Institute without having obtained\r\nthe vote of the author of the _Mécanique Céleste_.\r\n\r\nThe Members of the Institute were always presented to the Emperor after\r\nhe had confirmed their nominations. On the appointed day, in company\r\nwith the presidents, with the secretaries of the four classes, and with\r\nthe academicians who had special publications to offer to the Chief of\r\nthe State, they assembled in one of the saloons of the Tuileries. When\r\nthe Emperor returned from mass, he held a kind of review of these\r\nsavans, these artists, these literary men, in green uniform.\r\n\r\nI must own that the spectacle which I witnessed on the day of my\r\npresentation did not edify me. I even experienced real displeasure in\r\nseeing the anxiety evinced by members of the Institute to be noticed.\r\n\r\n\"You are very young,\" said Napoleon to me on coming near me; and without\r\nwaiting for a flattering reply, which it would not have been difficult\r\nto find, he added,--\"What is your name?\" And my neighbour on the right,\r\nnot leaving me time to answer the simple enough question just addressed\r\nto me, hastened to say,--\r\n\r\n\"_His_ name is Arago?\"\r\n\r\n\"What science do you cultivate?\"\r\n\r\nMy neighbour on the left immediately replied,--\r\n\r\n\"_He_ cultivates astronomy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\"\r\n\r\nMy neighbour on the right, jealous of my left hand neighbour for having\r\nencroached on his rights at the second question, now hastened to reply,\r\nand said,--\r\n\r\n\"_He_ has just been measuring the line of the meridian in Spain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor imagining doubtless that he had before him either a dumb man\r\nor an imbecile, passed on to another member of the Institute. This one\r\nwas not a novice, but a naturalist well known through his beautiful and\r\nimportant discoveries; it was M. Lamarck. The old man presented a book\r\nto Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" said the latter, \"it is your absurd _meteorology_, in\r\nwhich you rival Matthieu Laensberg. It is this 'annuaire' which\r\ndishonours your old age. Do something in Natural History, and I should\r\nreceive your productions with pleasure. As to this volume, I only take\r\nit in consideration of your white hair. Here!\" And he passed the book to\r\nan aide-de-camp.\r\n\r\nPoor M. Lamarck, who, at the end of each sharp and insulting sentence of\r\nthe Emperor, tried in vain to say, \"It is a work on Natural History\r\nwhich I present to you,\" was weak enough to fall into tears.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor immediately afterwards met with a more energetic antagonist\r\nin the person of M. Lanjuinais. The latter had advanced, book in hand.\r\nNapoleon said to him, sneeringly:--\r\n\r\n\"The entire Senate, then, is to merge in the Institute?\" \"Sire,\"\r\nreplied Lanjuinais, \"it is the body of the state to which most time is\r\nleft for occupying itself with literature.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, displeased at this answer, at once quitted the civil\r\nuniforms, and busied himself among the great epaulettes which filled the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nImmediately after my nomination, I was exposed to strange annoyances on\r\nthe part of the military authorities. I had left for Spain, still\r\nholding the title of pupil of the Polytechnic School. My name could not\r\nremain on the books more than four years; consequently I had been\r\nenjoined to return to France to go through the examinations necessary on\r\nquitting the school. But in the meantime Lalande died, and thus a place\r\nin the Bureau of Longitude became vacant. I was named assistant\r\nastronomer. These places were submitted to the nomination of the\r\nEmperor. M. Lacuée, Director of the Conscription, thought that, through\r\nthis latter circumstance, the law would be satisfied, and I was\r\nauthorized to continue my operations.\r\n\r\nM. Matthieu Dumas, who succeeded him, looked at the question from an\r\nentirely different point of view; he enjoined me either to furnish a\r\nsubstitute, or else to set off myself with the contingent of the twelfth\r\narrondissement of Paris.\r\n\r\nAll my remonstrances and those of my friends having been fruitless, I\r\nannounced to the honourable General that I should present myself in the\r\nPlace de l'Estrapade, whence the conscripts had to depart, in the\r\ncostume of a member of the Institute; and that thus I should march on\r\nfoot through the city of Paris. General Matthieu Dumas was alarmed at\r\nthe effect which this scene would produce on the Emperor, himself a\r\nmember of the Institute, and hastened, under fear of my threat, to\r\nconfirm the decision of General Lacuée.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1809, I was chosen by the \"conseil du perfectionnement\" of\r\nthe Polytechnic School, to succeed M. Monge, in his chair of Analysis\r\napplied to Geometry. The circumstances attending that nomination have\r\nremained a secret; I seize the first opportunity which offers itself to\r\nme to make them known.\r\n\r\nM. Monge took the trouble to come to me one day, at the Observatory, to\r\nask me to succeed him. I declined this honour, because of a proposed\r\njourney which I was going to make into Central Asia with M. de Humboldt.\r\n\"You will certainly not set off for some months to come,\" said the\r\nillustrious geometer; \"you could, therefore, take my place temporarily.\"\r\n\"Your proposal,\" I replied, \"flatters me infinitely; but I do not know\r\nwhether I ought to accept it. I have never read your great work on\r\npartial differential equations; I do not, therefore, feel certain that I\r\nshould be competent to give lessons to the pupils of the Polytechnic\r\nSchool on such a difficult theory.\" \"Try,\" said he, \"and you will find\r\nthat that theory is clearer than it is generally supposed to be.\"\r\nAccordingly, I did try; and M. Monge's opinion appeared to me to be well\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nThe public could not comprehend, at that time, how it was that the\r\nbenevolent M. Monge obstinately refused to confide the delivery of his\r\ncourse to M. Binet, (a private teacher under him,) whose zeal was well\r\nknown. It is this motive which I am going to reveal.\r\n\r\nThere was then in the \"Bois de Boulogne\" a residence named the _Grey\r\nHouse_, where there assembled round M. Coessin, the high-priest of a new\r\nreligion, a number of adepts, such as Lesueur, the musician, Colin,\r\nprivate teacher of chemistry at the school, M. Binet, &c. A report from\r\nthe prefect of police had signified to the Emperor that the frequenters\r\nof the Grey House were connected with the Society of Jesuits. The\r\nEmperor was uneasy and irritated at this. \"Well,\" said he to M. Monge,\r\n\"there are your dear pupils become disciples of Loyola!\" And on Monge's\r\ndenial, \"You deny it,\" answered the Emperor; \"well, then, know that the\r\nprivate teacher of your course is in that clique.\" Every one can\r\nunderstand that after such a remark, Monge could not consent to being\r\nsucceeded by M. Binet.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the academy, young, ardent, and impassioned, I took much\r\ngreater part in the nominations than may have been suitable for my\r\nposition and my time of life. Arrived at an epoch of life whence I\r\nexamine retrospectively all my actions with calmness and impartiality, I\r\ncan render this amount of justice to myself, that, excepting in three or\r\nfour instances, my vote and interest were always in favour of the most\r\ndeserving candidate, and more than once I succeeded in preventing the\r\nAcademy from making a deplorable choice. Who could blame me for having\r\nmaintained with energy the election of Malus, considering that his\r\ncompetitor, M. Girard, unknown as a physicist, obtained twenty-two votes\r\nout of fifty-three, and that an addition of five votes would have given\r\nhim the victory over the savant who had just discovered the phenomenon\r\nof polarization by reflection, over the savant whom Europe would have\r\nnamed by acclamation? The same remarks are applicable to the nomination\r\nof Poisson, who would have failed against this same M. Girard if four\r\nvotes had been otherwise given. Does not this suffice to justify the\r\nunusual ardour of my conduct? Although in a third trial the majority of\r\nthe Academy was decided in favour of the same engineer, I cannot regret\r\nthat I supported up to the last moment with conviction and warmth the\r\nelection of his competitor, M. Dulong.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that, in the scientific world, any one will he disposed\r\nto blame me for having preferred M. Liouville to M. de Pontécoulant.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happened that the Government wished to influence the choice\r\nof the Academy; with a strong sense of my rights I invariably resisted\r\nall dictation. Once this resistance acted unfortunately on one of my\r\nfriends--the venerable Legendre; as to myself, I had prepared myself\r\nbeforehand for all the persecutions of which I could be made the object.\r\nHaving received from the Minister of the Interior an invitation to vote\r\nfor M. Binet against M. Navier on the occurrence of a vacant place in\r\nthe section of mechanics, Legendre nobly answered that he would vote\r\naccording to his soul and his conscience. He was immediately deprived of\r\na pension which his great age and his long services rendered due to him.\r\nThe _protégé_ of the authorities failed; and, at the time, this result\r\nwas attributed to the activity with which I enlightened the members of\r\nthe Academy as to the impropriety of the Minister's proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the King wished the Academy to name Dupuytren, the\r\neminent surgeon, but whose character at the time lay under grave\r\nimputations. Dupuytren was nominated, but several blanks protested\r\nagainst the interference of the authorities in academic elections.\r\n\r\nI said above that I had saved the Academy from some deplorable choices;\r\nI will only cite a single instance, on which occasion I had the sorrow\r\nof finding myself in opposition to M. de Laplace. The illustrious\r\ngeometer wished a vacant place in the astronomical section to be granted\r\nto M. Nicollet,--a man without talent, and, moreover, suspected of\r\nmisdeeds which reflected on his honour in the most serious degree. At\r\nthe close of a contest, which I maintained undisguisedly,\r\nnotwithstanding the danger which might follow from thus braving the\r\npowerful protectors of M. Nicollet, the Academy proceeded to the ballot;\r\nthe respected M. Damoiseau, whose election I had supported, obtained\r\nforty-five votes out of forty-eight. Thus M. Nicollet had collected but\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said M. de Laplace to me, \"that it is useless to struggle\r\nagainst young people; I acknowledge that the man who is called the\r\n_great elector_ of the Academy is more powerful than I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied I; \"M. Arago can only succeed in counterbalancing the\r\nopinion justly preponderating for M. de Laplace, when the right is found\r\nto be without possible contradiction on his side.\"\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards M. Nicollet had run away to America, and the\r\nBureau of Longitude had a warrant passed to expel him ignominiously from\r\nits bosom.\r\n\r\nI would warn those savans, who, having early entered the Academy, might\r\nbe tempted to imitate my example, to expect nothing beyond the\r\nsatisfaction of their conscience. I warn them, with a knowledge of the\r\ncase, that gratitude will almost always be found wanting.\r\n\r\nThe elected academician, whose merits you have sometimes exalted beyond\r\nmeasure, pretends that you have done no more than justice to him; that\r\nyou have only fulfilled a duty, and that he therefore owes you no\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nDelambre died the 19th August, 1822. After the necessary delay, they\r\nproceeded to fill his place. The situation of Perpetual Secretary is not\r\none which can long be left vacant. The Academy named a commission to\r\npresent it with candidates; it was composed of Messrs. de Laplace,\r\nArago, Legendre, Rossel, Prony, and Lacroix. The list presented was\r\ncomposed of the names of Messrs. Biot, Fourier, and Arago. It is not\r\nnecessary for me to say with what obstinacy I opposed the inscription of\r\nmy name on this list; I was compelled to give way to the will of my\r\ncolleagues, but I seized the first opportunity of declaring publicly\r\nthat I had neither the expectation nor the wish to obtain a single vote;\r\nthat, moreover, I had on my hands already as much work as I could get\r\nthrough; that in this respect M. Biot was in the same position; and\r\nthat, in short, I should vote for the nomination of M. Fourier.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed, but I dare not flatter myself that it was the fact,\r\nthat my declaration exercised a certain influence on the result of the\r\nballot. The result was as follows: M. Fourier received thirty-eight\r\nvotes, and M. Biot ten. In a case of this nature each man carefully\r\nconceals his vote, in order not to run the risk of future disagreement\r\nwith him who may be invested with the authority which the Academy gives\r\nto the perpetual secretary. I do not know whether I shall be pardoned if\r\nI recount an incident which amused the Academy at the time.\r\n\r\nM. de Laplace, at the moment of voting, took two plain pieces of paper;\r\nhis neighbour was guilty of the indiscretion of looking, and saw\r\ndistinctly that the illustrious geometer wrote the name of Fourier on\r\nboth of them. After quietly folding them up, M. de Laplace put the\r\npapers into his hat, shook it, and said to this same curious neighbour:\r\n\"You see, I have written two papers; I am going to tear up one, I shall\r\nput the other into the urn; I shall thus be myself ignorant for which of\r\nthe two candidates I have voted.\"\r\n\r\nAll went on as the celebrated academician had said; only that every one\r\nknew with certainty that his vote had been for Fourier; and \"the\r\ncalculation of probabilities\" was in no way necessary for arriving at\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\nAfter having fulfilled the duties of secretary with much distinction,\r\nbut not without some feebleness and negligence in consequence of his bad\r\nhealth, Fourier died the 16th of May, 1830. I declined several times the\r\nhonour which the Academy appeared willing to do me, in naming me to\r\nsucceed him. I believed, without false modesty, that I had not the\r\nqualities necessary to fill this important place suitably. When\r\nthirty-nine out of forty-four voters had appointed me, it was quite time\r\nthat I should give in to an opinion so flattering and so plainly\r\nexpressed. On the 7th of June, 1830, I, therefore, became perpetual\r\nsecretary of the Academy for the Mathematical Sciences; but, conformably\r\nto the plea of an accumulation of offices, which I had used as an\r\nargument to support, in November, 1822, the election of M. Fournier, I\r\ndeclared that I should give in my resignation of the Professorship in\r\nthe Polytechnic School. Neither the solicitations of Marshal Soult, the\r\nMinister of War, nor those of the most eminent members of the Academy,\r\ncould avail in persuading me to renounce this resolution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] With such precocious heroism it is by no means so clear that the\r\nauthor might not have had a hand in the revolution, from which he\r\nendeavours above to exculpate himself.\r\n\r\n[2] Méchain, member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Institute, was\r\ncharged in 1792 with the prolongation of the measure of the arc of the\r\nmeridian in Spain as far as Barcelona.\r\n\r\nDuring his operations in the Pyrenees, in 1794, he had known my father,\r\nwho was one of the administrators of the department of the Eastern\r\nPyrenees. Later, in 1803, when the question was agitated as to the\r\ncontinuation of the measure of the meridian line as far as the Balearic\r\nIslands, M. Méchain went again to Perpignan, and came to pay my father a\r\nvisit. As I was about setting off to undergo the examination for\r\nadmission at the Polytechnic School, my father ventured to ask him\r\nwhether he could not recommend me to M. Monge. \"Willingly,\" answered he;\r\n\"but, with the frankness which is my characteristic, I ought not to\r\nleave you unaware that it appears to me improbable that your son, left\r\nto himself, can have rendered himself completely master of the subjects\r\nof which the programme consists. If, however, he be admitted, let him be\r\ndestined for the artillery, or for the engineers; the career of the\r\nsciences, of which you have talked to me, is really too difficult to go\r\nthrough, and unless he had a special calling for it, your son would only\r\nfind it deceptive.\" Anticipating a little the order of dates, let us\r\ncompare this advice with what occurred: I went to Toulouse, underwent\r\nthe examination, and was admitted; one year and a half afterwards I\r\nfilled the situation of secretary at the Observatory, which had become\r\nvacant by the resignation of M. Méchain's son; one year and a half\r\nlater, that is to say, four years after the Perpignan \"horoscope,\"\r\nassociated with M. Biot, I filled the place, in Spain, of the celebrated\r\nacademician who had died there, a victim to his labours.\r\n\r\n[3] This appears to be an oversight, as in a preceding page M. Arago\r\ndescribed the fortunate release of Captain Krog from this captivity.\r\n\r\n[4] On my return to Paris I hastened to the Jardin des Plantes to pay a\r\nvisit to the lion, but he received me with a very unamiable gnashing of\r\nthe teeth. Think then of the marvellous history of the Florentine lion,\r\nthe subject of so many engravings, which is offered on the stall of\r\nevery printseller to the eyes of the moved and astonished passers-by.\r\n\r\n[5] An \"_épileur_\" is a person who removes superfluous hairs. We have\r\nbeen unable to ascertain what office of this kind is performed in\r\nMohammedan funerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY READ AT THE PUBLIC SITTING OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, THE\r\n26TH OF FEBRUARY, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--The learned man, illustrious in so many ways, whose life I\r\nam going to relate, was taken from France half a century ago. I hasten\r\nto make this remark, so as thoroughly to show that I have selected this\r\nsubject without being deterred by complaints which I look upon as unjust\r\nand inapplicable. The glory of the members of the early Academy of\r\nSciences is an inheritance for the present Academy. We must cherish it\r\nas we would the glory of later days; we must hallow it with the same\r\nrespect, we must devote to it the same worship: the word _prescription_\r\nwould here be synonymous with ingratitude.\r\n\r\nIf it had happened, Gentlemen, that amongst the academicians who\r\npreceded us, a man, already illustrious by his labours, and, without\r\npersonal ambition, yet thrown, despite himself, into the midst of a\r\nterrible revolution, exposed to a thousand unrestrained passions, had\r\ncruelly disappeared in the political effervescence--oh! then, any\r\nnegligence, any delay in studying the facts would be inexcusable; the\r\nhonourable contemporaries of the victim would soon be no longer there to\r\nshed the light of their honest and impartial memory on obscure events;\r\nan existence devoted to the cultivation of reason and of truth would\r\ncome to be appreciated only from documents, on which, for my part, I\r\nwould not blindly draw, until it shall be proved that, in revolutionary\r\ntimes, we can trust to the uprightness of parties.\r\n\r\nI felt in duty bound, Gentlemen, to give you a sketch of the ideas that\r\nhave led me to present to you a detailed account of the life and labours\r\nof a member of the early Academy of Sciences. The biographies which will\r\nsoon follow this, will show that the studies I have undertaken\r\nrespecting Carnot, Condorcet, and Bailly, have not prevented me from\r\nattending seriously to our illustrious contemporaries.\r\n\r\nTo render them a loyal and truthful homage, is the first duty of the\r\nsecretaries of the Academy, and I will religiously fulfil it; without\r\nbinding myself, however, to observe a strict chronological order, or to\r\nfollow the civil registers step by step.\r\n\r\nEulogies, said an ancient authority, should be deferred until we have\r\nlost the true measure of the dead. Then we could make giants of them\r\nwithout any one opposing us. On the contrary, I am of opinion that\r\nbiographers, especially those of academicians, ought to make all\r\npossible haste, so that every one may be represented according to his\r\ntrue measure, and that well-informed people may have the opportunity of\r\nrectifying the mistakes which, notwithstanding every care, almost\r\ninevitably slip into this sort of composition. I regret that our former\r\nsecretaries did not adopt this rule. By deferring from year to year to\r\nanalyze the scientific and political life of Bailly with their scruples,\r\nand with their usual talents, they allowed time for inconsiderateness,\r\nprejudice, and passions of every kind, to impregnate our minds with a\r\nmultitude of serious errors, which have added considerably to the\r\ndifficulty of my task. When I was led to form very different opinions\r\nfrom those that are found spread through some of the most celebrated\r\nworks, on the events of the great revolution of 1789, in which our\r\nfellow-academician took an active part, I could not be so conceited as\r\nto expect to be believed on my own word. To propound my opinions then\r\nwas insufficient; I had also to combat those of the historians with whom\r\nI differed. This necessity has given to the biography that I am going to\r\nread an unusual length. I solicit the kind sympathy of the assembly on\r\nthis point. I hope to obtain it, I acknowledge, when I consider that my\r\ntask is to analyze before you the scientific and literary claims of an\r\nillustrious colleague, to depict the uniformly noble and patriotic\r\nconduct of the first President of the National Assembly; to follow the\r\nfirst Mayor of Paris in all the acts of an administration, the\r\ndifficulties of which appeared to be above human strength; to accompany\r\nthe virtuous magistrate to the very scaffold, to unroll the mournful\r\nphases of the cruel martyrdom that he was made to undergo; to retrace,\r\nin a word, some of the greatest, some of the most terrible events of the\r\nFrench Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANCY OF BAILLY.--HIS YOUTH.--HIS LITERARY ESSAYS.--HIS MATHEMATICAL\r\nSTUDIES.\r\n\r\nJohn Sylvain Bailly was born at Paris in 1736. His parents were James\r\nBailly and Cecilia Guichon.\r\n\r\nThe father of the future astronomer had charge of the king's pictures.\r\nThis post had continued in the obscure but honest family of Bailly for\r\nupwards of a century.\r\n\r\nSylvain, while young, never quitted his paternal home. His mother would\r\nnot be separated from him; it was not that she could give him the\r\ninstruction required from masters in childhood, but a tenderness,\r\nallowed to run to the utmost extreme, entirely blinded her. Bailly then\r\nformed his own mind, under the eye of his parents. Nothing could be\r\nbetter, it seemed, than the boyhood of our brother academician, to\r\nverify the oft-repeated theory, touching the influence of imitation on\r\nthe development of our faculties. Here, the result, attentively\r\nexamined, would not by a great deal agree with the old hypothesis. I\r\nknow not but, every thing considered, whether it would rather furnish\r\npowerful weapons to whoever would wish to maintain that, in its early\r\nhabits, childhood rather seeks for contrasts.\r\n\r\nJames Bailly had an idle and light character; whilst young Sylvain from\r\nthe beginning showed strong reasoning powers, and a passion for study.\r\n\r\nThe grown man felt in his own element while in noisy gayety.\r\n\r\nBut the boy loved retirement.\r\n\r\nTo the father, solitude would have been fatal; for to him life consisted\r\nin motion, sallies, witty conversations, free and easy parties, the\r\nlittle gay suppers of those days.\r\n\r\nThe son, on the contrary, would remain alone and quite silent for whole\r\ndays. His mind sufficed to itself; he never sought the fellowship of\r\ncompanions of his own age. Extreme steadiness was at once his habit and\r\nhis taste.\r\n\r\nThe warder of the king's pictures drew remarkably well, but did not\r\nappear to have troubled himself much with the principles of art.\r\n\r\nHis son Sylvain studied those principles deeply, and to some purpose; he\r\nbecame a theoretic artist of the first class, but he never could either\r\ndraw or paint even moderately well.\r\n\r\nThere are few young people who would not, at some time or other, have\r\nwished to escape from the scrutinizing eyes of their parents. The\r\ncontrary was the case in Bailly's family, for James used sometimes to\r\nsay to his friends or to his servants, \"Do not mention this peccadillo\r\nto my son. Sylvain is worth more than I am; his morals are very strict.\r\nUnder the most respectful exterior, I should perceive in his manner a\r\ncensure which would grieve me. I wish to avoid his tacit reproaches,\r\neven when he does not say a word.\"\r\n\r\nThe two characters resembled each other only in one point--in their\r\ntaste for poetry, or perhaps we ought to say versification, but even\r\nhere we shall perceive differences.\r\n\r\nThe father composed songs, little interludes, and farces that were acted\r\nat the _Italian Comedy_; but the son commenced at the age of sixteen by\r\na serious work of time,--a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThis tragedy was entitled _Clothaire_. The subject, drawn from the early\r\ncenturies of the French History, had led Bailly by a curious and\r\ntouching coincidence to relate the tortures inflicted on a Mayor of\r\nParis by a deluded and barbarous multitude. The work was modestly\r\nsubmitted to the actor Lanoue, who, although he bestowed flattering\r\nencouragement on Bailly, dissuaded him frankly from exposing _Clothaire_\r\nto the risk of a public representation. On the advice of the\r\ncomedian-author, the young poet took _Iphygenia in Tauris_ for the\r\nsubject of his second composition. Such was his ardour, that by the end\r\nof three months, he had already written the last line of the fifth act\r\nof his new tragedy, and hastened to Passy, to solicit the opinion of the\r\nauthor of _Mahomet II_. This time Lanoue thought he perceived that his\r\nconfiding young friend was not intended by nature for the drama, and he\r\ndeclared it to him without disguise. Bailly heard the fatal sentence\r\nwith more resignation than could have been expected from a youth whose\r\nbudding self-esteem received so violent a shock. He even threw his two\r\ntragedies immediately into the fire. Under similar circumstances,\r\nFontenelle showed less docility in his youth. If the tragedy of _Aspar_\r\nalso disappeared in the flames, it was not only in consequence of the\r\ncriticism of a friend; for the author went so far as to call forth the\r\nnoisy judgment of the pit.\r\n\r\nCertainly no astronomer will regret that any opinions either off-hand or\r\nwell digested, on the first literary productions of Bailly, contributed\r\nto throw him into the pursuit of science. Still, for the sake of\r\nprinciple, it seems just to protest against the praises given to the\r\nforesight of Lanoue, to the sureness of his judgment, to the excellence\r\nof his advice. What was it in fact? A lad of sixteen or seventeen years\r\nof age, composes two tolerable tragedies, and these essays are made\r\nirrevocably to decide on his future fate. We have then forgotten that\r\nRacine had already reached the age of twenty-two, when he first\r\nappeared, producing _Theagenes and Charicles_, and the _Inimical\r\nBrothers_; that Crébillon was nearly forty years of age when he composed\r\na tragedy on _The Death of the Sons of Brutus_, of which not a single\r\nverse has been preserved; finally, that the two first comedies of\r\nMolière, _The three rival Doctors_ and _The Schoolmaster_, are no longer\r\nknown but by their titles. Let us recall to mind that reflection of\r\nVoltaire's: \"It is very difficult to succeed before the age of thirty in\r\na branch of literature that requires a knowledge of the world and of the\r\nhuman heart.\"\r\n\r\nA happy chance showed that the sciences might open an honourable and\r\nglorious path to the discouraged poet. M. de Moncaville offered to teach\r\nhim mathematics, in exchange for drawing-lessons that his son received\r\nfrom the warder of the king's pictures. The proposal being accepted, the\r\nprogress of Sylvain Bailly in these studies was rapid and brilliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY BECOMES THE PUPIL OF LACAILLE.--HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN HIS\r\nASTRONOMICAL LABOURS.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical student soon after had one of those providential\r\nmeetings which decide a young man's future fate. Mademoiselle Lejeuneux\r\ncultivated painting. It was at the house of this female artist, known\r\nafterwards as Madame La Chenaye, that Lacaille saw Bailly. The\r\nattentive, serious, and modest demeanour of the student charmed the\r\ngreat astronomer. He showed it in a most unequivocal manner, by\r\noffering, though so avaricious of his time, to become the guide of the\r\nfuture observer, and also to put him in communication with Clairaut.\r\n\r\nIt is said that from his first intercourse with Lacaille, Bailly showed\r\na decided vocation for astronomy. This fact appears to me incontestable.\r\nAt his first appearance in this line, I find him associated in the most\r\nlaborious, difficult, and tiresome investigations of that great\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThese epithets may perhaps appear extraordinary; but they will be so\r\nonly to those who have learnt the science of the stars in ancient poems,\r\neither in verse or in prose.\r\n\r\nThe Chaldæans, luxuriously reclining on the perfumed terraced roofs of\r\ntheir houses in Babylon, under a constantly azure sky, followed with\r\ntheir eyes the general and majestic movements of the starry sphere; they\r\nascertained the respective displacements of the planets, the moon, the\r\nsun; they noted the date and hour of eclipses; they sought out whether\r\nsimple periods would not enable them to foretell these magnificent\r\nphenomena a long time beforehand. Thus the Chaldæans created, if I may\r\nbe allowed the expression, _Contemplative Astronomy_. Their observations\r\nwere neither numerous nor exact; they both made and discussed them\r\nwithout labour and without trouble.\r\n\r\nSuch is not, by a great deal, the position of modern astronomers.\r\nScience has felt the necessity of the celestial motions being studied in\r\ntheir minutest details. Theories must explain these details; it is their\r\ntouchstone; it is by details that theories become confirmed or fall to\r\nthe ground. Besides, in Astronomy, the most important truths, the most\r\nastonishing results, are based on the measurement of quantities of\r\nextreme minuteness. Such measures, the present bases of the science,\r\nrequire very fatiguing attention, infinite care, to which no learned man\r\nwould bind himself, were he not sustained, and encouraged by the hope of\r\nattaining some capital determination, through an ardent and decided\r\ndevotion to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe modern astronomer, really worthy of the name, must renounce the\r\ndistractions of society, and even the refreshment of uninterrupted\r\nsleep. In our climates during the inclement season, the sky is almost\r\nconstantly overspread by a thick curtain of clouds. Under pain of\r\npostponing by some centuries the verification of this or that theoretic\r\npoint, we must watch the least clearing off, and avail ourselves of it\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nA favourable wind arises and dissipates the vapours in the very\r\ndirection where some important phenomenon will manifest itself, and is\r\nto last only a few seconds. The astronomer, exposed to all the\r\ntransitions of weather, (it is one of the conditions of accuracy,) the\r\nbody painfully bent, directs the telescope of a great graduated circle\r\nin haste upon the star that he impatiently awaits. His lines for\r\nmeasuring are a spider's threads. If in looking he makes a mistake of\r\nhalf the thickness of one of these threads, the observation is good for\r\nnothing; judge what his uneasiness must be; at the critical moment, a\r\npuff of wind occasioning a vibration in the artificial light adapted to\r\nhis telescope, the threads become almost invisible; the star itself,\r\nwhose rays reach the eye through atmospheric strata of various density,\r\ntemperature, and refrangibility, will appear to oscillate so much as to\r\nrender the true position of it almost unassignable; at the very moment\r\nwhen extremely good definition of the object becomes indispensable to\r\ninsure correctness of measures, all becomes confused, either because the\r\neye-piece gets steamed with vapour, or that the vicinity of the very\r\ncold metal occasions an abundant secretion of tears in the eye applied\r\nto the telescope; the poor observer is then exposed to the alternative\r\nof abandoning to some other more fortunate person than himself, the\r\nascertaining a phenomenon that will not recur during his lifetime, or\r\nintroducing into the science results of problematical correctness.\r\nFinally, to complete the observation, he must read off the microscopical\r\ndivisions of the graduated circle, and for what opticians call _indolent\r\nvision_ (the only sort that the ancients ever required) must substitute\r\n_strained vision_, which in a few years brings on blindness.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen he has scarcely escaped from this physical and moral torture, and\r\nthe astronomer wishes to know what degree of utility is deducible from\r\nhis labours, he is obliged to plunge into numerical calculations of\r\nrepelling length and intricacy. Some observations that have been made in\r\nless than a minute, require a whole day's work in order to be compared\r\nwith the tables.\r\n\r\nSuch was the view that Lacaille, without any softening, exhibited to his\r\nyoung friend; such was the profession into which the adolescent poet\r\nplunged with great ardour, and without having been at all prepared for\r\nthe transition.\r\n\r\nA useful calculation constituted the first claim of our tyro to the\r\nattention of the learned world.\r\n\r\nThe year 1759 had been marked by one of those great events, the memory\r\nof which is religiously preserved in scientific history. A comet, that\r\nof 1682, had returned at the epoch foretold by Clairaut, and very nearly\r\nin the region that mathematical analysis had indicated to him. This\r\nreappearance raised comets out of the category of sublunary meteors; it\r\ngave them definitely closed curves as orbits, instead of parabolas, or\r\neven mere straight lines; attraction confined them within its immense\r\ndomain; in short, these bodies ceased for ever to be liable to\r\nsuperstition regarding them as prognostics.\r\n\r\nThe stringency, the importance of these results, would naturally\r\nincrease in proportion as the resemblance between the announced orbit\r\nand the real orbit became more evident.\r\n\r\nThis was the motive that determined so many astronomers to calculate the\r\norbit of the comet minutely, from the observations made in 1759,\r\nthroughout Europe. Bailly was one of those zealous calculators. In the\r\npresent day, such a labour would scarcely deserve special mention; but\r\nwe must remark that the methods at the close of the eighteenth century\r\nwere far from being so perfect as those that are now in use, and that\r\nthey greatly depended on the personal ability of the individual who\r\nundertook them.\r\n\r\nBailly resided in the Louvre. Being determined to make the theory and\r\npractice of astronomy advance together, he had an observatory\r\nestablished from the year 1760, at one of the windows in the upper story\r\nof the south gallery. Perhaps I may occasion surprise by giving the\r\npompous name of _Observatory_ to the space occupied by a window, and the\r\nsmall number of instruments that it could contain. I admit this feeling,\r\nprovided it be extended to the Royal Observatory of the epoch, to the\r\nold imposing and severe mass of stone that attracts the attention of the\r\npromenaders in the great walk of the Luxembourg. There also, the\r\nastronomers were obliged to stand in the hollow of the windows; there\r\nalso they said, like Bailly: I cannot verify my quadrants either by the\r\nhorizon or by the zenith, for I can neither see the horizon nor the\r\nzenith. This ought to be known, even if it should disturb the wild\r\nreveries of two or three writers, who have no scientific authority:\r\nFrance did not possess an observatory worthy of her, nor worthy of the\r\nscience, and capable of rivalling the other observatories of Europe,\r\nuntil within these ten or twelve years.\r\n\r\nThe earliest observations made by Bailly, from one of the windows in the\r\nupper story of the Louvre gallery that looks out on the Pont des Arts,\r\nare dated in the beginning of 1760. The pupil of Lacaille was not yet\r\ntwenty-four years old. Those observations relate to an opposition of the\r\nplanet Mars. In the same year he determined the oppositions of Jupiter\r\nand of Saturn, and compared the results of his own determinations with\r\nthe tables.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent year I see him associated with Lacaille in observing the\r\ntransit of Venus over the sun's disk. It was an extraordinary piece of\r\ngood fortune, Gentlemen, at the very commencement of his scientific\r\nlife, to witness in succession two of the most interesting astronomical\r\nevents: the first predicted and well established return of a comet; and\r\none of those partial eclipses of the sun by Venus, that do not recur\r\ntill after the lapse of a hundred and ten years, and from which science\r\nhas deduced the indirect but exact method, without which we should still\r\nbe ignorant of the fact that the sun's mean distance from our earth is\r\nthirty-eight millions of leagues.\r\n\r\nI shall have completed the enumeration of Bailly's astronomical labours\r\nperformed before he became an academician, when I have added, from\r\nobservations of the comet of 1762, the calculation of its parabolic\r\norbit; the discussion of forty-two observations of the moon by La Hire,\r\na detailed labour destined to serve as a starting point for any person\r\noccupying himself with the lunar theory; finally, also the reduction of\r\n515 zodiacal stars, observed by Lacaille in 1760 and 1761.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[6] This long list of supposed difficulties in making an exact\r\nobservation is hardly worthy of a zealous astronomer. Our author shows\r\nno enthusiasm for his subject here, and ends by ascribing the whole\r\njeremiad to Lacaille, a man of very great practical perseverance. It is\r\nto be regretted that Arago never refers to observations of his own, but\r\nconstantly quotes from others, nor does he always select the best.\r\n--_Translator's Note_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY A MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.--HIS RESEARCHES ON JUPITER'S\r\nSATELLITES.\r\n\r\nBailly was named member of the Academy of Sciences the 29th January,\r\n1763. From that moment his astronomical zeal no longer knew any bounds.\r\nThe laborious life of our fellow-academician might, on occasion, be set\r\nup against a line, more fanciful than true, by which an ill-natured poet\r\nstigmatized academical honours. Certainly no one would say of Bailly,\r\nthat after his election,\r\n\r\n     \"Il s'endormit et ne fit qu'un somme.\"\r\n\r\n     \"He fell asleep and made but one nap (or sum).\"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, we cannot but be surprised at the multitude of literary\r\nand scientific labours that he accomplished in a few years.\r\n\r\nBailly's earliest researches on Jupiter's satellites began in 1763.\r\n\r\nThe subject was happily chosen. Studying it in all its generalities, he\r\nshowed himself both an indefatigable computer, a clear-sighted geometer,\r\nand an industrious and able observer. Bailly's researches on the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, will always be his first and chief claim to\r\nscientific glory. Before him, the Maraldis, the Bradleys, the Wargentins\r\nhad discovered empirically some of the principal perturbations that\r\nthose bodies undergo, in their revolving motions around the powerful\r\nplanet that rules them; but they had not been traced up to the\r\nprinciples of universal attraction. The initiative honour in this\r\nrespect belongs to Bailly. Nor is this honour decreased by the ulterior\r\nand considerable improvements that the science has since received; even\r\nthe discoveries of Lagrange and of Laplace have left this honour intact.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the satellitic motions rests almost entirely on the\r\nobservation of the precise moment when each of those bodies disappears,\r\nby entering into the conical shadow, which the immense opaque globe of\r\nJupiter projects on the opposite side from the sun. In the course of\r\ndiscussing a multitude of these eclipses, Bailly was not long in\r\nperceiving that the computers of the Satellitic Tables worked on\r\nnumerical data that were not at all comparable with each other. This\r\nseemed of little consequence previous to the birth of the theory; but,\r\nafter the analytical discovery of the perturbations, it became desirable\r\nto estimate the possible errors of observation, and to suggest means for\r\nremedying them. This was the object of the very considerable work that\r\nBailly presented to the Academy in 1771.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful memoir, the illustrious astronomer developes the\r\nseries of experiments, by the aid of which each observation may give the\r\ninstant of the real disappearance of a satellite, distinguished from the\r\ninstant of the apparent disappearance, whatever be the power of the\r\ntelescope used, whatever be the altitude of the eclipsed body above the\r\nhorizon, and consequently, whatever be the transparency of the\r\natmospheric strata through which the phenomenon is observed, also\r\nwhatever be the distance from that body to the sun, or to the planet;\r\nfinally, whatever be the sensibility of the observer's sight, all which\r\ncircumstances considerably influence the time of apparent disappearance.\r\nThe same series of ingenious and delicate observations led the author,\r\nvery curiously, to the determination of the true diameters of the\r\nsatellites, that is to say, of small luminous points, which, with the\r\ntelescopes then in use, showed no perceptible diameter.\r\n\r\nI will rest contented with these general considerations; only remarking,\r\nin addition, that the diaphragms used by Bailly were not intended only\r\nto diminish the quantity of light contributing to the formation of the\r\nimages, but that they considerably increase the diameter, and in a\r\nvariable way, at least in the instance of stars.\r\n\r\nUnder this new aspect, it will be requisite to submit the question to a\r\nnew examination.\r\n\r\nAny geometers and astronomers who wish to know all the extent of\r\nBailly's labours, must not content themselves with consulting the\r\ncollections in the Academy of Sciences; for he published, at the\r\nbeginning of 1766, a separate work under the modest title of _Essay on\r\nthe Theory of Jupiter's Satellites_.\r\n\r\nThe author commences with the _Astronomical History of the Satellites_.\r\nThis history contains an almost complete analysis of the discoveries by\r\nMaraldi, by Bradley, by Wargentin. The labours of Galileo and his\r\ncontemporaries are given with less detail and exactness. I have thought\r\nthat I ought to fill up the lacunæ, by availing myself of some very\r\nprecious documents published a few years since, and which were unknown\r\nto Bailly.\r\n\r\nBut this I will do in a separate notice, free from all preconceived\r\nideas, and free from all party spirit; I will not forget that an honest\r\nman ought not to calumniate any one, not even the agents of the\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY'S LITERARY WORKS.--HIS BIOGRAPHIES OF CHARLES V.--OF\r\nLEIBNITZ--OF PETER CORNEILLE--OF MOLIÈRE.\r\n\r\nWhen Bailly entered the Academy of Sciences, the perpetual secretary was\r\nGrandjean de Fouchy. The bad health of this estimable scholar occasioned\r\nan early vacancy to be foreseen. D'Alembert cast his views on Bailly,\r\nhinted to him the survivorship to Fouchy, and proposed to him, by way of\r\npreparing the way, to write some biographies. Bailly followed the advice\r\nof the illustrious geometer, and chose as the subject of his studies,\r\nthe éloges proposed by several academies, though principally by the\r\nFrench Academy.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1671 to the year 1758, the prize subjects proposed by the\r\nFrench Academy related to questions of religion and morality. The\r\neloquence of the candidates had therefore had to exercise itself\r\nsuccessively on the knowledge of salvation; on the merit and dignity of\r\nmartyrdom; on the purity of the soul and of the body; on the danger\r\nthere is in certain paths that appear safe, &c. &c. It had even to\r\nparaphrase the _Ave Maria_. According to the literal intentions of the\r\nfounder, (Balzac,) each discourse was ended by a short prayer. Duclos\r\nthought in 1758, that five or six volumes of similar sermons must have\r\nexhausted the matter, and on his proposal the Academy decided that, in\r\nfuture, it would give as the subject of the eloquence prize, the\r\neulogiums of the great men of the nation. Marshal Saxe, Duguay Trouin,\r\nSully, D'Aguesseau, Descartes, figured first on this list. Later, the\r\nAcademy felt itself authorized to propose the éloge of kings themselves;\r\nit entered on this new branch at the beginning of 1767, by asking for\r\nthe éloge of Charles V.\r\n\r\nBailly entered the lists, but his essay obtained only an honourable\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nNothing is more instructive than to search out at what epoch originated\r\nthe principles and opinions of persons who have acted an important part\r\non the political scene, and how those opinions developed themselves. By\r\na fatality much to be regretted, the elements of these investigations\r\nare rarely numerous or faithful. We shall not have to express these\r\nregrets relative to Bailly. Each composition shows us the serene,\r\ncandid, and virtuous mind of the illustrious writer, in a new and true\r\npoint of view. The éloge of Charles V. was the starting point, followed\r\nby a long series of works, and it ought to arrest our attention for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nThe writings, crowned with the approbation of the French Academy, did\r\nnot reach the public eye till they had been submitted to the severe\r\ncensure of four Doctors in Theology. A special and digested approbation\r\nby the high dignitaries of the Church, whom the illustrious assembly\r\nalways possessed among her members, was not a sufficient substitute for\r\nthe humbling formality. If we are sure that we possess the éloge of\r\nCharles V. such as it flowed from the author's pen; if we have not\r\nreason to fear that the thoughts have undergone some mutilation, we owe\r\nit to the little favour that the discourse of Bailly enjoyed in the\r\nsitting of the Academy in 1767. Those thoughts, however, would have\r\ndefied the most squeamish mind, the most shadowy susceptibility. The\r\npanegyrist unrolls with emotion the frightful misfortunes that assailed\r\nFrance during the reign of King John. The temerity, the improvidence of\r\nthat monarch; the disgraceful passions of the King of Navarre; his\r\ntreacheries; the barbarous avidity of the nobility; the seditious\r\ndisposition of the people; the sanguinary depredations of the great\r\ncompanies; the ever recurring insolence of England; all this is\r\nexpressed without disguise, yet with extreme moderation. No trait\r\nreveals, no fact even foreshadows in the author, the future President of\r\na reforming National Assembly, still less the Mayor of Paris, during a\r\nrevolutionary effervescence. The author may make Charles V. say that he\r\nwill discard favour, and will call in renown to select his\r\nrepresentatives; it will appear to him that taxes ought to be laid on\r\nriches and spared on poverty; he may even exclaim that oppression\r\nawakens ideas of equality. His temerity will not overleap this boundary.\r\nBossuet, Massillon, Bourdaloue, made the Chair resound with bold words\r\nof another description.\r\n\r\nI am far from blaming this scrupulous reserve; when moderation is united\r\nto firmness, it becomes power. In a word, however, Bailly's patriotism\r\nmight, I was about to say ought to, have shown itself more susceptible,\r\nmore ardent, prouder. When in the elegant prosopopoeia which closes\r\nthe éloge, the King of England has recalled with arrogance the fatal day\r\nof Poitiers, ought he not instantly to have restrained that pride within\r\njust limits? ought he not to have cast a hasty glance on the components\r\nof the Black Prince's army? to examine whether a body of troops,\r\nstarting from Bordeaux, recruiting in Guienne, did not contain more\r\nGascons than English? whether France, now bounded by its natural limits,\r\nin its magnificent unity, would not have a right, every thing being\r\nexamined, to consider that battle almost as an event of civil war? ought\r\nhe not, in short, to have pointed out, in order to corroborate his\r\nremarks, that the knight to whom King John surrendered himself, Denys de\r\nMorbecque, was a French officer banished from Artois?\r\n\r\nSelf-reliance on the field of battle is the first requisite for\r\nobtaining success; now, would not our self-reliance be shaken, if the\r\nmen most likely to know the facts, and to appreciate them wisely,\r\nappeared to think that the Frank race were nationally inferior to other\r\nraces who had peopled this or that region, either neighbouring or\r\ndistant? This, let it be well remarked, is not a puerile susceptibility.\r\nGreat events may, on a given day, depend on the opinion that the nation\r\nhas formed of itself. Our neighbours on the other side of the Channel,\r\nafford examples on this subject that it would be well to imitate.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, the Academy of Berlin proposed a prize for an éloge of\r\nLeibnitz. The public was somewhat surprised at it. It was generally\r\nsupposed that Leibnitz had been admirably praised by Fontenelle, and\r\nthat the subject was exhausted. But from the moment that Bailly's essay,\r\ncrowned in Prussia, was published, former impressions were quite\r\nchanged. Every one was anxiously asserting that Bailly's appreciation of\r\nhis subject might be read with pleasure and benefit, even after\r\nFontenelle's. The éloge composed by the historian of Astronomy will not,\r\ncertainly, make us forget that written by the first Secretary of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences. The style is, perhaps, too stiff; perhaps it is\r\nalso rather declamatory; but the biography, and the analysis of his\r\nworks, are more complete, especially if we consider the notes; the\r\n_universal_ Leibnitz is exhibited under more varied points of view.\r\n\r\nIn 1768, Bailly obtained the award of the prize of eloquence proposed\r\nby the Academy of Rouen. The subject was the éloge of Peter Corneille.\r\nIn reading this work of our fellow-academician, we may be somewhat\r\nsurprised at the immense distance that the modest, the timid, the\r\nsensitive Bailly puts between the great Corneille, his special\r\nfavourite, and Racine.\r\n\r\nWhen the French Academy, in 1768, proposed an éloge of Molière for\r\ncompetition, our candidate was vanquished only by Chamfort. And yet, if\r\npeople had not since that time treated of the author of \"Tartufe\" to\r\nsatiety, perhaps I would venture to maintain, notwithstanding some\r\ninferiority of style, that Bailly's discourse offered a neater, truer,\r\nand more philosophic appreciation of the principal pieces of that\r\nimmortal poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBATES RELATIVE TO THE POST OF PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE ACADEMY OF\r\nSCIENCES.\r\n\r\nWe have seen D'Alembert, ever since the year 1763, encouraging Bailly to\r\nexercise himself in a style of literary composition then much liked, the\r\nstyle of éloge, and holding out to him in prospect the situation of\r\nPerpetual Secretary of the Academy of Sciences. Six years after, the\r\nillustrious geometer gave the same advice, and perhaps held out the same\r\nhopes, to the young Marquis de Condorcet. This candidate, docile to the\r\nvoice of his protector, rapidly composed and published the éloges of the\r\nearly founders of the Academy, of Huyghens, of Mariotte, of Roëmer, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1773, the Perpetual Secretary, Grandjean de Fouchy,\r\nrequested that Condorcet should be nominated his successor, provided he\r\nsurvived him. D'Alembert strongly supported this candidateship. Buffon\r\nsupported Bailly with equal energy; the Academy presented for some\r\nweeks the aspect of two hostile camps. There was at last a strongly\r\ndisputed electoral battle; the result was the nomination of Condorcet.\r\n\r\nI should regret if we had to judge of the sentiments of Bailly, after\r\nthis defeat, by those of his adherents. Their anger found vent in terms\r\nof unpardonable asperity. They said that D'Alembert had \"basely betrayed\r\nfriendship, honour, and the first principles of probity.\"\r\n\r\nThey here alluded to a promise of protection, support, coöperation,\r\ndating ten years back. But was his promise absolute? Engaging himself\r\npersonally to Bailly for a situation that might not become vacant for\r\nten or fifteen years, had D'Alembert, contrary to his duty as an\r\nacademician, declared beforehand, that any other candidate, whatever\r\nmight be his talents, would be to him as not existing?\r\n\r\nThis is what ought to have been ascertained, before giving themselves up\r\nto such violent and odious imputations.\r\n\r\nWas it not quite natural that the geometer D'Alembert, having to\r\npronounce his opinion between two honourable learned men, gave the\r\npreference to the candidate who seemed to him most imbued with the\r\nhigher mathematics? The éloges of Condorcet were, besides, by their\r\nstyle, much more in harmony with those that the Academy had approved\r\nduring three quarters of a century. Before the declaration of the\r\nvacancy on the 27th of February, 1773, D'Alembert said to Voltaire,\r\nrelative to the recueil by Condorcet, \"Some one asked me the other day\r\nwhat I thought of that work. I answered by writing on the frontispiece,\r\n'Justice, propriety, learning, clearness, precision, taste, elegance,\r\nand nobleness.'\" And Voltaire wrote, on the 1st of March, \"I have read,\r\nwhile dying, the little book by M. de Condorcet; it is as good in its\r\ndepartments as the éloges by Fontenelle. There is a more noble and more\r\nmodest philosophy in it, though bold.\"\r\n\r\nAnd excitement in words and action could not be legitimately reproached\r\nin a man who had felt himself supported by a conviction of such distinct\r\nand powerful influence.\r\n\r\nAmong the éloges by Bailly, there is one, that of the Abbé de Lacaille,\r\nwhich not having been written for a literary academy, shows no longer\r\nany trace of inflation or declamation, and might, it seems to me,\r\ncompete with some of the best éloges by Condorcet. Yet, it is curious,\r\nthat this excellent biography contributed, perhaps as much as\r\nD'Alembert's opposition, to make Bailly's claims fail. Vainly did the\r\ncelebrated astronomer flatter himself in his exordium, \"that M. de\r\nFouchy, who, as Secretary of the Academy, had already paid his tribute\r\nto Lacaille, would not be displeased at his having followed him in the\r\nsame career ... that he would not be blamed for repeating the praises\r\ndue to an illustrious man.\"\r\n\r\nBailly, in fact, was not blamed aloud; but when the hour for retreat had\r\nsounded in M. de Fouchy's ear, without any fuss, without showing himself\r\noffended in his self-love, remaining apparently modest, this learned\r\nman, in asking for an assistant, selected one who had not undertaken to\r\nrepeat his éloges; who had not found his biographies insufficient. This\r\npreference ought not to be, and was not, uninfluential in the result of\r\nthe competition.\r\n\r\nBailly, if Perpetual Secretary of the Academy, would have been obliged\r\nto reside constantly at Paris. But Bailly, as member of the Astronomical\r\nSection, might retire to the country, and thus escape those thieves of\r\ntime, as Byron called them, who especially abound in the metropolis.\r\nBailly settled at Chaillot. It was at Chaillot that our\r\nfellow-academician composed his best works, those that will sail down\r\nthe stream of time.\r\n\r\nNature had endowed Bailly with the most happy memory. He did not write\r\nhis discourses till he had completed them in his head. His first copy\r\nwas always a clean copy. Every morning Bailly started early from his\r\nhumble residence at Chaillot; he went to the Bois de Boulogne, and\r\nthere, walking for many hours at a time, his powerful mind elaborated,\r\ncoördinated, and robed in all the pomps of language, those high\r\nconceptions destined to charm successive generations. Biographers inform\r\nus that Crébillon composed in a similar way. And this was, according to\r\nseveral critics, the cause of the incorrectness, of the asperity of\r\nstyle, which disfigure several pieces by that tragic poet. The works of\r\nBailly, and especially the discourses that complete the _History of\r\nAstronomy_, invalidate this explanation. I could also appeal to the\r\nelegant and pure productions of that poet whom France has just lost and\r\nweeps for. No one indeed can be ignorant of his works; Casimir\r\nDelavigne, like Bailly, never committed his verses to paper until he had\r\nworked them up in his mind to that harmonious perfection which procured\r\nfor them the unanimous suffrages of all people of taste. Gentlemen,\r\npardon this reminiscence. The heart loves to connect such names as those\r\nof Bailly and of Delavigne; those rare and glorious symbols, in whom we\r\nfind united talent, virtue, and an invariable patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ASTRONOMY.--LETTERS ON THE ATLANTIS OF PLATO AND ON THE\r\nANCIENT HISTORY OF ASIA.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Bailly published a quarto volume, entitled _History of Ancient\r\nAstronomy, from its Origin up to the Establishment of the Alexandrian\r\nSchool_. An analogous work for the lapse of time, comprised between the\r\nAlexandrian School and 1730, appeared in 1779, in two volumes. An\r\nadditional volume appeared three years later, entitled the _History of\r\nModern Astronomy up to the Epoch of 1782_. The fifth part of this\r\nimmense composition, the _History of Indian Astronomy_, was published in\r\n1787.\r\n\r\nWhen Bailly undertook this general history of Astronomy, the science\r\npossessed nothing of the sort. Erudition had seized upon some special\r\nquestions, some detailed points, but no commanding view had presided\r\nover these investigations.\r\n\r\nWeidler's book, published in 1741, was a mere simple nomenclature of the\r\nastronomers of every age, and of every country; the dates of their birth\r\nand death; the titles of their works. The utility of this precise\r\nenumeration of dates and titles did not alter the character of the book.\r\n\r\nBailly sketches the plan of his work with a masterly hand in a few\r\nlines; he says, \"It is interesting to transport one's self back to the\r\ntimes when Astronomy began; to observe how discoveries were connected\r\ntogether, how errors have got mixed up with truth, have delayed the\r\nknowledge of it, and retarded its progress; and, after having followed\r\nthe various epochs and traversed every climate, finally to contemplate\r\nthe edifice founded on the labours of successive centuries and of\r\nvarious nations.\"\r\n\r\nThis vast plan essentially led to the minute discussion and comparison\r\nof a multitude of passages both ancient and modern. If the author had\r\nmixed up these discussions with the body of the work, he would have\r\nlaboured for astronomers only. If he had suppressed all discussions, the\r\nbook would have interested amateurs only. To avoid this double rock,\r\nBailly decided on writing a connected narrative with the quintessence of\r\nthe facts, and to place the proofs and the discussions of the merely\r\nconjectural parts, under the appellation of explanations in separate\r\nchapters. Bailly's History, without forfeiting the character of a\r\nserious and erudite work, became accessible to the public in general,\r\nand contributed to disseminate accurate notions of Astronomy both among\r\nliterary men and among general society.\r\n\r\nWhen Bailly declared, in the beginning of his book, that he would go\r\nback to the very commencement of Astronomy, the reader might expect some\r\npages of pure imagination. I know not, however, whether any body would\r\nhave expected a chapter of the first volume to be entitled, _Of\r\nAntediluvian Astronomy_.\r\n\r\nThe principal conclusion to which Bailly comes, after an attentive\r\nexamination of all the positive ideas that antiquity has bequeathed to\r\nus is, that we find rather the ruins than the elements of a science in\r\nthe most ancient Astronomy of Chaldæa, of India, and of China.\r\n\r\nAfter treating of certain ideas of Pluche, Bailly says, \"The country of\r\npossibilities is immense, and although truth is contained therein, it is\r\nnot often easy to distinguish it.\"\r\n\r\nWords so reasonable would authorize me to inquire whether the\r\ncalculations of our fellow-labourer, intended to establish the immense\r\nantiquity of the Indian Tables, are beyond all criticism. But the\r\nquestion has been sufficiently discussed in a passage of _The Exposition\r\nof the System of the World_, on which it would be useless to insist\r\nhere. Whatever came from the pen of M. de Laplace was always marked by\r\nthe stamp of reason and of evidence. In the first lines of his\r\nmagnificent work, after having remarked that \"the history of Astronomy\r\nforms an essential part of the history of the human mind,\" Bailly\r\nobserves, \"that it is perhaps the true measure of man's intelligence,\r\nand a proof of what he can do with time and genius.\" I shall allow\r\nmyself to add, that no study offers to reflecting minds more striking or\r\nmore curious relations.\r\n\r\nWhen by measurements, in which the evidence of the method advances\r\nequally with the precision of the results, the volume of the earth is\r\nreduced to the millionth part of the volume of the sun; when the sun\r\nhimself, transported to the region of the stars, takes up a very modest\r\nplace among the thousands of millions of those bodies that the telescope\r\nhas revealed to us; when the 38,000,000 of leagues which separate the\r\nearth from the sun, have become, by reason of their comparative\r\nsmallness, a base totally insufficient for ascertaining the dimensions\r\nof the visible universe; when even the swiftness of the luminous rays\r\n(77,000 leagues per second) barely suffices for the common valuations of\r\nscience; when, in short, by a chain of irresistible proofs, certain\r\nstars have retired to distances that light could not traverse in less\r\nthan a million of years; we feel as if annihilated by such immensities.\r\nIn assigning to man, and to the planet that he inhabits, so small a\r\nposition in the material world, Astronomy seems really to have made\r\nprogress only to humble us.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the other hand, we regard the subject from the opposite\r\npoint of view, and reflect on the extreme feebleness of the natural\r\nmeans by the help of which so many great problems have been attacked and\r\nsolved; if we consider that to obtain and measure the greater part of\r\nthe quantities now forming the basis of astronomical computation, man\r\nhas had greatly to improve the most delicate of his organs, to add\r\nimmensely to the power of his eye; if we remark that it was not less\r\nrequisite for him to discover methods adapted to measuring very long\r\nintervals of time, up to the precision of tenths of seconds; to combat\r\nagainst the most microscopic effects that constant variations of\r\ntemperature produce in metals, and therefore in all instruments; to\r\nguard against the innumerable illusions that a cold or hot atmosphere,\r\ndry or humid, tranquil or agitated, impresses on the medium through\r\nwhich the observations have inevitably to be made; the feeble being\r\nresumes all his advantage; by the side of such wonderful labours of the\r\nmind, what signifies the weakness, the fragility of our body; what\r\nsignify the dimensions of the planet, our residence, the grain of sand\r\non which it has happened to us to appear for a few moments!\r\n\r\nThe thousands of questions on which Astronomy has thrown its dazzling\r\nlight belong to two entirely distinct categories; some offered\r\nthemselves naturally to the mind, and man had only to seek the means for\r\nsolving them; others, according to the beautiful expression of Pliny,\r\nwere enveloped in the majesty of nature! When Bailly lays down in his\r\nbook these two kinds of problems, it is with the firmness, the depth, of\r\na consummate astronomer; and when he shows their importance, their\r\nimmensity, it is always with the talent of a writer of the highest\r\norder; it is sometimes with a bewitching eloquence. If in the beautiful\r\nwork we are alluding to, Astronomy unavoidably assigns to man an\r\nimperceptible place in the material world, she assigns him, on the other\r\nhand, a vast share in the intellectual world. The writings which,\r\nsupported by the invincible deductions of science, thus elevate man in\r\nhis own eyes, will find grateful readers in all climes and times.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Bailly sent the first volume of his history to Voltaire. In\r\nthanking him for his present, the illustrious old man addressed to the\r\nauthor one of those letters that he alone could write, in which\r\nflattering and enlivening sentences were combined without effort with\r\nhigh reasoning powers. \"I have many thanks to return you, (said the\r\nPatriarch of Ferney,) for having on the same day received a large book\r\non medicine and yours, while I was still ill; I have not opened the\r\nfirst, I have already read the second almost entirely, and feel better.\"\r\n\r\nVoltaire, indeed, had read Bailly's work pen in hand, and he proposed to\r\nthe illustrious astronomer some queries, which proved both his infinite\r\nperspicacity, and wonderful variety of knowledge. Bailly then felt the\r\nnecessity of developing some ideas which in his _History of Ancient\r\nAstronomy_ were only accessories to his principal subject. This was the\r\nobject of the volume that he published in 1776, under the title of\r\n_Letters on the Origin of the Sciences and of the People of Asia,\r\naddressed to M. de Voltaire_. The author modestly announced that \"to\r\nlead the reader by the interest of the style to the interest of the\r\nquestion discussed,\" he would place at the head of his work three\r\nletters from the author of _Merope_, and he protested against the idea\r\nthat he had been induced to play with paradoxes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bailly, the present nations of Asia are heirs of an\r\nanterior people, who understood Astronomy perfectly. Those Chinese,\r\nthose Hindoos, so renowned for their learning, would thus have been mere\r\ndepositaries; we should have to deprive them of the title of inventors.\r\nCertain astronomical facts, found in the annals of those southern\r\nnations, appear to have belonged to a higher latitude. By these means we\r\ndiscover the true site on the globe of the primitive people, proving\r\nagainst the received opinion that learning came southward from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nBailly also found that the ancient fables, considered physically,\r\nappeared to belong to the northern regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, Bailly published a second collection, forming a sequel to the\r\nformer, and entitled _Letters on the Atlantis of Plato, and on the\r\nAncient History of Asia_.\r\n\r\nVoltaire died before these new letters could be communicated to him.\r\nBailly did not think that this circumstance ought to make him change the\r\nform of the discussion already employed in the former series; it is\r\nstill Voltaire whom he addresses.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher of Ferney thought it strange that there should be no\r\nknowledge of this ancient people, who, according to Bailly, had\r\ninstructed the Indians. To answer this difficulty, the celebrated\r\nastronomer undertakes to prove that some nations have disappeared,\r\nwithout their existence being known to us by any thing beyond tradition.\r\nHe cites five of these, and in the first rank the Atlantidæ.\r\n\r\nAristotle said that he thought Atlantis was a fiction of Plato's: \"He\r\nwho created it also destroyed it, like the walls that Homer built on the\r\nshores of Troy, and then made them disappear.\" Bailly does not join in\r\nthis skepticism. According to him, Plato spoke seriously to the\r\nAthenians of a learned, polished people, but destroyed and forgotten.\r\nOnly, he totally repudiates the idea of the Canaries being the remains\r\nof the ancient country of the Atlantidæ, and now engulfed. Bailly rather\r\nplaces that nation at Spitzbergen, Greenland, or Nova Zembla, whose\r\nclimate may have changed. We should also have to seek for the Garden of\r\nthe Hesperides near the Pole; in short, the fable of the Phoenix may\r\nhave arisen in the Gulf of the Obi, in a region where we must suppose\r\nthe sun to have been annually absent during sixty-five days.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, in many passages, that Bailly is himself surprised at the\r\nsingularity of his own conclusions, and fears that his readers may\r\nrather regard them as jokes. He therefore exclaims, \"My pen would not\r\nfind expressions for thoughts which I did not believe to be true.\" Let\r\nus add that no effort is painful to him. Bailly calls successively to\r\nhis aid astronomy, history, supported by vast erudition, philology, the\r\nsystems of Mairan, of Buffon, relatively to the heat appertaining to the\r\nearth. He does not forget, using his own words, \"that in the human\r\nspecies, still more sensitive than curious, more anxious for pleasure\r\nthan for instruction, nothing pleases generally, or for a long time,\r\nunless the style is agreeable; that dry truth is killed by ennui!\" Yet\r\nBailly makes few proselytes; and a species of instinct determines men of\r\nscience to despise the fruits of so persevering a labour; and D'Alembert\r\ngoes so far as to tax them with poverty, even with hollow ideas, with\r\nvain and ridiculous efforts; he goes so far as to call Bailly,\r\nrelatively to his letters, the _illuminated brother_. Voltaire is, on\r\nthe contrary, very polite and very academical in his communications with\r\nour author. The renown of the Brahmins is dear to him; yet this does\r\nnot prevent his discussing closely the proofs, the arguments of the\r\ningenious astronomer. We could also now enter into a serious discussion.\r\nThe mysterious veil that in Bailly's time covered the East, is in great\r\npart raised. We now know the Astronomy of the Chinese and the Hindoos in\r\nall its detail. We know up to what point the latter had carried their\r\nmathematical knowledge. The theory of central heat has in a few years\r\nmade an unhoped-for progress; in short, comparative philology,\r\nprodigiously extended by the invaluable labours of Sacy, Rémusat,\r\nQuatremère, Burnouf, and Stanislaus Julien, have thrown strong lights on\r\nsome historical and geographical questions, where there reigned before a\r\nprofound darkness. Armed with all these new means of investigation, it\r\nmight easily be established that the systems relative to an ancient\r\nunknown people, first creator of all the sciences, and relative to the\r\nAtlantidæ, rest on foundations devoid of solidity. Yet, if Bailly still\r\nlived, we should be only just in saying to him, as Voltaire did, merely\r\nchanging the tense of a verb, \"Your two books _were_, Sir, treasures of\r\nthe most profound erudition and the most ingenious conjectures, adorned\r\nwith an eloquence of style, which is always suitable to the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INTERVIEW OF BAILLY WITH FRANKLIN.--HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE FRENCH\r\nACADEMY IN 1783.--HIS RECEPTION.--DISCOURSE.--HIS RUPTURE WITH BUFFON.\r\n\r\nBailly became the particular and intimate friend of Franklin at the end\r\nof 1777. The personal acquaintance of these two distinguished men began\r\nin the strangest manner.\r\n\r\nOne of the most illustrious members of the Institute, Volney, on\r\nreturning from the New World, said: \"The Anglo-Americans tax the French\r\nwith lightness, with indiscretion, with chattering.\" (Volney, preface to\r\n_The Table of the Climate of the United States_.) Such is the\r\nimpression, in my opinion very erroneous, at least by comparison, under\r\nwhich the Ambassador Franklin arrived in France. All the world knows\r\nthat he halted at Chaillot. As an inhabitant of the Commune, Bailly\r\nthought it his duty to visit without delay the illustrious guest thus\r\nreceived. He was announced, and Franklin, knowing him by reputation,\r\nwelcomed him very cordially, and exchanged with his visitor the eight or\r\nten words usual on such occasions. Bailly seated himself by the American\r\nphilosopher, and discreetly awaited some question to be put to him. Half\r\nan hour passed, and Franklin had not opened his mouth. Bailly drew out\r\nhis snuff-box, and presented it to his neighbour without a word; the\r\ntraveller signed with his hand that he did not take snuff. The dumb\r\ninterview was then prolonged during a whole hour. Bailly finally rose.\r\nThen Franklin, as if delighted to have found a Frenchman who could\r\nremain silent, extended his hand to him, pressed his visitor's\r\naffectionately, exclaiming: \"Very well, Monsr. Bailly, very well!\"\r\n\r\nAfter having recounted the anecdote as our academician used amusingly to\r\nrelate it, I really fear being asked how I look upon it. Well,\r\nGentlemen, whenever this question may be put to me, I shall answer that\r\nBailly and Franklin discussing together some scientific question from\r\nthe moment of their meeting, would have appeared to me much more worthy\r\nof each other, than the two actors of the scene at Chaillot. I will,\r\nmoreover, grant that we may draw the following inference,--that even men\r\nof genius are liable to cross humours; but I must at the same time add\r\nthat the example is not dangerous, dumbness not being an efficacious\r\nmethod of making one's self valued, or of distinguishing ourselves to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nBailly was nominated member of the French Academy in the place of M. de\r\nTressan, in November, 1783. The same day, M. de Choiseul Gouffier\r\nsucceeded to D'Alembert. Thanks to the coincidence of the two\r\nnominations, Bailly escaped the sarcasms which the expectant\r\nacademicians never fail to pour out, with or without reason, against\r\nthose who have obtained a double crown. This time they vented their\r\nspleen exclusively on the great man, thus enabling the astronomer to\r\ntake possession of his new dignity without raising the usual storm. Let\r\nus carefully collect, Gentlemen, from the early years of our\r\nacademician's life, all that may appear an anticipated compensation for\r\nthe cruel trials that we shall have to relate in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the eloquent author of the _History of Astronomy_ into\r\nthe Academy, was more difficult than could be supposed by those who have\r\nremarked to what slight works certain early and recent writers have owed\r\nthe same favour. Bailly failed three times. Fontenelle had before him\r\nunsuccessfully presented himself once oftener; but Fontenelle underwent\r\nthese successive checks without ill-humour, and without being\r\ndiscouraged. Bailly, on the contrary, with or without reason, seeing in\r\nthese unfavourable results of the elections the immediate effect of\r\nD'Alembert's enmity, showed himself much more hurt at it, perhaps, than\r\nwas suitable for a philosopher. In these somewhat envenomed contests,\r\nBuffon always gave Bailly a cordial and able support.\r\n\r\nBailly pronounced his reception-discourse in February, 1784. The merits\r\nof M. de Tressan were therein celebrated with grace and delicacy. The\r\npanegyrist identified himself with his subject. A select public loaded\r\nwith praises various passages wherein just and profound ideas were\r\nclothed in all the richness of a forcible and harmonious style.\r\n\r\nDid any one ever speak with more eloquence of the scientific power\r\nrevealed by a contemporary discovery! Listen, Gentlemen, and judge.\r\n\r\n\"That which the sciences can add to the privileges of the human race has\r\nnever been more marked than at the present moment. They have acquired\r\nnew domains for man. The air seems to become as accessible to him as the\r\nwaters, and the boldness of his enterprises equals almost the boldness\r\nof his thoughts. The name of Montgolfier, the names of those hardy\r\nnavigators of the new element, will live through time; but who among us,\r\non seeing these superb experiments, has not felt his soul elevated, his\r\nideas expanded, his mind enlarged?\"\r\n\r\nI know not whether, all things considered, the satisfaction of self-love\r\nwhich may be attached to academical titles, to his success in public and\r\nimportant meetings, ever completely rewarded Bailly for the heartaches\r\nhe experienced in his literary career.\r\n\r\nA kind and tender intimacy had grown up between the great naturalist\r\nBuffon and the celebrated astronomer. An academical nomination broke it\r\nup. You know it, Gentlemen; amongst us a nomination is the apple of\r\ndiscord; notwithstanding the most opposite views, every one then thinks\r\nthat he is acting for the true interest of science or of letters; every\r\none thinks that he is proceeding in the line of strict justice; every\r\none endeavours earnestly to make proselytes. So far all is legitimate.\r\nBut what is much less so, is forgetting that a vote is a decision, and\r\nthat in this sense the academician, like the magistrate, may say to the\r\nsuitor, whether an academician or not, \"I give decrees, and not\r\nservices.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, considerations of this sort, notwithstanding their\r\njustice, would make but little impression on the haughty and positive\r\nmind of Buffon. That great naturalist wished to have the Abbé Maury\r\nnominated; his associate Bailly thought he ought to vote for Sedaine.\r\nLet us place ourselves in the ordinary course of things, and it will\r\nappear difficult to see in this discordancy a sufficient cause for a\r\nrupture between two superior men. _The Unforeseen Wager_ and _The\r\nUnconscious Philosopher_, considerably balanced the, then very light,\r\nweight of Maury. The comic poet had already reached his sixty-sixth\r\nyear; the Abbé was young. The high character, the irreproachable conduct\r\nof Sedaine, might, without disparagement, be put in comparison with what\r\nthe public knew of the character of the official and the private life of\r\nthe future cardinal. Whence then had the illustrious naturalist derived\r\nsuch a great affection for Maury, such violent antipathies against\r\nSedaine? It may be surmised that they arose from aristocratic prejudices\r\nof rank. Nor is it impossible but that M. le Comte de Buffon\r\ninstinctively foresaw, with some repugnance, his approaching\r\nconfraternity with a man formerly a lapidary; but was not Maury the son\r\nof a shoemaker? This very small incident of our literary history seemed\r\ndoomed to remain in obscurity; chance has, I believe, given me the key\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nYou remember, Gentlemen, that aphorism continually quoted by Buffon, and\r\nof which he seemed very proud,--\r\n\r\n     \"Style makes the man.\"\r\n\r\nI have discovered that Sedaine made a counterpart of it. The author of\r\n_Richard Coeur de Lion_ and of _The Deserter_ said,--\r\n\r\n     \"Style is nothing, or next to it!\"\r\n\r\nPlace this heresy, in imagination, under the eyes of the immortal\r\nwriter, whose days and nights were passed in polishing his style, and if\r\nyou then ask me why he detested Sedaine, I shall have a right to answer:\r\nYou do not know the human heart.\r\n\r\nBailly firmly resisted the imperious solicitations of his former patron,\r\nand refused even to absent himself from the Academy on the day of the\r\nnomination. He did not hesitate to sacrifice the attractions and\r\nadvantages of an illustrious friendship to the performance of a duty; he\r\nanswered to him who wanted to be master, \"I will be free.\" Honour be to\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nThe example of Bailly warns timid men never to listen to mere\r\nentreaties, whatever may be their source; not to yield but to good\r\narguments. Those who have thought so little of their own tranquillity as\r\nto do any more in academical elections than to give a silent and secret\r\nvote, will see on their part, in the noble and painful resistance of an\r\nhonest man, how culpable they become in trying to substitute authority\r\nfor persuasion, in wishing to subject conscience to gratitude.\r\n\r\nOn the occurrence of a similar discord, the astronomer Lemonnier, of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences, said one day to Lalande, his fellow-academician and\r\nformer pupil, \"I enjoin you not to put your foot again within my door\r\nduring the semi-revolution of the lunar orbital nodes.\" Calculation\r\nshows this to be nine years. Lalande submitted to the punishment with a\r\ntruly astronomical punctuality; but the public, despite the scientific\r\nform of the sentence, thought it excessively severe. What then will be\r\nsaid of that which was pronounced by Buffon?--\"We will never see each\r\nother more, Sir!\" These words will appear at once both harsh and solemn,\r\nfor they were occasioned by a difference of opinion on the comparative\r\nmerits of Sedaine and the Abbé Maury. Our friend resigned himself to\r\nthis separation, nor ever allowed his just resentment to be perceived. I\r\nmay even remark, that after this brutal disruption he showed himself\r\nmore attentive than ever to seize opportunities of paying a legitimate\r\nhomage to the talents and eloquence of the French Pliny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT ON ANIMAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nWe are now going to see the astronomer, the savant, the man of letters,\r\nstruggling against passions of every kind, excited by the famous\r\nquestion of animal magnetism.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1778, a German doctor established himself\r\nat Paris. This physician could not fail of succeeding in what was then\r\nstyled high society. He was a stranger. His government had expelled him;\r\nacts of the greatest effrontery and unexampled charlatanism were imputed\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHis success, however, exceeded all expectations. The Gluckists and the\r\nPiccinists themselves forgot their differences, to occupy themselves\r\nexclusively with the new comer.\r\n\r\nMesmer, since we must call him by his name, pretended to have discovered\r\nan agent till then totally unknown both in the arts and in physics; an\r\nuniversally distributed fluid, and serving thus as a means of\r\ncommunication and of influence among the celestial globes;--a fluid\r\ncapable of flux and reflux, which introduced itself more or less\r\nabundantly into the substance of the nerves, and acted on them in a\r\nuseful manner,--thence the name of animal magnetism given to this fluid.\r\n\r\nMesmer said: \"Animal magnetism may be accumulated, concentrated,\r\ntransported, without the aid of any intermediate body. It is reflected\r\nlike light; musical sounds propagate and augment it.\"\r\n\r\nProperties so distinct, so precise, seemed as if they must be capable of\r\nexperimental verification. It was requisite, then, to be prepared for\r\nsome instance of want of success, and Mesmer took good care not to\r\nneglect it. The following was his declaration: \"Although the fluid be\r\nuniversal, all animated bodies do not equally assimilate it into\r\nthemselves; there are some even, though very few in number, that by\r\ntheir very presence destroy the effects of this fluid in the surrounding\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\nSo soon as this was admitted, as soon it was allowed to explain\r\ninstances of non-success by the presence of neutralizing bodies, Mesmer\r\nno longer ran any risk of being embarrassed. Nothing prevented his\r\nannouncing, in full security, \"that animal magnetism could immediately\r\ncure diseases of the nerves, and mediately other diseases; that it\r\nafforded to doctors the means of judging with certainty of the origin,\r\nthe nature, and the progress of the most complicated maladies; that\r\nnature, in short, offered in magnetism a universal means of curing and\r\npreserving mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBefore quitting Vienna, Mesmer had communicated his systematic notions\r\nto the principal learned societies of Europe. The Academy of Sciences at\r\nParis, and the Royal Society of London, did not think proper to answer.\r\nThe Academy of Berlin examined the work, and wrote to Mesmer that he was\r\nin error.\r\n\r\nSome time after his arrival in Paris, Mesmer tried again to get into\r\ncommunication with the Academy of Sciences. This society even acceded to\r\na rendezvous. But, instead of the empty words that were offered them,\r\nthe academicians required experiments. Mesmer stated--I quote his\r\nwords--that _it was child's play_; and the conference had no other\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of Medicine, being called upon to judge of the\r\npretended cures performed by the Austrian doctor, thought that their\r\nagents could not give a well-founded opinion \"without having first duly\r\nexamined the patients to ascertain their state.\" Mesmer rejected this\r\nnatural and reasonable proposal. He wished that the agents should be\r\ncontent with the word of honour and attestations of the patients. In\r\nthis respect, also, the severe letters of the worthy Vicq-d'Azyr put an\r\nend to communications which must have ended unsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of medicine showed, we think, less wisdom. It refused to\r\nexamine any thing; it even proceeded in legal form against one of its\r\nregent doctors who had associated himself, they said, with the\r\ncharlatanism of Mesmer.\r\n\r\nThese barren debates evidently proved that Mesmer himself was not\r\nthoroughly sure of his theory, nor of the efficacy of the means of cure\r\nthat he employed. Still the public showed itself blind. The infatuation\r\nbecame extreme. French society appeared at one moment divided into\r\nmagnetizers and magnetized. From one end of the kingdom to the other\r\nagents of Mesmer were seen, who, with receipt in hand, put the weak in\r\nintellect under contribution.\r\n\r\nThe magnetizers had had the address to intimate that the mesmeric crises\r\nmanifested themselves only in persons endowed with a certain\r\nsensitiveness. From that moment, in order not to be ranged among the\r\ninsensible, both men and women, when near the _rod_, assumed the\r\nappearance of epileptics.\r\n\r\nWas not Father Hervier really in one of those paroxysms of the disease\r\nwhen he wrote, \"If Mesmer had lived contemporary with Descartes and\r\nNewton, he would have saved them much labour: those great men suspected\r\nthe existence of the universal fluid; Mesmer has discovered the laws of\r\nits action\"?\r\n\r\nCount de Gébelin showed himself stranger still. The new doctrine would\r\nnaturally seduce him by its connection with some of the mysterious\r\npractices of ancient times; but the author of _The Primitive World_ did\r\nnot content himself with writing in favour of Mesmerism with the\r\nenthusiasm of an apostle. Frightful pain, violent griefs, rendered life\r\ninsupportable to him; Gébelin saw death approaching with satisfaction,\r\nso from that moment he begged earnestly that he might not be carried to\r\nMesmer's, where assuredly \"he could not die.\" We must just mention,\r\nhowever, that his request was not attended to; he was carried to\r\nMesmer's, and died while he was being magnetized.\r\n\r\nPainting, sculpture, and engraving were constantly repeating the\r\nfeatures of this Thaumaturgus. Poets wrote verses to be inscribed on the\r\npedestals of the busts, or below the portraits. Those by Palisot deserve\r\nto be quoted, as one of the most curious examples of poetic licences:--\r\n\r\n     \"Behold that man--the glory of his age!\r\n     Whose art can all Pandora's ills assuage.\r\n     In skill and tact no rival pow'r is known--\r\n     E'en Greece, in him, would Esculapius own.\"[7]\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm having thus gone to the last limits in verse, enthusiasm had\r\nbut one way left to become remarkable in prose: that is, violence. Is it\r\nnot thus that we must characterize the words of Bergasse?--\"The\r\nadversaries of animal magnetism are men who must one day be doomed to\r\nthe execration of all time, and to the punishment of the avenging\r\ncontempt of posterity.\"\r\n\r\nIt is rare for violent words not to be followed by violent acts. Here\r\nevery thing proceeded according to the natural course of human events.\r\nWe know, indeed, that some furious admirers of Mesmer attempted to\r\nsuffocate Berthollet in the corner of one of the rooms of the Palais\r\nRoyal, for having honestly said that the scenes he had witnessed did not\r\nappear to him demonstrative. We have this anecdote from Berthollet\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of the German doctor increased with the number of his\r\nadherents. To induce him to permit only three learned men to attend his\r\nmeetings, M. de Maurepas offered him, in the name of the king, 20,000\r\nfrancs a year for life, and 10,000 annually for house-rent. Yet Mesmer\r\ndid not accept this offer, but demanded, as a national recompense, one\r\nof the most beautiful châteaux in the environs of Paris, together with\r\nall its territorial dependencies.\r\n\r\nIrritated at finding his claims repulsed, Mesmer quitted France,\r\nangrily vowing her to the deluge of maladies from which it would have\r\nbeen in his power to save her. In a letter written to Marie Antoinette,\r\nthe Thaumaturgus declared that he had refused the government offers\r\nthrough austerity.\r\n\r\nThrough austerity!!! Are we then to believe that, as it was then\r\npretended, Mesmer was entirely ignorant of the French language; that in\r\nthis respect his meditations had been exclusively centered on the\r\ncelebrated verse--\r\n\r\n     \"Fools are here below for our amusement?\"[8]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the austerity of Mesmer did not prevent his being\r\nmost violently angry when he learnt at Spa that Deslon continued the\r\nmagnetical treatments at Paris. He returned in all haste. His partisans\r\nreceived him with enthusiasm, and set on foot a subscription of 100\r\nlouis per head, which produced immediately near 400,000 francs,\r\n(16,000_l._) We now feel some surprise to see, among the names of the\r\nsubscribers, those of Messrs. de Lafayette, de Ségur, d'Eprémesnil.\r\n\r\nMesmer quitted France a second time about the end of 1781, in quest of a\r\nmore enlightened government, who could appreciate superior minds. He\r\nleft behind him a great number of tenacious and ardent adepts, whose\r\nimportunate conduct at last determined the government to submit the\r\npretended magnetic discoveries to be examined by four Doctors of the\r\nFaculty of Paris. These distinguished physicians solicited to have added\r\nto them some members of the Academy of Sciences. M. de Breteuil then\r\nrecommended Messrs. Le Roy, Bory, Lavoisier, Franklin, and Bailly, to\r\nform part of the mixed commission. Bailly was finally named reporter.\r\n\r\nThe work of our brother-academician appeared in August, 1784. Never was\r\na complex question reduced to its characteristic traits with more\r\npenetration and tact; never did more moderation preside at an\r\nexamination, though personal passions seemed to render it impossible;\r\nnever was a scientific subject treated in a more dignified and lucid\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nNothing equals the credulity of men in whatever touches their health.\r\nThis aphorism is an eternal truth. It explains how a portion of the\r\npublic has returned to mesmeric practices; how I shall still perform an\r\ninteresting task by giving a detailed analysis of the magnificent\r\nlabours published by our fellow-academician sixty years ago. This\r\nanalysis will show, besides, how daring those men were, who recently, in\r\nthe bosom of another academy, constituted themselves passionate\r\ndefenders of some old women's tales, which one would have supposed had\r\nbeen permanently buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners go in the first place to the treatment by M. Deslon,\r\nexamine the famous rod, describe it carefully, relate the means adopted\r\nto excite and direct magnetism. Bailly then draws out a varied and truly\r\nextraordinary table of the state of the sick people. His attention is\r\nprincipally attracted by the convulsions that they designated by the\r\nname of _crisis_. He remarked that in the number of persons in the\r\ncrisis state, there were always a great many women, and very few men; he\r\ndoes not imagine any deceit, however; holds the phenomena as\r\nestablished, and passes on to search out their causes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mesmer and his partisans, the cause of the crisis and of\r\nthe less characteristic effects, resided in a particular fluid. It was\r\nto search out proofs of the existence of this fluid, that the\r\ncommissioners had first to devote their efforts. Indeed, Bailly said,\r\n\"Animal magnetism may exist without being useful, but it cannot be\r\nuseful if it does not exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe animal magnetic fluid is not luminous and visible, like electricity;\r\nit does not produce marked and manifest effects on inert matter, as the\r\nfluid of the ordinary magnet does; finally, it has no taste. Some\r\nmagnetizers asserted that it had a smell; but repeated experiments\r\nproved that they were in error. The existence, then, of the pretended\r\nfluid, could be established only by its effects on animated beings.\r\n\r\nCurative effects would have thrown the commission into an inextricable\r\ndædalus, because nature alone, without any treatment, cures many\r\nmaladies. In this system of observations, they could not have hoped to\r\nlearn the exact part performed by magnetism, until after a great number\r\nof cures, and after trials oftentimes repeated.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, therefore, had to limit themselves to instantaneous\r\neffects of the fluid on the animal organism.\r\n\r\nThey then submitted themselves to the experiments, but using an\r\nimportant precaution. \"There is no individual,\" says Bailly, \"in the\r\nbest state of health, who, if he closely attended to himself, would not\r\nfeel within him an infinity of movements and variations, either of\r\nexceedingly slight pain, or of heat, in the various parts of his\r\nbody.... These variations, which are continually taking place, are\r\nindependent of magnetism.... The first care required of the\r\ncommissioners was, not to be too attentive to what was passing within\r\nthem. If magnetism is a real and powerful cause, we have no need to\r\nthink about it to make it act and manifest itself; it must, so to say,\r\nforce the attention, and make itself perceived by even a purposely\r\ndistracted mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, magnetized by Deslon, felt no effect. After the\r\nhealthy people, some ailing ones followed, taken of all ages, and from\r\nvarious classes of society. Among these sick people, who amounted to\r\nfourteen, five felt some effects. On the remaining nine, magnetism had\r\nno effect whatever.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the pompous announcements, magnetism already could no\r\nlonger be considered as a certain indicator of diseases.\r\n\r\nHere the reporter made a capital remark: magnetism appeared to have no\r\neffect on incredulous persons who had submitted to the trials, nor on\r\nchildren. Was it not allowable to think, that the effects obtained in\r\nthe others proceeded from a previous persuasion as to the efficacy of\r\nthe means, and that they might be attributed to the influence of\r\nimagination? Thence arose another system of experiments. It was\r\ndesirable to confirm or to destroy this suspicion; \"it became therefore\r\nrequisite to ascertain to what degree imagination influences our\r\nsensations, and to establish whether it could have been in part or\r\nentirely the cause of the effects attributed to magnetism.\"\r\n\r\nThere could be nothing neater or more demonstrative than this portion of\r\nthe work of the commissioners. They go first to Dr. Jumelin, who, let it\r\nbe observed, obtains the same effects, the same crises as Deslon and\r\nMesmer, by magnetizing according to an entirely different method, and\r\nnot restricting himself to any distinction of poles; they select persons\r\nwho seem to feel the magnetic action most forcibly, and put their\r\nimagination at fault by now and then bandaging their eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat happens then?\r\n\r\nWhen the patients see, the seat of the sensations is exactly the part\r\nthat is magnetized; when their eyes are bandaged, they locate these same\r\nsensations by chance, sometimes in parts very far away from those to\r\nwhich the magnetizer is directing his attention. The patient, whose eyes\r\nare covered, often feels marked effects at a time when they are not\r\nmagnetizing him, and remains, on the contrary, quite passive while they\r\nare magnetizing him, without his being aware of it.\r\n\r\nPersons of all classes offer similar anomalies. An instructed physician,\r\nsubjected to these experiments, \"feels effects whilst nothing is being\r\ndone, and often does not feel effects while he is being acted upon. On\r\none occasion, thinking that they had been magnetizing him for ten\r\nminutes, this same doctor fancied that he felt a heat in his lumbi,\r\nwhich he compared to that of a stove.\"\r\n\r\nSensations thus felt, when no magnetizing was exerted, must evidently\r\nhave been the effect of imagination.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners were too strict logicians to confine themselves with\r\nthese experiments. They had established that imagination, in some\r\nindividuals, can occasion pain, and heat--even a considerable degree of\r\nheat--in all parts of the body; but practical female Mesmerizers did\r\nmore; they agitated certain people to that pitch, that they fell into\r\nconvulsions. Could the effect of imagination go so far?\r\n\r\nSome new experiments entirely did away with these doubts.\r\n\r\nA young man was taken to Franklin's garden at Passy, and when it was\r\nannounced to him that Deslon, who had taken him there, had magnetized a\r\ntree, this young man ran about the garden, and fell down in convulsions,\r\nbut it was not under the magnetized tree: the crisis seized him while\r\nhe was embracing another tree, very far from the former.\r\n\r\nDeslon selected, in the treatment of poor people, two women who had\r\nrendered themselves remarkable by their sensitiveness around the famous\r\nrod, and took them to Passy. These women fell into convulsions whenever\r\nthey thought themselves mesmerized, although they were not. At\r\nLavoisier's, the celebrated experiment of the cup gave analogous\r\nresults. Some plain water engendered convulsions occasionally, when\r\nmagnetized water did not.\r\n\r\nWe must really renounce the use of our reason, not to perceive a proof\r\nin this collection of experiments, so well arranged that imagination\r\nalone can produce all the phenomena observed around the mesmeric rod,\r\nand that mesmeric proceedings, cleared from the delusions of\r\nimagination, are absolutely without effect. The commissioners, however,\r\nrecommence the examination on these last grounds, multiply the trials,\r\nadopt all possible precautions, and give to their conclusions the\r\nevidence of mathematical demonstrations. They establish, finally and\r\nexperimentally, that the action of the imagination can both occasion the\r\ncrises to cease, and can engender their occurrence.\r\n\r\nForeseeing that people with an inert or idle mind would be astonished at\r\nthe important part assigned to the imagination by the commissioners'\r\nexperiments in the production of mesmeric phenomena, Bailly instanced:\r\nsudden affection disturbing the digestive organs; grief giving the\r\njaundice; the fear of fire restoring the use of their legs to paralytic\r\npatients; earnest attention stopping the hiccough; fright blanching\r\npeople's hair in an instant, &c.\r\n\r\nThe touching or stroking practised in mesmeric treatments, as\r\nauxiliaries of magnetism, properly so called, required no direct\r\nexperiments, since the principal agent,--since magnetism itself, had\r\ndisappeared. Bailly, therefore, confined himself, in this respect, to\r\nanatomical and physiological considerations, remarkable for their\r\nclearness and precision. We read, also, with a lively interest, in his\r\nreport, some ingenious reflections on the effects of imitation in those\r\nassemblages of magnetized people. Bailly compares them to those of\r\ntheatrical representations. He says: \"Observe how much stronger the\r\nimpressions are when there are a great many spectators, and especially\r\nin places where there is the liberty of applauding. This sign of\r\nparticular emotions produces a general emotion, participated in by\r\neverybody according to their respective susceptibility. This is also\r\nobserved in armies on the day of battle, when the enthusiasm of courage,\r\nas well as panic-terrors, propagate themselves with so much rapidity.\r\nThe sound of the drum and of military music, the noise of the cannon, of\r\nthe musquetry, the cries, the disorder, stagger the organs, impart the\r\nsame movement to men's minds, and raise their imaginations to a similar\r\ndegree. In this unity of intoxication, an impression once manifested\r\nbecomes universal; it encourages men to charge, or determines men to\r\nfly.\" Some very curious examples of imitation close this portion of\r\nBailly's report.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners finally examined whether these convulsions, occasioned\r\nby the imagination or by magnetism, could be useful in curing or easing\r\nthe suffering persons. The reporter said: \"Undoubtedly, the imagination\r\nof sick people often influences the cure of their maladies very much....\r\nThere are cases in which every thing must first be disordered, to\r\nenable us to restore order ... but the shock must be unique ... whereas\r\nin the public treatment by magnetism ... the habit of the crises cannot\r\nbut be injurious.\"\r\n\r\nThis thought related to the most delicate considerations. It was\r\ndeveloped in a report addressed to the king personally. This report was\r\nto have remained secret, but it was published some years since. It\r\nshould not be regretted; the magnetic treatment, regarded in a certain\r\npoint of view, pleased sick people much; they are now aware of all its\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bailly's report completely upsets an accredited error.\r\nThis was an important service, nor was it the only one. In searching for\r\nthe imaginary cause of animal magnetism, they ascertained the real power\r\nthat man can exert over man, without the immediate and demonstrable\r\nintervention of any physical agent; they established that \"the most\r\nsimple actions and signs sometimes produce most powerful effects; that\r\nman's action on the imagination may be reduced to an art ... at least in\r\nregard to persons who have faith.\" This work finally showed how our\r\nfaculties should be experimentally studied; in what way psychology may\r\none day come to be placed among the exact sciences.\r\n\r\nI have always regretted that the commissioners did not judge it\r\nexpedient to add a historical chapter to their excellent work. The\r\nimmense erudition of Bailly would have given it an inestimable value. I\r\nfigure to myself, also, that in seeing the Mesmeric practices that have\r\nnow been in use during upwards of two thousand years, the public would\r\nhave asked itself whether so long an interval of time had ever been\r\nrequired to push a good and useful thing forward into estimation. By\r\ncircumscribing himself to this point of view, a few traits would have\r\nsufficed.\r\n\r\nPlutarch, for example, would have come to the aid of the reporter. He\r\nwould have showed him Pyrrhus curing complaints of the spleen, by means\r\nof frictions made with the great toe of his right foot. Without giving\r\none's self up to a wild spirit of interpretation, we might be permitted\r\nto see in that fact the germ of animal magnetism. I admit that one\r\ncircumstance would have rather unsettled the savant: this was the white\r\ncock that the King of Macedon sacrificed to the gods before beginning\r\nthese frictions.\r\n\r\nVespasian, in his turn, might have figured among the predecessors of\r\nMesmer, in consequence of the extraordinary cures that he effected in\r\nEgypt by the action of his foot. It is true that the pretended cure of\r\nan old blindness, only by the aid of a little of that emperor's saliva,\r\nwould have thrown some doubt on the veracity of Suetonius.\r\n\r\nHomer and Achilles are not too far back but we might have invoked their\r\nnames. Joachim Camerarius, indeed, asserted having seen, on a very\r\nancient copy of the Iliad, some verses that the copyists sacrificed\r\nbecause they did not understand them, and in which the poet alluded, not\r\nto the heel of Achilles (its celebrity has been well established these\r\nthree thousand years,) but to the medical properties possessed by the\r\ngreat toe of that same hero's right foot.\r\n\r\nWhat I regret most is, the chapter in which Bailly might have related\r\nhow certain adepts of Mesmer's had the hardihood to magnetize the moon,\r\nso as, on a given day, to make all the astronomers devoted to observing\r\nthat body fall into a syncope; a perturbation, by the way, that no\r\ngeometer, from Newton to Laplace, had thought of.\r\n\r\nThe work of Bailly gave rise to trouble, spite, and anger, among the\r\nMesmerists. It was for many months the target for their combined\r\nattacks. All the provinces of France saw refutations of the celebrated\r\nreport arise: sometimes under the form of calm discussions, decent and\r\nmoderate; but generally with all the characteristics of violence, and\r\nthe acrimony of a pamphlet.\r\n\r\nIt would be labour thrown away now to go to the dusty shelves of some\r\nspecial library, to hunt up hundreds of pamphlets, even the titles of\r\nwhich are now completely forgotten. The impartial analysis of that\r\nardent controversy does not call for such labour; I believe at least\r\nthat I shall attain my aim, by concentrating my attention on two or\r\nthree writings which, by the strength of the arguments, the merit of the\r\nstyle, or the reputation of their authors, have left some trace in men's\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nIn the first rank of this category of works we must place the elegant\r\npamphlet published by Servan, under the title of _Doubts of a\r\nProvincial, proposed to the Gentlemen Medical Commissioners commanded by\r\nthe King to examine into Animal Magnetism_.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this little work of Servan's was saluted in the camp\r\nof the Mesmerists with cries of triumph and joy. Undecided minds fell\r\nback into doubt and perplexity. Grimm wrote in Nov. 1784: \"No cause is\r\ndesperate. That of magnetism seemed as if it must fall under the\r\nreiterated attacks of medicine, of philosophy, of experience and of good\r\nsense.... Well, M. Servan, formerly the Attorney-General at Grenoble,\r\nhas been proving that with talent we may recover from any thing, even\r\nfrom ridicule.\"\r\n\r\nServan's pamphlet seemed at the time the anchor of salvation for the\r\nMesmerists. The adepts still borrow from it their principal arguments.\r\nLet us see, then, whether it has really shaken Bailly's report.\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencing lines, the celebrated Attorney-General puts the\r\nquestion in terms deficient in exactness. If we believe him, the\r\ncommissioners were called to establish a parallel between magnetism and\r\nmedicine; \"they were to weigh on both sides the errors and the dangers;\r\nto indicate with wise discernment what it would be desirable to\r\npreserve, and what to retrench, in the two sciences.\" Thus, according to\r\nServan, the sanative art altogether would have been questioned, and the\r\nimpartiality of the physicians might appear suspicious. The clever\r\nmagistrate took care not to forget, on such an occasion, the eternal\r\nmaxim, no one can be both judge and client. Physicians, then, ought to\r\nhave been excepted.\r\n\r\nThere then follows a legitimate homage to the non-graduated\r\nacademicians, members of the commission: \"Before Franklin and Bailly,\"\r\nsays the author, \"every knee must bend. The one has invented much, the\r\nother has discovered much; Franklin belongs to the two worlds, and all\r\nages seem to belong to Bailly.\" But arming himself afterwards with more\r\ncleverness than uprightness, with these words of the reporter, \"The\r\ncommissioners, especially the doctors, made an infinity of experiments,\"\r\nhe insinuates under every form that the commissioners accepted of a very\r\npassive line of conduct. Thus, putting aside the most positive\r\ndeclarations, pretending even to forget the name, the titles of the\r\nreporter, Servan no longer sees before him but one class of adversaries,\r\nregent doctors of the Faculty of Paris, and then he gives full scope to\r\nhis satirical vein. He holds it even as an honour that they do not\r\nregard him as impartial. \"The doctors have killed me; what it has\r\npleased them to leave me of life is not worth, in truth, my seeking a\r\nmilder term.... For these twenty years I have always been worse through\r\nthe remedies administered to me than through my maladies.... Even were\r\nanimal magnetism a chimera, it should be tolerated; it would still be\r\nuseful to mankind, by saving many individuals among them from the\r\nincontestable dangers of vulgar medicine.... I wish that medicine, so\r\nlong accustomed to deceive itself, should still deceive itself now, and\r\nthat the famous report be nothing but a great error....\" Amidst these\r\nsingular declarations, there are hundreds of epigrams still more\r\nremarkable by their ingenious and lively turn than by their novelty. If\r\nit were true, Gentlemen, that the medical corps had ever tried,\r\nknowingly, to impose on the vulgar, to hide the uncertainty of their\r\nknowledge, the weakness of their theories, the vagueness of their\r\nconceptions, under an obscure and pedantic jargon, the immortal and\r\nlaughable sarcasms of Molière would not have been more than an act of\r\nstrict justice. In all cases every thing has its day; now, towards the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, the most delicate, the most thorny points\r\nof doctrine were discussed with an entire good faith, with perfect\r\nlucidity, and in a style that placed many members of the faculty in the\r\nrank Of our best speakers. Servan, however, goes beyond the limits of a\r\nscientific discussion, when, without any sort of excuse, he accuses his\r\nadversaries of being anti-mesmerists through esprit de corps, and, what\r\nis worse, through cupidity.\r\n\r\nServan is more in his element when he points out that the present best\r\nestablished medical theories occasioned at their birth prolonged\r\ndebates; when he reminds us that several medicines have been alternately\r\nproscribed and recommended with vehemence: the author might even have\r\nmore deeply undermined this side of his subject. Instead of some\r\nunmeaning jokes, why did he not show us, for example, in a neighbouring\r\ncountry, two celebrated physicians, Mead and Woodward, deciding, sword\r\nin hand, the quarrel that had arisen between them as to the purgative\r\ntreatment of a patient? We should then have heard Woodward, pierced\r\nthrough and through, rolling on the ground, and drenched in blood, say\r\nto his adversary with an exhausted voice: \"The blow was harsh, but yet I\r\nprefer it to your medicine!\"\r\n\r\nIt is not truth alone that has the privilege of rendering men\r\npassionate. Such was the legitimate result of these retrospective views.\r\nI now ask myself whether, by labouring to put the truth of this aphorism\r\nin full light, the passionate advocate of Mesmerism showed proof of\r\nability!\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let us put all these personal attacks aside, all these\r\nrecriminations against science and its agents, who unfortunately had not\r\nsucceeded in restoring the health of the morose magistrate. What remains\r\nthen of his pamphlet? Two chapters, only two chapters, in which Bailly's\r\nreport is treated seriously. The medical commissioners and the members\r\nof the Academy had not seen, in the real effects of Mesmerism anything\r\nmore than was occasioned by imagination. The celebrated magistrate\r\nexclaims on this subject, \"Any one hearing this proposition spoken of\r\nwould suppose, before reading the report, that the commissioners had\r\ntreated and cured, or considerably relieved by the force of imagination,\r\nlarge tumours, inveterate obstructions, gutta serenas, and strong\r\nparalyses.\" Servan admitted, in short, that magnetism had effected most\r\nwonderful cures. But there lay all the question. The cures being\r\nadmitted, the rest followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nHowever incredible these cures might be, they must be admitted, they\r\nsaid, when numerous witnesses certified their truth. Was it owing to\r\nchance that attestations were wanting for the miracles at the Cemetery\r\nof St. Médard? Did not the counsellor to the parliament, Montgeron,\r\nstate, in three large quarto volumes, the names of a great multitude of\r\nindividuals who protested on their honour as illuminati, that the tomb\r\nof the Deacon, Páris, had restored sight to the blind, hearing to the\r\ndeaf, strength to the paralytic; that in a twinkling it cured ailing\r\npeople of gouty rheumatism, of dropsy, of epilepsy, of phthisis, of\r\nabscesses, of ulcers, &c.? Did these attestations, although many\r\nemanated from persons of distinction, from the Chevalier Folard, for\r\nexample, prevent the convulsionists from becoming the laughingstock of\r\nEurope? Did they not see the Duchess of Maine herself laugh at their\r\nprowess in the following witty couplet?--\r\n\r\n     \"A scavenger at the palace-gate\r\n       Who, his left heel being lame,\r\n     Obtained as a most special grace,\r\n       That his right should ail the same.\"[9]\r\n\r\nWas not government, urged to the utmost, at last obliged to interfere,\r\nwhen the multitude, carrying folly to the extremest bounds, was going to\r\ntry to resuscitate the dead? In short, do we not remember the amusing\r\ndistich, affixed at the time to the gate of the Cemetery of St.\r\nMédard?--\r\n\r\n     \"By royal decree, we prohibit the gods\r\n     To work any miracles near to these sods.\"[10]\r\n\r\nServan must have known better than any one that in regard to testimony,\r\nand in questions of complex facts, quality always carries the day over\r\nmere numbers; let us add, that quality does not result either from\r\ntitles of nobility, or from riches, nor from the social position, nor\r\neven from a certain sort of celebrity. What we must seek for in a\r\nwitness is a calmness of mind and of feeling, a store of knowledge, and\r\na very rare thing, notwithstanding the name it bears, common sense; on\r\nthe other hand, what we must most avoid is the innate taste of some\r\npersons for the extraordinary, the wonderful, the paradoxical. Servan\r\ndid not at all recollect these precepts in the criticism he wrote on\r\nBailly's work.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that the Commissioners of the Academy and of\r\nthe Faculty did not assert that the Mesmeric meetings were always\r\nineffectual. They only saw in the crises the mere results of\r\nimagination; nor did any sort of magnetic fluid reveal itself to their\r\neyes. I will also prove, that imagination alone generated the refutation\r\nthat Servan gave to Bailly's theory. \"You deny,\" exclaims the\r\nattorney-general, \"you deny, gentlemen commissioners, the existence of\r\nthe fluid which Mesmer has made to act such an important part! I\r\nmaintain, on the contrary, not only that this fluid exists, but also\r\nthat it is the medium by the aid of which all the vital functions are\r\nexcited; I assert that imagination is one of the phenomena engendered by\r\nthis agent; that its greater or less abundance in this or that among our\r\norgans, may totally change the normal intellectual state of\r\nindividuals.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody agrees that too great a flow of blood towards the brain\r\nproduces a stupefaction of the mind. Analogous or inverse effects might\r\nevidently be produced by a subtle, invisible, imponderable fluid, by a\r\nsort of nervous fluid, or magnetic fluid (if this term be preferred),\r\ncirculating through our organs. And the commissioners took good care not\r\nto speak on this subject of impossibility. Their thesis was more modest;\r\nthey contented themselves with saying that nothing demonstrated the\r\nexistence of such a fluid. Imagination, therefore, had no share in their\r\nreport; but in Servan's refutation, on the contrary, imagination was the\r\nchief actor.\r\n\r\nOne thing that was still less proved, if possible, than any of those\r\nthat we have been speaking of, is the influence that the magnetic fluid\r\nof the magnetizer might exert on the magnetized person.\r\n\r\nIn magnetism, properly so called, in that which physicists have studied\r\nwith so much care and success, the phenomena are constant. They are\r\nreproduced exactly under the same conditions of form, of duration, and\r\nof quantity, when certain bodies, being present to each other, find\r\nthemselves exactly in the same relative positions. That is the essential\r\nand necessary character of all purely material and mechanical action.\r\nWas it thus in the pretended phenomena of animal magnetism? In no way.\r\nTo-day the crises would occur in the space of some seconds; to-morrow\r\nthey may require several entire hours; and finally, on another day,\r\nother circumstances remaining the same, the effect would be positively\r\nnull. A certain magnetizer exercised a brisk action on a certain\r\npatient, and was absolutely powerless on another who, on the contrary,\r\nentered into a crisis under the earliest efforts of a second magnetizer.\r\nInstead of one or two universal fluids, there must, then, to explain the\r\nphenomena, be as many distinct fluids, and constantly acting, as there\r\nexist animated or inanimate beings in the world.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of such a hypothesis evidently upset Mesmerism from its\r\nvery foundations; yet the illuminati did not judge thus. All bodies\r\nbecame a focus of special emanations, more or less subtle, more or less\r\nabundant, and more or less dissimilar. So far the hypothesis found very\r\nfew contradictors, even among rigorous minds; but soon these individual\r\ncorporeal emanations were endowed, relatively towards those, (without\r\nthe least appearance of proof,) either with a great power of\r\nassimilation, or with a decided antagonism, or with a complete\r\nneutrality; but they pretended to see in these occult qualities the\r\nmaterial causes of the most mysterious affections of the soul. Oh! then\r\ndoubt had a legitimate right to take possession of all those minds that\r\nhad been taught by the strict proceedings of science not to rest\r\nsatisfied with vain words. In the singular system that I have been\r\nexplaining, when Corneille says,--\r\n\r\n     \"There are some secret knots, some sympathies,\r\n     By whose relations sweet assorted souls\r\n     Attach themselves the one to the other....\"[11]\r\n\r\nand when the celebrated Spanish Jesuit Balthazar Gracian spoke of the\r\nnatural relationship of minds and hearts, both the one and the other\r\nalluded, assuredly without suspecting it, to the mixture, penetration,\r\nand easy crossing of two atmospheres.\r\n\r\n\"I love thee not, Sabidus,\" wrote Martial, \"and I know not why; all that\r\nI can tell thee is, that I love thee not.\" Mesmerists would soon have\r\nrelieved the poet from his doubts. If Martial loved not Sabidus, it was\r\nbecause their atmospheres could not intermingle without occasioning a\r\nkind of storm.\r\n\r\nPlutarch informs us that the conqueror of Arminius fainted at the sight\r\nof a cock. Antiquity was astonished at this phenomenon. What could be\r\nmore simple, however? the corporeal emanations of Germanicus and of the\r\ncock exercised a repulsive action the one on the other.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious biographer of Cheronea declares, it is true, that the\r\npresence of the cock was not requisite, that its crowing produced\r\nexactly the same effect on the adopted son of Tiberius. Now, the crowing\r\nmay be heard a long way off; the crowing, then, would seem to possess\r\nthe power of transporting the corporeal emanations of the king of the\r\nlower court with great rapidity through space. The thing may appear\r\ndifficult to believe. As for myself, I think it would be puerile to stop\r\nat such a difficulty; have we not leaped high over other difficulties\r\nfar more embarrassing?\r\n\r\nThe Maréchal d'Albret was still worse off than Germanicus: the\r\natmosphere that made him fall into a syncope exhaled from the head of a\r\nwild boar. A live, complete, whole wild boar produced no effect; but on\r\nperceiving the head of the animal detached from the body, the Maréchal\r\nwas struck as if with lightning. You see, gentlemen, to what sad trials\r\nmilitary men would be exposed, if the Mesmerian theory of atmospheric\r\nconflicts were to regain favour. We ought to be carefully on our guard\r\nagainst a ruse de guerre, of which no one till then had ever\r\nthought,--that is, against cocks, wild boars, &c.,--for through them an\r\narmy might suddenly be deprived of its commander-in-chief. \"It would\r\nalso be requisite not to entrust command,\" Montaigne says, \"to men who\r\nwould fly from apples more than from arquebusades.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not only amongst the corpuscular emanations of living animals that\r\nthe Mesmerists asserted conflicts to occur. They unhesitatingly extended\r\ntheir speculations to dead bodies. Some ancients dreamt that a catgut\r\ncord made of a wolf's intestines would never strike in unison with one\r\nmade from a lamb's intestine; a discord of atmospheres renders the\r\nphenomenon possible. It is still a conflict of corporeal emanations that\r\nexplains the other aphorism of an ancient philosopher: \"The sound of a\r\ndrum made with a wolf's skin takes away all sonorousness from a drum\r\nmade with a lamb's skin.\"\r\n\r\nHere I pause, Gentlemen. Montesquieu said: \"When God created the brains\r\nof human beings, he did not intend to guarantee them.\"\r\n\r\nTo conclude: Servan's witty, piquant, agreeably written pamphlet was\r\nworthy under this triple claim of the reception with which the public\r\nhonoured it; but it did not shake, in any one part, the lucid, majestic,\r\nelegant report by Bailly. The magistrate of Grénoble has said, that in\r\nhis long experience he had met men accustomed to reflect without\r\nlaughing, and other men who only wished to laugh without reflecting.\r\nBailly thought of the first class when he wrote his memorable report.\r\n_The Doubts of the Provincial man_ were destined only for the other\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nIt was also to these light and laughing souls that Servan exclusively\r\naddressed himself some time after, if it be true that the _Queries of\r\nthe young Doctor Rhubarbini de Purgandis_ were written by him.\r\n\r\nRhubarbini de Purgandis sets to work manfully. In his opinion the report\r\nby Franklin, by Lavoisier, by Bailly, is, in the scientific life of\r\nthose learned men, what the _Monades_ were for Leibnitz, the\r\n_Whirlwinds_ for Descartes, the _Commentary on the Apocalypse_ for\r\nNewton. These examples may enable us to judge of the rest, and render\r\nall farther refutation unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBailly's report destroyed root and branch the ideas, the systems, the\r\npractices of Mesmer and of his adepts. Let us add sincerely that we have\r\nno right to appeal to him in regard to modern somnambulism. The greater\r\nportion of the phenomena now grouped around that name were neither known\r\nnor announced in 1783. A magnetizer certainly says the most improbable\r\nthing in the world, when he affirms that a given individual in the state\r\nof somnambulism can see every thing in the most profound darkness, that\r\nhe can read through a wall, and even without the help of his eyes. But\r\nthe improbability of these announcements does not result from the\r\ncelebrated report, for Bailly does not mention such marvels, neither in\r\npraise nor dispraise; he does not say one word about them. The\r\nphysicist, the doctor, the merely curious man who gives himself up to\r\nexperiments in somnambulism, who thinks he must examine whether, in\r\ncertain states of nervous excitement, some individuals are really\r\nendowed with extraordinary faculties; with the faculty, for example, of\r\nreading with their stomach, or with their heel; people who wish to know\r\nexactly up to what point the phenomena so boldly asserted by the\r\nmagnetizers of our epoch may be within the domain of rogues and sharks;\r\nall such people, we say, do not at all deny the authority of the subject\r\nin question, nor do they put themselves really in opposition to the\r\nLavoisiers, the Franklins, or the Baillys; they dive into an entirely\r\nnew world, of which those illustrious learned men did not even suspect\r\nthe existence.\r\n\r\nI cannot approve of the mystery adopted by some grave learned men, who,\r\nin the present day, attend experiments on somnambulism. Doubt is a proof\r\nof diffidence, and has rarely been inimical to the progress of science.\r\nWe could not say the same of incredulity. He who, except in pure\r\nmathematics, pronounces the word _impossible_, is deficient in prudence.\r\nReserve is especially requisite when we treat of animal organization.\r\n\r\nOur senses, notwithstanding twenty-four centuries of study,\r\nobservations, and researches, are far from being an exhausted subject.\r\nTake, for example, the ear. A celebrated natural philosopher, Wollaston,\r\noccupied himself with it; and immediately we learn, that with an equal\r\nsensibility as regards the low notes a certain individual can hear the\r\nhighest tones, whilst another cannot hear them at all; and it becomes\r\nproved that certain men, with perfectly sound organs, never heard the\r\ncricket in the chimney-corner, yet did not doubt but that bats\r\noccasionally utter a piercing cry; and attention being once awakened to\r\nthese singular results, observers have found the most extraordinary\r\ndifferences of sensibility between their right ear and their left ear,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nOur vision offers phenomena not less curious, and an infinitely vaster\r\nfield of research. Experience has proved, for example, that some people\r\nare absolutely blind to certain colours, as red, and enjoy perfect\r\nvision relatively to yellow, to green, and to blue. If the Newtonian\r\ntheory of emission be true, we must irrevocably admit that a ray ceases\r\nto be light as soon as we diminish its velocity by one ten thousandth\r\npart. Thence flow those natural conjectures, which are well worthy of\r\nexperimental examination: all men do not see by the same rays; decided\r\ndifferences may exist in this respect in the same individual during\r\nvarious nervous states; it is possible that the calorific rays, the dark\r\nrays of one person, may be the luminous rays of another person, and\r\nreciprocally; the calorific rays traverse some substances freely, which\r\nare therefore called diathermal, these substances, thus far, had been\r\ncalled opaque, because they transmit no ray commonly called luminous;\r\nnow the words opaque and diathermal have no absolute meaning. The\r\ndiathermals allow those rays to pass through which constitute the light\r\nof one man; and they stop those which constitute the light of another\r\nman. Perhaps in this way the key of many phenomena might be found, that\r\ntill now have remained without any plausible explanation.\r\n\r\nNothing, in the marvels of somnambulism, raised more doubts than an\r\noft-repeated assertion, relative to the power which certain persons are\r\nsaid to possess in a state of crisis, of deciphering a letter at a\r\ndistance with the foot, the nape of the neck, or the stomach. The word\r\n_impossible_ in this instance seemed quite legitimate. Still, I do not\r\ndoubt but some rigid minds would withhold it after having reflected on\r\nthe ingenious experiments by which Moser produces, also at a distance,\r\nvery distinct images of all sorts of objects, on all sorts of bodies,\r\nand in the most complete darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind in what immense proportion electric or magnetic\r\nactions increase by motion, we shall be less inclined to deride the\r\nrapid actions of magnetizers.\r\n\r\nIn here recording these developed reflections, I wished to show that\r\nsomnambulism must not be rejected _à priori_, especially by those who\r\nhave kept well up with the recent progress of the physical sciences. I\r\nhave indicated some facts, some resemblances, by which magnetizers might\r\ndefend themselves against those who would think it superfluous to\r\nattempt new experiments, or even to see them performed. For my part, I\r\nhesitate not to acknowledge it, although, notwithstanding the\r\npossibilities that I have pointed out, I do not admit the reality of the\r\nreadings, neither through a wall, nor through any other opaque body, nor\r\nby the mere intromission of the elbow, or the occiput,--still, I should\r\nnot fulfil the duties of an academician if I refused to attend the\r\nmeetings where such phenomena were promised me, provided they granted me\r\nsufficient influence as regards the proofs, for me to feel assured that\r\nI was not become the victim of mere jugglery.\r\n\r\nNor did Franklin, Lavoisier, or Bailly believe in Mesmeric magnetism\r\nbefore they became members of the Government Commission, and yet we may\r\nhave remarked with what minute and scrupulous care they varied the\r\nexperiments. True philosophers ought to have constantly before their\r\neyes those two beautiful lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"To suppose that every thing has been discovered is a profound error:\r\n     It is mistaking the horizon for the limits of the world.\"[12]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\n     \"Le voilà, ce mortel, dont le siècle s'honore,\r\n     Par qui sont replongés au séjour infernal\r\n     Tous les fléaux vengeurs que déchaîna Pandore;\r\n     Dans son art bienfaisant il n'a pas de rival,\r\n     Et la Grèce l'eut pris pour le dieu d'Epidaure.\"\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\n     \"Les sots sont ici-bas pour nos menus plaisirs.\"\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n     \"Un décrotteur â la royale,\r\n     Du talon gauche estropié,\r\n     Obtint pour grace spéciale\r\n     D'être boiteux de l'autre pié.\"\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n     \"De par le Roi, défense à Dieu\r\n     D'opérer miracle en ce lieu!\"\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n     \"Il est des noeuds secrets, il est des sympathies,\r\n     Dont par les doux rapports les âmes assorties\r\n     S'attachent l'une à l'autre.\"\r\n\r\n[12]\r\n\r\n     \"Croire tout découvert est un erreur profonde:\r\n     C'est prendre l'horizon pour les bornes du monde.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTION OF BAILLY INTO THE ACADEMY OF INSCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the pretended identity of the Atlantis, or of the kingdom\r\nof Ophir under Solomon with America, Bailly says, in his fourteenth\r\nletter to Voltaire: \"Those ideas belonged to the age of learned men, but\r\nnot to the philosophic age.\" And elsewhere (in the twenty-first letter)\r\nwe read these words: \"Do not fear that I shall fatigue you by heavy\r\nerudition.\" To have supposed that erudition could be heavy and be\r\ndeficient in philosophy, was for certain people of a secondary order an\r\nunpardonable crime. And thus we saw men, excited by a sentiment of hate,\r\narm themselves with a critical microscope, and painfully seek out\r\nimperfections in the innumerable quotations with which Bailly had\r\nstrengthened himself. The harvest was not abundant; yet, these eager\r\nferrets succeeded in discovering some weak points, some interpretations\r\nthat might be contested. Their joy then knew no bounds. Bailly was\r\ntreated with haughty disdain: \"His literary erudition was very\r\nsuperficial; he had not the key of the sanctuary of antiquity; he was\r\neverywhere deficient in languages.\"\r\n\r\nThat it might not be supposed that these reproaches had any reference to\r\nOriental literature, Bailly's adversaries added: \"that he had not the\r\nleast tincture of the ancient languages; that he did not know Latin.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not know Latin? And do you not see, you stupid enemies of the\r\ngreat Astronomer, that if it had been possible to compose such learned\r\nworks as _The History of Astronomy_, and _The Letters on the Atlantis_,\r\nwithout referring to the original texts, by using translations only, you\r\nwould no longer have preserved any importance in the literary world.\r\nHow is it that you did not remark, that by despoiling Bailly (and very\r\narbitrarily) of the knowledge of Latin, you showed the inutility of\r\nstudying that language to become both one of your best writers, and one\r\nof the most illustrious philosophers of the age?\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, far from participating\r\nin these puerile rancours, in the blind prejudices of some lost children\r\nof erudition, called Bailly to its bosom in 1785. Till then, Fontenelle\r\nalone had had the honour of belonging to the three great Academies of\r\nFrance. Bailly always showed himself very proud of a distinction which\r\nassociated his name in an unusual manner with that of the illustrious\r\nwriter, whose eulogies contributed so powerfully to make science and\r\nscientific men known and respected.\r\n\r\nIndependently of this special consideration, Bailly, as member of the\r\nFrench Academy, could all the better appreciate the suffrages of the\r\nAcademy of Inscriptions, since there existed at that time between those\r\ntwo illustrious Societies a strong and inexplicable feeling of rivalry.\r\nThis had even proceeded so far, that by a most solemn deliberation of\r\nthe Academy of Inscriptions, any of its members would have ceased to\r\nbelong to it, would have been irrevocably expelled, if they had even\r\nonly endeavoured to be received into the French Academy; and the king\r\nhaving annulled this deliberation, fifteen academicians bound themselves\r\nby oath to observe all its stipulations notwithstanding; furthermore, in\r\n1783, Choiseul Gouffier, who was accused of having adhered to the\r\nprinciples of the fifteen confederates, and then of having allowed\r\nhimself to be nominated by the rival Academy, was summoned by Anquetil\r\nto appear before the Tribunal of the Marshals of France for having\r\nbroken his word of honour.\r\n\r\nBut, I may be allowed here to remark, superior men have always had the\r\nprivilege of upsetting, by the mere influence of their name, the\r\nobstacles that routine, prejudices, and jealousy wished to oppose to the\r\nprogress and the union of souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE HOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nScientific tribunals, which should pronounce in the first instance while\r\nawaiting the definitive judgment of the public, were one of the\r\nrequisites of our epoch; and thus, without any formal prescription of\r\nits successive regulations, the Academy of Sciences has been gradually\r\nled on to appoint committees to examine all the papers that have been\r\npresented to it, and to pronounce on their novelty, merit, and\r\nimportance. This labour is generally an ungrateful one, and without\r\nglory, but talent has immense privileges; entrust Bailly with those\r\nsimple Academical Reports, and their publication becomes an event.\r\n\r\nM. Poyet, architect and comptroller of buildings in Paris, presented to\r\nGovernment in the course of the year 1785, a paper wherein he strove to\r\nestablish the necessity of removing the Hôtel Dieu, and building a new\r\nhospital in another locality. This document, submitted by order of the\r\nking to the judgment of the Academy, gave rise, directly or indirectly,\r\nto three deliberations. The Academic Commissioners were, Lassone, Tenou,\r\nTillet, Darcet, Daubenton, Bailly, Coulomb, Laplace, and Lavoisier. It\r\nwas Bailly, however, who constantly held the pen. His reports have been\r\nhonoured with a great and just celebrity. The progress of science would\r\nnow perhaps allow of some modification being made in the ideas of the\r\nillustrious commissioners. Their views on warming-rooms, on their size,\r\non ventilation, on general health, might, for example, receive some real\r\nameliorations; but nothing could add to the sentiments of respect\r\ninspired by Bailly's work. What clearness of exposition! What neatness,\r\nwhat simplicity of style! Never did a writer put himself more completely\r\nout of view; never did a man more sincerely seek to make the sacred\r\ncause of humanity triumph. The interest that Bailly takes in the poor is\r\ndeep, but always exempt from parade; his words are moderate, full of\r\ngentleness, even where hasty feelings of anger and indignation would\r\nhave been legitimate. Of anger and of indignation! Yes, Gentlemen;\r\nlisten, and decide!\r\n\r\nI have cited the names of the commissioners. At no time, and in no\r\ncountry, could more virtue and learning have been united. These select\r\nmen, regulating themselves in this respect according to the most common\r\nlogic, felt that the task of pronouncing on a reform of the Hôtel Dieu\r\nimposed on them the necessity of examining that establishment. \"We have\r\nasked,\" said their interpreter, \"we have asked the Board of\r\nAdministration to permit us to see the hospital in detail, and\r\naccompanied by some one who could guide and instruct us ... we required\r\nto know several particulars; we asked for them, but we obtained\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\nWe have obtained nothing! These are the sad, the incredible words, that\r\nmen so worthy of respect are obliged to insert in the first line of\r\ntheir report!\r\n\r\nWhat then was the authority that allowed itself to be so deficient in\r\nthe most usual respect towards commissioners invested with the\r\nconfidence of the King, the Academy, and the Public? This authority\r\nconsisted of several administrators (the type of them, it is said, is\r\nnot quite lost), who looked upon the poor as their patrimony, who\r\ndevoted to them a disinterested but unproductive activity; who were\r\nimpatient at any amelioration, the germ of which had not developed\r\nitself either in their own heads, or in those of certain men,\r\nphilanthropic by nature, or by the privilege of their station. Ah! if by\r\nenlightened and constant care that vast asylum, opened to poverty and\r\nsickness, near Notre-Dame, had been then conducted, now sixty years ago,\r\nonly in a tolerable way, we should have understood how, in taking human\r\nnature into consideration, the promoters of this great benefit would\r\nhave repelled an examination that seemed to throw a doubt on their zeal\r\nand on their good sense. But alas! let us take from Bailly's work a few\r\ntraits of the moderate and faithful picture that he drew of the Hôtel\r\nDieu, and you shall decide, Gentlemen, whether the susceptibility of the\r\nadministrators was authorized; whether, on the contrary, they ought not\r\nthemselves to have anticipated the unhoped-for help from the king's\r\npower, united to science, which was now offered to them; whether by\r\nretarding certain ameliorations by a single day, they did not commit the\r\ncrime of lèse-humanity.\r\n\r\nIn 1786, infirmities of all sorts were treated at the Hôtel Dieu:\r\nsurgical maladies, chronic maladies, contagious maladies, female\r\ndiseases, infantine diseases, &c. Every thing was admitted, but all\r\npresented an inevitable confusion.\r\n\r\nA patient on arriving was often laid in the bed and in the sheets of a\r\nman who had had the itch, and had just died.\r\n\r\nThe department reserved for madmen being very confined, two were put to\r\nsleep together. Two madmen in the same sheets! Nature revolts at the\r\nvery thought of it.\r\n\r\nIn the ward of St. Francis, reserved exclusively for men having the\r\nsmallpox, there were sometimes, for want of other space, as many as six\r\nadults or eight children in a bed not a mètre and a half wide.\r\n\r\nThe women attacked with this frightful disease were mixed in the ward of\r\nSt. Monique with others who had only a simple fever, and the latter fell\r\nan inevitable prey to the hideous contagion, in the very place where,\r\nfull of confidence, they had hoped to recover their health.\r\n\r\nWomen with child, women in their confinement, were equally crowded,\r\npell-mell, on narrow and infected truckle-beds.\r\n\r\nNor let it be supposed that I have borrowed from Bailly's Report some\r\npurely exceptional cases, belonging to those cruel times, when whole\r\npopulations, suffering under some epidemic, were tried beyond all human\r\nanticipation. In their usual state, the beds of the Hôtel Dieu, which\r\nwere not a mètre and a half wide, contained four, and often six\r\npatients; they were placed alternately head and feet, the feet of one\r\ntouching the shoulders of the next; each had only for his share of space\r\n25 centimetres (9 inches); now, a man of medium size, lying with his\r\narms close to his body, is 48 centimetres (16 inches) broad at the\r\nshoulders. The poor patients then could not keep within the bed but by\r\nlying on their side perfectly immovable; no one could turn without\r\npushing, without waking his neighbour; they therefore used to agree, as\r\nfar as their illness would allow, for some of them to remain up part of\r\nthe night in the space between the beds, whilst the others slept; and\r\nwhen the approaches of death nailed these unfortunate people to their\r\nplace, did they not energetically curse that help, which in such a\r\nsituation could only prolong their painful agony.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only that beds thus placed were a source of discomfort,\r\nof disgust; that they prevented rest and sleep; that an insupportable\r\nheat occasioned and propagated diseases of the skin and frightful\r\nvermin; that the fever patient bedewed his neighbours with his profuse\r\nperspirations; and that in the critical moment he might be chilled by\r\ncontact with those whose hot fit would occur later, &c. Still more\r\nserious effects resulted from the presence of many sick in the same bed;\r\nthe food, the medicines, intended for one person, often found their way\r\nto another. In short, Gentlemen, in those beds of multiple population,\r\nthe dead often lay for hours, and sometimes whole nights, intermingled\r\nwith the living. The principal charitable establishment in Paris thus\r\noffered those dreadful coincidences, that the poets of Rome, that\r\nancient historians have represented under King Mezentius, as the utmost\r\nextreme of barbarism.\r\n\r\nSuch was, Gentlemen, the normal state of the old Hôtel Dieu. One word,\r\none word only, will suffice to tell what was the exceptional state: they\r\nplaced some patients on the tops or testers of those same beds, where we\r\nhave found so much suffering, so many authorized maledictions.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, let us, together with our fellow academician, cast a\r\nglance on the ward of surgical operations.\r\n\r\nThis ward was full of patients. The operations were performed in their\r\npresence. Bailly says, \"We see there the preparations for the torment;\r\nthere are heard the cries of the tormented. He who has to suffer the\r\nnext day has before him a picture of his own future sufferings; he who\r\nhas passed through this terrible trial, must be deeply moved at those\r\ncries so similar to his own, and must feel his agonies repeated; and\r\nthese terrors, these emotions, he experiences in the midst of the\r\nprogress of inflammation or suppuration, retarding his recovery, and at\r\nthe hazard of his life.\"... \"To what purpose,\" Bailly justly exclaims,\r\n\"would you make an unfortunate man suffer, if there is not a probability\r\nof saving him, and unless we increase that probability by all possible\r\nprecautions?\"\r\n\r\nThe heart aches, the mind becomes confused, at the sight of so much\r\nmisery; and yet this hospital, so little in harmony with its intended\r\npurpose, still existed sixty years ago. It is in a capital, the centre\r\nof the arts, of knowledge, of polished manners; it is in an age renowned\r\nfor the development of public wealth, for the progress of luxury, for\r\nthe ruinous creation of a crowd of establishments devoted to amusements,\r\nto worldly and futile pleasures; it is by the side of the palace of an\r\nopulent archbishop; it is at the gate of a sumptuous cathedral, that the\r\nunfortunate, under the deceitful mask of charity, underwent such\r\ndreadful tortures. To whom should we impute the long duration of this\r\nvicious and inhuman organization?\r\n\r\nTo the professors of the art? No, no, Gentlemen! By an inconceivable\r\nanomaly the physicians, the surgeons, never obtained more than a\r\nsecondary, a subordinate influence over the administration of the\r\nhospitals. No, no, the sentiments of the medical body for the poor could\r\nnot be doubted, at an epoch and in a country where Dr. Anthony Petit\r\nthus answered the irritated queen, Marie Antoinette: \"Madam, if I came\r\nnot yesterday to Versailles, it was because I was attending the lying-in\r\nof a peasant, who was in the greatest danger. Your Majesty errs,\r\nhowever, in supposing that I neglect the Dauphin for the poor; I have\r\nhitherto treated the young child with as much attention and care as if\r\nhe had been the son of one of your grooms.\"\r\n\r\nPreference was granted to the most suffering, to those in most danger,\r\ndisregarding rank and fortune; such was, you see, Gentlemen, the sublime\r\nrule of the French Medical Corps; and such is still its gospel. I want\r\nno other proof of it than those admirable words addressed by our fellow\r\nlabourer Larrey, to his friend Tanchou, when wounded at the Battle of\r\nMontmirail: \"Your wound is slight, sir; we have only room and straw in\r\nthis ambulance for serious wounds. They will take you into that stable.\"\r\n\r\nThe medical corps could not, therefore, with any reason be accused or\r\nsuspected in regard to the old Hôtel Dieu of Paris.\r\n\r\nIf economy be invoked, I find an answer quite à-propos in Bailly: the\r\ndaily allowance for the patients at the Hôtel Dieu was notably higher\r\nthan in other establishments in the capital more charitably organized.\r\n\r\nWould any one go so far as to assert that the sick condemned to seek\r\nrefuge in the hospitals, having their sensibilities blunted by labour,\r\nby misery, by their daily sufferings, would but faintly feel the effects\r\nof the horrible arrangements that the old Hôtel Dieu revealed to all\r\nclear-sighted people? I will quote from the report of our colleague;\r\n\"The maladies continue nearly double the time at the Hôtel Dieu,\r\ncompared with those at the Charité: the mortality there is also nearly\r\ndouble!... All the trepanned die in that hospital; whilst this\r\noperation is tolerably successful in Paris, and still more so at\r\nVersailles.\"\r\n\r\nThe maladies continue double the time! The mortality there is double!\r\nAll those who are trepanned die! The lying-in women die in a frightful\r\nproportion, &c. These are the sinister words that strike the eye\r\nperiodically in the statements of the Hôtel Dieu; and yet, let us repeat\r\nit, years passed away, and nothing was altered in the organization of\r\nthe great hospital! Why persist in remaining in a condition that so\r\nopenly wounds humanity? Must we, together with Cabanis, who also abused\r\nthe old Hôtel Dieu severely, \"must we exclaim, that abuses known by all\r\nthe world, against which every voice is raised, have secret supporters\r\nwho know how to defend them, in a manner to tire out well-meaning\r\npeople? Must we speak of false characters, perverse hearts, that seemed\r\nto regard errors and abuses as their patrimony?\" Let us dare to\r\nacknowledge it, Gentlemen, evil is generally perpetrated in a less\r\nwicked manner: it is done without the intervention of any strong\r\npassion; by vulgar, yet all-powerful routine, and ignorance. I observe\r\nthe same thought, though couched in the calm and cleverly circumspect\r\nlanguage of Bailly: \"The Hôtel Dieu has existed perhaps since the\r\nseventh century, and if this hospital is the most imperfect of all, it\r\nis because it is the oldest. From the earliest date of this\r\nestablishment, good has been sought, the desire has been to adhere to\r\nit, and constancy has appeared a duty. From this cause, all useful\r\nnovelties have with difficulty found admission; any reform is difficult;\r\nthere is a numerous administration to convince; there is an immense mass\r\nto move.\"\r\n\r\nThe immensity of the mass, however, did not discourage the old\r\nCommissioners of the Academy. Let this conduct serve as an example to\r\nlearned men, to administrators, who might be called upon to cast an\r\ninvestigating eye on the whole of our beneficent and humane\r\nestablishments. Undoubtedly, the abuses, if any yet exist, have not\r\nindividually any thing to be compared to those to which Bailly's report\r\ndid justice; but would it be impossible for them to have sprung up\r\nafresh in the course of half a century, and that in proportion to their\r\nmultiplicity, they should still make enormous and deplorable breaches in\r\nthe patrimony of the poor?\r\n\r\nI shall modify very slightly, Gentlemen, the concluding words of our\r\nillustrious colleague's report, and I shall not in the least alter their\r\ninnate meaning, if I say, in finishing this long analysis: \"Each poor\r\nman is now laid alone in a bed, and he owes it principally to the\r\ngifted, persevering, and courageous efforts of the Academy of Sciences.\r\nThe poor man ought to know it, and the poor man will not forget it.\"\r\nHappy, Gentlemen, happy the academy that can adorn itself with such\r\nreminiscences!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nAn attentive glance at the past has been, in all ages and in all\r\ncountries, the infallible means of rightly appreciating the present.\r\nWhen we direct this glance to the sanitary state of Paris, the name of\r\nBailly will again present itself in the first line amongst the promoters\r\nof a capital amelioration, which I shall point out in a few words.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous acts of parliament,--notwithstanding the\r\npositive police regulations, which dated back to Charles IX., to Henry\r\nIII., to Henry IV., slaughter-houses still existed in the interior of\r\nthe capital in 1788; for instance, at l'Apport-Paris, La Croix-Rouge, in\r\nthe streets of the Butcheries, Mont-Martre, Saint-Martin, Traversine,\r\n&c. &c. The oxen were, consequently, driven in droves through frequented\r\nparts of the town; enraged by the noise of the carriages, by the\r\nexcitements of the children, by the attacks or barking of the wandering\r\ndogs, they often sought to escape,--entered houses or alleys, spread\r\nalarm everywhere, gored people, and committed great damage. Fetid gases\r\nexhaled from buildings too small and badly ventilated; the offal that\r\nhad to be carried away gave out an insupportable smell; the blood flowed\r\nthrough the gutters of the neighbourhood, with other remains of the\r\nanimals, and putrefied there. The melting of tallow, an inevitable\r\nannexation of all slaughter-houses, spread around disgusting emanations,\r\nand occasioned a constant danger of fire.\r\n\r\nSo inconvenient, so repulsive a state of things, awakened the solicitude\r\nof individuals and of the public administration; the problem was\r\nsubmitted to our predecessors, and Bailly, as usual, became the reporter\r\nof the Academical Committee. The other members were Messrs. Tillet,\r\nDarcet, Daubenton, Coulomb, Lavoisier, and Laplace.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon, wishing to liberate Paris from the dangerous and\r\ninsalubrious results of internal slaughter-houses, decreed the\r\nconstruction of the fine slaughter-houses known by everybody, he found\r\nthe subject already well examined, exhibited in all its points of view,\r\nin Bailly's excellent work. \"We ask,\" said the reporter of the\r\nAcademical Commission in 1788, \"we ask that the shambles be removed to a\r\ndistance from the interior of Paris;\" and these interior shambles have\r\ndisappeared accordingly. Does it create surprise that it required more\r\nthan fifteen years to obtain the grant of this most reasonable demand?\r\nI will further remark that, unfortunately, there was nothing exceptional\r\nin this; he who sows a thought in a field rank with prejudices, with\r\nprivate interests, and with routine, must never expect an early harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES OF COOK AND OF GRESSET.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the five quarto volumes of which _the History of\r\nAstronomy_ consists, together with the two powerful _reports_ that I\r\nhave just described, had worn out Bailly. To relax and amuse his mind,\r\nhe resumed the style of composition that had enchanted him in his youth;\r\nhe wrote some biographies, amongst others, that of Captain Cook,\r\nproposed as a prize-subject by the Academy of Marseilles, and the Life\r\nof Gresset.\r\n\r\nThe biography of Gresset first appeared anonymously. This circumstance\r\ngave rise to a singular scene, which the author used to relate with a\r\nsmile. I will here myself repeat the principal traits of it, if it be\r\nonly to deter writers, whoever they may be, from launching their works\r\ninto the world without affixing their names to them.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness of Créqui was a lady in the high circles of society, to\r\nwhom a copy of the eulogium of the author of _Vert-Vert_ was presented\r\nas an offering. Some days after Bailly went to pay her a visit; did he\r\nhope to hear her speak favourably of the new work? I know not. At all\r\nevents, our predecessor would have been ill rewarded for his curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said the great lady as soon as she saw him, \"a Eulogy of\r\nGresset recently published? The author has sent me a copy of it, without\r\nnaming himself. He will probably come to see me; he may, perhaps, have\r\ncome already. What could I say to him? I do not think any one ever wrote\r\nworse. He mistakes obscurity for profundity; it is the darkness before\r\nthe creation.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all Bailly's efforts to change the subject of the\r\nconversation, perhaps on account of those very efforts, the Marchioness\r\nrose, goes in search of the pamphlet, puts it into the author's hands,\r\nand begs of him to read aloud, if it be but the first page--quite\r\nenough, she said, to enable one to judge of the rest.\r\n\r\nBailly used to read remarkably well. I leave it to be guessed whether,\r\non this occasion, he was able to exercise this talent. Superfluous\r\ntrouble! Madame de Créqui interrupted him at each sentence by the most\r\ndisagreeable commentaries, by exclamations such as the following:\r\n\"Detestable style!\" \"Confusion worse confounded!\" and other similar\r\namenities. Bailly did not succeed in extorting any indulgences from\r\nMadame de Créqui, when, fortunately, the arrival of another visitor put\r\nan end to this insupportable torture.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this, Bailly having become the first personage in the\r\ncity, some booksellers collected all his opuscula and published them.\r\nThis time, the Marchioness, who had lost all recollection of the scene\r\nthat I have been describing, overpowered the Mayor of Paris with\r\ncompliments and felicitations on account of this same eulogy, which she\r\nhad before treated with such inhuman rigour.\r\n\r\nSuch a contrast excited the mirth of the author. Still, might I dare to\r\nsay so, Madame de Créqui was, perhaps, sincere on both occasions; had\r\nthe exaggerations of praise and of criticism been put aside, it would\r\nnot have been impossible to defend both opinions. The early pages of\r\nthe pamphlet might appear embarrassed and obscure, whilst in the rest\r\nthere might be found great refinement, elegance, and appreciations full\r\nof taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSEMBLY OF THE NOTABLES.--BAILLY IS NAMED FIRST DEPUTY OF PARIS; AND\r\nSOON AFTER DEAN OR SENIOR OF THE DEPUTIES OF THE COMMUNES.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of the Notables had no other effect than to show in a\r\nstronger light the disorder of the finances, and the other wounds that\r\nwere galling France. It was then that the Parliament of Paris asked for\r\nthe convocation of the States General. This demand was unfavourably\r\nreceived by Cardinal de Brienne. Soon afterwards the convocation became\r\na necessity, and Necker, now in the ministry, announced, in the month of\r\nNovember, 1788, that it was decreed in Council, and that the king had\r\neven granted to the third estate a double representation, which had been\r\nso imprudently disputed by the courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe districts were formed, on the king's convocation, the 21st of April,\r\n1789. That day was the first day of Bailly's political life. It was on\r\nthe 21st of April that the Citizen of Chaillot, entering the Hall of the\r\n_Feuillants_, imagined, he said, that \"he breathed a new atmosphere,\"\r\nand regarded \"as a phenomenon that he should have become something in\r\nthe body-politic, merely from his being a citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThe elections were to be made in two gradations. Bailly was named first\r\nelector of his district. A few days after, at the general meeting, the\r\nAssembly called him to the Board in quality of secretary. Thus it was\r\nour fellow-academician who, in the beginning, drew up the celebrated\r\n_procès-verbal_ of the meetings of the electors of Paris, so often\r\nquoted by the historians of the revolution.\r\n\r\nBailly also took an active part in drawing up the records of his\r\ndistrict, and the records of the body of electors. The part he acted in\r\nthese two capacities could not be doubtful, if we judge of it by the\r\nthree following short quotations extracted from his memoirs: \"The nation\r\nmust remember that she is sovereign and mistress to order every\r\nthing.... It is not when reason awakes, that we should allege ancient\r\nprivileges and absurd prejudices.... I shall praise the electors of\r\nParis who were the first to conceive the idea of prefacing the French\r\nConstitution with a declaration of the Rights of Man.\"\r\n\r\nBailly had always been so extremely reserved in his conduct and in his\r\nwritings, that it was difficult to surmise under what point of view he\r\nwould consider the national agitation of '89. Hence, at the very\r\nbeginning, the Abbé Maury, of the French Academy, proposed to unite\r\nhimself to Bailly, and that they should reside at Versailles, and have\r\nan apartment in common between them. It is difficult to avoid a smile\r\nwhen one compares the conduct of the eloquent and impetuous Abbé with\r\nthe categorical declarations, so distinct and so progressive, of the\r\nlearned astronomer.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 12th of May, the general assembly of the electors\r\nproceeded to ballot for the nomination of the first deputy of Paris.\r\nBailly was chosen.\r\n\r\nThis nomination is often quoted as a proof of the high intelligence, and\r\nof the wisdom of our fathers, two qualities which, since that epoch,\r\nmust have been constantly on the decline, if we are to believe the blind\r\nPessimists. Such an accusation imposed on me the duty of carrying the\r\nappreciation of this wisdom, of this intelligence that is held up\r\nagainst us, even to numerical correctness. The following is the result:\r\nthe majority of the votes was 159; Bailly obtained 173; this was\r\nfourteen more than he required. If fourteen votes had changed sides the\r\nresult would have been different. Was this an incident, I ask, to\r\nexclaim so much against?\r\n\r\nBailly showed himself deeply affected by this mark of the confidence\r\nwith which he was regarded. His sensibility, his gratitude, did not\r\nprevent him, however, from recording in his memoirs the following\r\n_naïve_ observation: \"I observed in the Assembly of the Electors a great\r\ndislike for literary men, and for the academicians.\"\r\n\r\nI recommend this remark to all studious men who, by circumstances or by\r\na sense of duty, may be thrown into the whirlpool of politics. Perhaps I\r\nmay yield to the temptation of developing it, when I shall have to\r\ncharacterize Bailly's connection with his co-laborers in the first\r\nmunicipality of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe great question on the verification of the powers was already\r\nstrongly agitated, the day that Bailly and the other Deputies of Paris\r\nfor the first time were able to go to Versailles; our academician had\r\nonly spoken once in that majestic assembly, viz: to induce the adoption\r\nof the method of voting by members being _seated_ or _standing_,--when,\r\non the 3d of June, he was named Senior of the Deputies of the Communes\r\n(or Commons). Formerly, the right of presiding in the third house of the\r\nkingdom belonged to the provost of the merchants. Bailly in his\r\ndiffidence thought that the assembly, in assigning the chair to him, had\r\nwished to compensate the capital for the loss of an old privilege. This\r\nconsideration induced him to accept of a duty that he thought above his\r\npowers,--he who always depicted himself as timid to an extreme, and not\r\npossessing a facility of speaking.\r\n\r\nMen's minds were more animated, more ardent in 1789 than those would\r\nadmit who always see in the present a faithful image of the past. But\r\ncalumny, that murderous arm of political party, already respected no\r\nposition. Knowledge, loyalty, virtue, did not suffice to shelter any one\r\nfrom its poisoned darts. Bailly experienced it on the very day after his\r\nnomination to such an eminent post as President of the Communes.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, the Communes had voted an address to the king on the\r\nconstantly recurring difficulties that the nobility opposed to the union\r\nof the States General in one assembly. In order to carry out this most\r\nsolemn deliberation, Bailly solicited an audience, in which the moderate\r\nand respectful expression of the anxiety of six hundred loyal deputies\r\nwas to be presented to the monarch. In the midst of these strifes the\r\nDauphin died. Without taking the trouble to consult dates, the court\r\nparty immediately represented Bailly as a stranger to the commonest\r\nproprieties, and totally deficient in feeling; he ought, they said, to\r\nhave respected the most allowable of griefs; his importunities had been\r\nbarbarous.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that such ridiculous accusations were no longer thought\r\nof; the categorical explanations that Bailly himself gave on this topic,\r\nseemed to me as if they would have sufficed to convince the most\r\nprejudiced. I was deceived, Gentlemen; the reproach of violence, of\r\nbrutal insensibility, has just been repeated by the pen of a clever and\r\na conscientious man. I will give his recital: \"Scarcely two hours had\r\nelapsed since the royal child had breathed his last sigh, when Bailly,\r\nPresident of the Third Estate, insisted on admission to the king, who\r\nhad prohibited any one being allowed to intrude upon him. But so\r\npositive was the demand, that they were obliged to yield, and Louis XVI.\r\nexclaimed, 'There are then no fathers in that chamber of the Third\r\nEstate.' The chamber very much applauded this trait of brutal\r\ninsensibility in Bailly, which they termed a trait of Spartan stoicism.\"\r\n\r\nAs many errors as words. The following is the truth. The illness of the\r\nDauphin had not prevented the two privileged orders from being received\r\nby the king. This preference offended the Communes. They ordered the\r\nPresident to solicit an audience. He discharged his duty with great\r\ncaution. All his proceedings were concerted with two ministers, Necker\r\nand M. de Barentin. The king answered, \"It is impossible for me to see\r\nM. Bailly in the situation in which I am to-night, nor to-morrow\r\nmorning, nor to fix a day for receiving the deputation of the Third\r\nEstate.\" The note ends with these words: \"Show my note to M. Bailly for\r\nhis vindication.\"\r\n\r\nThus, on the day of these events the Dauphin was not dead; thus the king\r\nwas not obliged to yield, he did not receive Bailly; thus the chamber\r\nhad no act of insensibility to applaud; thus Louis XVI. perceived so\r\nclearly that the President of the Communes was fulfilling the duties of\r\nhis office, that he felt it requisite to give him an exoneration.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Dauphin happened on the 4th of June. As soon as the\r\nassembly of the Third Estate were informed of it, they charged the\r\nPresident, I quote the very words, \"to report to their majesties the\r\ndeep grief with which this news had penetrated the Communes.\"\r\n\r\nA deputation of twenty members, having Bailly at their head, was\r\nreceived on the 6th. The President thus expressed himself: \"Your\r\nfaithful Communes are deeply moved by the circumstance in which your\r\nmajesty has the goodness to receive their deputation, and they take the\r\nliberty to address to you the expression of all their regrets, and of\r\ntheir respectful sensibility.\"\r\n\r\nSuch language can, I think, be delivered without uneasiness to the\r\nappreciation of all good men.\r\n\r\nLet us be correct; the Communes did not obtain at once the audience that\r\nthey demanded on account of the difficulties of the ceremonial. They\r\nwould have wished to make the Third Estate speak kneeling. \"This\r\ncustom,\" said M. de Barentin, \"has existed from time immemorial, and if\r\nthe king wished....\" \"And if twenty-five millions of men do not wish\r\nit,\" exclaimed Bailly, interrupting the minister, \"where are the means\r\nto force them?\" \"The two privileged orders,\" replied the Guard of the\r\nSeals, somewhat stunned by the apostrophe, \"no longer require the Third\r\nEstate to bend the knee; but, after having formerly possessed immense\r\nprivileges in the ceremonial, they limit themselves now to asking some\r\ndifference. This difference I cannot find.\" \"Do not take the trouble to\r\nseek for it,\" replied the President hastily: \"however slight the\r\ndifference might be, the Communes will not suffer it.\"\r\n\r\nThis digression was required through a grave and recent error. The\r\nmemory of Bailly will not suffer by it, since it has afforded me the\r\nopportunity of establishing, beyond any reply, that in our fellow\r\nacademician a noble firmness was on occasions allied to urbanity,\r\nmildness, and politeness. But what will be said of the puerilities which\r\nI have been obliged to recall, of the mean pretensions of the courtiers\r\non the eve of an immense revolution? When the Greeks of the Lower\r\nEmpire, instead of going on the ramparts valiantly to repel the attacks\r\nof the Turks, remained night and day collected around some sophists in\r\ntheir lyceums and academies, their sterile debates at least related to\r\nsome intellectual questions; but at Versailles, there was nothing in\r\naction, on the part of two out of three orders, but the most miserable\r\nvanity.\r\n\r\nBy an express arrangement, decreed from the beginning, among the Members\r\nof the Communes, the Dean or President had to be renewed every week.\r\nNotwithstanding the incessant representations of Bailly, this\r\nlegislative article was long neglected, so fortunate did the Assembly\r\nfeel in having at their head this eminent man, who to undeniable\r\nknowledge, united sincerity, moderation, and a degree of patriotism not\r\nless appreciated.\r\n\r\nHe thus presided over the Third Estate on the memorable days that\r\ndetermined the march of our great revolution.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of June, for instance, when the Deputies of the Communes,\r\nworn out with the tergiversations of the other two orders, showed that\r\nin case of need they would act without their concurrence, and resolutely\r\nadopted the title of National Assembly,--they provided against presumed\r\nprojects of dissolution, by stamping as illegal all levies of\r\ncontribution which were not granted by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 20th of June, when the Members of the National Assembly,\r\naffronted at the Hall having been closed and their meetings suspended\r\nwithout an official notification, with only the simple form of placards\r\nand public criers, as if a mere theatre was in question, they assembled\r\nat a tennis-court, and \"took an oath never to separate, but to assemble\r\nwherever circumstances might render it requisite, until the Constitution\r\nof the Kingdom should be established and confirmed on solid\r\nfoundations.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, Bailly was still at the head of his colleagues on the 23d of\r\nJune, when, by an inexcusable inconsistency, and which perhaps was not\r\nwithout some influence on the events of that day, the Deputies of the\r\nThird Estate were detained a long time at the servants' door of the Hall\r\nof Meeting, and in the rain; while the deputies of the other two orders,\r\nto whom a more convenient and more suitable entrance had been assigned,\r\nwere already in their places.\r\n\r\nThe account that Bailly gave of the celebrated royal meeting on the 23d\r\nof June, does not exactly agree with that of most historians.\r\n\r\nThe king finished his speech with the following imprudent words: \"I\r\norder you, Gentlemen, to separate immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole of the nobility and a portion of the clergy retired; while the\r\nDeputies of the Communes remained quietly in their places. The Grand\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies having remarked it, approaching Bailly said to\r\nhim, \"You heard the king's order, Sir?\" The illustrious President\r\nanswered, \"I cannot adjourn the Assembly until it has deliberated on\r\nit.\" \"Is that indeed your answer, and am I to communicate it to the\r\nking?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" replied Bailly, and immediately addressing the\r\nDeputies who surrounded him, he said, \"It appears to me that the\r\nassembled nation cannot receive an order.\"\r\n\r\nIt was after this debate, at once both firm and moderate, that Mirabeau\r\naddressed from his place the well-known apostrophe to M. de Brézé. The\r\nPresident disapproved both of the basis and the form of it; he felt that\r\nthere was no sufficient motive; for, said he, the Grand Master of the\r\nCeremonies made use of no menace; he had not in any way insinuated that\r\nthere was an intention to resort to force; he had not, above all, spoken\r\nof bayonets. At all events, there is an essential difference between the\r\nwords of Mirabeau as related in almost all the Histories of the\r\nRevolution, and those reported by Bailly. According to our illustrious\r\ncolleague the impetuous tribune exclaimed, \"Go tell those who sent you,\r\nthat the force of bayonets can do nothing against the will of the\r\nnation.\" This is, to my mind, much more energetic than the common\r\nversion. The expression, \"We will only retire by the force of bayonets!\"\r\nhad always appeared to me, notwithstanding the admiration conceded to\r\nit, to imply only a resistance which would cease on the arrival of a\r\ncorporal and half-a-dozen soldiers.\r\n\r\nBailly quitted the chair of President of the National Assembly on the 2d\r\nof July. His scientific celebrity, his virtue, his conciliating spirit,\r\nhad not been superfluous in habituating certain men to see a member of\r\nthe Communes preside over an assembly in which there was a prince of the\r\nblood, a prince of the church, the greatest lords of the kingdom, and\r\nall the high dignitaries of the clergy. The first person named to\r\nsucceed to Bailly was the Duke d'Orléans. After his refusal, the\r\nAssembly chose the Archbishop of Vienne (Pompignan).\r\n\r\nBailly recalls to mind with sensibility, in his memoirs, the testimonies\r\nof esteem that he obtained through his difficult and laborious\r\npresidency. The 3d of July, on the proposition of the Duke de la\r\nRochefoucauld and of the Archbishop of Bordeaux, the National Assembly\r\nsent a deputation to their illustrious ex-president, to thank him (these\r\nare the precise words) \"for his noble, wise, and firm conduct.\" The\r\nelectoral body of Bordeaux had been beforehand with these homages. The\r\nChamber of Commerce of that town, at the same time, decided that the\r\nportrait of the great citizen should decorate their hall of meeting. The\r\nAcademy of Sciences, the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, did\r\nnot remain insensible to the glory that one of their members had\r\nacquired in the career of politics, and testified it by numerous\r\ndeputations. Finally, Marmontel, in the name of the French Academy,\r\nexpressed to Bailly \"how proud that assembly was to count, among its\r\nmembers an Aristides that no one was tired of calling the Just.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not excite surprise, I hope, by adding, after such brilliant\r\ntestimonies of sympathy, that the inhabitants of Chaillot celebrated the\r\nreturn of Bailly amongst them by fêtes, and fireworks, and that even the\r\ncurate of the parish and the churchwardens, unwilling to be surpassed by\r\ntheir fellow-citizens, nominated the historian of antediluvian astronomy\r\nhonorary churchwarden. I will, at all events, repress the smile that\r\nmight arise from such private reminiscences, by reminding the reader\r\nthat a man's moral character is better appreciated by his neighbours, to\r\nwhom he shows himself daily without disguise, than that of more\r\nconsiderable persons, who are only seen on state occasions, and in\r\nofficial costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY BECOMES MAYOR OF PARIS.--SCARCITY.--MARAT DECLARES HIMSELF\r\nINIMICAL TO THE MAYOR.--EVENTS OF THE 6TH OF OCTOBER.\r\n\r\nThe Bastille had been taken on the 14th of July. That event, on which,\r\nduring upwards of half a century, there have been endless discussions,\r\non opposite sides, was characterized in the following way, in the\r\naddress to the National Assembly, drawn up by M. Moreau de Saint Méry,\r\nin the name of the City Committee:--\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday will be for ever memorable by the taking of a citadel,\r\nconsequent on the Governor's perfidy. The bravery of the people was\r\nirritated by the breaking of the word of honour. This act (the strongest\r\nproof that the nation who knows best how to obey, is jealous of its just\r\nliberties,) has been followed by incidents that from the public\r\nmisfortunes might have been foreseen.\"\r\n\r\nLally Tollendal said to the Parisians, on the 15th of July: \"In the\r\ndisastrous circumstances that have just occurred, we did not cease to\r\nparticipate in your griefs; and we have also participated in your anger;\r\nit was just.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly solicited and obtained permission from the king on\r\nthe 15th of July, to send a deputation to Paris, which they flattered\r\nthemselves would restore order and peace in that great city, then in a\r\nconvulsed state. Madame Bailly, always influenced by fear, endeavoured,\r\nthough vainly, to dissuade her husband from joining the appointed\r\ndeputies. The learned academician naïvely replied, \"After a presidency\r\nthat has been applauded, I am not sorry to show myself to my\r\nfellow-citizens.\" You see, Gentlemen, that Bailly always admits the\r\nfuture reader of his Posthumous Memoirs confidentially into his most\r\nsecret feelings.\r\n\r\nThe deputation completed its mandate at the Town Hall, to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the Parisian populace; the Archbishop of Paris, its\r\nPresident, had already proposed to go in procession to the Cathedral to\r\nsing _Te Deum_; they were preparing to depart, when the Assembly, giving\r\nway to a spontaneous enthusiasm, with an unanimous voice, proclaimed\r\nBailly Mayor of Paris, and Lafayette Commander-in-Chief of the National\r\nGuard, the creation of which had just been authorized.\r\n\r\nThe official minutes of the Municipality state, that on being thus\r\nunexpectedly named, Bailly bent forward to the Assembly, his eyes bathed\r\nin tears, and that amidst his sobs he could only utter a few unconnected\r\nwords to express his gratitude. The Mayor's own recital differs very\r\nlittle from this official relation. Still I shall quote it as a model of\r\nsincerity and of modesty.\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether I wept, I know not what I said; but I remember well\r\nthat I was never so surprised, so confused, and so beneath myself.\r\nSurprise adding to my usual timidity before a large assembly, I rose, I\r\nstammered out a few words that were not heard, and that I did not hear\r\nmyself, but which my agitation, much more than my mouth, rendered\r\nexpressive. Another effect of my sudden stupidity was, that I accepted\r\nwithout knowing what a burden I was taking on myself.\"\r\n\r\nBailly having become Mayor, and being tacitly accepted by the National\r\nAssembly, even from the 16th of July, availed himself of his intimacy\r\nwith Vicq-d'Azyr, the Queen's physician, to persuade Louis XVI. to show\r\nhimself to the Parisians. This advice was listened to. On the 17th the\r\nnew magistrate addressed the king near the barrière de la Conférence, in\r\na discourse that began thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I bring to your Majesty the keys of your good city of Paris. They are\r\nthe same that were presented to Henry IV. He had reconquered his people,\r\nhere the people have reconquered their king.\"\r\n\r\nThe antithesis: \"he had reconquered his people, here the people have\r\nreconquered their king,\" was universally applauded. But since then, it\r\nhas been criticized with bitterness and violence. The enemies of the\r\nRevolution have striven to discover in it an intention of committing an\r\noutrage, to which the character of Bailly, and still more so the first\r\nglance at an examination of the rest of his discourse, give a flat\r\ncontradiction. I will acknowledge, Gentlemen, I think that I have even a\r\nright to decline the epithet of \"unfortunate,\" which one of our most\r\nrespectable colleagues in the French Academy has pronounced relative to\r\nthis celebrated phrase, while doing justice at the same time to the\r\nsentiments of the author. The poison contained in the few words that I\r\nhave quoted, was very inoffensive, since more than a year passed without\r\nany courtier, though furnished like a microscope with, all the\r\nmonarchical susceptibilities, beginning to suspect its existence.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Paris was at the Hôtel de Ville in the midst of those same\r\nParisian citizens who inspired him, a few months before, with the\r\nmortifying reflection already quoted: \"I remarked in the Assembly of\r\nElectors a dislike to literary people and Academicians.\" The feeling did\r\nnot appear to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe political movement in 1789, had been preceded by two very serious\r\nphysical perturbations which had great influence on the march of events.\r\nEvery one is aware, that the excessively rigorous winter of 1788-89 was\r\nthe cause of severe sufferings to the people. But it may not be so\r\ngenerally known, that on the 13th of July, 1788, a fall of hail of\r\nunprecedented size and quantity, in a few hours completely ravaged the\r\ntwo parallel zones lying between the department of the Charente and the\r\nfrontiers of the Pays-Bas, and that in consequence of this frightful\r\nhail, the wheat partly failed, both in the north and in the west of\r\nFrance, until after the harvest of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity was already severely felt, when Bailly on the 15th of July\r\naccepted the appointment of Mayor of Paris. That day, it had been\r\nascertained, from an examination of the quantity of corn at the Market\r\nHall and of the private stocks of the bakers, that the supply of grain\r\nand flour would be entirely exhausted in three days. The next day, the\r\n16th of July, all the overseers in the victualling administration had\r\ndisappeared. This flight, the natural consequence of the terrible\r\nintimidation that hovered over those who were in any way connected with\r\nthe furnishing of provisions, interrupted the operations which had been\r\ncommenced, and exposed the city of Paris to famine.\r\n\r\nBailly, a magistrate of only one day's standing, considered that the\r\nmultitude understands nothing, hears nothing when bread fails; that a\r\nscarcity, either real or supposed, is the great promoter of riots; that\r\nall classes of the population grant their sympathy to whoever cries, _I\r\nam hungry_; that this lamentable cry soon unites individuals of all\r\nages, of both sexes, of every condition, in one common sentiment of\r\nblind fury; that no human power could maintain order and tranquillity in\r\nthe bosom of a population that dreads the want of food; he therefore\r\nresolved to devote his days and his nights to provisioning the capital;\r\nto deserve, as he himself said, the title of the _Father nourisher of\r\nthe Parisians_,--that title of which he showed himself always so proud,\r\nafter having painfully gained it.\r\n\r\nBailly day by day recorded in his Memoirs a statement of his actions, of\r\nhis anxieties, and of his fears. It may be good for the instruction of\r\nthe more fortunate administrators of the present epoch, to insert here a\r\nfew lines from the journal of our colleague.\r\n\r\n\"18th August. Our provisions are very much reduced. Those of the morrow\r\ndepend strictly on the arrangements made on the previous evening; and\r\nnow amidst this distress, we learn that our flour-wagons have been\r\nstopped at Bourg-la-Reine; that some banditti are pillaging the markets\r\nin the direction of Rouen, that they have seized twenty wagons of flour\r\nthat were destined for us; ... that the unfortunate Sauvage was\r\nmassacred at Saint Germain-en-Laye; ... that Thomassin escaped with\r\ndifficulty from the fury of the populace at Choisy.\"\r\n\r\nBy repeating either these literal words, or something equivalent to\r\nthem, for every day of distress throughout the year 1789, an exact idea\r\nmay be formed of the anxieties that Bailly experienced from the morning\r\nafter his installation as mayor. I deceive myself; to complete the\r\npicture we ought also to record the unreflecting and inconsiderate\r\nactions of a multitude of people whose destiny appeared to be, to meddle\r\nwith every thing and to spoil every thing. I will not resist the wish to\r\nshow one of these self-important men, starving (or very nearly so) the\r\ncity of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"21st August. The store of victuals, Bailly says, was so scanty, that\r\nthe lives of the inhabitants of Paris depended on the somewhat\r\nmathematical precision of our arrangements. Having learnt that a barge\r\nwith eighteen hundred sacks of flour had arrived at Poissy, I\r\nimmediately despatched a hundred wagons from Paris to fetch them. And\r\nbehold, in the evening, an officer without powers and without orders,\r\nrelated before me, that having met some wagons on the Poissy road, he\r\nmade them go back, because he did not think that there was a wharf for\r\nany loaded barge on the Seine. It would be difficult for me to describe\r\nthe despair and the anger into which this recital threw me. We were\r\nobliged to put sentinels at the bakers' doors!\"\r\n\r\nThe despair and the anger of Bailly were very natural. Even now, after\r\nmore than half a century, no one thinks without a shudder of that\r\nobscure individual who, from not believing that a loaded barge could get\r\nup to Poissy, was going, on the 21st August, 1789, to plunge the capital\r\ninto bloody disorders.\r\n\r\nBy means of perseverance, devotedness, and courage, Bailly succeeded in\r\novercoming all the difficulties that the real scarcity, and the\r\nfictitious one, which was still more redoubtable, caused daily to arise.\r\nHe succeeded, but his health from that epoch was deeply injured; his\r\nmind had undergone several of those severe shocks that we can never\r\nentirely recover from. Our colleague said, \"when I used to pass the\r\nbakers' shops during the scarcity, and saw them besieged by a crowd, my\r\nheart sunk within me; and even now that abundance has been restored to\r\nus, the sight of one of those shops strikes me with a deep emotion.\"\r\n\r\nThe administrative conflicts, the source of which lay in the very bosom\r\nof the Council of the Commune, daily drew from Bailly the following\r\nexclamation, a faithful image of his mind: _I have ceased to be happy_.\r\nThe embarrassments that proceeded from external sources touched him\r\nmuch less, and yet they were far from contemptible. Let us surmount our\r\nrepugnance, although a reasonable one; let us cast a firm look on the\r\nsink where the unworthy calumnies were manufactured, of which Bailly was\r\nfor some time the object.\r\n\r\nSeveral years before our first revolution, a native of Neufchatel\r\nquitted his mountains, traversed the Jura, and lighted upon Paris.\r\nWithout means, without any recognized talent, without eminence of any\r\nsort, repulsive in appearance, of a more than negligent deportment, it\r\nseemed unlikely that he should hope, or even dream, of success; but the\r\nyoung traveller had been told to have full confidence, although a\r\ncelebrated academician had not yet given that singular definition of our\r\ncountry, \"France is the home of foreigners.\" At all events, the\r\ndefinition was not erroneous in this instance, for soon after his\r\narrival, the Neufchatelois was appointed physician to the household of\r\none of the princes of the royal family, and formed strict intimacies\r\nwith the greater part of the powerful people about the court.\r\n\r\nThis stranger thirsted for literary glory. Amongst his early\r\nproductions, a medico-philosophical work figured in three volumes,\r\nrelative to the reciprocal influences of the mind and the body. The\r\nauthor thought he had produced a _chef d'oeuvre_; even Voltaire was\r\nnot thought to be above analyzing it suitably; let us hasten to say that\r\nthe illustrious old man, yielding to the pressing solicitations of the\r\nDuke de Praslin, one of the most active patrons of the Swiss doctor,\r\npromised to study the work and give his opinion of it.\r\n\r\nThe author was at the acmé of his wishes. After having pompously\r\nannounced that the seat of the soul is in the _meninges_ (cerebral\r\nmembrane), could there be any thing to fear from the liberal thinker of\r\nFerney? He had only forgotten that the patriarch was above all a man of\r\ngood taste, and that the book on the body and soul offended all the\r\nproprieties of life. Voltaire's article appeared. He began with this\r\nsevere and just lesson--\"We should not be prodigal of contempt towards\r\nothers, and of esteem for ourselves, to such a degree as will be\r\nrevolting to our readers.\" The end was still more overwhelming. \"We see\r\nharlequin everywhere cutting capers to amuse the pit.\"\r\n\r\nHarlequin had received a sufficient dose. Not having succeeded in\r\nliterature, he threw himself upon the sciences.\r\n\r\nOn betaking himself to this new career, the doctor of Neufchatel\r\nattacked Newton. But unluckily his criticisms were directed precisely to\r\nthose points wherein optics may vie in evidence with geometry itself.\r\nThis time the patron was M. de Maillebois, and the tribunal the Academy\r\nof Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Academy pronounced its judgment gravely, without inflicting a word\r\nof ridicule; for example, it did not speak of harlequin; but it did not\r\ntherefore remain the less established that the pretended experiments,\r\nintended, it was said, to upset Newton's, on the unequal refrangibility\r\nof variously coloured rays, and the explanation of the rainbow, &c., had\r\nabsolutely no scientific value.\r\n\r\nStill the author would not allow himself to have been beaten. He even\r\nconceived the possibility of retaliation; and, availing himself of his\r\nintimacy with the Duke de Villeroy, governor of the second city in the\r\nkingdom, he got the Academy of Lyons to propose for competition all the\r\nquestions in optics, which for several years past had been the subjects\r\nof its disquisitions; he even furnished the amount of the prize out of\r\nhis own pocket, under an assumed name.\r\n\r\nThe prize so longed for, and so singularly proposed, was not obtained,\r\nhowever, by the Duke de Villeroy's candidate, but by the astronomer\r\nFlaugergues. From that instant, the pseudo-physicist became the bitter\r\nenemy of the scientific bodies of the whole universe, of whoever bore\r\nthe title of an academician. Putting aside all shame, he no longer made\r\nhimself known in the field of natural philosophy, merely by imaginary\r\nexperiments, or by juggleries; he had recourse to contemptible\r\npractices, with the object of throwing doubt upon the clearest and best\r\nproved principles of science; for example, the metallic needles\r\ndiscovered by the academician Charles, and which the foreign doctor had\r\nadroitly concealed in a cake of resin, in order to contradict the common\r\nopinion of the electric non-conductibility of that substance.\r\n\r\nThese details were necessary. I could not avoid characterizing the\r\njournalist who by his daily calumnies contributed most to undermine the\r\npopularity of Bailly. It was requisite besides, once for all, to strip\r\nhim in this circle of the epithet of philosopher, with which men of the\r\nworld, and even some historians, inconsiderately gratified him. When a\r\nman reveals himself by some brilliant and intelligent works, the public\r\nis pleased to find them united with good qualities of the heart. Nor\r\nshould its joy be less hearty on discovering the absence of all\r\nintellectual merit in a man who had before shown himself despicable by\r\nhis passions, or his vices, or even only by serious blemishes of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIf I have not yet named the enemy of our colleague, if I have contented\r\nmyself with recounting his actions, it is in order to avoid as much as I\r\ncan the painful feeling that his name must raise here. Judge,\r\nGentlemen, weigh, my scruples: the furious persecutor of Bailly, of whom\r\nI have been talking to you for some minutes, was Marat.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of '89 just occurred in time to relieve the abortive\r\nauthor, physiologist, and physicist from the intolerable position into\r\nwhich he had been thrown by his inability and his quackery.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the revolution had assumed a decided movement, great surprise\r\nwas occasioned by the sudden transformations excited in the inferior\r\nwalks of the political world. Marat was one of the most striking\r\nexamples of these hasty changes of principles. The Neufchatel physician\r\nhad shown himself a violent adversary to those opinions that occasioned\r\nthe convocation of the assembly of Notables, and the national commotion\r\nin '89. At that time democratical institutions had not a more bitter or\r\nmore violent censor. Marat liked it to be believed that in quitting\r\nFrance for England, he fled especially from the spectacle of social\r\nrenovation which was odious to him. Yet a month after the taking of the\r\nBastille, he returned to Paris, established a journal, and from its very\r\nbeginning left far behind him, even those who, in the hope of making\r\nthemselves remarkable, thought they must push exaggeration to its very\r\nfarthest limits. The former connection of Marat with M. de Calonne was\r\nperfectly well known; they remembered these words of Pitt's: \"The French\r\nmust go through liberty, and then be brought back to their old\r\ngovernment by licence;\" the avowed adversaries of revolution testified\r\nby their conduct, by their votes, and even by their imprudent words,\r\nthat according to them, _the worst_ was the only means of returning to\r\nwhat they call _the good_; and yet these instructive comparisons struck\r\nonly eight or ten members of our great assemblies, so small a share has\r\nsuspicion in the national character, so painful is distrust to French\r\nsincerity. The historians of our troubles themselves have but skimmed\r\nthe question that I have just raised--assuredly a very important and\r\nvery curious one. In such matters, the part of a prophet is tolerably\r\nhazardous; yet I do not hesitate to predict, that a minute study of the\r\nconduct and of the discourses of Marat, would lead the mind more and\r\nmore to those chapters in a treatise on the chase, wherein we see\r\ndepicted bad species of falcons and hawks, at first only pursuing the\r\ngame by a sign from the master, and for his advantage; but by degrees\r\ntaking pleasure in these bloody struggles, and entering on the sport at\r\nlast with passion and for their own profit.\r\n\r\nMarat took good care not to forget that during a revolution, men,\r\nnaturally suspicious, act in their more immediate affairs so as to\r\nrender those persons suspected whose duty it is to watch over them. The\r\nMayor of Paris, the General Commandant of the National Guard, were the\r\nfirst objects, therefore, at which the pamphleteer aimed. As an\r\nacademician, Bailly had an extra claim to his hate.\r\n\r\nAmong men of Marat's disposition, the wounds of self-love never heal.\r\nWithout the hateful passions derived from this source, who would believe\r\nthat an individual, whose time was divided between the superintendence\r\nof a daily journal, the drawing up of innumerable placards with which he\r\ncovered the walls of Paris, together with the struggles of the\r\nConvention, the disputes not less fierce of the clubs; that an\r\nindividual who, besides, had given himself the task of imposing an\r\nAgrarian law on the country, could find time to write the very long\r\nletters against the old official adversaries of his bad experiments, his\r\nabsurd theories, his lucubrations devoid both of erudition and of\r\ntalent; letters in which the Monges, the Laplaces, the Lavoisiers are\r\ntreated with such an entire neglect of justice and of truth, and with\r\nsuch a cynical spirit, that my respect for this assembly prevents my\r\nquoting a single expression.\r\n\r\nIt was not then only the Mayor of Paris whom the pretended friend of the\r\npeople persecuted; it was also the Academician Bailly. But the\r\nillustrious philosopher, the virtuous magistrate, gave no hold for\r\npositive and decided criminations. The hideous pamphleteer understood\r\nthis well; and therefore he adopted vague insinuations, that allowed of\r\nno possible refutation, a method which, we may remark by the way, has\r\nnot been without imitators. Marat exclaimed every day: \"Let Bailly send\r\nin his accounts!\" and the most powerful figure of rhetoric, as Napoleon\r\nsaid, repetition, finally inspires doubts in a stupid portion of the\r\npublic, in some feeble, ignorant, and credulous minds in the Council of\r\nthe Commune; and the scrupulous magistrate wished, in fact, to send in\r\nhis accounts. Here they are in two lines: Bailly never had the handling\r\nof any public funds. He left the Hôtel de Ville, after having spent\r\nthere two thirds of his patrimony. If his functions had been long\r\nprotracted, he would have retired completely ruined. Before the Commune\r\nassigned him any salary, the expenses of our colleague in charities\r\nalready exceeded 30,000 livres.\r\n\r\nThat was, Gentlemen, the final result. The details would be more\r\nstriking, and the name of Bailly would ennoble them. I could show our\r\ncolleague entering only once with his wife, to regulate the furnishing\r\nof the apartments that the Commune assigned him; rejecting all that had\r\nthe appearance of luxury or even of elegance; to replace sets of china\r\nby sets of earthenware, new carpets by the half-used ones of M. de\r\nCrosnes, writing tables of mahogany by writing tables of walnut, &c. But\r\nall this would appear an indirect criticism, which is far from my\r\nthoughts. From the same motives, I will not say, that inimical to all\r\nsinecures, of all plurality of appointments, when the functions are not\r\nfulfilled, the Mayor of Paris, since he no longer regularly attended the\r\nmeetings of the National Assembly, no longer fingered the pay of a\r\ndeputy, and that this was proved, to the great confusion of the idiots,\r\nwhose minds had been disturbed by Marat's clamours. Yet I will record\r\nthat Bailly refused all that in the incomes of his predecessors had\r\nproceeded from an impure source; as, for example, the allowances from\r\nthe lotteries, the amount of which was by his orders constantly paid\r\ninto the coffers of the Commune.\r\n\r\nYou see, Gentlemen, that no trouble was required to show that the\r\ndisinterestedness of Bailly was great, enlightened, dictated by virtue,\r\nand that it was at least equal to his other eminent qualities. In the\r\nseries of accusations that I have extracted from the pamphlets of that\r\nepoch, there is one, however, as to which, all things considered, I will\r\nnot attempt to defend Bailly. He accepted a livery from the city; on\r\nthis point no blame was attached to him; but the colours of the livery\r\nwere very gaudy. Perhaps the inventors of these bright shades had\r\nimagined, that the insignia of the first magistrate of the metropolis,\r\nin a ceremony, in a crowd, should, like the light from a Pharos, strike\r\neven inattentive eyes. But these explanations regard those who would\r\nmake of Bailly a perfectly rational being, a man absolutely faultless;\r\nI, although his admirer, I resign myself to admit that in a laborious\r\nlife, strewed with so many rocks, he committed the horrible crime,\r\nunpardonable let it be called, of having accepted from the Commune a\r\nlivery of gaudy colours.\r\n\r\nBailly figured in the events of the month of October 1789, only by the\r\nunsuccessful efforts he made at Paris, to arrange with Lafayette how to\r\nprevent a great crowd of women from going to Versailles. When this\r\ncrowd, considerably increased, returned on the 6th October very\r\ntumultuously escorting the carriages of the royal family, Bailly\r\nharangued the king at the Barrière de la Conférence. Three days after,\r\nhe also complimented the Queen at the Tuileries in the name of the\r\nMunicipal Council.\r\n\r\nOn retiring from the National Assembly, which he then called a Cavern of\r\nAnthropophagi, Lally Tollendal published a letter in which he found\r\nbitter fault with Bailly on account of these discourses. Lally was\r\nangry, recollecting that the day when the king reëntered his capital as\r\na prisoner, surrounded by a very disrespectful crowd, and preceded by\r\nthe heads of his body-guards, had appeared to Bailly a fine day!\r\n\r\nIf the two heads had been in the procession, Bailly becomes inexcusable;\r\nbut the two epochs, or rather hours (to speak more correctly), have been\r\nconfounded; the wretched men, who after a conflict with the body-guard,\r\nbrought their barbarous trophies to Paris, left Versailles in the\r\nmorning; they were arrested and imprisoned, by order of the\r\nmunicipality, as soon as they had entered the barriers of the capital.\r\nThus the hideous circumstance reported by Lally was the dream of a wild\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT THE POSTHUMOUS MEMOIR OF BAILLY.\r\n\r\nBailly's Memoirs have thus far served me as a guide and check; now that\r\nthis resource fails me, let us refer to his posthumous work.\r\n\r\nI could only consult those Memoirs as far as they related to the public\r\nor private life of our colleague. Historians may consult them in a more\r\ngeneral point of view. They will find some valuable facts in them,\r\nrelated without prejudice; ample matter for new and fruitful reflections\r\non the way in which revolutions are generated, increase, and lead to\r\ncatastrophes. Bailly is less positive, less absolute, less slashing,\r\nthan the generality of his contemporaries, even respecting those events\r\nin which circumstances assigned to him the principal part to be acted;\r\nhence when he points out some low intrigue, in distinct and categorical\r\nterms, he inspires full confidence.\r\n\r\nWhen the occasion will allow of it, Bailly praises with enthusiasm; a\r\nnoble action fills him with joy; he puts it together and relates it with\r\nrelish. This disposition of mind is sufficiently rare to deserve\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nThe day, still far off, when we shall finally recognize that our great\r\nrevolution presented, even in the interior, even during the most cruel\r\nepochs, something besides anarchical and sanguinary scenes: the day\r\nwhen, like the intrepid fishermen in the Gulf of Persia and on the\r\ncoasts of Ceylon, a zealous and impartial writer will consent to plunge\r\nhead-foremost into the ocean of facts of all sorts, of which our fathers\r\nwere witnesses, and exclusively seize the pearls, disdainfully rejecting\r\nthe mud,--Bailly's Memoirs will furnish a glorious contingent to this\r\nnational work. Two or three quotations will explain my ideas, and will\r\nshow, besides, how scrupulously Bailly registered all that could shed\r\nhonour on our country.\r\n\r\nI will take the first fact from the military annals; a grenadier of the\r\nFrench Guard saves his commanding officer's life, although the people\r\nthought that they had great reason of complaint against him. \"Grenadier,\r\nwhat is your name?\" exclaimed the Duke de Châtelet, full of gratitude.\r\nThe soldier replied, \"Colonel, my name is that of all my comrades.\"\r\n\r\nI will borrow the second fact from the civil annals: Stephen de\r\nLarivière, one of the electors of Paris, had gone on the 20th of July,\r\nto fetch Berthier de Sauvigny, who had been fatally arrested at\r\nCompiègne, on the false report that the Assembly of the Town Hall wished\r\nto prosecute him as intendant of the army, by which a few days before\r\nthe capital had been surrounded. The journey was performed in an open\r\ncabriolet, amidst the insults of a misled population, who imputed to the\r\nprisoner the scarcity and bad quality of the bread. Twenty times, guns,\r\npistols, sabres, would have put an end to Berthier's life, if, twenty\r\ntimes, the member of the Commune of Paris had not voluntarily covered\r\nhim with his body. When they reached the streets of the capital, the\r\ncabriolet had to penetrate through an immense and compact crowd, whose\r\nexasperation bordered on delirium, and who evidently wished to\r\nperpetrate the utmost extremities; not knowing which of the two\r\ntravellers was the Intendant of Paris, they betook themselves to crying\r\nout, \"let the prisoner take off his hat!\" Berthier obeyed, but Larivière\r\nuncovered his head also at the same instant.\r\n\r\nAll parties would gain by the production of a work, that I desire to see\r\nmost earnestly. For my part, I acknowledge, I should be sorry not to\r\nsee in it the answer made to Francis II. by one of the numerous officers\r\nwho committed the fault, so honestly acknowledged afterwards,--a fault\r\nthat no one would commit now,--that of joining foreigners in arms. The\r\nAustrian prince, after his coronation, attempted, at a review, to induce\r\nour countrymen to admire the good bearing of his troops, and finally\r\nexclaimed, \"There are materials wherewith to crush the Sans-culottes.\"\r\n\"That remains to be seen!\" instantly answered the émigré officer.\r\n\r\nMay these quotations lead some able writer to erect a monument still\r\nwanting to the glory of our country! There is in this subject, it seems\r\nto me, enough to inspire legitimate ambition. Did not Plutarch\r\nimmortalize himself by preserving noble actions and fine sentiments from\r\noblivion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF BAILLY'S ADMINISTRATION AS MAYOR.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Mayor of Paris had not the leisure to continue writing\r\nhis reminiscences beyond the date of the 2d of October, 1789. The\r\nanalysis and appreciation of the events subsequent to that epoch will\r\nremain deprived of that influential sanction, pure as virtue, concise\r\nand precise as truth, which I found in the handwriting of our colleague.\r\nXenocrates, historians say, who was celebrated among the Greeks for his\r\nhonesty, being called to bear witness before a tribunal, the judges with\r\ncommon consent stopped him as he was advancing towards the altar\r\naccording to the usual custom, and said, \"These formalities are not\r\nrequired from you; an oath would add nothing to the authority of your\r\nwords.\" Such, Bailly presents himself to the reader of his Posthumous\r\nMemoirs. None of his assertions leave any room for indecision or doubt.\r\nHe needs not high-flown expressions or protestations in order to\r\nconvince; nor would an oath add authority to his words. He may be\r\ndeceived, but he is never the deceiver.\r\n\r\nI will spare no effort to give to the description of the latter part of\r\nBailly's life, all the correctness which can result from a sincere and\r\nconscientious comparison of the writings published as well by the\r\npartisans as by the enemies of our great revolution. Such, however, is\r\nmy desire to prevent two phases, though very distinct, being confounded\r\ntogether, that I shall here pause, in order to cast a scrupulous glance\r\non the actions and on the various publications of our colleague. I shall\r\nmoreover thus have an easy opportunity of filling up some important\r\nlacunæ.\r\n\r\nI read in a biographical article, otherwise very friendly, that Bailly\r\nwas nominated the very day of, and immediately after, the assassination\r\nof M. de Flesselles; and in this identity the wish was to insinuate that\r\nthe first Mayor of Paris received this high dignity from the bloody\r\nhands of a set of wretches. The learned biographer, notwithstanding his\r\ngood will, has ill repelled the calumny. With a little more attention he\r\nwould have succeeded better. A simple comparison of dates would have\r\nsufficed. The death of M. de Flesselles occurred on the 14th of July;\r\nBailly was nominated two days after.\r\n\r\nI will address the same remark to the authors of a Biographical\r\nDictionary still more recent, in which they speak of the ineffectual\r\nefforts that Bailly made to prevent the multitude from murdering the\r\ngovernor of the Bastille (de Launay). But Bailly had no opportunity of\r\nmaking an effort, for he was then at Versailles; no duty called him to\r\nParis, nor did he become Mayor till two days after the taking of the\r\nfortress. It is really inexcusable not to have compared the two dates,\r\nby which these errors would have been avoided.\r\n\r\nMany persons very little acquainted with contemporaneous history, fancy\r\nthat during the whole duration of Bailly's administration, Paris was\r\nquite a cut-throat place. That is a romance; the following is the\r\ntruth:--\r\n\r\nBailly was Mayor during two years and four months. In that time there\r\noccurred four political assassinations; those of Foulon and of Berthier\r\nde Sauvigny, his son-in-law, at the Hôtel de Ville; that of M. Durocher,\r\na respectable officer of the gendarmerie, killed at Chaillot, by a\r\nmusket-shot, in August, 1789; and that of a baker massacred in a riot in\r\nthe month of October of the same year. I do not speak of the\r\nassassination of two unfortunate men on the Champ de Mars in July, 1791,\r\nas that deplorable fact must be considered separately.\r\n\r\nThe individuals guilty of the assassination of the baker were seized,\r\ncondemned to death, and executed. The family of the unfortunate victim\r\nbecame the object of the anxious care of all the authorities, and\r\nobtained a pension.\r\n\r\nThe death of M. Durocher was attributed to some Swiss soldiers who had\r\nrevolted.\r\n\r\nThe horrible and ever to be deplored assassinations of Foulon and of\r\nBerthier, are among those misfortunes which, under certain given\r\ncircumstances, no human power could prevent.\r\n\r\nIn times of scarcity, a slight word, either true or unfounded, suffices\r\nto create a terrible commotion.\r\n\r\nRéveillon is made to say, that a workman can live upon fifteen sous per\r\ndiem, and behold his manufactory destroyed from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThey ascribe to Foulon the barbarous vaunt; \"I will force the people to\r\neat hay;\" and without any order from the constituted authorities, some\r\npeasants, neighbours of the old minister, arrest him, take him to Paris,\r\nhis son-in-law experiences the same fate, and the famished populace\r\nimmolates both of them.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the multitude appear to me unjust and culpable, in\r\nattacking certain men respecting a scarcity of provisions, when it is\r\nthe manifest consequence of the severity of the seasons, I should be\r\ndisposed to excuse their rage against the authors of factitious\r\nscarcities. Well, Gentlemen, at the time that Foulon was assassinated,\r\nthe people, deceived by some impassioned orators of the Assembly, might,\r\nor let us rather say, ought to believe, that they were wilfully\r\nfamished. Foulon perished the 22d of July, 1789; on the 15th, that is to\r\nsay, seven days before, Mirabeau had addressed the following incendiary\r\nwords to the inhabitants of the capital, from the National Tribune:--\r\n\r\n\"Henry IV. allowed provisions to be taken into besieged and rebellious\r\nParis; but now, some perverse ministers intercept convoys of provisions\r\ndestined for famished and obedient Paris.\"\r\n\r\nYet people have been so inconsiderate as to be astonished at the\r\nassassinations of Foulon and of Berthier. Going back in thought to the\r\nmonth of July, 1789, I perceive in the imprudent apostrophe of the\r\neloquent tribune, more sanguinary disorders than the contemporary\r\nhistory has had to record.\r\n\r\nOne of the most honourable, one of the most respectable and the most\r\nrespected members of the institute, having been led, in a recent work,\r\nto relate the assassination of Foulon, has thrown on the conduct of\r\nBailly, under those cruel circumstances, an aspersion that I read with\r\nsurprise and grief. Foulon was detained in the Hôtel de Ville. Bailly\r\nwent down into the square, and succeeded for a moment in calming the\r\nmultitude. \"I did not imagine,\" said the Mayor in his memoirs, \"that\r\nthey could have forced the Hôtel de Ville, a well-guarded post, and an\r\nobject of respect to all the citizens. I therefore thought the prisoner\r\nin perfect safety; I did not doubt but the waves of this storm would\r\nfinally subside, and I departed.\"\r\n\r\nThe honourable author of the _History of the Reign of Louis XVI._\r\nopposes to this passage the following words taken from the official\r\nminutes of the Hôtel de Ville: \"The electors (those who had accompanied\r\nBailly out to the square) reported in the Hall the certainty that the\r\ncalm would not last long.\" The new historian adds: \"How could the Mayor\r\nalone labour under this delusion? It is too evident, that on such a day,\r\nthe public tranquillity was much too uncertain, to allow of the chief\r\nmagistrate of the town absenting himself without deserving the reproach\r\nof weakness.\" The remainder of the passage shows too evidently, that in\r\nthe author's estimation, weakness here was synonymous with cowardice.\r\n\r\nIt is against this, Gentlemen, that I protest with heartfelt\r\nearnestness. Bailly absented himself because he did not think that the\r\nHôtel de Ville could be forced. The electors in the passage quoted do\r\nnot enunciate a different opinion: where then is the contradiction?\r\n\r\nBailly deceived himself in this expectation, for the multitude burst\r\ninto the Hôtel de Ville. We will grant that there was an error of\r\njudgment in this; but nothing in the world authorizes us to call in\r\nquestion the courage of the Mayor.\r\n\r\nTo decide after the blow, with so little hesitation or consideration,\r\nthat Bailly ought not to have absented himself from the House of the\r\nCommune, we must forget that, under such circumstances, the obligations\r\nof the first magistrate of the city were quite imperious and very\r\nnumerous; it is requisite, above all, not to remember that each day, the\r\nprovision of flour required for the nourishment of seven or eight\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants, depended on the measures adopted on the\r\nprevious evening. M. de Crosne, who on quitting the post of Lieutenant\r\nof Police, had not ceased to be a citizen, was during some days a very\r\nenlightened and zealous councillor for Bailly; but on the day that\r\nFoulon was arrested, this dismissed magistrate thought himself lost. He\r\nand his family made an appeal to the gratitude and humanity of our\r\ncolleague. It was to procure a refuge for them, that Bailly employed the\r\nfew hours of absence with which he was so much reproached: those hours\r\nduring which that catastrophe happened which the Mayor could not have\r\nprevented, since even the superhuman efforts of General Lafayette,\r\ncommanding an armed force, proved futile. I will add, that to spare M.\r\nde Crosne an arbitrary arrest, the imminent danger of which alas! was\r\ntoo evident in the death of Berthier, Bailly absented himself again from\r\nthe Hôtel de Ville on the night of the 22d to the 23d of July, to\r\naccompany the former Lieutenant of Police to a great distance from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThere is not a more distressing spectacle than that of one honest man\r\nwrongfully attacking another honest man. Gentlemen, let us never\r\nwillingly leave the satisfaction and the advantage of it to the wicked.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the actions of our predecessors with impartiality and\r\njustice, it would be indispensable to keep constantly before our eyes\r\nthe list of unheard-of difficulties that the revolution had to surmount,\r\nand to remember the very restricted means of repression placed at the\r\ndisposal of the authorities in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of food gave rise to many embarrassments, to many a crisis;\r\nbut causes of quite another nature had not less influence on the march\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nIn his memoirs, Bailly speaks of the manoeuvres of a redoubtable\r\nfaction labouring for ... under the name of the.... The names are blank.\r\nA certain editor of the work filled up the lacunæ. I have not the same\r\nhardihood, I only wished to remark that Bailly had to combat at once\r\nboth the spontaneous effervescence of the multitude, and the intrigues\r\nof a crowd of secret agents, who distributed money with a liberal hand.\r\n\r\nSome day, said our colleague, the infernal genius who directed those\r\nintrigues and _le bailleur de fonds_ will be known. Although the proper\r\nnames are wanting, it is certain that some persons inimical to the\r\nrevolution urged it to deplorable excesses.\r\n\r\nThese enemies had collected in the capital thirty or forty thousand\r\nvagabonds. What could be opposed to them? The Tribunals? They had no\r\nmoral power, and were declared enemies to the revolution. The National\r\nGuard? It was only just formed; the officers scarcely knew each other,\r\nand moreover scarcely knew the men who were to obey them. Was it at\r\nleast permitted to depend on the regular armed force? It consisted of\r\nsix battalions of French Guards without officers; of six thousand\r\nsoldiers who, from every part of France, had flocked singly to Paris, on\r\nreading in the newspapers the following expressions from General\r\nLafayette: \"They talk of deserters! The real deserters are those men who\r\nhave not abandoned their standards.\" There were finally six hundred\r\nSwiss Guards in Paris, deserters from their regiments; for, let us speak\r\nfreely, the celebrated monument of Lucerne will not prevent the Swiss\r\nthemselves from being recognized by impartial and intelligent\r\nhistorians, as having experienced the revolutionary fever.\r\n\r\nThose who, with such poor means of repression, flattered themselves that\r\nthey could entirely prevent any disorder, in a town of seven or eight\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants in exasperation, must have been very blind.\r\nThose, on the other hand, who attempt to throw the responsibility of the\r\ndisorders on Bailly, would prove by this alone, that good people should\r\nalways keep aloof from public affairs during a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe administrator, a being of modern creation, now declares, with the\r\nmost ludicrous self-sufficiency, that Bailly was not equal to the\r\nfunctions of a Mayor of Paris. It is, he says, by undeserved favour that\r\nhis statue has been placed on the façade of the Hôtel de Ville. During\r\nhis magistracy, Bailly did not create any large square in the capital,\r\nhe did not open out any large streets, he elevated no splendid monument;\r\nBailly would therefore have done better had he remained an astronomer or\r\nerudite scholar.\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of all the public erections that Bailly did not execute\r\nis correct. It might also have been added, that far from devoting the\r\nmunicipal funds to building, he had the vast and threatening castle of\r\nthe Bastille demolished down to its very foundation's; but this would\r\nnot deprive Bailly of the honour of having been one of the most\r\nenlightened magistrates that the city of Paris could boast.\r\n\r\nBailly did not enlarge any street, did not erect any palace during the\r\ntwenty-eight months of his administration! No, undoubtedly! for, first\r\nit was necessary to give bread to the inhabitants of Paris; now the\r\nrevenues of the town, added to the daily sums furnished by Necker,\r\nscarcely sufficed for those principal wants. Some years before, the\r\nParisians had been very much displeased at the establishment of import\r\ndues on all alimentary substances. The writers of that epoch preserved\r\nthe burlesque Alexandrine, which was placarded all over the town, on the\r\nerection of the Octroi circumvallation:\r\n\r\n     \"Le mur murant Paris, rend Paris murmurant.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe multitude was not content with murmuring; the moment that a\r\nfavourable opportunity occurred, it went to the barriers and broke them\r\ndown. These were reëstablished by the administration with great trouble,\r\nand the smugglers often took them down by main force. The _Octroi_\r\nrevenue from the imports, which used to amount to 70,000 francs, now\r\nfell to less than 30,000. Those persons who have considered the figures\r\nof the present revenue, will assuredly not compare such very dissimilar\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that ameliorations in the moral world may often be\r\neffected without expense. What were those for which the public was\r\nindebted to the direct exertions of Bailly? The question is simple, but\r\nrepentance will follow the having asked it. My answer is this: One of\r\nthe most honourable victories gained by mathematics over the avaricious\r\nprejudices of the administrations of certain towns has been, in our own\r\ntimes, the radical suppression of gambling-houses. I will hasten to\r\nprove that such a suppression had already engaged Bailly's attention,\r\nthat he had partly effected it, and that no one ever spoke of those\r\nodious dens with more eloquence and firmness.\r\n\r\n\"I declare,\" wrote the Mayor of Paris on the 5th of May, 1790, \"that the\r\ngambling-houses are in my opinion a public scourge. I think that these\r\nmeetings not only should not be tolerated, but that they ought to be\r\nsought out and prosecuted, as much as the liberty of the citizens, and\r\nthe respect due to their homes, will admit.\r\n\r\n\"I regard the tax that has been levied from such houses as a disgraceful\r\ntribute. I do not think that it is allowable to employ a revenue derived\r\nfrom vice and disorder, even to do good. In consequence of these\r\nprinciples, I have never granted any permit to gambling-houses; I have\r\nconstantly refused them. I have constantly announced that not only they\r\nwould not be tolerated, but that they would be sought out and\r\nprosecuted.\"\r\n\r\nIf I add that Bailly suppressed all spectacles of animal-fighting, at\r\nwhich the multitude cannot fail to acquire ferocious and sanguinary\r\nhabits, I shall have a right to ask of every superficial writer, how he\r\nwould justify the epithet of sterile, applied with such assurance to the\r\nadministration of our virtuous colleague.\r\n\r\nAnxious to carry out in practice that which had been largely recognized\r\ntheoretically in the declaration of rights--the complete separation of\r\nreligion from civil law,--Bailly presented himself before the National\r\nAssembly on the 14th of May, 1791, and demanded, in the name of the city\r\nof Paris, the abolition of an order of things which, in the then state\r\nof men's minds, gave rise to great abuses. If declarations of births, of\r\nmarriages, and of deaths are now received by civil officers in a form\r\nagreeing with all religious opinions, the country is chiefly indebted\r\nfor it to the intelligent firmness of Bailly.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate beings for whom all public men should feel most\r\nsolicitous, are those prisoners who are awaiting in prison the decrees\r\nof the courts of justice. Bailly took care not to neglect such a duty.\r\nAt the end of 1790, the old tribunals had no moral power; they could no\r\nlonger act; the new ones were not yet created. This state of affairs\r\ndistracted the mind of our colleague. On the 18th of November, he\r\nexpressed his grief to the National Assembly, in terms full of\r\nsensibility and kindness. I should be culpable if I left them in\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, the prisons are full. The innocent are awaiting their\r\njustification, and the criminals an end to their remorse. All breathe an\r\nunwholesome air, and disease will pronounce terrible decrees. Despair\r\ndwells there: Despair says, either give me death, or judge me. When we\r\nvisit those prisons, that is what the fathers of the poor and the\r\nunfortunate hear; this is what it is their duty to repeat to the fathers\r\nof their country. We must tell them that in those asylums of crime, of\r\nmisery, and of every grief, time is infinite in its duration; a month is\r\na century, a month is an abyss the sight of which is frightful.... We\r\nask of the tribunals to empty the prisons by the justification of the\r\ninnocent, or by examples of justice.\"\r\n\r\nDoes it not appear to you, Gentlemen, that calm times may occasionally\r\nderive excellent lessons, and, moreover, lessons expressed in very good\r\nlanguage, from our revolutionary epoch?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[13] \"The wall walling Paris, renders Paris wailing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S FLIGHT.--EVENTS ON THE CHAMP DE MARS.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1791, Bailly perceived that his influence over\r\nthe Parisian population was decreasing. The king had announced that he\r\nshould depart on the 18th, and would remain some days at St. Cloud. The\r\nstate of his health was the ostensible cause of his departure. Some\r\nreligious scruples were probably the real cause; the holy week was\r\napproaching, and the king would have no communications with the\r\necclesiastics sworn in for his parish. Bailly was not discomposed at\r\nthis projected journey; he regarded it even with satisfaction. Foreign\r\ncourts, said our colleague, looked upon him as a prisoner. The sanction\r\nhe gives to various decrees, appears to them extorted by violence; the\r\nvisit of Louis XVI. to Saint Cloud will dissipate all these false\r\nreports. Bailly therefore concerted measures with La Fayette for the\r\ndeparture of the royal family; but the inhabitants of Paris, less\r\nconfiding than their mayor, already saw the king escaping from St.\r\nCloud, and seeking refuge amidst foreign armies. They therefore rushed\r\nto the Tuileries, and notwithstanding all the efforts of Bailly and his\r\ncolleague, the court carriages could not advance a step. The king and\r\nqueen therefore, after waiting for an hour and a half in their carriage,\r\nreascended into the palace.\r\n\r\nTo remain in power after such a check, was giving to the country the\r\nmost admirable proof of devotion.\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 20th to the 21st of June, 1791, the king quitted the\r\nTuileries. This flight, so fatal to the monarchy, irretrievably\r\ndestroyed the ascendency that Bailly had exercised over the capital. The\r\npopulace usually judges from the event. The king, they said, with the\r\nqueen and their two children, were freely allowed to go out of the\r\npalace. The Mayor of Paris was their accomplice, for he has the means of\r\nknowing every thing; otherwise he might be accused of carelessness, or\r\nof the most culpable negligence.\r\n\r\nThese attacks were not only echoed in the shops, in the streets, but\r\nalso in the strongly organized clubs. The Mayor answered in a peremptory\r\nmanner, but without entirely effacing the first impression. During\r\nseveral days after the king's flight, both Bailly and La Fayette were in\r\npersonal danger. The National Assembly had often to look to their\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nI have now reached a painful portion of my task, a frightful event, that\r\nled finally to Bailly's cruel death; a bloody catastrophe, the relation\r\nof which will perhaps oblige me to allow a little blame to hover over\r\nsome actions of this virtuous citizen, whom thus far it has been my\r\ndelight to praise without any restriction.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the king had an immense influence on the progress of our\r\nfirst revolution. It threw into the republican party some considerable\r\npolitical characters who, till then, had hoped to realize the union of a\r\nmonarchy with democratical principles.\r\n\r\nMirabeau, a short time before his death, having heard this projected\r\nflight spoken of, said to Cabanis: \"I have defended monarchy to the\r\nlast; I defend it still, although I think it lost.... But, if the king\r\ndeparts, I will mount the tribune, have the throne declared vacant, and\r\nproclaim a Republic.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the return from Varennes, the project of substituting a republican\r\ngovernment for a monarchical government was very seriously discussed by\r\nthe most moderate members of the National Assembly, and we now know\r\nthat the Duke de La Rochefoucauld and Dupont (de Némours) for example,\r\nwere decidedly in favour of a republic. But it was chiefly in the clubs\r\nthat the idea of such a radical change had struck root. When the\r\nCommission of the National Assembly had expressed itself, through M.\r\nMuguet, at the sitting of the 13th of July, 1791, against the forfeiture\r\nof Louis XVI., there was a great fermentation in Paris. Some agents of\r\nthe Cordeliers (Shoemakers') Club were the first to ask for signatures\r\nto a petition on the 14th of July, against the proposed decision. The\r\nAssembly refused to read and even to receive it. On the motion of\r\nLaclos, the club of the Jacobins got up another. This, after undergoing\r\nsome important modifications, was to be signed on the 17th on the Champ\r\nde Mars, on the altar of their country. These projects were discussed\r\nopenly, in full daylight. The National Assembly deemed them anarchical.\r\nOn the 16th of July it called to its bar the municipality of Paris,\r\nenjoining it to have recourse to force, if requisite, to repress any\r\nculpable movements.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Commune on the morning of the 17th placarded a\r\nproclamation that it had prepared according to the orders of the\r\nNational Assembly. Some municipal officers went about preceded by a\r\ntrumpeter, to read it in various public squares. Around the Hotel de\r\nVille, the military arrangements, commanded by La Fayette, led to the\r\nexpectation of a sanguinary conflict. All at once, on the opening of the\r\nsitting of the National Assembly, a report was circulated that two good\r\ncitizens having dared to tell the people collected around their\r\ncountry's altar, that they must obey the law, had been put to death, and\r\nthat their heads, stuck upon pikes, were carried through the streets.\r\nThe news of this attack excited the indignation of all the deputies, and\r\nunder this impression, Alexander Lameth, then President of the Assembly,\r\nof his own accord transmitted to Bailly very severe new orders, a\r\ncircumstance which, though only said _en passant_, has been but recently\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe municipal body, as soon as it was informed, about eleven o'clock, of\r\nthe two assassinations, deputed three of its members, furnished with\r\nfull powers, to reëstablish order. Strong detachments accompanied the\r\nmunicipal officers. About two o'clock it was reported that stones had\r\nbeen thrown at the National Guard. The Municipal Council instantly had\r\nmartial law proclaimed on the Place de Grève, and the red flag suspended\r\nfrom the principal window of the Hôtel de Ville. At half-past five\r\no'clock, just when the municipal body was about to start for the Champ\r\nde Mars, the three councillors, who had been sent in the morning to the\r\nscene of disorder, returned, accompanied by a deputation of twelve\r\npersons, taken from among the petitioners. The explanations given on\r\nvarious sides occasioned a new deliberation of the Council. The first\r\ndecision was maintained, and at six o'clock the municipality began its\r\nmarch with the red flag, three pieces of cannon, and numerous\r\ndetachments of the National Guard.\r\n\r\nBailly, as chief of the municipality, found himself at this time in one\r\nof those solemn and perilous situations, in which a man becomes\r\nresponsible in the eyes of a whole nation, in the eyes of posterity, for\r\nthe inconsiderate or even culpable actions of the passionate multitude\r\nthat surrounds him, but which he scarcely knows, and over which he has\r\nlittle or no influence.\r\n\r\nThe National Guard, in that early epoch of the revolution, was very\r\ntroublesome to lead and to rule. Insubordination appeared to be the rule\r\nin its ranks; and hierarchical obedience a very rare exception. My\r\nremark may perhaps appear severe: well, Gentlemen, read the contemporary\r\nwritings, Grimm's Correspondence, for example, and you will see, under\r\ndate of November 1790, a dismissed captain replying to the regrets of\r\nhis company in the following style: \"Console yourselves, my companions,\r\nI shall not quit you; only, henceforward I shall be a simple fusilier;\r\nif you see me resolved to be no longer your chief, it is because I am\r\ncontent to command in my turn.\"\r\n\r\nIt is allowable besides to suppose that the National Guard of 1791 was\r\ndeficient, in the presence of such crowds, of that patience, that\r\nclemency, of which the French troops of the line have often given such\r\nperfect examples. It was not aware that, in a large city, crowds are\r\nchiefly composed of the unemployed and the idly curious.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven o'clock when the municipal body arrived at the\r\nChamp de Mars. Immediately some individuals placed on the glacis\r\nexclaimed: \"Down with the red flag! down with the bayonettes!\" and threw\r\nsome stones. There was even a gun fired. A volley was fired in the air\r\nto frighten them; but the cries soon recommenced; again some stones were\r\nthrown; then only the fatal fusillade of the National Guard began!\r\n\r\nThese, Gentlemen, are the deplorable events of the Champ de Mars,\r\nfaithfully analyzed from the relation that Bailly himself gave of the\r\n18th July to the Constituent Assembly. This recital, the truth of which\r\nno one assuredly will question any more than myself, labours under some\r\ninvoluntary but very serious omissions. I will indicate them, when the\r\nmarch of events leads us, in following our unfortunate colleague, to the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY QUITS THE MAYORALTY THE 12TH OF NOVEMBER, 1791.--THE\r\nESCHEVINS.--EXAMINATION OF THE REPROACHES THAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED TO THE\r\nMAYOR.\r\n\r\nI resume the biography of Bailly at the time when he quitted the Hôtel\r\nde Ville after a magistracy of about two years.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th November, 1791, Bailly convoked the Council of the Commune,\r\nrendered an account of his administration, solemnly entreated those who\r\nthought themselves entitled to complain of him, to say so without\r\nreserve; so resolved was he to bow to any legitimate complaints;\r\ninstalled his successor Pétion, and retired. This separation did not\r\nlead to any of those heartfelt demonstrations from the co-labourers of\r\nthe late Mayor, which are the true and the sweetest recompense to a good\r\nman.\r\n\r\nI have sought for the hidden cause of such a constant and undisguised\r\nhostility towards the first Mayor of Paris. I asked myself first,\r\nwhether the magistrate's manners had possibly excited the\r\nsusceptibilities of the Eschevins.[14] The answer is decidedly in the\r\nnegative. Bailly showed in all the relations of life a degree of\r\npatience, a suavity, a deference to the opinions of others, that would\r\nhave soothed the most irascible self-love.\r\n\r\nMust we suspect jealousy to have been at work? No, no; the persons who\r\nconstituted the town-council were too obscure, unless they were mad, to\r\nattempt to vie in public consideration and glory with the illustrious\r\nauthor of _the History of Astronomy_, with the philosopher, the writer,\r\nthe erudite scholar who belonged to our three principal academies, an\r\nhonour that Fontenelle alone had enjoyed before him.\r\n\r\nLet us say it aloud, for such is our conviction, nothing personal\r\nexcited the evil proceedings, the acts of insubordination with which\r\nBailly had daily to reproach his numerous assistants. It is even\r\npresumable, that in his position, any one else would have had to\r\nregister more numerous and more serious complaints. Let us be truthful:\r\nwhen the _aristocracy of the ground-floor_, according to the expression\r\nof one of the most illustrious members of the French Academy, was called\r\nby the revolutionary movements to replace the _aristocracy of the\r\nfirst-floor_, it became giddy. Have I not, it said, conducted the\r\nbusiness of the warehouse, the workshop, the counting-house, &c., with\r\nprobity and success; why then should I not equally succeed in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs? And this swarm of new statesmen were in a\r\nhurry to commence work; hence all control was irksome to them, and each\r\nwished to be able to say on returning home, \"I have framed such or such\r\nan act that will tie the hands of faction for ever; I have repressed\r\nthis or that riot; I have, in short, saved the country by proposing such\r\nor such a measure for the public good, and by having it adopted.\" The\r\npronoun _I_ so agreeably tickles the ear of a man lately risen from\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nWhat the thorough-bred Eschevin, whether new or old, dreads above every\r\nthing else, is specialties. He has an insurmountable antipathy towards\r\nmen, who have in the face of the world gained the honourable titles of\r\nhistorian, geometer, mechanician, astronomer, physician, chemist, or\r\ngeologist, &c.... His desire, his will, is to speak on every thing. He\r\nrequires, therefore, colleagues who cannot contradict him.\r\n\r\nIf the town constructs an edifice, the Eschevin, losing sight of the\r\nquestion, talks away on the aspect of the façades. He declares with the\r\nimperturbable assurance inspired by a fact that he had heard speak of\r\nwhilst on the knees of his nurse, that on a particular side of the\r\nfuture building, the moon, an active agent of destruction, will\r\nincessantly corrode the stones of the frontage, the shafts of the\r\ncolumns, and that it will efface in a few years all the projecting\r\nornaments; and hence the fear of the moon's voracity will lead to the\r\nupsetting of all the views, the studies, and the well-digested plans of\r\nseveral architects. Place a meteorologist on the council, and, despite\r\nthe authority of the nurses, a whole scaffolding of gratuitous\r\nsuppositions will be crumbled to dust by these few categorical and\r\nstrict words of science; the moon does not exert the action that is\r\nattributed to it.\r\n\r\nAt another time, the Eschevin hurls his anathema at the system of\r\nwarming by steam. According to him, this diabolical invention is an\r\nincessant cause of damp to the wood-work, the furniture, the papers, and\r\nthe books. The Eschevin fancies, in short, that in this way of warming,\r\ntorrents of watery vapour enter into the atmosphere of the apartments.\r\nCan he love a colleague, I ask, who after having had the cunning\r\npatience to let him come to the conclusion of his discourse, informs him\r\nthat, although vapour, the vehicle of an enormous quantity of latent\r\nheat, rapidly conveys this caloric to every floor of the largest\r\nedifice, it has never occasion therefore to escape from those\r\nimpermeable tubes through which the circulation is effected!\r\n\r\nAmidst the various labours that are required by every large town, the\r\nEschevin thinks, some one day, that he has discovered an infallible way\r\nof revenging himself of specialties. Guided by the light of modern\r\ngeology, it has been proposed to go with an immense sounding line in\r\nhand, to seek in the bowels of the earth the incalculable quantities of\r\nwater, that from all eternity circulate there without benefiting human\r\nnature, to make them spout up to the surface, to distribute them in\r\nvarious directions, in large cities, until then parched, to take\r\nadvantage of their high temperature, to warm economically the\r\nmagnificent conservatories of the public gardens, the halls of refuge,\r\nthe wards of the sick in hospitals, the cells of madmen. But according\r\nto the old geology of the Eschevin, promulgated perhaps by his nurse,\r\nthere is no circulation in subterranean water; at all events,\r\nsubterranean water cannot be submitted to an ascending force and rise to\r\nthe surface; its temperature would not differ from that of common\r\nwell-water. The Eschevin, however, agrees to the expensive works\r\nproposed. Those works, he says, will afford no material result; but once\r\nfor all, such fantastic projects will receive a solemn and rough\r\ncontradiction, and we shall then be liberated for ever from the odious\r\nyoke under which science wants to enslave us.\r\n\r\nHowever, the subterranean water appears. It is true that a clever\r\nengineer had to bore down 548 mètres (or 600 yards) to find it; but\r\nthence it comes transparent as crystal, pure as if the product of\r\ndistillation, warmed as physical laws had shown that it would be, more\r\nabundant indeed than they had dared to foresee, it shot up thirty-three\r\nmètres above the ground.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose, Gentlemen, that putting aside wretched views of\r\nself-love, the Eschevin would applaud such a result. He shows himself,\r\non the contrary, deeply humiliated. And he will not fail in future to\r\noppose every undertaking that might turn out to the honour of science.\r\nCrowds of such incidents occur to the mind. Are we to infer thence, that\r\nwe ought to be afraid of seeing the administration of a town given up to\r\nthe stationary, and exclusive spirit of the old Eschevinage--to people\r\nwho have learnt nothing and studied nothing? Such is not the result of\r\nthese long reflections. I wished to enable people to foresee the\r\nstruggle, not the defeat. I even hasten to add, that by the side of the\r\nsurly, harsh, rude, positive Eschevin, the type of whom, to say the\r\ntruth, is fortunately becoming rare, an honourable class of citizens\r\nexists, who, content with a moderate fortune laboriously acquired, live\r\nretired, charm their leisure with study, and magnanimously place\r\nthemselves, without any interested views, at the service of the\r\ncommunity. Everywhere similar auxiliaries fight courageously for truth\r\nas soon as they perceive it. Bailly constantly obtained their\r\nconcurrence; as is proved by some touching testimonies of gratitude and\r\nsympathy. As to the counsellors who so often occasioned trouble,\r\nconfusion, and anarchy in the Hôtel de Ville in the years '89 and '90, I\r\nam inclined to blame the virtuous magistrate for having so patiently, so\r\ndiffidently endured their ridiculous pretensions, their unbearable\r\nassumption of power.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest steps in the important study of nature, it becomes\r\nevident that facts unveiled to us in the lapse of centuries, are but a\r\nvery small fraction, if we compare them with those that still remain to\r\nbe discovered. Placing ourselves in that point of view, deficiency in\r\ndiffidence would just be the same as deficiency in judgment. But, by the\r\nside of positive diffidence, if I may be allowed the expression,\r\nrelative diffidence comes in. This is often a delusion; it deceives no\r\none, yet occasions a thousand difficulties. Bailly often confounded\r\nthem. We may regret, I think, that in many instances, the learned\r\nacademician disdained to throw in the face of his vain fellow-labourers\r\nthese words of an ancient philosopher: \"When I examine myself, I find I\r\nam but a pigmy; when I compare myself, I think I am a giant.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were to cover with a veil that which appeared to me susceptible of\r\ncriticism in the character of Bailly, I should voluntarily weaken the\r\npraises that I have bestowed on several acts of his administration. I\r\nwill not commit this fault, no more than I have done already in alluding\r\nto the communications of the mayor with the presuming Eschevins.\r\n\r\nI will therefore acknowledge that on several occasions, Bailly, in my\r\nopinion, showed himself influenced by a petty susceptibility, if not\r\nabout his personal prerogatives, yet about those of his station.\r\n\r\nI think also that Bailly might be accused of an occasional want of\r\nforesight.\r\n\r\nImaginative and sensitive, the philosopher allowed his thoughts to\r\ncentre too exclusively on the difficulties of the moment. He persuaded\r\nhimself, from an excess of good-will, that no new storm would follow the\r\none that he had just overcome. After every success, whether great or\r\nsmall, against the intrigues of the court, or prejudices, or anarchy,\r\nwhether President of the National Assembly or Mayor of Paris, our\r\ncolleague thought the country saved. Then his joy overflowed; he would\r\nhave wished to spread it over all the world. It was thus that on the day\r\nof the definite reunion of the nobility with the other two orders, the\r\n27th of June, 1789, Bailly going from Versailles to Chaillot, after the\r\nclose of the session, leaned half his body out of his carriage door, and\r\nannounced the happy tidings with loud exclamations to all whom he met on\r\nthe road. At Sèvres, it is from himself that I borrow the anecdote, he\r\ndid not see without painful surprise that his communication was received\r\nwith the most complete indifference by a group of soldiers assembled\r\nbefore the barrack door; Bailly laughed much on afterwards learning that\r\nthis was a party of Swiss soldiers, who did not understand a word he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHappy the actors in a great revolution, in whose conduct we find nothing\r\nto reprehend until after having entered into so minute an analysis of\r\ntheir public and private conduct.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[14] _Eschevin_ was a sort of town-councilman, peculiar to\r\nParis and to Rotterdam, acting under a mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY'S JOURNEY FROM PARIS TO NANTES, AND THEN FROM NANTES TO\r\nMÉLUN.--HIS ARREST IN THE LAST TOWN.--HE IS TRANSFERRED TO PARIS.\r\n\r\nAfter having quitted the Mayorality of Paris, Bailly retired to\r\nChaillot, where he hoped again to find happiness in study; but upwards\r\nof two years passed amidst the storms of public life had deeply injured\r\nhis health; it was therefore requisite to obey the advice of physicians,\r\nand undertake a journey. About the middle of June, 1792, Bailly quitted\r\nthe capital, made some excursions in the neighbouring departments, went\r\nto Niort to visit his old colleague and friend, M. de Lapparent, and\r\nsoon after went on far as Nantes, where the due influence of another\r\nfriend, M. Gelée de Prémion, seemed to promise him protection and\r\ntranquillity. Determined to establish himself in this last town, Bailly\r\nand his wife took a small lodging in the house of some distinguished\r\npeople, who could understand and appreciate them. They hoped to live\r\nthere in peace; but news from Paris soon dissipated this illusion. The\r\nCouncil of the Commune decreed, that the house previously occupied, in\r\nconsequence of a formal decision, by the Mayor of Paris, and by the\r\npublic offices of the town, ought to have paid a tax of 6,000 livres,\r\nand strange enough, that Bailly was responsible for it. The pretended\r\ndebt was claimed with harshness. They demanded the payment of it without\r\ndelay. To free himself Bailly was obliged to sell his library, to\r\nabandon to the chances of an auction that multitude of valuable books,\r\nfrom which he had sought out, in the silence of his study, and with such\r\nremarkable perseverance, the most recondite secrets of the firmament.\r\n\r\nThis painful separation was followed by two acts that did not afflict\r\nhim less.\r\n\r\nThe central government (then directed, it must be allowed, by the\r\nGironde party) placed Bailly under surveillance. Every eight days the\r\nvenerable academician was obliged to present himself at the house of the\r\nSyndic Procurator of the Departmental Administration of the Lower-Loire,\r\nlike a vile malefactor, whose every footstep it would be to the interest\r\nof society to watch. What was the true motive for such a strange\r\nmeasure? This secret has been buried in a tomb where I shall not allow\r\nmyself to dig for it.\r\n\r\nThough painful to me to say so, the odious assimilation of Bailly to a\r\ndangerous criminal had not exhausted the rancour of his enemies. A\r\nletter from Roland, the Minister of the Interior, announced very dryly\r\nto the unfortunate proscribed man, that the apartments in the Louvre,\r\nwhich his family had occupied for upwards of half a century, had been\r\nwithdrawn from him. They had even proceeded so far as to furnish a\r\ntipstaff with the order to clear the rooms.\r\n\r\nA short time before this epoch, Bailly had found himself obliged to sell\r\nhis house at Chaillot. The old Mayor of Paris then had no longer a\r\nhearth or a home in the great city which had been the late scene of his\r\ndevotion, his solicitude, and his sacrifices. When this reflection\r\noccurred to his mind, his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nBut the grief that Bailly experienced on seeing himself the daily object\r\nof odious persecutions, left his patriotic convictions intact. Vainly\r\ndid they endeavour several times to transform a legitimate hatred\r\ntowards individuals into an antipathy towards principles. They still\r\nremember in Brittany the debate raised, by one of these attempts,\r\nbetween our colleague and a Vendéan physician, Dr. Blin. Never, in the\r\nseason of his greatest popularity, did the president of the National\r\nAssembly express himself with more vivacity; never had he defended our\r\nfirst revolution with more eloquence. Not long since, in the same place,\r\nI pointed out to public attention another of our colleagues (Condorcet),\r\nwho already under the blow of a capital condemnation, devoted his last\r\nmoments to restore to the light of day the principles of eternal\r\njustice, which the fashions and the follies of men had but too much\r\nobscured. At a time of weak or interested convictions, and disgraceful\r\ncapitulations of conscience, those two examples of unchangeable\r\nconvictions deserved to be remarked. I am happy in having found them in\r\nthe bosom of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nTranquillity of mind is not less requisite than vigour of intellect, to\r\nthose who undertake great works. Thus during his residence at Nantes,\r\nBailly did not even try to add to his numerous scientific or literary\r\nproductions. This celebrated astronomer passed his time in reading\r\nnovels. He sometimes said with a bitter smile: \"My day has been well\r\noccupied; since I got up, I have put myself in a position to give an\r\nanalysis of the two, or of the three first volumes of the new novel that\r\nthe reading-room has just received.\" From time to time these\r\nabstractions were of a more elevated tone; he owed them to two young\r\npersons, who having reached an advanced age may now be listening to my\r\nwords. Bailly discoursed with them of Homer, of Plato, of Aristotle, of\r\nthe principal works in our literature, of the rapid progress of the\r\nsciences, and chiefly of those of astronomy. What our colleague chiefly\r\nappreciated in these two young friends, was a true sensibility, and\r\ngreat warmth of feeling. I know that years have not effaced or weakened\r\nthese rare qualities in the bosoms of those two Brétons. M. Pariset, our\r\ncolleague, and M. Villenave, will therefore think it natural in me to\r\nthank them here, in the name of science and literature, in the name of\r\nhumanity, for the few moments of sweet peace and happiness that they\r\nafforded to our learned colleague, at a time when the inconstancy and\r\ningratitude of men were lacerating his heart.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI. had perished; dark clouds hung over the horizon; some acts of\r\nodious brutality showed our proscribed philosopher how little he must\r\nthenceforward depend on public sympathy; how much times had changed\r\nsince the memorable meeting (of the 7th of October, 1791), at which the\r\nNational Assembly decided that the bust of Bailly should be placed in\r\nthe hall of their meetings! The storm appeared near and very menacing;\r\neven persons usually of little foresight were meditating where to find\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions, Charles Marquis de Casaux, known by various\r\nproductions on literature and on economical politics, went and requested\r\nour colleague, together with his wife, to take a passage on board a ship\r\nthat he had freighted for himself and his family. \"We will first go to\r\nEngland,\" said M. Casaux; \"we will then, if you prefer it, pass our\r\nexile in America. Have no anxiety, I have property; I can, without\r\ninconvenience to myself, undertake all the expenses. Pythagoras said:\r\n'In solitude the wise man worships echo;' but this no longer suffices in\r\nFrance; the wise man must fly from a land that threatens to devour its\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nThese warm solicitations, and the prayers of his weeping companion,\r\ncould not shake the firm resolution of Bailly. \"From the day that I\r\nbecame a public character,\" he said, \"my fate has become irrevocably\r\nunited with that of France; never will I quit my post in the moment of\r\ndanger. Under any circumstances my country may depend on my devotion.\r\nWhatever may happen, I shall remain.\"\r\n\r\nBy regulating his conduct on such fine generous maxims, a citizen does\r\nhimself honour, but he exposes himself to fall under the blows of\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nBailly was still at Nantes on the 30th of June, 1793, when eighty\r\nthousand Vendéans, commanded by Cathelineau and Charette, went to\r\nbesiege that city.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine to ourselves the position of the President of the sitting\r\nof the \"Jeu de Paume,\" of the first Mayor of Paris, in a city besieged\r\nby the Vendéans! We cannot presume that the unfavourable opinion of the\r\nConvention under which he was labouring, and the rigorous surveillance\r\nto which he was subjected, would have saved him from harsh treatment if\r\nthe town had been taken. No one can therefore be surprised that after\r\nthe victory of Nanteans, our colleague hastened to follow out his\r\nproject, formed a short time before, of withdrawing from the insurgent\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of July 1793, Mélun had enjoyed perfect\r\ntranquillity. Bailly knew it through M. de Laplace, who, living retired\r\nin that chief town of the department, was there composing the immortal\r\nwork in which the wonders of the heavens are studied with so much depth\r\nand genius. He also knew that the great geometer, hoping to be still\r\nmore retired in a cottage on the banks of the Seine, and out of the\r\ntown, was going to dispose of his house in Mélun. It is easy to guess\r\nthat Bailly would be charmed with the prospect of residing far away from\r\npolitical agitation, and near to his illustrious friend!\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were promptly made, and on the 6th of July, M. and\r\nMadame Bailly quitted Nantes in company with M. and Madame Villenave,\r\nwho were going to Rennes.\r\n\r\nAt this same time, a division of the revolutionary army was marching to\r\nMélun. As soon as the terrible news was known, Madame Laplace wrote to\r\nBailly, persuading him, under covert expressions, to give up the\r\nintended project. The house, she said, is at the water's edge: there is\r\nextreme dampness in the rooms: Madame Bailly would die there. A letter\r\nso different from those that had preceded it, could not fail of its\r\neffect; such at least was the hope with which M. and Madame Laplace\r\nflattered themselves, when about the end of July they perceived, with\r\ninexpressible alarm, Bailly crossing the garden path. \"Great God, you\r\ndid not then understand our last letter!\" exclaimed at the same instant\r\nour colleague's two friends. \"I understood perfectly,\" Bailly replied\r\nwith the greatest calm; \"but on the one hand, the two servants who\r\nfollowed me to Nantes, having heard that I was going to be imprisoned,\r\nquitted me; on the other hand, if I am to be arrested, I wish it to be\r\nin a house that I have occupied some time. I will not be described in\r\nany act as an individual without a domicile!\" Can it be said, after\r\nthis, that great men are not subject to strange weaknesses?\r\n\r\nThese minute details will be my only answer to some culpable expressions\r\nthat I have met with in a work very widely spread: \"M. Laplace,\" says\r\nthe anonymous writer \"knew all the secrets of geometry; but he had not\r\nthe least notion of the state France was in, he therefore imprudently\r\nadvised Bailly to go and join him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is to be here deplored as regards imprudence, is, that a writer,\r\nwithout exactly knowing the facts, should authoritatively pronounce such\r\nsevere sentences against one of the most illustrious ornaments of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBailly did not even enjoy the puerile satisfaction of taking rank among\r\nthe domiciled citizens of Mélun. For two days after his arrival in that\r\ntown, a soldier of the revolutionary army having recognized him,\r\nbrutally ordered him to accompany him to the municipality: \"I am going\r\nthere,\" coolly replied Bailly; \"you may follow me there.\"\r\n\r\nThe municipal body of Mélun had at that time an honest and very\r\ncourageous man at its head, M. Tarbé des Sablons. This virtuous\r\nmagistrate endeavoured to prove to the multitude, (with which the Hôtel\r\nde Ville was immediately filled by the news, rapidly propagated, of the\r\narrest of the old Mayor of Paris,) that the passports granted at Nantes,\r\ncountersigned at Rennes, showed nothing irregular; that according to the\r\nterms of the law, he could not but set Bailly at liberty, under pain of\r\nforfeiture. Vain efforts! To avoid a bloody catastrophe, it was\r\nnecessary to promise that reference would be made to Paris, and that in\r\nthe mean time he should be guarded--_à vue_--in his own house.\r\n\r\nThe surveillance, perhaps purposely, was not at all strict; to escape\r\nwould have been very easy. Bailly utterly discarded the notion. He would\r\nnot at any price have compromised M. Tarbé, nor even his guard.\r\n\r\nAn order from the Committee of Public Safety enjoined the authorities of\r\nMélun to transfer Bailly to one of the prisons of the capital. On the\r\nday of departure, Madame Laplace paid a visit to our unfortunate\r\ncolleague. She represented to him again the possibility of escape. The\r\nfirst scruples no longer existed; the escort was already waiting in the\r\nstreet. But Bailly was inflexible. He felt perfectly safe. Madame\r\nLaplace held her son in her arms; Bailly took the opportunity of turning\r\nthe conversation to the education of children. He treated the subject,\r\nto which he might well have been thought a stranger, with a remarkable\r\nsuperiority, and ended even with several amusing anecdotes that would\r\ndeserve a place in the witty and comic gallery of \"les Enfants\r\nterribles.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Paris, Bailly was imprisoned at the Madelonnettes, and\r\nsome days after at La Force. They there granted him a room, where his\r\nwife and his nephews were permitted to visit him.\r\n\r\nBailly had undergone only one examination of little importance, when he\r\nwas summoned as a witness in the trial of the queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY IS CALLED AS A WITNESS IN THE TRIAL OF THE QUEEN.--HIS OWN TRIAL\r\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL.--HIS CONDEMNATION TO DEATH.--HIS\r\nEXECUTION.--IMAGINARY DETAILS ADDED BY ILL-INFORMED HISTORIANS TO WHAT\r\nTHAT ODIOUS AND FRIGHTFUL EVENT ALREADY PRESENTED.\r\n\r\nBailly, under the weight of a capital accusation, and precisely on\r\naccount of a portion of the acts imputed to Marie Antoinette, was heard\r\nas a witness in the trial of that princess. The annals of tribunals,\r\neither ancient or modern, never offered any thing like this. What did\r\nthey hope for? To lead our colleague to make inexact declarations, or to\r\nconcealments from a feeling of imminent personal danger? To suggest the\r\nthought to him to save his own head at the expense of that of an unhappy\r\nwoman? To make virtue finally stagger? At all events, this infernal\r\ncombination failed; with a man like Bailly it could not succeed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the accused?\" said the President to Bailly. \"Oh! yes, I do\r\nknow her!\" answered the witness, in a tone of emotion, and bowing\r\nrespectfully to Marie Antoinette. Bailly then protested with horror\r\nagainst the odious imputations that the act of accusation had put into\r\nthe mouth of the young dauphin. From that moment Bailly was treated with\r\ngreat harshness. He seemed to have lost in the eyes of the tribunal the\r\ncharacter of a witness, and to have become the accused. The turn that\r\nthe debates took would really authorize us to call the sitting in which\r\nthe queen was condemned, (in which she figured ostensibly as the only\r\none accused,) the trial of Marie Antoinette and of Bailly. What\r\nsignified, after all, this or that qualification of this monstrous\r\ntrial? in the judgment of any man of feeling, never did Bailly prove\r\nhimself more noble, more courageous, more worthy, than in this difficult\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nBailly appeared again before the Revolutionary Tribunal, and this time\r\nas the accused, the 10th of November 1793. The accusation bore chiefly\r\non the pretended participation of the Mayor of Paris in the escape of\r\nLouis XVI. and his family, and in the catastrophe that occurred in the\r\nChamp de Mars.\r\n\r\nIf any thing in the world appeared evident, even in 1793, even before\r\nthe detailed revelations of the persons who took a more or less direct\r\npart in the event, it is, that Bailly did not facilitate the departure\r\nof the royal family; it is that, in proportion to the suspicions that\r\nreached him, he did all that was in his power to prevent their\r\ndeparture; it is, that the President of the sitting of the Jeu de Paume\r\nhad not, and could never have had in any case, an intention of going to\r\njoin the fugitive family in a strange country; it is that, finally, any\r\nact emanating from a public authority in which such expressions as the\r\nfollowing could be found: \"The deep wickedness of Bailly.... Bailly\r\nthirsted for the people's blood!\" must have excited the disgust and\r\nindignation of good men, whatever might be their political opinions.\r\n\r\nThe accusation, as far as it regarded the murderous fusillade on the\r\nChamp de Mars, had more weight; this event had as counterpoises, the\r\n10th of August and the 31st of May; La Fayette says in his memoirs, that\r\nthose two days were a retaliation. It is at least certain that the\r\nterrible scenes of the 17th of July cost Bailly his life; they left deep\r\nimpressions in people's minds, which were still perceptible after the\r\nrevolution of 1830, and which, on more than one occasion, rendered the\r\nposition of La Fayette one of great delicacy. I have therefore studied\r\nthem most attentively, with a very sincere and lively desire to\r\ndissipate, once for all, the clouds that seemed to have obscured this\r\npoint, this sole point, in the life of Bailly. I have succeeded,\r\nGentlemen, without ever having had a wish or occasion to veil the truth.\r\nI do no Frenchman the injustice to suppose that I need define to him an\r\nevent of the national history that has been so influential on the\r\nprogress of our revolution, but perhaps, there may be some foreigners\r\npresent at this sitting. It will be therefore for them only that I shall\r\nhere relate some details. We must bring to mind some deplorable\r\ncircumstances of the evening of the 17th July, when the multitude had\r\nassembled on the Champ de Mars or Champ de la Fédération, around the\r\naltar of their country, the remains of the wooden edifice that had been\r\nraised to celebrate the anniversary of the 14th of July. Part of this\r\ncrowd signed a petition tending to ask the forfeiture of the throne by\r\nLouis XVI., then lately reconducted from Varennes, and on whose fate the\r\nConstituent Assembly had been enacting regulations. On that occasion\r\nmartial law was proclaimed. The National Guard, with Bailly and La\r\nFayette at their head, went to the Champ de Mars; they were assailed by\r\nclamours, by stones, and by the firing of a pistol; the Guard fired;\r\nmany victims fell, without its being possible to say exactly how many,\r\nfor the estimates, according to the effect that the reporters wished to\r\nproduce, varied from eighty to two thousand!\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal heard several witnesses relative to the\r\nevents on the Champ de Mars: amongst them I find Chaumette, Procurator\r\nof the Commune of Paris; Lullier, the Syndic Procurator General of the\r\nDepartment; Coffinhal, Judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal; Dufourny,\r\nmanufacturer of gunpowder; Momoro, a printer.\r\n\r\nAll these witnesses strongly blamed the old Mayor of Paris; but who is\r\nthere that does not know how much arbitrariness and cruelty these\r\nindividuals, whom I have mentioned above, showed during our misfortunes?\r\nTheir declarations, therefore, must be received with great suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe sincere admirers of Bailly would be relieved of a great weight, if\r\nthe event of the Champ de la Fédération had been darkened only by the\r\ntestimonies of Chaumettes and Coffinhals. Unfortunately, the public\r\naccuser produced some very grave documents during the debates, which the\r\nimpartial historian cannot overlook. Let us say, however, just to\r\ncorrect one error out of a thousand, that on the day of Bailly's trial,\r\nthe public accuser was Naulin, and not Fouquier Tinville,\r\nnotwithstanding all that has been written on this subject by persons\r\ncalling themselves well-informed, and even some of the accused's\r\nintimate friends.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe of the Champ de Mars, when impartially examined in its\r\nessential phases, presents some very simple problems:\r\n\r\nWas a petition to the Constituent Assembly illegal that was got up on\r\nthe 17th of July, 1791, against a decree issued on the 15th?\r\n\r\nHad the petitioners, by assembling on the Champ de Mars, violated any\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\nCould the two murders committed in the morning be imputed to these men?\r\n\r\nHad projects of disorder and rebellion been manifested with sufficient\r\nevidence to justify the proclamation of martial law, and especially the\r\nputting it into practice?\r\n\r\nI say it, Gentlemen, with deep grief, these problems will be answered in\r\nthe negative by whoever takes the trouble to analyze without passion,\r\nand without preconceived opinions, some authentic documents, which\r\npeople in general seem to have made it a point to leave in oblivion. But\r\nI hasten to add, that considering the question as to intention, Bailly\r\nwill continue to appear, after this examination, quite as humane, quite\r\nas honourable, quite as pure as we have found him to be in the other\r\nphases of a public and private life, which might serve as a model.\r\n\r\nIn the best epochs of the National Assembly, no one who belonged to it\r\nwould have dared to maintain, that to draw up and sign a petition,\r\nwhatever might be the object of it, were rebellious acts. Never, at that\r\ntime, would the President of that great Assembly have called down hate,\r\npublic vengeance, or a sanguinary repression upon those who attempted,\r\nsaid Charles Lameth, in the sitting of the 16th of July, \"to oppose\r\ntheir individual will to the law, which is an expression of the national\r\nwill.\" The right of petition seemed as if it ought to be absolute, even\r\nif contrary to sanctioned and promulgated laws in full action, and even\r\nmore so against legislative arrangements still under discussion, or\r\nscarcely voted.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners of the Champ de Mars asked the Constituent Assembly to\r\nrevise a decree that they had issued two days before. We have no\r\noccasion to examine whether the act was reasonable, opportune, dictated\r\nby an enlightened view of the public good. The question is simple; in\r\nsoliciting the Assembly to revise a decree, they violated no law.\r\nPerhaps it will be thought that the petitioners at least committed an\r\nunusual act, contrary to all custom. Even this would be unfounded. In\r\nten various instances, the National Assembly modified or annulled its\r\nown decrees; in twenty others, it had been entreated to revise them,\r\nwithout any cry of anarchy being raised.\r\n\r\nIt is well ascertained, that the crowd on the Champ de Mars availed\r\nitself of a right that the constitution recognized, that of getting up\r\nand signing a petition against a decree which, right or wrong, it\r\nthought was opposed to the true interests of the country. Still, the\r\nexercise of the right of petitioning was always wisely subjected to\r\ncertain forms. Had these forms been violated? Was the meeting illegal?\r\n\r\nIn 1791, according to the decrees, every meeting that wished to exercise\r\nthe right of petition must consist of unarmed citizens, and be announced\r\nto the competent authorities twenty-four hours beforehand.\r\n\r\nWell, on the 16th of July, twelve persons had gone as a deputation to\r\nthe municipality, in order to declare, according to law, that the next\r\nday, the 17th, numerous citizens would meet, without arms, on the Champ\r\nde Mars, where they wished to sign a petition. The deputation obtained\r\nan acknowledgment of its declaration from the hand of the syndic\r\nprocurator Desmousseaux, who addressed them besides with these solemn\r\nwords: \"The law shields you with its inviolability.\"\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment was presented to Bailly on the day of his\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nHad they committed some assassinations? Yes, undoubtedly; they had\r\ncommitted two; but in the morning, very early; but at the Gros Caillou,\r\nand not on the Champ de Mars. Those horrid murders could not\r\nlegitimately be imputed to the petitioners who, eight or ten hours\r\nafter, surrounded the altar of their country; to the crowd who fell by\r\nthe fusillade of the National Guard. By changing the date of these\r\ncrimes, and displacing also the localities where these crimes were\r\ncommitted, some historians of our revolution, and amongst others the\r\nbest known of all, have given, without intending it, to the meeting in\r\nthe afternoon, a character that cannot be honestly concurred in.\r\n\r\nIt is requisite we should know at what hour, in what place, and how,\r\nthese misfortunes happened, before we hazard an opinion on the\r\nsanguinary acts of that day, the 17th of July.\r\n\r\nA young man had gone that day very early to the altar of his country.\r\nThis young man wished to copy several inscriptions. All at once he heard\r\na singular noise, and very soon after the worm of a wimble shot up from\r\nthe planked floor on which he was standing. The youth went and sought\r\nthe guard, who raised the plank, and found beneath the altar two\r\nill-looking individuals, lying down, and furnished with provisions. One\r\nof these men was an invalid with a wooden leg. The guard seized them,\r\nand took them to the Gros Caillou, to the section, to the Commissary of\r\nPolice. On the way, the barrel of water with which these unfortunate men\r\nhad provided themselves under the altar of their country, was\r\ntransformed, according to the ordinary course of things, into a barrel\r\nof gunpowder. The inhabitants of that quarter of the town collected\r\ntogether; it was on a Sunday. The women especially showed themselves\r\nvery much irritated when the purpose of the auger-holes was told them,\r\nas declared by the invalid. When the two prisoners came out of the hall\r\nto be conducted to the Hôtel de Ville, the crowd tore them from the\r\nguard, massacred them, and paraded their heads on pikes!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too often repeated, that these hideous assassinations,\r\nthis execution of two old vagabonds by the barbarous and blinded\r\npopulation of the Gros Caillou, evidently had no relation to, no\r\nconnection with, the events which, in the evening, carried mourning into\r\nthe Champ de la Fédération.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 17th of July, from five to seven o'clock, had the\r\ncrowd which was collected around the altar of their country an aspect of\r\nturbulence, giving reason to fear a riot, sedition, violence, or any\r\nanarchical enterprise?\r\n\r\nRelative to this point, we have the written declaration of three\r\ncouncillors, whom the municipality had sent in the morning to the Gros\r\nCaillou, on the first intimation of the two assassinations of which I\r\nhave just spoken. This declaration was presented to Bailly on the day of\r\nhis condemnation. We read therein, \"that the assembled citizens on the\r\nChamp de Mars had in no way acted contrary to law; that they only asked\r\nfor time to sign their petition before they retired; that the crowd had\r\nshown all possible respect to the commissaries, and given proofs of\r\nsubmission to the law and its agents.\" The Municipal Councillors, on\r\ntheir return to the Hôtel de Ville, accompanied by a deputation of\r\ntwelve of the petitioners, protested strongly against the proclamation\r\nof martial law; they declared that if the red flag was unfurled, they\r\nwould be regarded, and with some appearance of reason, as traitors and\r\nfaithless men.\r\n\r\nVain efforts; the anger of the councillors, confined since the morning\r\nat the Hôtel de Ville, carried the day over the enlightened opinion of\r\nthose who had been sent scrupulously to study the state of affairs, who\r\nhad mixed in the crowd, who returned after having reassured it by\r\npromises.\r\n\r\nI might invoke the testimony of one of my honourable colleagues. Led by\r\nthe fine weather, and somewhat also by curiosity, towards the Champ de\r\nMars, he was enabled to observe all; and he has assured me that there\r\nnever was a meeting which showed less turbulence or seditious spirit;\r\nthat especially the women and children were very numerous. Is it not,\r\nbesides, perfectly proved now, that on the morning of the 17th July, the\r\nJacobin club, by means of printed placards, disavowed any intention of\r\npetitioning; and that the influential men of the Jacobins and of the\r\nCordeliers,--those men whose presence might have given to this concourse\r\nthe dangerous character of a riot,--not only did not appear there, but\r\nhad started in the night for the country?\r\n\r\nBy thus connecting together all the circumstances whence it is proved\r\nthat martial law was proclaimed and put in practice on the 17th of July\r\nwithout legitimate motives, a most terrible responsibility seems at\r\nfirst sight to be cast on the memory of Bailly. But reassure yourselves,\r\nGentlemen; the events which are now grouped together, and are exhibited\r\nto our eyes with complete evidence, were not known on that inauspicious\r\nday at the Hôtel de Ville, until they had been distorted by the spirit\r\nof party.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1791, after the king had returned from Varennes,\r\nthe monarchy and the republic began for the first time to be dangerously\r\nopposed to each other; in an instant passion took the place of cool\r\nreason in the minds of the respective partisans of the two different\r\nforms of government. The terrible formula: _We must make an end of it!_\r\nwas in everybody's mouth.\r\n\r\nBailly was surrounded by those passionate politicians who, without the\r\nleast scruple as to the honesty or legality of the means, are\r\ndetermined to make an end of the adversaries who annoy them, as soon as\r\ncircumstances seem to promise them victory.\r\n\r\nBailly had still near him some Eschevins long accustomed to regard him\r\nas a magistrate for show.\r\n\r\nThe former gave the Mayor false, or highly coloured intelligence. The\r\nothers, by long habit, did not conceive themselves obliged to\r\ncommunicate any thing to him.\r\n\r\nOn the bloody day of July, 1791, of all the inhabitants of Paris,\r\nperhaps Bailly was the man who knew with least detail or correctness the\r\nevents of the morning and of the evening.\r\n\r\nBailly, with his deep horror for falsehood, would have thought that he\r\nwas most cruelly insulting the magistrates, if he had not attributed to\r\nthem similar sentiments to his own. His uprightness prevented his being\r\nsufficiently on the watch against the machinations of parties. It was\r\nevidently by false reports that he was induced to unfurl the red flag on\r\nthe 17th of July: \"It was from the reports that followed each other,\" he\r\nsaid to the Revolutionary Tribunal, on being questioned by the\r\nPresident, \"and became more and more alarming every hour, that the\r\ncouncil adopted the measure of marching with the armed force to the\r\nChamp de Mars.\"\r\n\r\nIn all his answers Bailly insisted on the repeated orders he had\r\nreceived from the President of the National Assembly; on the reproaches\r\naddressed to him for not sufficiently watching the agents of foreign\r\npowers; it was against these pretended agents and their creatures, that\r\nthe Mayor of Paris thought he was marching when he put himself at the\r\nhead of a column of National Guards.\r\n\r\nBailly did not even know the cause of the meeting; he had not been\r\ninformed that the crowd wished to sign a petition; and that the\r\nprevious evening, according to the decree of the law, there had been a\r\ndeclaration made to this effect before the competent authority. His\r\nanswers to the Revolutionary Tribunal leave not the least doubt on this\r\npoint!\r\n\r\nOh Eschevins, Eschevins! when your vain pretensions only were treated\r\nof, the public could forgive you; but the 17th of July, you took\r\nadvantage of Bailly's confidence; you induced him to take sanguinary\r\nmeasures of repression, after having fascinated him with false reports;\r\nyou committed a real crime. If it was the duty of the Revolutionary\r\nTribunal, of deplorable memory, to demand in 1793 from any one an\r\nexplanation of the massacres of the Champ de Mars, it was not Bailly\r\nassuredly who ought to have been accused in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe political party whose blood flowed on the 17th of July, pretended to\r\nhave been the victim of a plot concocted by its adversaries. When\r\ninterrogated by the President of the Revolutionary Tribunal, Bailly\r\nanswered: \"I had no knowledge of it, but experience has since given me\r\nreason to think that such a plot did exist at that time.\"\r\n\r\nNothing more serious has ever been written against the promoters of the\r\nsanguinary violences on the 17th of July.\r\n\r\nThe blame that has been thrown on the events of the Champ de Mars has\r\nnot been confined solely to the fact of proclaiming martial law; the\r\nrepressive measures that followed that proclamation have been criticized\r\nwith equal bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe municipal administration was especially reproached for having\r\nhoisted a red flag much too small; a flag that was called in the\r\nTribunal _a pocket flag_; for not having placed this flag at the head\r\nof the column, as the law commands, but in such a position, that the\r\npublic on whom the column was advancing could not see it; for having\r\nmade the armed force enter the Champ de Mars, by all the gates on the\r\nside towards the town, a manoeuvre that seemed rather intended to\r\nsurround the multitude, than to disperse it; for having ordered the\r\nNational Guard to load their arms, even on the Place de Grève; for\r\nhaving made the guard fire before the three required summonses were\r\nmade, and fire upon the people around the altar, whilst the stones and\r\nthe pistol shot, which were assigned as the motive for the sanguinary\r\norder, came from the steps and benches; for allowing some people who\r\nwere endeavouring to escape on the side towards l'Ecole Militaire, and\r\nothers who had actually jumped into the Seine, to be pursued, shot, and\r\nbayonetted.\r\n\r\nIt results clearly from one of Bailly's publications, from his answers\r\nto the questions put to him by the President of the Revolutionary\r\nTribunal, from the writings of the day:\r\n\r\nThat the Mayor of Paris gave no order for the troops to be collected on\r\nthe 17th of July; that he had had no conference on that day with the\r\nmilitary authority; that if any arrangements, culpable and contrary to\r\nlaw were adopted, as to the situation of the cavalry, of the red flag,\r\nand of the Municipal Body, in the column marching on the Champ de Mars,\r\nthey could not without injustice be imputed to him; that Bailly was not\r\naware of the National Guard having loaded their muskets with ball before\r\nquitting the square of the Hôtel de Ville; that he was not aware even of\r\nthe existence of the red flag, with whose small dimensions he had been\r\nso severely reproached; that the National Guard fired without his\r\norder; that he made every effort to stop the firing, to stop the\r\npursuit, and make the soldiers resume their ranks; that he congratulated\r\nthe troops of the line, who under the command of Hulin, entered by the\r\ngate of l'Ecole Militaire, and not only did not fire, but tore many of\r\nthe unfortunate people from the hands of the National Guard, whose\r\nexasperation amounted to delirium. In short, it might he asked, relative\r\nto any want of exactness attributable to Bailly in that unfortunate\r\naffair, whether it was just to impute it to him who, in his letters to\r\nVoltaire on the origin of the sciences, wrote as follows in 1776:\r\n\r\n\"I am unfortunately short-sighted. I am often humiliated in the open\r\ncountry. Whilst I with difficulty can distinguish a house at the\r\ndistance of a hundred paces, my friends relate to me what they see at\r\nthe distance of five or six hundred. I open my eyes, I fatigue myself\r\nwithout seeing any thing, and I am sometimes inclined to think that they\r\namuse themselves at my expense.\"\r\n\r\nYou begin to see, Gentlemen, the advantage that a firm and able lawyer\r\nmight have drawn from the authentic facts that I have just been\r\nrelating. But Bailly knew the pretended jury before whom he had to\r\nappear. This jury was not a collection of drunken cobblers, whatever\r\nsome passionate writers may have asserted; it was worse than that,\r\nGentlemen, notwithstanding the deservedly celebrated names that were\r\noccasionally interspersed among them: it was--let us cut the subject\r\nshort--an odious, commission.\r\n\r\nThe very circumscribed list from which chance in 1793 and 1794 drew the\r\njuries of the Revolutionary Tribunals, did not embrace, as the sacred\r\nword _jury_ seems to imply, all one class of citizens. The authorities\r\nformed it, after a prefatory and very minute inquiry, of their\r\nadherents only. The unfortunate defendants were thus judged not by\r\nimpartial persons free from any preconceived system, but by political\r\nenemies, which is as much as to say, by that which is the most cruel and\r\nremorseless in the world.\r\n\r\nBailly would not be defended. After his appearance as a witness in the\r\ntrial of Marie Antoinette, the ex-Mayor only wrote and had printed for\r\ncirculation, a paper entitled _Bailly to his fellow-citizens_. It closes\r\nwith these affecting words:\r\n\r\n\"I have only gained by the Revolution that which my fellow-citizens have\r\ngained: liberty and equality. I have lost by it some useful situations,\r\nand my fortune is nearly destroyed. I could be happy with what remains\r\nof it to me and a clear conscience; but to be happy in the repose of my\r\nretreat, I require, my dear fellow-citizens, your esteem: I know well\r\nthat, sooner or later, you will do me justice; but I require it while I\r\nlive, and while I am yet amongst you.\"\r\n\r\nOur colleague was unanimously condemned. We should despair of the\r\nfuture, unless such a unanimity struck all friends of justice and\r\nhumanity with stupor, if it did not increase the number of decided\r\nadversaries to all political tribunals.\r\n\r\nWhen the President of the Tribunal interrogated the accused, already\r\ndeclared guilty, as to whether he had any reclamations to make relative\r\nto the execution of the sentence, Bailly answered:\r\n\r\n\"I have always carried out the law; I shall know how to submit myself to\r\nit, since you are its organ.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustrious convict was led back to his cell.\r\n\r\nBailly had said in his éloge on M. de Tressan: \"French gaiety produces\r\nthe same effect as stoicism.\" These words occurred to my memory at the\r\ntime when I was gathering from various sources the proof that on\r\nreëntering the Conciergerie after his condemnation, Bailly showed\r\nhimself at once both gay and stoical.\r\n\r\nHe desired his nephew, M. Batbéda, to play a game at piquet with him as\r\nusual. He thought of all the circumstances connected with the frightful\r\nmorrow with such coolness, that he even said with a smile to M. Batbéda\r\nduring the game: \"Let us rest awhile, my friend, and take a pinch of\r\nsnuff; to-morrow I shall be deprived of this pleasure, for I shall have\r\nmy hands tied behind my back.\"\r\n\r\nI will quote some words which, while testifying to a similar degree\r\nBailly's serenity of mind, are more in harmony with his grave character,\r\nand more worthy of being preserved in history.\r\n\r\nOne of the companions of the illustrious academician's captivity, on the\r\nevening of the 11th of November, with tears in his eyes and moved by a\r\ntender veneration, exclaimed: \"Why did you let us fancy there was a\r\npossibility of acquittal? You deceived us then?\"--Bailly answered: \"No,\r\nI was teaching you never to despair of the laws of your country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the paroxysms of wild despair, some of the prisoners reviewing the\r\npast, went so far as to regret that they had never infringed the laws of\r\nthe strictest honesty.\r\n\r\nBailly brought back these minds, erring for the moment from the path of\r\nduty, by repeating to them maxims which both in form and substance would\r\nnot disparage the collections of the most celebrated moralists:\r\n\r\n\"It is false, very false, that a crime can ever be useful. The trade of\r\nan honest man is the safest, even in times of revolution. Enlightened\r\negotism suffices to put any intelligent individual into the path of\r\njustice and truth. Whenever innocence can be sacrificed with impunity,\r\ncrime is not sure of succeeding. There is so great a difference between\r\nthe death of a good man and that of a wicked man, that the multitude is\r\nincapable of estimating it.\"\r\n\r\nCannibals devouring their vanquished enemies seem to me less hideous,\r\nless contrary to nature, than those wretches, the refuse of the\r\npopulation of large towns, who, too often alas! have carried their\r\nferocity so far, as to disturb by their clamorous and infamous raillery\r\nthe last moments of the unhappy victims about to be struck by the sword\r\nof the law. The more humiliating this picture of the degradation of the\r\nhuman species may be, the more we should beware of overcharging the\r\ncolouring. With few exceptions, the historians of Bailly's last agony\r\nappear to me to have forgotten this duty. Was the truth, the strict\r\ntruth, not sufficiently distressing? Was it requisite, without any sort\r\nof proof, to impute to the mass of the people the infernal cynicism of\r\ncannibals? Should they lightly make just sentiments of disgust and\r\nindignation rest upon an immense class of citizens? I think not,\r\nGentlemen, and I will therefore avoid the cruelty and poignancy of\r\nchaining the thoughts for a long time on such scenes; I will prove that\r\nby rendering the drama a little less atrocious, I have only sacrificed\r\nimaginary details, which are the envenomed fruits of the spirit of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI will not shut my ears to the questions that already hum around me.\r\nPeople will say to me, What are your claims for daring to modify a page\r\nof our revolutionary history, on which every one seemed agreed? What\r\nright have you to weaken contemporary testimonies, you, who at the time\r\nof Bailly's death, were scarcely born; you, who lived in an obscure\r\nvalley of the Pyrenees, two hundred and twenty leagues from the capital?\r\n\r\nThese questions do not embarrass me at all. In short, I do not ask that\r\nthe relation of what seems to me to be the expression of the truth,\r\nshould be adopted upon my word. I enumerate my proofs, I express my\r\ndoubts. Within these limits there is no one but has claims to bring\r\nforward; the discussion is open to all the world, the public will\r\npronounce its definitive judgment.\r\n\r\nAs a general thesis, I will add that by concentrating our researches on\r\none circumscribed and special object, we have a better chance of seeing\r\nit correctly and knowing it well, all other things being equal, than by\r\nscattering our attention in all directions.\r\n\r\nAs to the merit of contemporaneous narratives, it seems to me very\r\ndubious. Political passions do not allow us to see objects in their real\r\ndimensions, nor in their true forms, nor in their natural colours.\r\nMoreover, have not unpublished and very valuable documents come to shed\r\nbright colours, just where the spirit of party had spread a thick veil?\r\n\r\nThe account that Riouffe gave of the death of Bailly has almost blindly\r\nled all the historians of our revolution. What does it consist of \"at\r\nbottom.\" The prisoner of la Conciergerie said it himself; of tales\r\nrelated by executioners' valets, repeated by turnkeys.\r\n\r\nI would willingly allow this account to be set against me,\r\nnotwithstanding the horrid sewer from which Riouffe had been obliged to\r\ndraw, if it were not evident that this clever writer saw all the\r\nrevolutionary events through the just anger that an ardent and active\r\nyoung man must feel after an iniquitous imprisonment; if this current of\r\nsentiments and ideas had not led him into some manifest errors.\r\n\r\nWho has not, for example, read with tears in their eyes, in the\r\n_Mémoires sur les Prisons_, what the author relates of the fourteen\r\ngirls of Verdun? \"Of those girls,\" he said, \"of unparalleled fairness,\r\nand who appeared like young virgins dressed for a public fête. They\r\ndisappeared,\" added Riouffe, \"all at once, and were mowed down in the\r\nspring of life. The court occupied by the women the day after their\r\ndeath, had the appearance of a garden that had been despoiled of its\r\nflowers by a storm. I have never seen amongst us a despair equal to that\r\nexcited by this barbarity.\"\r\n\r\nFar be from me the intention to weaken the painful feelings which the\r\ncatastrophe related by Riouffe must naturally inspire; but every one has\r\nremarked that the report of this writer is very circumstantial; the\r\nauthor appears to have seen all with his own eyes. Yet he has been\r\nguilty of the gravest inaccuracy.\r\n\r\nOut of the fourteen unfortunate women who were sentenced after Verdun\r\nwas retaken from the Prussians, two girls of seventeen years of age were\r\nnot condemned to death on account of their youth.\r\n\r\nThis first circumstance was well worth recording. Let us go farther. A\r\nhistorian having lately consulted the official journals of that epoch,\r\nand the bulletin of the Revolutionary Tribunal, discovered with some\r\nsurprise that among the twelve _young girls_ who were condemned, there\r\nwere seven either married or widows, whose ages varied from forty-one to\r\nsixty-nine!\r\n\r\nContemporary accounts then, even those of Riouffe, may be submitted\r\nwithout irreverence to earnest discussion. When a tenth part of the\r\nfunds annually devoted to researches in and examination of old\r\nchronicles, is applied to making extracts from the registers relative to\r\nthe French Revolution, we shall certainly see many other hideous\r\ncircumstances that revolt the soul, disappear from our contemporary\r\nhistory. Look at the massacres of September! The historians most in\r\nvogue report the number of victims that fell in that butchery to have\r\nbeen from six to twelve thousand; whilst a writer who has lately taken\r\nthe trouble to analyze the prison registers in the gaoler's books,\r\ncannot make the whole amount to one thousand. Even this number is very\r\nlarge; but, for my part, I thank the author of this recent publication\r\nfor having reduced the number of assassinations in September to less\r\nthan a tenth part of what had been generally admitted.\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion which I have here undertaken becomes known to the\r\npublic, it will be seen how many and how important are the retrenchments\r\nto be made from that lugubrious page of our history. Another important\r\ncircumstance may be appreciated, which appears to me to arise from all\r\nthese facts. After having weighed my proofs, every one I hope will join\r\nme in seeing that the wretches around the scaffold of Bailly were but\r\nthe refuse of the population, fulfilling for pay the part that had been\r\nassigned them by three or four wealthy cannibals.\r\n\r\nThe sentence pronounced against Bailly by the Revolutionary Tribunal was\r\nto be executed on the 12th of November, 1793. The reminiscences recently\r\npublished by a fellow-prisoner of our colleague, the reminiscences of M.\r\nBeugnot, will enable us to penetrate into the Conciergerie, on the\r\nmorning of that inauspicious day.\r\n\r\nBailly had risen early, after having slept as usual, the sleep of the\r\njust. He took some chocolate, and conversed a long time with his\r\nnephew. The young man was a prey to despair, but the illustrious\r\nprisoner preserved all his serenity. The previous evening in returning\r\nfrom the Tribunal, he remarked, with admirable coolness, though\r\nspringing from a certain disquietude, \"that the spectators of his trial\r\nhad been strongly excited against him. I fear,\" he added, \"that the mere\r\nexecution of the sentence will no longer satisfy them, which might be\r\ndangerous in its consequences. Perhaps the police will provide against\r\nit.\" These reflections having recurred to Bailly's mind on the 12th, he\r\nasked for, and drank hastily, two cups of coffee without milk. These\r\nprecautions were a sinister omen. To his friends who surrounded him at\r\nthis awful moment, and were sobbing aloud, he said, \"Be calm; I have\r\nrather a difficult journey to perform, and I distrust my constitution.\r\nCoffee excites and reanimates; I hope, however, to reach the end\r\nproperly.\"\r\n\r\nNoon had just struck. Bailly addressed a last and tender adieu to his\r\ncompanions in captivity, wished them a better fate, followed the\r\nexecutioner without weakness as well as without bravado, mounted the\r\nfatal cart, his hands tied behind his back. Our colleague was accustomed\r\nto say: \"We must entertain a bad opinion of those who, in their dying\r\nmoments, have not a look to cast behind them.\" Bailly's last look was\r\ntowards his wife. A gendarme of the escort feelingly listened to his\r\nlast words, and faithfully repeated them to his widow. The procession\r\nreached the entrance to the Champ de Mars, on the side towards the\r\nriver, at a quarter past one o'clock. This was the place where,\r\naccording to the words of the sentence, the scaffold had been raised.\r\nThe blinded crowd collected there, furiously exclaimed that the sacred\r\nground of the Champ de la Fédération should not be soiled by the\r\npresence and by the blood of him whom they called a great criminal. Upon\r\ntheir demand (I had almost said their orders), the scaffold was taken\r\ndown again, and carried piecemeal into one of the fosses, where it was\r\nput up afresh. Bailly remained the stern witness of these frightful\r\npreparations, and of these infernal clamours. Not one complaint escaped\r\nfrom his lips. Rain had been falling all the morning; it was cold; it\r\ndrenched the body, and especially the bare head, of the venerable man. A\r\nwretch saw that he was shivering, and cried out to him, _\"Thou\r\ntremblest, Bailly.\"_--\"_I am cold, my friend_,\" mildly answered the\r\nvictim. These were his last words.\r\n\r\nBailly descended into the moat, where the executioner burnt before him\r\nthe red flag of the 17th July; he then with a firm step mounted the\r\nscaffold. Let us have the courage to say it, when the head of our\r\nvenerable colleague fell, the paid witnesses whom this horrid execution\r\nhad assembled on the Champ de Mars burst into infamous acclamations.\r\n\r\nI had announced a faithful recital of the martyrdom of Bailly; I have\r\nkept my word. I said that I should banish many circumstances without\r\nreality, and that the drama would thus become less atrocious. If I am to\r\ntrust your aspect, I have not accomplished the second part of my\r\npromise. The imagination perhaps cannot reach beyond the cruel facts on\r\nwhich I have been obliged to dilate. You ask what I can have retrenched\r\nfrom former relations, whilst what remains is so deplorable.\r\n\r\nThe order for execution addressed by Fouquier Tinville to the\r\nexecutioner has been seen by several persons now living. They all\r\ndeclare that if it differs from the numerous orders of a similar nature\r\nthat the wretch sent off daily, it was only by the substitution of the\r\nfollowing words: \"Esplanade du Champ de Mars,\" for the usual designation\r\nof \"Place de la Revolution.\" Now, the Revolutionary Tribunal has\r\ndeserved many anathemas, but I never remarked its being reproached with\r\nnot having known how to enforce obedience.\r\n\r\nI felt myself relieved from an immense weight, Gentlemen, when I could\r\ndispel from my thoughts the image of a melancholy march on foot of two\r\nhours, because with it there disappeared two hours of corporeal\r\nill-usage, which, according to those same accounts, our virtuous\r\ncolleague must have endured from the Conciergerie to the Champ de Mars.\r\n\r\nAn illustrious writer asserts that they conducted Bailly to the Place de\r\nla Revolution, that the scaffold there was taken to pieces on the\r\nmultitude demanding it, and that the victim was then led to the Champ de\r\nMars. This relation is not correct. The sentence expressed in positive\r\nterms, that, as an exception, the Square of the Revolution was not to be\r\nthe scene of Bailly's execution. The procession went direct to the place\r\ndesignated.\r\n\r\nThe historian already quoted affirms that the scaffold on being put up\r\nagain on the bank of the Seine was erected on a heap of rubbish; that\r\nthis operation lasted some hours, and that Bailly meanwhile was drawn\r\nround the Champ de Mars several times.\r\n\r\nThese promenades are imaginary. Those men who on the arrival of the\r\nlugubrious procession vociferated that the presence of the old Mayor of\r\nParis would soil the Champ de la Fédération, could not the next minute\r\nforce him to make the circuit of it. In fact, the illustrious victim\r\nremained in the road. The cruel idea, so knowingly attributed to the\r\nactors of those hideous scenes, to raise the fatal instrument on a heap\r\nof rubbish on the river bank, so that Bailly might in his last moments\r\nsee the house at Chaillot where he had composed his works, was so far\r\nfrom occurring to the mind of the multitude, that the sentence was\r\nexecuted in the moat between two walls.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it my duty, Gentlemen, to represent the condemned man\r\nforced to carry some parts of the scaffold himself, because he had his\r\nhands tied behind his back. In my recital nobody waves the burning red\r\nflag over Bailly's head, because this barbarity is not mentioned in the\r\nnarratives, otherwise so shocking, drawn up by some friends of our\r\ncolleague shortly after the event; nor have I consented, with the author\r\nof _The History of the French Revolution_, to represent one of the\r\nsoldiers forming the escort asking the question that led the victim to\r\nmake, we must say so, the theatrical answer: \"Yes, I tremble, but it is\r\nwith cold;\" but the more touching answer, so characteristic of Bailly;\r\n\"Yes, my friend, I am cold.\"\r\n\r\nFar be it from me, Gentlemen, to suppose that no soldier in the world\r\nwould be capable of a despicable and culpable act. I do not ask,\r\nassuredly, the suppression of all courts-martial; but to be induced to\r\nattribute to a man dressed in a military uniform, a personal part in\r\nthis frightful drama, proofs or contemporary testimonies would be\r\nrequired, of which I have found no trace.\r\n\r\nIf the fact had occurred, its results would certainly have become known\r\nto the public. I take to witness an event which is found related in\r\nBailly's Memoirs.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of July, 1789, on the square of the Hôtel de Ville, a dragoon\r\nwith his sabre mutilated the corpse of Berthier. His comrades, feeling\r\noutraged by this barbarity, all showed themselves instantly resolved to\r\nfight him in succession, and so wash out in his blood the disgrace he\r\nhad thrown on the whole corps. The dragoon fought that same evening and\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\nIn his _History of Prisons_, Riouffe says that \"Bailly exhausted the\r\nferocity of the populace, of whom he had been the idol, and was basely\r\nabandoned by the people, though they had never ceased to esteem him.\"\r\n\r\nNearly the same idea is found expressed in _The History of the\r\nRevolution_, and in several other works.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the populace rarely read and did not write. To attack it\r\nand calumniate it therefore was a convenient thing, since no refutation\r\nneed to be feared. I am far from supposing that the historians whose\r\nworks I have quoted, ever gave way to such considerations; but I affirm,\r\nwith entire certainty, that they have deceived themselves. In the\r\nsanguinary drama that has been unrolled before your eyes, the atrocities\r\nhad a quite different source from the sentiments common to the\r\nbarbarians that were swarming in the dregs of society and always ready\r\nto soil it with every crime; in plainer words, it is not to the\r\nunfortunate people who have neither property, nor capital, living by the\r\nwork of their hands, to the _prolétaires_, that we are to impute the\r\ndeplorable incidents which marked Bailly's last moments. To put forward\r\nan opinion so remote from received opinions, is imposing on one's self\r\nthe duty of proving its truth.\r\n\r\nAfter his condemnation, our colleague exclaimed, says La Fayette: \"I die\r\nfor the sitting of the Jeu de Paume, and not for the fatal day at the\r\nChamp de Mars.\" I do not here intend to expound these mysterious words\r\nin the glimpses they give us by a half-light; but, whatever meaning we\r\nmay attribute to them, it is evident that the sentiments and passions of\r\nthe lower class have no share in them; it is a point beyond discussion.\r\n\r\nOn reëntering the Conciergerie, the evening before his death, Bailly\r\nspoke of the efforts that must have been made to excite the passions of\r\nthe auditors, who followed the various phases of his trial. Factitious\r\nexcitement is always the produce of corruption. The working classes are\r\nwithout money;, they then cannot have been the corruptors or direct\r\npromoters of the distressing scenes of which Bailly complained.\r\n\r\nThe implacable enemies of the former President of the National Assembly\r\nhad procured for pay some auxiliaries among the turnkeys of the\r\nConciergerie. M. Beugnot informs us that when the venerable magistrate\r\nwas consigned to the gendarmes who were to conduct him to the Tribunal,\r\n\"these wretches pushed him violently, sending him from one to the other\r\nlike a drunken man, calling out: _Hold there, Bailly! Catch, Bailly,\r\nthere!_ and that they laughed and shouted at the grave demeanour the\r\nphilosopher maintained amidst the insults of those cannibals.\"\r\n\r\nTo confirm my statement that these violences (in comparison with which,\r\nin truth, those of the Champ de Mars lose their virulence,) were\r\nfomented by pay, I have more than the formal declaration of our\r\ncolleague's fellow prisoner. For in fact I find that no other prisoner\r\nor convict underwent such treatment; not even the man called the\r\nAdmiral, when he was taken to the Conciergerie for having attempted to\r\nassassinate Collot-d'Herbois.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is not only on indirect considerations that my decided\r\nopinion is founded relative to the intervention of rich and influential\r\npeople in those scenes of indescribable barbarity on the Champ de Mars.\r\nMérard St. Just, the intimate friend of Bailly, has alluded by his\r\ninitials to a wretch who, the very day of our colleague's death,\r\npublicly boasted of having electrified the few acolytes who, together\r\nwith him, insisted on the removal of the scaffold; the day after the\r\nexecution, the meeting of the Jacobins reëchoed with the name of another\r\nindividual of the Gros Caillou, who also claimed his share of influence\r\nin the crime.\r\n\r\nI have progressively unrolled before you the series of events in our\r\nrevolution, in which Bailly took an active part; I have scrupulously\r\nsearched out the smallest circumstances of the deplorable affair on the\r\nChamp de Mars; I have followed our colleague in his proscription to the\r\nRevolutionary Tribunal, and to the foot of the scaffold. We had seen him\r\nbefore, surrounded by esteem, by respect, and by glory, in the bosom of\r\nour principal academies. Yet the work is not complete; several essential\r\ntraits are still wanting.\r\n\r\nI will therefore claim a few more minutes of your kind attention. The\r\nmoral life of Bailly is like those masterpieces of ancient sculpture,\r\nthat deserve to be studied in every point of view, and in which new\r\nbeauties are continually discovered, in proportion as the contemplation\r\nis prolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF BAILLY.--HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nNature did not endow Bailly generously with those exterior advantages\r\nthat please us at first sight. He was tall and thin. His visage\r\ncompressed, his eyes small and sunk, his nose regular, but of unusual\r\nlength, and a very brown complexion, constituted an imposing whole,\r\nsevere and almost glacial. Fortunately, it was easy to perceive through\r\nthis rough bark, the inexhaustible benevolence of the good man; the\r\nkindness that always accompanies a serene mind, and even some rudiments\r\nof gayety.\r\n\r\nBailly early endeavoured to model his conduct on that of the Abbé de\r\nLacaille, who directed his first steps in the career of astronomy. And\r\ntherefore it will be found that in transcribing five or six lines of the\r\nvery feeling eulogy that the pupil dedicated to the memory of his\r\nrevered master, I shall have made known at the same time many of the\r\ncharacteristic traits of the panegyrist:\r\n\r\n\"He was cold and reserved towards those of whom he knew little; but\r\ngentle, simple, equable, and familiar in the intercourse of friendship.\r\nIt is there that, throwing off the grave exterior which he wore in\r\npublic, he gave himself up to a peaceful and amiable gayety.\"\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between Bailly and Lacaille goes no farther. Bailly\r\ninforms us that the great astronomer proclaimed truth on all occasions,\r\nwithout disquieting himself as to whom it might wound. He would not\r\nconsent to put vice at its ease, saying:\r\n\r\n\"If good men thus showed their indignation, bad men being known, and\r\nvice unmasked, could no longer do harm, and virtue would be more\r\nrespected.\" This Spartan morality could not accord with Bailly's\r\ncharacter; he admired but did not adopt it.\r\n\r\nTacitus took as a motto: \"To say nothing false, to omit nothing true.\"\r\nOur colleague contented himself in society with the first half of the\r\nprecept. Never did mockery, bitterness, or severity issue from his lips.\r\nHis manners were a medium between those of Lacaille and the manners of\r\nanother academician who had succeeded in not making a single enemy, by\r\nadopting the two axioms: \"Every thing is possible, and everybody is in\r\nthe right.\"\r\n\r\nCrébillon obtained permission from the French Academy to make his\r\nreception discourse in verse. At the moment when that poet, then almost\r\nsixty years of age, said, speaking of himself,\r\n\r\n     \"No gall has ever poisoned my pen,\"\r\n\r\nthe hall reëchoed with approbation.\r\n\r\nI was going to apply this line by the author of _Rhadamistus_ to our\r\ncolleague, when accident offered to my sight a passage in which Lalande\r\nreproaches Bailly for having swerved from his usual character, in 1773,\r\nin a discussion that they had together on a point in the theory of\r\nJupiter's Satellites. I set about the search for this discussion; I\r\nfound the article by Bailly in a journal of that epoch, and I affirm\r\nthat this dispute does not contain a word but what is in harmony with\r\nall our colleague's published writings. I return therefore to my former\r\nidea, and say of Bailly, with perfect confidence,\r\n\r\n     \"No gall had ever poisoned his pen.\"\r\n\r\nDiffidence is usually the trait that the biographers of studious men\r\nendeavour most to put in high relief. I dare assert, that in the common\r\nacceptation, this is pure flattery. To merit the epithet of diffident,\r\nmust we think ourselves beneath the competitors of whom we are at least\r\nthe equals? Must we, in examining ourselves, fail in the tact, in the\r\nintelligence, in the judgment, that nature has awarded us, and of which\r\nwe make so good a use in appreciating the works of others? Oh! then, few\r\nlearned men can be said to be diffident. Look at Newton: his diffidence\r\nis almost as celebrated as his genius. Well, I will extract from two of\r\nhis letters, scarcely known, two paragraphs which, put side by side,\r\nwill excite some surprise; the first confirms the general opinion; the\r\nsecond seems with equal force to contradict it. Here are the two\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n\"We are diffident in the presence of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may nobly feel our own strength in the face of man's works.\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the opposition in these two passages is only apparent; it\r\nwill he explained by means of a distinction which I have already\r\nslightly indicated.\r\n\r\nBailly's diffidence required the same distinction. When people praised\r\nhim to his face on the diversity of his knowledge, our colleague did not\r\nimmediately repel the compliment; but soon after, he would stop his\r\npanegyrist, and whisper in his ear with an air of mystery: \"I will\r\nconfide a secret to you, pray do not take advantage of it: I am only a\r\nvery little less ignorant than another man.\"\r\n\r\nNever did a man act more in harmony with his principles. Bailly was led\r\nto reprimand severely a man belonging to the humblest and poorest class\r\nof society. Anger does not make him forget that he speaks to a citizen,\r\nto a man. \"I ask pardon,\" says the first magistrate of the capital,\r\naddressing himself to a rag-gatherer; \"I ask your pardon, if I am angry;\r\nbut your conduct is so reprehensible, that I cannot speak to you\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nBailly's friends were wont to say that he devoted too much of his\r\npatrimony to pleasure. This word was calumniously interpreted. Mérard\r\nSaint Just has given the true sense of it: \"Bailly's pleasure was\r\nbeneficence.\"\r\n\r\nSo eminent a mind could not fail to be tolerant. Such in fact Bailly\r\nconstantly showed himself in politics, and what is almost equally rare,\r\nin regard to religion. In the month of June, 1791, he checked in severe\r\nterms the fury with which the multitude appeared to be excited, at the\r\nreport that at the Théatines some persons had taken the Communion two\r\nor three times in one day. \"The accusation is undoubtedly false,\" said\r\nthe Mayor of Paris; \"but if it were true, the public would not have a\r\nright to inquire into it. Every one should have the free choice of his\r\nreligion and his creed.\" Nothing would have been wanting in the picture,\r\nif Bailly had taken the trouble to remark how strange it was, that these\r\nviolent scruples against repeated Communions emanated from persons who\r\nprobably never took the Sacrament at all.\r\n\r\nThe reports on animal magnetism, on the hospitals, on the\r\nslaughter-houses, had carried Bailly's name into regions, whence the\r\ncourtiers knew very cleverly how to discard true merit. _Madame_ then\r\nwished to attach the illustrious academician to her person as a cabinet\r\nsecretary. Bailly accepted. It was an entirely honorary title. The\r\nsecretary saw the princess only once, that was on the day of his\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nWere more important functions reserved for him? We must suppose so; for\r\nsome influential persons offered to procure Bailly a title of nobility\r\nand a decoration. This time the philosopher flatly refused, saying, in\r\nanswer to the earnest negotiators: \"I thank you, but he who has the\r\nhonour of belonging to the three principal academies of France is\r\nsufficiently decorated, sufficiently noble in the eyes of rational men;\r\na cordon, or a title, could add nothing to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe first secretary of the Academy of Sciences had, some years before,\r\nacted as Bailly did. Only he gave his refusal in such strong terms, that\r\nI could not easily believe them to have been written by the timid pen of\r\nFontenelle, if I did not find them in a perfectly authentic document, in\r\nwhich he says: \"Of all the titles in this world, I have never had any\r\nbut of one sort, the titles of Academician, and they have not been\r\nprofaned by an admixture of any others, more worldly and more\r\nostentatious.\"\r\n\r\nBailly married, in November, 1787, an intimate friend of his mother's,\r\nalready a widow, only two years younger than himself. Madame Bailly, a\r\ndistant relation of the author of the _Marseillaise_, had an attachment\r\nfor her husband that bordered on adoration. She lavished on him the most\r\ntender and affectionate attention. The success that Madame Bailly might\r\nhave had in the fashionable world by her beauty, her grace, by her\r\nineffable goodness, did not tempt her. She lived in almost absolute\r\nretirement, even when the learned academician was most in society. The\r\nMayor's wife appeared only at one public ceremony: the day of the\r\nbenediction of the colours of the sixty battalions of the National Guard\r\nby the Archbishop of Paris, she accompanied Madame de Lafayette to the\r\nCathedral. She said: \"My husband's duty is to show himself in public\r\nwherever there is any good to be done, or sound advice to be given; mine\r\nis to remain at home.\" This rare retiring and respectable conduct did\r\nnot disarm some hideous pamphleteers. Their impudent sarcasms were\r\ncontinually attacking the modest wife on her domestic hearth, and\r\ntroubling her peace of mind. In their logic of the tavern they fancied\r\nthat an elegant and handsome woman, who avoided society, could not fail\r\nto be ignorant and stupid. Thence arose a thousand imaginary stories,\r\nridiculous both as to their matter and form, thrown out daily to the\r\npublic, more, indeed, to offend and disgust the upright magistrate than\r\nto humble his companion.\r\n\r\nThe axe that ended our colleague's life, with the same stroke, and\r\nalmost as completely, crushed in Madame Bailly, after so many poignant\r\nagitations and unexampled misfortunes, all that was left of strength of\r\nmind and power of intellect. A strange incident also aggravated the\r\nsadness of Madame Bailly's situation. On a day of trouble, during her\r\nhusband's lifetime, she had placed the assignats resulting from the sale\r\nof their house at Chaillot, amounting to about thirty thousand francs,\r\nin the wadding of a dress. The enfeebled memory of the unfortunate widow\r\ndid not recall to her the existence of this treasure, even in the time\r\nof her greatest distress. When the age of the material which had\r\nsecreted them began to reveal them to daylight, they were no longer of\r\nany value.\r\n\r\nThe widow of the author of one of the best works of the age, of the\r\nlearned member of our three great academies, of the first President of\r\nthe National Assembly, of the first Mayor of Paris, found herself thus\r\nreduced, by an unheard-of turn of fortune, to implore help from public\r\npity. It was the geometer Cousin, member of this academy, who by his\r\nincessant solicitations got Madame Bailly's name inserted at the Board\r\nof Charity in his arrondissement. The support was distributed in kind.\r\nCousin used to receive the articles at the Hôtel de Ville, where he was\r\na Municipal Councillor, and carried them himself to the street de la\r\nSourdière. It was, in short, in the street de la Sourdière that Madame\r\nBailly had obtained two rooms gratis, in the house of a compassionate\r\nperson, whose name I very much regret not having learnt. Does it not\r\nappear to you, Gentlemen, that the academician Cousin, who crossed the\r\nwhole of Paris, with the bread under his arm and the meat and the\r\ncandle, intended for the unfortunate widow of an illustrious colleague,\r\ndid himself more honour than if he had come to one of the sittings\r\nbringing in his portfolio the results of some fine scientific research?\r\nSuch noble actions are certainly worth good \"Papers.\"\r\n\r\nAffairs proceeded thus up to the revolution of the 18th Brumaire. On the\r\n21st, the public criers were announcing everywhere, even in the street\r\nde la Sourdière, that General Bonaparte was Consul, and M. de Laplace\r\nMinister of the Interior. This name, so well known by the respectable\r\nwidow, reached even the room that she inhabited, and caused her some\r\nemotion. That same evening, the new minister (this was a noble\r\nbeginning, Gentlemen) asked for a pension of 2000 francs for Madame\r\nBailly. The Consul granted the demand, adding to it this express\r\ncondition, that the first half year should be paid in advance, and\r\nimmediately. Early on the 22d, a carriage stopped in the street de la\r\nSourdière; Madame de Laplace descends from it, carrying in her hand a\r\npurse filled with gold. She rushed to the staircase, runs to the humble\r\nabode, that had now for several years witnessed irremediable sorrow and\r\nsevere misery; Madame Bailly was at the window: \"My dear friend, what\r\nare you doing there so early?\" exclaimed the wife of the minister.\r\n\"Madam,\" replied the widow, \"I heard the public crier yesterday, and I\r\nwas expecting you!\"\r\n\r\nIf after having, from a sense of duty, expatiated upon anarchical,\r\nodious, and sanguinary scenes, the historian of our civil discords has\r\nthe good fortune to meet on his progress with an incident that gratifies\r\nthe mind, raises the soul, and fills the heart with pleasing emotions,\r\nhe stops there, Gentlemen, as the African traveller halts in an oasis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschel, one of the greatest astronomers that ever lived in any\r\nage or country, was born at Hanover, on the 15th of November, 1738. The\r\nname of Herschel has become too illustrious for people to neglect\r\nsearching back, up the stream of time, to learn the social position of\r\nthe families that have borne it. Yet the just curiosity of the learned\r\nworld on this subject has not been entirely satisfied. We only know that\r\nAbraham Herschel, great-grandfather of the astronomer, resided at\r\nMähren, whence he was expelled on account of his strong attachment to\r\nthe Protestant faith; that Abraham's son Isaac was a farmer in the\r\nvicinity of Leipzig; that Isaac's eldest son, Jacob Herschel, resisted\r\nhis father's earnest desire to see him devote himself to agriculture,\r\nthat he determined on being a musician, and settled at Hanover.\r\n\r\nJacob Herschel, father of William, the astronomer, was an eminent\r\nmusician; nor was he less remarkable for the good qualities of his heart\r\nand of his mind. His very limited means did not enable him to bestow a\r\ncomplete education on his family, consisting of six boys and four girls.\r\nBut at least, by his care, his ten children all became excellent\r\nmusicians. The eldest, Jacob, even acquired a rare degree of ability,\r\nwhich procured for him the appointment of Master of the Band in a\r\nHanoverian regiment, which he accompanied to England. The third son,\r\nWilliam, remained under his father's roof. Without neglecting the fine\r\narts, he took lessons in the French language, and devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of metaphysics, for which he retained a taste to his latest day.\r\n\r\nIn 1759, William Herschel, then about twenty-one years old, went over to\r\nEngland, not with his father, as has been erroneously published, but\r\nwith his brother Jacob, whose connections in that country seemed likely\r\nto favour the young man's opening prospects in life. Still, neither\r\nLondon nor the country towns afforded him any resource in the beginning,\r\nand the first two or three years after his expatriation were marked by\r\nsome cruel privations, which, however, were nobly endured. A fortunate\r\nchance finally raised the poor Hanoverian to a better position; Lord\r\nDurham engaged him as Master of the Band in an English regiment which\r\nwas quartered on the borders of Scotland. From this moment the musician\r\nHerschel acquired a reputation that spread gradually, and in the year\r\n1765 he was appointed organist at Halifax (Yorkshire). The emoluments of\r\nthis situation, together with giving private lessons both in the town\r\nand the country around, procured a degree of comfort for the young\r\nWilliam. He availed himself of it to remedy, or rather to complete, his\r\nearly education. It was then that he learnt Latin and Italian, though\r\nwithout any other help than a grammar and a dictionary. It was then also\r\nthat he taught himself something of Greek. So great was the desire for\r\nknowledge with which he was inspired while residing at Halifax, that\r\nHerschel found means to continue his hard philological exercises, and at\r\nthe same time to study deeply the learned but very obscure mathematical\r\nwork on the theory of music by R. Smith. This treatise, either\r\nexplicitly or implicitly, supposed the reader to possess some knowledge\r\nof algebra and of geometry, which Herschel did not possess, but of which\r\nhe made himself master in a very short time.\r\n\r\nIn 1766, Herschel obtained the appointment of organist to the Octagon\r\nChapel at Bath. This was a more lucrative post than that of Halifax, but\r\nnew obligations also devolved on the able pianist. He had to play\r\nincessantly either at the Oratorios, or in the rooms at the baths, at\r\nthe theatre, and in the public concerts. Then, being immersed in the\r\nmost fashionable circle in England, Herschel could no longer refuse the\r\nnumerous pupils who wished to be instructed in his school. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine how, among so many duties, so many distractions of\r\nvarious kinds, Herschel could continue so many studies, which already at\r\nHalifax had required in him so much resolution, so much perseverance,\r\nand a very uncommon degree of talent. We have already seen that it was\r\nby music that Herschel was led to mathematics; mathematics in their turn\r\nled him to optics, the principal and fertile source of his illustrious\r\ncareer. The hour finally struck, when his theoretic knowledge was to\r\nguide the young musician into a laborious application of principles\r\nquite foreign to his habits; and the brilliant success of which, as well\r\nas their excessive hardihood, will excite reasonable astonishment.\r\n\r\nA telescope, a simple telescope, only two English feet in length, falls\r\ninto the hands of Herschel during his residence at Bath. This\r\ninstrument, however imperfect, shows him a multitude of stars in the sky\r\nthat the naked eye cannot discern; shows him also some of the known\r\nobjects, but now under their true dimensions; reveals forms to him that\r\nthe richest imaginations of antiquity had never suspected. Herschel is\r\ntransported with enthusiasm. He will, without delay, have a similar\r\ninstrument but of larger dimensions. The answer from London is delayed\r\nfor some days: these few days appear as many centuries to him. When the\r\nanswer arrives, the price that the optician demands proves to be much\r\nbeyond the pecuniary resources of a mere organist. To any other man this\r\nwould have been a clap of thunder. This unexpected difficulty on the\r\ncontrary, inspired Herschel with fresh energy; he cannot buy a\r\ntelescope, then he will construct one with his own hands. The musician\r\nof the Octagon Chapel rushes immediately into a multitude of\r\nexperiments, on metallic alloys that reflect light with the greatest\r\nintensity, on the means of giving the parabolic figure to the mirrors,\r\non the causes that in the operation of polishing affect the regularity\r\nof the figure, &c. So rare a degree of perseverance at last receives its\r\nreward. In 1774 Herschel has the happiness of being able to examine the\r\nheavens with a Newtonian telescope of five English feet focus, entirely\r\nmade by himself. This success tempts him to undertake still more\r\ndifficult enterprises. Other telescopes of seven, of eight, of ten, and\r\neven of twenty feet focal distance, crown his efforts. As if to answer\r\nin advance those critics who would have accused him of a superfluity of\r\napparatus, of unnecessary luxury, in the large size of the new\r\ninstruments, and his extreme minutiæ in their execution, Nature granted\r\nto the astronomical musician, on the 13th of March 1781, the unheard-of\r\nhonour of commencing his career of observation with the discovery of a\r\nnew planet, situated on the confines of our solar system. Dating from\r\nthat moment, Herschel's reputation, no longer in his character of\r\nmusician, but as a constructor of telescopes and as an astronomer,\r\nspread throughout the world. The King, George III., a great lover of\r\nscience, and much inclined besides to protect and patronize both men and\r\nthings of Hanoverian origin, had Herschel presented to him; he was\r\ncharmed with the simple yet lucid and modest account that he gave of his\r\nrepeated endeavours; he caught a glimpse of the glory that so\r\npenetrating an observer might reflect on his reign, ensured to him a\r\npension of 300 guineas a year, and moreover a residence near Windsor\r\nCastle, first at Clay Hall and then at Slough. The visions of George\r\nIII. were completely realized. We may confidently assert, relative to\r\nthe little house and garden of Slough, that it is the spot of all the\r\nworld where the greatest number of discoveries have been made. The name\r\nof that village will never perish; science will transmit it religiously\r\nto our latest posterity.\r\n\r\nI will avail myself of this opportunity to rectify a mistake, of which\r\nignorance and idleness wish to make a triumphant handle, or, at all\r\nevents, to wield in their cause as an irresistible justification. It has\r\nbeen repeated to satiety, that at the time when Herschel entered on his\r\nastronomical career he knew nothing of mathematics. But I have already\r\nsaid, that during his residence at Bath, the organist of the Octagon\r\nChapel had familiarized himself with the principles of geometry and\r\nalgebra; and a still more positive proof of this is, that a difficult\r\nquestion on the vibration of strings loaded with small weights had been\r\nproposed for discussion in 1779: Herschel undertook to solve it, and his\r\ndissertation was inserted in several scientific collections of the year\r\n1780.\r\n\r\nThe anecdotic life of Herschel, however, is now closed. The great\r\nastronomer will not quit his observatory any more, except to go and\r\nsubmit the sublime results of his laborious vigils to the Royal Society\r\nof London. These results are contained in his memoirs; they constitute\r\none of the principal riches of the celebrated collection known under the\r\ntitle of _Philosophical Transactions_.\r\n\r\nHerschel belonged to the principal Academies of Europe, and about 1816\r\nhe was named Knight of the Guelphic order of Hanover. According to the\r\nEnglish habit, from the time of that nomination the title of Sir William\r\ntook the place, in all this illustrious astronomer's memoirs, already\r\nhonoured with so much celebrity, of the former appellation of Doctor\r\nWilliam. Herschel had been named a Doctor (of laws) in the University of\r\nOxford in 1786. This dignity, by special favour, was conferred on him\r\nwithout any of the obligatory formalities of examination, disputation,\r\nor pecuniary contribution, usual in that learned corporation.\r\n\r\nI should wound the elevated sentiments that Herschel professed all his\r\nlife, if I were not here to mention two indefatigable assistants that\r\nthis fortunate astronomer found in his own family. The one was Alexander\r\nHerschel, endowed with a remarkable talent for mechanism, always at his\r\nbrother's orders, and who enabled him to realize without delay any ideas\r\nthat he had conceived;[15] the other was Miss Caroline Herschel, who\r\ndeserves a still more particular and detailed mention.\r\n\r\nMiss Caroline Lucretia Herschel went to England as soon as her brother\r\nbecame special astronomer to the king. She received the appellation\r\nthere of Assistant Astronomer, with a moderate salary. From that moment\r\nshe unreservedly devoted herself to the service of her brother, happy\r\nin contributing night and day to his rapidly increasing scientific\r\nreputation. Miss Caroline shared in all the night-watches of her\r\nbrother, with her eye constantly on the clock, and the pencil in her\r\nhand; she made all the calculations without exception; she made three or\r\nfour copies of all the observations in separate registers; coördinated,\r\nclassed, and analyzed them. If the scientific world saw with\r\nastonishment how Herschel's works succeeded each other with unexampled\r\nrapidity during so many years, they were specially indebted for it to\r\nthe ardour of Miss Caroline. Astronomy, moreover, has been directly\r\nenriched by several comets through this excellent and respectable lady.\r\nAfter the death of her illustrious brother, Miss Caroline retired to\r\nHanover, to the house of Jahn Dietrich Herschel, a musician of high\r\nreputation, and the only surviving brother of the astronomer.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschel died without pain on the 23d of August 1822, aged\r\neighty-three. Good fortune and glory never altered in him the fund of\r\ninfantine candour, inexhaustible benevolence, and sweetness of\r\ncharacter, with which nature had endowed him. He preserved to the last\r\nboth his brightness of mind and vigour of intellect. For some years\r\nHerschel enjoyed with delight the distinguished success of his only\r\nson,[16] Sir John Herschel. At his last hour he sunk to rest with the\r\npleasing conviction that his beloved son, heir of a great name, would\r\nnot allow it to fall into oblivion, but adorn it with fresh lustre, and\r\nthat great discoveries would honour his career also. No prediction of\r\nthe illustrious astronomer has been more completely verified.\r\n\r\nThe English journals gave an account of the means adopted by the family\r\nof William Herschel, for preserving the remains of the great telescope\r\nof thirty-nine English feet (twelve metres) constructed by that\r\ncelebrated astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe metal tube of the instrument carrying at one end the recently\r\ncleaned mirror of four feet ten inches in diameter, has been placed\r\nhorizontally in the meridian line, on solid piers of masonry, in the\r\nmidst of the circle, where formerly stood the mechanism requisite for\r\nmanoeuvring the telescope. The first of January 1840, Sir John\r\nHerschel, his wife, their children, seven in number, and some old family\r\nservants, assembled at Slough. Exactly at noon, the party walked several\r\ntimes in procession round the instrument; they then entered the tube of\r\nthe telescope, seated themselves on benches that had been prepared for\r\nthe purpose, and sung a requiem, with English words composed by Sir John\r\nHerschel himself. After their exit, the illustrious family ranged\r\nthemselves around the great tube, the opening of which was then\r\nhermetically sealed. The day concluded with a party of intimate friends.\r\n\r\nI know not whether those persons who will only appreciate things from\r\nthe peculiar point of view from which they have been accustomed to look,\r\nmay think there was something strange in several of the details of the\r\nceremony that I have just described. I affirm at least that the whole\r\nworld will applaud the pious feeling which actuated Sir John Herschel;\r\nand that all the friends of science will thank him for having\r\nconsecrated the humble garden where his father achieved such immortal\r\nlabours, by a monument more expressive in its simplicity than pyramids\r\nor statues.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] When age and infirmities obliged Alexander Herschel to\r\ngive up his profession as a musician, he quitted Bath, and\r\nreturned to Hanover, very generously provided by Sir William\r\nwith a comfortable independence for life.\r\n\r\n[16] Sir W. Herschel had married Mary, the widow of John Pitt,\r\nEsq., possessed of a considerable jointure, and the union\r\nproved a remarkable accession of domestic happiness. This lady\r\nsurvived Sir William by several years. They had but this\r\nson.--_Translator's Note_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE\r\n\r\nOF THE MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM HERSCHEL.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n     1780. _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. lxx.--Astronomical\r\n     Observations on the Periodical Star in the Neck of the\r\n     Whale.--Astronomical Observations relative to the Lunar Mountains.\r\n\r\n     1781. _Phil.

A systematic order will be preferable; it\r\nwill more distinctly fix the eminent place that Herschel will never\r\ncease to occupy in the small group of our contemporary men of genius,\r\nwhilst his name will reëcho to the most distant posterity. The variety\r\nand splendour of Herschel's labours vie with their extent. The more we\r\nstudy them, the more we must admire them. It is with great men, as it is\r\nwith great movements in the arts, we cannot understand them without\r\nstudying them under various points of view.\r\n\r\nLet us here again make a general reflection. The memoirs of Herschel\r\nare, for the greater part, pure and simple extracts from his\r\ninexhaustible journals of observations at Slough, accompanied by a few\r\nremarks. Such a table would not suit historical details. In these\r\nrespects the author has left almost every thing to his biographers to do\r\nfor him. And they must impose on themselves the task of assigning to the\r\ngreat astronomer's predecessors the portion that legitimately belongs to\r\nthem, out of the mass of discoveries, which the public (we must say) has\r\ngot into an erroneous habit of referring too exclusively to Herschel.\r\n\r\nAt one time I thought of adding a note to the analysis of each of the\r\nillustrious observer's memoirs, containing a detailed indication of the\r\nimprovements or corrections that the progressive march of science has\r\nbrought on. But in order to avoid an exorbitant length in this\r\nbiography, I have been obliged to give up my project. In general I shall\r\ncontent myself with pointing out what belongs to Herschel, referring to\r\nmy _Treatise on Popular Astronomy_ for the historical details. The life\r\nof Herschel had the rare advantage of forming an epoch in an extensive\r\nbranch of astronomy; it would require us almost to write a special\r\ntreatise on astronomy, to show thoroughly the importance of all the\r\nresearches that are due to him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[17] These titles are copied direct from the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, instead of being retranslated.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN THE MEANS OF OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nThe improvements that Herschel made in the construction and management\r\nof telescopes have contributed so directly to the discoveries with which\r\nthat observer enriched astronomy, that we cannot hesitate to bring them\r\nforward at once.\r\n\r\nI read the following passage in a Memoir by Lalande, printed in 1783,\r\nand forming part of the preface to vol. viii. of the _Ephemerides of the\r\nCelestial Motions_.\r\n\r\n\"Each time that Herschel undertakes to polish a mirror (of a telescope),\r\nhe condemns himself to ten, or twelve, or even fourteen hours' constant\r\nwork. He does not quit his workshop for a minute, not even to eat, but\r\nreceives from the hands of his sister that nourishment without which one\r\ncould not undergo such prolonged fatigue. Nothing in the world would\r\ninduce Herschel to abandon his work; for, according to him, it would be\r\nto spoil it.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantages that Herschel found in 1783, 1784, and 1785, in\r\nemploying telescopes of twenty feet and with large apertures, made him\r\nwish to construct much larger still. The expense would be considerable;\r\nKing George III. provided for it. The work, begun about the close of\r\n1785, was finished in August, 1789. This instrument had an iron\r\ncylindrical tube, thirty-nine feet four inches English in length, and\r\nfour feet ten inches in diameter. Such dimensions are enormous compared\r\nwith those of telescopes made till then. They will appear but small,\r\nhowever, to persons who have heard the report of a pretended ball given\r\nin the Slough telescope. The propagators of this popular rumour had\r\nconfounded the astronomer Herschel with the brewer Meux, and a cylinder\r\nin which a man of the smallest stature could scarcely stand upright,\r\nwith certain wooden vats, as large as a house, in which beer is made and\r\nkept in London.\r\n\r\nHerschel's telescope, forty English feet[18] in length, allowed of the\r\nrealization of an idea, the advantages of which would not be\r\nsufficiently appreciated if I did not here recall to mind some facts.\r\n\r\nIn any telescope, whether refracting or reflecting, there are two\r\nprincipal parts: the part that forms the aërial images of the distant\r\nobjects, and the small lens by the aid of which these images are\r\nenlarged just as if they consisted of radiating matter. When the image\r\nis produced by means of a lenticular glass, the place it occupies will\r\nbe found in the prolongation of the line that extends from the object to\r\nthe centre of the lens. The astronomer, furnished with an eye-piece, and\r\nwishing to examine that image, must necessarily place himself _beyond_\r\nthe point where the rays that form it have crossed each other; _beyond_,\r\nlet us carefully remark, means _farther off_ from the object-glass. The\r\nobserver's head, his body, cannot then injure the formation or the\r\nbrightness of the image, however small may be the distance from which we\r\nhave to study it. But it is no longer thus with the image formed by\r\nmeans of reflection. For the image is now placed between the object and\r\nthe reflecting mirror; and when the astronomer approaches in order to\r\nexamine it, he inevitably intercepts, if not the totality, at least a\r\nvery considerable portion of the luminous rays, which would otherwise\r\nhave contributed to give it great splendour. It will now be understood,\r\nwhy in optical instruments where the images of distant objects are\r\nformed by the reflection of light, it has been necessary to carry the\r\nimages, by the aid of a second reflection, out of the tube that contains\r\nand sustains the principal mirror. When the small mirror, on the surface\r\nof which the second reflection is effected, is plane, and inclined at an\r\nangle of 45° to the axis of the telescope; when the image is reflected\r\nlaterally, through an opening made near the edge of the tube and\r\nfurnished with an eye-piece; when, in a word, the astronomer looks\r\ndefinitively in a direction perpendicular to the line described by the\r\nluminous rays coming from the object and falling on the centre of the\r\ngreat mirror, then the telescope is called _Newtonian_. But in the\r\n_Gregorian_ telescope, the image formed by the principal mirror falls on\r\na second mirror, which is very small, slightly curved, and parallel to\r\nthe first. The small mirror reflects the first image and throws it\r\nbeyond the large mirror, through an opening made in the middle of that\r\nprincipal mirror.\r\n\r\nBoth in the one and in the other of these two telescopes, the small\r\nmirror interposed between the object and the great mirror forms relative\r\nto the latter a sort of screen which prevents its entire surface from\r\ncontributing towards forming the image. The small mirror, also, in\r\nregard to intensity, gives some trouble.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, in order to clear up our ideas, that the material of\r\nwhich the two mirrors are made, reflects only half of the incident\r\nlight. In the course of the first reflection, the immense quantity of\r\nrays that the aperture of the telescope had received, may be considered\r\nas reduced to half. Nor is the diminution less on the small mirror. Now,\r\nhalf of half is a quarter. Therefore the instrument will send to the eye\r\nof the observer only a quarter of the incident light that its aperture\r\nhad received. These two causes of diminished light not existing in a\r\nrefracting telescope, it would give, under parity of dimensions, four\r\ntimes more[19] light than a Newtonian or Gregorian telescope gives.\r\n\r\nHerschel did away with the small mirror in his large telescope. The\r\nlarge mirror is not mathematically centred in the large tube that\r\ncontains it, but is placed rather obliquely in it. This slight obliquity\r\ncauses the images to be formed not in the axis of the tube, but very\r\nnear its circumference, or outer mouth, we may call it. The observer may\r\ntherefore look at them there direct, merely by means of an eye-piece. A\r\nsmall portion of the astronomer's head, it is true, then encroaches on\r\nthe tube; it forms a screen, and interrupts some incident rays. Still,\r\nin a large telescope, the loss does not amount to half by a great deal;\r\nwhich it would inevitably do if the small mirror were there.\r\n\r\nThose telescopes, in which the observer, placed at the anterior\r\nextremity of the tube, looks direct into the tube and turns his back to\r\nthe objects, were called by Herschel _front view telescopes_. In vol.\r\nlxxvi. of the _Philosophical Transactions_ he says, that the idea of\r\nthis construction occurred to him in 1776, and that he then applied it\r\nunsuccessfully to a ten-foot telescope; that during the year 1784, he\r\nagain made a fruitless trial of it in a twenty-foot telescope. Yet I\r\nfind that on the 7th of September 1784, he recurred to a _front view_ in\r\nobserving some nebulæ and groups of stars. However discordant these\r\ndates may be, we cannot without injustice neglect to remark, that a\r\nfront view telescope was already described in 1732, in volume vi. of the\r\ncollection entitled _Machines and Inventions approved by the Academy of\r\nSciences_. The author of this innovation is Jaques Lemaire, who has been\r\nunduly confounded with the English Jesuit, Christopher Maire, assistant\r\nto Boscovitch, in measuring the meridian comprised between Rome and\r\nRimini. Jaques Lemaire having only telescopes of moderate dimensions in\r\nview, was obliged, in order not to sacrifice any of the light, to place\r\nthe great mirror so obliquely, that the image formed by its surface\r\nshould fall entirely outside the tube of the instrument. So great a\r\ndegree of inclination would certainly deform the objects. The _front\r\nview_ construction is admissible only in very large telescopes.\r\n\r\nI find in the _Transactions_ for 1803, that in solar observations,\r\nHerschel sometimes employed telescopes, the great mirror of which was\r\nmade of glass. It was a telescope of this sort that he used for\r\nobserving the transit of Mercury on the 9th of November, 1802. It was\r\nseven English feet long, and six inches and three tenths in diameter.\r\n\r\nPractical astronomers know how much the mounting of a telescope\r\ncontributes to produce correct observations. The difficulty of a solid\r\nyet very movable mounting, increases rapidly with the dimensions and\r\nweight of an instrument. We may then conceive that Herschel had to\r\nsurmount many obstacles, to mount a telescope suitably, of which the\r\nmirror alone weighed upwards of 1000 kilogrammes (_a ton_). But he\r\nsolved this problem to his entire satisfaction by the aid of a\r\ncombination of spars, of pulleys, and of ropes, of all which a correct\r\nidea may be formed by referring to the woodcut we have given in our\r\n_Treatise on Popular Astronomy_ (vol. i.). This great apparatus, and the\r\nentirely different stands that Herschel imagined for telescopes of\r\nsmaller dimensions, assign to that illustrious observer a distinguished\r\nplace amongst the most ingenious mechanics of our age.\r\n\r\nPersons in general, I may even say the greater part of astronomers, know\r\nnot what was the effect that the great forty-foot telescope had in the\r\nlabours and discoveries of Herschel. Still, we are not less mistaken\r\nwhen we fancy that the observer of Slough always used this telescope,\r\nthan in maintaining with Baron von Zach (see _Monatliche Correspondenz_,\r\nJanuary, 1802), that the colossal instrument was of no use at all, that\r\nit did not contribute to any one discovery, that it must be considered\r\nas a mere object of curiosity. These assertions are distinctly\r\ncontradicted by Herschel's own words. In the volume of _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for the year 1795 (p. 350), I read for example: \"On the\r\n28th of August 1789, having directed my telescope (of forty feet) to the\r\nheavens, I discovered the sixth satellite of Saturn, and I perceived the\r\nspots on that planet, better than I had been able to do before.\" (See\r\nalso, relative to this sixth satellite, the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1790, p. 10.) In that same volume of 1790, p. 11, I\r\nfind: \"The great light of my forty-foot telescope was then so useful,\r\nthat on the 17th of September 1789, I remarked the seventh satellite,\r\nthen situated at its greatest western elongation.\"\r\n\r\nThe 10th of October, 1791, Herschel saw the ring of Saturn and the\r\nfourth satellite, looking in at the mirror of his forty-foot telescope,\r\nwith his naked eye, without any sort of eye-piece.\r\n\r\nLet us acknowledge the true motives that prevented Herschel from oftener\r\nusing his telescope of forty feet. Notwithstanding the excellence of the\r\nmechanism, the manoeuvring of that instrument required the constant\r\naid of two labourers, and that of another person charged with noting the\r\ntime at the clock. During some nights when the variation of temperature\r\nwas considerable, this telescope, on account of its great mass, was\r\nalways behindhand with the atmosphere in thermometric changes, which was\r\nvery injurious to the distinctness of the images.\r\n\r\nHerschel found that in England, there are not above a hundred hours in a\r\nyear during which the heavens can be advantageously observed with a\r\ntelescope of forty feet, furnished with a magnifying power of a\r\nthousand. This remark led the celebrated astronomer to the conclusion,\r\nthat, to take a complete survey of the heavens with his large\r\ninstrument, though each successive field should remain only for an\r\ninstant under inspection, would not require less than eight hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHerschel explains in a very natural way the rare occurrence of the\r\ncircumstances in which it is possible to make good use of a telescope of\r\nforty feet, and of very large aperture.\r\n\r\nA telescope does not magnify real objects only, but magnifies also the\r\napparent irregularities arising from atmospheric refractions; now, all\r\nother things being equal, these irregularities of refraction must be so\r\nmuch the stronger, so much the more frequent, as the stratum of air is\r\nthicker through which the rays have passed to go and form the image.\r\n\r\nAstronomers experienced extreme surprise, when in 1782, they learned\r\nthat Herschel had applied linear magnifying powers of a thousand, of\r\ntwelve hundred, of two thousand two hundred, of two thousand six\r\nhundred, and even of six thousand times, to a reflecting telescope of\r\nseven feet in length. The Royal Society of London experienced this\r\nsurprise, and officially requested Herschel to give publicity to the\r\nmeans he had adopted for ascertaining such amounts of magnifying power\r\nin his telescopes. Such was the object of a memoir that he inserted in\r\nvol. lxxii. of the _Philosophical Transactions_; and it dissipated all\r\ndoubts. No one will be surprised that magnifying powers, which it would\r\nseem ought to have shown the Lunar mountains, as the chain of Mont Blanc\r\nis seen from Maçon, from Lyons, and even from Geneva, were not easily\r\nbelieved in. They did not know that Herschel had never used magnifying\r\npowers of three thousand, and six thousand times, except in observing\r\nbrilliant stars; they had not remembered that light reflected by\r\nplanetary bodies, is too feeble to continue distinct under the same\r\ndegree of magnifying power as the actual light of the fixed stars does.\r\n\r\nOpticians had given up, more from theory than from careful experiments,\r\nattempting high magnifying powers, even for reflecting telescopes. They\r\nthought that the image of a small circle cannot be distinct, cannot be\r\nsharp at the edges, unless the pencil of rays coming from the object in\r\nnearly parallel lines, and which enters the eye after having passed\r\nthrough the eye-piece, be sufficiently broad. This being once granted,\r\nthe inference followed, that an image ceases to be well defined, when it\r\ndoes not strike at least two of the nervous filaments of the retina with\r\nwhich that organ is supposed to be overspread. These gratuitous\r\ncircumstances, grafted on each other, vanished in presence of Herschel's\r\nobservations. After having put himself on his guard against the effects\r\nof diffraction, that is to say, against the scattering that light\r\nundergoes when it passes the terminal angles of bodies, the illustrious\r\nastronomer proved, in 1786, that objects can be seen well defined by\r\nmeans of pencils of light whose diameter does not equal five tenths of a\r\nmillimetre.\r\n\r\nHerschel looked on the almost unanimous opinion of the double lens\r\neye-piece being preferable to the single lens eye-piece, as a very\r\ninjurious prejudice in science. For experience proved to him,\r\nnotwithstanding all theoretic deductions, that with equal magnifying\r\npowers, in reflecting telescopes at least (and this restriction is of\r\nsome consequence), the images were brighter and better defined with\r\nsingle than with double eye-pieces. On one occasion, this latter\r\neye-piece would not show him the bands of Saturn, whilst by the aid of a\r\nsingle lens they were perfectly visible. Herschel said: \"The double\r\neye-piece must be left to amateurs and to those who, for some particular\r\nobject, require a large field of vision.\" (_Philosophical Transactions,\r\n1782, pages 94 and 95._)\r\n\r\nIt is not only relative to the comparative merit of single or double\r\neye-pieces that Herschel differs from the general opinions of opticians;\r\nhe thinks, moreover, that he has proved by decisive experiments, that\r\nconcave eye-pieces (like that used by Galileo) surpass the convex\r\neye-piece by a great deal, both as regards clearness and definition.\r\n\r\nHerschel assigns the date of 1776 to the experiments which he made to\r\ndecide this question. (_Philosophical Transactions_, year 1815, p. 297.)\r\nPlano-concave and double concave lenses produced similar effects. In\r\nwhat did these lenses differ from the double convex lenses? In one\r\nparticular only: the latter received the rays reflected by the large\r\nmirror of the telescope, after their union at the focus, whereas the\r\nconcave lenses received the same rays before that union. When the\r\nobserver made use of a convex lens, the rays that went to the back of\r\nthe eye to form an image on the retina, had crossed each other before in\r\nthe air; but no crossing of this kind took place when the observer used\r\na concave lens. Holding the double advantage of this latter sort of lens\r\nover the other, as quite proved, one would be inclined, like Herschel,\r\nto admit, \"that a certain mechanical effect, injurious to clearness and\r\ndefinition, would accompany the focal crossing of the rays of\r\nlight.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis idea of the crossing of the rays suggested an experiment to the\r\ningenious astronomer, the result of which deserves to be recorded.\r\n\r\nA telescope of ten English feet was directed towards an advertisement\r\ncovered with very small printing, and placed at a sufficient distance.\r\nThe convex lens of the eye-piece was carried not by a tube properly so\r\ncalled, but by four rigid fine wires placed at right angles. This\r\narrangement left the focus open in almost every direction. A concave\r\nmirror was then placed so that it threw a very condensed image of the\r\nsun laterally on the very spot where the image of the advertisement was\r\nformed. The solar rays, after having crossed each other, finding nothing\r\non their route, went on and lost themselves in space. A screen, however,\r\nallowed the rays to be intercepted at will before they united.\r\n\r\nThis done, having applied the eye to the eye-piece and directed all his\r\nattention to the telescopic image of the advertisement, Herschel did not\r\nperceive that the taking away and then replacing the screen made the\r\nleast change in the brightness or definition of the letters. It was\r\ntherefore of no consequence, in the one instance as well as in the\r\nother, whether the immense quantity of solar rays crossed each other at\r\nthe very place where, _in another direction_, the rays united that\r\nformed the image of the letters. I have marked in Italics the words that\r\nespecially show in what this curious experiment differs from the\r\nprevious experiments, and yet does not entirely contradict them. In this\r\ninstance the rays of various origin, those coming from the advertisement\r\nand from the sun, crossed each other respectively in almost rectangular\r\ndirections; during the comparative examination of the stars with convex\r\nand with concave eye-pieces, the rays that seemed to have a mutual\r\ninfluence, had a common origin and crossed each other at very acute\r\nangles. There seems to be nothing, then, in the difference of the\r\nresults at which we need to be much surprised.\r\n\r\nHerschel increased the catalogue, already so extensive, of the mysteries\r\nof vision, when he explained in what manner we must endeavour to\r\ndistinguish separately the two members of certain double stars very\r\nclose to each other. He said if you wish to assure yourself that _ê_\r\nCoronæ is a double star, first direct your telescope to _a_ Geminorum,\r\nto _z_ Aquarii, to _m_ Draconis, to _r_ Herculis, to _a_ Piscium, to _e_\r\nLyræ. Look at those stars for a long time, so as to acquire the habit of\r\nobserving such objects. Then pass on to _x_ Ursæ majoris, where the\r\ncloseness of the two members is still greater. In a third essay select\r\n_i_ Bootis (marked 44 by Flamsteed and _i_ in Harris's maps)[21], the\r\nstar that precedes _a_ Orionis, _n_ of the same constellation, and you\r\nwill then be prepared for the more difficult observation of _ê_ Coronæ.\r\nIndeed _ê_ Coronæ is a sort of miniature of _i_ Bootis, which may itself\r\nbe considered as a miniature of _a_ Gem. (_Philosophical Transactions_,\r\n1782, p. 100.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as Piazzi, Olbers, and Harding had discovered three of the\r\nnumerous telescopic planets now known, Herschel proposed to himself to\r\ndetermine their real magnitudes; but telescopes not having then been\r\napplied to the measurement of excessively small angles, it became\r\nrequisite, in order to avoid any illusion, to try some experiments\r\nadapted to giving a scale of the powers of those instruments. Such was\r\nthe labour of that indefatigable astronomer, of which I am going to give\r\na compressed abridgment.\r\n\r\nThe author relates first, that in 1774, he endeavoured to ascertain\r\nexperimentally, with the naked eye and at the distance of distinct\r\nvision, what angle a circle must subtend to be distinguished by its form\r\nfrom a square of similar dimensions. The angle was never smaller than 2'\r\n17\"; therefore at its maximum it was about one fourteenth of the angle\r\nsubtended by the diameter of the moon.\r\n\r\nHerschel did not say, either of what nature the circles and squares of\r\npaper were that he used, nor on what background they were projected. It\r\nis a lacuna to be regretted, for in those phenomena the intensity of\r\nlight must be an important feature. However it may have been, the\r\nscrupulous observer not daring to extend to telescopic vision what he\r\nhad discovered relative to vision with the naked eye, he undertook to do\r\naway with all doubt, by direct observations.\r\n\r\nOn examining some pins' heads placed at a distance in the open air, with\r\na three-foot telescope, Herschel could easily discern that those bodies\r\nwere round, when the subtended angles became, after their enlargement,\r\n2' 19\". This is almost exactly the result obtained with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nWhen the globules were darker; when, instead of pins' heads, small\r\nglobules of sealing-wax were used, their spherical form did not begin to\r\nbe distinctly visible till the moment when the subtended magnified\r\nangles, that is, the moment when the natural angle multiplied by the\r\nmagnifying power, amounted to five minutes.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent series of experiments, some globules of silver placed\r\nvery far from the observer, allowed their globular form to be perceived,\r\neven when the magnified angle remained below two minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder equality of subtended angle, then, the telescopic vision with\r\nstrong magnifying powers showed itself superior to the naked eye vision.\r\nThis result is not unimportant.\r\n\r\nIf we take notice of the magnifying powers used by Herschel in these\r\nlaborious researches, powers that often exceeded five hundred times, it\r\nwill appear to be established that the telescopes possessed by modern\r\nastronomers, may serve to verify the round form of distant objects, the\r\nform of celestial bodies even when the diameters of those bodies do not\r\nsubtend naturally (to the naked eye), angles of above three tenths of a\r\nsecond: and 500, multiplied by three tenths of a second, give 2' 30\".\r\n\r\nRefracting telescopes were still ill understood instruments, the result\r\nof chance, devoid of certain theory, when they already served to reveal\r\nbrilliant astronomical phenomena. Their theory, in as far as it depended\r\non geometry and optics, made rapid progress. These two early phases of\r\nthe problem leave but little more to be wished for; it is not so with a\r\nthird phase, hitherto a good deal neglected, connected with physiology,\r\nand with the action of light on the nervous system. Therefore, we should\r\nsearch in vain in old treatises on optics and on astronomy, for a strict\r\nand complete discussion on the comparative effect that the size and\r\nintensity of the images, that the magnifying power and the aperture of a\r\ntelescope may have, by night and by day, on the visibility of the\r\nfaintest stars. This lacuna Herschel tried to fill up in 1799; such was\r\nthe aim of the memoir entitled, _On the space-penetrating Power of\r\nTelescopes_.\r\n\r\nThis memoir contains excellent things; still, it is far from exhausting\r\nthe subject. The author, for instance, entirely overlooks the\r\nobservations made by day. I also find, that the hypothetical part of\r\nthe discussion is not perhaps so distinctly separated from the rigorous\r\npart as it might be; that disputable numbers, though given with a degree\r\nof precision down to the smallest decimals, do not look well as terms of\r\ncomparison with some results which; on the contrary, rest on\r\nobservations bearing mathematical evidence.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of these remarks, the astronomer or the\r\nphysicist who would like again to undertake the question of visibility\r\nwith telescopes, will find some important facts in Herschel's memoir,\r\nand some ingenious observations, well adapted to serve them as guides.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Conforming to general usage, and to Sir W. Herschel himself, we\r\nshall allude to this instrument as the _forty-foot_ telescope, though M.\r\nArago adheres to thirty-nine feet and drops the inches, probably because\r\nthe Parisian foot is rather longer than the English.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.\r\n\r\n[19] It would be more correct to say four times _as much_\r\nlight.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[20] On comparing the Cassegrain telescopes with a small convex mirror,\r\nto the Gregorian telescopes with a small concave mirror, Captain Kater\r\nfound that the former, in which the luminous rays do not cross each\r\nother before falling on the small mirror, possess, as to intensity, a\r\nmarked advantage over the latter, in which this crossing takes place.\r\n\r\n[21] In the selection of _i_ Bootis as a test, Arago has taken the\r\nprecaution of giving its corresponding denomination in other catalogues,\r\nand Bailey appends the following note, No. 2062, to 44 Bootis. \"In the\r\nBritish Catalogue this star is not denoted by any letter: but Bayer\r\ncalls it _i_, and on referring to the earliest MS. Catalogue in MSS.\r\nvol. xxv., I find it is there so designated; I have therefore restored\r\nthe letter.\" (See Bailey's Edition of Flamsteed's British Catalogue of\r\nStars, 1835.)

See \"Bedford Cycle.\"--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOURS IN SIDEREAL ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe curious phenomenon of a periodical change of intensity in certain\r\nstars, very early excited a keen attention in Herschel. The first memoir\r\nby that illustrious observer presented to the Royal Society of London\r\nand inserted in the _Philosophical Transactions_ treats precisely of the\r\nchanges of intensity of the star _o_ in the neck of the Whale.\r\n\r\nThis memoir was still dated from Bath, May, 1780. Eleven years after, in\r\nthe month of December, 1791, Herschel communicated a second time to that\r\ncelebrated English Society the remarks that he had made by sometimes\r\ndirecting his telescopes to the mysterious star. At both those epochs\r\nthe observer's attention was chiefly applied to the absolute values of\r\nthe _maxima_ and _minima_ of intensity.\r\n\r\nThe changeable star in the Whale was not the only periodical star with\r\nwhich Herschel occupied himself. His observations of 1795 and of 1796\r\nproved that _a_ Herculis also belongs to the category of variable stars,\r\nand that the time requisite for the accomplishment of all the changes\r\nof intensity, and for the star's return to any given state, was sixty\r\ndays and a quarter. When Herschel obtained this result, about ten\r\nchangeable stars were already known; but they were all either of very\r\nlong or very short periods. The illustrious astronomer considered that,\r\nby introducing between two groups that exhibited very short and very\r\nlong periods, a star of somewhat intermediate conditions,--for instance,\r\none requiring sixty days to accomplish all its variations of\r\nintensity,--he had advanced the theory of these phenomena by an\r\nessential step; the theory at least that attributes every thing to a\r\nmovement of rotation round their centres which the stars may undergo.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel's catalogues of double stars offer a considerable\r\nnumber to which he ascribes a decided green or blue tint. In binary\r\ncombinations, when the small star appears very blue or very green, the\r\nlarge one is usually yellow or red. It does not appear that the great\r\nastronomer took sufficient interest in this circumstance. I do not find,\r\nindeed, that the almost constant association of two complementary\r\ncolours (of yellow and blue, or of red and green), ever led him to\r\nsuspect that one of those colours might not have any thing real in it,\r\nthat it often might be a mere illusion, a mere result of contrast. It\r\nwas only in 1825, that I showed that there are stars whose contrast\r\nreally explains their apparent colour; but I have proved besides, that\r\nblue is incontestably the colour of certain insulated stars, or stars\r\nthat have only white ones, or other blue ones in their vicinity. Red is\r\nthe only colour that the ancients ever distinguished from white in their\r\ncatalogues.\r\n\r\nHerschel also endeavoured to introduce numbers in the classification of\r\nstars as to magnitude; he has endeavoured, by means of numbers, to show\r\nthe comparative intensity of a star of first magnitude, with one of\r\nsecond, or one of third magnitude, &c.\r\n\r\nIn one of the earliest of Herschel's memoirs, we find, that the apparent\r\nsidereal diameters are proved to be for the greater part factitious,\r\neven when the best made telescopes are used. Diameters estimated by\r\nseconds, that is to say, reduced according to the magnifying power,\r\ndiminish as the magnifying power is increased. These results are of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his investigation of sidereal parallax, though without\r\nfinding it, Herschel made an important discovery; that of the proper\r\nmotion of our system. To show distinctly the direction of the motion of\r\nthe solar system, not only was a displacement of the sidereal\r\nperspective required, but profound mathematical knowledge, and a\r\npeculiar tact. This peculiar tact Herschel possessed in an eminent\r\ndegree. Moreover, the result deduced from the very small number of\r\nproper motions known at the beginning of 1783, has been found almost to\r\nagree with that found recently by clever astronomers, by the application\r\nof subtile analytical formulæ, to a considerable number of exact\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe proper motions of the stars have been known and proved for more than\r\na century, and already Fontenelle used to say in 1738, that the sun\r\nprobably also moved in a similar way. The idea of partly attributing the\r\ndisplacement of the stars to a motion of the sun, had suggested itself\r\nto Bradley and to Mayer. And Lambert especially had been very explicit\r\non the subject. Until then, however, there were only conjectures and\r\nmere probabilities. Herschel passed those limits. He himself proved\r\nthat the sun positively moves; and that, in this respect also, that\r\nimmense and dazzling body must be ranged among the stars; that the\r\napparently inextricable irregularities of numerous sidereal proper\r\nmotions arise in great measure from the displacement of the solar\r\nsystem; that, in short, the point of space towards which we are annually\r\nadvancing, is situated in the constellation of Hercules.\r\n\r\nThese are magnificent results. The discovery of the proper motion of our\r\nsystem will always be accounted among Herschel's highest claims to\r\nglory, even after the mention that my duty as historian has obliged me\r\nto make of the anterior conjectures by Fontenelle, by Bradley, by Mayer,\r\nand by Lambert.\r\n\r\nBy the side of this great discovery we should place another, that seems\r\nlikely to expand in future. The results which it allows us to hope for\r\nwill be of extreme importance. The discovery here alluded to was\r\nannounced to the learned world in 1803; it is that of the reciprocal\r\ndependence of several stars, connected the one with the other, as the\r\nseveral planets and their satellites of our system are with the sun.\r\n\r\nLet us to these immortal labours add the ingenious ideas that we owe to\r\nHerschel on the nebulæ, on the constitution of the Milky-way, on the\r\nuniverse as a whole; ideas which almost by themselves constitute the\r\nactual history of the formation of the worlds, and we cannot but have a\r\ndeep reverence for that powerful genius that has scarcely ever erred,\r\nnotwithstanding an ardent imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOURS RELATIVE TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nHerschel occupied himself very much with the sun, but only relative to\r\nits physical constitution. The observations that the illustrious\r\nastronomer made on this subject, the consequences that he deduced from\r\nthem, equal the most ingenious discoveries for which the sciences are\r\nindebted to him.\r\n\r\nIn his important memoir in 1795, the great astronomer declares himself\r\nconvinced that the substance by the intermediation of which the sun\r\nshines, cannot be either a liquid, or an elastic fluid. It must be\r\nanalogous to our clouds, and float in the transparent atmosphere of that\r\nbody. The sun has, according to him, two atmospheres, endowed with\r\nmotions quite independent of each other. An elastic fluid of an unknown\r\nnature is being constantly formed on the dark surface of the sun, and\r\nrising up on account of its specific lightness, it forms the _pores_ in\r\nthe stratum of reflecting clouds; then, combining with other gases, it\r\nproduces the wrinkles in the region of luminous clouds. When the\r\nascending currents are powerful, they give rise to the _nuclei_, to the\r\n_penumbræ_, to the _faculæ_. If this explanation of the formation of\r\nsolar spots is well founded, we must expect to find that the sun does\r\nnot constantly emit similar quantities of light and heat. Recent\r\nobservations have verified this conclusion. But large nuclei, large\r\npenumbræ, wrinkles, faculæ, do they indicate an abundant luminous and\r\ncalorific emission, as Herschel thought; that would be the result of his\r\nhypothesis on the existence of very active ascending currents, but\r\ndirect experience seems to contradict it.\r\n\r\nThe following is the way in which a learned man, Sir David Brewster,\r\nappreciates this view of Herschel's: \"It is not conceivable that\r\nluminous clouds, ceding to the lightest impulses and in a state of\r\nconstant change, can be the source of the sun's devouring flame and of\r\nthe dazzling light which it emits; nor can we admit besides, that the\r\nfeeble barrier formed by planetary clouds would shelter the objects that\r\nit might cover, from the destructive effects of the superior elements.\"\r\n\r\nSir D. Brewster imagines that the non-luminous rays of caloric, which\r\nform a constituent part of the solar light, are emitted by the dark\r\nnucleus of the sun; whilst the visible coloured rays proceed from the\r\nluminous matter by which the nucleus is surrounded. \"From thence,\" he\r\nsays, \"proceeds the reason of light and heat always appearing in a state\r\nof combination: the one emanation cannot be obtained without the other.\r\nWith this hypothesis we should explain naturally why it is hottest when\r\nthere are most spots, because the heat of the nucleus would then reach\r\nus without having been weakened by the atmosphere that it usually has to\r\ntraverse.\" But it is far from being an ascertained fact, that we\r\nexperience increased heat during the apparition of solar spots; the\r\ninverse phenomenon is more probably true.\r\n\r\nHerschel occupied himself also with the physical constitution of the\r\nmoon. In 1780, he sought to measure the height of our satellite's\r\nmountains. The conclusion that he drew from his observations was, that\r\nfew of the lunar mountains exceed 800 metres (or 2600 feet). More recent\r\nselenographic studies differ from this conclusion. There is reason to\r\nobserve on this occasion how much the result surmised by Herschel\r\ndiffers from any tendency to the extraordinary or the gigantic, that\r\nhas been so unjustly assigned as the characteristic of the illustrious\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1787, Herschel presented a memoir to the Royal Society,\r\nthe title of which must have made a strong impression on people's\r\nimaginations. The author therein relates that on the 19th of April,\r\n1787, he had observed in the non-illuminated part of the moon, that is,\r\nin the then dark portion, three volcanoes in a state of ignition. Two of\r\nthese volcanoes appeared to be on the decline, the other appeared to be\r\nactive. Such was then Herschel's conviction of the reality of the\r\nphenomenon, that the next morning he wrote thus of his first\r\nobservation: \"The volcano burns with more violence than last night.\" The\r\nreal diameter of the volcanic light was 5000 metres (16,400 English\r\nfeet). Its intensity appeared very superior to that of the nucleus of a\r\ncomet then in apparition. The observer added: \"The objects situated near\r\nthe crater are feebly illuminated by the light that emanates from it.\"\r\nHerschel concludes thus: \"In short, this eruption very much resembles\r\nthe one I witnessed on the 4th of May, 1783.\"\r\n\r\nHow happens it, after such exact observations, that few astronomers now\r\nadmit the existence of active volcanoes in the moon? I will explain this\r\nsingularity in a few words.\r\n\r\nThe various parts of our satellite are not all equally reflecting. Here,\r\nit may depend on the form, elsewhere, on the nature of the materials.\r\nThose persons who have examined the moon with telescopes, know how very\r\nconsiderable the difference arising from these two causes may be, how\r\nmuch brighter one point of the moon sometimes is than those around it.\r\nNow, it is quite evident that the relations of intensity between the\r\nfaint parts and the brilliant parts must continue to exist, whatever be\r\nthe origin of the illuminating light. In the portion of the lunar globe\r\nthat is illuminated by the sun, there are, everybody knows, some points,\r\nthe brightness of which is extraordinary compared to those around them;\r\nthose same points, when they are seen in that portion of the moon that\r\nis only lighted by the earth, or in the ash-coloured part, will still\r\npredominate over the neighbouring regions by their comparative\r\nintensity. Thus we may explain the observations of the Slough\r\nastronomer, without recurring to volcanoes. Whilst the great observer\r\nwas studying in the non-illuminated portion of the moon, the supposed\r\nvolcano of the 20th of April, 1787, his nine-foot telescope showed him\r\nin truth, by the aid of the secondary rays proceeding from the earth,\r\neven the darkest spots.\r\n\r\nHerschel did not recur to the discussion of the supposed actually\r\nburning lunar volcanoes, until 1791. In the volume of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1792, he relates that, in directing a twenty-foot\r\ntelescope, magnifying 360 times, to the entirely eclipsed moon on the\r\n22d of October, 1790, there were visible, over the whole face of the\r\nsatellite, about a hundred and fifty very luminous red points. The\r\nauthor declares that he will observe the greatest reserve relative to\r\nthe similarity of all these points, their great brightness, and their\r\nremarkable colour.\r\n\r\nYet is not red the usual colour of the moon when eclipsed, and when it\r\nhas not entirely disappeared? Could the solar rays reaching our\r\nsatellite by the effect of refraction, and after an absorption\r\nexperienced in the lowest strata of the terrestrial atmosphere, receive\r\nanother tint? Are there not in the moon, when freely illuminated, and\r\nopposite to the sun, from one to two hundred little points, remarkable\r\nby the brightness of their light? Would it be possible for those little\r\npoints not to be also distinguishable in the moon, when it receives only\r\nthe portion of solar light which is refracted and coloured by our\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\nHerschel was more successful in his remarks on the absence of a lunar\r\natmosphere. During the solar eclipse of the 5th September, 1793, the\r\nillustrious astronomer particularly directed his attention to the shape\r\nof the acute horn resulting from the intersection of the limbs of the\r\nmoon and of the sun. He deduced from his observation that if towards the\r\npoint of the horn there had been a deviation of only one second,\r\noccasioned by the refraction of the solar light in the lunar atmosphere,\r\nit would not have escaped him.\r\n\r\nHerschel made the planets the object of numerous researches. Mercury was\r\nthe one with which he least occupied himself; he found its disk\r\nperfectly round on observing it during its projection, that is to say,\r\nin astronomical language, during its transit over the sun on the 9th of\r\nNovember, 1802. He sought to determine the time of the rotation of Venus\r\nsince the year 1777. He published two memoirs relative to Mars, the one\r\nin 1781, the other in 1784, and the discovery of its being flattened at\r\nthe poles we owe to him. After the discovery of the small planets,\r\nCeres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, by Piazzi, Olbers, and Harding, Herschel\r\napplied himself to measuring their angular diameter. He concluded from\r\nhis researches that those four new bodies did not deserve the name of\r\nplanets, and he proposed to call them asteroïds. This epithet was\r\nsubsequently adopted; though bitterly criticized by a historian of the\r\nRoyal Society of London, Dr. Thomson, who went so far as to suppose\r\nthat the learned astronomer \"had wished to deprive the first observers\r\nof those bodies, of all idea of rating themselves as high as him\r\n(Herschel) in the scale of astronomical discoverers.\" I should require\r\nnothing farther to annihilate such an imputation, than to put it by the\r\nside of the following passage, extracted from a memoir by this\r\ncelebrated astronomer, published in the _Philosophical Transactions_,\r\nfor the year 1805: \"The specific difference existing between planets and\r\nasteroïds appears now, by the addition of a third individual of the\r\nlatter species, to be more completely established, and that\r\ncircumstance, in my opinion, has added more to the _ornament_ of our\r\nsystem than the discovery of a new planet could have done.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough much has not resulted from Herschel's having occupied himself\r\nwith the physical constitution of Jupiter, astronomy is indebted to him\r\nfor several important results relative to the duration of that planet's\r\nrotation. He also made numerous observations on the intensities and\r\ncomparative magnitudes of its satellites.\r\n\r\nThe compression of Saturn, the duration of its rotation, the physical\r\nconstitution of this planet and that of its ring, were, on the part of\r\nHerschel, the object of numerous researches which have much contributed\r\nto the progress of planetary astronomy. But on this subject two\r\nimportant discoveries especially added new glory to the great\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nOf the five known satellites of Saturn at the close of the 17th century,\r\nHuygens had discovered the fourth; Cassini the others.\r\n\r\nThe subject seemed to be exhausted, when news from Slough showed what a\r\nmistake this was.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of August, 1789, the great forty-foot telescope revealed to\r\nHerschel a satellite still nearer to the ring than the other five\r\nalready observed. According to the principles of the nomenclature\r\npreviously adopted, the small body of the 28th August ought to have been\r\ncalled the first satellite of Saturn, the numbers indicating the places\r\nof the other five would then have been each increased by a unity. But\r\nthe fear of introducing confusion into science by these continual\r\nchanges of denomination, induced a preference for calling the new\r\nsatellite the sixth.\r\n\r\nThanks to the prodigious powers of the forty-foot telescope, a last\r\nsatellite, the seventh, showed itself on the 17th of September, 1789,\r\nbetween the sixth and the ring.\r\n\r\nThis seventh satellite is extremely faint. Herschel, however, succeeding\r\nin seeing it whenever circumstances were very favourable, even by the\r\naid of the twenty-foot telescope.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the planet Uranus, the detection of its satellites,\r\nwill always occupy one of the highest places among those by which modern\r\nastronomy is honoured.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1781, between ten and eleven o'clock at night,\r\nHerschel was examining the small stars near H Geminorum with a\r\nseven-foot telescope, bearing a magnifying power of 227 times. One of\r\nthese stars seemed to him to have an unusual diameter. The celebrated\r\nastronomer, therefore, thought it was a comet. It was under this\r\ndenomination that it was then discussed at the Royal Society of London.\r\nBut the researches of Herschel and of Laplace showed later that the\r\norbit of the new body was nearly circular, and Uranus was elevated to\r\nthe rank of a planet.\r\n\r\nThe immense distance of Uranus, its small angular diameter, the\r\nfeebleness of its light, did not allow the hope, that if that body had\r\nsatellites, the magnitudes of which were, relatively to its own size,\r\nwhat the satellites of Jupiter, of Saturn are, compared to those two\r\nlarge planets, any observer could perceive them, from the earth.\r\nHerschel was not a man to be deterred by such discouraging conjectures.\r\nTherefore, since powerful telescopes of the ordinary construction, that\r\nis to say, with two mirrors conjugated, had not enabled him to discover\r\nany thing, he substituted, in the beginning of January, 1787, _front\r\nview_ telescopes, that is, telescopes throwing much more light on the\r\nobjects, the small mirror being then suppressed, and with it one of the\r\ncauses of loss of light is got rid of.\r\n\r\nBy patient labour, by observations requiring a rare perseverance,\r\nHerschel attained (from the 11th of January, 1787, to the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1794,) to the discovery of the six satellites of his planet,\r\nand thus to complete the _world_ of a system that belongs entirely to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThere are several of Herschel's memoirs on comets. In analyzing them, we\r\nshall see that this great observer could not touch any thing without\r\nmaking further discoveries in the subject.\r\n\r\nHerschel applied some of his fine instruments to the study of the\r\nphysical constitution of a comet discovered by Mr. Pigott, on the 28th\r\nSeptember, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus was round and well determined. Some measures taken on the\r\nday when the nucleus subtended only an angle of a single second, gave as\r\nits real angle 6/100 of the diameter of the earth.\r\n\r\nHerschel saw no phase at an epoch when only 7/10 of the nucleus could\r\nbe illuminated by the sun. The nucleus then must shine by its own light.\r\n\r\nThis is a legitimate inference in the opinion of every one who will\r\nallow, on one hand, that the nucleus is a solid body, and on the other,\r\nthat it would have been possible to observe a phase of 8/10 on a disk\r\nwhose apparent total diameter did not exceed one or two seconds of a\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nVery small stars seemed to grow much paler when they were seen through\r\nthe coma or through the tail of the comet.\r\n\r\nThis faintness may have only been apparent, and might arise from the\r\ncircumstance of the stars being then projected on a luminous background.\r\nSuch is, indeed, the explanation adopted by Herschel. A gaseous medium,\r\ncapable of reflecting sufficient solar light to efface that of some\r\nstars, would appear to him to possess in each stratum a sensible\r\nquantity of matter, and to be, for that reason, a cause of real\r\ndiminution of the light transmitted, though nothing reveals the\r\nexistence of such a cause.\r\n\r\nThis argument, offered by Herschel in favour of the system which\r\ntransforms comets into self-luminous bodies, has not, as we may\r\nperceive, much force. I might venture to say as much of many other\r\nremarks by this great observer. He tells us that the comet was very\r\nvisible in the telescope on the 21st of February, 1808; now, on that\r\nday, its distance from the sun amounted to 2.7 times the mean radius of\r\nthe terrestrial orbit; its distance from the observer was 2.9: \"What\r\nprobability would there be that rays going to such distances, from the\r\nsun to the comet, could, after their reflection, be seen by an eye\r\nnearly three times more distant from the comet than from the sun?\"\r\n\r\nIt is only numerical determinations that could give value to such an\r\nargument. By satisfying himself with vague reasoning, Herschel did not\r\neven perceive that he was committing a great mistake by making the\r\ncomet's distance from the observer appear to be an element of\r\nvisibility. If the comet be self-luminous, its intrinsic splendour (its\r\nbrightness for unity of surface) will remain constant at any distance,\r\nas long as the subtended angle remains sensible. If the body shines by\r\nborrowed light, its brightness will vary only according to its change of\r\ndistance from the sun; nor will the distance of the observer occasion\r\nany change in the visibility; always, let it be understood, with the\r\nrestriction that the apparent diameter shall not be diminished below\r\ncertain limits.\r\n\r\nHerschel finished his observations of a comet that was visible in\r\nJanuary, 1807, with the following remark:--\r\n\r\n\"Of the sixteen telescopic comets that I have examined, fourteen had no\r\nsolid body visible at their centre; the other two exhibited a central\r\nlight, very ill defined, that might be termed a nucleus, but a light\r\nthat certainly could not deserve the name of a disk.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful comet of 1811 became the object of that celebrated\r\nastronomer's conscientious labour. Large telescopes showed him, in the\r\nmidst of the gazeous head, a rather reddish body of planetary\r\nappearance, which bore strong magnifying powers, and showed no sign of\r\nphase. Hence Herschel concluded that it was self-luminous. Yet if we\r\nreflect that the planetary body under consideration was not a second in\r\ndiameter, the absence of a phase does not appear a demonstrative\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nThe light of the head had a blueish-green tint. Was this a real tint, or\r\ndid the central reddish body, only through contrast, make the\r\nsurrounding vapour appear to be coloured? Herschel did not examine the\r\nquestion in this point of view.\r\n\r\nThe head of the comet appeared to be enveloped at a certain distance, on\r\nthe side towards the sun, by a brilliant narrow zone, embracing about a\r\nsemicircle, and of a yellowish colour. From the two extremities of the\r\nsemicircle there arose, towards the region away from the sun, two long\r\nluminous streaks which limited the tail. Between the brilliant circular\r\nsemi-ring and the head, the cometary substance seemed dark, very rare,\r\nand very diaphanous.\r\n\r\nThe luminous semi-ring always presented similar appearances in all the\r\npositions of the comet; it was not then possible to attribute to it\r\nreally the annular form, the shape of Saturn's ring, for example.\r\nHerschel sought whether a spherical demi-envelop of luminous matter, and\r\nyet diaphanous, would not lead to a natural explanation of the\r\nphenomenon. In this hypothesis, the visual rays, which on the 6th of\r\nOctober, 1811, made a section of the envelop, or bore almost\r\ntangentially, traversed a thickness of matter of about 399,000\r\nkilometres, (248,000 English miles,) whilst the visual rays near the\r\nhead of the comet did not meet above 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of\r\nit. As the brightness must be proportional to the quantity of matter\r\ntraversed, there could not fail to be an appearance around the comet, of\r\na semi-ring five times more luminous than the central regions. This\r\nsemi-ring, then, was an effect of projection, and it has revealed a\r\ncircumstance to us truly remarkable in the physical constitution of\r\ncomets.\r\n\r\nThe two luminous streaks that outlined the tail at its two limits, may\r\nbe explained in a similar manner; the tail was not flat as it appeared\r\nto be; it had the form of a conoid, with its sides of a certain\r\nthickness. The visual lines which traversed those sides almost\r\ntangentially, evidently met much more matter than the visual lines\r\npassing across. This maximum of matter could not fail of being\r\nrepresented by a maximum of light.\r\n\r\nThe luminous semi-ring floated; it appeared one day to be suspended in\r\nthe diaphanous atmosphere by which the head of the comet was surrounded,\r\nat a distance of 518,000 kilometres (322,000 English miles) from the\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\nThis distance was not constant. The matter of the semi-annular envelop\r\nseemed even to be precipitated by slow degrees through the diaphanous\r\natmosphere; finally it reached the nucleus; the earlier appearances\r\nvanished; the comet was reduced to a globular nebula.\r\n\r\nDuring its period of dissolution, the ring appeared sometimes to have\r\nseveral branches.\r\n\r\nThe luminous shreds of the tail seemed to undergo rapid, frequent, and\r\nconsiderable variations of length. Herschel discerned symptoms of a\r\nmovement of rotation both in the comet and in its tail. This rotatory\r\nmotion carried unequal shreds from the centre towards the border, and\r\nreciprocally. On looking from time to time at the same region of the\r\ntail, at the border, for example, sensible changes of length must have\r\nbeen perceptible, which however had no reality in them. Herschel\r\nthought, as I have already said, that the beautiful comet of 1811, and\r\nthat of 1807, were self-luminous. The second comet of 1811 appeared to\r\nhim to shine only by borrowed light. It must be acknowledged that these\r\nconjectures did not rest on any thing demonstrative.\r\n\r\nIn attentively comparing the comet of 1807 with the beautiful comet of\r\n1811, relative to the changes of distance from the sun, and the\r\nmodifications resulting thence, Herschel put it beyond doubt that these\r\nmodifications have something individual in them, something relative to a\r\nspecial state of the nebulous matter. On one celestial body the changes\r\nof distance produce an enormous effect, on another the modifications are\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL LABOURS.\r\n\r\nI shall say very little on the discoveries that Herschel made in\r\nphysics. In short, everybody knows them. They have been inserted into\r\nspecial treatises, into elementary works, into verbal instruction; they\r\nmust be considered as the starting-point of a multitude of important\r\nlabours with which the sciences have been enriched during several years.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these is that of the dark radiating heat which is found\r\nmixed with light.\r\n\r\nIn studying the phenomena, no longer with the eye, like Newton, but with\r\na thermometer, Herschel discovered that the solar spectrum is prolonged\r\non the red side far beyond the visible limits. The thermometer sometimes\r\nrose higher in that dark region, than in the midst of brilliant zones.\r\nThe light of the sun then, contains, besides the coloured rays so well\r\ncharacterized by Newton, some invisible rays, still less refrangible\r\nthan the red, and whose warming power is very considerable. A world of\r\ndiscoveries has arisen from this fundamental fact.\r\n\r\nThe dark heat emanating from terrestrial objects more or less heated,\r\nbecame also subjects of Herschel's investigations. His work contained\r\nthe germs of a good number of beautiful experiments since erected upon\r\nit in our own day.\r\n\r\nBy successively placing the same objects in all parts of the solar\r\nspectrum Herschel determined the illuminating powers of the various\r\nprismatic rays. The general result of these experiments may be thus\r\nenunciated:\r\n\r\nThe illuminating power of the red rays is not very great; that of the\r\norange rays surpasses it, and is in its turn surpassed by the power of\r\nthe yellow rays. The maximum power of illumination is found between the\r\nbrightest yellow and the palest green. The yellow and the green possess\r\nthis power equally. A like assimilation may be laid down between the\r\nblue and the red. Finally, the power of illumination in the indigo rays,\r\nand above all in the violet, is very weak.\r\n\r\nYet the memoirs of Herschel on Newton's coloured rings, though\r\ncontaining a multitude of exact experiments, have not much contributed\r\nto advance the theory of those curious phenomena. I have learnt from\r\ngood authority, that the great astronomer held the same opinion on this\r\ntopic. He said that it was the only occasion on which he had reason to\r\nregret having, according to his constant method, published his labours\r\nimmediately, as fast as they were performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been appointed to draw up the report of a committee of the\r\nChamber of Deputies which was nominated in 1842, for the purpose of\r\ntaking into consideration the expediency of a proposal submitted to the\r\nChamber by the Minister of Public Instruction, relative to the\r\npublication of a new edition of the works of Laplace at the public\r\nexpense, I deemed it to be my duty to embody in the report a concise\r\nanalysis of the works of our illustrious countryman. Several persons,\r\ninfluenced, perhaps, by too indulgent a feeling towards me, having\r\nexpressed a wish that this analysis should not remain buried amid a heap\r\nof legislative documents, but that it should be published in the\r\n_Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes_, I took advantage of this\r\ncircumstance to develop it more fully so as to render it less unworthy\r\nof public attention. The scientific part of the report presented to the\r\nChamber of Deputies will be found here entire. It has been considered\r\ndesirable to suppress the remainder. I shall merely retain a few\r\nsentences containing an explanation of the object of the proposed law,\r\nand an announcement of the resolutions which were adopted by the three\r\npowers of the State.\r\n\r\n\"Laplace has endowed France, Europe, the scientific world, with three\r\nmagnificent compositions: the _Traité de Mécanique Céleste_, the\r\n_Exposition du Système du Monde_, and the _Théorie Analytique des\r\nProbabilités_. In the present day (1842) there is no longer to be found\r\na single copy of this last work at any bookseller's establishment in\r\nParis. The edition of the _Mécanique Céleste_ itself will soon be\r\nexhausted. It was painful then to reflect that the time was close at\r\nhand when persons engaged in the study of the higher mathematics would\r\nbe compelled, for want of the original work, to inquire at Philadelphia,\r\nat New York, or at Boston for the English translation of the _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of our countryman by the excellent geometer Bowditch. These\r\nfears, let us hasten to state, were not well founded. To republish the\r\n_Mécanique Céleste_ was, on the part of the family of the illustrious\r\ngeometer, to perform a pious duty. Accordingly, Madame de Laplace, who\r\nis so justly, so profoundly attentive to every circumstance calculated\r\nto enhance the renown of the name which she bears, did not hesitate\r\nabout pecuniary considerations. A small property near Pont l'Evêque was\r\nabout to change hands, and the proceeds were to have been applied so\r\nthat Frenchmen should not be deprived of the satisfaction of exploring\r\nthe treasures of the _Mécanique Céleste_ through the medium of the\r\nvernacular tongue.\r\n\r\n\"The republication of the complete works of Laplace rested upon an\r\nequally sure guarantee. Yielding at once to filial affection, to a noble\r\nfeeling of patriotism, and to the enthusiasm for brilliant discoveries\r\nwhich a course of severe study inspired, General Laplace had long since\r\nqualified himself for becoming the editor of the seven volumes which are\r\ndestined to immortalize his father.\r\n\r\n\"There are glorious achievements of a character too elevated, of a\r\nlustre too splendid, that they should continue to exist as objects of\r\nprivate property. Upon the State devolves the duty of preserving them\r\nfrom indifference and oblivion: of continually holding them up to\r\nattention, of diffusing a knowledge of them through a thousand channels;\r\nin a word, of rendering them subservient to the public interests.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless the Minister of Public Instruction was influenced by these\r\nconsiderations, when upon the occasion of a new edition of the works of\r\nLaplace having become necessary, he demanded of you to substitute the\r\ngreat French family for the personal family of the illustrious geometer.\r\nWe give our full and unreserved adhesion to this proposition. It springs\r\nfrom a feeling of patriotism which will not be gainsayed by any one in\r\nthis assembly.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Chamber of Deputies had only to examine and solve this\r\nsingle question: \"Are the works of Laplace of such transcendent, such\r\nexceptional merit, that their republication ought to form the subject of\r\ndeliberation of the great powers of the State?\" An opinion prevailed,\r\nthat it was not enough merely to appeal to public notoriety, but that it\r\nwas necessary to give an exact analysis of the brilliant discoveries of\r\nLaplace in order to exhibit more fully the importance of the resolution\r\nabout to be adopted. Who could hereafter propose on any similar occasion\r\nthat the Chamber should declare itself without discussion, when a desire\r\nwas felt, previous to voting in favour of a resolution so honourable to\r\nthe memory of a great man, to fathom, to measure, to examine minutely\r\nand from every point of view monuments such as the _Mécanique Céleste_\r\nand the _Exposition du Système du Monde_? It has appeared to me that the\r\nreport drawn up in the name of a committee of one of the three great\r\npowers of the State might worthily close this series of biographical\r\nnotices of eminent astronomers.[22]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Laplace, peer of France, one of the forty of the French\r\nAcademy, member of the Academy of Sciences and of the _Bureau des\r\nLongitudes_, an associate of all the great Academies or Scientific\r\nSocieties of Europe, was born at Beaumont-en-Auge of parents belonging\r\nto the class of small farmers, on the 28th of March, 1749; he died on\r\nthe 5th of March, 1827.\r\n\r\nThe first and second volumes of the _Mécanique Céleste_ were published\r\nin 1799; the third volume appeared in 1802, the fourth volume in 1805;\r\nas regards the fifth volume, Books XI. and XII. were published in 1823,\r\nBooks XIII. XIV. and XV. in 1824, and Book XVI. in 1825. The _Théorie\r\ndes Probabilités_ was published in 1812. We shall now present the reader\r\nwith the history of the principal astronomical discoveries contained hi\r\nthese immortal works.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is the science of which the human mind may most justly boast.\r\nIt owes this indisputable preëminence to the elevated nature of its\r\nobject, to the grandeur of its means of investigation, to the certainty,\r\nthe utility, and the unparalleled magnificence of its results.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of the social existence of mankind, the study\r\nof the movements of the heavenly bodies has attracted the attention of\r\ngovernments and peoples. To several great captains, illustrious\r\nstatesmen, philosophers, and eminent orators of Greece and Rome it\r\nformed a subject of delight. Yet, let us be permitted to state,\r\nastronomy truly worthy of the name is quite a modern science. It dates\r\nonly from the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThree great, three brilliant phases, have marked its progress.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 Copernicus overthrew with a firm and bold hand, the greater part\r\nof the antique and venerable scaffolding with which the illusions of the\r\nsenses and the pride of successive generations had filled the universe.\r\nThe earth ceased to be the centre, the pivot of the celestial movements;\r\nit henceforward modestly ranged itself among the planets; its material\r\nimportance, amid the totality of the bodies of which our solar system is\r\ncomposed, found itself reduced almost to that of a grain of sand.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight years had elapsed from the day when the Canon of Thorn\r\nexpired while holding in his faltering hands the first copy of the work\r\nwhich was to diffuse so bright and pure a flood of glory upon Poland,\r\nwhen Würtemberg witnessed the birth of a man who was destined to achieve\r\na revolution in science not less fertile in consequences, and still more\r\ndifficult of execution. This man was Kepler. Endowed with two qualities\r\nwhich seemed incompatible with each other, a volcanic imagination, and a\r\npertinacity of intellect which the most tedious numerical calculations\r\ncould not daunt, Kepler conjectured that the movements of the celestial\r\nbodies must be connected together by simple laws, or, to use his own\r\nexpressions, by _harmonic_ laws. These laws he undertook to discover. A\r\nthousand fruitless attempts, errors of calculation inseparable from a\r\ncolossal undertaking, did not prevent him a single instant from\r\nadvancing resolutely towards the goal of which he imagined he had\r\nobtained a glimpse. Twenty-two years were employed by him in this\r\ninvestigation, and still he was not weary of it! What, in reality, are\r\ntwenty-two years of labour to him who is about to become the legislator\r\nof worlds; who shall inscribe his name in ineffaceable characters upon\r\nthe frontispiece of an immortal code; who shall be able to exclaim in\r\ndithyrambic language, and without incurring the reproach of any one,\r\n\"The die is cast; I have written my book; it will be read either in the\r\npresent age or by posterity, it matters not which; it may well await a\r\nreader, since God has waited six thousand years for an interpreter of\r\nhis works?\"[23]\r\n\r\nTo investigate a physical cause capable of making the planets revolve in\r\nclosed curves; to place the principle of the stability of the universe\r\nin mechanical forces and not in solid supports such as the spheres of\r\ncrystal which our ancestors had dreamed of; to extend to the revolutions\r\nof the heavenly bodies the general principles of the mechanics of\r\nterrestrial bodies,--such were the questions which remained to be solved\r\nafter Kepler had announced his discoveries to the world.\r\n\r\nVery distinct traces of these great problems are perceived here and\r\nthere among the ancients as well as the moderns, from Lucretius and\r\nPlutarch down to Kepler, Bouillaud, and Borelli. It is to Newton,\r\nhowever, that we must award the merit of their solution. This great man,\r\nlike several of his predecessors, conceived the celestial bodies to have\r\na tendency to approach towards each other in virtue of an attractive\r\nforce, deduced the mathematical characteristics of this force from the\r\nlaws of Kepler, extended it to all the material molecules of the solar\r\nsystem, and developed his brilliant discovery in a work which, even in\r\nthe present day, is regarded as the most eminent production of the human\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nThe heart aches when, upon studying the history of the sciences, we\r\nperceive so magnificent an intellectual movement effected without the\r\ncoöperation of France. Practical astronomy increased our inferiority.\r\nThe means of investigation were at first inconsiderately entrusted to\r\nforeigners, to the prejudice of Frenchmen abounding in intelligence and\r\nzeal. Subsequently, intellects of a superior order struggled with\r\ncourage, but in vain, against the unskilfulness of our artists. During\r\nthis period, Bradley, more fortunate on the other side of the Channel,\r\nimmortalized himself by the discovery of aberration and nutation.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of France to these admirable revolutions in\r\nastronomical science, consisted, in 1740, of the experimental\r\ndetermination of the spheroidal figure of the earth, and of the\r\ndiscovery of the variation of gravity upon the surface of our planet.\r\nThese were two great results; our country, however, had a right to\r\ndemand more: when France is not in the first rank she has lost her\r\nplace.[24]\r\n\r\nThis rank, which was lost for a moment, was brilliantly regained, an\r\nachievement for which we are indebted to four geometers.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton, giving to his discoveries a generality which the laws of\r\nKepler did not imply, imagined that the different planets were not only\r\nattracted by the sun, but that they also attract each other, he\r\nintroduced into the heavens a cause of universal disturbance.\r\nAstronomers could then see at the first glance that in no part of the\r\nuniverse whether near or distant would the Keplerian laws suffice for\r\nthe exact representation of the phenomena; that the simple, regular\r\nmovements with which the imaginations of the ancients were pleased to\r\nendue the heavenly bodies would experience numerous, considerable,\r\nperpetually changing perturbations.\r\n\r\nTo discover several of these perturbations, to assign their nature, and\r\nin a few rare cases their numerical values, such was the object which\r\nNewton proposed to himself in writing the _Principia Mathematica\r\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the incomparable sagacity of its author the Principia\r\ncontained merely a rough outline of the planetary perturbations. If this\r\nsublime sketch did not become a complete portrait we must not attribute\r\nthe circumstance to any want of ardour or perseverance; the efforts of\r\nthe great philosopher were always superhuman, the questions which he did\r\nnot solve were incapable of solution in his time. When the\r\nmathematicians of the continent entered upon the same career, when they\r\nwished to establish the Newtonian system upon an incontrovertible basis,\r\nand to improve the tables of astronomy, they actually found in their way\r\ndifficulties which the genius of Newton had failed to surmount.\r\n\r\nFive geometers, Clairaut, Euler, D'Alembert, Lagrange, and Laplace,\r\nshared between them the world of which Newton had disclosed the\r\nexistence. They explored it in all directions, penetrated into regions\r\nwhich had been supposed inaccessible, pointed out there a multitude of\r\nphenomena which observation had not yet detected; finally, and it is\r\nthis which constitutes their imperishable glory, they reduced under the\r\ndomain of a single principle, a single law, every thing that was most\r\nrefined and mysterious in the celestial movements. Geometry had thus the\r\nboldness to dispose of the future; the evolutions of ages are\r\nscrupulously ratifying the decisions of science.\r\n\r\nWe shall not occupy our attention with the magnificent labours of Euler,\r\nwe shall, on the contrary, present the reader with a rapid analysis of\r\nthe discoveries of his four rivals, our countrymen.[25]\r\n\r\nIf a celestial body, the moon, for example, gravitated solely towards\r\nthe centre of the earth, it would describe a mathematical ellipse; it\r\nwould strictly obey the laws of Kepler, or, which is the same thing, the\r\nprinciples of mechanics expounded by Newton in the first sections of his\r\nimmortal work.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the action of a second force. Let us take into\r\naccount the attraction which the sun exercises upon the moon, in other\r\nwords, instead of two bodies, let us suppose three to operate on each\r\nother, the Keplerian ellipse will now furnish merely a rough indication\r\nof the motion of our satellite. In some parts the attraction of the sun\r\nwill tend to enlarge the orbit, and will in reality do so; in other\r\nparts the effect will be the reverse of this. In a word, by the\r\nintroduction of a third attractive body, the greatest complication will\r\nsucceed to a simple regular movement upon which the mind reposed with\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\nIf Newton gave a complete solution of the question of the celestial\r\nmovements in the case wherein two bodies attract each other, he did not\r\neven attempt an analytical investigation of the infinitely more\r\ndifficult problem of three bodies. The problem of three bodies (this is\r\nthe name by which it has become celebrated), the problem for determining\r\nthe movement of a body subjected to the attractive influence of two\r\nother bodies, was solved for the first time, by our countryman\r\nClairaut.[26] From this solution we may date the important improvements\r\nof the lunar tables effected in the last century.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful astronomical discovery of antiquity, is that of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. Hipparchus, to whom the honour of it is\r\ndue, gave a complete and precise statement of all the consequences which\r\nflow from this movement. Two of these have more especially attracted\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the precession of the equinoxes, it is not always the same\r\ngroups of stars, the same constellations, which are perceived in the\r\nheavens at the same season of the year. In the lapse of ages the\r\nconstellations of winter will become those of summer and reciprocally.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the precession of the equinoxes, the pole does not always\r\noccupy the same place in the starry vault. The moderately bright star\r\nwhich is very justly named in the present day, the pole star, was far\r\nremoved from the pole in the time of Hipparchus; in the course of a few\r\ncenturies it will again appear removed from it. The designation of pole\r\nstar has been, and will be, applied to stars very distant from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquirer in attempting to explain natural phenomena has the\r\nmisfortune to enter upon a wrong path, each precise observation throws\r\nhim into new complications. Seven spheres of crystal did not suffice for\r\nrepresenting the phenomena as soon as the illustrious astronomer of\r\nRhodes discovered precession. An eighth sphere was then wanted to\r\naccount for a movement in which all the stars participated at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCopernicus having deprived the earth of its alleged immobility, gave a\r\nvery simple explanation of the most minute circumstances of precession.\r\nHe supposed that the axis of rotation does not remain exactly parallel\r\nto itself; that in the course of each complete revolution of the earth\r\naround the sun, the axis deviates from its position by a small quantity;\r\nin a word, instead of supposing the circumpolar stars to advance in a\r\ncertain way towards the pole, he makes the pole advance towards the\r\nstars. This hypothesis divested the mechanism of the universe of the\r\ngreatest complication which the love of theorizing had introduced into\r\nit. A new Alphonse would have then wanted a pretext to address to his\r\nastronomical synod the profound remark, so erroneously interpreted,\r\nwhich history ascribes to the king of Castile.\r\n\r\nIf the conception of Copernicus improved by Kepler had, as we have just\r\nseen, introduced a striking improvement into the mechanism of the\r\nheavens, it still remained to discover the motive force which, by\r\naltering the position of the terrestrial axis during each successive\r\nyear, would cause it to describe an entire circle of nearly 50° in\r\ndiameter, in a period of about 26,000 years.\r\n\r\nNewton conjectured that this force arose from the action of the sun and\r\nmoon upon the redundant matter accumulated in the equatorial regions of\r\nthe earth: thus he made the precession of the equinoxes depend upon the\r\nspheroidal figure of the earth; he declared that upon a round planet no\r\nprecession would exist.\r\n\r\nAll this was quite true, but Newton did not succeed in establishing it\r\nby a mathematical process. Now this great man had introduced into\r\nphilosophy the severe and just rule: Consider as certain only what has\r\nbeen demonstrated. The demonstration of the Newtonian conception of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes was, then, a great discovery, and it is to\r\nD'Alembert that the glory of it is due.[27] The illustrious geometer\r\ngave a complete explanation of the general movement, in virtue of which\r\nthe terrestrial axis returns to the same stars in a period of about\r\n26,000 years. He also connected with the theory of gravitation the\r\nperturbation of precession discovered by Bradley, that remarkable\r\noscillation which the earth's axis experiences continually during its\r\nmovement of progression, and the period of which, amounting to about\r\neighteen years, is exactly equal to the time which the intersection of\r\nthe moon's orbit with the ecliptic employs in describing the 360° of the\r\nentire circumference.\r\n\r\nGeometers and astronomers are justly occupied as much with the figure\r\nand physical constitution which the earth might have had in remote ages\r\nas with its present figure and constitution.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our countryman Richer discovered that a body, whatever be its\r\nnature, weighs less when it is transported nearer the equatorial\r\nregions, everybody perceived that the earth, if it was originally\r\nfluid, ought to bulge out at the equator. Huyghens and Newton did more;\r\nthey calculated the difference between the greatest and least axes, the\r\nexcess of the equatorial diameter over the line of the poles.[28]\r\n\r\nThe calculation of Huyghens was founded upon hypothetic properties of\r\nthe attractive force which were wholly inadmissible; that of Newton upon\r\na theorem which he ought to have demonstrated; the theory of the latter\r\nwas characterized by a defect of a still more serious nature: it\r\nsupposed the density of the earth during the original state of fluidity,\r\nto be homogeneous.[29] When in attempting the solution of great problems\r\nwe have recourse to such simplifications; when, in order to elude\r\ndifficulties of calculation, we depart so widely from natural and\r\nphysical conditions, the results relate to an ideal world, they are in\r\nreality nothing more than flights of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply mathematical analysis usefully to the determination of\r\nthe figure of the earth it was necessary to abandon all idea of\r\nhomogeneity, all constrained resemblance between the forms of the\r\nsuperposed and unequally dense strata; it was necessary also to examine\r\nthe case of a central solid nucleus. This generality increased tenfold\r\nthe difficulties of the problem; neither Clairaut nor D'Alembert was,\r\nhowever, arrested by them. Thanks to the efforts of these two eminent\r\ngeometers, thanks to some essential developments due to their immediate\r\nsuccessors, and especially to the illustrious Legendre, the theoretical\r\ndetermination of the figure of the earth has attained all desirable\r\nperfection. There now reigns the most satisfactory accordance between\r\nthe results of calculation and those of direct measurement. The earth,\r\nthen, was originally fluid: analysis has enabled us to ascend to the\r\nearliest ages of our planet.[30]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Alexander comets were supposed by the majority of the\r\nGreek philosophers to be merely meteors generated in our atmosphere.\r\nDuring the middle ages, persons, without giving themselves much concern\r\nabout the nature of those bodies, supposed them to prognosticate\r\nsinister events. Regiomontanus and Tycho Brahé proved by their\r\nobservations that they are situate beyond the moon; Hevelius, Dörfel,\r\n&c., made them revolve around the sun; Newton established that they move\r\nunder the immediate influence of the attractive force of that body, that\r\nthey do not describe right lines, that, in fact, they obey the laws of\r\nKepler. It was necessary, then, to prove that the orbits of comets are\r\ncurves which return into themselves, or that the same comet has been\r\nseen on several distinct occasions. This discovery was reserved for\r\nHalley. By a minute investigation of the circumstances connected with\r\nthe apparitions of all the comets to be met with in the records of\r\nhistory, in ancient chronicles, and in astronomical annals, this eminent\r\nphilosopher was enabled to prove that the comets of 1682, of 1607, and\r\nof 1531, were in reality so many successive apparitions of one and the\r\nsame body.\r\n\r\nThis identity involved a conclusion before which more than one\r\nastronomer shrunk. It was necessary to admit that the time of a complete\r\nrevolution of the comet was subject to a great variation, amounting to\r\nas much as two years in seventy-six.\r\n\r\nWere such great discordances due to the disturbing action of the\r\nplanets?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question would introduce comets into the category of\r\nordinary planets or would exclude them for ever. The calculation was\r\ndifficult: Clairaut discovered the means of effecting it. While success\r\nwas still uncertain, the illustrious geometer gave proof of the greatest\r\nboldness, for in the course of the year 1758 he undertook to determine\r\nthe time of the following year when the comet of 1682 would reappear. He\r\ndesignated the constellations, nay the stars, which it would encounter\r\nin its progress.\r\n\r\nThis was not one of those remote predictions which astrologers and\r\nothers formerly combined very skilfully with the tables of mortality, so\r\nthat they might not be falsified during their lifetime: the event was\r\nclose at hand. The question at issue was nothing less than the creation\r\nof a new era in cometary astronomy, or the casting of a reproach upon\r\nscience, the consequences of which it would long continue to feel.\r\n\r\nClairaut found by a long process of calculation, conducted with great\r\nskill, that the action of Jupiter and Saturn ought to have retarded the\r\nmovement of the comet; that the time of revolution compared with that\r\nimmediately preceding, would be increased 518 days by the disturbing\r\naction of Jupiter, and 100 days by the action of Saturn, forming a\r\ntotal of 618 days, or more than a year and eight months.\r\n\r\nNever did a question of astronomy excite a more intense, a more\r\nlegitimate curiosity. All classes of society awaited with equal interest\r\nthe announced apparition. A Saxon peasant, Palitzch, first perceived the\r\ncomet. Henceforward, from one extremity of Europe to the other, a\r\nthousand telescopes traced each night the path of the body through the\r\nconstellations. The route was always, within the limits of precision of\r\nthe calculations, that which Clairaut had indicated beforehand. The\r\nprediction of the illustrious geometer was verified in regard both to\r\ntime and space: astronomy had just achieved a great and important\r\ntriumph, and, as usual, had destroyed at one blow a disgraceful and\r\ninveterate prejudice. As soon as it was established that the returns of\r\ncomets might be calculated beforehand, those bodies lost for ever their\r\nancient prestige. The most timid minds troubled themselves quite as\r\nlittle about them as about eclipses of the sun and moon, which are\r\nequally subject to calculation. In fine, the labours of Clairaut had\r\nproduced a deeper impression on the public mind than the learned,\r\ningenious, and acute reasoning of Bayle.\r\n\r\nThe heavens offer to reflecting minds nothing more curious or more\r\nstrange than the equality which subsists between the movements of\r\nrotation and revolution of our satellite. By reason of this perfect\r\nequality the moon always presents the same side to the earth. The\r\nhemisphere which we see in the present day is precisely that which our\r\nancestors saw in the most remote ages; it is exactly the hemisphere\r\nwhich future generations will perceive.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of final causes which certain philosophers have so\r\nabundantly made use of in endeavouring to account for a great number of\r\nnatural phenomena was in this particular case totally inapplicable. In\r\nfact, how could it be pretended that mankind could have any interest in\r\nperceiving incessantly the same hemisphere of the moon, in never\r\nobtaining a glimpse of the opposite hemisphere? On the other hand, the\r\nexistence of a perfect, mathematical equality between elements having no\r\nnecessary connection--such as the movements of translation and rotation\r\nof a given celestial body--was not less repugnant to all ideas of\r\nprobability. There were besides two other numerical coincidences quite\r\nas extraordinary; an identity of direction, relative to the stars, of\r\nthe equator and orbit of the moon; exactly the same precessional\r\nmovements of these two planes. This group of singular phenomena,\r\ndiscovered by J.D. Cassini, constituted the mathematical code of what is\r\ncalled the _Libration of the Moon_.\r\n\r\nThe libration of the moon formed a very imperfect part of physical\r\nastronomy when Lagrange made it depend on a circumstance connected with\r\nthe figure of our satellite which was not observable from the earth, and\r\nthereby connected it completely with the principles of universal\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the moon was converted into a solid body, the action of\r\nthe earth compelled it to assume a less regular figure than if no\r\nattracting body had been situate in its vicinity. The action of our\r\nglobe rendered elliptical an equator which otherwise would have been\r\ncircular. This disturbing action did not prevent the lunar equator from\r\nbulging out in every direction, but the prominence of the equatorial\r\ndiameter directed towards the earth became four times greater than that\r\nof the diameter which we see perpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe moon would appear then, to an observer situate in space and\r\nexamining it transversely, to be elongated towards the earth, to be a\r\nsort of pendulum without a point of suspension. When a pendulum deviates\r\nfrom the vertical, the action of gravity brings it back; when the\r\nprincipal axis of the moon recedes from its usual direction, the earth\r\nin like manner compels it to return.\r\n\r\nWe have here, then, a complete explanation of a singular phenomenon,\r\nwithout the necessity of having recourse to the existence of an almost\r\nmiraculous equality between two movements of translation and rotation,\r\nentirely independent of each other. Mankind will never see but one face\r\nof the moon. Observation had informed us of this fact; now we know\r\nfurther that this is due to a physical cause which may be calculated,\r\nand which is visible only to the mind's eye,--that it is attributable to\r\nthe elongation which the diameter of the moon experienced when it passed\r\nfrom the liquid to the solid state under the attractive influence of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIf there had existed originally a slight difference between the\r\nmovements of rotation and revolution of the moon, the attraction of the\r\nearth would have reduced these movements to a rigorous equality. This\r\nattraction would have even sufficed to cause the disappearance of a\r\nslight want of coincidence in the intersections of the equator and orbit\r\nof the moon with the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe memoir in which Lagrange has so successfully connected the laws of\r\nlibration with the principles of gravitation, is no less remarkable for\r\nintrinsic excellence than style of execution. After having perused this\r\nproduction, the reader will have no difficulty in admitting that the\r\nword _elegance_ may be appropriately applied to mathematical researches.\r\n\r\nIn this analysis we have merely glanced at the astronomical discoveries\r\nof Clairaut, D'Alembert, and Lagrange. We shall be somewhat less concise\r\nin noticing the labours of Laplace.\r\n\r\nAfter having enumerated the various forces which must result from the\r\nmutual action of the planets and satellites of our system, even the\r\ngreat Newton did not venture to investigate the general nature of the\r\neffects produced by them. In the midst of the labyrinth formed by\r\nincreases and diminutions of velocity, variations in the forms of the\r\norbits, changes of distances and inclinations, which these forces must\r\nevidently produce, the most learned geometer would fail to discover a\r\ntrustworthy guide. This extreme complication gave birth to a\r\ndiscouraging reflection. Forces so numerous, so variable in position, so\r\ndifferent in intensity, seemed to be incapable of maintaining a\r\ncondition of equilibrium except by a sort of miracle. Newton even went\r\nso far as to suppose that the planetary system did not contain within\r\nitself the elements of indefinite stability; he was of opinion that a\r\npowerful hand must intervene from time to time, to repair the\r\nderangements occasioned by the mutual action of the various bodies.\r\nEuler, although farther advanced than Newton in a knowledge of the\r\nplanetary pertubations, refused also to admit that the solar system was\r\nconstituted so as to endure for ever.\r\n\r\nNever did a greater philosophical question offer itself to the inquiries\r\nof mankind. Laplace attacked it with boldness, perseverance, and\r\nsuccess. The profound and long-continued researches of the illustrious\r\ngeometer established with complete evidence that the planetary ellipses\r\nare perpetually variable; that the extremities of their major axes make\r\nthe tour of the heavens; that, independently of an oscillatory motion,\r\nthe planes of their orbits experienced a displacement in virtue of which\r\ntheir intersections with the plane of the terrestrial orbit are each\r\nyear directed towards different stars. In the midst of this apparent\r\nchaos there is one element which remains constant or is merely subject\r\nto small periodic changes; namely, the major axis of each orbit, and\r\nconsequently the time of revolution of each planet. This is the element\r\nwhich ought to have chiefly varied, according to the learned\r\nspeculations of Newton and Euler.\r\n\r\nThe principle of universal gravitation suffices for preserving the\r\nstability of the solar system. It maintains the forms and inclinations\r\nof the orbits in a mean condition which is subject to slight\r\noscillations; variety does not entail disorder; the universe offers the\r\nexample of harmonious relations, of a state of perfection which Newton\r\nhimself doubted. This depends on circumstances which calculation\r\ndisclosed to Laplace, and which, upon a superficial view of the subject,\r\nwould not seem to be capable of exercising so great an influence.\r\nInstead of planets revolving all in the same direction in slightly\r\neccentric orbits, and in planes inclined at small angles towards each\r\nother, substitute different conditions and the stability of the universe\r\nwill again be put in jeopardy, and according to all probability there\r\nwill result a frightful chaos.[31]\r\n\r\nAlthough the invariability of the mean distances of the planetary\r\norbits has been more completely demonstrated since the appearance of the\r\nmemoir above referred to, that is to say by pushing the analytical\r\napproximations to a greater extent, it will, notwithstanding, always\r\nconstitute one of the admirable discoveries of the author of the\r\n_Mécanique Céleste_. Dates, in the case of such subjects, are no luxury\r\nof erudition. The memoir in which Laplace communicated his results on\r\nthe invariability of the mean motions or mean distances, is dated\r\n1773.[32] It was in 1784 only, that he established the stability of the\r\nother elements of the system from the smallness of the planetary masses,\r\nthe inconsiderable eccentricity of the orbits, and the revolution of the\r\nplanets in one common direction around the sun.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of which I have just given an account to the reader\r\nexcluded at least from the solar system the idea of the Newtonian\r\nattraction being a cause of disorder. But might not other forces, by\r\ncombining with attraction, produce gradually increasing perturbations as\r\nNewton and Euler dreaded? Facts of a positive nature seemed to justify\r\nthese fears.\r\n\r\nA comparison of ancient with modern observations revealed the existence\r\nof a continual acceleration of the mean motions of the moon and the\r\nplanet Jupiter, and an equally striking diminution of the mean motion\r\nof Saturn. These variations led to conclusions of the most singular\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the presumed cause of these perturbations, to say\r\nthat the velocity of a body increased from century to century was\r\nequivalent to asserting that the body continually approached the centre\r\nof motion; on the other hand, when the velocity diminished, the body\r\nmust be receding from the centre.\r\n\r\nThus, by a strange arrangement of nature, our planetary system seemed\r\ndestined to lose Saturn, its most mysterious ornament,--to see the\r\nplanet accompanied by its ring and seven satellites, plunge gradually\r\ninto unknown regions, whither the eye armed with the most powerful\r\ntelescopes has never penetrated. Jupiter, on the other hand, the planet\r\ncompared with which the earth is so insignificant, appeared to be moving\r\nin the opposite direction, so as to be ultimately absorbed in the\r\nincandescent matter of the sun. Finally, the moon seemed as if it would\r\none day precipitate itself upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing doubtful or speculative in these sinister forebodings.\r\nThe precise dates of the approaching catastrophes were alone uncertain.\r\nIt was known, however, that they were very distant. Accordingly, neither\r\nthe learned dissertations of men of science nor the animated\r\ndescriptions of certain poets produced any impression upon the public\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIt was not so with our scientific societies, the members of which\r\nregarded with regret the approaching destruction of our planetary\r\nsystem. The Academy of Sciences called the attention of geometers of all\r\ncountries to these menacing perturbations. Euler and Lagrange descended\r\ninto the arena. Never did their mathematical genius shine with a\r\nbrighter lustre. Still, the question remained undecided. The inutility\r\nof such efforts seemed to suggest only a feeling of resignation on the\r\nsubject, when from two disdained corners of the theories of analysis,\r\nthe author of the _Mécanique Céleste_ caused the laws of these great\r\nphenomena clearly to emerge. The variations of velocity of Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, and the Moon flowed then from evident physical causes, and\r\nentered into the category of ordinary periodic perturbations depending\r\nupon the principle of attraction. The variations in the dimensions of\r\nthe orbits which were so much dreaded resolved themselves into simple\r\noscillations included within narrow limits. Finally, by the powerful\r\ninstrumentality of mathematical analysis, the physical universe was\r\nagain established on a firm foundation.\r\n\r\nI cannot quit this subject without at least alluding to the\r\ncircumstances in the solar system upon which depend the so long\r\nunexplained variations of velocity of the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earth around the sun is mainly effected in an ellipse,\r\nthe form of which is liable to vary from the effects of planetary\r\nperturbation. These alterations of form are periodic; sometimes the\r\ncurve, without ceasing to be elliptic, approaches the form of a circle,\r\nwhile at other times it deviates more and more from that form. From the\r\nepoch of the earliest recorded observations, the eccentricity of the\r\nterrestrial orbit has been diminishing from year to year; at some future\r\nepoch the orbit, on the contrary, will begin to deviate from the form of\r\na circle, and the eccentricity will increase to the same extent as it\r\npreviously diminished, and according to the same laws.\r\n\r\nNow, Laplace has shown that the mean motion of the moon around the\r\nearth is connected with the form of the ellipse which the earth\r\ndescribes around the sun; that a diminution of the eccentricity of the\r\nellipse inevitably induces an increase in the velocity of our satellite,\r\nand _vice versâ_; finally, that this cause suffices to explain the\r\nnumerical value of the acceleration which the mean motion of the moon\r\nhas experienced from the earliest ages down to the present time.[33]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the inequalities in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn\r\nwill be, I hope, as easy to conceive.\r\n\r\nMathematical analysis has not served to represent in finite terms the\r\nvalues of the derangements which each planet experiences in its movement\r\nfrom the action of all the other planets. In the present state of\r\nscience, this value is exhibited in the form of an indefinite series of\r\nterms diminishing rapidly in magnitude. In calculation, it is usual to\r\nneglect such of those terms as correspond in the order of magnitude to\r\nquantities beneath the errors of observation. But there are cases in\r\nwhich the order of the term in the series does not decide whether it be\r\nsmall or great. Certain numerical relations between the primitive\r\nelements of the disturbing and disturbed planets may impart sensible\r\nvalues to terms which usually admit of being neglected. This case occurs\r\nin the perturbations of Saturn produced by Jupiter, and in those of\r\nJupiter produced by Saturn. There exists between the mean motions of\r\nthese two great planets a simple relation of commensurability, five\r\ntimes the mean motion of Saturn, being, in fact, very nearly equal to\r\ntwice the mean motion of Jupiter. It happens, in consequence, that\r\ncertain terms, which would otherwise be very small, acquire from this\r\ncircumstance considerable values. Hence arise in the movements of these\r\ntwo planets, inequalities of long duration which require more than 900\r\nyears for their complete development, and which represent with\r\nmarvellous accuracy all the irregularities disclosed by observation.\r\n\r\nIs it not astonishing to find in the commensurability of the mean\r\nmotions of two planets, a cause of perturbation of so influential a\r\nnature; to discover that the definitive solution of an immense\r\ndifficulty--which baffled the genius of Euler, and which even led\r\npersons to doubt whether the theory of gravitation was capable of\r\naccounting for all the phenomena of the heavens--should depend upon the\r\nfortuitous circumstance of five times the mean motion of Saturn being\r\nequal to twice the mean motion of Jupiter? The beauty of the conception\r\nand the ultimate result are here equally worthy of admiration.[34]\r\n\r\nWe have just explained how Laplace demonstrated that the solar system\r\ncan experience only small periodic oscillations around a certain mean\r\nstate. Let us now see in what way he succeeded in determining the\r\nabsolute dimensions of the orbits.\r\n\r\nWhat is the distance of the sun from the earth? No scientific question\r\nhas occupied in a greater degree the attention of mankind;\r\nmathematically speaking, nothing is more simple. It suffices, as in\r\ncommon operations of surveying, to draw visual lines from the two\r\nextremities of a known base to an inaccessible object. The remainder is\r\na process of elementary calculation. Unfortunately, in the case of the\r\nsun, the distance is great and the bases which can be measured upon the\r\nearth are comparatively very small. In such a case the slightest errors\r\nin the direction of the visual lines exercise an enormous influence upon\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last century Halley remarked that certain\r\ninterpositions of Venus between the earth and the sun, or, to use an\r\nexpression applied to such conjunctions, that the _transits_ of the\r\nplanet across the sun's disk, would furnish at each observatory an\r\nindirect means of fixing the position of the visual ray very superior in\r\naccuracy to the most perfect direct methods.[35]\r\n\r\nSuch was the object of the scientific expeditions undertaken in 1761 and\r\n1769, on which occasions France, not to speak of stations in Europe, was\r\nrepresented at the Isle of Rodrigo by Pingré, at the Isle of St. Domingo\r\nby Fleurin, at California by the Abbé Chappe, at Pondicherry by\r\nLegentil. At the same epochs England sent Maskelyne to St. Helena, Wales\r\nto Hudson's Bay, Mason to the Cape of Good Hope, Captain Cooke to\r\nOtaheite, &c. The observations of the southern hemisphere compared with\r\nthose of Europe, and especially with the observations made by an\r\nAustrian astronomer Father Hell at Wardhus in Lapland, gave for the\r\ndistance of the sun the result which has since figured in all treatises\r\non astronomy and navigation.\r\n\r\nNo government hesitated in furnishing Academies with the means, however\r\nexpensive they might be, of conveniently establishing their observers in\r\nthe most distant regions. We have already remarked that the\r\ndetermination of the contemplated distance appeared to demand\r\nimperiously an extensive base, for small bases would have been totally\r\ninadequate to the purpose. Well, Laplace has solved the problem\r\nnumerically without a base of any kind whatever; he has deduced the\r\ndistance of the sun from observations of the moon made in one and the\r\nsame place!\r\n\r\nThe sun is, with respect to our satellite, the cause of perturbations\r\nwhich evidently depend on the distance of the immense luminous globe\r\nfrom the earth. Who does not see that these perturbations would diminish\r\nif the distance increased; that they would increase on the contrary, if\r\nthe distance diminished; that the distance finally determines the\r\nmagnitude of the perturbations?\r\n\r\nObservation assigns the numerical value of these perturbations; theory,\r\non the other hand, unfolds the general mathematical relation which\r\nconnects them with the solar parallax, and with other known elements.\r\nThe determination of the mean radius of the terrestrial orbit then\r\nbecomes one of the most simple operations of algebra. Such is the happy\r\ncombination by the aid of which Laplace has solved the great, the\r\ncelebrated problem of parallax. It is thus that the illustrious geometer\r\nfound for the mean distance of the sun from the earth, expressed in\r\nradii of the terrestrial orbit, a value differing only in a slight\r\ndegree from that which was the fruit of so many troublesome and\r\nexpensive voyages. According to the opinion of very competent judges the\r\nresult of the indirect method might not impossibly merit the\r\npreference.[36]\r\n\r\nThe movements of the moon proved a fertile mine of research to our\r\ngreat geometer. His penetrating intellect discovered in them unknown\r\ntreasures. He disentangled them from every thing which concealed them\r\nfrom vulgar eyes with an ability and a perseverance equally worthy of\r\nadmiration. The reader will excuse me for citing another of such\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe earth governs the movements of the moon. The earth is flattened, in\r\nother words its figure is spheroidal. A spheroidal body does not attract\r\nlike a sphere. There ought then to exist in the movement, I had almost\r\nsaid in the countenance of the moon, a sort of impression of the\r\nspheroidal figure of the earth. Such was the idea as it originally\r\noccurred to Laplace.\r\n\r\nIt still remained to ascertain (and here consisted the chief\r\ndifficulty), whether the effects attributable to the spheroidal figure\r\nof the earth were sufficiently sensible not to be confounded with the\r\nerrors of observation. It was accordingly necessary to find the general\r\nformula of perturbations of this nature, in order to be able, as in the\r\ncase of the solar parallax, to eliminate the unknown quantity.\r\n\r\nThe ardour of Laplace, combined with his power of analytical research,\r\nsurmounted all obstacles. By means of an investigation which demanded\r\nthe most minute attention, the great geometer discovered in the theory\r\nof the moon's movements, two well-defined perturbations depending on the\r\nspheroidal figure of the earth. The first affected the resolved element\r\nof the motion of our satellite which is chiefly measured with the\r\ninstrument known in observatories by the name of the transit instrument;\r\nthe second, which operated in the direction north and south, could only\r\nbe effected by observations with a second instrument termed the mural\r\ncircle. These two inequalities of very different magnitudes connected\r\nwith the cause which produces them by analytical combinations of totally\r\ndifferent kinds have, however, both conducted to the same value of the\r\nellipticity. It must be borne in mind, however, that the ellipticity\r\nthus deduced from the movements of the moon, is not the ellipticity\r\ncorresponding to such or such a country, the ellipticity observed in\r\nFrance, in England, in Italy, in Lapland, in North America, in India, or\r\nin the region of the Cape of Good Hope, for the earth's materials having\r\nundergone considerable upheavings at different times and in different\r\nplaces, the primitive regularity of its curvature has been sensibly\r\ndisturbed by this cause. The moon, and it is this circumstance which\r\nrenders the result of such inestimable value, ought to assign, and has\r\nin reality assigned the general ellipticity of the earth; in other\r\nwords, it has indicated a sort of mean value of the various\r\ndeterminations obtained at enormous expense, and with infinite labour,\r\nas the result of long voyages undertaken by astronomers of all the\r\ncountries of Europe.\r\n\r\nI shall add a few brief remarks, for which I am mainly indebted to the\r\nauthor of the _Mécanique Céleste_. They seem to be eminently adapted for\r\nillustrating the profound, the unexpected, and almost paradoxical\r\ncharacter of the methods which I have just attempted to sketch.\r\n\r\nWhat are the elements which it has been found necessary to confront with\r\neach other in order to arrive at results expressed even to the precision\r\nof the smallest decimals?\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, mathematical formulæ, deduced from the principle of\r\nuniversal attraction; on the other hand, certain irregularities observed\r\nin the returns of the moon to the meridian.\r\n\r\nAn observing geometer who, from his infancy, had never quitted his\r\nchamber of study, and who had never viewed the heavens except through a\r\nnarrow aperture directed north and south, in the vertical plane in which\r\nthe principal astronomical instruments are made to move,--to whom\r\nnothing had ever been revealed respecting the bodies revolving above his\r\nhead, except that they attract each other according to the Newtonian law\r\nof gravitation,--would, however, be enabled to ascertain that his narrow\r\nabode was situated upon the surface of a spheroidal body, the equatorial\r\naxis of which surpassed the polar axis by a _three hundred and sixth\r\npart_; he would have also found, in his isolated immovable position, his\r\ntrue distance from the sun.\r\n\r\nI have stated at the commencement of this Notice, that it is to\r\nD'Alembert we owe the first satisfactory mathematical explanation of the\r\nphenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes. But our illustrious\r\ncountryman, as well as Euler, whose solution appeared subsequently to\r\nthat of D'Alembert, omitted all consideration of certain physical\r\ncircumstances, which, however, did not seem to be of a nature to be\r\nneglected without examination. Laplace has supplied this deficiency. He\r\nhas shown that the sea, notwithstanding its fluidity, and that the\r\natmosphere, notwithstanding its currents, exercise the same influence on\r\nthe movements of the terrestrial axis as if they formed solid masses\r\nadhering to the terrestrial spheroid.\r\n\r\nDo the extremities of the axis around which the earth performs an entire\r\nrevolution once in every twenty-four hours, correspond always to the\r\nsame material points of the terrestrial spheroid? In other words, do the\r\npoles of rotation, which from year to year correspond to different\r\nstars, undergo also a displacement at the surface of the earth?\r\n\r\nIn the case of the affirmative, the equator is movable as well as the\r\npoles; the terrestrial latitudes are variable; no country during the\r\nlapse of ages will enjoy, even on an average, a constant climate;\r\nregions the most different will, in their turn, become circumpolar.\r\nAdopt the contrary supposition, and every thing assumes the character of\r\nan admirable permanence.\r\n\r\nThe question which I have just suggested, one of the most important in\r\nAstronomy, cannot be solved by the aid of mere observation on account of\r\nthe uncertainty of the early determinations of terrestrial latitude.\r\nLaplace has supplied this defect by analysis. The great geometer has\r\ndemonstrated that no circumstance depending on universal gravitation can\r\nsensibly displace the poles of the earth's axis relatively to the\r\nsurface of the terrestrial spheroid. The sea, far from being an obstacle\r\nto the invariable rotation of the earth upon its axis, would, on the\r\ncontrary, reduce the axis to a permanent condition in consequence of the\r\nmobility of the waters and the resistance which their oscillations\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe remarks which I have just made with respect to the position of the\r\nterrestrial axis are equally applicable to the time of the earth's\r\nrotation which is the unit, the true standard of time. The importance of\r\nthis element induced Laplace to examine whether its numerical value\r\nmight not be liable to vary from internal causes such as earthquakes and\r\nvolcanoes. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the result\r\nobtained was negative.\r\n\r\nThe admirable memoir of Lagrange upon the libration of the moon seemed\r\nto have exhausted the subject. This, however, was not the case.\r\n\r\nThe motion of revolution of our satellite around the earth is subject to\r\nperturbations, technically termed _secular_, which were either unknown\r\nto Lagrange or which he neglected. These inequalities eventually place\r\nthe body, not to speak of entire circumferences, at angular distances of\r\na semi-circle, a circle and a half, &c., from the position which it\r\nwould otherwise occupy. If the movement of rotation did not participate\r\nin such perturbations, the moon in the lapse of ages would present in\r\nsuccession all the parts of its surface to the earth.\r\n\r\nThis event will not occur. The hemisphere of the moon which is actually\r\ninvisible, will remain invisible for ever. Laplace, in fact, has shown\r\nthat the attraction of the earth introduces into the rotatory motion of\r\nthe lunar spheroid the secular inequalities which exist in the movement\r\nof revolution.\r\n\r\nResearches of this nature exhibit in full relief the power of\r\nmathematical analysis. It would have been very difficult to have\r\ndiscovered by synthesis truths so profoundly enveloped in the complex\r\naction of a multitude of forces.\r\n\r\nWe should be inexcusable if we omitted to notice the high importance of\r\nthe labours of Laplace on the improvement of the lunar tables. The\r\nimmediate object of this improvement was, in effect, the promotion of\r\nmaritime intercourse between distant countries, and, what was indeed far\r\nsuperior to all considerations of mercantile interest, the preservation\r\nof the lives of mariners.\r\n\r\nThanks to a sagacity without parallel, to a perseverance which knew no\r\nlimits, to an ardour always youthful and which communicated itself to\r\nable coadjutors, Laplace solved the celebrated problem of the longitude\r\nmore completely than could have been hoped for in a scientific point of\r\nview, with greater precision than the art of navigation in its utmost\r\nrefinement demanded. The ship, the sport of the winds and tempests, has\r\nno occasion, in the present day, to be afraid of losing itself in the\r\nimmensity of the ocean. An intelligent glance at the starry vault\r\nindicates to the pilot, in every place and at every time, his distance\r\nfrom the meridian of Paris. The extreme perfection of the existing\r\ntables of the moon entitles Laplace to be ranked among the benefactors\r\nof humanity.[37]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1611, Galileo supposed that he found in the\r\neclipses of Jupiter's satellites a simple and rigorous solution of the\r\nfamous problem of the longitude, and active negotiations were\r\nimmediately commenced with the view of introducing the new method on\r\nboard the numerous vessels of Spain and Holland. These negotiations\r\nfailed. From the discussion it plainly appeared that the accurate\r\nobservation of the eclipses of the satellites would require powerful\r\ntelescopes; but such telescopes could not be employed on board a ship\r\ntossed about by the waves.\r\n\r\nThe method of Galileo seemed, at any rate, to retain all its advantages\r\nwhen applied on land, and to promise immense improvements to geography.\r\nThese expectations were found to be premature. The movements of the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter are not by any means so simple as the immortal\r\ninventor of the method of longitudes supposed them to be. It was\r\nnecessary that three generations of astronomers and mathematicians\r\nshould labour with perseverance in unfolding their most considerable\r\nperturbations. It was necessary, in fine, that the tables of those\r\nbodies should acquire all desirable and necessary precision, that\r\nLaplace should introduce into the midst of them the torch of\r\nmathematical analysis.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, the nautical ephemerides contain, several years in\r\nadvance, the indication of the times of the eclipses and reappearances\r\nof Jupiter's satellites. Calculation does not yield in precision to\r\ndirect observation. In this group of satellites, considered as an\r\nindependent system of bodies, Laplace found a series of perturbations\r\nanalogous to those which the planets experience. The rapidity of the\r\nrevolutions unfolds, in a sufficiently short space of time, changes in\r\nthis system which require centuries for their complete development in\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the satellites exhibit hardly an appreciable diameter even when\r\nviewed in the best telescopes, our illustrious countryman was enabled to\r\ndetermine their masses. Finally, he discovered certain simple relations\r\nof an extremely remarkable character between the movements of those\r\nbodies, which have been called _the laws of Laplace_. Posterity will not\r\nobliterate this designation; it will acknowledge the propriety of\r\ninscribing in the heavens the name of so great an astronomer beside that\r\nof Kepler.\r\n\r\nLet us cite two or three of the laws of Laplace:--\r\n\r\nIf we add to the mean longitude of the first satellite twice that of the\r\nthird, and subtract from the sum three times the mean longitude of the\r\nsecond, the result will be exactly equal to 180°.\r\n\r\nWould it not be very extraordinary if the three satellites had been\r\nplaced originally at the distances from Jupiter, and in the positions,\r\nwith respect to each other, adapted for constantly and rigorously\r\nmaintaining the foregoing relation? Laplace has replied to this question\r\nby showing that it is not necessary that this relation should have been\r\nrigorously true at the origin. The mutual action of the satellites would\r\nnecessarily have reduced it to its present mathematical condition, if\r\nonce the distances and the positions satisfied the law approximately.\r\n\r\nThis first law is equally true when we employ the synodical elements. It\r\nhence plainly results, that the first three satellites of Jupiter can\r\nnever be all eclipsed at the same time. Bearing this in mind, we shall\r\nhave no difficulty in apprehending the import of a celebrated\r\nobservation of recent times, during which certain astronomers perceived\r\nthe planet for a short time without any of his four satellites. This\r\nwould not by any means authorize us in supposing the satellites to be\r\neclipsed. A satellite disappears when it is projected upon the central\r\npart of the luminous disk of Jupiter, and also when it passes behind the\r\nopaque body of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe following is another very simple law to which the mean motions of\r\nthe same satellites of Jupiter are subject:\r\n\r\nIf we add to the mean motion of the first satellite twice the mean\r\nmotion of the third, the sum is exactly equal to three times the mean\r\nmotion of the second.[38]\r\n\r\nThis numerical coincidence, which is perfectly accurate, would be one of\r\nthe most mysterious phenomena in the system of the universe if Laplace\r\nhad not proved that the law need only have been approximate at the\r\norigin, and that the mutual action of the satellites has sufficed to\r\nrender it rigorous.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious geometer, who always pursued his researches to their\r\nmost remote ramifications, arrived at the following result: The action\r\nof Jupiter regulates the movements of rotation of the satellites so\r\nthat, without taking into account the secular perturbations, the time of\r\nrotation of the first satellite plus twice the time of rotation of the\r\nthird, forms a sum which is constantly equal to three times the time of\r\nrotation of the second.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by a deference, a modesty, a timidity, without any plausible\r\nmotive, our artists in the last century surrendered to the English the\r\nexclusive privilege of constructing instruments of astronomy. Thus, let\r\nus frankly acknowledge the fact, at the time when Herschel was\r\nprosecuting his beautiful observations on the other side of the Channel,\r\nthere existed in France no instruments adapted for developing them; we\r\nhad not even the means of verifying them. Fortunately for the scientific\r\nhonour of our country, mathematical analysis is also a powerful\r\ninstrument. Laplace gave ample proof of this on a memorable occasion\r\nwhen from the retirement of his chamber he predicted, he minutely\r\nannounced, what the excellent astronomer of Windsor would see with the\r\nlargest telescopes which were ever constructed by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nWhen Galileo, in the beginning of the year 1610, directed towards Saturn\r\na telescope of very low power which he had just executed with his own\r\nhands, he perceived that the planet was not an ordinary globe, without\r\nhowever being able to ascertain its real form. The expression\r\n_tri-corporate_, by which the illustrious Florentine designated the\r\nappearance of the planet, implied even a totally erroneous idea of its\r\nstructure. Our countryman Roberval entertained much sounder views on the\r\nsubject, but from not having instituted a detailed comparison between\r\nhis hypothesis and the results of observation, he abandoned to Huyghens\r\nthe honour of being regarded as the author of the true theory of the\r\nphenomena presented by the wonderful planet.\r\n\r\nEvery person knows, in the present day, that Saturn consists of a globe\r\nabout 900 times greater than the earth, and a ring. This ring does not\r\ntouch the ball of the planet, being everywhere removed from it at a\r\ndistance of 20,000 (English) miles. Observation indicates the breadth of\r\nthe ring to be 54,000 miles. The thickness certainly does not exceed 250\r\nmiles. With the exception of a black streak which divides the ring\r\nthroughout its whole contour into two parts of unequal breadth and of\r\ndifferent brightness, this strange colossal bridge without piles had\r\nnever offered to the most experienced or skilful observers either spot\r\nor protuberance adapted for deciding whether it was immovable or endued\r\nwith a movement of rotation.\r\n\r\nLaplace considered it to be very improbable, if the ring was immovable,\r\nthat its constituent parts should be capable of resisting by their mere\r\ncohesion the continual attraction of the planet. A movement of rotation\r\noccurred to his mind as constituting the principle of stability, and he\r\nhence deduced the necessary velocity. The velocity thus found was\r\nexactly equal to that which Herschel subsequently deduced from a course\r\nof extremely delicate observations.\r\n\r\nThe two parts of the ring being placed at different distances from the\r\nplanet, could not fail to experience from the action of the sun,\r\ndifferent movements of rotation. It would hence seem that the planes of\r\nboth rings ought to be generally inclined towards each other, whereas\r\nthey appear from observation always to coincide. It was necessary then\r\nthat some physical cause should exist which would be capable of\r\nneutralizing the action of the sun. In a memoir published in February,\r\n1789, Laplace found that this cause must reside in the ellipticity of\r\nSaturn produced by a rapid movement of rotation of the planet, a\r\nmovement the existence of which Herschel announced in November, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot fail to remark how, on certain occasions, the eyes of\r\nthe mind can supply the want of the most powerful telescopes, and lead\r\nto astronomical discoveries of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nLet us descend from the heavens upon the earth. The discoveries of\r\nLaplace will appear not less important, not less worthy of his genius.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the tides, which an ancient philosopher designated in\r\ndespair as _the tomb of human curiosity_, were connected by Laplace with\r\nan analytical theory in which the physical conditions of the question\r\nfigure for the first time. Accordingly calculators, to the immense\r\nadvantage of the navigation of our maritime coasts, venture in the\r\npresent day to predict several years in advance the details of the time\r\nand height of the full tides without more anxiety respecting the result\r\nthan if the question related to the phases of an eclipse.\r\n\r\nThere exists between the different phenomena of the ebb and flow of the\r\ntides and the attractive forces which the sun and moon exercise upon the\r\nfluid sheet which covers three fourths of the globe, an intimate and\r\nnecessary connection from which Laplace, by the aid of a series of\r\ntwenty years of observations executed at Brest, deduced the value of the\r\nmass of our satellite. Science knows in the present day that\r\nseventy-five moons would be necessary to form a weight equivalent to\r\nthat of the terrestrial globe, and it is indebted for this result to an\r\nattentive and minute study of the oscillations of the ocean. We know\r\nonly one means of enhancing the admiration which every thoughtful mind\r\nwill entertain for theories capable of leading to such conclusions. An\r\nhistorical statement will supply it. In the year 1631, the illustrious\r\nGalileo, as appears from his _Dialogues_, was so far from perceiving the\r\nmathematical relations from which Laplace deduced results so beautiful,\r\nso unequivocal, and so useful, that he taxed with frivolousness the\r\nvague idea which Kepler entertained of attributing to the moon's\r\nattraction a certain share in the production of the diurnal and\r\nperiodical movements of the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\nLaplace did not confine himself to extending so considerably, and\r\nimproving so essentially, the mathematical theory of the tides; he\r\nconsidered the phenomenon from an entirely new point of view; it was he\r\nwho first treated of the stability of the ocean. Systems of bodies,\r\nwhether solid or fluid, are subject to two kinds of equilibrium, which\r\nwe must carefully distinguish from each other. In the case of stable\r\nequilibrium the system, when slightly disturbed, tends always to return\r\nto its original condition. On the other hand, when the system is in\r\nunstable equilibrium, a very insignificant derangement might occasion an\r\nenormous dislocation in the relative positions of its constituent parts.\r\n\r\nIf the equilibrium of waves is of the latter kind, the waves engendered\r\nby the action of winds, by earthquakes, and by sudden movements from the\r\nbottom of the ocean, have perhaps risen in past times and may rise in\r\nthe future to the height of the highest mountains. The geologist will\r\nhave the satisfaction of deducing from these prodigious oscillations a\r\nrational explanation of a great multitude of phenomena, but the public\r\nwill thereby be exposed to new and terrible catastrophes.\r\n\r\nMankind may rest assured: Laplace has proved that the equilibrium of the\r\nocean is stable, but upon the express condition (which, however, has\r\nbeen amply verified by established facts), that the mean density of the\r\nfluid mass is less than the mean density of the earth. Every thing else\r\nremaining the same, let us substitute an ocean of mercury for the actual\r\nocean, and the stability will disappear, and the fluid will frequently\r\nsurpass its boundaries, to ravage continents even to the height of the\r\nsnowy regions which lose themselves in the clouds.\r\n\r\nDoes not the reader remark how each of the analytical investigations of\r\nLaplace serves to disclose the harmony and duration of the universe and\r\nof our globe!\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that the great geometer, who had succeeded so well in\r\nthe study of the tides of the ocean, should not have occupied his\r\nattention with the tides of the atmosphere; that he should not have\r\nsubmitted to the delicate and definitive tests of a rigorous calculus,\r\nthe generally diffused opinions respecting the influence of the moon\r\nupon the height of the barometer and other meteorological phenomena.\r\n\r\nLaplace, in effect, has devoted a chapter of his splendid work to an\r\nexamination of the oscillations which the attractive force of the moon\r\nis capable of producing in our atmosphere. It results from these\r\nresearches, that, at Paris, the lunar tide produces no sensible effect\r\nupon the barometer. The height of the tide, obtained by the discussion\r\nof a long series of observations, has not exceeded two-hundredths of a\r\nmillimètre, a quantity which, in the present state of meteorological\r\nscience, is less than the probable error of observation.\r\n\r\nThe calculation to which I have just alluded, may be cited in support\r\nof considerations to which I had recourse when I wished to establish,\r\nthat if the moon alters more or less the height of the barometer,\r\naccording to its different phases, the effect is not attributable to\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nNo person was more sagacious than Laplace in discovering intimate\r\nrelations between phenomena apparently very dissimilar; no person showed\r\nhimself more skilful in deducing important conclusions from those\r\nunexpected affinities.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of his days, for example, he overthrew with a stroke\r\nof the pen, by the aid of certain observations of the moon, the\r\ncosmogonic theories of Buffon and Bailly, which were so long in favour.\r\n\r\nAccording to these theories, the earth was inevitably advancing to a\r\nstate of congelation which was close at hand. Laplace, who never\r\ncontented himself with a vague statement, sought to determine in numbers\r\nthe rapid cooling of our globe which Buffon had so eloquently but so\r\ngratuitously announced. Nothing could be more simple, better connected,\r\nor more demonstrative, than the chain of deductions of the celebrated\r\ngeometer.\r\n\r\nA body diminishes in volume when it cools. According to the most\r\nelementary principles of mechanics, a rotating body which contracts in\r\ndimensions ought inevitably to turn upon its axis with greater and\r\ngreater rapidity. The length of the day has been determined in all ages\r\nby the time of the earth's rotation; if the earth is cooling, the length\r\nof the day must be continually shortening. Now there exists a means of\r\nascertaining whether the length of the day has undergone any variation;\r\nthis consists in examining, for each century, the arc of the celestial\r\nsphere described by the moon during the interval of time which the\r\nastronomers of the existing epoch called a day,--in other words, the\r\ntime required by the earth to effect a complete rotation on its axis,\r\nthe velocity of the moon being in fact independent of the time of the\r\nearth's rotation.\r\n\r\nLet us now, after the example of Laplace, take from the standard tables\r\nthe least considerable values, if you choose, of the expansions or\r\ncontractions which solid bodies experience from changes of temperature;\r\nsearch then the annals of Grecian, Arabian, and modern astronomy for the\r\npurpose of finding in them the angular velocity of the moon, and the\r\ngreat geometer will prove, by incontrovertible evidence founded upon\r\nthese data, that during a period of two thousand years the mean\r\ntemperature of the earth has not varied to the extent of the hundredth\r\npart of a degree of the centigrade thermometer. No eloquent declamation\r\nis capable of resisting such a process of reasoning, or withstanding the\r\nforce of such numbers. The mathematics have been in all ages the\r\nimplacable adversaries of scientific romances.\r\n\r\nThe fall of bodies, if it was not a phenomenon of perpetual occurrence,\r\nwould justly excite in the highest degree the astonishment of mankind.\r\nWhat, in effect, is more extraordinary than to see an inert mass, that\r\nis to say, a mass deprived of will, a mass which ought not to have any\r\npropensity to advance in one direction more than in another, precipitate\r\nitself towards the earth as soon as it ceased to be supported!\r\n\r\nNature engenders the gravity of bodies by a process so recondite, so\r\ncompletely beyond the reach of our senses and the ordinary resources of\r\nhuman intelligence, that the philosophers of antiquity, who supposed\r\nthat they could explain every thing mechanically according to the\r\nsimple evolutions of atoms, excepted gravity from their speculations.\r\n\r\nDescartes attempted what Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, and their\r\nfollowers thought to be impossible.\r\n\r\nHe made the fall of terrestrial bodies depend upon the action of a\r\nvortex of very subtle matter circulating around the earth. The real\r\nimprovements which the illustrious Huyghens applied to the ingenious\r\nconception of our countryman were far, however, from imparting to it\r\nclearness and precision, those characteristic attributes of truth.\r\n\r\nThose persons form a very imperfect estimate of the meaning of one of\r\nthe greatest questions which has occupied the attention of modern\r\ninquirers, who regard Newton as having issued victorious from a struggle\r\nin which his two immortal predecessors had failed. Newton did not\r\ndiscover the cause of gravity any more than Galileo did. Two bodies\r\nplaced in juxtaposition approach each other. Newton does not inquire\r\ninto the nature of the force which produces this effect. The force\r\nexists, he designates it by the term attraction; but, at the same time,\r\nhe warns the reader that the term as thus used by him does not imply any\r\ndefinite idea of the physical process by which gravity is brought into\r\nexistence and operates.\r\n\r\nThe force of attraction being once admitted as a fact, Newton studies it\r\nin all terrestrial phenomena, in the revolutions of the moon, the\r\nplanets, satellites, and comets; and, as we have already stated, he\r\ndeduced from this incomparable study the simple, universal, mathematical\r\ncharacteristics of the forces which preside over the movements of all\r\nthe bodies of which our solar system is composed.\r\n\r\nThe applause of the scientific world did not prevent the immortal\r\nauthor of the _Principia_ from hearing some persons refer the principle\r\nof gravitation to the class of occult qualities. This circumstance\r\ninduced Newton and his most devoted followers to abandon the reserve\r\nwhich they had hitherto considered it their duty to maintain. Those\r\npersons were then charged with ignorance who regarded attraction as an\r\nessential property of matter, as the mysterious indication of a sort of\r\ncharm; who supposed that two bodies may act upon each other without the\r\nintervention of a third body. This force was then either the result of\r\nthe tendency of an ethereal fluid to move from the free regions of\r\nspace, where its density is a maximum, towards the planetary bodies\r\naround which there exists a greater degree of rarefaction, or the\r\nconsequence of the impulsive force of some fluid medium.\r\n\r\nNewton never expressed a definitive opinion respecting the origin of the\r\nimpulse which occasioned the attractive force of matter, at least in our\r\nsolar system. But we have strong reasons for supposing, in the present\r\nday, that in using the word _impulse_, the great geometer was thinking\r\nof the systematic ideas of Varignon and Fatio de Duillier, subsequently\r\nreinvented and perfected by Lesage: these ideas, in effect, had been\r\ncommunicated to him before they were published to the world.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lesage, there are, in the regions of space, bodies moving\r\nin every possible direction, and with excessive rapidity. The author\r\napplied to these the name of ultra-mundane corpuscles. Their totality\r\nconstituted the gravitative fluid, if indeed, the designation of a fluid\r\nbe applicable to an assemblage of particles having no mutual connexion.\r\n\r\nA single body placed in the midst of such an ocean of movable\r\nparticles, would remain at rest although it were impelled equally in\r\nevery direction. On the other hand, two bodies ought to advance towards\r\neach other, since they would serve the purpose of mutual screens, since\r\nthe surfaces facing each other would no longer be hit in the direction\r\nof their line of junction by the ultra-mundane particles, since there\r\nwould then exist currents, the effect of which would no longer be\r\nneutralized by opposite currents. It will be easily seen, besides, that\r\ntwo bodies plunged into the gravitative fluid, would tend to approach\r\neach other with an intensity which would vary in the inverse proportion\r\nof the square of the distance.\r\n\r\nIf attraction is the result of the impulse of a fluid, its action ought\r\nto employ a finite time in traversing the immense spaces which separate\r\nthe celestial bodies. If the sun, then, were suddenly extinguished, the\r\nearth after the catastrophe would, mathematically speaking, still\r\ncontinue for some time to experience its attractive influence. The\r\ncontrary would happen on the occasion of the sudden birth of a planet; a\r\ncertain time would elapse before the attractive force of the new body\r\nwould make itself felt on the earth.\r\n\r\nSeveral geometers of the last century were of opinion that the force of\r\nattraction is not transmitted instantaneously from one body to another;\r\nthey even assigned to it a comparatively inconsiderable velocity of\r\npropagation. Daniel Bernoulli, for example, in attempting to explain how\r\nthe spring tide arrives upon our coasts a day and a half after the\r\nsizygees, that is to say, a day and a half after the epochs when the sun\r\nand moon are most favourably situated for the production of this\r\nmagnificent phenomenon, assumed that the disturbing force required all\r\nthis time (a day and a half) for its propagation from the moon to the\r\nocean. So feeble a velocity was inconsistent with the mechanical\r\nexplanation of attraction of which we have just spoken. The explanation,\r\nin effect, necessarily supposes that the proper motions of the celestial\r\nbodies are insensible compared with the motion of the gravitative fluid.\r\n\r\nAfter having discovered that the diminution of the eccentricity of the\r\nterrestrial orbit is the real cause of the observed acceleration of the\r\nmotion of the moon, Laplace, on his part, endeavoured to ascertain\r\nwhether this mysterious acceleration did not depend on the gradual\r\npropagation of attraction.\r\n\r\nThe result of calculation was at first favourable to the plausibility of\r\nthe hypothesis. It showed that the gradual propagation of the attractive\r\nforce would introduce into the movement of our satellite a perturbation\r\nproportional to the square of the time which elapsed from the\r\ncommencement of any epoch; that in order to represent numerically the\r\nresults of astronomical observations it would not be necessary to assign\r\na feeble velocity to attraction; that a propagation eight millions of\r\ntimes more rapid than that of light would satisfy all the phenomena.\r\n\r\nAlthough the true cause of the acceleration of the moon is now well\r\nknown, the ingenious calculation of which I have just spoken does not\r\nthe less on that account maintain its place in science. In a\r\nmathematical point of view, the perturbation depending on the gradual\r\npropagation of the attractive force which this calculation indicates has\r\na certain existence. The connexion between the velocity of perturbation\r\nand the resulting inequality is such that one of the two quantities\r\nleads to a knowledge of the numerical value of the other. Now, upon\r\nassigning to the inequality the greatest value which is consistent with\r\nthe observations after they have been corrected for the effect due to\r\nthe variation of the eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit, we find the\r\nvelocity of the attractive force to be fifty millions of times the\r\nvelocity of light!\r\n\r\nIf it be borne in mind, that this number is an inferior limit, and that\r\nthe velocity of the rays of light amounts to 77,000 leagues (192,000\r\nEnglish miles) per second, the philosophers who profess to explain the\r\nforce of attraction by the impulsive energy of a fluid, will see what\r\nprodigious velocities they must satisfy.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot fail again to remark the sagacity with which Laplace\r\nsingled out the phenomena which were best adapted for throwing light\r\nupon the most obscure points of celestial physics; nor the success with\r\nwhich he explored their various parts, and deduced from them numerical\r\nconclusions in presence of which the mind remains confounded.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Mécanique Céleste_ supposed, like Newton, that light\r\nconsists of material molecules of excessive tenuity and endued in empty\r\nspace with a velocity of 77,000 leagues in a second. However, it is\r\nright to warn those who would be inclined to avail themselves of this\r\nimposing authority, that the principal argument of Laplace, in favour of\r\nthe system of emission, consisted in the advantage which it afforded of\r\nsubmitting every question to a process of simple and rigorous\r\ncalculation; whereas, on the other hand, the theory of undulations has\r\nalways offered immense difficulties to analysts. It was natural that a\r\ngeometer who had so elegantly connected the laws of simple refraction\r\nwhich light undergoes in its passage through the atmosphere, and the\r\nlaws of double refraction which it is subject to in the course of its\r\npassage through certain crystals, with the action of attractive and\r\nrepulsive forces, should not have abandoned this route, before he\r\nrecognized the impossibility of arriving by the same path, at plausible\r\nexplanations of the phenomena of diffraction and polarization. In other\r\nrespects, the care which Laplace always employed, in pursuing his\r\nresearches, as far as possible, to their numerical results, will enable\r\nthose who are disposed to institute a complete comparison between the\r\ntwo rival theories of light, to derive from the _Mécanique Céleste_ the\r\nmaterials of several interesting relations.\r\n\r\nIs light an emanation from the sun? Does this body launch out\r\nincessantly in every direction a part of its own substance? Is it\r\ngradually diminishing in volume and mass? The attraction exercised by\r\nthe sun upon the earth will, in that case, gradually become less and\r\nless considerable. The radius of the terrestrial orbit, on the other\r\nhand, cannot fail to increase, and a corresponding effect will be\r\nproduced on the length of the year.\r\n\r\nThis is the conclusion which suggests itself to every person upon a\r\nfirst glance at the subject. By applying analysis to the question, and\r\nthen proceeding to numerical computations, founded upon the most\r\ntrustworthy results of observation relative to the length of the year in\r\ndifferent ages, Laplace has proved that an incessant emission of light,\r\ngoing on for a period of two thousand years, has not diminished the mass\r\nof the sun by the two-millionth part of its original value.\r\n\r\nOur illustrious countryman never proposed to himself any thing vague or\r\nindefinite. His constant object was the explanation of the great\r\nphenomena of nature, according to the inflexible principles of\r\nmathematical analysis. No philosopher, no mathematician, could have\r\nmaintained himself more cautiously on his guard against a propensity to\r\nhasty speculation. No person dreaded more the scientific errors which\r\nthe imagination gives birth to, when it ceases to remain within the\r\nlimits of facts, of calculation, and of analogy. Once, and once only,\r\ndid Laplace launch forward, like Kepler, like Descartes, like Leibnitz,\r\nlike Buffon, into the region of conjectures. His conception was not then\r\nless than a cosmogony.\r\n\r\nAll the planets revolve around the sun, from west to east, and in planes\r\nwhich include angles of inconsiderable magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe satellites revolve around their respective primaries in the same\r\ndirection as that in which the planets revolve around the sun, that is\r\nto say, from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe planets and satellites which have been found to have a rotatory\r\nmotion, turn also upon their axes from west to east. Finally, the\r\nrotation of the sun is directed from west to east. We have here then an\r\nassemblage of forty-three movements, all operating in the same\r\ndirection. By the calculus of probabilities, the odds are four thousand\r\nmillions to one, that this coincidence in the direction of so many\r\nmovements is not the effect of accident.\r\n\r\nIt was Buffon, I think, who first attempted to explain this singular\r\nfeature of our solar system. Having wished, in the explanation of\r\nphenomena, to avoid all recourse to causes which were not warranted by\r\nnature, the celebrated academician investigated a physical origin of the\r\nsystem in what was common to the movements of so many bodies differing\r\nin magnitude, in form, and in distance from the principal centre of\r\nattraction. He imagined that he discovered such an origin by making\r\nthis triple supposition: a comet fell obliquely upon the sun; it pushed\r\nbefore it a torrent of fluid matter; this substance transported to a\r\ngreater or less distance from the sun according to its mass formed by\r\nconcentration all the known planets.\r\n\r\nThe bold hypothesis of Buffon is liable to insurmountable difficulties.\r\nI proceed to indicate, in a few words, the cosmogonic system which\r\nLaplace substituted for that of the illustrious author of the _Histoire\r\nNaturelle_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Laplace, the sun was at a remote epoch the central nucleus\r\nof an immense nebula, which possessed a very high temperature, and\r\nextended far beyond the region in which Uranus revolves in the present\r\nday. No planet was then in existence.\r\n\r\nThe solar nebula was endued with a general movement of revolution\r\ndirected from west to east. As it cooled it could not fail to experience\r\na gradual condensation, and, in consequence, to rotate with greater and\r\ngreater rapidity. If the nebulous matter extended originally in the\r\nplane of the equator as far as the limit at which the centrifugal force\r\nexactly counterbalanced the attraction of the nucleus, the molecules\r\nsituate at this limit ought, during the process of condensation, to\r\nseparate from the rest of the atmospheric matter and form an equatorial\r\nzone, a ring revolving separately and with its primitive velocity. We\r\nmay conceive that analogous separations were effected in the higher\r\nstrata of the nebula at different epochs, that is to say, at different\r\ndistances from the nucleus, and that they give rise to a succession of\r\ndistinct rings, included almost in the same plane and endued with\r\ndifferent velocities.\r\n\r\nThis being once admitted, it is easy to see that the indefinite\r\nstability of the rings would have required a regularity of structure\r\nthroughout their whole contour, which is very improbable. Each of them\r\naccordingly broke in its turn into several masses, which were plainly\r\nendued with a movement of rotation, coinciding in direction with the\r\ncommon movement of revolution, and which in consequence of their\r\nfluidity assumed spheroidal forms.\r\n\r\nIn order, then, that one of those spheroids might absorb all the others\r\nbelonging to the same ring, it will be sufficient to assign to it a mass\r\ngreater than that of any other spheroid.\r\n\r\nEach of the planets, while in the vaporous condition to which we have\r\njust alluded, would manifestly have a central nucleus gradually\r\nincreasing in magnitude and mass, and an atmosphere offering, at its\r\nsuccessive limits, phenomena entirely similar to those which the solar\r\natmosphere, properly so called, had exhibited. We here witness the birth\r\nof satellites, and that of the ring of Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe system, of which I have just given an imperfect sketch, has for its\r\nobject to show how a nebula endued with a general movement of rotation\r\nmust eventually transform itself into a very luminous central nucleus (a\r\nsun) and into a series of distinct spheroidal planets, situate at\r\nconsiderable distances from each other, revolving all around the central\r\nsun in the direction of the original movement of the nebula; how these\r\nplanets ought also to have movements of rotation operating in similar\r\ndirections; how, finally, the satellites, when any of such are formed,\r\ncannot fail to revolve upon their axes and around their respective\r\nprimaries, in the direction of rotation of the planets and of their\r\nmovement of revolution around the sun.\r\n\r\nWe have just found, conformably to the principles of mechanics, the\r\nforces with which the particles of the nebula were originally endued, in\r\nthe movements of rotation and revolution of the compact and distinct\r\nmasses which these particles have brought into existence by their\r\ncondensation. But we have thereby achieved only a single step. The\r\nprimitive movement of rotation of the nebula is not connected with the\r\nsimple attraction of the particles. This movement seems to imply the\r\naction of a primordial impulsive force.\r\n\r\nLaplace is far from adopting, in this respect, the almost universal\r\nopinion of philosophers and mathematicians. He does not suppose that the\r\nmutual attractions of originally immovable bodies must ultimately reduce\r\nall the bodies to a state of rest around their common centre of gravity.\r\nHe maintains, on the contrary, that three bodies, in a state of rest,\r\ntwo of which have a much greater mass than the third, would concentrate\r\ninto a single mass only in certain exceptional cases. In general, the\r\ntwo most considerable bodies would unite together, while the third would\r\nrevolve around their common centre of gravity. Attraction would thus\r\nbecome the cause of a sort of movement which would seem to be explicable\r\nsolely by an impulsive force.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed, indeed, that in explaining this part of his system\r\nLaplace had before his eyes the words which Rousseau has placed in the\r\nmouth of the vicar of Savoy, and that he wished to refute them: \"Newton\r\nhas discovered the law of attraction,\" says the author of _Emile_, \"but\r\nattraction alone would soon reduce the universe to an immovable mass:\r\nwith this law we must combine a projectile force in order to make the\r\ncelestial bodies describe curve lines. Let Descartes reveal to us the\r\nphysical law which causes his vortices to revolve; and let Newton show\r\nus the hand which launched the planets along the tangents of their\r\norbits.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the cosmogonic ideas of Laplace, comets did not originally\r\nform part of the solar system; they are not formed at the expense of the\r\nmatter of the immense solar nebula; we must consider them as small\r\nwandering nebulæ which the attractive force of the sun has caused to\r\ndeviate from their original route. Such of those comets as penetrated\r\ninto the great nebula at the epoch of condensation and of the formation\r\nof planets fell into the sun, describing spiral curves, and must by\r\ntheir action have caused the planetary orbits to deviate more or less\r\nfrom the plane of the solar equator, with which they would otherwise\r\nhave exactly coincided.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the zodiacal light, that rock against which so many\r\nreveries have been wrecked, it consists of the most volatile parts of\r\nthe primitive nebula. These molecules not having united with the\r\nequatorial zones successively abandoned in the plane of the solar\r\nequator, continued to revolve at their original distances, and with\r\ntheir original velocities. The circumstance of this extremely rare\r\nsubstance being included wholly within the earth's orbit, and even\r\nwithin that of Venus, seemed irreconcilable with the principles of\r\nmechanics; but this difficulty occurred only when the zodiacal substance\r\nbeing conceived to be in a state of direct and intimate dependence on\r\nthe solar photosphere properly so called, an angular movement of\r\nrotation was impressed on it equal to that of the photosphere, a\r\nmovement in virtue of which it effected an entire revolution in\r\ntwenty-five days and a half. Laplace presented his conjectures on the\r\nformation of the solar system with the diffidence inspired by a result\r\nwhich was not founded upon calculation and observation.[39] Perhaps it\r\nis to be regretted that they did not receive a more complete\r\ndevelopment, especially in so far as concerns the division of the matter\r\ninto distinct rings; perhaps it would have been desirable if the\r\nillustrious author had expressed himself more fully respecting the\r\nprimitive physical condition, the molecular condition of the nebula at\r\nthe expense of which the sun, planets, and satellites, of our system\r\nwere formed. It is perhaps especially to be regretted that Laplace\r\nshould have only briefly alluded to what he considered the obvious\r\npossibility of movements of revolution having their origin in the action\r\nof simple attractive forces, and to other questions of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these defects, the ideas of the author of the _Mécanique\r\nCéleste_ are still the only speculations of the kind which, by their\r\nmagnitude, their coherence, and their mathematical character, may be\r\njustly considered as forming a physical cosmogony; those alone which in\r\nthe present day derive a powerful support from the results of the recent\r\nresearches of astronomers on the nebulæ of every form and magnitude,\r\nwhich are scattered throughout the celestial vault.\r\n\r\nIn this analysis, we have deemed it right to concentrate all our\r\nattention upon the _Mécanique Céleste_. The _Système du Monde_ and the\r\n_Théorie Analytique des Probabilités_ would also require detailed\r\nnotices.\r\n\r\nThe _Exposition du Système du Monde_ is the _Mécanique Céleste_ divested\r\nof the great apparatus of analytical formulæ which ought to be\r\nattentively perused by every astronomer who, to use an expression of\r\nPlato, is desirous of knowing the numbers which govern the physical\r\nuniverse. It is in the _Exposition du Systéme du Monde_ that persons\r\nunacquainted with mathematical studies will obtain an exact and\r\ncompetent knowledge of the methods to which physical astronomy is\r\nindebted for its astonishing progress. This work, written with a noble\r\nsimplicity of style, an exquisite propriety of expression, and a\r\nscrupulous accuracy, is terminated by a sketch of the history of\r\nastronomy, universally ranked in the present day among the finest\r\nmonuments of the French language.\r\n\r\nA regret has been often expressed, that Cæsar, in his immortal\r\n_Commentaries_, should have confined himself to a narration of his own\r\ncampaigns: the astronomical commentaries of Laplace ascend to the origin\r\nof communities. The labours undertaken in all ages for the purpose of\r\nextracting new truths from the heavens, are there justly, clearly, and\r\nprofoundly analyzed; it is genius presiding as the impartial judge of\r\ngenius. Laplace has always remained at the height of his great mission;\r\nhis work will be read with respect so long as the torch of science shall\r\ncontinue to throw any light.\r\n\r\nThe calculus of probabilities, when confined within just limits, ought\r\nto interest, in an equal degree, the mathematician, the experimentalist,\r\nand the statesman. From the time when Pascal and Fermat established its\r\nfirst principles, it has rendered and continues daily to render services\r\nof the most eminent kind. It is the calculus of probabilities, which,\r\nafter having suggested the best arrangements of the tables of population\r\nand mortality, teaches us to deduce from those numbers, in general so\r\nerroneously interpreted, conclusions of a precise and useful character:\r\nit is the calculus of probabilities which alone can regulate justly the\r\npremiums to be paid for assurances; the reserve funds for the\r\ndisbursement of pensions, annuities, discounts, &c.: it is under its\r\ninfluence that lotteries, and other shameful snares cunningly laid for\r\navarice and ignorance, have definitively disappeared. Laplace has\r\ntreated these questions, and others of a much more complicated nature,\r\nwith his accustomed superiority. In short, the _Théorie Analytique des\r\nProbabilités_ is worthy of the author of the _Mécanique Céleste_.\r\n\r\nA philosopher, whose name is associated with immortal discoveries, said\r\nto his audience who had allowed themselves to be influenced by ancient\r\nand consecrated authorities, \"Bear in mind, Gentlemen, that in questions\r\nof science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning\r\nof a single individual.\" Two centuries have passed over these words of\r\nGalileo without depreciating their value, or obliterating their truthful\r\ncharacter. Thus, instead of displaying a long list of illustrious\r\nadmirers of the three beautiful works of Laplace, we have preferred\r\nglancing briefly at some of the sublime truths which geometry has there\r\ndeposited. Let us not, however, apply this principle in its utmost\r\nrigour, and since chance has put into our hands some unpublished letters\r\nof one of those men of genius, whom nature has endowed with the rare\r\nfaculty of seizing at a glance the salient points of an object, we may\r\nbe permitted to extract from them two or three brief and characteristic\r\nappreciations of the _Mécanique Céleste_ and the _Traité des\r\nProbabilités_.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Vendemiaire in the year X., General Bonaparte, after having\r\nreceived a volume of the _Mécanique Céleste_, wrote to Laplace in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\"The first _six months_ which I shall have at my\r\ndisposal will be employed in reading your beautiful work.\" It would\r\nappear that the words, the first _six months_, deprive the phrase of the\r\ncharacter of a common-place expression of thanks, and convey a just\r\nappreciation of the importance and difficulty of the subject-matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th Frimaire in the year XI., the reading of some chapters of the\r\nvolume, which Laplace had dedicated to him, was to the general \"a new\r\noccasion for regretting, that the force of circumstances had directed\r\nhim into a career which removed him from the pursuit of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" added he, \"I have a strong desire that future\r\ngenerations, upon reading the _Mécanique Céleste_, shall not forget the\r\nesteem and friendship which I have entertained towards its author.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 17th Prairial in the year XIII., the general, now become emperor,\r\nwrote from Milan: \"The _Mécanique Céleste_ appears to me destined to\r\nshed new lustre on the age in which we live.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 12th of August, 1812, Napoleon, who had just received\r\nthe _Traité du Calcul des Probabilités_, wrote from Witepsk the letter\r\nwhich we transcribe textually:--\r\n\r\n\"There was a time when I would have read with interest your _Traité du\r\nCalcul des Probabilités_. For the present I must confine myself to\r\nexpressing to you the satisfaction which I experience every time that I\r\nsee you give to the world new works which serve to improve and extend\r\nthe most important of the sciences, and contribute to the glory of the\r\nnation. The advancement and the improvement of mathematical science are\r\nconnected with the prosperity of the state.\"\r\n\r\nI have now arrived at the conclusion of the task which I had imposed\r\nupon myself. I shall be pardoned for having given so detailed an\r\nexposition of the principal discoveries for which philosophy, astronomy,\r\nand navigation are indebted to our geometers.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared to me that in thus tracing the glorious past I have\r\nshown our contemporaries the full extent of their duty towards the\r\ncountry. In fact, it is for nations especially to bear in remembrance\r\nthe ancient adage: _noblesse obligé_!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] The author here refers to the series of biographies contained in\r\ntome III. of the _Notices Biographiques_.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[23] These celebrated laws, known in astronomy as the laws of Kepler,\r\nare three in number. The first law is, that the planets describe\r\nellipses around the sun in their common focus; the second, that a line\r\njoining the planet and the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal times;\r\nthe third, that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are\r\nproportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. The\r\nfirst two laws were discovered by Kepler in the course of a laborious\r\nexamination of the theory of the planet Mars; a full account of this\r\ninquiry is contained in his famous work _De Stella Martis_, published in\r\n1609. The discovery of the third law was not effected until, several\r\nyears afterwards, Kepler announced it to the world in his treatise on\r\nHarmonics (1628). The passage quoted below is extracted from that\r\nwork.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[24] The spheroidal figure of the earth was established by the\r\ncomparison of an arc of the meridian that had been measured in France,\r\nwith a similar arc measured in Lapland, from which it appeared that the\r\nlength of a degree of the meridian increases from the equator towards\r\nthe poles, conformably to what ought to result upon the supposition of\r\nthe earth having the figure of an oblate spheroid. The length of the\r\nLapland arc was determined by means of an expedition which the French\r\nGovernment had despatched to the North of Europe for that purpose. A\r\nsimilar expedition had been despatched from France about the same time\r\nto Peru in South America, for the purpose of measuring an arc of the\r\nmeridian under the equator, but the results had not been ascertained at\r\nthe time to which the author alludes in the text. The variation of\r\ngravity at the surface of the earth was established by Richer's\r\nexperiments with the pendulum at Cayenne, in South America (1673-4),\r\nfrom which it appeared that the pendulum oscillates more slowly--and\r\nconsequently the force of gravity is less intense--under the equator\r\nthan in the latitude of Paris.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[25] It may perhaps be asked why we place Lagrange among the French\r\ngeometers? This is our reply: It appears to us that the individual who\r\nwas named Lagrange Tournier, two of the most characteristic French names\r\nwhich it is possible to imagine, whose maternal grandfather was M. Gros,\r\nwhose paternal great-grandfather was a French officer, a native of\r\nParis, who never wrote except in French, and who was invested in our\r\ncountry with high honours during a period of nearly thirty years;--ought\r\nto be regarded as a Frenchman although born at Turin.--_Author_.\r\n\r\n[26] The problem of three bodies was solved independently about the same\r\ntime by Euler, D'Alembert, and Clairaut. The two last-mentioned\r\ngeometers communicated their solutions to the Academy of Sciences on the\r\nsame day, November 15, 1747. Euler had already in 1746 published tables\r\nof the moon, founded on his solution of the same problem, the details of\r\nwhich he subsequently published in 1753.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[27] It must be admitted that M. Arago has here imperfectly represented\r\nNewton's labours on the great problem of the precession of the\r\nequinoxes. The immortal author of the Principia did not merely\r\n_conjecture_ that the conical motion of the earth's axis is due to the\r\ndisturbing action of the sun and moon upon the matter accumulated around\r\nthe earth's equator: he _demonstrated_ by a very beautiful and\r\nsatisfactory process that the movement must necessarily arise from that\r\ncause; and although the means of investigation, in his time, were\r\ninadequate to a rigorous computation of the quantitative effect, still,\r\nhis researches on the subject have been always regarded as affording one\r\nof the most striking proofs of sagacity which is to be found in all his\r\nworks.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[28] It would appear that Hooke had conjectured that the figure of the\r\nearth might be spheroidal before Newton or Huyghens turned their\r\nattention to the subject. At a meeting of the Royal Society on the 28th\r\nof February, 1678, a discussion arose respecting the figure of Mercury\r\nwhich M. Gallet of Avignon had remarked to be oval on the occasion of\r\nthe planet's transit across the sun's disk on the 7th of November, 1677.\r\nHooke was inclined to suppose that the phenomenon was real, and that it\r\nwas due to the whirling of the planet on an axis \"which made it somewhat\r\nof the shape of a turnip, or of a solid made by an ellipsis turned round\r\nupon its shorter diameter.\" At the meeting of the Society on the 7th of\r\nMarch, the subject was again discussed. In reply to the objection\r\noffered to his hypothesis on the ground of the planet being a solid\r\nbody, Hooke remarked that \"although it might now be solid, yet that at\r\nthe beginning it might have been fluid enough to receive that shape; and\r\nthat although this supposition should not be granted, it would be\r\nprobable enough that it would really run into that shape and make the\r\nsame appearance; _and that it is not improbable but that the water here\r\nupon the earth might do it in some measure by the influence of the\r\ndiurnal motion, which, compounded with that of the moon, he conceived to\r\nbe the cause of the Tides_.\" (Journal Book of the Royal Society, vol.\r\nvi. p. 60.) Richer returned from Cayenne in the year 1674, but the\r\naccount of his observations with the pendulum during his residence\r\nthere, was not published until 1679, nor is there to be found any\r\nallusion to them during the intermediate interval, either in the volumes\r\nof the Academy of Sciences or any other publication. We have no means of\r\nascertaining how Newton was first induced to suppose that the figure of\r\nthe earth is spheroidal, but we know, upon his own authority, that as\r\nearly as the year 1667, or 1668, he was led to consider the effects of\r\nthe centrifugal force in diminishing the weight of bodies at the\r\nequator. With respect to Huyghens, he appears to have formed a\r\nconjecture respecting the spheroidal figure of the earth independently\r\nof Newton; but his method for computing the ellipticity is founded upon\r\nthat given in the Principia.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[29] Newton assumed that a homogeneous fluid mass of a spheroidal form\r\nwould be in equilibrium if it were endued with an adequate rotatory\r\nmotion and its constituent particles attracted each other in the inverse\r\nproportion of the square of the distance. Maclaurin first demonstrated\r\nthe truth of this theorem by a rigorous application of the ancient\r\ngeometry.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[30] The results of Clairaut's researches on the figure of the earth are\r\nmainly embodied in a remarkable theorem discovered by that geometer, and\r\nwhich may be enunciated thus:--_The sum of the fractions expressing the\r\nellipticity and the increase of gravity at the pole is equal to two and\r\na half times the fraction expressing the centrifugal force at the\r\nequator, the unit of force being represented by the force of gravity at\r\nthe equator._ This theorem is independent of any hypothesis with respect\r\nto the law of the densities of the successive strata of the earth. Now\r\nthe increase of gravity at the pole may be ascertained by means of\r\nobservations with the pendulum in different latitudes. Hence it is plain\r\nthat Clairaut's theorem furnishes a practical method for determining the\r\nvalue of the earth's ellipticity.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[31] The researches on the secular variations of the eccentricities and\r\ninclinations of the planetary orbits depend upon the solution of an\r\nalgebraic equation equal in degree to the number of planets whose mutual\r\naction is considered, and the coefficients of which involve the values\r\nof the masses of those bodies. It may be shown that if the roots of this\r\nequation be equal or imaginary, the corresponding element, whether the\r\neccentricity or the inclination, will increase indefinitely with the\r\ntime in the case of each planet; but that if the roots, on the other\r\nhand, be real and unequal, the value of the element will oscillate in\r\nevery instance within fixed limits. Laplace proved by a general\r\nanalysis, that the roots of the equation are real and unequal, whence it\r\nfollowed that neither the eccentricity nor the inclination will vary in\r\nany case to an indefinite extent. But it still remained uncertain,\r\nwhether the limits of oscillation were not in any instance so far apart\r\nthat the variation of the element (whether the eccentricity or the\r\ninclination) might lead to a complete destruction of the existing\r\nphysical condition of the planet. Laplace, indeed, attempted to prove,\r\nby means of two well-known theorems relative to the eccentricities and\r\ninclinations of the planetary orbits, that if those elements were once\r\nsmall, they would always remain so, provided the planets all revolved\r\naround the sun in one common direction and their masses were\r\ninconsiderable. It is to these theorems that M. Arago manifestly alludes\r\nin the text. Le Verrier and others have, however, remarked that they are\r\ninadequate to assure the permanence of the existing physical condition\r\nof several of the planets. In order to arrive at a definitive conclusion\r\non this subject, it is indispensable to have recourse to the actual\r\nsolution of the algebraic equation above referred to. This was the\r\ncourse adopted by the illustrious Lagrange in his researches on the\r\nsecular variations of the planetary orbits. (_Mem. Acad. Berlin_,\r\n1783-4.) Having investigated the values of the masses of the planets, he\r\nthen determined, by an approximate solution, the values of the several\r\nroots of the algebraic equation upon which the variations of the\r\neccentricities and inclinations of the orbits depended. In this way, he\r\nfound the limiting values of the eccentricity and inclination for the\r\norbit of each of the principal planets of the system. The results\r\nobtained by that great geometer have been mainly confirmed by the recent\r\nresearches of Le Verrier on the same subject. (_Connaissance des Temps_,\r\n1843.)--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[32] Laplace was originally led to consider the subject of the\r\nperturbations of the mean motions of the planets by his researches on\r\nthe theory of Jupiter and Saturn. Having computed the numerical value of\r\nthe secular inequality affecting the mean motion of each of those\r\nplanets, neglecting the terms of the fourth and higher orders relative\r\nto the eccentricities and inclinations, he found it to be so small that\r\nit might be regarded as totally insensible. Justly suspecting that this\r\ncircumstance was not attributable to the particular values of the\r\nelements of Jupiter and Saturn, he investigated the expression for the\r\nsecular perturbation of the mean motion by a general analysis,\r\nneglecting, as before, the fourth and higher powers of the\r\neccentricities and inclinations, and he found in this case, that the\r\nterms which were retained in the investigation absolutely destroyed each\r\nother, so that the expression was reduced to zero. In a memoir which he\r\ncommunicated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, in 1776, Lagrange first\r\nshowed that the mean distance (and consequently the mean motion) was not\r\naffected by any secular inequalities, no matter what were the\r\neccentricities or inclinations of the disturbing and disturbed\r\nplanets.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[33] Mr. Adams has recently detected a remarkable oversight committed by\r\nLaplace and his successors in the analytical investigation of the\r\nexpression for this inequality. The effect of the rectification rendered\r\nnecessary by the researches of Mr. Adams will be to diminish by about\r\none sixth the coefficient of the principal term of the secular\r\ninequality. This coefficient has for its multiplier the square of the\r\nnumber of centuries which have elapsed from a given epoch; its value was\r\nfound by Laplace to be 10\".18. Mr. Adams has ascertained that it must be\r\ndiminished by 1\".66. This result has recently been verified by the\r\nresearches of M. Plana. Its effect will be to alter in some degree the\r\ncalculations of ancient eclipses. The Astronomer Royal has stated in his\r\nlast Annual Report, to the Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory,\r\n(June 7, 1856,) that steps have recently been taken at the Observatory,\r\nfor calculating the various circumstances of those phenomena, upon the\r\nbasis of the more correct data furnished by the researches of Mr.\r\nAdams.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[34] [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this famous inequality may be best understood by reference\r\nto the mode in which the disturbing forces operate. Let P Q R, P' Q' R'\r\nrepresent the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, and let us suppose, for the\r\nsake of illustration, that they are both situate in the same plane. Let\r\nthe planets be in conjunction at P, P', and let them both be revolving\r\naround the sun S, in the direction represented by the arrows. Assuming\r\nthat the mean motion of Jupiter is to that of Saturn exactly in the\r\nproportion of five to two, it follows that when Jupiter has completed\r\none revolution, Saturn will have advanced through two fifths of a\r\nrevolution. Similarly, when Jupiter has completed a revolution and a\r\nhalf, Saturn will have effected three fifths of a revolution. Hence when\r\nJupiter arrives at T, Saturn will be a little in advance of T'. Let us\r\nsuppose that the two planets come again into conjunction at Q, Q'. It is\r\nplain that while Jupiter has completed one revolution, and, advanced\r\nthrough the angle P S Q (measured in the direction of the arrow), Saturn\r\nhas simply described around S the angle P' S' Q'. Hence the _excess_ of\r\nthe angle described around S, by Jupiter, over the angle similarly\r\ndescribed by Saturn, will amount to one complete revolution, or, 360°.\r\nBut since the mean motions of the two planets are in the proportion of\r\nfive to two, the angles described by them around S in any given time\r\nwill be in the same proportion, and therefore the _excess_ of the angle\r\ndescribed by Jupiter over that described by Saturn will be to the angle\r\ndescribed by Saturn in the proportion of three to two. But we have just\r\nfound that the excess of these two angles in the present case amounts to\r\n360°, and the angle described by Saturn is represented by P' S' Q';\r\nconsequently 360° is to the angle P' S' Q' in the proportion of three to\r\ntwo, in other words P' S' Q' is equal to two thirds of the circumference\r\nor 240°. In the same way it may be shown that the two planets will come\r\ninto conjunction again at R, when Saturn has described another arc of\r\n240°. Finally, when Saturn has advanced through a third arc of 240°, the\r\ntwo planets will come into conjunction at P, P', the points whence they\r\noriginally set out; and the two succeeding conjunctions will also\r\nmanifestly occur at Q, Q' and R, R'. Thus we see, that the conjunctions\r\nwill always occur in three given points of the orbit of each planet\r\nsituate at angular distances of 120° from each other. It is also\r\nobvious, that during the interval which elapses between the occurrence\r\nof two conjunctions in the same points of the orbits, and which includes\r\nthree synodic revolutions of the planets, Jupiter will have accomplished\r\nfive revolutions around the sun, and Saturn will have accomplished two\r\nrevolutions. Now if the orbits of both planets were perfectly circular,\r\nthe retarding and accelerating effects of the disturbing force of either\r\nplanet would neutralize each other in the course of a synodic\r\nrevolution, and therefore both planets would return to the same\r\ncondition at each successive conjunction. But in consequence of the\r\nellipticity of the orbits, the retarding effect of the disturbing force\r\nis manifestly no longer exactly compensated by the accelerative effect,\r\nand hence at the close of each synodic revolution, there remains a\r\nminute outstanding alteration in the movement of each planet. A similar\r\neffect will he produced at each of the three points of conjunction; and\r\nas the perturbations which thus ensue do not generally compensate each\r\nother, there will remain a minute outstanding perturbation as the result\r\nof every three conjunctions. The effect produced being of the same kind\r\n(whether tending to accelerate or retard the movement of the planet) for\r\nevery such triple conjunction, it is plain that the action of the\r\ndisturbing forces would ultimately lead to a serious derangement of the\r\nmovements of both planets. All this is founded on the supposition that\r\nthe mean motions of the two planets are to each other as two to five;\r\nbut in reality, this relation does not exactly hold. In fact while\r\nJupiter requires 21,663 days to accomplish five revolutions, Saturn\r\neffects two revolutions in 21,518 days. Hence when Jupiter, after\r\ncompleting his fifth revolution, arrives at P, Saturn will have advanced\r\na little beyond P', and the conjunction of the two planets will occur at\r\nP, P' when they have both described around S an additional arc of about\r\n8°. In the same way it may be shown that the two succeeding conjunctions\r\nwill take place at the points _q, q', r, r'_ respectively 8° in advance\r\nof Q, Q', R, R'. Thus we see that the points of conjunction will travel\r\nwith extreme slowness in the same direction as that in which the planets\r\nrevolve. Now since the angular distance between P and R is 120°, and\r\nsince in a period of three synodic revolutions or 21,758 days, the line\r\nof conjunction travels through an arc of 8°, it follows that in 892\r\nyears the conjunction of the two planets will have advanced from P, P'\r\nto R, R'. In reality, the time of travelling from P, P' to R, R' is\r\nsomewhat longer from the indirect effects of planetary perturbation,\r\namounting to 920 years. In an equal period of time the conjunction of\r\nthe two planets will advance from Q, Q' to R, R' and from R, R' to P,\r\nP'. During the half of this period the perturbative effect resulting\r\nfrom every triple conjunction will lie constantly in one direction, and\r\nduring the other half it will lie in the contrary direction; that is to\r\nsay, during a period of 460 years the mean motion of the disturbed\r\nplanet will be continually accelerated, and, in like manner, during an\r\nequal period it will be continually retarded. In the case of Jupiter\r\ndisturbed by Saturn, the inequality in longitude amounts at its maximum\r\nto 21'; in the converse case of Saturn disturbed by Jupiter, the\r\ninequality is more considerable in consequence of the greater mass of\r\nthe disturbing planet, amounting at its maximum to 49'. In accordance\r\nwith the mechanical principle of the equality of action and reaction, it\r\nhappens that while the mean motion of one planet is increasing, that of\r\nthe other is diminishing, and _vice versâ_. We have supposed that the\r\norbits of both planets are situate in the same plane. In reality,\r\nhowever, they are inclined to each other, and this circumstance will\r\nproduce an effect exactly analogous to that depending on the\r\neccentricities of the orbits. It is plain that the more nearly the mean\r\nmotions of the two planets approach a relation of commensurability, the\r\nsmaller will be the displacement of every third conjunction, and\r\nconsequently the longer will be the duration, and the greater the\r\nultimate accumulation, of the inequality.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[35] The utility of observations of the transits of the inferior planets\r\nfor determining the solar parallax, was first pointed out by James\r\nGregory (_Optica Promota_, 1663).--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[36] Mayer, from the principles of gravitation (_Theoria Lunæ_, 1767),\r\ncomputed the value of the solar parallax to be 7\".8. He remarked that\r\nthe error of this determination did not amount to one twentieth of the\r\nwhole, whence it followed that the true value of the parallax could not\r\nexceed 8\".2. Laplace, by an analogous process, determined the parallax\r\nto be 8\".45. Encke, by a profound discussion of the observations of the\r\ntransits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, found the value of the same element\r\nto be 8\".5776.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[37] The theoretical researches of Laplace formed the basis of\r\nBurckhardt's Lunar Tables, which are chiefly employed in computing the\r\nplaces of the moon for the Nautical Almanac and other Ephemerides. These\r\ntables were defaced by an empiric equation, suggested for the purpose of\r\nrepresenting an inequality of long period which seemed to affect the\r\nmean longitude of the moon. No satisfactory explanation of the origin of\r\nthis inequality could be discovered by any geometer, although it formed\r\nthe subject of much toilsome investigation throughout the present\r\ncentury, until at length M. Hansen found it to arise from a combination\r\nof two inequalities due to the disturbing action of Venus. The period of\r\none of these inequalities is 273 years, and that of the other is 239\r\nyears. The maximum value of the former is 27\".4, and that of the latter\r\nis 23\".2.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[38] This law is necessarily included in the law already enunciated by\r\nthe author relative to the mean longitudes. The following is the most\r\nusual mode of expressing these curious relations: 1st, the mean motion\r\nof the first satellite, plus twice the mean motion of the third, minus\r\nthree times the mean motion of the second, is rigorously equal to zero;\r\n2d, the mean longitude of the first satellite, plus twice the mean\r\nlongitude of the third, minus three times the mean longitude of the\r\nsecond, is equal to 180°. It is plain that if we only consider the mean\r\nlongitude here to refer to a _given epoch_, the combination of the two\r\nlaws will assure the existence of an analogous relation between the mean\r\nlongitudes _for any instant of time whatever_, whether past or future.\r\nLaplace has shown, as the author has stated in the text, that if these\r\nrelations had only been approximately true at the origin, the mutual\r\nattraction of the three satellites would have ultimately rendered them\r\nrigorously so; under such circumstances, the mean longitude of the first\r\nsatellite, plus twice the mean longitude of the third, minus three times\r\nthe mean longitude of the second, would continually oscillate about 180°\r\nas a mean value. The three satellites would participate in this\r\nlibratory movement, the extent of oscillation depending in each case on\r\nthe mass of the satellite and its distance from the primary, but the\r\nperiod of libration is the same for all the satellites, amounting to\r\n2,270 days 18 hours, or rather more than six years. Observations of the\r\neclipses of the satellites have not afforded any indications of the\r\nactual existence of such a libratory motion, so that the relations\r\nbetween the mean motions and mean longitudes may be presumed to be\r\nalways rigorously true.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n[39] Laplace has explained this theory in his _Exposition du Système du\r\nMonde_ (liv. iv. note vii.).--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.)\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF NOTICE OF SOME OTHER INTERESTING RESULTS OF THE\r\nRESEARCHES OF LAPLACE WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Method for determining the orbits of comets._--Since comets are\r\ngenerally visible only during a few days or weeks at the utmost, the\r\ndetermination of their orbits is attended with peculiar difficulties.\r\nThe method devised by Newton for effecting this object was in every\r\nrespect worthy of his genius. Its practical value was illustrated by the\r\nbrilliant researches of Halley on cometary orbits. It necessitated,\r\nhowever, a long train of tedious calculations, and, in consequence, was\r\nnot much used, astronomers generally preferring to attain the same end\r\nby a tentative process. In the year 1780, Laplace communicated to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences an analytical method for determining the elements of\r\na comet's orbit. This method has been extensively employed in France.\r\nIndeed, previously to the appearance of Olber's method, about the close\r\nof the last century, it furnished the easiest and most expeditious\r\nprocess hitherto devised, for calculating the parabolic elements of a\r\ncomet's orbit.\r\n\r\n_Invariable plane of the solar system._--In consequence of the mutual\r\nperturbations of the different bodies of the planetary system, the\r\nplanes of the orbits in which they revolve are perpetually varying in\r\nposition. It becomes therefore desirable to ascertain some fixed plane\r\nto which the movements of the planets in all ages may be referred, so\r\nthat the observations of one epoch might be rendered readily comparable\r\nwith those of another. This object was accomplished by Laplace, who\r\ndiscovered that notwithstanding the perpetual fluctuations of the\r\nplanetary orbits, there exists a fixed plane, to which the positions of\r\nthe various bodies may at any instant be easily referred. This plane\r\npasses through the centre of gravity of the solar system, and its\r\nposition is such, that if the movements of the planets be projected upon\r\nit, and if the mass of each planet be multiplied by the area which it\r\ndescribes in a given time, the sum of such products will be a maximum.\r\nThe position of the plane for the year 1750 has been calculated by\r\nreferring it to the ecliptic of that year. In this way it has been found\r\nthat the inclination of the plane is 1° 35' 31\", and that the longitude\r\nof the ascending node is 102° 57' 30\". The position of the plane when\r\ncalculated for the year 1950, with respect to the ecliptic of 1750,\r\ngives 1° 35' 31\" for the inclination, and 102° 57' 15\" for the longitude\r\nof the ascending node. It will be seen that a very satisfactory\r\naccordance exists between the elements of the position of the invariable\r\nplane for the two epochs.\r\n\r\n_Diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic._--The astronomers of the\r\neighteenth century had found, by a comparison of ancient with modern\r\nobservations, that the obliquity of the ecliptic is slowly diminishing\r\nfrom century to century. The researches of geometers on the theory of\r\ngravitation had shown that an effect of this kind must be produced by\r\nthe disturbing action of the planets on the earth. Laplace determined\r\nthe secular displacement of the plane of the earth's orbit due to each\r\nof the planets, and in this way ascertained the whole effect of\r\nperturbation upon the obliquity of the ecliptic. A comparison which he\r\ninstituted between the results of his formula and an ancient observation\r\nrecorded in the Chinese Annals exhibited a most satisfactory accordance.\r\nThe observation in question indicated the obliquity of the ecliptic for\r\nthe year 1100 before the Christian era, to be 23° 54' 2\".5. According to\r\nthe principles of the theory of gravitation, the obliquity for the same\r\nepoch would be 23° 51' 30\".\r\n\r\n_Limits of the obliquity of the ecliptic modified by the action of the\r\nsun and moon upon the terrestrial spheroid._--The ecliptic will not\r\ncontinue indefinitely to approach the equator. After attaining a certain\r\nlimit it will then vary in the opposite direction, and the obliquity\r\nwill continually increase in like manner as it previously diminished.\r\nFinally, the inclination of the equator and the ecliptic will attain a\r\ncertain maximum value, and then the obliquity will again diminish. Thus\r\nthe angle contained between the two planes will perpetually oscillate\r\nwithin certain limits. The extent of variation is inconsiderable.\r\nLaplace found that, in consequence of the spheroidal figure of the\r\nearth, it is even less than it would otherwise have been. This will be\r\nreadily understood, when we state that the disturbing action of the sun\r\nand moon upon the terrestrial spheroid produces an oscillation of the\r\nearth's axis which occasions a periodic variation of the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic. Now, as the plane of the ecliptic approaches the equator,\r\nthe mean disturbing action of the sun and moon upon the redundant matter\r\naccumulated around the latter will undergo a corresponding variation,\r\nand hence will arise an inconceivably slow movement of the plane of the\r\nequator, which will necessarily affect the obliquity of the ecliptic.\r\nLaplace found that if it were not for this cause, the obliquity of the\r\necliptic would oscillate to the extent of 4° 53' 33\" on each side of a\r\nmean value, but that when the movements of both planes are taken into\r\naccount, the extent of oscillation is reduced to 1° 33' 45\".\r\n\r\n_Variation of the length of the tropical year._--The disturbing action\r\nof the sun and moon upon the terrestrial spheroid occasions a continual\r\n_regression_ of the equinoctial points, and hence arises the distinction\r\nbetween the sidereal and tropical year. The effect is modified in a\r\nsmall degree by the variation of the plane of the ecliptic, which tends\r\nto produce a _progression_ of the equinoxes. If the movement of the\r\nequinoctial points arising from these combined causes was uniform, the\r\nlength of the tropical year would be manifestly invariable. Theory,\r\nhowever, indicates that for ages past the rate of regression has been\r\nslowly increasing, and, consequently, the length of the tropical year\r\nhas been gradually diminishing. The rate of diminution is exceedingly\r\nsmall. Laplace found that it amounts to somewhat less than half a second\r\nin a century. Consequently, the length of the tropical year is now about\r\nten seconds less than it was in the time of Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n_Limits of variation of the tropical year modified by the disturbing\r\naction of the sun and moon upon the terrestrial spheroid._--The tropical\r\nyear will not continue indefinitely to diminish in length. When it has\r\nonce attained a certain minimum value, it will then increase until\r\nfinally having attained an extreme value in the opposite direction, it\r\nwill again begin to diminish, and thus it will perpetually oscillate\r\nbetween certain fixed limits. Laplace found that the extent to which the\r\ntropical year is liable to vary from this cause, amounts to thirty-eight\r\nseconds. If it were not for the effect produced upon the inclination of\r\nthe equator to the ecliptic by the mean disturbing action of the sun and\r\nmoon upon the terrestrial spheroid, the extent of variation would amount\r\nto 162 seconds.\r\n\r\n_Motion of the perihelion of the terrestrial orbit._--The major axis of\r\nthe orbit of each planet is in a state of continual movement from the\r\ndisturbing action of the other planets. In some cases, it makes the\r\ncomplete tour of the heavens; in others, it merely oscillates around a\r\nmean position. In the case of the earth's orbit, the perihelion is\r\nslowly advancing in the same direction as that in which all the planets\r\nare revolving around the sun. The alteration of its position with\r\nrespect to the stars amounts to about 11\" in a year, but since the\r\nequinox is regressing in the opposite direction at the rate of 50\" in a\r\nyear, the whole annual variation of the longitude of the terrestrial\r\nperihelion amounts to 61\". Laplace has considered two remarkable epochs\r\nin connection with this fact; viz: the epoch at which the major axis of\r\nthe earth's orbit coincided with the line of the equinoxes, and the\r\nepoch at which it stood perpendicular to that line. By calculation, he\r\nfound the former of these epochs to be referable to the year 4107,\r\nB.C., and the latter to the year 1245, A.D. He accordingly suggested\r\nthat the latter should be used as a universal epoch for the regulation\r\nof chronological occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.)\r\n\r\nThe _Mécanique Céleste_.--This stupendous monument of intellectual\r\nresearch consists, as stated by the author, of five quarto volumes. The\r\nsubject-matter is divided into sixteen books, and each book again is\r\nsubdivided into several chapters. Vol. I. contains the first and second\r\nbooks of the work; Vol. II. contains the third, fourth, and fifth books;\r\nVol. III. contains the sixth and seventh books; Vol. IV. contains the\r\neighth, ninth, and tenth books; and, finally, Vol. V. contains the\r\nremaining six books. In the first book the author treats of the general\r\nlaws of equilibrium and motion. In the second book he treats of the law\r\nof gravitation, and the movements of the centres of gravity of the\r\ncelestial bodies. In the third book he investigates the subject of the\r\nfigures of the celestial bodies. In the fourth book he considers the\r\noscillations of the ocean and the atmosphere, arising from the\r\ndisturbing action of the celestial bodies. The fifth book is devoted to\r\nthe investigation of the movements of the celestial bodies around their\r\ncentres of gravity. In this book the author gives a solution of the\r\ngreat problems of the precession of the equinoxes and the libration of\r\nthe moon, and determines the conditions upon which the stability of\r\nSaturn's ring depends. The sixth book is devoted to the theory of the\r\nplanetary movements; the seventh, to the lunar theory; the eighth, to\r\nthe theory of the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; and the\r\nninth, to the theory of comets. In the tenth book the author\r\ninvestigates various subjects relating to the system of the universe.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned the theory of astronomical refractions;\r\nthe determination of heights by the barometer; the investigation of the\r\neffects produced on the movements of the planets and comets by a\r\nresisting medium; and the determination of the values of the masses of\r\nthe planets and satellites. In the six books forming the fifth volume of\r\nthe work, the author, besides presenting his readers with an historical\r\nexposition of the labours of Newton and his successors on the theory of\r\ngravitation, gives an account of various researches relative to the\r\nsystem of the universe, which had occupied his attention subsequently to\r\nthe publication of the previous volumes. In the eleventh book he\r\nconsiders the subjects of the figure and rotation of the earth. In the\r\ntwelfth book he investigates the attraction and repulsion of spheres,\r\nand the laws of equilibrium and motion of elastic fluids. The thirteenth\r\nbook is devoted to researches on the oscillations of the fluids which\r\ncover the surfaces of the planets; the fourteenth, to the subject of the\r\nmovements of the celestial bodies around their centres of gravity; the\r\nfifteenth, to the movements of the planets and comets; and the\r\nsixteenth, to the movements of the satellites. The author published a\r\nsupplement to the third volume, containing the results of certain\r\nresearches on the planetary theory, and a supplement to the tenth book,\r\nin which he investigates very fully the theory of capillary attraction.\r\nThere was also published a posthumous supplement to the fifth volume,\r\nthe manuscript of which was found among his papers after his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH FOURIER.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY READ AT A PUBLIC ASSEMBLY OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, ON THE\r\n18TH OF NOVEMBER, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen,--In former times one academician differed from another only\r\nin the number, the nature, and the brilliancy of his discoveries. Their\r\nlives, thrown in some respects into the same mould, consisted of events\r\nlittle worthy of remark. A boyhood more or less studious; progress\r\nsometimes slow, sometimes rapid; inclinations thwarted by capricious or\r\nshortsighted parents; inadequacy of means, the privations which it\r\nintroduces in its train; thirty years of a laborious professorship and\r\ndifficult studies,--such were the elements from which the admirable\r\ntalents of the early secretaries of the Academy were enabled to execute\r\nthose portraits, so piquant, so lively, and so varied, which form one of\r\nthe principal ornaments of your learned collections.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, biographies are less confined in their object. The\r\nconvulsions which France has experienced in emancipating herself from\r\nthe swaddling-clothes of routine, of superstition and of privilege, have\r\ncast into the storms of political life citizens of all ages, of all\r\nconditions, and of all characters. Thus has the Academy of Sciences\r\nfigured during forty years in the devouring arena, wherein might and\r\nright have alternately seized the supreme power by a glorious sacrifice\r\nof combatants and victims!\r\n\r\nRecall to mind, for example, the immortal National Assembly. You will\r\nfind at its head a modest academician, a patern of all the private\r\nvirtues, the unfortunate Bailly, who, in the different phases of his\r\npolitical life, knew how to reconcile a passionate affection for his\r\ncountry with a moderation which his most cruel enemies themselves have\r\nbeen compelled to admire.\r\n\r\nWhen, at a later period, coalesced Europe launched against France a\r\nmillion of soldiers; when it became necessary to organize for the crisis\r\nfourteen armies, it was the ingenious author of the _Essai sur les\r\nMachines_ and of the _Géométrie des Positions_ who directed this\r\ngigantic operation. It was, again, Carnot, our honourable colleague, who\r\npresided over the incomparable campaign of seventeen months, during\r\nwhich French troops, novices in the profession of arms, gained eight\r\npitched battles, were victorious in one hundred and forty combats,\r\noccupied one hundred and sixteen fortified places and two hundred and\r\nthirty forts or redoubts, enriched our arsenals with four thousand\r\ncannon and seventy thousand muskets, took a hundred thousand prisoners,\r\nand adorned the dome of the Invalides with ninety flags. During the same\r\ntime the Chaptals, the Fourcroys, the Monges, the Berthollets rushed\r\nalso to the defence of French independence, some of them extracting from\r\nour soil, by prodigies of industry, the very last atoms of saltpetre\r\nwhich it contained; others transforming, by the aid of new and rapid\r\nmethods, the bells of the towns, villages, and smallest hamlets into a\r\nformidable artillery, which our enemies supposed, as indeed they had a\r\nright to suppose, we were deprived of. At the voice of his country in\r\ndanger, another academician, the young and learned Meunier, readily\r\nrenounced the seductive pursuits of the laboratory; he went to\r\ndistinguish himself upon the ramparts of Königstein, to contribute as a\r\nhero to the long defence of Mayence, and met his death, at the age of\r\nforty years only, after having attained the highest position in a\r\ngarrison wherein shone the Aubert-Dubayets, the Beaupuys, the Haxos, the\r\nKlebers.\r\n\r\nHow could I forget here the last secretary of the original Academy?\r\nFollow him into a celebrated Assembly, into that Convention, the\r\nsanguinary delirium of which we might almost be inclined to pardon, when\r\nwe call to mind how gloriously terrible it was to the enemies of our\r\nindependence, and you will always see the illustrious Condorcet occupied\r\nexclusively with the great interests of reason and humanity. You will\r\nhear him denounce the shameful brigandage which for two centuries laid\r\nwaste the African continent by a system of corruption; demand in a tone\r\nof profound conviction that the Code be purified of the frightful stain\r\nof capital punishment, which renders the error of the judge for ever\r\nirreparable. He is the official organ of the Assembly on every occasion\r\nwhen it is necessary to address soldiers, citizens, political parties,\r\nor foreign nations in language worthy of France; he is not the tactician\r\nof any party, he incessantly entreats all of them to occupy their\r\nattention less with their own interests and a little more with public\r\nmatters; he replies, finally, to unjust reproaches of weakness by acts\r\nwhich leave him the only alternative of the poison cup or the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution thus threw the learned geometer, whose discoveries\r\nI am about to celebrate, far away from the route which destiny appeared\r\nto have traced out for him. In ordinary times it would be about Dom[40]\r\nJoseph Fourier that the secretary of the Academy would have deemed it\r\nhis duty to have occupied your attention. It would be the tranquil, the\r\nretired life of a Benedictine which he would have unfolded to you. The\r\nlife of our colleague, on the contrary, will be agitated and full of\r\nperils; it will pass into the fierce contentions of the forum and amid\r\nthe hazards of war; it will be a prey to all the anxieties which\r\naccompany a difficult administration. We shall find this life intimately\r\nassociated with the great events of our age. Let us hasten to add, that\r\nit will be always worthy and honourable, and that the personal qualities\r\nof the man of science will enhance the brilliancy of his discoveries.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[40] An abbreviation of Dominus, equivalent to the English prefix\r\nReverend.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF FOURIER.--HIS YOUTH.\r\n\r\nFourier was born at Auxerre on the 21st of March, 1768. His father, like\r\nthat of the illustrious geometer Lambert, was a tailor. This\r\ncircumstance would formerly have occupied a large place in the _éloge_\r\nof our learned colleague; thanks to the progress of enlightened ideas, I\r\nmay mention the circumstance as a fact of no importance: nobody, in\r\neffect, thinks in the present day, nobody even pretends to think, that\r\ngenius is the privilege of rank or fortune.\r\n\r\nFourier became an orphan at the age of eight years. A lady who had\r\nremarked the amiability of his manners and his precocious natural\r\nabilities, recommended him to the Bishop of Auxerre. Through the\r\ninfluence of this prelate, Fourier was admitted into the military school\r\nwhich was conducted at that time by the Benedictines of the Convent of\r\nSt. Mark. There he prosecuted his literary studies with surprising\r\nrapidity and success. Many sermons very much applauded at Paris in the\r\nmouth of high dignitaries of the Church were emanations from the pen of\r\nthe schoolboy of twelve years of age. It would be impossible in the\r\npresent day to trace those first compositions of the youth Fourier,\r\nsince, while divulging the plagiarism, he had the discretion never to\r\nname those who profited by it.\r\n\r\nAt thirteen years Fourier had the petulance, the noisy vivacity of most\r\nyoung people of the same age; but his character changed all at once, and\r\nas if by enchantment, as soon as he was initiated in the first\r\nprinciples of mathematics, that is to say, as soon as he became sensible\r\nof his real vocation. The hours prescribed for study no longer sufficed\r\nto gratify his insatiable curiosity. Ends of candles carefully collected\r\nin the kitchen, the corridors and the refectory of the college, and\r\nplaced on a hearth concealed by a screen, served during the night to\r\nilluminate the solitary studies by which Fourier prepared himself for\r\nthose labours which were destined, a few years afterwards, to adorn his\r\nname and his country.\r\n\r\nIn a military school directed by monks, the minds of the pupils\r\nnecessarily waver only between two careers in life--the church and the\r\nsword. Like Descartes, Fourier wished to be a soldier; like that\r\nphilosopher, he would doubtless have found the life of a garrison very\r\nwearisome. But he was not permitted to make the experiment. His demand\r\nto undergo the examination for the artillery, although strongly\r\nsupported by our illustrious colleague Legendre, was rejected with a\r\nseverity of expression of which you may judge yourselves: \"Fourier,\"\r\nreplied the minister, \"not being noble, could not enter the artillery,\r\nalthough he were a second Newton.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, there is in the strict enforcement of regulations, even when\r\nthey are most absurd, something respectable which I have a pleasure in\r\nrecognizing; in the present instance nothing could soften the odious\r\ncharacter of the minister's words. It is not true in reality that no one\r\ncould formerly enter into the artillery who did not possess a title of\r\nnobility; a certain fortune frequently supplied the want of parchments.\r\nThus it was not a something undefinable, which, by the way, our\r\nancestors the Franks had not yet invented, that was wanting to young\r\nFourier, but rather an income of a few hundred livres, which the men who\r\nwere then placed at the head of the country would have refused to\r\nacknowledge the genius of Newton as a just equivalent for! Treasure up\r\nthese facts, Gentlemen; they form an admirable illustration of the\r\nimmense advances which France has made during the last forty years.\r\nPosterity, moreover, will see in this, not the excuse, but the\r\nexplanation of some of those sanguinary dissensions which stained our\r\nfirst revolution.\r\n\r\nFourier not having been enabled to gird on the sword, assumed the habit\r\nof a Benedictine, and repaired to the Abbey of St. Benoît-sur-Loire,\r\nwhere he intended to pass the period of his noviciate. He had not yet\r\ntaken any vows when, in 1789, every mind was captivated with beautifully\r\nseductive ideas relative to the social regeneration of France. Fourier\r\nnow renounced the profession of the Church; but this circumstance did\r\nnot prevent his former masters from appointing him to the principal\r\nchair of mathematics in the Military School of Auxerre, and bestowing\r\nupon him numerous tokens of a lively and sincere affection. I venture to\r\nassert that no event in the life of our colleague affords a more\r\nstriking proof of the goodness of his natural disposition and the\r\namiability of his manners. It would be necessary not to know the human\r\nheart to suppose that the monks of St. Benoît did not feel some chagrin\r\nupon finding themselves so abruptly abandoned, to imagine especially\r\nthat they should give up without lively regret the glory which the order\r\nmight have expected from the ingenious colleague who had just escaped\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nFourier responded worthily to the confidence of which he had just become\r\nthe object. When his colleagues were indisposed, the titular professor\r\nof mathematics occupied in turns the chairs of rhetoric, of history, and\r\nof philosophy; and whatever might be the subject of his lectures, he\r\ndiffused among an audience which listened to him with delight, the\r\ntreasures of a varied and profound erudition, adorned with all the\r\nbrilliancy which the most elegant diction could impart to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIR ON THE RESOLUTION OF NUMERICAL EQUATIONS.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the year 1789 Fourier repaired to Paris and read\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences a memoir on the resolution of numerical\r\nequations of all degrees. This work of his early youth our colleague, so\r\nto speak, never lost sight of. He explained it at Paris to the pupils of\r\nthe Polytechnic School; he developed it upon the banks of the Nile in\r\npresence of the Institute of Egypt; at Grenoble, from the year 1802, it\r\nwas his favourite subject of conversation with the Professors of the\r\nCentral School and of the Faculty of Sciences; this finally, contained\r\nthe elements of the work which Fourier was engaged in seeing through the\r\npress when death put an end to his career.\r\n\r\nA scientific subject does not occupy so much space in the life of a man\r\nof science of the first rank without being important and difficult. The\r\nsubject of algebraic analysis above mentioned, which Fourier had studied\r\nwith a perseverance so remarkable, is not an exception to this rule. It\r\noffers itself in a great number of applications of calculation to the\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies, or to the physics of terrestrial\r\nbodies, and in general in the problems which lead to equations of a high\r\ndegree. As soon as he wishes to quit the domain of abstract relations,\r\nthe calculator has occasion to employ the roots of these equations; thus\r\nthe art of discovering them by the aid of an uniform method, either\r\nexactly or by approximation, did not fail at an early period to excite\r\nthe attention of geometers.\r\n\r\nAn observant eye perceives already some traces of their efforts in the\r\nwritings of the mathematicians of the Alexandrian School. These traces,\r\nit must be _acknowledged_, are so slight and so imperfect, that we\r\nshould truly be justified in referring the origin of this branch of\r\nanalysis only to the excellent labours of our countryman Vieta.\r\nDescartes, to whom we render very imperfect justice when we content\r\nourselves with saying that he taught us much when he taught us to doubt,\r\noccupied his attention also for a short time with this problem, and left\r\nupon it the indelible impress of his powerful mind. Hudde gave for a\r\nparticular but very important case rules to which nothing has since been\r\nadded; Rolle, of the Academy of Sciences, devoted to this one subject\r\nhis entire life. Among our neighbours on the other side of the channel,\r\nHarriot, Newton, Maclaurin, Stirling, Waring, I may say all the\r\nillustrious geometers which England produced in the last century, made\r\nit also the subject of their researches. Some years afterwards the names\r\nof Daniel Barnoulli, of Euler, and of Fontaine came to be added to so\r\nmany great names. Finally, Lagrange in his turn embarked in the same\r\ncareer, and at the very commencement of his researches he succeeded in\r\nsubstituting for the imperfect, although very ingenious, essays of his\r\npredecessors, a complete method which was free from every objection.\r\nFrom that instant the dignity of science was satisfied; but in such a\r\ncase it would not be permitted to say with the poet:\r\n\r\n     \"Le temps ne fait rien à l'affaire.\"\r\n\r\nNow although the processes invented by Lagrange, simple in principle and\r\napplicable to every case, have theoretically the merit of leading to the\r\nresult with certainty, still, on the other hand, they demand\r\ncalculations of a most repulsive length. It remained then to perfect the\r\npractical part of the question; it was necessary to devise the means of\r\nshortening the route without depriving it in any degree of its\r\ncertainty. Such was the principal object of the researches of Fourier,\r\nand this he has attained to a great extent.\r\n\r\nDescartes had already found, in the order according to which the signs\r\nof the different terms of any numerical equation whatever succeed each\r\nother, the means of deciding, for example, how many real positive roots\r\nthis equation may have. Fourier advanced a step further; he discovered a\r\nmethod for determining what number of the equally positive roots of\r\nevery equation may be found included between two given quantities. Here\r\ncertain calculations become necessary, but they are very simple, and\r\nwhatever be the precision desired, they lead without any trouble to the\r\nsolutions sought for.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether it were possible to cite a single scientific discovery\r\nof any importance which has not excited discussions of priority. The new\r\nmethod of Fourier for solving numerical equations is in this respect\r\namply comprised within the common law. We ought, however, to acknowledge\r\nthat the theorem which serves as the basis of this method, was first\r\npublished by M. Budan; that according to a rule which the principal\r\nAcademies of Europe have solemnly sanctioned, and from which the\r\nhistorian of the sciences dares not deviate without falling into\r\narbitrary assumptions and confusion, M. Budan ought to be considered as\r\nthe inventor. I will assert with equal assurance that it would be\r\nimpossible to refuse to Fourier the merit of having attained the same\r\nobject by his own efforts. I even regret that, in order to establish\r\nrights which nobody has contested, he deemed it necessary to have\r\nrecourse to the certificates of early pupils of the Polytechnic School,\r\nor Professors of the University. Since our colleague had the modesty to\r\nsuppose that his simple declaration would not be sufficient, why (and\r\nthe argument would have had much weight) did he not remark in what\r\nrespect his demonstration differed from that of his competitor?--an\r\nadmirable demonstration, in effect, and one so impregnated with the\r\nelements of the question, that a young geometer, M. Sturm, has just\r\nemployed it to establish the truth of the beautiful theorem by the aid\r\nof which he determines not the simple limits, but the exact number of\r\nroots of any equation whatever which are comprised between two given\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART PLAYED BY FOURIER IN OUR REVOLUTION.--HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE CORPS\r\nOF PROFESSORS OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL AND THE POLYTECHNIC\r\nSCHOOL.--EXPEDITION TO EGYPT.\r\n\r\nWe had just left Fourier at Paris, submitting to the Academy of Sciences\r\nthe analytical memoir of which I have just given a general view. Upon\r\nhis return to Auxerre, the young geometer found the town, the\r\nsurrounding country, and even the school to which he belonged, occupied\r\nintensely with the great questions relative to the dignity of human\r\nnature, philosophy, and politics, which were then discussed by the\r\norators of the different parties of the National Assembly. Fourier\r\nabandoned himself also to this movement of the human mind. He embraced\r\nwith enthusiasm the principles of the Revolution, and he ardently\r\nassociated himself with every thing grand, just, and generous which the\r\npopular impulse offered. His patriotism made him accept the most\r\ndifficult missions. We may assert, that never, even when his life was at\r\nstake, did he truckle to the base, covetous, and sanguinary passions\r\nwhich displayed themselves on all sides.\r\n\r\nA member of the popular society of Auxerre, Fourier exercised there an\r\nalmost irresistible ascendency. One day--all Burgundy has preserved the\r\nremembrance of it--on the occasion of a levy of three hundred thousand\r\nmen, he made the words honour, country, glory, ring so eloquently, he\r\ninduced so many voluntary enrolments, that the ballot was not deemed\r\nnecessary. At the command of the orator the contingent assigned to the\r\nchief town of the Yonne formed in order, assembled together within the\r\nvery enclosure of the Assembly, and marched forthwith to the frontier.\r\nUnfortunately these struggles of the forum, in which so many noble lives\r\nthen exercised themselves, were far from having always a real\r\nimportance. Ridiculous, absurd, and burlesque motions injured\r\nincessantly the inspirations of a pure, sincere, and enlightened\r\npatriotism. The popular society of Auxerre would furnish us, in case of\r\nnecessity, with more than one example of those lamentable contrasts.\r\nThus I might say that in the very same apartment wherein Fourier knew\r\nhow to excite the honourable sentiments which I have with pleasure\r\nrecalled to mind, he had on another occasion to contend with a certain\r\norator, perhaps of good intentions, but assuredly a bad astronomer, who,\r\nwishing to escape, said he, from _the good pleasure_ of municipal\r\nrulers, proposed that the names of the north, east, south, and west\r\nquarters should be assigned by lot to the different parts of the town of\r\nAuxerre.\r\n\r\nLiterature, the fine arts, and the sciences appeared for a moment to\r\nflourish under the auspicious influence of the French Revolution.\r\nObserve, for example, with what grandeur of conception the reformation\r\nof weights and measures was planned; what geometers, what astronomers,\r\nwhat eminent philosophers presided over every department of this noble\r\nundertaking! Alas! frightful revolutions in the interior of the country\r\nsoon saddened this magnificent spectacle. The sciences could not prosper\r\nin the midst of the desperate contest of factions. They would have\r\nblushed to owe any obligations to the men of blood, whose blind passions\r\nimmolated a Saron, a Bailly, and a Lavoisière.\r\n\r\nA few months after the 9th Thermidor, the Convention being desirous of\r\ndiffusing throughout the country ideas of order, civilization, and\r\ninternal prosperity, resolved upon organizing a system of public\r\ninstruction, but a difficulty arose in finding professors. The members\r\nof the corps of instruction had become officers of artillery, of\r\nengineering, or of the staff, and were combating the enemies of France\r\nat the frontiers. Fortunately at this epoch of intellectual exaltation,\r\nnothing seemed impossible. Professors were wanting; it was resolved\r\nwithout delay to create some, and the Normal School sprung into\r\nexistence. Fifteen hundred citizens of all ages, despatched from the\r\nprincipal district towns, assembled together, not to study in all their\r\nramifications the different branches of human knowledge, but in order to\r\nlearn the art of teaching under the greatest masters.\r\n\r\nFourier was one of these fifteen hundred pupils. It will, no doubt,\r\nexcite some surprise that he was elected at St. Florentine, and that\r\nAuxerre appeared insensible to the honour of being represented at Paris\r\nby the most illustrious of her children. But this indifference will be\r\nreadily understood. The elaborate scaffolding of calumny which it has\r\nserved to support will fall to the ground as soon as I recall to mind,\r\nthat after the 9th Thermidor the capital, and especially the provinces,\r\nbecame a prey to a blind and disorderly reaction, as all political\r\nreactions invariably are; that crime (the crime of having changed\r\nopinions--it was nothing less hideous) usurped the place of justice;\r\nthat excellent citizens, that pure, moderate, and conscientious patriots\r\nwere daily massacred by hired bands of assassins in presence of whom the\r\ninhabitants remained mute with fear. Such are, Gentlemen, the formidable\r\ninfluences which for a moment deprived Fourier of the suffrages of his\r\ncountrymen; and caricatured, as a partisan of Robespierre, the\r\nindividual whom St. Just, making allusion to his sweet and persuasive\r\neloquence, styled a _patriot in music_; who was so often thrown into\r\nprison by the decemvirs; who, at the very height of the Reign of Terror,\r\noffered before the Revolutionary Tribunal the assistance of his\r\nadmirable talents to the mother of Marshal Davoust, accused of the crime\r\nof having at that unrelenting epoch sent some money to the emigrants;\r\nwho had the incredible boldness to shut up at the inn of Tonnerre an\r\nagent of the Committee of Public Safety, into the secret of whose\r\nmission he penetrated, and thus obtained time to warn an honourable\r\ncitizen that he was about to be arrested; who, finally, attaching\r\nhimself personally to the sanguinary proconsul before whom every one\r\ntrembled in Yonne, made him pass for a madman, and obtained his recall!\r\nYou see, Gentlemen, some of the acts of patriotism, of devotion, and of\r\nhumanity which signalized the early years of Fourier. They were, you\r\nhave seen, repaid with ingratitude. But ought we in reality to be\r\nastonished at it? To expect gratitude from the man who cannot make an\r\navowal of his feelings without danger, would be to shut one's eyes to\r\nthe frailty of human nature, and to expose one's self to frequent\r\ndisappointments.\r\n\r\nIn the Normal School of the Convention, discussion from time to time\r\nsucceeded ordinary lectures. On those days an interchange of characters\r\nwas effected; the pupils interrogated the professors. Some words\r\npronounced by Fourier at one of those curious and useful meetings\r\nsufficed to attract attention towards him. Accordingly, as soon as a\r\nnecessity was felt to create Masters of Conference, all eyes were turned\r\ntowards the pupil of St. Florentine. The precision, the clearness, and\r\nthe elegance of his lectures soon procured for him the unanimous\r\napplause of the fastidious and numerous audience which was confided to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen he attained the height of his scientific and literary glory,\r\nFourier used to look back with pleasure upon the year 1794, and upon the\r\nsublime efforts which the French nation then made for the purpose of\r\norganizing a Corps of Public Instruction. If he had ventured, the title\r\nof Pupil of the original Normal School would have been beyond doubt that\r\nwhich he would have assumed by way of preference. Gentlemen, that school\r\nperished of cold, of wretchedness, and of hunger, and not, whatever\r\npeople may say, from certain defects of organization which time and\r\nreflection would have easily rectified. Notwithstanding its short\r\nexistence, it imparted to scientific studies quite a new direction which\r\nhas been productive of the most important results. In supporting this\r\nopinion at some length, I shall acquit myself of a task which Fourier\r\nwould certainly have imposed upon me, if he could have suspected, that\r\nwith just and eloquent eulogiums of his character and his labours there\r\nshould mingle within the walls of this apartment, and even emanate from\r\nthe mouth of one of his successors, sharp critiques of his beloved\r\nNormal School.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Normal School that we must inevitably ascend if we would\r\ndesire to ascertain the earliest public teaching of _descriptive\r\nGeometry_, that fine creation of the genius of Monge. It is from this\r\nsource that it has passed almost without modification to the Polytechnic\r\nSchool, to foundries, to manufactories, and the most humble workshops.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Normal School accordingly indicates the\r\ncommencement of a veritable revolution in the study of pure mathematics;\r\nwith it demonstrations, methods, and important theories, buried in\r\nacademical collections, appeared for the first time before the pupils,\r\nand encouraged them to recast upon new bases the works destined for\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nWith some rare exceptions, the philosophers engaged in the cultivation\r\nof science constituted formerly in France a class totally distinct from\r\nthat of the professors. By appointing the first geometers, the first\r\nphilosophers, and the first naturalists of the world to be professors,\r\nthe Convention threw new lustre upon the profession of teaching, the\r\nadvantageous influence of which is felt in the present day. In the\r\nopinion of the public at large a title which a Lagrange, a Laplace, a\r\nMonge, a Berthollet, had borne, became a proper match to the finest\r\ntitles. If under the empire, the Polytechnic School counted among its\r\nactive professors councillors of state, ministers, and the president of\r\nthe senate, you must look for the explanation of this fact in the\r\nimpulse given by the Normal School.\r\n\r\nYou see in the ancient great colleges, professors concealed in some\r\ndegree behind their portfolios, reading as from a pulpit, amid the\r\nindifference and inattention of their pupils, discourses prepared\r\nbeforehand with great labour, and which reappear every year in the same\r\nform. Nothing of this kind existed at the Normal School; oral lessons\r\nalone were there permitted. The authorities even went so far as to\r\nrequire of the illustrious savans appointed to the task of instruction\r\nthe formal promise never to recite any lectures which they might have\r\nlearned by heart. From that time the chair has become a tribune where\r\nthe professor, identified, so to speak, with his audience, sees in\r\ntheir looks, in their gestures, in their countenance, sometimes the\r\nnecessity for proceeding at greater speed, sometimes, on the contrary,\r\nthe necessity of retracing his steps, of awakening the attention by some\r\nincidental observations, of clothing in a new form the thought which,\r\nwhen first expressed, had left some doubts in the minds of his audience.\r\nAnd do not suppose that the beautiful impromptu lectures with which the\r\namphitheatre of the Normal School resounded, remained unknown to the\r\npublic. Short-hand writers paid by the State reported them. The sheets,\r\nafter being revised by the professors, were sent to the fifteen hundred\r\npupils, to the members of Convention, to the consuls and agents of the\r\nRepublic in foreign countries, to all governors of districts. There was\r\nin this something certainly of profusion compared with the parsimonious\r\nand mean habits of our time. Nobody, however, would concur in this\r\nreproach, however slight it may appear, if I were permitted to point out\r\nin this very apartment an illustrious Academician, whose mathematical\r\ngenius was awakened by the lectures of the Normal School in an obscure\r\ndistrict town!\r\n\r\nThe necessity of demonstrating the important services, ignored in the\r\npresent day, for which the dissemination of the sciences is indebted to\r\nthe first Normal School, has induced me to dwell at greater length on\r\nthe subject than I intended. I hope to be pardoned; the example in any\r\ncase will not be contagious. Eulogiums of the past, you know, Gentlemen,\r\nare no longer fashionable. Every thing which is said, every thing which\r\nis printed, induces us to suppose that the world is the creation of\r\nyesterday. This opinion, which allows to each a part more or less\r\nbrilliant in the cosmogonic drama, is under the safeguard of too many\r\nvanities to have any thing to fear from the efforts of logic.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the brilliant success of Fourier at the\r\nNormal School assigned to him a distinguished place among the persons\r\nwhom nature has endowed in the highest degree with the talent of public\r\ntuition. Accordingly, he was not forgotten by the founders of the\r\nPolytechnic School. Attached to that celebrated establishment, first\r\nwith the title of Superintendent of Lectures on Fortification,\r\nafterwards appointed to deliver a course of lectures on Analysis,\r\nFourier has left there a venerated name, and the reputation of a\r\nprofessor distinguished by clearness, method, and erudition; I shall add\r\neven the reputation of a professor full of grace, for our colleague has\r\nproved that this kind of merit may not be foreign to the teaching of\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nThe lectures of Fourier have not been collected together. The Journal of\r\nthe Polytechnic School contains only one paper by him, a memoir upon the\r\n\"principle of virtual velocities.\" This memoir, which probably had\r\nserved for the text of a lecture, shows that the secret of our\r\ncelebrated professor's great success consisted in the combination of\r\nabstract truths, of interesting applications, and of historical details\r\nlittle known, and derived, a thing so rare in our days, from original\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the epoch when the peace of Leoben brought back\r\nto the metropolis the principal ornaments of our armies. Then the\r\nprofessors and the pupils of the Polytechnic School had sometimes the\r\ndistinguished honour of sitting in their amphitheatres beside Generals\r\nDesaix and Bonaparte. Every thing indicated to them then an active\r\nparticipation in the events which each foresaw, and which in fact were\r\nnot long of occurring.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the precarious condition of Europe, the Directory\r\ndecided upon denuding the country of its best troops, and launching them\r\nupon an adventurous expedition. The five chiefs of the Republic were\r\nthen desirous of removing from Paris the conqueror of Italy, of thereby\r\nputting an end to the popular demonstrations of which he everywhere\r\nformed the object, and which sooner or later would become a real danger.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the illustrious general did not dream merely of the\r\nmomentary conquest of Egypt; he wished to restore to that country its\r\nancient splendour; he wished to extend its cultivation, to improve its\r\nsystem of irrigation, to create new branches of industry, to open to\r\ncommerce numerous outlets, to stretch out a helping hand to the\r\nunfortunate inhabitants, to rescue them from the galling yoke under\r\nwhich they had groaned for ages, in a word, to bestow upon them without\r\ndelay all the benefits of European civilization. Designs of such\r\nmagnitude could not have been accomplished with the mere _personnel_ of\r\nan ordinary army. It was necessary to appeal to science, to literature,\r\nand to the fine arts; it was necessary to ask the coöperation of several\r\nmen of judgment and of experience. Monge and Berthollet, both members of\r\nthe Institute and Professors in the Polytechnic School, became, with a\r\nview to this object, the principal recruiting aids to the chief of the\r\nexpedition. Were our colleagues really acquainted with the object of\r\nthis expedition? I dare not reply in the affirmative; but I know at all\r\nevents that they were not permitted to divulge it. We are going to a\r\ndistant country; we shall embark at Toulon; we shall be constantly with\r\nyou; General Bonaparte will command the army, such was in form and\r\nsubstance the limited amount of confidential information which had been\r\nimperiously traced out to them. Upon the faith of words so vague, with\r\nthe chances of a naval battle, with the English hulks in perspective, go\r\nin the present day and endeavour to enroll a father of a family, a\r\nsavant already known by useful labours and placed in some honourable\r\nposition, an artist in possession of the esteem and confidence of the\r\npublic, and I am much mistaken if you obtain any thing else than\r\nrefusals; but in 1798, France had hardly emerged from a terrible crisis,\r\nduring which her very existence was frequently at stake. Who, besides,\r\nhad not encountered imminent personal danger? Who had not seen with his\r\nown eyes enterprises of a truly desperate nature brought to a fortunate\r\nissue? Is any thing more wanted to explain that adventurous character,\r\nthat absence of all care for the morrow, which appears to have been one\r\nof the most distinguishing features of the epoch of the Directory.\r\nFourier accepted then without hesitation the proposals which his\r\ncolleagues brought to him in the name of the Commander-in-Chief; he\r\nquitted the agreeable duties of a professor of the Polytechnic School,\r\nto go--he knew not where, to do--he knew not what.\r\n\r\nChance placed Fourier during the voyage in the vessel in which Kléber\r\nsailed. The friendship which the philosopher and the warrior vowed to\r\neach other from that moment was not without some influence upon the\r\nevents of which Egypt was the theatre after the departure of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nHe who signed his orders of the day, the _Member of the Institute,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army in the East_, could not fail to place an\r\nAcademy among the means of regenerating the ancient kingdom of the\r\nPharaohs. The valiant army which he commanded had barely conquered at\r\nCairo, on the occasion of the memorable battle of the Pyramids, when the\r\nInstitute of Egypt sprung into existence. It consisted of forty-eight\r\nmembers, divided into four sections. Monge had the honour of being the\r\nfirst president. As at Paris, Bonaparte belonged to the section of\r\nMathematics. The situation of perpetual secretary, the filling up of\r\nwhich was left to the free choice of the Society, was unanimously\r\nassigned to Fourier.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the celebrated geometer discharge the same duty at the\r\nAcademy of Sciences; you have appreciated his liberality of mind, his\r\nenlightened benevolence, his unvarying affability, his straightforward\r\nand conciliatory disposition: add in imagination to so many rare\r\nqualities the activity which youth, which health can alone give, and you\r\nwill have again conjured into existence the Secretary of the Institute\r\nof Egypt; and yet the portrait which I have attempted to draw of him\r\nwould grow pale beside the original.\r\n\r\nUpon the banks of the Nile, Fourier devoted himself to assiduous\r\nresearches on almost every branch of knowledge which the vast plan of\r\nthe Institute embraced. The _Decade_ and the _Courier of Egypt_ will\r\nacquaint the reader with the titles of his different labours. I find in\r\nthese journals a memoir upon the general solution of algebraic\r\nequations; researches on the methods of elimination; the demonstration\r\nof a new theorem of algebra; a memoir upon the indeterminate analysis;\r\nstudies on general mechanics; a technical and historical work upon the\r\naqueduct which conveys the waters of the Nile to the Castle of Cairo;\r\nreflections upon the Oases; the plan of statistical researches to be\r\nundertaken with respect to the state of Egypt; programme of an intended\r\nexploration of the site of the ancient Memphis, and of the whole extent\r\nof burying-places; a descriptive account of the revolutions and manners\r\nof Egypt, from the time of its conquest by Selim.\r\n\r\nI find also in the Egyptian _Decade_, that, on the first complementary\r\nday of the year VI., Fourier communicated to the Institute the\r\ndescription of a machine designed to promote irrigation, and which was\r\nto be driven by the power of wind.\r\n\r\nThis work, so far removed from the ordinary current of the ideas of our\r\ncolleague, has not been printed. It would very naturally find a place in\r\na work of which the Expedition to Egypt might again furnish the subject,\r\nnotwithstanding the many beautiful publications which it has already\r\ncalled into existence. It would be a description of the manufactories of\r\nsteel, of arms, of powder, of cloth, of machines, and of instruments of\r\nevery kind which our army had to prepare for the occasion. If, during\r\nour infancy, the expedients which Robinson Crusoe practised in order to\r\nescape from the romantic dangers which he had incessantly to encounter,\r\nexcite our interest in a lively degree, how, in mature age, could we\r\nregard with indifference a handful of Frenchmen thrown upon the\r\ninhospitable shores of Africa, without any possible communication with\r\nthe mother country, obliged to contend at once with the elements and\r\nwith formidable armies, destitute of food, of clothing, of arms, and of\r\nammunition, and yet supplying every want by the force of genius!\r\n\r\nThe long route which I have yet to traverse, will hardly allow me to add\r\na few words relative to the administrative services of the illustrious\r\ngeometer. Appointed French Commissioner at the Divan of Cairo, he\r\nbecame the official medium between the General-in-Chief and every\r\nEgyptian who might have to complain of an attack against his person, his\r\nproperty, his morals, his habits, or his creed. An invariable sauvity of\r\nmanner, a scrupulous regard for prejudices to oppose which directly\r\nwould have been vain, an inflexible sentiment of justice, had given him\r\nan ascendency over the Mussulman population, which the precepts of the\r\nKoran could not lead any one to hope for, and which powerfully\r\ncontributed to the maintenance of friendly relations between the\r\ninhabitants of Cairo and the French soldiers. Fourier was especially\r\nheld in veneration by the Cheiks and the Ulémas. A single anecdote will\r\nserve to show that this sentiment was the offspring of genuine\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Emir Hadgey, or Prince of the Caravan, who had been nominated by\r\nGeneral Bonaparte upon his arrival in Cairo, escaped during the campaign\r\nof Syria. There existed strong grounds at the time for supposing that\r\nfour _Cheiks Ulémas_ had rendered themselves accomplices of the treason.\r\nUpon his return to Egypt, Bonaparte confided the investigation of this\r\ngrave affair to Fourier. \"Do not,\" said he, \"submit half measures to me.\r\nYou have to pronounce judgment upon high personages: we must either cut\r\noff their heads or invite them to dinner.\" On the day following that on\r\nwhich this conversation took place, the four Cheiks dined with the\r\nGeneral-in-Chief. By obeying the inspirations of his heart, Fourier did\r\nnot perform merely an act of humanity; it was moreover one of excellent\r\npolicy. Our learned colleague, M. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, to whom I am\r\nindebted for this anecdote, has stated in fact that Soleyman and\r\nFayoumi, the principal of the Egyptian chiefs, whose punishment, thanks\r\nto our colleague, was so happily transformed into a banquet, seized\r\nevery occasion of extolling among their countrymen the generosity of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nFourier did not display less ability when our generals confided\r\ndiplomatic missions to him. It is to his tact and urbanity that our army\r\nis indebted for an offensive and defensive treaty of alliance with\r\nMourad Bey. Justly proud of this result, Fourier omitted to make known\r\nthe details of the negotiation. This is deeply to be regretted, for the\r\nplenipotentiary of Mourad was a woman, the same Sitty Nefiçah whom\r\nKléber has immortalized by proclaiming her _beneficence_, _her noble\r\ncharacter_, in the bulletin of Heliopolis, and who moreover was already\r\ncelebrated from one extremity of Asia to the other, in consequence of\r\nthe bloody revolutions which her unparalleled beauty had excited among\r\nthe Mamelukes.\r\n\r\nThe incomparable victory which Kléber gained over the army of the Grand\r\nVizier did not damp the energy of the Janissaries, who had seized upon\r\nCairo while the war was raging at Heliopolis. They defended themselves\r\nfrom house to house with heroic courage. The besieged had to choose\r\nbetween the entire destruction of the city and an honourable\r\ncapitulation. The latter alternative was adopted. Fourier, charged, as\r\nusual, with the negotiations, conducted them to a favourable issue; but\r\non this occasion the treaty was not discussed, agreed to, and signed\r\nwithin the mysterious precincts of a harem, upon downy couches, under\r\nthe shade of balmy groves. The preliminary discussions were held in a\r\nhouse half ruined by bullets and grape-shot; in the centre of the\r\nquarter of which the insurgents valiantly disputed the possession with\r\nour soldiers; before even it would have been possible to agree to the\r\nbasis of a treaty of a few hours. Accordingly, when Fourier was\r\npreparing to celebrate the welcome of the Turkish commissioner\r\nconformably to oriental usages, a great number of musket-shots were\r\nfired from the house in front, and a ball passed through the coffee-pot\r\nwhich he was holding in his hand. Without calling in question the\r\nbravery of any person, do you not think, Gentlemen, that if diplomatists\r\nwere usually placed in equally perilous positions, the public would have\r\nless reason to complain of their proverbial slowness?\r\n\r\nIn order to exhibit, under one point of view, the various administrative\r\nduties of our indefatigable colleague, I should have to show him to you\r\non board the English fleet, at the instant of the capitulation of Menou,\r\nstipulating for certain guarantees in favour of the members of the\r\nInstitute of Egypt; but services of no less importance and of a\r\ndifferent nature demand also our attention. They will even compel us to\r\nretrace our steps, to ascend even to the epoch of glorious memory when\r\nDesaix achieved the conquest of Upper Egypt, as much by the sagacity,\r\nthe moderation, and the inflexible justice of all his acts, as by the\r\nrapidity and boldness of his military operations. Bonaparte then\r\nappointed two numerous commissions to proceed to explore in those remote\r\nregions, a multitude of monuments of which the moderns hardly suspected\r\nthe existence. Fourier and Costas were the commandants of these\r\ncommissions; I say the commandants, for a sufficiently imposing military\r\nforce had been assigned to them; since it was frequently after a combat\r\nwith the wandering tribes of Arabs that the astronomer found in the\r\nmovements of the heavenly bodies the elements of a future geographical\r\nmap; that the naturalist collected unknown plants, determined the\r\ngeological constitution of the soil, occupied himself with troublesome\r\ndissections; that the antiquary measured the dimensions of edifices,\r\nthat he attempted to take a faithful sketch of the fantastic images with\r\nwhich every thing was covered in that singular country,--from the\r\nsmallest pieces of furniture, from the simple toys of children, to those\r\nprodigious palaces, to those immense façades, beside which the vastest\r\nof modern constructions would hardly attract a look.\r\n\r\nThe two learned commissions studied with scrupulous care the magnificent\r\ntemple of the ancient Tentyris, and especially the series of\r\nastronomical signs which have excited in our days such lively\r\ndiscussions; the remarkable monuments of the mysterious and sacred Isle\r\nof Elephantine; the ruins of Thebes, with her hundred gates, before\r\nwhich (and yet they are nothing but ruins) our whole army halted, in a\r\nstate of astonishment, to applaud.\r\n\r\nFourier also presided in Upper Egypt over these memorable works, when\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief suddenly quitted Alexandria and returned to\r\nFrance with his principal friends. Those persons then were very much\r\nmistaken who, upon not finding our colleague on board the frigate\r\n_Muiron_ beside Monge and Berthollet, imagined that Bonaparte did not\r\nappreciate his eminent qualities. If Fourier was not a passenger, this\r\narose from the circumstance of his having been a hundred leagues from\r\nthe Mediterranean when the _Muiron_ set sail. The explanation contains\r\nnothing striking, but it is true. In any case, the friendly feeling of\r\nKléber towards the Secretary of the Institute of Egypt, the influence\r\nwhich he justly granted to him on a multitude of delicate occasions,\r\namply compensated him for an unjust omission.\r\n\r\nI arrive, Gentlemen, at the epoch so suggestive of painful\r\nrecollections, when the _Agas_ of the Janissaries who had fled into\r\nSyria, having despaired of vanquishing our troops so admirably\r\ncommanded, by the honourable arms of the soldier, had recourse to the\r\ndagger of the assassin. You are aware that a young fanatic, whose\r\nimagination had been wrought up to a high state of excitement in the\r\nmosques by a month of prayers and abstinence, aimed a mortal blow at the\r\nhero of Heliopolis at the instant when he was listening, without\r\nsuspicion, and with his usual kindness, to a recital of pretended\r\ngrievances, and was promising redress.\r\n\r\nThis sad misfortune plunged our colony into profound grief. The\r\nEgyptians themselves mingled their tears with those of the French\r\nsoldiers. By a delicacy of feeling which we should be wrong in supposing\r\nthe Mahometans not to be capable of, they did not then omit, they have\r\nnot since omitted, to remark, that the assassin and his three\r\naccomplices were not born on the banks of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe army, to mitigate its grief, desired that the funeral of Kléber\r\nshould be celebrated with great pomp. It wished, also, that on that\r\nsolemn day, some person should recount the long series of brilliant\r\nactions which will transmit the name of the illustrious general to the\r\nremotest posterity. By unanimous consent this honourable and perilous\r\nmission was confided to Fourier.\r\n\r\nThere are very few individuals, Gentlemen, who have not seen the\r\nbrilliant dreams of their youth wrecked one after the other against the\r\nsad realities of mature age. Fourier was one of those few exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn effect, transport yourselves mentally back to the year 1789, and\r\nconsider what would be the future prospects of the humble convert of St.\r\nBenoît-sur-Loire. No doubt a small share of literary glory; the favour\r\nof being heard occasionally in the churches of the metropolis; the\r\nsatisfaction of being appointed to eulogize such or such a public\r\npersonage. Well! nine years have hardly passed and you find him at the\r\nhead of the Institute of Egypt, and he is the oracle, the idol of a\r\nsociety which counted among its members Bonaparte, Berthollet, Monge,\r\nMalus, Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, Conté, &c.; and the generals rely upon\r\nhim for overcoming apparently insurmountable difficulties, and the army\r\nof the East, itself so rich in adornments of all kinds, would desire no\r\nother interpreter when it is necessary to recount the lofty deeds of the\r\nhero which it had just lost.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the breach of a bastion which our troops had recently taken\r\nby assault, in sight of the most majestic of rivers, of the magnificent\r\nvalley which it fertilizes, of the frightful desert of Lybia, of the\r\ncolossal pyramids of Gizeh; it was in presence of twenty populations of\r\ndifferent origins which Cairo unites together in its vast basin; in\r\npresence of the most valiant soldiers that had ever set foot on a land,\r\nwherein, however, the names of Alexander and of Cæsar still resound; it\r\nwas in the midst of every thing which could move the heart, excite the\r\nideas, or exalt the imagination, that Fourier unfolded the noble life of\r\nKléber. The orator was listened to with religious silence; but soon,\r\naddressing himself with a gesture of his hand to the soldiers ranged in\r\nbattle array before him, he exclaims: \"Ah! how many of you would have\r\naspired to the honour of throwing yourselves between Kléber and his\r\nassassin! I call you to witness, intrepid cavalry, who rushed to save\r\nhim upon the heights of Koraïm, and dispelled in an instant the\r\nmultitude of enemies who had surrounded him!\" At these words an electric\r\ntremor thrills throughout the whole army, the colours droop, the ranks\r\nclose, the arms come into collision, a deep sigh escapes from some ten\r\nthousand breasts torn by the sabre and the bullet, and the voice of the\r\norator is drowned amid sobs.\r\n\r\nA few months after, upon the same bastion, before the same soldiers,\r\nFourier celebrated with no less eloquence the exploits, the virtues of\r\nthe general whom the people conquered in Africa saluted with the name so\r\nflattering of _Just Sultan_; and who sacrificed his life at Marengo to\r\nsecure the triumph of the French arms.\r\n\r\nFourier quitted Egypt only with the last wreck of the army, in virtue of\r\nthe capitulation signed by Menou. On his return to France, the object of\r\nhis most constant solicitude was to illustrate the memorable expedition\r\nof which he had been one of the most active and most useful members. The\r\nidea of collecting together the varied labours of all his colleagues\r\nincontestibly belongs to him. I find the proof of this in a letter,\r\nstill unpublished, which he wrote to Kléber from Thebes, on the 20th\r\nVendémiaire, in the year VII. No public act, in which mention is made of\r\nthis great literary monument, is of an earlier date. The Institute of\r\nCairo having adopted the project of a _work upon Egypt_ as early as the\r\nmonth of Frimaire, in the year VIII., confided to Fourier the task of\r\nuniting together the scattered elements of it, of making them consistent\r\nwith each other, and drawing up the general introduction.\r\n\r\nThis introduction was published under the title of _Historical Preface_:\r\nFontanes saw in it the graces of Athens and the wisdom of Egypt united\r\ntogether. What could I add to such an eulogium? I shall say only that\r\nthere are to be found there, in a few pages, the principal features of\r\nthe government of the Pharaohs, and the results of the subjection of\r\nancient Egypt by the kings of Persia, the Ptolemies, the successors of\r\nAugustus, the emperors of Byzantium, the first Caliphs, the celebrated\r\nSaladin, the Mamelukes and the Ottoman princes. The different phases of\r\nour adventurous expedition are there characterized with the greatest\r\ncare. Fourier carries his scruples to so great a length as _to attempt_\r\nto prove that it was just. I have said only so far as _to attempt_, for\r\nin that case there might have been something to deduct from the second\r\npart of the eulogium of Fontanes. If, in 1797, our countryman\r\nexperienced at Cairo, or at Alexandria, outrages and extortions which\r\nthe Grand Seignior either would not or could not repress, one may in all\r\nrigour admit that France ought to have exacted justice to herself; that\r\nshe had the right to send a powerful army to bring the Turkish\r\nCustom-house officers to reason. But this is far from maintaining that\r\nthe divan of Constantinople ought to have favoured the French\r\nexpedition; that our conquest was about to restore to him, _in some\r\nsort_, Egypt and Syria; that the capture of Alexandria and the battle of\r\nthe _Pyramids would enhance the lustre of the Ottoman name_! However,\r\nthe public hastened to acquit Fourier of what appears hazarded in this\r\nsmall part of his beautiful work. The origin of it has been sought for\r\nin political exigencies. Let us be brief; behind certain sophisms the\r\nhand of the original Commander-in-Chief of the army of the East was\r\nsuspected to be seen!\r\n\r\nNapoleon, then, would appear to have participated by his instructions,\r\nby his counsels, or, if we choose, by his imperative orders, in the\r\ncomposition of the essay of Fourier. What was not long ago nothing more\r\nthan a plausible conjecture, has now become an incontestable fact.\r\nThanks to the courtesy of M. Champollion-Figeac, I held in my hands,\r\nwithin the last few days, some parts of the first _proof sheets_ of the\r\nhistorical preface. These proofs were sent to the Emperor, who wished to\r\nmake himself acquainted with them at leisure before reading them with\r\nFourier. They are covered with marginal notes, and the additions which\r\nthey have occasioned amount to almost a third of the original discourse.\r\nUpon these pages, as in the definitive work given to the public, one\r\nremarks a complete absence of proper names; the only exception is in the\r\ncase of the three Generals-in-Chief. Thus Fourier had imposed upon\r\nhimself the reserve which certain vanities have blamed so severely. I\r\nshall add that nowhere throughout the precious proof sheets of M.\r\nChampollion do we perceive traces of the miserable feelings of jealousy\r\nwhich have been attributed to Napoleon. It is true that upon pointing\r\nout with his finger the word illustrious applied to Kléber, the Emperor\r\nsaid to our colleague: \"SOME ONE has directed my attention to\r\nTHIS EPITHET;\" but, after a short pause, he added, \"it is\r\ndesirable that you should leave it, for it is just and well deserved.\"\r\nThese words, Gentlemen, honoured the monarch still less than they\r\nbranded with disgrace the _some one_ whom I regret not being able to\r\ndesignate in more definite terms,--one of those vile courtiers whose\r\nwhole life is occupied in spying out the frailties, the evil passions of\r\ntheir masters, in order to make them subservient in conducting\r\nthemselves to honours and fortune!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURIER PREFECT OF L'ISÈRE.\r\n\r\nFourier had no sooner returned to Europe, than he was named (January 2,\r\n1802) Prefect of the Department of l'Isère. The Ancient Dauphiny was\r\nthen a prey to ardent political dissensions. The republicans, the\r\npartisans of the emigrants, those who had ranged themselves under the\r\nbanners of the consular government, formed so many distinct castes,\r\nbetween whom all reconciliation appeared impossible. Well, Gentlemen,\r\nthis impossibility Fourier achieved. His first care was to cause the\r\nHôtel of the Prefecture to be considered as a neutral ground, where each\r\nmight show himself without even the appearance of a concession.\r\nCuriosity alone at first brought the people there, but the people\r\nreturned; for in France they seldom desert the saloons wherein are to be\r\nfound a polished and benevolent host, witty without being ridiculous,\r\nand learned without being pedantic. What had been divulged of the\r\nopinions of our colleague, respecting the anti-biblican antiquity of the\r\nEgyptian monuments, inspired the religious classes especially with\r\nlively apprehensions; they were very adroitly informed that the new\r\nprefect counted a _Saint_ in his family; that the _blessed_ Pierre\r\nFourier, who established the religious sisters of the congregation of\r\nNotre-Dame, was his grand uncle, and this circumstance effected a\r\nreconciliation which the unalterable respect of the first magistrate of\r\nGrenoble for all conscientious opinions cemented every day more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was assured of a truce with the political and religious\r\nparties, Fourier was enabled to devote himself exclusively to the duties\r\nof his office. These duties did not consist with him in heaping up old\r\npapers to no advantage. He took personal cognizance of the projects\r\nwhich were submitted to him; he was the indefatigable promoter of all\r\nthose which narrow-minded persons sought to stifle in their birth; we\r\nmay include in this last class, the superb road from Grenoble to Turin\r\nby Mount Genèvre, which the events of 1814 have so unfortunately\r\ninterrupted, and especially the drainage of the marshes of Bourgoin.\r\n\r\nThese marshes, which Louis XIV. had given to Marshal Turenne, were a\r\nfocus of infection to the thirty-seven communes, the lands of which were\r\npartially covered by them. Fourier directed personally the topographic\r\noperations which established the possibility of drainage. With these\r\ndocuments in his hand he went from village to village, I might almost\r\nsay from house to house, to fix the sacrifice which each family ought to\r\nimpose upon itself for the general interest. By tact and perseverance,\r\ntaking \"the _ear of corn always in the right direction_,\" thirty-seven\r\nmunicipal councils were induced to contribute to a common fund, without\r\nwhich the projected operation would not even have been commenced.\r\nSuccess crowned this rare perseverance. Rich harvests, fat pastures,\r\nnumerous flocks, a robust and happy population now covered an immense\r\nterritory, where formerly the traveller dared not remain more than a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nOne of the predecessors of Fourier, in the situation of perpetual\r\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences, deemed it his duty, on one\r\noccasion, to beg an excuse for having given a detailed account of\r\ncertain researches of Leibnitz, which had not required great efforts of\r\nthe intellect: \"We ought,\" says he, \"to be very much obliged to a man\r\nsuch as he is, when he condescends, for the public good, to do something\r\nwhich does not partake of genius!\" I cannot conceive the ground of such\r\nscruples; in the present day, the sciences are regarded from too high a\r\npoint of view, that we should hesitate in placing in the first rank of\r\nthe labours with which they are adorned, those which diffuse comfort,\r\nhealth, and happiness amidst the working population.\r\n\r\nIn presence of a part of the Academy of Inscriptions, in an apartment\r\nwherein the name of hieroglyph has so often resounded, I cannot refrain\r\nfrom alluding to the service which Fourier rendered to science by\r\nretaining Champollion. The young professor of history of the Faculty of\r\nLetters of Grenoble had just attained the twentieth year of his age.\r\nFate calls him to shoulder the musket. Fourier exempts him by investing\r\nhim with the title of pupil of the School of Oriental Languages which he\r\nhad borne at Paris. The Minister of War learns that the pupil formerly\r\ngave in his resignation; he denounces the fraud, and dispatches a\r\nperemptory order for his departure, which seems even to exclude all idea\r\nof remonstrance. Fourier, however, is not discouraged; his intercessions\r\nare skilful and of a pressing nature; finally, he draws so animated a\r\nportrait of the precocious talent of _his young friend_, that he\r\nsucceeds in wringing from the government an order of special exemption.\r\nIt was not easy, Gentlemen, to obtain such success. At the same time, a\r\nconscript, a _member of our Academy_, succeeded in obtaining a\r\nrevocation of his order for departure only by declaring that he would\r\nfollow on foot, in the costume of the Institute, the contingent of the\r\narrondissement of Paris in which he was classed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICAL THEORY OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe administrative duties of the prefect of l'Isère hardly interrupted\r\nthe labours of the geometer and the man of letters. It is from Grenoble\r\nthat the principal writings of Fourier are dated; it was at Grenoble\r\nthat he composed the _Théorie Mathématique de la Chaleur_, which forms\r\nhis principal title to the gratitude of the scientific world.\r\n\r\nI am far from being unconscious of the difficulty of analyzing that\r\nadmirable work, and yet I shall attempt to point out the successive\r\nsteps which he has achieved in the advancement of science. You will\r\nlisten to me, Gentlemen, with indulgence, notwithstanding several minute\r\ndetails which I shall have to recount, since I thereby fulfil the\r\nmission with which you have honoured me.\r\n\r\nThe ancients had a taste, let us say rather a passion, for the\r\nmarvellous, which caused them to forget even the sacred duties of\r\ngratitude. Observe them, for example, grouping together the lofty deeds\r\nof a great number of heroes, whose names they have not even deigned to\r\npreserve, and investing the single personage of Hercules with them. The\r\nlapse of ages has not rendered us wiser in this respect. In our own time\r\nthe public delight in blending fable with history. In every career of\r\nlife, in the pursuit of science especially, they enjoy a pleasure in\r\ncreating Herculeses. According to vulgar opinion, there is no\r\nastronomical discovery which is not due to Herschel. The theory of the\r\nplanetary movements is identified with the name of Laplace; hardly is a\r\npassing allusion made to the eminent labours of D'Alembert, of Clairaut,\r\nof Euler, of Lagrange. Watt is the sole inventor of the steam-engine.\r\nChaptal has enriched the arts of Chemistry with the totality of the\r\nfertile and ingenious processes which constitute their prosperity. Even\r\nwithin this apartment has not an eloquent voice lately asserted, that\r\nbefore Fourier the phenomenon of heat was hardly studied; that the\r\ncelebrated geometer had alone made more observations than all his\r\npredecessors put together; that he had with almost a single effort\r\ninvented a new science.\r\n\r\nAlthough he runs the risk of being less lively, the organ of the Academy\r\nof Sciences cannot permit himself such bursts of enthusiasm. He ought to\r\nbear in mind, that the object of these solemnities is not merely to\r\ncelebrate the discoveries of academicians; that they are also designed\r\nto encourage modest merit; that an observer forgotten by his\r\ncontemporaries, is frequently supported in his laborious researches by\r\nthe thought that he will obtain a benevolent look from posterity. Let us\r\nact, so far as it depends upon us, in such a manner that a hope so just,\r\nso natural, may not be frustrated. Let us award a just, a brilliant\r\nhomage to those rare men whom nature has endowed with the precious\r\nprivilege of arranging a thousand isolated facts, of making seductive\r\ntheories spring from them; but let us not forget to state, that the\r\nscythe of the reaper had cut the stalks before one had thought of\r\nuniting them into sheaves!\r\n\r\nHeat presents itself in natural phenomena, and in those which are the\r\nproducts of art under two entirely distinct forms, which Fourier has\r\nseparately considered. I shall adopt the same division, commencing\r\nhowever with radiant heat, the historical analysis which I am about to\r\nsubmit to you.\r\n\r\nNobody doubts that there is a physical distinction which is eminently\r\nworthy of being studied between the ball of iron at the ordinary\r\ntemperature which may be handled at pleasure, and the ball of iron of\r\nthe same dimensions which the flame of a furnace has very much heated,\r\nand which we cannot touch without burning ourselves. This distinction,\r\naccording to the majority of physical inquirers, arises from a certain\r\nquantity of an elastic imponderable fluid, or at least a fluid which has\r\nnot been weighed, with which the second ball has combined during the\r\nprocess of heating. The fluid which, upon combining with cold bodies\r\nrenders them hot, has been designated by the name of _heat_ or\r\n_caloric_.\r\n\r\nBodies unequally heated act upon each other _even at great distances,\r\neven through empty space_, for the colder becomes more hot, and the\r\nhotter becomes more cold; for after a certain time they indicate the\r\nsame degree of the thermometer, whatever may have been the difference of\r\ntheir original temperatures. According to the hypotheses above\r\nexplained, there is but one way of conceiving this action at a distance;\r\nthis is to suppose that it operates by the aid of certain effluvia which\r\ntraverse space by passing from the hot body to the cold body; that is,\r\nto admit that a hot body emits in every direction rays of heat, as\r\nluminous bodies emit rays of light.\r\n\r\nThe effluvia, the radiating emanations by the aid of which two distant\r\nbodies form a calorific communication with each other, have been very\r\nappropriately designated by the name of _radiating caloric_.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said to the contrary, radiating heat had already been\r\nthe object of important experiments before Fourier undertook his\r\nlabours. The celebrated academicians of the _Cimento_ found, nearly two\r\ncenturies ago, that this heat is reflected like light; that, as in the\r\ncase of light, a concave mirror concentrates it at the focus. Upon\r\nsubstituting balls of snow for heated bodies, they even went so far as\r\nto prove that frigorific foci may be formed by way of reflection. Some\r\nyears afterwards Mariotte, a member of this Academy, discovered that\r\nthere exist different kinds of radiating heat; that the heat with which\r\nrays of light are accompanied traverses all transparent media as easily\r\nas light does; while, again, the caloric which emanates from a strongly\r\nheated, but opaque substance, while the rays of heat, which are found\r\nmingled with the luminous rays of a body moderately incandescent, are\r\nalmost entirely arrested in their passage through the most transparent\r\nplate of glass!\r\n\r\nThis striking discovery, let us remark in passing, will show,\r\nnotwithstanding the ridicule of pretended savans, how happily inspired\r\nwere the workmen in founderies, who looked at the incandescent matter of\r\ntheir furnaces, only through a plate of ordinary glass, thinking by the\r\naid of this artifice to arrest the heat which would have burned their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIn the experimental sciences, the epochs of the most brilliant progress\r\nare almost always separated by long intervals of almost absolute repose.\r\nThus, after Mariotte, there elapsed more than a century without history\r\nhaving to record any new property of radiating heat. Then, in close\r\nsuccession, we find in the solar light obscure calorific rays, the\r\nexistence of which could admit of being established only with the\r\nthermometer, and which may be completely separated from luminous rays by\r\nthe aid of the prism; we discover, by the aid of terrestrial bodies,\r\nthat the emission of caloric rays, and consequently the cooling of those\r\nbodies, is considerably retarded by the polish of the surfaces; that the\r\ncolour, the nature, and the thickness of the outer coating of these\r\nsame surfaces, exercise also a manifest influence upon their emissive\r\npower. Experience, finally, rectifying the vague predictions to which\r\nthe most enlightened minds abandon themselves with so little reserve,\r\nshows that the calorific rays which emanate from the plane surface of a\r\nheated body have not the same force, the same intensity in all\r\ndirections; that the _maximum_ corresponds to the perpendicular\r\nemission, and the _minimum_ to the emissions parallel to the surface.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extreme positions, how does the diminution of the\r\nemissive power operate? Leslie first sought the solution of this\r\nimportant question. His observations seem to show that the intensities\r\nof the radiating rays are proportional (it is necessary, Gentlemen, that\r\nI employ the scientific expression) to the sines of the angles which\r\nthese rays form with the heated surface. But the quantities upon which\r\nthe experimenter had to operate were too feeble; the uncertainties of\r\nthe thermometric estimations compared with the total effect were, on the\r\ncontrary, too great not to inspire a strong degree of distrust: well,\r\nGentlemen, a problem before which all the processes, all the instruments\r\nof modern physics have remained powerless, Fourier has completely solved\r\nwithout the necessity of having recourse to any new experiment. He has\r\ntraced the law of the emission of caloric sought for, with a perspicuity\r\nwhich one cannot sufficiently admire, in the most ordinary phenomena of\r\ntemperature, in the phenomena which at first sight appeared to be\r\nentirely independent of it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the privilege of genius; it perceives, it seizes relations where\r\nvulgar eyes see only isolated facts.\r\n\r\nNobody doubts, and besides experiment has confirmed the fact, that in\r\nall the points of a space terminated by any envelop maintained at a\r\nconstant temperature, we ought also to experience a constant\r\ntemperature, and precisely that of the envelop. Now Fourier has\r\nestablished, that if the calorific rays emitted were equally intense in\r\nall directions, if the intensity did not vary proportionally to the sine\r\nof the angle of emission, the temperature of a body situated in the\r\nenclosure would depend on the place which it would occupy there: _that\r\nthe temperature of boiling water or of melting iron, for example, would\r\nexist in certain points of a hollow envelop of glass!_ In all the vast\r\ndomain of the physical sciences, we should be unable to find a more\r\nstriking application of the celebrated method of the _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of which the ancient mathematicians made use, in order to\r\ndemonstrate the abstract truths of geometry.\r\n\r\nI shall not quit this first part of the labours of Fourier without\r\nadding, that he has not contented himself with demonstrating with so\r\nmuch felicity the remarkable law which connects the comparative\r\nintensities of the calorific rays, emanating under all angles from\r\nheated bodies; he has sought, moreover, the physical cause of this law,\r\nand he has found it in a circumstance which his predecessors had\r\nentirely neglected. Let us suppose, says he, that bodies emit heat not\r\nonly from the molecules of their surfaces, but also from the particles\r\nin the interior. Let us suppose, moreover, that the heat of these latter\r\nparticles cannot arrive at the surface by traversing a certain thickness\r\nof matter without undergoing some degree of absorption. Fourier has\r\nreduced these two hypotheses to calculation, and he has hence deduced\r\nmathematically the experimental law of the sines. After having resisted\r\nso radical a test, the two hypotheses were found to be completely\r\nverified, they have become laws of nature; they point out latent\r\nproperties of caloric which could only be discerned by the eye of the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nIn the second question treated by Fourier, heat presents itself under a\r\nnew form. There is more difficulty in following its movements; but the\r\nconclusions deducible from the theory are also more general and more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nHeat excited, concentrated into a certain point of a solid body,\r\ncommunicates itself by way of conduction, first to the particles nearest\r\nthe heated point, then gradually to all the regions of the body. Whence\r\nthe problem of which the following is the enunciation.\r\n\r\nBy what routes, and with what velocities, is the propagation of heat\r\neffected in bodies of different forms and different natures subjected to\r\ncertain initial conditions?\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the Academy of Sciences had already proposed this problem\r\nas the subject of a prize as early as the year 1736. Then the terms heat\r\nand caloric were not in use; it demanded _the study of nature, and the\r\npropagation_ OF FIRE! The word _fire_, thrown thus into the\r\nprogramme without any other explanation, gave rise to a mistake of the\r\nmost singular kind. The majority of philosophers imagined that the\r\nquestion was to explain in what way _burning_ communicates itself, and\r\nincreases in a mass of combustible matter. Fifteen competitors presented\r\nthemselves; _three_ were crowned.\r\n\r\nThis competition was productive of very meagre results. However, a\r\nsingular combination of circumstances and of proper names will render\r\nthe recollection of it lasting.\r\n\r\nHas not the public a right to be surprised upon reading this Academic\r\ndeclaration: \"the question affords no handle to geometry!\" In matter of\r\ninventions, to attempt to dive into the future, is to prepare for one's\r\nself striking mistakes. One of the competitors, the great Euler, took\r\nthese words in their literal sense; the reveries with which his memoir\r\nabounds, are not compensated in this instance by any of those brilliant\r\ndiscoveries in analysis, I had almost said of those sublime\r\ninspirations, which were so familiar to him. Fortunately Euler appended\r\nto his memoir a supplement truly worthy of his genius. Father Lozeran de\r\nFiesc and the Count of Créqui were rewarded with the high honour of\r\nseeing their names inscribed beside that of the illustrious geometer,\r\nalthough it would be impossible in the present day to discern in their\r\nmemoirs any kind of merit, not even that of politeness, for the courtier\r\nsaid rudely to the Academy: \"the question, which you have raised,\r\ninterests only the curiosity of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the competitors less favourably treated, we perceive one of the\r\ngreatest writers whom France has produced; the author of the _Henriade_.\r\nThe memoir of Voltaire was, no doubt, far from solving the problem\r\nproposed; but it was at least distinguished by elegance, clearness, and\r\nprecision of language; I shall add, by a severe style of argument; for\r\nif the author occasionally arrives at questionable results, it is only\r\nwhen he borrows false data from the chemistry and physics of the\r\nepoch,--sciences which had just sprung into existence. Moreover, the\r\nanti-Cartesian colour of some of the parts of the memoir of Voltaire was\r\ncalculated to find little favour in a society, where Cartesianism, with\r\nits incomprehensible vortices, was everywhere held in high estimation.\r\n\r\nWe should have more difficulty in discovering the causes of the failure\r\nof a fourth competitor, Madame the Marchioness du Châtelet, for she also\r\nentered into the contest instituted by the Academy. The work of Emilia\r\nwas not only an elegant portrait of all the properties of heat, known\r\nthen to physical inquirers, there were remarked moreover in it,\r\ndifferent projects of experiments, among the rest one which Herschel has\r\nsince developed, and from which he has derived one of the principal\r\nflowers of his brilliant scientific crown.\r\n\r\nWhile such great names were occupied in discussing this question,\r\nphysical inquirers of a less ambitious stamp laid experimentally the\r\nsolid basis of a future mathematical theory of heat. Some established,\r\nthat the same quantity of caloric does not elevate by the same number of\r\ndegrees equal weights of different substances, and thereby introduced\r\ninto the science the important notion of _capacity_. Others, by the aid\r\nof observations no less certain, proved that heat, applied at the\r\nextremity of a bar, is transmitted to the extreme parts with greater or\r\nless velocity or intensity, according to the nature of the substance of\r\nwhich the bar is composed; thus they suggested the original idea of\r\n_conductibility_. The same epoch, if I were not precluded from entering\r\ninto too minute details, would present to us interesting experiments. We\r\nshould find that it is not true that, at all degrees of the thermometer,\r\nthe loss of heat of a body is proportional to the excess of its\r\ntemperature above that of the medium in which it is plunged; but I have\r\nbeen desirous of showing you geometry penetrating, timidly at first,\r\ninto questions of the propagation of heat, and depositing there the\r\nfirst germs of its fertile methods.\r\n\r\nIt is to Lambert of Mulhouse, that we owe this first step. This\r\ningenious geometer had proposed a very simple problem which any person\r\nmay comprehend. A slender metallic bar is exposed at one of its\r\nextremities to the constant action of a certain focus of heat. The parts\r\nnearest the focus are heated first. Gradually the heat communicates\r\nitself to the more distant parts, and, after a short time, each point\r\nacquires the maximum temperature which it can ever attain. Although the\r\nexperiment were to last a hundred years, the thermometric state of the\r\nbar would not undergo any modification.\r\n\r\nAs might be reasonably expected, this maximum of heat is so much less\r\nconsiderable as we recede from the focus. Is there any relation between\r\nthe final temperatures and the distances of the different particles of\r\nthe bar from the extremity directly heated? Such a relation exists. It\r\nis very simple. Lambert investigated it by calculation, and experience\r\nconfirmed the results of theory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the somewhat elementary question of the _longitudinal_\r\npropagation of heat, there offered itself the more general but much more\r\ndifficult problem of the propagation of heat in a body of three\r\ndimensions terminated by any surface whatever. This problem demanded the\r\naid of the higher analysis. It was Fourier who first assigned the\r\nequations. It is to Fourier, also, that we owe certain theorems, by\r\nmeans of which we may ascend from the differential equations to the\r\nintegrals, and push the solutions in the majority of cases to the final\r\nnumerical applications.\r\n\r\nThe first memoir of Fourier on the theory of heat dates from the year\r\n1807. The Academy, to which it was communicated, being desirous of\r\ninducing the author to extend and improve his researches, made the\r\nquestion of the propagation of heat the subject of the great\r\nmathematical prize which was to be awarded in the beginning of the year\r\n1812. Fourier did, in effect, compete, and his memoir was crowned. But,\r\nalas! as Fontenelle said: \"In the country even of demonstrations, there\r\nare to be found causes of dissension.\" Some restrictions mingled with\r\nthe favourable judgment. The illustrious commissioners of the prize,\r\nLaplace, Lagrange, and Legendre, while acknowledging the novelty and\r\nimportance of the subject, while declaring that the real differential\r\nequations of the propagation of heat were finally found, asserted that\r\nthey perceived difficulties in the way in which the author arrived at\r\nthem. They added, that his processes of integration left something to be\r\ndesired, even on the score of rigour. They did not, however, support\r\ntheir opinion by any arguments.\r\n\r\nFourier never admitted the validity of this decision. Even at the close\r\nof his life he gave unmistakable evidence that he thought it unjust, by\r\ncausing his memoir to be printed in our volumes without changing a\r\nsingle word. Still, the doubts expressed by the Commissioners of the\r\nAcademy reverted incessantly to his recollection. From the very\r\nbeginning they had poisoned the pleasure of his triumph. These first\r\nimpressions, added to a high susceptibility, explain how Fourier ended\r\nby regarding with a certain degree of displeasure the efforts of those\r\ngeometers who endeavoured to improve his theory. This, Gentlemen, was a\r\nvery strange aberration of a mind of so elevated an order! Our colleague\r\nhad almost forgotten that it is not allotted to any person to conduct a\r\nscientific question to a definitive termination, and that the important\r\nlabours of D'Alembert, Clairaut, Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, while\r\nimmortalizing their authors, have continually added new lustre to the\r\nimperishable glory of Newton. Let us act so that this example may not be\r\nlost. While the civil law imposes upon the tribunes the obligation to\r\nassign the motives of _their judgments_, the academies, which are the\r\ntribunes of science, cannot have even a pretext to escape from this\r\nobligation. Corporate bodies, as well as individuals, act wisely when\r\nthey reckon in every instance only upon the authority of reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL HEAT OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE.\r\n\r\nAt any time the _Théorie Mathématique de la Chaleur_ would have excited\r\na lively interest among men of reflection, since, upon the supposition\r\nof its being complete, it threw light upon the most minute processes of\r\nthe arts. In our time the numerous points of affinity existing between\r\nit and the curious discoveries of the geologists, have made it, if I may\r\nuse the expression, a work for the occasion. To point out the ultimate\r\nrelation which exists between these two kinds of researches would be to\r\npresent the most important part of the discoveries of Fourier, and to\r\nshow how happily our colleague, by one of those inspirations reserved\r\nfor genius, had chosen the subject of his researches.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the earth's crust, which the geologists call the\r\nsedimentary formations, were not formed all at once. The waters of the\r\nocean, on several former occasions, covered regions which are situated\r\nin the present day in the centre of the continent. There they deposited,\r\nin thin horizontal strata, a series of rocks of different kinds. These\r\nrocks, although superposed like the layers of stones of a wall, must not\r\nbe confounded together; their dissimilarities are palpable to the least\r\npractised eye. It is necessary also to note this capital fact, that\r\neach stratum has a well-defined limit; that no process of transition\r\nconnects it with the stratum which it supports. The ocean, the original\r\nsource of all these deposits, underwent then formerly enormous changes\r\nin its chemical composition to which it is no longer subject.\r\n\r\nWith some rare exceptions, resulting from local convulsions the effects\r\nof which are otherwise manifest, the order of antiquity of the\r\nsuccessive strata of rocks which form the exterior crust of the globe\r\nought to be that of their superposition. The deepest have been formed at\r\nthe most remote epochs. The attentive study of these different envelops\r\nmay aid us in ascending the stream of time, even beyond the most remote\r\nepochs, and enlightening us with respect to those stupendous revolutions\r\nwhich periodically overwhelmed continents beneath the waters of the\r\nocean, or again restored them to their former condition. Crystalline\r\nrocks of granite upon which the sea has effected its original deposits\r\nhave never exhibited any remains of life. Traces of such are to be found\r\nonly in the sedimentary strata.\r\n\r\nLife appears to have first exhibited itself on the earth in the form of\r\nvegetables. The remains of vegetables are all that we meet with in the\r\nmost ancient strata deposited by the waters; still, they belong to\r\nplants of the simplest structure,--to ferns, to species of rushes, to\r\nlycopodes.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend into the upper strata, vegetation becomes more and more\r\ncomplex. Finally, near the surface, it resembles the vegetation actually\r\nexisting on the earth, with this characteristic circumstance, however,\r\nwhich is well deserving attention, that certain vegetables which grow\r\nonly in southern climates, that the large palm-trees, for example, are\r\nfound in their fossil state in all latitudes, and even in the centre of\r\nthe frozen regions of Siberia.\r\n\r\nIn the primitive world, these northern regions enjoyed then, in winter,\r\na temperature at least equal to that which is experienced in the present\r\nday under the parallels where the great palms commence to appear: at\r\nTobolsk, the inhabitants enjoyed the climate of Alicante or Algiers!\r\n\r\nWe shall deduce new proofs of this mysterious result from an attentive\r\nexamination of the size of plants.\r\n\r\nThere exist, in the present day, willow grass or marshy rushes, ferns,\r\nand lycopodes, in Europe as well as in the tropical regions; but they\r\nare not met with in large dimensions, except in warm countries. Thus, to\r\ncompare together the dimensions of the same plants is, in reality, to\r\ncompare, in respect to temperature, the regions where they are produced.\r\nWell, place beside the fossil plants of our coal mines, I will not say\r\nthe analogous plants of Europe, but those which grow in the countries of\r\nSouth America, and which are most celebrated for the richness of their\r\nvegetation, and you will find the former to be of incomparably greater\r\ndimensions than the latter.\r\n\r\nThe _fossil flora_ of France, England, Germany, and Scandinavia offer,\r\nfor example, ferns ninety feet high, the stalks being six feet in\r\ndiameter, or eighteen feet in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe _lycopodes_ which, in the present day, whether in cold or temperate\r\nclimates, are creeping-plants rising hardly to the height of a decimètre\r\nabove the soil; which even at the equator, under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, do not attain a height of more than _one_ mètre, had in\r\nEurope, in the primitive world, an altitude of twenty-five mètres.\r\n\r\nOne must be blind to all reason not to find, in these enormous\r\ndimensions, a new proof of the high temperature enjoyed by our country\r\nbefore the last irruptions of the ocean!\r\n\r\nThe study of _fossil animals_ is no less fertile in results. I should\r\ndigress from my subject if I were to examine here how the organization\r\nof animals is developed upon the earth; what modifications, or more\r\nstrictly speaking, what complications it has undergone after each\r\ncataclysm, or if I even stopped to describe one of those ancient epochs\r\nduring which the earth, the sea, and the atmosphere had for inhabitants\r\ncold-blooded reptiles of enormous dimensions; tortoises with shells\r\nthree feet in diameter; lizards seventeen mètres long; pterodactyles,\r\nveritable flying dragons of such strange forms, that they might be\r\nclassed on good grounds either among reptiles, among mammiferous\r\nanimals, or among birds. The object, which I have proposed, does not\r\nrequire that I should enter into such details; a single remark will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nAmong the bones contained in the strata nearest the present surface of\r\nthe earth, are those of the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, and the\r\nelephant. These remains of animals of warm countries are to be found in\r\nall latitudes. Travellers have discovered specimens of them even at\r\nMelville Island, where the temperature descends, in the present day, 50°\r\nbeneath zero. In Siberia they are found in such abundance as to have\r\nbecome an article of commerce. Finally, upon the rocky shores of the\r\nArctic Ocean, there are to be found not merely fragments of skeletons,\r\nbut whole elephants still covered with their flesh and skin.\r\n\r\nI should deceive myself very much, Gentlemen, if I were to suppose that\r\neach of you had not deduced from these remarkable facts a conclusion no\r\nless remarkable, to which indeed the fossil flora had already habituated\r\nus; namely, that as they have grown older, the polar regions of the\r\nearth have cooled down to a prodigious extent.\r\n\r\nIn the explanation of so curious a phenomenon, cosmologists have not\r\ntaken into account the existence of possible variations of the intensity\r\nof the solar heat; and yet the stars, those distant suns, have not the\r\nconstant brightness which the common people attribute to them. Nay, some\r\nof them have been observed to diminish in a sufficiently short space of\r\ntime to the hundredth part of their original brightness; and several\r\nhave even totally disappeared. They have preferred to attribute every\r\nthing to an internal or primitive heat with which the earth was at some\r\nformer epoch impregnated, and which is gradually being dissipated in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nUpon this hypothesis the inhabitants of the polar regions, although\r\ndeprived of the sight of the sun for whole months together, must have\r\nevidently enjoyed, at very ancient epochs, a temperature equal to that\r\nof the tropical regions, wherein exist elephants in the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, as an explanation of the existence of elephants in\r\nSiberia, that the idea of the intrinsic heat of the globe has entered\r\nfor the first time into science. Some savans had adopted it before the\r\ndiscovery of those fossil animals. Thus, Descartes was of opinion that\r\noriginally (I cite his own words,) _the earth did not differ from the\r\nsun in any other respect than in being smaller_. Upon this hypothesis,\r\nthen, it ought to be considered as an extinct sun.\r\n\r\nLeibnitz conferred upon this hypothesis the honour of appropriating it\r\nto himself. He attempted to deduce from it the mode of formation of the\r\ndifferent solid envelopes of which the earth consists. Buffon, also,\r\nimparted to it the weight of his eloquent authority. According to that\r\ngreat naturalist, the planets of our system are merely portions of the\r\nsun, which the shock of a comet had detached from it some tens of\r\nthousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nIn support of this igneous origin of the earth, Mairan and Buffon cited\r\nalready the high temperature of deep mines, and, among others, those of\r\nthe mines of Giromagny. It appears evident that if the earth was\r\nformerly incandescent, we should not fail to meet in the interior\r\nstrata, that is to say, in those which ought to have cooled last, traces\r\nof their primitive temperature. The observer who, upon penetrating into\r\nthe interior of the earth, did not find an increasing heat, might then\r\nconsider himself amply authorized to reject the hypothetical conceptions\r\nof Descartes, of Mairan, of Leibnitz, and of Buffon. But has the\r\nconverse proposition the same certainty? Would not the torrents of heat,\r\nwhich the sun has continued incessantly to launch for so many ages, have\r\ndiffused themselves into the mass of the earth, so as to produce there a\r\ntemperature increasing with the depth? This a question of high\r\nimportance. Certain easily satisfied minds conscientiously supposed that\r\nthey had solved it, when they stated that the idea of a constant\r\ntemperature was by far the _most natural_; but woe to the sciences if\r\nthey thus included vague considerations which escape all criticism,\r\namong the motives for admitting and rejecting facts and theories!\r\nFontenelle, Gentlemen, would have traced their horoscope in these words,\r\nso well adapted for humbling our pride, and the truth of which the\r\nhistory of discoveries reveals in a thousand places: \"When a thing may\r\nbe in two different ways, it is almost always that which appears at\r\nfirst the least natural.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever importance these reflections may possess, I hasten to add that,\r\ninstead of the arguments of his predecessors, which have no real value,\r\nFourier has substituted proofs, demonstrations; and we know what meaning\r\nsuch terms convey to the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nIn all places of the earth, as soon as we descend to a certain depth,\r\nthe thermometer no longer experiences either diurnal or annual\r\nvariation. It marks the same degree, and the same fraction of a degree,\r\nfrom day to day, and from year to year. Such is the fact: what says\r\ntheory?\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for a moment, that the earth has constantly received all\r\nits heat from the sun. Descend into its mass to a sufficient depth, and\r\nyou will find, with Fourier, by the aid of calculation, a constant\r\ntemperature for each day of the year. You will recognize further, that\r\nthis solar temperature of the inferior strata varies from one climate to\r\nanother; that in each country, finally, it ought to be always the same,\r\nso long as we do not descend to depths which are too great relatively to\r\nthe earth's radius.\r\n\r\nWell, the phenomena of nature stand in manifest contradiction to this\r\nresult. The observations made in a multitude of mines, observations of\r\nthe temperature of hot springs coming from different depths, have all\r\ngiven an increase of one degree of the centigrade for every twenty or\r\nthirty metres of depth. Thus, there was some inaccuracy in the\r\nhypothesis which we were discussing upon the footsteps of our colleague.\r\nIt is not true that the temperature of the terrestrial strata may be\r\nattributed solely to the action of the solar rays.\r\n\r\nThis being established, the increase of heat which is observed in all\r\nclimates when we penetrate into the interior of the globe, is the\r\nmanifest indication of an intrinsic heat. The earth, as Descartes and\r\nLeibnitz maintained it to be, but without being able to support their\r\nassertions by any demonstrative reasoning,--thanks to a combination of\r\nthe observations of physical inquirers with the analytical calculations\r\nof Fourier,--is _an encrusted sun_, the high temperature of which may be\r\nboldly invoked every time that the explanation of ancient geological\r\nphenomena will require it.\r\n\r\nAfter having established that there is in our earth an inherent heat,--a\r\nheat the source of which is not the sun, and which, if we may judge of\r\nit by the rapid increase which observation indicates, ought to be\r\nalready sufficiently intense at the depth of only seven or eight leagues\r\nto hold in fusion all known substances,--there arises the question, what\r\nis its precise value at the surface of the earth; what weight are we to\r\nattach to it in the determination of terrestrial temperatures; what part\r\ndoes it play in the phenomena of life?\r\n\r\nAccording to Mairan, Buffon, and Bailly, this part is immense. For\r\nFrance, they estimate the heat which escapes from the interior of the\r\nearth, at twenty-nine times in summer, and four hundred times in winter,\r\nthe heat which comes to us from the sun. Thus, contrary to general\r\nopinion, the heat of the body which illuminates us would form only a\r\nvery small part of that whose propitious influence we feel.\r\n\r\nThis idea was developed with ability and great eloquence in the _Memoirs\r\nof the Academy_, in the _Epoques sur la Nature_ of Buffon, in the\r\nletters from Bailly to Voltaire _upon the Origin of the Sciences and\r\nupon the Atlantide_. But the ingenious romance to which it has served as\r\na base, has vanished like a shadow before the torch of mathematical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nFourier having discovered that the excess of the aggregate temperature\r\nof the earth's surface above that which would result from the sole\r\naction of the solar rays, has a determinate relation to the increase of\r\ntemperature at different depths, succeeded in deducing from the\r\nexperimental value of this increase a numerical determination of the\r\nexcess in question. This excess is the thermometric effect which the\r\nsolar heat produces at the surface; now, instead of the large numbers\r\nadopted by Mairan, Bailly, and Buffon, what has our colleague found? _A\r\nthirtieth_ of a degree, not more.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth, which originally was perhaps incandescent, has\r\ncooled then in the course of ages, so as hardly to preserve any sensible\r\ntrace of its primitive heat. However, at great depths, the original heat\r\nis still enormous. Time will alter sensibly the internal temperature;\r\nbut at the surface (and the phenomena of the surface can alone modify or\r\ncompromise the existence of living beings), all the changes are almost\r\naccomplished. The frightful freezing of the earth, the epoch of which\r\nBuffon fixed at the instant when the central heat would be totally\r\ndissipated, is then a pure dream. At the surface, the earth is no longer\r\nimpregnated except by the solar heat. So long as the sun shall continue\r\nto preserve the same brightness, mankind will find, from pole to pole,\r\nunder each latitude, the climates which have permitted them to live and\r\nto establish their residence. These, Gentlemen, are great, magnificent\r\nresults. While recording them in the annals of science, historians will\r\nnot neglect to draw attention to this singular peculiarity: that the\r\ngeometer to whom we owe the first certain demonstration of the existence\r\nof a heat independent of a solar influence in the interior of the earth,\r\nhas annihilated the immense part which this primitive heat was made to\r\nplay in the explanation of the phenomena of terrestrial temperature.\r\n\r\nBesides divesting the theory of climates of an error which occupied a\r\nprominent place in science, supported as it was by the imposing\r\nauthority of Mairan, of Bailly, and of Buffon, Fourier is entitled to\r\nthe merit of a still more striking achievement: he has introduced into\r\nthis theory a consideration which hitherto had been totally neglected;\r\nhe has pointed out the influence exercised by the _temperature of the\r\ncelestial regions_, amid which the hearth describes its immense orb\r\naround the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen we perceive, even under the equator, certain mountains covered with\r\neternal snow, upon observing the rapid diminution of temperature which\r\nthe strata of the atmosphere undergo during ascents in balloons,\r\nmeteorologists have supposed, that in the regions wherein the extreme\r\nrarity of the air will always exclude the presence of mankind, and that\r\nespecially beyond the limits of the atmosphere, there ought to prevail a\r\nprodigious intensity of cold. It was not merely by hundreds, it was by\r\nthousands of degrees, that they had arbitrarily measured it. But, as\r\nusual, the imagination (_cette folie de la maison_) had exceeded all\r\nreasonable limits. The hundreds, the tens of thousands of degrees, have\r\ndwindled down, after the rigorous researches of Fourier, to fifty or\r\nsixty degrees only. Fifty or sixty degrees _beneath zero_, such is the\r\ntemperature which the radiation of heat from the stars has established\r\nin the regions furrowed indefinitely by the planets of our system.\r\n\r\nYou recollect, Gentlemen, with what delight Fourier used to converse on\r\nthis subject. You know well that he thought himself sure of having\r\nassigned the temperature of space within eight or ten degrees. By what\r\nfatality has it happened that the memoir, wherein no doubt our colleague\r\nhad recorded all the elements of that important determination, is not to\r\nbe found? May that irreparable loss prove at least to so many observers,\r\nthat instead of pursuing obstinately an ideal perfection, which it is\r\nnot allotted to man to attain, they will act wisely in placing the\r\npublic, as soon as possible, in the confidence of their labours.\r\n\r\nI should have yet a long course to pursue, if, after having pointed out\r\nsome of those problems of which the condition of science enabled our\r\nlearned colleague to give numerical solutions, I were to analyze all\r\nthose which, still enveloped in general formulæ, await merely the data\r\nof experience to assume a place among the most curious acquisitions of\r\nmodern physics. Time, which is not at my disposal, precludes me from\r\ndwelling upon such developments. I should be guilty, however, of an\r\nunpardonable omission, if I did not state that, among the formulas of\r\nFourier, there is one which serves to assign the value of the secular\r\ncooling of the earth, and in which there is involved the number of\r\ncenturies which have elapsed since the origin of this cooling. The\r\nquestion of the antiquity of the earth, including even the period of\r\nincandescence, which has been so keenly discussed, is thus reduced to a\r\nthermometric determination. Unfortunately this point of theory is\r\nsubject to serious difficulties. Besides, the thermometric\r\ndetermination, in consequence of its excessive smallness, must be\r\nreserved for future ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN OF NAPOLEON FROM ELBA.--FOURIER PREFECT OF THE RHONE.--HIS\r\nNOMINATION TO THE OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD OF STATISTICS OF THE\r\nSEINE.\r\n\r\nI have just exhibited to you the scientific fruits of the leisure hours\r\nof the Prefect of l'Isère. Fourier still occupied this situation when\r\nNapoleon arrived at Cannes. His conduct during this grave conjuncture\r\nhas been the object of a hundred false rumours. I shall then discharge a\r\nduty by establishing the facts in all their truth, according to what I\r\nhave heard from our colleague's own mouth.\r\n\r\nUpon the news of the Emperor having disembarked, the principal\r\nauthorities of Grenoble assembled at the residence of the Prefect. There\r\neach individual explained ably, but especially, said Fourier, with much\r\ndetail, the difficulties which he perceived. As regards the means of\r\nvanquishing them, the authorities seemed to be much less inventive.\r\nConfidence in administrative eloquence was not yet worn out at that\r\nepoch; it was resolved accordingly to have recourse to proclamations.\r\nThe commanding officer and the Prefect presented each a project. The\r\nassembly was discussing minutely the terms of them, when an officer of\r\nthe gendarmes, an old soldier of the Imperial armies, exclaimed rudely,\r\n\"Gentlemen, be quick, otherwise all deliberation will become useless.\r\nBelieve me, I speak from experience; Napoleon always follows very\r\nclosely the couriers who announce his arrival.\" Napoleon was in fact\r\nclose at hand. After a short moment of hesitation, two companies of\r\nsappers which had been dispatched to cut down a bridge, joined their\r\nformer commander. A battalion of infantry soon followed their example.\r\nFinally, upon the very glacis of the fortress, in presence of the\r\nnumerous population which crowned the ramparts, the fifth regiment of\r\nthe line to a man assumed the tricolour cockade, substituted for the\r\nwhite flag the eagle,--witness of twenty battles,--which it had\r\npreserved, and departed with shouts of _Vive l'Empereur!_ After such a\r\ncommencement, to attempt to hold the country would have been an act of\r\nfolly. General Marchand caused accordingly the gates of the city to be\r\nshut. He still hoped, notwithstanding the evidently hostile disposition\r\nof the inhabitants, to sustain a siege with the sole assistance of the\r\nthird regiment of engineers, the fourth regiment of artillery, and some\r\nweak detachments of infantry, which had not abandoned him.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, the civil authority had disappeared. Fourier thought\r\nthen that he might quit Grenoble, and repair to Lyons, where the princes\r\nhad assembled together. At the second restoration, this departure was\r\nimputed to him as a crime. He was very near being brought before a court\r\nof assizes, or even a provost's court. Certain personages pretended that\r\nthe presence of the Prefect of the chief place of l'Isère might have\r\nconjured the storm; that the resistance might have been more animated,\r\nbetter arranged. People forgot that nowhere, and at Grenoble even less\r\nthan anywhere else, was it possible to organize even a pretext of\r\nresistance. Let us see then, finally, how this martial city,--the fall\r\nof which Fourier might have prevented by his mere presence,--let us see\r\nhow it was taken. It is eight o'clock in the evening. The inhabitants\r\nand the soldiers garrison the ramparts. Napoleon precedes his little\r\ntroop by some steps; he advances even to the gate; he knocks (be not\r\nalarmed, Gentlemen, it is not a battle which I am about to describe,)\r\n_he knocks with his snuff-box!_ \"Who is there?\" cried the officer of the\r\nguard. \"It is the Emperor! Open!\"--\"Sire, my duty forbids me.\"--\"Open--I\r\ntell you; I have no time to lose.\"--\"But, sire, even though I should\r\nopen to you, I could not. The keys are in the possession of General\r\nMarchand.\"--\"Go, then, and fetch them.\"--\"I am certain that he will\r\nrefuse them to me.\"--\"If the General refuse them, _tell him that I will\r\ndismiss him_.\"\r\n\r\nThese words petrified the soldiers. During the previous two days,\r\nhundreds of proclamations designated Bonaparte as a wild beast which it\r\nwas necessary to seize without scruple; they ordered everybody to run\r\naway from him, and yet this man threatened the general with deprivation\r\nof his command! The single word _dismissal_, effaced the faint line of\r\ndemarcation which separated for an instant the old soldiers from the\r\nyoung recruits; one word established the whole garrison in the interest\r\nof the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the capture of Grenoble were not yet known when\r\nFourier arrived at Lyons. He brought thither the news of the rapid\r\nadvance of Napoleon; that of the revolt of two companies of sappers, of\r\na regiment of infantry, and of the regiment commanded by Labédoyère.\r\nMoreover, he was a witness of the lively sympathy which the country\r\npeople along the whole route displayed in favour of the proscribed exile\r\nof Elba.\r\n\r\nThe Count d'Artois gave a very cold reception to the Prefect and his\r\ncommunications. He declared that the arrival of Napoleon at Grenoble was\r\nimpossible; that no alarm need be apprehended respecting the disposition\r\nof the country people. \"As regards the facts,\" said he to Fourier,\r\n\"which would seem to have occurred in your presence at the very gates of\r\nthe city, with respect to the tricoloured cockades substituted for the\r\ncockade of Henry IV., with respect to the eagles which you say have\r\nreplaced the white flag, I do not suspect your good faith, but the\r\nuneasy state of your mind must have dazzled your eyes. Prefect, return\r\nthen without delay to Grenoble; you will answer for the city with your\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, Gentlemen, after having so long proclaimed the necessity of\r\ntelling the truth to princes, moralists will act wisely by inviting\r\nprinces to be good enough to listen to its language.\r\n\r\nFourier obeyed the order which had just been given him. The wheels of\r\nhis carriage had made only a few revolutions in the direction of\r\nGrenoble, when he was arrested by hussars, and conducted to the\r\nhead-quarters at Bourgoin. The Emperor, who was engaged in examining a\r\nlarge chart with a pair of compasses, said, upon seeing him enter:\r\n\"Well, Prefect, you also have declared war against me?\"--\"Sire, my oath\r\nof allegiance made it my duty to do so!\"--\"A duty you say? and do you\r\nnot see that in Dauphiny nobody is of the same mind? Do not imagine,\r\nhowever, that your plan of the campaign will frighten me much. It only\r\ngrieved me to see among my enemies an _Egyptian_, a man who had eaten\r\nalong with me the bread of the bivouac, an old friend!\"\r\n\r\nIt is painful to add that to those kind words succeeded these also:\r\n\"How, moreover, could you have forgotten, Monsieur Fourier, that I have\r\nmade you what you are?\"\r\n\r\nYou will regret with me, Gentlemen, that a timidity, which circumstances\r\nwould otherwise easily explain, should have prevented our colleague from\r\nat once emphatically protesting against this confusion, which the\r\npowerful of the earth are constantly endeavouring to establish between\r\nthe perishable bounties of which they are the dispensers, and the noble\r\nfruits of thought. Fourier was Prefect and Baron by the favour of the\r\nEmperor; he was one of the glories of France by his own genius!\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of March, Napoleon, in a moment of anger, ordered Fourier, by\r\na mandate, dated from Grenoble, _to quit the territory of the seventh\r\nmilitary division within five days, under pain of being arrested and\r\ntreated as an enemy of the country!_ On the following day, our colleague\r\ndeparted from the Conference of Bourgoin, with the appointment of\r\nPrefect of the Rhone and the title of _Count_, for the Emperor after his\r\nreturn from Elba was again at his old practices.\r\n\r\nThese unexpected proofs of favour and confidence afforded little\r\npleasure to our colleague, but he dared not refuse them, although he\r\nperceived very distinctly the immense gravity of the events in which he\r\nwas led by the vicissitude of fortune to play a part.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of my enterprise?\" said the Emperor to him on the day\r\nof his departure from Lyons. \"Sire,\" replied Fourier, \"I am of opinion\r\nthat you will fail. Let but a fanatic meet you on your way, and all is\r\nat an end.\"--\"Bah!\" exclaimed Napoleon, \"the Bourbons have nobody on\r\ntheir side, not even a fanatic. In connection with this circumstance,\r\nyou have read in the journals that they have excluded me from the\r\nprotection of the law. I shall be more indulgent on my part; I shall\r\ncontent myself with excluding them from the Tuileries.\"\r\n\r\nFourier held the appointment of Prefect of the Rhone only till the 1st\r\nof May. It has been alleged that he was recalled, because he refused to\r\nbe accessory to the deeds of terrorism which the minister of the hundred\r\ndays enjoined him to execute. The Academy will always be pleased when I\r\ncollect together, and place on record, actions which, while honouring\r\nits members, throw new lustre around the entire body. I even feel that,\r\nin such a case, I may be disposed to be somewhat credulous. On the\r\npresent occasion, it was imperatively necessary to institute a most\r\nrigorous examination. If Fourier honoured himself by refusing to obey\r\ncertain orders, what are we to think of the minister of the interior\r\nfrom whom those orders emanated? Now this minister, it must not be\r\nforgotten, was also an academician, illustrious by his military\r\nservices, distinguished by his mathematical works, esteemed and\r\ncherished by all his colleagues. Well! I declare, Gentlemen, with a\r\nsatisfaction which you will all share, that a most scrupulous\r\ninvestigation of all the acts of the hundred days has not disclosed a\r\ntrace of anything which might detract from the feelings of admiration\r\nwith which the memory of Carnot is associated in your minds.\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the Prefecture of the Rhone, Fourier repaired to Paris.\r\nThe Emperor, who was then upon the eve of setting out to join the army,\r\nperceiving him amid the crowd at the Tuileries, accosted him in a\r\nfriendly manner, informed him that Carnot would explain to him why his\r\ndisplacement at Lyons had become indispensable, and promised to attend\r\nto his interest as soon as military affairs would allow him some leisure\r\ntime. The second restoration found Fourier in the capital without\r\nemployment, and justly anxious with respect to the future. He, who,\r\nduring a period of fifteen years, administered the affairs of a great\r\ndepartment; who directed works of such an expensive nature; who, in the\r\naffair of the marshes of Bourgoin, had to contract engagements for so\r\nmany millions, with private individuals, with the communes and with\r\npublic companies, had not _twenty thousand francs_ in his possession.\r\nThis honourable poverty, as well as the recollection of glorious and\r\nimportant services, was little calculated to make an impression upon\r\nministers influenced by political passion, and subject to the capricious\r\ninterference of foreigners. A demand for a pension was accordingly\r\nrepelled with rudeness. Be reassured, however, France will not have to\r\nblush for having left in poverty one of her principal ornaments. The\r\nPrefect of Paris,--I have committed a mistake, Gentlemen, a proper name\r\nwill not be out of place here,--M. Chabrol, learns that his old\r\nprofessor at the Polytechnic School, that the Perpetual Secretary of the\r\nInstitute of Egypt, that the author of the _Théorie Analytique de la\r\nChaleur_, was reduced, in order to obtain the means of living, to give\r\nprivate lessons at the residences of his pupils. The idea of this\r\nrevolts him. He accordingly shows himself deaf to the clamours of party,\r\nand Fourier receives from him the superior direction of the _Bureau de\r\nla Statistique_ of the Seine, with a salary of 6,000 francs. It has\r\nappeared to me, Gentlemen, that I ought not to suppress these details.\r\nScience may show herself grateful towards all those who give her support\r\nand protection, when there is some danger in doing so, without fearing\r\nthat the burden should ever become too heavy.\r\n\r\nFourier responded worthily to the confidence reposed in him by M. de\r\nChabrol. The memoirs with which he enriched the interesting volumes\r\npublished by the Prefecture of the Seine, will serve henceforth as a\r\nguide to all those who have the good sense to see in statistics,\r\nsomething else than an indigestible mass of figures and tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTRANCE OF FOURIER INTO THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.--HIS ELECTION TO THE\r\nOFFICE OF PERPETUAL SECRETARY.--HIS ADMISSION TO THE FRENCH ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences seized the first occasion which offered itself\r\nto attach Fourier to its interests. On the 27th of May, 1816, he was\r\nnominated a free academician. This election was not confirmed. The\r\nsolicitations and influence of the Dauphin whom circumstances detained\r\nat Paris, had almost disarmed the authorities, when a courtier exclaimed\r\nthat an amnesty was to be granted to _the civil Labédoyère!_[41] This\r\nword,--for during many ages past the poor human race has been governed\r\nby words,--decided the fate of our colleague. Thanks to political\r\nintrigue, the ministers of Louis XVIII. decided that one of the most\r\nlearned men of France should not belong to the Academy; that a citizen\r\nwho enjoyed the friendship of all the most distinguished persons in the\r\nmetropolis, should be publicly stricken with disapprobation!\r\n\r\nIn our country, the reign of absurdity does not last long. Accordingly\r\nin 1817, when the Academy, without being discouraged by the ill success\r\nof its first attempt, unanimously nominated Fourier to the place which\r\nhad just been vacant in the section of physics, the royal confirmation\r\nwas accorded without difficulty. I ought to add that soon afterwards,\r\nthe ruling authorities whose repugnances were entirely dissipated,\r\nfrankly and unreservedly applauded the happy choice which you made of\r\nthe learned geometer to replace Delambre as perpetual secretary. They\r\neven went so far as to offer him the Directorship of the Fine Arts; but\r\nour colleague had the good sense to refuse the appointment.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Lémontey, the French Academy, where Laplace and Cuvier\r\nalready represented the sciences, called also Fourier into its bosom.\r\nThe literary titles of the most eloquent of the writers connected with\r\nthe work on Egypt were incontestable; they even were not contested, and\r\nstill this nomination excited violent discussions in the journals, which\r\nprofoundly grieved our colleague. And yet after all, was it not a fit\r\nsubject for discussion, whether, these double nominations are of any\r\nreal utility? Might it not be maintained, without incurring the reproach\r\nof paradox, that it extinguishes in youth an emulation which we are\r\nbound by every consideration to encourage? Besides, with double, triple,\r\nand quadruple academicians, what would eventually become of the justly\r\nboasted unity of the Institute? Without insisting further on these\r\nremarks, the justness of which you will admit if I mistake not, I hasten\r\nto repeat that the academic titles of Fourier did not form even the\r\nsubject of a doubt. The applause which was lavished upon the eloquent\r\néloges of Delambre, of Bréguet, of Charles, and of Herschel, would\r\nsufficiently evince that, if their author had not been already one of\r\nthe most distinguished members of the Academy of Sciences, the public\r\nwould have invited him to assume a place among the judges of French\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[41] In allusion to the _military_ traitor Colonel Labédoyère, who was\r\ncondemned to death for espousing the cause of Napoleon.--_Translator_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF FOURIER.--HIS DEATH.\r\n\r\nRestored at length, after so many vicissitudes, to his favourite\r\npursuits, Fourier passed the last years of his life in retirement and\r\nin the discharge of academic duties. _To converse_ had become the half\r\nof his existence. Those who have been disposed to consider this the\r\nsubject of just reproach, have no doubt forgotten that constant\r\nreflection is no less imperiously forbidden to man than the abuse of\r\nphysical powers. Repose, in every thing, recruits our frail machine;\r\nbut, Gentlemen, he who desires repose may not obtain it. Interrogate\r\nyour own recollections and say, if, when you are pursuing a new truth, a\r\nwalk, the intercourse of society, or even sleep, have the privilege of\r\ndistracting you from the object of your thoughts? The extremely\r\nshattered state of Fourier's health enjoined the most careful attention.\r\nAfter many attempts, he only found one means of escaping from the\r\ncontentions of mind which exhausted him: this consisted in speaking\r\naloud upon the events of his life; upon his scientific labours, which\r\nwere either in course of being planned, or which were already\r\nterminated; upon the acts of injustice of which he had reason to\r\ncomplain. Every person must have remarked, how insignificant was the\r\nstate which our gifted colleague assigned to those who were in the habit\r\nof conversing with him; we are now acquainted with the cause of this.\r\n\r\nFourier had preserved, in old age, the grace, the urbanity, the varied\r\nknowledge which, a quarter of a century previously, had imparted so\r\ngreat a charm to his lectures at the Polytechnic School. There was a\r\npleasure in hearing him relate the anecdote which the listener already\r\nknew by heart, even the events in which the individual had taken a\r\ndirect part. I happened to be a witness of the kind of _fascination_\r\nwhich he exercised upon his audience, in connection with an incident\r\nwhich deserves to be known, for it will prove that the word which I have\r\njust employed is not in anywise exaggerated.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves seated at the same table. The guest from whom I\r\nseparated him was an old officer. Our colleague was informed of this,\r\nand the question, \"Have you been in Egypt?\" served as the commencement\r\nof a conversation between them. The reply was in the affirmative.\r\nFourier hastened to add: \"As regards myself, I remained in that\r\nmagnificent country until the period of its complete evacuation.\r\nAlthough foreign to the profession of arms, I have, in the midst of our\r\nsoldiers, fired against the insurgents of Cairo; I have had the honour\r\nof hearing the cannon of Heliopolis.\" Hence to give an account of the\r\nbattle was but a step. This step was soon made, and we were presented\r\nwith four battalions drawn up in squares in the plain of Quoubbéh, and\r\nmanoeuvring, with admirable precision, conformably to the orders of\r\nthe illustrious geometer. My neighbour, with attentive ear, with\r\nimmovable eyes, and with outstretched neck, listened to this recital\r\nwith the liveliest interest. He did not lose a single syllable of it:\r\none would have sworn that he had for the first time heard of those\r\nmemorable events. Gentlemen, it is so delightful a task to please! After\r\nhaving remarked the effect which he produced, Fourier reverted, with\r\nstill greater detail, to the principal fight of those great days: to the\r\ncapture of the fortified village of Mattaryeh, to the passage of two\r\nfeeble columns of French grenadiers across ditches heaped up with the\r\ndead and wounded of the Ottoman army. \"Generals ancient and modern, have\r\nsometimes spoken of similar deeds of prowess,\" exclaimed our colleague,\r\n\"but it was in the hyperbolic style of the bulletin: here the fact is\r\nmaterially true,--it is true like geometry. I feel conscious, however,\"\r\nadded he, \"that in order to induce your belief in it, all my assurances\r\nwill not be more than sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be anxious upon this point,\" replied the officer, who at that\r\nmoment seemed to awaken from a long dream. \"In case of necessity, I\r\nmight guarantee the accuracy of your statement. It was I who, at the\r\nhead of the grenadiers of the 13th and 85th semi-brigades, forced the\r\nentrenchments of Mattaryeh, by passing over the dead bodies of the\r\nJanissaries!\"\r\n\r\nMy neighbour was General Tarayre: you may imagine much better than I can\r\nexpress, the effect of the few words which had just escaped from him.\r\nFourier made a thousand excuses, while I reflected upon the seductive\r\ninfluence, upon the power of language, which for more than half an hour\r\nhad robbed the celebrated general even of the recollection of the part\r\nwhich he had played in the battle of giants he was listening to.\r\n\r\nThe more our secretary had occasion to converse, the greater repugnance\r\nhe experienced to verbal discussions. Fourier cut short every debate as\r\nsoon as there presented itself a somewhat marked difference of opinion,\r\nonly to resume afterwards the same subject upon the modest pretext of\r\nmaking a small step in advance each time. Some one asked Fontaine, a\r\ncelebrated geometer of this Academy, how he occupied his thoughts in\r\nsociety, wherein he maintained an almost absolute silence: \"I observe,\"\r\nhe replied, \"the vanity of mankind, to wound it as occasion offers.\" If,\r\nlike his predecessor, Fourier also studied the baser passions which\r\ncontend for honours, riches, and power, it was not in order to engage in\r\nhostilities with them: resolved never to compromise matters with them,\r\nhe yet so calculated his movements beforehand, as not to find himself in\r\ntheir way. We perceive a wide difference between this disposition and\r\nthe ardent impetuous character of the young orator of the popular\r\nsociety of Auxerre. But what purpose would philosophy serve, if it did\r\nnot teach us to conquer our passions? It is not that occasionally the\r\nnatural disposition of Fourier did not display itself in full relief.\r\n\"It is strange,\" said one day a certain very influential personage of\r\nthe court of Charles X., whom Fourier's servant would not allow to pass\r\nbeyond the antechamber of our colleague,--\"it is truly strange that your\r\nmaster should be more difficult of access than a minister!\" Fourier\r\nheard the conversation, leaped out of his bed to which he was confined\r\nby indisposition, opened the door of the chamber, and exclaimed, face to\r\nface with the courtier: \"Joseph, tell Monsieur, that if I was minister,\r\nI should receive everybody, because it would be my duty to do so; but,\r\nbeing a private individual, I receive whomsoever I please, and at what\r\nhour soever I please!\" Disconcerted by the liveliness of the retort, the\r\ngreat seignior did not utter one word in reply. We must even believe\r\nthat from that moment he resolved not to visit any but ministers, for\r\nthe plain man of science heard nothing more of him.\r\n\r\nFourier was endowed with a constitution which held forth a promise of\r\nlong life; but what can natural advantages avail against the\r\nanti-hygienic habits which men arbitrarily acquire! In order to guard\r\nagainst slight attacks of rheumatism, our colleague was in the habit of\r\nclothing himself, even in the hottest season of the year, after a\r\nfashion which is not practised even by travellers condemned to spend the\r\nwinter amid the snows of the polar regions. \"One would suppose me to be\r\ncorpulent,\" he used to say occasionally with a smile; \"be assured,\r\nhowever, that there is much to deduct from this opinion. If, after the\r\nexample of the Egyptian mummies, I was subjected to the operation of\r\ndisembowelment,--from which heaven preserve me,--the residue would be\r\nfound to be a very slender body.\" I might add, selecting also my\r\ncomparison from the banks of the Nile, that in the apartments of\r\nFourier, which were always of small extent, and intensely heated even in\r\nsummer, the currents of air to which one was exposed resembled sometimes\r\nthe terrible simoon, that burning wind of the desert, which the caravans\r\ndread as much as the plague.\r\n\r\nThe prescriptions of medicine which, in the mouth of M. Larrey, were\r\nblended with the anxieties of a long and constant friendship, failed to\r\ninduce a modification of of this mortal régime. Fourier had already\r\nexperienced, in Egypt and Grenoble, some attacks of aneurism of the\r\nheart. At Paris, it was impossible to be mistaken with respect to the\r\nprimary cause of the frequent suffocations which he experienced. A fall,\r\nhowever, which he sustained on the 4th of May, 1830, while descending a\r\nflight of stairs, aggravated the malady to an extent beyond what could\r\nhave been ever feared. Our colleague, notwithstanding pressing\r\nsolicitations, persisted in refusing to combat the most threatening\r\nsymptoms, except by the aid of patience and a high temperature. On the\r\n16th of May, 1830, about four o'clock in the evening, Fourier\r\nexperienced in his study a violent crisis the serious nature of which he\r\nwas far from being sensible of; for, having thrown himself completely\r\ndressed upon his bed, he requested M. Petit, a young doctor of his\r\nacquaintance who carefully attended him, not to go far away, in order,\r\nsaid he, that we may presently converse together. But to these words\r\nsucceeded soon the cries, \"Quick, quick! some vinegar! I am fainting!\"\r\nand one of the men of science who has shed the brightest lustre upon the\r\nAcademy had ceased to live.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this cruel event is too recent, that I should recall here\r\nthe grief which the Institute experienced upon losing one of its most\r\nimportant members; and those obsequies, on the occasion of which so many\r\npersons, usually divided by interests and opinions, united together, in\r\none common feeling of admiration and regret, around the mortal remains\r\nof Fourier; and the Polytechnic School swelling in a mass the cortége,\r\nin order to render homage to one of its earliest, of its most celebrated\r\nprofessors; and the words which, on the brink of the tomb, depicted so\r\neloquently the profound mathematician, the elegant writer, the upright\r\nadministrator, the good citizen, the devoted friend. We shall merely\r\nstate that Fourier belonged to all the great learned societies of the\r\nworld, that they united with the most touching unanimity in the mourning\r\nof the Academy, in the mourning of all France: a striking testimony that\r\nthe republic of letters is no longer, in the present day, merely a vain\r\nname! What, then, was wanting to the memory of our colleague? A more\r\nable successor than I have been to exhibit in full relief the different\r\nphases of a life so varied, so laborious, so gloriously interlaced with\r\nthe greatest events of the most memorable epochs of our history.\r\nFortunately, the scientific discoveries of the illustrious secretary had\r\nnothing to dread from the incompetency of the panegyrist. My object will\r\nhave been completely attained if, notwithstanding the imperfection of my\r\nsketches, each of you will have learned that the progress of general\r\nphysics, of terrestrial physics, and of geology, will daily multiply the\r\nfertile applications of the _Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur_, and that\r\nthis work will transmit the name of Fourier down to the remotest\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n»»Any books in this list will be sent free of\r\npostage, on receipt of price.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, 135 WASHINGTON STREET\r\nJANUARY, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF BOOKS\r\n\r\npublished by\r\n\r\nTICKNOR AND FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED HOUSEHOLD EDITION OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS.
