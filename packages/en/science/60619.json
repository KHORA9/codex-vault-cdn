I.\r\n\r\n                       _Of Astronomy in general._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The general use of Astronomy.]\r\n\r\n1. Of all the sciences cultivated by mankind, Astronomy is acknowledged\r\nto be, and undoubtedly is, the most sublime, the most interesting, and\r\nthe most useful. For, by knowledge derived from this science, not only\r\nthe bulk of the Earth is discovered, the situation and extent of the\r\ncountries and kingdoms upon it ascertained, trade and commerce carried\r\non to the remotest parts of the world, and the various products of\r\nseveral countries distributed for the health, comfort, and conveniency\r\nof its inhabitants; but our very faculties are enlarged with the\r\ngrandeur of the ideas it conveys, our minds exalted above the low\r\ncontracted prejudices of the vulgar, and our understandings clearly\r\nconvinced, and affected with the conviction, of the existence, wisdom,\r\npower, goodness, and superintendency of the SUPREME BEING! So that\r\nwithout an hyperbole,\r\n\r\n                 “_An undevout Astronomer is mad_[1].”\r\n\r\n2. From this branch of knowledge we also learn by what means or laws the\r\nAlmighty carries on, and continues the admirable harmony, order, and\r\nconnexion observable throughout the planetary system; and are led by\r\nvery powerful arguments to form the pleasing deduction, that minds\r\ncapable of such deep researches not only derive their origin from that\r\nadorable Being, but are also incited to aspire after a more perfect\r\nknowledge of his nature, and a stricter conformity to his will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth but a point as seen from the Sun.]\r\n\r\n3. By Astronomy we discover that the Earth is at so great a distance\r\nfrom the Sun, that if seen from thence it would appear no bigger than a\r\npoint; although it’s circumference is known to be 25,020 miles. Yet that\r\ndistance is so small, compared with the distance of the Fixed Stars,\r\nthat if the Orbit in which the Earth moves round the Sun were solid, and\r\nseen from the nearest Star, it would likewise appear no bigger than a\r\npoint, although it is at least 162 millions of miles in diameter. For\r\nthe Earth in going round the Sun is 162 millions of miles nearer to some\r\nof the Stars at one time of the year than at another; and yet their\r\napparent magnitudes, situations, and distances from one another still\r\nremain the same; and a telescope which magnifies above 200 times does\r\nnot sensibly magnify them: which proves them to be at least 400 thousand\r\ntimes farther from us than we are from the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stars are Suns.]\r\n\r\n4. It is not to be imagined that all the Stars are placed in one concave\r\nsurface, so as to be equally distant from us; but that they are\r\nscattered at immense distances from one another through unlimited space.\r\nSo that there may be as great a distance between any two neighbouring\r\nStars, as between our Sun and those which are nearest to him. Therefore\r\nan Observer, who is nearest any fixed Star, will look upon it alone as a\r\nreal Sun; and consider the rest as so many shining points, placed at\r\nequal distances from him in the Firmament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And innumerable.]\r\n\r\n5. By the help of telescopes we discover thousands of Stars which are\r\ninvisible to the naked eye; and the better our glasses are, still the\r\nmore become visible: so that we can set no limits either to their number\r\nor their distances. The celebrated HUYGENS carries his thoughts so far,\r\nas to believe it not impossible that there may be Stars at such\r\ninconceivable distances, that their light has not yet reached the Earth\r\nsince it’s creation; although the velocity of light be a million of\r\ntimes greater than the velocity of a cannon bullet, as shall be\r\ndemonstrated afterwards § 197, 216: and, as Mr. ADDISON very justly\r\nobserves, this thought is far from being extravagant, when we consider\r\nthat the Universe is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite\r\ngoodness; having an infinite space to exert itself in; so that our\r\nimaginations can set no bounds to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Sun appears bigger than the Stars.]\r\n\r\n6. The Sun appears very bright and large in comparison of the Fixed\r\nStars, because we keep constantly near the Sun, in comparison of our\r\nimmense distance from the Stars. For, a spectator, placed as near to any\r\nStar as we are to the Sun, would see that Star a body as large and\r\nbright as the Sun appears to us: and a spectator, as far distant from\r\nthe Sun as we are from the Stars, would see the Sun as small as we see a\r\nStar, divested of all its circumvolving Planets; and would reckon it one\r\nof the Stars in numbering them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stars are not enlightened by the Sun.]\r\n\r\n7. The Stars, being at such immense distances from the Sun, cannot\r\npossibly receive from him so strong a light as they seem to have; nor\r\nany brightness sufficient to make them visible to us. For the Sun’s rays\r\nmust be so scattered and dissipated before they reach such remote\r\nobjects, that they can never be transmitted back to our eyes, so as to\r\nrender these objects visible by reflection. The Stars therefore shine\r\nwith their own native and unborrowed lustre, as the Sun does; and since\r\neach particular Star, as well as the Sun, is confined to a particular\r\nportion of space, ’tis plain that the Stars are of the same nature with\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They are probably surrounded by Planets.]\r\n\r\n8. It is no ways probable that the Almighty, who always acts with\r\ninfinite wisdom and does nothing in vain, should create so many glorious\r\nSuns, fit for so many important purposes, and place them at such\r\ndistances from one another, without proper objects near enough to be\r\nbenefited by their influences. Whoever imagines they were created only\r\nto give a faint glimmering light to the inhabitants of this Globe, must\r\nhave a very superficial knowledge of Astronomy, and a mean opinion of\r\nthe Divine Wisdom: since, by an infinitely less exertion of creating\r\npower, the Deity could have given our Earth much more light by one\r\nsingle additional Moon.\r\n\r\n9. Instead then of one Sun and one World only in the Universe, as the\r\nunskilful in Astronomy imagine, _that_ Science discovers to us such an\r\ninconceivable number of Suns, Systems, and Worlds, dispersed through\r\nboundless Space, that if our Sun, with all the Planets, Moons, and\r\nComets belonging to it were annihilated, they would be no more missed\r\nout of the Creation than a grain of sand from the sea-shore. The space\r\nthey possess being comparatively so small, that it would scarce be a\r\nsensible blank in the Universe; although Saturn, the outermost of our\r\nplanets, revolves about the Sun in an Orbit of 4884 millions of miles in\r\ncircumference, and some of our Comets make excursions upwards of ten\r\nthousand millions of miles beyond Saturn’s Orbit; and yet, at that\r\namazing distance, they are incomparably nearer to the Sun than to any of\r\nthe Stars; as is evident from their keeping clear of the attractive\r\nPower of all the Stars, and returning periodically by virtue of the\r\nSun’s attraction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The stellar Planets may be habitable.]\r\n\r\n10. From what we know of our own System it may be reasonably concluded\r\nthat all the rest are with equal wisdom contrived, situated, and\r\nprovided with accommodations for rational inhabitants. Let us therefore\r\ntake a survey of the System to which we belong; the only one accessible\r\nto us; and from thence we shall be the better enabled to judge of the\r\nnature and end of the other Systems of the Universe. For although there\r\nis almost an infinite variety in all the parts of the Creation which we\r\nhave opportunities of examining; yet there is a general analogy running\r\nthrough and connecting all the parts into one scheme, one design, one\r\nwhole!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As our Solar Planets are.]\r\n\r\n11. And then, to an attentive considerer, it will appear highly\r\nprobable, that the Planets of our System, together with their attendants\r\ncalled Satellites or Moons, are much of the same nature with our Earth,\r\nand destined for the like purposes. For, they are solid opaque Globes,\r\ncapable of supporting animals and vegetables. Some of them are bigger,\r\nsome less, and some much about the size of our Earth. They all circulate\r\nround the Sun, as the Earth does, in a shorter or longer time according\r\nto their respective distances from him: and have, where it would not be\r\ninconvenient, regular returns of summer and winter, spring and autumn.\r\nThey have warmer and colder climates, as the various productions of our\r\nEarth require: and, in such as afford a possibility of discovering it,\r\nwe observe a regular motion round their Axes like that of our Earth,\r\ncausing an alternate return of day and night; which is necessary for\r\nlabour, rest, and vegetation, and that all parts of their surfaces may\r\nbe exposed to the rays of the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The farthest from the Sun have most Moons to enlighten their\r\n           nights.]\r\n\r\n12. Such of the Planets as are farthest from the Sun, and therefore\r\nenjoy least of his light, have that deficiency made up by several Moons,\r\nwhich constantly accompany, and revolve about them, as our Moon revolves\r\nabout the Earth. The remotest Planet has, over and above, a broad Ring\r\nencompassing it; which like a lucid Zone in the Heavens reflects the\r\nSun’s light very copiously on that Planet: so that if the remoter\r\nPlanets have the Sun’s light fainter by day than we, they have an\r\naddition made to it morning and evening by one or more of their Moons,\r\nand a greater quantity of light in the night-time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our Moon mountainous like the Earth.]\r\n\r\n13. On the surface of the Moon, because it is nearer us than any other\r\nof the celestial Bodies are, we discover a nearer resemblance of our\r\nEarth. For, by the assistance of telescopes we observe the Moon to be\r\nfull of high mountains, large valleys, and deep cavities. These\r\nsimilarities leave us no room to doubt but that all the Planets and\r\nMoons in the System are designed as commodious habitations for creatures\r\nendowed with capacities of knowing and adoring their beneficent Creator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n_J.

Since the Fixed Stars are prodigious spheres of fire, like our Sun,\r\nand at inconceivable distances from one another, as well as from us, it\r\nis reasonable to conclude they are made for the same purposes that the\r\nSun is; each to bestow light, heat, and vegetation on a certain number\r\nof inhabited Planets, kept by gravitation within the sphere of it’s\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Numberless Suns and Worlds.]\r\n\r\n15. What an august! what an amazing conception, if human imagination can\r\nconceive it, does this give of the works of the Creator! Thousands of\r\nthousands of Suns, multiplied without end, and ranged all around us, at\r\nimmense distances from each other, attended by ten thousand times ten\r\nthousand Worlds, all in rapid motion, yet calm, regular, and harmonious,\r\ninvariably keeping the paths prescribed them; and these Worlds peopled\r\nwith myriads of intelligent beings, formed for endless progression in\r\nperfection and felicity.\r\n\r\n16. If so much power, wisdom, goodness, and magnificence is displayed in\r\nthe material Creation, which is the least considerable part of the\r\nUniverse, how great, how wise, how good must HE be, who made and governs\r\nthe Whole!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. II.\r\n\r\n               _A brief Description of the_ SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE I. Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n           The Solar System.]\r\n\r\n17. The Planets and Comets which move round the Sun as their center,\r\nconstitute the Solar System. Those Planets which are nearer the Sun not\r\nonly finish their circuits sooner, but likewise move faster in their\r\nrespective Orbits than those which are more remote from him. Their\r\nmotions are all performed from west to east, in Orbits nearly circular.\r\nTheir names, distances, bulks, and periodical revolutions, are as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun.]\r\n\r\n18. The SUN ☉, an immense globe of fire, is placed near the common\r\ncenter, or rather in the lower[2] focus, of the Orbits of all the\r\nPlanets and Comets[3]; and turns round his axis in 25 days 6 hours, as\r\nis evident by the motion of spots seen on his surface. His diameter is\r\ncomputed to be 763,000 miles; and, by the various attractions of the\r\ncircumvolving Planets, he is agitated by a small motion round the center\r\nof gravity of the System. All the Planets, as seen from him, move the\r\nsame way, and according to the order of Signs in the graduated Circle ♈\r\n♉ ♎ ♋ &c. which represents the great Ecliptic in the Heavens: but, as\r\nseen from any one Planet, the rest appear sometimes to go backward,\r\nsometimes forward, and sometimes to stand still; not in circles nor\r\nellipses, but in[4] looped curves which never return into themselves.\r\nThe Comets come from all parts of the Heavens, and move in all sorts of\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE I. Fig. I. The Sun.\r\n\r\n           The Axes of the Planets, what.]\r\n\r\n19. Having mentioned the Sun’s turning round his axis, and as there will\r\nbe frequent occasion to speak of the like motion of the Earth and other\r\nPlanets, it is proper here to inform the young _Tyro_ in Astronomy, that\r\nneither the Sun nor Planets have material axes to turn upon, and support\r\nthem, as in the little imperfect Machines contrived to represent them.\r\nFor the axis of a Planet is a line conceived to be drawn through it’s\r\ncenter, about which it revolves as on a real axis. The extremities of\r\nthis line, terminating in opposite points of the Planet’s surface, are\r\ncalled its _Poles_. That which points towards the _northern_ part of the\r\nHeavens is called the _North Pole_; and the other, pointing towards the\r\n_southern_ part, is called the _South Pole_. A bowl whirled from one’s\r\nhand into the open air turns round such a line within itself, whilst it\r\nmoves forward; and such are the lines we mean, when we speak of the Axes\r\nof the Heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Orbits are not in the same plane with the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.\r\n\r\n           Their Nodes.\r\n\r\n           Where situated.]\r\n\r\n20. Let us suppose the Earth’s Orbit to be a thin, even, solid plane;\r\ncutting the Sun through the center, and extended out as far as the\r\nStarry Heavens, where it will mark the great Circle called the\r\n_Ecliptic_. This Circle we suppose to be divided into 12 equal parts,\r\ncalled _Signs_; each Sign into 30 equal parts, called _Degrees_; each\r\nDegree into 60 equal parts, called _Minutes_; and every Minute into 60\r\nequal parts, called _Seconds_: so that a Second is the 60th part of a\r\nMinute; a Minute the 60th part of a Degree; and a Degree the 360th part\r\nof a Circle, or 30th part of a Sign. The Planes of the Orbits of all the\r\nother Planets likewise cut the Sun in halves; but extended to the\r\nHeavens, form Circles different from one another, and from the Ecliptic;\r\none half of each being on the north side, and the other on the south\r\nside of it. Consequently the Orbit of each Planet crosses the Ecliptic\r\nin two opposite points, which are called the Planet’s _Nodes_. These\r\nNodes are all in different parts of the Ecliptic; and therefore, if the\r\nplanetary Tracks remained visible in the Heavens, they would in some\r\nmeasure resemble the different rutts of waggon-wheels crossing one\r\nanother in different parts, but never going far asunder. That Node, or\r\nIntersection of the Orbit of any Planet with the Earth’s Orbit, from\r\nwhich the Planet ascends northward above the Ecliptic, is called the\r\n_Ascending Node_ of the Planet; and the other, which is directly\r\nopposite thereto, is called it’s _Descending Node_. Saturn’s Ascending\r\nNode is in 21 deg. 13 min. of Cancer ♋, Jupiter’s in 7 deg. 29 min. of\r\nthe same Sign, Mars’s in 17 deg. 17 min. of Taurus ♉, Venus’s in 13 deg.\r\n59 min. of Gemini ♊, and Mercury’s in 14 deg. 43 min. of Taurus. Here we\r\nconsider the Earth’s Orbit as the standard, and the Orbits of all the\r\nother Planets as oblique to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planets Orbits, what.]\r\n\r\n21. When we speak of the Planets Orbits, all that is meant is their\r\nPaths through the open and unresisting Space in which they move; and are\r\nkept in, by the attractive power of the Sun, and the projectile force\r\nimpressed upon them at first: between which power and force there is so\r\nexact an adjustment, that without any solid Orbits to confine the\r\nPlanets, they keep their courses, and at the end of every revolution\r\nfind the points from whence they first set out, much more truly than can\r\nbe imitated in the best machines made by human art.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mercury.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           May be inhabited.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n22. MERCURY, the nearest Planet to the Sun, goes round him (as in the\r\ncircle marked ☿) in 87 days 23 hours of our time nearly; which is the\r\nlength of his year. But, being seldom seen, and no spots appearing on\r\nhis surface or disc, the time of his rotation on his axis, or the length\r\nof his days and nights, is as yet unknown. His distance from the Sun is\r\ncomputed to be 32 millions of miles, and his diameter 2600. In his\r\ncourse, round the Sun, he moves at the rate of 95 thousand miles every\r\nhour. His light and heat from the Sun are almost seven times as great as\r\nours; and the Sun appears to him almost seven times as large as to us.\r\nThe great heat on this Planet is no argument against it’s being\r\ninhabited; since the Almighty could as easily suit the bodies and\r\nconstitutions of it’s inhabitants to the heat of their dwelling, as he\r\nhas done ours to the temperature of our Earth. And it is very probable\r\nthat the people there have such an opinion of us, as we have of the\r\ninhabitants of Jupiter and Saturn; namely, that we must be intolerably\r\ncold, and have very little light at so great a distance from the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Has like phases with the Moon.]\r\n\r\n23. This Planet appears to us with all the various phases of the Moon,\r\nwhen viewed at different times by a good telescope; save only that he\r\nnever appears quite Full, because his enlightened side is never turned\r\ndirectly towards us but when he is so near the Sun as to be lost to our\r\nsight in it’s beams. And, as his enlightened side is always toward the\r\nSun, it is plain that he shines not by any light of his own; for if he\r\ndid, he would constantly appear round. That he moves about the Sun in an\r\nOrbit within the Earth’s Orbit is also plain (as will be more largely\r\nshewn by and by, § 141, _& seq._) because he is never seen opposite to\r\nthe Sun, nor above 56 times the Sun’s breadth from his center.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Orbit and Nodes.]\r\n\r\n24. His Orbit is inclined seven degrees to the Ecliptic; and _that_ Node\r\n§ 20, from which he ascends northward above the Ecliptic is in the 14th\r\ndegree of Taurus; the opposite, in the 14th degree of Scorpio. The Earth\r\nis in these points on the 5th of _November_ and 4th of _May_, new style;\r\nand when Mercury comes to either of his Nodes at his[5] inferior\r\nConjunction about these times, he will appear to pass over the disc or\r\nface of the Sun, like a dark round spot. But in all other parts of his\r\nOrbit his Conjunctions are invisible, because he either goes above or\r\nbelow the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When he will be seen as if upon the Sun.]\r\n\r\n25. Mr. WHISTON has given us an account of several periods at which\r\nMercury may be seen on the Sun’s disc, _viz._ In the year 1782, _Nov._\r\n12th, at 3 h. 44 m. in the afternoon: 1786, _May_ 4th, at 6 h. 57 m. in\r\nthe forenoon: 1789, _Dec._ 6th, at 3 h. 55 m. in the afternoon; and\r\n1799, _May_ 7th, at 2 h. 34 m. in the afternoon. There will be several\r\nintermediate Transits, but none of them visible at _London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Venus.]\r\n\r\n26. VENUS, the next Planet in order, is computed to be 59 millions of\r\nmiles from the Sun; and by moving at the rate of 69 thousand miles every\r\nhour in her Orbit (as in the circle marked ♀), she goes round the Sun in\r\n224 days 17 hours of our time nearly; in which, though it be the full\r\nlength of her year, she has only 9-1/4 days, according to BIANCHINI’s\r\nobservations; so that in her, every day and night together is as long as\r\n24-1/3 days and nights with us. This odd quarter of a day in every year\r\nmakes every fourth year a leap-year to Venus; as the like does to our\r\nEarth. Her diameter is 7906 miles; and by her diurnal motion the\r\ninhabitants about her Equator are carried 43 miles every hour: besides\r\nthe 69,000 above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Orbit lies between the Earth and Mercury.]\r\n\r\n27. Her Orbit includes that of Mercury within it; for at her greatest\r\nElongation, or apparent distance from the Sun, she is 96 times his\r\nbreadth from his centre; which is almost double of Mercury’s. Her Orbit\r\nis included by the Earth’s; for if it were not, she might be seen as\r\noften in Opposition to the Sun as in Conjunction with him; but she was\r\nnever seen 90 degrees, or a fourth part of a Circle, from the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: She is our morning and evening Star by turns.]\r\n\r\n28. When Venus appears west of the Sun she rises before him in the\r\nmorning, and is called the _Morning Star_: when she appears east of the\r\nSun she shines in the evening after he sets, and is then called the\r\n_Evening Star_: being each in it’s turn for 290 days. It may perhaps be\r\nsurprising at first, that Venus should keep longer on the east or west\r\nof the Sun than the whole time of her Period round him. But the\r\ndifficulty vanishes when we consider that the Earth is all the while\r\ngoing round the Sun the same way, though not so quick as Venus: and\r\ntherefore her relative motion to the Earth must in every Period be as\r\nmuch slower than her absolute motion in her Orbit, as the Earth during\r\nthat time advances forward in the Ecliptic; which is 220 degrees. To us\r\nshe appears through a telescope in all the various shapes of the Moon.\r\n\r\n29. The Axis of Venus is inclined 75 degrees to the Axis of her Orbit;\r\nwhich is 51-1/2 degrees more than our Earth’s Axis is inclined to the\r\nAxis of the Ecliptic: and therefore the variation of her seasons is much\r\ngreater than of ours. The North Pole of her Axis inclines toward the\r\n20th degree of Aquarius, our Earth’s to the beginning of Cancer; and\r\ntherefore the northern parts of Venus have summer in the Signs where\r\nthose of our Earth have winter, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarkable appearances.]\r\n\r\n30. The [6]artificial day at each Pole of Venus is as long as 112-1/2\r\n[7]natural days on our Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Tropics and polar Circles, how situated.]\r\n\r\n31. The Sun’s greatest Declination on each side of her Equator amounts\r\nto 75 degrees; therefore her[8] Tropics are only 15 degrees from her\r\nPoles; and her [9]Polar Circles as far from her Equator. Consequently,\r\nthe Tropics of Venus are between her Polar Circles and her Poles;\r\ncontrary to what those of our Earth are.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun’s daily Course.]\r\n\r\n32. As her annual Revolution contains only 9-1/4 of her days, the Sun\r\nwill always appear to go through a Sign, or twelfth Part of her Orbit,\r\nin little more that three quarters of her natural day, or nearly in\r\n18-3/4 of our days and nights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And great declination.]\r\n\r\n33. Because her day is so great a part of her year, the Sun changes his\r\nDeclination in one day so much, that if he passes vertically, or\r\ndirectly over head of any given place on the Tropic, the next day he\r\nwill be 26 degrees from it: and whatever place he passes vertically over\r\nwhen in the Equator, one day’s revolution will remove him 36-1/4 degrees\r\nfrom it. So that the Sun changes his Declination every day in Venus\r\nabout 14 degrees more at a mean rate, than he does in a quarter of a\r\nyear on our Earth. This appears to be providentially ordered, for\r\npreventing the too great effects of the Sun’s heat (which is twice as\r\ngreat on Venus as on the Earth) so that he cannot shine perpendicularly\r\non the same places for two days together; and by that means, the heated\r\nplaces have time to cool.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To determine the points of the Compass at her Poles.]\r\n\r\n34. If the inhabitants about the North Pole of Venus fix their South, or\r\nMeridian Line, through that part of the Heavens where the Sun comes to\r\nhis greatest Height, or North Declination, and call those the East and\r\nWest points of their Horizon, which are 90 degrees on each side from\r\nthat point where the Horizon is cut by the Meridian Line, these\r\ninhabitants will have the following remarkables.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surprising appearances at her Poles;]\r\n\r\nThe Sun will rise 22-1/2 degrees[10] north of the East, and going on\r\n112-1/2 degrees, as measured on the plane of the [11]Horizon, he will\r\ncross the Meridian at an altitude of 12-1/2 degrees; then making an\r\nentire revolution without setting, he will cross it again at an altitude\r\nof 48-1/2 degrees; at the next revolution he will cross the Meridian as\r\nhe comes to his greatest height and declination, at the altitude of 75\r\ndegrees; being then only 15 degrees from the Zenith, or that point of\r\nthe Heavens which is directly over head: and thence he will descend in\r\nthe like spiral manner; crossing the Meridian first at the altitude of\r\n48-1/2 degrees; next at the altitude of 12-1/2 degrees; and going on\r\nthence 112-1/2 degrees, he will set 22-1/2 degrees north of the West; so\r\nthat, after having been 4-5/8 revolutions above the Horizon, he descends\r\nbelow it to exhibit the like appearances at the South Pole.\r\n\r\n35. At each Pole, the Sun continues half a year without setting in\r\nsummer, and as long without rising in winter; consequently the polar\r\ninhabitants of Venus have only one day and one night in the year; as it\r\nis at the Poles of our Earth. But the difference between the heat of\r\nsummer and cold of winter, or of mid-day and mid-night, on Venus, is\r\nmuch greater than on the Earth: because in Venus, as the Sun is for half\r\na year together above the Horizon of each Pole in it’s turn, so he is\r\nfor a considerable part of that time near the Zenith; and during the\r\nother half of the year, always below the Horizon, and for a great part\r\nof that time at least 70 degrees from it. Whereas, at the Poles of our\r\nEarth, although the Sun is for half a year together above the Horizon,\r\nyet he never ascends above, nor descends below it, more than 23-1/2\r\ndegrees. When the Sun is in the Equinoctial, or in that Circle which\r\ndivides the northern half of the Heavens from the southern, he is seen\r\nwith one half of his Disc above the Horizon of the North Pole, and the\r\nother half above the Horizon of the South Pole; so that his center is in\r\nthe Horizon of both Poles: and then descending below the Horizon of one,\r\nhe ascends gradually above that of the other. Hence, in a year, each\r\nPole has one spring, one harvest, a summer as long as them both, and a\r\nwinter equal in length to the other three seasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At her polar Circles;]\r\n\r\n36. At the Polar Circles of Venus, the seasons are much the same as at\r\nthe Equator, because there are only 15 degrees betwixt them, § 31; only\r\nthe winters are not quite so long, nor the summers so short: but the\r\nfour seasons come twice round every year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At her Tropics;]\r\n\r\n37. At Venus’s Tropics, the Sun continues for about fifteen of our weeks\r\ntogether without setting in summer; and as long without rising in\r\nwinter. Whilst he is more than 15 degrees from the Equator, he neither\r\nrises to the inhabitants of the one Tropic, nor sets to those of the\r\nother: whereas, at our terrestrial Tropics he rises and sets every day\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n38. At Venus’s Tropics, the Seasons are much the same as at her Poles;\r\nonly the summers are a little longer, and the winters a little shorter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At her Equator.]\r\n\r\n39. At her Equator, the days and nights are always of the same length;\r\nand yet the diurnal and nocturnal Arches are very different, especially\r\nwhen the Sun’s declination is about the greatest: for then, his meridian\r\naltitude may sometimes be twice as great as his midnight depression, and\r\nat other times the reverse. When the Sun is at his greatest Declination,\r\neither North or South, his rays are as oblique at Venus’s Equator, as\r\nthey are at _London_ on the shortest day of winter. Therefore, at her\r\nEquator there are two winters, two summers, two springs, and two autumns\r\nevery year. But because the Sun stays for some time near the Tropics,\r\nand passes so quickly over the Equator, every winter there will be\r\nalmost twice as long as summer: the four seasons returning twice in that\r\ntime, which consists only of 9-1/4 days.\r\n\r\n40. Those parts of Venus which lie between the Poles and Tropics, and\r\nbetween the Tropics and Polar Circles, and also between the Polar\r\nCircles and Equator, partake more or less of the Phenomena of these\r\nCircles, as they are more or less distant from them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great difference of the Sun’s amplitude at rising and\r\n           setting.]\r\n\r\n41. From the quick change of the Sun’s declination it happens, that when\r\nhe rises due east on any day, he will not set due west on that day, as\r\nwith us; for if the place where he rises due east be on the Equator, he\r\nwill set on that day almost west-north-west; or about 18-1/2 degrees\r\nnorth of the west. But if the place be in 45 degrees north latitude,\r\nthen on the day that the Sun rises due east he will set north-west by\r\nwest, or 33 degrees north of the west. And in 62 degrees north latitude\r\nwhen he rises in the east, he sets not in that revolution, but just\r\ntouches the Horizon 10 degrees to the west of the north point; and\r\nascends again, continuing for 3-1/4 revolutions above the Horizon\r\nwithout setting. Therefore, no place has the forenoon and afternoon of\r\nthe same day equally long, unless it be on the Equator or at the Poles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The longitude of places easily found in Venus.]\r\n\r\n42. The Sun’s altitude at noon, or any other time of the day, and his\r\namplitude at rising and setting, being so different at places on the\r\nsame parallels of latitude, according to the different longitudes of\r\nthose places, the longitude will be almost as easily found on Venus as\r\nthe latitude is found on the Earth: which is an advantage we can never\r\nenjoy, because the daily change of the Sun’s declination is by much too\r\nsmall for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Equinoxes shift a quarter of a day forward every year.]\r\n\r\n43. On this Planet, wherever the Sun crosses the Equator in any year, he\r\nwill have 9 degrees of declination from that place on the same day and\r\nhour next year; and will cross the Equator 90 degrees farther to the\r\nwest; which makes the time of the Equinox a quarter of a day (almost\r\nequal to six of our days) later every year. Hence, although the spiral\r\nin which the Sun’s motion is performed, be of the same sort every year,\r\nyet it will not be the very same, because the Sun will not pass\r\nvertically over the same places till four annual revolutions are\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Every fourth year a leap-year to Venus.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n44. We may suppose that the inhabitants of Venus will be careful to add\r\na day to some particular part of every fourth year; which will keep the\r\nsame seasons to the same days. For, as the great annual change of the\r\nEquinoxes and Solstices shifts the seasons a quarter of a day every\r\nyear, they would be shifted through all the days of the year in 36\r\nyears. But by means of this intercalary day, every fourth year will be a\r\nleap-year; which will bring her time to an even reckoning, and keep her\r\nCalendar always right.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When she will appear on the Sun.]\r\n\r\n45. Venus’s Orbit is inclined 3-1/2 degrees to the Earth’s; and crosses\r\nit in the 14th degree of Gemini and of Sagittarius; and therefore, when\r\nthe Earth is about these points of the Ecliptic at the time that Venus\r\nis in her inferiour conjunction, she will appear like a spot on the Sun,\r\nand afford a more certain method of finding the distances of all the\r\nPlanets from the Sun than any other yet known. But these appearances\r\nhappen very seldom; and will only be thrice visible at _London_ for\r\nthree hundred years to come. The first time will be in the year 1761,\r\n_June_ the 6th, at 5 hours 55 minutes in the morning. The second 1996,\r\n_June_ the 9th, at 2 hours 13 minutes in the afternoon. And the third in\r\nthe year 2004, _June_ the 6th, at 7 hours 18 minutes in the forenoon.\r\nExcepting such Transits as these, she shews the same appearances to us\r\nregularly every eight years; her Conjunctions, Elongations, and Times of\r\nrising and setting being very nearly the same, on the same days, as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: She may have a Moon although we cannot see it.]\r\n\r\n46. Venus may have a Satellite or Moon, although it be undiscovered by\r\nus: which will not appear very surprising, if we consider how\r\ninconveniently we are placed for seeing it. For it’s enlightened side\r\ncan never be fully turned towards us but when Venus is beyond the Sun;\r\nand then, as Venus appears little bigger than an ordinary Star, her Moon\r\nmay be too small to be perceptible at such a distance. When she is\r\nbetween us and the Sun, her full Moon has it’s dark side towards us; and\r\nthen, we cannot see it any more than we can our own Moon at the time of\r\nChange. When Venus is at her greatest Elongation, we have but one half\r\nof the enlightened side of her Full Moon towards us; and even then it\r\nmay be too far distant to be seen by us. But if she has a Moon, it may\r\ncertainly be seen with her upon the Sun, in the year 1761, unless it’s\r\nOrbit be considerably inclined to the Ecliptic: for if it should be in\r\nconjunction or opposition at that time, we can hardly imagine that it\r\nmoves so slow as to be hid by Venus all the six hours that she will\r\nappear on the Sun’s Disc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           It’s diurnal and annual motion.]\r\n\r\n47. The EARTH is the next Planet above Venus in the System. It is 81\r\nmillions of miles from the Sun, and goes round him (as in the circle ⊕)\r\nin 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes, from any Equinox or Solstice to the same\r\nagain: but from any fixed Star to the same again, as seen from the Sun,\r\nin 365 days 6 hours and 9 minutes; the former being the length of the\r\nTropical year, and the latter the length of the Sidereal. It travels at\r\nthe rate of 58 thousand miles every hour, which motion, though 120 times\r\nswifter than that of a cannon ball, is little more than half as swift as\r\nMercury’s motion in his Orbit. The Earth’s diameter is 7970 miles; and\r\nby turning round it’s Axis every 24 hours from West to East, it causes\r\nan apparent diurnal motion of all the heavenly Bodies from East to West.\r\nBy this rapid motion of the Earth on it’s Axis, the inhabitants about\r\nthe Equator are carried 1042 miles every hour, whilst those on the\r\nparallel of _London_ are carried only about 580, besides the 58 thousand\r\nmiles by the annual motion above-mentioned, which is common to all\r\nplaces whatever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inclination of it’s Axis.]\r\n\r\n48. The Earth’s Axis makes an angle of 23-1/2 degrees with the Axis of\r\nit’s Orbit; and keeps always the same oblique direction; inclining\r\ntowards the same fixed Stars[12] throughout it’s annual course; which\r\ncauses the returns of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; as will be\r\nexplained at large in the tenth Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof of it’s being round.]\r\n\r\n49. The Earth is round like a globe; as appears, 1. from it’s shadow in\r\nEclipses of the Moon; which shadow is always bounded by a circular line\r\n§ 314. 2. From our seeing the masts of a ship whilst the hull is hid by\r\nthe convexity of the water. 3. From it’s having been sailed round by\r\nmany navigators. The hills take off no more from the roundness of the\r\nEarth in comparison, than grains of dust do from the roundness of a\r\ncommon Globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s number of square miles.]\r\n\r\n50. The seas and unknown parts of the Earth (by a measurement of the\r\nbest Maps) contain 160 million 522 thousand and 26 square miles; the\r\ninhabited parts 38 million 990 thousand 569: _Europe_ 4 million 456\r\nthousand and 65; _Asia_ 10 million 768 thousand 823; _Africa_ 9 million\r\n654 thousand 807; _America_ 14 million 110 thousand 874. In all, 199\r\nmillion 512 thousand 595; which is the number of square miles on the\r\nwhole surface of our Globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The proportion of land and sea.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n51. Dr. LONG, in the first volume of his Astronomy, pag. 168, mentions\r\nan ingenious and easy method of finding nearly what proportion the land\r\nbears to the sea; which is, to take the papers of a large terrestrial\r\nglobe, and after separating the land from the sea with a pair of\r\nscissars, to weigh them carefully in scales. This supposes the globe to\r\nbe exactly delineated, and the papers all of equal thickness. The Doctor\r\nmade the experiment on the papers of Mr. SENEX’s seventeen inch globe;\r\nand found that the sea papers weighed 349 grains, and the land only 124:\r\nby which it appears that almost three fourth parts of the surface of our\r\nEarth between the Polar Circles are covered with water, and that little\r\nmore than one fourth is dry land. The Doctor omitted weighing all within\r\nthe Polar Circles; because there is no certain measurement of the land\r\nthere, so as to know what proportion it bears to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon.]\r\n\r\n52. The MOON is not a Planet, but only a Satellite or Attendant of the\r\nEarth, moving round the Earth from Change to Change in 29 days 12 hours\r\nand 44 minutes; and going round the Sun with it every year. The Moon’s\r\ndiameter is 2180 miles; and her distance from the Earth 240 thousand.\r\nShe goes round her Orbit in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, moving about\r\n2290 miles every hour; and turns round her Axis exactly in the time that\r\nshe goes round the Earth, which is the reason of her keeping always the\r\nsame side towards us, and that her day and night taken together is as\r\nlong as our lunar month.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her Phases.]\r\n\r\n53. The Moon is an opaque Globe like the Earth, and shines only by\r\nreflecting the light of the Sun: therefore whilst that half of her which\r\nis toward the Sun is enlightened, the other half must be dark and\r\ninvisible. Hence, she disappears when she comes between us and the Sun;\r\nbecause her dark side is then toward us. When she is gone a little way\r\nforward, we see a little of her enlightened side; which still increases\r\nto our view, as she advances forward, until she comes to be opposite to\r\nthe Sun; and then her whole enlightened side is towards the Earth, and\r\nshe appears with a round, illumined Orb; which we call the _Full Moon_:\r\nher dark side being then turned away from the Earth. From the Full she\r\nseems to decrease gradually as she goes through the other half of her\r\ncourse; shewing us less and less of her enlightened side every day, till\r\nher next change or conjunction with the Sun, and then she disappears as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof that she shines not by her own light.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n54. The continual changing of the Moon’s phases or shapes demonstrates\r\nthat she shines not by any light of her own: for if she did, being\r\nglobular, we should always see her with a round full Orb like the Sun.\r\nHer Orbit is represented in the Scheme by the little circle _m_, upon\r\nthe Earth’s Orbit ⊕: but it is drawn fifty times too large in proportion\r\nto the Earth’s; and yet is almost too small to be seen in the Diagram.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: One half of her always enlightened.]\r\n\r\n55. The Moon has scarce any difference of seasons; her Axis being almost\r\nperpendicular to the Ecliptic. What is very singular, one half of her\r\nhas no darkness at all; the Earth constantly affording it a strong light\r\nin the Sun’s absence; while the other half has a fortnight’s darkness\r\nand a fortnight’s light by turns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our Earth is her Moon.]\r\n\r\n56. Our Earth is a Moon to the Moon, waxing and waneing regularly, but\r\nappearing thirteen times as big, and affording her thirteen times as\r\nmuch light, as she does to us. When she changes to us, the Earth appears\r\nfull to her; and when she is in her first quarter to us, the Earth is in\r\nit’s third quarter to her; and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n57. But from one half of the Moon, the Earth is never seen at all: from\r\nthe middle of the other half, it is always seen over head; turning round\r\nalmost thirty times as quick as the Moon does. From the line which\r\nlimits our view of the Moon, or all round what we call her edges, only\r\none half of the Earth’s side next her is seen; the other half being hid\r\nbelow the Horizon. To her, the Earth seems to be the biggest Body in the\r\nUniverse; for it appears thirteen times as big as she does to us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Proof of the Moon’s having no Atmosphere;]\r\n\r\n58. The Moon has no such Atmosphere, or body of air surrounding her as\r\nwe have: for if she had, we could never see her edge so well defined as\r\nit appears; but there would be a sort of a mist or haziness round her,\r\nwhich would make the Stars look fainter, when they were seen through it.\r\nBut observation proves, that the Stars which disappear behind the Moon\r\nretain their full lustre until they seem to touch her very edge, and\r\nthen vanish in a moment. This has been often observed by Astronomers,\r\nbut particularly by CASSINI[13] of the Star γ in the breast of Virgo,\r\nwhich appears single and round to the bare eye; but through a refracting\r\nTelescope of 16 feet appears to be two Stars so near together, that the\r\ndistance between them seems to be but equal to one of their apparent\r\ndiameters. The Moon was observed to pass over them on the 21st of\r\n_April_ 1720, _N. S._ and as her dark edge drew near to them, it caused\r\nno change in their colour or Situation. At 25 min. 14 sec. past 12 at\r\nnight, the most westerly of these Stars was hid by the dark edge of the\r\nMoon; and in 30 seconds afterward, the most easterly Star was hid: each\r\nof them disappearing behind the Moon in an instant, without any\r\npreceding diminution of magnitude or brightness; which by no means could\r\nhave been the case if there were an Atmosphere round the Moon; for then,\r\none of the Stars falling obliquely into it before the other, ought by\r\nrefraction to have suffered some change in its colour, or in it’s\r\ndistance from the other Star which was not yet entered into the\r\nAtmosphere. But no such alteration could be perceived though the\r\nobservation was performed with the utmost attention to that particular;\r\nand was very proper to have made such a discovery. The faint light,\r\nwhich has been seen all around the Moon, in total Eclipses of the Sun,\r\nhas been observed, during the time of darkness, to have it’s center\r\ncoincident with the center of the Sun; and is therefore much more likely\r\nto arise from the Atmosphere of the Sun than from that of the Moon; for\r\nif it were the latter, it’s center would have gone along with the\r\nMoon’s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor Seas.\r\n\r\n           She is full of caverns and deep pits.]\r\n\r\n59. If there were seas in the Moon, she could have no clouds, rains, nor\r\nstorms as we have; because she has no such Atmosphere to support the\r\nvapours which occasion them. And every one knows, that when the Moon is\r\nabove our Horizon in the night time, she is visible, unless the clouds\r\nof our Atmosphere hide her from our view; and all parts of her appear\r\nconstantly with the same clear, serene, and calm aspect. But those dark\r\nparts of the Moon, which were formerly thought to be seas, are now found\r\nto be only vast deep cavities, and places which reflect not the Sun’s\r\nlight so strongly as others, having many caverns and pits whose shadows\r\nfall within them, and are always dark on the sides next the Sun; which\r\ndemonstrates their being hollow: and most of these pits have little\r\nknobs like hillocks standing within them, and casting shadows also;\r\nwhich cause these places to appear darker than others which have fewer,\r\nor less remarkable caverns. All these appearances shew that there are no\r\nseas in the Moon; for if there were any, their surfaces would appear\r\nsmooth and even, like those on the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stars always visible to the Moon.]\r\n\r\n60. There being no Atmosphere about the Moon, the Heavens in the day\r\ntime have the appearance of night to a Lunarian who turns his back\r\ntoward the Sun; and when he does, the Stars appear as bright to him as\r\nthey do in the night to us. For, it is entirely owing to our Atmosphere\r\nthat the Heavens are bright about us in the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth a Dial to the Moon.]\r\n\r\n61. As the Earth turns round it’s Axis, the several continents, seas,\r\nand islands appear to the Moon’s inhabitants like so many spots of\r\ndifferent forms and brightness, moving over it’s surface; but much\r\nfainter at some times than others, as our clouds cover them or leave\r\nthem. By these spots the Lunarians can determine the time of the Earth’s\r\ndiurnal motion, just as we do the motion of the Sun: and perhaps they\r\nmeasure their time by the motion of the Earth’s spots; for they cannot\r\nhave a truer dial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n           How the Lunarians may know the length of their year.]\r\n\r\n62. The Moon’s Axis is so nearly perpendicular to the Ecliptic, that the\r\nSun never removes sensibly from her Equator: and the[14] obliquity of\r\nher Orbit, which is next to nothing as seen from the Sun, cannot cause\r\nany sensible declination of the Sun from her Equator. Yet her\r\ninhabitants are not destitute of means for determining the length of\r\ntheir year, though their method and ours must differ. For we can know\r\nthe length of our year by the return of our Equinoxes; but the\r\nLunarians, having always equal day and night, must have recourse to\r\nanother method; and we may suppose, they measure their year by observing\r\nthe Poles of our Earth; as one always begins to be enlightened, and the\r\nother disappears, at our Equinoxes; they being conveniently situated for\r\nobserving great tracks of land about our Earth’s Poles, which are\r\nentirely unknown to us. Hence we may conclude, that the year is of the\r\nsame absolute length both to the Earth and Moon, though very different\r\nas to the number of days: we having 365-1/4 natural days, and the\r\nLunarians only 12-7/19; every day and night in the Moon being as long as\r\n29-1/2 on the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the longitudes of their places.]\r\n\r\n63. The Moon’s inhabitants on the side next the Earth may as easily find\r\nthe longitude of their places as we can find the latitude of ours. For\r\nthe Earth keeping constantly, or very nearly so, over one Meridian of\r\nthe Moon, the east or west distances of places from that Meridian are as\r\neasily found, as we can find our distance from the Equator by the\r\nAltitude of our celestial Poles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mars.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n64. The Planet MARS is next in order, being the first above the Earth’s\r\nOrbit. His distance from the Sun is computed to be 123 millions of\r\nmiles; and by travelling at the rate of 47 thousand miles every hour, as\r\nin the circle ♂, he goes round the Sun in 687 of our days and 17 hours;\r\nwhich is the length of his year, and contains 667-1/4 of his days; every\r\nday and night together being 40 minutes longer than with us. His\r\ndiameter is 4444 miles, and by his diurnal rotation the inhabitants\r\nabout his Equator are carried 556 miles every hour. His quantity of\r\nlight and heat is equal but to one half of ours; and the Sun appears but\r\nhalf as big to him as to us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Atmosphere and Phases.]\r\n\r\n65. This Planet being but a fifth part so big as the Earth, if any Moon\r\nattends him, she must be very small, and has not yet been discovered by\r\nour best telescopes. He is of a fiery red colour, and by his Appulses to\r\nsome of the fixed Stars, seems to be surrounded by a very gross\r\nAtmosphere. He appears sometimes gibbous, but never horned; which both\r\nshews that his Orbit includes the Earth’s within it, and that he shines\r\nnot by his own light.\r\n\r\n66. To Mars, our Earth and Moon appear like two Moons, a bigger and a\r\nless; changing places with one another, and appearing sometimes horned,\r\nsometimes half or three quarters illuminated, but never full; nor at\r\nmost above a quarter of a degree from each other, although they are 240\r\nthousand miles asunder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n           How the other Planets appear to Mars.]\r\n\r\n67. Our Earth appears almost as big to Mars as Venus does to us, and at\r\nMars it is never seen above 48 degrees from the Sun; sometimes it\r\nappears to pass over the Disc of the Sun, and so do Mercury and Venus:\r\nbut Mercury can never be seen from Mars by such eyes as ours, unassisted\r\nby proper instruments; and Venus will be as seldom seen as we see\r\nMercury. Jupiter and Saturn are as visible to Mars as to us. His Axis is\r\nperpendicular to the Ecliptic, and his Orbit is 2 degrees inclined to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jupiter.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n68. JUPITER, the biggest of all the Planets, is still higher in the\r\nSystem, being about 424 millions of miles from the Sun: and going at the\r\nrate of 25 thousand miles every hour in his Orbit, as in the circle ♃\r\nfinishes his annual period in eleven of our years 314 days and 18 hours.\r\nHe is above 1000 times as big as the Earth, for his diameter is 81,000\r\nmiles; which is more than ten times the diameter of the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The number of days in his year.]\r\n\r\n69. Jupiter turns round his Axis in 9 hours 56 minutes; so that his year\r\ncontains 10 thousand 464 days; and the diurnal velocity of his\r\nequatoreal parts is greater than the swiftness with which he moves in\r\nhis annual Orbit; a singular circumstance, as far as we know. By this\r\nprodigious quick Rotation, his equatoreal inhabitants are carried 25\r\nthousand 920 miles every hour (which is 920 miles an hour more than an\r\ninhabitant of our Earth moves in twenty-four hours) besides the 25\r\nthousand above-mentioned, which is common to all parts of his surface,\r\nby his annual motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Belts and spots.]\r\n\r\n70. Jupiter is surrounded by faint substances, called _Belts_, in which\r\nso many changes appear, that they are generally thought to be clouds:\r\nfor some of them have been first interrupted and broken, and then have\r\nvanished entirely. They have sometimes been observed of different\r\nbreadths, and afterwards have all become nearly of the same breadth.\r\nLarge spots have been seen in these Belts; and when a Belt vanishes, the\r\ncontiguous spots disappear with it. The broken ends of some Belts have\r\nbeen generally observed to revolve in the same time with the spots; only\r\nthose nearer the Equator in somewhat less time than those near the\r\nPoles; perhaps on account of the Sun’s greater heat near the Equator,\r\nwhich is parallel to the Belts and course of the spots. Several large\r\nspots, which appear round at one time, grow oblong by degrees, and then\r\ndivide into two or three round spots. The periodical time of the spots\r\nnear the Equator is 9 hours 50 minutes, but of those near the Poles 9\r\nhours 56 minutes. _See Dr._ SMITH_’s Optics_, § 1004 _& seq._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He has no change of seasons;]\r\n\r\n71. The Axis of Jupiter is so nearly perpendicular to his Orbit, that he\r\nhas no sensible change of seasons; which is a great advantage, and\r\nwisely ordered by the Author of Nature. For, if the Axis of this Planet\r\nwere inclined any considerable number of degrees, just so many degrees\r\nround each Pole would in their turn be almost six of our years together\r\nin darkness. And, as each degree of a great Circle on Jupiter contains\r\n706 of our miles at a mean rate, it is easy to judge what vast tracts of\r\nland would be rendered uninhabitable by any considerable inclination of\r\nhis Axis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But has four Moons.]\r\n\r\n72. The Sun appears but 1/28 part so big to Jupiter as to us; and his\r\nlight and heat are in the same small proportion, but compensated by the\r\nquick returns thereof, and by four Moons (some bigger and some less than\r\nour Earth) which revolve about him: so that there is scarce any part of\r\nthis huge Planet but what is during the whole night enlightened by one\r\nor more of these Moons, except his Poles, whence only the farthest Moons\r\ncan be seen, and where their light is not wanted, because the Sun\r\nconstantly circulates in or near the Horizon, and is very probably kept\r\nin view of both Poles by the Refraction of Jupiter’s Atmosphere, which,\r\nif it be like ours, has certainly refractive power enough for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their periods round Jupiter.\r\n\r\n           Their grand period.]\r\n\r\n73. The Orbits of these Moons are represented in the Scheme of the Solar\r\nSystem by four small circles marked 1. 2. 3. 4. on Jupiter’s Orbit ♃;\r\nbut are drawn fifty times too large in proportion to it. The first Moon,\r\nor that nearest to Jupiter, goes round him in 1 day 18 hours and 36\r\nminutes of our time; and is 229 thousand miles distant from his center:\r\nThe second performs it’s revolution in three days 13 hours and 15\r\nminutes, at 364 thousand miles distance: The third in 7 days three hours\r\nand 59 minutes, at the distance of 580 thousand miles: And the fourth,\r\nor outermost, in 16 days 18 hours and 30 minutes, at the distance of one\r\nmillion of miles from his center. The Periods of these Moons are so\r\nincommensurate to one another, that if ever they were all in a right\r\nline between Jupiter and the Sun, it will require more than\r\n3,000,000,000,000 years from that time to bring them all into the same\r\nright line again, as any one will find who reduces all their periods\r\ninto seconds, then multiplies them into one another, and divides the\r\nproduct by 432; which is the highest number that will divide the product\r\nof all their periodical times, namely 42,085,303,376,931,994,955,904\r\nseconds, without a remainder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parallax of their Orbits, and distances from Jupiter.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.\r\n\r\n           How he appears to his nearest Moon.]\r\n\r\n74. The Angles under which the Orbits of Jupiter’s Moons are seen from\r\nthe Earth, at it’s mean distance from Jupiter, are as follow: The first,\r\n3ʹ 55ʺ; the second, 6ʹ 14ʺ; the third, 9ʹ 58ʺ; and the fourth, 17ʹ 30ʺ.\r\nAnd their distances from Jupiter, measured by his semidiameters, are\r\nthus: The first, 5-2/3; the second, 9; the third. 14-23/60; and the\r\nfourth, 25-18/60[15]. This Planet, seen from it’s nearest Moon, appears\r\n1000 times as large as our Moon does to us; waxing and waneing in all\r\nher monthly shapes, every 42-1/2 hours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two grand discoveries made by the Eclipse of Jupiter’s\r\n           Moons.]\r\n\r\n75. Jupiter’s three nearest Moons fall into his shadow, and are eclipsed\r\nin every Revolution: but the Orbit of the fourth Moon is so much\r\ninclined, that it passeth by Jupiter, without falling into his shadow,\r\ntwo years in every six. By these Eclipses, Astronomers have not only\r\ndiscovered that the Sun’s light comes to us in eight minutes; but have\r\nalso determined the longitudes of places on this Earth with greater\r\ncertainty and facility than by any other method yet known; as shall be\r\nexplained in the eleventh Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great difference between the Equatoreal and Polar diameters\r\n           of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n           The difference little in those of our Earth.]\r\n\r\n76. The difference between the Equatoreal and Polar diameters of Jupiter\r\nis 6230 miles; for his equatoreal diameter is to his polar as 13 to 12.\r\nSo that his Poles are 3115 miles nearer his center than his Equator is.\r\nThis results from his quick motion round his Axis; for the fluids,\r\ntogether with the light particles, which they can carry or wash away\r\nwith them, recede from the Poles which are at rest, towards the Equator\r\nwhere the motion is quickest, until there be a sufficient number\r\naccumulated to make up the deficiency of gravity occasioned by the\r\ncentrifugal force, which always arises from a quick motion round an\r\naxis: and when the weight is made up so, as that all parts of the\r\nsurface press equally heavy toward the center, there is an\r\n_equilibrium_, and the equatoreal parts rise no higher. Our Earth being\r\nbut a very small Planet, compared to Jupiter, and it’s motion on it’s\r\nAxis being much slower, it is less flattened of course; for the\r\ndifference between it’s equatoreal and polar diameters is only as 230 to\r\n229, or 35 miles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Place of his Nodes.]\r\n\r\n77. Jupiter’s Orbit is 1 degree 20 minutes inclined to the Ecliptic. His\r\nNorth Node is in the 7th degree of Cancer, and his South Node in the 7th\r\ndegree of Capricorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saturn.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n78. SATURN, the remotest of all the Planets, is about 777 millions of\r\nmiles from the Sun; and, travelling at the rate of 18 thousand miles\r\nevery hour, as in the circle marked ♄, performs his annual circuit in 29\r\nyears 167 days and 5 hours of our time; which makes only one year to\r\nthat Planet. His diameter is 67,000 miles; and therefore he is near 600\r\ntimes as big as the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.\r\n\r\n           His Ring.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n79. He is surrounded by a thin broad Ring, as an artificial Globe is by\r\nits Horizon. This Ring appears double when seen through a good\r\ntelescope, and is represented by the figure in such an oblique view as\r\nit is generally seen. It is inclined 30 degrees to the Ecliptic, and is\r\nabout 21 thousand miles in breadth; which is equal to it’s distance from\r\nSaturn on all sides. There is reason to believe that the Ring turns\r\nround it’s Axis, because, when it is almost edge-wise to us, it appears\r\nsomewhat thicker on one side of the Planet than on the other; and the\r\nthickest edge has been seen on different sides at different times. But\r\nSaturn having no visible spots on his body, whereby to determine the\r\ntime of his turning round his Axis, the length of his days and nights,\r\nand the position of his Axis, are unknown to us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His five Moons.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n80. To Saturn, the Sun appears only 1/90th part so big as to us; and the\r\nlight and heat he receives from the Sun are in the same proportion to\r\nours. But to compensate for the small quantity of sun-light, he has five\r\nMoons, all going round him on the outside of his Ring, and nearly in the\r\nsame plane with it. The first, or nearest Moon to Saturn, goes round him\r\nin 1 day 21 hours 19 minutes; and is 140 thousand miles from his center:\r\nThe second, in two days 17 hours 40 minutes; at the distance of 187\r\nthousand miles: The third, in 4 days 12 hours 25 minutes; at 263\r\nthousand miles distance: The fourth, in 15 days 22 hours 41 minutes; at\r\nthe distance of 600 thousand miles: And the fifth, or outermost, at one\r\nmillion 800 thousand miles from Saturn’s center, goes round him in 79\r\ndays 7 hours 48 minutes. Their Orbits in the Scheme of the Solar System\r\nare represented by the five small circles, marked 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. on\r\nSaturn’s Orbit; but these, like the Orbits of the other Satellites, are\r\ndrawn fifty times too large in proportion to the Orbits of their Primary\r\nPlanets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Axis probably inclined to his Ring.]\r\n\r\n81. The Sun shines almost fifteen of our years together on one side of\r\nSaturn’s Ring without setting, and as long on the other in it’s turn. So\r\nthat the Ring is visible to the inhabitants of that Planet for almost\r\nfifteen of our years, and as long invisible by turns, if it’s Axis has\r\nno Inclination to it’s Ring: but if the Axis of the Planet be inclined\r\nto the Ring, suppose about 30 degrees, the Ring will appear and\r\ndisappear once every natural day to all the inhabitants within 30\r\ndegrees of the Equator, on both sides, frequently eclipsing the Sun in a\r\nSaturnian day. Moreover, if Saturn’s Axis be so inclined to his Ring, it\r\nis perpendicular to his Orbit; and thereby the inconvenience of\r\ndifferent seasons to that Planet is avoided. For considering the length\r\nof Saturn’s year, which is almost equal to thirty of ours, what a\r\ndreadful condition must the inhabitants of his Polar regions be in, if\r\nthey be half of that time deprived of the light and heat of the Sun?\r\nwhich must not be their case alone, if the Axis of the Planet be\r\nperpendicular to the Ring, but also the Ring must hide the Sun from vast\r\ntracks of land on each side of the Equator for 13 or 14 of our years\r\ntogether, on the south side and north side by turns, as the Axis\r\ninclines to or from the Sun: the reverse of which inconvenience is\r\nanother good presumptive proof of the Inclination of Saturn’s Axis to\r\nit’s Ring, and also of his Axis being perpendicular to his Orbit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the Ring appears to Saturn and to us.\r\n\r\n           In what Signs Saturn appears to lose his Ring; and in what\r\n           Signs it appears most open to us.]\r\n\r\n82. This Ring, seen from Saturn, appears like a vast luminous Arch in\r\nthe Heavens, as if it did not belong to the Planet. When we see the Ring\r\nmost open, it’s shadow upon the Planet is broadest; and from that time\r\nthe shadow grows narrower, as the Ring appears to do to us; until, by\r\nSaturn’s annual motion, the Sun comes to the plane of the Ring, or even\r\nwith it’s edge; which being then directed towards us, becomes invisible\r\non account of it’s thinness; as shall be explained more largely in the\r\ntenth Chapter, and illustrated by a figure. The Ring disappears twice in\r\nevery annual Revolution of Saturn, namely, when he is in the 19th degree\r\nboth of Pisces and of Virgo. And when Saturn is in the middle between\r\nthese points, or in the 19th degree either of Gemini or of Sagittarius,\r\nhis Ring appears most open to us; and then it’s longest diameter is to\r\nit’s shortest as 9 to 4.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Planet but Saturn can be seen from Jupiter; nor any from\r\n           Jupiter besides Saturn.]\r\n\r\n83. To such eyes as ours, unassisted by instruments, Jupiter is the only\r\nPlanet that can be seen from Saturn; and Saturn the only Planet that can\r\nbe seen from Jupiter. So that the inhabitants of these two Planets must\r\neither see much farther than we do, or have equally good instruments to\r\ncarry their sight to remote objects, if they know that there is such a\r\nbody as our Earth in the Universe: for the Earth is no bigger seen from\r\nJupiter than his Moons are seen from the Earth; and if his large body\r\nhad not first attracted our sight, and prompted our curiosity to view\r\nhim with the telescope, we should never have known any thing of his\r\nMoons; unless by chance we had directed the telescope toward that small\r\npart of the Heavens where they were at the time of observation. And the\r\nlike is true of the Moons of Saturn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Place of Saturn’s Nodes.]\r\n\r\n84. The Orbit of Saturn is 2-1/2 degrees inclined to the Ecliptic, or\r\nOrbit of our Earth, and intersects it in the 21st degree of Cancer and\r\nof Capricorn; so that Saturn’s Nodes are only 14 degrees from Jupiter’s,\r\n§ 77.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun’s light much stronger on Jupiter and Saturn than is\r\n           generally believed.\r\n\r\n           All our heat depends not on the Sun’s rays.]\r\n\r\n85. The quantity of light, afforded by the Sun of Jupiter, being but\r\n1/28th part, and to Saturn only 1/90th part, of what we enjoy; may at\r\nfirst thought induce us to believe that these two Planets are entirely\r\nunfit for rational beings to dwell upon. But, that their light is not so\r\nweak as we imagine, is evident from their brightness in the night-time;\r\nand also, that when the Sun is so much eclipsed to us as to have only\r\nthe 40th part of his Disc left uncovered by the Moon, the decrease of\r\nlight is not very sensible: and just at the end of darkness in Total\r\nEclipses, when his western limb begins to be visible, and seems no\r\nbigger than a bit of fine silver wire, every one is surprised at the\r\nbrightness wherewith that small part of him shines. The Moon when Full\r\naffords travellers light enough to keep them from mistaking their way;\r\nand yet, according to Dr. SMITH[16], it is equal to no more than a 90\r\nthousandth part of the light of the Sun: that is, the Sun’s light is 90\r\nthousand times as strong as the light of the Moon when Full.\r\nConsequently, the Sun gives a thousand times as much light to Saturn as\r\nthe Full Moon does to us; and above three thousand times as much to\r\nJupiter. So that these two Planets, even without any Moons, would be\r\nmuch more enlightened than we at first imagine; and by having so many,\r\nthey may be very comfortable places of residence. Their heat, so far as\r\nit depends on the force of the Sun’s rays, is certainly much less than\r\nours; to which no doubt the bodies of their inhabitants are as well\r\nadapted as ours are to the seasons we enjoy. And if we consider, that\r\nJupiter never has any winter, even at his Poles; which probably is also\r\nthe case with Saturn, the cold cannot be so intense on these two Planets\r\nas is generally imagined. Besides, there may be something in their\r\nnature or soil much warmer than in that of our Earth: and we find that\r\nall our heat depends not on the rays of the Sun; for if it did, we\r\nshould always have the same months equally hot or cold at their annual\r\nreturns. But it is far otherwise, for _February_ is sometimes warmer\r\nthan _May_, which must be owing to vapours and exhalations from the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is highly probable that all the Planets are inhabited.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n86. Every person who looks upon, and compares the Systems of Moons\r\ntogether, which belong to Jupiter and Saturn, must be amazed at the vast\r\nmagnitude of these two Planets, and the noble attendance they have in\r\nrespect of our little Earth: and can never bring himself to think, that\r\nan infinitely wise Creator should dispose of all his animals and\r\nvegetables here, leaving the other Planets bare and destitute of\r\nrational creatures. To suppose that he had any view to our Benefit, in\r\ncreating these Moons and giving them their motions round Jupiter and\r\nSaturn; to imagine that he intended these vast Bodies for any advantage\r\nto us, when he well knew that they could never be seen but by a few\r\nAstronomers peeping through telescopes; and that he gave to the Planets\r\nregular returns of days and nights, and different seasons to all where\r\nthey would be convenient; but of no manner of service to us, except only\r\nwhat immediately regards our own Planet the Earth; to imagine, I say,\r\nthat he did all this on our account, would be charging him impiously\r\nwith having done much in vain: and as absurd, as to imagine that he has\r\ncreated a little Sun and a Planetary System within the shell of our\r\nEarth, and intended them for our use. These considerations amount to\r\nlittle less than a positive proof that all the Planets are inhabited:\r\nfor if they are not, why all this care in furnishing them with so many\r\nMoons, to supply those with light which are at the greater distances\r\nfrom the Sun? Do we not see, that the farther a Planet is from the Sun,\r\nthe greater Apparatus it has for that purpose? save only Mars, which\r\nbeing but a small Planet, may have Moons too small to be seen by us. We\r\nknow that the Earth goes round the Sun, and turns round it’s own Axis,\r\nto produce the vicissitudes of summer and winter by the former, and of\r\nday and night by the latter motion, for the benefit of its inhabitants.\r\nMay we not then fairly conclude, by parity of reason, that the end and\r\ndesign of all the other Planets is the same? and is not this agreeable\r\nto that beautiful harmony which reigns over the Universe? Surely it is:\r\nand raises in us the most magnificent ideas of the SUPREME BEING, who is\r\nevery where, and at all times present; displaying his power, wisdom, and\r\ngoodness among all his creatures! and distributing happiness to\r\ninnumerable ranks of various beings!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           How the Sun appears to the different Planets.]\r\n\r\n87. In Fig. 2d, we have a view of the proportional breadth of the Sun’s\r\nface or disc, as seen from the different Planets. The Sun is represented\r\nN^o 1, as seen from Mercury; N^o 2, as seen from Venus; N^o 3, as seen\r\nfrom the Earth; N^o 4, as seen from Mars; N^o 5, as seen from Jupiter;\r\nand N^o 6, as seen from Saturn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\nLet the circle _B_ be the Sun as seen from any Planet, at a given\r\ndistance; to another Planet, at double that distance, the Sun will\r\nappear just of half that breadth, as _A_; which contains only one fourth\r\npart of the area or surface of _B_. For, all circles, as well as square\r\nsurfaces, are to one another as the squares of their diameters. Thus,\r\nthe square _A_ is just half as broad as the square _B_; and yet it is\r\nplain to sight, that _B_ contains four times as much surface as _A_.\r\nHence, in round numbers, the Sun appears 7 times larger to Mercury than\r\nto us, 90 times larger to us than to Saturn, and 630 times as large to\r\nMercury as to Saturn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.\r\n\r\n           Proportional bulks and distances of the Planets.\r\n\r\n           PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n88. In Fig. 5th, we have a view of the bulks of the Planets in\r\nproportion to each other, and to a supposed globe of two foot diameter\r\nfor the Sun. The Earth is 27 times as big as Mercury, very little bigger\r\nthan Venus, 5 times as big as Mars; but Jupiter is 1049 times as big as\r\nthe Earth, Saturn 586 times as big, exclusive of his Ring; and the Sun\r\nis 877 thousand 650 times as big as the Earth. If the Planets in this\r\nFigure were set at their due distances from a Sun of two feet diameter,\r\naccording to their proportional bulks, as in our System, Mercury would\r\nbe 28 yards from the Sun’s center; Venus 51 yards 1 foot; the Earth 70\r\nyards 2 feet; Mars 107 yards 2 feet; Jupiter 370 yards 2 feet; and\r\nSaturn 760 yards two feet. The Comet of the year 1680, at it’s greatest\r\ndistance, 10 thousand 760 yards. In this proportion, the Moon’s distance\r\nfrom the center of the Earth would be only 7-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An idea of their distances.]\r\n\r\n89. To assist the imagination in conceiving an idea of the vast\r\ndistances of the Sun, Planets, and Stars, let us suppose, that a body\r\nprojected from the Sun should continue to fly with the swiftness of a\r\ncannon ball; _i. e._ 480 miles every hour; this body would reach the\r\nOrbit of Mercury, in 7 years 221 days; of Venus, in 14 years 8 days; of\r\nthe Earth, in 19 years 91 days; of Mars, in 29 years 85 days; of\r\nJupiter, in 100 years 280 days; of Saturn, in 184 years 240 days; to the\r\nComet of 1680, at it’s greatest distance from the Sun, in 2660 years;\r\nand to the nearest fixed Stars in about 7 million 600 thousand years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Planets appear bigger and less at different times.]\r\n\r\n90. As the Earth is not the center of the Orbits in which the Planets\r\nmove, they come nearer to it and go farther from it and at different\r\ntimes; on which account they appear bigger and less by turns. Hence, the\r\napparent magnitudes of the Planets are not always a certain rule to know\r\nthem by.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n91. Under Fig. 3, are the names and characters of the twelve Signs of\r\nthe Zodiac, which the Reader should be perfectly well acquainted with;\r\nso as to know the characters without seeing the names. Every Sign\r\ncontains 30 degrees, as in the Circle bounding the Solar System; to\r\nwhich the characters of the Signs are set in their proper places.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Comets.]\r\n\r\n92. The COMETS are solid opaque bodies, with long transparent trains or\r\ntails, issuing from that side which is turned away from the Sun. They\r\nmove about the Sun, in very excentric ellipses; and are of a much\r\ngreater density than the Earth; for some of them are heated in every\r\nPeriod to such a degree, as would vitrify or dissipate any substance\r\nknown to us. Sir ISAAC NEWTON computed the heat of the Comet which\r\nappeared in the year 1680, when nearest the Sun, to be 2000 times hotter\r\nthan red-hot iron, and that being thus heated, it must retain it’s heat\r\nuntil it comes round again, although it’s Period should be more than\r\ntwenty thousand years; and it is computed to be only 575. The method of\r\ncomputing the heat of bodies, keeping at any known distance from the\r\nSun, so far as their heat depends on the force of the Sun’s rays, is\r\nvery easy; and shall be explained in the eighth Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           They prove that the Orbits of the Planets are not solid.\r\n\r\n           The Periods only of three are known.\r\n\r\n           They prove the Stars to be at immense distances.]\r\n\r\n93. Part of the Paths of three Comets are delineated in the Scheme of\r\nthe Solar System, and the years marked in which they made their\r\nappearance. It is believed, that there are at least 21 Comets belonging\r\nto our System, moving in all sorts of directions: and all those which\r\nhave been observed, have moved through the ethereal Regions and the\r\nOrbits of the Planets without suffering the least sensible resistance in\r\ntheir motions; which plainly proves that the Planets do not move in\r\nsolid Orbs. Of all the Comets, the Periods of the above-mentioned three\r\nonly are known with any degree of certainty. The first of these Comets\r\nappeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682; and is expected to appear\r\nagain in the year 1758, and every 75th year afterwards. The second of\r\nthem appeared in 1532 and 1661, and may be expected to return in 1789\r\nand every 129th year afterwards. The third, having last appeared in\r\n1680, and it’s Period being no less than 575 years, cannot return until\r\nthe year 2225. This Comet, at it’s greatest distance, is about 11\r\nthousand two hundred millions of miles from the Sun; and at it’s least\r\ndistance from the Sun’s center, which is 490,000 miles, is within less\r\nthan a third part of the Sun’s semi-diameter from his surface. In that\r\npart of it’s Orbit which is nearest the Sun, it flies with the amazing\r\nswiftness of 880,000 miles in an hour; and the Sun, as seen from it,\r\nappears an hundred degrees in breadth; consequently, 40 thousand times\r\nas large as he appears to us. The astonishing length that this Comet\r\nruns out into empty Space, suggests to our minds an idea of the vast\r\ndistance between the Sun and the nearest fixed Stars; of whose\r\nAttractions all the Comets must keep clear, to return periodically, and\r\ngo round the Sun; and it shews us also, that the nearest Stars, which\r\nare probably those that seem the largest, are as big as our Sun, and of\r\nthe same nature with him; otherwise, they could not appear so large and\r\nbright to us as they do at such an immense distance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inferences drawn from the above phenomena.]\r\n\r\n94. The extreme heat, the dense atmosphere, the gross vapours, the\r\nchaotic state of the Comets, seem at first sight to indicate them\r\naltogether unfit for the purposes of animal life, and a most miserable\r\nhabitation for rational beings: and therefore [17]some are of opinion\r\nthat they are so many hells for tormenting the damned with perpetual\r\nvicissitudes of heat and cold. But, when we consider, on the other hand,\r\nthe infinite power and goodness of the Deity; the latter inclining, and\r\nthe former enabling him to make creatures suited to all states and\r\ncircumstances; that matter exists only for the sake of intelligence; and\r\nthat wherever we find it, we always find it pregnant with life, or\r\nnecessarily subservient thereto; the numberless species, the astonishing\r\ndiversity of animals in earth, air, water, and even on other animals;\r\nevery blade of grass, every tender leaf, every natural fluid, swarming\r\nwith life; and every one of these enjoying such gratifications as the\r\nnature and state of each requires: when we reflect moreover that some\r\ncenturies ago, till experience undeceived us, a great part of the Earth\r\nwas judged uninhabitable; the Torrid Zone by reason of excessive heat,\r\nand the two Frigid Zones because of their intollerable cold; it seems\r\nhighly probable, that such numerous and large masses of durable matter\r\nas the Comets are, however unlike they be to our Earth, are not\r\ndestitute of beings capable of contemplating with wonder, and\r\nacknowledging with gratitude the wisdom, symmetry, and beauty of the\r\nCreation; which is more plainly to be observed in their extensive Tour\r\nthrough the Heavens, than in our more confined Circuit. If farther\r\nconjecture is permitted, may we not suppose them instrumental in\r\nrecruiting the expended fuel of the Sun; and supplying the exhausted\r\nmoisture of the Planets? However difficult it may be, circumstanced as\r\nwe are, to find out their particular destination, this is an undoubted\r\ntruth, that wherever the Deity exerts his power, there he also manifests\r\nhis wisdom and goodness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This System very ancient, and demonstrable.]\r\n\r\n95. THE SOLAR SYSTEM here described is not a late invention; for it was\r\nknown and taught by the wise _Samian_ philosopher PYTHAGORAS, and others\r\namong the ancients; but in latter times was lost, ’till the 15th\r\ncentury, when it was again restored by the famous _Polish_ philosopher\r\nNICHOLAUS COPERNICUS, who was born at _Thorn_ in the year 1473. In this,\r\nhe was followed by the greatest mathematicians and philosophers that\r\nhave since lived; as KEPLER, GALILEO, DESCARTES, GASSENDUS, and Sir\r\nISAAC NEWTON; the last of whom has established this System on such an\r\neverlasting foundation of mathematical and physical demonstration, as\r\ncan never be shaken: and none who understand him can hesitate about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ptolemean System absurd.]\r\n\r\n96. In the _Ptolemean System_ the Earth was supposed to be fixed in the\r\nCenter of the Universe; and that the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun,\r\nMars, Jupiter, and Saturn moved round the Earth: above the Planets, this\r\nHypothesis placed the Firmament of Stars, and then the two Crystalline\r\nSpheres; all which were included in and received motion from the _Primum\r\nMobile_, which constantly revolved about the Earth in 24 hours, from\r\nEast to West. But as this rude Scheme was found incapable to stand the\r\ntest of art and observation, it was soon rejected by all true\r\nphilosophers; notwithstanding the opposition and violence of blind and\r\nzealous bigots.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tychonic System, partly true and partly false.]\r\n\r\n97. The _Tychonic System_ succeeded the _Ptolemean_, but was never so\r\ngenerally received. In this the Earth was supposed to stand still in the\r\nCenter of the Universe or Firmament of Stars, and the Sun to revolve\r\nabout it every 24 hours; the Planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn, going round the Sun in the times already mentioned. But some of\r\nTYCHO’s disciples supposed the Earth to have a diurnal motion round it’s\r\nAxis, and the Sun with all the above Planets to go round the Earth in a\r\nyear; the Planets moving round the Sun in the foresaid times. This\r\nhypothesis, being partly true and partly false, was embraced by few; and\r\nsoon gave way to the only true and rational System, restored by\r\nCOPERNICUS and demonstrated by Sir ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n98. To bring the foregoing particulars at once in view, with several\r\nothers which follow, concerning the Periods, Distances, Bulks, _&c._ of\r\nthe Planets, the following Table is inserted.\r\n\r\n

III.\r\n\r\n           _The_ COPERNICAN SYSTEM _demonstrated to be true_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of matter and motion.]\r\n\r\n99. Matter is of itself inactive, and indifferent to motion or rest. A\r\nbody at rest can never put itself in motion; a body in motion can never\r\nstop nor move slower of itself. Hence, when we see a body in motion we\r\nconclude some other substance must have given it that motion; when we\r\nsee a body fall from motion to rest we conclude some other body or cause\r\nstopt it.\r\n\r\n100. All motion is naturally rectilineal. A bullet thrown by the hand,\r\nor discharged from a cannon would continue to move in the same direction\r\nit received at first, if no other power diverted its course. Therefore,\r\nwhen we see a body moving in a curve of whatever kind, we conclude it\r\nmust be acted upon by two powers at least: one to put it in motion, and\r\nanother drawing it off from the rectilineal course which it would\r\notherwise have continued to move in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gravity demonstrable.]\r\n\r\n101. The power by which bodies fall towards the Earth is called\r\n_Gravity_ or _Attraction_. By this power in the Earth it is, that all\r\nbodies, on whatever side, fall in lines perpendicular to it’s surface.\r\nOn opposite parts of the Earth bodies fall in opposite directions, all\r\ntowards the centre where the force of gravity is as it were accumulated.\r\nBy this power constantly acting on bodies near the Earth they are kept\r\nfrom leaving it altogether; and those on its surface are kept thereto on\r\nall sides, so that they cannot fall from it. Bodies thrown with any\r\nobliquity are drawn by this power from a straight line into a curve,\r\nuntil they fall to the Ground: the greater the force by which they are\r\nthrown, the greater is the distance they are carried before they fall.\r\nIf we suppose a body carried several miles above the Earth, and there\r\nprojected in an horizontal direction, with so great a velocity that it\r\nwould move more than a semidiameter of the Earth, in the time it would\r\ntake to fall to the Earth by gravity; in that case, if there were no\r\nresisting medium in the way, the body would not fall to the Earth at\r\nall; but continue to circulate round the Earth, keeping always the same\r\npath, and returning to the point from whence it was projected, with the\r\nsame velocity as at first.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Projectile force demonstrable.]\r\n\r\n102. We find the Moon moves round the Earth in an Orbit nearly circular.\r\nThe Moon therefore must be acted on by two powers or forces; one which\r\nwould cause her to move in a right line, another bending her motion from\r\nthat line into a curve. This attractive power must be seated in the\r\nEarth; for there is no other body within the Moon’s Orbit to draw her.\r\nThe attractive power of the Earth therefore extends to the Moon; and, in\r\ncombination with her projectile force, causes her to move round the\r\nEarth in the same manner as the circulating body above supposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun and Planets attract each other.]\r\n\r\n103. The Moons of Jupiter and Saturn are observed to move round their\r\nprimary Planets: therefore there is such a power as gravity in these\r\nPlanets. All the Planets move round the Sun, and respect it for their\r\ncentre of motion: therefore the Sun must be endowed with attracting\r\nforce, as well as the Earth and Planets. The like may be proved of the\r\nComets. So that all the bodies or matter in the Solar System are\r\npossessed of this power; and perhaps so is all matter whatsoever.\r\n\r\n104. As the Sun attracts the Planets with their Satellites, and the\r\nEarth the Moon, so the Planets and Satellites re-attract the Sun, and\r\nthe Moon the Earth: action and re-action being always equal. This is\r\nalso confirmed by observation; for the Moon raises tides in the ocean,\r\nthe Satellites and Planets disturb one another’s motions.\r\n\r\n105. Every particle of matter being possessed of an attracting power,\r\nthe effect of the whole must be in proportion to the number of\r\nattracting particles: that is, to the quantity of matter in the body.\r\nThis is demonstrated from experiments on pendulums: for, if they are of\r\nequal lengths, whatever their weights be, they always vibrate in equal\r\ntimes. Now, if one be double the weight of another, the force of gravity\r\nor attraction must be double to make it oscillate with the same\r\ncelerity: if one is thrice the weight or quantity of matter of another,\r\nit requires thrice the force of gravity to make it move with the same\r\ncelerity. Hence it is certain, that the power of gravity is always\r\nproportional to the quantity of matter in bodies, whatever their bulks\r\nor figures are.\r\n\r\n106. Gravity also, like all other virtues or emanations issuing from a\r\ncentre, decreases as the square of the distance increases: that is, a\r\nbody at twice the distance attracts another with only a fourth part of\r\nthe force; at four times the distance, with a sixteenth part of the\r\nforce. This too is confirmed from observation, by comparing the distance\r\nwhich the Moon falls in a minute from a right line touching her Orbit,\r\nwith the space which bodies near the Earth fall in the same time: and\r\nalso by comparing the forces which retain Jupiter’s Moons in their\r\nOrbits. This will be more fully explained in the seventh Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gravitation and projection exemplified.]\r\n\r\n107. The mutual attraction of bodies may be exemplified by a boat and a\r\nship on the Water, tied by a rope. Let a man either in ship or boat pull\r\nthe rope (it is the same in effect at which end he pulls, for the rope\r\nwill be equally stretched throughout,) the ship and boat will be drawn\r\ntowards one another; but with this difference, that the boat will move\r\nas much faster than the ship as the ship is heavier than the boat.\r\nSuppose the boat as heavy as the ship, and they will draw one another\r\nequally (setting aside the greater resistance of the Water on the bigger\r\nbody) and meet in the middle of the first distance between them. If the\r\nship is a thousand or ten thousand times heavier than the boat, the boat\r\nwill be drawn a thousand or ten thousand times faster than the ship; and\r\nmeet proportionably nearer the place from which the ship set out. Now,\r\nwhilst one man pulls the rope, endeavouring to bring the ship and boat\r\ntogether, let another man, in the boat, endeavour to row her off\r\nsidewise, or at right Angles to the rope; and the former, instead of\r\nbeing able to draw the boat to the ship, will find it enough for him to\r\nkeep the boat from going further off; whilst the latter, endeavouring to\r\nrow off the boat in a straight line, will, by means of the other’s\r\npulling it towards the ship, row the boat round the ship at the rope’s\r\nlength from her. Here, the power employed to draw the ship and boat to\r\none another represents the mutual attraction of the Sun and Planets, by\r\nwhich the Planets would fall freely towards the Sun with a quick motion;\r\nand would also in falling attract the Sun towards them. And the power\r\nemployed to row off the boat represents the projectile force impressed\r\non the Planets at right Angles, or nearly so, to the Sun’s attraction;\r\nby which means the Planets move round the Sun, and are kept from falling\r\nto it. On the other hand, if it be attempted to make a heavy ship go\r\nround a light boat, they will meet sooner than the ship can get round;\r\nor the ship will drag the boat after it.\r\n\r\n\r\n108. Let the above principles be applied to the Sun and Earth; and they\r\nwill evince, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the Sun, not the Earth,\r\nis the center of the System; and that the Earth moves round the Sun as\r\nthe other Planets do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The absurdity of supposing the Earth at rest.]\r\n\r\nFor, if the Sun moves about the Earth, the Earth’s attractive power must\r\ndraw the Sun towards it from the line of projection so, as to bend it’s\r\nmotion into a curve; and the Earth being at least 169 thousand times\r\nlighter than the Sun, by being so much less as to it’s quantity of\r\nmatter, must move 169 thousand times faster toward the Sun than the Sun\r\ndoes toward the Earth; and consequently would fall to the Sun in a short\r\ntime if it had not a very strong projectile motion to carry it off. The\r\nEarth therefore, as well as every other Planet in the System, must have\r\na rectilineal impulse to prevent its falling into the Sun. To say, that\r\ngravitation retains all the other Planets in their Orbits without\r\naffecting the Earth, which is placed between the Orbits of Mars and\r\nVenus, is as absurd as to suppose that six cannon bullets might be\r\nprojected upwards to different heights in the Air, and that five of them\r\nshould fall down to the ground; but the sixth, which is neither the\r\nhighest nor the lowest, should remain suspended in the Air without\r\nfalling; and the Earth move round about it.\r\n\r\n109. There is no such thing in nature as a heavy body moving round a\r\nlight one as its centre of motion. A pebble fastened to a mill-stone by\r\na string, may by an easy impulse be made to circulate round the\r\nmill-stone: but no impulse can make a mill-stone circulate round a loose\r\npebble, for the heaviest would undoubtedly carry the lightest along with\r\nit wherever it goes.\r\n\r\n110. The Sun is so immensely bigger and heavier than the Earth[18], that\r\nif he was moved out of his place, not only the Earth, but all the other\r\nPlanets if they were united into one mass, would be carried along with\r\nthe Sun as the pebble would be with the mill-stone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The harmony of the celestial motions.\r\n\r\n           The absurdity of supposing the Stars and Planets to move round\r\n           the Earth.]\r\n\r\n111. By considering the law of gravitation, which takes place throughout\r\nthe Solar System, in another light, it will be evident that the Earth\r\nmoves round the Sun in a year; and not the Sun round the Earth. It has\r\nbeen shewn (§ 106) that the power of gravity decreases as the square of\r\nthe distance increases: and from this it follows with mathematical\r\ncertainty, that when two or more bodies move round another as their\r\ncentre of motion, the squares of their periodic times will be to one\r\nanother in the same proportion as the cubes of their distances from the\r\ncentral body. This holds precisely with regard to the Planets round the\r\nSun, and the Satellites round the Planets; the relative distances of all\r\nwhich, are well known. But, if we suppose the Sun to move round the\r\nEarth, and compare its period with the Moon’s by the above rule, it will\r\nbe found that the Sun would take no less than 173,510 days to move round\r\nthe Earth, in which case our year would be 475 times as long as it now\r\nis. To this we may add, that the aspects of increase and decrease of the\r\nPlanets, the times of their seeming to stand still, and to move direct\r\nand retrograde, answer precisely to the Earth’s motion; but not at all\r\nto the Sun’s without introducing the most absurd and monstrous\r\nsuppositions, which would destroy all harmony, order, and simplicity in\r\nthe System. Moreover, if the Earth is supposed to stand still, and the\r\nStars to revolve in free spaces about the Earth in 24 hours, it is\r\ncertain that the forces by which the Stars revolve in their Orbits are\r\nnot directed to the Earth, but to the centres of the several Orbits:\r\nthat is, of the several parallel Circles which the Stars on different\r\nsides of the Equator describe every day: and the like inferences may be\r\ndrawn from the supposed diurnal motion of the Planets, since they are\r\nnever in the Equinoctial but twice, in their courses with regard to the\r\nstarry Heavens. But, that forces should be directed to no central body,\r\non which they physically depend, but to innumerable imaginary points in\r\nthe axe of the Earth produced to the Poles of the Heavens, is an\r\nhypothesis too absurd to be allowed of by any rational creature. And it\r\nis still more absurd to imagine that these forces should increase\r\nexactly in proportion to the distances from this axe; for this is an\r\nindication of an increase to infinity: whereas the force of attraction\r\nis found to decrease in receding from the fountain from whence it flows.\r\nBut, the farther that any Star is from the quiescent Pole the greater\r\nmust be the Orbit which it describes; and yet it appears to go round in\r\nthe same time as the nearest Star to the Pole does. And if we take into\r\nconsideration the two-fold motion observed in the Stars, one diurnal\r\nround the Axis of the Earth in 24 hours, and the other round the Axis of\r\nthe Ecliptic in 25920 years § 251, it would require an explication of\r\nsuch a perplexed composition of forces, as could by no means be\r\nreconciled with any physical Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objections against the Earth’s motion answered.]\r\n\r\n112. There is but one objection of any weight that can be made to the\r\nEarth’s motion round the Sun; which is, that in opposite points of the\r\nEarth’s Orbit, it’s Axis which always keeps a parallel direction would\r\npoint to different fixed Stars; which is not found to be fact. But this\r\nobjection is easily removed by considering the immense distance of the\r\nStars in respect of the diameter of the Earth’s Orbit; the latter being\r\nno more than a point when compared to the former. If we lay a ruler on\r\nthe side of a table, and along the edge of the ruler view the top of a\r\nspire at ten miles distance; then lay the ruler on the opposite side of\r\nthe table in a parallel situation to what it had before, and the spire\r\nwill still appear along the edge of the ruler; because our eyes, even\r\nwhen assisted by the best instruments are incapable of distinguishing so\r\nsmall a change.\r\n\r\n113. Dr. BRADLEY, our present Astronomer Royal, has found by a long\r\nseries of the most accurate observations, that there is a small apparent\r\nmotion of the fixed Stars, occasioned by the aberration of their light,\r\nand so exactly answering to an annual motion of the Earth, as evinces\r\nthe same, even to a mathematical demonstration. Those who are qualified\r\nto read the Doctor’s modest Account of this great discovery may consult\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_, N^o 406. Or they may find it treated\r\nof at large by Drs. SMITH[19], LONG[20], DESAGULIERS[21], RUTHERFURTH,\r\nMr. MACLAURIN[22], and M. DE LA CAILLE[23].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Sun appears to change his place.]\r\n\r\n114. It is true that the Sun seems to change his place daily, so as to\r\nmake a tour round the starry Heavens in a year. But whether the Earth or\r\nSun moves, this appearance will be the same; for, when the Earth is in\r\nany part of the Heavens, the Sun will appear in the opposite. And\r\ntherefore, this appearance can be no objection against the motion of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n115. It is well known to every person who has sailed on smooth Water, or\r\nbeen carried by a stream in a calm, that however fast the vessel goes he\r\ndoes not feel its progressive motion. The motion of the Earth is\r\nincomparably more smooth and uniform than that of a ship, or any machine\r\nmade and moved by human art: and therefore it is not to be imagined that\r\nwe can feel it’s motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth’s motion on it’s Axis demonstrated.]\r\n\r\n116. We find that the Sun, and those Planets on which there are visible\r\nspots, turn round their Axes: for the spots move regularly over their\r\nDisks[24]. From hence we may reasonably conclude that the other Planets\r\non which we see no spots, and the Earth which is likewise a Planet, have\r\nsuch rotations. But being incapable of leaving the Earth, and viewing it\r\nat a distance; and it’s rotation being smooth and uniform, we can\r\nneither see it move on it’s Axis as we do the Planets, nor feel\r\nourselves affected by it’s motion. Yet there is one effect of such a\r\nmotion which will enable us to judge with certainty whether the Earth\r\nrevolves on it’s Axis or not. All Globes which do not turn round their\r\nAxes will be perfect spheres, on account of the equality of the weight\r\nof bodies on their surfaces; especially of the fluid parts. But all\r\nGlobes which turn on their Axes will be oblate spheroids; that is, their\r\nsurfaces will be higher, or farther from the centre, in the equatoreal\r\nthan in the polar Regions: for, as the equatoreal parts move quickest,\r\nthey will recede farther from the Axis of motion, and enlarge the\r\nequatoreal diameter. That our Earth is really of this figure is\r\ndemonstrable from the unequal vibrations of a pendulum, and the unequal\r\nlengths of degrees in different latitudes. Since then, the Earth is\r\nhigher at the Equator than at the Poles, the sea, which naturally runs\r\ndownward, or towards the places which are nearest the centre, would run\r\ntowards the polar Regions, and leave the equatoreal parts dry, if the\r\ncentrifugal force of these parts did not raise and carry the waters\r\nthither. The Earth’s equatoreal diameter is 35 miles longer than its\r\nAxis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: All bodies heavier at the Poles than they would be at the\r\n           Equator.]\r\n\r\n117. Bodies near the Poles are heavier than those towards the Equator,\r\nbecause they are nearer the Earth’s centre, where the whole force of the\r\nEarth’s attraction is accumulated. They are also heavier because their\r\ncentrifugal force is less on account of their diurnal motion being\r\nslower. For both these reasons, bodies carried from the Poles toward the\r\nEquator, gradually lose of their weight. Experiments prove that a\r\npendulum, which vibrates seconds near the Poles vibrates slower near the\r\nEquator, which shews that it is lighter or less attracted there. To make\r\nit oscillate in the same time, ’tis found necessary to diminish it’s\r\nlength. By comparing the different lengths of pendulums swinging seconds\r\nat the Equator and at _London_, it is found that a pendulum must be\r\n2-169/1000 lines shorter at the Equator than at the Poles. A line is a\r\ntwelfth part of an inch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How they might lose all their weight.]\r\n\r\n118. If the Earth turned round it’s Axis in 84 minutes 43 seconds, the\r\ncentrifugal force would be equal to the power of gravity at the Equator;\r\nand all bodies there would entirely lose their weight. If the Earth\r\nrevolved quicker they would all fly off, and leave it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth’s motion cannot be felt.]\r\n\r\n119. One on the Earth can no more be sensible of it’s undisturbed motion\r\non it’s Axis, than one in the cabin of a ship on smooth Water can be\r\nsensible of her motion when she turns gently and uniformly round. It is\r\ntherefore no argument against the Earth’s diurnal motion that we do not\r\nfeel it: nor is the apparent revolutions of the celestial bodies every\r\nday a proof of the reality of these motions; for whether we or they\r\nrevolve, the appearance is the very same. A person looking through the\r\ncabin windows of a ship as strongly fancies the objects on land to go\r\nround when the ship turns, as if they were actually in motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To the different Planets the Heavens appear to turn round on\r\n           different Axes.]\r\n\r\n120. If we could translate ourselves from Planet to Planet, we should\r\nstill find that the Stars would appear of the same magnitudes, and at\r\nthe same distances from each other, as they do to us here; because the\r\nwidth of the remotest Planet’s Orbit bears no sensible proportion to the\r\ndistance of the Stars. But then, the Heavens would seem to revolve about\r\nvery different Axes; and consequently, those quiescent Points which are\r\nour Poles in the Heavens would seem to revolve about other points,\r\nwhich, though apparently in motion to us on Earth would be at rest as\r\nseen from any other Planet. Thus, the Axis of Venus, which lies almost\r\nat right Angles to the Axis of the Earth, would have it’s motionless\r\nPoles in two opposite points of the Heavens lying almost in our\r\nEquinoctial, where the motion appears quickest because it is performed\r\nin the greatest Circle. And the very Poles, which are at rest to us,\r\nhave the quickest motion of all as seen from Venus. To Mars and Jupiter\r\nthe Heavens appear to turn round with very different velocities on the\r\nsame Axis, whose Poles are about 23-1/2 degrees from ours. Were we on\r\nJupiter we should be at first amazed at the rapid motion of the Heavens;\r\nthe Sun and Stars going round in 9 hours 56 minutes. Could we go from\r\nthence to Venus we should be as much surprised at the slowness of the\r\nheavenly motions: the Sun going but once round in 584 hours, and the\r\nStars in 540. And could we go from Venus to the Moon we should see the\r\nHeavens turn round with a yet slower motion; the Sun in 708 hours, the\r\nStars in 655. As it is impossible these various circumvolutions in such\r\ndifferent times and on such different Axes can be real, so it is\r\nunreasonable to suppose the Heavens to revolve about our Earth more than\r\nit does about any other Planet. When we reflect on the vast distance of\r\nthe fixed Stars, to which 162,000,000 of miles is but a point, we are\r\nfilled with amazement at the immensity of their distance. But if we try\r\nto frame an idea of the extreme rapidity with which the Stars must move,\r\nif they move round the Earth in 24 hours, the thought becomes so much\r\ntoo big for our imagination, that we can no more conceive it than we do\r\ninfinity or eternity. If the Sun was to go round the Earth in a day, he\r\nmust travel upwards of 300,000 miles in a minute: but the Stars being at\r\nleast 10,000 times as far as the Sun from us, those about the Equator\r\nmust move 10,000 times as quick. And all this to serve no other purpose\r\nthan what can be as fully and much more simply obtained by the Earth’s\r\nturning round eastward as on an Axis, every 24 hours, causing thereby an\r\napparent diurnal motion of the Sun westward, and bringing about the\r\nalternate returns of day and night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objections against the Earth’s diurnal motion answered.]\r\n\r\n121. As to the common objections against the Earth’s motion on it’s\r\nAxis, they are all easily answered and set aside. That it may turn\r\nwithout being seen or felt to do so, has been already shewn, § 119. But\r\nsome are apt to imagine that if the Earth turns eastward (as it\r\ncertainly does if it turns at all) a ball fired perpendicularly upward\r\nin the air must fall considerably westward of the place it was projected\r\nfrom. This objection, which at first seems to have some weight, will be\r\nfound to have none at all when we consider that the gun and ball partake\r\nof the Earth’s motion; and therefore the ball being carried forward with\r\nthe air as quick as the Earth and air turn, must fall down again on the\r\nsame place. A stone let fall from the top of a main-mast, if it meets\r\nwith no obstacle, falls on the deck as near the foot of the mast when\r\nthe ship sails as when it does not. And if an inverted bottle, full of\r\nliquor, be hung up to the cieling of the cabin, and a small hole be made\r\nin the cork to let the liquor drop through on the floor, the drops will\r\nfall just as far forward on the floor when the ship sails as when it is\r\nat rest. And gnats or flies can as easily dance among one another in a\r\nmoving cabin as in a fixed chamber. As for those scripture expressions\r\nwhich seem to contradict the Earth’s motion, this general answer may be\r\nmade to them all, _viz._ ’tis plain from many instances that the\r\nScriptures were never intended to instruct us in Philosophy or\r\nAstronomy; and therefore, on those subjects, expressions are not always\r\nto be taken in the strictest sense; but for the most part as\r\naccommodated to the common apprehensions of mankind. Men of sense in all\r\nages, when not treating of the sciences purposely, have followed this\r\nmethod: and it would be in vain to follow any other in addressing\r\nourselves to the vulgar, or bulk of any community. _Moses_ calls the\r\nMoon A GREAT LUMINARY (as it is in the Hebrew) as well as the Sun: but\r\nthe Moon is known to be an opaque body, and the smallest that\r\nAstronomers have observed in the Heavens and shines upon us not by any\r\ninherent light of it’s own, but by reflecting the light of the Sun. If\r\n_Moses_ had known this, and told the _Israelites_ so, they would have\r\nstared at him; and considered him rather as a madman than as a person\r\ncommissioned by the Almighty to be their leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n   _The Phenomena of the Heavens as seen from different parts of the\r\n                                Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: We are kept to the Earth by gravity.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II. Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Antipodes.\r\n\r\n           Axis of the World. It’s Poles. Fig. II.]\r\n\r\n122. We are kept to the Earth’s surface on all sides by the power of\r\nit’s central attraction; which, laying hold of all bodies according to\r\ntheir densities or quantities of matter without regard to their bulks,\r\nconstitutes what we call their _weight_. And having the sky over our\r\nheads, go where we will, and our feet towards the centre of the Earth,\r\nwe call it _up_ over our heads, and _down_ under our feet: although the\r\nsame right line which is _down_ to us, if continued through and beyond\r\nthe opposite side of the Earth, would be _up_ to the inhabitants on the\r\nopposite side. For, the inhabitants _n_, _i_, _e_, _m_, _s_, _o_, _q_,\r\n_l_ stand with their feet toward the Earth’s centre _C_; and have the\r\nsame figure of sky _N_, _l_, _E_, _M_, _S_, _O_, _Q_, _L_ over their\r\nheads. Therefore, the point _S_ is as directly upward to the inhabitant\r\n_s_ on the south Pole as _N_ is to the inhabitant _n_ on the North Pole:\r\nso is _E_ to the inhabitant _e_, supposed to be on the north end of\r\n_Peru_; and _Q_ to the opposite inhabitant _q_ on the middle of the\r\nisland _Sumatra_. Each of these observers is surprised that his opposite\r\nor _Antipode_ can stand with his head hanging downwards. But let either\r\ngo to the other, and he will tell him that he stood as upright and firm\r\non the place where he was as he now stands where he is. To all these\r\nobservers the Sun, Moon, and Stars seem to turn round the points _N_ and\r\n_S_ as the Poles of the fixed Axis _NCS_; because the Earth does really\r\nturn round the mathematical line _nCs_ as round an Axis of which _n_ is\r\nthe North Pole and _s_ the South Pole. The Inhabitant _U_ (Fig. II.)\r\naffirms that he is on the uppermost side of the Earth, and wonders how\r\nanother at _L_ can stand on the undermost side with his head hanging\r\ndownwards. But _U_ in the mean time forgets that in twelve hours time he\r\nwill be carried half round with the Earth; and then be in the very\r\nsituation that _L_ now is, although as far from him as before. And yet,\r\nwhen _U_ comes there, he will find no difference as to his manner of\r\nstanding; only he will see the opposite half of the Heavens, and imagine\r\nthe Heavens to have gone half round him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How our Earth might have an upper and an under side.]\r\n\r\n123. When we see a globe hung up in a room we cannot help imagining it\r\nto have an upper and an under side, and immediately form a like idea of\r\nthe Earth; from whence we conclude, that it is as impossible for persons\r\nto stand on the under side of the Earth as for pebbles to lie on the\r\nunder side of a common Globe, which instantly fall down from it to the\r\nground; and well they may, because the attraction of the Earth, being\r\ntoo strong for the attraction of the Globe, pulls them away. Just so\r\nwould be the case with our Earth, if it were placed near a Globe much\r\nbigger than itself, such as Jupiter: for then it would really have an\r\nupper and an under side with respect to that large Globe; which, by it’s\r\nAttraction, would pull away every thing from the side of the Earth next\r\nto it; and only those on the top of the opposite or upper side could\r\nkeep upon it. But there is no larger Globe near enough our Earth to\r\novercome it’s central attraction; and therefore it has no such thing as\r\nan upper and an under side: for all bodies on or near it’s surface, even\r\nto the Moon, gravitate towards it’s center.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n124. Let any man imagine that the Earth and every thing but himself is\r\ntaken away, and he left alone in the midst of indefinite Space; he could\r\nthen have no idea of _up_ or _down_; and were his pockets full of gold,\r\nhe might take the pieces one by one, and throw them away on all sides of\r\nhim, without any danger of losing them; for the attraction of his body\r\nwould bring them all back by the ways they went, and _he_ would be\r\n_down_ to every one of them. But then, if a Sun or any other large body\r\nwere created, and placed in any part of Space several millions of miles\r\nfrom him, he would be attracted towards it, and could not save himself\r\nfrom falling _down_ to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           One half of the Heavens visible to an inhabitant on any part\r\n           of the Earth.\r\n\r\n           Phenomena at the Poles.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n125. The Earth’s bulk is but a point, as that at _C_, compared to the\r\nHeavens; and therefore every inhabitant upon it, let him be where he\r\nwill, as at _n_, _e_, _m_, _s_, &c. sees one half of the Heavens. The\r\ninhabitant _n_, on the North Pole of the Earth, constantly sees the\r\nHemisphere _ENQ_; and having the North Pole _N_ of the Heavens just over\r\nhis head, his [25]Horizon coincides with the Celestial Equator _ECQ_.\r\nTherefore all the Stars in the Northern Hemisphere _ENC_, between the\r\nEquator and North Pole, appear to turn round the line _NC_, moving\r\nparallel to the Horizon. The Equatoreal Stars keep in the Horizon, and\r\nall those in the Southern Hemisphere _ESQ_ are invisible. The like\r\nPhenomena are seen by the observer _s_ on the South Pole, with respect\r\nto the Hemisphere _ESQ_; and to him the opposite Hemisphere is always\r\ninvisible. Hence, under either Pole, only one half of the Heavens is\r\nseen; for those parts which are once visible never set, and those which\r\nare once invisible never rise. But the Ecliptic _YCX_ or Orbit which the\r\nSun appears to describe once a year by the Earth’s annual motion, has\r\nthe half _YC_ constantly above the Horizon _ECQ_ of the North Pole _n_;\r\nand the other half _CX_ always below it. Therefore whilst the Sun\r\ndescribes the northern half _YC_ of the Ecliptic he neither sets to the\r\nNorth Pole nor rises to the South; and whilst he describes the southern\r\nhalf _CX_ he neither sets to the South Pole nor rises to the North. The\r\nsame things are true with respect to the Moon; only with this\r\ndifference, that as the Sun describes the Ecliptic but once a year, he\r\nis for half that time visible to each Pole in it’s turn, and as long\r\ninvisible; but as the Moon goes round the Ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours,\r\nshe is only visible for 13 days 16 hours, and as long invisible to each\r\nPole by turns. All the Planets likewise rise and set to the Poles,\r\nbecause their Orbits are cut obliquely in halves by the Horizon of the\r\nPoles. When the Sun (in his apparent way from _X_) arrives at _C_, which\r\nis on the 20th of _March_, he is just rising to an observer at _n_ on\r\nthe North Pole, and setting to another at _s_ on the South Pole. From\r\n_C_ he rises higher and higher in every apparent Diurnal revolution\r\n’till he comes to the highest point of the Ecliptic _y_, on the 21st of\r\n_June_, and then he is at his greatest Altitude, which is 23-1/2\r\ndegrees, or the Arc _Ey_, equal to his greatest North declination; and\r\nfrom thence he seems to descend gradually in every apparent\r\nCircumvolution, ’till he sets at _C_ on the 23d of _September_; and then\r\nhe goes to exhibit the like Appearances at the South Pole for the other\r\nhalf of the year. Hence the Sun’s apparent motion round the Earth is not\r\nin parallel Circles, but in Spirals; such as might be represented by a\r\nthread wound round a Globe from Tropic to Tropic; the Spirals being at\r\nsome distance from one another about the Equator, but gradually nearer\r\nto each other as they approach nearer to the Tropics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phenomena at the Equator.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n126. If the observer be any where on the Terrestrial Equator _eCq_, as\r\nsuppose at _e_, he is in the Plane of the Celestial Equator; or under\r\nthe Equinoctial _ECQ_; and the Axis of the Earth _nCs_ is coincident\r\nwith the Plane of his Horizon, extended out to _N_ and _S_, the North\r\nand South Poles of the Heavens. As the Earth turns round the line _NCS_,\r\nthe whole Heavens _MOLl_ seem to turn round the same line, but the\r\ncontrary way. It is plain that this observer has the Poles constantly in\r\nhis Horizon, and that his Horizon cuts the Diurnal paths of all the\r\nCelestial bodies perpendicularly and in halves. Therefore the Sun,\r\nPlanets, and Stars rise every day, and ascend perpendicularly above the\r\nHorizon for six hours, and passing over the Meridian, descend in the\r\nsame manner for the six following hours; then set in the Horizon, and\r\ncontinue twelve hours below it. Consequently at the Equator the days and\r\nnights are equally long throughout the year. When the observer is in the\r\nsituation _e_, he sees the Hemisphere _SEN_; but in twelve hours after,\r\nhe is carried half round the Earth’s Axis to _q_, and then the\r\nHemisphere _SQN_ becomes visible to him; and _SEN_ disappears, being hid\r\nby the Convexity of the Earth. Thus we find that to an observer at\r\neither of the Poles one half of the Sky is always visible, and the other\r\nhalf never seen; but to an observer on the Equator the whole Sky is seen\r\nevery 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe Figure here referred to, represents a Celestial globe of glass,\r\nhaving a Terrestrial globe within it; after the manner of the Glass\r\nSphere invented by my generous friend Dr. LONG, _Lowndes_’s Professor of\r\nAstronomy in _Cambridge_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remark.]\r\n\r\n127. If a Globe be held sidewise to the eye, at some distance, and so\r\nthat neither of it’s Poles can be seen, the Equator _ECQ_ and all\r\nCircles parallel to it, as _DL_, _yzx_, _abX_, _MO_, &c. will appear to\r\nbe straight lines, as projected in this Figure; which is requisite to be\r\nmentioned here, because we shall have occasion to call them Circles in\r\nthe following Article[26].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phenomena between the Equator and Poles.\r\n\r\n           The Circles of perpetual Apparition and Occultation.]\r\n\r\n128. Let us now suppose that the observer has gone from the Equator e\r\ntowards the North Pole _n_, and that he stops at _i_, from which place\r\nhe then sees the Hemisphere _MElNL_; his Horizon _MCL_ having shifted as\r\nmany [27]Degrees from the Celestial poles _N_ and _S_ as he has\r\ntravelled from under the Equinoctial _E_. And as the Heavens seem\r\nconstantly to turn round the line _NCS_ as an Axis, all those Stars\r\nwhich are as far from the North Pole _N_ as the observer is from under,\r\nthe Equinoctial, namely the Stars north of the dotted parallel _DL_,\r\nnever set below the Horizon; and those which are south of the dotted\r\nparallel _MO_ never rise above it. Hence, the former of these two\r\nparallel Circles is called _the Circle of perpetual Apparition_, and the\r\nlatter _the Circle of perpetual Occultation_: but all the Stars between\r\nthese two Circles rise and set every day. Let us imagine many Circles to\r\nbe drawn between these two, and parallel to them; those which are on the\r\nnorth side of the Equinoctial will be unequally cut by the Horizon\r\n_MCL_, having larger portions above the Horizon than below it; and the\r\nmore so, as they are nearer to the Circle of perpetual Apparition; but\r\nthe reverse happens to those on the south side of the Equinoctial,\r\nwhilst the Equinoctial is divided in two equal parts by the Horizon.\r\nHence, by the apparent turning of the Heavens, the northern Stars\r\ndescribe greater Arcs or Portions of Circles above the Horizon than\r\nbelow it; and the greater as they are farther from the Equinoctial\r\ntowards the Circle of perpetual Apparition; whilst the contrary happens\r\nto all Stars south of the Equinoctial: but those upon it describe equal\r\nArcs both above and below the Horizon, and therefore they are just as\r\nlong above as below it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n129. An observer on the Equator has no Circle of perpetual Apparition or\r\nOccultation, because all the Stars, together with the Sun and Moon, rise\r\nand set to him every day. But, as a bare view of the Figure is\r\nsufficient to shew that these two Circles _DL_ and _MO_ are just as far\r\nfrom the Poles _N_ and _S_ as the observer at _i_ (or one opposite to\r\nhim at _o_) is from the Equator _ECQ_; it is plain, that if an observer\r\nbegins to travel from the Equator towards either Pole, his Circle of\r\nperpetual Apparition rises from that Pole as from a Point, and his\r\nCircle of perpetual Occultation from the other. As the observer advances\r\ntoward the nearer Pole, these two Circles enlarge their diameters, and\r\ncome nearer one another, until he comes to the Pole; and then they meet\r\nand coincide in the Equator. On different sides of the Equator, to\r\nobservers at equal distances from it, the Circle of perpetual Apparition\r\nto one is the Circle of perpetual Occultation to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Stars always describe the same parallel of motion,\r\n           and the Sun a different.]\r\n\r\n130. Because the Stars never vary their distances from the Equinoctial,\r\nso as to be sensible in an age, the lengths of their diurnal and\r\nnocturnal Arcs are always the same to the same places on the Earth. But\r\nas the Earth goes round the Sun every year in the Ecliptic, one half of\r\nwhich is on the north side of the Equinoctial and the other half on it’s\r\nsouth side, the Sun appears to change his place every day, so as to go\r\nonce round the Circle _YCX_ every year § 114. Therefore whilst the Sun\r\nappears to advance northward, from having described the Parallel _abX_\r\ntouching the Ecliptic in _X_ the days continually lengthen and the\r\nnights shorten, until he comes to _y_ and describes the Parallel _yzx_,\r\nwhen the days are at the longest and the nights at the shortest: for\r\nthen, as the Sun goes no farther northward, the greatest portion that is\r\npossible of the diurnal Arc _yz_ is above the Horizon of the inhabitant\r\n_i_; and the smallest portion _zx_ below it. As the Sun declines\r\nsouthward from _y_ he describes smaller diurnal and greater nocturnal\r\nArcs, or Portions of Circles, every day; which causeth the days to\r\nshorten and nights to lengthen, until he arrives again at the Parallel\r\n_abX_; which having only the small part _ab_ above the Horizon _MCL_,\r\nand the great part _bX_ below it, the days are at the shortest and the\r\nnights at the longest; because the Sun recedes no farther south, but\r\nreturns northward as before. It is easy to see that the Sun must be in\r\nthe Equinoctial _ECQ_ twice every year, and then the days and nights are\r\nequally long; that is, 12 hours each. These hints serve at present to\r\ngive an idea of some of the Appearances resulting from the motions of\r\nthe Earth; which will be more particularly described in the tenth\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Parallel, Oblique, and Right sphere, what.]\r\n\r\n131. To an observer at either Pole, the Horizon and Equinoctial are\r\ncoincident; and the Sun and Stars seem to move parallel to the Horizon:\r\ntherefore, such an observer is said to have a Parallel position of the\r\nSphere. To an observer any where between the Poles and Equator, the\r\nParallels described by the Sun and Stars are cut obliquely by the\r\nHorizon, and therefore he is said to have an Oblique position of the\r\nSphere. To an observer any where on the Equator, the Parallels of\r\nMotion, described by the Sun and Stars are cut perpendicularly, or at\r\nRight angles, by the Horizon; and therefore he is said to have a Right\r\nposition of the Sphere. And these three are all the different ways that\r\nthe Sphere can be posited to all people, on the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_The Phenomena of the Heavens as seen from different Parts of the Solar\r\n                                System._\r\n\r\n\r\n132. So vastly great is the distance of the starry Heavens, that if\r\nviewed from any part of the Solar System, or even many millions of miles\r\nbeyond it, its appearance would be the very same to us. The Sun and\r\nStars would all seem to be fixed on one concave surface, of which the\r\nSpectator’s eye would be the centre. But the Planets, being much nearer\r\nthan the Stars, their appearances will vary considerably with the place\r\nfrom which they are viewed.\r\n\r\n133. If the spectator is at rest without their Orbits, the Planets will\r\nseem to be at the same distance as the Stars; but continually changing\r\ntheir places with respect to the Stars, and to one another: assuming\r\nvarious phases of increase and decrease like the Moon. And,\r\nnotwithstanding their regular motions about the Sun, will sometimes\r\nappear to move quicker, sometimes slower, be as often to the west as to\r\nthe east of the Sun; and at their greatest distances seem quite\r\nstationary. The duration, extent, and points in the Heavens where these\r\ndigressions begin and end, would be more or less according to the\r\nrespective distances of the several Planets from the Sun: but in the\r\nsame Planet they would continue invariably the same at all times; like\r\npendulums of unequal lengths oscillating together, the shorter move\r\nquick and go over a small space, the longer move slow and go over a\r\nlarge space. If the observer is at rest within the Orbits of the\r\nPlanets, but not near the common center, their apparent motions will be\r\nirregular, but less so than in the former case. Each of the several\r\nPlanets will appear bigger and less by turns, as they approach nearer or\r\nrecede farther from the observer; the nearest varying most in their\r\nsize. They will also move quicker or slower with regard to the fixed\r\nStars, but will never be retrograde or stationary.\r\n\r\n134. Next, let a spectator in motion view the Heavens: the same apparent\r\nirregularities will be observed, but with some variation resulting from\r\nhis own motion. If he is on a Planet which has a rotation on it’s Axis,\r\nnot being sensible of his own motion he will imagine the whole Heavens,\r\nSun, Planets, and Stars to revolve about him in the same time that his\r\nPlanet turns round, but the contrary way; and will not be easily\r\nconvinced of the deception. If his Planet moves round the Sun, the same\r\nirregularities and aspects as above will appear in the motions of the\r\nPlanets: only, the times of their being direct, stationary and\r\nretrograde will be accelerated or retarded as they concur with, or are\r\ncontrary to his motion: and the Sun will seem to move among the fixed\r\nStars or Signs, directly opposite to those in which his Planet moves;\r\nchanging it’s place every day as he does. In a word, whether our\r\nobserver be in motion or at rest, whether within or without the Orbits\r\nof the Planets, their motions will seem irregular, intricate and\r\nperplexed, unless he is in the center of the System; and from thence,\r\nthe most beautiful order and harmony will be observed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun’s center the only point from which the true motions\r\n           and places of the Planets could be seen.]\r\n\r\n135. The Sun being the center of all the Planets motions, the only place\r\nfrom which their motions could be truly seen, is the Sun’s center; where\r\nthe observer being supposed not to turn round with the Sun (which, in\r\nthis case, we must imagine to be a transparent body) would see all the\r\nStars at rest, and seemingly equidistant from him. To such an observer\r\nthe Planets would appear to move among the fixed Stars, in a simple,\r\nregular, and uniform manner; only, that as in equal times they describe\r\nequal Areas, they would describe spaces somewhat unequal, because they\r\nmove in elliptic Orbits § 155. Their motions would also appear to be\r\nwhat they are in fact, the same way round the Heavens; in paths which\r\ncross at small Angles in different parts of the Heavens, and then\r\nseparate a little from one another § 20. So that, if the solar\r\nAstronomer should make the Path or Orbit of any one Planet a standard,\r\nand consider it as having no obliquity § 201, he would judge the paths\r\nof all the rest to be inclined to it; each Planet having one half of\r\nit’s path on one side, and the other half on the opposite side of the\r\nstandard Path or Orbit. And if he should ever see all the Planets start\r\nfrom a conjunction with each other[28]; Mercury would move so much\r\nfaster than Venus as to overtake her again (though not in the same point\r\nof the Heavens) in a quantity of time almost equal to 145 of our days\r\nand nights; or, as we commonly call them, _Natural Days_, which include\r\nboth the days and nights: Venus would move so much faster than the Earth\r\nas to overtake it again in 585 natural days: the Earth so much faster\r\nthan Mars as to overtake him again in 778 such days: Mars is much faster\r\nthan Jupiter as to overtake him again in 817 such days: and Jupiter so\r\nmuch faster than Saturn as to overtake him again in 7236 days, all of\r\nour time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The judgment that a solar Astronomer would probably make\r\n           concerning the distances and bulks of the Planets.]\r\n\r\n136. But as our solar Astronomer could have no idea of measuring the\r\ncourses of the Planets by our days, he would very probably take the\r\nperiod of Mercury, which is the quickest moving Planet, for a measure to\r\ncompare the periods of the others by. As all the Stars would appear\r\nquiescent to him, he would never think that they had any dependance upon\r\nthe Sun; but could naturally imagine that the Planets have, because they\r\nmove round the Sun. And it is by no means improbable, that he would\r\nconclude those Planets whose periods are quickest to move in Orbits\r\nproportionably less than those do which make slower circuits. But being\r\ndestitute of a method for finding their Parallaxes, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, as they could have no Parallax to him, he could never know any\r\nthing of their real distances or magnitudes. Their relative distances he\r\nmight perhaps guess at by their periods, and from thence infer something\r\nof truth concerning their relative bulks, by comparing their apparent\r\nbulks with one another. For example, Jupiter appearing bigger to him\r\nthan Mars, he would conclude it to be much bigger in fact; because it\r\nappears so, and must be farther from him, on account of it’s longer\r\nperiod. Mercury would seem bigger than the Earth; but by comparing it’s\r\nperiod with the Earth’s, he would conclude that the Earth is much\r\nfarther from him than Mercury, and consequently that it must be really\r\nbigger though apparently less; and so of the rest. And, as each Planet\r\nwould appear somewhat bigger in one part of it’s Orbit than in the\r\nopposite, and to move quickest when it seems biggest, the observer would\r\nbe at no loss to determine that all the Planets move in Orbits of which\r\nthe Sun is not precisely in the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planetary motions very irregular as seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\n           PLATE III.]\r\n\r\n137. The apparent magnitudes of the Planets continually change as seen\r\nfrom the Earth, which demonstrates that they approach nearer to it, and\r\nrecede farther from it by turns. From these Phenomena, and their\r\napparent motions among the Stars, they seem to describe looped curves\r\nwhich never return into themselves, Venus’s path excepted. And if we\r\nwere to trace out all their apparent paths, and put the figures of them\r\ntogether in one diagram, they would appear so anomalous and confused,\r\nthat no man in his senses could believe them to be representations of\r\ntheir real paths; but would immediately conclude, that such apparent\r\nirregularities must be owing to some Optic illusions. And after a good\r\ndeal of enquiry, he might perhaps be at a loss to find out the true\r\ncause of these inequalities; especially if he were one of those who\r\nwould rather, with the greatest justice, charge frail man with\r\nignorance, than the Almighty with being the author of such confusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Those of Mercury and Venus represented.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n138. Dr. LONG, in his first volume of _Astronomy_, has given us figures\r\nof the apparent paths of all the Planets separately from CASSINI; and on\r\nseeing them I first thought of attempting to trace some of them by a\r\nmachine[29] that shews the motions of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, the Earth\r\nand Moon, according to the _Copernican System_. Having taken off the\r\nSun, Mercury, and Venus, I put black-lead pencils in their places, with\r\nthe points turned upward; and fixed a circular sheet of paste-board so,\r\nthat the Earth kept constantly under it’s center in going round the Sun;\r\nand the paste-board kept its parallelism. Then, pressing gently with one\r\nhand upon the paste-board to make it touch the three pencils, with the\r\nother hand I turned the winch which moves the whole machinery: and as\r\nthe Earth, together with the pencils in the places of Mercury and Venus,\r\nhad their proper motions round the Sun’s pencil, which kept at rest in\r\nthe center of the machine, all the three pencils described a diagram\r\nfrom which the first Figure of the third Plate is truly copied in a\r\nsmaller size. As the Earth moved round the Sun, the Sun’s pencil\r\ndescribed the dotted Circle of Months, whilst Mercury’s pencil drew the\r\ncurve with the greatest number of loops, and Venus’s that with the\r\nfewest. In their inferiour conjunctions they come as much nearer the\r\nEarth, or within the Circle of the Sun’s apparent motion round the\r\nHeavens, as they go beyond it in their superiour conjunctions. On each\r\nside of the loops they appear Stationary; in that part of each loop next\r\nthe Earth retrograde; and in all rest of their paths direct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III. _J. Ferguson delin._      _J. Mynde Sc._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE III.]\r\n\r\nIf _Cassini_’s Figures of the paths of the Sun, Mercury and Venus were\r\nput together, the Figure as above traced out, would be exactly like\r\nthem. It represents the Sun’s apparent motion round the Ecliptic, which\r\nis the same every year; Mercury’s motion for seven years; and Venus’s\r\nfor eight; in which time Mercury’s path makes 23 loops, crossing itself\r\nso many times, and Venus’s only five. In eight years Venus falls so\r\nnearly into the same apparent path again, as to deviate very little from\r\nit in some ages; but in what number of years Mercury and the rest of the\r\nPlanets would describe the same visible paths over again, I cannot at\r\npresent determine. Having finished the above Figure of the paths of\r\nMercury and Venus, I put the Ecliptic round them as in the Doctor’s\r\nBook; and added the dotted lines from the Earth to the Ecliptic for\r\nshewing Mercury’s apparent or geocentric motion therein for one year; in\r\nwhich time his path makes three loops, and goes on a little farther;\r\nwhich shews that he has three inferiour, and as many superiour\r\nconjunctions with the Sun in that time, and also that he is six times\r\nStationary, and thrice Retrograde. Let us now trace out his motion for\r\none year in the Figure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.]\r\n\r\nSuppose Mercury to be setting out from _A_ towards _B_ (between the\r\nEarth and left-hand corner of the Plate) and as seen from the Earth his\r\nmotion will then be direct, or according to the order of the Signs. But\r\nwhen he comes to _B_, he appears to stand still in the 23d degree of ♏\r\nat _F_, as shewn by the line _BF_. Whilst he goes from _B_ to _C_, the\r\nline _BF_ goes backward from _F_ to _E_, or contrary to the order of\r\nSigns; and when he is at _C_ he appears Stationary at _E_; having gone\r\nback 11-1/2 degrees. Now, suppose him Stationary on the first of\r\n_January_ at _C_, on the tenth thereof he will appear in the Heavens as\r\nat 20, near _F_; on the 20th he will be seen as at _G_; on the 31st at\r\n_H_; on the 10th of _February_ at _I_; on the 20th at _K_; and on the\r\n28th at _L_; as the dotted lines shew, which are drawn through every\r\ntenth day’s motion in his looped path, and continued to the Ecliptic. On\r\nthe 10th of _March_ he appears at _M_; on the 20th at _N_; and on the\r\n31st at _O_. On the 10th of _April_ he appears Stationary at _P_; on the\r\n20th he seems to have gone back again to _O_; and on the 30th he appears\r\nStationary at _Q_ having gone back 11-1/2 degrees. Thus Mercury seems to\r\ngo forward 4 Signs 11 Degrees, or 131 Degrees; and to go back only 11 or\r\n12 Degrees, at a mean rate. From the 30th of _April_ to the 10th of\r\n_May_, he seems to move from _Q_ to _R_; and on the 20th he is seen at\r\n_S_, going forward in the same manner again, according to the order of\r\nletters; and backward when they go back; which, ’tis needless to explain\r\nany farther, as the reader can trace him out so easily through the rest\r\nof the year. The same appearances happen in Venus’s motion; but as she\r\nmoves slower than Mercury, there are longer intervals of time between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHaving already § 120. given some account of the apparent diurnal motions\r\nof the Heavens as seen from the different Planets, we shall not trouble\r\nthe reader any more with that subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n _The_ Ptolemean _System refuted. The Motions and Phases of Mercury and\r\n                           Venus explained._\r\n\r\n\r\n139. The _Tychonic System_ § 97, being sufficiently refuted by the 109th\r\nArticle, we shall say nothing more about it.\r\n\r\n140. The _Ptolemean System_ § 96, which asserts the Earth to be at rest\r\nin the Center of the Universe, and all the Planets with the Sun and\r\nStars to move round it, is evidently false and absurd. For if this\r\nhypothesis were true, Mercury and Venus could never be hid behind the\r\nSun, as their Orbits are included within the Sun’s: and again, these two\r\nPlanets would always move direct, and be as often in Opposition to the\r\nSun as in Conjunction with him. But the contrary of all this is true:\r\nfor they are just as often behind the Sun as before him, appear as often\r\nto move backwards as forwards, and are so far from being seen at any\r\ntime in the side of the Heavens opposite to the Sun, that they were\r\nnever seen a quarter of a circle in the Heavens distant from him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appearances of Mercury and Venus.]\r\n\r\n141. These two Planets, when viewed with a good telescope, appear in all\r\nthe various shapes of the Moon; which is a plain proof that they are\r\nenlightened by the Sun, and shine not by any light of their own: for if\r\nthey did, they would constantly appear round as the Sun does; and could\r\nnever be seen like dark spots upon the Sun when they pass directly\r\nbetween him and us. Their regular Phases demonstrate them to be\r\nSpherical bodies; as may be shewn by the following experiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Experiment to prove they are round.]\r\n\r\nHang an ivory ball by a thread, and let any Person move it round the\r\nflame of a candle, at two or three yards distance from your Eye: when\r\nthe ball is beyond the candle, so as to be almost hid by the flame, it’s\r\nenlightened side will be towards you, and appear round like the Full\r\nMoon: When the ball is between you and the candle, it’s enlightened side\r\nwill disappear, as the Moon does at the Change: When it is half way\r\nbetween these two positions, it will appear half illuminated, like the\r\nMoon in her Quarters: But in every other place between these positions,\r\nit will appear more or less horned or gibbous. If this experiment be\r\nmade with a circular plate which has a flat surface, you may make it\r\nappear fully enlightened, or not enlightened at all; but can never make\r\nit seem either horned or gibbous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n           Experiment to represent the motions of Mercury and Venus.]\r\n\r\n142. If you remove about six or seven yards from the candle, and place\r\nyourself so that it’s flame may be just about the height of your eye,\r\nand then desire the other person to move the ball slowly round the\r\ncandle as before, keeping it as near of an equal height with the flame\r\nas he possibly can, the ball will appear to you not to move in a circle,\r\nbut rather to vibrate backward and forward like a pendulum; moving\r\nquickest when it is directly between you and the candle, and when\r\ndirectly beyond it; and gradually slower as it goes farther to the right\r\nor left side of the flame, until it appears at the greatest distance\r\nfrom the flame; and then, though it continues to move with the same\r\nvelocity, it will seem to stand still for a moment. In every Revolution\r\nit will shew all the above Phases § 141; and if two balls, a smaller and\r\na greater, be moved in this manner round the candle, the smaller ball\r\nbeing kept nearest the flame, and carried round almost three times as\r\noften as the greater, you will have a tolerably good representation of\r\nthe apparent Motions of Mercury and Venus; especially, if the bigger\r\nball describes a circle almost twice as large in diameter as the circle\r\ndescribed by the lesser.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           The elongations or digressions of Mercury from the Sun.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n143. Let _ABCDE_ be a part or segment of the visible Heavens, in which\r\nthe Sun, Moon, Planets, and Stars appear to move at the same distance\r\nfrom the Earth _E_. For there are certain limits, beyond which the eye\r\ncannot judge of different distances; as is plain from the Moon’s\r\nappearing to be no nearer to us than the Sun and Stars are. Let the\r\ncircle _fghiklmno_ be the Orbit in which Mercury _m_ moves round the Sun\r\n_S_, according to the order of the letters. When Mercury is at _f_, he\r\ndisappears to the Earth at _E_, because his enlightened side is turned\r\nfrom it; unless he be then in one of his Nodes § 20, 25; in which case,\r\nhe will appear like a dark spot upon the Sun. When he is at _g_ in his\r\nOrbit, he appears at _B_ in the Heavens, westward of the Sun _S_, which\r\nis seen at _C_: when at _h_, he appears at _A_, at his greatest western\r\nelongation or distance from the Sun; and then seems to stand still. But,\r\nas he moves from _h_ to _i_, he appears to go from _A_ to _B_; and seems\r\nto be in the same place when at _i_ as when he was at _g_, only not near\r\nso big: at _k_ he is hid from the Earth _E_ by the Sun _S_; being then\r\nin his superiour Conjunction. In going from _k_ to _l_, he appears to\r\nmove from _C_ to _D_; and when he is at _n_, he appears stationary at\r\n_E_; being seen as far east from the Sun then, as he was west from him\r\nat _A_. In going from _n_ to _o_ in his Orbit, he seems to go back again\r\nin the Heavens, from _E_ to _D_; and is seen in the same place (with\r\nrespect to the Sun) at _o_ as when he was at _l_; but of a larger\r\ndiameter at _o_, because he is then nearer the Earth _E_: and when he\r\ncomes to _f_, he again passes by the Sun, and disappears as before. In\r\ngoing from _n_ to _h_ in his Orbit, he seems to go backward in the\r\nHeavens from _E_ to _A_; and in going from _h_ to _n_, he seems to go\r\nforward from _A_ to _E_. As he goes on from _f_ a little of his\r\nenlightened side at _g_ is seen from _E_; at _h_ he appears half full,\r\nbecause half of his enlightened side is seen; at _i_, gibbous, or more\r\nthan half full; and at _k_ he would appear quite full, were he not hid\r\nfrom the Earth _E_ by the Sun _S_. At _l_ he appears gibbous again; at\r\n_n_ half decreased, at _o_ horned, and at _f_ new like the Moon at her\r\nChange. He goes sooner from his eastern station at _n_ to his western\r\nstation at _h_ than from _h_ to _n_ again; because he goes through less\r\nthan half his Orbit in the former case, and more in the latter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           The Elongations and Phases of Venus.\r\n\r\n           The greatest Elongations of Mercury and Venus.]\r\n\r\n144. In the same Figure, let _FGHIKLMN_ be the Orbit in which Venus _v_\r\nmoves round the Sun _S_, according to the order of the letters: and let\r\n_E_ be the Earth as before. When Venus is at _F_ she is in her inferiour\r\nConjunction; and disappears like the New Moon because her dark side is\r\ntoward the Earth. At _G_ she appears half enlightened to the Earth, like\r\nthe Moon in her first quarter: at _h_ she appears gibbous; at _I_,\r\nalmost full; her enlightened side being then nearly towards the Earth:\r\nat _K_, she would appear quite full to the Earth _E_; but is hid from it\r\nby the Sun _S_: at _L_, she appears upon the decrease, or gibbous; at\r\n_M_, more so; at _N_, only half enlightened; and at _F_ she disappears\r\nagain. In moving from _N_ to _G_, she seems to go backward in the\r\nHeavens; and from _G_ to _N_, forward: but, as she describes a much\r\ngreater portion of her Orbit in going from _G_ to _N_ than from _N_ to\r\n_G_, she appears much longer direct than retrograde in her motion. At\r\n_N_ and _G_ she appears stationary; as Mercury does at _n_ and _h_.\r\nMercury, when stationary seems to be only 28 degrees from the Sun; and\r\nVenus when so, 47; which is a demonstration that Mercury’s Orbit is\r\nincluded within Venus’s, and Venus’s within the Earth’s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morning and Evening Star, what.]\r\n\r\n145. Venus, from her superiour Conjunction at _K_ to her inferiour\r\nConjunction at _F_ is seen on the east side of the Sun _S_ from the\r\nEarth. _E_; and therefore she shines in the Evening after the Sun sets,\r\nand is called _the Evening Star_: for, the Sun being then to the\r\nwestward of Venus, he must set first. From her inferiour Conjunction to\r\nher superiour, she appears on the west side of the Sun; and therefore\r\nrises before him, for which reason she is called _the Morning Star_.\r\nWhen she is about _N_ or _G_, she shines so bright, that bodies cast\r\nshadows in the night-time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n           The stationary places of the Planets variable.]\r\n\r\n146. If the Earth kept always at _E_, it is evident that the Stationary\r\nplaces of Mercury and Venus would always be in the same points of the\r\nHeavens where they were before. For example; whilst Mercury _m_ goes\r\nfrom _h_ to _n_, according to the order of the letters, he appears to\r\ndescribe the arc _ABCDE_ in the Heavens, direct: and whilst he goes from\r\n_n_ to _h_, he seems to describe the same arc back again, from _E_ to\r\n_A_, retrograde: always at _n_ and _h_ he appears stationary at the same\r\npoints _E_ and _A_ as before. But Mercury goes round his Orbit, from _f_\r\nto _f_ again, in 88 days; and yet there are 116 days from any one of his\r\nConjunctions, or apparent Stations, to the same again: and the places of\r\nthese Conjunctions and Stations are found to be about 114 degrees\r\neastward from the points of the Heavens where they were last before;\r\nwhich proves, that the Earth has not kept all that time at _E_, but has\r\nhad a progressive motion in it’s Orbit from _E_ to _t_. Venus also\r\ndiffers every time in the places of her Conjunctions and Stations; but\r\nmuch more than Mercury; because, as Venus describes a much larger Orbit\r\nthan Mercury does, the Earth advances so much the farther in it’s annual\r\npath before Venus comes round again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Elongations of all Saturn’s inferiour Planets as seen\r\n           from him.]\r\n\r\n147. As Mercury and Venus, seen from the Earth, have their respective\r\nElongations from the Sun, and Stationary places; so has the Earth, seen\r\nfrom Mars; and Mars, seen from Jupiter; and Jupiter, seen from Saturn.\r\nThat is, to every superiour Planet, all the inferiour ones have their\r\nStations and Elongations; as Venus and Mercury have to the Earth. As\r\nseen from Saturn, Mercury never goes above 2-1/2 degrees from the Sun;\r\nVenus 4-1/3; the Earth 6; Mars 9-1/2; and Jupiter 33-1/4: so that\r\nMercury, as seen from the Earth, has almost as great a Digression or\r\nElongation from the Sun, as Jupiter seen from Saturn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof of the Earth’s annual motion.]\r\n\r\n148. Because the Earth’s Orbit is included within the Orbits of Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn, they are seen on all sides of the Heavens; and are\r\nas often in Opposition to the Sun as in Conjunction with him. If the\r\nEarth stood still, they would always appear direct in their motions,\r\nnever retrograde nor stationary. But they seem to go just as often\r\nbackward as forward; which, if gravity be allowed to exist, affords a\r\nsufficient proof of the Earth’s annual motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.\r\n\r\n           General Phenomena of a superiour Planet to an inferiour.]\r\n\r\n149. As Venus and the Earth are superiour Planets to Mercury, they shew\r\nmuch the same Appearances to him that Mars and Jupiter do to us. Let\r\nMercury _m_ be at _f_, Venus _v_ at _F_, and the Earth at _E_; in which\r\nsituation Venus hides the Earth from Mercury; but, being in opposition\r\nto the Sun, she shines on Mercury with a full illumined Orb; though,\r\nwith respect to the Earth, she is in conjunction with the Sun and\r\ninvisible. When Mercury is at _f_, and Venus at _G_, her enlightened\r\nside not being directly towards him, she appears a little gibbous; as\r\nMars does in a like situation to us: but, when Venus is at _I_, her\r\nenlightened side is so much towards Mercury at _f_, that she appears to\r\nhim almost of a round figure. At _K_, Venus disappears to Mercury at\r\n_f_, being then hid by the Sun; as all our superiour Planets are to us,\r\nwhen in conjunction with the Sun. When Venus has, as it were, emerged\r\nout of the Sun beams, as at _L_, she appears almost full to Mercury at\r\n_f_; at _M_ and _N_, a little gibbous; quite full at _F_, and largest of\r\nall; being then in opposition to the Sun, and consequently nearest to\r\nMercury at _f_; shining strongly on him in the night, because her\r\ndistance from him then is somewhat less than a fifth part of her\r\ndistance from the Earth, when she appears roundest to it between _I_ and\r\n_K_, or between _K_ and _L_, as seen from the Earth _E_. Consequently,\r\nwhen Venus is opposite to the Sun as seen from Mercury, she appears more\r\nthan 25 times as large to him as she does to us when at the fullest. Our\r\ncase is almost similar with respect to Mars, when he is opposite to the\r\nSun; because he is then so near the Earth, and has his whole enlightened\r\nside towards it. But, because the Orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are very\r\nlarge in proportion to the Earth’s, these two Planets appear much less\r\nmagnified at their Oppositions or diminished at their Conjunctions than\r\nMars does, in proportion to their mean apparent Diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

From the uniform projectile motion of bodies in straight lines, and\r\nthe universal power of attraction, arises the curvilineal motions of all\r\nthe Heavenly bodies. If the body _A_ be projected along the right line\r\n_ABX_, in open Space, where it meets with no resistance, and is not\r\ndrawn aside by any other power, it will for ever go on with the same\r\nvelocity, and in the same direction. For, the force which moves it from\r\n_A_ to _B_ in any given time, will carry it from _B_ to _X_ in as much\r\nmore time; and so on, there being nothing to obstruct or alter it’s\r\nmotion. But if, when this projectile force has carried it, suppose to\r\n_B_, the body _S_ begins to attract it, with a power duly adjusted, and\r\nperpendicular to it’s motion at _B_, it will then be drawn from the\r\nstraight line _ABX_, and forced to revolve about _S_ in the Circle\r\n_BYTU_. When the body _A_ comes to _U_, or any other part of it’s Orbit,\r\nif the small body _u_, within the sphere of _U_’s attraction, be\r\nprojected as in the right line _Z_, with a force perpendicular to the\r\nattraction of _U_, then _u_ will go round _U_ in the Orbit _W_, and\r\naccompany it in it’s whole course round the body _S_. Here, _S_ may\r\nrepresent the Sun, _U_ the Earth, and _u_ the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n151. If a Planet at _B_ gravitates, or is attracted, toward the Sun, so\r\nas to fall from _B_ to _y_ in the time that the projectile force would\r\nhave carried it from _B_ to _X_, it will describe the curve _BY_ by the\r\ncombined action of these two forces, in the same time that the\r\nprojectile force singly would have carried it from _B_ to _X_, or the\r\ngravitating power singly have caused it to descend from _B_ to _y_; and\r\nthese two forces being duly proportioned, and perpendicular to one\r\nanother, the Planet obeying them both, will move in the circle\r\n_BYTU_[30].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elliptical Orbits.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n152. But if, whilst the projectile force carries the Planet from _B_ to\r\n_b_, the Sun’s attraction (which constitutes the Planet’s gravitation)\r\nshould bring it down from _B_ to I, the gravitating power would then be\r\ntoo strong for the projectile force; and would cause the Planet to\r\ndescribe the curve _BC_. When the Planet comes to _C_, the gravitating\r\npower (which always increases as the square of the distance from the Sun\r\n_S_ diminishes) will be yet stronger for the projectile force; and by\r\nconspiring in some degree therewith, will accelerate the Planet’s motion\r\nall the way from _C_ to _K_; causing it to describe the arcs _BC_, _CD_,\r\n_DE_, _EF_, &c. all in equal times. Having it’s motion thus accelerated,\r\nit gains so much centrifugal force, or tendency to fly off at _K_ in the\r\nline _Kk_, as overcomes the Sun’s attraction: and the centrifugal force\r\nbeing too great to allow the Planet to be brought nearer the Sun, or\r\neven to move round him in the Circle _Klmn_, &c. it goes off, and\r\nascends in the curve _KLMN_, &c. it’s motion decreasing as gradually\r\nfrom _K_ to _B_ as it increased from _B_ to _K_, because the Sun’s\r\nattraction acts now against the Planet’s projectile motion just as much\r\nas it acted with it before. When the Planet has got round to _B_, it’s\r\nprojectile force is as much diminished from it’s mean state about _G_ or\r\n_N_, as it was augmented at _K_; and so, the Sun’s attraction being more\r\nthan sufficient to keep the Planet from going off at _B_, it describes\r\nthe same Orbit over again, by virtue of the same forces or laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV.\r\n\r\n           The Planets describe equal Areas in equal times.]\r\n\r\n153. A double projectile force will always balance a quadruple power of\r\ngravity. Let the Planet at _B_ have twice as great an impulse from\r\nthence towards _X_, as it had before: that is, in the same length of\r\ntime that it was projected from _B_ to _b_, as in the last example, let\r\nit now be projected from _B_ to _c_; and it will require four times as\r\nmuch gravity to retain it in it’s Orbit: that is, it must fall as far as\r\nfrom _B_ to 4 in the time that the projectile force would carry it from\r\n_B_ to _c_; otherwise it could not describe the curve _BD_, as is\r\nevident by the Figure. But, in as much time as the Planet moves from _B_\r\nto _C_ in the higher part of it’s Orbit, it moves from _I_ to _K_ or\r\nfrom _K_ to _L_ in the lower part thereof; because, from the joint\r\naction of these two forces, it must always describe equal areas in equal\r\ntimes, throughout it’s annual course.

As the Planets approach nearer the Sun, and recede farther from\r\nhim, in every Revolution; there may be some difficulty in conceiving the\r\nreason why the power of gravity, when it once gets the better of the\r\nprojectile force, does not bring the Planets nearer and nearer the Sun\r\nin every Revolution, till they fall upon and unite with him. Or why the\r\nprojectile force, when it once gets the better of gravity, does not\r\ncarry the Planets farther and farther from the Sun, till it removes them\r\nquite out of the sphere of his attraction, and causes them to go on in\r\nstraight lines for ever afterward. But by considering the effects of\r\nthese powers as described in the two last Articles, this difficulty will\r\nbe removed. Suppose a Planet at _B_ to be carried by the projectile\r\nforce as far as from _B_ to _b_, in the time that gravity would have\r\nbrought it down from _B_ to 1: by these two forces it will describe the\r\ncurve _BC_. When the Planet comes down to _K_, it will be but half as\r\nfar from the Sun _S_ as it was at _B_; and therefore, by gravitating\r\nfour times as strongly towards him, it would fall from _K_ to _V_ in the\r\nsame length of time that it would have fallen from _B_ to 1 in the\r\nhigher part of it’s Orbit, that is, through four times as much space;\r\nbut it’s projectile force is then so much increased at _K_, as would\r\ncarry it from _K_ to _k_ in the same time; being double of what it was\r\nat _B_, and is therefore too strong for the tendency of the gravitating\r\npower, either to draw the Planet to the Sun, or cause it to go round him\r\nin the circle _Klmn_, &c. which would require it’s falling from _K_ to\r\n_w_, through a greater space than gravity can draw it whilst the\r\nprojectile force is such as would carry it from _K_ to _k_: and\r\ntherefore the Planet ascends in it’s Orbit _KLMN_, decreasing in it’s\r\nvelocity for the cause already assigned in § 152.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planetary Orbits elliptical.\r\n\r\n           Their Excentricities.]\r\n\r\n155. The Orbits of all the Planets are Ellipses, very little different\r\nfrom Circles: but the Orbits of the Comets are very long Ellipses; the\r\nlower focus of them all being in the Sun. If we suppose the mean\r\ndistance (or middle between the greatest and least) of every Planet and\r\nComet from the Sun to be divided into 1000 equal parts, the\r\nExcentricities of their Orbits, both in such parts and in _English_\r\nmiles, will be as follows. Mercury’s, 210 parts, or 6,720,000 miles;\r\nVenus’s, 7 parts, or 413,000 miles; the Earth’s, 17 parts, or 1,377,000\r\nmiles; Mars’s, 93 parts, or 11,439,000 miles; Jupiter’s, 48 parts, or\r\n20,352,000 miles; Saturn’s, 55 parts, or 42,735,000 miles. Of the\r\nnearest of the three forementioned Comets, 1,458,000 miles; of the\r\nmiddlemost, 2,025,000,000 miles; and of the outermost, 6,600,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The above laws sufficient for motions both in circular and\r\n           elliptic Orbits.]\r\n\r\n156. By the above-mentioned laws § 150 _& seq._ bodies will move in all\r\nkinds of Ellipses, whether long or short, if the spaces they move in be\r\nvoid of resistance. Only, those which move in the longer Ellipses, have\r\nso much the less projectile force impressed upon them in the higher\r\nparts of their Orbits; and their velocities, in coming down towards the\r\nSun, are so prodigiously increased by his attraction, that their\r\ncentrifugal forces in the lower parts of their Orbits are so great as to\r\novercome the Sun’s attraction there, and cause them to ascend again\r\ntowards the higher parts of their Orbits; during which time, the Sun’s\r\nattraction acting so contrary to the motions of those bodies, causes\r\nthem to move slower and slower, until their projectile forces are\r\ndiminished almost to nothing; and then they are brought back again by\r\nthe Sun’s attraction, as before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In what times the Planets would fall to the Sun by the power\r\n           of gravity.]\r\n\r\n157. If the projectile forces of all the Planets and Comets were\r\ndestroyed at their mean distances from the Sun, their gravities would\r\nbring them down so, as that Mercury would fall to the Sun in 15 days 13\r\nhours; Venus in 39 days 17 hours; the Earth or Moon in 64 days 10 hours;\r\nMars in 121 days; Jupiter in 290; and Saturn in 767. The nearest Comet\r\nin 13 thousand days; the middlemost in 23 thousand days; and the\r\noutermost in 66 thousand days. The Moon would fall to the Earth in 4\r\ndays 20 hours; Jupiter’s first Moon would fall to him in 7 hours, his\r\nsecond in 15, his third in 30, and his fourth in 71 hours. Saturn’s\r\nfirst Moon would fall to him in 8 hours; his second in 12, his third in\r\n19, his fourth in 68 hours, and the fifth in 336. A stone would fall to\r\nthe Earth’s center, if there were an hollow passage, in 21 minutes 9\r\nseconds. Mr. WHISTON gives the following Rule for such Computations.\r\n“[31]It is demonstrable, that half the Period of any Planet, when it is\r\ndiminished in the sesquialteral proportion of the number 1 to the number\r\n2, or nearly in the proportion of 1000 to 2828, is the time that it\r\nwould fall to the Center of it’s Orbit.” This proportion is, when a\r\nquantity or number contains another once and a half as much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The prodigious attraction of the Sun and Planets.]\r\n\r\n158. The quick motions of the Moons of Jupiter and Saturn round their\r\nPrimaries, demonstrate that these two Planets have stronger attractive\r\npowers than the Earth has. For, the stronger that one body attracts\r\nanother, the greater must be the projectile force, and consequently the\r\nquicker must be the motion of that other body, to keep it from falling\r\nto it’s primary or central Planet. Jupiter’s second Moon is 124 thousand\r\nmiles farther from Jupiter than our Moon is from us; and yet this second\r\nMoon goes almost eight times round Jupiter whilst our Moon goes only\r\nonce round the Earth. What a prodigious attractive power must the Sun\r\nthen have, to draw all the Planets and Satellites of the System towards\r\nhim; and what an amazing power must it have required to put all these\r\nPlanets and Moons into such rapid motions at first! Amazing indeed to\r\nus, because impossible to be effected by the strength of all the living\r\nCreatures in an unlimited number of Worlds, but no ways hard for the\r\nAlmighty, whose Planetarium takes in the whole Universe!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARCHIMEDES’s Problem for raising the Earth.]\r\n\r\n159. The celebrated ARCHIMEDES affirmed he could move the Earth if he\r\nhad a place to stand on to manage his machinery[32]. This assertion is\r\ntrue in Theory, but, upon examination, will be found absolutely\r\nimpossible in fact, even though a proper place and materials of\r\nsufficient strength could be had.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and easiest method of moving a heavy body a little way is\r\nby a lever or crow, where a small weight or power applied to the long\r\narm will raise a great weight on the short one. But then, the small\r\nweight must move as much quicker than the great weight as the latter is\r\nheavier than the former; and the length of the long arm of the lever to\r\nthe length of the short arm must be in the same proportion. Now, suppose\r\na man pulls or presses the end of the long arm with the force of 200\r\npound weight, and that the Earth contains in round Numbers\r\n4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 4000 Trillions of cubic feet, each at a\r\nmean rate weighing 100 pound; and that the prop or center of motion of\r\nthe lever is 6000 miles from the Earth’s center: in this case, the\r\nlength of the lever from the _Fulcrum_ or center of motion to the moving\r\npower or weight ought to be 12,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 12\r\nQuadrillions of miles; and so many miles must the power move, in order\r\nto raise the Earth but one mile, whence ’tis easy to compute, that if\r\nARCHIMEDES or the power applied could move as swift as a cannon bullet,\r\nit would take 27,000,000,000,000 or 27 Billions of years to raise the\r\nEarth one inch.\r\n\r\nIf any other machine, such as a combination of wheels and screws, was\r\nproposed to move the Earth, the time it would require, and the space\r\ngone through by the hand that turned the machine, would be the same as\r\nbefore. Hence we may learn, that however boundless our Imagination and\r\nTheory may be, the actual operations of man are confined within narrow\r\nbounds; and more suited to our real wants than to our desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hard to determine what Gravity is.]\r\n\r\n160. The Sun and Planets mutually attract each other: the power by which\r\nthey do so we call _Gravity_. But whether this power be mechanical or\r\nno, is very much disputed. We are certain that the Planets disturb one\r\nanother’s motions by it, and that it decreases according to the squares\r\nof the distances of the Sun and Planets; as light, which is known to be\r\nmaterial, likewise does. Hence Gravity should seem to arise from the\r\nagency of some subtile matter pressing towards the Sun and Planets, and\r\nacting, like all mechanical causes, by contact. But on the other hand,\r\nwhen we consider that the degree or force of Gravity is exactly in\r\nproportion to the quantities of matter in those bodies, without any\r\nregard to their bulks or quantity of surface, acting as freely on their\r\ninternal as external parts, it seems to surpass the power of mechanism;\r\nand to be either the immediate agency of the Deity, or effected by a law\r\noriginally established and imprest on all matter by him. But some affirm\r\nthat matter, being altogether inert, cannot be impressed with any Law,\r\neven by almighty Power: and that the Deity must therefore be constantly\r\nimpelling the Planets toward the Sun, and moving them with the same\r\nirregularities and disturbances which Gravity would cause, if it could\r\nbe supposed to exist. But, if a man may venture to publish his own\r\nthoughts, (and why should not one as well as another?) it seems to me no\r\ngreater absurdity, to suppose the Deity capable of superadding a Law, or\r\nwhat Laws he pleases, to matter, than to suppose him capable of giving\r\nit existence at first. The manner of both is equally inconceivable to\r\nus; but neither of them imply a contradiction in our ideas: and what\r\nimplies no contradiction is within the power of Omnipotence. Do we not\r\nsee that a human creature can prepare a bar of steel so as to make it\r\nattract needles and filings of iron; and that he can put a stop to that\r\npower or virtue, and again call it forth again as often as he pleases?\r\nTo say that the workman infuses any new power into the bar, is saying\r\ntoo much; since the needle and filings, to which he has done nothing,\r\nre-attract the bar. And from this it appears that the power was\r\noriginally imprest on the matter of which the bar, needle, and filings\r\nare composed; but does not seem to act until the bar be properly\r\nprepared by the artificer: somewhat like a rope coiled up in a ship,\r\nwhich will never draw a boat or any other thing towards the ship, unless\r\none end be tied to it, and the other end to that which is to be hauled\r\nup; and then it is no matter which end of the rope the sailors pull at,\r\nfor the rope will be equally stretched throughout, and the ship and boat\r\nwill move towards one another. To say that the Almighty has infused no\r\nsuch virtue or power into the materials which compose the bar, but that\r\nhe waits till the operator be pleased to prepare it by due position and\r\nfriction, and then, when the needle or filings are brought pretty near\r\nthe bar, the Deity presses them towards it, and withdraws his hand\r\nwhenever the workman either for use, curiosity or whim, does what\r\nappears to him to destroy the action of the bar, seems quite ridiculous\r\nand trifling; as it supposes God not only to be subservient to our\r\ninconstant wills, but also to do what would be below the dignity of any\r\nrational man to be employed about.\r\n\r\n161. That the projectile force was at first given by the Deity is\r\nevident. For, since matter can never put itself into motion, and all\r\nbodies may be moved in any direction whatsoever; and yet all the Planets\r\nboth primary and secondary move from west to east, in planes nearly\r\ncoincident; whilst the Comets move in all directions, and in planes so\r\ndifferent from one another; these motions can be owing to no mechanical\r\ncause of necessity, but to the free choice and power of an intelligent\r\nBeing.\r\n\r\n162. Whatever Gravity be, ’tis plain that it acts every moment of time:\r\nfor should it’s action cease, the projectile force would instantly carry\r\noff the Planets in straight lines from those parts of their Orbits where\r\nGravity left them. But, the Planets being once put into motion, there is\r\nno occasion for any new projectile force, unless they meet with some\r\nresistance in their Orbits; nor for any mending hand, unless they\r\ndisturb one another too much by their mutual attractions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planets disturb one another’s motion.\r\n\r\n           The consequences thereof.]\r\n\r\n163. It is found that there are disturbances among the Planets in their\r\nmotions, arising from their mutual attractions when they are in the same\r\nquarter of the Heavens; and that our years are not always precisely of\r\nthe same length[33]. Besides, there is reason to believe that the Moon\r\nis somewhat nearer the Earth now than she was formerly; her periodical\r\nmonth being shorter than it was in former ages. For, our Astronomical\r\nTables, which in the present Age shew the times of Solar and Lunar\r\nEclipses to great precision, do not answer so well for very ancient\r\nEclipses. Hence it appears, that the Moon does not move in a medium void\r\nof all resistance, § 174; and therefore her projectile force being a\r\nlittle weakened, whilst there is nothing to diminish her gravity, she\r\nmust be gradually approaching nearer the Earth, describing smaller and\r\nsmaller Circles round it in every revolution, and finishing her Period\r\nsooner, although her absolute motion with regard to space be not so\r\nquick now as it was formerly: and therefore, she must come to the Earth\r\nat last; unless that Being, which gave her a sufficient projectile force\r\nat the beginning, adds a little more to it in due time. And, as all the\r\nPlanets move in spaces full of æther and light, which are material\r\nsubstances, they too must meet with some resistance. And therefore, if\r\ntheir gravities are not diminished, nor their projectile forces\r\nincreased, they must necessarily approach nearer and nearer the Sun, and\r\nat length fall upon and unite with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The World not eternal.]\r\n\r\n164. Here we have a strong philosophical argument against the eternity\r\nof the World. For, had it existed from eternity, and been left by the\r\nDeity to be governed by the combined actions of the above forces or\r\npowers, generally called Laws, it had been at an end long ago. And if it\r\nbe left to them it must come to an end. But we may be certain that it\r\nwill last as long as was intended by it’s Author, who ought no more to\r\nbe found fault with for framing so perishable a work, than for making\r\nman mortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP.

The Horizontal Moon._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The amazing smallness of the particles of light.]\r\n\r\n165. Light consists of exceeding small particles of matter\r\nissuing from a luminous body; as from a lighted candle such\r\nparticles of matter continually flow in all directions. Dr.\r\nNIEWENTYT[34] computes, that in one second of time there flows\r\n418,660,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles of\r\nlight out of a burning candle; which number contains at least\r\n6,337,242,000,000 times the number of grains of sand in the whole Earth;\r\nsupposing 100 grains of sand to be equal in length to an inch, and\r\nconsequently, every cubic inch of the Earth to contain one million of\r\nsuch grains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dreadful effects that would ensue from their being\r\n           larger.]\r\n\r\n166. These amazingly small particles, by striking upon our eyes, excite\r\nin our minds the idea of light: and, if they were so large as the\r\nsmallest particles of matter discernible by our best microscopes,\r\ninstead of being serviceable to us, they would soon deprive us of sight\r\nby the force arising from their immense velocity, which is above 164\r\nthousand miles every second[35], or 1,230,000 times swifter than the\r\nmotion of a cannon bullet. And therefore, if the particles of light were\r\nso large, that a million of them were equal in bulk to an ordinary grain\r\nof land, we durst no more open our eyes to the light than suffer sand to\r\nbe shot point blank against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How objects become visible to us.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n167. When these small particles, flowing from the Sun or from a candle,\r\nfall upon bodies, and are thereby reflected to our eyes, they excite in\r\nus the idea of that body by forming it’s picture on the retina[36]. And\r\nsince bodies are visible on all sides, light must be reflected from them\r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rays of Light naturally move in straight lines.\r\n\r\n           A proof that they hinder not one another’s motions.]\r\n\r\n168. A ray of light is a continued stream of these particles, flowing\r\nfrom any visible body in straight lines. That they move in straight, and\r\nnot in crooked lines, unless they be refracted, is evident from bodies\r\nnot being visible if we endeavour to look at them through the bore of a\r\nbended pipe; and from their ceasing to be seen by the interposition of\r\nother bodies, as the fixed Stars by the interposition of the Moon and\r\nPlanets, and the Sun wholly or in part by the interposition of the Moon,\r\nMercury, or Venus. And that these rays do not interfere, or jostle one\r\nanother out of their ways, in flowing from different bodies all around,\r\nis plain from the following Experiment. Make a little hole in a thin\r\nplate of metal, and set the plate upright on a table, facing a row of\r\nlighted candles standing by one another; then place a sheet of paper or\r\npasteboard at a little distance from the other side of the plate, and\r\nthe rays of all the candles, flowing through the hole, will form as many\r\nspecks of light on the paper as there are candles before the plate, each\r\nspeck as distinct and large, as if there were only one candle to cast\r\none speck; which shews that the rays are no hinderance to each other in\r\ntheir motions, although they all cross in the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. XI.\r\n\r\n           In what proportion light and heat decrease at any given\r\n           distance from the Sun.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n169. Light, and therefore heat so far as it depends on the Sun’s rays (§\r\n85, towards the end) decreases in proportion to the squares of the\r\ndistances of the Planets from the Sun. This is easily demonstrated by a\r\nFigure which, together with it’s description, I have taken from Dr.\r\nSMITH’s Optics[37]. Let the light which flows from a point _A_, and\r\npasses through a square hole _B_, be received upon a plane _C_, parallel\r\nto the plane of the hole; or, if you please, let the figure _C_ be the\r\nshadow of the plane _B_; and when the distance _C_ is double of _B_, the\r\nlength and breadth of the shadow _C_ will be each double of the length\r\nand breadth of the plane _B_; and treble when _AD_ is treble of _AB_;\r\nand so on: which may be easily examined by the light of a candle placed\r\nat _A_. Therefore the surface of the shadow _C_, at the distance _AC_\r\ndouble of _AB_, is divisible into four squares, and at a treble\r\ndistance, into nine squares, severally equal to the square _B_, as\r\nrepresented in the Figure. The light then which falls upon the plane\r\n_B_, being suffered to pass to double that distance, will be uniformly\r\nspread over four times the space, and consequently will be four times\r\nthinner in every part of that space, and at a treble distance it will be\r\nnine times thinner, and at a quadruple distance sixteen times thinner,\r\nthan it was at first; and so on, according to the increase of the square\r\nsurfaces _B_, _C_, _D_, _E_, built upon the distances _AB_, _AC_, _AD_,\r\n_AE_. Consequently, the quantities of this rarefied light received upon\r\na surface of any given size and shape whatever, removed successively to\r\nthese several distances, will be but one quarter, one ninth, one\r\nsixteenth of the whole quantity received by it at the first distance\r\n_AB_. Or in general words, the densities and quantities of light,\r\nreceived upon any given plane, are diminished in the same proportion as\r\nthe squares of the distances of that plane, from the luminous body, are\r\nincreased: and on the contrary, are increased in the same proportion as\r\nthese squares are diminished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Planets appear dimmer when viewed thro’ telescopes\r\n           than by the bare eye.]\r\n\r\n170. The more a telescope magnifies the disks of the Moon and Planets,\r\nthey appear so much dimmer than to the bare eye; because the telescope\r\ncannot magnify the quantity of light, as it does the surface; and, by\r\nspreading the same quantity of light over a surface so much larger than\r\nthe naked eye beheld, just so much dimmer must it appear when viewed by\r\na telescope than by the bare eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. VIII.\r\n\r\n           Refraction of the rays of light.]\r\n\r\n171. When a ray of light passes out of one medium[38] into another, it\r\nis refracted, or turned out of it’s first course, more or less, as it\r\nfalls more or less obliquely on the refracting surface which divides the\r\ntwo mediums. This may be proved by several experiments; of which we\r\nshall only give three for example’s sake. 1. In a bason _FGH_ put a\r\npiece of money as _DB_, and then retire from it as to _A_, till the edge\r\nof the bason at _E_ just hides the money from your sight: then, keeping\r\nyour head steady, let another person fill the bason gently with water.\r\nAs he fills it, you will see more and more of the piece _DB_; which will\r\nbe all in view when the bason is full, and appear as if lifted up to\r\n_C_. For, the ray _AEB_, which was straight whilst the bason was empty,\r\nis now bent at the surface of the water in _E_, and turned out of it’s\r\nrectilineal course into the direction _ED_. Or, in other words, the ray\r\n_DEK_, that proceeded in a straight line from the edge _D_ whilst the\r\nbason was empty, and went above the eye at _A_, is now bent at _E_; and\r\ninstead of going on in the rectilineal direction _DEK_, goes in the\r\nangled direction _DEA_, and by entering the eye at _A_ renders the\r\nobject _DB_ visible. Or, 2dly, place the bason where the Sun shines\r\nobliquely, and observe where the shadow of the rim _E_ falls on the\r\nbottom, as at _B_: then fill it with water, and the shadow will fall at\r\n_D_; which proves, that the rays of light, falling obliquely on the\r\nsurface of the water, are refracted, or bent downwards into it.\r\n\r\n172. The less obliquely the rays of light fall upon the surface of any\r\nmedium, the less they are refracted; and if they fall perpendicularly\r\nthereon, they are not refracted at all. For, in the last experiment, the\r\nhigher the Sun rises, the less will be the difference between the places\r\nwhere the edge of the shadow falls, in the empty and full bason. And,\r\n3dly, if a stick be laid over the bason, and the Sun’s rays be reflected\r\nperpendicularly into it from a looking-glass, the shadow of the stick\r\nwill fall upon the same place of the bottom, whether the bason be full\r\nor empty.\r\n\r\n173. The denser that any medium is, the more is light refracted in\r\npassing through it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Atmosphere.\r\n\r\n           The Air’s compression and rarity at different heights.]\r\n\r\n174. The Earth is surrounded by a thin fluid mass of matter, called the\r\n_Air_, or _Atmosphere_, which gravitates to the Earth, revolves with it\r\nin it’s diurnal motion, and goes round the Sun with it every year. This\r\nfluid is of an elastic or springy nature, and it’s lowermost parts being\r\npressed by the weight of all the Air above them, are squeezed the closer\r\ntogether; and are therefore densest of all at the Earth’s surface, and\r\ngradually rarer the higher up. “It is well known[39] that the Air near\r\nthe surface of our Earth possesses a space about 1200 times greater than\r\nwater of the same weight. And therefore, a cylindric column of Air 1200\r\nfoot high is of equal weight with a cylinder of water of the same\r\nbreadth and but one foot high. But a cylinder of Air reaching to the top\r\nof the Atmosphere is of equal weight with a cylinder of water about 33\r\nfoot high[40]; and therefore if from the whole cylinder of Air, the\r\nlower part of 1200 foot high is taken away, the remaining upper part\r\nwill be of equal weight with a cylinder of water 32 foot high;\r\nwherefore, at the height of 1200 feet or two furlongs, the weight of the\r\nincumbent Air is less, and consequently the rarity of the compressed Air\r\nis greater than near the Earth’s surface in the ratio of 33 to 32. And\r\nhaving this ratio we may compute the rarity of the Air at all heights\r\nwhatsoever, supposing the expansion thereof to be reciprocally\r\nproportional to its compression; and this proportion has been proved by\r\nthe experiments of Dr. _Hooke_ and others. The result of the computation\r\nI have set down in the annexed Table, in the first column of which you\r\nhave the height of the Air in miles, whereof 4000 make a semi-diameter\r\nof the Earth; in the second the compression of the Air or the incumbent\r\nweight; in the third it’s rarity or expansion, supposing gravity to\r\ndecrease in the duplicate ratio of the distances from the Earth’s\r\ncenter.

The weight of the Air, at the Earth’s surface, is found by\r\nexperiments made with the air-pump; and also by the quantity of mercury\r\nthat the Atmosphere balances in the barometer; in which, at a mean\r\nstate; the mercury stands 29-1/2 inches high. And if the tube were a\r\nsquare inch wide, it would at that height contain 29-1/2 cubic inches of\r\nmercury, which is just 15 pound weight; and so much weight of air every\r\nsquare inch of the Earth’s surface sustains; and every square foot 144\r\ntimes as much, because it contains 144 square inches. Now as the Earth’s\r\nsurface contains about 199,409,400 square miles, it must be of no less\r\nthan 5,559,215,016,960,000 square feet; which, multiplied by 2016, the\r\nnumber of pounds on every foot, amounts to 11,207,377,474,191,360,000;\r\nor 11 trillion 207 thousand 377 billion 474 thousand 191 million and 360\r\nthousand pounds, for the weight of the whole Atmosphere. At this rate, a\r\nmiddle sized man, whose surface may be about 14 square feet, is pressed\r\nby 28,224 pound weight of Air all round; for fluids press equally up and\r\ndown and on all sides. But, because this enormous weight is equal on all\r\nsides, and counterbalanced by the spring of the internal Air in our\r\nblood vessels, it is not felt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A common mistake about the weight of the Air.]\r\n\r\n176. Oftentimes the state of the Air is such that we feel ourselves\r\nlanguid and dull; which is commonly thought to be occasioned by the\r\nAir’s being foggy and heavy about us. But that the Air is then too\r\nlight, is evident from the mercury’s sinking in the barometer, at which\r\ntime it is generally found that the Air has not sufficient strength to\r\nbear up the vapours which compose the Clouds: for, when it is otherwise,\r\nthe Clouds mount high, the Air is more elastic and weighty about us, by\r\nwhich means it balances the internal spring of the Air within us, braces\r\nup our blood-vessels and nerves, and makes us brisk and lively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Without an Atmosphere the Heavens would always appear dark,\r\n           and we should have no twilight.]\r\n\r\n177. According to [42]Dr. KEILL, and other astronomical writers, it is\r\nentirely owing to the Atmosphere that the Heavens appear bright in the\r\nday-time. For, without an Atmosphere, only that part of the Heavens\r\nwould shine in which the Sun was placed: and if an observer could live\r\nwithout Air, and should turn his back towards the Sun, the whole Heavens\r\nwould appear as dark as in the night, and the Stars would be seen as\r\nclear as in the nocturnal sky. In this case, we should have no twilight;\r\nbut a sudden transition from the brightest sunshine to the blackest\r\ndarkness immediately after sun-set; and from the blackest darkness to\r\nthe brightest sun-shine at sun-rising; which would be extremely\r\ninconvenient, if not blinding, to all mortals. But, by means of the\r\nAtmosphere, we enjoy the Sun’s light, reflected from the aerial\r\nparticles, before he rises and after he sets. For, when the Earth by its\r\nrotation has withdrawn the Sun from our sight, the Atmosphere being\r\nstill higher than we, has his light imparted to it; which gradually\r\ndecreases until he has got 18 degrees below the Horizon; and then, all\r\nthat part of the Atmosphere which is above us is dark. From the length\r\nof twilight, the Doctor has calculated the height of the Atmosphere (so\r\nfar as it is dense enough to reflect any light) to be about 44 miles.\r\nBut it is seldom dense enough at two miles height to bear up the Clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It brings the Sun in view before he rises, and keeps him in\r\n           view after he sets.]\r\n\r\n178. The Atmosphere refracts the Sun’s rays so, as to bring him in sight\r\nevery clear day, before he rises in the Horizon; and to keep him in view\r\nfor some minutes after he is really set below it. For, at some times of\r\nthe year, we see the Sun ten minutes longer above the Horizon than he\r\nwould be if there were no refractions: and about six minutes every day\r\nat a mean rate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IX.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\n179. To illustrate this, let _IEK_ be a part of the Earth’s surface,\r\ncovered with the Atmosphere _HGFC_; and let _HEO_ be the[43] sensible\r\nHorizon of an observer at _E_. When the Sun is at _A_, really below the\r\nHorizon, a ray of light _AC_ proceeding from him comes straight to _C_,\r\nwhere it falls on the surface of the Atmosphere, and there entering a\r\ndenser medium, it is turned out of its rectilineal course _ACdG_, and\r\nbent down to the observer’s eye at _E_; who then sees the Sun in the\r\ndirection of the refracted ray _edE_, which lies above the Horizon, and\r\nbeing extended out to the Heavens, shews the Sun at _B_ § 171.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IX.]\r\n\r\n180. The higher the Sun rises, the less his rays are refracted, because\r\nthey fall less obliquely on the surface of the Atmosphere § 172. Thus,\r\nwhen the Sun is in the direction of the line _EfL_ continued, he is so\r\nnearly perpendicular to the surface of the Earth at _E_, that his rays\r\nare but very little bent from a rectilineal course.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The quantity of refraction.]\r\n\r\n181. The Sun is about 32-1/4 min. of a deg. in breadth, when at his mean\r\ndistance from the Earth; and the horizontal refraction of his rays is\r\n33-3/4 min. which being more than his whole diameter, brings all his\r\nDisc in view, when his uppermost edge rises in the Horizon. At ten deg.\r\nheight the refraction is not quite 5 min. at 20 deg. only 2 min. 26\r\nsec.; at 30 deg. but 1 min. 32 sec.; between which and the Zenith, it is\r\nscarce sensible: the quantity throughout, is shewn by the annexed table,\r\ncalculated by Sir ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                                                 |\r\n |  182. _A_ TABLE _shewing the Refractions        |\r\n |           of the Sun, Moon, and Stars;          |\r\n |           adapted to their apparent Altitudes_. |\r\n |                                                 |\r\n +-------+---------++----+---------++----+---------+\r\n | Appar.| Refrac- ||Ap. | Refrac- ||Ap. | Refrac- |\r\n |  Alt. | tion.   ||Alt.| tion.   ||Alt.| tion.   |\r\n +-------+---------++----+---------++----+---------+\r\n | D.

In all observations, to have the true altitude of the Sun, Moon, or\r\nStars, the refraction must be subtracted from the observed altitude. But\r\nthe quantity of refraction is not always the same at the same altitude;\r\nbecause heat diminishes the air’s refractive power and density, and cold\r\nincreases both; and therefore no one table can serve precisely for the\r\nsame place at all seasons, nor even at all times of the same day; much\r\nless for different climates: it having been observed that the horizontal\r\nrefractions are near a third part less at the Equator than at _Paris_,\r\nas mentioned by Dr. SMITH in the 370th remark on his Optics, where the\r\nfollowing account is given of an extraordinary refraction of the\r\nsun-beams by cold. “There is a famous observation of this kind made by\r\nsome _Hollanders_ that wintered in _Nova Zembla_ in the year 1596, who\r\nwere surprised to find, that after a continual night of three months,\r\nthe Sun began to rise seventeen days sooner than according to\r\ncomputation, deduced from the Altitude of the Pole observed to be 76°:\r\nwhich cannot otherwise be accounted for, than by an extraordinary\r\nquantity of refraction of the Sun’s rays, passing thro’ the cold dense\r\nair in that climate. KEPLER computes that the Sun was almost five\r\ndegrees below the Horizon when he first appeared; and consequently the\r\nrefraction of his rays was about nine times greater than it is with us.”\r\n\r\n184. The Sun and Moon appear of an oval figure as _FCGD_, just after\r\ntheir rising, and before their setting: the reason is, that the\r\nrefraction being greater in the Horizon than at any distance above it,\r\nthe lowermost limb _G_ appears more elevated than the uppermost. But\r\nalthough the refraction shortens the vertical Diameter _FG_, it has no\r\nsensible effect on the horizontal Diameter _CD_, which is all equally\r\nelevated. When the refraction is so small as to be imperceptible, the\r\nSun and Moon appear perfectly round, as _AEBF_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Our imagination cannot judge rightly of the distance of\r\n           inaccessible objects.]\r\n\r\n185. We daily observe, that the objects which appear most distinct are\r\ngenerally those which are nearest to us; and consequently, when we have\r\nnothing but our imagination to assist us in estimating of distances,\r\nbright objects seem nearer to us than those which are less bright, or\r\nthan the same objects do when they appear less bright and worse defined,\r\neven though their distance in both cases be the same. And as in both\r\ncases they are seen under the same angle[44], our imagination naturally\r\nsuggests an idea of a greater distance between us and those objects\r\nwhich appear fainter and worse defined than those which appear brighter\r\nunder the same Angles; especially if they be such objects as we were\r\nnever near to, and of whose real Magnitudes we can be no judges by\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor always of those which are accessible.]\r\n\r\n186. But, it is not only in judging of the different apparent Magnitudes\r\nof the same objects, which are better or worse defined by their being\r\nmore or less bright, that we may be deceived: for we may make a wrong\r\nconclusion even when we view them under equal degrees of brightness, and\r\nunder equal Angles; although they be objects whose bulks we are\r\ngenerally acquainted with, such as houses or trees: for proof of which,\r\nthe two following instances may suffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason assigned.\r\n\r\n           PLATE II.]\r\n\r\nFirst, When a house is seen over a very broad river by a person standing\r\non low ground, who sees nothing of the river, nor knows of it\r\nbeforehand; the breadth of the river being hid from him, because the\r\nbanks seem contiguous, he loses the idea of a distance equal to that\r\nbreadth; and the house seems small, because he refers it to a less\r\ndistance than it really is at. But, if he goes to a place from which the\r\nriver and interjacent ground can be seen, though no farther from the\r\nhouse, he then perceives the house to be at a greater distance than he\r\nimagined; and therefore fancies it to be bigger than he did at first;\r\nalthough in both cases it appears under the same Angle, and consequently\r\nmakes no bigger picture on the retina of his eye in the latter case than\r\nit did in the former. Many have been deceived, by taking a red coat of\r\narms, fixed upon the iron gate in _Clare-Hall_ walks at _Cambridge_, for\r\na brick house at a much greater distance[45].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. XII.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, In foggy weather, at first sight, we generally imagine a small\r\nhouse, which is just at hand, to be a great castle at a distance;\r\nbecause it appears so dull and ill defined when seen through the Mist,\r\nthat we refer it to a much greater distance than it really is at; and\r\ntherefore, under the same Angle, we judge it to be much bigger. For, the\r\nnear object _FE_, seen by the eye _ABD_, appears under the same Angle\r\n_GCH_, that the remote object _GHI_ does: and the rays _GFCN_ and _HECM_\r\ncrossing one another at _C_ in the pupil of the eye, limit the size of\r\nthe picture _MN_ on the retina; which is the picture of the object _FE_,\r\nand if _FE_ were taken away, would be the picture of the object _GHI_,\r\nonly worse defined; because _GHI_, being farther off, appears duller and\r\nfainter than _FE_ did. But if a Fog, as _KL_, comes between the eye and\r\nthe object _FE_, it appears dull and ill defined like _GHI_; which\r\ncauses our imagination to refer _FE_ to the greater distance _CH_,\r\ninstead of the small distance _CE_ which it really is at. And\r\nconsequently, as mis-judging the distance does not in the least diminish\r\nthe Angle under which the object appears, the small hay-rick _FE_ seems\r\nto be as big as _GHI_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IX.\r\n\r\n           Why the Sun and Moon appear biggest in the Horizon.]\r\n\r\n187. The Sun and Moon appear bigger in the Horizon than at any\r\nconsiderable height above it. These Luminaries, although at great\r\ndistances from the Earth, appear floating, as it were, on the surface of\r\nour Atmosphere _HGFfeC_, a little way beyond the Clouds; of which, those\r\nabout _F_, directly over our heads at _E_, are nearer us than those\r\nabout _H_ or _e_ in the Horizon _HEe_. Therefore, when the Sun or Moon\r\nappear in the Horizon at _e_, they are not only seen in a part of the\r\nSky which is really farther from us than if they were at any\r\nconsiderable Altitude, as about _f_; but they are also seen through a\r\ngreater quantity of Air and Vapours at _e_ than at _f_. Here we have two\r\nconcurring appearances which deceive our imagination, and cause us to\r\nrefer the Sun and Moon to a greater distance at their rising or setting\r\nabout _e_, than when they are considerably high as at _f_: first, their\r\nseeming to be on a part of the Atmosphere at _e_, which is really\r\nfarther than _f_ from a spectator at _E_; and secondly, their being seen\r\nthrough a grosser medium when at _e_ than when at _f_; which, by\r\nrendering them dimmer, causes us to imagine them to be at a yet greater\r\ndistance. And as, in both cases, they are seen[46] much under the same\r\nAngle, we naturally judge them to be biggest when they seem farthest\r\nfrom us; like the above-mentioned house § 186, seen from a higher\r\nground, which shewed it to be farther off than it appeared from low\r\nground; or the hay-rick, which appeared at a greater distance by means\r\nof an interposing Fog.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Diameters are not less on the Meridian than in the\r\n           Horizon.]\r\n\r\n188. Any one may satisfy himself that the Moon appears under no greater\r\nAngle in the Horizon than on the Meridian, by taking a large sheet of\r\npaper, and rolling it up in the form of a Tube, of such a width, that\r\nobserving the Moon through it when she rises, she may, as it were, just\r\nfill the Tube; then tie a thread round it to keep it of that size; and\r\nwhen the Moon comes to the Meridian, and appears much less to the eye,\r\nlook at her again through the same Tube, and she will fill it just as\r\nmuch, if not more, than she did at her rising.\r\n\r\n189. When the full Moon is in _perigeo_, or at her least distance from\r\nthe Earth, she is seen under a larger Angle, and must therefore appear\r\nbigger than when she is Full at other times: and if that part of the\r\nAtmosphere where she rises be more replete with vapours than usual, she\r\nappears so much the dimmer; and therefore we fancy her to be still the\r\nbigger, by referring her to an unusually great distance; knowing that no\r\nobjects which are very far distant can appear big unless they be really\r\nso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IIII. _J.

Let _CRS_ be\r\nthe rational Horizon of an observer at _A_, extended to the Sun in the\r\nHeavens, and _HAO_ his sensible Horizon; extended to the Moon’s Orbit.\r\n_ALC_ is the Angle under which the Earth’s semi-diameter _AC_ is seen\r\nfrom the Moon at _L_, which is equal to the Angle _OAL_, because the\r\nright lines _AO_ and _CL_ which include both these Angles are parallel.\r\n_ASC_ is the Angle under which the Earth’s semi-diameter _AC_ is seen\r\nfrom the Sun at _S_, and is equal to the Angle _OAf_ because the lines\r\n_AO_ and _CRS_ are parallel. Now, it is found by observation, that the\r\nAngle _OAL_ is much greater than the Angle _OAf_; but _OAL_ is equal to\r\n_ALC_, and _OAf_ is equal to _ASC_. Now, as _ASC_ is much less than\r\n_ALC_, it proves that the Earth’s semi-diameter _AC_ appears much\r\ngreater as seen from the Moon at _L_ than from the Sun at _S_: and\r\ntherefore the Earth is much farther from the Sun than from the Moon[48].\r\nThe Quantities of these Angles are determined by observation in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s horizontal Parallax, what.\r\n\r\n           The Moon’s distance determined.]\r\n\r\nLet a graduated instrument as _DAE_, (the larger the better) having a\r\nmoveable Index and Sight-holes, be fixed in such a manner, that it’s\r\nplane surface may be parallel to the Plan of the Equator, and it’s edge\r\n_AD_ in the Meridian: so that when the Moon is in the Equinoctial, and\r\non the Meridian at _E_, she may be seen through the sight-holes when the\r\nedge of the moveable index cuts the beginning of the divisions at o, on\r\nthe graduated limb _DE_; and when she is so seen, let the _precise_ time\r\nbe noted. Now, as the Moon revolves about the Earth from the Meridian to\r\nthe Meridian again in 24 hours 48 minutes, she will go a fourth part\r\nround it in a fourth part of that time, _viz._ in 6 hours 12 minutes, as\r\nseen from _C_, that is, from the Earth’s center or Pole. But as seen\r\nfrom _A_, the observer’s place on the Earth’s surface, the Moon will\r\nseem to have gone a quarter round the Earth when she comes to the\r\nsensible Horizon at _O_; for the Index through the sights of which she\r\nis then viewed will be at _d_, 90 degrees from _D_, where it was when\r\nshe was seen at _E_. Now, let the exact moment when the Moon is seen at\r\n_O_ (which will be when she is in or near the sensible Horizon) be\r\ncarefully noted[49], that it may be known in what time she has gone from\r\n_E_ to _O_; which time subtracted from 6 hours 12 minutes (the time of\r\nher going from _E_ to _L_) leaves the time of her going from _O_ to _L_,\r\nand affords an easy method for finding the Angle _OAL_ (called _the\r\nMoon’s horizontal Parallax_, which is equal to the Angle _ALC_) by the\r\nfollowing Analogy: As the time of the Moon’s describing the arc _EO_ is\r\nto 90 degrees, so is 6 hours 12 minutes to the degrees of the Arc _DdE_,\r\nwhich measures the Angle _EAL_; from which subtract 90 degrees, and\r\nthere remains the Angle _OAL_, equal to the Angle _ALC_, under which the\r\nEarth’s Semi-diameter _AC_ is seen from the Moon. Now, since all the\r\nAngles of a right-lined Triangle are equal to 180 degrees, or to two\r\nright Angles, and the sides of a Triangle are always proportional to the\r\nSines of the opposite Angles, say, by the _Rule of Three_, as the Sine\r\nof the Angle _ALC_ at the Moon _L_ is to it’s opposite side _AC_ the\r\nEarth’s Semi-diameter, which is known to be 3985 miles, so is Radius,\r\n_viz._ the Sine of 90 degrees, or of the right Angle _ACL_ to it’s\r\nopposite side _AL_, which is the Moon’s distance at _L_ from the\r\nobserver’s place at _A_ on the Earth’s surface; or, so is the Sine of\r\nthe Angle _CAL_ to its opposite side _CL_, which is the Moon’s distance\r\nfrom the Earth’s centre, and comes out at a mean rate to be 240,000\r\nmiles. The Angle _CAL_ is equal to what _OAL_ wants of 90 degrees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun’s distance cannot be yet so exactly determined as the\r\n           Moon’s;\r\n\r\n           How near the truth it may soon be determined.]\r\n\r\n191. The Sun’s distance from the Earth is found the same way, but with\r\nmuch greater difficulty; because his horizontal Parallax, or the Angle\r\n_OAS_ equal to the Angle _ASC_, is so small as, to be hardly\r\nperceptible, being only 10 seconds of a minute, or the 360th part of a\r\ndegree. But the Moon’s horizontal Parallax, or Angle _OAL_ equal to the\r\nAngle _ALC_, is very discernible; being 57ʹ 49ʺ, or 3469ʺ at it’s mean\r\nstate; which is more than 340 times as great as the Sun’s: and\r\ntherefore, the distances of the heavenly bodies being inversely as the\r\nTangents of their horizontal Parallaxes, the Sun’s distance from the\r\nEarth is at least 340 times as great as the Moon’s; and is rather\r\nunderstated at 81 millions of miles, when the Moon’s distance is\r\ncertainly known to be 240 thousand. But because, according to some\r\nAstronomers, the Sun’s horizontal Parallax is 11 seconds, and according\r\nto others only 10, the former Parallax making the Sun’s distance to be\r\nabout 75,000,000 of miles, and the latter 82,000,000; we may take it for\r\ngranted, that the Sun’s distance is not less than as deduced from the\r\nformer, nor more than as shewn by the latter: and every one who is\r\naccustomed to make such observations, knows how hard it is, if not\r\nimpossible, to avoid an error of a second; especially on account of the\r\ninconstancy of horizontal Refractions. And here, the error of one\r\nsecond, in so small an Angle, will make an error of 7 millions of miles\r\nin so great a distance as that of the Sun’s; and much more in the\r\ndistances of the superiour Planets. But Dr. HALLEY has shewn us how the\r\nSun’s distance from the Earth, and consequently the distances of all the\r\nPlanets from the Sun, may be known to within a 500th part of the whole,\r\nby a Transit of Venus over the Sun’s Disc, which will happen on the 6th\r\nof _June_, in the year 1761; till which time we must content ourselves\r\nwith allowing the Sun’s distance to be about 81 millions of miles, as\r\ncommonly stated by Astronomers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun proved to be much bigger than the Moon.]\r\n\r\n192. The Sun and Moon appear much about the same bulk: And every one who\r\nunderstands Geometry knows how their true bulks may be deduced from the\r\napparent, when their real distances are known. Spheres are to one\r\nanother as the Cubes of their Diameters; whence, if the Sun be 81\r\nmillions of miles from the Earth, to appear as big as the Moon, whose\r\ndistance does not exceed 240 thousand miles, he must, in solid bulk, be\r\n42 millions 875 thousand times as big as the Moon.\r\n\r\n193. The horizontal Parallaxes are best observed at the Equator; 1.\r\nBecause the heat is so nearly equal every day, that the Refractions are\r\nalmost constantly the same. 2. Because the parallactic Angle is greater\r\nthere as at _A_ (the distance from thence to the Earth’s Axis being\r\ngreater,) than upon any parallel of Latitude, as _a_ or _b_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The relative distances of the Planets from the Sun are known\r\n           to great precision, though their real distances are not well\r\n           known.]\r\n\r\n194. The Earth’s distance from the Sun being determined, the distances\r\nof all the other Planets from him are easily found by the following\r\nanalogy, their periods round him being ascertained by observation. As\r\nthe square of the Earth’s period round the Sun is to the cube of it’s\r\ndistance from him, so is the square of the period of any other Planet to\r\nthe cube of it’s distance, in such parts or measures as the Earth’s\r\ndistance was taken; see § 111. This proportion gives us the relative\r\nmean distances of the Planets from the Sun to the greatest degree of\r\nexactness; and they are as follows, having been deduced from their\r\nperiodical times, according to the law just mentioned, which was\r\ndiscovered by KEPLER and demonstrated by Sir ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Periodical Revolution to the same fixed Star in days and decimal parts\r\n                                of a day._\r\n\r\n  Of Mercury     Venus      The Earth       Mars       Jupiter       Saturn\r\n\r\n   87.9692      224.6176     365.2564     686.9785     4332.514    10759.275\r\n\r\n                    _Relative mean distances from the Sun._\r\n\r\n    38710        72333        100000       152369       520096       954006\r\n\r\n _From these numbers we deduce, that if the Sun’s horizontal Parallax be 10ʺ,\r\n   the real mean distances of the Planets from the Sun in English miles are_\r\n\r\n  31,742,200   59,313,060   82,000,000  124,942,580  426,478,720  782,284,920\r\n\r\n      _But if the Sun’s Parallax be 11ʺ their distances are no more than_\r\n\r\n  29,032,500   54,238,570   75,000,000  114,276,750  390,034,500  715,504,500\r\n\r\n   Errors in  distance a rising from the mistake of 1ʺ in the Sun’s Parallax\r\n\r\n  2,709,700    5,074,490    7,000,000    10,665,830   36,444,220   66,780,420\r\n\r\n195. These last numbers shew, that although we have the relative\r\ndistances of the Planets from the Sun to the greatest nicety, yet the\r\nbest observers have not hitherto been able to ascertain their true\r\ndistances to within less than a twelfth part of what they really are.\r\nAnd therefore, we must wait with patience till the 6th of _June_, A. D.\r\n1761; wishing that the Sky may then be clear to all places where there\r\nare good Astronomers and accurate instruments for observing the Transit\r\nof Venus over the Sun’s Disc at that time: as it will not happen again,\r\nso as to be visible in Europe, in less than 235 years after.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the celestial Poles seem to keep still in the same points\r\n           of the Heavens, notwithstanding the Earth’s motion round the\r\n           Sun.]\r\n\r\n196. The Earth’s Axis produced to the Stars, being carried [50]parallel\r\nto itself during the Earth’s annual revolution, describes a circle in\r\nthe Sphere of the fixed Stars equal to the Orbit of the Earth. But this\r\nOrbit, though very large in itself, if viewed from the Stars, would\r\nappear no bigger than a point; and consequently, the circle described in\r\nthe Sphere of the Stars by the Axis of the Earth produced, if viewed\r\nfrom the Earth, must appear but as a point; that is, it’s diameter\r\nappears too little to be measured by observation: for Dr. BRADLEY has\r\nassured us, that if it had amounted to a single second, or two at most,\r\nhe should have perceived it in the great number of observations he has\r\nmade, especially upon γ _Dragonis_; and that it seemed to him very\r\nprobable that the annual Parallax of this Star is not so great as a\r\nsingle second: and consequently, that it is above 400 thousand times\r\nfarther from us than the Sun. Hence the celestial poles seem to continue\r\nin the same points of the Heavens throughout the year; which by no means\r\ndisproves the Earth’s annual motion, but plainly proves the distance of\r\nthe Stars to be exceeding great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The amazing velocity of light.\r\n\r\n           PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\n197. The small apparent motion of the Stars § 113, discovered by that\r\ngreat Astronomer, he found to be no ways owing to their annual Parallax\r\n(for it came out contrary thereto) but to the Aberration of their light,\r\nwhich can result from no known cause besides that of the Earth’s annual\r\nmotion; and as it agrees so exactly therewith, it proves beyond dispute\r\nthat the Earth has such a motion: for this Aberration compleats all it’s\r\nvarious Phenomena every year; and proves that the velocity of star-light\r\nis such as carries it through a space equal to the Sun’s distance from\r\nus in 8 minutes 13 seconds of time. Hence, the velocity of light is\r\n[51]10 thousand 210 times as great as the Earth’s velocity in it’s\r\nOrbit; which velocity (from what we know already of the Earth’s distance\r\nfrom the Sun) may be affected to be at least between 57 and 58 thousand\r\nmiles every hour: and supposing it to be 58000, this number multiplied\r\nby the above 10210, gives 592 million 180 thousand miles for the hourly\r\nmotion of light: which last number divided by 3600, the number of\r\nseconds in an hour, shews that light flies at the rate of more than 164\r\nthousand miles every second of time, or swing of a common clock\r\npendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAP.

If the reader be hitherto unacquainted with the principal circles\r\nof the Globe, he should now learn to know them; which he may do\r\nsufficiently for his present purpose in a quarter of an hour, if he sets\r\nthe ball of a terrestrial Globe before him, or looks at the Figure of\r\nit, wherein these circles are drawn and named. The _Equator_ is that\r\ngreat circle which divides the northern half of the Earth from the\r\nsouthern. The _Tropics_ are lesser circles parallel to the Equator, and\r\neach of them is 23-1/2 degrees from it; a degree in this sense being the\r\n360th part of any great circle which divides the Earth into two equal\r\nparts. The _Tropic of Cancer_ lies on the north side of the Equator, and\r\nthe _Tropic of Capricorn_ on the south. The _Arctic Circle_ has the\r\n_North Pole_ for it’s center, and is just as far from the north Pole as\r\nthe Tropics are from the Equator: and the _Antarctic Circle_ (hid by the\r\nsupposed convexity of the Figure) is just as far from the _South Pole_,\r\nevery way round it. These Poles are the very north and south points of\r\nthe Globe: and all other places are denominated _northward_ or\r\n_southward_ according to the side of the Equator they lie on, and the\r\nPole to which they are nearest. The Earth’s _Axis_ is a straight line\r\npassing through the center of the Earth, perpendicular to the Equator,\r\nand terminating in the Poles at it’s surface. This, in the real Earth\r\nand Planets is only an imaginary line; but in artificial Globes or\r\nPlanets it is a wire by which they are supported, and turned round in\r\n_Orreries_, or such like machines, by wheel-work. The circles 12. 1. 2.\r\n3. 4, _&c._ are Meridians to all places they pass through; and we must\r\nsuppose thousands more to be drawn, because every place that is ever so\r\nlittle to the east or west of any other place, has a different Meridian\r\nfrom that other place. All the Meridians meet in the Poles; and whenever\r\nthe Sun’s center is passing over any Meridian, in his apparent motion\r\nround the Earth, it is mid-day or noon to all places on that Meridian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zones.]\r\n\r\n199. The _broad Space_ lying between the Tropics, like a girdle\r\nsurrounding the Globe, is called the _torrid Zone_, of which the Equator\r\nis in the middle, all around. The _Space_ between the Tropic of Cancer\r\nand Arctic Circle is called the _North temperate Zone_. _That_ between\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle, the _South temperate\r\nZone_. And the two _circular Spaces_ bounded by the Polar Circles are\r\nthe two _Frigid Zones_; denominated _north_ or _south_, from that Pole\r\nwhich is in the center of the one or the other of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n200. Having acquired this easy branch of knowledge, the learner may\r\nproceed to make the following experiment with his terrestrial ball;\r\nwhich will give him a plain idea of the diurnal and annual motions of\r\nthe Earth, together with the different lengths of days and nights, and\r\nall the beautiful variety of seasons, depending on those motions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           A pleasant experiment shewing the different lengths of days\r\n           and nights, and the variety of seasons.\r\n\r\n           Summer Solstice.]\r\n\r\nTake about seven feet of strong wire, and bend it into a circular form,\r\nas _abcd_, which being viewed obliquely, appears elliptical as in the\r\nFigure. Place a lighted candle on a table, and having fixed one end of a\r\nsilk thread _K_, to the north pole of a small terrestrial Globe _H_,\r\nabout three inches diameter, cause another person to hold the wire\r\ncircle so that it may be parallel to the table, and as high as the flame\r\nof the candle _I_, which should be in or near the center. Then, having\r\ntwisted the thread as towards the left hand, that by untwisting it may\r\nturn the Globe round eastward, or contrary to the way that the hands of\r\na watch move; hang the Globe by the thread within this circle, almost\r\ncontiguous to it; and as the thread untwists, the Globe (which is\r\nenlightened half round by the candle as the Earth is by the Sun) will\r\nturn round it’s Axis, and the different places upon it will be carried\r\nthrough the light and dark Hemispheres, and have the appearance of a\r\nregular succession of days and nights, as our Earth has in reality by\r\nsuch a motion. As the Globe turns, move your hand slowly so as to carry\r\nthe Globe round the candle according to the order of the letters _abcd_,\r\nkeeping it’s center even with the wire circle; and you will perceive,\r\nthat the candle being still perpendicular to the Equator will enlighten\r\nthe Globe from pole to pole in it’s motion round the circle; and that\r\nevery place on the Globe goes equally through the light and the dark, as\r\nit turns round by the untwisting of the thread, and therefore has a\r\nperpetual Equinox. The Globe thus turning round represents the Earth\r\nturning round it’s Axis; and the motion of the Globe round the candle\r\nrepresents the Earth’s annual motion round the Sun, and shews, that if\r\nthe Earth’s Orbit had no inclination to it’s Axis, all the days and\r\nnights of the year would be equally long, and there would be no\r\ndifferent seasons. But now, desire the person who holds the wire to hold\r\nit obliquely in the position _ABCD_, raising the side ♋ just as much as\r\nhe depresses the side ♑, that the flame may be still in the plane of the\r\ncircle; and twisting the thread as before, that the Globe may turn round\r\nit’s Axis the same way as you carry it round the candle; that is, from\r\nwest to east, let the Globe down into the lowermost part of the wire\r\ncircle at ♑, and if the circles be properly inclined, the candle will\r\nshine perpendicularly on the Tropic of Cancer, and the _frigid Zone_,\r\nlying within the _arctic_ or _north polar Circle_, will be all in the\r\nlight, as in the Figure; and will keep in the light let the Globe turn\r\nround it’s Axis ever so often. From the Equator to the north polar\r\nCircle all the places have longer days and shorter nights; but from the\r\nEquator to the south polar Circle just the reverse. The Sun does not set\r\nto any part of the north frigid Zone, as shewn by the candle’s shining\r\non it so that the motion of the Globe can carry no place of that Zone\r\ninto the dark: and at the same time the _south frigid Zone_ is involved\r\nin darkness, and the turning of the Globe brings none of it’s places\r\ninto the light. If the Earth were to continue in the like part of it’s\r\nOrbit, the Sun would never set to the inhabitants of the north frigid\r\nZone, nor rise to those of the south. At the Equator it would be always\r\nequal day and night; and as the places are gradually more and more\r\ndistant from the Equator, towards the arctic Circle, they would have\r\nlonger days and shorter nights, whilst those on the south side of the\r\nEquator would have their nights longer than their days. In this case\r\nthere would be continual summer on the north side of the Equator, and\r\ncontinual winter on the south side of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate V.\r\n\r\n_J. Ferguson delin._        _J. Mynde Sc._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n           Autumnal Equinox.]\r\n\r\nBut as the Globe turns round it’s Axis, move your hand slowly forward so\r\nas to carry the Globe from _H_ towards _E_, and the boundary of light\r\nand darkness will approach towards the north Pole, and recede towards\r\nthe south Pole; the northern places will go through less and less of the\r\nlight, and the southern places through more and more of it; shewing how\r\nthe northern days decrease in length, and the southern days increase,\r\nwhilst the Globe proceeds from _H_ to _F_. When the Globe is at _E_, it\r\nis at a mean state between the lowest and highest parts of it’s Orbit;\r\nthe candle is directly over the Equator, the boundary of light and\r\ndarkness just reaches to both the Poles, and all places on the Globe go\r\nequally through the light and dark Hemispheres, shewing that the days\r\nand nights are then equal at all places of the Earth, the Poles only\r\nexcepted; for the Sun is then setting to the north Pole, and rising to\r\nthe south Pole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter Solstice.]\r\n\r\nContinue moving the Globe forward, and as it goes through the quarter\r\n_A_, the north Pole recedes still farther into the dark Hemisphere, and\r\nthe south Pole advances more into the light, as the Globe comes nearer\r\nto ♋; and when it comes there at _F_, the candle is directly over the\r\nTropic of Capricorn, the days are at the shortest, and nights at the\r\nlongest, in the northern Hemisphere, all the way from the Equator to the\r\narctic Circle; and the reverse in the southern Hemisphere from the\r\nantarctic Circle; within which Circles it is dark to the north frigid\r\nZone and light to the south.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vernal Equinox.]\r\n\r\nContinue both motions, and as the Globe moves through the quarter _B_,\r\nthe north Pole advances toward the light, and the south Pole recedes as\r\nfast from it; the days lengthen in the northern Hemisphere, and shorten\r\nin the southern; and when the Globe comes to _G_ the candle will be\r\nagain over the Equator (as when the Globe was at _E_) and the days and\r\nnights will again be equal as formerly: and the north Pole will be just\r\ncoming into the light, the south Pole going out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we see the reason why the days lengthen and shorten from the\r\nEquator to the polar Circles every year; why there is no day or night\r\nfor several turnings of the Earth, within the polar Circles; why there\r\nis but one day and one night in the whole year at the Poles; and why the\r\ndays and nights are equally long all the year round at the Equator,\r\nwhich is always equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remark.\r\n\r\n           Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           PLATE V.]\r\n\r\n201. The inclination of an Axis or Orbit is merely relative, because we\r\ncompare it with some other Axis or Orbit which we consider as not\r\ninclined at all. Thus, our Horizon being level to us whatever place of\r\nthe Earth we are upon, we consider it as having no inclination; and yet,\r\nif we travel 90 degrees from that place, we shall then have an Horizon\r\nperpendicular to the former; but it will still be level to us. And, if\r\nthis Book be held so that the [52]Circle _ABCD_ be parallel to the\r\nHorizon, both the Circle _abcd_, and the Thread or Axis _K_ will be\r\ninclined to it. But if Book or Plate be held, so that the Thread be\r\nperpendicular to the Horizon, then the Orbit _ABCD_ will be inclined to\r\nthe Thread, and the Orbit _abcd_ perpendicular to it, and parallel to\r\nthe Horizon. We generally consider the Earth’s annual Orbit as having no\r\ninclination, and the Orbits of all the other Planets as inclined to it §\r\n20.\r\n\r\n\r\n202. Let us now take a view of the Earth in it’s annual course round the\r\nSun, considering it’s Orbit as having no inclination; and it’s Axis as\r\ninclining 23-1/2 degrees from a line perpendicular to it’s Orbit, and\r\nkeeping the same oblique direction in all parts of it’s annual course;\r\nor, as commonly termed, keeping always parallel to itself § 196.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           A concise view of the seasons.]\r\n\r\nLet _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _h_ be the Earth in eight\r\ndifferent parts of it’s Orbit, equidistant from one another; _Ns_ it’s\r\nAxis, _N_ the north Pole, _s_ the south Pole, and _S_ the Sun nearly in\r\nthe center of the Earth’s Orbit § 18. As the Earth goes round the Sun\r\naccording to the order of the letters _abcd_, &c. it’s Axis _Ns_ keeps\r\nthe same obliquity, and is still parallel to the line _MNs_. When the\r\nEarth is at _a_, it’s north Pole inclines toward the Sun, and brings all\r\nthe northern places more into the light than at any other time of the\r\nyear. But when the Earth is at _e_ in the opposite time of the year, the\r\nnorth Pole declines from the Sun, which occasions the northern places to\r\nbe more in the dark than in the light; and the reverse at the southern\r\nplaces, as is evident by the Figure, which I have taken from Dr. LONG’s\r\nAstronomy. When the Earth is either at _c_ or _g_, it’s Axis inclines\r\nnot either to or from the Sun, but lies sidewise to him; and then the\r\nPoles are in the boundary of light and darkness; and the Sun, being\r\ndirectly over the Equator, makes equal day and night at all places. When\r\nthe Earth is at _b_ it is half way between the Summer Solstice and\r\nHarvest Equinox; when it is at _d_ it is half way from the Harvest\r\nEquinox to the Winter Solstice; at _f_ half way from the Winter Solstice\r\nto the Spring Equinox: and at _h_ half way from the Spring Equinox to\r\nthe Summer Solstice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           PLATE V.\r\n\r\n           The Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n           The seasons shewn in another view of the Earth, and it’s Orbit.]\r\n\r\n203. From this oblique view of the Earth’s Orbit, let us suppose\r\nourselves to be raised far above it, and placed just over it’s center\r\n_S_, looking down upon it from it’s north pole; and as the Earth’s Orbit\r\ndiffers but very little from a Circle, we shall have it’s figure in such\r\na view represented by the Circle _ABCDEFGH_. Let us suppose this Circle\r\nto be divided into 12 equal parts called _Signs_, having their names\r\naffixed to them; and each Sign into 30 equal parts called _Degrees_,\r\nnumbered 10, 20, 30, as in the outermost Circle of the Figure, which\r\nrepresents the great Ecliptic in the Heavens. The Earth is shewn in\r\neight different positions in this Circle, and in each position _Æ_ is\r\nthe Equator, _T_ the Tropic of Cancer, the _dotted Circle_ the parallel\r\nof _London_, _U_ the arctic or north polar Circle, and _P_ the north\r\nPole where all the Meridians or hour Circles meet § 198. As the Earth\r\ngoes round the Sun the north Pole keeps constantly towards one part of\r\nthe Heavens, as it keeps in the Figure towards the right hand side of\r\nthe Plate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vernal Equinox.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth is at the beginning of Libra, namely on the 20th of\r\n_March_, in this Figure (as at _g_ in Fig. I.) the Sun _S_ as seen from\r\nthe Earth appears at the beginning of Aries in the opposite part of the\r\nHeavens[53], the north Pole is just coming into the light, the Sun is\r\nvertical to the Equator; which, together with the Tropic of Cancer,\r\nparallel of _London_, and arctic Circle, are all equally cut by the\r\nCircle bounding light and darkness, coinciding with the six o’clock hour\r\nCircle, and therefore the days and nights are equally long at all\r\nplaces: for every part of the Meridian _ÆTLa_ comes into the light at\r\nsix in the morning, and revolving with the Earth according to the order\r\nof the hour-letters, goes into the dark at six in the evening. There are\r\n24 Meridians or hour-Circles drawn on the Earth in this Figure, to shew\r\nthe time of Sun rising and setting at different Seasons of the Year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\nAs the Earth moves in the Ecliptic according to the order of the letters\r\n_ABCD_, &c. through the Signs Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, the north\r\nPole comes more and more into the light; the days increase as the nights\r\ndecrease in length, at all places north of the Equator _Æ_; which is\r\nplain by viewing the Earth at _b_ on the 5th of _May_, when it is in the\r\n15th degree of Scorpio[54], and the Sun as seen from the Earth appears\r\nin the 15th degree of Taurus. For then, the Tropic of Cancer _T_ is in\r\nthe light from a little after five in the morning till almost seven in\r\nthe evening; the parallel of _London_ from half an hour past four till\r\nhalf an hour past seven; the polar Circle _U_ from three till nine; and\r\na large track round the north Pole _P_ has day all the 24 hours, for\r\nmany rotations of the Earth on it’s Axis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summer Solstice.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth comes to _c_, at the beginning of Capricorn, and the Sun\r\nas seen from the Earth appears at the beginning of Cancer, on the 21st\r\nof _June_, as in this Figure, it is in the position _a_ in Fig. I; and\r\nit’s north Pole inclines toward the Sun, so as to bring all the north\r\nfrigid Zone into the light, and the northern parallels of Latitude more\r\ninto the light than the dark from the Equator to the polar Circles; and\r\nthe more so as they are farther from the Equator. The Tropic of Cancer\r\nis in the light from five in the morning till seven at night, the\r\nparallel of _London_ from a quarter before four till a quarter after\r\neight; and the polar Circle just touches the dark, so that the Sun has\r\nonly the lower half of his Disc hid from the inhabitants on that Circle\r\nfor a few minutes about midnight, supposing no inequalities in the\r\nHorizon and no Refractions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Autumnal Equinox.\r\n\r\n           Winter Solstice.]\r\n\r\nA bare view of the Figure is enough to shew, that as the Earth advances\r\nfrom Capricorn toward Aries, and the Sun appears to move from Cancer\r\ntoward Libra, the north Pole recedes toward the dark, which causes the\r\ndays to decrease, and the nights to increase in length, till the Earth\r\ncomes to Aries, and then they are equal as before; for the boundary of\r\nlight and darkness cut the Equator and all it’s parallels equally, or in\r\nhalves. The north pole then goes into the dark, and continues therein\r\nuntil the Earth goes half way round it’s Orbit; or, from the 23d of\r\n_September_ till the 20th of _March_. In the middle between these times,\r\n_viz._ on the 22d of _December_, the north Pole is as far as it can be\r\nin the dark, which is 23-1/2 degrees, equal to the inclination of the\r\nEarth’s Axis from a perpendicular to it’s Orbit: and then, the northern\r\nparallels are as much in the dark as they were in the light on the 21 of\r\n_June_; the winter nights being as long as the summer days, and the\r\nwinter days as short as the summer nights. It is needless to multiply\r\nwords on this subject, as we shall have occasion to mention the seasons\r\nagain in describing the _Orrery_, § 439. Only this must be noted, that\r\nall that has been said of the northern Hemisphere, the contrary must be\r\nunderstood of the southern; for on different sides of the Equator the\r\nseasons are contrary, because, when the northern Hemisphere inclines\r\ntoward the Sun the southern declines from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Phenomena of Saturn’s Ring.\r\n\r\n           PLATE V.]\r\n\r\n204. As Saturn goes round the Sun, his obliquely posited ring, like our\r\nEarth’s Axis, keeps parallel to itself, and is therefore turned edgewise\r\nto the Sun twice in a Saturnian year, which is almost as long as 30 of\r\nour years § 81. But the ring, though considerably broad, is too thin to\r\nbe seen when it is turned round edgewise to the Sun, at which time it is\r\nalso edgewise to the Earth; and therefore it disappears once in every\r\nfifteen years to us. As the Sun shines half a year on the north pole of\r\nour earth, then disappears to it, and shines as long on the south pole;\r\nso, during one half of Saturn’s year the Sun shines on the north side of\r\nhis ring, then disappears to it, and shines as long on it’s south side.\r\nWhen the Earth’s Axis inclines neither to nor from the Sun, but sidewise\r\nto him, he instantly ceases to shine on one pole, and begins to\r\nenlighten the other; and when Saturn’s Ring inclines neither to nor from\r\nthe Sun, but sidewise to him, he ceases to shine on the one side of it,\r\nand begins to shine upon the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nLet _S_ be the Sun, _ABCDEFGH_ Saturn’s Orbit, and _IKLMNO_ the Earth’s\r\nOrbit. Both Saturn and the Earth move according to the order of the\r\nletters, and when Saturn is at _A_ his ring is turned edgewise to the\r\nSun _S_, and he is then seen from the Earth as if he had lost his ring,\r\nlet the Earth be in any part of it’s Orbit whatever, except between _N_\r\nand _O_; for whilst it describes that space, Saturn is apparently so\r\nnear the Sun as to be hid in his beams. As Saturn goes from _A_ to _C_\r\nhis ring appears more and more open to the Earth: at _C_ the ring\r\nappears most open of all; and seems to grow narrower and narrower as\r\nSaturn goes from _C_ to _E_; and when he comes to _E_, the ring is again\r\nturned edgewise both to the Sun and Earth: and as neither of it’s sides\r\nare illuminated, it is invisible to us, because it’s edge is too thin to\r\nbe perceptible: and Saturn appears again as if he had lost his ring. But\r\nas he goes from _E_ to _G_, his ring opens more and more to our view on\r\nthe under side; and seems just as open at _G_ as it was at _C_; and may\r\nbe seen in the night-time from the Earth in any part of it’s Orbit,\r\nexcept about _M_, when the Sun hides the Planet from our view. As Saturn\r\ngoes from _G_ to _A_ his ring turns more and more edgewise to us, and\r\ntherefore it seems to grow narrower and narrower; and at _A_ it\r\ndisappears as before. Hence, while Saturn goes from _A_ to _E_ the Sun\r\nshines on the upper side of his ring, and the under side is dark; but\r\nwhilst he goes from _E_ to _A_ the Sun shines on the under side of his\r\nring, and the upper side is dark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I and III.]\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be imagined that this Article might have been placed more\r\nproperly after § 81 than here: but when the candid reader considers that\r\nall the various Phenomena of Saturn’s Ring depend upon a cause similar\r\nto that of our Earth’s seasons, he will readily allow that they are best\r\nexplained together; and that the two Figures serve to illustrate each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n           The Earth nearer the Sun in winter than in summer.\r\n\r\n           Why the weather is coldest when the Earth is nearest the Sun.]\r\n\r\n205. The Earth’s Orbit being elliptical, and the Sun constantly keeping\r\nin it’s lower Focus, which is 1,377,000 miles from the middle point of\r\nthe longer Axis, the Earth comes twice so much, or 2,754,000 miles\r\nnearer the Sun at one time of the year than at another: for the Sun\r\nappearing under a larger Angle in our winter than summer, proves that\r\nthe Earth is nearer the Sun in winter, (_see the Note on Art. 185_.) But\r\nhere, this natural question will arise, Why have we not the hottest\r\nweather when the Earth is nearest the Sun? In answer it must be\r\nobserved, that the excentricity of the Earth’s Orbit, or 1 million 377\r\nmiles bears no greater proportion to the Earth’s mean distance from the\r\nSun than 17 does to 1000; and therefore, this small difference of\r\ndistance cannot occasion any great difference of heat or cold. But the\r\nprincipal cause of this difference is, that in winter the Sun’s rays\r\nfall so obliquely upon us, that any given number of them is spread over\r\na much greater portion of the Earth’s surface where we live; and\r\ntherefore each point must then have fewer rays than in summer. Moreover,\r\nthere comes a greater degree of cold in the long winter nights, than\r\nthere can return of heat in so short days; and on both these accounts\r\nthe cold must increase. But in summer the Sun’s rays fall more\r\nperpendicularly upon us, and therefore come with greater force, and in\r\ngreater numbers on the same place; and by their long continuance, a much\r\ngreater degree of heat is imparted by day than can fly off by night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\n206. That a greater number of rays fall on the same place, when they\r\ncome perpendicularly, than when they come obliquely on it, will appear\r\nby the Figure. For, let _AB_ be a certain number of the Sun’s rays\r\nfalling on _CD_ (which, let us suppose to be _London_) on the 22d of\r\n_June_: but, on the 22d of _December_, the line _CD_, or _London_; has\r\nthe oblique position _Cd_ to the same rays; and therefore scarce a third\r\npart of them falls upon it, or only those between _A_ and _e_; all the\r\nrest _eB_ being expended on the space _dP_, which is more than double\r\nthe length of _CD_ or _Cd_. Besides, those parts which are once heated,\r\nretain the heat for some time; which, with the additional heat daily\r\nimparted, makes it continue to increase, though the Sun declines toward\r\nthe south: and this is the reason why _July_ is hotter than _June_,\r\nalthough the Sun has withdrawn from the summer Tropic; as we find it is\r\ngenerally hotter at three in the afternoon, when the Sun has gone toward\r\nthe west, than at noon when he is on the Meridian. Likewise, those\r\nplaces which are well cooled require time to be heated again; for the\r\nSun’s rays do not heat even the surface of any body till they have been\r\nsome time upon it. And therefore we find _January_ for the most part\r\ncolder than _December_, although the Sun has withdrawn from the winter\r\nTropic, and begins to dart his beams more perpendicularly upon us, when\r\nwe have the position _CF_. An iron bar is not heated immediately upon\r\nbeing put into the fire, nor grows cold till some time after it has been\r\ntaken out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

Geographers arbitrarily choose to call the Meridian of some\r\nremarkable place _the first Meridian_. There they begin their reckoning;\r\nand just so many degrees and minutes as any other place is to the\r\neastward or westward of that Meridian, so much east or west Longitude\r\nthey say it has. A degree is the 360th part of a Circle, be it great or\r\nsmall; and a minute the 60th part of a degree. The _English_ Geographers\r\nreckon the Longitude from the Meridian of the Royal Observatory at\r\n_Greenwich_, and the _French_ from the Meridian of _Paris_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE V.\r\n\r\n           Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           Hour Circles.\r\n\r\n           An hour of time equal to 15 degrees of motion.]\r\n\r\n208. If we imagine twelve great Circles, one of which is the Meridian of\r\nany given place, to intersect each other in the two Poles of the Earth,\r\nand to cut the Equator _Æ_ at every 15th degree, they will be divided by\r\nthe Poles into 24 Semicircles which divide the Equator into 24 equal\r\nparts; and as the Earth turns on it’s Axis, the planes of these\r\nSemicircles come successively after one another every hour to the Sun.\r\nAs in an hour of time there is a revolution of 15 degrees of the\r\nEquator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of 15 minutes of\r\nthe Equator, and in a second of time a revolution of 15 seconds. There\r\nare two tables annexed to this Chapter, for reducing mean solar time\r\ninto degrees and minutes of the terrestrial Equator; and also for\r\nconverting degrees and parts of the Equator into mean solar time.\r\n\r\n209. Because the Sun enlightens only one half of the Earth at once, as\r\nit turns round it’s Axis he rises to some places at the same moments of\r\nabsolute Time that he sets to others; and when it is mid-day to some\r\nplaces, it is mid-night to others. The XII on the middle of the Earth’s\r\nenlightened side, next the Sun, stands for mid-day; and the opposite XII\r\non the middle of the dark side, for mid-night. If we suppose this Circle\r\nof hours to be fixed in the plane of the Equinoctial, and the Earth to\r\nturn round within it, any particular Meridian will come to the different\r\nhours so, as to shew the true time of the day or night at all places on\r\nthat Meridian. Therefore,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And consequently to 15 degrees of Longitude.\r\n\r\n           Lunar Eclipses useful in finding the Longitude.]\r\n\r\n210. To every place 15 degrees eastward from any given Meridian, it is\r\nnoon an hour sooner than on that Meridian; because their Meridian comes\r\nto the Sun an hour sooner: and to all places 15 degrees westward it is\r\nnoon an hour later § 208, because their Meridian comes an hour later to\r\nthe Sun; and so on: every 15 degrees of motion causing an hour’s\r\ndifference in time. Therefore they who have noon an hour later than we,\r\nhave their Meridian, that is, their Longitude 15 degrees westward from\r\nus; and they who have noon an hour sooner than we, have their Meridian\r\n15 degrees eastward from ours: and so for every hour’s difference of\r\ntime 15 degrees difference of Longitude. Consequently, if the beginning\r\nor ending of a Lunar Eclipse be observed, suppose at _London_, to be\r\nexactly at mid-night, and in some other place at 11 at night, that place\r\nis 15 degrees westward from the Meridian of _London_: if the same\r\nEclipse be observed at one in the morning at another place, that place\r\nis 15 degrees eastward from the said Meridian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites much better for that\r\n           purpose.]\r\n\r\n211. But as it is not easy to determine the exact moment either of the\r\nbeginning or ending of a Lunar Eclipse, because the Earth’s shadow\r\nthrough which the Moon passes is faint and ill defined about the edges;\r\nwe have recourse to the Eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites, which\r\ndisappear so instantaneously as they enter into Jupiter’s shadow, and\r\nemerge so suddenly out of it, that we may fix the phenomenon to half a\r\nsecond of time. The first or nearest Satellite to Jupiter is the most\r\nadvantageous for this purpose, because it’s motion is quicker than the\r\nmotion of any of the rest, and therefore it’s immersions and emersions\r\nare more frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to solve this important problem.\r\n\r\n           PLATE V.]\r\n\r\n212. The _English_ Astronomers have made Tables for shewing the times of\r\nthe Eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites to great precision, for the\r\nMeridian of _Greenwich_. Now, let an observer, who has these Tables with\r\na good Telescope and a well-regulated Clock at any other place of the\r\nEarth, observe the beginning or ending of an Eclipse of one of Jupiter’s\r\nSatellites, and note the precise moment of time that he saw the\r\nSatellite either immerge into, or emerge out of the shadow, and compare\r\nthat time with the time shewn by the Tables for _Greenwich_; then, 15\r\ndegrees difference of Longitude being allowed for every hour’s\r\ndifference of time, will give the Longitude of that place from\r\n_Greenwich_, as above § 210; and if there be any odd minutes of time,\r\nfor every minute a quarter of a degree, east or west must be allowed, as\r\nthe time of observation is before or after the time shewn by the Tables.\r\nSuch Eclipses are very convenient for this purpose at land, because they\r\nhappen almost every day; but are of no use at sea, because the rolling\r\nof the ship hinders all nice telescopical observations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           Illustrated by an example.]\r\n\r\n213. To explain this by a Figure, let _J_ be Jupiter, _K_, _L_, _M_, _N_\r\nhis four Satellites in their respective Orbits 1, 2, 3, 4; and let the\r\nEarth be at _f_ (suppose in _November_, although that month is no\r\notherways material than to find the Earth readily in this scheme, where\r\nit is shewn in eight different parts of it’s Orbit.) Let _Q_ be a place\r\non the Meridian of _Greenwich_, and _R_ a place on some other Meridian.\r\nLet a person at _R_ observe the instantaneous vanishing of the first\r\nSatellite _K_ into Jupiter’s shadow, suppose at three o’clock in the\r\nmorning; but by the Tables he finds the immersion of that Satellite to\r\nbe at midnight at _Greenwich_: he can then immediately determine, that\r\nas there are three hours difference of time between _Q_ and _R_, and\r\nthat _R_ is three hours forwarder in reckoning than _Q_, it must be 45\r\ndegrees of east Longitude from the Meridian of _Q_. Were this method as\r\npracticable at sea as at land, any sailor might almost as easily, and\r\nwith equal certainty, find the Longitude as the Latitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           We seldom see the beginning and end of the same Eclipse of\r\n           any of Jupiter’s Moons.]\r\n\r\n214. Whilst the Earth is going from _C_ to _F_ in it’s Orbit, only the\r\nimmersions of Jupiter’s Satellites into his shadow are generally seen;\r\nand their emersions out of it while the Earth goes from _G_ to _B_.\r\nIndeed, both these appearances may be seen of the second, third, and\r\nfourth Satellite when eclipsed, whilst the Earth is between _D_ and _E_,\r\nor between _G_ and _A_; but never of the first Satellite, on account of\r\nthe smallness of it’s Orbit and the bulk of Jupiter; except only when\r\nJupiter is directly opposite to the Sun; that is, when the Earth is at\r\n_g_: and even then, strictly speaking, we cannot see either the\r\nimmersions or emersions of any of his Satellites, because his body being\r\ndirectly between us and his conical shadow, his Satellites are hid by\r\nhis body a few moments before they touch his shadow; and are quite\r\nemerged from thence before we can see them, as it were, just dropping\r\nfrom him. And when the Earth is at _c_, the Sun being between it and\r\nJupiter hides both him and his Moons from us.\r\n\r\nIn this Diagram, the Orbits of Jupiter’s Moons are drawn in true\r\nproportion to his diameter; but, in proportion to the Earth’s Orbit they\r\nare drawn 81 times too large.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n           Jupiter’s conjunctions with the Sun, or oppositions to him,\r\n           are every year in different parts of the Heavens.]\r\n\r\n215. In whatever month of the year Jupiter is in conjunction with the\r\nSun, or in opposition to him, in the next year it will be a month later\r\nat least. For whilst the Earth goes once round the Sun, Jupiter\r\ndescribes a twelfth part of his Orbit. And therefore, when the Earth has\r\nfinished it’s annual period from being in a line with the Sun and\r\nJupiter, it must go as much forwarder as Jupiter has moved in that time,\r\nto overtake him again: just like the minute hand of a watch, which must,\r\nfrom any conjunction with the hour hand, go once round the dial-plate\r\nand somewhat above a twelfth part more, to overtake the hour hand again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The surprising velocity of light.]\r\n\r\n216. It is found by observation, that when the Earth is between the Sun\r\nand Jupiter, as at _g_, his Satellites are eclipsed about 8 minutes\r\nsooner than they should be according to the Tables: and when the Earth\r\nis at _B_ or _C_, these Eclipses happen about 8 minutes later than the\r\nTables predict them. Hence it is undeniably certain, that the motion of\r\nlight is not instantaneous, since it takes about 16-1/2 minutes of time\r\nto go through a space equal to the diameter of the Earth’s Orbit, which\r\nis 162 millions of miles in length: and consequently the particles of\r\nlight fly about 164 thousand 494 miles every second of time, which is\r\nabove a million of times swifter than the motion of a cannon bullet. And\r\nas light is 16-1/2 minutes in travelling across the Earth’s Orbit, it\r\nmust be 8-1/4 minutes in coming from the Sun to us: therefore, if the\r\nSun were annihilated we should see him for 8-1/4 minutes after; and if\r\nhe were again created he would be 8-1/4 minutes old before we could see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.\r\n\r\n           Illustrated by a Figure.]\r\n\r\n217. To illustrate this progressive motion of light, let _A_ and _B_ be\r\nthe Earth in two different parts of it’s Orbit, whose distance is 81\r\nmillions of miles, equal to the Earth’s distance from the Sun _S_. It is\r\nplain, that if the motion of light were instantaneous, the Satellite 1\r\nwould appear to enter into Jupiter’s shadow _FF_ at the same moment of\r\ntime to a spectator in _A_ as to another in _B_. But by many years\r\nobservations it has been found, that the immersion of the Satellite into\r\nthe shadow is seen 8-1/4 minutes sooner when the Earth is at _B_, than\r\nwhen it is at _A_. And so, as Mr. ROMER first discovered, the motion of\r\nlight is thereby proved to be progressive, and not instantaneous, as was\r\nformerly believed. It is easy to compute in what time the Earth moves\r\nfrom _A_ to _B_; for the chord of 60 degrees of any Circle is equal to\r\nthe Semidiameter of that Circle; and as the Earth goes through all the\r\n360 degrees of it’s Orbit in a year, it goes through 60 of those degrees\r\nin about 61 days. Therefore, if on any given day, suppose the first of\r\n_June_, the Earth is at _A_, on the first of _August_ it will be at _B_:\r\nthe chord, or straight line _AB_, being equal to _DS_ the Radius of the\r\nEarth’s Orbit, the same with _AS_ it’s distance from the Sun.\r\n\r\n218. As the Earth moves from _D_ to _C_, through the side _AB_ of it’s\r\nOrbit, it is constantly meeting the light of Jupiter’s Satellites\r\nsooner, which occasions an apparent acceleration of their Eclipses: and\r\nas it moves through the other half _H_ of it’s Orbit, from _C_ to _D_,\r\nit is receding from their light, which occasions an apparent retardation\r\nof their Eclipses, because their light is then longer ere it overtakes\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\n219. That these accelerations of the immersions of Jupiter’s Satellites\r\ninto his shadow, as the Earth approaches towards Jupiter, and the\r\nretardations of their emersions out of his shadow, as the Earth is going\r\nfrom him, are not occasioned by any inequality arising from the motions\r\nof the Satellites in excentric Orbits, is plain, because it affects them\r\nall alike, in whatever parts of their Orbits they are eclipsed. Besides,\r\nthey go often round their Orbits every year, and their motions are no\r\nway commensurate to the Earth’s. Therefore, a Phenomenon not to be\r\naccounted for from the real motions of the Satellites, but so easily\r\ndeducible from the Earth’s motion, and so answerable thereto, must be\r\nallowed to result from it. This affords one very good proof of the\r\nEarth’s annual motion.\r\n\r\n220.

The fixed Stars appear to go round the Earth in 23 hours 56 minutes\r\n4 seconds, and the Sun in 24 hours: so that the Stars gain three minutes\r\n56 seconds upon the Sun every day, which amounts to one diurnal\r\nrevolution in a year; and therefore, in 365 days as measured by the\r\nreturns of the Sun to the Meridian, there are 366 days as measured by\r\nthe Stars returning to it: the former are called _Solar Days_, and the\r\nlatter _Sidereal_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE III.]\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the Earth’s Orbit is but a physical point in proportion\r\nto the distance of the Stars; for which reason, and the Earth’s uniform\r\nmotion on it’s Axis, any given Meridian will revolve from any Star to\r\nthe same Star again in every absolute turn of the Earth on it’s Axis,\r\nwithout the least perceptible difference of time shewn by a clock which\r\ngoes exactly true.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth had only a diurnal motion, without an annual, any given\r\nMeridian would revolve from the Sun to the Sun again in the same\r\nquantity of time as from any Star to the same Star again; because the\r\nSun would never change his place with respect to the Stars. But, as the\r\nEarth advances almost a degree eastward in it’s Orbit in the time that\r\nit turns eastward round its Axis, whatever Star passes over the Meridian\r\non any day with the Sun, will pass over the same Meridian on the next\r\nday when the Sun is almost a degree short of it; that is, 3 minutes 56\r\nseconds sooner. If the year contained only 360 days as the Ecliptic does\r\n360 degrees, the Sun’s apparent place, so far as his motion is equable,\r\nwould change a degree every day; and then the sidereal days would be\r\njust four minutes shorter than the solar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\nLet _ABCDEFGHIKLM_ be the Earth’s Orbit, in which it goes round the Sun\r\nevery year, according to the order of the letters, that is, from west to\r\neast, and turns round it’s Axis the same way from the Sun to the Sun\r\nagain every 24 hours. Let _S_ be the Sun, and _R_ a fixed Star at such\r\nan immense distance that the diameter of the Earth’s Orbit bears no\r\nsensible proportion to that distance. Let _Nm_ be any particular\r\nMeridian of the Earth, and _N_ a given point or place upon that\r\nMeridian. When the Earth is at _A_, the Sun _S_ hides the Star _R_,\r\nwhich would always be hid if the Earth never removed from _A_; and\r\nconsequently, as the Earth turns round it’s Axis, the point _N_ would\r\nalways come round to the Sun and Star at the same time. But when the\r\nEarth has advanced, suppose a twelfth part of it’s Orbit from _A_ to\r\n_B_, it’s motion round it’s Axis will bring the point _N_ a twelfth part\r\nof a day or two hours sooner to the Star than to the Sun; for the Angle\r\n_NBn_ is equal to the Angle _ASB_: and therefore, any Star which comes\r\nto the Meridian at noon with the Sun when the Earth is at _A_, will come\r\nto the Meridian at 10 in the forenoon when the Earth is at _B_. When the\r\nEarth comes to _C_ the point _N_ will have the Star on it’s Meridian at\r\n8 in the morning, or four hours sooner than it comes round to the Sun;\r\nfor it must revolve from _N_ to _n_, before it has the Sun in it’s\r\nMeridian. When the Earth comes to _D_, the point _N_ will have the Star\r\non it’s Meridian at six in the morning, but that point must revolve six\r\nhours more from _N_ to _n_, before it has mid-day by the Sun: for now\r\nthe Angle _ASD_ is a right Angle, and so is _NDn_; that is, the Earth\r\nhas advanced 90 degrees in it’s Orbit, and must turn 90 degrees on its\r\nAxis to carry the point _N_ from the Star to the Sun: for the Star\r\nalways comes to the Meridian when _Nm_ is parallel to _RSA_; because\r\n_DS_ is but a point in respect of _RS_. When the Earth is at _E_, the\r\nStar comes to the Meridian at 4 in the morning; at _F_, at two in the\r\nmorning; and at _G_, the Earth having gone half round it’s Orbit, _N_\r\npoints to the Star _R_ at midnight, being then directly opposite to the\r\nSun; and therefore, by the Earth’s diurnal motion the Star comes to the\r\nMeridian 12 hours before the Sun. When the Earth is at _H_, the Star\r\ncomes to the Meridian at 10 in the evening; at _I_ it comes to the\r\nMeridian at 8, that is, 16 hours before the Sun; at _K_ 18 hours before\r\nhim; at _L_ 20 hours; at _M_ 22; and at _A_ equally with the Sun again.\r\n\r\nA TABLE, shewing how much of the Celestial Equator passes over the\r\n  Meridian in any part of a mean SOLAR DAY; and how much the FIXED STARS\r\n  gain upon the mean SOLAR TIME every Day, for a Month.\r\n\r\n\r\n +-----+-----------+-----+------------+-----+------------+\r\n | Time|  Motion.  | Time|   Motion.  |Time |  Motion.   |\r\n |     |           |     |            |     |            |\r\n +-----+-----------+-----+------------+-----+------------+\r\n |Hours|  D.

Thus it is plain, that an absolute turn of the Earth on it’s Axis\r\n(which is always completed when the same Meridian comes to be parallel\r\nto it’s situation at any time of the day before) never brings the same\r\nMeridian round from the Sun to the Sun again; but that the Earth\r\nrequires as much more than one turn on it’s Axis to finish a natural\r\nday, as it has gone forward in that time; which, at a mean state is a\r\n365th part of a Circle. Hence, in 365 days the Earth turns 366 times\r\nround it’s Axis; and therefore, as a turn of the Earth on it’s Axis\r\ncompleats a sidereal day, there must be one sidereal day more in a year\r\nthan the number of solar days, be the number what it will, on the Earth,\r\nor any other Planet. One turn being lost with respect to the number of\r\nsolar days in a year, by the Planet’s going round the Sun; just as it\r\nwould be lost to a traveller, who, in going round the Earth, would lose\r\none day by following the apparent diurnal motion of the Sun: and\r\nconsequently, would reckon one day less at his return (let him take what\r\ntime he would to go round the Earth) than those who remained all the\r\nwhile at the place from which he set out. So, if there were two Earths\r\nrevolving equably on their Axes, and if one remained at _A_ until the\r\nother travelled round the Sun from _A_ to _A_ again, _that_ Earth which\r\nkept it’s place at _A_ would have it’s solar and sidereal days always of\r\nthe same length; and so, would have one solar day more than the other at\r\nit’s return. Hence, if the Earth turned but once round it’s Axis in a\r\nyear, and if _that_ turn was made the same way as the Earth goes round\r\nthe Sun, there would be continual day on one side of the Earth, and\r\ncontinual night on the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To know by the Stars whether a Clock goes true or not.]\r\n\r\n223. The first part of the preceding Table shews how much of the\r\ncelestial Equator passes over the Meridian in any given part of a mean\r\nsolar day, and is to be understood the same way as the Table in the\r\n220th article. The latter part, intitled, _Accelerations of the fixed\r\nStars_, affords us an easy method of knowing whether or no our clocks\r\nand watches go true: For if, through a small hole in a window-shutter,\r\nor in a thin plate of metal fixed to a window, we observe at what time\r\nany Star disappears behind a chimney, or corner of a house, at a little\r\ndistance; and if the same Star disappears the next night 3 minutes 56\r\nseconds sooner by the clock or watch; and on the second night, 7 minutes\r\n52 seconds sooner; the third night 11 minutes 48 seconds sooner; and so\r\non, every night, as in the Table, which shews this difference for 30\r\nnatural days, it is an infallible Sign that the machine goes true;\r\notherwise it does not go true; and must be regulated accordingly: and as\r\nthe disappearing of a Star is instantaneous, we may depend on this\r\ninformation to half a second.

XIII.\r\n\r\n                       _Of the Equation of Time._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun and Clocks equal only on four days of the year.]\r\n\r\n224. The Earth’s motion on it’s Axis being perfectly uniform, and equal\r\nat all times of the year, the sidereal days are always precisely of the\r\nsame length; and so would the solar or natural days be, if the Earth’s\r\norbit were a perfect Circle, and it’s Axis perpendicular to it’s orbit.\r\nBut the Earth’s diurnal motion on an inclined Axis, and it’s annual\r\nmotion in an elliptic orbit, cause the Sun’s apparent motion in the\r\nHeavens to be unequal: for sometimes he revolves from the Meridian to\r\nthe Meridian again in somewhat less than 24 hours, shewn by a well\r\nregulated clock; and at other times in somewhat more: so that the time\r\nshewn by an equal going clock and a true Sun-dial is never the same but\r\non the 15th of _April_, the 16th of _June_, the 31st of _August_, and\r\nthe 24th of _December_. The clock, if it goes equally and true all the\r\nyear round, will be before the Sun from the 24th of _December_ till the\r\n15th of _April_; from that time till the 16th of _June_ the Sun will be\r\nbefore the clock; from the 16th of _June_ till the 31st of _August_ the\r\nclock will be again before the Sun; and from thence to the 24th of\r\n_December_ the Sun will be faster than the clock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of the Equation Table.]\r\n\r\n225. The Tables of the Equation of natural days, at the end of the next\r\nChapter, shew the time that ought to be pointed out by a well regulated\r\nclock or watch every day of the year at the precise moment of solar\r\nnoon; that is, when the Sun’s centre is on the Meridian, or when a true\r\nSun-dial shews it to be precisely Twelve. Thus, on the 5th of _January_\r\nin Leap-year, when the Sun is on the Meridian, it ought to be 5 minutes\r\n51 seconds past twelve by the clock; and on the 15th of _May_, when the\r\nSun is on the Meridian, the time by the clock should be but 55 minutes\r\n57 seconds past eleven; in the former case, the clock is 5 minutes 51\r\nseconds beforehand with the Sun; and in the latter case, the Sun is 4\r\nminutes 3 seconds faster than the clock. The column at the right hand of\r\neach month shews the daily difference of this equation, as it increases\r\nor decreases. But without a Meridian Line, or a Transit-Instrument fixed\r\nin the plane of the Meridian, we cannot set a Sun-dial true.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to draw a Meridian Line.]\r\n\r\n226. The easiest and most expeditious way of drawing a Meridian Line is\r\nthis: Make four or five concentric Circles, about a quarter of an inch\r\nfrom one another, on a flat board about a foot in breadth; and let the\r\noutmost Circle be but little less than the board will contain. Fix a pin\r\nperpendicularly in the center, and of such a length that it’s whole\r\nshadow may fall within the innermost Circle for at least four hours in\r\nthe middle of the day. The pin ought to be about an eighth part of an\r\ninch thick, with a round blunt point. The board being set exactly level\r\nin a place where the Sun shines, suppose from eight in the morning till\r\nfour in the afternoon, about which hours the end of the shadow should\r\nfall without all the Circles; watch the times in the forenoon, when the\r\nextremity of the shortening shadow just touches the several Circles, and\r\n_there_ make marks. Then, in the afternoon of the same day, watch the\r\nlengthening shadow, and where it’s end touches the several Circles in\r\ngoing over them, make marks also. Lastly, with a pair of compasses, find\r\nexactly the middle point between the two marks on any Circle, and draw a\r\nstraight line from the center to that point; which Line will be covered\r\nat noon by the shadow of a small upright wire, which should be put in\r\nthe place of the pin. The reason for drawing several Circles is, that in\r\ncase one part of the day should prove clear, and the other part somewhat\r\ncloudy, if you miss the time when the point of the shadow should touch\r\none Circle, you may perhaps catch it in touching another. The best time\r\nfor drawing a Meridian Line in this manner is about the middle of\r\nsummer; because the Sun changes his Declination slowest and his Altitude\r\nfastest in the longest days.\r\n\r\nIf the casement of a window on which the Sun shines at noon be quite\r\nupright, you may draw a line along the edge of it’s shadow on the floor,\r\nwhen the shadow of the pin is exactly on the Meridian Line of the board:\r\nand as the motion of the shadow of the casement will be much more\r\nsensible on the Floor, than that of the shadow of the pin on the board,\r\nyou may know to a few seconds when it touches the Meridian Line on the\r\nfloor, and so regulate your clock for the day of observation by that\r\nline and the Equation Tables above-mentioned § 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Equation of natural days explained.]\r\n\r\n227. As the Equation of time, or difference between the time shewn by a\r\nwell regulated Clock and a true Sun-dial, depends upon two causes,\r\nnamely, the obliquity of the Ecliptic, and the unequal motion of the\r\nEarth in it, we shall first explain the effects of these causes\r\nseparately considered, and then the united effects resulting from their\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n           The first part of the Equation of time.]\r\n\r\n228. The Earth’s motion on it’s Axis being perfectly equable, or always\r\nat the same rate, and the [55]plane of the Equator being perpendicular\r\nto it’s Axis, ’tis evident that in equal times equal portions of the\r\nEquator pass over the Meridian; and so would equal portions of the\r\nEcliptic if it were parallel to or coincident with the Equator. But, as\r\nthe Ecliptic is oblique to the Equator, the equable motion of the Earth\r\ncarries unequal portions of the Ecliptic over the Meridian in equal\r\ntimes, the difference being proportionate to the obliquity; and as some\r\nparts of the Ecliptic are much more oblique than others, those\r\ndifferences are unequal among themselves. Therefore, if two Suns should\r\nstart either from the beginning of Aries or Libra, and continue to move\r\nthrough equal arcs in equal times, one in the Equator, and the other in\r\nthe Ecliptic, the equatoreal Sun would always return to the Meridian in\r\n24 hours time, as measured by a well regulated clock; but the Sun in the\r\nEcliptic would return to the Meridian sometimes sooner, and sometimes\r\nlater than the equatoreal Sun; and only at the same moments with him on\r\nfour days of the year; namely, the 20th of _March_, when the Sun enters\r\nAries; the 21st of _June_, when he enters Cancer; the 23d of\r\n_September_, when he enters Libra; and the 21st of _December_, when he\r\nenters Capricorn. But, as there is only one Sun, and his apparent motion\r\nis always in the Ecliptic, let us henceforth call him the real Sun, and\r\nthe other which is supposed to move in the Equator the fictitious; to\r\nwhich last, the motion of a well regulated clock always answers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nLet _Z_♈_z_♎ be the Earth, _ZFRz_ it’s Axis, _abcde_ &c. the Equator,\r\n_ABCDE_ &c. the northern half of the Ecliptic from ♈ to ♎ on the side of\r\nthe Globe next the eye, and _MNOP_ &c. the southern half on the opposite\r\nside from ♎ to ♈. Let the points at _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, _E_, _F_, &c.\r\nquite round from ♈ to ♈ again bound equal portions of the Ecliptic, gone\r\nthrough in equal times by the real Sun; and those at _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_,\r\n_e_, _f_, &c. equal portions of the Equator described in equal times by\r\nthe fictitious Sun; and let _Z_♈_z_ be the Meridian.\r\n\r\nAs the real Sun moves obliquely in the Ecliptic, and the fictitious Sun\r\ndirectly in the Equator, with respect to the Meridian, a degree, or any\r\nnumber of degrees, between ♈ and _F_ on the Ecliptic, must be nearer the\r\nMeridian _Z_♈_z_, than a degree, or any corresponding number of degrees\r\non the Equator from ♈ to _f_; and the more so, as they are the more\r\noblique: and therefore the true Sun comes sooner to the Meridian whilst\r\nhe is in the quadrant ♈ _F_, than the fictitious Sun does in the\r\nquadrant ♈ _f_; for which reason, the solar noon precedes noon by the\r\nClock, until the real Sun comes to _F_, and the fictitious to _f_; which\r\ntwo points, being equidistant from the Meridian, both Suns will come to\r\nit precisely at noon by the Clock.\r\n\r\nWhilst the real Sun describes the second quadrant of the Ecliptic\r\n_FGHIKL_ from ♋ to ♎; he comes later to the Meridian every day, than the\r\nfictitious Sun moving through the second quadrant of the Equator from\r\n_f_ to ♎; for the points at _G_, _H_, _I_, _K_, and _L_ being farther\r\nfrom the Meridian than their corresponding points at _g_, _h_, _i_, _k_,\r\nand _l_, they must be later of coming to it: and as both Suns come at\r\nthe same moment to the point ♎, they come to the Meridian at the moment\r\nof noon by the Clock.\r\n\r\nIn departing from Libra, through the third quadrant, the real Sun going\r\nthrough _MNOPQ_ towards ♑ at _R_, and the fictitious Sun through _mnopq_\r\ntowards _r_, the former comes to the Meridian every day sooner than the\r\nlatter, until the real Sun comes to ♑, and the fictitious to _r_, and\r\nthen they both come to the Meridian at the same time.\r\n\r\nLastly, as the real Sun moves equably through _STUVW_, from ♑ towards ♈;\r\nand the fictitious Sun through _stuvw_, from _r_ towards ♈, the former\r\ncomes later every day to the Meridian than the latter, until they both\r\narrive at the point ♈, and then they make noon at the same time with the\r\nclock.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Table of the Equation of Time depending on the Sun’s place\r\n           in the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n           PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\n229. The annexed Table shews how much the Sun is faster or slower than\r\nthe clock ought to be, so far as the difference depends upon the\r\nobliquity of the Ecliptic; of which the Signs of the first and third\r\nquadrants are at the head of the Table, and their Degrees at the left\r\nhand; and in these the Sun is faster than the Clock: the Signs of the\r\nsecond and fourth quadrants are at the foot of the Table, and their\r\ndegrees at the right hand; in all which the Sun is slower than the\r\nClock: so that entering the Table with the given Sign of the Sun’s place\r\nat the head of the Table, and the Degree of his place in that Sign at\r\nthe left hand; or with the given Sign at the foot of the Table, and\r\nDegree at the right hand; in the Angle of meeting is the number of\r\nminutes and seconds that the Sun is faster or slower than the clock: or\r\nin other words, the quantity of time in which the real Sun, when in that\r\npart of the Ecliptic, comes sooner or later to the Meridian than the\r\nfictitious Sun in the Equator. Thus, when the Sun’s place is ♉ Taurus 12\r\ndegrees, he is 9 minutes 49 seconds faster than the clock; and when his\r\nplace is ♋ Cancer 18 degrees, he is 6 minutes 2 seconds slower.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------+\r\n |        _Sun faster than the Clock in_       |\r\n +---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |         |    ♈   |    ♉   |    ♊  | 1st Q. |\r\n |         |    ♎   |    ♏   |    ♐  |  3d Q. |\r\n +         +--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n | Degrees |  ʹ  ʺ  |  ʹ  ʺ  |  ʹ  ʺ  |  Deg.  |\r\n +---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |     0   |  0   0 |  8  24 |  8  46 |   30   |\r\n |     1   |  0  20 |  8  35 |  8  36 |   29   |\r\n |     2   |  0  40 |  8  45 |  8  25 |   28   |\r\n |     3   |  1   0 |  8  54 |  8  14 |   27   |\r\n |     4   |  1  19 |  9   3 |  8   1 |   26   |\r\n |     5   |  1  39 |  9  11 |  7  49 |   25   |\r\n |     6   |  1  59 |  9  18 |  7  35 |   24   |\r\n |     7   |  2  18 |  9  24 |  7  21 |   23   |\r\n |     8   |  2  37 |  9  31 |  7   6 |   22   |\r\n |     9   |  2  56 |  9  36 |  6  51 |   21   |\r\n |    10   |  3  16 |  9  41 |  6  35 |   20   |\r\n |    11   |  3  34 |  9  45 |  6  19 |   19   |\r\n |    12   |  3  53 |  9  49 |  6   2 |   18   |\r\n |    13   |  4  11 |  9  51 |  5  45 |   17   |\r\n |    14   |  4  29 |  9  53 |  5  27 |   16   |\r\n |    15   |  4  47 |  9  54 |  5   9 |   15   |\r\n |    16   |  5   4 |  9  55 |  4  50 |   14   |\r\n |    17   |  5  21 |  9  55 |  4  31 |   13   |\r\n |    18   |  5  38 |  9  54 |  4  12 |   12   |\r\n |    19   |  5  54 |  9  52 |  3  52 |   11   |\r\n |    20   |  6  10 |  9  50 |  3  32 |   10   |\r\n |    21   |  6  26 |  9  47 |  3  12 |    9   |\r\n |    22   |  6  41 |  9  43 |  2  51 |    8   |\r\n |    23   |  6  55 |  9  38 |  2  30 |    7   |\r\n |    24   |  7   9 |  9  33 |  2   9 |    6   |\r\n |    25   |  7  23 |  9  27 |  1  48 |    5   |\r\n |    26   |  7  36 |  9  20 |  1  27 |    4   |\r\n |    27   |  7  49 |  9  13 |  1   5 |    3   |\r\n |    28   |  8   1 |  9   5 |  0  43 |    2   |\r\n |    29   |  8  13 |  8  56 |  0  22 |    1   |\r\n |    30   |  8  24 |  8  46 |  0   0 |    0   |\r\n +---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |  2d Q.  |    ♍   |    ♌   |    ♋   |  Deg. |\r\n | 4th Q.  |    ♓   |    ♒   |    ♑   |       |\r\n +---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |        _Sun slower than the Clock in_       |\r\n +---------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n230. This part of the Equation of time may perhaps be somewhat difficult\r\nto understand by a Figure, because both halves of the Ecliptic seem to\r\nbe on the same side of the Globe; but it may be made very easy to any\r\nperson who has a real Globe before him, by putting small patches on\r\nevery tenth or fifteenth degree both of the Equator and Ecliptic; and\r\nthen, turning the ball slowly round westward, he will see all the\r\npatches from Aries to Cancer come to the brazen Meridian sooner than the\r\ncorresponding patches on the Equator; all those from Cancer to Libra\r\nwill come later to the Meridian than their corresponding patches on the\r\nEquator; those from Libra to Capricorn sooner, and those from Capricorn\r\nto Aries later: and the patches at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer,\r\nLibra, and Capricorn, being also on the Equator, shew that the two Suns\r\nmeet there, and come to the Meridian together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A machine for shewing the sidereal, the equal, and the solar\r\n           Time.\r\n\r\n           PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\n231. Let us suppose that there are two little balls moving equably round\r\na celestial Globe by clock-work, one always keeping in the Ecliptic, and\r\ngilt with gold, to represent the real Sun; and the other keeping in the\r\nEquator, and silvered, to represent the fictitious Sun: and that whilst\r\nthese balls move once, round the Globe according to the order of Signs,\r\nthe Clock turns the Globe 366 times round it’s Axis westward. The Stars\r\nwill make 366 diurnal revolutions from the brasen Meridian to it again;\r\nand the two balls representing the real and fictitious Sun always going\r\nfarther eastward from any given Star, will come later than it to the\r\nMeridian every following day; and each ball will make 365 revolutions to\r\nthe Meridian; coming equally to it at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer,\r\nLibra, and Capricorn: but in every other point of the Ecliptic, the gilt\r\nball will come either sooner or later to the Meridian than the silvered\r\nball, like the patches above-mentioned. This would be a pretty-enough\r\nway of shewing the reason why any given Star, which, on a certain day of\r\nthe year, comes to the Meridian with the Sun, passes over it so much\r\nsooner every following day, as on that day twelvemonth to come to the\r\nMeridian with the Sun again; and also to shew the reason why the real\r\nSun comes to the Meridian sometimes sooner, sometimes later, than it is\r\nnoon by the clock; and, on four days of the year, at the same time;\r\nwhilst the fictitious Sun always comes to the Meridian when it is twelve\r\nat noon by the clock. This would be no difficult task for an artist to\r\nperform; for the gold ball might be carried round the Ecliptic by a wire\r\nfrom it’s north Pole, and the silver ball round the Equator by a wire\r\nfrom it’s south Pole, with a few wheels to each; which might be easily\r\nadded to my improvement of the celestial Globe, described in N^o 483 of\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_; and of which I shall give a\r\ndescription in the latter part of this Book, from the 3d Figure of the\r\n3d plate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n232. ’Tis plain that if the Ecliptic were more obliquely posited to the\r\nEquator, as the dotted Circle ♈_x_♎, the equal divisions from ♈ to _x_\r\nwould come still sooner to the Meridian _Z0_♈ than those marked _A_,\r\n_B_, _C_, _D_, and _E_ do: for two divisions containing 30 degrees, from\r\n♈ to the second dott, a little short of the figure 1, come sooner to the\r\nMeridian than one division containing only 15 degrees from ♈ to _A_\r\ndoes, as the Ecliptic now stands; and those of the second quadrant from\r\n_x_ to ♎ would be so much later. The third quadrant would be as the\r\nfirst, and the fourth as the second. And it is likewise plain, that\r\nwhere the Ecliptic is most oblique, namely about Aries and Libra, the\r\ndifference would be greatest: and least about Cancer and Capricorn,\r\nwhere the obliquity is least.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second part of the Equation of Time.\r\n\r\n           PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\n234. Having explained one cause of the difference of time shewn by a\r\nwell-regulated Clock and a true Sun-dial; and considered the Sun, not\r\nthe Earth, as moving in the Ecliptic; we now proceed to explain the\r\nother cause of this difference, namely, the inequality of the Sun’s\r\napparent motion § 205, which is slowest in summer, when the Sun is\r\nfarthest from the Earth, and swiftest in winter when he is nearest to\r\nit. But the Earth’s motion on it’s Axis is equable all the year round,\r\nand is performed from west to east; which is the way that the Sun\r\nappears to change his place in the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n235. If the Sun’s motion were equable in the Ecliptic, the whole\r\ndifference between the equal time as shewn by a Clock, and the unequal\r\ntime as shewn by the Sun, would arise from the obliquity of the\r\nEcliptic. But the Sun’s motion sometimes exceeds a degree in 24 hours,\r\nthough generally it is less: and when his motion is slowest any\r\nparticular Meridian will revolve sooner to him than when his motion is\r\nquickest; for it will overtake him in less time when he advances a less\r\nspace than when he moves through a larger.\r\n\r\n236. Now, if there were two Suns moving in the plane of the Ecliptic, so\r\nas to go round it in a year; the one describing an equal arc every 24\r\nhours, and the other describing sometimes a less arc in 24 hours, and at\r\nother times a larger; gaining at one time of the year what it lost at\r\nthe opposite; ’tis evident that either of these Suns would come sooner\r\nor later to the Meridian than the other as it happened to be behind or\r\nbefore the other: and when they were both in conjunction they would come\r\nto the Meridian at the same moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\n237. As the real Sun moves unequably in the Ecliptic, let us suppose a\r\nfictitious Sun to move equably in it. Let _ABCD_ be the Ecliptic or\r\nOrbit in which the real Sun moves, and the dotted Circle _abcd_ the\r\nimaginary Orbit of the fictitious Sun; each going round in a year\r\naccording to the order of letters, or from west to east. Let _HIKL_ be\r\nthe Earth turning round it’s Axis the same way every 24 hours; and\r\nsuppose both Suns to start from _A_ and _a_, in a right line with the\r\nplane of the Meridian _EH_, at the same moment: the real Sun at _A_,\r\nbeing then at his greatest distance from the Earth, at which time his\r\nmotion is slowest; and the fictitious Sun at _a_, whose motion is always\r\nequable because his distance from the Earth is supposed to be always the\r\nsame. In the time that the Meridian revolves from _H_ to _H_ again,\r\naccording to the order of the letters _HIKL_, the real Sun has moved\r\nfrom _A_ to _F_; and the fictitious with a quicker motion from _a_ to\r\n_f_, through a larger arc: therefore, the Meridian _EH_ will revolve\r\nsooner from _H_ to _h_ under the real Sun at _F_, than from _H_ to _k_\r\nunder the fictitious Sun at _f_; and consequently it will be noon by the\r\nSun-dial sooner than by the Clock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\nAs the real Sun moves from _A_ towards _C_, the swiftness of his motion\r\nincreases all the way to _C_, where it is at the quickest. But\r\nnotwithstanding this, the fictitious Sun gains so much upon the real,\r\nsoon after his departing from _A_, that the increasing velocity of the\r\nreal Sun does not bring him up with the equally moving fictitious Sun\r\ntill the former comes to _C_, and the latter to _c_, when each has gone\r\nhalf round it’s respective orbit; and then being in conjunction, the\r\nMeridian _EH_ revolving to _EK_ comes to both Suns at the same time, and\r\ntherefore it is noon by them both at the same moment.\r\n\r\nBut the increased velocity of the real Sun, now being at the quickest,\r\ncarries him before the fictitious; and therefore, the same Meridian will\r\ncome to the fictitious Sun sooner than to the real: for whilst the\r\nfictitious Sun moves from _c_ to _g_, the real Sun moves through a\r\ngreater arc from _C_ to _G_: consequently the point _K_ has it’s\r\nfictitious noon when it comes to _k_, but not it’s real noon till it\r\ncomes to _l_. And although the velocity of the real Sun diminishes all\r\nthe way from _C_ to _A_, and the fictitious Sun by an equable motion is\r\nstill coming nearer to the real Sun, yet they are not in conjunction\r\ntill the one comes to _A_ and the other to _a_; and then it is noon by\r\nthem both at the same moment.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it appears, that the real noon by the Sun is always later than\r\nthe fictitious noon by the clock whilst the Sun goes from _C_ to _A_,\r\nsooner whilst he goes from _A_ to _C_, and at these two points the Sun\r\nand Clock being equal, it is noon by them both at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apogee, Perigee, and Apsides, what.\r\n\r\n           Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\n238. The point _A_ is called _the Sun’s Apogee_, because when he is\r\nthere he is at his greatest distance from the Earth; the point _C_ his\r\n_Perigee_, because when in it he is at his least distance from the\r\nEarth: and a right line, as _AEC_, drawn through the Earth’s center,\r\nfrom one of these points to the other, is called _the line of the\r\nApsides_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mean Anomaly, what.]\r\n\r\n239. The distance that the Sun has gone in any time from his Apogee (not\r\nthe distance he has to go to it though ever so little) is called _his\r\nmean Anomaly_, and is reckoned in Signs and Degrees, allowing 30 Degrees\r\nto a Sign. Thus, when the Sun has gone suppose 174 degrees from his\r\nApogee at _A_, he is said to be 5 Signs 24 Degrees from it, which is his\r\nmean Anomaly: and when he is gone suppose 355 degrees from his Apogee,\r\nhe is said to be 11 Signs 25 Degrees from it, although he be but 5\r\nDegrees short of _A_ in coming round to it again.\r\n\r\n240. From what was said above it appears, that when the Sun’s Anomaly is\r\nless than 6 Signs, that is, when he is any where between _A_ and _C_, in\r\nthe half _ABC_ of his orbit, the true noon precedes the fictitious; but\r\nwhen his Anomaly is more than 6 Signs, that is, when he is any where\r\nbetween _C_ and _A_, in the half _CDA_ of his Orbit, the fictitious noon\r\nprecedes the true. When his Anomaly is 0 Signs 0 Degrees, that is, when\r\nhe is in his Apogee at _A_; or 6 Signs 0 Degrees, which is when he is in\r\nhis Perigee at _C_; he comes to the Meridian at the moment that the\r\nfictitious Sun does, and then it is noon by them both at the same\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |      _Sun faster than the Clock if his Anomaly be_       |\r\n +----+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----+\r\n |    |0 Signs |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |    |\r\n | D. +--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+    |\r\n |    | ʹ  ʺ  | ʹ  ʺ | ʹ  ʺ | ʹ  ʺ | ʹ  ʺ | ʹ  ʺ |    |\r\n +----+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----+\r\n |  0 | 0   0  | 3  48 | 6  39 | 7  45 | 6  47 | 3  57 | 30 |\r\n |  1 | 0   8  | 3  55 | 6  43 | 7  45 | 6  43 | 3  50 | 29 |\r\n |  2 | 0  16  | 3   2 | 6  47 | 7  45 | 6  39 | 3  43 | 28 |\r\n |  3 | 0  24  | 4   9 | 6  51 | 7  45 | 6  35 | 3  35 | 27 |\r\n |  4 | 0  32  | 4  16 | 6  54 | 7  45 | 6  30 | 3  28 | 26 |\r\n |  5 | 0  40  | 4  22 | 6  58 | 7  44 | 6  26 | 3  20 | 25 |\r\n |  6 | 0  48  | 4  29 | 7   1 | 7  44 | 6  21 | 3  13 | 24 |\r\n |  7 | 0  56  | 4  35 | 7   5 | 7  43 | 6  16 | 3   5 | 23 |\r\n |  8 | 1   3  | 4  42 | 7   8 | 7  42 | 6  11 | 2  58 | 22 |\r\n |  9 | 1  11  | 4  48 | 7  11 | 7  41 | 6   6 | 2  50 | 21 |\r\n | 10 | 1  19  | 4  54 | 7  14 | 7  40 | 6   1 | 2  42 | 20 |\r\n | 11 | 1  27  | 5   0 | 7  17 | 7  38 | 5  56 | 2  35 | 19 |\r\n | 12 | 1  35  | 5   6 | 7  20 | 7  37 | 5  51 | 2  27 | 18 |\r\n | 13 | 1  43  | 5  12 | 7  22 | 7  35 | 5  45 | 2  19 | 17 |\r\n | 14 | 1  50  | 5  18 | 7  25 | 7  34 | 5  40 | 2  11 | 16 |\r\n | 15 | 1  58  | 5  24 | 7  27 | 7  32 | 5  34 | 2   3 | 15 |\r\n | 16 | 2   6  | 5  30 | 7  29 | 7  30 | 5  28 | 1  55 | 14 |\r\n | 17 | 2  13  | 5  35 | 7  31 | 7  28 | 5  22 | 1  47 | 13 |\r\n | 18 | 2  21  | 5  41 | 7  33 | 7  25 | 5  16 | 1  39 | 12 |\r\n | 19 | 2  28  | 5  46 | 7  35 | 7  23 | 5  10 | 1  31 | 11 |\r\n | 20 | 2  36  | 5  52 | 7  36 | 7  20 | 5   4 | 1  22 | 10 |\r\n | 21 | 2  43  | 5  57 | 7  38 | 7  18 | 4  58 | 1  14 |  9 |\r\n | 22 | 2  51  | 6   2 | 7  39 | 7  15 | 4  51 | 1   6 |  8 |\r\n | 23 | 2  58  | 6   7 | 7  41 | 7  12 | 4  45 | 0  58 |  7 |\r\n | 24 | 3   6  | 6  12 | 7  42 | 7   9 | 4  38 | 0  50 |  6 |\r\n | 25 | 3  13  | 6  16 | 7  43 | 7   5 | 4  31 | 0  41 |  5 |\r\n | 26 | 3  20  | 6  21 | 7  43 | 7   2 | 4  25 | 0  33 |  4 |\r\n | 27 | 3  27  | 6  26 | 7  44 | 6  58 | 4  18 | 0  25 |  3 |\r\n | 28 | 3  34  | 6  30 | 7  44 | 6  55 | 4  11 | 0  17 |  2 |\r\n | 29 | 3  41  | 6  34 | 7  45 | 6  51 | 4   4 | 0   8 |  1 |\r\n | 30 | 3  48  | 6  39 | 7  45 | 6  47 | 3  57 | 0   0 |  0 |\r\n +----+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----+\r\n |    |11 Signs|   10  |   9   |   8   |   7   |   6   | D. |\r\n +----+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----+\r\n |      _Sun slower than the Clock if his Anomaly be_       |\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Table of the Equation of Time, depending on the Sun’s\r\n           Anomaly.]\r\n\r\n241. The annexed Table shews the Variation, or Equation of time\r\ndepending on the Sun’s Anomaly, and arising from his unequal motion in\r\nthe Ecliptic; as the former Table § 229 shews the Variation depending on\r\nthe Sun’s place, and resulting from the obliquity of the Ecliptic: this\r\nis to be understood the same way as the other, namely, that when the\r\nSigns are at the head of the Table, the Degrees are at the left hand;\r\nbut when the Signs are at the foot of the Table the respective Degrees\r\nare at the right hand; and in both cases the Equation is in the Angle of\r\nmeeting. When both the above-mentioned Equations are either faster or\r\nslower, their sum is the absolute Equation of Time; but when the one is\r\nfaster, and the other slower, it is their difference. Thus, suppose the\r\nEquation depending on the Sun’s place, be 6 minutes 41 seconds too slow,\r\nand the Equation depending on the Sun’s Anomaly, be 4 minutes 20 seconds\r\ntoo slow, their Sun is 11 minutes 1 second too slow. But if the one had\r\nbeen 6 minutes 41 seconds too fast, and the other 4 minutes 20 seconds\r\ntoo slow, their difference had been 2 minutes 21 seconds too fast,\r\nbecause the greater quantity is too fast.\r\n\r\n242. The obliquity of the Ecliptic to the Equator, which is the first\r\nmentioned cause of the Equation of Time, would make the Sun and Clocks\r\nagree on four days of the year; which are, when the Sun enters Aries,\r\nCancer, Libra, and Capricorn: but the other cause, now explained, would\r\nmake the Sun and Clocks equal only twice in a year; that is, when the\r\nSun is in his Apogee and Perigee. Consequently, when these two points\r\nfall in the beginnings of Cancer and Capricorn, or of Aries and Libra,\r\nthey concur in making the Sun and Clocks equal in these points. But the\r\nApogee at present is in the 9th degree of Cancer, and the Perigee in the\r\n9th degree of Capricorn; and therefore the Sun and Clocks cannot be\r\nequal about the beginning of these Signs, nor at any time of the year,\r\nexcept when the swiftness or slowness of Equation resulting from one\r\ncause just balances the slowness or swiftness arising from the other.\r\n\r\n243. The last Table but one, at the end of this Chapter, shews the Sun’s\r\nplace in the Ecliptic at the noon of every day by the clock, for the\r\nsecond year after leap-year; and also the Sun’s Anomaly to the nearest\r\ndegree, neglecting the odd minutes of a degree. Their use is only to\r\nassist in shewing the method of making a general Equation Table from the\r\ntwo fore-mentioned Tables of Equation depending on the Sun’s Place and\r\nAnomaly § 229, 241; concerning which method we shall give a few examples\r\npresently. The following Tables are such as might be made from these\r\ntwo; and shew the absolute Equation of Time resulting from the\r\ncombination of both it’s causes; in which the minutes, as well as\r\ndegrees, both of the Sun’s Place and Anomaly are considered. The use of\r\nthese Tables is already explained, § 225; and they serve for every day\r\nin leap-year, and the first, second, and third years after: For on most\r\nof the same days of all these years the Equation differs, because of the\r\nodd six hours more than the 365 days of which the year consists.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examples for making Equation Tables.]\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE I. On the 15th of _April_ the Sun is in the 25th degree of ♈\r\nAries, and his Anomaly is 9 Signs 15 Degrees; the Equation resulting\r\nfrom the former is 7 minutes 23 seconds of time too fast § 229; and from\r\nthe latter, 7 minutes 27 seconds too slow, § 241; the difference is 4\r\nseconds that the Sun is too slow at the noon of that day; taking it in\r\ngross for the degrees of the Sun’s Place and Anomaly, without making\r\nproportionable allowance for the odd minutes. Hence, at noon the\r\nswiftness of the one Equation balancing so nearly the slowness of the\r\nother, makes the Sun and Clocks equal on some part of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE II. On the 16th of _June_, the Sun is in the 25th degree of ♊\r\nGemini, and his Anomaly is 11 Signs 16 Degrees; the Equation arising\r\nfrom the former is 1 minute 48 seconds too fast; and from the latter 1\r\nminute 50 seconds too slow; which balancing one another at noon to 2\r\nseconds, the Sun and Clocks are again equal on that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE III. On the 31st of _August_ the Sun’s place is 7 degrees 52\r\nminutes of ♍ Virgo (which we shall call the 8th degree, as it is so\r\nnear) and his Anomaly is 2 Signs 0 Degrees; the Equation arising from\r\nthe former is 6 minutes 41 seconds too slow; and from the latter 6\r\nminutes 39 seconds too fast; the difference being only 2 seconds too\r\nslow at noon, and decreasing towards an equality will make the Sun and\r\nClocks equal in the afternoon of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE. IV. On the 23d of _December_ the Sun’s place is 1 degree 41\r\nminutes (call it 2 degrees) of ♑ Capricorn, and his Anomaly is 5 Signs\r\n23 Degrees; the Equation for the former is 43 seconds too slow, and for\r\nthe latter 58 seconds too fast; the difference is 15 seconds too fast at\r\nnoon; which decreasing will come to an equality, and so make the Sun and\r\nClocks equal in the evening of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus we find, that on some part of each of the above-mentioned four\r\ndays, the Sun and Clocks are equal; but if we work examples for all\r\nother days of the year we shall find them different. And,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remark.]\r\n\r\n244. On those days which are equidistant from any Equinox or Solstice,\r\nwe do not find that the Equation is as much too fast or too slow, on the\r\none side, as it is too slow or too fast on the other. The reason is,\r\nthat the line of the Apsides § 238, does not, at present, fall either\r\ninto the Equinoctial or Solsticial points § 242.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason why Equation Tables are but temporary.]\r\n\r\n245. If the line of the Apsides, together with the Equinoctial and\r\nSolsticial points, were immoveable, a general Equation Table might be\r\nmade from the preceding Equation Tables, which would always keep true,\r\nbecause these Tables themselves are permanent. But, with respect to the\r\nfixed Stars, the line of the Apsides moves forwards 12 seconds of a\r\ndegree every year, and the above points 50 seconds backward. So that if\r\nin any given year, the Equinoctial points, and line of the Apsides were\r\ncoincident, in 100 years afterward they would be separated 1 degree 43\r\nminutes 20 seconds; and consequently in 5225.8 years they would be\r\nseparated 90 degrees, and could not meet again, so that the same\r\nEquinoctial point should fall again into the Apogee in less than 20,903\r\nyears: and this is the shortest Period in which the Equation of Time can\r\nbe restored to the same state again, with respect to the same seasons of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n                 _Of the Precession of the Equinoxes._\r\n\r\n\r\n246. It has been already observed, § 116, that by the Earth’s motion on\r\nit’s Axis, there is more matter accumulated all round the equatoreal\r\nparts than any where else on the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Sun and Moon, by attracting this redundancy of matter, bring the\r\nEquator sooner under them in every return towards it than if there was\r\nno such accumulation. Therefore, if the Sun sets out, as from any Star,\r\nor other fixed point in the Heavens, the moment he is departing from the\r\nEquinoctial or either Tropic, he will come to the same again before he\r\ncompleats his annual course, so as to arrive at the same fixed Star or\r\nPoint from whence he set out.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sun arrives at the same [56]Equinoctial or Solstitial Point, he\r\nfinishes what we call the _Tropical Year_, which, by long observation,\r\nis found to contain 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 57 seconds: and when he\r\narrives at the same fixed Star again, as seen from the Earth, he\r\ncompleats the _Sidereal Year_; which is found to contain 365 days 6\r\nhours 9 minutes 14-1/2 seconds. The _Sidereal Year_ is therefore 20\r\nminutes 17-1/2 seconds longer than the Solar or Tropical year, and 9\r\nminutes 14-1/2 seconds longer than the Julian or Civil year, which we\r\nstate at 365 days 6 hours: so that the Civil year is almost a mean\r\nbetwixt the Sidereal and Tropical.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE VI.]\r\n\r\n247. As the Sun describes the whole Ecliptic, or 360 degrees, in a\r\nTropical year, he moves 59ʹ 8ʺ of a degree every day; and consequently\r\n50ʺ of a degree in 20 minutes 17-1/2 seconds of time: therefore, he will\r\narrive at the same Equinox or Solstice when he is 50ʺ of a degree short\r\nof the same Star or fixed point in the Heavens from which he set out in\r\nthe year before. So that, with respect to the fixed Stars, the Sun and\r\nEquinoctial points fall back (as it were) 30 degrees in 2160 years;\r\nwhich will make the Stars appear to have gone 30 deg. forward, with\r\nrespect to the Signs of the Ecliptic in that time: for the same Signs\r\nalways keep in the same points of the Ecliptic, without regard to the\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |       _A_ TABLE _shewing the Precession of the Equinoctial       |\r\n |           Points in the Heavens, both in Motion and Time;        |\r\n |           and the Anticipation of the Equinoxes on Earth_.       |\r\n +--------+--------------------------------------++-----------------+\r\n |        |     Precession of the Equinoctial    || Anticipation of |\r\n |        |         Points in the Heavens.       ||  the Equinoxes  |\r\n | Julian +----------------+---------------------++  on the Earth.  |\r\n | years. |    Motion.     |      Time.          ||                 |\r\n |        +----------------+---------------------++-----------------+\r\n |        | S.   °   ʹ  ʺ  | Days H.

Then, making 2160 revolutions through the Ecliptic _VWX_, at the\r\nend of so many Sidereal years, he will be found again at _S_: but at the\r\nend of so many Julian years, he will be found at _M_, short of _S_: and\r\nat the end of so many Tropical years, he will be found short of _M_, in\r\nthe 30th deg. of Taurus at _T_, which has receded back from _S_ to _T_\r\nin that time, by the Precession of the Equinoctial points ♈ _Aries_ and\r\n♎ _Libra_. The Arc _ST_ will be equal to the amount of the Precession of\r\nthe Equinox in 2160 years, at the rate of 50ʺ of a degree, or 20 min.\r\n17-1/2 sec. of time, annually: this, in so many years, makes 30 days,\r\n10-1/2 hours; which is the difference between 2160 Sidereal and Tropical\r\nyears: And the Arc _MT_ will be equal to the space moved through by the\r\nSun in 2160 times 11 min. 3 sec. or 16 days, 13 hours 48 minutes, which\r\nis the difference between 2160 Julian and Tropical years.\r\n\r\n248. From the shifting of the Equinoctial points, and with them all the\r\nSigns of the Ecliptic, it follows that those Stars which in the infancy\r\nof astronomy were in _Aries_ are now got into _Taurus_; those of\r\n_Taurus_ into _Gemini_, &c. Hence likewise it is, that the Stars which\r\nrose or set at any particular season of the year, in the time of HESIOD,\r\nEUDOXUS, VIRGIL, PLINY, &c. by no means answer at this time to their\r\ndescriptions. The preceding table shews the quantity of this shifting\r\nboth in the heavens and on the earth, for any number of years to 25,920;\r\nwhich compleats the grand celestial period: within which any number and\r\nits quantity is easily found; as in the following example, for 5763\r\nyears; which at the Autumnal Equinox, A. D. 1756, is thought to be the\r\nage of the world. So that with regard to the fixed Stars, the\r\nEquinoctial points in the heavens, have receded 2^s 20° 2ʹ 30ʺ since the\r\ncreation; which is as much as the Sun moves in 81^d 5^h 0^m 52^s. And\r\nsince that time, or in 5763 years, the Equinoxes with us have fallen\r\nback 44^d 5^h 21^m 9^s; hence, reckoning from the time of the _Julian_\r\nEquinox, _A. D._ 1756, _viz._ _Sept._ 12th, it appears that the Autumnal\r\nEquinox at the creation was on the 26th of _October_.\r\n\r\n +---------+----------------------------------++----------------+\r\n |         |  Precession of the Equinoctial   || Anticipation   |\r\n |         |     Points in the Heavens.       ||    of the      |\r\n | Julian  +-----------------+----------------+| Equinoxes on   |\r\n | years.  |     Motion.     |     Time.      ||  the Earth.    |\r\n |         +-----------------+----------------++----------------+\r\n |         |  S.   °  ʹ   ʺ  | D.

The anticipation of the Equinoxes, and consequently of the seasons,\r\nis by no means owing to the Precession of the Equinoctial and Solsticial\r\npoints in the Heavens, (which can only affect the apparent motions,\r\nplaces and declinations of the fixed Stars) but to the difference\r\nbetween the Civil and Solar year, which is 11 minutes 3 seconds; the\r\nCivil year containing 365 days 6 hours, and the Solar year 365 days 5\r\nhours 48 minutes 57 seconds. The following table shews the length, and\r\nconsequently the difference of any number of Sidereal, Civil, and Solar\r\nyears from 1 to 10,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason for altering the Style.]\r\n\r\n250. The above 11 minutes 3 seconds, by which the Civil or Julian year\r\nexceeds the Solar, amounts to 11 days in 1433 years: and so much our\r\nseasons have fallen back with respect to the days of the months, since\r\nthe time of the _Nicene_ Council in _A.D._ 325, and therefore in order\r\nto bring back all the Fasts and Festivals to the days then settled, it\r\nwas requisite to suppress 11 nominal days. And that the same seasons\r\nmight be kept to the same times of the year for the future, to leave out\r\nthe Bissextile day in _February_ at the end of every century of years\r\nnot divisible by 4; reckoning them only common years, as the 17th, 18th\r\nand 19th centuries, _viz._ the years 1700, 1800, 1900, _&c._ because a\r\nday intercalated every fourth year was too much, and retaining the\r\nBissextile-day at the end of those Centuries of years which are\r\ndivisible by 4, as the 16th, 20th and 24th Centuries; _viz._ the years\r\n1600, 2000, 2400, _&c._ Otherwise, in length of time the seasons would\r\nhave been quite reversed with regard to the months of the years; though\r\nit would have required near 23,783 years to have brought about such a\r\ntotal change. If the Earth had made exactly 365-1/4 diurnal rotations on\r\nits axis, whilst it revolved from any Equinoctial or Solstitial point to\r\nthe same again, the Civil and Solar years would always have kept pace\r\ntogether; and the style would never have needed any alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Precession of the Equinoctial Points.]\r\n\r\n251. Having already mentioned the cause of the Precession of the\r\nEquinoctial points in the heavens, § 246, which occasions a flow\r\ndeviation of the earth’s axis from its parallelism, and thereby a change\r\nof the declination of the Stars from the Equator, together with a slow\r\napparent motion of the Stars forward with respect to the Signs of the\r\nEcliptic; we shall now describe the Phenomena by a Diagram.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.]\r\n\r\nLet _NZSVL_ be the Earth, _SONA_ its Axis produced to the starry\r\nHeavens, and terminating in _A_, the present north Pole of the Heavens,\r\nwhich is vertical to _N_ the north Pole of the Earth. Let _EOQ_ be the\r\nEquator, _T_♋_Z_ the Tropic of Cancer, and _VT_♑ the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn: _VOZ_ the Ecliptic, and _BO_ its Axis, both which are\r\nimmoveable among the Stars. But, as [57]the Equinoctial points recede in\r\nthe Ecliptic, the Earth’s Axis _SON_ is in motion upon the Earth’s\r\ncenter _O_, in such a manner as to describe the double Cone _NOn_ and\r\n_SOs_, round the Axis of the Ecliptic _BO_, in the time that the\r\nEquinoctial points move quite round the Ecliptic, which is 25,920 years;\r\nand in that length of time, the north Pole of the Earth’s Axis produced,\r\ndescribes the Circle _ABCDA_ in the starry Heavens, round the Pole of\r\nthe Ecliptic, which keeps immoveable in the center of that Circle. The\r\nEarth’s Axis being 23-1/2 degrees inclined to the Axis of the Ecliptic,\r\nthe Circle _ABCDA_, described by the north Pole of the Earth’s Axis\r\nproduced to _A_, is 47 degrees in diameter, or double the inclination of\r\nthe Earth’s Axis. In consequence of this, the point _A_, which at\r\npresent is the North Pole of the Heavens, and near to a Star of the\r\nsecond magnitude in the tail of the constellation called _the Little\r\nBear_, must be deserted by the Earth’s Axis; which moving backwards a\r\ndegree every 72 years, will be directed towards the Star or Point _B_ in\r\n6480 years hence: and in double of that time, or 12,960 years, it will\r\nbe directed towards the Star or Point _C_; which will then be the North\r\nPole of the Heavens, although it is at present 8-1/2 degrees south of\r\nthe Zenith of _London L_. The present position of the Equator _EOQ_ will\r\nthen be changed into _eOq_, the Tropic of Cancer _T_♋_Z_ into _Vt_♋, and\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn _VT_♑ into _t_♑_Z_; as is evident by the Figure.\r\nAnd the Sun, in the same part of the Heavens where he is now over the\r\nearthly Tropic of Capricorn, and makes the shortest days and longest\r\nnights in the Northern Hemisphere, will then be over the earthly Tropic\r\nof Cancer, and make the days longest, and nights shortest. So that it\r\nwill require 12,960 years yet more, or 25,920 from the present time, to\r\nbring the North Pole _N_ quite round, so as to be directed toward that\r\npoint of the Heavens which is vertical to it at present. And then, and\r\nnot till then, the same Stars which at present describe the Equator,\r\nTropics, polar Circles, and Poles, by the Earth’s diurnal motion, will\r\ndescribe them over again.\r\n\r\n _A_

VII.\r\n\r\n           The Moon’s surface mountainous.]\r\n\r\n252. By looking at the Moon with an ordinary telescope we perceive that\r\nher surface is diversified with long tracts of prodigious high mountains\r\nand deep cavities. Some of her mountains, by comparing their height with\r\nher diameter (which is 2180 miles) are found to be three times higher\r\nthan the highest hills on our Earth. This ruggedness of the Moon’s\r\nsurface is of great use to us, by reflecting the Sun’s light to all\r\nsides: for if the Moon were smooth and polished like a looking-glass, or\r\ncovered with water, she could never distribute the Sun’s light all\r\nround; only in some positions she would shew us his image, no bigger\r\nthan a point, but with such a lustre as would be hurtful to our eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why no hills appear on her edge.]\r\n\r\n253. The Moon’s surface being so uneven, many have wondered why her edge\r\nappears not jagged, as well as the curve bounding the light and dark\r\nplaces. But if we consider, that what we call the edge of the Moon’s\r\nDisc is not a single line set round with mountains, in which case it\r\nwould appear irregularly indented, but a large Zone having many\r\nmountains lying behind one another from the observer’s eye, we shall\r\nfind that the mountains in some rows will be opposite to the vales in\r\nothers; and so fill up the inequalities as to make her appear quite\r\nround: just as when one looks at an orange, although it’s roughness be\r\nvery discernible on the side next the eye, especially if the Sun or a\r\nCandle shines obliquely on that side, yet the line terminating the\r\nvisible part still appears smooth and even.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.\r\n\r\n_J. Ferguson delin._      _J. Mynde Sculp._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon has no twilight.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n254. As the Sun can only enlighten that half of the Earth which is at\r\nany moment turned towards him, and being withdrawn from the opposite\r\nhalf leaves it in darkness; so he likewise doth to the Moon: only with\r\nthis difference, that the Earth being surrounded by an Atmosphere, and\r\nthe Moon having none, we have twilight after the Sun sets; but the Lunar\r\nInhabitants have an immediate transition from the brightest Sun-shine to\r\nthe blackest darkness § 177. For, let _tkrsw_ be the Earth, and _A_,\r\n_B_, _C_, _D_, _E_, _F_, _G_, _H_ the Moon in eight different parts of\r\nher Orbit. As the Earth turns round its Axis, from west to east, when\r\nany place comes to _t_ the twilight begins there, and when it revolves\r\nfrom thence to _r_ the Sun _S_ rises; when the place comes to _s_ the\r\nSun sets, and when it comes to _w_ the twilight ends. But as the Moon\r\nturns round her Axis, which is only once a month, the moment that any\r\npoint of her surface comes to _r_ (see the Moon at _G_) the Sun rises\r\nthere without any previous warning by twilight; and when the same point\r\ncomes to _s_ the Sun sets, and that point goes into darkness as black as\r\nat midnight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s Phases.]\r\n\r\n255. The Moon being an opaque spherical body, (for her hills take off no\r\nmore from her roundness than the inequalities on the surface of an\r\norange takes off from its roundness) we can only see that part of the\r\nenlightened half of her which is towards the Earth. And therefore, when\r\nthe Moon is at _A_, in conjunction with the Sun _S_, her dark half is\r\ntowards the Earth, and she disappears as at _a_, there being no light on\r\nthat half to render it visible. When she comes to her first Octant at\r\n_B_, or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her Conjunction, a\r\nquarter of her enlightened side is towards the Earth, and she appears\r\nhorned as at _b_. When she has gone a quarter of her orbit from between\r\nthe Earth and Sun to _C_, she shews us one half of her enlightened side\r\nas at _c_, and we say, she is a quarter old. At _D_ she is in her second\r\nOctant, and by shewing us more of her enlightened side she appears\r\ngibbous as at _d_. At _E_ her whole enlightened side is towards the\r\nEarth, and therefore she appears round as at _e_, when we say, it is\r\nFull Moon. In her third Octant at _F_, part of her dark side being\r\ntowards the Earth, she again appears gibbous, and is on the decrease, as\r\nat _f_. At _G_ we see just one half of her enlightened side, and she\r\nappears half decreased, or in her third Quarter, as at _g_. At _H_ we\r\nonly see a quarter of her enlightened side, being in her fourth Octant,\r\nwhere she appears horned as at _h_. And at _A_, having compleated her\r\ncourse from the Sun to the Sun again, she disappears; and we say, it is\r\nNew Moon. Thus in going from _A_ to _E_ the Moon seems continually to\r\nincrease; and in going from _E_ to _A_, to decrease in the same\r\nproportion; having like Phases at equal distances from _A_ or _E_, but\r\nas seen from the Sun _S_, she is always Full.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s Disc not always quite round when full.]\r\n\r\n256. The Moon appears not perfectly round when she is Full in the\r\nhighest or lowest part of her Orbit, because we have not a direct view\r\nof her enlightened side at that time. When Full in the highest part of\r\nher orbit, a small deficiency appears on her lower edge; and the\r\ncontrary when Full in the lowest part of her Orbit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Phases of the Earth and Moon contrary.]\r\n\r\n257. ’Tis plain by the Figure, that when the Moon changes to the Earth,\r\nthe Earth appears Full to the Moon; and _vice versâ_. For when the Moon\r\nis at _A_, _New_ to the Earth, the whole enlightened side of the Earth\r\nis towards the Moon: and when the Moon is at _E_, _Full_ to the Earth,\r\nit’s dark side is towards her. Hence a _New Moon_ answers to a _Full\r\nEarth_, and a _Full Moon_ to a _New Earth_. The _Quarters_ are also\r\nreversed to each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An agreeable Phenomenon.]\r\n\r\n258. Between the third Quarter and Change, the Moon is frequently\r\nvisible in the forenoon, even when the Sun shines; and then she affords\r\nus an opportunity of seeing a very agreeable appearance, wherever we\r\nfind a globular stone above the level of the eye, as suppose on the top\r\nof a gate. For, if the Sun shines on the stone, and we place ourselves\r\nso as the upper part of the stone may just seem to touch the point of\r\nthe Moon’s lowermost horn, we shall then see the enlightened part of the\r\nstone exactly of the same shape with the Moon; horned as she is, and\r\ninclining the same way to the Horizon. The reason is plain; for the Sun\r\nenlightens the stone the same way as he does the Moon: and both being\r\nGlobes, when we put ourselves into the above situation, the Moon and\r\nstone have the same position to our eyes; and therefore we must see as\r\nmuch of the illuminated part of the one as of the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nonagesimal Degree, what.]\r\n\r\n259. The position of the Moon’s Cusps, or a right line touching the\r\npoints of her horns, is very differently inclined to the Horizon at\r\ndifferent hours of the same days of her age. Sometimes she stands, as it\r\nwere, upright on her lower horn, and then such a line is perpendicular\r\nto the Horizon: when this, happens, she is in what the Astronomers call\r\n_the Nonagesimal Degree_; which is the highest point of the Ecliptic\r\nabove the Horizon at that time, and is 90 degrees from both sides of the\r\nHorizon where it is then cut by the Ecliptic. But this never happens\r\nwhen the Moon is on the Meridian, except when she is at the very\r\nbeginning of Cancer or Capricorn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the inclination of the Ecliptic may be found by the\r\n           position of the Moon horns.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII.]\r\n\r\n260. The inclination of that part of the Ecliptic to the Horizon in\r\nwhich the Moon is at any time when horned, may be known by the position\r\nof her horns; for a right line touching their points is perpendicular to\r\nthe Ecliptic. And as the Angle that the Moon’s orbit makes with the\r\nEcliptic can never raise her above, nor depress her below the Ecliptic,\r\nmore than two minutes of a degree, as seen from the Sun; it can have no\r\nsensible effect upon the position of her horns. Therefore, if a Quadrant\r\nbe held up, so as one of it’s edges may seem to touch the Moon’s horns,\r\nthe graduated side being kept towards the eye, and as far from the eye\r\nas it can be conveniently held, the arc between the Plumb-line and that\r\nedge of the Quadrant which seems to touch the Moon’s horns will shew the\r\ninclination of that part of the Ecliptic to the Horizon. And the arc\r\nbetween the other edge of the Quadrant and Plumb-line will shew the\r\ninclination of the Moon’s horns to the Horizon at that time also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Why the Moon appears as big as the Sun.]\r\n\r\n261. The Moon generally appears as large as the Sun; for the Angle\r\n_vkA_, under which the Moon is seen from the Earth, is the same with the\r\nAngle _LkM_, under which the Sun is seen from it. And therefore the Moon\r\nmay hide the Sun’s whole Disc from us, as she sometimes does in solar\r\nEclipses. The reason why she does not eclipse the Sun at every Change\r\nshall be explained afterwards. If the Moon were farther from the Earth\r\nas at _a_, she could never hide the whole of the Sun from us; for then\r\nshe would appear under the Angle _NkO_, eclipsing only that part of the\r\nSun which lies between _N_ and _O_: were she still further from the\r\nEarth, as at _X_, she would appear under the small Angle _TkW_, like a\r\nspot on the Sun, hiding only the part _TW_ from our sight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof of the Moon’s turning round her Axis.]\r\n\r\n262. The Moon turns round her Axis in the time that she goes round her\r\norbit; which is evident from hence, that a spectator at rest, without\r\nthe periphery of the Moon’s orbit, would see all her sides turned\r\nregularly towards him in that time. She turns round her Axis from any\r\nStar to the same Star again in 27 days 8 hours; from the Sun to the Sun\r\nagain in 29-1/2 days: the former is the length of her sidereal day, and\r\nthe latter the length of her solar day. A body moving round the Sun\r\nwould have a solar day in every revolution, without turning on it’s\r\nAxis; the same as if it had kept all the while at rest, and the Sun\r\nmoved round it: but without turning round it’s Axis it could never have\r\none sidereal day, because it would always keep the same side towards any\r\ngiven Star.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Her periodical and synodical Revolution.]\r\n\r\n263. If the Earth had no annual motion, the Moon would go round it so as\r\nto compleat a Lunation, a sidereal, and a solar day, all in the same\r\ntime. But, because the Earth goes forward in it’s orbit while the Moon\r\ngoes round the Earth in her orbit, the Moon must go as much more than\r\nround her orbit from Change to Change in compleating a solar day as the\r\nEarth has gone forward in it’s orbit during that time, _i. e._ almost a\r\ntwelfth part of a Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Familiarly represented.\r\n\r\n           A Table shewing the times that the hour and minute hands of a\r\n           watch are in conjunction.\r\n\r\n           A machine for shewing the motions of the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII.]\r\n\r\n264. The Moon’s periodical and synodical revolution may be familiarly\r\nrepresented by the motions of the hour and minute hands of a watch round\r\nit’s dial-plate, which is divided into 12 equal parts or hours, as the\r\nEcliptic is divided into 12 Signs, and the year into 12 months. Let us\r\nsuppose these 12 hours to be 12 months, the hour hand the Sun, and the\r\nminute hand the Moon; then will the former go round once in a year, and\r\nthe latter once in a month; but the Moon, or minute hand must go more\r\nthan round from any point of the Circle where it was last conjoined with\r\nthe Sun, or hour hand, to overtake it again: for the hour hand being in\r\nmotion, can never be overtaken by the minute hand at that point from\r\nwhich they started at their last conjunction. The first column of the\r\nannexed Table shews the number of conjunctions which the hour and minute\r\nhand make whilst the hour hand goes once round the dial-plate; and the\r\nother columns shew the times when the two hands meet at every\r\nconjunction. Thus, suppose the two hands to be in conjunction at XII, as\r\nthey always are; then, at the first following conjunction it is 5\r\nminutes 27 seconds 16 thirds 21 fourths 49-1/11 fifths past I where they\r\nmeet; at the second conjunction it is 10 minutes 54 seconds 32 thirds 43\r\nfourths 38-1/2 fifths past II; and so on. This, though an easy\r\nillustration of the motions of the Sun and Moon, is not precise as to\r\nthe times of their conjunctions; because, while the Sun goes round the\r\nEcliptic, the Moon makes 12-1/3 conjunctions with him; but the minute\r\nhand of a watch or clock makes only 11 conjunctions with the hour hand\r\nin one period round the dial-plate. But if, instead of the common\r\nwheel-work at the back of the dial-plate, the Axis of the minute hand\r\nhad a pinion of 6 leaves turning a wheel of 40, and this last turning\r\nthe hour hand, in every revolution it makes round the dial-plate the\r\nminute hand would make 12-1/3 conjunctions with it; and so would be a\r\npretty device for shewing the motions of the Sun and Moon; especially,\r\nas the slowest moving hand might have a little Sun fixed on it’s point,\r\nand the quickest a little Moon. Besides, the plate, instead of hours and\r\nquarters, might have a Circle of months, with the 12 Signs and their\r\nDegrees; and if a plate of 29-1/2 equal parts for the days of the Moon’s\r\nage were fixed to the Axis of the Sun-hand, and below it, so as the Sun\r\nalways kept at the 1/2 day of that plate, the Moon-hand would shew the\r\nMoon’s age upon that plate for every day pointed out by the Sun-hand in\r\nthe Circle of months; and both Sun and Moon would shew their places in\r\nthe Ecliptic: for the Sun would go round the Ecliptic in 365 Days and\r\nthe Moon in 27-1/3 days, which is her periodical revolution; but from\r\nthe Sun to the Sun again, or from Change to Change, in 29-1/2 days,\r\nwhich is her synodical revolution.\r\n\r\n +-----+-------------------------------+\r\n |Conj.|  H.

If the Earth had no annual motion, the Moon’s motion round the\r\nEarth, and her track in absolute space, would be always the same[58].\r\nBut as the Earth and Moon move round the Sun, the Moon’s real path in\r\nthe Heavens is very different from her path round the Earth: the latter\r\nbeing in a progressive Circle, and the former in a curve of different\r\ndegrees of concavity, which would always be the same in the same parts\r\nof the Heavens, if the Moon performed a compleat number of Lunations in\r\na year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An idea of the Earth’s path and the Moon’s.]\r\n\r\n266. Let a nail in the end of the axle of a chariot-wheel represent the\r\nEarth, and a pin in the nave the Moon; if the body of the chariot be\r\npropped up so as to keep that wheel from touching the ground, and the\r\nwheel be then turned round by hand, the pin will describe a Circle both\r\nround the nail and in the space it moves through. But if the props be\r\ntaken away, the horses put to, and the chariot driven over a piece of\r\nground which is circularly convex; the nail in the axle will describe a\r\ncircular curve, and the pin in the nave will still describe a circle\r\nround the progressive nail in the axle, but not in the space through\r\nwhich it moves. In this case, the curve described by the nail will\r\nresemble in miniature as much of the Earth’s annual path round the Sun,\r\nas it describes whilst the Moon goes as often round the Earth as the pin\r\ndoes round the nail: and the curve described by the nail will have some\r\nresemblance of the Moon’s path during so many Lunations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII.]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the Radius of the circular curve described by\r\nthe nail in the axle is to the Radius of the Circle which the pin in the\r\nnave describes round the axle as 337-1/2 to 1; which is the proportion\r\nof the Radius or Semidiameter of the Earth’s Orbit to that of the\r\nMoon’s; or of the circular curve _A_ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 _B_ &c. to the little\r\nCircle _a_; and then, whilst the progressive nail describes the said\r\ncurve from _A_ to _E_, the pin will go once round the nail with regard\r\nto the center of it’s path, and in doing so, will describe the curve\r\n_abcde_. The former will be a true representation of the Earth’s path\r\nfor one Lunation, and the latter of the Moon’s for that time. Here we\r\nmay set aside the inequalities of the Moon’s Moon, and also the Earth’s\r\nmoving round it’s common center of gravity and the Moon’s: all which, if\r\nthey were truly copied in this experiment, would not sensibly alter the\r\nfigure of the paths described by the nail and pin, even though they\r\nshould rub against a plain upright surface all the way, and leave their\r\ntracks visible. And if the chariot should be driven forward on such a\r\nconvex piece of ground, so as to turn the wheel several times round, the\r\ntrack of the pin in the nave would still be concave toward the center of\r\nthe circular curve described by the pin in the Axle; as the Moon’s path\r\nis always concave to the Sun in the center of the Earth’s annual Orbit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proportion of the Moon’s Orbit to the Earth’s.]\r\n\r\nIn this Diagram, the thickest curve line _ABCD_, with the numeral\r\nfigures set to it, represents as much of the Earth’s annual Orbit as it\r\ndescribes in 32 days from west to east; the little Circles at _a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, _d_, _e_ shew the Moon’s Orbit in due proportion to the Earth’s;\r\nand the smallest curve _abcdef_ represents the line of the Moon’s path\r\nin the Heavens for 32 days, accounted from any particular New Moon at\r\n_a_. The machine, Fig. 5th is for delineating the Moon’s path, and will\r\nbe described, with the rest of my Astronomical machinery, in the last\r\nChapter. The Sun is supposed to be in the center of the curve _A 1 2 3 4\r\n5 6 7 B_ &c. and the small dotted Circles upon it represent the Moon’s\r\nOrbit, of which the Radius is in the same proportion to the Earth’s path\r\nin this scheme, that the Radius of the Moon’s Orbit in the Heavens bears\r\nto the Radius of the Earth’s annual path round the Sun; that is, as\r\n240,000 to 81,000,000, or as 1 to 337-1/2.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth is at _A_ the New Moon is at _a_; and in the seven days\r\nthat the Earth describes the curve _1 2 3 4 5 6 7_, the Moon in\r\naccompanying the Earth describes the curve _ab_; and is in her first\r\nQuarter at _b_ when the Earth is at _B_. As the Earth describes the\r\ncurve _B 8 9 10 11 12 13 14_ the Moon describes the curve _bc_; and is\r\nopposite to the Sun at _c_, when the Earth is at _C_. Whilst the Earth\r\ndescribes the curve _C 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22_ the Moon describes the\r\ncurve _cd_; and is in her third Quarter at _d_ when the Earth is at _D_.\r\nOnce more, whilst the Earth describes the curve _D 23 24 25 26 27 28 29_\r\nthe Moon describes the curve _de_; and is again in conjunction at _e_\r\nwith the Sun when the Earth is at _E_, between the 29th and 30th day of\r\nthe Moon’s age, accounted by the numeral Figures from the New Moon at\r\n_A_. In describing the curve _abcde_, the Moon goes round the\r\nprogressive Earth as really as if she had kept in the dotted Circle _A_,\r\nand the Earth continued immoveable in the center of that Circle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s motion always concave towards the Sun.]\r\n\r\nAnd thus we see, that although the Moon goes round the Earth in a\r\nCircle, with respect to the Earth’s center, her real path in the Heavens\r\nis not very different in appearance from the Earth’s path. To shew that\r\nthe Moon’s path is concave to the Sun, even at the time of Change, it is\r\ncarried on a little farther into a second Lunation, as to _f_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How her motion is alternately retarded and accelerated.]\r\n\r\n267. The Moon’s absolute motion from her Change to her first Quarter, or\r\nfrom _a_ to _b_, is so much slower than the Earth’s, that she falls 240\r\nthousand miles (equal to the Semidiameter of her Orbit) behind the Earth\r\nat her first Quarter in _b_, when the Earth is in _B_; that is, she\r\nfalls back a space equal to her distance from the Earth. From that time\r\nher motion is gradually accelerated to her Opposition or Full at _c_,\r\nand then she is come up as far as the Earth, having regained what she\r\nlost in her first Quarter from _a_ to _b_. From the Full to the last\r\nQuarter at _d_ her motion continues accelerated, so as to be just as far\r\nbefore the Earth at _D_, as she was behind it at her first Quarter in\r\n_b_. But, from _d_ to _e_ her motion is retarded so, that she loses as\r\nmuch with respect to the Earth as is equal to her distance from it, or\r\nto the Semidiameter of her Orbit; and by that means she comes to _e_,\r\nand is then in conjunction with the Sun as seen from the Earth at _E_.\r\nHence we find, that the Moon’s absolute motion is slower than the\r\nEarth’s from her third Quarter to her first; and swifter than the\r\nEarth’s from her first Quarter to her third: her path being less curved\r\nthan the Earth’s in the former case, and more in the latter. Yet it is\r\nstill bent the same way towards the Sun; for if we imagine the concavity\r\nof the Earth’s Orbit to be measured by the length of a perpendicular\r\nline _Cg_, let down from the Earth’s place upon the straight line _bgd_\r\nat the Full of the Moon, and connecting the places of the Earth at the\r\nend of the Moon’s first and third Quarters, that length will be about\r\n640 thousand miles; and the Moon when New only approaching nearer to the\r\nSun by 240 thousand miles than the Earth is, the length of the\r\nperpendicular let down from her place at that time upon the same\r\nstraight line, and which shews the concavity of that part of her path,\r\nwill be about 400 thousand miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A difficulty removed.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII.]\r\n\r\n268. The Moon’s path being concave to the Sun throughout, demonstrates\r\nthat her gravity towards the Sun, at her conjunction, exceeds her\r\ngravity towards the Earth. And if we consider that the quantity of\r\nmatter in the Sun is almost 230 thousand times as great as the quantity\r\nof matter in the Earth, and that the attraction of each body diminishes\r\nas the square of the distance from it increases, we shall soon find,\r\nthat the point of equal attraction where these two powers would be\r\nequally strong, is about 70 thousand miles nearer the Earth than the\r\nMoon is at her Change. It may now appear surprising that the Moon does\r\nnot abandon the Earth when she is between it and the Sun, because she is\r\nconsiderably more attracted by the Sun than by the Earth at that time.\r\nBut this difficulty vanishes when we consider, that the Moon is so near\r\nthe Earth in proportion to the Earth’s distance from the Sun, that she\r\nis but very little more attracted by the Sun at that time than the Earth\r\nis; and whilst the Earth’s attraction is greater upon the Moon than the\r\ndifference of the Sun’s attraction upon the Earth and her (and that it\r\nis always much greater is demonstrable) there is no danger of the Moon’s\r\nleaving the Earth; for if she should fall towards the Sun, the Earth\r\nwould follow her almost with equal speed. The absolute attraction of the\r\nEarth upon a drop of falling rain is much greater than the absolute\r\nattraction of the particles of that drop upon each other, or of it’s\r\ncenter upon all parts of it’s circumference; but then the side of the\r\ndrop next the Earth is attracted with so very little more force than\r\nit’s center, or even it’s opposite side; that the attraction of the\r\ncenter of the drop upon it’s side next the Earth is much greater than\r\nthe difference of force by which the Earth attracts it’s nearer surface\r\nand center: on which account the drop preserves it’s round figure, and\r\nmight be projected about the Earth by a strong circulating wind so as to\r\nbe kept from falling to the Earth. It is much the same with the Earth\r\nand Moon in respect to the Sun; for if we should suppose the Moon’s\r\nOrbit to be filled with a fluid Globe, of which all the parts would be\r\nattracted towards the Earth in it’s center, but the whole of it much\r\nmore attracted by the Sun; one part of it could not fall to the Sun\r\nwithout the other, and a sufficient projectile force would carry the\r\nwhole fluid Globe round the Sun. A ship, at the distance of the Moon,\r\nsailing round the Earth on the surface of the fluid Globe, could no more\r\nbe taken away by the Sun when it is on the side next him, than the Earth\r\ncould be taken away from it when it is on the opposite side; which could\r\nnever happen unless the Earth’s projectile motion were stopt; and if it\r\nwere stopt, the Ship with the whole fluid Globe, Earth and all together,\r\nwould as naturally fall to the Sun as a drop of rain in calm air falls\r\nto the Earth. Hence we may see, that the Earth is in no more danger of\r\nbeing left by the Moon at the Change, than the Moon is of being left by\r\nthe Earth at the Full: the diameter of the Moon’s Orbit being so small\r\nin comparison of the Sun’s distance, that the Moon is but little more or\r\nless attracted than the Earth at any time. And as the Moon’s projectile\r\nforce keeps her from falling to the Earth, so the Earth’s projectile\r\nforce keeps it from falling to the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n269. All the curves which Jupiter’s Satellites describe, are different\r\nfrom the path described by our Moon, although these Satellites go round\r\nJupiter, as the Moon goes round the Earth. Let _ABCDE_ &c. be as much of\r\nJupiter’s Orbit as he describes in 18 days from _A_ to _T_; and the\r\ncurves _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ will be the paths of his four Moons going\r\nround him in his progressive motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The absolute Path of Jupiter and his Satellites delineated.\r\n\r\n           Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose all these Moons to set out from a conjunction with\r\nthe Sun, as seen from Jupiter. When Jupiter is at _A_ his first or\r\nnearest Moon will be at _a_, his second at _b_, his third at _c_, and\r\nhis fourth at _d_. At the end of 24 terrestrial hours after this\r\nconjunction, Jupiter has moved to _B_, his first Moon or Satellite has\r\ndescribed the curve _a1_, his second the curve _b1_, his third _c1_, and\r\nhis fourth _d1_. The next day when Jupiter is at _C_, his first\r\nSatellite has described the curve _a2_ from its conjunction, his second\r\nthe curve _b2_, his third the curve _c2_, and his fourth the curve _d2_,\r\nand so on. The numeral Figures under the capital letters shew Jupiter’s\r\nplace in his path every day for 18 days, accounted from _A_ to _T_; and\r\nthe like Figures set to the paths of his Satellites, shew where they are\r\nat the like times. The first Satellite, almost under _C_, is stationary\r\nat + as seen from the Sun; and retrograde from + to _2_: at _2_ it\r\nappears stationary again, and thence it moves forward until it has past\r\n_3_, being twice stationary, and once retrograde between _3_ and _4_.\r\nThe path of this Satellite intersects itself every 42-1/2 hours of our\r\ntime, making such loops as in the Diagram at _2._ _3._ _5._ _7._ _9._\r\n_10._ _12._ _14._ _16._ _18_, a little after every Conjunction. The\r\nsecond Satellite _b_, moving slower, barely crosses it’s path every 3\r\ndays 13 hours; as at _4._ _7._ _11._ _14._ _18_, making only five loops\r\nand as many conjunctions in the time that the first makes ten. The third\r\nSatellite _c_ moving still slower, and having described the curve _c 1.\r\n2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7_, comes to an Angle at _7_ in conjunction with the Sun\r\nat the end of 7 days 4 hours; and so goes on to describe such another\r\ncurve _7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14_, and is at _14_ in it’s next\r\nconjunction. The fourth Satellite _d_ is always progressive, making\r\nneither loops nor angles in the Heavens; but comes to it’s next\r\nconjunction at _e_ between the numeral figures _16_ and _17_, or in 16\r\ndays 18 hours. In order to have a tolerably good figure of the paths of\r\nthese Satellites, I took the following method.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII.\r\n\r\n           How to delineate the paths of Jupiter’s Moons.\r\n\r\n           And Saturn’s.]\r\n\r\nHaving drawn their Orbits on a Card, in proportion to their relative\r\ndistances from Jupiter, I measured the radius of the Orbit of the fourth\r\nSatellite, which was an inch and a tenth part; then multiplied this by\r\n424 for the radius of Jupiter’s Orbit, because Jupiter is 424 times as\r\nfar from the Sun’s center as his fourth Satellite is from his center;\r\nand the product thence arising was 466-4/10 inches. Then taking a small\r\ncord of this length, and fixing one end of it to the floor of a long\r\nroom by a nail, with a black lead pencil at the other end I drew the\r\ncurve _ABCD_ &c. and set off a degree and an half thereon, from _A_ to\r\n_T_; because Jupiter moves only so much, whilst his outermost Satellite\r\ngoes once round him, and somewhat more; so that this small portion of so\r\nlarge a circle differs but very little from a straight line. This done,\r\nI divided the space _AT_ into 18 equal parts, as _AB_, _BC_, &c. for the\r\ndaily progress of Jupiter; and each part into 24 for his hourly\r\nprogress. The Orbit of each Satellite was also divided into as many\r\nequal parts as the Satellite is hours in finishing it’s synodical period\r\nround Jupiter. Then drawing a right line through the center of the Card,\r\nas a diameter to all the 4 Orbits upon it, I put the card upon the line\r\nof Jupiter’s motion, and transferred it to every horary division\r\nthereon, keeping always the said diameter-line on the line of Jupiter’s\r\npath; and running a pin through each horary division in the Orbit of\r\neach Satellite as the card was gradually transferred along the Line\r\n_ABCD_ etc. of Jupiter’s motion, I marked points for every hour through\r\nthe Card for the Curves described by the Satellites as the primary\r\nplanet in the center of the Card was carried forward on the line: and so\r\nfinished the Figure, by drawing the lines of each Satellite’s motion,\r\nthrough those (almost innumerable) points: by which means, this is\r\nperhaps as true a Figure of the paths of these Satellites as can be\r\ndesired. And in the same manner might those for Saturn’s Satellites be\r\ndelineated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The grand Period of Jupiter’s Moons.]\r\n\r\n270. It appears by the scheme, that the three first Satellites come\r\nalmost into the same line or position every seventh day; the first being\r\nonly a little behind with the second, and the second behind with the\r\nthird. But the period of the fourth Satellite is so incommensurate to\r\nthe periods of the other three, that it cannot be guessed at by the\r\ndiagram when it would fall again into a line of conjunction with them,\r\nbetween Jupiter and the Sun. And no wonder; for supposing them all to\r\nhave been once in conjunction, it will require 3,087,043,493,260 years\r\nto bring them in a conjunction again: See § 73.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV. The proportions of the Orbits of the Planets and\r\n           Satellites.]\r\n\r\n271. In Fig. 4th we have the proportions of the Orbits of Saturn’s five\r\nSatellites, and of Jupiter’s four, to one another, to our Moon’s Orbit,\r\nand to the Disc of the Sun. _S_ is the Sun; _M m_ the Moon’s Orbit (the\r\nEarth supposed to be at _E_;) _J_ Jupiter; _1._ _2._ _3._ _4_ the Orbits\r\nof his four Moons or Satellites; _Sat_ Saturn; and _1._ _2._ _3._ _4._\r\n_5_ the Orbits of his five Moons. Hence it appears, that the Sun would\r\nmuch more than fill the whole Orbit of the Moon; for the Sun’s diameter\r\nis 763,000 miles, and the diameter of the Moon’s Orbit only 480,000. In\r\nproportion to all these Orbits of the Satellites, the Radius of Saturn’s\r\nannual Orbit would be 21-1/4 yards, of Jupiter’s orbit 11-2/3, and of\r\nthe Earth’s 2-1/4, taking them in round numbers.\r\n\r\n272. The annexed table shews at once what proportion the Orbits,\r\nRevolutions, and Velocities, of all the Satellites bear to those of\r\ntheir primary Planets, and what sort of curves the several Satellites\r\ndescribe. For, those Satellites whose velocities round their primaries\r\nare greater than the velocities of their primaries in open space, make\r\nloops at their conjunctions § 269; appearing retrograde as seen from the\r\nSun whilst they describe the inferior parts of their Orbits, and direct\r\nwhilst they describe the superior. This is the case with Jupiter’s first\r\nand second Satellites, and with Saturn’s first. But those Satellites\r\nwhose velocities are less than the velocities of their primary planets\r\nmove direct in their whole circumvolutions; which is the case of the\r\nthird and fourth Satellites of Jupiter, and of the second, third,\r\nfourth, and fifth Satellites of Saturn, as well as of our Satellite the\r\nMoon: But the Moon is the only Satellite whose motion is always concave\r\nto the Sun. There is a table of this sort in _De la Caile_’s Astronomy,\r\nbut it is very different from the above, which I have computed from our\r\n_English_ accounts of the periods and distances of these Planets and\r\nSatellites.\r\n\r\n +------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n |            | Proportion of   | Proportion of  | Proportion of        |\r\n |            | the Radius of   | the Time of    | the Velocity of      |\r\n |   The      | the Planet’s    | the Planet’s   | each Satellite       |\r\n | Satellites | Orbit to the    | Revolution to  | to the Velocity      |\r\n |            | Radius of the   | the Revolution | of its primary       |\r\n |            | Orbit of each   | of each        | Planet.              |\r\n |            | Satellite.      | Satellite.     |                      |\r\n +------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n |  of Saturn |                 |                |                      |\r\n |          1 | As    5322 to 1 | As   5738 to 1 | As    5738 to 5322   |\r\n |          2 |       4155    1 |      3912    1 |       3912    4155   |\r\n |          3 |       2954    1 |      2347    1 |       2347    2954   |\r\n |          4 |       1295    1 |       674    1 |        674    1295   |\r\n |          5 |        432    1 |       134    1 |        134     432   |\r\n +------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n | of Jupiter |                 |                |                      |\r\n |          1 | As    1851 to 1 | As   2445 to 1 | As    2445 to 1851   |\r\n |          2 |       1165    1 |      1219    1 |       1219    1165   |\r\n |          3 |        731    1 |       604    1 |        604     731   |\r\n |          4 |        424    1 |       258    1 |        258     424   |\r\n +------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n |  The Moon  | As 337-1/2 to 1 | As 12-1/3 to 1 | As 12-1/3 to 337-1/2 |\r\n +------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n  _The Phenomena of the Harvest-Moon explained by a common Globe: The\r\n  years in which the Harvest-Moons are least and most beneficial from\r\n1751, to 1861. The long duration of Moon-light at the Poles in winter._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Harvest-Moon at the Equator.]\r\n\r\n273. It is generally believed that the Moon rises about 48 minutes later\r\nevery day than on the preceding; but this is true only with regard to\r\nplaces on the Equator. In places of considerable Latitude there is a\r\nremarkable difference, especially in the harvest time; with which\r\nFarmers were better acquainted than Astronomers till of late; and\r\ngratefully ascribed the early rising of the Full Moon at that time of\r\nthe year to the goodness of God, not doubting that he had ordered it so\r\non purpose to give them an immediate supply of moon-light after sun-set\r\nfor their greater conveniency in reaping the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But remarkable according to the distance of places from it.]\r\n\r\nIn this instance of the harvest-moon, as in many others discoverable by\r\nAstronomy, the wisdom and beneficence of the Deity is conspicuous, who\r\nreally ordered the course of the Moon so, as to bestow more or less\r\nlight on all parts of the earth as their several circumstances and\r\nseasons render it more or less serviceable. About the Equator, where\r\nthere is no variety of seasons, and the weather changes seldom, and at\r\nstated times, Moon-light is not necessary for gathering in the produce\r\nof the ground; and there the moon rises about 48 minutes later every day\r\nor night than on the former. At considerable distances from the Equator,\r\nwhere the weather and seasons are more uncertain, the autumnal Full\r\nMoons rise very soon after sun-set for several evenings together. At the\r\npolar circles, where the mild season is of very short duration, the\r\nautumnal Full Moon rises at Sun-set from the first to the third quarter.\r\nAnd at the Poles, where the Sun is for half a year absent, the winter\r\nFull moons shine constantly without setting from the first to the third\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason of this.]\r\n\r\nIt is soon said that all these Phenomena are owing to the different\r\nAngles made by the Horizon and different parts of the Moon’s orbit; and\r\nthat the Moon can be full but once or twice in a year in those parts of\r\nher orbit which rise with the least angles. But to explain this subject\r\nintelligibly we must dwell much longer upon it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE III.]\r\n\r\n274. The [59]plane of the Equinoctial is perpendicular to the Earth’s\r\nAxis: and therefore, as the Earth turns round its Axis, all parts of the\r\nEquinoctial make equal Angles with the Horizon both at rising and\r\nsetting; so that equal portions of it always rise or set in equal times.\r\nConsequently, if the Moon’s motion were equable, and in the Equinoctial,\r\nat the rate of 12 degrees from the Sun every day, as it is in her orbit,\r\nshe would rise and set 48 minutes later every day than on the preceding:\r\nfor 12 degrees of the Equinoctial rise or set in 48 minutes of time in\r\nall Latitudes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n275. But the Moon’s motion is so nearly in the Ecliptic that we may\r\nconsider her at present as moving in it. Now the different parts of the\r\nEcliptic, on account of its obliquity to the Earth’s Axis, make very\r\ndifferent Angles with the Horizon as they rise or set. Those parts or\r\nSigns which rise with the smallest Angles set with the greatest, and\r\n_vice versâ_. In equal times, whenever this Angle is least, a greater\r\nportion of the Ecliptic rises than when the Angle is larger; as may be\r\nseen by elevating the pole of a Globe to any considerable Latitude, and\r\nthen turning it round its Axis in the Horizon. Consequently, when the\r\nMoon is in those Signs which rise or set with the smallest Angles, she\r\nrises or sets with the least difference of time; and with the greatest\r\ndifference in those Signs which rise or set with the greatest Angles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           The different Angles made by the Ecliptic and Horizon.]\r\n\r\nBut, because all who read this Treatise may not be provided with Globes,\r\nthough in this case it is requisite to know how to use them, we shall\r\nsubstitute the Figure of a Globe; in which _FUP_ is the Axis, ♋_TR_ the\r\nTropic of Cancer, _LT_♑ the Tropic of Capricorn, ♋_EU_♑ the Ecliptic\r\ntouching both the Tropics which are 47 degrees from each other, and _AB_\r\nthe Horizon. The Equator, being in the middle between the Tropics, is\r\ncut by the Ecliptic in two opposite points, which are the beginnings of\r\n♈ Aries and ♎ Libra. _K_ is the Hour circle with its Index, _F_ the\r\nNorth pole of the Globe elevated to the Latitude of _London_[60], namely\r\n51-1/2 degrees above the Horizon; and _P_ the South Pole depressed as\r\nmuch below it. Because of the oblique position of the Sphere in this\r\nLatitude, the Ecliptic has the high elevation _N_♋ above the Horizon,\r\nmaking the Angle _NU_♋ of 62 degrees with it when ♋ Cancer is on the\r\nMeridian, at which time ♎ Libra rises in the East. But let the Globe be\r\nturned half round its Axis, till ♑ Capricorn comes to the Meridian and ♈\r\nAries rises in the East, and then the Ecliptic will have the low\r\nelevation _NL_ above the Horizon making only an Angle _NUL_ of 15\r\ndegrees, with it; which is 47 degrees less than the former Angle, equal\r\nto the distance between the Tropics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Least and greatest, when.]\r\n\r\n276. The smallest Angle made by the Ecliptic and Horizon is when Aries\r\nrises, at which time Libra sets: the greatest when Libra rises, at which\r\ntime Aries sets. From the rising of Aries to the rising of Libra (which\r\nis twelve [61]Sidereal hours) the angle increases; and from the rising\r\nof Libra to the rising of Aries it decreases in the same proportion. By\r\nthis article and the preceding, it appears that the Ecliptic rises\r\nfastest about Aries and slowest about Libra.\r\n\r\n +------+-----------+--------+---------+\r\n |      | Signs     | Rising | Setting |\r\n |      |           | Diff.  | Diff.   |\r\n | Days |           +--------+---------+\r\n |      |   Degrees | H.

On the Parallel of _London_, as much of the Ecliptic rises about\r\nPisces and Aries in two hours as the Moon goes through in six days: and\r\ntherefore whilst the Moon is in these Signs, she differs but two hours\r\nin rising for six days together; that is, 20 minutes later every day or\r\nnight than on the preceding. But in fourteen days afterwards, the Moon\r\ncomes to Virgo and Libra; which are the opposite Signs to Pisces and\r\nAries; and then she differs almost four times as much in rising; namely,\r\none hour and about fifteen minutes later every day or night than the\r\nformer, whilst she is in these Signs; for by § 275 their rising Angle is\r\nat least four times as great as that of Pisces and Aries. The annexed\r\nTable shews the daily mean difference of the Moon’s rising and setting\r\non the Parallel of _London_, for 28 days; in which time the Moon\r\nfinishes her period round the Ecliptic, and gets 9 degrees into the same\r\nSign from the beginning of which she set out. So it appears by the\r\nTable, that while the Moon is in ♍ and ♎ she rises an hour and a quarter\r\nlater every day than the former; and differs only 24, 20, 18 or 17\r\nminutes in setting. But, when she comes to ♓ and ♈, she is only 20 or 17\r\nminutes later of rising; and an hour and a quarter later in setting.\r\n\r\n278. All these things will be made plain by putting small patches on the\r\nEcliptic of a Globe, as far from one another as the Moon moves from any\r\nPoint of the celestial Ecliptic in 24 hours, which at a mean rate is\r\n[62]13-1/6 degrees; and then in turning the globe round, observe the\r\nrising and setting of the patches in the Horizon, as the Index points\r\nout the different times in the hour circle. A few of these patches are\r\nrepresented by dots at _0_ _1_ _2_ _3_ &c. on the Ecliptic, which has\r\nthe position _LUI_ when Aries rises in the East; and by the dots _0_ _1_\r\n_2_ _3_, &c. when Libra rises in the East, at which time the Ecliptic\r\nhas the position _EU_♑: making an angle of 62 degrees with the Horizon\r\nin the latter case, and an angle of no more than 15 degrees with it in\r\nthe former; supposing the Globe rectified to the Latitude of _London_.\r\n\r\n279. Having rectified the Globe, turn it until the patch at _0_, about\r\nthe beginning of ♓ Pisces on the half _LUI_ of the Ecliptic, comes to\r\nthe Eastern side of the Horizon; and then keeping the ball steady, set\r\nthe hour Index to XII, because _that_ hour may perhaps be more easily\r\nremembred than any other. Then, turn the Globe round westward, and in\r\nthat time, suppose the patch _0_ to have moved thence to _1_, 13-1/6\r\ndegrees, whilst the Earth turns once round its Axis, and you will see\r\nthat _1_ rises only about 20 minutes later than _0_ did on the day\r\nbefore. Turn the Globe round again, and in that time suppose the same\r\npatch to have moved from _1_ to _2_; and it will rise only 20 minutes\r\nlater by the hour-index than it did at _1_ on the day or turn before. At\r\nthe end of the next turn, suppose the patch to have gone from _2_ to _3_\r\nat _U_, and it will rise 20 minutes later than it did at _2_. And so on\r\nfor six turns, in which time there will scarce be two hours difference:\r\nNor would there have been so much if the 6 degrees of the Sun’s motion\r\nin that time had been allowed for. At the first Turn the patch rises\r\nsouth of the East, at the middle Turn due East, and at the last Turn\r\nnorth of the East. But these patches will be 9 hours of setting on the\r\nwestern side of the Horizon, which shews that the Moon will be so much\r\nlater of setting in that week in which she moves through these two\r\nSigns. The cause of this difference is evident; for Pisces and Aries\r\nmake only an Angle of 15 degrees with the Horizon when they rise; but\r\nthey make an Angle of 62 degrees with it when they set § 275. As the\r\nSigns Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra rise successively,\r\nthe Angle increases gradually which they make with the Horizon; and\r\ndecreases in the same proportion as they set. And for that reason, the\r\nMoon differs gradually more in the time of her rising every day whilst\r\nshe is in these Signs, and less in her setting: After which, through the\r\nother six Signs, _viz._ Scorpio, Sagittary, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces,\r\nand Aries, the rising difference becomes less every day, until it be at\r\nthe least of all, namely, in Pisces and Aries.\r\n\r\n280. The Moon goes round the Ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours; but not from\r\nChange to Change in less than 29 days 12 hours: so that she is in Pisces\r\nand Aries at least once in every Lunation, and in some Lunations twice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Moon is always Full in different Signs.\r\n\r\n           Her periodical and synodical Revolution exemplified.]\r\n\r\n281. If the Earth had no annual motion, the Sun would never appear to\r\nshift his place in the Ecliptic. And then every New Moon would fall in\r\nthe same Sign and degree of the Ecliptic, and every Full Moon in the\r\nopposite: for the Moon would go precisely round the Ecliptic from Change\r\nto Change. So that if the Moon was once Full in Pisces, or Aries, she\r\nwould always be Full when she came round to the same Sign and Degree\r\nagain. And as the Full Moon rises at Sun-set (because when any point of\r\nthe Ecliptic sets the opposite point rises) she would constantly rise\r\nwithin two hours of Sun-set during the week in which she were Full. But\r\nin the time that the Moon goes round the Ecliptic from any conjunction\r\nor opposition, the Earth goes almost a Sign forward; and therefore the\r\nSun will seem to go as far forward in that time, namely 27-1/2 degrees:\r\nso that the Moon must go 27-1/2 degrees more than round; and as much\r\nfarther as the Sun advances in that interval, which is 2-1/15 degrees,\r\nbefore she can be in conjunction with, or opposite to the Sun again.\r\nHence it is evident, that there can be but one conjunction or opposition\r\nof the Sun and Moon in a year in any particular part of the Ecliptic.\r\nThis may be familiarly exemplified by the hour and minute hands of a\r\nwatch, which are never in conjunction or opposition in that part of the\r\ndial-plate where they were so last before. And indeed if we compare the\r\ntwelve hours on the dial-plate to the twelve Signs of the Ecliptic, the\r\nhour-hand to the Sun and the minute-hand to the Moon, we shall have a\r\ntolerably near resemblance in miniature to the motions of our great\r\ncelestial Luminaries. The only difference is, that whilst the Sun goes\r\nonce round the Ecliptic the Moon makes 12-1/3 conjunctions with him: but\r\nwhilst the hour-hand goes round the dial-plate the minute-hand makes\r\nonly 11 conjunctions with it; because the minute hand moves slower in\r\nrespect of the hour-hand than the Moon does with regard to the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Harvest and Hunter’s Moon.]\r\n\r\n282. As the Moon can never be full but when she is opposite to the Sun,\r\nand the Sun is never in Virgo and Libra but in our autumnal months, ’tis\r\nplain that the Moon is never full in the opposite Signs, Pisces and\r\nAries, but in these two months. And therefore we can have only two Full\r\nMoons in the year, which rise so near the time of Sun-set for a week\r\ntogether as above-mentioned. The former of these is called the _Harvest\r\nMoon_, and the latter the _Hunter’s Moon_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Moon’s regular rising is never perceived but in\r\n           Harvest.]\r\n\r\n283. Here it will probably be asked, why we never observe this\r\nremarkable rising of the Moon but in harvest, since she is in Pisces and\r\nAries at least twelve times in the year besides; and must then rise with\r\nas little difference of time as in harvest? The answer is plain: for in\r\nwinter these Signs rise at noon; and being then only a Quarter of a\r\nCircle distant from the Sun, the Moon in them is in her first Quarter:\r\nbut when the Sun is above the Horizon the Moon’s rising is neither\r\nregarded nor perceived. In spring these Signs rise with the Sun because\r\nhe is then in them; and as the Moon changeth in them at that time of the\r\nyear, she is quite invisible. In summer they rise about mid-night, and\r\nthe Sun being then three Signs, or a Quarter of a Circle before them,\r\nthe Moon is in them about her third Quarter; when rising so late, and\r\ngiving but very little light, her rising passes unobserved. And in\r\nautumn, these Signs being opposite to the Sun, rise when he sets, with\r\nthe Moon in opposition, or at the Full, which makes her rising very\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n284. At the Equator, the North and South Poles lie in the Horizon; and\r\ntherefore the Ecliptic makes the same Angle southward with the Horizon\r\nwhen Aries rises as it does northward when Libra rises. Consequently, as\r\nthe Moon at all the fore-mentioned patches rises and sets nearly at\r\nequal Angles with the Horizon all the year round; and about 48 minutes\r\nlater every day or night than on the preceding, there can be no\r\nparticular Harvest Moon at the Equator.\r\n\r\n285. The farther that any place is from the Equator, if it be not beyond\r\nthe Polar Circle, the Angle gradually diminishes which the Ecliptic and\r\nHorizon make when Pisces and Aries rise; and therefore when the Moon is\r\nin these Signs she rises with a nearly proportionable difference later\r\nevery day than on the former; and is for that reason the more remarkable\r\nabout the Full, until we come to the Polar Circles, or 66 degrees from\r\nthe Equator; in which Latitude the Ecliptic and Horizon become\r\ncoincident, every day for a moment, at the same sidereal hour (or 3\r\nminutes 56 seconds sooner every day than the former) and the very next\r\nmoment one half of the Ecliptic containing Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces,\r\nAries, Taurus, and Gemini rises, and the opposite half sets. Therefore,\r\nwhilst the Moon is going from the beginning of Capricorn to the\r\nbeginning of Cancer, which is almost 14 days, she rises at the same\r\nsidereal hour; and in autumn just at Sun-set, because all that half of\r\nthe Ecliptic in which the Sun is at that time sets at the same sidereal\r\nhour, and the opposite half rises: that is, 3 minutes 56 seconds, of\r\nmean solar time, sooner every day than on the day before. So whilst the\r\nMoon is going from Capricorn to Cancer she rises earlier every day than\r\non the preceding; contrary to what she does at all places between the\r\npolar Circles. But during the above fourteen days, the Moon is 24\r\nsidereal hours later in setting; for the six Signs which rise all at\r\nonce on the eastern side of the Horizon are 24 hours in setting on the\r\nwestern side of it: as any one may see by making chalk-marks at the\r\nbeginning of Capricorn and of Cancer, and then, having elevated the Pole\r\n66-1/2 degrees, turn the Globe slowly round it’s Axis, and observe the\r\nrising and setting of the Ecliptic. As the beginning of Aries is equally\r\ndistant from the beginning of Cancer and of Capricorn, it is in the\r\nmiddle of that half of the Ecliptic which rises all at once. And when\r\nthe Sun is at the beginning of Libra, he is in the middle of the other\r\nhalf. Therefore, when the Sun is in Libra and the Moon in Capricorn, the\r\nMoon is a Quarter of a Circle before the Sun; opposite to him, and\r\nconsequently full in Aries, and a Quarter of a Circle behind him when in\r\nCancer. But when Libra rises Aries sets, and all that half of the\r\nEcliptic of which Aries is the middle. And therefore, at that time of\r\nthe year the Moon rises at Sun-set from her first to her third Quarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Harvest Moons regular on both sides of the Equator.]\r\n\r\n286. In northern Latitudes, the autumnal Full Moons are in Pisces and\r\nAries; and the vernal Full Moons in Virgo and Libra: in southern\r\nLatitudes just the reverse because the seasons are contrary. But Virgo\r\nand Libra rise at as small Angles with the Horizon in southern Latitudes\r\nas Pisces and Aries do in the northern; and therefore the Harvest Moons\r\nare just as regular on one side of the Equator as on the other.\r\n\r\n287. As these Signs which rise with the least Angles set with the\r\ngreatest, the vernal Full Moons differ as much in their times of rising\r\nevery night as the autumnal Full Moons differ in their times of setting;\r\nand set with as little difference as the autumnal Full Moons rise: the\r\none being in all cases the reverse of the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s Nodes.]\r\n\r\n288. Hitherto, for the sake of plainness, we have supposed the Moon to\r\nmove in the Ecliptic, from which the Sun never deviates. But the orbit\r\nin which the Moon really moves is different from the Ecliptic: one half\r\nbeing elevated 5-1/3 degrees above it, and the other half as much\r\ndepressed below it. The Moon’s orbit therefore intersects the Ecliptic\r\nin two points diametrically opposite to each other: and these\r\nintersections are called the _Moon’s Nodes_. So the Moon can never be in\r\nthe Ecliptic but when she is in either of her Nodes, which is at least\r\ntwice in every course from Change to Change, and sometimes thrice. For,\r\nas the Moon goes almost a whole Sign more than round her Orbit from\r\nChange to Change; if she passes by either Node about the time of Change,\r\nshe will pass by the other in about fourteen days after, and come round\r\nto the former Node two days again before the next Change. That Node from\r\nwhich the Moon begins to ascend northward, or above the Ecliptic, in\r\nnorthern Latitudes, is called the _Ascending Node_; and the other the\r\n_Descending Node_, because the Moon, when she passes by it, descends\r\nbelow the Ecliptic southward.\r\n\r\n289. The Moon’s oblique motion with regard to the Ecliptic causes some\r\ndifference in the times of her rising and setting from what is already\r\nmentioned. For whilst she is northward of the Ecliptic, she rises sooner\r\nand sets later than if she moved in the Ecliptic: and when she is\r\nsouthward of the Ecliptic she rises later and sets sooner. This\r\ndifference is variable even in the same Signs, because the Nodes shift\r\nbackward about 19-2/3 degrees in the Ecliptic every year; and so go\r\nround it contrary to the order of Signs in 18 years 225 days.\r\n\r\n290. When the Ascending Node is in Aries, the southern half of the\r\nMoon’s Orbit makes an Angle of 5-1/3 degrees less with the Horizon than\r\nthe Ecliptic does, when Aries rises in northern Latitudes: for which\r\nreason the Moon rises with less difference of time whilst she is in\r\nPisces and Aries than there would be if she kept in the Ecliptic. But in\r\n9 years and 112 days afterward, the Descending Node comes to Aries; and\r\nthen the Moon’s Orbit makes an Angle 5-1/3 degrees greater with the\r\nHorizon when Aries rises, than the Ecliptic does at that time; which\r\ncauses the Moon to rise with greater difference of time in Pisces and\r\nAries than if she moved in the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n291. To be a little more particular, when the Ascending Node is in\r\nAries, the Angle is only 9-2/3 degrees on the parallel of _London_ when\r\nAries rises. But when the Descending Node comes to Aries, the Angle is\r\n20-1/3 degrees; this occasions as great a difference of the Moon’s\r\nrising in the same Signs every 9 years, on the parallel of _London_, as\r\nthere would be on two parallels 10-2/3 degrees from one another, if the\r\nMoon’s course were in the Ecliptic. The following Table shews how much\r\nthe obliquity of the Moon’s Orbit affects her rising and setting on the\r\nparallel of _London_ from the 12th to the 18th day of her age; supposing\r\nher to be Full at the autumnal Equinox; and then, either in the\r\nAscending Node, highest part of her Orbit, Descending Node, or lowest\r\npart of her Orbit. _M_ signifies morning, _A_ afternoon; and the line at\r\nthe foot of the Table shews a week’s difference in rising and setting.\r\n\r\n +--------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n |        | Full in her   | In the        | Full in her   | In the lowest |\r\n |        | Ascending     | highest part  | Descending    | part of her   |\r\n |        | node.         | of her Orbit. | node.         | Orbit.        |\r\n | Moon’s +---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n |  Age   | Rises |  Sets | Rises |  Sets | Rises |  Sets | Rises |  Sets |\r\n |        |   at  |   at  |   at  |   at  |   at  |   at  |   at  |   at  |\r\n |        | H.

It may at first sight appear erroneous; since as we\r\nhave supposed the Moon to be full in either Node at the autumnal\r\nEquinox, she ought by the Table to rise just at six o’clock, or at\r\nSun-set, on the 15th day of her age; being in the Ecliptic at that time.\r\nBut it must be considered, that the Moon is only 14-1/4 days old when\r\nshe is Full; and therefore in both cases she is a little past the Node\r\non the 15th day, being above it at one time, and below it at the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The period of the Harvest Moons.]\r\n\r\n292. As there is a compleat revolution of the Nodes in 18-2/3 years,\r\nthere must be a regular period of all the Varieties which can happen in\r\nthe rising and setting of the Moon during that time. But this shifting\r\nof the Nodes never affects the Moon’s rising so much, even in her\r\nquickest descending Latitude, as not to allow us still the benefit of\r\nher rising nearer the time of Sun-set for a few days together about the\r\nFull in Harvest, than when she is Full at any other time of the year.\r\nThe following Table shews in what years the Harvest-Moons are least\r\nbeneficial as to the times of their rising, and in what years most, from\r\n1751 to 1861. The column of years under the letter _L_ are those in\r\nwhich the Harvest-Moons are least of all beneficial, because they fall\r\nabout the Descending Node: and those under _M_ are the most of all\r\nbeneficial, because they fall about the Ascending Node. In all the\r\ncolumns from _N_ to _S_ the Harvest-Moons descend gradually in the Lunar\r\nOrbit, and rise to less heights above the Horizon. From _S_ to _N_ they\r\nascend in the same proportion, and rise to greater heights above the\r\nHorizon. In both the columns under _S_ the Harvest-Moons are in the\r\nlowest part of the Moon’s Orbit, that is, farthest South of the\r\nEcliptic; and therefore stay shortest of all above the Horizon: in the\r\ncolumns under _N_ just the reverse. And in both cases, their rising,\r\nthough not at the same times, are nearly the same with regard to\r\ndifference of time, as if the Moon’s Orbit were coincident with the\r\nEcliptic.\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                                                            |\r\n |  _Years in which the Harvest-Moons are least beneficial._  |\r\n |                                                            |\r\n |  N                       L                       S         |\r\n | 1751  1752  1753  1754  1755  1756  1757  1758  1759       |\r\n | 1770  1771  1772  1773  1774  1775  1776  1777  1778       |\r\n | 1788  1789  1790  1791  1792  1793  1794  1795  1796  1797 |\r\n | 1807  1808  1809  1810  1811  1812  1813  1814  1815       |\r\n | 1826  1827  1828  1829  1830  1831  1832  1833  1834       |\r\n | 1844  1845  1846  1847  1848  1849  1850  1851  1852       |\r\n |                                                            |\r\n |         _Years in which they are most beneficial._         |\r\n |                                                            |\r\n |  S                       M                       N         |\r\n | 1760  1761  1762  1763  1764  1765  1766  1767  1768  1769 |\r\n | 1779  1780  1781  1782  1783  1784  1785  1786  1787       |\r\n | 1798  1799  1800  1801  1802  1803  1804  1805  1806       |\r\n | 1816  1817  1818  1819  1820  1821  1822  1823  1824  1825 |\r\n | 1835  1836  1837  1838  1839  1840  1841  1842  1843       |\r\n | 1853  1854  1855  1856  1857  1858  1859  1860  1861       |\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PL. VIII.]\r\n\r\n293. At the Polar Circles, when the Sun touches the Summer Tropic, he\r\ncontinues 24 hours above the Horizon; and 24 hours below it when he\r\ntouches the Winter Tropic. For the same reason the Full Moon neither\r\nrises in Summer, nor sets in Winter, considering her as moving in the\r\nEcliptic. For the Winter Full Moon being as high in the Ecliptic as the\r\nSummer Sun, must therefore continue as long above the Horizon; and the\r\nSummer Full Moon being as low in the Ecliptic as the Winter Sun, can no\r\nmore rise than he does. But these are only the two Full Moons which\r\nhappen about the Tropics, for all the others rise and set. In Summer the\r\nFull Moons are low, and their stay is short above the Horizon, when the\r\nnights are short, and we have least occasion for Moon-light: in Winter\r\nthey go high, and stay long, above the Horizon when the nights are long,\r\nand we want the greatest quantity of Moon-light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The long continuance of Moon-light at the Poles.\r\n\r\n           Fig. V.]\r\n\r\n294. At the Poles, one half of the Ecliptic never sets, and the other\r\nhalf never rises: and therefore, as the Sun is always half a year in\r\ndescribing one half of the Ecliptic, and as long in going through the\r\nother half, ’tis natural to imagine that the Sun continues half a year\r\ntogether above the Horizon of each Pole in it’s turn, and as long below\r\nit; rising to one Pole when he sets to the other. This would be exactly\r\nthe case if there were no refraction: but by the Atmosphere’s refracting\r\nthe Sun’s rays, he becomes visible some days sooner § 183, and continues\r\nsome days longer in sight than he would otherwise do: so that he appears\r\nabove the Horizon of either Pole before he has got below the Horizon of\r\nthe other. And, as he never goes more than 23-1/2 degrees below the\r\nHorizon of the Poles, they have very little dark night: it being\r\ntwilight there as well as at all other places till the Sun be 18 degrees\r\nbelow the Horizon, § 177. The Full Moon being always opposite to the\r\nSun, can never be seen while the Sun is above the Horizon, except when\r\nthe Moon falls in the northern half of her Orbit; for whenever any point\r\nof the Ecliptic rises the opposite point sets. Therefore, as the Sun is\r\nabove the Horizon of the north Pole from the 20th of _March_ till the\r\n23d of _September_, it is plain that the Moon, when Full, being opposite\r\nto the Sun, must be below the Horizon during that half of the year. But\r\nwhen the Sun is in the southern half of the Ecliptic he never rises to\r\nthe north Pole, during which half of the year, every Full Moon happens\r\nin some part of the northern half of the Ecliptic, which never sets.\r\nConsequently, as the polar Inhabitants never see the Full Moon in\r\nSummer, they have her always in the Winter, before, at, and after the\r\nFull, shining for 14 of our days and nights. And when the Sun is at his\r\ngreatest depression below the Horizon, being then in Capricorn, the Moon\r\nis at her First Quarter in Aries, Full in Cancer, and at her Third\r\nQuarter in Libra. And as the beginning of Aries is the rising point of\r\nthe Ecliptic, Cancer the highest, and Libra the setting point, the Moon\r\nrises at her First Quarter in Aries, is most elevated above the Horizon,\r\nand Full in Cancer, and sets at the beginning of Libra in her Third\r\nQuarter, having continued visible for 14 diurnal rotations of the Earth.\r\nThus the Poles are supplied one half of the winter time with constant\r\nMoon-light in the Sun’s absence; and only lose sight of the Moon from\r\nher Third to her First Quarter, while she gives but very little light;\r\nand could be but of little, and sometimes of no service to them. A bare\r\nview of the Figure will make this plain; in which let _S_ be the Sun,\r\n_e_ the Earth in Summer when it’s north Pole _n_ inclines toward the\r\nSun, and _E_ the Earth in Winter, when it’s north Pole declines from\r\nhim. _SEN_ and _NWS_ is the Horizon of the north Pole, which is\r\ncoincident with the Equator; and, in both these positions of the Earth,\r\n♈♋♎♑ is the Moon’s Orbit, in which she goes round the Earth, according\r\nto the order of the letters _abcd_, _ABCD_. When the Moon is at _a_ she\r\nis in her Third Quarter to the Earth at _e_, and just rising to the\r\nnorth Pole _n_; at _b_ she changes, and is at the greatest height above\r\nthe Horizon, as the Sun likewise is; at _c_ she is in her First Quarter,\r\nsetting below the Horizon; and is lowest of all under it at _d_, when\r\nopposite to the Sun, and her enlightened side toward the Earth. But then\r\nshe is full in view to the south Pole _p_; which is as much turned from\r\nthe Sun as the north Pole inclines towards him. Thus in our Summer, the\r\nMoon is above the Horizon of the north Pole whilst she describes the\r\nnorthern half of the Ecliptic ♈♋♎, or from her Third Quarter to her\r\nFirst; and below the Horizon during the progress through the southern\r\nhalf ♎♑♈; highest at the Change, most depressed at the Full. But in\r\nwinter, when the Earth is at _E_, and it’s north Pole declines from the\r\nSun, the New Moon at _D_ is at her greatest depression below the Horizon\r\n_NWS_, and the Full Moon at _B_ at her greatest height above it; rising\r\nat her First Quarter _A_, and keeping above the Horizon till she comes\r\nto her Third Quarter _C_. At a mean state she is 23-1/2 degrees above\r\nthe Horizon at _B_ and _b_, and as much below it at _D_ and _d_, equal\r\nto the inclination of the Earth’s Axis _F_. _S_♋ and _S_♑ are, as it\r\nwere, a ray of light proceeding from the Sun to the Earth; and shews\r\nthat when the Earth is at _e_, the Sun is above the Horizon, vertical to\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer; and when the Earth is at _E_, he is below the\r\nHorizon, vertical to the Tropic of Capricorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n_J.

The cause of the Tides was discovered by KEPLER, who, in his\r\n_Introduction to the Physics of the Heavens_, thus explains it: “The Orb\r\nof the attracting power, which is in the Moon, is extended as far as the\r\nEarth; and draws the waters under the torrid Zone, acting upon places\r\nwhere it is vertical, insensibly on confined seas and bays, but sensibly\r\non the ocean whose beds are large, and the waters have the liberty of\r\nreciprocation; that is, of rising and falling.” And in the 70th page of\r\nhis _Lunar Astronomy_——“But the cause of the Tides of the Sea appears to\r\nbe the bodies of the Sun and Moon drawing the waters of the Sea.” This\r\nhint being given, the immortal Sir ISAAC NEWTON improved it, and wrote\r\nso amply on the subject, as to make the Theory of the Tides in a manner\r\nquite his own; by discovering the cause of their rising on the side of\r\nthe Earth opposite to the Moon. For KEPLER believed that the presence of\r\nthe Moon occasioned an impulse which caused another in her absence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explained on the Newtonian principles.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n296. It has been already shewn § 106, that the power of gravity\r\ndiminishes as the square of the distance increases; and therefore the\r\nwaters at _Z_ on the side of the Earth _ABCDEFGH_ next the Moon _M_ are\r\nmore attracted than the central parts of the Earth _O_ by the Moon, and\r\nthe central parts are more attracted by her than the waters on the\r\nopposite side of the Earth at _n_: and therefore the distance between\r\nthe Earth’s center and the waters on it’s surface under and opposite to\r\nthe Moon will be increased. For, let there be three bodies at _H_, _O_,\r\nand _D_: if they are all equally attracted by the body _M_, they will\r\nall move equally fast toward it, their mutual distances from each other\r\ncontinuing the same. If the attraction of _M_ is unequal, then that body\r\nwhich is most strongly attracted will move fastest, and this will\r\nincrease it’s distance from the other body. Therefore, by the law of\r\ngravitation, _M_ will attract _H_ more strongly than it does _O_, by\r\nwhich, the distance between _H_ and _O_ will be increased: and a\r\nspectator on _O_ will perceive _H_ rising higher toward _Z_. In like\r\nmanner, _O_ being more strongly attracted than _D_, it will move farther\r\ntowards _M_ than _D_ does: consequently, the distance between _O_ and\r\n_D_ will be increased; and a spectator on _O_, not perceiving his own\r\nmotion, will see _D_ receding farther from him towards _n_: all effects\r\nand appearances being the same whether _D_ recedes from _O_ or _O_ from\r\n_D_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IX.]\r\n\r\n297. Suppose now there is a number of bodies, as _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_,\r\n_E_, _F_, _G_, _H_ placed round _O_, so as to form a flexible or fluid\r\nring: then, as the whole is attracted towards _M_, the parts at _H_ and\r\n_D_ will have their distance from _O_ increased; whilst the parts at _B_\r\nand _F_, being nearly at the same distance from _M_ as _O_ is, these\r\nparts will not recede from one another; but rather, by the oblique\r\nattraction of _M_, they will approach nearer to _O_. Hence, the fluid\r\nring will form itself into an ellipse _ZIBLnKFNZ_, whose longer Axis\r\n_nOZ_ produced will pass through _M_, and it’s shorter Axis _BOF_ will\r\nterminate in _B_ and _F_. Let the ring be filled with bodies, so as to\r\nform a flexible or fluid sphere round _O_; then, as the whole moves\r\ntoward _M_, the fluid sphere being lengthned at _Z_ and _n_, will assume\r\nan oblong or oval form. If _M_ is the Moon, _O_ the Earth’s center,\r\n_ABCDEFGH_ the Sea covering the Earth’s surface, ’tis evident by the\r\nabove reasoning, that whilst the Earth by it’s gravity falls toward the\r\nMoon, the Water directly below her at _B_ will swell and rise gradually\r\ntowards her: also, the Water at _D_ will recede from the center\r\n[strictly speaking, the center recedes from _D_] and rise on the\r\nopposite side of the Earth: whilst the Water at _B_ and _F_ is\r\ndepressed, and falls below the former level. Hence, as the Earth turns\r\nround it’s Axis from the Moon to the Moon again in 24-3/4 hours, there\r\nwill be two tides of flood and two of ebb in that time, as we find by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\n298. As this explanation of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea is deduced\r\nfrom the Earth’s constantly falling toward the Moon by the power of\r\ngravity, some may find a difficulty in conceiving how this is possible\r\nwhen the Moon is Full, or in opposition to the Sun; since the Earth\r\nrevolves about the Sun, and must continually fall towards it, and\r\ntherefore cannot fall contrary ways at the same time: or if the Earth is\r\nconstantly falling towards the Moon, they must come together at last. To\r\nremove this difficulty, let it be considered, that it is not the center\r\nof the Earth that describes the annual orbit round the Sun; but the\r\n[63]common center of gravity of the Earth and Moon together: and that\r\nwhilst the Earth is moving round the Sun, it also describes a Circle\r\nround that centre of gravity; going as many times round it in one\r\nrevolution about the Sun as there are Lunations or courses of the Moon\r\nround the Earth in a year: and therefore, the Earth is constantly\r\nfalling towards the Moon from a tangent to the Circle it describes round\r\nthe said common center of gravity. Let _M_ be the Moon, _TW_ part of the\r\nMoon’s Orbit, and _C_ the center of gravity of the Earth and Moon:\r\nwhilst the Moon goes round her Orbit, the center of the Earth describes\r\nthe Circle _ged_ round _C_, to which Circle _gak_ is a tangent: and\r\ntherefore, when the Moon has gone from _M_ to a little past _W_, the\r\nEarth has moved from _g_ to _e_; and in that time has fallen towards the\r\nMoon, from the tangent at _a_ to _e_; and so round the whole Circle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IX.]\r\n\r\n299. The Sun’s influence in raising the Tides is but small in comparison\r\nof the Moon’s: For though the Earth’s diameter bears a considerable\r\nproportion to it’s distance from the Moon, it is next to nothing when\r\ncompared with the distance of the Sun. And therefore, the difference of\r\nthe Sun’s attraction on the sides of the Earth under and opposite to\r\nhim, is much less than the difference of the Moon’s attraction on the\r\nsides of the Earth under and opposite to her: and therefore the Moon\r\nmust raise the Tides much higher than they can be raised by the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Tides are not highest when the Moon is on the Meridian.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n300. On this Theory so far as we have explained it, the Tides ought to\r\nbe highest directly under and opposite to the Moon; that is, when the\r\nMoon is due north and south. But we find, that in open Seas, where the\r\nwater flows freely, the Moon _M_ is generally past the north and south\r\nMeridian as at _p_ when it is high water at _Z_ and at _n_. The reason\r\nis obvious; for though the Moon’s attraction was to cease altogether\r\nwhen she was past the Meridian, yet the motion of ascent communicated to\r\nthe water before that time would make it continue to rise for some time\r\nafter; much more must it do so when the attraction is only diminished:\r\nas a little impulse given to a moving ball will cause it still move\r\nfarther than otherwise it could have done. And as experience shews, that\r\nthe day is hotter about three in the afternoon, than when the Sun is on\r\nthe Meridian, because of the increment made to the heat already\r\nimparted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor always answer to her being at the same distance from it.]\r\n\r\n301. The Tides answer not always to the same distance of the Moon from\r\nthe Meridian at the same places; but are variously affected by the\r\naction of the Sun, which brings them on sooner when the Moon is in her\r\nfirst and third Quarters, and keeps them back later when she is in her\r\nsecond and fourth: because, in the former case, the Tide raised by the\r\nSun alone would be earlier than the Tide raised by the Moon; and in the\r\nlatter case later.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spring and neap Tides.\r\n\r\n           PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n           Fig. VI.]\r\n\r\n302. The Moon goes round the Earth in an elliptic Orbit, and therefore\r\nshe approaches nearer to the Earth than her mean distance, and recedes\r\nfarther from it, in every Lunar Month. When she is nearest: she attracts\r\nstrongest, and so rises the Tides most; the contrary happens when she is\r\nfarthest, because of her weaker attraction. When both Luminaries are in\r\nthe Equator, and the Moon in _Perigeo_, or at her least distance from\r\nthe Earth, she raises the Tides highest of all, especially at her\r\nConjunction and opposition; both because the equatoreal parts have the\r\ngreatest centrifugal force from their describing the largest Circle, and\r\nfrom the concurring actions of the Sun and Moon. At the Change, the\r\nattractive forces of the Sun and Moon being united, they diminish the\r\ngravity of the waters under the Moon, which is also diminished on the\r\nother side, by means of a greater centrifugal force. At the full, whilst\r\nthe Moon raises the Tide under and opposite to her, the Sun acting in\r\nthe same line, raises the Tide under and opposite to him; whence their\r\nconjoint effect is the same as at the Change; and in both cases,\r\noccasion what we call _the Spring Tides_. But at the Quarters the Sun’s\r\naction on the waters at _O_ and _H_ diminishes the Moon’s action on the\r\nwaters at _Z_ and _N_; so that they rise a little under and opposite to\r\nthe Sun at _O_ and _H_, and fall as much under and opposite to the Moon\r\nat _Z_ and _N_; making what we call _the Neap Tides_, because the Sun\r\nand Moon then act cross-wise to each other. But, strictly speaking,\r\nthese Tides happen not till some time after; because in this, as in\r\nother cases, § 300, the actions do not produce the greatest effect when\r\nthey are at the strongest, but some time afterward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not greatest at the Equinoxes, and why.]\r\n\r\n303. The Sun being nearer the Earth in Winter than in Summer, § 205, is\r\nof course nearer to it in _February_ and _October_ than in _March_ and\r\n_September_: and therefore the greatest Tides happen not till some time\r\nafter the autumnal Equinox, and return a little before the vernal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tides would not immediately cease upon the annihilation\r\n           of the Sun and Moon.]\r\n\r\nThe Sea being thus put in motion, would continue to ebb and flow for\r\nseveral times, even though the Sun and Moon were annihilated, or their\r\ninfluence should cease: as if a bason of water were agitated, the water\r\nwould continue to move for some time after the bason was left to stand\r\nstill. Or like a Pendulum, which having been put in motion by the hand,\r\ncontinues to make several vibrations without any new impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lunar day, what.\r\n\r\n           The Tides rise to unequal heights in the same day, and why.\r\n\r\n           PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n           Fig. III, IV, V.\r\n\r\n           Fig. III.\r\n\r\n           Fig. IV.\r\n\r\n           Fig. V.]\r\n\r\n304. When the Moon is in the Equator, the Tides are equally high in both\r\nparts of the lunar day, or time of the Moon’s revolving from the\r\nMeridian to the Meridian again, which is 24 hours 48 minutes. But as the\r\nMoon declines from the Equator towards either Pole, the Tides are\r\nalternately higher and lower at places having north or south Latitude.\r\nFor one of the highest elevations, which is that under the Moon, follows\r\nher towards the same Pole, and the other declines towards the opposite;\r\neach describing parallels as far distant from the Equator, on opposite\r\nsides, as the Moon declines from it to either side; and consequently,\r\nthe parallels described by these elevations of the water are twice as\r\nmany degrees from one another, as the Moon is from the Equator;\r\nincreasing their distance as the Moon increases her declination, till it\r\nbe at the greatest, when the said parallels are, at a mean state, 47\r\ndegrees from one another: and on that day, the Tides are most unequal in\r\ntheir heights. As the Moon returns toward the Equator, the parallels\r\ndescribed by the opposite elevations approach towards each other, until\r\nthe Moon comes to the Equator, and then they coincide. As the Moon\r\ndeclines toward the opposite Pole, at equal distances, each elevation\r\ndescribes the same parallel in the other part of the lunar day, which\r\nit’s opposite elevation described before. Whilst the Moon has north\r\ndeclination, the greatest Tides in the northern Hemisphere are when she\r\nis above the Horizon; and the reverse whilst her declination is south.\r\nLet _NESQ_ be the Earth, _NCS_ it’s Axis, _EQ_ the Equator, _T_♋ the\r\nTropic of Cancer, _t_♑ the Tropic of Capricorn, _ab_ the arctic Circle,\r\n_cd_ the Antarctic, _N_ the north Pole, _S_ the south Pole, _M_ the\r\nMoon, _F_ and _G_ the two eminences of water, whose lowest parts are at\r\n_a_ and _d_ (Fig. III.) at _N_ and _S_ (Fig. IV.) and at _b_ and _c_\r\n(Fig. V.) always 90 degrees from the highest. Now when the Moon is in\r\nher greatest north declination at _M_, the highest elevation _G_ under\r\nher, is on the Tropic of Cancer _T_♋, and the opposite elevation _F_ on\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn _t_♑; and these two elevations describe the\r\nTropics by the Earth’s diurnal rotation. All places in the northern\r\nHemisphere _ENQ_ have the highest Tides when they come into the position\r\n_b_♋_Q_, under the Moon; and the lowest Tides when the Earth’s diurnal\r\nrotation carries them into the position _aTE_, on the side opposite to\r\nthe Moon; the reverse happens at the same time in the southern\r\nHemisphere _ESQ_, as is evident to sight. The Axis of the Tides _aCd_\r\nhas now it’s Poles _a_ and _d_ (being always 90 degrees from the highest\r\nelevations) in the arctic and antarctic Circles; and therefore ’tis\r\nplain, that at these Circles there is but one Tide of Flood, and one of\r\nEbb, in the lunar day. For, when the point _a_ revolves half round to\r\n_b_, in 12 lunar hours, it has a Tide of Flood; but when it comes to the\r\nsame point _a_ again in 12 hours more, it has the lowest ebb. In seven\r\ndays afterward, the Moon _M_ comes to the equinoctial Circle, and is\r\nover the Equator _EQ_, when both Elevations describe the Equator; and in\r\nboth Hemispheres, at equal distances from the Equator, the Tides are\r\nequally high in both parts of the lunar day. The whole Phenomena being\r\nreversed when the Moon has south declination to what they were when her\r\ndeclination was north, require no farther description.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. VI.\r\n\r\n           When both Tides are equally high in the same day, they arrive\r\n           at unequal intervals of Time; and _vice versa_.]\r\n\r\n305. In the three last-mentioned Figures, the Earth is orthographically\r\nprojected on the plane of the Meridian; but in order to describe a\r\nparticular Phenomenon we now project it on the plane of the Ecliptic.\r\nLet _HZON_ be the Earth and Sea, _FED_ the Equator, _T_ the Tropic of\r\nCancer, _C_ the arctic Circle, _P_ the north Pole, and the Curves _1_,\r\n_2_, _3_, _&c._ 24 Meridians, or hour Circles, intersecting each other\r\nin the Poles; _AGM_ is the Moon’s orbit, _S_ the Sun, _M_ the Moon, _Z_\r\nthe Water elevated under the Moon, and _N_ the opposite equal Elevation.\r\nAs the lowest parts of the Water are always 90 degrees from the highest,\r\nwhen the Moon is in either of the Tropics (as at _M_) the Elevation _Z_\r\nis on the Tropic of Capricorn, and the opposite Elevation _N_ on the\r\nTropic of Cancer, the low-water Circle _HCO_ touches the polar Circles\r\nat _C_; and the high-water Circle _ETP6_ goes over the Poles at _P_, and\r\ndivides every parallel of Latitude into two equal segments. In this case\r\nthe Tides upon every parallel are alternately higher and lower; but they\r\nreturn in equal times: the point _T_, for example, on the Tropic of\r\nCancer (where the depth of the Tide is represented by the breadth of the\r\ndark shade) has a shallower Tide of Flood at _T_ than when it revolves\r\nhalf round from thence to _6_, according to the order of the numeral\r\nFigures; but it revolves as soon from _6_ to _T_ as it did from _T_ to\r\n_6_. When the Moon is in the Equinoctial, the Elevations _Z_ and _N_ are\r\ntransferred to the Equator at _O_ and _H_, and the high and low-water\r\nCircles are got into each other’s former places; in which case the Tides\r\nreturn in unequal times, but are equally high in both parts of the lunar\r\nday: for a place at _1_ (under _D_) revolving as formerly, goes sooner\r\nfrom _1_ to _11_ (under _F_) than from _11_ to _1_, because the parallel\r\nit describes is cut into unequal segments by the high-water Circle\r\n_HCO_: but the points 1 and 11 being equidistant from the Pole of the\r\nTides at _C_, which is directly under the Pole of the Moon’s orbit\r\n_MGA_, the Elevations are equally high in both parts of the day.\r\n\r\n306. And thus it appears, that as the Tides are governed by the Moon,\r\nthey must turn on the Axis of the Moon’s orbit, which is inclined 23-1/2\r\ndegrees to the Earth’s Axis at a mean state: and therefore the Poles of\r\nthe Tides must be so many degrees from the Poles of the Earth, or in\r\nopposite points of the polar Circles, going round these Circles in every\r\nlunar day. ’Tis true that according to Fig. IV. when the Moon is\r\nvertical to the Equator _ECQ_, the Poles of the Tides seem to fall in\r\nwith the Poles of the World _N_ and _S_: but when we consider that _FHG_\r\nis under the Moon’s orbit, it will appear, that when the Moon is over\r\n_H_, in the Tropic of Capricorn, the north Pole of the Tides, (which can\r\nbe no more than 90 degrees from under the Moon) must be at _c_ in the\r\narctic Circle, not at _N_; the north Pole of the Earth; and as the Moon\r\nascends from _H_ to _G_ in her orbit, the north Pole of the Tides must\r\nshift from _c_ to _a_ in the arctic Circle; and the South Pole as much\r\nin the antarctic.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be doubted, but that the Earth’s quick rotation brings the\r\npoles of the Tides nearer to the Poles of the World, than they would be\r\nif the Earth were at rest, and the Moon revolved about it only once a\r\nmonth; for otherwise the Tides would be more unequal in their heights,\r\nand times of their returns, than we find they are. But how near the\r\nEarth’s rotation may bring the Poles of it’s Axis and those of the Tides\r\ntogether, or how far the preceding Tides may affect those which follow,\r\nso as to make them keep up nearly to the same heights, and times of\r\nebbing and flowing, is a problem more fit to be solved by observation\r\nthan by theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To know at what times we may expect the greatest and least\r\n           Tides.]\r\n\r\n307. Those who have opportunity to make observations, and choose to\r\nsatisfy themselves whether the Tides are really affected in the above\r\nmanner by the different positions of the Moon; especially as to the\r\nunequal times of their returns, may take this general rule for knowing,\r\nwhen they ought to be so affected. When the Earth’s Axis inclines to the\r\nMoon, the northern Tides, if not retarded in their passage through\r\nShoals and Channels, nor affected by the Winds, ought to be greatest\r\nwhen the Moon is above the Horizon, least when she is below it; and\r\nquite the reverse when the Earth’s Axis declines from her: but in both\r\ncases, at equal intervals of time. When the Earth’s Axis inclines\r\nsidewise to the Moon, both Tides are equally high, but they happen at\r\nunequal intervals of time. In every Lunation the Earth’s Axis inclines\r\nonce to the Moon, once from her, and twice sidewise to her, as it does\r\nto the Sun every year; because the Moon goes round the Ecliptic every\r\nmonth, and the Sun but once in a year. In Summer, the Earth’s Axis\r\ninclines towards the Moon when New; and therefore the day-tides in the\r\nnorth ought to be highest, and night-tides lowest about the Change: at\r\nthe Full the reverse. At the Quarters they ought to be equally high, but\r\nunequal in their returns; because the Earth’s Axis then inclines\r\nsidewise to the Moon. In winter the Phenomena are the same at Full-Moon\r\nas in Summer at New. In Autumn the Earth’s Axis inclines sidewise to the\r\nMoon when New and Full; therefore the Tides ought to be equally high,\r\nand unequal in their returns at these times. At the first Quarter the\r\nTides of Flood should be least when the Moon is above the Horizon,\r\ngreatest when she is below it; and the reverse at her third Quarter. In\r\nSpring, Phenomena of the first Quarter answer to those of the third\r\nQuarter in Autumn; and _vice versa_. The nearer any time is to either of\r\nthese seasons, the more the Tides partake of the Phenomena of these\r\nseasons; and in the middle between any two of them the Tides are at a\r\nmean state between those of both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Tides rise higher in Rivers than in the Sea.]\r\n\r\n308. In open Seas, the Tides rise but to very small heights in\r\nproportion to what they do in wide-mouthed rivers, opening in the\r\nDirection of the Stream of Tide. For, in Channels growing narrower\r\ngradually, the water is accumulated by the opposition of the contracting\r\nBank. Like a gentle wind, little felt on an open plain, but strong and\r\nbrisk in a street; especially if the wider end of the street be next the\r\nplain, and in the way of the wind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tides happen at all distances of the Moon from the\r\n           Meridian at different places, and why.]\r\n\r\n309. The Tides are so retarded in their passage through different Shoals\r\nand Channels, and otherwise so variously affected by striking against\r\nCapes and Headlands, that to different places they happen at all\r\ndistances of the Moon from the Meridian; consequently at all hours of\r\nthe lunar day. The Tide propagated by the Moon in the _German_ ocean,\r\nwhen she is three hours past the Meridian, takes 12 hours to come from\r\nthence to _London_ bridge; where it arrives by the time that a new Tide\r\nis raised in the ocean. And therefore when the Moon has north\r\ndeclination, and we should expect the Tide at _London_ to be greatest\r\nwhen the Moon is above the Horizon, we find it is least; and the\r\ncontrary when she has south declination. At several places ’tis high\r\nwater three hours before the Moon comes to the Meridian; but that Tide\r\nwhich the Moon pushes as it were before her, is only the Tide opposite\r\nto that which was raised by her when she was nine hours past the\r\nopposite Meridian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Water never rises in Lakes.]\r\n\r\n310. There are no Tides in Lakes, because they are generally so small\r\nthat when the Moon is vertical she attracts every part of them alike,\r\nand therefore by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it\r\ncan be raised higher than another. The _Mediterranean_ and _Baltic_ Seas\r\nsuffer very small elevations, because the Inlets by which they\r\ncommunicate with the ocean are so narrow, that they cannot, in so short\r\na time, receive or discharge enough to raise or sink their surfaces\r\nsensibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon raises Tides in the Air.\r\n\r\n           Why the Mercury in the Barometer is not affected by the aerial\r\n           Tides.]\r\n\r\n311. Air being lighter than Water, and the surface of the Atmosphere\r\nbeing nearer to the Moon than the surface of the Sea, it cannot be\r\ndoubted that the Moon raises much higher Tides in the Air than in the\r\nSea. And therefore many have wondered why the Mercury does not sink in\r\nthe Barometer when the Moon’s action on the particles of Air makes them\r\nlighter as she passes over the Meridian. But we must consider, that as\r\nthese particles are rendered lighter, a greater number of them is\r\naccumulated, until the deficiency of gravity be made up by the height of\r\nthe column; and then there is an _equilibrium_, and consequently an\r\nequal pressure upon the Mercury as before; so that it cannot be affected\r\nby the aerial Tides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Eclipses: Their Number and Periods. A large Catalogue of Ancient and\r\n                           Modern Eclipses._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A shadow, what.]\r\n\r\n312. Every Planet and Satellite is illuminated by the Sun; and casts a\r\nshadow towards that point of the Heavens which is opposite to the Sun.\r\nThis shadow is nothing but a privation of light in the space hid from\r\nthe Sun by the opake body that intercepts his rays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, what.]\r\n\r\n313. When the Sun’s light is so intercepted by the Moon, that to any\r\nplace of the Earth the Sun appears partly or wholly covered, he is said\r\nto undergo an Eclipse; though properly speaking, ’tis only an Eclipse of\r\nthat part of the Earth where the Moon’s shadow or [64]Penumbra falls.\r\nWhen the Earth comes between the Sun and Moon, the Moon falls into the\r\nEarth’s shadow; and having no light of her own, she suffers a real\r\nEclipse from the interception of the Sun’s rays. When the Sun is\r\neclipsed to us, the Moon’s Inhabitants on the side next the Earth (if\r\nany such there be) see her shadow like a dark spot travelling over the\r\nEarth, about twice as fast as its equatoreal parts move, and the same\r\nway as they move. When the Moon is in an Eclipse, the Sun appears\r\neclipsed to her, total to all those parts on which the Earth’s shadow\r\nfalls, and of as long continuance as they are in the shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate X.\r\n\r\n_J. Ferguson delin._      _J. Mynde Sculp._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof that the Earth and Moon are globular bodies.]\r\n\r\n314. That the Earth is spherical (for the hills take off no more from\r\nthe roundness of the Earth, than grains of dust do from the roundness of\r\na common Globe) is evident from the figure of its shadow on the Moon;\r\nwhich is always bounded by a circular line, although the Earth is\r\nincessantly turning its different sides to the Moon, and very seldom\r\nshews the same side to her in different Eclipses, because they seldom\r\nhappen at the same hours. Were the Earth shaped like a round flat plate,\r\nits shadow would only be circular when either of its sides directly\r\nfaced the Moon; and more or less elliptical as the Earth happened to be\r\nturned more or less obliquely towards the Moon when she is eclipsed. The\r\nMoon’s different Phases prove her to be round § 254; for, as she keeps\r\nstill the same side towards the earth, if that side were flat, as it\r\nappears to be, she would never be visible from the third Quarter to the\r\nfirst; and from the first Quarter to the third, she would appear as\r\nround as when we say she is Full: because at the end of her first\r\nQuarter the Sun’s light would come as suddenly on all her side next the\r\nEarth, as it does on a flat wall, and go off as abruptly at the end of\r\nher third Quarter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And that the Sun is much bigger than the Earth, and the Moon\r\n           much less.]\r\n\r\n315. If the Earth and Sun were equally big, the Earth’s shadow would be\r\ninfinitely extended, and all of the same breadth; and the Planet Mars,\r\nin either of its nodes and opposite to the Sun, would be eclipsed in the\r\nEarth’s shadow. Were the Earth bigger than the Sun, it’s shadow would\r\nincrease in breadth the farther it was extended, and would eclipse the\r\ngreat Planets Jupiter and Saturn, with all their Moons, when they were\r\nopposite to the Sun. But as Mars in opposition never falls into the\r\nEarth’s shadow, although he is not then above 42 millions of miles from\r\nthe Earth, ’tis plain that the Earth is much less than the Sun; for\r\notherwise it’s shadow could not end in a point at so small a distance.\r\nIf the Sun and Moon were equally big, the Moon’s shadow would go on to\r\nthe Earth with an equal breadth, and cover a portion of the Earth’s\r\nsurface more than 2000 miles broad, even if it fell directly against the\r\nEarth’s center, as seen from the Moon: and much more if it fell\r\nobliquely on the Earth: but the Moon’s shadow is seldom 150 miles broad\r\nat the Earth, unless when it falls very obliquely on the Earth, in total\r\nEclipses of the Sun. In annular Eclipses, the Moon’s real shadow ends in\r\na point at some distance from the Earth. The Moon’s small distance from\r\nthe Earth, and the shortness of her shadow, prove her to be less than\r\nthe Sun. And, as the Earth’s shadow is large enough to cover the Moon,\r\nif her diameter was three times as large as it is (which is evident from\r\nher long continuance in the shadow when she goes through it’s center)\r\n’tis plain, that the Earth is much bigger than the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The primary Planets never eclipse one another.\r\n\r\n           PLATE X.]\r\n\r\n316. Though all opake bodies on which the Sun shines have their shadows,\r\nyet such is the bulk of the Sun, and the distances of the Planets, that\r\nthe primary Planets can never eclipse one another. A Primary can eclipse\r\nonly it’s secondary, or be eclipsed by it; and never but when in\r\nopposition or conjunction with the Sun. The primary Planets are very\r\nseldom in these positions, but the Sun and Moon are so every month:\r\nwhence one may imagine that these two Luminaries should be eclipsed\r\nevery month. But there are few Eclipses in respect of the number of New\r\nand Full Moons; the reason of which we shall now explain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why there are so few Eclipses.\r\n\r\n           The Moon’s Nodes.\r\n\r\n           Limits of Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n317. If the Moon’s Orbit were coincident with the Plane of the Ecliptic,\r\nin which the Earth always moves and the Sun appears to move, the Moon’s\r\nshadow would fall upon the Earth at every Change, and eclipse the Sun to\r\nsome parts of the Earth. In like manner the Moon would go through the\r\nmiddle of the Earth’s shadow, and be eclipsed at every Full; but with\r\nthis difference, that she would be totally darkened for above an hour\r\nand half; whereas the Sun never was above four minutes totally eclipsed\r\nby the interposition of the Moon. But one half of the Moon’s Orbit, is\r\nelevated 5-1/3 degrees above the Ecliptic, and the other half as much\r\ndepressed below it: consequently, the Moon’s Orbit intersects the\r\nEcliptic in two opposite points called _the Moon’s Nodes_, as has been\r\nalready taken notice of § 288. When these points are in a right line\r\nwith the center of the Sun at New or Full Moon, the Sun, Moon, and Earth\r\nare all in a right line; and if the Moon be then New, her shadow falls\r\nupon the Earth; if Full the Earth’s shadow falls upon her. When the Sun\r\nand Moon are more than 17 degrees from either of the Nodes at the time\r\nof Conjunction, the Moon is then too high or too low in her Orbit to\r\ncast any part of her shadow upon the Earth. And when the Sun is more\r\nthan 12 degrees from either of the Nodes at the time of Full Moon, the\r\nMoon is too high or too low in her Orbit to go through any part of the\r\nEarth’s shadow: and in both these cases there will be no Eclipse. But\r\nwhen the Moon is less than 17 degrees from either Node at the time of\r\nConjunction, her shadow or Penumbra falls more or less upon the Earth,\r\nas she is more or less within this limit. And when she is less than 12\r\ndegrees from either Node at the time of opposition, she goes through a\r\ngreater or less portion of the Earth’s shadow, as she is more or less\r\nwithin this limit. Her Orbit contains 360 degrees; of which 17, the\r\nlimit of solar Eclipses on either side of the Nodes, and 12 the limit of\r\nlunar Eclipses, are but small portions: and as the Sun commonly passes\r\nby the Nodes but twice in a year, it is no wonder that we have so many\r\nNew and Full Moons without Eclipses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           PLATE X.\r\n\r\n           Line of the Nodes.]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, let _ABCD_ be the _Ecliptic_, _RSTU_ a Circle lying\r\nin the same Plane with the Ecliptic, and _VWXY_ the _Moon’s Orbit_, all\r\nthrown into an oblique view, which gives them an elliptical shape to the\r\neye. One half of the Moon’s Orbit, as _VWX_, is always below the\r\nEcliptic, and the other half _XYV_ above it. The points _V_ and _X_,\r\nwhere the Moon’s Orbit intersects the Circle _RSTU_, which lies even\r\nwith the Ecliptic, are the _Moon’s Nodes_; and a right line as _XEV_\r\ndrawn from one to the other, through the Earth’s center, is the _Line of\r\nthe Nodes_, which is carried almost parallel to itself round the Sun in\r\na year.\r\n\r\nIf the Moon moved round the Earth in the Orbit _RSTU_, which is\r\ncoincident with the Plane of the Ecliptic, her shadow would fall upon\r\nthe Earth every time she is in conjunction with the Sun; and at every\r\nopposition she would go through the Earth’s shadow. Were this the case,\r\nthe Sun would be eclipsed at every Change, and the Moon at every Full,\r\nas already mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut although the Moon’s shadow _N_ must fall upon the Earth at _a_, when\r\nthe Earth is at _E_, and the Moon in conjunction with the Sun at _i_,\r\nbecause she is then very near one of her Nodes; and at her opposition\r\n_n_ she must go through the Earth’s shadow _I_, because she is then near\r\nthe other Node; yet, in the time that she goes round the Earth to her\r\nnext Change, according to the order of the letters _XYVW_, the Earth\r\nadvances from _E_ to _e_, according to the order of the letters _EFGH_,\r\nand the line of the Nodes _VEX_ being carried nearly parallel to itself,\r\nbrings the point _f_ of the Moon’s Orbit in conjunction with the Sun at\r\nthat next Change; and then the Moon being at _f_ is too high above the\r\nEcliptic to cast her shadow on the Earth: and as the Earth is still\r\nmoving forward, the Moon at her next opposition will be at _g_, too far\r\nbelow the Ecliptic to go through any part of the Earth’s shadow; for by\r\nthat time the point _g_ will be at a considerable distance from the\r\nEarth as seen from the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I and II.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth comes to _F_, the Moon in conjunction with the Sun _Z_ is\r\nnot at _k_, in a Plane coincident with the Ecliptic, but above it at _Y_\r\nin the highest part of her Orbit: and then the point _b_ of her shadow\r\n_O_ goes far above the Earth (as in Fig. II, which is an edge view of\r\nFig. I.) The Moon at her next opposition is not at _o_ (Fig I) but at\r\n_W_ where the Earth’s shadow goes far above her, (as in Fig. II.) In\r\nboth these cases the line of the Nodes _VFX_ (Fig. I.) is about 90\r\ndegrees from the Sun, and both Luminaries as far as possible from the\r\nlimits of Eclipses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE X.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth has gone half round the Ecliptic from _E_ to _G_, the\r\nline of the Nodes _VGX_ is nearly, if not exactly, directed towards the\r\nSun at _Z_; and then the New Moon _l_ casts her shadow _P_ on the Earth\r\n_G_; and the Full Moon _p_ goes through the Earth’s shadow _L_; which\r\nbrings on Eclipses again, as when the Earth was at _E_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth comes to _H_ the New Moon falls not at _m_ in a plane\r\ncoincident with the Ecliptic _CD_, but at _W_ in her Orbit below it: and\r\nthen her shadow _Q_ (see Fig. II) goes far below the Earth. At the next\r\nFull she is not at _q_ (Fig. I) but at _Y_ in her orbit 5-1/3 degrees\r\nabove _q_, and at her greatest height above the Ecliptic _CD_; being\r\nthen as far as possible, at any opposition, from the Earth’s shadow _M_\r\n(as in Fig. II.)\r\n\r\nSo, when the Earth is at _E_ and _G_, the Moon is about her Nodes at New\r\nand Full; and in her greatest _North_ and _South Declination_, (or\r\nLatitude as it is generally called) from the Ecliptic at her Quarters:\r\nbut when the Earth is at _F_ or _H_, the Moon is in her greatest _North_\r\nand _South Declination_ from the Ecliptic at New and Full, and in the\r\n_Nodes_ about her Quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon’s ascending and descending Node.\r\n\r\n           Her North and South Latitude.]\r\n\r\n318. The point _X_ where the Moon’s Orbit crosses the Ecliptic is called\r\n_the Ascending Node_, because the Moon ascends from it above the\r\nEcliptic: and the opposite point of intersection _V_ is called _the\r\nDescending Node_, because the Moon descends from it below the Ecliptic.\r\nWhen the Moon is at _Y_ in the highest point of her Orbit, she is in her\r\ngreatest _North Latitude_; and when she is at _W_ in the lowest point of\r\nher Orbit, she is in her greatest _South Latitude_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nodes have a retrograde motion.\r\n\r\n           Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Which brings on the Eclipses sooner every year than they would\r\n           be if the Nodes had not such a motion.]\r\n\r\n319. If the line of the Nodes, like the Earth’s Axis, was carried\r\nparallel to itself round the Sun, there would be just half a year\r\nbetween the conjunctions of the Sun and Nodes. But the Nodes shift\r\nbackward, or contrary to the Earth’s annual motion, 19-1/3 degrees every\r\nyear; and therefore the same Node comes round to the Sun 19 days sooner\r\nevery year than on the year before. Consequently, from the time that the\r\nascending Node _X_ (when the Earth is at _E_) passes by the Sun as seen\r\nfrom the Earth, it is only 173 days (not half a year) till the\r\ndescending Node _V_ passes by him. Therefore, in whatever time of the\r\nyear we have Eclipses of the Luminaries about either Node, we may be\r\nsure that in 173 days afterward we shall have Eclipses about the other\r\nNode. And when at any time of the year the line of the Nodes is in the\r\nsituation _VGX_, at the same time next year it will be in the situation\r\n_rGs_; the ascending Node having gone backward, that is, contrary to the\r\norder of Signs from _X_ to _s_, and the descending Node from _V_ to _r_;\r\neach 19-1/3 degrees. At this rate the Nodes shift through all the Signs\r\nand degrees of the Ecliptic in 18 years and 225 days; in which time\r\nthere would always be a regular period of Eclipses, if any compleat\r\nnumber of Lunations were finished without a fraction. But this never\r\nhappens, for if the Sun and Moon should start from a conjunction with\r\neither of the Nodes in any point of the Ecliptic, whilst the same Node\r\nis going round to that point again the Earth performs 18 annual\r\nrevolutions about the Sun and 222 Degrees (or 7 Signs 12 Degrees) over;\r\nand the Moon 230 Lunations or Courses from Change to Change and 85\r\nDegrees (or 2 Signs 25 Degrees) over; so that the Sun will be 138\r\nDegrees from the same Node when it comes round, and the Moon 85 Degrees\r\nfrom the Sun. Hence, the period of Eclipses and revolution of the Nodes\r\nare completed in different times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A period of Eclipses.\r\n\r\n           The defects of it.]\r\n\r\n320. In 18 years 10 days 7 hours 43 minutes after the Sun Moon and Nodes\r\nhave been in a line of conjunction, they come very near to a conjunction\r\nagain: only, if the conjunction from which you reckon falls in a\r\nleap-year, the return of the conjunction will be one day later.\r\nTherefore, if to the [65]mean time of any Eclipse of the Sun or Moon in\r\nleap-year, you add 18 years 11 days 7 hours 43 minutes; or in a common\r\nyear a day less, you will have the mean time of that Eclipse returned\r\nagain for some ages; though not always visible, because the 7 hours 43\r\nminutes may shift a solar Eclipse into the night, and a lunar Eclipse\r\ninto the day. In this period there are just 223 Lunations, and the Sun\r\nis again within half a degree of the same Node, but short of it.\r\nTherefore, although this period will serve tolerably well for some ages\r\nto examine Eclipses by, it cannot hold long; because half a degree from\r\nthe Node sets the Moon 2-1/2 minutes of a degree from the Ecliptic. And\r\nas the Moon’s mean distance from the Earth is equal to 60 Semidiameters\r\nof the Earth, every minute of a degree at that distance is equal to 60\r\ngeographical miles, or one degree on the Earth; consequently 2-1/2\r\nminutes of declination from the Ecliptic in the Moon’s Orbit, is equal\r\nto 150 such miles, or 2-1/2 degrees on the Earth. Consequently, if the\r\nMoon be passing by her ascending Node at the end of this period, her\r\nshadow will go 150 miles more southward on the Earth than it did at the\r\nbeginning thereof. If the Moon be passing by her descending Node, her\r\nshadow will go 150 miles more northward: and in either case, in 500\r\nyears the shadow will have too great a Latitude to touch the Earth. So\r\nthat any Eclipse of the Sun, which begins (for example) to touch the\r\nEarth at the south Pole (and that must be when the Moon is 17 degrees\r\npast her descending Node) will advance gradually northward in every\r\nreturn for about a thousand years, and then go off at the north Pole;\r\nand cannot take such another course again in less than 11,683 years.\r\n\r\nThis falling back of the Sun and Moon in every period, with respect to\r\nthe Nodes, will occasion those Eclipses which happen about the ascending\r\nNode to go more southerly in each return; and those which happen about\r\nthe descending Node to go more northerly: for the farther the Moon is\r\nshort of the ascending Node, within the limits of Eclipses, the farther\r\nshe is south of the Ecliptic; and on the contrary, the more she is short\r\nof the descending Node, the farther she is northward of the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: From Mr. G. SMITH’s dissertation on Eclipses, printed at\r\n           _London_, by E. CAVE, in the year 1748.]\r\n\r\n321. “To illustrate this a little farther, we shall examine some of the\r\nmost remarkable circumstances of the returns of the Eclipse which\r\nhappened _July 14, 1748_, about noon: This Eclipse, after traversing the\r\nvoids of space from the Creation, at last began to enter the _Terra\r\nAustralis Incognita_, about 88 years after the Conquest, which was the\r\nlast of King STEPHEN’s reign; every [66]_Chaldean_ period it has crept\r\nmore northerly, but was still invisible in _Britain_ before the year\r\n1622; when on the 30th of _April_ it began to touch the south parts of\r\n_England_ about 2 in the afternoon; its central appearance rising in the\r\n_American_ South Seas, and traversing _Peru_ and the _Amazon_’s country,\r\nthrough the _Atlantic_ ocean into _Africa_, and setting in the\r\n_Æthiopian_ continent, not far from the beginning of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n“Its next visible period was after three _Chaldean_ revolutions in 1676,\r\non the first of _June_, rising central in the _Atlantic_ ocean, passing\r\nus about 9 in the morning, with four [67]Digits eclipsed on the under\r\nlimb; and setting in the gulf of _Cochinchina_ in the _East-Indies_.\r\n\r\n“It being now near the Solstice, this Eclipse was visible the very next\r\nreturn in 1694, in the evening; and in two periods more, which was in\r\n1730, on the 4th of _July_, was seen above half eclipsed just after\r\nSun-rise, and observed both at _Wirtemberg_ in _Germany_, and _Pekin_ in\r\n_China_, soon after which it went off.\r\n\r\n“Eighteen years more afforded us the Eclipse which fell on the 14th of\r\n_July 1748_.\r\n\r\n“The next visible return will happen on _July 25, 1766_, in the evening,\r\nabout four Digits eclipsed; and after two periods more, on _August_\r\n16th, 1802, early in the morning, about five Digits, the center coming\r\nfrom the north frozen continent, by the capes of _Norway_, through\r\n_Tartary_, _China_, and _Japan_, to the _Ladrone_ islands, where it goes\r\noff.\r\n\r\n“Again, in 1820, _August 26_, betwixt one and two, there will be another\r\ngreat Eclipse at _London_, about 10 Digits; but happening so near the\r\nEquinox, the center will leave every part of _Britain_ to the West, and\r\nenter _Germany_ at _Embden_, passing by _Venice_, _Naples_, _Grand\r\nCairo_, and set in the gulf of _Bassora_ near that city.\r\n\r\n“It will be no more visible till 1874, when five Digits will be\r\nobscured, the center being now about to leave the Earth on _September\r\n28_. In 1892 the Sun will go down eclipsed at _London_, and again in\r\n1928 the passage of the center will be in the _expansum_, though there\r\nwill be two Digits eclipsed at _London_, _October_ the 31st of that\r\nyear; and about the year 2090 the whole Penumbra will be wore off;\r\nwhence no more returns of this Eclipse can happen till after a\r\nrevolution of 10 thousand years.\r\n\r\n“From these remarks on the intire revolution of this Eclipse, we may\r\ngather, that a thousand years, more or less (for there are some\r\nirregularities that may protract or lengthen this period 100 years)\r\ncomplete the whole terrestrial Phenomena of any single Eclipse: and\r\nsince 20 periods of 54 years each, and about 33 days, comprehend the\r\nintire extent of their revolution, ’tis evident that the times of the\r\nreturns will pass through a circuit of one year and ten months, every\r\n_Chaldean_ period being ten or eleven days later, and of the equable\r\nappearances about 32 or 33 days. Thus, though this Eclipse happens about\r\nthe middle of _July_, no other subsequent Eclipse of this period will\r\nreturn to the middle of the same month again; but wear constantly each\r\nperiod 10 or 11 days forward, and at last appear in Winter, but then it\r\nbegins to cease from affecting us.\r\n\r\n“Another conclusion from this revolution may be drawn, that there will\r\nseldom be any more than two great Eclipses of the Sun in the interval of\r\nthis period, and these follow sometimes next return, and often at\r\ngreater distances. That of 1715 returned again in 1733 very great; but\r\nthis present Eclipse will not be great till the arrival of 1820, which\r\nis a revolution of four _Chaldean_ periods: so that the irregularities\r\nof their circuits must undergo new computations to assign them exactly.\r\n\r\n“Nor do all Eclipses come in at the south Pole: _that_ depends\r\naltogether on the position of the lunar Nodes, which will bring in as\r\nmany from the _expansum_ one way as the other; and such Eclipses will\r\nwear more southerly by degrees, contrary to what happens in the present\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n“The Eclipse, for example, of 1736, in _September_, had its center in\r\nthe _expansum_, and set about the middle of its obscurity in _Britain_;\r\nit will wear in at the north Pole, and in the year 2600, or thereabouts,\r\ngo off into the _expansum_ on the south side of the Earth.\r\n\r\n“The Eclipses therefore which happened about the Creation are little\r\nmore than half way yet of their etherial circuit; and will be 4000 years\r\nbefore they enter the Earth any more. This grand revolution seems to\r\nhave been entirely unknown to the antients.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why our present Tables agree not with antient observations.]\r\n\r\n“322. It is particularly to be noted, that Eclipses which have happened\r\nmany centuries ago, will not be found by our present Tables to agree\r\nexactly with antient observations, by reason of the great Anomalies in\r\nthe lunar motions; which appears an incontestable demonstration of the\r\nnon-eternity of the Universe. For it seems confirmed by undeniable\r\nproofs, that the Moon now finishes her period in less time than\r\nformerly, and will continue by the centripetal law to approach nearer\r\nand nearer the Earth, and to go sooner and sooner round it: nor will the\r\ncentrifugal power be sufficient to compensate the different gravitations\r\nof such an assemblage of bodies as constitute the solar system, which\r\nwould come to ruin of itself, without some new regulation and adjustment\r\nof their original motions[68].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THALES’s Eclipse.]\r\n\r\n“323. We are credibly informed from the testimony of the antients, that\r\nthere was a total Eclipse of the Sun predicted by THALES to happen in\r\nthe fourth year of the 48th [69]_Olympiad_, either at _Sardis_ or\r\n_Miletus_ in _Asia_, where THALES then resided. That year corresponds to\r\nthe 585th year before CHRIST; when accordingly there happened a very\r\nsignal Eclipse of the Sun, on the 28th of _May_, answering to the\r\npresent 10th of that month[70], central through _North America_, the\r\nsouth parts of _France_, _Italy_, &c. as far as _Athens_, or the Isles\r\nin the _Ægean_ Sea; which is the farthest that even the _Caroline_\r\nTables carry it; and consequently make it invisible to any part of\r\n_Asia_, in the total character; though I have good reasons to believe\r\nthat it extended to _Babylon_, and went down central over that city. We\r\nare not however to imagine, that it was set before it past _Sardis_ and\r\nthe _Asiatic_ towns, where the predictor lived; because an invisible\r\nEclipse could have been of no service to demonstrate his ability in\r\nAstronomical Sciences to his countrymen, as it could give no proof of\r\nits reality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THUCYDIDES’s Eclipse.]\r\n\r\n“324. For a farther illustration, THUCYDIDES relates, that a solar\r\nEclipse happened on a Summer’s day in the afternoon, in the first year\r\nof the _Peloponnesian_ war, so great that the Stars appeared. _Rhodius_\r\nwas victor in the _Olympic_ games the fourth year of the said war, being\r\nalso the fourth of the 87th _Olympiad_, on the 428th year before CHRIST.\r\nSo that the Eclipse must have happened in the 431st year before CHRIST;\r\nand by computation it appears, that on the 3d of _August_ there was a\r\nsignal Eclipse which would have past over _Athens_, central about 6 in\r\nthe evening, but which our present Tables bring no farther than the\r\nantient _Syrtes_ on the _African_ coast, above 400 miles from _Athens_;\r\nwhich suffering in that case but 9 Digits, could by no means exhibit the\r\nremarkable darkness recited by this historian; the center therefore\r\nseems to have past _Athens_ about 6 in the evening, and probably might\r\ngo down about _Jerusalem_, or near it, contrary to the construction of\r\nthe present Tables. I have only obviated these things by way of caution\r\nto the present Astronomers, in re-computing antient Eclipses; and refer\r\nthem to examine the Eclipse of _Nicias_, so fatal to the _Athenian_\r\nfleet[71]; that which overthrew the _Macedonian_ Army[72] _&c._” So far\r\nMr. SMITH.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The number of Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n325. In any year, the number of Eclipses of both Luminaries cannot be\r\nless than two, nor more than seven; the most usual number is four, and\r\nit is very rare to have more than six. For the Sun passes by both the\r\nNodes but once a year, unless he passes by one of them in the beginning\r\nof the year; and if he does, he will pass by the same Node again a\r\nlittle before the year be finished; because, as these points move 19\r\ndegrees backward every year, the Sun will come to either of them 173\r\ndays after the other § 319. And when either Node is within 17 degrees of\r\nthe Sun at the time of New Moon, the Sun will be eclipsed. At the\r\nsubsequent opposition the Moon will be eclipsed in the other Node; and\r\ncome round to the next conjunction again ere the former Node be 17\r\ndegrees past the Sun, and will therefore eclipse him again. When three\r\nEclipses fall about either Node, the like number generally falls about\r\nthe opposite; as the Sun comes to it in 173 days afterward: and six\r\nLunations contain but four days more. Thus, there may be two Eclipses of\r\nthe Sun and one of the Moon about each of her Nodes. But when the Moon\r\nchanges in either of the Nodes, she cannot be near enough the other Node\r\nat the next Full to be eclipsed; and in six lunar months afterward she\r\nwill change near the other Node: in these cases there can be but two\r\nEclipses in a year, and they are both of the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two periods of Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n326. A longer, and consequently more exact period than the\r\nabove-mentioned § 320, for comparing and examining Eclipses which happen\r\nat long intervals of time, is 57 _Julian_ years 324 days 21 hours 41\r\nminutes and 35 seconds; in which time there are just 716 mean Lunations,\r\nand the Sun is again within 5 minutes of the same Node as before. But a\r\nstill better period is 557 years 21 days 18 hours 30 minutes 12 seconds;\r\nin which time there are 6890 mean Lunations; and the Sun and Node meet\r\nagain so nearly as to be but 11 seconds distant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An account of the following catalogue of Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n327. We shall subjoin a catalogue of Eclipses recorded in history, from\r\n721 years before CHRIST to _A. D._ 1485; of computed Eclipses from 1485\r\nto 1700; and of all the Eclipses visible in _Europe_ from 1700 to 1800.\r\nFrom the beginning of the catalogue to _A.D._ 1485 the Eclipses are\r\ntaken from STRUYK’s _Introduction to universal Geography_, as that\r\nindefatigable author has, with much labour, collected them from\r\n_Ptolemy_, _Thucydides_, _Plutarch_, _Calvisius_, _Xenophon_, _Diodorus\r\nSiculus_, _Justin_, _Polybius_, _Titus Livius_, _Cicero_, _Lucanus_,\r\n_Theophanes_, _Dion Cassius_, and many others. From 1485 to 1700 the\r\nEclipses are taken from _Ricciolus_’s _Almagest_: and from 1700 to 1800\r\nfrom _L’art de verifier les Dates_[73]. Those from _Struyk_ have all the\r\nplaces mentioned where they were observed: Those from the _French_\r\nauthors, _viz._ the religious _Benedictines_ of the Congregation of St.\r\n_Maur_, are fitted to the Meridian of _Paris_: And concerning those from\r\n_Ricciolus_, that author gives the following account.\r\n\r\nBecause it is of great use for fixing the Cycles or Revolutions of\r\nEclipses, to have at hand, without the trouble of calculation, a list of\r\nsuccessive Eclipses for many years, computed by authors of\r\n_Ephemerides_, although from Tables not perfect in all respects, I shall\r\nfor the benefit of Astronomers give a summary collection of such. The\r\nauthors I extract from are, an anonymous one who published _Ephemerides_\r\nfrom 1484 to 1506 inclusive; _Jacobus Pflaumen_ and _Jo.

I have not cited one half of RICCIOLUS’s list of potentous\r\nEclipses; and for the same reason that he declines giving any more of\r\nthem than what that list contains: namely, that ’tis most disagreeable\r\nto dwell any longer on such nonsense, and as much as possible to avoid\r\ntiring the reader: the superstition of the antients may be seen by the\r\nfew here copied. My author farther says, that there were treatises\r\nwritten to shew against what regions the malevolent effects of any\r\nparticular Eclipse was aimed: and the writers affirmed, that the effects\r\nof an Eclipse of the Sun continued as many years as the Eclipse lasted\r\nhours; and that of the Moon as many months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Very fortunate once for CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\n330. Yet such idle notions were once of no small advantage to\r\nCHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS; who, in the year 1493, was driven on the island of\r\n_Jamaica_, where he was in the greatest distress for want of provisions,\r\nand was moreover refused any assistance from the inhabitants; on which\r\nhe threatened them with a plague, and that in token of it there should\r\nbe an Eclipse: which accordingly fell on the day he had foretold, and so\r\nterrified the Barbarians, that they strove who should be first in\r\nbringing him all sorts of provisions; throwing them at his feet, and\r\nimploring his forgiveness. RICCIOLUS’s _Almagest_, Vol. I. 1. v. c. ii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why there are more visible Eclipses of the Moon than of the\r\n           Sun.]\r\n\r\n331. Eclipses of the Sun are more frequent than of the Moon, because the\r\nSun’s ecliptic limits are greater than the Moon’s § 317: yet we have\r\nmore visible Eclipses of the Moon than of the Sun, because Eclipses of\r\nthe Moon are seen from all parts of that Hemisphere of the Earth which\r\nis next her, and equally great to each of these parts; but the Sun’s\r\nEclipses are visible only to that small portion of the Hemisphere next\r\nhim whereon the Moon’s shadow falls; as shall be explained by and by at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.\r\n\r\n           Total and annular Eclipses of the Sun.\r\n\r\n           PLATE XI.]\r\n\r\n332. The Moon’s Orbit being elliptical, and the Earth in one of its\r\nfocuses, she is once at her least distance from the Earth, and once at\r\nher greatest in every Lunation. When the Moon changes at her least\r\ndistance from the Earth, and so near the Node that her dark shadow falls\r\non the Earth, she appears big enough to cover the whole [75]Disc of the\r\nSun from that part on which her shadow falls; and the Sun appears\r\ntotally eclipsed there, as at _A_, for some minutes: But when the Moon\r\nchanges at her greatest distance from the Earth, and so near the Node\r\nthat her dark shadow is directed towards the Earth, her diameter\r\nsubtends a less angle than the Sun’s; and therefore she cannot hide his\r\nwhole Disc from any part of the Earth, nor does her shadow reach it at\r\nthat time; and to the place over which the point of her shadow hangs,\r\nthe Eclipse is annular as at _B_; the Sun’s edge appearing like a\r\nluminous ring all around the body of the Moon. When the Change happens\r\nwithin 17 degrees of the Node, and the Moon at her mean distance from\r\nthe Earth, the point of her shadow just touches the Earth, and she\r\neclipseth the Sun totally to that small spot whereon her shadow falls;\r\nbut the darkness is not of a moment’s continuance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The longest duration of total Eclipses of the Sun.]\r\n\r\n333. The Moon’s apparent diameter when largest exceeds the Sun’s when\r\nleast only 1 minute 38 seconds of a degree: And in the greatest Eclipse\r\nof the Sun that can happen at any time and place, the total darkness\r\ncontinues no longer than whilst the Moon is going 1 minute 38 seconds\r\nfrom the Sun in her Orbit; which is about 3 minutes and 13 seconds of an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To how much of the Earth the Sun may be totally or partially\r\n           eclipsed at once.]\r\n\r\n334. The Moon’s dark shadow covers only a spot on the Earth’s surface,\r\nabout 180 _English_ miles broad, when the Moon’s diameter appears\r\nlargest and the Sun’s least; and the total darkness can extend no\r\nfarther than the dark shadow covers. Yet the Moon’s partial Shadow or\r\nPenumbra may then cover a circular space 4900 miles in diameter, within\r\nall which the Sun is more or less eclipsed as the places are less or\r\nmore distant from the Center of the Penumbra. When the Moon changes\r\nexactly in the Node, the Penumbra is circular on the Earth at the middle\r\nof the general Eclipse; because at that time it falls perpendicularly on\r\nthe Earth’s surface: But at every other moment it falls obliquely, and\r\nwill therefore be elliptical; and the more so, as the time is longer\r\nbefore or after the middle of the general Eclipse; and then, much\r\ngreater portions of the Earth’s surface are involved in the Penumbra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duration of general and particular Eclipses.\r\n\r\n           The Moon’s dark shadow.\r\n\r\n           And Penumbra.]\r\n\r\n335. When the Penumbra first touches the Earth the general Eclipse\r\nbegins: when it leaves the Earth the general Eclipse ends: from the\r\nbeginning to the end the Sun appears eclipsed in some part of the Earth\r\nor other. When the Penumbra touches any place the Eclipse begins at that\r\nplace, and ends when the Penumbra leaves it. When the Moon changes in\r\nthe Node, the Penumbra goes over the center of the Earth’s Disc as seen\r\nfrom the Moon; and consequently, by describing the longest line possible\r\non the Earth, continues the longest upon it; namely, at a mean rate, 5\r\nhours 50 minutes: more, if the Moon be at her greatest distance from the\r\nEarth, because she then moves slowest; less, if she be at her least\r\ndistance, because of her quicker motion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\n336. To make the last five articles and several other Phenomena plainer,\r\nlet _S_ be the Sun, _E_ the Earth, _M_ the Moon, and _AMP_ the Moon’s\r\nOrbit. Draw the right line _Wc 12_ from the western edge of the Sun at\r\n_W_, touching the western edge of the Moon at _c_ and the Earth at _12_:\r\ndraw also the right line _Vd 12_ from the eastern edge of the Sun at\r\n_V_, touching the eastern edge of the Moon at _d_ and the Earth at _12_:\r\nthe dark space _ce 12 d_ included between those lines is the Moon’s\r\nshadow, ending in a point at _12_ where it touches the Earth; because in\r\nthis case the Moon is supposed to change at _M_ in the middle between\r\n_A_ the Apogee, or farthest point of her Orbit from the Earth, and _P_\r\nthe Perigee, or nearest point to it. For, had the point _P_ been at _M_,\r\nthe Moon had been nearer the Earth; and her dark shadow at _e_ would\r\nhave covered a space upon it about 180 miles broad, and the Sun would\r\nhave been totally darkened as at _A_ (Fig I) with some continuance: but\r\nhad the point _A_ (Fig. II) been at _M_, the Moon would have been\r\nfarther from the Earth, and her shadow would have ended in a point about\r\n_e_, and therefore the Sun would have appeared as at _B_ (Fig. I) like a\r\nluminous ring all around the Moon. Draw the right lines _WXdh_ and\r\n_VXcg_, touching the contrary sides of the Sun and Moon, and ending on\r\nthe Earth at _a_ and _b_: draw also the right line _SXM 12_, from the\r\ncenter of the Sun’s Disc, through the Moon’s center, to the Earth at\r\n_12_; and suppose the two former lines _WXdh_ and _VXcg_ to revolve on\r\nthe line _SXM 12_ as an Axis, and their points _a_ and _b_ will describe\r\nthe limits of the Penumbra _TT_ on the Earth’s surface, including the\r\nlarge space _a0b12a_; within which the Sun appears more or less eclipsed\r\nas the places are more or less distant from the verge of the Penumbra\r\n_a0b_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Digits, what.]\r\n\r\nDraw the right line _y 12_ across the Sun’s Disc, and parallel to the\r\nplane of the Moon’s Orbit; divide this line into twelve equal parts, as\r\nin the Figure, for the twelve [76]Digits of the Sun’s diameter: and at\r\nequal distances from the center of the Penumbra _TT_ to its edge on the\r\nEarth, or from _12_ to _0_, draw twelve concentric Circles, as marked\r\nwith the numeral Figures _1_ _2_ _3_ _4_ &c. and remember that the\r\nMoon’s motion in her Orbit _AMP_ is from west to east, as from _s_ to\r\n_t_. Then,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The different phases of a solar Eclipse.\r\n\r\n           PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n           Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nTo an observer on the Earth at _b_, the eastern limb of the Moon at _d_\r\nseems to touch the western limb of the Sun at _W_, when the Moon is at\r\n_M_; and the Sun’s Eclipse begins at _b_; appearing as at _A_ in Fig.\r\nIII at the left hand; but at the same moment of absolute time to an\r\nobserver at _a_ in Fig. II the western edge of the Moon at _c_ leaves\r\nthe eastern edge of the Sun at _V_, and the Eclipse ends, as at the\r\nright hand _C_ of Fig. III. At the very same instant, to all those who\r\nlive on the Circle marked _1_ on the Earth _E_ in Fig. II, the Moon _M_\r\ncuts off or darkens a twelfth part of the Sun _S_, and eclipses him one\r\nDigit, as at _1_ in Fig. III: to those who live on the Circle marked _2_\r\nin Fig. II the Moon cuts off two twelfth parts of the Sun, as at _2_ in\r\nFig. III: to those on the Circle _3_, three parts; and so on to the\r\ncenter at _12_ in Fig. II, where the Sun is centrally eclipsed as at _B_\r\nin the middle of Fig. III: under which Figure there is a scale of hours\r\nand minutes, to shew at a mean state how long it is from the beginning\r\nto the end of a central Eclipse of the Sun on the parallel of _London_;\r\nand how many Digits are eclipsed at any particular time from the\r\nbeginning at _A_ to the middle at _B_, or the end at _C_. Thus in 16\r\nminutes from the beginning, the Sun is two Digits eclipsed; in an hour\r\nand five minutes, 8 Digits; and in an hour and thirty-seven minutes, 12\r\nDigits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           The Velocity of the Moon’s shadow on the Earth.\r\n\r\n           Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\n337. By Fig. II it is plain, that the Sun is totally or centrally\r\neclipsed but to a small part of the Earth at any time; because the dark\r\nconical shadow _e_ of the Moon _M_ falls but on a small part of the\r\nEarth: and that the partial Eclipse is confined at that time to the\r\nspace included by the Circle _a 0 b_, of which only one half can be\r\nprojected in the Figure, the other half being supposed to be hid by the\r\nconvexity of the Earth _E_: and likewise, that no part of the Sun is\r\neclipsed to the large space _YY_ of the Earth, because the Moon is not\r\nbetween the Sun and that part of the Earth: and therefore to all that\r\npart the Eclipse is invisible. The Earth turns eastward on its Axis, as\r\nfrom _g_ to _h_, which is the same way that the Moon’s shadow moves; but\r\nthe Moon’s motion is much swifter in her Orbit from _s_ to _t_: and\r\ntherefore, altho’ Eclipses of the Sun are of longer duration on account\r\nof the Earth’s motion on its Axis, than they would be if that motion was\r\nstopt, yet in 3 minutes and 13 seconds of time, the Moon’s swifter\r\nmotion carries her dark shadow quite over any place that its center\r\ntouches at the time of greatest obscuration. The motion of the shadow on\r\nthe Earth’s Disc is equal to the Moon’s motion from the Sun, which is\r\nabout 30-1/2 minutes of a degree every hour at a mean rate; but so much\r\nof the Moon’s Orbit is equal to 30-1/2 degrees of a great Circle on the\r\nEarth, § 320; and therefore the Moon’s shadow goes 30-1/2 degrees or\r\n1830 geographical miles on the Earth in an hour, or 30-1/2 miles in a\r\nminute, which is almost four times as swift as the motion of a\r\ncannon-ball.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n           Fig. IV.\r\n\r\n           Phenomena of the Earth as seen from the Sun or New Moon\r\n           at different times of the year.]\r\n\r\n338. As seen from the Sun or Moon, the Earth’s Axis appears differently\r\ninclined every day of the year, on account of keeping its parallelism\r\nthroughout its annual course. Let _E_, _D_, _O_, _N_, be the Earth at\r\nthe two Equinoxes and the two Solstices; _N S_ its Axis, _N_ the North\r\nPole, _S_ the South Pole, _Æ Q_ the Equator, _T_ the Tropic of Cancer,\r\n_t_ the Tropick of Capricorn, and _ABC_ the Circumference of the Earth’s\r\nenlightened Disc as seen from the Sun or New Moon at these times. The\r\nEarth’s Axis has the position _NES_ at the vernal Equinox, lying towards\r\nthe right hand, as seen from the Sun or New Moon; its Poles _N_ and _S_\r\nbeing then in the Circumference of the Disc; and the Equator and all its\r\nparallels seem to be straight lines, because their planes pass through\r\nthe observer’s eye looking down upon the Earth from the Sun or Moon\r\ndirectly over _E_, where the Ecliptic _FG_ intersects the Equator _Æ_.\r\nAt the Summer Solstice, the Earth’s Axis has the position _NDS_; and\r\nthat part of the Ecliptic _FG_ in which the Moon is then New, touches\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer _T_ at _D_. The North Pole _N_ at that time\r\ninclining 23-1/2 degrees towards the Sun, falls so many degrees within\r\nthe Earth’s enlightened Disc, because the Sun is then vertical to _D_,\r\n23-1/2 degrees north of the Equator _ÆQ_; and the Equator with all its\r\nparallels seem elliptic curves bending downward, or towards the South\r\nPole as seen from the Sun: which Pole, together with 23-1/2 degrees all\r\nround it, is hid behind the Disc in the dark Hemisphere of the Earth. At\r\nthe autumnal Equinox the Earth’s Axis has the position _NOS_, lying to\r\nthe left hand as seen from the Sun or New Moon, which are then vertical\r\nto _O_, where the Ecliptic cuts the Equator _ÆQ_. Both Poles now lie in\r\nthe circumference of the Disc, the North Pole just going to disappear\r\nbehind it, and the South Pole just entering into it; and the Equator\r\nwith all its parallels seem to be straight lines, because their planes\r\npass through the observer’s eye, as seen from the Sun, and very nearly\r\nso as seen from the Moon. At the Winter Solstice the Earth’s Axis has\r\nthe position _NNS_; when its South Pole _S_ inclining 23-1/2 degrees\r\ntoward the Sun falls 23-1/2 degrees within the enlightened Disc, as seen\r\nfrom the Sun or New Moon which are then vertical to the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn _t_, 23-1/2 degrees south of the Equator _ÆQ_; and the Equator\r\nwith all its parallels seem elliptic curves bending upward; the North\r\nPole being as far hid behind the Disc in the dark Hemisphere, as the\r\nSouth Pole is come into the light. The nearer that any time of the year\r\nis to the Equinoxes or Solstices, the more it partakes of the Phenomena\r\nrelating to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n           Various positions of the Earth’s Axis, as seen from the Sun\r\n           at different times of the year.]\r\n\r\n339. Thus it appears, that from the vernal equinox to the autumnal, the\r\nNorth Pole is enlightened; and the Equator and all its parallels appear\r\nSemi-ellipses as seen from the Sun, more or less curved as the time is\r\nnearer to or farther from the Summer Solstice; and bending downwards or\r\ntowards the South Pole; the reverse of which happens from the autumnal\r\nEquinox to the vernal. A little consideration will be sufficient to\r\nconvince the reader, that the Earth’s Axis inclines towards the Sun at\r\nthe Summer Solstice; from the Sun at the Winter Solstice; and sidewise\r\nto the Sun at the Equinoxes; but towards the right hand, as seen from\r\nthe Sun at the vernal Equinox; and towards the left hand at the\r\nautumnal. From the Winter to the Summer Solstice, the Earth’s Axis\r\ninclines more or less to the right hand, as seen from the Sun; and the\r\ncontrary from the Summer to the Winter Solstice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How these positions affect solar Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n340. The different positions of the Earth’s Axis, as seen from the Sun\r\nat different times of the year, affect solar Eclipses greatly with\r\nregard to particular places; yea so far as would make central Eclipses\r\nwhich fall at one time of the year invisible if they fell at another,\r\neven though the Moon should always change in the Nodes and at the same\r\nhour of the day: of which indefinitely various affections, we shall only\r\ngive Examples for the times of the Equinoxes and Solstices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\nIn the same Diagram, let _FG_ be part of the Ecliptic, and _IK_ _ik_\r\n_ik_ _ik_ part of the Moon’s Orbit; both seen edgewise, and therefore\r\nprojected into right lines; and let the intersections _N_, _O_, _D_, _E_\r\nbe one and the same Node at the above times, when the Earth has the\r\nforementioned different positions; and let the spaces included by the\r\nCircles _P_, _p_, _p_, _p_ be the Penumbra at these times, as its center\r\nis passing over the center of the Earth’s Disc. At the Winter Solstice,\r\nwhen the Earth’s Axis has the position _NNS_, the center of the Penumbra\r\n_P_ touches the Tropic of Capricorn _t_ in _N_ at the middle of the\r\ngeneral Eclipse; but no part of the Penumbra touches the Tropic of\r\nCancer _T_. At the Summer Solstice, when the Earth’s Axis has the\r\nposition _NDS_ (_iDk_ being then part of the Moon’s Orbit whose Node is\r\nat _D_) the Penumbra _p_ has its center on the Tropic of Cancer _T_ at\r\nthe middle of the general Eclipse, and then no part of it touches the\r\nTropic of Capricorn _t_. At the autumnal Equinox the Earth’s Axis has\r\nthe position _NOS_ (_iOk_ being then part of the Moon’s Orbit) and the\r\nPenumbra equally includes part of both Tropics _T_ and _t_ at the middle\r\nof the general Eclipse: at the vernal Equinox it does the same, because\r\nthe Earth’s Axis has the position _NES_: But, in the former of these two\r\nlast cases, the Penumbra enters the Earth at _A_, north of the Tropic of\r\nCancer _T_, and leaves it at _m_, south of the Tropic of Capricorn _t_;\r\nhaving gone over the Earth obliquely southward, as its center described\r\nthe line _AOm_: whereas in the latter case the Penumbra touches the\r\nEarth at _n_, south of the Equator _ÆQ_, and describing the line _nEq_\r\n(similar to the former line _AOm_ in open space) goes obliquely\r\nnorthward over the Earth, and leaves it at _q_, north of the Equator.\r\n\r\nIn all these circumstances, the Moon has been supposed to change at noon\r\nin her descending Node: had she changed in her ascending Node, the\r\nPhenomena would have been as various the contrary way, with respect to\r\nthe Penumbra’s going northward or southward over the Earth. But because\r\nthe Moon changes at all hours, as often in one Node as the other, and at\r\nall distances from them both at different times as it happens, the\r\nvariety of the Phases of Eclipses are almost innumerable, even at the\r\nsame places, considering also how variously the same places are situated\r\non the enlightened Disc of the Earth, with respect to the Penumbra’s\r\nmotion, at the different hours that Eclipses happen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How much of the Penumbra falls on the Earth at different\r\n           distances from the Nodes.]\r\n\r\n341. When the Moon changes 17 degrees short of her descending Node, the\r\nPenumbra _P_ 18 just touches the northern part of the Earth’s Disc, near\r\nthe North Pole _N_; and, as seen from that place the Moon appears to\r\ntouch the Sun, but hides no part of him from sight. Had the Change been\r\nas far short of the ascending Node, the Penumbra would have touched the\r\nsouthern part of the Disc near the South Pole _S_. When the Moon changes\r\n12 degrees short of the descending Node, more than a third part of the\r\nPenumbra _P 12_ falls on the northern parts of the Earth at the middle\r\nof the general Eclipse: had she changed as far past the same Node, as\r\nmuch of the other side of the Penumbra about _P_ would have fallen on\r\nthe southern part of the Earth; all the rest in the _expansum_, or open\r\nspace. When the Moon changes 6 degrees from the Node, almost the whole\r\nPenumbra _P6_ falls on the Earth at the middle of the general Eclipse.\r\nAnd lastly, when the Moon changes in the Node, the Penumbra _PN_ takes\r\nthe longest course possible on the Earth’s Disc; its center falling on\r\nthe middle thereof, at the middle of the general Eclipse. The farther\r\nthe Moon changes from either Node within 17 degrees of it, the shorter\r\nis the Penumbra’s continuance on the Earth, because it goes over a less\r\nportion of the Disc, as is evident by the Figure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth’s diurnal motion lengthens the duration of solar\r\n           Eclipses, which fall without the polar Circles.]\r\n\r\n342. The nearer that the Penumbra’s center is to the Equator at the\r\nmiddle of the general Eclipse, the longer is the duration of the Eclipse\r\nat all those places where it is central; because, the nearer that any\r\nplace is to the Equator, the greater is the Circle it describes by the\r\nEarth’s motion on its Axis: and so, the place moving quicker keeps\r\nlonger in the Penumbra whose motion is the same way with that of the\r\nplace, tho’ faster as has been already mentioned § 337. Thus, (see the\r\nEarth at _D_ and the Penumbra at _12_) whilst the point _b_ in the polar\r\nCircle _abcd_ is carried from _b_ to _c_ by the Earth’s diurnal motion,\r\nthe point _d_ on the Tropick of Cancer _T_ is carried a much greater\r\nlength from _d_ to _D_: and therefore, if the Penumbra’s center goes one\r\ntime over _c_ and another time over _D_, the Penumbra will be longer in\r\npassing over the moving place _d_ than it was in passing over the moving\r\nplace _b_. Consequently, central Eclipses about the Poles are of the\r\nshortest duration; and about the Equator of the longest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And shortens the duration of some which fall within these\r\n           Circles.]\r\n\r\n343. In the middle of Summer the whole frigid Zone included by the polar\r\nCircle _abcd_ is enlightened; and if it then happens that the Penumbra’s\r\ncenter goes over the north Pole, the Sun will be eclipsed much the same\r\nnumber of Digits at _a_ as at _c_; but whilst the Penumbra moves\r\neastward over _c_ it moves westward over _a_, because with respect to\r\nthe Penumbra, the motions of _a_ and _c_ are contrary: for _c_ moves the\r\nsame way with the Penumbra towards _d_, but _a_ moves the contrary way\r\ntowards _b_; and therefore the Eclipse will be of longer duration at _c_\r\nthan at _a_. At _a_ the Eclipse begins on the Sun’s eastern limb, but at\r\n_c_ on his western: at all places lying without the polar Circles, the\r\nSun’s Eclipses begin on his western limb, or near it, and end on or near\r\nhis eastern. At those places where the Penumbra touches the Earth, the\r\nEclipse begins with the rising Sun, on the top of his western or\r\nuppermost edge; and at those places where the Penumbra leaves the Earth,\r\nthe Eclipse ends with the setting Sun, on the top of his eastern edge\r\nwhich is then the uppermost, just at its disappearing in the Horizon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon has no Atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n344. If the Moon were surrounded by an Atmosphere of any considerable\r\nDensity, it would seem to touch the Sun a little before the Moon made\r\nher appulse to his edge, and we should see a little faintness on that\r\nedge before it were eclipsed by the Moon: But as no such faintness has\r\nbeen observed, at least so far as I ever heard, it seems plain, that the\r\nMoon has no such Atmosphere as that of the Earth. The faint ring of\r\nlight surrounding the Sun in total Eclipses, called by CASSINI _la\r\nChevelure du Soleil_, seems to be the Atmosphere of the Sun; because it\r\nhas been observed to move equally with the Sun, not with the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE XI.]\r\n\r\n345. Having been so prolix concerning Eclipses of the Sun, we shall drop\r\nthat subject at present, and proceed to the doctrine of lunar Eclipses;\r\nwhich, being more simple, may be explained in less time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eclipses of the Moon.\r\n\r\n           Fig. II.]\r\n\r\nThat the Moon can never be eclipsed but at the time of her being Full,\r\nand the reason why she is not eclipsed at every Full, have been shewn\r\nalready § 316, 317. Let _S_ be the Sun, _E_ the Earth, _RR_ the Earth’s\r\nshadow, and _B_ the Moon in opposition to the Sun: in this situation the\r\nEarth intercepts the Sun’s light in its way to the Moon; and when the\r\nMoon touches the Earth’s shadow at _v_ she begins to be eclipsed on her\r\neastern limb _x_, and continues eclipsed until her western limb _y_\r\nleaves the shadow at _w_: at _B_ she is in the middle of the shadow, and\r\nconsequently in the middle of the Eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Moon is visible in a total Eclipse.]\r\n\r\n346. The Moon when totally eclipsed, is not invisible if she be above\r\nthe Horizon and the Sky be clear; but appears generally of a dusky\r\ncolour like tarnished copper, which some have thought to be the Moon’s\r\nnative light. But the true cause of her being visible is the scattered\r\nbeams of the Sun, bent into the Earth’s shadow by going through the\r\nAtmosphere; which, being more dense near the Earth than at considerable\r\nheights above it, refracts or bends the Sun’s rays more inward § 179,\r\nthe nearer they are passing by the Earth’s surface, than those rays\r\nwhich go through higher parts of the Atmosphere, where it is less dense\r\naccording to its height, until it be so thin or rare as to lose its\r\nrefractive power. Let the Circle _fghi_, concentric to the Earth,\r\ninclude the Atmosphere whose refractive power vanishes at the heights\r\n_f_ and _i_; so that the rays _Wfw_ and _Viv_ go on straight without\r\nsuffering the least refraction: But all those rays which enter the\r\nAtmosphere between _f_ and _k_, and between _i_ and _l_, on opposite\r\nsides of the Earth, are gradually more bent inward as they go through a\r\ngreater portion of the Atmosphere, until the rays _Wk_ and _Vl_,\r\ntouching the Earth at _m_ and _n_, are bent so as to meet at _q_, a\r\nlittle short of the Moon; and therefore the dark shadow of the Earth is\r\ncontained in the space _moqpn_ where none of the Sun’s rays can enter:\r\nall the rest _RR_, being mixed by the scattered rays which are refracted\r\nas above, is in some measure enlightened by them; and some of those rays\r\nfalling on the Moon give her the colour of tarnished copper, or of iron\r\nalmost red hot. So that if the Earth had no Atmosphere, the Moon would\r\nbe as invisible in total Eclipses as she is when New. If the Moon were\r\nso near the Earth as to go into its dark shadow, suppose about _po_, she\r\nwould be invisible during her stay in it; but visible before and after\r\nin the fainter shadow _RR_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n           Why the Sun and Moon are sometimes visible when the Moon is\r\n           totally eclipsed.]\r\n\r\n347. When the Moon goes through the center of the Earth’s shadow she is\r\ndirectly opposite to the Sun: yet the Moon has been often seen totally\r\neclipsed in the Horizon when the Sun was also visible in the opposite\r\npart of it: for, the horizontal refraction being almost 34 minutes of a\r\ndegree § 181, and the diameter of the Sun and Moon being each at a mean\r\nstate but 32 minutes, the refraction causes both Luminaries to appear\r\nabove the Horizon when they are really below it § 179.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.\r\n\r\n           Duration of central Eclipses of the Moon.]\r\n\r\n348. When the Moon is Full at 12 degrees from either of her Nodes, she\r\njust touches the Earth’s shadow but enters not into it. Let _GH_ be the\r\nEcliptic, _ef_ the Moon’s Orbit where she is 12 degrees from the Node at\r\nher Full; _cd_ her Orbit where she is 6 degrees from the Node, _ab_ her\r\nOrbit where she is Full in the Node, _AB_ the Earth’s shadow, and _M_\r\nthe Moon. When the Moon describes the line _ef_ she just touches the\r\nshadow but does not enter into it; when she describes the line _cd_ she\r\nis totally though not centrally immersed in the shadow; and when she\r\ndescribes the line _ab_ she passes by the Node at _M_ in the center of\r\nthe shadow, and takes the longest line possible, which is a diameter,\r\nthrough it: and such an Eclipse being both total and central is of the\r\nlongest duration, namely, 3 hours 57 minutes 6 seconds from the\r\nbeginning to the end, if the Moon be at her greatest distance from the\r\nEarth: and 3 hours 37 minutes 26 seconds, if she be at her least\r\ndistance. The reason of this difference is, that when the Moon is\r\nfarthest from the Earth she moves slowest; and when nearest to it,\r\nquickest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Digits.]\r\n\r\n349. The Moon’s diameter, as well as the Sun’s, is supposed to be\r\ndivided into twelve equal parts called _Digits_; and so many of these\r\nparts as are darkened by the Earth’s shadow, so many Digits is the Moon\r\neclipsed. All that the Moon is eclipsed above 12 Digits, shew how far\r\nthe shadow of the Earth is over the body of the Moon, on that edge to\r\nwhich she is nearest at the middle of the Eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the beginning and end of a lunar Eclipse is so difficult\r\n           to be determined by observation.]\r\n\r\n350. It is difficult to observe exactly either the beginning or ending\r\nof a lunar Eclipse, even with a good Telescope; because the Earth’s\r\nshadow is so faint, and ill defined about the edges, that when the Moon\r\nis either just touching or leaving it, the obscuration of her limb is\r\nscarce sensible; and therefore the nicest observers can hardly be\r\ncertain to four or five seconds of time. But both the beginning and\r\nending of solar Eclipses are visibly instantaneous; for the moment that\r\nthe edge of the Moon’s Disc touches the Sun’s, his roundness seems a\r\nlittle broke on that part; and the moment she leaves it he appears\r\nperfectly round again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The use of Eclipses in Astronomy, Geography, and Chronology.]\r\n\r\n351. In Astronomy, Eclipses of the Moon are of great use for\r\nascertaining the periods of her motions; especially such Eclipses as are\r\nobserved to be alike in all circumstances, and have long intervals of\r\ntime between them. In Geography, the Longitudes of places are found by\r\nEclipses, as already shewn in the eleventh chapter: but for this purpose\r\nEclipses of the Moon are more useful than those of the Sun, because they\r\nare more frequently visible, and the same lunar Eclipse is of equal\r\nlargeness and duration at all places where it is seen. In Chronology,\r\nboth solar and lunar Eclipses serve to determine exactly the time of any\r\npast event: for there are so many particulars observable in every\r\nEclipse, with respect to its quantity, the places where it is visible\r\n(if of the Sun) and the time of the day or night; that ’tis impossible\r\nthere can be two Eclipses in the course of many ages which are alike in\r\nall circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The darkness at our SAVIOUR’s crucifixion supernatural.]\r\n\r\n352. From the above explanation of the doctrine of Eclipses it is\r\nevident, that the darkness at our SAVIOUR’s crucifixion was\r\nsupernatural. For he suffered on the next day after eating his last\r\nPassover-Supper, on which day it was impossible that the Moon’s shadow\r\ncould fall on the Earth, for the _Jews_ kept the Passover at the time of\r\nFull Moon: nor does the darkness in total Eclipses of the Sun last four\r\nminutes in any place § 333, whereas the darkness at the crucifixion\r\nlasted three hours, _Matt._ xxviii. 15. and overspread at least all the\r\nland of _Judea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP.

To construct an Eclipse of the Sun, we must collect these ten\r\nElements or Requisites from the following Astronomical Tables.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Requisites for a solar Eclipse.]\r\n\r\nI. The true time of conjunction of the Sun and Moon: to know at what\r\nconjunctions the Sun must be eclipsed; and to the times of those\r\nconjunctions,\r\n\r\nII. The Moon’s horizontal parallax, or angle which the semi-diameter of\r\nthe Earth subtends as seen from the Moon.\r\n\r\nIII. The Sun’s true place, and distance from the solstitial colure to\r\nwhich he is then nearest, either in coming to it or going from it.\r\n\r\nIV. The Sun’s declination.\r\n\r\nV. The angle of the Moon’s visible path with the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nVI. The Moon’s Latitude or Declination from the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nVII. The Moon’s true hourly motion from the Sun.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Angle of the Sun’s semi-diameter as seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\nIX. The Angle of the Moon’s semi-diameter as seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\nX. The semi-diameter of the Penumbra.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for an Eclipse of the Moon, the following Elements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Requisites for a lunar Eclipse.]\r\n\r\nI. The true time of opposition of the Sun and Moon; and for that time,\r\n\r\nII. The Moon’s horizontal parallax.\r\n\r\nIII. The Sun’s semi-diameter.\r\n\r\nIV. The semi-diameter of the Earth’s shadow.\r\n\r\nV. The Moon’s semi-diameter.\r\n\r\nVI. The Moon’s Latitude.\r\n\r\nVII. The Moon’s true hourly motion from the Sun.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Angle of the Moon’s visible path with the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Elements are easily found from the following Tables and Precepts,\r\nby the common Rules of Arithmetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note_, 60 minutes make a Degree, 30 degrees a Sign, and 12 Signs a\r\nCircle. A Sign is marked thus ^s, a Degree thus °, and a Minute thus ʹ.\r\n\r\nWhen you exceed 12 Signs, always reject them and set down the remainder.\r\nWhen the number of Signs to be subtracted is greater than the number you\r\nsubtract from, add 12 Signs to that which you subtract from; and then\r\nyou will have a remainder to set down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the Signs are reckoned.]\r\n\r\n354. As we fix arbitrarily upon the beginning of the Sign _Aries_ to\r\nreckon from, when we speak of the places of the Sun, Moon, and Nodes; we\r\ncall _Aries_ 0 Signs, _Taurus_ 1 Sign, _Gemini_ 2 Signs, _Cancer_ 3\r\nSigns, _&c._ So, when the Sun is in the 10th degree of Aries, we say his\r\nPlace or Longitude is 0 Signs 10 Degrees, because he is only 10 Degrees\r\nfrom the beginning of Aries: if he is in the 5th, 10th, _&c._ Degree of\r\nTaurus, we say his Place or Longitude is 1 Sign, 5, 10, _&c._ Degrees:\r\nand so on, till he comes quite round again. But in reckoning the\r\nAnomalies of the Sun and Moon, and their distance from the Nodes, we\r\nonly consider the number of Signs and Degrees the Luminaries are gone\r\npast their Apogee or Nodes; not how far they have to go to these points,\r\nwere the distance ever so little. The Sun, Moon, and Apogee move\r\naccording to the order of Signs, but the Nodes contrary. We shall now\r\ngive the Precepts and Examples for the above Requisites in their due\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _To calculate the time of New and Full Moon._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Element or Requisite.]\r\n\r\n355. PRECEPT I. For any proposed year in the 18th Century, take out the\r\nmean time of the New Moon in _March_ from Table I., and the mean time of\r\nFull Moon from Table III., for the _Old Stile_; or from Tables II and IV\r\nfor _New Stile_; with the mean Anomalies of the Sun and Moon for these\r\ntimes, and set them by themselves. Then, from Table VI, take out as many\r\nLunations as the proposed Month is after _March_, with the days, hours,\r\nand minutes belonging to them; and also the mean Anomalies of the Sun\r\nand Moon for these Lunations.\r\n\r\nII. Add the days, hours, and minutes of these Lunations to the time of\r\nNew or Full Moon in _March_, and the Anomalies for the Lunations to the\r\nAnomalies for _March_: the sums give the hours and minutes of the mean\r\nNew or Full Moon required, and the mean Anomalies of the Sun and Moon\r\nfor that time.\r\n\r\nIII. Then, with the number of days enter Table VII, under the given\r\nMonth, and right against this number, in the left hand column you have\r\nthe day of New or Full Moon; which set before the hours and minutes\r\nabove-mentioned.\r\n\r\nIV. But, (as it will sometimes happen) if the number of days fall short\r\nof all those under the given Month, add one Lunation with its Anomalies\r\nfrom Table VI to the foresaid sums; so you will have a new sum of days\r\nwherewith to enter the 7th Table under the given Month, where you are\r\nsure to find that sum the second time, if the first falls short.\r\n\r\nV. With the Signs and Degrees of the Sun’s Anomaly enter Table VIII,\r\n_The Moon’s annual Equation_, and take out the minutes of time of that\r\nEquation by the Anomaly; remembring, that if the Signs are at the head\r\nof the Table, the degrees are at the left hand, in which case the\r\nEquation found in the Angle of meeting must be subtracted from the mean\r\ntime of New or Full Moon, as the title _Subtract_, at the head of the\r\nTable directs: but if the Signs are at the foot of the Table their\r\ndegrees are in the right-hand column, and the Equation where the Signs\r\nand Degrees meet in the Table is to be added to the mean time, as the\r\ntitle _Add_, at the foot of the Table directs; which Equation, so\r\napplied, gives the mean time of New or Full Moon corrected.\r\n\r\nVI. With the Signs and Degrees of the Sun’s Anomaly enter Table IX,\r\n_Equation of the Moon’s mean Anomaly_, and take out the Equation\r\nthereof; adding it to the mean Anomaly or subtracting it therefrom, as\r\nthe titles at the head or foot of the Table direct; and it gives the\r\nmean Anomaly corrected. Then, with the Sun’s Anomaly enter Table XII,\r\n_Equation of the Sun’s mean Place_, and take out that Equation, applying\r\nit to the Moon’s corrected Anomaly as the titles direct; and it will\r\ngive the Moon’s Anomaly equated[77]. _N. B._ In all these Equations,\r\ncare must be taken to make proper allowance for the odd minutes of\r\nAnomaly; the Tables having the Equations only for compleat Degrees.\r\n\r\nVII. With the Moon’s equated Anomaly enter Table X, _The Moon’s elliptic\r\nEquation_, and take out that Equation in the same manner as the\r\npreceding: adding it to the former corrected time if the Signs be at the\r\nhead of the Table, or subtracting it if they be at the foot, as the\r\nTable directs; and this gives the mean time equated.\r\n\r\nVIII. Lastly, enter Table XI, _The Sun’s Equation at New and Full Moon_,\r\nwith the Sun’s Anomaly, and take out the Sun’s Equation in the same\r\nmanner as the others; adding it to, or subtracting it from the former\r\nequated time, as the titles direct: and by this last Equation you have\r\nthe true time of New or Full Moon, agreeing with well regulated Clocks\r\nand Watches. But to make it agree with true Sun-Dials, the Equation of\r\ntime must be applied as taught § 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXAMPLE I.\r\n\r\n         _To find the time of New Moon in_ April 1764, _N.

And as, according to _Genesis_, chap. i. ver. 14. the Sun and Moon\r\nwere created on the fourth day of the week, those who are of opinion\r\nthat the world was made at the time of the Autumnal Equinox, and that\r\nthe Moon at her first appearance was in full lustre, opposite to the\r\nSun, or nearly so, may perhaps look upon this as a Criterion for\r\nascertaining the year of the creation; since it shews the Moon to have\r\nbeen Full the next day after she was made: and this is only 9 years\r\nsooner than _Rheinholt_ makes it, and 11 years later than according to\r\n_Lange_. Whereas, they who maintain that the world was created in the\r\n4007th year before CHRIST, with the Sun on the Autumnal Equinoctial\r\nPoint, _October 26_, and the Moon then Full; will find, if they compute\r\nby the best Tables extant, that the Moon was New, instead of being Full,\r\non that day.\r\n\r\nIf it could be proved from the writings of _Moses_ that the Sun was\r\ncreated on the point of the Autumnal Equinox, and the Moon in\r\nopposition; as well as it can be proved that these Luminaries were made\r\n(or according to some, did not shine out till) on the fourth day of the\r\ncreation-week, there would be _Data_ enough for ascertaining the age of\r\nthe world: for supposing the Moon to have been Full on an Equinoctial\r\nDay, which was the fourth day of the week, it would require many\r\nthousands of years to bring these three characters together again. For,\r\nthe soonest in which the Moon returns to be New or Full on the same days\r\nof the Months as before, is 19 years wanting an hour and half, but then\r\nthe days of the week return not to the same days of the months in less\r\nthan 28 years, in which time the Moon has gone through one Course of\r\nLunations, and 9 years over; therefore a co-incidence of the Full Moon\r\nand day of the Week and Month cannot happen in that time, and if we\r\nmultiply 19 by 28, which is the nearest co-incidence of these three\r\ncharacters, namely 532 years; the Moon’s falling back an hour and half\r\nevery 19 years will amount to 42 hours in so many years; and the Equinox\r\nwill have anticipated five days. From all which we may venture to say,\r\nthat 200000 years would not be sufficient to bring all these\r\ncircumstances together again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXAMPLE III.\r\n\r\n_To find the time of Full Moon at_ Babylon _in_ March, _the year before\r\n                              Christ 721_.\r\n\r\n        The years 720 added to 1780 make 2500, or 25 Centuries.\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------+\r\n |                                    |          | Sun’s Anom. | Moon’s Ano. |\r\n |                                    | D.

Having found the Moon’s mean Anomaly for the above time,\r\nby the first and second Precepts of § 355, enter the XVth Table with the\r\nsigns and degrees of that Anomaly, and thereby take out the Moon’s\r\nHorizontal Parallax: only note, that this is given but to every 6th\r\ndegree of Anomaly in the Table, because it is very easy to make proper\r\nallowance by sight. So the Moon’s Horizontal Parallax _April_ the 1st\r\n1764, at 10 hours 25 minutes in the Forenoon, answering to her mean\r\nAnomaly at that time (namely 11^s 9° 21ʹ) is 55ʹ 7ʺ; which, diminished\r\nby 10ʺ, the Sun’s constant Horizontal Parallax, gives for the\r\nsemi-diameter of the Earth’s Disc 54ʹ 57ʺ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To find the Sun’s true Place, and his distance from the nearest\r\n                               Solstice._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third Element.]\r\n\r\n359. PRECEPT I. We are to consider, that the beginning of Aries and of\r\nLibra, which are the Equinoctial Points, are equidistant from the\r\nbeginning of Cancer and of Capricorn, which are the Solstitial Points.\r\nHence, when we know in what Sign and Degree the Sun is, we can easily\r\nfind his distance from the nearest Solstice. Now, to find the Sun’s\r\nPlace, or Longitude from Aries, _April_ the 1st, 1764, at 10 hours 21\r\nminutes in the Forenoon; being the equated time of New Moon.\r\n\r\nPRECEPT II. This being to the time of New Moon, take out the Sun’s mean\r\nPlace and Anomaly from Table II. for that time, and the Equation of his\r\nmean Place from Table XII by his Anomaly; adding the Equation to his\r\nmean Place or subtracting it from the same, as the Table directs, will\r\ngive his true Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n |                                              | Sun’s Long. | Sun’s mean |\r\n |                                              | from Aries. |  Anomaly.  |\r\n |                                              +-------------+------------+\r\n |                                              |   s   °  ʹ  |  s   °   ʹ |\r\n | Table I.

But because the Sun’s true Place is often wanted when the Moon is\r\nneither New nor Full, we shall next shew how it may be found for any\r\ngiven moment of time: though this be digressing from our present\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Table XVI find the nearest lesser year to that in which the Sun’s\r\nPlace is sought; and take out the Sun’s mean Longitude and Anomaly\r\nanswering thereto; to which add his mean motion and Anomaly for the\r\ncompleat residue of the years, with the month, day, hour, and minute,\r\nall taken from the same Table, and you have the Sun’s mean Longitude and\r\nAnomaly for the given time. Then, from Table XII take out the Sun’s\r\nEquation by means of his Anomaly (making proportions for the odd minutes\r\nof Anomaly) which Equation being added to or subtracted from the Sun’s\r\nmean Longitude from Aries, as the titles in the Table direct, gives his\r\ntrue Place, or Longitude from the beginning of Aries, reckoned according\r\nto the order of the Signs § 354.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\n_To find the Sun’s true Place_ April _30th, A.

So, the Sun’s Declination answering to\r\nhis true Place (found by § 359 to be 0^s 12° 9ʹ) is 4 degrees 48 minutes\r\n54 seconds, making allowance for the 9ʹ that his Place exceeds 12°.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _To find the Angle of the Moon’s visible Path with the Ecliptic._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fifth Element.]\r\n\r\nPRECEPT.

Having collected these Elements or Requisites, the following part\r\nof the work may be very much facilitated by means of a good Sector, with\r\nthe use of which the reader should be so well acquainted, as to know how\r\nto open it to any given Radius, as far as it will go; and to take off\r\nthe Chord or Sine of any Arc of that Radius. This is done by first\r\ntaking the extent of the given Radius in your Compasses, and then\r\nopening the Sector so as the distance cross-wise between the ends of the\r\nlines of Sines or Chords at _S_ or _C_, from Leg to Leg of the Sector,\r\nmay be equal to that extent; then, without altering the Sector, take the\r\nSine or Chord of the given Arc with your Compasses extended cross-wise\r\nfrom Leg to Leg of the Sector in these lines. But if the operator has\r\nnot a Sector, he must construct these lines to such different lengths as\r\nhe wants them in the projection. And lest this Treatise should fall into\r\nthe hands of any person who would wish to project the Figure of a solar\r\nor lunar Eclipse, and has not a Sector to do it by, we shall shew how he\r\nmay make a line of Sines or Chords to any Radius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           How to make a line of Chords.\r\n\r\n           Pl. XII.]\r\n\r\n369. Draw the right line _BCA_ at pleasure; and upon _C_ as a Center,\r\nwith the distance _CA_ or _CB_ as a Radius, describe the Semi-circle\r\n_BDA_; and from the Center _C_ draw _AC_ perpendicular to _BCA_. Then\r\ndivide the Quadrants _AD_ and _BD_ each into 90 equal parts or degrees,\r\nand join the right line _AD_ for the Chord of the Quadrant _AD_. This\r\ndone, setting one foot of the Compasses in _A_, extend the other to the\r\ndifferent divisions of the Quadrant _AD_; and so transfer them to the\r\nright line _AD_ as in the Figure, and you have a line of Chords _AD_ to\r\nthe Radius _CA_. _N. B._ 60 Degrees on the Line of Chords is always\r\nequal to the Radius of the Circle it is made from; as is evident by the\r\nFigure, where the Arch _E_, whose Center is _A_, drawn from 60 on the\r\nQuadrant _AD_, cuts the Chord line in 60 degrees, and terminates in the\r\nCenter _C_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And of Sines.]\r\n\r\nThen, from the divisions or degrees of the Quadrant _BD_, draw lines\r\nparallel to _CD_, which will fall perpendicularly on the Radius _BC_,\r\ndividing it into a line of Sines; and it will be near enough for the\r\npresent purpose, to have them to every fifth Degree, as in the Figure.\r\nAnd thus the young _Tyro_ may supply himself with Chords and Sines, if\r\nhe has not a Sector. But as the Sector greatly shortens the work, we\r\nshall describe the projection as done by it, so far as Signs and Chords\r\nare required.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. II.\r\n\r\n           Earth’s Semi-Disc.]\r\n\r\n370. Make a Scale of any convenient length (six inches at least) as\r\n_AC_, and divide it into as many equal parts as the semi-diameter of the\r\nEarth’s Disc contains minutes, which in this construction of the Eclipse\r\nfor _London_ in _April 1764_, is 54 minutes and 57 seconds; but as it\r\nwants only 3ʺ of 55ʹ the Scale may be divided into 55 equal parts, as in\r\nthe Figure. Then, with the whole length of the Scale as a Radius,\r\nsetting one foot of your Compasses in _C_ as a center, describe the\r\nSemi-circle _AMB_ for the northern Hemisphere or Semi-disc of the Earth,\r\nas seen from the Sun at that time. Had the Place for which the\r\nConstruction is made been in South Latitude, this Semi-circle would have\r\nbeen the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth’s Disc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Axis of the Ecliptic.]\r\n\r\n371. Upon the center _C_ raise the straight line _CH_ for the Axis of\r\nthe Ecliptic, perpendicular to _ACB_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: North Pole of the Earth.]\r\n\r\n372. Make a line of Chords to the Radius _AC_, and taking from thence\r\nthe Chord of 23-1/2 Degrees, set it off from _H_ to _g_ and to _h_, on\r\nthe periphery of the Semi-disc; and draw the straight line _gNh_, in\r\nwhich the North Pole of the Disc is always found.\r\n\r\n373. While the Sun is in Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and Virgo,\r\nthe North Pole of the Disc is illuminated; but while the Sun is in\r\nLibra, Scorpio, Sagittary, Capricorn, and Aquarius, the North Pole is\r\nhid in the obscure part behind the Disc.\r\n\r\n374. And, whilst the Sun is in Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries,\r\nTaurus, and Gemini, the Earth’s Axis _CP_ lies to the right hand of the\r\nAxis of the Ecliptic _CH_ as seen from the Sun, and to the left hand\r\nwhile the Sun is in the other six Signs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earth’s Axis.\r\n\r\n           Universal Meridian.]\r\n\r\n375. Make a line of Sines equal in length to _Ng_ or _Nh_, and take off\r\nwith your Compasses from it the Sine of the Sun’s distance from the\r\nnearest Solstice, which in the present case is 77° 51ʹ § 367, and set\r\nthat distance to the right hand, from _N_ to _P_, on the line _gNh_,\r\nbecause the Sun being in Aries § 359, the Earth’s Axis lies to the right\r\nhand of the Axis of the Ecliptic § 374: then draw the straight line\r\n_C_XII_P_, for the Earth’s Axis and the Universal Meridian; of both\r\nwhich _P_ is the North Pole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Path of a given Place on the Disc as seen from the Sun.]\r\n\r\n376. To draw the parallel of Latitude of any given Place (suppose\r\n_London_) which parallel is the visible Path of the Place On the Disc,\r\nas seen from the Sun, from the time that the Sun rises till it sets;\r\nsubtract the Latitude of the Place (_London_) 51-1/2 degrees from 90\r\ndegrees, and there remains 38-1/2; which take from the Line of Chords in\r\nyour Compasses, and set it from _h_ (where the Universal Meridian _CP_\r\ncuts the periphery of the Semi-disc) to VI and VI; and draw the occult\r\nLine VI_L_VI. Then, on the left hand of the Earth’s Axis, set off the\r\nChord of the Sun’s Declination 4° 48ʹ 5ʺ § 367, from VI to _D_ and to\r\n_F_; set off the same on the right hand from VI to _E_ and to _G_; and\r\ndraw the occult Lines _DsE_ and _F_XII_G_ parallel to VI _L_ VI.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Situation of the Place on the Disk from Sun-rise to Sun-set.]\r\n\r\n377. Bisect _s_ XII in _K_, and through the point _K_ draw the black\r\nLine VI_K_V1 parallel to the occult or dotted Line VI_L_VI. Then, making\r\n_AC_ the Radius or length of a Line of Lines, set off the Sine of 38-1/2\r\ndegrees, the Co-Latitude of _London_, from _K_ to VI and VI; and with\r\nthat extent as a Radius, describe the Semi-Circle VI 7 8 9 &c. and\r\ndivide it into 12 equal parts, beginning at VI. From these divisions,\r\ndraw the occult Lines 7_m_, 8_l_, 9_k_, &c. all to the Line VI_K_VI, and\r\nparallel to _C_XII_P_. Then, with _K_XII as a Radius, describe the\r\nCircle _abcdef_, round the Center _K_, and divide the Quadrant _a_XII\r\ninto six equal parts, as _ab_, _bc_, _cd_, _de_, &c. Then, through these\r\npoints of division _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, and _f_, draw the occult Lines\r\nVII_b_V, VIII_c_IIII, IX_d_III, &c. intersecting the former Lines 7_m_,\r\n8_l_, 9_k_, 10_i_, &c. in the points VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, &c. which\r\npoints mark the situation of _London_ on the Earth’s Disc as seen from\r\nthe Sun at these hours respectively, from six in the morning till six at\r\nnight: and if the elliptic Curve VI, VII, VIII, &c. be drawn through\r\nthese points, it will represent the parallel of _London_, or the path it\r\nseems to describe as viewed from the Sun, from Sun-rise to Sun-set.\r\n_N.B._ When the Sun’s Declination is North, the said Curve is the\r\ndiurnal Path of _London_; and the opposite part VI_s_VI is it’s\r\nnocturnal Path behind the Disc, or in the obscure part thereof, § 338,\r\n339. But if the Sun’s Declination had been South, the Curve VI_s_VI\r\nwould have been the diurnal path of _London_; in which case the Lines\r\n7_m_, 8_l_, &c. must have been continued thro’ the right Line VI_K_VI,\r\nand their lengths beyond that line determined by dividing the Quadrant\r\n_s a_ of the little Circle _abcd_ into six equal parts, and drawing the\r\nparallels VII_b_, VIII_c_ &c. through that division, in the same manner\r\nas done on the side _K_ XII; and the Curve VII, VIII, IX, &c. would have\r\nbeen the nocturnal Path. It is requisite to divide the hours of the\r\ndiurnal Path into quarters, as in the Diagram; and if possible into\r\nminutes also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Axis of the Moon’s Orbit.]\r\n\r\n378. From the Line of Chords § 372 take the Angle of the Moon’s visible\r\nPath with the Ecliptic, _viz._ 5° 38ʹ § 367: and note, that when the\r\nMoon’s Latitude is _North Ascending_, as in the present case, the Chord\r\nof this Angle must be set off to the left hand of the Axis of the\r\nEcliptic _CH_, as from _H_ to _M_, and the right line _CM_ drawn for the\r\nAxis of the Moon’s Orbit: but when the Moon’s Latitude is _North\r\nDescending_, this Angle and Axis must be set to the right hand, or from\r\n_H_ toward _h_. When the Moon’s Latitude _South Ascending_, the Axis of\r\nher Orbit lies the same way as when her Latitude is _North Ascending_;\r\nand when _South Descending_, the same way as when _North Descending_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Path of the Penumbra’s center over the Earth.]\r\n\r\n379. Take the Moon’s Latitude, 40ʹ 9ʺ § 367, from the Scale _CA_, and\r\nset it from _C_ to _T_ on the Axis of the Ecliptic; and through _T_, at\r\nright Angles to the Axis of the Moon’s Orbit _CM_, draw the straight\r\nLine _RTS_; which is the Moon’s Path, or Line that the center of her\r\nshadow and Penumbra describes in going over the Earth’s Disc. The Point\r\n_T_ in the Axis of the Ecliptic is the Place where the true Conjunction\r\nof the Sun and Moon falls, according to the Tables; and the Point _W_,\r\nin the Axis of the Moon’s Orbit, is that where the center of the\r\nPenumbra approaches nearest to the center of the Earth’s Disc, and\r\nconsequently the middle of the general Eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s Place on the Earth’s Disc shewn for every minute of it’s\r\n           Transit.]\r\n\r\n380. Take the Moon’s true Horary Motion from the Sun 27ʹ 50ʺ § 367, from\r\nthe Scale _CA_ with your Compasses (every division of the Scale being a\r\nminute of a Degree) and with that extent make marks in the Line of the\r\nMoon’s Path _RTS_: then divide each of these equal spaces by dots into\r\n60 equal parts or horary minutes, and set the hours to every 60th\r\nminute, in such a manner that the dot; signifying the precise minute of\r\nNew Moon by the Tables, may fall in the Point _T_ where the Axis of the\r\nEcliptic cuts the Line of the Moon’s Path; which, in this Eclipse, is\r\nthe 25th minute past ten in the Forenoon: and then the other marks will\r\nshew the places on the Earth’s Disc where the center of the Penumbra is,\r\nat the hours and minutes denoted by them, during its transit over the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Middle of the Eclipse.\r\n\r\n           It’s Phases.]\r\n\r\n381. Apply one side of a Square to the Line of the Moon’s Path, and move\r\nthe Square backward or forward until the other side cuts the same hour\r\nand minute both in the Path of the Place (_London_, in this\r\nConstruction) and Path of the Moon; and _that_ minute, cut at the same\r\ntime in both Paths, will be the precise minute of visible Conjunction of\r\nthe Sun and Moon at _London_, and therefore the time of greatest\r\nobscuration, or middle of the Eclipse at _London_; which time, in this\r\nProjection, falls at _t_, 34 minutes past 10 in the Moon’s Path; and at\r\n_u_, 34 minutes past 10 in the Path of _London_. Then, upon the Point\r\n_u_ as a center, describe the Circle _zYy_ whose Radius _uy_ is equal to\r\nthe Sun’s semi-diameter 16ʹ 6ʺ § 367, taken from the Scale _CA_: And\r\nupon the Point _t_ as a center, describe the Circle _Hy_ whose Radius is\r\nequal to the Moon’s semi-diameter 14ʹ 58ʺ § 367, taken from the same\r\nScale. The Circle _zYy_ represents the Disc of the Sun as seen from the\r\nEarth, and the Circle _Hy_ the Disc of the Moon. The portion of the\r\nSun’s Disc cut off by the Moon’s shews the Quantity of the Eclipse at\r\nthe time of greatest obscuration: and if a right Line as _yz_ be drawn\r\nacross the Sun’s Disc through _t_ and _u_, the minute of greatest\r\nobscuration in both Paths, and divided into 12 equal parts, it will shew\r\nwhat number of Digits are then eclipsed. If these two Circles do not\r\ntouch one another, the Eclipse will not be visible at the given Place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s beginning and ending.]\r\n\r\n382. Lastly, take the Semi-diameter of the Penumbra 31ʹ 4ʺ § 367, from\r\nthe Scale _CA_ with your Compasses; and setting one foot in the Moon’s\r\nPath, to the left hand of the Axis of the Ecliptic, direct the other\r\ntoward the Path of _London_; and carry this extent backwards or forwards\r\nuntil both Points of the Compasses fall into the same instants of time\r\nin both Paths: which will denote the time of the beginning of the\r\nEclipse: then, do the same on the right hand of the Axis of the\r\nEcliptic, and where both Points mark the same instants in both Paths,\r\nthey will shew at what time the Eclipse ends. These trials give the\r\nPoints _R_ in the Moon’s Path and _r_ in the Path of _London_, namely 9\r\nminutes past 9 in the Morning for the beginning of the Eclipse at\r\n_London_, _April 1, 1764_: _t_ and _u_ for the middle or greatest\r\nobscuration, at 35 minutes past 10; when the Eclipse will be barely\r\nannular on the Sun’s lower-most edge, and only two thirds of a Digit\r\nleft free on his upper-most edge: and for the end of the Eclipse, _S_ in\r\nthe Moon’s Path and _x_ in the Path of _London_, at 4 minutes past 12 at\r\nNoon.\r\n\r\nIn this Construction it is supposed that the Equator, Tropics, Parallel\r\nof _London_, and Meridians through every 15th degree of Longitude are\r\nprojected in visible Lines on the Earth’s Disc, as seen from the Sun at\r\nalmost an infinite distance; that the Angle under which the Moon’s\r\ndiameter is seen, during the time of the Eclipse, continues invariably\r\nthe same; that the Moon’s motion is uniform, and her Path rectilineal,\r\nfor that time. But all these suppositions do not exactly agree with the\r\ntruth; and therefore, supposing the Elements § 367, given by the Tables\r\nto be perfectly accurate, yet the time and phases of the Eclipse deduced\r\nfrom it’s Construction will not answer exactly to what passeth in the\r\nHeavens; but may be two or three minutes wrong though done with the\r\nutmost care. Moreover, the Paths of all Places of considerable Latitude\r\ngo nearer the center of the Disc as seen from the Moon than these\r\nConstructions make them; because the Earth’s Disc is projected as if the\r\nEarth were a perfect sphere, although it is known to be a spheroid.\r\nConsequently, the Moon’s shadow will go farther North in places of\r\nnorthern Latitude, and farther South in places of southern Latitude than\r\nthese projections answer to. Hence we may venture to predict that this\r\nEclipse will be more annular at _London_ (that is, the annulus will be\r\nsomewhat broader on the southern Limb of the Sun) than the Diagram shews\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n383. Having shewn how to compute the times and project the phases of a\r\nSolar Eclipse, we now proceed to those of the Lunar. And it has been\r\nalready mentioned § 317, that when the Full Moon is within 12 degrees of\r\neither of her Nodes, she must be eclipsed. We shall now enquire whether\r\nor no the Moon will be eclipsed _May 18, 1761, N. S._ at 32 minutes past\r\n10 at Night. See page 193.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Table IV.\r\n\r\n           Table VI.]\r\n\r\n                                                              s  °  ʹ\r\n Sun from Node at Full Moon in _March 1761_                   9 25 27\r\n Add his distance for two Lunations, to bring it into _May_   2  1 20\r\n                                                             ---------\r\n And his distance at Full Moon in that month is              11 26 47\r\n\r\nSubtract this from a Circle, or 12 Signs, and there will remain 3° 13ʹ;\r\nwhich is all that the Sun wants of coming round to the Ascending Node;\r\nand the Moon being then opposite to the Sun, must be just as near the\r\nDescending Node: consequently, far within the limit of an Eclipse.\r\n\r\n384. Knowing then that the Moon will be eclipsed in _May 1761_, we must\r\nfind her true distance from the Node at that time, by applying the\r\nproper Equations as taught § 363, and then find her true Latitude as\r\ntaught in that article.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Table IV.\r\n\r\n           Table XIII.\r\n\r\n           Table XII.]\r\n\r\n                                                              s  °  ʹ\r\n Sun’s mean distance from the Node at F.

Having by the foregoing precepts § 355 found the true time of\r\nOpposition of the Sun and Moon in a lunar Eclipse, with the Moon’s\r\nAnomaly enter Table XV and take out her horizontal Parallax, also her\r\ntrue horary Motion and Semi-diameter: and likewise those of the Sun by\r\nhis Anomaly, as already taught § 364 & _seq._ Then add the Sun’s\r\nhorizontal Parallax, which is always 10 Seconds, to the Moon’s\r\nhorizontal Parallax, and from their sum subtract the Sun’s\r\nSemi-diameter; the remainder will be the Semi-diameter of that part of\r\nthe Earth’s shadow which the Moon goes through.\r\n\r\n386. From the Sum of the Semi-diameters of the Moon and Earth’s Shadow,\r\nsubtract the Moon’s Latitude; the remainder is the parts deficient.\r\nThen, as the Semi-diameter of the Moon is to 6 Digits, so are the parts\r\ndeficient to the Digits eclipsed.\r\n\r\n387. If the parts deficient be more than the Moon’s Diameter, the\r\nEclipse will be total with continuance; if less, it will not be total;\r\nif equal, it will be total, but without continuance.\r\n\r\n388.

This done, make a Scale of any convenient length as _W_, whereof\r\neach division is a minute of a degree; and take from it in your\r\nCompasses 54 Minutes 50 Seconds, the Sum of Semi-diameters of the Moon\r\nand Earth’s shadow; and with that extent as a Radius, describe that\r\nCircle _OVLG_ round _C_ as a Center.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Scale take 39 Minutes 48 Seconds, the Semi-diameter of the\r\nEarth’s shadow, and therewith as a Radius, describe the Circle _UUUU_\r\nfor the Earth’s shadow, round _C_ as a Center. Subtract the Moon’s\r\nSemi-diameter from the Semi-diameter of the Shadow, and with the\r\ndifference 24 Minutes 46 seconds as a Radius, taken from the Scale _W_,\r\ndescribe the Circle _YZ_ round the Center _C_.\r\n\r\nDraw the right line _AB_ through the Center _C_ for the Ecliptic, and\r\ncross it at right Angles with the line _EG_ for the Axis of the\r\nEcliptic.\r\n\r\nBecause the Moon’s Latitude in this Eclipse is North Descending, § 384,\r\nset off the Angle of her visible Path with the Ecliptic 5 Degrees 38\r\nMinutes (Page 202.) from _E_ to _V_; and draw _VCv_ for the Axis of the\r\nMoon’s Orbit. Had the Moon’s Latitude been North Ascending, this Angle\r\nmust have been set off from _E_ to _f_. _N. B._ When the Moon’s Latitude\r\nis South Ascending, the Axis of her Orbit lies the same way as when she\r\nhas North Ascending Latitude; and when her Latitude is North Descending,\r\nthe Axis of her Orbit lies the same way as when her Latitude is South\r\nDescending.\r\n\r\nTake the Moon’s true Latitude 9ʹ 56ʺ in your Compasses from the Scale\r\n_W_, and set it off from _C_ to _F_ on the Axis of the Ecliptic because\r\nthe Moon is north of the Ecliptic; (had she been to the South of it, her\r\nLatitude must have been set off the contrary way, as from _C_ towards\r\n_v_:) and through _F_, at right Angles to the Axis of the Moon’s Orbit\r\n_VCv_, draw the right line _LMHNO_ for the Moon’s Orbit, or her Path\r\nthrough the Earth’s shadow. _N. B._ When the Moon’s Latitude is North\r\nAscending, or North Descending, she is above the Ecliptic: but when her\r\nLatitude is South Ascending, or South Descending, she is below it.\r\n\r\nTake the Moon’s true horary motion from the Sun, _viz._ 28 Minutes 22\r\nSeconds, from the Scale _W_ in your Compasses; and with that extent make\r\nmarks in the line of the Moon’s Path _LMHNO_: then divide each of these\r\nequal spaces into 60 equal parts or minutes of time: and set the hours\r\nto them as in the Figure, in such a manner that the precise time of Full\r\nMoon, as shewn by the Tables, may fall in the Axis of the Ecliptic at\r\n_F_, where the line of the Moon Path cuts it.\r\n\r\nLastly, Take the Moon’s Semi-diameter 15 Minutes 2 Seconds from the\r\nScale _W_ in your Compasses, and therewith as a Radius describe the\r\nCircles _P_, _Q_, _R_, _S_, and _T_ on the Centers _L_, _M_, _H_, _N_,\r\nand _O_; the Circles _P_ and _T_ just touching the Earth’s Shadow _UU_,\r\nbut no part of them within it; the Circles _Q_ and _S_ all within it,\r\nbut touching at its edges; and the Circle _R_ in the middle of the\r\nMoon’s Path through the shadow. So the Circle _P_ shall be the Moon\r\ntouching the shadow at the moment the Eclipse begins; the Circle _Q_ the\r\nMoon just immersed into the shadow at the moment she is totally\r\neclipsed; the Circle _R_ the Moon at the greatest obscuration, in the\r\nmiddle of the Eclipse; the Circle _S_ the Moon just beginning to be\r\nenlightened on her western limb at the end of total darkness; and the\r\nCircle _T_ the Moon quite clear of the Earth’s shadow at the moment the\r\nEclipse ends. The moments of time marked at the points _L_, _M_, _H_,\r\n_N_ and _O_ answer to these Phenomena: and according to this small\r\nprojection are as follow. The beginning of the Eclipse at 8 Hours 36\r\nMinutes _P. M._ The total immersion at 9 Hours 42 Minutes. The middle of\r\nthe Eclipse at 10 Hours 26 Minutes. The end of total darkness at 11\r\nHours 12 Minutes. And the end of the Eclipse at 12 Hours 18 Minutes; but\r\nthe Figure is too small to admit of precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The examination of antient Eclipses.]\r\n\r\n390. By computing the times of New and Full Moons, together with the\r\ndistance of the Sun and Moon from the Nodes; and knowing that when the\r\nSun is within 17 Degrees of either Node at New Moon he must be eclipsed;\r\nand when the Moon is within 12 Degrees of either Node at Full she cannot\r\nescape an Eclipse; and that there can be no Eclipses without these\r\nlimits; ’tis easy to examine whether the accounts of antient Eclipses\r\nrecorded in history be true. I shall take the liberty to examine two of\r\nthose mentioned in the foregoing catalogue, namely, that of the Moon at\r\n_Babylon_ on the 19th of _March_ in the 721st year before CHRIST; and\r\nthat of the Sun at _Athens_, on the 20th of _March_, in the 424th year\r\nbefore CHRIST.\r\n\r\nThe time of Full Moon for the former of these Eclipses is already\r\ncalculated, Page 198, and the time of New Moon for the latter, Page 196,\r\nboth to the _Old Style_; so that we have nothing now to do but find the\r\nSun’s distance from the Nodes the same way as we did the Anomalies; and\r\nif the Full Moon in _March_ 721 years before CHRIST was within 12\r\ndegrees of either Node, she was then eclipsed; and if the Sun, at the\r\ntime of New Moon in _March_ 424 years before CHRIST was within 17\r\ndegrees of either Node, he must have been eclipsed at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EXAMPLE I.\r\n\r\n_To find the distance of the Sun and Moon from the Nodes, at the time of\r\n       Full Moon in_ March, _the year before_ CHRIST _721, O.

But the retrograde Motion of the Node for these Lunations\r\nmust be subtracted from it’s longitude from Aries in _March_, to have\r\nit’s Longitude or Place in the _March_ following.\r\n\r\n

XX.\r\n\r\n                         _Of the fixed Stars._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the fixed Stars appear bigger when viewed by the bare eye\r\n           than when seen through a telescope.]\r\n\r\n391. The Stars are said to be fixed, because they have been generally\r\nobserved to keep at the same distance from each other: their apparent\r\ndiurnal revolutions being caused solely by the Earth’s turning on its\r\nAxis. They appear of a sensible magnitude to the bare eye, because the\r\nretina is affected not only by the rays of light which are emitted\r\ndirectly from them, but by many thousands more, which falling upon our\r\neye-lids, and upon the aerial particles about us, are reflected into our\r\neyes so strongly as to excite vibrations not only in those points of the\r\nretina where the real images of the Stars are formed, but also in other\r\npoints at some distance round about. This makes us imagine the Stars to\r\nbe much bigger than they would appear, if we saw them only by the few\r\nrays which come directly from them, so as to enter our eyes without\r\nbeing intermixed with others. Any one may be sensible of this, by\r\nlooking at a Star of the first Magnitude through a long narrow tube;\r\nwhich, though it takes in as much of the sky as would hold a thousand\r\nsuch Stars, yet scarce renders that one visible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A proof that they shine by their own light.]\r\n\r\nThe more a telescope magnifies, the less is the aperture through which\r\nthe Star is seen; and consequently the fewer rays it admits into the\r\neye. Now since the Stars appear less in a telescope which magnifies 200\r\ntimes than they do to the bare eye, insomuch that they seem to be only\r\nindivisible points, it proves at once both that the Stars are at immense\r\ndistances from us, and that they shine by their own proper light. If\r\nthey shone by borrowed light they would be as invisible without\r\ntelescopes as the Satellites of Jupiter are: for these Satellites appear\r\nbigger when viewed with a good telescope than the largest fixed Stars\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their number much less than is generally imagined.]\r\n\r\n392. The number of Stars discoverable, in either Hemisphere, by the\r\nnaked eye, is not above a thousand. This at first may appear incredible,\r\nbecause they seem to be without number: But the deception arises from\r\nour looking confusedly upon them, without reducing them into any order.\r\nFor look but stedfastly upon a pretty large portion of the sky, and\r\ncount the number of Stars in it, you will be surprised to find them so\r\nfew. Or, if one considers how seldom the Moon meets with any Stars in\r\nher way, although there are as many about her Path as in other parts of\r\nthe Heavens (the _Milky way_ excepted) he will soon be convinced that\r\nthe Stars are much thinner sown than he was aware of. The _British_\r\ncatalogue, which, besides the Stars visible to the bare eye, includes a\r\ngreat number which cannot be seen without the assistance of a telescope,\r\ncontains no more than 3000, in both Hemispheres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The absurdity of supposing the Stars were made only to\r\n           enlighten our nights.]\r\n\r\n393. As we have incomparably more light from the Moon than from all the\r\nStars together, it were the greatest absurdity to imagine that the Stars\r\nwere made for no other purpose than to cast a faint light upon the\r\nEarth: especially since many more require the assistance of a good\r\ntelescope to find them out, than are visible without that Instrument.\r\nOur Sun is surrounded by a system of Planets and Comets; all which would\r\nbe invisible from the nearest fixed Star. And from what we already know\r\nof the immense distance of the Stars, the nearest may be computed at\r\n32,000,000,000,000 of miles from us which is more than a cannon bullet\r\nwould fly in 7,000,000 of years. Hence ’tis easy to prove, that the Sun\r\nseen from such a distance, would appear no bigger than a Star of the\r\nfirst magnitude. From all this it is highly probable that each Star is a\r\nSun to a system of worlds moving round it though unseen by us;\r\nespecially, as the doctrine of a plurality of worlds is rational, and\r\ngreatly manifests the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of the great Creator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their different Magnitudes.]\r\n\r\n394. The Stars, on account of their apparently various magnitudes, have\r\nbeen distributed into several classes or orders. Those which appear\r\nlargest are called _Stars of the first magnitude_; the next to them in\r\nlustre, _Stars of the second magnitude_, and so on to the _sixth_, which\r\nare the smallest that are visible to the bare eye. This distribution\r\nhaving been made long before the invention of telescopes, the Stars\r\nwhich cannot be seen without the assistance of these instruments are\r\ndistinguished by the name of _Telescopic Stars_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And division into Constellations.]\r\n\r\n395. The antients divided the starry Sphere into particular\r\nConstellations, or Systems of Stars, according as they lay near one\r\nanother, so as to occupy those spaces which the figures of different\r\nsorts of animals or things would take up, if they were there delineated.\r\nAnd those Stars which could not be brought into any particular\r\nConstellation were called _unformed Stars_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The use of this division.]\r\n\r\n396. This division of the Stars into different Constellations or\r\nAsterisms, serves to distinguish them from one another, so that any\r\nparticular Star may be readily found in the Heavens by means of a\r\nCelestial Globe; on which the Constellations are so delineated as to put\r\nthe most remarkable Stars into such parts of the figures as are most\r\neasily distinguished. The number of the antient Constellations is 48,\r\nand upon our present Globes about 70. On _Senex_’s Globes are inserted\r\n_Bayer_’s Letters; the first in the Greek Alphabet being put to the\r\nbiggest Star in each Constellation, the second to the next, and so on:\r\nby which means, every Star is as easily found as if a name were given to\r\nit. Thus, if the Star γ in the Constellation of the _Ram_ be mentioned,\r\nevery Astronomer knows as well what Star is meant as if it were pointed\r\nout to him in the Heavens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Zodiac_.]\r\n\r\n397. There is also a division of the Heavens into three parts. 1. The\r\n_Zodiac_, (ζωδιακὸς) from ζώδιον _Zodion_ an Animal, because most of the\r\nConstellations in it, which are twelve in number, are the figures of\r\nAnimals: as _Aries_ the Ram, _Taurus_ the Bull, _Gemini_ the Twins,\r\n_Cancer_ the Crab, _Leo_ the Lion, _Virgo_ the Virgin, _Libra_ the\r\nBalance, _Scorpio_ the Scorpion, _Sagittarius_ the Archer, _Capricornus_\r\nthe Goat, _Aquarius_ the Water-bearer, and _Pisces_ the Fishes. The\r\nZodiac goes quite round the Heavens: it is about 16 degrees broad, so\r\nthat it takes in the Orbits of all the Planets, and likewise the Orbit\r\nof the Moon. Along the middle of this Zone or Belt is the Ecliptic, or\r\nCircle which the Earth describes annually as seen from the Sun; and\r\nwhich the Sun appears to describe as seen from the Earth. 2. All that\r\nRegion of the Heavens, which is on the north side of the Zodiac,\r\ncontaining 21 Constellations. And 3. that on the south side, containing\r\n15.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The manner of dividing it by the antients.]\r\n\r\n398. The antients divided the _Zodiac_ into the above 12 Constellations\r\nor Signs in the following manner. They took a vessel with a small hole\r\nin the bottom, and having filled it with water, suffered the same to\r\ndistil drop by drop into another Vessel set beneath to receive it;\r\nbeginning at the moment when some Star rose, and continuing until it\r\nrose the next following night. The water fallen down into the receiver\r\nthey divided into twelve equal parts; and having two other small vessels\r\nin readiness, each of them fit to contain one part, they again poured\r\nall the water into the upper vessel, and strictly observing the rising\r\nof some Star in the _Zodiac_, they at the same time suffered the water\r\nto drop into one of the small vessels; and as soon as it was full, they\r\nshifted it and set an empty one in it’s place. By this means, when each\r\nvessel was full, they observed what Star of the _Zodiac_ rose; and\r\nthough not possible in one night, yet in many, they observed the rising\r\nof twelve Stars, by which they divided the _Zodiac_ into twelve parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n399. The names of the Constellations, and the number of Stars observed\r\nin each of them by different Astronomers, are as follows.\r\n\r\nKey to table P = _Ptolemy._ T = _Tycho._ H = _Hevelius._ F

There is a remarkable track round the Heavens, called the _Milky\r\nWay_ from its peculiar whiteness, which is owing to a great number of\r\nStars scattered therein; none of which can be distinctly seen without\r\ntelescopes. This track appears single in some parts, in others double.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lucid Spots.]\r\n\r\n401. There are several little whitish spots in the Heavens, which appear\r\nmagnified, and more luminous when seen through telescopes; yet without\r\nany Stars in them. One of these is in _Andromeda_’s girdle, first\r\nobserved _A. D._ 1612, by _Simon Marius_; and which has some whitish\r\nrays near its middle: it is liable to several changes, and is sometimes\r\ninvisible. Another is near the Ecliptic, between the head and bow of\r\n_Sagittarius_: it is small, but very luminous. A third is on the back of\r\nthe _Centaur_, which is too far South to be seen in _Britain_. A fourth,\r\nof a smaller size, is before _Antinous_’s right foot; having a Star in\r\nit, which makes it appear more bright. A fifth is in the Constellation\r\nof _Hercules_, between the Stars ζ and η, which spot, though but small,\r\nis visible to the bare eye if the sky be clear and the Moon absent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cloudy Stars.\r\n\r\n           Magellanic Clouds.]\r\n\r\n402. _Cloudy Stars_ are so called from their misty appearance. They look\r\nlike dim Stars to the naked eye; but through a telescope they appear\r\nbroad illuminated parts of the sky; in some of which is one Star, in\r\nothers more. Five of these are mentioned by _Ptolemy_. 1. One at the\r\nextremity of the right hand of _Perseus_. 2. One in the middle of the\r\n_Crab_. 3. One unformed, near the Sting of the _Scorpion_. 4. The eye of\r\n_Sagittarius_. 5. One in the head of _Orion_. In the first of these\r\nappear more Stars through the telescope than in any of the rest,\r\nalthough 21 have been counted in the head of _Orion_, and above 40 in\r\nthat of the _Crab_. Two are visible in the eye of _Sagittarius_ without\r\na telescope, and several more with it. _Flamsteed_ observed a cloudy\r\nStar in the bow of _Sagittarius_, containing many small Stars: and the\r\nStar _d_ above _Sagittary_’s right shoulder is encompassed with several\r\nmore. Both _Cassini_ and _Flamsteed_ discovered one between the _Great_\r\nand _Little Dog_, which is very full of Stars visible only by the\r\ntelescope. The two whitish spots near the South Pole, called the\r\n_Magellanic Clouds_ by Sailors, which to the bare eye resemble part of\r\nthe Milky-Way, appear through telescopes to be a mixture of small Clouds\r\nand Stars. But the most remarkable of all the cloudy Stars is that in\r\nthe middle of _Orion’s Sword_, where seven Stars (of which three are\r\nvery close together) seem to shine through a cloud, very lucid near the\r\nmiddle, but faint and ill defined about the edges. It looks like a gap\r\nin the sky, through which one may see (as it were) part of a much\r\nbrighter region. Although most of these spaces are but a few minutes of\r\na degree in breadth, yet, since they are among the fixed Stars, they\r\nmust be spaces larger than what is occupied by our solar System; and in\r\nwhich there seems to be a perpetual uninterrupted day among numberless\r\nWorlds which no human art ever can discover.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in the Heavens.]\r\n\r\n403. Several Stars are mentioned by antient Astronomers, which are not\r\nnow to be found; and others are now visible to the bare eye which are\r\nnot recorded in the antient catalogues. _Hipparchus_ observed a new Star\r\nabout 120 years before CHRIST; but he has not mentioned in what part of\r\nthe Heavens it was seen, although it occasioned his making a catalogue\r\nof the Stars; which is the most antient that we have.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New Stars.]\r\n\r\nThe first _New Star_ that we have any good account of, was discovered by\r\n_Cornelius Gemma_ on the 8th of _November_ A. D. 1572, in the Chair of\r\nCassiopea. It surpassed _Sirius_ in brightness and magnitude; and was\r\nseen for 16 months successively. At first it appeared bigger than\r\n_Jupiter_ to some eyes, by which it was seen even at mid-day: afterwards\r\nit decayed gradually both in magnitude and lustre, until _March_ 1573,\r\nwhen it became invisible.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of _August_ 1596, _David Fabricius_ observed the _Stella\r\nMira_, or wonderful Star, in the _Neck_ of the _Whale_; which has been\r\nsince found to appear and disappear periodically, seven times in six\r\nyears, continuing in its greatest lustre for 15 days together; and is\r\nnever quite extinguished.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1600, _William Jansenius_ discovered a changeable Star in\r\nthe _Neck_ of the _Swan_; which, in time became so small as to be\r\nthought to disappear entirely, till the years 1657, 1658, and 1659, when\r\nit recovered its former lustre and magnitude; but soon decayed, and is\r\nnow of the smallest size.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1604 _Kepler_ and several of his friends saw a new Star near\r\nthe heel of the right foot of _Serpentarius_, so bright and sparkling\r\nthat it exceeded any thing they had ever seen before; and took notice\r\nthat it was every moment changing into some of the colours of the\r\nrainbow, except when it was near the horizon, at which time it was\r\ngenerally white. It surpassed _Jupiter_ in magnitude, which was near it\r\nall the month of _October_, but easily distinguished from it by a steady\r\nlight. It disappeared between _October_ 1605 and the _February_\r\nfollowing, and has not been seen since that time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1670, _July_ 15, _Hevelius_ discovered a new Star, which in\r\n_October_ was so decayed as to be scarce perceptible. In _April_\r\nfollowing it regained its lustre, but wholly disappeared in _August_. In\r\n_March_ 1672 it was seen again, but very small; and has not been visible\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1686 a new Star was discovered by _Kirch_, which returns\r\nperiodically in 404 days.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1672, _Cassini_ saw a Star in the _Neck_ of the Bull, which\r\nhe thought was not visible in _Tycho_’s time; nor when _Bayer_ made his\r\nFigures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cannot be Comets.]\r\n\r\n404. Many Stars, besides those above-mentioned, have been observed to\r\nchange their magnitudes: and as none of them could ever be perceived to\r\nhave tails, ’tis plain they could not be Comets; especially as they had\r\nno parallax, even when largest and brightest. It would seem that the\r\nperiodical Stars have vast clusters of dark spots, and very slow\r\nrotations on their Axis; by which means, they must disappear when the\r\nside covered with spots is turned towards us. And as for those which\r\nbreak out all of a sudden with such lustre, ’tis by no means improbable\r\nthat they are Suns whose Fuel is almost spent, and again supplied by\r\nsome of their Comets falling upon them, and occasioning an uncommon\r\nblaze and splendor for some time: which indeed appears to be the\r\ngreatest use of the cometary part of any system[86].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some Stars change their Places.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Stars, particularly _Arcturus_, have been observed to change\r\ntheir places above a minute of a degree with respect to others. But\r\nwhether this be owing to any real motion in the Stars themselves, must\r\nrequire the observations of many ages to determine. If our solar System\r\nchangeth its Place, with regard to absolute space, this must in process\r\nof time occasion an apparent change in the distances of the Stars from\r\neach other: and in such a case, the places of the nearest Stars to us\r\nbeing more affected than of those which are very remote, their relative\r\npositions must seem to alter, though the Stars themselves were really\r\nimmoveable. On the other hand, if our own system be at rest, and any of\r\nthe Stars in real motion, this must vary their positions; and the more\r\nso, the nearer they are to us, or the swifter their motions are; or the\r\nmore proper the direction of their motion is, for our perception.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ecliptic less oblique now to the Equator than formerly.]\r\n\r\n405. The obliquity of the Ecliptic to the Equinoctial is found at\r\npresent to be above a third part of a degree less than _Ptolemy_ found\r\nit. And most of the observers after him found it to decrease gradually\r\ndown to _Tycho_’s time. If it be objected, that we cannot depend on the\r\nobservations of the antients, because of the incorrectness of their\r\nInstruments; we have to answer, that both _Tycho_ and _Flamsteed_ are\r\nallowed to have been very good observers: and yet we find that\r\n_Flamsteed_ makes this obliquely 2-1/2 minutes of a degree less than\r\n_Tycho_ did, about 100 years before him: and as _Ptolemy_ was 1324 years\r\nbefore _Tycho_, so the gradual decrease answers nearly to the difference\r\nof time between these three Astronomers. If we consider, that the Earth\r\nis not a perfect sphere, but an oblate spheroid, having its Axis shorter\r\nthan its Equatoreal diameter; and that the Sun and Moon are constantly\r\nacting obliquely upon the greater quantity of matter about the Equator,\r\npulling it, as it were, towards a nearer and nearer co-incidence with\r\nthe Ecliptic; it will not appear improbable that these actions should\r\ngradually diminish the Angle between those Planes. Nor is it less\r\nprobable that the mutual attractions of all the Planets should have a\r\ntendency to bring the planes of all their Orbits to a co-incidence: but\r\nthis change is too small to become sensible in many ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Division of Time. A perpetual Table of New Moons._ _The Times of\r\nthe Birth and Death of_ CHRIST. _A Table of remarkable Æras or Events._\r\n\r\n\r\n406. The parts of time are _Seconds_, _Minutes_, _Hours_, _Days_,\r\n_Years_, _Cycles_, _Ages_, and _Periods_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Year.]\r\n\r\n407. The original standard, or integral measure of Time, is a year;\r\nwhich is determined by the Revolution of some Celestial Body in its\r\nOrbit, _viz._ the _Sun_ or _Moon_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tropical Year.]\r\n\r\n408. The time measured by the Sun’s Revolution in the Ecliptic, from any\r\nEquinox or Solstice to the same again, is called the _Solar_ or\r\n_Tropical Year_, which contains 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 57 seconds;\r\nand is the only proper or natural year, because it always keeps the same\r\nseasons to the same months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sidereal year.]\r\n\r\n409. The quantity of time, measured by the Sun’s Revolution, as from any\r\nfixed Star to the same Star again, is called the _Sidereal Year_; which\r\ncontains 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 14-1/2 seconds; and is 20 minutes\r\n17-1/2 seconds longer than the true Solar Year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lunar Year.]\r\n\r\n410. The time measured by twelve Revolutions of the Moon, from the Sun\r\nto the Sun again, is called the _Lunar Year_; it contains 354 days 8\r\nhours 48 minutes 37 seconds; and is therefore 10 days 21 hours 0 minutes\r\n20 seconds shorter than the Solar Year. This is the foundation of the\r\nEpact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil Year.]\r\n\r\n411. The _Civil Year_ is that which is in common use among the different\r\nnations of the world; of which, some reckon by the Lunar, but most by\r\nthe Solar. The Civil Solar Year contains 365 days, for three years\r\nrunning, which are called _Common Years_; and then comes in what is\r\ncalled the _Bissextile_ or _Leap-Year_, which contains 366 days. This is\r\nalso called the _Julian Year_ on account of _Julius Cæsar_, who\r\nappointed the Intercalary-day every fourth year, thinking thereby to\r\nmake the Civil and Solar Year keep pace together. And this day, being\r\nadded to the 23d of _February_, which in the _Roman_ Calendar, was the\r\nsixth of the Calends of _March_, _that_ sixth day was twice reckoned, or\r\nthe 23d and 24th were reckoned as one day; and was called _Bis sextus\r\ndies_, and thence came the name _Bissextile_ for that year. But in our\r\ncommon Almanacks this day is added at the end of _February_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lunar Year.]\r\n\r\n412. The _Civil Lunar Year_ is also common or intercalary. The common\r\nYear consists of 12 Lunations, which contain 354 days; at the end of\r\nwhich, the year begins again. The _Intercalary_, or _Embolimic_ Year is\r\nthat wherein a month was added, to adjust the Lunar Year to the Solar.\r\nThis method was used by the _Jews_, who kept their account by the Lunar\r\nMotions. But by intercalating no more than a month of 30 days, which\r\nthey called _Ve-Adar_, every third year, they fell 3-3/4 days short of\r\nthe Solar Year in that time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Roman_ Year.]\r\n\r\n413. The _Romans_ also used the _Lunar Embolimic Year_ at first, as it\r\nwas settled by _Romulus_ their first King, who made it to consist only\r\nof ten months or Lunations; which fell 61 days short of the Solar Year,\r\nand so their year became quite vague and unfixed; for which reason, they\r\nwere forced to have a Table published by the High Priest, to inform them\r\nwhen the spring and other seasons began. But _Julius Cæsar_, as already\r\nmentioned, § 411, taking this troublesome affair into consideration,\r\nreformed the Calendar, by making the year to consist of 365 days 6\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The original of the _Gregorian_, or _New Style_.]\r\n\r\n414. The year thus settled, is what we still make use of in _Britain_:\r\nbut as it is somewhat more than 11 minutes longer than the _Solar\r\nTropical Year_, the times of the Equinoxes go backward, and fall earlier\r\nby one day in about 130 years. In the time of the _Nicene Council_ (A.\r\nD. 325.) which was 1431 years ago, the vernal Equinox fell on the 21st\r\nof _March_: and, if we divide 1431 by 130, it will quote 11, which is\r\nthe number of days the Equinox has fallen back since the Council of\r\n_Nice_. This causing great disturbances, by unfixing the times of the\r\ncelebration of _Easter_, and consequently of all the other moveable\r\nFeasts, Pope _Gregory_ the 13th, in the year 1582 ordered ten days to be\r\nat once struck out of that year; and the next day after the fourth of\r\n_October_ was called the fifteenth. By this means the vernal Equinox was\r\nrestored to the 21st of _March_; and it was endeavoured, by the omission\r\nof three intercalary days in 400 years, to make the civil or political\r\nyear keep pace with the Solar for time to come. This new form of the\r\nyear is called the _Gregorian Account_ or _New Style_; which is received\r\nin all Countries where the Pope’s Authority is acknowledged, and ought\r\nto be in all places where truth is regarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Months.]\r\n\r\n415. The principal division of the year is into _Months_, which are of\r\ntwo sorts, namely _Astronomical_ and _Civil_. The Astronomical month is\r\nthe time in which the Moon runs through the _Zodiac_, and is either\r\n_Periodical_ or _Synodical_. The Periodical Month is the time spent by\r\nthe Moon in making one compleat Revolution from any point of the Zodiac\r\nto the same again; which is 27^d 7^h 43^m. The Synodical Month, called a\r\n_Lunation_, is the time contained between the Moon’s parting with the\r\nSun at a Conjunction, and returning to him again; which is in 29^d 12^h\r\n44^m. The Civil Months are those which are framed for the uses of Civil\r\nlife; and are different as to their names, number of days, and times of\r\nbeginning, in several different Countries. The first month of the\r\n_Jewish Year_ fell according to the Moon in our _August_ and\r\n_September_, Old Style; the second in _September_ and _October_, and so\r\non. The first month of the _Egyptian Year_ began on the 29th of our\r\n_August_. The first month of the _Arabic_ and _Turkish Year_ began the\r\n16th of _July_. The first month of the _Grecian Year_ fell according to\r\nthe Moon in _June_ and _July_, the second in _July_ and _August_, and so\r\non, as in the following Table.\r\n\r\n +----+--------------------------+----++----+-----------------------+----+\r\n |N^o |     The Jewish year.     |Days||N^o |   The Egyptian year.  |Days|\r\n +----+--------------------------+----++----+-----------------------+----+\r\n |  1 |Tisri           Aug.-Sept.| 30 ||  1 |Thoth      August   29 | 30 |\r\n |  2 |Marchesvan      Sept.-Oct.| 29 ||  2 |Paophi     Septemb. 28 | 30 |\r\n |  3 |Casleu          Oct.-Nov. | 30 ||  3 |Athir      October  28 | 30 |\r\n |  4 |Tebeth          Nov.-Dec. | 29 ||  4 |Chojac     Novemb.  27 | 30 |\r\n |  5 |Shebat          Dec.-Jan. | 30 ||  5 |Tybi       Decemb.  27 | 30 |\r\n |  6 |Adar            Jan.-Feb. | 29 ||  6 |Mechir     January  26 | 30 |\r\n |  7 |Nisan _or_ Abib Feb.-Mar. | 30 ||  7 |Phamenoth  Februar. 25 | 30 |\r\n |  8 |Jiar            Mar.-Apr. | 29 ||  8 |Parmuthi   March    27 | 30 |\r\n |  9 |Sivan           April-May | 30 ||  9 |Pachon     April    26 | 30 |\r\n | 10 |Tamuz           May-June  | 29 || 10 |Payni      May      26 | 30 |\r\n | 11 |Ab              June-July | 30 || 11 |Epiphi     June     25 | 30 |\r\n | 12 |Elul            July-Aug. | 29 || 12 |Mesori     July     25 | 30 |\r\n +----+--------------------------+----++----+-----------------------+----+\r\n |     Days in the year          |354 || _Epagomenæ_ or days added  |  5 |\r\n +-------------------------------+----++----------------------------+----+\r\n |In the __Embolimic_ year after |    ||    Days in the year        |365 |\r\n |  _Adar_ they added a month    |    ||                            |    |\r\n |  called _Ve-Adar_ of 30 days. |    ||                            |    |\r\n +-------------------------------+----++----------------------------+----+\r\n +---+-------------------------+----++---+----------------------------+----+\r\n |N^o|The _Arabic_ and         |Days||N^o|The ancient _Grecian_ year. |Days|\r\n |   |  _Turkish_ year.        |    ||   |                            |    |\r\n +---+-------------------------+----++---+----------------------------+----+\r\n | 1 |Muharram     July     16 | 30 || 1 |Hecatombæon     June-July   | 30 |\r\n | 2 |Saphar       August   15 | 29 || 2 |Metagitnion     July-Aug.   | 29 |\r\n | 3 |Rabia I.

A month is divided into four parts called _Weeks_, and a Week into\r\nseven parts called _Days_; so that in a _Julian_ Year there are 13 such\r\nMonths, or 52 Weeks, and one Day over. The Gentiles gave the names of\r\nthe Sun, Moon, and Planets to the Days of the Week. To the first, the\r\nName of the _Sun_; to the second, of the _Moon_; to the third, of\r\n_Mars_; to the fourth, of _Mercury_; to the fifth, of _Jupiter_; and to\r\nthe sixth, of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Days]\r\n\r\n417. A Day is either _Natural_ or _Artificial_. The Natural Day contains\r\n24 hours; the Artificial the time from Sun-rise to Sun-set. The Natural\r\nDay is either _Astronomical_ or _Civil_. The Astronomical Day begins at\r\nNoon, because the increase and decrease of Days terminated by the\r\nHorizon are very unequal among themselves; which inequality is likewise\r\naugmented by the inconstancy of the horizontal Refractions § 183: and\r\ntherefore the Astronomer takes the Meridian for the limit of diurnal\r\nRevolutions; reckoning Noon, that is the instant when the Sun’s Center\r\nis on the Meridian, for the beginning of the Day. The _British_,\r\n_French_, _Dutch_, _Germans_, _Spaniards_, _Portuguese_, and\r\n_Egyptians_, begin the Civil Day at mid-night: the antient _Greeks_,\r\n_Jews_, _Bohemians_, _Silesians_, with the modern _Italians_, and\r\n_Chinese_, begin it at Sun-setting: And the antient _Babylonians_,\r\n_Persians_, _Syrians_, with the modern _Greeks_, at Sun-rising.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hours]\r\n\r\n418. An _Hour_ is a certain determinate part of the Day, and is either\r\nequal or unequal. An equal Hour is the 24th part of a mean natural Day,\r\nas shewn by well regulated Clocks and Watches; but those Hours are not\r\nquite equal as measured by the returns of the Sun to the Meridian,\r\nbecause of the obliquity of the Ecliptic and Sun’s unequal motion in it\r\n§ 224-245. Unequal Hours are those by which the Artificial Day is\r\ndivided into twelve Parts, and the Night into as many.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minutes, Seconds, Thirds, and Scruples.]\r\n\r\n419. An Hour is divided into 60 equal parts called _Minutes_, a minute\r\ninto 60 equal parts called Seconds, and these again into 60 equal parts\r\ncalled _Thirds_. The _Jews_, _Chaldeans_, and _Arabians_, divide the\r\nHour into 1080 equal parts called _Scruples_; which number contains 18\r\ntimes 60, so that one minute contains 18 Scruples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cycles, of the Sun, Moon, and Indiction.]\r\n\r\n420. A _Cycle_ is a perpetual round, or circulation of the same parts of\r\ntime of any sort. The _Cycle of the Sun_ is a revolution of 28 years, in\r\nwhich time, the days of the months return again to the same days of the\r\nweek; the Sun’s Place to the same Signs and Degrees of the Ecliptic on\r\nthe same months and days, so as not to differ one degree in 100 years;\r\nand the leap-years begin the same course over again with respect to the\r\ndays of the week on which the days of the months fall. The _Cycle of the\r\nMoon_, commonly called the _Golden Number_, is a revolution of 19 years;\r\nin which time, the Conjunctions, Oppositions, and other Aspects of the\r\nMoon are within an hour and half of being the same as they were on the\r\nsame days of the months 19 years before. The _Indiction_ is a revolution\r\nof 15 years, used only by the _Romans_ for indicating the times of\r\ncertain payments made by the subjects to the republic: It was\r\nestablished by _Constantine_, A.D. 312.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To find the Years of these Cycles.]\r\n\r\n421. The year of our SAVIOUR’s Birth, according to the vulgar _Æra_, was\r\nthe 9th year of the Solar Cycle; the first year of the Lunar Cycle; and\r\nthe 312th year after his birth was the first year of the _Roman_\r\nIndiction. Therefore, to find the year of the Solar Cycle, add 9 to any\r\ngiven year of CHRIST, and divide the sum by 28, the Quotient is the\r\nnumber of Cycles elapsed since his birth, and the remainder is the Cycle\r\nfor the given year: if nothing remains, the Cycle is 28. To find the\r\nLunar Cycle, add 1 to the given year of CHRIST, and divide the sum by\r\n19; the Quotient is the number of Cycles elapsed in the interval, and\r\nthe remainder is the Cycle for the given year: if nothing remains, the\r\nCycle is 19. Lastly, subtract 312 from the given year of CHRIST, and\r\ndivide the remainder by 15; and what remains after this division is the\r\nIndiction for the given year: if nothing remains, the Indiction is 15.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The deficiency of the Lunar Cycle, and consequence thereof.]\r\n\r\n422. Although the above deficiency in the Lunar Cycle of an hour and\r\nhalf every 19 years be but small, yet in time it becomes so sensible as\r\nto make a whole Natural Day in 310 years. So that, although this Cycle\r\nbe of use, when rightly placed against the days of the month in the\r\nCalendar, as in our _Common Prayer Books_, for finding the days of the\r\nmean Conjunctions or Oppositions of the Sun and Moon, and consequently\r\nthe time of _Easter_; it will only serve for 310 years _Old Style_. For\r\nas the New and Full Moons anticipate a day in that time, the Golden\r\nNumbers ought to be placed one day earlier in the Calendar for the next\r\n310 years to come. These Numbers were rightly placed against the days of\r\nNew Moon in the Calendar, by the Council of _Nice_, A. D. 325; but the\r\nanticipation which has been neglected ever since, is now grown almost\r\ninto 5 days: and therefore, all the Golden Numbers ought now to be\r\nplaced 5 days higher in the Calendar for the _O.S._ than they were at\r\nthe time of the said Council; or six days lower for the _New Style_,\r\nbecause at present it differs 11 days from the _Old_.\r\n\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n |Days||Jan.|Feb.|Mar.|Apr.|May |Jun.|Jul.|Aug.|Sep.|Oct.|Nov.|Dec.|\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n |  1 ||  9 |    |  9 | 17 | 17 |  6 |    |    |    | 11 |    | 19 |\r\n |  2 ||    | 17 |    |    |  6 | 14 | 14 |  3 | 11 |    | 19 |    |\r\n |  3 || 17 |  6 | 17 |  6 |    |    |  3 | 11 |    | 19 |  8 |  8 |\r\n |  4 ||  6 |    |  6 | 14 | 14 |  3 |    |    | 19 |  8 |    | 16 |\r\n |  5 ||    | 14 |    |    |  3 | 11 | 11 | 19 |  8 |    | 16 |    |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n |  6 || 14 |  3 | 14 |  3 |    |    | 19 |    |    | 16 |  5 |  5 |\r\n |  7 ||  3 |    |  3 | 11 | 11 | 19 |    |  8 | 16 |    |    | 13 |\r\n |  8 ||    | 11 |    |    | 19 |  8 |  8 | 16 |  5 |  5 | 13 |    |\r\n |  9 || 11 | 19 | 11 | 19 |    |    |    |    |    | 13 |    |  2 |\r\n | 10 ||    |    | 19 |  8 |  8 | 16 | 16 |  5 | 13 |    |  2 | 10 |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | 11 || 19 |  8 |    |    |    |    |  5 | 13 |  2 |  2 | 10 |    |\r\n | 12 ||  8 | 16 |  8 | 16 | 16 |  5 |    |    |    | 10 |    | 18 |\r\n | 13 ||    |    |    |    |  5 | 13 | 13 |  2 | 10 |    | 18 |  7 |\r\n | 14 || 16 |  5 | 16 |  5 |    |    |  2 | 10 | 18 | 18 |  7 |    |\r\n | 15 ||  5 |    |  5 | 13 | 13 |  2 |    |    |    |  7 |    | 15 |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | 16 ||    | 13 |    |    |  2 | 10 | 10 | 18 |  7 |    | 15 |    |\r\n | 17 || 13 |  2 | 13 |  2 |    |    | 18 |  7 |    | 15 |  4 |  4 |\r\n | 18 ||  2 |    |  2 | 10 | 10 | 18 |    |    | 15 |    |    | 12 |\r\n | 19 ||    | 10 |    |    | 18 |  7 |  7 | 15 |  4 |  4 | 12 |    |\r\n | 20 || 10 | 18 | 10 | 18 |    |    | 15 |    |    | 12 |  1 |  1 |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | 21 ||    |    | 18 |  7 |  7 | 15 |    |  4 | 12 |    |    |  9 |\r\n | 22 || 18 |  7 |    |    | 15 |  4 |  4 | 12 |  1 |  1 |  9 |    |\r\n | 23 ||  7 | 15 |  7 | 15 |    |    | 12 |    |    |  9 | 17 | 17 |\r\n | 24 ||    |    | 15 |  4 |  4 | 12 |    |  1 |  9 |    |    |  6 |\r\n | 25 || 15 |  4 |    |    | 12 |    |  1 |  9 | 17 | 17 |  6 |    |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | 26 ||  4 |    |  4 | 12 |    |  1 |    |    |    |  6 |    | 14 |\r\n | 27 ||    | 12 |    |  1 |  1 |  9 |  9 | 17 |  6 |    | 14 |    |\r\n | 28 || 12 |  1 | 12 |    |  9 |    | 17 |  6 | 14 | 14 |  3 |  3 |\r\n | 29 ||  1 |    |  1 |  9 |    | 17 |    |    |    |  3 |    | 11 |\r\n | 30 ||    |    |    |    | 17 |  6 |  6 | 14 |  3 |    | 11 |    |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | 31 ||  9 |    |  9 |    |    |    | 14 |  3 |    | 11 |    | 19 |\r\n +----++----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to find the day of the New Moon by the Golden Number.]\r\n\r\n423. In the annexed Table, the Golden Numbers under the months stand\r\nagainst the days of New Moon in the left hand column, for the _New\r\nStyle_; adapted chiefly to the second year after leap-year as being the\r\nnearest mean for all the four; and will serve till the year 1900.\r\nTherefore, to find the day of New Moon in any month of a given year till\r\nthat time, look for the Golden Number of that year under the desired\r\nmonth, and against it, you have the day of New Moon in the left hand\r\ncolumn. Thus, suppose it were required to find the day of New Moon in\r\n_September_ 1757; the Golden Number for that year is 10, which I look\r\nfor under _September_ and right against it in the left hand column I\r\nfind 13, which is the day of New Moon in that month. _N. B._ If all the\r\nGolden Numbers, except 17 and 6, were set one day lower in the Table, it\r\nwould serve from the beginning of the year 1900 till the end of the year\r\n2199. The first Table after this chapter shews the Golden Number for\r\n4000 years after the birth of CHRIST, by looking for the even hundreds\r\nof any given year at the left hand, and for the rest to make up that\r\nyear at the head of the Table; and where the columns meet, you have the\r\nGolden Number (which is the same both in _Old_ and _New Style_) for the\r\ngiven year. Thus, suppose the Golden Number was wanted for the year\r\n1757; I look for 1700 at the left hand of the Table, and for 57 at the\r\ntop of it; then guiding my eye downward from 57 to over against 1700, I\r\nfind 10, which is the Golden Number for that year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A perpetual Table of the time of New Moon to the nearest\r\n           hour, for the _Old Style_.]\r\n\r\n424. But because the lunar Cycle of 19 years sometimes includes five\r\nleap-years, and at other times only four, this Table will sometimes vary\r\na day from the truth in leap-years after _February_. And it is\r\nimpossible to have one more correct, unless we extend it to four times\r\n19 or 76 years; in which there are 19 leap years without a remainder.\r\nBut even then to have it of perpetual use, it must be adapted to the\r\n_Old Style_, because in every centurial year not divisible by 4, the\r\nregular course of leap-years is interrupted in the _New_; as will be the\r\ncase in the year 1800. Therefore, upon the regular _Old Style_ plan, I\r\nhave computed the following Table of the mean times of all the New Moons\r\nto the nearest hour for 76 years; beginning with the year of CHRIST\r\n1724, and ending with the year 1800.\r\n\r\nThis Table may be made perpetual, by deducting 6 hours from the time of\r\nNew Moon in any given year and month from 1724 to 1800, in order to have\r\nthe mean time of New Moon in any year and month 76 years afterward; or\r\ndeducting 12 hours for 152 years, 18 hours for 228 years; and 24 hours\r\nfor 304 years, because in that time the changes of the Moon anticipate\r\nalmost a complete natural day. And if the like number of hours be added\r\nfor so many years past, we shall have the mean time of any New Moon\r\nalready elapsed. Suppose, for example, the mean time of Change was\r\nrequired for _January_ 1802; deduct 76 years and there remains 1726,\r\nagainst which in the following Table under _January_ I find the time of\r\nNew Moon was on the 21st day at 11 in the evening: from which take 6\r\nhours and there remains the 21st day at 5 in the evening for the mean\r\ntime of Change in _January_ 1802. Or, if the time be required for _May_,\r\nA. D. 1701, add 76 years and it makes 1777, which I look for in the\r\nTable, and against it under _May_ I find the New Moon in that year falls\r\non the 25th day at 9 in the evening; to which add 6 hours, and it gives\r\nthe 26th day at 3 in the Morning for the time of New Moon in _May_, A.\r\nD. 1701. By this addition for time past, or subtraction for time to\r\ncome, the Table will not vary 24 hours from the truth in less than 14592\r\nyears. And if, instead of 6 hours for every 76 years, we add or subtract\r\nonly 5 hours 52 minutes, it will not vary a day in 10 millions of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this Table is calculated for 76 years only, and according to\r\nthe _Old Style_, yet by means of two easy Equations it may be made to\r\nanswer as exactly to the _New Style_, for any time to come. Thus,\r\nbecause the year 1724 in this Table is the first year of the Cycle for\r\nwhich it is made; if from any year of CHRIST after 1800 you subtract\r\n1723, and divide the overplus by 76, the Quotient will shew how many\r\nentire Cycles of 76 years are elapsed since the beginning of the Cycle\r\nhere provided for; and the remainder will shew the year of the current\r\nCycle answering to the given year of CHRIST. Hence, if the remainder be\r\n0, you must instead thereof put 76, and lessen the Quotient by unity.\r\n\r\nThen, look in the left hand column of the Table for the number in your\r\nremainder, and against it you will find the times of all the mean New\r\nMoons in that year of the present Cycle. And whereas in 76 _Julian_\r\nYears the Moon anticipates 5 hours 52 minutes, if therefore these 5\r\nhours 52 minutes be multiplied by the above found Quotient, that is, by\r\nthe number of entire Cycles past; the product subtracted from the times\r\nin the Table will leave the corrected times of the New Moons to the _Old\r\nStyle_; which may be reduced to the _New Style_ thus:\r\n\r\nDivide the number of entire hundreds in the given year of CHRIST by 4,\r\nmultiply this Quotient by 3, to the product add the remainder, and from\r\ntheir sum subtract 2: this last remainder denotes the number of days to\r\nbe added to the times above corrected, in order to reduce them to the\r\n_New Style_. The reason of this is, that every 400 years of the _New\r\nStyle_ gains 3 days upon the _Old Style_: one of which it gains in each\r\nof the centurial years succeeding that which is exactly divisible by 4\r\nwithout remainder; but then, when you have found the days so gained, 2\r\nmust be subtracted from their number on account of the rectifications\r\nmade in the Calendar by the Council of _Nice_, and since by Pope\r\n_Gregory_. It must also be observed, that the additional days found as\r\nabove directed do not take place in the centurial Years which are not\r\nmultiples of 4 till _February_ 29th, _O. S._ for on that day begins the\r\ndifference between the _Styles_; till which day therefore, those that\r\nwere added in the preceding years must be used. The following Example\r\nwill make this accommodation plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Required the mean time of New Moon in_ June, A.D. 1909, _N.S._\r\n\r\n From 1909 take 1723 Years, and there rem.          186\r\n Which divided by 76, gives the Quotient 2\r\n   and the remainder                                 34\r\n Then, against 34 in the Table is _June_            5^d  8^h  0^m Afternoon.\r\n And 5^h 52^m multiplied by 2 make to be subtr.      11  44\r\n                                                 -------------\r\n Remains the mean time according to the _Old\r\n   Style_, _June_                                5^d  9^h 16^m Morning.\r\n Entire hundred in 1909 are 19, which divided\r\n   by 4, quotes                                            4\r\n And leaves a remainder of                                 3\r\n Which Quotient multiplied by 3 makes 12,\r\n   and the remainder added makes                          15\r\n From which subtract 2, and there remains                 13\r\n Which number of days added to the above\r\n   time _Old Style_, gives _June_               18^d  9^h 16^m Morn._N.S._\r\n\r\nSo the mean time of New Moon in _June_ 1909 _New Style_ is the 18th day\r\nat 16 minutes past 9 in the Morning.\r\n\r\nIf 11 days be added to the time of any New Moon in this Table, it will\r\ngive the time thereof according to the _New Style_ till the year 1800.\r\nAnd if 14 days 18 hours 22 minutes be added to the mean time of New Moon\r\nin either _Style_, it will give the mean time of the next Full Moon\r\naccording to that _Style_.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |_A_ TABLE _shewing the times of all the mean Changes of the Moon, to the nearest Hour,       |\r\n |through four Lunar Periods, or 76 years._ M _signifies morning_, A _afternoon_.              |\r\n +----+----+-------+------+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+-----+\r\n |Yrs |    |January|      |March|      | May  |      | July |      |Sept. |      |Novemb.|     |\r\n |of  |A.D.|     |February|     |April |      | June |      |August|     |October|     |Decemb.|\r\n |the +----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n |Cyc.|    |D.

deficient.]\r\n\r\n425. The _Cycle of Easter_, also called the _Dionysian Period_, is a\r\nrevolution of 532 years, found by multiplying the Solar Cycle 28 by the\r\nLunar Cycle 19. If the New Moons did not anticipate upon this Cycle,\r\n_Easter-Day_ would always be the _Sunday_ next after the first Full Moon\r\nwhich succeeds the 21st of _March_. But, on account of the above\r\nanticipation § 422, to which no proper regard was had before the late\r\nalteration of the _Style_, the _Ecclesiastic Easter_ has several times\r\nbeen a week different from the _true Easter_ within this last Century:\r\nwhich inconvenience is now remedied by making the Table which used to\r\nfind Easter _for ever_, in the Common Prayer Book, of no longer use than\r\nthe Lunar difference from the _New Style_ will admit of.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Number of Direction.\r\n\r\n           To find the true _Easter_.]\r\n\r\n426. The _earliest Easter possible_ is the 22d of _March_, the _latest_\r\nthe 25th of _April_. Within these limits are 35 days, and the number\r\nbelonging to each of them is called the _Number of Direction_; because\r\nthereby the time of Easter is found for any given year. To find the\r\nNumber of Direction, according to the _New Style_, enter Table V\r\nfollowing this Chapter, with the compleat hundreds of any given year at\r\nthe top, and the years thereof (if any) below an hundred at the left\r\nhand; and where the columns meet is the Dominical Letter for the given\r\nyear. Then, enter Table I, with the compleat hundreds of the same year\r\nat the left hand, and the years below an hundred at the top; and where\r\nthe columns meet is the Golden Number for the same year. Lastly, enter\r\nTable II with the Dominical Letter at the left hand and Golden Number at\r\nthe top; and where the columns meet is the Number of Direction for that\r\nyear; which number, added to the 21st day of _March_ shews on what day\r\neither of _March_ or _April_ Easter _Sunday_ falls in that year. Thus,\r\nthe Dominical Letter _New Style_ for the year 1757 is _B_ (Table V) and\r\nthe Golden Number is 10, (Table I) by which in Table II, the Number of\r\nDirection is found to be 20; which, reckoned from the 21st of _March_,\r\nends on the 10th of _April_, and _that_ is _Easter Sunday_ in the year\r\n1757. _N. B._ There are always two Dominical Letters to the leap-year,\r\nthe first of which takes place to the 24th of _February_, the last for\r\nthe following part of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dominical Letter.]\r\n\r\n427. _The first seven Letters of the Alphabet_ are commonly placed in\r\nthe annual Almanacks to shew on what days of the week the days of the\r\nmonths fall throughout the year. And because one of those seven Letters\r\nmust necessarily stand against _Sunday_ it is printed in a capital form,\r\nand called the _Dominical Letter_: the other six being inserted in small\r\ncharacters to denote the other six days of the week. Now, since a common\r\n_Julian Year_ contains 365 Days, if this number be divided by 7 (the\r\nnumber of days in a week) there will remain one day. If there had been\r\nno remainder, ’tis plain the year would constantly begin on the same day\r\nof the week. But since one remains, ’tis as plain that the year must\r\nbegin and end on the same day of the week; and therefore the next year\r\nwill begin on the day following. Hence, when _January_ begins on\r\n_Sunday_, _A_ is the Dominical or _Sunday_ Letter for that year: then,\r\nbecause the next year begins on _Monday_, the _Sunday_ will fall on the\r\nseventh day, to which is annexed the seventh Letter _G_, which therefore\r\nwill be the Dominical Letter for all that year: and as the third year\r\nwill begin on _Tuesday_, the _Sunday_ will fall on the sixth day;\r\ntherefore _F_ will be the _Sunday_ Letter for that year. Whence ’tis\r\nevident that the _Sunday_ Letters will go annually in a retrograde order\r\nthus, _G_, _F_, _E_, _D_, _C_, _B_, _A_. And in the course of seven\r\nyears, if they were all common ones, the same days of the week and\r\nDominical Letters would return to the same days of the months. But\r\nbecause there are 366 days in a leap-year, if this number be divided by\r\n7, there will remain two days over and above the 52 weeks of which the\r\nyear consists. And therefore, if the leap-year begins on _Sunday_, it\r\nwill end on _Monday_; and the next year will begin on _Tuesday_, the\r\nfirst _Sunday_ whereof must fall on the sixth of _January_, to which is\r\nannexed the Letter _F_, and not _G_ as in common years. By this means,\r\nthe leap-year returning every fourth year, the order of the Dominical\r\nLetters is interrupted; and the Series does not return to its first\r\nstate till after four times seven, or 28 years: and then the same days\r\nof the month return in order to the same days of the week.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To find the Dominical Letter.]\r\n\r\n428. _To find the Dominical Letter for any year either before or after\r\nthe Christian Æra_[87]: In Table III or IV for _Old Style_, or V for\r\n_New Style_, look for the hundreds of years at the head of the Table,\r\nand for the years below an hundred (to make up the given year) at the\r\nleft hand: and where the columns meet you have the Dominical Letter for\r\nthe year desired. Thus, suppose the Dominical Letter be required for the\r\nyear of CHRIST 1758, _New Style_, I look for 1700 at the head of Table\r\nV, and for 58 at the left hand of the same Table; and in the angle of\r\nmeeting, I find _A_, which is the Dominical Letter for that year. If it\r\nwas wanted for the same year _Old Style_, it would be found by Table IV\r\nto be _D_. But _to find the Dominical Letter for any given year before_\r\nCHRIST, subtract one from _that_ year and then proceed in all respects\r\nas just now taught, to find it by Table III Thus, suppose the Dominical\r\nLetter be required for the 585th year before the first year of CHRIST,\r\nlook for 500 at the head of Table III, and for 84 at the left hand; in\r\nthe meeting of these columns is _FE_, which were the Dominical Letters\r\nfor that year, and shews that it was a leap-year; because, leap-year has\r\nalways two Dominical Letters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To find the Days of the Months.]\r\n\r\n429. _To find the day of the month answering to any day of the week, or\r\nthe day of the week answering to any day of the month; for any year past\r\nor to come:_ Having found the Dominical Letter for the given year, enter\r\nTable VI, with the Dominical Letter at the head; and under it, all the\r\ndays in that column to the right hand are _Sundays_, in the divisions of\r\nthe months; the next column to the right are _Mondays_; the next,\r\n_Tuesdays_; and so on to the last column under _G_, from which go back\r\nto the column under _A_, and thence proceed towards the right hand as\r\nbefore. Thus, in the year 1757, the Dominical Letter _New Style_ is _B_,\r\nin Table V, then in Table VI all the days under _B_ are _Sundays_ in\r\nthat year, _viz._ the 2d, 9th, 16th, 23d, and 30th of _January_ and\r\n_October_; the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th of _February_, _March_ and\r\n_November_; the 3d, 10th, and 17th, of _April_ and _July_, together with\r\nthe 31st of _July_: and so on to the foot of the column. Then, of\r\ncourse, all the days under _C_ on _Mondays_, namely the 3d, 10th, _&c._\r\nof _January_ and _October_; and so of all the rest in that column. If\r\n_the day of the week answering to any day of the month_ be required, it\r\nis easily had from the same Table by the Letter that stands at the top\r\nof the column in which the given day of the month is found. Thus, the\r\nLetter that stands over the 28th of _May_ is _A_; and in the year 585\r\nbefore CHRIST the Dominical Letter was found to be _FE_ § 428; which\r\nbeing a leap-year, and _E_ taking place from the 24th of _February_ to\r\nthe end of that year, shews by the Table that the 25th of _May_ was on a\r\n_Sunday_; and therefore the 28th must have been on a _Wednesday_: for\r\nwhen _E_ stands for _Sunday_, _F_ must stand for _Monday_, _G_ for\r\n_Tuesday_, _A_ for _Wednesday_, _B_ for _Thursday_, _C_ for _Friday_,\r\nand _D_ for _Saturday_. Hence, as it appears that the famous Eclipse of\r\nthe Sun foretold by THALES, by which a peace was brought about between\r\nthe _Medes_ and _Lydians_, happened on the 28th of _May_, in the 585th\r\nyear before CHRIST, it certainly fell on a _Wednesday_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Julian Period._]\r\n\r\n430. From the multiplication of the Solar Cycle of 28 years into the\r\nLunar Cycle of 19 years, arises the great _Julian Period_ consisting of\r\n7980 years; which had its beginning 764 years before the supposed year\r\nof the creation (when all the three Cycles began together) and is not\r\nyet compleated, and therefore it comprehends all other Cycles, Periods\r\nand Æras. There is but one year in the whole Period which has the same\r\nnumbers for the three Cycles of which it is made up: and therefore, if\r\nhistorians had remarked in their writings the Cycles of each year, there\r\nhad been no dispute about the time of any action recorded by them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To find the year of this Period.\r\n\r\n           And the Cycles of that year.]\r\n\r\n431. The _Dionysian_ or vulgar Æra of _Christ_’s birth was about the end\r\nof the year of the _Julian_ Period 4713; and consequently the first year\r\nof his age, according to that account, was the 4714th year of the said\r\nPeriod. Therefore, if to the current year of _Christ_ we add 4713, the\r\nSum will be the year of the _Julian_ Period. So the year 1757 will be\r\nfound to be the 6470th year of that Period. Or, to find the year of the\r\n_Julian_ Period answering to any given year before the first year of\r\nCHRIST, subtract the number of that given year from 4714, and the\r\nremainder will be the year of the _Julian_ Period. Thus, the year 585\r\nbefore the first year of CHRIST (which was the 584th before his birth)\r\nwas the 4129th year of the said Period. Lastly, to find the Cycles of\r\nthe Sun, Moon, and Indiction for any given year of this Period, divide\r\nthe given year by 28, 19, and 15; the three remainders will be the\r\nCycles sought, and the Quotients the numbers of Cycles run since the\r\nbeginning of the Period. So in the above 4714th year of the _Julian_\r\nPeriod the Cycle of the Sun was 10, the Cycle of the Moon 2, and the\r\nCycle of Indiction 4; the Solar Cycle having run through 168 courses,\r\nthe Lunar 248, and the Indiction 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The true Æra of CHRIST’s birth.]\r\n\r\n432. The vulgar Æra of CHRIST’s birth was never settled till the year\r\n527; when _Dionysius Exiguus_, a _Roman_ Abbot, fixed it to the end of\r\nthe 4713th year of the _Julian_ Period; which was certainly four years\r\ntoo late. For, our SAVIOUR was undoubtedly born before the Death of\r\n_Herod_ the Great, who sought to kill him as soon as he heard of his\r\nbirth. And, according to the testimony of _Josephus_ (B. xvii. c. 8.)\r\nthere was an eclipse of the Moon in the time of _Herod_’s last illness:\r\nwhich very eclipse our Astronomical Tables shew to have been in the year\r\nof the _Julian_ Period 4710, _March_ 13th, 3 hours 21 minutes after\r\nmid-night, at _Jerusalem_. Now, as our SAVIOUR must have been born some\r\nmonths before _Herod_’s death, since in the interval he was carried into\r\n_Ægypt_; the latest time in which we can possibly fix the true _Æra_ of\r\nhis birth is about the end of the 4709th year of the _Julian_ Period.\r\nAnd this is four years before the vulgar _Æra_ thereof.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The time of his crucifixion.]\r\n\r\nIn the former edition of this book, I endeavoured to ascertain the time\r\nof CHRIST’s death; by shewing in what year, about the reputed time of\r\nthe Passion, there was a Passover Full Moon on a _Friday_: on which day\r\nof the week, and at the time of the Passover, it is evident from _Mark_\r\nxv. 42. that our SAVIOUR was crucified. And in computing the times of\r\nall the Passover Full Moons from the 20th to the 40th year of CHRIST,\r\nafter the _Jewish_ manner, which was to add 14 days to the time when the\r\nNew Moon next before the Passover was first visible at _Jerusalem_, in\r\norder to have their day of the Passover Full Moon, I found that the only\r\nPassover Full Moon which fell on a _Friday_, in all that time, was in\r\nthe year of the _Julian_ Period 4746, on the third day of _April_: which\r\nyear was the 33d year of CHRIST’s age, reckoning from the vulgar Æra of\r\nhis birth, but the 37th counting from the true _Æra_ thereof: and was\r\nalso the last year of the 402d Olympiad[88], in which very year\r\n_Phlegon_ an Heathen writer tells us, _there was the most extraordinary\r\nEclipse of the Sun that ever was known_, and that _it was night at the\r\nsixth hour of the day_. Which agrees exactly with the time that the\r\ndarkness at the crucifixion began, according to the three Evangelists\r\nwho mention it[89]: and therefore must have been the very same darkness,\r\nbut mistaken by _Phlegon_ for a natural Eclipse of the Sun; which was\r\nimpossible on two accounts, 1. because it was at the time of Full Moon;\r\nand 2. because whoever takes the pains to calculate, will find that\r\nthere could be no regular and total Eclipse of the Sun that year in any\r\npart of _Judea_, nor any where between _Jerusalem_ and _Egypt_: so that\r\nthis darkness must have been quite out of the common course of nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the co-incidence of these characters, I made no doubt of having\r\nascertained the true year and day of our SAVIOUR’s death. But having\r\nvery lately read what some eminent authors have wrote on the same\r\nsubject, of which I was really ignorant before; and heard the opinions\r\nof other candid and ingenious enquirers after truth (which every honest\r\nman will follow wherever it leads him) and who think they have strong\r\nreasons for believing that the time of CHRIST’s death was not in the\r\nyear of the _Julian_ Period 4746, but in the year 4743; I find\r\ndifficulties on both sides, not easily got over: and shall therefore\r\nstate the case both ways as fairly as I can; leaving the reader to take\r\nwhich side of the Question he pleases.\r\n\r\nBoth Dr. _Prideaux_ and Sir _Isaac Newton_ are of opinion that\r\n_Daniel_’s seventy weeks, consisting of 490 years (_Dan._ chap. ix. v.\r\n23-26) began with the time when Ezra received his commission from\r\n_Artaxerxes_ to go to _Jerusalem_, which was in the seventh year of that\r\nKing’s reign (_Ezra_ ch. vii. v. 11-26) and ended with the death of\r\nCHRIST. For, by joining the accomplishment of that prophecy with the\r\nexpiation of Sin, those weeks cannot well be supposed to end at any\r\nother time. And both these authors agree that this was _Artaxerxes\r\nLongimanus_, not _Artaxerxes Mnemon_. The Doctor thinks that the last of\r\nthose annual weeks was equally divided between _John_’s ministry and\r\nCHRIST’s. And, as to the half week, mentioned by _Daniel_ chap. ix. v.\r\n27. Sir _Isaac_ thinks it made no part of the above seventy; but only\r\nmeant the three years and an half in which the _Romans_ made war upon\r\nthe _Jews_ from spring in _A.D._ 67 to autumn in _A.D._ 70, when a final\r\nPeriod was put to their sacrifices and oblations by destroying their\r\ncity and sanctuary, on which they were utterly dispersed. Now, both by\r\nthe undoubted Canon of _Ptolemy_, and the famous Æra of _Nabonassar_,\r\nwhich is so well verified by Eclipses that it cannot deceive us, the\r\nbeginning of these seventy weeks, or the seventh year of the reign of\r\n_Artaxerxes Longimanus_, is pinned down to the year of the _Julian_\r\nPeriod 4256: from which count 490 years to the death of CHRIST, and the\r\nsame will fall in the above year of the _Julian_ Period 4746: which\r\nwould seem to ascertain the true year beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nBut as _Josephus_’s Eclipse of the Moon in a great measure fixes our\r\nSAVIOUR’s birth to the end of the 4713th year of the _Julian_ Period,\r\nand a _Friday_ Passover Full Moon fixes the time of his death to the\r\nthird of _April_ in the 4746th year of that Period, the same as above by\r\n_Daniel_’s weeks, this supposes our SAVIOUR to have been crucified in\r\nthe 37th year of his age. And as St. _Luke_ chap. iii. ver. 23. fixes\r\nthe time of CHRIST’s baptism to the beginning of his 30th year, it would\r\nhence seem that his publick ministry, to which his baptism was the\r\ninitiation, lasted seven years. But, as it would be very difficult to\r\nfind account in all the Evangelists of more than four Passovers which he\r\nkept at _Jerusalem_ during the time of his ministry, others think that\r\nhe suffered in the vulgar 30th year of his age, which was really the\r\n33d; namely in the year of the _Julian_ Period 4743. And this opinion is\r\nfarther strengthened by considering that our SAVIOUR eat his last\r\nPaschal Supper on a _Thursday_ evening, the day immediately before his\r\ncrucifixion: and that as he subjected himself to the law, he would not\r\nbreak the law by keeping the Passover on the day before the law\r\nprescribed; neither would the Priests have suffered the Lamb to be\r\nkilled for him before the fourteenth day of _Nisan_ when it was killed\r\nfor all the people, _Exod._ xii. _ver._ 6. And hence they infer that he\r\nkept this Passover at the same time with the rest of the _Jews_, in the\r\nvulgar 30th year of his age: at which time it is evident by calculation\r\nthat there was a Passover Full Moon on _Thursday April_ the 6th. But\r\nthis is pressed with two difficulties. 1. It drops the last half of\r\n_Daniel_’s seventieth week, as of no moment in the prophecy; and 2. it\r\nsets aside the testimony of _Phlegon_, as if he had mistaken almost a\r\nwhole _Olympiad_.\r\n\r\nOthers again endeavour to reconcile the whole difference, by supposing,\r\nthat as CHRIST expressed himself only in round numbers concerning the\r\ntime he was to lie in the grave, _Matt._ xii. 40. so might St. _Luke_\r\npossibly have done with regard to the year of his baptism: which would\r\nreally seem to be the case when we consider, that the _Jews_ told our\r\nSAVIOUR, sometime before his death, _Thou art not yet fifty years old_,\r\nJohn vii. 57. which indeed was more likely to be said to a person near\r\nforty than to one but just turned of thirty. And as to his eating the\r\nabove Passover on _Thursday_, which must have been on the _Jewish_ Full\r\nMoon day, they think it may be easily accommodated to the 37th year of\r\nhis age; since, as the _Jews_ always began their day in the evening,\r\ntheir _Friday_ of course began on the evening of our _Thursday_. And it\r\nis evident, as above-mentioned, that the only _Jewish Friday_ Full Moon,\r\nat the time of their Passover, was in the vulgar 33d, but the real 37th\r\nyear of CHRIST’s age; which was the 4746th year of the _Julian_ Period,\r\nand the last year of the 202d _Olympiad_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Æras or Epochas.]\r\n\r\n433. As there are certain fixed points in the Heavens from which\r\nAstronomers begin their computations, so there are certain points of\r\ntime from which historians begin to reckon; and these points or roots of\r\ntime are called _Æras_ or _Epochas_. The most remarkable _Æras_ are\r\nthose of the _Creation_, the _Greek Olympiads_, the building of _Rome_,\r\nthe _Æra_ of _Nabonassar_, the death of _Alexander_, the birth of\r\nCHRIST, the _Arabian Hegira_, and the _Persian Jesdegird_: All which,\r\ntogether with several others of less note, have their beginnings in the\r\nfollowing Table fixed to the years of the _Julian Period_, to the age of\r\nthe world at those times, and to the years before and after the birth of\r\nCHRIST.\r\n\r\n                                                         |Julian Period.|\r\n                                                         +              +\r\n                                                         |    |Y. of the World.|\r\n                                                         |    +    +           +\r\n                                                         |    |    |Before Christ.\r\n                                                         |      |      |\r\n 1.

The ORRERY. This Machine shews the Motions of the Sun, Mercury,\r\nVenus, Earth, and Moon; and occasionally, the superior Planets, Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn may be put on; Jupiter’s four Satellites are moved\r\nround him in their proper times by a small Winch; and Saturn has his\r\nfive Satellites, and his Ring which keeps its parallelism round the Sun;\r\nand by a Lamp put in the Sun’s place, the Ring shews all the Phases\r\ndescribed in the 204th Article.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sun.\r\n\r\n           The Ecliptic.]\r\n\r\nIn the Center, No 1. represents the SUN, supported by it’s Axis\r\ninclining almost 8 Degrees from the Axis of the Ecliptic; and turning\r\nround in 25-1/4 days on its Axis, of which the North Pole inclines\r\ntoward the 8th Degree of Pisces in the great Ecliptic (No. 11.) whereon\r\nthe Months and Days are engraven over the Signs and Degrees in which the\r\nSun appears, as seen from the Earth, on the different days of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mercury.]\r\n\r\nThe nearest Planet (No. 2) to the Sun is _Mercury_, which goes round him\r\nin 87 days 23 hours, or 87-23/24 diurnal rotations of the Earth; but has\r\nno Motion round its Axis in the Machine, because the time of its diurnal\r\nMotion in the Heavens is not known to us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Venus.]\r\n\r\nThe next Planet in order is _Venus_ (No. 3) which performs her annual\r\nCourse in 224 days 17 hours; and turns round her Axis in 24 days 8\r\nhours, or in 24-1/3 diurnal rotations of the Earth. Her Axis inclines 75\r\nDegrees from the Axis of the Ecliptic, and her North Pole inclines\r\ntowards the 20th Degree of Aquarius, according to the observations of\r\n_Bianchini_. She shews all the Phenomena described from the 30th to the\r\n44th Article in Chap. I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth.]\r\n\r\nNext without the Orbit of Venus is the _Earth_ (No. 4) which turns round\r\nits Axis, to any fixed point at a great distance, in 23 hours 56 minutes\r\n4 seconds of mean solar time (221 & _seq._) but from the Sun to the Sun\r\nagain in 24 hours of the same time. No. 6 is a sidereal Dial-Plate under\r\nthe Earth; and No. 7 a solar Dial-Plate on the cover of the Machine. The\r\nIndex of the former shews sidereal, and of the latter, solar time; and\r\nhence, the former Index gains one entire revolution on the latter every\r\nyear, as 365 solar or natural days contain 366 sidereal days, or\r\napparent revolutions of the Stars. In the time that the Earth makes\r\n365-1/4 diurnal rotations on its Axis, it goes once round the Sun in the\r\nPlane of the Ecliptic; and always keeps opposite to a moving Index (No.\r\n10) which shews the Sun’s daily change of place, and also the days of\r\nthe months.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is half covered with a black cap for dividing the apparently\r\nenlightened half next the Sun, from the other half, which when turned\r\naway from him is in the dark. The edge of the cap represents _the Circle\r\nbounding Light and Darkness_, and shews at what time the Sun rises and\r\nsets to all places throughout the year. The Earth’s Axis inclines 23-1/2\r\nDegrees from the Axis of the Ecliptic, the North Pole inclines toward\r\nthe beginning of Cancer; and keeps its parallelism throughout its annual\r\nCourse § 48, 202; so that in Summer the northern parts of the Earth\r\nincline towards the Sun, and in the Winter from him: by which means, the\r\ndifferent lengths of days and nights, and the cause of the various\r\nseasons, are demonstrated to sight.\r\n\r\nThere is a broad Horizon, to the upper side of which is fixed a Meridian\r\nSemi-circle in the North and South Points, graduated on both sides from\r\nthe Horizon to 90° in the Zenith, or vertical Point. The edge of the\r\nHorizon is graduated from the East and West to the South and North\r\nPoints, and within these Divisions are the Points of the Compass. On the\r\nlower side of this thin Horizon Plate stand out four small Wires, to\r\nwhich is fixed a Twilight Circle 18 Degrees from the graduated side of\r\nthe Horizon all round. This Horizon may be put upon the Earth (when the\r\ncap is taken away) and rectified to the Latitude of any place: and then,\r\nby a small Wire called _the Solar Ray_, which may be put on so as to\r\nproceed directly from the Sun’s Center towards the Earth’s, but to come\r\nno farther than almost to touch the Horizon, the beginning of Twilight,\r\ntime of Sun-rising, with his Amplitude, Meridian Altitude, time of\r\nSetting, Amplitude, and end of Twilight, are shewn for every day of the\r\nyear, at _that_ place to which the Horizon is rectified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Moon.]\r\n\r\nThe Moon (No. 5) goes round the Earth, from between it and any fixed\r\npoint at a great distance, in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, or through all\r\nthe Signs and Degrees of her Orbit; which is called _her Periodical\r\nRevolution_; but she goes round from the Sun to the Sun again, or from\r\nChange to Change, in 29 days 12 hours 45 minutes, which is _her\r\nSynodical Revolution_; and in that time she exhibits all the Phases\r\nalready described § 255.\r\n\r\nWhen the above-mentioned Horizon is rectified to the Latitude of any\r\ngiven place, the times of the Moon’s rising and setting, together with\r\nher Amplitude, are shewn to that place as well as the Sun’s; and all the\r\nvarious Phenomena of the Harvest Moon § 273 & _seq._ made obvious to\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Nodes.]\r\n\r\nThe Moon’s Orbit (No. 9.) is inclined to the Ecliptic, (No. 11.) one\r\nhalf being above, and the other below it. The Nodes, or Points at 0 and\r\n0 lie in the Plane of the Ecliptic, as described § 317, 318, and shift\r\nbackward through all it’s Signs and Degrees in 18-2/3 years. The Degrees\r\nof the Moon’s Latitude, to the highest at _NL_ (North Latitude) and\r\nlowest at _SL_ (South Latitude) are engraven both ways from her Nodes at\r\n0 and 0; and, as the Moon rises and falls in her Orbit according to its\r\ninclination, her Latitude and Distance from her Nodes are shewn for\r\nevery day; having first rectified her Orbit so as to set the Nodes to\r\ntheir proper places in the Ecliptic: and then, as they come about at\r\ndifferent, and almost opposite times of the year § 319, and then point\r\ntowards the Sun, all the Eclipses may be shewn for hundreds of years\r\n(without any new rectification) by turning the Machinery backward for\r\ntime past, or forward for time to come. At 17 Degrees distance from each\r\nNode, on both Sides, is engraved a small Sun; and at 12 Degrees\r\ndistance, a small Moon; which shew the limits of solar and lunar\r\nEclipses § 317: and when, at any change, the Moon falls between either\r\nof these Suns and the Node, the Sun will be eclipsed on the day pointed\r\nto by the annual Index (No. 10,) and as the Moon has then North or South\r\nLatitude, one may easily judge whether that Eclipse will be visible in\r\nthe Northern or Southern Hemisphere; especially as the Earth’s Axis\r\ninclines towards the Sun or from him at that time. And when, at any\r\nFull, the Moon falls between either of the little Moon’s and Node, she\r\nwill be eclipsed, and the annual Index shews the day of that Eclipse.\r\nThere is a Circle of 29-1/2 equal parts (No. 8.) on the cover of the\r\nMachine, on which an Index shews the days of the Moon’s age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IX. Fig. X.]\r\n\r\nThere are two Semi-circles fixed to an elliptical Ring, which being put\r\nlike a cap upon the Earth, and the forked part _F_ upon the Moon, shews\r\nthe Tides as the Earth turns round within them, and they are led round\r\nit by the Moon. When the different Places come to the Semi-circle\r\n_AaEbB_, they have Tides of Flood; and when they come to the Semicircle\r\n_CED_ they have Tides of Ebb § 304, 305; the Index on the hour Circle\r\n(No. 7.) shewing the times of these Phenomena.\r\n\r\nThere is a jointed Wire, of which one end being put into a hole in the\r\nupright stem that holds the Earth’s cap, and the Wire laid into a small\r\nforked piece which may be occasionally put upon Venus or Mercury, shews\r\nthe direct and retrograde Motions of these two Planets, with their\r\nstationary Times and Places as seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe whole Machinery is turned by a winch or handle (No. 12,) and is so\r\neasily moved that a clock might turn it without any danger of stopping.\r\n\r\nTo give a Plate of the wheel-work of this Machine, would answer no\r\npurpose, because many of the wheels lie so behind others as to hide them\r\nfrom sight in any view whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another ORRERY.\r\n\r\n           PLATE VI. Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n435. _Another_ ORRERY. In this Machine, which is the simplest I ever\r\nsaw, for shewing the diurnal and annual motions of the Earth, together\r\nwith the motion of the Moon and her Nodes; _A_ and _B_ are two oblong\r\nsquare Plates held together by four upright pillars; of which three\r\nappear at _f_, _g_, and _g_2. Under the Plate _A_ is an endless screw on\r\nthe Axis of the handle _b_, which works in a wheel fixed on the same\r\nAxis with the double grooved wheel _E_; and on the top of this Axis is\r\nfixed the toothed wheel _i_, which turns the pinion _k_, on the top of\r\nwhose Axis is the pinion _k_2 which turns another pinion _b_2, and that\r\nother turns a third, on the Axis _a_2 of which is the Earth _U_ turning\r\nround; this last Axis inclining 23-1/2 Degrees. The supporter _X_2, in\r\nwhich the Axis of the Earth turns, is fixed to the moveable Plate _C_.\r\n\r\nIn the fixed Plate _B_, beyond _H_, is fixed the strong wire _d_, on\r\nwhich hangs the Sun _T_ so as it may turn round the wire. To this Sun is\r\nfixed the wire or solar ray _Z_, which (as the Earth _U_ turns round its\r\nAxis) points to all the places that the Sun passes vertically over,\r\nevery day of the year. The Earth is half covered with a black cap _a_,\r\nas in the former Orrery, for dividing the day from the night; and, as\r\nthe different places come out from below the edge of the cap, or go in\r\nbelow it, they shew the times of Sun-rising and setting every day of the\r\nyear. This cap is fixed on the wire _b_, which has a forked piece _C_\r\nturning round the wire _d_: and, as the Earth goes round the Sun, it\r\ncarries the Cap, Wire, and solar Ray round him; so that the solar Ray\r\nconstantly points towards the Earth’s Center.\r\n\r\nOn the Axis of the pinion _k_ is the pinion _m_, which turns a wheel on\r\nthe cock or supporter _n_, and on the Axis of this wheel nearest _n_ is\r\na pinion (hid from view) under the Plate _C_, which pinion turns a wheel\r\nthat carries the Moon _V_ round the Earth _U_; the Moon’s Axis rising\r\nand falling in the socket _W_, which is fixed to the triangular piece\r\nabove _Z_; and this piece is fixed to the top of the Axis of the last\r\nmentioned wheel. The socket _W_ is slit on the outermost side; and in\r\nthis slit the two pins near _Y_, fixed in the Moon’s Axis, move up and\r\ndown; one of them being above the inclined Plane _YX_, and the other\r\nbelow it. By this mechanism, the Moon _V_ moves round the Earth _T_ in\r\nthe inclined Orbit _q_, parallel to the Plane of the Ring _YX_; of which\r\nthe Descending Node is at _X_, and the Ascending Node opposite to it,\r\nbut hid by the supporter _X_2.\r\n\r\nThe small wheel _E_ turns the large wheels _D_ and _F_, of equal\r\ndiameters, by cat-gut strings crossing between them: and the Axis of\r\nthese two wheels are cranked at _G_ and _H_, above the Plate _B_. The\r\nupright stems of these cranks going through the Plate _C_, carry it over\r\nand over the fixed Plate _B_, with a motion which carries the Earth _U_\r\nround the Sun _T_, keeping the Earth’s Axis always parallel to itself;\r\nor still inclining towards the left-hand of the Plate; and shewing the\r\nvicissitudes of seasons, as described in the tenth chapter. As the Earth\r\ngoes round the Sun the pinion _k_ goes round the wheel _i_, for the Axis\r\nof _k_ never touches the fixed Plate _B_; but turns on a wire fixed into\r\nthe Plate _C_.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the crank _G_ is an Index _L_, which goes round the Circle\r\n_m_2 in the time that the Earth goes round the Sun; and points to the\r\ndays of the months; which, together with the names of the seasons, are\r\nmarked in this Circle.\r\n\r\nThis Index has a small grooved wheel _L_ fixed upon it, round which, and\r\nthe Plate _Z_, goes a cat-gut string crossing between them; and by this\r\nmeans the Moon’s inclined Plane _YX_ with its Nodes is turned backward,\r\nfor shewing the times and returns of Eclipses § 319, 320.\r\n\r\nThe following parts of this machine must be considered as distinct from\r\nthose already described.\r\n\r\nTowards the right hand, let _S_ be the Earth hung on the wire _e_, which\r\nis fixed into the Plate _B_; and let _O_ be the Moon fixed on the Axis\r\n_M_, and turning round within the cap _P_, in which, and in the Plate\r\n_C_ the crooked wire _Q_ is fixed. On the Axis _M_ is also fixed the\r\nIndex _K_, which goes round a Circle _h_2, divided into 29-1/2 equal\r\nparts, which are the days of the Moon’s age: but to avoid confusion in\r\nthe scheme, it is only marked with the numeral figures 1 2 3 4, for the\r\nQuarters. As the crank _H_ carries this Moon round the Earth _S_ in the\r\nOrbit _t_, she shews all her Phases by means of the cap _P_ for the\r\ndifferent days of her age, which are shewn by the Index _K_; this Index,\r\nturning just as the Moon _O_ does, demonstrates her turning round her\r\nAxis as she still keeps the same side towards the Earth _S_ § 262.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PL. VIII.]\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the Plate _C_, a Moon _N_ goes round an Earth _R_ in\r\nthe Orbit _p_; but this Moon’s Axis is stuck fast into the Plate _C_ at\r\n_S_2; so that neither Moon nor Axis can turn round; and as this Moon\r\ngoes round her Earth she shews herself all round to it; which proves,\r\nthat if the Moon was seen all round from the Earth in a Lunation, she\r\ncould not turn round her Axis.\r\n\r\n_N. B._ If there were only the two wheels _D_ and _F_, with a cat-gut\r\nstring over them, but not crossing between them, the Axis of the Earth\r\n_U_ would keep its parallelism round the Sun _T_, and shew all the\r\nseasons; as I sometimes make these Machines: and the Moon _O_ would go\r\nround the Earth _S_, shewing her Phases as above; as likewise would the\r\nMoon _N_ round the Earth _R_; but then, neither could the diurnal motion\r\nof the Earth _U_ on its Axis be shewn, nor the motion of the Moon _V_\r\nround that Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The CALCULATOR.]\r\n\r\n436. In the year 1746 I contrived a very simple Machine, and described\r\nit’s performance in a small treatise upon the Phenomena of the Harvest\r\nMoon, published in the year 1747. I improved it soon after, by adding\r\nanother wheel, and called it _the Calculator_. It may be easily made by\r\nany Gentleman who has a mechanical Genius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. I.]\r\n\r\nThe great flat Ring supported by twelve pillars, and on which the twelve\r\nSigns with their respective Degrees are laid down, is the Ecliptic;\r\nnearly in the center of it is the Sun _S_ supported by the strong\r\ncrooked Wire _I_; and from the Sun proceeds a Wire _W_, called _the\r\nSolar Ray_, pointing towards the center of the Earth _E_, which is\r\nfurnished with a moveable Horizon _H_, together with a brazen Meridian,\r\nand Quadrant of Altitude. _R_ is a small Ecliptic, whose Plane\r\nco-incides with that of the great one, and has the like Signs and\r\nDegrees marked upon it; and is supported by two Wires _D_ and _D_, which\r\nenter into the Plate _PP_, but may be taken off at pleasure. As the\r\nEarth goes round the Sun, the Signs of this small Circle keep parallel\r\nto themselves, and to those of the great Ecliptic. When it is taken off,\r\nand the solar Ray _W_ drawn farther out, so as almost to touch the\r\nHorizon _H_, or the Quadrant of Altitude, the Horizon being rectified to\r\nany given Latitude, and the Earth turned round its Axis by hand, the\r\npoint of the Wire _W_ shews the Sun’s Declination in passing over the\r\ngraduated brass Meridian, and his height at any given time upon the\r\nQuadrant of Altitude, together with his Azimuth, or point of Bearing\r\nupon the Horizon at that time; and likewise his Amplitude, and time of\r\nRising and Setting by the hour Index, for any day of the year that the\r\nannual Index _U_ points to in the Circle of Months below the Sun. _M_ is\r\na solar Index or Pointer supported by the Wire _L_ which is fixed into\r\nthe knob _K_: the use of this Index is to shew the Sun’s place in the\r\nEcliptic every day in the year; for it goes over the Signs and Degrees\r\nas the Index _U_ goes over the months and days; or rather as they pass\r\nunder the Index _U_, in moving the cover plate with the Earth and its\r\nFurniture round the Sun; for the Index _U_ is fixed tight on the\r\nimmoveable Axis in the Center of the Machine. _K_ is a knob or handle\r\nfor moving the Earth round the Sun, and the Moon round the Earth.\r\n\r\nAs the Earth is carried round the Sun, its Axis constantly keeps the\r\nsame oblique direction, or parallel to itself § 48, 202, shewing thereby\r\nthe different lengths of days and nights at different times of the year,\r\nwith all the various seasons. And, in one annual revolution of the\r\nEarth, the Moon _M_ goes 12-1/3 times round it from Change to Change,\r\nhaving an occasional provision for shewing her different Phases. The\r\nlower end of the Moon’s Axis bears by a small friction wheel upon the\r\ninclined Plane _T_, which causes the Moon to rise above and sink below\r\nthe Ecliptic _R_ in every Lunation; crossing it in her Nodes, which\r\nshift backward through all the Signs and Degrees of the said Ecliptic,\r\nby the retrograde Motion of the inclined Plane _T_, in 18 years and 225\r\ndays. On this Plane the Degrees and Parts of the Moon’s North and South\r\nLatitude are laid down from both the Nodes, one of which, _viz._ the\r\nDescending Node appears at 0, by _DN_ above _B_; the other Node being\r\nhid from Sight on this Plane by the plate _PP_; and from both Nodes, at\r\nproper distances, as in the other Orrery, the limits of Eclipses are\r\nmarked, and all the solar and lunar Eclipses are shewn in the same\r\nmanner, for any given year, within the limits of 6000, either before or\r\nafter the Christian Æra. On the plate that covers the wheel-work, under\r\nthe Sun _S_, and round the knob _K_ are Astronomical Tables, by which\r\nthe Machine may be rectified to the beginning of any given year within\r\nthese limits, in three or four minutes of time; and when once set right,\r\nmay be turned backward for 300 years past, or forward for as many to\r\ncome, without requiring any new rectification. There is a method for its\r\nadding up the 29th of _February_ every fourth year, and allowing only 28\r\ndays to that month for every other three: but all this being performed\r\nby a particular manner of cutting the teeth of the wheels, and dividing\r\nthe month circle, too long and intricate to be described here, I shall\r\nonly shew how these motions may be performed near enough for common use,\r\nby wheels with grooves and cat-gut strings round them, only here I must\r\nput the Operator in mind that the grooves are to be made sharp (not\r\nround) bottomed to keep the strings from slipping.\r\n\r\nThe Moon’s Axis moves up and down in the socket _N_ fixed into the bar\r\n_O_ (which carries her round the Earth) as she rises above or sinks\r\nbelow the Ecliptic; and immediately below the inclined Plane _T_ is a\r\nflat circular plate (between _Y_ and _T_) on which the different\r\nExcentricities of the Moon’s Orbit are laid down; and likewise her mean\r\nAnomaly and elliptic Equation by which her true Place may be very nearly\r\nfound at any time. Below this Apogee-plate, which shews the Anomaly,\r\n&_c_. is a Circle _Y_ divided into 29-1/2 equal parts which are the days\r\nof the Moon’s age: and the forked end _A_ of the Index _AB_ (Fig II) may\r\nbe put into the Apogee-part of this plate; there being just such another\r\nIndex to put into the inclined Plane _T_ at the Ascending Node; and then\r\nthe curved points _B_ of these Indexes shew the direct motion of the\r\nApogee, and retrograde motion of the Nodes through the Ecliptic _R_,\r\nwith their Places in it at any given time. As the Moon _M_ goes round\r\nthe Earth _E_, she shews her Place every day in the Ecliptic _R_, and\r\nthe lower end of her Axis shews her Latitude and distance from her Node\r\non the inclined Plane _T_, also her distance from her Apogee and\r\nPerigee, together with her mean Anomaly, the then Excentricity of her\r\nOrbit, and her elliptic Equation, all on the Apogee Plate, and the day\r\nof her age in the Circle _Y_ of 29-1/2 equal parts; for every day of the\r\nyear pointed out by the annual Index _U_ in the Circle of months.\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the Machine by the Tables for the beginning of any\r\nyear, move the Earth and Moon forward by the knob _K_, until the annual\r\nIndex comes to any given day of the month; then stop, and not only all\r\nthe above Phenomena may be shewn for that day, but also, by turning the\r\nEarth round its Axis, the Declination, Azimuth, Amplitude, Altitude of\r\nthe Moon at any hour, and the times of her Rising and Setting, are shewn\r\nby the Horizon, Quadrant of Altitude, and hour Index. And in moving the\r\nEarth round the Sun, the days of all the New and Full Moons and Eclipses\r\nin any given year are shewn. The Phenomena of the Harvest Moon, and\r\nthose of the Tides, by such a cap as that in Plate 9 Fig. 10. put upon\r\nthe Earth and Moon, together with the solution of many problems not here\r\nrelated, are made conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PL. VIII.]\r\n\r\nThe easiest, though not the best way, that I can instruct any mechanical\r\nperson to make the wheel-work of such a machine, is as follows; which is\r\nthe way that I made it, before I thought of numbers exact enough to make\r\nit worth the trouble of cutting teeth in the wheels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3d of Plate 8 is a section of this Machine; in which _ABCD_ is a\r\nframe of wood held together by four pillars at the corners, whereof two\r\nappear at _AC_ and _BD_. In the lower Plate _CD_ of this Frame are three\r\nsmall friction-wheels, at equal distances from each other; two of them\r\nappearing at _e_ and _e_. As the frame is moved round, these wheels run\r\nupon the fixed bottom Plate _EE_ which supports the whole work.\r\n\r\nIn the Center of this last mentioned Plate is fixed the upright Axis _f_\r\n_FFG_, and on the same Axis is fixed the wheel _HHH_ in which are four\r\ngrooves _I_, _X_, _k_, _L_ of different Diameters. In these grooves are\r\ncat-gut strings going also round the separate wheels _M_, _N_, _O_ and\r\n_P_.\r\n\r\nThe wheel _M_ is fixed on a solid Spindle or Axis, the lower pivot of\r\nwhich turns at _R_ in the under Plate of the moveable frame _ABCD_; and\r\non the upper end of this Axis is fixed the Plate _o o_ (which is _PP_,\r\nunder the Earth, in Fig. I.) and to this Plate is fixed, at an Angle of\r\n23-1/2 Degrees inclination, the Dial-plate below the Earth _T_; on the\r\nAxis of which, the Index _q_ is turned round by the Earth. This Axis,\r\ntogether with the Wheel _M_, and Plate _o o_, keep their parallelism in\r\ngoing round the Sun _S_.\r\n\r\nOn the Axis of the wheel _M_ is a moveable socket on which the small\r\nwheel _N_ is fixed, and on the upper end of this socket is put on tight\r\n(but so as it may be occasionally turned by hand) the bar _ZZ_ (_viz._\r\nthe bar _O_ in Fig. I.) which carries the Moon _m_ round the Earth _T_,\r\nby the Socket _n_, fixed into the bar. As the Moon goes round the Earth\r\nher Axis rises and falls in the Socket _n_; because, on the lower end of\r\nher Axis, which is turned inward, there is a small friction Wheel _s_\r\nrunning on the inclined Plane _X_ (which is _T_ in Fig. I.) and so\r\ncauses the Moon alternately to rise above and sink below the little\r\nEcliptic _VV_ (_R_ in Fig. I.) in every Lunation.\r\n\r\nOn the Socket or hollow Axis of the Wheel _N_, there is another Socket\r\non which the Wheel _O_ is fixed; and the Moon’s inclined Plane _X_ is\r\nput tightly on the upper end of this Socket, not on a square, but on a\r\nround, that it may be occasionally set by hand without wrenching the\r\nWheel or Axle.\r\n\r\nLastly, on the hollow Axis of the Wheel _O_ is another Socket on which\r\nis fixed the Wheel _P_, and on the upper end of this Socket is put on\r\ntightly the Apogee-plate _Y_, (that immediately below _T_ in Fig. I.)\r\nall these Axles turn in the upper Plate of the moveable frame at _Q_\r\nwhich Plate is covered with the thin Plate _cc_ (screwed to it) whereon\r\nare the fore-mentioned Tables and month Circle in Fig. I.\r\n\r\nThe middle part of the thick fixed Wheel _HHH_ is much broader than the\r\nrest of it, and comes out between the Wheels _M_ and _O_ almost to the\r\nWheel _N_. To adjust the diameters of the grooves of this fixed wheel to\r\nthe grooves of the separate Wheels _M_, _N_, _O_ and _P_, so as they may\r\nperform their motions in the proper times, the following method must be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe Groove of the Wheel _M_, which keeps the parallelism of the Earth’s\r\nAxis, must be precisely of the same Diameter as the lower Groove _I_ of\r\nthe fixed Wheel _HHH_; but, when this Groove is so well adjusted as to\r\nshew, that in ever so many annual revolutions of the Earth, its Axis\r\nkeeps its parallelism, as may be observed by the solar Ray _W_ (Fig. I.)\r\nalways coming precisely to the same Degree of the small Ecliptic _R_ at\r\nthe end of every annual revolution, when the Index _M_ points to the\r\nlike Degree in the great Ecliptic; then, with the edge of a thin File\r\ngive the Groove of the Wheel _M_ a small rub all round; and by that\r\nmeans, lessening the Diameter of the Groove, perhaps about the 20th part\r\nof a hair’s breadth, it will cause the Earth to shew the precession of\r\nthe Equinoxes; which, in many annual revolutions will begin to be\r\nsensible as the Earth’s Axis slowly deviates from its parallelism § 246,\r\ntowards the antecedent Signs of the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe Diameter of the Groove of the Wheel _N_, which carries the Moon\r\nround the Earth, must be to the Diameter of the Groove _X_ as a Lunation\r\nis to a year; that is, as 29-1/2 to 365-1/4.\r\n\r\nThe Diameter of the Groove of the Wheel _O_, which turns the inclined\r\nPlane _X_ with the Moon’s Nodes backward, must be to the Diameter of the\r\nGroove _k_ as 20 to 18-225/365. And,\r\n\r\nLastly, the Diameter of the Groove of the Wheel _P_, which carries the\r\nMoon’s Apogee forward, must be to the Diameter of the Groove _L_ as 70\r\nto 62.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\nBut, after all this nice adjustment of the Grooves to the proportional\r\ntimes of their respective Wheels turning round, and which seems to\r\npromise very well in Theory, there will still be found a necessity of a\r\nfarther adjustment by hand; because proper allowance must be made for\r\nthe Diameters of the cat-gut strings: and the Grooves must be so\r\nadjusted by hand, as, that in the time the Earth is moved once round the\r\nSun, the Moon must perform 12 synodical revolutions round the Earth, and\r\nbe almost 11 days old in her 13th revolution. The inclined Plane with\r\nits Nodes must go once round backward through all the Signs and Degrees\r\nof the small Ecliptic in 18 annual revolutions of the Earth and 225 days\r\nover. And the Apogee-plate must go once round forward, so as its Index\r\nmay go over all the Signs and Degrees of the small Ecliptic in eight\r\nyears (or so many annual revolutions of the Earth) and 312 days over.\r\n\r\n_N. B._ The string which goes round the Grooves _X_ and _N_ for the\r\nMoon’s Motion must cross between these Wheels; but all the rest of the\r\nstrings go in their respective Grooves _IM_, _kO_, and _LP_ without\r\ncrossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The COMETARIUM.]\r\n\r\n437. The COMETARIUM. This curious Machine shews the Motion of a Comet or\r\nexcentric Body moving round the Sun, describing equal Areas in equal\r\ntimes § 152, and may be so contrived as to shew such a Motion for any\r\nDegree of Excentricity. It was invented by the late Dr. _Desaguliers_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\nThe dark elliptical Groove round the letters _abcdefghiklm_ is the Orbit\r\nof the Comet _Y_: this Comet is carried round in the Groove according to\r\nthe order of letters, by the Wire _W_, fixed in the Sun _S_, and slides\r\non the Wire as it approaches nearer to or recedes farther from the Sun,\r\nbeing nearest of all in the Perihelion _a_, and farthest in the Aphelion\r\n_g_. The Areas _aSb_, _bSc_, _cSd_ &c. or contents of these several\r\nTriangles are all equal; and in every turn of the Winch _N_ the Comet\r\n_Y_ is carried over one of these Areas; consequently in as much time as\r\nit moves, from _f_ to _g_, or from _g_ to _h_, it moves from _m_ to _a_,\r\nor from _a_ to _b_; and so of the rest, being quickest of all at _a_,\r\nand slowest at _g_. Thus, the Comet’s velocity in its Orbit continually\r\ndecreases from the Perihelion _a_ to the Aphelion _g_; and increases in\r\nthe same proportion from _g_ to _a_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLATE IV.]\r\n\r\nThe elliptic Orbit is divided into 12 equal Parts or Signs with their\r\nrespective Degrees, and so is the Circle _n o p q r s t n_ which\r\nrepresents a great Circle in the Heavens, and to which all the fixed\r\nStars in the Comet’s way are referred. Whilst the Comet moves from _f_\r\nto _g_ in its Orbit it appears to move only about 5 Degrees in this\r\nCircle, as is shewn by the small knob on the end of the Wire _W_; but in\r\nas short time as the Comet moves from _m_ to _a_, or from _a_ to _b_,\r\nand it appears to describe the large space _tn_ or _no_ in the Heavens,\r\neither of which spaces contains 120 Degrees or four Signs. Were the\r\nExcentricity of its Orbit greater, the greater still would be the\r\ndifference of its Motion, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n_ABCDEFGHIKLMA_ is a circular Orbit for shewing the equable Motion of a\r\nBody round the Sun _S_, describing equal Areas _ASB_, _BSC_, &c. in\r\nequal times with those of the Body _Y_ in its elliptical Orbit above\r\nmentioned; but with this difference, that the circular Motion describes\r\nthe equal Arcs _AB_, _BC_, &c. in the same equal times that the\r\nelliptical Motion describes the unequal Arcs _ab_, _bc_, &c.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose the two Bodies _Y_ and I to start from the Points _a_ and\r\n_A_ at the same moment of time, and each having gone round its\r\nrespective Orbit, to arrive at these Points again at the same instant,\r\nthe Body _Y_ will be forwarder in its Orbit than the Body I all the way\r\nfrom _a_ to _g_, and from _A_ to _G_; but I will be forwarder than _Y_\r\nthrough all the other half of the Orbit; and the difference is equal to\r\nthe Equation of the Body _Y_ in its Orbit. At the Points _a_, _A_, and\r\n_g_, _G_, that is, in the Perihelion and Aphelion, they will be equal;\r\nand then the Equation vanishes. This shews why the Equation of a Body\r\nmoving in an elliptic Orbit, is added to the mean or supposed circular\r\nMotion from the Perihelion to the Aphelion, and subtracted from the\r\nAphelion to the Perihelion, in Bodies moving round the Sun, or from the\r\nPerigee to the Apogee, and from the Apogee to the Perigee in the Moon’s\r\nMotion round the Earth, according to the Precepts in the 355th Article;\r\nonly we are to consider, that when Motion is turned into Time, it\r\nreverses the titles in the Table of _The Moon’s elliptic Equation_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.]\r\n\r\nThis curious Motion is performed in the following manner. _ABC_ is a\r\nwooden bar (in the box containing the wheel-work) above which are the\r\nwheels _D_ and _E_; and below it the elliptic Plates _FF_ and _GG_; each\r\nPlate being fixed on an Axis in one of its Focuses, at _E_ and _K_; and\r\nthe Wheel _E_ is fixed on the same Axis with the Plate _FF_. These\r\nPlates have Grooves round their edges precisely of equal Diameters to\r\none another, and in these Grooves is the cat-gut string _gg_, _gg_\r\ncrossing between the Plates at _h_. On _H_, the Axis of the handle or\r\nwinch _N_ in Fig. 4th, is an endless screw in Fig. 5, working in the\r\nWheels _D_ and _E_, whose numbers of teeth being equal, and should be\r\nequal to the number of lines _aS_, _bS_, _cS_, &c. in Fig. 4, they turn\r\nround their Axes in equal times to one another, and to the Motion of the\r\nelliptic Plates. For, the Wheels _D_ and _E_ having equal numbers of\r\nteeth, the Plate _FF_ being fixed on the same Axis with the Wheel _E_,\r\nand the Plate _FF_ turning the equally big Plate _GG_ by a cat-gut\r\nstring round them both, they must all go round their Axes in as many\r\nturns of the handle _N_ as either of the Wheels has teeth.\r\n\r\n’Tis easy to see, that the end _h_ of the elliptical Plate _FF_ being\r\nfarther from its Axis _E_ than the opposite end _i_ is, must describe a\r\nCircle so much the larger in proportion; and therefore move through so\r\nmuch more space in the same time; and for that reason the end _h_ moves\r\nso much faster than the end _i_, although it goes no sooner round the\r\nCenter _E_. But then, the quick-moving end _h_ of the Plate _FF_ leads\r\nabout the short end _hK_ of the Plate _GG_ with the same velocity; and\r\nthe slow moving end _i_ of the Plate _FF_ coming half round as to _B_,\r\nmust then lead the long end _k_ of the Plate _GG_ as slowly about: So\r\nthat the elliptical Plate _FF_ and it’s Axis _E_ move uniformly and\r\nequally quick in every part of its revolution; but the elliptical Plate\r\n_GG_, together with its Axis _K_ must move very unequally in different\r\nparts of its revolution; the difference being always inversely as the\r\ndistance of any point of the Circumference of _GG_ from its Axis at _K_:\r\nor in other words, to instance in two points, if the distance _Kk_ be\r\nfour, five, or six times as great as the distance _Kh_, the Point _h_\r\nwill move in that position four, five, or six times as fast as the Point\r\n_k_ does, when the Plate _GG_ has gone half round: and so on for any\r\nother Excentricity or difference of the Distances _Kk_ and _Kh_. The\r\ntooth _i_ on the Plate _FF_ falls in between the two teeth at _k_ on the\r\nPlate _GG_, by which means the revolution of the latter is so adjusted\r\nto that of the former, that they can never vary from one another.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the Axis of the equally moving Wheel _D_, in Fig. 5th, is\r\nthe Sun _S_ in Fig. 4th; which Sun, by the Wire _Z_ fixed to it, carries\r\nthe Ball I round the Circle _ABCD_, &c. with an equable Motion according\r\nto the order of the letters: and on the top of the Axis _K_ of the\r\nunequally moving Ellipsis _GG_, in Fig. 5th, is the Sun _S_ in Fig. 4th,\r\ncarrying the Ball _Y_ unequably round in the elliptical Groove _a b c\r\nd_, &c. _N.B._ This elliptical Groove must be precisely equal and\r\nsimilar to the verge of the Plate _GG_, which is also equal to that of\r\n_FF_.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, Machines may be made to shew the true Motion of the Moon\r\nabout the Earth, or of any Planet about the Sun; by making the\r\nelliptical Plates of the same Excentricities, in proportion to the\r\nRadius, as the Orbits of the Planets are whose Motions they represent:\r\nand so, their different Equations in different parts of their Orbits may\r\nbe made plain to sight; and clearer Ideas of these Motions and Equations\r\nacquired in half an hour, than could be gained from reading half a day\r\nabout such Motions and Equations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The improved CELESTIAL GLOBE.\r\n\r\n           PLATE III. Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n438. The _Improved Celestial Globe_. On the North Pole of the Axis,\r\nabove the Hour Circle, is fixed an Arch _MKH_ of 23-1/2 Degrees; and at\r\nthe end _H_ is fixed an upright pin _HG_, which stands directly over the\r\nNorth Pole of the Ecliptic, and perpendicular to that part of the\r\nsurface of the Globe. On this pin are two moveable Collets at _D_ and\r\n_H_, to which are fixed the quadrantal Wires _N_ and _O_, having two\r\nlittle Balls on their ends for the Sun and Moon, as in the Figure. The\r\nCollet _D_ is fixed to the circular Plate _F_ whereon the 29-1/2 days of\r\nthe Moon’s age are engraven, beginning just under the Sun’s Wire _N_;\r\nand as this Wire is moved round the Globe, the Plate _F_ turns round\r\nwith it. These Wires are easily turned if the Screw _G_ be slackened;\r\nand when they are set to their proper places, the Screw serves to fix\r\nthem there so, as in turning the Ball of the Globe, the Wires with the\r\nSun and Moon go round with it; and these two little Balls rise and set\r\nat the same times, and on the same points of the Horizon, for the day to\r\nwhich they are rectified, as the Sun and Moon do in the Heavens.\r\n\r\nBecause the Moon keeps not her course in the Ecliptic (as the Sun\r\nappears to do) but has a Declination of 5-1/3 Degrees on each side from\r\nit in every Lunation § 317, her Ball may be screwed as many Degrees to\r\neither side of the Ecliptic as her Latitude or Declination from the\r\nEcliptic amounts to at any given time; and for this purpose _S_ is a\r\nsmall piece of pasteboard, of which the curved edge _S_ is to be set\r\nupon the Globe at right Angles to the Ecliptic, and the dark line over\r\n_S_ to stand upright upon it. From this line, on the convex edge, are\r\ndrawn the 5-1/3 Degrees of the Moon’s Latitude on both sides of the\r\nEcliptic; and when this piece is set upright on the Globe, it’s\r\ngraduated edge reaches to the Moon on the Wire _O_, by which means she\r\nis easily adjusted to her Latitude found by an Ephemeris.\r\n\r\nThe Horizon is supported by two semicircular Arches, because Pillars\r\nwould stop the progress of the Balls when they go below the Horizon in\r\nan oblique sphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To rectify it.]\r\n\r\n_To rectify the Globe._ Elevate the Pole to the Latitude of the Place;\r\nthen bring the Sun’s place in the Ecliptic for the given day to the\r\nbrasen Meridian, and set the Hour Index to XII at noon, that is, to the\r\nupper XII on the Hour Circle; keeping the Globe in that situation,\r\nslacken the Screw _G_, and set the Sun directly over his place on the\r\nMeridian; which done, set the Moon’s Wire under the number that\r\nexpresses her age for that day on the Plate _F_, and she will then stand\r\nover her place in the Ecliptic, and shew what Constellation she is in.\r\nLastly, fasten the Screw _G_, and laying the curved edge of the\r\npasteboard _S_ over the Ecliptic below the Moon, adjust the Moon to her\r\nLatitude over the graduated edge of the pasteboard; and the Globe will\r\nbe rectified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s use.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus rectified the Globe, turn it round, and observe on what\r\npoints of the Horizon the Sun and Moon Balls rise and set, for these\r\nagree with the points of the Compass on which the Sun and Moon rise and\r\nset in the Heavens on the given day; and the Hour Index shews the times\r\nof their rising and setting; and likewise the time of the Moon’s passing\r\nover the Meridian.\r\n\r\nThis simple Apparatus shews all the varieties that can happen in the\r\nrising and setting of the Sun and Moon; and makes the forementioned\r\nPhenomena of the Harvest Moon (Chap. xvi.) plain to the Eye. It is also\r\nvery useful in reading Lectures on the Globes, because a large company\r\ncan see this Sun and Moon going round, rising above and setting below\r\nthe Horizon at different times, according to the seasons of the year;\r\nand making their appulses to different fixed Stars. But, in the usual\r\nway, where there is only the places of the Sun and Moon in the Ecliptic\r\nto keep the Eye upon, they are easily lost sight of, unless covered with\r\nPatches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The PLANETARY GLOBE.\r\n\r\n           PL. VIII. Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\n439. The _Planetary Globe_. In this Machine, _T_ is a terrestrial Globe\r\nfixed on its Axis standing upright on the Pedestal _CDE_, on which is an\r\nHour Circle, having its Index fixed on the Axis, which turns somewhat\r\ntightly in the Pedestal, so that the Globe may not be liable to shake;\r\nto prevent which, the Pedestal is about two Inches thick, and the Axis\r\ngoes quite through it, bearing on a shoulder. The Globe is hung in a\r\ngraduated brasen Meridian, much in the usual way; and the thin Plate\r\n_N_, _NE_, _E_, is a moveable Horizon, graduated round the outer edge,\r\nfor shewing the Bearings and Amplitudes of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.\r\nThe brasen Meridian is grooved round the outer edge; and in this Groove\r\nis a slender Semi-circle of brass, the ends of which are fixed to the\r\nHorizon in its North and South Points: this Semi-circle slides in the\r\nGroove as the Horizon is moved in rectifying it for different Latitudes.\r\nTo the middle of the Semi-circle is fixed a Pin which always keeps in\r\nthe Zenith of the Horizon, and on this Pin the Quadrant of Altitude _q_\r\nturns; the lower end of which, in all Positions, touches the Horizon as\r\nit is moved round the same. This Quadrant is divided into 90 Degrees\r\nfrom the Horizon to the zenithal Pin on which it is turned, at 90. The\r\ngreat flat Circle or Plate _AB_ is the Ecliptic, on the outer edge of\r\nwhich, the Signs and Degrees are laid down; and every fifth Degree is\r\ndrawn through the rest of the surface of this Plate towards its Center.\r\nOn this Plate are seven Grooves, to which seven little Balls are\r\nadjusted by sliding Wires, so that they are easily moved in the Grooves,\r\nwithout danger of starting out of them. The Ball next the terrestrial\r\nGlobe is the Moon, the next without it is Mercury, the next Venus, the\r\nnext the Sun, then Mars, then Jupiter, and lastly Saturn; and in order\r\nto know them, they are separately stampt with the following Characters;\r\n☽, ☿, ♀, ☉, ♂, ♃, ♄. This Plate or Ecliptic is supported by four strong\r\nWires, having their lower ends fixed into the Pedestal, at _C_, _D_, and\r\n_E_, the fourth being hid by the Globe. The Ecliptic is inclined 23-1/2\r\nDegrees to the Pedestal, and is therefore properly inclined to the Axis\r\nof the Globe which stands upright on the Pedestal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To rectify it.]\r\n\r\n_To rectify this Machine._ Set all the planetary Balls to their\r\ngeocentric places in the Ecliptic for any given time by an Ephemeris:\r\nthen, set the North Point of the Horizon to the Latitude of your place\r\non the brasen Meridian, and the Quadrant of Altitude to the South Point\r\nof the Horizon; which done, turn the Globe with its Furniture till the\r\nQuadrant of Altitude comes right against the Sun, _viz._ to his place in\r\nthe Ecliptic; and keeping it there, set the Hour Index to the XII next\r\nthe letter _C_; and the Machine will be rectified, not only for the\r\nfollowing Problems, but for several others, which the Artist may easily\r\nfind out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PROBLEM I.\r\n\r\n   _To find the Amplitudes, Meridian Altitudes, and times of Rising,\r\n       Culminating, and Setting, of the Sun, Moon, and Planets._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s use.]\r\n\r\nTurn the Globe round eastward, or according to the order of Signs; and\r\nas the eastern edge of the Horizon comes right against the Sun, Moon, or\r\nany Planet, the Hour Index will shew the time of it’s rising; and the\r\ninner edge of the Ecliptic will cut it’s rising Amplitude in the\r\nHorizon. Turn on, and as the Quadrant of Altitude comes right against\r\nthe Sun, Moon, or Planets, the Ecliptic cuts their meridian Altitudes in\r\nthe Quadrant, and the Hour Index shews the times of their coming to the\r\nMeridian. Continue turning, and as the western edge of the Horizon comes\r\nright against the Sun, Moon, or Planets, their setting Amplitudes are\r\ncut in the Horizon by the Ecliptic; and the times of their setting are\r\nshewn by the Index on the Hour Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROBLEM II.\r\n\r\n_To find the Altitude and Azimuth of the Sun, Moon, and Planets, at any\r\n                time of their being above the Horizon._\r\n\r\nTurn the Globe till the Index comes to the given time in the Hour\r\nCircle; then keep the Globe steady, and moving the Quadrant of Altitude\r\nto each Planet respectively, the edge of the Ecliptic will cut the\r\nPlanet’s mean Altitude on the Quadrant, and the Quadrant will cut the\r\nPlanet’s Azimuth, or Point of Bearing on the Horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROBLEM III.\r\n\r\n_The Sun’s Altitude being given at any time either before or after Noon,\r\n to find the Hour of the Day, and the Variation of the Compass, in any\r\n                            known Latitude._\r\n\r\nWith one hand hold the edge of the Quadrant right against the Sun; and,\r\nwith the other hand, turn the Globe westward, if it be in the forenoon,\r\nor eastward if it be in the afternoon, until the Sun’s place at the\r\ninner edge of the Ecliptic cuts the Quadrant in the Sun’s observed\r\nAltitude; and then the Hour Index will point out the time of the day,\r\nand the Quadrant will cut the true Azimuth, or Bearing of the Sun for\r\nthat time: the difference between which, and the Bearing shewn by the\r\nAzimuth Compass, shews the variation of the Compass in that place of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The TRAJECTORIUM LUNARE.\r\n\r\n           PL. VII. Fig. V.]\r\n\r\n440. The _Trajectorium Lunare_. This Machine is for delineating the\r\npaths of the Earth and Moon, shewing what sort of Curves they make in\r\nthe etherial regions; and was just mentioned in the 266th Article. _S_\r\nis the Sun, and _E_ the Earth, whose Centers are 81 Inches distant from\r\neach other; every Inch answering to a Million of Miles § 47. _M_ is the\r\nMoon, whose Center is 24/100 parts of an Inch from the Earth’s in this\r\nMachine, this being in just proportion to the Moon’s distance from the\r\nEarth § 52. _AA_ is a Bar of Wood, to be moved by hand round the Axis\r\n_g_ which is fixed in the Wheel _Y_. The Circumference of this Wheel is\r\nto the Circumference of the small Wheel _L_ (below the other end of the\r\nBar) as 365-1/4 days is to 29-1/2; or as a Year is to a Lunation. The\r\nWheels are grooved round their edges, and in the Grooves is the cat-gut\r\nstring _GG_ crossing between the Wheels at _X_. On the Axis of the Wheel\r\n_L_ is the Index _F_, in which is fixed the Moon’s Axis _M_ for carrying\r\nher round the Earth _E_ (fixed on the Axis of the Wheel _L_) in the time\r\nthat the Index goes round a Circle of 29-1/2 equal parts, which are the\r\ndays of the Moon’s age. The Wheel _Y_ has the Months and Days of the\r\nyear all round it’s Limb; and in the Bar _AA_ is fixed the Index _I_,\r\nwhich points out the Days of the Months answering to the Days of the\r\nMoon’s age, shewn by the Index _F_, in the Circle of 29-1/2 equal parts\r\nat the other end of the Bar. On the Axis of the Wheel _L_ is put the\r\npiece _D_, below the Cock _C_, in which this Axis turns round; and in\r\n_D_ are put the Pencils _e_ and _m_, directly under the Earth _E_ and\r\nMoon _M_; so that _m_ is carried round _e_ as _M_ is round _E_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s use.]\r\n\r\nLay the Machine on an even Floor, pressing gently on the Wheel _Y_ to\r\ncause its spiked Feet (of which two appear at _P_ and _P_, the third\r\nbeing supposed to be hid from sight by the Wheel) enter a little into\r\nthe Floor to secure the Wheel from turning. Then lay a paper about four\r\nfoot long under the Pencils _e_ and _m_, cross-wise to the Bar: which\r\ndone, move the Bar slowly round the Axis _g_ of the Wheel _Y_; and, as\r\nthe Earth _E_ goes round the Sun _S_, the Moon _M_ will go round the\r\nEarth with a duly proportioned velocity; and the friction Wheel _W_\r\nrunning on the Floor, will keep the Bar from bearing too heavily on the\r\nPencils _e_ and _m_, which will delineate the paths of the Earth and\r\nMoon, as in Fig. 2d, already described at large, § 266, 267. As the\r\nIndex _I_ points out the Days of the Months, the Index _F_ shews the\r\nMoon’s age on these Days, in the Circle of 29-1/2 equal parts. And as\r\nthis last Index points to the different Days in it’s Circle, the like\r\nnumeral Figures may be set to those parts of the Curves of the Earth’s\r\nPath and Moon’s, where the Pencils _e_ and _m_ are at those times\r\nrespectively, to shew the places of the Earth and Moon. If the Pencil\r\n_e_ be pushed a very little off, as if from the Pencil _m_, to about\r\n1/40 part of their distance, and the Pencil _m_ pushed as much towards\r\n_e_, to bring them to the same distances again, though not to the same\r\npoints of space; then as _m_ goes round _e_, _e_ will go as it were\r\nround the Center of Gravity between the Earth _e_ and Moon _m_ § 298:\r\nbut this Motion will not sensibly alter the Figure of the Earth’s Path\r\nor the Moon’s.\r\n\r\nIf a Pin as _p_ be put through the Pencil _m_, with its head towards\r\nthat of the Pin _q_ in the Pencil _e_, its head will always keep thereto\r\nas _m_ goes round _e_, or as the same side of the Moon is still obverted\r\nto the Earth. But the Pin _p_, which may be considered as an equatoreal\r\nDiameter of the Moon, will turn quite round the Point _m_, making all\r\npossible Angles with the Line of its progress or line of the Moon’s\r\nPath. This is an ocular proof of the Moon’s turning round her Axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The TIDE DIAL.\r\n\r\n           PLATE IX. Fig. VII.\r\n\r\n           It’s use.]\r\n\r\n441. The TIDE-DIAL. The outside parts of this Machine consist of, 1. An\r\neight-sided Box, on the top of which at the corner is shewn the Phases\r\nof the Moon at the Octants, Quarters, and Full. Within these is a Circle\r\nof 29-1/2 equal parts, which are the days of the Moon’s age accounted\r\nfrom the Sun at New Moon round to the same again. Within this Circle is\r\none of 24 hours divided into their respective Halves and Quarters. 2. A\r\nmoving elliptical Plate painted blue to represent the rising of the\r\nTides under and opposite to the Moon; and has the words, _High Water,\r\nTide falling, Low Water, Tide rising_, marked upon it. To one end of\r\nthis Plate is fixed the Moon _M_ by the Wire _W_, and goes along with\r\nit. 3. Above this elliptical Plate is a round one, with the Points of\r\nthe Compass upon it, and also the names of above 200 places in the large\r\nMachine (but only 32 in the Figure to avoid confusion) set over those\r\nPoints on which the Moon bears when she raises the Tides to the greatest\r\nheights at these Places twice in every lunar day: and to the North and\r\nSouth Points of this Plate are fixed two Indexes _I_ and _K_, which shew\r\nthe times of High Water in the Hour Circle at all these places. 4. Below\r\nthe elliptical Plate are four small Plates, two of which project out\r\nfrom below its ends at New and Full Moon; and so, by lengthening the\r\nEllipse shew the Spring Tides, which are then raised to the greatest\r\nheights by the united attractions of the Sun and Moon § 302. The other\r\ntwo of these small Plates appear at low water when the Moon is in her\r\nQuadratures, or at the sides of the elliptic Plate, to shew the Nepe\r\nTides; the Sun and Moon then acting cross-wise to each other. When any\r\ntwo of these small Plates appear, the other two are hid; and when the\r\nMoon is in her Octants they all disappear, there being neither Spring\r\nnor Nepe Tides at those times. Within the Box are a few Wheels for\r\nperforming these Motions by the Handle or Winch _H_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIII.\r\n\r\n_J. Ferguson inv. et del._      _J. Mynde Sculp._]\r\n\r\nTurn the Handle until the Moon _M_ comes to any given day of her age in\r\nthe Circle of 29-1/2 equal parts, and the Moon’s Wire _W_ will cut the\r\ntime of her coming to the Meridian on that day, in the Hour Circle; the\r\nXII under the Sun being Mid-day, and the opposite XII Mid-night: then\r\nlooking for the name of any given place on the round Plate (which makes\r\n29-1/2 rotations whilst the Moon _M_ makes only one revolution from the\r\nSun to the Sun again) turn the Handle till _that_ place comes to the\r\nword _High Water_ under the Moon, and the Index which falls among the\r\nAfternoon Hours will shew the time of high water at that place in the\r\nAfternoon of the given day: then turn the Plate half round, till the\r\nsame place comes to the opposite High Water Mark, and the Index will\r\nshew the time of High Water in the Forenoon at that place. And thus, as\r\nall the different places come successively under and opposite to the\r\nMoon, the Indexes shew the times of High Water at them in both parts of\r\nthe day: and when the same places come to the Low Water Marks the\r\nIndexes shew the times of Low Water. For about two days before and after\r\nthe times of New and Full Moon, the two small Plates come out a little\r\nway from below the High Water Marks on the elliptical Plate, to shew\r\nthat the Tides rise still higher about these times: and about the\r\nQuarters, the other two Plates come out a little from under the Low\r\nWater Marks towards the Sun and on the opposite side, shewing that the\r\nTides of Flood rise not then so high, nor do the Tides of Ebb fall so\r\nlow, as at other times.\r\n\r\nBy pulling the Handle a little way outward, it is disengaged from the\r\nWheel-work, and then the upper Plate may be turned round quickly by hand\r\nso, as the Moon may be brought to any given day of her age in about a\r\nquarter of a minute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inside work described.\r\n\r\n           Fig. VIII.]\r\n\r\nOn _AB_, the Axis of the Handle _H_, is an endless Screw _C_ which turns\r\nthe Wheel _FED_ of 24 teeth round in 24 revolutions of the Handle: this\r\nWheel turns another _ONG_ of 48 teeth, and on its Axis is the Pinion\r\n_PQ_ of four leaves which turns the Wheel _LKI_ of 59 teeth round in\r\n29-1/2 turnings or rotations of the Wheel _FED_, or in 708 revolutions\r\nof the Handle, which is the number of Hours in a synodical revolution of\r\nthe Moon. The round Plate with the names of Places upon it is fixed on\r\nthe Axis of the Wheel _FED_; and the Elliptical or Tide-Plate with the\r\nMoon fixed to it is upon the Axis of the Wheel _LKI_; consequently, the\r\nformer makes 29-1/2 revolutions in the time that the latter makes one.\r\nThe whole Wheel _FED_ with the endless Screw _C_, and dotted part of the\r\nAxis of the Handle _AB_, together with the dotted part of the Wheel\r\n_ONG_, lie hid below the large Wheel _LKI_.\r\n\r\nFig. 9th represents the under side of the Elliptical or Tide-Plate\r\n_abcd_, with the four small Plates _ABCD_, _EFGH_, _IKLM_, _NOPQ_ upon\r\nit: each of which has two slits as _TT_, _SS_, _RR_, _UU_ sliding on two\r\nPins as _nn_, fixed in the elliptical Plate. In the four small Plates\r\nare fixed four Pins at _W_, _X_, _Y_, and _Z_; all of which work in an\r\nelliptic Groove _oooo_ on the cover of the Box below the elliptical\r\nPlate; the longest Axis of this Groove being in a right line with the\r\nSun and Full Moon. Consequently, when the Moon is in Conjunction or\r\nOpposition, the Pins _W_ and _X_ thrust out the Plates _ABCD_ and _IKLM_\r\na little beyond the ends of the elliptic Plate at _d_ and _b_, to _f_\r\nand _e_; whilst the Pins _Y_ and _Z_ draw in the Plates _EFGH_ and\r\n_NOPQ_ quite under the elliptic Plate to _g_ and _h_. But, when the Moon\r\ncomes to her first or third Quarter, the elliptic Plate lies across the\r\nfixed elliptic Groove in which the Pins work; and therefore the end\r\nPlates _ABCD_ and _IKLM_ are drawn in below the great Plate, and the\r\nother two Plates _EFGH_ and _NOPQ_ are thrust out beyond it to _a_ and\r\n_c_. When the Moon is in her Octants the Pins _V, X, Y, Z_ are in the\r\nparts _o, o, o, o_ of the elliptic Groove, which parts are at a mean\r\nbetween the greatest and least distances from the Center _q_, and then\r\nall the four small Plates disappear below the great one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ECLIPSAREON.\r\n\r\n           Pl.

This Piece of Mechanism exhibits the Time,\r\nQuantity, Duration, and Progress of solar Eclipses, at all Parts of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of this Machine are, 1. A terrestrial Globe _A_\r\nturned round its Axis _B_ by the Handle or Winch _M_; the Axis _B_\r\ninclines 23-1/2 Degrees, and has an Index which goes round the Hour\r\nCircle _D_ in each rotation of the Globe. 2. A circular Plate _E_ on the\r\nLimb of which the Months and Days of the year are inserted. This Plate\r\nsupports the Globe, and gives its Axis the same position to the Sun, or\r\nto a candle properly placed, that the Earth’s Axis has to the Sun upon\r\nany day of the year § 338, by turning the Plate till the given Day of\r\nthe Month comes to the fixed Pointer or annual Index _G_. 3. A crooked\r\nWire _F_ which points towards the middle of the Earth’s enlightened Disc\r\nat all times, and shews to what place of the Earth the Sun is vertical\r\nat any given time. 4. A Penumbra, or thin circular Plate of brass _I_\r\ndivided into 12 Digits by 12 concentric Circles, which represent a\r\nSection of the Moon’s Penumbra, and is proportioned to the size of the\r\nGlobe; so that the shadow of this Plate, formed by the Sun, or a candle\r\nplaced at a convenient distance, with it’s Rays transmitted through a\r\nconvex Lens to make them fall parallel on the Globe, covers exactly all\r\nthose places upon it that the Moon’s Shadow and Penumbra do on the\r\nEarth: so that the Phenomena of any solar Eclipse may be shewn by this\r\nMachine with candle-light, almost as well as by the light of the Sun. 5.\r\nAn upright frame _HHHH_, on the sides of which are Scales of the Moon’s\r\nLatitude or Declination from the Ecliptic. To these Scales are fitted\r\ntwo Sliders _K_ and _K_, with Indexes for adjusting the Penumbra’s\r\nCenter to the Moon’s Latitude, as it is North or South Ascending or\r\nDescending. 6. A solar Horizon _C_, dividing the enlightened Hemisphere\r\nof the Globe from that which is in the dark at any given time, and\r\nshewing at what places the general Eclipse begins and ends with the\r\nrising or setting Sun. 7. A Handle _M_, which turns the Globe round it’s\r\nAxis by wheel-work, and at the same time moves the Penumbra across the\r\nframe by threads over the Pullies _L, L, L_, with the velocity duly\r\nproportioned to that of the Moon’s shadow over the Earth, as the Earth\r\nturns on its Axis. And as the Moon’s Motion is quicker or slower,\r\naccording to her different distances from the Earth, the penumbral\r\nMotion is easily regulated in the Machine by changing one of the\r\nPullies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To rectify it.]\r\n\r\n_To rectify the Machine for use._ The true time of New Moon and her\r\nLatitude being known by the foregoing Precepts § 355, 363, if her\r\nLatitude exceeds the number of minutes or divisions on the Scales (which\r\nare on the side of the frame hid from view in the Figure of the Machine)\r\nthere can be no Eclipse of the Sun at that Conjunction; but if it does\r\nnot, the Sun will be eclipsed to some places of the Earth; and, to shew\r\nthe times and various appearances of the Eclipse at those places,\r\nproceed in order as follows.\r\n\r\n_To rectify the Machine for performing by the Light of the Sun._ 1. Move\r\nthe Sliders _KK_ till their Indexes point to the Moon’s Latitude on the\r\nScales, as it is North and South Ascending or Descending, at that time.\r\n2. Turn the Month Plate _E_ till the day of the given New Moon comes to\r\nthe annual Index _G_. 3. Unscrew the Collar _N_ a little on the Axis of\r\nthe Handle, to loosen the contiguous Socket on which the threads that\r\nmove the Penumbra are wound; and set the Penumbra by Hand till its\r\nCenter comes to the perpendicular thread in the middle of the frame;\r\nwhich thread represents the Axis of the Ecliptic § 371. 4. Turn the\r\nHandle till the Meridian of _London_ on the Globe comes just under the\r\npoint of the crooked Wire _F_; then stop, and turn the Hour Circle _D_\r\nby Hand till XII at Noon comes to its Index. 5. Turn the Handle till the\r\nHour Index points to the time of New Moon in the Circle _D_; and holding\r\nit there, screw fast the Collar _N_. Lastly, elevate the Machine till\r\nthe Sun shines through the Sight-Holes in the small upright Plates _O_,\r\n_O_, on the Pedestal; and the whole Machine will be rectified.\r\n\r\n_To rectify the Machine for shewing the Candle-Light_, proceed in every\r\nrespect as above, except in that part of the last paragraph where the\r\nSun is mentioned; instead of which place a Candle before the Machine,\r\nabout four yards from it, so as the shadow of Intersection of the cross\r\nthreads in the middle of the frame may fall precisely on that part of\r\nthe Globe to which the crooked Wire _F_ points: then, with a pair of\r\nCompasses take the distance between the Penumbra’s Center and\r\nIntersection of the threads; and equal to that distance set the Candle\r\nhigher or lower as the Penumbra’s Center is above or below the said\r\nIntersection. Lastly, place a large convex Lens between the Machine and\r\nCandle, so as the Candle may be in the Focus of the Lens, and then the\r\nRays will fall parallel, and cast a strong light on the Globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It’s use.]\r\n\r\nThese things done, which may be sooner than expressed, turn the Handle\r\nbackward until the Penumbra almost touches the side _HF_ of the frame;\r\nthen turning it gradually forward, observe the following Phenomena. 1.\r\nWhere the eastern edge of the Shadow of the penumbral Plate _I_ first\r\ntouches the Globe at the solar Horizon, those who inhabit the\r\ncorresponding part of the Earth see the Eclipse begin on the uppermost\r\nedge of the Sun, just at the time of its rising. 2. In that place where\r\nthe Penumbra’s Center first touches the Globe, the inhabitants have the\r\nSun rising upon them centrally eclipsed. 3. When the whole Penumbra just\r\nfalls upon the Globe, its western edge, at the solar Horizon, touches\r\nand leaves the place where the Eclipse ends at Sun-rise on his lowermost\r\nedge. Continue turning, and, 4. the cross lines in the Center of the\r\nPenumbra will go over all those places on the Globe where the Sun is\r\ncentrally eclipsed. 5. When the eastern edge of the Shadow touches any\r\nplace of the Globe, the Eclipse begins there: when the vertical line in\r\nthe Penumbra comes to any place, then is the greatest obscuration at\r\nthat place; and when the western edge of the Penumbra leaves the place,\r\nthe Eclipse ends there; the times of all which are shewn on the Hour\r\nCircle: and from the beginning to the end, the Shadows of the concentric\r\npenumbral Circles shew the number of Digits eclipsed at all the\r\nintermediate times. 6. When the eastern edge of the Penumbra leaves the\r\nGlobe at the solar Horizon _C_, the inhabitants see the Sun beginning to\r\nbe eclipsed on his lowermost edge at its setting. 7. Where the\r\nPenumbra’s Center leaves the Globe, the inhabitants see the Sun set\r\ncentrally eclipsed. And lastly, where the Penumbra is wholly departing\r\nfrom the Globe, the inhabitants see the Eclipse ending on the uppermost\r\npart of the Sun’s edge, at the time of its disappearing in the Horizon §\r\n343.\r\n\r\n_N.B._ If any given day of the year on the Plate _E_ be set to the\r\nannual Index _G_, and the Handle turned till the Meridian of any place\r\ncomes under the point of the crooked Wire, and then the Hour Circle _D_\r\nset by the hand till XII comes to its Index; in turning the Globe round\r\nby the Handle, when the said place touches the eastern edge of the Hoop\r\nor solar Horizon _C_, the Index shews the time of Sun-setting at that\r\nplace; and when the place is just coming out from below the other edge\r\nof the Hoop _C_, the Index shews the time that the evening Twilight ends\r\nto it. When the place has gone through the dark part _A_, and comes\r\nabout so to touch under the back of the Hoop _C_ on the other side, the\r\nIndex shews the time that the Morning Twilight begins; and when the same\r\nplace is just coming out from below the edge of the Hoop next the frame,\r\nthe Index points out the time of Sun-rising. And thus, the times of\r\nSun-rising and setting are shewn at all places in one rotation of the\r\nGlobe, for any given day of the year: and the point of the crooked Wire\r\n_F_ shews all the places that the Sun passes vertically over on that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The numeral Figures refer

the two points where the pins are fixed being\r\n  called the _foci_ or focuses thereof. The Orbits of all the Planets\r\n  are elliptical, and the Sun is placed in or near to one of the _foci_\r\n  of each of them: and _that_ in which he is placed, is called the\r\n  _lower focus_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Astronomers are not far from the truth, when they reckon the Sun’s\r\n  center the lower focus of all the Planetary Orbits. Though strictly\r\n  speaking, if we consider the focus of Mercury’s Orbit to be in the\r\n  Sun’s center, the focus of Venus’s Orbit will be in the common center\r\n  of gravity of the Sun and Mercury; the focus of the Earth’s Orbit in\r\n  the common center of gravity of the Sun, Mercury, and Venus; the focus\r\n  of the Orbit of Mars in the common center of gravity of the Sun,\r\n  Mercury, Venus, and the Earth; and so of the rest. Yet, the focuses of\r\n  the Orbits of all the Planets, except Saturn, will not be sensibly\r\n  removed from the center of the Sun; nor will the focus of Saturn’s\r\n  Orbit recede sensibly from the common center of gravity of the Sun and\r\n  Jupiter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  As represented in Plate III.

But\r\n  observations prove that these areas are not in such exact proportion,\r\n  and are most varied when the greatest number of Planets are in any\r\n  particular quarter of the Heavens. When any two Planets are in\r\n  conjunction, their mutual attractions, which tend to bring them nearer\r\n  to one another, draws the inferior one a little farther from the Sun,\r\n  and the superior one a little nearer to him; by which means, the\r\n  figure of their Orbits is somewhat altered; but this alteration is too\r\n  small to be discovered in several ages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Religious Philosopher, Vol. III. page 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  This will be demonstrated in the eleventh Chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  A fine net-work membrane in the bottom of the eye.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  Book I. Art. 57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  A medium, in this sense, is any transparent body, or that through\r\n  which the rays of light can pass; as water, glass, diamond, air; and\r\n  even a vacuum is sometimes called a Medium.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  NEWTON’s _System of the World_, _p._ 120.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  This is evident from pumps, since none can draw water higher than 33\r\n  foot.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Namely 10000 times the distance of Saturn from the Sun; p. 94.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  See his Astronomy, p. 232.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  As far as one can see round him on the Earth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fig. V.]\r\n\r\n  An Angle is the inclination of two right lines, as _IH_ and _KH_,\r\n  meeting in a point at _H_; and in describing an Angle by three\r\n  letters, the middle letter always denotes the angular point: thus, the\r\n  above lines _IH_ and _KH_ meeting each other at _H_, make the Angle\r\n  _IHK_. And the point _H_ is supposed to be the center of a Circle, the\r\n  circumference of which contains 360 equal parts called degrees. A\r\n  fourth part of a Circle, called a Quadrant, as _GE_, contains 90\r\n  degrees; and every Angle is measured by the number of degrees in the\r\n  arc it cuts off; as the angle _EHP_ is 45 degrees, the Angle _EHF_ 33,\r\n  &c: and so the Angle _EHF_ is the same with the angle _CHN_, and also\r\n  with the Angle _AHM_, because they all cut off the same arc or portion\r\n  of the Quadrant _EG_; and so likewise the Angle _EHF_ is greater than\r\n  the Angle _CHD_ or _AHL_, because it cuts off a greater arc.\r\n\r\n  The nearer an object is to the eye the bigger it appears, and under\r\n  the greater Angle is it seen. To illustrate this a little, suppose an\r\n  Arrow in the position _IK_, perpendicular to the right line _HA_ drawn\r\n  from the eye at _H_ through the middle of the Arrow at _O_. It is\r\n  plain that the Arrow is seen under the Angle _IHK_, and that _HO_,\r\n  which is it’s distance from the eye, divides into halves both the\r\n  Arrow and the Angle under which it is seen: _viz._ the Arrow into\r\n  _IO_, _OK_, and the Angle into _IHO_ and _KHO_: and this will be the\r\n  case whatever distance the Arrow is placed at. Let now three Arrows,\r\n  all of the same length with _IK_, be placed at the distances _HA_,\r\n  _HC_, _HE_, still perpendicular to, and bisected by the right line\r\n  _HA_; then will _AB_, _CD_, _EF_, be each equal to, and represent\r\n  _IO_; and _AB_ (the same as _IO_) will be seen from _H_ under the\r\n  Angle _AHB_; but _CD_ (the same as _IO_) will be seen under the Angle\r\n  _CHD_ or _AHL_; and _EF_ (the same as _IO_) will be seen under the\r\n  Angle _EHF_, or _CHN_, or _AHM_. Also, _EF_ or _IO_ at the distance\r\n  _HE_ will appear as long as _CN_ would at the distance _HC_, or as\r\n  _AM_ would at the distance _HA_: and _CD_ or _IO_ at the distance _HC_\r\n  will appear as long as _AL_ would at the distance _HA_. So that as an\r\n  object approaches the eye, both it’s magnitude and the Angle under\r\n  which it is seen increase; and as the object recedes, the contrary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  The fields which are beyond the gate rise gradually till they are just\r\n  seen over it; and the arms, being red, are often mistaken for a house\r\n  at a considerable distance in those fields.\r\n\r\n  I once met with a curious deception in a gentleman’s garden at\r\n  _Hackney_, occasioned by a large pane of glass in the garden-wall at\r\n  some distance from his house. The glass (through which the fields and\r\n  sky were distinctly seen) reflected a very faint image of the house;\r\n  but the image seemed to be in the Clouds near the Horizon, and at that\r\n  distance looked as if it were a huge castle in the Air. Yet, the Angle\r\n  under which the image appeared, was equal to that under which the\r\n  house was seen: but the image being mentally referred a much greater\r\n  distance than the house, appeared much bigger to the imagination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  The Sun and Moon subtend a greater Angle on the Meridian than in the\r\n  Horizon, being nearer the Earth in the former case than the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  The Altitude of any celestial Phenomenon is an arc of the Sky\r\n  intercepted between the Horizon and the Phenomenon. In Fig. VI. of\r\n  Plate II. let _HOX_ be a horizontal line, supposed to be extended from\r\n  the eye at _A_ to _X_, where the Sky and Earth seem to meet at the end\r\n  of a long and level plain; and let _S_ be the Sun. The arc _XY_ will\r\n  be the Sun’s height above the Horizon at _X_, and is found by the\r\n  instrument _EDC_, which is a quadrantal board, or plate of metal,\r\n  divided into 90 equal parts or degrees on its limb _DPC_; and has a\r\n  couple of little brass plates, as _a_ and _b_, with a small hole in\r\n  each of them, called _Sight-Holes_, for looking through, parallel to\r\n  the edge of the Quadrant whereon they stand. To the center _E_ is\r\n  fixed one end of a thread _F_, called _the Plumb-Line_, which has a\r\n  small weight or plummet _P_ fixed to it’s other end. Now, if an\r\n  observer holds the Quadrant upright, without inclining it to either\r\n  side, and so that the Horizon at _X_ is seen through the sight-holes\r\n  _a_ and _b_, the plumb-line will cut or hang over the beginning of the\r\n  degrees at _o_, in the edge _EC_; but if he elevates the Quadrant so\r\n  as to look through the sight-holes at any part of the Heavens, suppose\r\n  to the Sun at _S_; just so many degrees as he elevates the sight-hole\r\n  _b_ above the horizontal line _HOX_, so many degrees will the\r\n  plumb-line cut in the limb _CP_ of the Quadrant. For, let the\r\n  observer’s eye at _A_ be in the center of the celestial arc _XYV_ (and\r\n  he may be said to be in the center of the Sun’s apparent diurnal\r\n  Orbit, let him be on what part of the Earth he will) in which arc the\r\n  Sun is at that time, suppose 25 degrees high, and let the observer\r\n  hold the Quadrant so that he may see the Sun through the sight-holes;\r\n  the plumb-line freely playing on the quadrant will cut the 25th degree\r\n  in the limb _CP_ equal to the number of degrees of the Sun’s Altitude\r\n  at the time of observation. _N. B._ Whoever looks at the Sun, must\r\n  have a smoaked glass before his eyes to save them from hurt. The\r\n  better way is not to look at the Sun through the sight-holes, but to\r\n  hold the Quadrant facing the eye, at a little distance, and so that\r\n  the Sun shining through one hole, the ray may be seen to fall on the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  See the Note on § 185.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Here proper allowance must be made for the Refraction, which being\r\n  about 34 minutes of a degree in the Horizon, will cause the Moon’s\r\n  center to appear 34 minutes above the Horizon when her center is\r\n  really in it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  By this is meant, that if a line be supposed to be drawn parallel to\r\n  the Earth’s Axis in any part of it’s Orbit, the Axis keeps parallel to\r\n  that line in every other part of it’s Orbit: as in Fig. I. of Plate V;\r\n  where _abcdefgh_ represents the Earth’s Orbit in an oblique view, and\r\n  _Ns_ the Earth’s Axis keeping always parallel to the line _MN_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  SMITH’s Optics, § 1197.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  All Circles appear ellipses in an oblique view, as is evident by\r\n  looking obliquely at the rim of a bason. For the true figure of a\r\n  Circle can only be seen when the eye is directly over it’s center. The\r\n  more obliquely it is viewed, the more elliptical it appears, until the\r\n  eye be in the same plane with it, and then it appears like a straight\r\n  line.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Here we must suppose the Sun to be no bigger than an ordinary point\r\n  (as ·) because he only covers a Circle half a degree in diameter in\r\n  the Heavens; whereas in the figure he hides a whole sign at once from\r\n  the Earth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Here we must suppose the Earth to be a much smaller point than that in\r\n  the preceding note marked for the Sun.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  If the Earth were cut along the Equator, quite through the center, the\r\n  flat surface of this section would be the plane of the Equator; as the\r\n  paper contained within any Circle may be justly termed the plane of\r\n  that Circle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The two opposite points in which the Ecliptic crosses the Equinoctial,\r\n  are called _the Equinoctial Points_: and the two points where the\r\n  Ecliptic touches the Tropics (which are likewise opposite, and 90\r\n  degrees from the former) are called _the Solstitial Points_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  The Equinoctial Circle intersects the Ecliptic in two opposite points,\r\n  called _Aries_ and _Libra_, from the Signs which always keep in these\r\n  points: They are called the Equinoctial Points, because when the Sun\r\n  is in either of them, he is directly over the terrestrial Equator; and\r\n  then the days and nights are equal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  In this discourse, we may consider the Orbits of all the Satellites as\r\n  circular, with respect to their primary Planets; because the\r\n  excentricities of their Orbits are too small to affect the Phenomena\r\n  here described.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  If a Globe be cut quite through upon any Circle, the flat surface\r\n  where it is so divided, is the plane of that circle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  The Figure shews the Globe as if only elevated about 40 degrees, which\r\n  was occasioned by an oversight in the drawing: but it is still\r\n  sufficient to explain the Phenomena.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  The Ecliptic, together with the fixed Stars, make 366-1/4 apparent\r\n  diurnal revolutions about the Earth in a year; the Sun only 365-1/4.\r\n  Therefore the Stars gain 3 minutes 56 seconds upon the Sun every day:\r\n  so that a Sidereal day contains only 23 hours 56 minutes of mean Solar\r\n  time; and a natural or Solar day 24 hours. Hence 12 Sidereal hours are\r\n  1 minute 58 seconds shorter than 12 Solar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  The Sun advances almost a degree in the Ecliptic in 24 hours, the same\r\n  way that the Moon moves: and therefore, the Moon by advancing 13-1/6\r\n  degrees in that time goes little more than 12 degrees farther from the\r\n  Sun than she was on the day before.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  This center is as much nearer the Earth’s center than the Moon’s as\r\n  the Earth is heavier, or contains a greater quantity of matter than\r\n  the Moon, namely about 40 times. If both bodies were suspended on it\r\n  they would hang in _æquilibria_. So that dividing 240,000 miles, the\r\n  Moon’s distance from the Earth’s center, by 40 the excess of the\r\n  Earth’s weight above the Moon’s, the quotient will be 6000 miles,\r\n  which is the distance of the common center of gravity of the Earth and\r\n  Moon from the Earth’s center.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  The Penumbra is a faint kind of shadow all around the perfect shadow\r\n  of the Planet or Satellite; and will be more fully explained by and\r\n  by.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Which is the time that the Eclipse would be at the greatest\r\n  obscuration, if the motions of the Sun and Moon were equable, or the\r\n  same in all parts of their Orbits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  The above period of 18 years 11 days 7 hours 43 minutes, which was\r\n  found out by the _Chaldeans_, and by them called _Saros_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  A Digit is a twelfth part of the diameter of the Sun or Moon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  There are two antient Eclipses of the Moon, recorded by _Ptolemy_ from\r\n  _Hipparchus_, which afford an undeniable proof of the Moon’s\r\n  acceleration. The first of these was observed at _Babylon_, _December_\r\n  the 22d, in the year before CHRIST 383: when the Moon began to be\r\n  eclipsed about half an hour before the Sun rose, and the Eclipse was\r\n  not over before the Moon set: but by our best Astronomical Tables, the\r\n  Moon was set at _Babylon_ half an hour before the Eclipse began; in\r\n  which case, there could have been no possibility of observing it. The\r\n  second Eclipse was observed at _Alexandria_, _September_ the 22d, the\r\n  year before CHRIST 201; where the Moon rose so much eclipsed, that the\r\n  Eclipse must have begun about half an hour before she rose: whereas by\r\n  our Tables the beginning of this Eclipse was not till about 10 minutes\r\n  after the Moon rose at _Alexandria_. Had these Eclipses begun and\r\n  ended while the Sun was below the Horizon, we might have imagined,\r\n  that as the antients had no certain way of measuring time, they might\r\n  have been so far mistaken in the hours, that we could not have laid\r\n  any stress on the accounts given by them. But, as in the first Eclipse\r\n  the Moon was set, and consequently the Sun risen, before it was over;\r\n  and in the second Eclipse the Sun was set, and the Moon not risen,\r\n  till some time after it began; these are such circumstances as the\r\n  observers could not possibly be mistaken in. Mr. _Struyk_ in the\r\n  following Catalogue, notwithstanding the express words of _Ptolemy_,\r\n  puts down these two Eclipses as observed at _Athens_; where they might\r\n  have been seen as above, without any acceleration of the Moon’s\r\n  motion: _Athens_ being 20 degrees West of _Babylon_, and 7 degrees\r\n  West of _Alexandria_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Each _Olympiad_ began at the time of Full Moon next after the Summer\r\n  Solstice, and lasted four years, which were of unequal lengths because\r\n  the time of Full Moon differs 11 days every year: so that they might\r\n  sometimes begin on the next day after the Solstice, and at other times\r\n  not till four weeks after it. The first _Olympiad_ began in the year\r\n  of the Julian Period 3938, which was 776 years before the first year\r\n  of CHRIST, or 775 before the year of his birth; and the last\r\n  _Olympiad_, which was the 293d, began _A. D._ 393. At the expiration\r\n  of each _Olympiad_, the _Olympic Games_ were celebrated in the _Elean_\r\n  fields, near the river _Alpheus_ in the _Peloponnesus_ (now _Morea_)\r\n  in honour of JUPITER OLYMPUS. See STRAUCHIUS’_s_ _Breviarium\r\n  Chronologium_, p. 247-251.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The reader may probably find it difficult to understand why Mr. SMITH\r\n  should reckon this Eclipse to have been in the 4th year of the 48th\r\n  _Olympiad_; as it was only in the end of the third year: and also why\r\n  the 28th of _May_, in the 585th year before CHRIST should answer to\r\n  the present 10th of that month. But we hope the following explanation\r\n  will remove these difficulties.\r\n\r\n  The month of _May_ (when the Sun was eclipsed) in the 585th year\r\n  before the first year of CHRIST, which was a leap-year, fell in the\r\n  latter end of the third year of the 48th _Olympiad_; and the fourth\r\n  year of that _Olympiad_ began at the Summer Solstice following: but\r\n  perhaps Mr. SMITH begins the years of the _Olympiad_ from _January_,\r\n  in order to make them correspond more readily with _Julian_ years; and\r\n  so reckons the month of _May_, when the Eclipse happened, to be in the\r\n  fourth year of that _Olympiad_.\r\n\r\n  The Place or Longitude of the Sun at that time was ♉ 29° 43ʹ 17ʺ, to\r\n  which same place the Sun returned (after 2300 years, _viz._) _A. D._\r\n  1716, on _May_, 9^d. 5^h. 6^m. after noon: so that, with respect to\r\n  the Sun’s place, the 9th of _May_, 1716 answers to the 28th of _May_\r\n  in the 585th year before the first year of CHRIST; that is, the Sun\r\n  had the same Longitude on both those days.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Before CHRIST 413, _August 27_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  Before CHRIST 168, _June 20_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  STRUYK’s Eclipses are to the _Old Style_, all the rest to the _New_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  This Eclipse happened in the first year of the _Peloponnesian_ war.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Although the Sun and Moon are spherical bodies, as seen from the Earth\r\n  they appear to be circular planes, and so would the Earth if it were\r\n  seen from the Moon. The apparently flat surfaces of the Sun and Moon\r\n  are called their _Disks_ by Astronomers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  A Digit is a twelfth part of the diameter of the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  This is the same with _the annual Argument of the Moon_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  When the _Romans_ divided the Empire, which was about 38 years before\r\n  CHRIST, _Spain_ fell to _Augustus_’s share: in memory of which, the\r\n  _Spaniards_ dated all their memorable events _ab exordio Regni\r\n  Augusti_; as Christians do from the birth of our SAVIOUR. But in\r\n  process of time, only the initial letters _AERA_ of these words were\r\n  used instead of the words themselves. And thus, according to some,\r\n  came the word _ÆRA_, which is made use of to signify a point of time\r\n  from whence historians begin to reckon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  When the Sun’s Anomaly is 0 signs 0 degrees, or 6 signs 0 degrees,\r\n  neither the Sun nor the Moon’s Anomaly have any Equation; which is the\r\n  case in this Example.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  See the Remark, p. 195.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  _Babylon_ is 42 deg. 46 min. east from the Meridian of _London_, which\r\n  is equal to 2 hours 51 min. of time nearly. See § 220.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  Our SAVIOUR was born in a leap-year, and therefore every fourth year\r\n  both before and after is a leap-year in the _Old Stile_: but the\r\n  Tables begin with the year _next after_ that of his birth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  When only one of the Nodes is mentioned, it is the Ascending Node that\r\n  is meant, to which the Descending Node is exactly opposite.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  When the Moon is North of the Ecliptic and going farther from it, her\r\n  Latitude or Declination from the Ecliptic is called _North Ascending_:\r\n  when she is North of the Ecliptic and going toward it, her Latitude is\r\n  _North Descending_: when she is South of the Ecliptic and going\r\n  farther from it, her Latitude is _South Descending_: and lastly, when\r\n  she is South of the Ecliptic and going toward it, her Latitude is\r\n  _South Ascending_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  See Page 193, Example II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  M. _Maupertuis_, in his dissertation on the figures of the Celestial\r\n  Bodies (p. 61-63) is of opinion that some Stars, by their prodigious\r\n  quick rotations on their Axes, may not only assume the figures of\r\n  oblate spheroids, but that by the great centrifugal force, arising\r\n  from such rotations, they may become of the figures of mill-stones; or\r\n  be reduced to flat circular planes, so thin as to be quite invisible\r\n  when their edges are turned towards us; as Saturn’s Ring is in such\r\n  positions. But when very excentric Planets or Comets go round any flat\r\n  Star, in Orbits much inclined to it’s Equator, the attraction of the\r\n  Planets or Comets in their perihelions must alter the inclination of\r\n  the Star; on which account it will appear more or less large and\r\n  luminous as it’s broad side is more or less turned towards us. And\r\n  thus he imagines we may account for the apparent changes of magnitude\r\n  and lustre in those Stars, and likewise for their appearing and\r\n  disappearing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  See this word explained in the note at the foot of page 194.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  See the note on § 323.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  _Matt._ xxvii. 45. _Mark_ xv. 43. _Luke_ xxiii. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book uses inconsistent spelling and hyphenation, which were\r\nretained in the ebook version.
