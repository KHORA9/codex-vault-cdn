Comparative\r\nstudies have contributed all the evidence hitherto adduced for the\r\nsupport of the Darwinian theory of descent and given us some general\r\nideas about the main lines of the pedigree of the vegetable kingdom, but\r\nthe way in which one species originates from another has not been\r\nadequately explained. The current belief assumes that species are slowly\r\nchanged into new types. In contradiction to this conception the theory\r\nof mutation assumes that new species and varieties are produced from\r\nexisting forms by sudden leaps. The parent-type itself remains unchanged\r\nthroughout this process, and may repeatedly give birth to new forms.\r\nThese may arise simultaneously and in groups or separately at more or\r\nless widely distant periods.\r\n\r\nThe principal features of the theory of mutation have been dealt with at\r\nlength in my book \"Die Mutationstheorie\" (Vol. I., 1901, Vol. II., 1903.\r\nLeipsic, Veit & Co.), in which I have endeavored to present as\r\ncompletely as possible the detailed evidence obtained from trustworthy\r\nhistorical records, and from my own experimental researches, upon which\r\nthe theory is based.\r\n\r\nThe University of California invited me to deliver a series of lectures\r\non this subject, at Berkeley, during the [vii] summer of 1904, and these\r\nlectures are offered in this form to a public now thoroughly interested\r\nin the progress of modern ideas on evolution. Some of my experiments and\r\npedigree-cultures are described here in a manner similar to that used in\r\nthe \"Mutationstheorie,\" but partly abridged and partly elaborated, in\r\norder to give a clear conception of their extent and scope. New\r\nexperiments and observations have been added, and a wider choice of the\r\nmaterial afforded by the more recent current literature has been made in\r\nthe interest of a clear representation of the leading ideas, leaving the\r\nexact and detailed proofs thereof to the students of the larger book.\r\n\r\nScientific demonstration is often long and encumbered with difficult\r\npoints of minor importance. In these lectures I have tried to devote\r\nattention to the more important phases of the subject and have avoided\r\nthe details of lesser interest to the general reader.\r\n\r\nConsiderable care has been bestowed upon the indication of the lacunae\r\nin our knowledge of the subject and the methods by which they may be\r\nfilled. Many interesting observations bearing upon the little known\r\nparts of the subject may be made with limited facilities, either in the\r\ngarden or upon the wild flora. Accuracy and perseverance, and a warm\r\nlove for Nature's children are here the chief requirements in such\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nIn his admirable treatise on Evolution and Adaptation (New York,\r\nMacmillan & Co., 1903), Thomas Hunt Morgan has dealt in a critical\r\nmanner with many of the speculations upon problems subsidiary to the\r\ntheory of descent, in so convincing and complete a manner, that I think\r\nmyself justified in neglecting these questions here. His book gives an\r\naccurate survey of them all, and is easily understood by the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nIn concluding I have to offer my thanks to Dr. D.T. MacDougal and Miss\r\nA.M. Vail of the New York Botanical Garden for their painstaking work in\r\nthe preparation of the manuscript for the press. Dr. MacDougal, by\r\n[viii] his publications, has introduced my results to his American\r\ncolleagues, and moreover by his cultures of the mutative species of the\r\ngreat evening-primrose has contributed additional proof of the validity\r\nof my views, which will go far to obviate the difficulties, which are\r\nstill in the way of a more universal acceptation of the theory of\r\nmutation. My work claims to be in full accord with the principles laid\r\ndown by Darwin, and to give a thorough and sharp analysis of some of the\r\nideas of variability, inheritance, selection, and mutation, which were\r\nnecessarily vague at his time. It is only just to state, that Darwin\r\nestablished so broad a basis for scientific research upon these\r\nsubjects, that after half a century many problems of major interest\r\nremain to be taken up. The work now demanding our attention is\r\nmanifestly that of the experimental observation and control of the\r\norigin of species. The principal object of these lectures is to secure a\r\nmore general appreciation of this kind of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGO DE VRIES.\r\nAmsterdam, October, 1904.\r\n\r\n[ix]\r\n\r\nPREFACE BY THE EDITOR\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR DE VRIES has rendered an additional service to all naturalists\r\nby the preparation of the lectures on mutation published in the present\r\nvolume. A perusal of the lectures will show that the subject matter of\r\n\"Die Mutationstheorie\" has been presented in a somewhat condensed form,\r\nand that the time which has elapsed since the original was prepared has\r\ngiven opportunity for the acquisition of additional facts, and a\r\nre-examination of some of the more important conclusions with the result\r\nthat a notable gain has been made in the treatment of some complicated\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the appearance of this English version of the theory of\r\nmutation will do much to stimulate investigation of the various phases\r\nof the subject. This volume, however, is by no means intended to\r\nreplace, as a work of reference, the larger book with its detailed\r\nrecital of facts and its comprehensive records, but it may prove a\r\nsubstitute for the use of the general reader.\r\n\r\nThe revision of the lectures has been a task attended with no little\r\npleasure, especially since it has given the editor the opportunity for\r\nan advance consideration of some of the more recent results, thus\r\nmaterially facilitating investigations which have been in progress at\r\nthe New York Botanical Garden for some time. So far as the ground has\r\nbeen covered the researches in question corroborate the conclusions of\r\nde Vries in all important particulars. The preparation of the manuscript\r\nfor the printer has consisted chiefly in the adaptation of oral [xii]\r\ndiscussions and demonstrations to a form suitable for permanent record,\r\ntogether with certain other alterations which have been duly submitted\r\nto the author. The original phraseology has been preserved as far as\r\npossible. The editor wishes to acknowledge material assistance in this\r\nwork from Miss A.M. Vail, Librarian of the New York Botanical Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.T. MacDougal.\r\nNew York Botanical Garden, October, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nTHE constantly increasing interest in all phases of evolution has made\r\nnecessary the preparation of a second edition of this book within a few\r\nmonths after the first appeared. The opportunity has been used to\r\neliminate typographical errors, and to make alterations in the form of a\r\nfew sentences for the sake of clearness and smoothness. The subject\r\nmatter remains practically unchanged. An explanatory note has been added\r\non page 575 in order to avoid confusion as to the identity of some of\r\nthe plants which figure prominently in the experimental investigations\r\nin Amsterdam and New York.\r\n\r\nThe portrait which forms the frontispiece is a reproduction of a\r\nphotograph taken by Professor F.E. Lloyd and Dr. W.A. Cannon during the\r\nvisit of Professor de Vries at the Desert Botanical Laboratory of the\r\nCarnegie Institution, at Tucson, Arizona, in June, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. T.

INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nLECTURE I\r\n\r\nDESCENT: THEORIES OF EVOLUTION\r\nAND METHODS OF INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nNewton convinced his contemporaries that natural laws rule the whole\r\nuniverse. Lyell showed, by his principle of slow and gradual evolution,\r\nthat natural laws have reigned since the beginning of time. To Darwin we\r\nowe the almost universal acceptance of the theory of descent.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is one of the most noted landmarks in the advance of\r\nscience. It teaches the validity of natural laws of life in its broadest\r\nsense, and crowns the philosophy founded by Newton and Lyell.\r\n\r\nLamarck proposed the hypothesis of a common origin of all living beings\r\nand this ingenious and thoroughly philosophical conception was warmly\r\nwelcomed by his partisans, but was not widely accepted owing to lack of\r\nsupporting evidence. To Darwin was reserved the task of [2] bringing the\r\ntheory of common descent to its present high rank in scientific and\r\nsocial philosophy.\r\n\r\nTwo main features in his work have contributed to this early and\r\nunexpected victory. One of them is the almost unlimited amount of\r\ncomparative evidence, the other is his demonstration of the possibility\r\nof a physiological explanation of the process of descent itself.\r\n\r\nThe universal belief in the independent creation of living organisms was\r\nrevised by Linnaeus and was put upon a new foundation. Before him the\r\ngenera were supposed to be created, the species and minor forms having\r\narisen from them through the agency of external conditions. In his first\r\nbook Linnaeus adhered to this belief, but later changed his mind and\r\nmaintained the principle of the separate creation of species. The weight\r\nof his authority soon brought this conception to universal acceptance,\r\nand up to the present time the prevailing conception of a species has\r\nbeen chiefly based on the definition given by Linnaeus. His species\r\ncomprised subspecies and varieties, which were in their turn, supposed\r\nto have evolved from species by the common method.\r\n\r\nDarwin tried to show that the links which bind species to genera are of\r\nthe same nature as those which determine the relationship of [3]\r\nsubspecies and varieties. If an origin by natural laws is conceded for\r\nthe latter, it must on this ground be granted for the first also. In\r\nthis discussion he simply returned to the pre-Linnean attitude. But his\r\nmaterial was such as to allow him to go one step further, and this step\r\nwas an important and decisive one. He showed that the relation between\r\nthe various genera of a family does not exhibit any features of a nature\r\nother than that between the species of a genus. What has been conceded\r\nfor the one must needs be accepted for the other. The same holds good\r\nfor the large groups.\r\n\r\nThe conviction of the common origin of closely allied forms necessarily\r\nleads to the conception of a similar descent even in remote\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nThe origin of subspecies and varieties as found in nature was not\r\nproved, but only generally recognized as evident. A broader knowledge\r\nhas brought about the same state of opinion for greater groups of\r\nrelationships. Systematic affinities find their one possible explanation\r\nby the aid of this principle; without it, all similarity is only\r\napparent and accidental. Geographic and paleontologic facts, brought\r\ntogether by Darwin and others on a previously unequalled scale, point\r\nclearly in the same direction. The vast amount of evidence of all [4]\r\ncomparative sciences compels us to accept the idea. To deny it, is to\r\ngive up all opportunity of conceiving Nature in her true form.\r\n\r\nThe general features of the theory of descent are now accepted as the\r\nbasis of all biological science. Half a century of discussion and\r\ninvestigation has cleared up the minor points and brought out an\r\nabundance of facts; but they have not changed the principle. Descent\r\nwith modification is now universally accepted as the chief law of nature\r\nin the organic world. In honor of him, who with unsurpassed genius, and\r\nby unlimited labor has made it the basis of modern thought, this law is\r\ncalled the \"Darwinian theory of descent.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin's second contribution to this attainment was his proof of the\r\npossibility of a physiological explanation of the process of descent\r\nitself. Of this possibility he fully convinced his contemporaries, but\r\nin indicating the particular means by which the change of species has\r\nbeen brought about, he has not succeeded in securing universal\r\nacceptation. Quite on the contrary, objections have been raised from the\r\nvery outset, and with such force as to compel Darwin himself to change\r\nhis views in his later writings. This however, was of no avail, and\r\nobjections and criticisms have since steadily accumulated. Physiologic\r\nfacts concerning the origin of [5] species in nature were unknown in the\r\ntime of Darwin. It was a happy idea to choose the experience of the\r\nbreeders in the production of new varieties, as a basis on which to\r\nbuild an explanation of the processes of nature. In my opinion Darwin\r\nwas quite right, and he has succeeded in giving the desired proof. But\r\nthe basis was a frail one, and would not stand too close an examination.\r\nOf this Darwin was always well aware. He has been prudent to the utmost,\r\nleaving many points undecided, and among them especially the range of\r\nvalidity of his several arguments. Unfortunately this prudence has not\r\nbeen adopted by his followers. Without sufficient warrant they have laid\r\nstress on one phase of the problem, quite overlooking the others.\r\nWallace has even gone so far in his zeal and ardent veneration for\r\nDarwin, as to describe as Darwinism some things, which in my opinion,\r\nhad never been a part of Darwin's conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the breeders was quite inadequate to the use which\r\nDarwin made of it. It was neither scientific, nor critically accurate.\r\nLaws of variation were barely conjectured; the different types of\r\nvariability were only imperfectly distinguished. The breeders'\r\nconception was fairly sufficient for practical purposes, but science\r\nneeded a clear understanding of the [6] factors in the general process\r\nof variation. Repeatedly Darwin tried to formulate these causes, but the\r\nevidence available did not meet his requirements.\r\n\r\nQuetelet's law of variation had not yet been published. Mendel's claim\r\nof hereditary units for the explanation of certain laws of hybrids\r\ndiscovered by him, was not yet made. The clear distinction between\r\nspontaneous and sudden changes, as compared with the ever-present\r\nfluctuating variations, is only of late coming into recognition by\r\nagriculturists. Innumerable minor points which go to elucidate the\r\nbreeders' experience, and with which we are now quite familiar, were\r\nunknown in Darwin's time. No wonder that he made mistakes, and laid\r\nstress on modes of descent, which have since been proved to be of minor\r\nimportance or even of doubtful validity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these apparently unsurmountable difficulties, Darwin\r\ndiscovered the great principle which rules the evolution of organisms.\r\nIt is the principle of natural selection. It is the sifting out of all\r\norganisms of minor worth through the struggle for life. It is only a\r\nsieve, and not a force of nature, not a direct cause of improvement, as\r\nmany of Darwin's adversaries, and unfortunately many of his followers\r\nalso, have so often asserted.\r\n\r\nIt is [7] only a sieve, which decides what is to live, and what is to\r\ndie. But evolutionary lines are of great length, and the evolution of a\r\nflower, or of an insectivorous plant is a way with many sidepaths. It is\r\nthe sieve that keeps evolution on the main line, killing all, or nearly\r\nall that try to go in other directions. By this means natural selection\r\nis the one directing cause of the broad lines of evolution.\r\n\r\nOf course, with the single steps of evolution it has nothing to do. Only\r\nafter the step has been taken, the sieve acts, eliminating the unfit.\r\nThe problem, as to the manner in which the individual steps are brought\r\nabout, is quite another side of the question.\r\n\r\nOn this point Darwin has recognized two possibilities. One means of\r\nchange lies in the sudden and spontaneous production of new forms from\r\nthe old stock. The other method is the gradual accumulation of those\r\nalways present and ever fluctuating variations which are indicated by\r\nthe common assertion that no two individuals of a given race are exactly\r\nalike. The first changes are what we now call \"mutations,\" the second\r\nare designated as \"individual variations,\" or as this term is often used\r\nin another sense, as \"fluctuations.\" Darwin recognized both lines of\r\nevolution; Wallace disregarded the sudden changes and proposed\r\nfluctuations [8] as the exclusive factor. Of late, however, this point\r\nof view has been abandoned by many investigators, especially in America.\r\n\r\nThe actual occurrence of mutations is recognized, and the battle rages\r\nabout the question, as to whether they are be regarded as the principal\r\nmeans of evolution, or whether slow and gradual changes have not also\r\nplayed a large and important part.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of the theory of evolution by slow accumulation of slight\r\nfluctuations are divided into two camps. One group is called the\r\nNeo-Lamarckians; they assume a direct modifying agency of the\r\nenvironment, producing a corresponding and useful change in the\r\norganization. The other group call themselves Darwinians or\r\nselectionists, but to my mind with no other right beyond the arbitrary\r\nrestriction of the Darwinian principles by Wallace. They assume\r\nfluctuating variations in all directions and leave the choice between\r\nthem to the sieve of natural selection.\r\n\r\nOf course we are far from a decision between these views, on the sole\r\nground of the facts as known at present. Mutations under observation are\r\nas yet very rare; enough to indicate the possible and most probable\r\nways, but no more. On the other hand the accumulation of fluctuations\r\ndoes not transgress relatively narrow [9] limits as far as the present\r\nmethods of selection go. But the question remains to be solved, whether\r\nour methods are truly the right ones, and whether by the use of new\r\nprinciples, new results might not cause the balance of opinion to favor\r\nthe opposite side.\r\n\r\nOf late, a thorough and detailed discussion of the opposing views has\r\nbeen given by Morgan in his valuable book on evolution and adaptation.\r\nHe has subjected all the proposed theories to a severe criticism both on\r\nthe ground of facts and on that of their innate possibility and logical\r\nvalue. He decides in favor of the mutation theory. His arguments are\r\nincisive and complete and wholly adapted to the comprehension of all\r\nintelligent readers, so that his book relieves me entirely of the\r\nnecessity of discussing these general questions, as it could not be done\r\nin a better or in a clearer way.\r\n\r\nI intend to give a review of the facts obtained from plants which go to\r\nprove the assertion, that species and varieties have originated by\r\nmutation, and are, at present, not known to originate in any other way.\r\nThis review consists of two parts. One is a critical survey of the facts\r\nof agricultural and horticultural breeding, as they have accumulated\r\nsince the time of Darwin. This body of evidence is to be combined with\r\nsome corresponding experiments [10] concerning the real nature of\r\nspecies in the wild state. The other part rests on my own observations\r\nand experiments, made in the botanical garden of the University of\r\nAmsterdam.\r\n\r\nFor many years past I have tried to elucidate the hereditary conditions\r\nof species and varieties, and the occasional occurrence of mutations,\r\nthat suddenly produce new forms.\r\n\r\nThe present discussion has a double purpose. On one side it will give\r\nthe justification of the theory of mutations, as derived from the facts\r\nnow at hand. On the other hand it will point out the deficiencies of\r\navailable evidence, and indicate the ways by which the lacunae may\r\ngradually be filled. Experimental work on heredity does not require vast\r\ninstallments or costly laboratory equipment. It demands chiefly\r\nassiduity and exactitude. Any one who has these two qualities, and who\r\nhas a small garden at his disposal is requested to take part in this\r\nline of investigation.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe directly the birth of new forms it is necessary, in\r\nthe first place, to be fully clear concerning the question as to what\r\nforms are to be expected to arise from others, and before proceeding to\r\na demonstration of the origin of species, it is pertinent to raise the\r\nquestion as to what constitutes a species.\r\n\r\nSpecies is a word, which always has had a [11] double meaning. One is\r\nthe systematic species, which is the unit of our system. But these units\r\nare by no means indivisible. Long ago Linnaeus knew them to be compound\r\nin a great number of instances, and increasing knowledge has shown that\r\nthe same rule prevails in other instances. Today the vast majority of\r\nthe old systematic species are known to consist of minor units. These\r\nminor entities are called varieties in systematic works. However, there\r\nare many objections to this usage. First, the term variety is applied in\r\nhorticulture and agriculture to things so widely divergent as to convey\r\nno clear idea at all. Secondly, the subdivisions of species are by no\r\nmeans all of the same nature, and the systematic varieties include units\r\nthe real value of which is widely different in different cases. Some of\r\nthese varieties are in reality as good as species, and have been\r\n\"elevated,\" as it is called by some writers, to this rank. This\r\nconception of the elementary species would be quite justifiable, and\r\nwould at once get rid of all difficulties, were it not for one practical\r\nobstacle. The number of the species in all genera would be doubled and\r\ntripled, and as these numbers are already cumbersome in many cases, the\r\ndistinction of the native species of any given country would lose most\r\nof its charm and interest.\r\n\r\n[12] In order to meet this difficulty we must recognize two sorts of\r\nspecies. The systematic species are the practical units of the\r\nsystematists and florists, and all friends of wild nature should do\r\ntheir utmost to preserve them as Linnaeus has proposed them. These units\r\nhowever, are not really existing entities; they have as little claim to\r\nbe regarded as such as genera and families. The real units are the\r\nelementary species; their limits often apparently overlap and can only\r\nin rare cases be determined on the sole ground of field observations.\r\nPedigree-culture is the method required and any form which remains\r\nconstant and distinct from its allies in the garden is to be considered\r\nas an elementary species.\r\n\r\nIn the following lectures we shall consider this point at length, to\r\nshow the compound nature of systematic species in wild and in cultivated\r\nplants. In both cases, the principle is becoming of great importance,\r\nand many papers published recently indicate its almost universal\r\nacceptation.\r\n\r\nAmong the systematic subdivisions of species, not all have the same\r\nclaim to the title of elementary species. In the first place the cases\r\nin which the differences may occur between parts of the same individual\r\nare to be excluded. Dividing an alpine plant into two halves and [13]\r\nplanting one in a garden, varietal differences at once arise and are\r\noften designated in systematic works under different varietal names.\r\nSecondly all individual differences which are of a fluctuating nature\r\nare to be combined into a group. But with these we shall deal later.\r\n\r\nApart from these minor points the subdivisions of the systematic species\r\nexhibit two widely different features. I will now try to make this clear\r\nin a few words, but will return in another lecture to a fuller\r\ndiscussion of this most interesting contrast.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus himself knew that in some cases all subdivisions of a species\r\nare of equal rank, together constituting the group called species. No\r\none of them outranks the others; it is not a species with varieties, but\r\na group, consisting only of varieties. A closer inquiry into the cases\r\ntreated in this manner by the great master of systematic science, shows\r\nthat here his varieties were exactly what we now call elementary\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the varieties are of a derivative nature. The species\r\nconstitutes a type that is pure in a race which ordinarily is still\r\ngrowing somewhere, though in some cases it may have died out. From this\r\ntype the varieties are derived, and the way of this derivation is\r\nusually quite manifest to the botanist. It is ordinarily [14] by the\r\ndisappearance of some superficial character that a variety is\r\ndistinguished from its species, as by the lack of color in the flowers,\r\nof hairs on stems and foliage, of the spines and thorns, &c. Such\r\nvarieties are, strictly speaking, not to be treated in the same way as\r\nelementary species, though they often are. We shall designate them by\r\nthe term of \"retrograde varieties,\" which clearly indicates the nature\r\nof their relationship to the species from which they are assumed to have\r\nsprung. In order to lay more stress on the contrast between elementary\r\nspecies and retrograde varieties, it should be stated at once, that the\r\nfirst are considered to have originated from their parent-form in a\r\nprogressive way. They have succeeded in attaining something quite new\r\nfor themselves, while retrograde varieties have only thrown off some\r\npeculiarity, previously acquired by their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe whole vegetable kingdom exhibits a constant struggle between\r\nprogression and retrogression. Of course, the great lines of the general\r\npedigree are due to progression, many single steps in this direction\r\nleading together to the great superiority of the flowering plants over\r\ntheir cryptogamous ancestors. But progression is nearly always\r\naccompanied by retrogression in the principal lines of evolution, [15]\r\nas well as in the collateral branches of the genealogical tree.\r\nSometimes it prevails, and the monocotyledons are obviously a reduced\r\nbranch of the primitive dicotyledons. In orchids and aroids, in grasses\r\nand sedges, reduction plays a most important part, leaving its traces on\r\nthe flowers as well as on the embryo of the seed. Many instances could\r\nbe given to prove that progression and retrogression are the two main\r\nprinciples of evolution at large. Hence the conclusion, that our\r\nanalysis must dissect the complicated phenomena of evolution so far as\r\nto show the separate functions of these two contrasting principles.\r\nHundreds of steps were needed to evolve the family of the orchids, but\r\nthe experimenter must take the single steps for the object of his\r\ninquiry. He finds that some are progressive and others retrogressive and\r\nso his investigation falls under two heads, the origin of progressive\r\ncharacters, and the subsequent loss of the same. Progressive steps are\r\nthe marks of elementary species, while retrograde varieties are\r\ndistinguished by apparent losses. They have equal claim to our interest\r\nand our study.\r\n\r\nAs already stated I propose to deal first with the elementary species\r\nand afterwards with the retrograde varieties. I shall try to depict them\r\nto you in the first place as they are seen in [16] nature and in\r\nculture, leaving the question of their origin to a subsequent\r\nexperimental treatment.\r\n\r\nThe question of the experimental origin of new species and varieties has\r\nto be taken up from two widely separated starting points. This may be\r\ninferred from what we have already seen concerning the two opposing\r\ntheories, derived and isolated from Darwin's original broad conception.\r\nOne of them considers mutations as the origin of new forms, while the\r\nother assumes fluctuations to be the source of all evolution.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, my own experience has led me to accept the first\r\nview. Therefore I shall have to show that mutations do yield new and\r\nconstant forms, while fluctuations are not adequate to do so. Retrograde\r\nvarieties and elementary species may both be seen to be produced by\r\nsudden mutations. Varieties have often been observed to appear at once\r\nand quite unexpectedly in horticulture and agriculture, and a survey of\r\nthese historical facts will be the subject of one of my lectures. In\r\nsome instances I have succeeded in repeating these observations in my\r\ngarden under the strict conditions of a scientific experiment, and these\r\ninstances teach us the real nature of the process of mutation in all its\r\nvisible features. New elementary [17] species are far more rare, but I\r\nhave discovered in the great evening-primrose, or _Oenothera\r\nlamarckiana_ a strain which is producing them yearly in the wild state\r\nas well as in my garden. These observations and pedigree-experiments\r\nwill be dealt with at due length in subsequent lectures.\r\n\r\nHaving proved the existence and importance of mutations, it remains to\r\ninquire how far the improvements may go which are due only to\r\nfluctuating variability. As the term indicates, this variability is\r\nfluctuating to and fro, oscillating around an average type. It never\r\nfails nor does it, under ordinary circumstances, depart far from the\r\nfixed average.\r\n\r\nBut the deviation may be enlarged by a choice of extremes. In sowing\r\ntheir seed, the average of the strain is seen to be changed, and in\r\nrepeating the experiment the change may be considerable. It is not\r\nclear, whether theoretically by such an accumulation, deviations might\r\nbe reached which could not be attained at once in a single sowing. This\r\nquestion is hardly susceptible of an experimental answer, as it would\r\nrequire such an enormous amount of seed from a few mother plants as can\r\nscarcely ever be produced.\r\n\r\nThe whole character of the fluctuations shows them to be of an opposite\r\nnature, contrasting [18] manifestly with specific and varietal\r\ncharacters. By this method they may be proved to be inadequate ever to\r\nmake a single step along the great lines of evolution, in regard to\r\nprogressive as well as to retrograde development.\r\n\r\nFirst of all fluctuations are linear, amplifying or lessening the\r\nexisting qualities, but not really changing their nature. They are not\r\nobserved to produce anything quite new, and evolution of course, is not\r\nrestricted to the increase of the already existing peculiarities, but\r\ndepends chiefly on the continuous addition of new characters to the\r\nstock. Fluctuations always oscillate around an average, and if removed\r\nfrom this for some time, they show a tendency to return to it. This\r\ntendency, called retrogression, has never been observed to fail, as it\r\nshould, in order to free the new strain from the links with the average,\r\nwhile new species and new varieties are seen to be quite free from their\r\nancestors and not linked to them by intermediates.\r\n\r\nThe last few lectures will be devoted to questions concerning the great\r\nproblem of the analogy between natural and artificial selection. As\r\nalready stated, Darwin made this analogy the foundation stone of his\r\ntheory of descent, and he met with the severest objections and\r\ncriticisms precisely on this point. But I hope to [19] show that he was\r\nquite right, and that the cause of the divergence of opinions is due\r\nsimply to the very incomplete state of knowledge concerning both\r\nprocesses. If both are critically analyzed they may be seen to comprise\r\nthe same factors, and further discussion may be limited to the\r\nappreciation of the part which each of them has played in nature and\r\namong cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nBoth natural and artificial selection are partly specific, and partly\r\nintra-specific or individual. Nature of course, and intelligent men\r\nfirst chose the best elementary species from among the swarms. In\r\ncultivation this is the process of variety-testing. In nature it is the\r\nsurvival of the fittest species, or, as Morgan designates it, the\r\nsurvival of species in the struggle for existence. The species are not\r\nchanged by this struggle, they are only weighed against each other, the\r\nweak being thrown aside.\r\n\r\nWithin the chosen elementary species there is also a struggle. It is\r\nobvious, that the fluctuating variability adapts some to the given\r\ncircumstances, while it lessens the chances of others. A choice results,\r\nand this choice is what is often exclusively called selection, either\r\nnatural or artificial. In cultivation it produces the improved and the\r\nlocal races; in nature little is known about improvement in this way,\r\nbut [19] local adaptations with slight changes of the average character\r\nin separate localities, seem to be of quite normal occurrence.\r\n\r\nA new method of individual selection has been used in recent years in\r\nAmerica, especially by W.M. Hays. It consists in judging the hereditary\r\nworth of a plant by the average condition of its offspring, instead of\r\nby its own visible characters. If this determination of the \"centgener\r\npower,\" as Hays calls it, should prove to be the true principle of\r\nselection, then indeed the analogy between natural and artificial\r\nselection would lose a large part of its importance. We will reserve\r\nthis question for the last lecture, as it pertains more to the future,\r\nthan to our present stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nSomething should be said here concerning hybrids and hybridism. This\r\nproblem has of late reached such large proportions that it cannot be\r\ndealt with adequately in a short survey of the phenomena of heredity in\r\ngeneral. It requires a separate treatment. For this reason I shall limit\r\nmyself to a single phase of the problem, which seems to be indispensable\r\nfor a true and at the same time easy distinction between elementary\r\nspecies and retrograde varieties. According to accepted terminology,\r\nsome crosses are to be considered as unsymmetrical, while others are\r\nsymmetrical. The first are one-sided, [21] some peculiarity being found\r\nin one of the parents and lacking in the other. The second are balanced,\r\nas all the characters are present in both parents, but are found in a\r\ndifferent condition. Active in one of them, they are concealed or\r\ninactive in the other. Hence pairs of contrasting units result, while in\r\nunbalanced crosses no pairing of the particular character under\r\nconsideration is possible. This leads to the principal difference\r\nbetween species and varieties, and to an experimental method of deciding\r\nbetween them in difficult and doubtful cases.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indicated the general outlines of the subjects I shall deal\r\nwith, something now may be said as to methods of investigation.\r\n\r\nThere are two points in which scientific investigation differs from\r\nordinary pedigree-culture in practice. First the isolation of the\r\nindividuals and the study of individual inheritance, instead of\r\naverages. Next comes the task of keeping records. Every individual must\r\nbe entered, its ancestry must be known as completely as possible, and\r\nall its relations must be noted in such a form, that the most complete\r\nreference is always possible. Mutations may come unexpectedly, and when\r\nonce arisen, their parents and grand-parents should be known. Records\r\nmust be available which will allow of a most complete knowledge of the\r\nwhole ancestral [22] line. This, and approximately this only, is the\r\nessential difference between experimental and accidental observation.\r\n\r\nMutations are occurring from time to time in the wild state as well as\r\nin horticulture and agriculture. A selection of the most interesting\r\ninstances will be given later. But in all such cases the experimental\r\nproof is wanting. The observations as a rule, only began when the\r\nmutation had made its appearance. A more or less vague remembrance about\r\nthe previous state of the plants in question might be available, though\r\neven this is generally absent. But on doubtful points, concerning\r\npossible crosses or possible introduction of foreign strains, mere\r\nrecollection is insufficient. The fact of the mutation may be very\r\nprobable, but the full proof is, of course, wanting. Such is the case\r\nwith the mutative origin of _Xanthium commune_ Wootoni from New Mexico\r\nand of _Oenothera biennis cruciata_ from Holland. The same doubt exists\r\nas to the origin of the _Capsella heegeri_ of Solms-Laubach, and of the\r\noldest recorded mutation, that of _Chelidonium laciniatum_ in Heidelberg\r\nabout 1600.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have doubts about the fact itself. These, however, gradually\r\nlose their importance in the increasing accumulation of evidence.\r\nSecondly, the impossibility of a closer [23] inquiry into the real\r\nnature of the change. For experimental purposes a single mutation does\r\nnot suffice; it must be studied repeatedly, and be produced more or less\r\narbitrarily, according to the nature of the problems to be solved. And\r\nin order to do this, it is evidently not enough to have in hand the\r\nmutated individual, but it is indispensable to have also the mutable\r\nparents, or the mutable strain from which it sprang.\r\n\r\nAll conditions previous to the mutation are to be considered as of far\r\nhigher importance than all those subsequent to it.\r\n\r\nNow mutations come unexpectedly, and if the ancestry of an accidental\r\nmutation is to be known, it is of course necessary to keep accounts of\r\nall the strains cultivated. It is evident that the required knowledge\r\nconcerning the ancestry of a supposed mutation, must necessarily nearly\r\nall be acquired from the plants in the experimental garden.\r\n\r\nObviously this rule is as simple in theory, as it is difficult to carry\r\nout in practice. First of all comes the book-keeping. The parents,\r\ngrandparents and previous ancestors must be known individually. Accounts\r\nof them must be kept under two headings. A full description of their\r\nindividual character and peculiarities must always be available on the\r\none hand, and on the other, all facts concerning their hereditary [24]\r\nqualities. These are to be deduced from the composition of the progeny,\r\nand in order to obtain complete evidence on this point, two successive\r\ngenerations are often required. The investigation must ascertain the\r\naverage condition of this offspring and the occurrence of any deviating\r\nspecimens, and for both purposes it is necessary to cultivate them in\r\nrelatively large numbers. It is obvious that, properly speaking, the\r\nwhole family of a mutated individual, including all its nearer and more\r\nremote relatives, should be known and recorded.\r\n\r\nHence pedigree-book-keeping must become the general rule. Subordinate to\r\nthis are two further points, which should likewise be stated here. One\r\npertains to the pure or hybrid nature of the original strain, and the\r\nother to the life-conditions and all other external influences. It is\r\nmanifest that a complete understanding of a mutation depends upon full\r\ninformation upon these points.\r\n\r\nAll experiments must have a beginning. The starting-point may be a\r\nsingle individual, or a small group of plants, or a lot of seeds. In\r\nmany cases the whole previous history is obscure, but sometimes a little\r\nhistorical evidence is at hand. Often it is evident that the initial\r\nmaterial belongs to a pure species, but with respect to the question of\r\nelementary species it is [25] not rarely open to doubt. Large numbers of\r\nhybrid plants and hybrid races are in existence, concerning the origin\r\nof which it is impossible to decide. It is impossible in many instances\r\nto ascertain whether they are of hybrid or of pure origin. Often there\r\nis only one way of determining the matter; it is to guess at the\r\nprobable parents in case of a cross and to repeat the cross. This is a\r\npoint which always requires great care in the interpretation of unusual\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThree cases are to be distinguished as to heredity. Many plants are so\r\nconstituted as to be fertilized with their own pollen. In this case the\r\nvisits of insects have simply to be excluded, which may be done by\r\ncovering plants with iron gauze or with bags of prepared paper.\r\nSometimes they fertilize themselves without any aid, as for instance,\r\nthe common evening-primrose; in other cases the pollen has to be placed\r\non the stigma artificially, as with Lamarck's evening-primrose and its\r\nderivatives. Other plants need cross-fertilization in order to produce a\r\nnormal yield of seeds. Here two individuals have always to be combined,\r\nand the pedigree becomes a more complicated one. Such is the case with\r\nthe toad-flax, which is nearly sterile with its own pollen. But even in\r\nthese cases the visits of insects bringing pollen [26] from other\r\nplants, must be carefully excluded. A special lecture will be devoted to\r\nthis very interesting source of impurity and of uncertainty in ordinary\r\ncultures.\r\n\r\nOf course, crosses may lie in the proposed line of work, and this is the\r\nthird point to be alluded to. They must be surrounded with the same\r\ncareful isolation and protection against bees, as any other\r\nfertilizations. And not only the seed-parent, but also the pollen must\r\nbe kept pure from all possible foreign admixtures.\r\n\r\nA pure and accurately recorded ancestry is thus to be considered as the\r\nmost important condition of success in experimental plant breeding. Next\r\nto this comes the gathering of the seeds of each individual separately.\r\nFifty or sixty, and often more, bags of seeds are by no means uncommon\r\nfor a single experiment, and in ordinary years the harvest of my garden\r\nis preserved in over a thousand separate lots.\r\n\r\nComplying with these conditions, the origin of species may be seen as\r\neasily as any other phenomenon. It is only necessary to have a plant in\r\na mutable condition. Not all species are in such a state at present, and\r\ntherefore I have begun by ascertaining which were stable and which were\r\nnot. These attempts, of course, had to be made in the experimental\r\ngarden, and large quantities of seed had to be procured and [27] sown.\r\nCultivated plants of course, had only a small chance to exhibit new\r\nqualities, as they have been so strictly controlled during so many\r\nyears. Moreover their purity of origin is in many cases doubtful. Among\r\nwild plants only those could be expected to reward the investigator\r\nwhich were of easy cultivation. For this reason I have limited myself to\r\nthe trial of wild plants of Holland, and have had the good fortune to\r\nfind among them at least one species in a state of mutability. It was\r\nnot really a native plant, but one that had been introduced from America\r\nand belongs to an American genus. I refer to the great evening-primrose\r\nor the evening-primrose of Lamarck. A strain of this beautiful species\r\nis growing in an abandoned field in the vicinity of Hilversum, at a\r\nshort distance from Amsterdam. Here it has escaped from a park and\r\nmultiplied. In doing so it has produced and is still producing quite a\r\nnumber of new types, some of which may be considered as retrograde\r\nvarieties, while others evidently are of the nature of progressive\r\nelementary species.\r\n\r\nThis interesting plant has afforded me the means of observing directly\r\nhow new species originate, and of studying the laws of these changes. My\r\nresearches have followed a double line of inquiry. On one side, I have\r\nlimited [28] myself to direct field observations, and to tests of seed,\r\ncollected from the wild plants in their native locality. Obviously the\r\nmutations are decided within the seed, and the culture of young plants\r\nfrom them had no other aim than that of ascertaining what had occurred\r\nin the field. And then the many chances of destruction that threaten\r\nyoung plants in a wild state, could be avoided in the garden, where\r\nenvironmental factors can be controlled.\r\n\r\nMy second line of inquiry was an experimental repetition of the\r\nphenomena which were only partly discerned at the native locality. It\r\nwas not my aim to intrude into the process, nor to try to bring out new\r\nfeatures. My only object was to submit to the precepts just given\r\nconcerning pure treatment, individual seed gathering, exclusion of\r\ncrosses and accurate recording of all the facts. The result has been a\r\npedigree which now permits of stating the relation between all the\r\ndescendants of my original introduced plant. This pedigree at once\r\nexhibits the laws followed by the mutating species. The main fact is,\r\nthat it does not change itself gradually, but remains unaffected during\r\nall succeeding generations. It only throws off new forms, which are\r\nsharply contrasted with the parent, and which are from the very\r\nbeginning as perfect and as constant, as narrowly [29] defined and as\r\npure of type as might be expected of any species.\r\n\r\nThese new species are not produced once or in single individuals, but\r\nyearly and in large numbers. The whole phenomenon conveys the idea of a\r\nclose group of mutations, all belonging to one single condition of\r\nmutability. Of course this mutable state must have had a beginning, as\r\nit must sometime come to an end. It is to be considered as a period\r\nwithin the life-time of the species and probably it is only a small part\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe detailed description of this experiment, however, I must delay to a\r\nsubsequent lecture, but I may be allowed to state, that the discovery of\r\nthis period of mutability is of a definite theoretical importance. One\r\nof the greatest objections to the Darwinian theory of descent arose from\r\nthe length of time it would require, if all evolution was to be\r\nexplained on the theory of slow and nearly invisible changes. This\r\ndifficulty is at once met and fully surmounted by the hypothesis of\r\nperiodical but sudden and quite noticeable steps. This assumption\r\nrequires only a limited number of mutative periods, which might well\r\noccur within the time allowed by physicists and geologists for the\r\nexistence of animal and vegetable life on the earth.\r\n\r\n[30] Summing up the main points of these introductory remarks, I propose\r\nto deal with the subjects mentioned above at some length, devoting to\r\neach of them, if possible at least an entire lecture. The decisive facts\r\nand discussions upon which the conclusions are based will be given in\r\nevery case. Likewise I hope to point out the weak places and the lacunae\r\nin our present knowledge, and to show the way in which each of you may\r\ntry to contribute his part towards the advancement of science in this\r\nsubject. Lastly I shall try to prove that sudden mutation is the normal\r\nway in which nature produces new species and new varieties. These\r\nmutations are more readily accessible to observation and experiment than\r\nthe slow and gradual changes surmised by Wallace and his followers,\r\nwhich are entirely beyond our present and future experience.\r\n\r\nThe theory of mutations is a starting-point for direct investigation,\r\nwhile the general belief in slow changes has held back science from such\r\ninvestigations during half a century.\r\n\r\nComing now to the subdivisions and headings under which my material is\r\nto be presented, I propose describing first the real nature of the\r\nelementary species and retrograde varieties, both in normal form and in\r\nhybridizations. A discussion of other types of varieties, including [31]\r\nmonstrosities will complete the general plan. The second subdivision\r\nwill deal with the origin of species and varieties as taught by\r\nexperiment and observation, treating separately the sudden variations\r\nwhich to my mind do produce new forms, and subsequently the fluctuations\r\nwhich I hold to be not adequate to this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n[32]\r\nB. ELEMENTARY SPECIES\r\n\r\nLECTURE II\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SPECIES IN NATURE\r\n\r\nWhat are species? Species are considered as the true units of nature by\r\nthe vast majority of biologists. They have gained this high rank in our\r\nestimation principally through the influence of Linnaeus. They have\r\nsupplanted the genera which were the accepted units before Linnaeus.\r\nThey are now to be replaced in their turn, by smaller types, for reasons\r\nwhich do not rest upon comparative studies but upon direct experimental\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nBiological studies and practical interests alike make new demands upon\r\nsystematic botany. Species are not only the subject-material of herbaria\r\nand collections, but they are living entities, and their life-history\r\nand life-conditions command a gradually increasing interest. One phase\r\nof the question is to determine the easiest manner to deal with the\r\ncollected forms of a country, and another feature is the problem [33] as\r\nto what groups are real units and will remain constant and unchanged\r\nthrough all the years of our observations.\r\n\r\nBefore Linnaeus, the genera were the real units of the system. De\r\nCandolle pointed out that the old common names of plants, such as roses\r\nand clover, poplars and oaks, nearly all refer to genera. The type of\r\nthe clovers is rich in color, and the shape of the flower-heads and the\r\nsingle flowers escape ordinary observation; but notwithstanding this,\r\nclovers are easily recognized, even if new types come to hand. White and\r\nred clovers and many other species are distinguished simply by\r\nadjectives, the generic name remaining the same for all.\r\n\r\nTournefort, who lived in the second half of the 17th century\r\n(1656-1708), is generally considered as the author of genera in\r\nsystematic botany. He adopted, what was at that time the general\r\nconception and applied it throughout the vegetable kingdom. He grouped\r\nthe new and the rare and the previously overlooked forms in the same\r\nmanner in which the more conspicuous plants were already arranged by\r\nuniversal consent. Species were distinguished by minor marks and often\r\nindicated by short descriptions, but they were considered of secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nBased on the idea of a direct creation of all [34] living beings, the\r\ngenera were then accepted as the created forms. They were therefore\r\nregarded as the real existing types, and it was generally surmised that\r\nspecies and varieties owed their origin to subsequent changes under the\r\ninfluence of external conditions. Even Linnaeus agreed with this view in\r\nhis first treatises and in his \"Philosophical Botany\" he still kept to\r\nthe idea that all genera had been created at once with the beginning of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Linnaeus changed his opinion on this important point, and\r\nadopted species as the units of the system. He declared them to be the\r\ncreated forms, and by this decree, at once reduced the genera to the\r\nrank of artificial groups. Linnaeus was well aware that this conception\r\nwas wholly arbitrary, and that even the species are not real indivisible\r\nentities. But he simply forbade the study of lesser subdivisions. At his\r\ntime he was quite justified in doing so, because the first task of the\r\nsystematic botanists was the clearing up of the chaos of forms and the\r\nbringing of them into connection with their real allies.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus himself designated the subdivisions of the species as\r\nvarieties, but in doing so he followed two clearly distinct principles.\r\nIn some cases his species were real plants, and the varieties seemed to\r\nbe derived from them by [35] some simple changes. They were subordinated\r\nto the parent-species. In other cases his species were groups of lesser\r\nforms of equal value, and it was not possible to discern which was the\r\nprimary and which were the derivatives.\r\n\r\nThese two methods of subdivision seem in the main, and notwithstanding\r\ntheir relatively imperfect application in many single examples, to\r\ncorrespond with two really distinct cases. The derivative varieties are\r\ndistinguished from the parent-species by some single, but striking mark,\r\nand often this attribute manifests itself as the loss of some apparent\r\nquality. The loss of spines and of hairs and the loss of blue and red\r\nflower-colors are the most notorious, but in rarer cases many single\r\npeculiarities may disappear, thereby constituting a variety. This\r\nrelation of varieties to the parent-species is gradually increasing in\r\nimportance in the estimation of botanists, sharply contrasting with\r\nthose cases, in which such dependency is not to be met with.\r\n\r\nIf among the subdivisions of a species, no single one can be pointed out\r\nas playing a primary part, and the others can not be traced back to it,\r\nthe relation between these lesser units is of course of another\r\ncharacter. They are to be considered of equal importance. They are\r\ndistinguished from each other by more than [36] one character, often by\r\nslight differences in nearly all their organs and qualities. Such forms\r\nhave come to be designated as \"elementary species.\" They are only\r\nvarieties in a broad and vague systematic significance of the word, not\r\nin the sense accorded to this term in horticultural usage, nor in a\r\nsharper and more scientific conception.\r\n\r\nGenera and species are, at the present time, for a large part\r\nartificial, or stated more correctly, conventional groups. Every\r\nsystematist is free to delimit them in a wider or in a narrower sense,\r\naccording to his judgment. The greater authorities have as a rule\r\npreferred larger genera, others of late have elevated innumerable\r\nsubgenera to the rank of genera. This would work no real harm, if\r\nunfortunately, the names of the plants had not to be changed each time,\r\naccording to current ideas concerning genera. Quite the same inconstancy\r\nis observed with species. In the Handbook of the British Flora, Bentham\r\nand Hooker describe the forms of brambles under 5 species, while\r\nBabington in his Manual of British Botany makes 45 species out of the\r\nsame material. So also in other cases. For instance, the willows which\r\nhave 13 species in one and 31 species in the other of these manuals, and\r\nthe hawkweeds for which the figures are 7 and 32 [37] respectively.\r\nOther authors have made still greater numbers of species in the same\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to estimate systematic differences on the ground of\r\ncomparative studies alone. All sorts of variability occur, and no\r\nindividual or small group of specimens can really be considered as a\r\nreliable representative of the supposed type. Many original diagnoses of\r\nnew species have been founded on divergent specimens and of course, the\r\ntype can afterwards neither be derived from this individual, nor from\r\nthe diagnosis given.\r\n\r\nThis chaotic state of things has brought some botanists to the\r\nconviction that even in systematic studies only direct experimental\r\nevidence can be relied upon. This conception has induced them to test\r\nthe constancy of species and varieties, and to admit as real units only\r\nsuch groups of individuals as prove to be uniform and constant\r\nthroughout succeeding generations. The late Alexis Jordan, of Lyons in\r\nFrance, made extensive cultures in this direction. In doing so, he\r\ndiscovered that systematic species, as a rule, comprise some lesser\r\nforms, which often cannot easily be distinguished when grown in\r\ndifferent regions, or by comparing dried material. This fact was, of\r\ncourse, most distasteful to the systematists of his time and even for a\r\nlong period afterwards [38] they attempted to discredit it. Milde and\r\nmany others have opposed these new ideas with some temporary success.\r\nOnly of late has the school of Jordan received due recognition, after\r\nThuret, de Bary, Rosen and others tested its practices and openly\r\npronounced for them. Of late Wittrock of Sweden has joined them, making\r\nextensive experimental studies concerning the real units of some of the\r\nlarger species of his country.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence given by these eminent authorities, we may conclude\r\nthat systematic species, as they are accepted nowadays, are as a rule\r\ncompound groups. Sometimes they consist of two or three, or a few\r\nelementary types, but in other cases they comprise twenty, or fifty, or\r\neven hundreds of constant and well differentiated forms.\r\n\r\nThe inner constitution of these groups is however, not at all the same\r\nin all cases. This will be seen by the description of some of the more\r\ninteresting of them. The European heartsease, from which our\r\ngarden-pansies have been chiefly derived, will serve as an example. The\r\ngarden-pansies are a hybrid race, won by crossing the _Viola tricolor_\r\nwith the large flowered and bright yellow _V. lutea_. They combine, as\r\neveryone knows, in their wide range of [39] varieties, the attributes of\r\nthe latter with the peculiarities of the former species.\r\n\r\nBesides the _lutea_, there are some other species, nearly allied to\r\ntricolor, as for instance, _cornuta_, _calcarata_, and _altaica_, which\r\nare combined with it under the head of _Melanium_ as a subgenus, and\r\nwhich together constitute a systematic unity of undoubted value, but\r\nranging between the common conceptions of genus and species. These forms\r\nare so nearly allied to the heartsease that they have of late been made\r\nuse of in crosses, in order to widen the range of variability of\r\ngarden-pansies.\r\n\r\n_Viola tricolor_ is a common European weed. It is widely dispersed and\r\nvery abundant, growing in many localities in large numbers. It is an\r\nannual and ripens its seeds freely, and if opportunity is afforded, it\r\nmultiplies rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Viola tricolor_ has three subspecies, which have been elevated to the\r\nrank of species by some authors, and which may here be called, for\r\nbrevity's sake, by their binary names. One is the typical _V. tricolor_,\r\nwith broad flowers, variously colored and veined with yellow, purple and\r\nwhite. It occurs in waste places on sandy soil. The second is called _V.\r\narvensis_ or the field-pansy; it has small inconspicuous flowers, with\r\npale-yellowish petals which are shorter than the sepals. It pollinates\r\nitself without the [40] aid of insects, and is widely dispersed in\r\ncultivated fields. The third form, _V. alpestris_, grows in the Alps,\r\nbut is of lesser importance for our present discussion.\r\n\r\nAnywhere throughout the central part of Europe _V. tricolor_ and _V.\r\narvensis_ may be seen, each occupying its own locality. They may be\r\nconsidered as ranging among the most common native plants of the\r\nparticular regions they inhabit. They vary in the color of the flowers,\r\nbranching of the stems, in the foliage and other parts, but not to such\r\nan extent as to constitute distinct strains. They have been brought into\r\ncultivation by Jordan, Wittrock and others, but throughout Europe each\r\nof them constitutes a single type.\r\n\r\nThese types must be very old and constant, fluctuating always within the\r\nsame distinct and narrow limits. No slow, gradual changes can have taken\r\nplace. In different countries their various habitats are as old as the\r\nhistorical records, and probably many centuries older. They are quite\r\nindependent of one another, the distance being in numerous cases far too\r\ngreat for the exchange of pollen or of seeds. If slow and gradual\r\nchanges were the rule, the types could not have remained so uniform\r\nthroughout the whole range of these two species. They would necessarily\r\nhave split up into thousands [41] and thousands of minor races, which\r\nwould show their peculiar characteristics if tested by cultures in\r\nadjacent beds. This however, is not what happens. As a matter of fact\r\n_V. tricolor_ and _V. arvensis_ are widely distributed but wholly\r\nconstant types.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there occur distinct types in numerous localities. Some\r\nof them evidently have had time and opportunity to spread more or less\r\nwidely and now occupy larger regions or even whole countries. Others are\r\nnarrowly limited, being restricted to a single locality. Wittrock\r\ncollected seeds or plants from as many localities as possible in\r\ndifferent parts of Sweden and neighboring states and sowed them in his\r\ngarden near Stockholm. He secured seeds from his plants, and grew from\r\nthem a second, and in many cases a third generation in order to estimate\r\nthe amount of variability. As a rule the forms introduced into his\r\ngarden proved constant, notwithstanding the new and abnormal conditions\r\nunder which they were propagated.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we may mention three perennial forms called by him _Viola\r\ntricolor ammotropha_, _V. tricolor coniophila_ and _V. stenochila_. The\r\ntypical _V. tricolor_ is an annual plant; sowing itself in summer and\r\ngerminating soon afterwards. The young plants thrive throughout [42] the\r\nlatter part of the summer and during the fall, reaching an advanced\r\nstage of development of the branched stems before winter. Early in the\r\nspring the flowers begin to open, but after the ripening of the seeds\r\nthe whole plant dies.\r\n\r\nThe three perennial species just mentioned develop in the same manner in\r\nthe first year. During their flowering period, however, and afterwards,\r\nthey produce new shoots from the lower parts of the stem. They prefer\r\ndry and sandy soils, often becoming covered with the sand that is blown\r\non them by the winds. They are prepared for such seemingly adverse\r\ncircumstances by the accumulation of food in the older stems and by the\r\ncapacity of the new shoots to thrive on this food till they have become\r\nlong enough to reach the light. _V. tricolor ammotropha_ is native near\r\nYstad in Sweden, and the other two forms on Gotland. All three have\r\nnarrowly limited habitats.\r\n\r\nThe typical tricolored heartsease has remained annual in all its other\r\nsubspecies. It may be divided into two types in the first place, _V.\r\ntricolor genuina_ and _V. tricolor versicolor_. Both of them have a wide\r\ndistribution and seem to be the prototypes from which the rarer forms\r\nmust have been derived. Among these latter Wittrock describes seven\r\nlocal types, which [43] proved to be constant in his pedigree-cultures.\r\nSome of them have produced other forms, related to them in the way of\r\nvarieties. They all have nearly the same general habit and do not\r\nexhibit any marked differences in their growth, in the structure and\r\nbranching of the stems, or in the character of their foliage.\r\nDifferentiating points are to be found mainly in the colors and patterns\r\nof the flowers. The veins, which radiate from the centre of the corolla\r\nare branched in some and undivided in others; in one elementary species\r\nthey are wholly lacking. The purple color may be absent, leaving the\r\nflowers of a pale or a deep yellow. Or the purple may be reddish or\r\nbluish. Of the petals all five may have the purple hue on their tips, or\r\nthis attribute may be limited to the two upper ones. Contrasting with\r\nthis wide variability is the stability of the yellow spot in the centre,\r\nwhich is always present and becomes inconspicuous only, when the whole\r\npetals are of the same hue. It is a general conception that colors and\r\ncolor-markings are liable to great variability and do not constitute\r\nreliable standards. But the cultures of Wittrock have proved the\r\ncontrary, at least in the case of the violets. No pattern, however\r\nquaint, appears changeable, if one elementary species only is\r\nconsidered. Hundreds of plants from seeds [44] from one locality may be\r\ngrown, and all will exhibit exactly the same markings. Most of these\r\nforms are of very local occurrence. The most beautiful of all, the\r\n_ornatissima_, is found only in Jemtland, the _aurobadia_ only in\r\nSodermanland, the anopetala_ in other localities in the same country,\r\nthe _roseola_ near Stockholm, and the yellow _lutescens_ in Finmarken.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Wittrock included only a small number of elementary\r\nspecies, but every one who has observed the violets in the central parts\r\nof Europe must be convinced that many dozens of constant forms of the\r\ntypical _Viola tricolor_ might easily be found and isolated.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the field pansy, the _Viola arvensis_, a very common weed\r\nin the grain-fields of central Europe. I have already mentioned its\r\nsmall corolla, surpassed by the lobes of the calyx and its capacity of\r\nself-fertilization. It has still other curious differentiating\r\ncharacters; the pollen grains, which are square in _V. tricolor_, are\r\nfive-sided in _V. arvensis_. Some transgressive fluctuating variability\r\nmay occur in both cases through the admixture of pollen-grains. Even\r\nthree-angled pollen grains are seen sometimes. Other marks are observed\r\nin the form of the anthers and the spur.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be very many local subspecies [45] of the field-pansy.\r\nJordan has described some from the vicinity of Lyons, and Wittrock\r\nothers from the northern parts of Europe. They diverge from their common\r\nprototype in nearly all attributes, the flowers not showing the\r\nessential differentiating characters as in the _V. tricolor_. Some have\r\ntheir flower-stalks erect, and in others the flowers are held nearly at\r\nright angles to the stem. _V. pallescens_ is a small, almost unbranched\r\nspecies with small pale flowers. _V. segetalis_ is a stouter species\r\nwith two dark blue spots on the tips of the upper petals. _V. agrestis_\r\nis a tall and branched, hairy form. _V. nemausensis_ attains a height of\r\nonly 10 cm., has rounded leaves and long flower-stalks. Even the seeds\r\nafford characters which may be made use of in isolating the various\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned elementary forms belong to the flora of southern\r\nFrance, and Wittrock has isolated and cultivated a number of others from\r\nthe fields of Sweden. A species from Stockholm is called _Viola patens_;\r\n_V. arvensis curtisepala_ occurs in Gotland, and _V. arvensis striolata_\r\nis a distinct form, which has appeared in his cultures without its true\r\norigin being ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe alpine violets comprise a more widespread type with some local\r\nelementary species [46] derived exactly in the same way as the\r\ntricolored field pansies.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the general result of this description we see that the\r\noriginal species _Viola tricolor_ may be split up into larger and lesser\r\ngroups of separate forms. These last prove to be constant in\r\npedigree-cultures, and therefore are to be considered as really existent\r\nunits. They are very numerous, comprising many dozens in each of the two\r\nlarger subdivisions.\r\n\r\nAll systematic grouping of these forms, and their combination into\r\nsubspecies and species rests on the comparative study of their\r\ncharacters. The result of such studies must necessarily depend on\r\nprinciples which underlie them. According to the choice of these\r\nprinciples, the construction of the groups will be found to be\r\ndifferent. Wittrock trusts in the first place to morphologic characters,\r\nand considers the development as passing from the more simple to the\r\nmore complex types. On the other hand the geographic distribution may be\r\nconsidered as an indication of the direction of evolution, the\r\nwide-spread forms being regarded as the common parents of the minor\r\nlocal species.\r\n\r\nHowever, such considerations are only of secondary importance. It must\r\nbe borne in mind that an ordinary systematic species may include [47]\r\nmany dozens of elementary forms, each of which remains constant and\r\nunchanged in successive generations, even if cultivated in the same\r\ngarden and under similar external conditions.\r\n\r\nLeaving the violets, we may take the vernal whitlow-grass or _Draba\r\nverna_ for a second illustration. This little annual cruciferous plant\r\nis common in the fields of many parts of the United States, though\r\noriginally introduced from Europe. It has small basal rosettes which\r\ndevelop during summer and winter, and produce numerous leafless\r\nflowering stems early in the spring. It is a native of central Europe\r\nand western Asia, and may be considered as one of the most common\r\nplants, occurring anywhere in immense numbers on sandy soils. Jordan was\r\nthe first to point out that it is not the same throughout its entire\r\nrange. Although a hasty survey does not reveal differences, they show\r\nthemselves on closer inspection. De Bary, Thuret, Rosen and many others\r\nconfirmed this result, and repeated the pedigree-cultures of Jordan.\r\nEvery type is constant and remains unchanged in successive generations.\r\nThe anthers open in the flower-buds and pollinate the stigmas before the\r\nexpansion of the flowers, thus assuring self-fertilization. Moreover,\r\nthese inconspicuous little flowers are only sparingly visited by\r\ninsects. Dozens of subspecies [48] may be cultivated in the same garden\r\nwithout any real danger of their intercrossing. They remain as pure as\r\nunder perfect isolation.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to observe the aspect of such types, when growing\r\nnear each other. Hundreds of rosettes exhibit one type, and are\r\nundoubtedly similar. The alternative group is distinguishable at first\r\nsight, though the differentiating marks are often so slight as to be\r\ntraceable with difficulty. Two elementary species occur in Holland, one\r\nwith narrow leaves in the western provinces and one with broader foliage\r\nin the northern parts. I have cultivated them side by side, and was as\r\nmuch struck with the uniformity within each group, as with the contrast\r\nbetween the two sets.\r\n\r\nNearly all organs show differences. The most marked are those of the\r\nleaves, which may be small or large, linear or elliptic or oblong and\r\neven rhomboidal in shape, more or less hairy with simple or with\r\nstellate branched hairs, and finally of a pure green or of a glaucous\r\ncolor. The petals are as a rule obcordate, but this type may be combined\r\nwith others having more or less broad emarginations at the summit, and\r\nwith differences in breadth which vary from almost linear types to\r\nothers which touch along their margins. The pods are short and broad, or\r\nlong and narrow, or varying in sundry other [49] ways. All in all there\r\nare constant differences which are so great that it has been possible to\r\ndistinguish and to describe large numbers of types.\r\n\r\nMany of them have been tested as to their constancy from seed. Jordan\r\nmade numerous cultures, some of which lasted ten or twelve years; Thuret\r\nhas verified the assertion concerning their constancy by cultures\r\nextending over seven years in some instances; Villars and de Bary made\r\nnumerous trials of shorter duration. All agree as to the main points.\r\nThe local races are uniform and come true from seed; the variability of\r\nthe species is not of a fluctuating, but of a polymorphous nature. A\r\ngiven elementary species keeps within its limits and cannot vary beyond\r\nthem, but the whole group gives the impression of variability by its\r\nwide range of distinct, but nearly allied forms.\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of these elementary species of the\r\nwhitlow-grass is quite distinct from that of the violets. Here\r\npredominant species are limited to restricted localities. Most of them\r\noccupy one or more departments of France, and in Holland two of them are\r\nspread over several provinces. An important number are native in the\r\ncentre of Europe, and from the vicinity of Lyons, Jordan succeeded in\r\nestablishing about fifty elementary [50] species in his garden. In this\r\nregion they are crowded together and not rarely two or even more quite\r\ndistinct forms are observed to grow side by side on the same spot.\r\nFarther away from this center they are more widely dispersed, each\r\nholding its own in its habitat. In all, Jordan has distinguished about\r\ntwo hundred species of _Draba verna_ from Europe and western Asia.\r\nSubsequent authors have added new types to the already existing number\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nThe constancy of these elementary species is directly proven by the\r\nexperiments quoted above, and moreover it may be deduced from the\r\nuniformity of each type within its own domain. These are so large that\r\nmost of the localities are practically isolated from one another, and\r\nmust have been so for centuries. If the types were slowly changing such\r\nlocalities would often, though of course not always, exhibit slighter\r\ndifferences, and on the geographic limits of neighboring species\r\nintermediates would be found. Such however, are not on record. Hence the\r\nelementary species must be regarded as old and constant types.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises how these groups of nearly allied forms\r\nmay originally have been produced. Granting a common origin for all of\r\nthem, the changes may have been [51] simultaneous or successive.\r\nAccording to the geographic distribution, the place of common origin\r\nmust probably be sought in the southern part of central Europe, perhaps\r\neven in the vicinity of Lyons. Here we may assume that the old _Draba\r\nverna_ has produced a host or a swarm of new types. Thence they must\r\nhave spread over Europe, but whether in doing so they have remained\r\nconstant, or whether some or many of them have repeatedly undergone\r\nspecific mutations, is of course unknown.\r\n\r\nThe main fact is, that such a small species as _Draba verna_ is not at\r\nall a uniform type, but comprises over two hundred well distinguished\r\nand constant forms.\r\n\r\nIt is readily granted that violets and whitlowgrasses are extreme\r\ninstances of systematic variability. Such great numbers of elementary\r\nspecies are not often included in single species of the system. But the\r\nnumbers are of secondary importance, and the fact that systematic\r\nspecies consist, as a rule, of more than one independent and constant\r\nsubspecies, retains its almost universal validity.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the systematic species are manifest groups, sharply\r\ndifferentiated from one another. In other instances the groups of\r\nelementary forms as they are shown by direct observation, have been\r\nadjudged by many authors [52] to be too large to constitute species.\r\nHence the polymorphous genera, concerning the systematic subdivisions of\r\nwhich hardly two authors agree. Brambles and roses are widely known\r\ninstances, but oaks, elms, apples, and pears, _Mentha_, _Prunu_s,\r\n_Vitis_, _Lactuca_, _Cucumis_, _Cucurbita_ and numerous others are in\r\nthe same condition.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the existence of elementary species is so obvious,\r\nthat they have been described by taxonomists as systematic varieties or\r\neven as good species. The primroses afford a widely known example.\r\nLinnaeus called them _Primula veris_, and recognized three types as\r\npertaining to this species, but Jacquin and others have elevated these\r\nsubspecies to the full rank of species. They now bear the names of\r\n_Primula elatior_ with larger, _P. officinalis_ with smaller flowers,\r\nand _P. acaulis_. In the last named the common flower-stalk is lacking\r\nand the flowers of the umbel seem to be borne in the arils of the basal\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nIn other genera such nearly allied species are more or less universally\r\nrecognized. _Galium Mollugo_ has been divided into _G. elatum_ with a\r\nlong and weak stem, and _G. erectum_ with shorter and erect stems;\r\n_Cochlearia danica_, _anglica_ and _officinalis_ are so nearly allied as\r\nto be hardly distinguishable. _Sagina apetala_ and _patula_, [53]\r\n_Spergula media_ and _salina_ and many other pairs of allied species\r\nhave differentiating characters of the same value as those of the\r\nelementary species of _Draba verna_. _Filago_, _Plantago_, _Carex_,\r\n_Ficaria_ and a long series of other genera afford proofs of the same\r\nclose relation between smaller and larger groups of species. The\r\nEuropean frost-weeds or _Helianthemum_ include a group of species which\r\nare so closely allied, that ordinary botanical descriptions are not\r\nadequate to give any idea of their differentiating features. It is\r\nalmost impossible to determine them by means of the common analytical\r\nkeys. They have to be gathered from their various native localities and\r\ncultivated side by side in the garden to bring out their differences.\r\nAmong the species of France, according to Jordan, _Helianthemum\r\npolifolium_, _H. apenninum_, _H. pilosum_ and _H. pulverulentum_ are of\r\nthis character.\r\n\r\nA species of cinquefoil, _Potentilla Tormentilla_, which is\r\ndistinguished by its quaternate flowers, occurs in Holland in two\r\ndistinct types, which have proved constant in my cultural experiments.\r\nOne of them has, broad petals, meeting together at the edges, and\r\nconstituting rounded saucer without breaks. The other has narrow petals,\r\nwhich are strikingly separated from one another and show the sepals\r\nbetween them. [54] In the same manner bluebells vary in the size and\r\nshape of the corolla, which may be wide or narrow, bell-shaped or\r\nconical, with the tips turned downwards, sidewards or backwards.\r\n\r\nAs a rule all of the more striking elementary types have been described\r\nby local botanists under distinct specific names, while they are thrown\r\ntogether into the larger systematic species by other authors, who study\r\nthe distribution of plants over larger portions of the world. Everything\r\ndepends on the point of view taken. Large floras require large species.\r\nBut the study of local floras yields the best results if the many forms\r\nof the region are distinguished and described as completely as possible.\r\nAnd the easiest way is to give to each of them a specific name. If two\r\nor more elementary species are united in the same district, they are\r\noften treated in this way, but if each region had its own type of some\r\ngiven species, commonly the part is taken for the whole, and the sundry\r\nforms are described under the same name, without further distinctions.\r\n\r\nOf course these questions are all of a practical and conventional\r\nnature, but involve the different methods in which different authors\r\ndeal with the same general fact. The fact is that systematic species are\r\ncompound groups, exactly like the genera and that their real units [55]\r\ncan only be recognized by comparative experimental studies.\r\n\r\nThough the evidence already given might be esteemed to be sufficient for\r\nour purpose, I should like to introduce a few more examples; two of them\r\npertain to American plants.\r\n\r\nThe Ipecac spurge or _Euphorbia Ipecacuanha_ occurs from Connecticut to\r\nFlorida, mainly near the coast, preferring dry and sandy soil. It is\r\noften found by the roadsides. According to Britton and Brown's\r\n\"Illustrated Flora\" it is glabrous or pubescent, with several or many\r\nstems, ascending or nearly erect; with green or red leaves, which are\r\nwonderfully variable in outline, from linear to orbicular, mostly\r\nopposite, the upper sometimes whorled, the lower often alternate. The\r\nglands of the involucres are elliptic or oblong, and even the seeds vary\r\nin shape.\r\n\r\nSuch a wide range of variability evidently points to the existence of\r\nsome minor types. Dr. John Harshberger has made a study of those which\r\noccur in the vicinity of Whitings in New Jersey. His types agree with\r\nthe description given above. Others were gathered by him at Brown's\r\nMills in the pinelands, New Jersey, where they grew in almost pure sand\r\nin the bright sunlight. He observed still other differentiating\r\ncharacters. The amount of seed [56] produced and the time of flowering\r\nwere variable to a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nDr. Harshberger had the kindness to send me some dried specimens of the\r\nmost interesting of these types. They show that the peculiarities are\r\nindividual, and that each specimen has its own characters. It is very\r\nprobable that a comparative experimental study will prove the existence\r\nof a large number of elementary species, differing in many points; they\r\nwill probably also show differences in the amount of the active chemical\r\nsubstances, especially of emetine, which is usually recorded as present\r\nin about 1%, but which will undoubtedly be found in larger quantities in\r\nsome, and in smaller quantities in other elementary species. In this way\r\nthe close and careful distinction of the really existing units might\r\nperhaps prove of practical importance.\r\n\r\nMacFarlane has studied the beach-plum or _Prunus maritima_, which is\r\nabundant along the coast regions of the Eastern States from Virginia to\r\nNew Brunswick. It often covers areas from two to two hundred acres in\r\nextent, sometimes to the exclusion of other plants. It is most prolific\r\non soft drifting sand near the sea or along the shore, where it may at\r\ntimes be washed with ocean-spray. The fruit usually become ripe about\r\nthe middle of August, and show extreme [57] variations in size, shape,\r\ncolor, taste, consistency and maturation period, indicating the\r\nexistence of separate races or elementary species, with widely differing\r\nqualities. The earlier varieties begin to ripen from August 10 to 20,\r\nand a continuous supply can be had till September 10, while a few good\r\nvarieties continue to ripen till September 20. But even late in October\r\nsome other types are still found maturing their fruits.\r\n\r\nExact studies were made of fruit and stone variations, and their\r\ncharacteristics as to color, weight, size, shape and consistency were\r\nfully described. Similar variations have been observed, as is well\r\nknown, in the cultivated plums. Fine blue-black fruits were seen on some\r\nshrubs and purplish or yellow fruits on others. Some exhibit a firmer\r\ntexture and others a more watery pulp. Even the stones show differences\r\nwhich are suggestive of distinct races.\r\n\r\nRecently Mr. Luther Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, has made use of\r\nthe beach-plum to produce useful new varieties. He observed that it is a\r\nvery hardy species, and never fails to bear, growing under the most\r\ntrying conditions of dry and sandy, or of rocky and even of heavy soil.\r\nThe fruits of the wild shrubs are utterly worthless for anything but\r\npreserving. [58] But by means of crossing with other species and\r\nespecially with the Japanese plums, the hardy qualities of the\r\nbeach-plum have been united with the size, flavor and other valuable\r\nqualities of the fruit, and a group of new plums have been produced with\r\nbright colors, ovoid and globular forms which are never flattened and\r\nhave no suture. The experiments were not finished, when I visited Mr.\r\nBurbank in July, 1904, and still more startling improvements were said\r\nto have been secured.\r\n\r\nI may perhaps be allowed to avail myself of this opportunity to point\r\nout a practical side of the study of elementary species. This always\r\nappears whenever wild plants are subjected to cultivation, either in\r\norder to reproduce them as pure strains, or to cross them with other\r\nalready cultivated species. The latter practice is as a rule made use of\r\nwhenever a wild species is found to be in possession of some quality\r\nwhich is considered as desirable for the cultivated forms. In the case\r\nof the beach-plum it is the hardiness and the great abundance of fruits\r\nof the wild species which might profitably be combined with the\r\nrecognized qualities of the ordinary plums. Now it is manifest, that in\r\norder to make crosses, distinct individual plants are to be chosen, and\r\nthat the variability of the wild species may be of very great\r\nimportance. [59] Among the range of elementary species those should be\r\nused which not only possess the desired advantages in the highest\r\ndegree, but which promise the best results in other respects or their\r\nearliest attainment. The fuller our knowledge of the elementary species\r\nconstituting the systematic groups, the easier and the more reliable\r\nwill be the choice for the breeder. Many Californian wild flowers with\r\nbright colors seem to consist of large numbers of constant elementary\r\nforms, as for instance, the lilies, godetias, eschscholtias and others.\r\nThey have been brought into cultivation many times, but the minutest\r\ndistinction of their elementary forms is required to attain the highest\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, I will point out a very interesting difficulty, which in\r\nsome cases impedes the clear understanding of elementary species. It is\r\nthe lack of self-fertilization. It occurs in widely distant families,\r\nbut has a special interest for us in two genera, which are generally\r\nknown as very polymorphous groups.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the hawkweed or _Hieracium_, and the other is the\r\ndandelion or _Taraxacum officinale_. Hawkweeds are known as a genus in\r\nwhich the delimitation of the species is almost impossible, Thousands of\r\nforms may be cultivated side by side in botanical gardens, exhibiting\r\n[60] slight but undoubted differentiating features, and reproduce\r\nthemselves truly by seed. Descriptions were formerly difficult and so\r\ncomplicated that the ablest writers on this genus, Fries and Nageli are\r\nsaid not to have been able to recognize the separate species by the\r\ndescriptions given by each other. Are these types to be considered as\r\nelementary species, or only as individual differences? The decision of\r\ncourse, would depend upon their behavior in cultures. Such tests have\r\nbeen made by various experimenters. In the dandelion the bracts of the\r\ninvolucre give the best characters. The inner ones may be linear or\r\nlinear-lanceolate, with or without appendages below the tip; the outer\r\nones may be similar and only shorter, or noticeably larger, erect,\r\nspreading or even reflexed, and the color of the involucre may be a pure\r\ngreen or glaucous; the leaves may be nearly entire or pinnatifid, or\r\nsinuate-dentate, or very deeply runcinate-pinnatifid, or even pinnately\r\ndivided, the whole plant being more or less glabrous.\r\n\r\nRaunkiaer, who has studied experimentally a dozen types from Denmark,\r\nfound them constant, but observed that some of them have no pollen at\r\nall, while in others the pollen, though present, is impotent. It does\r\nnot germinate on the stigma, cannot produce the ordinary tube, [61] and\r\nhence has no fertilizing power. But the young ovaries do not need such\r\nfertilization. They are sufficient unto themselves. One may cut off all\r\nthe flowers of a head before the opening of the anthers, and leave the\r\novaries untouched, and the head will ripen its seeds quite as well. The\r\nsame thing occurs in the hawkweeds. Here, therefore, we have no\r\nfertilization and the extensive widening of the variability, which\r\ngenerally accompanies this process is, of course, wanting. Only partial\r\nor vegetative variability is present. Unfertilized eggs when developing\r\ninto embryos are equivalent to buds, separated from the parent-plant and\r\nplanted for themselves. They repeat both the specific and the individual\r\ncharacters of the parent. In the case of the hawkweed and the dandelion\r\nthere is at present no means of distinguishing between these two\r\ncontrasting causes of variability. But like the garden varieties which\r\nare always propagated in the vegetative way, their constancy and\r\nuniformity are only apparent and afford no real indication of hereditary\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these and other exceptional cases, seed-cultures are\r\nhenceforth to be considered as the sole means of recognizing the really\r\nexisting systematic units of nature. All other groups, including\r\nsystematic species and [62] genera, are equally artificial or\r\nconventional. In other words we may state \"that current misconceptions\r\nas to the extreme range of fluctuating variability of many native\r\nspecies have generally arisen from a failure to recognize the composite\r\nnature of the forms in question,\" as has been demonstrated by MacDougal\r\nin the case of the common evening-primrose, _Oenothera biennis_. \"It is\r\nevident that to study the behavior of the characters of plants we must\r\nhave them in their simplest combinations; to investigate the origin and\r\nmovements of species we must deal with them singly and uncomplicated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[63]\r\n\r\nLECTURE III\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SPECIES OF CULTIVATED PLANTS\r\n\r\nRecalling the results of the last lecture, we see that the species of\r\nthe systematists are not in reality units, though in the ordinary course\r\nof floristic studies they may, as a rule, seem to be so. In some cases\r\nrepresentatives of the same species from different countries or regions,\r\nwhen compared with one another do not exactly agree. Many species of\r\nferns afford instances of this rule, and Lindley and other great\r\nsystematists have frequently been puzzled by the wide range of\r\ndifferences between the individuals of a single species.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the differing forms are observed to grow near each other,\r\nsometimes in neighboring provinces, sometimes in the same locality,\r\ngrowing and flowering in mixtures of two or three or even more\r\nelementary types. The violets exhibit widespread ancient types, from\r\nwhich the local species may be taken to have arisen. The common\r\nancestors of the Whitlow-grasses are probably not to be found [64] among\r\nexisting forms, but numerous types are crowded together in the southern\r\npart of central Europe and more thinly scattered elsewhere, even as far\r\nas western Asia. There can be little doubt that their common origin is\r\nto be sought in the center of their geographic distribution.\r\n\r\nNumerous other cases exhibit smaller numbers of elementary units within\r\na systematic species; in fact purely uniform species seem to be\r\nrelatively rare. But with small numbers there are of course no\r\nindications to be expected concerning their common origin or the\r\nstarting point of their distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that these experiences with wild species must find a\r\nparallel among cultivated plants. Of course cultivated plants were\r\noriginally wild and must have come under the general law. Hence we may\r\nconclude that when first observed and taken up by man, they must already\r\nhave consisted of sundry elementary subspecies. And we may confidently\r\nassert that some must have been rich and others poor in such types.\r\n\r\nGranting this state of things as the only probable one, we can easily\r\nimagine what must have been the consequences. If a wild species had been\r\ntaken into cultivation only once, the cultivated form would have been a\r\nsingle elementary [65] type. But it is not very likely that such\r\npartiality would occur often. The conception that different tribes at\r\ndifferent times and in distant countries would have used the wild plants\r\nof their native regions seems far more natural than that all should have\r\nobtained plants for cultivation from the same source or locality. If\r\nthis theory may be relied upon, the origin of many of the more widely\r\ncultivated agricultural plants must have been multiple, and the number\r\nof the original elementary species of the cultivated types must have\r\nbeen so much the larger, the more widely distributed and variable the\r\nplants under consideration were before the first period of cultivation.\r\n\r\nFurther it would seem only natural to explain the wide variability of\r\nmany of our larger agricultural and horticultural stocks by such an\r\nincipient multiformity of the species themselves. Through commercial\r\nintercourse the various types might have become mixed so as to make it\r\nquite impossible to point out the native localities for each of them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately historical evidence on this point is almost wholly\r\nlacking. The differences in question could not have been appreciated at\r\nthat remote period, and interest the common observer but little even\r\ntoday. The history of most of the cultivated plants is very obscure,\r\n[66] and even the most skillful historians, by sifting the evidence\r\nafforded by the older writers, and that obtained by comparative\r\nlinguistic investigations have been able to do little more than frame\r\nthe most general outline of the cultural history of the most common and\r\nmost widely used plants.\r\n\r\nSome authors assume that cultivation itself might have been the\r\nprincipal cause of variability, but it is not proved, nor even probable,\r\nthat cultivated plants are intrinsically more variable than their wild\r\nprototypes. Appearances in this case are very deceptive. Of course\r\nwidely distributed plants are as a rule richer in subspecies than forms\r\nwith limited distribution, and the former must have had a better chance\r\nto be taken into cultivation than the latter. In many cases, especially\r\nwith the more recent cultivated species, man has deliberately chosen\r\nvariable forms, because of their greater promise. Thirdly, wide\r\nvariability is the most efficient means of acclimatization, and only\r\nspecies with many elementary units would have offered the adequate\r\nmaterial for introduction into new countries.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion it would seem that it is more reasonable to assert\r\nthat variability is one of the causes of the success of cultivation,\r\nthan to assume that cultivation is a cause of variability [67] at large.\r\nAnd this assumption would be equally sufficient to explain the existing\r\nconditions among cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nOf course I do not pretend to say that cultivated plants should be\r\nexpected to be less variable than in the wild state, or that swarms of\r\nelementary species might not be produced during cultivation quite as\r\nwell as before. However the chance of such an event, as is easily seen,\r\ncannot be very great, and we shall have to be content with a few\r\nexamples of which the coconut is a notable one.\r\n\r\nLeaving this general discussion of the subject, we may take up the\r\nexample of the beets. The sugar-beet is only one type from among a horde\r\nof others, and though the origin of all the single types is not\r\nhistorically known, the plant is frequently found in the wild state even\r\nat the present time, and the native types may be compared with the\r\ncorresponding cultivated varieties.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of beets for sugar is not of very ancient date. The\r\nRomans knew the beets and used them as vegetables, both the roots and\r\nthe leaves. They distinguished a variety with white and one with red\r\nflesh, but whether they cultivated them, or only collected them from\r\nwhere they grew spontaneously, appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[68] Beets are even now found in large quantities along the shores of\r\nItaly. They prefer the vicinity of the sea, as do so many other members\r\nof the beet family, and are not limited to Italy, but are found growing\r\nelsewhere on the littoral of the Mediterranean, in the Canary Islands\r\nand through Persia and Babylonia to India. In most of their native\r\nlocalities they occur in great abundance.\r\n\r\nThe color of the foliage and the size of the roots are extremely\r\nvariable. Some have red leafstalks and veins, others a uniform red or\r\ngreen foliage, some have red or white or yellow roots, or exhibit\r\nalternating rings of a red and of a white tinge on cut surfaces. It\r\nseems only natural to consider the white and the red, and even the\r\nvariegated types as distinct varieties, which in nature do not\r\ntransgress their limits nor change into one another. In a subsequent\r\nlecture I will show that this at least is the rule with the\r\ncorresponding color-varieties in other genera.\r\n\r\nThe fleshiness or pulpiness of the roots is still more variable. Some\r\nare as thick as the arm and edible, others are not thicker than a finger\r\nand of a woody composition, and the structure of this woody variety is\r\nvery interesting. The sugar-beet consists, as is generally known, of\r\nconcentric layers of sugar-tissue and of vascular [69] strands; the\r\nlarger the first and the smaller the latter, the greater is, as a rule,\r\nthe average amount of sugar of the race. Through the kindness of the\r\nlate Mr. Rimpau, a well known German breeder of sugar-beet varieties, I\r\nobtained specimens from seed of a native wild locality near Bukharest.\r\nThe plants produced quite woody roots, showing almost no sugar tissue at\r\nall. Woody layers of strongly developed fibrovascular strands were seen\r\nto be separated one from another only by very thin layers of\r\nparenchymatous cells. Even the number of layers is variable; it was\r\nobserved to be five in my plants; but in larger roots double this number\r\nand even more may easily be met with.\r\n\r\nSome authors have distinguished specific types among these wild forms.\r\nWhile the cultivated beets are collected under the head of _Beta\r\nvulgaris_, separate types with more or less woody roots have been\r\ndescribed as _Beta maritima_ and _Beta patula_. These show differences\r\nin the habit of the stems and the foliage. Some have a strong tendency\r\nto become annual, others to become biennial. The first of course do not\r\nstore a large quantity of food in their roots, and remain thin, even at\r\nthe time of flowering. The biennial types occur in all sizes of roots.\r\nIn the annuals the stems may vary from [70] erect to ascending, and the\r\nname _patula_ indicates stems which are densely branching from the base\r\nwith widely spreading branches throughout. Mr. Em. von Proskowetz of\r\nKwassitz, Austria, kindly sent me seeds of this _Beta patula_, the\r\nvariability of which was so great in my cultures as to range from nearly\r\ntypical sugar-beets to the thin woody type of Bukharest.\r\n\r\nBroad and narrow leaves are considered to be differentiating marks\r\nbetween _Beta vulgaris_ and _Beta patula_, but even here a wide range of\r\nforms seem to occur.\r\n\r\nRimpau, Proskowetz, Schindler and others have made cultures of beets\r\nfrom wild localities in order to discover a hypothetical common ancestor\r\nof all the present cultivated types. These researches point to the _B.\r\npatula_ as the probable ancestor, but of course they were not made to\r\ndecide the question as to whether the origination of the several now\r\nexisting types had taken place before or during culture. From a general\r\npoint of view the variability of the wild species is parallel to that of\r\nthe cultivated forms to such a degree as to suggest the multiple origin\r\nof the former. But a close investigation of this highly important\r\nproblem has still to be made.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the cultivated beets are commonly [71] included in four\r\nsubspecies. The two smallest are the salad-beets and the ornamental\r\nforms, the first being used as food, and ordinarily cultivated in red\r\nvarieties, the second being used as ornamental plants during the fall,\r\nwhen they fill the beds left empty by summer flowers, with a bright\r\nfoliage that is exceedingly rich in form and color. Of the remaining\r\nsubspecies, one comprises the numerous sorts cultivated as forage-crops\r\nand the other the true sugar-beets. Both of them vary widely as to the\r\nshape and the size of the roots, the quality of the tissue, the foliage\r\nand other characteristics.\r\n\r\nSome of these forms, no doubt, have originated during culture. Most of\r\nthem have been improved by selection, and no beet found in the wild\r\nstate ever rivals any cultivated variety. But the improvement chiefly\r\naffects the size, the amount of sugar and nutrient substances and some\r\nother qualities which recur in most of the varieties. The varietal\r\nattributes themselves however, are more or less of a specific nature,\r\nand have no relation to the real industrial value of the race. The\r\nshort-rooted and the horn-shaped varieties might best be cited as\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that the sundry varieties of forage-beets are not the\r\nresult of artificial selection, [72] is supported in a large measure by\r\nthe historic fact that the most of them are far older than the method of\r\nconscious selection of plants itself. This method is due to Louis\r\nVilmorin and dates from the middle of the last century. But in the\r\nsixteenth century most of our present varieties of beets were already in\r\ncultivation. Caspar Bauhin gives a list of the beets of his time and it\r\nis not difficult to recognize in it a large series of subspecies and\r\nvarieties and even of special forms, which are still cultivated. A more\r\ncomplete list was published towards the close of the same century by\r\nOlivier de Serres in his world-renowned \"Theatre d'Agriculture\" (Paris,\r\n1600).\r\n\r\nThe red forage-beets which are now cultivated on so large a scale, had\r\nbeen introduced from Italy into France only a short time before.\r\n\r\nFrom this historic evidence, the period during which the beets were\r\ncultivated from the time of the Romans or perhaps much later, up to the\r\ntime of Bauhin and De Serres, would seem far too short for the\r\nproduction by the unguided selection of man of all the now existing\r\ntypes. On the other hand, the parallelism between the characters of some\r\nwild and some cultivated varieties goes to make it very probable that\r\nother varieties have been found in the same way, some in this country\r\nand others in that, [73] and have been taken into cultivation\r\nseparately. Afterwards of course all must have been improved in the\r\ndirection required by the needs of man.\r\n\r\nQuite the same conclusion is afforded by apples. The facts are to some\r\nextent of another character, and the rule of the derivation of the\r\npresent cultivated varieties from original wild forms can be illustrated\r\nin this case in a more direct way. Of course we must limit ourselves to\r\nthe varieties of pure ancestry and leave aside all those which are of\r\nhybrid or presumably hybrid origin.\r\n\r\nBefore considering their present state of culture, something must be,\r\nsaid about the earlier history and the wild state of the apples.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree is a common shrub in woods throughout all parts of\r\nEurope, with the only exception of the extreme north. Its distribution\r\nextends to Anatolia, the Caucasus and Ghilan in Persia. It is found in\r\nnearly all forests of any extent and often in relatively large numbers\r\nof individuals. It exhibits varietal characters, which have led to the\r\nrecognition of several spontaneous forms, especially in France and in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe differentiating qualities relate to the shape and indumentum of the\r\nleaves. Nothing is known botanically as to differences between [74] the\r\nfruits of these varieties, but as a matter of fact the wild apples of\r\ndifferent countries are not at all the same.\r\n\r\nAlphonse De Candolle, who made a profound study of the probable origin\r\nof most of our cultivated plants, comes to the conclusion that the apple\r\ntree must have had this wide distribution in prehistoric times, and that\r\nits cultivation began in ancient times everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis very important conclusion by so high an authority throws\r\nconsiderable light on the relation between cultivated and wild varieties\r\nat large. If the historic facts go to prove a multiple origin for the\r\ncultivation of some of the more important useful plants, the probability\r\nthat different varieties or elementary species have been the starting\r\npoints for different lines of culture, evidently becomes stronger.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this historic evidence is scanty. The most interesting\r\nfacts are those concerning the use of apples by the Romans and by their\r\ncontemporaries of the Swiss and middle European lake-dwellings. Oswald\r\nHeer has collected large numbers of the relics of this prehistoric\r\nperiod. Apples were found in large quantities, ordinarily cut into\r\nhalves and with the signs of having been dried. Heer distinguished two\r\nvarieties, one with large and one with small fruits. The first about 3\r\nand [75] the other about 1.5-2 cm. in diameter. Both are therefore very\r\nsmall compared with our present ordinary varieties, but of the same\r\ngeneral size as the wild forms of the present day. Like these, they must\r\nhave been of a more woody and less fleshy tissue. They would scarcely\r\nhave been tasteful to us, but in ancient times no better varieties were\r\nknown and therefore no comparison was possible.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence concerning the question, as to whether during the\r\nperiods mentioned apples were cultivated or only collected in the wild\r\nstate. The very large numbers which are found, have induced some writers\r\nto believe in their culture, but then there is no reason why they should\r\nnot have been collected in quantity from wild shrubs. The main fact is\r\nthat the apple was not a uniform species in prehistoric times but showed\r\neven then at least some amount of variability.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the wild apples are very rich in elementary species.\r\nThose of Versailles are not the same as those of Belgium, and still\r\nothers are growing in England and in Germany. The botanical differences\r\nderived from the blossoms and the leaves are slight, but the flavor,\r\nsize and shape of the fruits diverge widely. Two opinions have been\r\nadvanced to explain this high degree of variability, but [76] neither of\r\nthem conveys a real explanation; their aim is chiefly to support\r\ndifferent views as to the causes of variability, and the origin of\r\nelementary species at large.\r\n\r\nOne opinion, advocated by De Candolle, Darwin and others, claims that\r\nthe varieties owe their origin to the direct influence of cultivation,\r\nand that the corresponding forms found in the wild state, are not at all\r\noriginal, but have escaped from cultivation and apparently become wild.\r\nOf course this possibility cannot be denied, at least in any single\r\ninstance, but it seems too sweeping an assertion to make for the whole\r\nrange of observed forms.\r\n\r\nThe alternative theory is that of van Mons, the Belgian originator of\r\ncommercial varieties of apples, who has published his experiments in a\r\nlarge work called \"Arbres fruitiers ou Pomonomie belge.\" Most of the\r\nmore remarkable apples of the first half of the last century were\r\nproduced by van Mons, but his greatest merit is not the direct\r\nproduction of a number of good varieties, but the foundation of the\r\nmethod, by which new varieties may be obtained and improved.\r\n\r\nAccording to van Mons, the production of a new variety consists chiefly\r\nof two parts. The first is the discovery of a subspecies with new\r\ndesirable qualities. The second is the transformation [77] of the\r\noriginal small and woody apple into a large, fleshy and palatable\r\nvariety. Subspecies, or what we now call elementary species were not\r\nproduced by man; nature alone creates new forms, as van Mons has it. He\r\nexamined with great care the wild apples of his country, and especially\r\nthose of the Ardennes, and found among them a number of species with\r\ndifferent flavors. For the flavor is the one great point, which must be\r\nfound ready in nature and which may be improved, but can never be\r\ncreated by artificial selection. The numerous differences in flavor are\r\nquite original; all of them may be found in the wild state and most of\r\nthem even in so limited a region as the Ardennes Mountains. Of course\r\nvan Mons preferred not to start from the wild types themselves, when the\r\nsame flavor could be met with in some cultivated variety. His general\r\nmethod was, to search for a new flavor and to try to bring the bearer of\r\nit up to the desired standard of size and edibility.\r\n\r\nThe latter improvement, though it always makes the impression of an\r\nachievement, is only the last stone to be added to the building up of\r\nthe commercial value of the variety. Without it, the best flavored apple\r\nremains a crab; with it, it becomes a conquest. According to the method\r\nof van Mons it may be reached within [78] two or three generations, and\r\na man's life is wholly sufficient to produce in this way many new types\r\nof the very best sorts, as van Mons himself has done. It is done in the\r\nusual way, sowing on a large scale and selecting the best, which are in\r\ntheir turn brought to an early maturation of their fruit by grafting,\r\nbecause thereby the life from seed to seed may be reduced to a few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nForm, taste, color, flavor and other valuable marks of new varieties are\r\nthe products of nature, says van Mons, only texture, fleshiness and size\r\nare added by man. And this is done in each new variety by the same\r\nmethod and according to the same laws. The richness of the cultivated\r\napples of the present day was already present in the large range of\r\noriginal wild elementary species, though unobserved and requiring\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAn interesting proof of this principle is afforded by the experience of\r\nMr. Peter M. Gideon, as related by Bailey. Gideon sowed large quantities\r\nof apple-seeds, and one seed produced a new and valuable variety called\r\nby him the \"Wealthy\" apple. He first planted a bushel of apple-seeds,\r\nand then every year, for nine years, planted enough seeds to produce a\r\nthousand trees. At the end of ten years all seedlings had perished\r\nexcept one hardy seedling [79] crab. This experiment was made in\r\nMinnesota, and failed wholly. Then he bought a small lot of seeds of\r\napples and crab-apples in Maine and from these the \"Wealthy\" came. There\r\nwere only about fifty seeds in the lot of crab-apple seed which produced\r\nthe \"Wealthy,\" but before this variety was obtained, more than a bushel\r\nof seed had been sown. Chance afforded a species with an unknown taste;\r\nbut the growing of many thousands of seedlings of known varieties was\r\nnot the best means to get something really new.\r\n\r\nPears are more difficult to improve than apples. They often require six\r\nor more generations to be brought from the wild woody state to the\r\nordinary edible condition. But the varieties each seem to have a\r\nseparate origin, as with apples, and the wide range of form and of taste\r\nmust have been present in the wild state, long before cultivation. Only\r\nrecently has the improvement of cherries, plums, currants and\r\ngooseberries been undertaken with success by Mr. Burbank, and the\r\ndifference between the wild and cultivated forms has hitherto been very\r\nsmall. All indications point to the existence, before the era of\r\ncultivation, of larger or smaller numbers of elementary species.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good with many of the larger forage crops and other\r\nplants of great industrial [80] value. Clover exhibits many varieties,\r\nwhich have been cultivated indiscriminately, and often in motley\r\nmixtures. The flower heads may be red or white, large or small,\r\ncylindric or rounded, the leaves are broader or narrower, with or\r\nwithout white spots of a curious pattern. They may be more or less hairy\r\nand so forth. Even the seeds exhibit differences in size, shape or\r\ncolor, and of late Martinet has shown, that by the simple means of\r\npicking out seeds of the same pattern, pure strains of clover may be\r\nobtained, which are of varying cultural value. In this way the best\r\nsubspecies or varieties may be sought out for separate cultivation. Even\r\nthe white spots on the leaflets have proved to be constant characters\r\ncorresponding with noticeable differences in yield.\r\n\r\nFlax is another instance. It was already cultivated, or at least made\r\nuse of during the period of the lake-dwellers, but at that time it was a\r\nspecies referred to as _Linum angustifolium_, and not the _Linum\r\nusitatissimum_, which is our present day flax. There are now many\r\nsubspecies, elementary species, and varieties under cultivation. The\r\noldest of them is known as the \"springing flax,\" in opposition to the\r\nordinary \"threshing flax.\" It has capsules which open of themselves, in\r\norder to disseminate the seeds, while the ordinary heads of the [81]\r\nflax remain closed until the seeds are liberated by threshing. It seems\r\nprobable that the first form or _Linum crepitans_ might thrive in the\r\nwild state as well as any other plant, while in the common species those\r\nqualities are lacking which are required for a normal dissemination of\r\nthe seeds. White or blue flowers, high or dwarf stems, more or less\r\nbranching at the base and sundry other qualities distinguish the\r\nvarieties, aside from the special industrial difference of the fibres.\r\nEven the life-history varies from annual and biennial, to perennial.\r\n\r\nIt would take us too long to consider other instances. It is well known\r\nthat corn, though considered as a single botanical species, is\r\nrepresented by different subspecies and varieties in nearly every region\r\nin which it is grown. Of course its history is unknown and it is\r\nimpossible to decide whether all the tall and dwarf forms, or starchy\r\nand sweet varieties, dented or rounded kernels, and hundreds of others\r\nare older than culture or have come into existence during historic\r\ntimes, or as some assume, through the agency of man. But our main point\r\nnow is not the origin, but only the existence of constant and sharply\r\ndifferentiated forms within botanical species. Nearly every cultivated\r\nplant affords instances of such diversity. Some include a few types\r\nonly, while [82] others show, a large number of forms clearly separated\r\nto a greater or lesser degree.\r\n\r\nIn some few instances it is obvious that this variability is of later\r\ndate than culture. The most conspicuous case is that of the coconut.\r\nThis valuable palm is found on nearly all tropical coasts, in America,\r\nas well as in Asia, but in Africa and Australia there are many hundreds\r\nof miles of shore line, where it is not found. Its importance is not at\r\nall the same everywhere. On the shores and islands of the Indian Ocean\r\nand the Malay Archipelago, man is chiefly dependent upon it, but in\r\nAmerica it is only of subordinate usefulness.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these facts, it abounds in subspecies and varieties\r\nin the East Indian regions, but on the continent of America little\r\nattention has as yet been given to its diverging qualities. In the\r\nMalayan region it affords nearly all that is required by the\r\ninhabitants. The value of its fruit as food, and the delicious beverage\r\nwhich it yields, are well known. The fibrous rind is not less useful; it\r\nis manufactured into a kind of cordage, mats and floor-cloths. An\r\nexcellent oil is obtained from the kernel by compression. The hard\r\ncovering of the stem is converted into drums and used in the\r\nconstruction of huts; the lower part is so hard as to take on a\r\nbeautiful polish [83] when it resembles agate. Finally the unexpanded\r\nterminal bud is a delicate article of food. Many other uses could be\r\nmentioned, but these may suffice to indicate how closely the life of the\r\ninhabitants is bound up with the culture of this palm, and how sharply,\r\nin consequence, its qualities must have been watched by early man. Any\r\ndivergence from the ordinary type must have been noted; those which were\r\ninjurious must have been rejected, but the useful ones must have been\r\nappreciated and propagated. In a word any degree of variability afforded\r\nby nature must have been noticed and cultivated.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty different sorts of the coconut are described from the\r\nIndian shores and islands, with distinct local and botanical names.\r\nMiquel, who was one of the best systematists of tropical plants, of the\r\nlast century, described a large number of them, and since, more have\r\nbeen added. Nearly all useful qualities vary in a higher or lesser\r\ndegree in the different varieties. The fibrous strands of the rind of\r\nthe nut are developed in some forms to such a length and strength as to\r\nyield the industrial product known as the coir-fibre. Only three of them\r\nare mentioned by Miquel that have this quality, the _Cocos nucifera\r\nrutila_, _cupuliformis_ and _stupposa_. Among them the _rutila_ [84]\r\nyields the best and most supple fibres, while those of the _stupposa_\r\nare stiff and almost unbending.\r\n\r\nThe varieties also differ greatly in size, color, shape and quality, and\r\nthe trees have also peculiar characteristics. One variety exhibits\r\nleaves which are nearly entire, the divisions being only imperfectly\r\nseparated, as often occurs in the very first leaves of the seedlings of\r\nother varieties. The flavor of the flesh, oil and milk likewise yield\r\nmany good varietal marks.\r\n\r\nIn short, the coconut-palm comes under the general rule, that botanical\r\nspecies are built up of a number of sharply distinguishable types, which\r\nprove their constancy and relative independence by their wide\r\ndistribution in culture. In systematic works all these forms are called\r\nvarieties, and a closer investigation of their real systematic value has\r\nnot yet been made. But the question as to the origin of the varieties\r\nand of the coconut itself has engrossed the attention of many botanists,\r\namong whom are De Candolle in the middle of the last century, and Cook\r\nat its close.\r\n\r\nBoth questions are closely connected. De Candolle claimed an Asiatic\r\norigin for the whole species, while Cook's studies go to prove that its\r\noriginal habitat is to be sought in the northern countries of South\r\nAmerica. Numerous [85] varieties are growing in Asia and have as yet not\r\nbeen observed to occur in America, where the coconut is only of\r\nsubordinate importance, being one of many useful plants, and not the\r\nonly one relied upon by the natives for their subsistence. If therefore,\r\nDe Candolle's opinion is the right one, the question as to whether the\r\nvarieties are older or younger than the cultivated forms of the species,\r\nmust always remain obscure. But if the proofs of an American origin\r\nshould be forthcoming, the possibility, and even the probability that\r\nthe varieties are of later date than the beginning of their culture, and\r\nhave originated while in this condition must at once be granted. An\r\nimportant point in the controversy is the manner in which the coconuts\r\nwere disseminated from shore to shore, from island to island. De\r\nCandolle, Darwin and most of the European writers claim that the\r\ndispersal was by natural agencies, such as ocean-currents. They point\r\nout that the fibrous rind or husk would keep the fruits afloat, and\r\nuninjured, for many days or even many weeks, while being carried from\r\none country to another in a manner that would explain their geographic\r\ndistribution. But the probability of the nuts being thrown upon the\r\nstrand, and far enough from the shore to find suitable conditions for\r\ntheir germination, is a very small one. To insure [86] healthy and\r\nvigorous seedlings the nuts must be fully ripe, after which planting\r\ncannot be safely delayed for more than a few weeks. If kept too moist\r\nthe nuts rot. If once on the shore, and allowed to lie in the sun, they\r\nbecome overheated and are thereby destroyed; if thrown in the shade of\r\nother shrubs and trees, the seedlings do not find the required\r\nconditions for a vigorous growth.\r\n\r\nSome authors have taken the fibrous rind to be especially adapted to\r\ntransport by sea, but if this were so, this would argue that water is\r\nthe normal or at least the very frequent medium of dissemination, which\r\nof course it is not. We may, claim with quite as much right that the\r\nthick husk is necessary to enable the heavy fruit to drop from tall\r\ntrees with safety. But even for this purpose the protection is not\r\nsufficient, as the nuts often suffer from falling to such a degree as to\r\nbe badly injured as to their germinating qualities. It is well known\r\nthat nuts, which are destined for propagation, are as a rule not allowed\r\nto fall off, but are taken from the trees with great care.\r\n\r\nSumming up his arguments, Cook concludes that there is little in the way\r\nof known facts to support the poetic theory of the coconut palm dropping\r\nits fruits into the sea to float away to barren islands and prepare them\r\nfor [87] human habitation. Shipwrecks might furnish a successful method\r\nof launching viable coconuts, and such have no doubt sometimes\r\ncontributed to their distribution. But this assumption implies a\r\ndissemination of the nuts by man, and if this principal fact is granted,\r\nit is far more natural to believe in a conscious intelligent\r\ndissemination.\r\n\r\nThe coconut is a cultivated tree. It may be met with in some spots\r\ndistant from human dwellings, but whenever such cases have been\r\nsubjected to a closer scrutiny, it appears that evidently, or at least\r\nprobably, huts had formerly existed in their neighborhood, but having\r\nbeen destroyed by some accident, had left the palm trees uninjured. Even\r\nin South America, where it may be found in forests at great distances\r\nfrom the sea-shore, it is not at all certain that true native localities\r\noccur, and it seems to be quite lost in its natural condition.\r\n\r\nGranting the cultivated state of the palms as the only really important\r\none, and considering the impossibility or at least great improbability\r\nof its dissemination by natural means, the distribution by man himself,\r\naccording to his wants, assumes the rank of an hypothesis fully adequate\r\nto the explanation of all the facts concerning the life-history of the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nWe now have to inquire into the main question, [88] whether it is\r\nprobable that the coconut is of American or of Asiatic origin, leaving\r\naside the historic evidence which goes to prove that nothing is known\r\nabout the period in which its dissemination from one hemisphere to\r\nanother took place, we will now consider only the botanic and geographic\r\nevidence, brought forward by Cook. He states that the whole family of\r\ncoconut-palms, consisting of about 20 genera and 200 species, are all\r\nstrictly American with the exception of the rather aberrant African\r\noilpalm, which has, however, an American relative referred to the same\r\ngenus. The coconut is the sole representative of this group which is\r\nconnected with Asia and the Malayan region, but there is no manifest\r\nreason why other members of the same group could not have established\r\nthemselves there, and maintained an existence under conditions, which\r\nare not at all unfavorable to them. The only obvious reason is the\r\nassumption already made, that the distribution was brought about by man,\r\nand thus only affected the species, chosen by him for cultivation. That\r\nthe coconut cannot have been imported from Asia into America seems to be\r\nthe most obvious conclusion from the arguments given. It should be\r\nbriefly noted, that it was known and widely distributed in tropical\r\nAmerica at the time of the discovery of that continent [89] by Columbus,\r\naccording to accounts of Oviedo and other contemporary Spanish writers.\r\n\r\nConcluding we may state that according to the whole evidence as it has\r\nbeen discussed by De Candolle and especially by Cook, the coconut-palm\r\nis of American origin and has been distributed as a cultivated tree by\r\nman through the whole of its wide range. This must have happened in a\r\nprehistoric era, thus affording time enough for the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of the fifty and more known varieties. But the possibility\r\nthat at least some of them have originated before culture and have been\r\ndeliberately chosen by man for distribution, of course remains\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\nCoconuts are not very well adapted for natural dispersal on land, and\r\nthis would rather induce us to suppose an origin within the period of\r\ncultivation for the whole group. There are a large number of cultivated\r\nvarieties of different species which by some peculiarity do not seem\r\nadapted for the conditions of life in the wild state. These last have\r\noften been used to prove the origin of varietal forms during culture.\r\nOne of the oldest instances is the variety or rather subspecies of the\r\nopium-poppy, which lacks the ability to burst open its capsules. The\r\nseeds, which are thrown out by the wind, in the common forms, through\r\nthe apertures underneath [90] the stigma, remain enclosed. This is\r\nmanifestly a very useful adaptation for a cultivated plant, as by this\r\nmeans no seeds are lost. It would be quite a disadvantage for a wild\r\nspecies, and is therefore claimed to have been connected from the\r\nbeginning with the cultivated form.\r\n\r\nThe large kernels of corn and grain, of beans and peas, and even of the\r\nlupines were considered by Darwin and others to be unable to cope with\r\nnatural conditions of life. Many valuable fruits are quite sterile, or\r\nproduce extremely few seeds. This is notoriously the case with some of\r\nthe best pears and grapes, with the pine-apples, bananas, bread-fruits,\r\npomegranate and some members of the orange tribe. It is open to\r\ndiscussion as to what may be the immediate cause of this sterility, but\r\nit is quite evident, that all such sterile varieties must have\r\noriginated in a cultivated condition. Otherwise they would surely have\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\nIn horticulture and agriculture the fact that new varieties arise from\r\ntime to time is beyond all doubt, and it is not this question with which\r\nwe are now concerned. Our arguments were only intended to prove that\r\ncultivated species, as a rule, are derived from wild species, which obey\r\nthe laws discussed in a previous lecture. The botanic units are compound\r\nentities, and [91] the real systematic units in elementary species play\r\nthe same part as in ordinary wild species. The inference that the origin\r\nof the cultivated plants is multiple, in most cases, and that more than\r\none, often many separate elementary forms of the same species must\r\noriginally have been taken into cultivation, throws much light upon many\r\nhighly important problems of cultivation and selection. This aspect of\r\nthe question will therefore be the subject of the next lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[92]\r\n\r\nLECTURE IV\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF ELEMENTARY SPECIES\r\n\r\nThe improvement of cultivated plants must obviously begin with already\r\nexisting forms. This is true of old cultivated sorts as well as for\r\nrecent introductions. In either case the starting-point is as important\r\nas the improvement, or rather the results depend in a far higher degree\r\non the adequate choice of the initial material than on the methodical\r\nand careful treatment of the chosen varieties. This however, has not\r\nalways been appreciated as it deserves, nor is its importance at present\r\nuniversally recognized. The method of selecting plants for the\r\nimprovement of the race was discovered by Louis Vilmorin about the\r\nmiddle of the last century. Before his time selection was applied to\r\ndomestic animals, but Vilmorin was the first to apply this principle to\r\nplants. As is well known, he used this method to increase the amount of\r\nsugar in beets and thus to raise their value as forage-crops, with such\r\nsuccess, that his plants have since been used for the production [93] of\r\nsugar. He must have made some choice among the numerous available sorts\r\nof beets, or chance must have placed in his hands one of the most\r\nappropriate forms. On this point however, no evidence is at hand.\r\n\r\nSince the work of Vilmorin the selection-principle has increased\r\nenormously in importance, for practical purposes as well as for the\r\ntheoretical aspect of the subject. It is now being applied on a large\r\nscale to nearly all ornamental plants. It is the one great principle now\r\nin universal practice as well as one of preeminent scientific value. Of\r\ncourse, the main arguments of the evolution theory rest upon\r\nmorphologic, systematic, geographic and paleontologic evidence. But the\r\nquestion as to how we can coordinate the relation between existing\r\nspecies and their supposed ancestors is of course one of a physiologic\r\nnature. Direct observation or experiments were not available for Darwin\r\nand so he found himself constrained to make use of the experience of\r\nbreeders. This he did on a broad scale, and with such success that it\r\nwas precisely this side of his arguments that played the major part in\r\nconvincing his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe work of the breeders previous to Darwin's time had not been very\r\ncritically performed. Recent analyses of the evidence obtained [94] from\r\nthem show that numerous types of variability were usually thrown\r\ntogether. What type in each case afforded the material, which the\r\nbreeder in reality made use of, has only been inquired into in the last\r\nfew decades. Among those who have opened the way for thorough and more\r\nscientific treatment are to be mentioned Rimpau and Von Rumker of\r\nGermany and W.M. Hays of America.\r\n\r\nVon Rumker is to be considered as the first writer, who sharply\r\ndistinguished between two phases of methodical breeding-selection. One\r\nside he calls the production of new forms, the other the improvement of\r\nthe breed. He dealt with both methods extensively. New forms are\r\nconsidered as spontaneous variations occurring or originating without\r\nhuman aid. They have only to be selected and isolated, and their progeny\r\nat once yields a constant and pure race. This race retains its character\r\nas long as it is protected against the admixture of other minor\r\nvarieties, either by cross-pollination, or by accidental seeds.\r\n\r\nImprovement, on the other hand, is the work of man. New varieties of\r\ncourse can only be isolated if chance offers them; the improvement is\r\nnot incumbent on chance. It does not create really anything new, but\r\ndevelops characters, which were already existing. It brings [95] the\r\nrace above its average, and must guard constantly against the regression\r\ntowards this average which usually takes place.\r\n\r\nHays has repeatedly insisted upon the principle of the choice of the\r\nmost favorable varieties as the foundation for all experiments in\r\nimproving races. He asserts that half the battle is won by choosing the\r\nvariety which is to serve as a foundation stock, while the other half\r\ndepends upon the selection of parent-plants within the chosen variety.\r\nThus the choice of the variety is the first principle to be applied in\r\nevery single case; the so-called artificial selection takes only a\r\nsecondary place. Calling all minor units within the botanic species by\r\nthe common name of varieties, without regard to the distinction between\r\nelementary species and retrograde varieties, the principle is designated\r\nby the term of \"variety-testing.\" This testing of varieties is now, as\r\nis universally known, one of the most important lines of work of the\r\nagricultural experiment stations. Every state and every region, in some\r\ninstances even the larger farms, require a separate variety of corn, or\r\nwheat, or other crops. They must be segregated from among the hundreds\r\nof generally cultivated forms, within each single botanic species. Once\r\nfound, the type may be ameliorated according to the local conditions\r\n[96] and needs, and this is a question of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe fact that our cultivated plants are commonly mixtures of different\r\nsorts, has not always been known. The first to recognize it seems to\r\nhave been the Spanish professor of botany, Mariano Lagasca, who\r\npublished a number of Spanish papers dealing with useful plants and\r\nbotanical subjects between 1810 and 1830, among them a catalogue of\r\nplants cultivated in the Madrid Botanical Garden. Once when he was on a\r\nvisit to Colonel Le Couteur on his farm in Jersey, one of the Channel\r\nIslands off the coast of France, in discussing the value of the fields\r\nof wheat, he pointed out to his host, that they were not really pure and\r\nuniform, as was thought at that time, and suggested the idea that some\r\nof the constituents might form a larger part in the harvest than others.\r\nIn a single field he succeeded in distinguishing no less than 23\r\nvarieties, all growing together. Colonel Le Couteur took the hint, and\r\nsaved the seeds of a single plant of each supposed variety separately.\r\nThese he cultivated and multiplied till he got large lots of each and\r\ncould compare their value. From among them he then chose the variety\r\nproducing the greatest amount of the finest, whitest and most nutritious\r\nflour. This he eventually placed in the [97] market under the name of\r\n\"Talavera de Bellevue.\" It is a tall, white variety, with long and\r\nslender white heads, almost without awns, and with fine white pointed\r\nkernels. It was introduced into commerce about 1830, and is still one of\r\nthe most generally cultivated French wheats. It was highly prized in the\r\nmagnificent collection of drawings and descriptions of wheats, published\r\nby Vilmorin under the title \"Les meilleurs bles\" and is said to have\r\nquite a number of valuable qualities, branching freely and producing an\r\nabundance of good grain and straw. It is however, sensitive to cold\r\nwinters in some degree and thereby limited in its distribution. Hallett,\r\nthe celebrated English wheat-breeder, tried in vain to improve the\r\npeculiar qualities of this valuable production of Le Couteur's.\r\n\r\nLe Couteur worked during many years along this line, long before the\r\ntime when Vilmorin conceived the idea of improvement by race selections,\r\nand he used only the simple principle of distinguishing and isolating\r\nthe members of his different fields. Later he published his results in a\r\nwork on the varieties, peculiarities and classification of wheat (1843),\r\nwhich though now very rare, has been the basis and origin of the\r\nprinciple of variety-testing.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Lagasca and Le Couteur was [98] of course not\r\napplicable to the wheat of Jersey alone. The common cultivated sorts of\r\nwheat and other grains were mixtures then as they are even now. Improved\r\nvarieties are, or at least should be, in most cases pure and uniform,\r\nbut ordinary sorts, as a rule, are mixtures. Wheat, barley and oats are\r\nself-fertile and do not mix in the field through cross-pollination.\r\nEvery member of the assemblage propagates itself, and is only checked by\r\nits own greater or less adaptation to the given conditions of life.\r\nRimpau has dealt at large with the phenomenon as it occurs in the\r\nnorthern and middle parts of Germany. Even Rivett's \"Bearded wheat,\"\r\nwhich was introduced from England as a fine improved variety, and has\r\nbecome widely distributed throughout Germany, cannot keep itself pure.\r\nIt is found mingled almost anywhere with the old local varieties, which\r\nit was destined to supplant. Any lot of seed exhibits such impurities,\r\nas I have had the opportunity of observing myself in sowings in the\r\nexperimental-garden. But the impurities are only mixtures, and all the\r\nplants of Rivett's \"Bearded wheat,\" which of course constitute the large\r\nmajority, are of pure blood. This may be confirmed when the seeds are\r\ncollected and sown separately in cultures that can be carefully guarded.\r\n\r\n[99] In order to get a closer insight into the causes of this confused\r\ncondition of ordinary races, Rimpau made some observations on Rivett's\r\nwheat. He found that it suffers from frost during winter more than the\r\nlocal German varieties, and that from various causes, alien seeds may\r\naccidentally, and not rarely, become mixed with it. The\r\nthreshing-machines are not always as clean as they should be and may be\r\nthe cause of an accidental mixture. The manure comes from stables, where\r\nstraw and the dust from many varieties are thrown together, and\r\nconsequently living kernels may become mixed with the dung. Such stray\r\ngrains will easily germinate in the fields, where they find more\r\ncongenial conditions than does the improved variety. If winter arrives\r\nand kills quantities of this latter, the accidental local races will\r\nfind ample space to develop. Once started, they will be able to multiply\r\nso rapidly, that in one or two following generations they will\r\nconstitute a very considerable portion of the whole harvest. In this way\r\nthe awnless German wheat often prevails over the introduced English\r\nvariety, if the latter is not kept pure by continuous selection.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss wheat-breeder Risler made an experiment which goes to prove\r\nthe certainty of the explanation given by Rimpau. He observed on his\r\nfarm at Saleves near the lake of Geneva that after a lapse of time the\r\n\"Galland wheat\" deteriorated and assumed, as was generally believed, the\r\ncharacters of the local sorts. In order to ascertain the real cause of\r\nthis apparent change, he sowed in alternate rows in a field, the\r\n\"Galland\" and one of the local varieties. The \"Galland\" is a race with\r\nobvious characters and was easily distinguished from the other at the\r\ntime when the heads were ripe. They are bearded when flowering, but\r\nafterwards throw off the awns. The kernels are very large and yield an\r\nextraordinarily good, white flour.\r\n\r\nDuring the first summer all the heads of the \"Galland\" rows had the\r\ndeciduous awns but the following year these were only seen on half of\r\nthe plants, the remainder having smooth heads, and the third year the\r\n\"Galland\" had nearly disappeared, being supplanted by the competing\r\nlocal race. The cause of this rapid change was found to be twofold.\r\nFirst the \"Galland,\" as an improved variety, suffers from the winter in\r\na far higher degree than the native Swiss sorts, and secondly it ripens\r\nits kernels one or two weeks later. At the time of harvest it may not\r\nhave become fully ripe, while the varieties mixed with it had reached\r\nmaturity. The wild oat, _Avena fatua_, is very common in [101] Europe\r\nfrom whence it has been introduced in the United States. In summers\r\nwhich are unfavorable to the development of the cultivated oats it may\r\nbe observed to multiply with an almost incredible rapidity. It does not\r\ncontribute to the harvest, and is quite useless. If no selection were\r\nmade, or if selection were discontinued, it would readily supplant the\r\ncultivated varieties.\r\n\r\nFrom these several observations and experiments it may be seen, that it\r\nis not at all easy to keep the common varieties of cereals pure and that\r\neven the best are subject to the encroachment of impurities. Hence it is\r\nonly natural that races of cereals, when cultivated without the utmost\r\ncare, or even when selected without an exact knowledge of their single\r\nconstituents, are always observed to be more or less in a mixed\r\ncondition. Here, as everywhere with cultivated and wild plants, the\r\nsystematic species consist of a number of minor types, which pertain to\r\ndifferent countries and climates, and are growing together in the same\r\nclimate and under the same external conditions. They do not mingle, nor\r\nare their differentiating characters destroyed by intercrossing. They\r\neach remain pure, and may be isolated whenever and wherever the\r\ndesirability for such a proceeding should arise. The purity of [102] the\r\nraces is a condition implanted in them by man, and nature always strives\r\nagainst this arbitrary and one-sided improvement. Numerous slight\r\ndifferences in characters and numerous external influences benefit the\r\nminor types and bring them into competition with the better ones.\r\nSometimes they tend to supplant the latter wholly, but ordinarily sooner\r\nor later a state of equilibrium is reached, in which henceforth the\r\ndifferent sorts may live together. Some are favored by warm and others\r\nby cool summers, some are injured by hard winters while others thrive\r\nthen and are therefore relatively at an advantage. The mixed condition\r\nis the rule, purity is the exception.\r\n\r\nDifferent sorts of cereals are not always easily distinguishable by the\r\nlayman and therefore I will draw your attention to conditions in\r\nmeadows, where a corresponding phenomenon can be observed in a much\r\nsimpler way.\r\n\r\nOnly artificial pasture-grounds are seen to consist of a single species\r\nof grass or clover. The natural condition in meadows is the occurrence\r\nof clumps of grasses and some clovers, mixed up with perhaps twenty or\r\nmore species of other genera and families. The numerical proportion of\r\nthese constituents is of great interest, and has been studied at\r\nRothamstead in England and on a number of other farms. It is [103]\r\nalways changing. No two successive years show exactly the same\r\nproportions. At one time one species prevails, at another time one or\r\ntwo or more other species. The weather during the spring and summer\r\nbenefits some and hurts others, the winter may be too cold for some, but\r\nagain harmless for others, the rainfall may partly drown some species,\r\nwhile others remain uninjured. Some weeds may be seen flowering\r\nprofusely during some years, while in other summers they are scarcely to\r\nbe found in the same meadow. The whole population is in a fluctuating\r\nstate, some thriving and others deteriorating. It is a continuous\r\nresponse to the ever changing conditions of the weather. Rarely a\r\nspecies is wholly annihilated, though it may apparently be so for years;\r\nbut either from seeds or from rootstocks, or even from neighboring\r\nlands, it may sooner or later regain its foothold in the general\r\nstruggle for life.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is a very curious and interesting one. The struggle for\r\nlife, which plays so considerable a part in the modern theories of\r\nevolution, may be seen directly at work. It does not alter the species\r\nthemselves, as is commonly supposed, but it is always changing their\r\nnumerical proportion. Any lasting change in the external conditions will\r\nof course alter the average oscillation and the influence [104] of such\r\nalterations will manifest itself in most cases simply in new numerical\r\nproportions. Only extremes have extreme effects, and the chance for the\r\nweaker sorts to be completely overthrown is therefore very small.\r\n\r\nAny one, who has the opportunity of observing a waste field during a\r\nseries of years, should make notes concerning the numerical proportions\r\nof its inhabitants. Exact figures are not at all required; approximate\r\nestimates will ordinarily prove to be sufficient, if only the standard\r\nremains the same during the succeeding years.\r\n\r\nThe entire mass of historic evidence goes to prove that the same\r\nconditions have always prevailed, from the very beginning of cultivation\r\nup to the present time. The origin of the cultivation of cereals is to\r\nbe sought in central Asia. The recent researches of Solms Laubach show\r\nit to be highly probable that the historic origin of the wheat\r\ncultivated in China, is the same as that of the wheat of Egypt and\r\nEurope. Remains of cereals are found in the graves of Egyptian mummies,\r\nin the mounds of waste material of the lake-dwellings of Central Europe,\r\nand figures of cereals are to be seen on old Roman coins. In the\r\nsepulchre of King Ra-n-Woser of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who lived\r\nabout 2000 years B.C., two [105] tombs have recently been opened by the\r\nGerman Oriental Society. In them were found quantities of the tares of\r\nthe _Triticum dicoccum_, one of the more primitive forms of wheat. In\r\nother temples and pyramids and among the stones of the walls of Dashur\r\nand El Kab studied by Unger, different species and varieties of cereals\r\nwere discovered in large quantities, that showed their identity with the\r\npresent prevailing cultivated races of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the lake-dwellings in Switzerland possessed some\r\nvarieties of cereals, which have entirely disappeared. They are\r\ndistinguished by Heer under special names. The small barley and the\r\nsmall wheat of the lake-dwellers are among them. All in all there were\r\nten well distinguished varieties of cereals, the Panicum and the Setaria\r\nor millet being of the number. Oats were evidently introduced only\r\ntoward the very last of the lake-dwelling period, and rye is of far\r\nlater introduction into western Europe. Similar results are attained by\r\nthe examination of the cereals figured by the Romans of the same period.\r\n\r\nAll these are archaeologic facts, and give but slight indications\r\nconcerning the methods of cultivation or the real condition of the\r\ncultivated races of that time. Virgil has left us some knowledge of the\r\nrequirements of methodical [106] culture of cereals of his time. In his\r\npoem _Georgics_ (I. 197) the following lines are found:\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Vidi lecta din, et multo spectata labore\r\n   Degenerare tamen, ni vis humana quotannis\r\n   Maxima quaeque manu legeret_.\r\n\r\n   (The chosen seed, through years and labor improved,\r\n   Was seen to run back, unless yearly\r\n   Man selected by hand the largest and fullest of ears.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere Virgil and also some lines of Columella and Varro go to prove\r\nin the same way that selection was applied by the Romans to their\r\ncereals, and that it was absolutely necessary to keep their races pure.\r\nThere is little doubt, but that it was the same principle as that which\r\nhas led, after many centuries, to the complete isolation and improvement\r\nof the very best races of the mixed varieties. It further proves that\r\nthe mixed conditions of the cereals was known to man at that time,\r\nalthough distinct ideas of specific marks and differences were of course\r\nstill wholly lacking. It is proof also that cultivated cereals from the\r\nearliest times must have been built up of numerous elementary forms.\r\nMoreover it is very probable, that in the lapse of centuries a goodly\r\nnumber of such types must have disappeared. [107] Among the vanished\r\nforms are the special barley and wheat of the lake-dwellings, the\r\nremains of which have been accidentally preserved, but most of the forms\r\nmust have disappeared without leaving any trace.\r\n\r\nThis inference is supported by the researches of Solms-Laubach, who\r\nfound that in Abyssinia numerous primitive types of cereals are still in\r\nculture. They are not adequate to compete with our present varieties,\r\nand would no doubt also have disappeared, had they not been preserved by\r\nsuch quite accidental and almost primitive isolation.\r\n\r\nClosing this somewhat long digression into history we will now resume\r\nour discussion concerning the origin of the method of selecting cereals\r\nfor isolation and segregate-cultivation. Some decades after Le Couteur,\r\nthis method was taken up by the celebrated breeder Patrick Sheriff of\r\nHaddington in Scotland. His belief, which was general at that time, was\r\n\"That cultivation has not been found to change well defined kinds, and\r\nthat improvement can be best attained by selecting new and superior\r\nvarieties, which nature occasionally produces, as if inviting the\r\nhusbandman to stretch forth his hand and cultivate them.\"\r\n\r\nBefore going into the details of Sheriff's work it is as well to say\r\nsomething concerning [108] the use of the word \"selection.\" This word\r\nwas used by Sheriff as seen in the quotation given, and it was obviously\r\ndesigned to convey the same idea as the word \"lecta\" in the quotation\r\nfrom Virgil. It was a choice of the best plants from among known mixed\r\nfields, but the chosen individuals were considered to be representatives\r\nof pure and constant races, which could only be isolated, but not\r\nameliorated. Selection therefore, in the primitive sense of the word, is\r\nthe choice of elementary species and varieties, with no other purpose\r\nthan that of keeping them as pure as possible from the admixture of\r\nminor sorts. The Romans attained this end only imperfectly, simply\r\nbecause the laws governing the struggle for life and the competition of\r\nnumerous sorts in the fields were unsuspected by them.\r\n\r\nLe Couteur and Sheriff succeeded in the solution of the problem, because\r\nthey had discovered the importance of isolation. The combination of a\r\ncareful choice with subsequent isolation was all they knew about it, and\r\nit was one of the great achievements to which modern agriculture owes\r\nits success.\r\n\r\nThe other great principle was that of Vilmorin. It was the improvement\r\nwithin the race, or the \"amelioration of the race\" as it was termed by\r\nhim. It was introduced into [109] England by F.F. Hallett of Brighton in\r\nSussex, who at once called it \"pedigree-culture,\" and produced his first\r\nnew variety under the very name of \"Pedigree-wheat.\" This principle,\r\nwhich yields improved strains, that are not constant but dependent on\r\nthe continued and careful choice of the best plants in each succeeding\r\ngeneration, is now generally called \"selection.\" But it should always be\r\nremembered that according to the historic evolution of the idea, the\r\nword has the double significance of the distinction and isolation of\r\nconstant races from mixtures, and that of the choice of the best\r\nrepresentatives of a race during all the years of its existence. Even\r\nsugar-beets, the oldest \"selected\" agricultural plants, are far from\r\nhaving freed themselves from the necessity of continuous improvement.\r\nWithout this they would not remain constant, but would retrograde with\r\ngreat rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe double meaning of the word selection still prevailed when Darwin\r\npublished his \"Origin of Species.\" This was in the year 1859, and at\r\nthat time Shirreff was the highest authority and the most successful\r\nbreeder of cereals. Vilmorin's method had been applied only to beets,\r\nand Hallett had commenced his pedigree-cultures only a few years before\r\nand his first publication of the \"Pedigree-wheat\" [110] appeared some\r\nyears later at the International Exhibition of London in 1862. Hence,\r\nwhenever Darwin speaks of selection, Shirreff's use of the word may as\r\nwell be meant as that of Vilmorin.\r\n\r\nHowever, before going deeper into such theoretical questions, we will\r\nfirst consider the facts, as given by Shirreff himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the best part of his life, in fact during the largest part of the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century, Shirreff worked according to a\r\nvery simple principle. When quite young he had noticed that sometimes\r\nsingle plants having better qualities than the average were seen in the\r\nfields. He saved the grains, or sometimes the whole heads of such plants\r\nseparately, and tried to multiply them in such manner as to avoid\r\nintermixtures.\r\n\r\nHis first result was the \"Mungoswell's wheat.\" In the spring of 1819 he\r\nobserved quite accidentally in a field of the farm of that name, a\r\nsingle plant which attracted his attention by a deeper green and by\r\nbeing more heavily headed out. Without going into further details, he at\r\nonce chose this specimen as the starting point of a new race. He\r\ndestroyed the surrounding plants so as to give it more space, applied\r\nmanure to its roots, and tended it with special care. It yielded 63\r\nheads and nearly [111] 2500 grains. All of these were sown the\r\nfollowing fall, and likewise in the succeeding years the whole harvest\r\nwas sown in separate lots. After two years of rapid multiplication it\r\nproved to be a good new variety and was brought into commerce. It has\r\nbecome one of the prominent varieties of wheat in East Lothian, that\r\ncounty of Scotland of which Haddington is the principal borough.\r\n\r\nThe grains of \"Mungoswell's wheat\" are whiter than those of the allied\r\n\"Hunter's wheat,\" more rounded but otherwise of the same size acid\r\nweight. The straw is taller and stronger, and each plant produces more\r\nculms and more heads.\r\n\r\nShirreff assumed, that the original plant of this variety was a sport\r\nfrom the race in which he had found it, and that it was the only\r\ninstance of this sport. He gives no details about this most interesting\r\nside of the question, omitting even to tell the name of the parent\r\nvariety. He only asserts that it was seen to be better, and afterwards\r\nproved so by the appreciation of other breeders and its success in\r\ntrade. He observed it to be quite constant from the beginning, no\r\nsubsequent selection being needed. This important feature was simply\r\nassumed by him to be true as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n[112] Some years afterwards, in the summer of 1824, he observed a large\r\nspecimen of oats in one of the fields of the same farm. Being at that\r\ntime occupied in making a standard collection of oats for a closer\r\ncomparison of the varieties, he saved the seeds of that plant and sowed\r\nthem in a row in his experiment-field. It yielded the largest culms of\r\nthe whole collection and bore long and heavy kernels with a red streak\r\non the concave side and it excelled all other sorts by the fine\r\nqualities of its very white meal. In the unequal length of its stalks it\r\nhas however a drawback, as the field appears thinner and more meager\r\nthan it is in reality. \"Hopetown oats,\" as it is called, has found its\r\nway into culture extensively in Scotland and has even been introduced\r\nwith success into England, Denmark and the United States. It has been\r\none of the best Scottish oats for more than half a century.\r\n\r\nThe next eight years no single plant judged worthy of selection on his\r\nown farm attracted Shirreff's attention. But in the fall of 1832 he saw\r\na beautiful plant of wheat on a neighboring farm and he secured a head\r\nof it with about 100 grains. From this he produced the \"Hopetown wheat.\"\r\nAfter careful separation from the kernels this original ear was\r\npreserved, and was afterwards exhibited at the Stirling Agricultural\r\n[113] Museum. The \"Hopetown wheat\" has proved to be a constant variety,\r\nexcelling the ordinary \"Hunter's wheat\" by larger grains and longer\r\nheads; it yields likewise a straw of superior quality and has become\r\nquite popular in large districts of England and Scotland, where it is\r\nknown by the name of \"White Hunter's\" from its origin and the brilliant\r\nwhiteness of its heads.\r\n\r\nIn the same way Shirreff's oats were discovered in a single plant in a\r\nfield where it was isolated in order to be brought into commerce after\r\nmultiplication. It has won the surname of \"Make-him-rich.\" Nothing is on\r\nrecord about the details of its origin.\r\n\r\nFour valuable new varieties of wheat and oats were obtained in this way\r\nin less than forty years. Then Shirreff changed his ideas and his method\r\nof working. Striking specimens appeared to be too rare, and the\r\nexpectation of a profitable result too small. Therefore he began work on\r\na larger scale. He sought and selected during the summer of 1857 seventy\r\nheads of wheat, each from a single plant showing some marked and\r\npresumably favorable peculiarity. These were not gathered on one field,\r\nbut were brought together from all the fields to which he had access in\r\nhis vicinity. The grains of each of these selected heads were [114] sown\r\nseparately, and the lots compared during their whole life-period and\r\nchiefly at harvest time. Three of the lots were judged of high\r\nexcellence, and they alone were propagated, and proving to be constant\r\nnew varieties from the outset were given to the trade under the names of\r\n\"Shirreff's bearded white,\" \"Shirreff's bearded red,\" and \"Pringle's\r\nwheat.\" They have found wide acceptance, and the first two of them are\r\nstill considered by Vilmorin as belonging to the best wheats of France.\r\n\r\nThis second method of Shirreff evidently is quite analogous to the\r\nprinciple of Lagasca and Le Couteur. The previous assumption that new\r\nvarieties with striking features were being produced by nature from time\r\nto time, was abandoned, and a systematic inquiry into the worth of all\r\nthe divergent constituents of the fields was begun. Every single ear at\r\nonce proved to belong to a constant and pure race, but most of these\r\nwere only of average value. Some few however, excelled to a degree,\r\nwhich made them worth multiplying, and to be introduced into trade as\r\nseparate varieties.\r\n\r\nOnce started, this new method of comparison, selection and isolated\r\nmultiplication was of course capable of many improvements. The culture\r\nin the experiment-field was improved, so as to insure a fuller and more\r\nrapid growth.\r\n\r\n[115] The ripe heads had to be measured and counted and compared with\r\nrespect to their size and the number of their kernels. Qualities of\r\ngrain and of meal had to be considered, and the influence of climate and\r\nsoil could not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nConcerning the real origin of his new types Shirreff seems never to have\r\nbeen very inquisitive. He remarks that only the best cultivated\r\nvarieties have a chance to yield still better types, and that it is\r\nuseless to select and sow the best heads of minor sorts. He further\r\nremarks that it is not probable that he found a new sport every time; on\r\nthe contrary he assumes that his selections had been present in the\r\nfield before, and during a series of succeeding generations. How many\r\nyears old they were, was of course impossible to determine. But there is\r\nno reason to believe that the conditions in the fields of Scotland were\r\ndifferent from those observed on the Isle of Jersey by Le Couteur.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1862 Shirreff devoted himself to the selection of oats,\r\nsearching for the best panicles from the whole country, and comparing\r\ntheir offspring in his experimental garden. \"Early Fellow,\" \"Fine\r\nFellow,\" \"Longfellow\" and \"Early Angus\" are very notable varieties\r\nintroduced into trade in this way.\r\n\r\n[116] Some years later Patrick Shirreff described his experiments and\r\nresults in a paper entitled, \"On the improvement of cereals,\" but the\r\ndescriptions are very short, and give few details of systematic value.\r\nThe leading principle, however, is clearly indicated, and anyone who\r\nstudies with care his method of working, may confidently attempt to\r\nimprove the varieties of his own locality in the same way.\r\n\r\nThis great principle of \"variety-testing,\" as it has been founded by Le\r\nCouteur and Patrick Shirreff, has increased in importance ever since.\r\nTwo main features are to be considered here. One is the production of\r\nlocal races, the other the choice of the best starting-point for\r\nhybridizing experiments, as is shown in California by the work of Luther\r\nBurbank in crossing different elementary species of _Lilium pardalinum_\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nEvery region and locality has its own conditions of climate and soil.\r\nAny ordinary mixed race will contain some elementary forms which are\r\nbetter adapted to a given district, while others are more suitable to\r\ndivergent conditions. Hence it can readily be inferred that the choice\r\ncannot be the same for different regions. Every region should select its\r\nown type from among the various forms, and variety testing therefore\r\nbecomes a task which every [117] one must undertake under his own\r\nconditions. Some varieties will prove, after isolation, to be profitable\r\nfor large districts and perhaps for whole states. Others will be found\r\nto be of more local value, but in such localities to excel all others.\r\n\r\nAs an example we may take one of the varieties of wheat originated by\r\nthe Minnesota Experiment Station. Hays described it as follows. It was\r\noriginated from a single plant. From among 400 plants of \"Blue stem\"\r\nseveral of the best were chosen, each growing separately, a foot apart\r\nin every direction. Each of the selected plants yielded 500 or more\r\ngrains of wheat, weighing 10 or more grams. The seeds from these\r\nselected plants were raised for a few years until sufficient was\r\nobtained to sow a plot. Then for several years the new strains were\r\ngrown in a field beside the parent-variety. One of them was so much\r\nsuperior that all others were discarded. It was the one named \"Minnesota\r\nNo. 169.\" For a large area of Minnesota this wheat seems capable of\r\nyielding at least 1 or 2 bushels more grain per acre than its parent\r\nvariety, which is the best kind commonly and almost universally found on\r\nthe farms in southern and central Minnesota.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite superfluous for our present purpose to give more\r\ninstances. The fact of [118] the compound nature of so-called species of\r\ncultivated plants seems to be beyond all doubt, and its practical\r\nimportance is quite obvious.\r\n\r\nAcclimatization is another process, which is largely dependent on the\r\nchoice of adequate varieties. This is shown on a large scale by the slow\r\nand gradual dispersion of the varieties of corn in this country. The\r\nlargest types are limited to temperate and subtropical regions, while\r\nthe varieties capable of cultivation in more northern latitudes are\r\nsmaller in size and stature and require a smaller number of days to\r\nreach their full development from seed to seed. Northern varieties are\r\nsmall and short lived, but the \"Forty-day-corn\" or \"Quarantino maize\" is\r\nrecorded to have existed in tropical America at the time of Columbus. In\r\npreference, or rather to the entire exclusion of taller varieties, it\r\nhas thriven on the northern boundaries of the corn-growing states of\r\nEurope since the very beginning of its cultivation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Naudin, the same rule prevails with melons, cucumbers and\r\ngherkins, and other instances could easily be given.\r\n\r\nReferring now to the inferences that may be drawn from the experience of\r\nthe breeders in order to elucidate the natural processes, we will return\r\nto the whitlow-grasses and pansies.\r\n\r\n[119] Nature has constituted them as groups of slightly different\r\nconstant forms, quite in the same way as wheat and oats and corn.\r\nAssuming that this happened ages ago somewhere in central Europe, it is\r\nof course probable that the same differences in respect to the influence\r\nof climatic conditions will have prevailed as with cereals. Subsequent\r\nto the period which has produced the numerous elementary species of the\r\nwhitlow-grass came a period of widespread distribution. The process must\r\nhave been wholly comparable with that of acclimatization. Some species\r\nmust have been more adapted to northern climates, others to the soils of\r\nwestern or eastern regions and so on. These qualities must have decided\r\nthe general lines of the distribution, and the species must have been\r\nsegregated according to their respective climatic qualities, and their\r\nadaptability to soil and weather. A struggle for life and a natural\r\nselection must have accompanied and guided the distribution, but there\r\nis no reason to assume that the various forms were changed by this\r\nprocess, and that we see them now endowed with other qualities than they\r\nhad at the outset.\r\n\r\nNatural selection must have played, in this and in a large number of\r\nother cases, quite the same part as the artificial method of variety\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\n[120] Indeed it may be surmised that this has been its chief and\r\nprominent function. Taking up again our metaphor of the sieve we can\r\nassert that in such cases climate and soil exercise sifting action and\r\nin this way the application of the metaphor becomes more definite. Of\r\ncourse, next to the climate and soil in importance, come ecological\r\nconditions, the vegetable and animal enemies of the plants and other\r\ninfluences of the same nature.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is to be pointed out that this side of the problem of\r\nnatural selection and the struggle for life appears to offer the best\r\nprospects for experimental, or for continued statistical inquiry. Direct\r\nobservations are possible and any comparison of numerical proportions of\r\nspecies in succeeding years affords clear proof of the part it plays.\r\nAnd above all, such observations can be made quite independently of\r\ndoubtful theoretical considerations about presumed changes of character.\r\n\r\nThe fact of natural selection is plain and it should be studied in its\r\nmost simple conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[121]\r\nC. RETROGRADE VARIETIES\r\n\r\nLECTURE V\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF RETROGRADE VARIETIES\r\n\r\nEvery one admires the luxuriance of garden-flowers, and their diversity\r\nof color and form. All parts of the world have contributed to their\r\nnumber and every taste can find its preference among them. New forms\r\nproduced by the skill of the breeder are introduced every year. This has\r\nbeen done mostly by crossing and intermingling the characters of\r\nintroduced species of the same genus. In some of the cases the history\r\nof our flowers is so old that their hybrid origin is forgotten, as in\r\nthe case of the pansies. Hybridizations are still going on in other\r\ngroups on a large scale, and new forms are openly claimed to be of\r\nhybrid origin.\r\n\r\nBreeders and amateurs generally have more interest in the results than\r\nin the way in which they have been brought about. Excellent flowers and\r\nfruit recommend themselves and there seems to be no reason for inquiring\r\n[122] about their origin. In some cases the name of the originator may\r\nbe so widely known that it adds weight to the value of the new form, and\r\ntherefore may advantageously be coupled with it. The origin and history\r\nof the greater part of our garden-flowers, fruits and vegetables are\r\nobscure; we see them as they are, and do not know from whence they came.\r\nThe original habitat for a whole genus or for a species at large, may be\r\nknown, but questions as to the origin of the single forms, of which it\r\nis built up, ordinarily remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons we are restricted in most cases to the comparison of\r\nthe forms before us. This comparison has led to the general use of the\r\nterm \"variety\" in opposition to \"species.\" The larger groups of forms,\r\nwhich are known to have been introduced as such are called species. All\r\nforms which by their characters belong to such a species are designated\r\nas varieties, irrespective of their systematic relation to the form,\r\nconsidered as the ancestor of the group.\r\n\r\nHence, we distinguish between \"hybrid varieties\" and \"pure varieties\"\r\naccording to their origin from different parents or from a single line\r\nof ancestors. Moreover, in both groups the forms may be propagated by\r\nseeds, or in the vegetative way by buds, by grafting or [123] by\r\ncutting, and this leads to the distinction of \"seed-varieties\" and\r\n\"vegetative varieties.\" In the first case the inheritance of the special\r\ncharacters through the seeds decides the status of the variety, in the\r\nlatter case this point is left wholly out of consideration.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside all these different types, we are concerned here only with\r\nthe \"seed-varieties\" of pure origin, or at least with those, that are\r\nsupposed to be so. Hybridization and vegetative multiplication of the\r\nhybrids no doubt occur in nature, but they are very rare, when compared\r\nwith the ordinary method of propagation by seed. \"Seed-varieties\" may\r\nfurther be divided into constant and inconstant ones. The difference is\r\nvery essential, but the test is not always easy to apply. Constant\r\nvarieties are as sharply defined and as narrowly limited as are the best\r\nwild species, while inconstant types are cultivated chiefly on account\r\nof their wide range of form and color. This diversity is repeated\r\nyearly, even from the purest seed. We will now discuss the constant\r\nseed-varieties, leaving the inconstant and eversporting types to a\r\nsubsequent lecture.\r\n\r\nIn this way we may make an exact inquiry into the departures from the\r\nspecies which are ordinarily considered to constitute the essential\r\ncharacter of such a constant and pure seed-variety [124] and need only\r\ncompare these differences with those that distinguish the elementary\r\nspecies of one and the same group from each other.\r\n\r\nTwo points are very striking. By far the greatest part of the ordinary\r\ngarden-varieties differ from their species by a single sharp character\r\nonly. In derivative cases two, three or even more such characters may be\r\ncombined in one variety, for instance, a dwarfed variety of the larkspur\r\nmay at the same time bear white flowers, or even double white flowers,\r\nbut the individuality of the single characters is not in the least\r\nobscured by such combinations.\r\n\r\nThe second point is the almost general occurrence of the same variety in\r\nextended series of species. White and double flowers, variegated leaves,\r\ndwarfs and many other instances may be cited. It is precisely this\r\nuniversal repetition of the same character that strikes us as the\r\nessential feature of a variety.\r\n\r\nAnd again these two characteristics may now be considered separately.\r\nLet us begin with the sharpness of the varietal characters. In this\r\nrespect varieties differ most obviously from elementary species. These\r\nare distinguished from their nearest allies in almost all organs. There\r\nis no prominent distinctive feature between the single forms of _Draba_\r\n[125] _Verna_, _Helianthemum_ or of _Taraxacum_; all characters are\r\nalmost equally concerned. The elementary species of _Draba_ are\r\ncharacterized, as we have seen, by the forms and the hairiness of the\r\nleaves, the number and height of the flower-stalks, the breadth and\r\nincision of the petals, the forms of the fruits, and so on. Every one of\r\nthe two hundred forms included in this collective species has its own\r\ntype, which it is impossible to express by a single term. Their names\r\nare chosen arbitrarily. Quite the contrary is the case with most of the\r\nvarieties, for which one word ordinarily suffices to express the whole\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nWhite varieties of species with red or blue flowers are the most common\r\ninstances. If the species has a compound color and if only one of the\r\nconstituents is lost, partially colored types arise as in _Agrostemma\r\nCoronaria bicolor_. Or the spots may disappear and the color become\r\nuniform as in _Gentiana punctata concolor_ and the spotless Arum or\r\n_Arum maculatum immaculatum_. Absence of hairs produces forms as\r\n_Biscutella laevigata glabra_; lack of prickles gives the varieties\r\nknown as _inermis, as for instance, _Ranunculus arvensis inermis_.\r\n_Cytisus prostratus_ has a variety _ciliata_, and _Solanum Dulcamara_,\r\nor the bitter-sweet, has a variety called _tomentosum_. The curious\r\nmonophyllous [126] variety of the strawberry and many other forms will\r\nbe discussed later.\r\n\r\nTo enlarge this list it would only be necessary to extract from a flora,\r\nor from a catalogue of horticultural plants, the names of the varieties\r\nenumerated therein. In nearly every instance, where true varieties and\r\nnot elementary species are concerned, a single term expresses the whole\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSuch a list would also serve to illustrate the second point since the\r\nsame names would recur frequently. Long lists of varieties are called\r\nalba, or inermis, or canescens or lutea, and many genera contain the\r\nsame appellations. In some instances the systematists use a diversity of\r\nnames to convey exactly the same idea, as if to conceal the monotony of\r\nthe character, as for instance in the case of the lack of hairs, which\r\nis expressed by the varietal names of _Papaver dubium glabrum_, _Arabis\r\nciliata glabrata_, _Arabis hirsuta glaberrima_, _Veronica spicata\r\nnitens_, _Amygdalus persica laevis_, _Paeonia corallina Leiocarpa_, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary we find elementary species in different genera based on\r\nthe greatest possible diversity of features. The forms of _Taraxacum_ or\r\n_Helianthemum_ do not repeat those of _Draba_ or _Viola_. In roses and\r\nbrambles the distinguishing features are characteristic of the type, as\r\n[127] they are evidently derived from it and limited to it. And this is\r\nso true that nobody claims the grade of elementary species for white\r\nroses or white brambles, but everyone recognizes that forms diverging\r\nfrom the nearest species by a single character only, are to be regarded\r\nas varieties.\r\n\r\nThis general conviction is the basis on which we may build up a more\r\nsharply defined distinction between elementary species and varieties. It\r\nis an old rule in systematic botany, that no form is to be constituted a\r\nspecies upon the basis of a single character. All authors agree on this\r\npoint; specific differences are derived from the totality of the\r\nattributes, not from one organ or one quality. This rule is intimately\r\nconnected with the idea that varieties are derived from species. The\r\nspecies is the typical, really existing form from which the variety has\r\noriginated by a definite change. In enumerating the different forms the\r\nspecies is distinguished by the term of genuine or typical, often only\r\nindicated as _a_ or the first; then follow the varieties sometimes in\r\norder of their degree of difference, sometimes simply in alphabetical\r\norder. In the case of elementary species there is no real type; no one\r\nof them predominates because all are considered to be equal in rank, and\r\nthe systematic species to which they [128] are referred is not a really\r\nexisting form, but is the abstraction of the common type of all, just as\r\nit is in the case of a genus or of a family.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the main points of this discussion, we find that elementary\r\nspecies are of equal rank and together build up the collective or\r\nsystematic ideal species. Varieties on the other hand are derived from a\r\nreal and commonly, still existing type.\r\n\r\nI hope that I have succeeded in showing that the difference between\r\nelementary species, or, as they are often called, smaller or subspecies,\r\non the one hand and varieties on the other, is quite a marked one.\r\nHowever, in order to recognize this principle it is necessary to limit\r\nthe term variety, to those propagating themselves by seed and are of\r\npure and not of hybrid origin.\r\n\r\nBut the principle as stated here, does not involve an absolute contrast\r\nbetween two groups of characters. It is more a difference in our\r\nknowledge and appreciation of them than a difference in the things\r\nthemselves. The characters of elementary species are, as a rule, new to\r\nus, while those of varieties are old and familiar. It seems to me that\r\nthis is the essential point.\r\n\r\nAnd what is it that makes us familiar with them? Obviously the\r\ncontinuous recurrence of the same changes, because by a constant\r\nrepetition they must of course lose their novelty.\r\n\r\n[129] Presently we shall look into these characters more in detail and\r\nthen we shall find that they are not so simple as might be supposed at\r\nfirst sight; but precisely because we are so familiar with them, we\r\nreadily see that their different features really belong to a single\r\ncharacter; while in elementary species everything is so new that it is\r\nimpossible for us to discern the unities of the new attributes.\r\n\r\nIf we bear in mind all these difficulties we cannot wonder at the\r\nconfusion on this question that seems to prevail everywhere. Some\r\nauthors following Linnaeus simply call all the subdivisions of species,\r\nvarieties; others follow Jordan and avoid the difficulty by designating\r\nall smaller forms directly as species. The ablest systematists prefer to\r\nconsider the ordinary species as collective groups, calling their\r\nconstituents \"The elements of the species,\" as was done by A.P. De\r\nCandolle, Alph. De Candolle and Lindley.\r\n\r\nBy this method they clearly point out the difference between the\r\nsubdivisions of wild species as they ordinarily occur, and the varieties\r\nin our gardens, which would be very rare, were they not singled out and\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nOur familiarity with a character and our grounds for calling it an old\r\nacquaintance may result from two causes, which in judging a new [130]\r\nvariety are essentially different. The character in question may be\r\npresent in the given species or it may be lacking, but present in the\r\nother group. In the first case a variety can only be formed by the loss\r\nof the character, in the second case it arises by the addition of a new\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe first mode may be called a negative process, while the second is\r\nthen to be designated as positive. And as it is more easy to lose what\r\none has than to obtain something new, negative varieties are much more\r\ncommon than are positive ones.\r\n\r\nLet us now take an instance of a character that is apt to vary in both\r\nways, for this is obviously the best way of making clear what is meant\r\nby a negative and a positive change.\r\n\r\nIn the family of the composites we find a group of genera with two forms\r\nof florets on each flower-head. The hermaphrodite ones are tubular with\r\n5, or rarely 4, equal teeth, and occupy the center of the head. These\r\nare often called the flosculous florets or disk-florets. Those of the\r\ncircumference are ligulate and ordinarily unisexual, without stamens. In\r\nmany cases they are sterile, having only an imperfect ovary. They are\r\nlarge and brightly colored and are generally designated as ray-florets.\r\nAs instances we may cite the camomile (_Anthemis nobilis_), the wild\r\ncamomile (_Matricaria Chamomilla_), [131] the yarrow (_Achillea\r\nMillefolium_), the daisies, the Dahlia and many others. Species occur in\r\nthis group of plants from time to time that lack the ray-florets, as in\r\nthe tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_) and some _artemisias_. And the genus of\r\nthe marigolds or _Bidens_ is noted for containing both of these types.\r\nThe smaller and the three-toothed marigold (_B. cernua_ and _B.\r\ntripartita_) are very common plants of wet soil and swamps, ordinarily\r\nlacking the ray-florets, and in some countries they are very abundant\r\nand wholly constant in this respect, never forming radiate flower-heads.\r\nOn the other hand the white-flowered and the purple marigold (_B.\r\nleucantha_ and _B. atropurpurea_) are cultivated species of our gardens,\r\nprized for their showy flower-heads with large white or deeply colored,\r\nnearly black-purple florets.\r\n\r\nHere we have opportunity to observe positive and negative varieties of\r\nthe same character. The smaller, and the three-toothed marigold occur\r\nfrom time to time, provided with ray florets, showing a positive\r\nvariation. And the white marigold has produced in our gardens a variety\r\nwithout rays. Such varieties are quite constant, never returning to the\r\nold species. Positive and negative varieties of this kind are by no\r\nmeans rare among the compositae.\r\n\r\n[132] In systematic works the positive ones are as a rule called\r\n\"radiate,\" and the negative ones \"discoid.\" Discoid forms of the\r\nordinary camomile, of the daisy, of some asters (_Aster Tripolium_), and\r\nof some centauries have been described. Radiate forms have been observed\r\nin the tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_), the common horse-weed or Canada\r\nfleabane (_Erigeron canadensis_) and the common groundsel (_Senecio\r\nvulgaris_). Taken broadly the negative varieties seem to be somewhat\r\nmore numerous than the positive ones, but it is very difficult to come\r\nto a definite conclusion on this point.\r\n\r\nQuite the contrary is the case with regard to the color-varieties of red\r\nand blue flowers. Here the loss of color is so common that every one\r\ncould give long lists of examples of it. Linnaeus himself supposed that\r\nno blue or red-colored wild species would be without a white variety. It\r\nis well known that he founded his often criticized prescript never to\r\ntrust to color in recognizing or describing a species, on this belief.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are some red varieties of white-flowered\r\nspecies. But they are very rare, and little is known about their\r\ncharacters or constancy. Blue varieties of white species are not found.\r\nThe yarrow (_Achillea Millefolium_) has a red-flowered form, which\r\noccurs [133] from time to time in sunny and sandy localities. I have\r\nisolated it and cultivated it during a series of years and during many\r\ngenerations. It is quite true to its character, but the degree of its\r\ncoloring fluctuates between pink and white and is extremely variable.\r\nPerhaps it can be considered as an inconstant variety. A redflowered\r\nform of the common _Begonia semperflorens_ is cultivated under the name\r\nof \"Vernon,\" the white hawthorn (_Crataegus Oxyacantha_) is often seen\r\nwith red flowers, and a pink-flowered variety of the \"Silverchain\" or\r\n\"Bastard acacia\" (_Robinia Pseud-Acacia_) is not rarely cultivated. The\r\n\"Crown\" variety of the yellow wall-flower and the black varieties, are\r\nalso to be considered as positive color variations, the black being due\r\nin the latter cases to a very great amount of the red pigment.\r\n\r\nAmong fruits there are also some positive red varieties of greenish or\r\nyellowish species, as for instance the red gooseberry (_Ribes\r\nGrossularia_) and the red oranges. The red hue is far more common in\r\nleaves, as seen among herbs, in cultivated varieties of _Coleus_ and in\r\nthe brown leaved form of the ordinary white clover, among trees and\r\nshrubs in the hazelnut (_Corylus_), the beech (_Fagus_), the birch\r\n(_Betula_), the barberry (_Berberis_) and many others. But though most\r\nof these forms are very ornamental and abundant [134] in parks and\r\ngardens, little is as yet known concerning the origin of their varietal\r\nattributes and their constancy, when propagated by seeds. Besides the\r\nray-florets and the colors, there are of course a great many other\r\ncharacters in which varieties may differ from their species. In most of\r\nthe cases it is easy to discern whether the new character is a positive\r\nor a negative one. And it is not at all necessary to scrutinize very\r\nnarrowly the list of forms to become convinced that the negative form is\r\nthe one which prevails nearly everywhere, and that positive aberrations\r\nare in a general sense so rare that they might even be taken for\r\nexceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\nMany organs and many qualities may be lost in the origination of a\r\nvariety. In some instances the petals may disappear, as in _Nigella_, or\r\nthe stamens, as in the Guelder-rose (_Viburnum Opulus_) and the\r\n_Hortensia_ and in some bulbs even the whole flowers may be wanting, as\r\nin the beautiful \"Plumosa\" form of the cultivated grape-hyacinth or\r\n_Muscari comosum_. Fruits of the pineapples and bananas without seeds\r\nare on record as well as some varieties of apples and pears, of raisins\r\nand oranges. And some years ago Mr. Riviere of Algeria described a date\r\ngrowing in his garden that forms fruit without pits. The stoneless plum\r\nof Mr. [135] Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, is also a very curious\r\nvariety, the kernel of which is fully developed but naked, no hard\r\nsubstance intervening between it and the pulp.\r\n\r\nMore curious still are the unbranched varieties consisting of a single\r\nstem, as may be seen sometimes in the corn or maize and in the fir.\r\nFir-trees of some three or four meters in height without a single\r\nbranch, wholly naked and bearing leaves only on the shoots of the last\r\nyear's growth at the apex of the tree, may be seen. Of course they\r\ncannot bear seed, and so it is with the sterile maize, which never\r\nproduces any seed-spikes or staminate flowers. Other seedless varieties\r\ncan be propagated by buds; their origin is in most cases unknown, and we\r\nare not sure as to whether they should be classified with the constant\r\nor with the inconstant varieties.\r\n\r\nA very curious loss is that of starch in the grains of the sugar-corn\r\nand the sugar-peas. It is replaced by sugar or some allied substance\r\n(dextrine). Equally remarkable is the loss of the runners in the\r\nso-called \"Gaillon\" strawberries.\r\n\r\nAmong trees the pendulous or weeping, and the broomlike or fastigiate\r\nforms are very marked varieties, which occur in species belonging to\r\nquite different orders. The ash, the beach, some willows, many other\r\ntrees and some [136] finer species of garden-plants, as _Sophora\r\njaponica_, have given rise to weeping varieties, and the yew-tree or\r\n_Taxus_ has a fastigiate form which is much valued because of its\r\nascending branches and pyramidal habit. So it is with the pyramidal\r\nvarieties of oaks, elms, the bastard-acacia and some others.\r\n\r\nIt is generally acknowledged that these forms are to be considered as\r\nvarieties on the ground of their occurrence in so wide a range of\r\nspecies, and because they always bear the same attributes. The pendulous\r\nforms owe their peculiarity to a lengthening of the branches and a loss\r\nof their habit of growing upwards; they are too weak to retain a\r\nvertical position and the response to gravity, which is ordinarily the\r\ncause of the upright growth, is lacking in them. As far as we know, the\r\ncause of this weeping habit is the same in all instances. The fastigiate\r\ntrees and shrubs are a counterpart of the weeping forms. Here the\r\ntendency to grow in a horizontal direction is lacking, and with it the\r\nbilateral and symmetric structure of the branches has disappeared. In\r\nthe ordinary yew-tree the upright stem bears its needles equally\r\ndistributed around its circumference, but on the branches the needles\r\nare inserted in two rows, one to the left and one to the right. All the\r\nneedles turn their upper surfaces upwards, [137] and their lower\r\nsurfaces downwards, and all of them are by this means placed in a single\r\nhorizontal plane, and branching takes place in the same plane. Evidently\r\nthis general arrangement is another response to gravity, and it is the\r\nfailure of this reaction which induces the branches to grow upwards and\r\nto behave like stems.\r\n\r\nBoth weeping and fastigiate characters are therefore to be regarded as\r\nsteps in a negative direction, and it is highly important that even such\r\nmarked departures occur without transitions or intermediate forms. If\r\nthese should occur, though ever so rarely, they would probably have been\r\nbrought to notice, on account of the great prospect the numerous\r\ninstances would offer. The fact that they are lacking, proves that the\r\nsteps, though apparently great, are in reality to be considered as\r\ncovering single units, that cannot be divided into smaller parts.\r\nUnfortunately we are still in the dark as to the question of the\r\ninheritance of these forms, since in most cases it is difficult to\r\nobtain pure seed.\r\n\r\nWe now consider the cases of the loss of superficial organs, of which\r\nthe nectarines are example. These are smooth peaches, lacking the soft\r\nhairy down, that is a marked peculiarity of the true peaches. They occur\r\nin different [138] races of the peach. As early as the beginning of the\r\npast century, Gallesio described no less than eight subvarieties of\r\nnectarines, each related to a definite race of peach. Most of them\r\nreproduce themselves truly from seed, as is well known in this country\r\nconcerning the clingstones, freestones and some other types. Nectarines\r\nhave often varied, giving rise to new sorts, as in the case of the white\r\nnectarine and many others differing greatly in appearance and flavor. On\r\nthe other hand it is to be remarked, that the trees do not differ in\r\nother respects and cannot be distinguished while young, the varietal\r\nmark being limited to the loss of the down on the fruit. Peaches have\r\nbeen known to produce nectarines, and nectarines to yield true peaches.\r\nHere we have another instance of positive and negative steps with\r\nreference to the same character, but I cannot withhold an expression of\r\nsome doubt as to the possibility of crossing and subsequently splitting\r\nup of the hybrids as a more probable explanation of at least some of the\r\ncases quoted by various writers.\r\n\r\nSmooth or glabrous varieties often occur, and some of them have already\r\nbeen cited as instances of the multiplication of varietal names.\r\nPositive aberrations are rather rare, and are mostly restricted to a\r\ngreater density of the [139] pubescence in some hairy species, as in\r\n_Galeopsis Ladanum canescens_, _Lotus corniculatus hirsutus_ and so on.\r\nBut _Veronica scutellata_ is smooth and has a pubescent variety, and\r\nCytisus prostratus and _C. spinescens_ are each recorded to have a\r\nciliate form.\r\n\r\nComparable with the occurrence and the lack of hairs, is the existence\r\nor deficiency of the glaucous effect in leaves, as is well known in the\r\ncommon _Ricinus_. Here the glaucous appearance is due to wax distributed\r\nin fine particles over the surface of the leaves, and in the green\r\nvariety this wax is lacking. Other instances could be given as in the\r\ngreen varieties of _Papaver alpinum_ and _Rumex scutatus_. No positive\r\ninstances are recorded in this case.\r\n\r\nSpines and prickles may often disappear and give rise to unarmed and\r\ndefenceless types. Of the thorn-apples both species, the whiteflowered\r\n_Datura Stramonium_ and the purple _D. Tatula_ have such varieties.\r\nSpinach has a variety called the \"Dutch,\" which lacks the prickles of\r\nthe fruit; it is a very old form and absolutely constant, as are also\r\nthe thornless thorn-apples. Last year a very curious instance of a\r\npartial loss of prickles was discovered by Mr. Cockerell of East Las\r\nVegas in New Mexico. It is a variety of the American cocklebur, often\r\ncalled sea-burdock, or the [140] hedgehog-burweed, a stout and common\r\nweed of the western states. Its Latin name is _Xanthium canadense_ or\r\n_X. commune_ and the form referred to is named by Mr. Cockerell, _X.\r\nWootoni_, in honor of Professor E.o. Wooton who described the first\r\ncollected specimens.\r\n\r\nThe burs of the common species are densely covered with long prickles,\r\nwhich are slightly hooked at the apex. In the new form, which is similar\r\nin all other respects to the common cocklebur, the burs are more slender\r\nand the prickles much less numerous, about 25 to the bur and mostly\r\nstouter at the base. It occurs abundantly in New Mexico, always growing\r\nwith the common species, and seems to be quite constant from seed. Mr.\r\nCockerell kindly sent me some burs of both forms, and from these I\r\nraised in my garden last year a nice lot of the common, as well as of\r\nthe _Wootoni_ plants.\r\n\r\nSpineless varieties are recorded for the bastard-acacia, the holly and\r\nthe garden gooseberry (_Ribes Grossularia_, or _R. Uva-crispa_). A\r\nspineless sport of the prickly Broom (_Ulex europaeus_) has been seen\r\nfrom time to time, but it has not been propagated.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing facts, we have excellent evidence of varieties\r\nbeing produced either by the loss of some marked peculiarity or by the\r\nacquisition of others that are already [141] present in allied species.\r\nThere are a great many cases however, in which the morphologic cause of\r\nthe dissimilarity is not so easily discerned. But there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that most of them will be found to conform to the rule on closer\r\ninvestigation. Therefore we can consider the following as the principal\r\ndifference between elementary species and varieties; that the first\r\narise by the acquisition of entirely new characters, and the latter by\r\nthe loss of existing qualities or by the gain of such peculiarities as\r\nmay already be seen in other allied species.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose elementary species and varieties originated by sudden\r\nleaps or mutations, then the elementary species have mutated in the line\r\nof progression, some varieties have mutated in the line of\r\nretrogression, while others have diverged from their parental types in a\r\nline of depression, or in the way of repetition. This conception agrees\r\nquite well with the current idea that in the building up of the\r\nvegetable kingdom according to the theory of descent, it is species that\r\nform the links of the chain from the lower forms to the more highly\r\norganized later derivatives. Otherwise expressed, the system is built up\r\nof species, and varieties are only local and lateral, but never of real\r\nimportance for the whole structure.\r\n\r\n[142] Heretofore we have generally assumed, that varieties differ from\r\nthe parent-species in a single character only, or at least that only one\r\nneed be considered. We now come to the study of those varieties, which\r\ndiffer in more than one character. Of these there are two types. In the\r\nfirst the points of dissimilarity are intimately connected with one\r\nanother, in the second they are more or less independent.\r\n\r\nThe mutually related peculiarities may be termed correlative, and we\r\ntherefore speak, in such cases, of correlative variability. This\r\nphenomenon is of the highest importance and is of general occurrence.\r\nBut before describing some examples, it is as well to note that in the\r\nlecture on fluctuating variability, cases of a totally different nature\r\nwill be dealt with, which unfortunately are designated by the same term.\r\nSuch merely fluctuating variations are therefore to be left out of the\r\npresent discussion.\r\n\r\nThe purple thorn-apple, which is considered by some writers as a variety\r\nof the white-flowered species or _Datura Stramonium_, and by others as a\r\nseparate species, _D. Tatula_, will serve as an illustration. But as its\r\ndistinguishing attributes, as far as we are concerned with them here,\r\nare of the nature described above as characteristic of varietal\r\npeculiarities no objection [143] can be made to our using them as a case\r\nof correlative variability.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the purple thornapple lies in the color of\r\nthe flowers, which are of a very beautiful pale blue. But this color is\r\nnot limited to the corolla. It is also to be seen in the stems and in\r\nthe stalks and veins of the leaves, which are stained with a deep\r\npurple, the blue color being added to the original green. Even on the\r\nsurface of the leaves it may spread into a purplish hue. On the stems it\r\nis to be met with everywhere, and even the young seedlings show it. This\r\nis of some importance, as the young plants when unfolding their\r\ncotyledons and primary leaves, may be distinguished by this means from\r\nthe seedlings of the white flowered species.\r\n\r\nIn crossing experiments it is therefore possible to distinguish the\r\nwhites and the blues, even in young seedlings, and experience shows that\r\nthe correlation is quite constant. The color can always be relied upon;\r\nif lacking in the seedlings, it will be lacking in the stems and flowers\r\nalso; but if the axis of the young plant is ever so slightly tinged, the\r\ncolor will show itself in its beauty in the later stages of the life of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nThis is what we term correlation. The colors of the different organs are\r\nalways in agreement. It is true that they require the concurrence of\r\n[144] light for development, and that in the dark or in a faint light\r\nthe seedlings are apt to remain green when they should become purple,\r\nbut aside from such consideration all organs always come true to their\r\ncolor, whether pure green and white, or whether these are combined with\r\nthe blue tinge. This constancy is so absolute that the colors of the\r\ndifferent organs convey the suggestion, that they are only separate\r\nmarks of a single character.\r\n\r\nIt is on this suggestion that we must work, as it indicates the cause of\r\nthe correlation. Once present, the faculty of producing the anthocyan,\r\nthe color in question, will come into activity wherever and whenever\r\nopportunity presents itself. It is the cell-sap of the ordinary cell\r\ntissue or parenchyma, which is colored by the anthocyan, and for this\r\nreason all organs possessing this tissue, may exhibit the color in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThus the color is not a character belonging to any single organ or cell,\r\nnor is it bound to a morphologic unit; it is a free, physiologic\r\nquality. It is not localized, but belongs to the entire plant. If we\r\nwish to assume for its basis material representative particles, these\r\nparticles must be supposed to be diffused throughout the whole body of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nThis conception of a physiologic unit as the [145] cause of colors and\r\nother qualities is evidently opposed to the current idea of the cells\r\nand tissues as the morphologic units of the plants. But I do not doubt,\r\nthat in the long run it will recommend itself as much to the scientist\r\nas to the breeder. For the breeder, when desiring to keep his varieties\r\nup to their standard, or when breeding to a definite idea, obviously\r\nkeeps his standard and his ideal for the whole plant, even if he breeds\r\nonly for flowers or for fruit.\r\n\r\nI have chosen the color of the purple thornapple as a first example, but\r\nthe colors of other plants show so many diverging aspects, all pointing\r\nso clearly to the same conclusion, that it would be well to take a more\r\nextensive view of this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nFirst we must consider the correlation in the colors of flowers and\r\nfruits. If both are colored in the species, whether red or brown or\r\npurple or nearly black, and a variety lacking this hue is known, it will\r\nbe lacking in both organs. If the color is pure, the flowers and berries\r\nwill become white, but such cases are rare. Ordinarily a yellowish or\r\ngreenish tinge underlies the ornamental color, and if this latter\r\ndisappears, the yellowish ground will become manifest. So for instance\r\nin the Belladonna, a beautiful perennial herb with great shiny black,\r\nbut very poisonous, fruits. Its flowers are brown, but in [146] some\r\nwoods a variety with greenish flowers and bright yellow berries occurs,\r\nwhich is also frequently seen in botanic gardens. The anthocyan dye is\r\nlacking in both organs, and the same is the case with the stems and the\r\nleaves. The lady's laurel or _Daphne Mezereum_ has red corollas, purple\r\nleaves and red fruits; its white flowered variety may be distinguished\r\nby lack of the red hue in the stems and leaves, and by their beautiful\r\nyellow berries. Many other instances could be given, since the loss of\r\ncolor in berries is a very common occurrence, so common that for\r\ninstance, in the heath-family or Ericaceae, with only a few exceptions,\r\nall berry-bearing species have white-fruited varieties.\r\n\r\nThe same correlation is observed in the seeds. The white-flowered flax\r\nmay be seen to yield yellow and not brown seeds as in the blue species.\r\nMany varieties of flowers may be recognized by the color of their seeds,\r\nas in the poppies, stocks and others. Other white-flowered varieties may\r\nbe distinguished when germinating, their young axes being of a pure\r\ninstead of a purplish green. It is a test ordinarily used by gardeners,\r\nto purify their flower beds long before the blooming time, when thinning\r\nor weeding them. Even in wild plants, as in _Erodium_, _Calluna_,\r\n_Brunella_ and others, a botanist may recognize the rare white-flowered\r\n[147] variety by the pure green color of the leaves, at times when it is\r\nnot in flower. Some sorts of peas bear colored flowers and a red mark on\r\nthe stipules of their leaves. Among bulbous plants many varieties may be\r\nrecognized even in the dry bulbs by the different tinges of the outer\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nLeaving the colors, we come now to another instance of correlation,\r\nwhich is still more astonishing. For it is as rare, as color-varieties\r\nare common. It is afforded by some plants the leaves of which, instead\r\nof being entire or only divided into large parts, are cleft to a greater\r\nextent by repeated fissures of the marginal lobes. Such foliar\r\nvariations are often seen in gardens, where they are cultivated for\r\ntheir beauty or singularity, as the laciniated alders, fern-leaved,\r\nbeeches and limes, oakleaved laburnums, etc. Many of them are described\r\nunder the varietal name of _laciniata_. In some cases this fissure\r\nextends to the petals of the flowers, and changes them in a way quite\r\nanalogous to the aberrancy of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis is known to occur with a variety of brambles, and is often seen in\r\nbotanic gardens in one of the oldest and most interesting of all\r\nanomalies, the laciniated variety of the greater celandine or\r\n_Chelidonium majus_. Many other instances could be given. Most of them\r\nbelong to the [148] group of negative variations, as we have defined\r\nthem. But the same thing occurs also with positive varieties, though of\r\ncourse, such cases are very rare. The best known instance is that of the\r\never-flowering begonia, _Begonia semperflorens_, which has green leaves\r\nand white flowers, but which has produced garden varieties with a brown\r\nfoliage and pink flowers. Here also the new quality manifests itself in\r\ndifferent organs.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said on correlative changes, to convince us that\r\nthey are as a rule to be considered as the expression of some general\r\ninternal or physiologic quality, which is not limited to a single organ,\r\nbut affects all parts of the organism, provided they are capable of\r\nundergoing the change. Such characters are therefore to be considered as\r\nunits, and should be referred to the group of single characters.\r\n\r\nOpposed to these are the true compound characters, which consist of\r\ndifferent units. These may be segregated by the production of varieties,\r\nand thereby betray the separate factors of the complex group.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful instances of such complex characters are offered by\r\nthe colors of some of the most prized garden-flowers. Rarely these are\r\nof a single hue, often two or three shades contribute to the effect, and\r\nin some cases special [149] spots or lines or tracings are to be seen on\r\na white or on a colored background. That such spots and lines are\r\nseparate units is obvious and is demonstrated by the fact that sometimes\r\nspotless varieties occur, which in all other respects have kept the\r\ncolors of the species. The complexity of the color is equally evident,\r\nwhenever it is built up of constituents of the anthocyan and of the\r\nyellow group. The anthocyan dye is limited to the sap-cavity of the\r\ncells, while the yellow and pure orange colors are fixed in special\r\norgans of the protoplasm. The observation under the microscope shows at\r\nonce the different units, which though lying in the same cell and in\r\nalmost immediate vicinity of each other are always wholly separated from\r\none another by the wall of the vacuole or sapfilled cell-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe combination of red and yellow gives a brown tinge, as in the\r\ncultivated wall-flower, or those bright hues of a dark orange-red, which\r\nare so much sought in tulips. By putting such flowers for a short time\r\nin boiling water, the cells die and release the red pigment, which\r\nbecomes diffused in the surrounding fluids and the petals are left\r\nbehind with their yellow tinge. In this way it is easy to separate the\r\nconstituents, and demonstrate the compound nature of the original\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n[150] But the diversity of the color patterns is far from being\r\nexhausted with these simple instances. Apart from them, or joined to\r\nthem, other complications are frequently seen, which it is impossible to\r\nanalyze in such an artificial way. Here we have to return to our former\r\nprinciple, the comparison of different varieties. Assuming that single\r\nunits may be lost, irrespective of the others, we may expect to find\r\nthem segregated by variation, wherever a sufficiently wide range of\r\ncolor-varieties is in cultivation. In fact, in most cases a high degree\r\nof dissimilarity may be reached in the simplest way by such a separation\r\nof the components, and by their combination into most diverse smaller\r\ngroups. A very nice instance of such an analysis of flower-colors is\r\nafforded by the ordinary snapdragon. The beautiful brown red color of\r\nthis common garden-plant is composed on one side of yellow elements, on\r\nthe other of red units. Of the yellow there are two, one staining the\r\nwhole corolla with a light hue, as is to be seen in the pure yellow\r\nvariety called _luteum. This form has been produced by the loss of the\r\nwhole group of the red constituents. If the yellow tinge is also lost,\r\nthere arises a white variety, but this is not absolutely colorless, but\r\nshows the other yellow constituent. This last stains only some small\r\nparts [151] of the lips of the flower around the throat, brightening, as\r\nit seems, the entrance for the visiting insects. In many of the red or\r\nreddish varieties this one yellow patch remains, while the general\r\nyellow hue fails. In the variety called \"Brilliant\" the yellow ground\r\nmakes the red color more shiny, and if it is absent the pure carmine\r\ntinge predominates.\r\n\r\nIt is readily seen, that in the ordinary form the lips are of a darker\r\nred than the tube. This evident dissimilarity indicates some complexity.\r\nAnd in fact we have two varieties which exhibit the two causes of this\r\nattribute separately. One of them is called \"Delila,\" and has the red\r\ncolor limited to the lips, whilst the tube is pure white. The other is\r\ncalled \"Fleshy,\" and is of a pale pink throughout the whole corolla.\r\nAdding these two units to one another, we get the original dark red of\r\nthe wild type, and it may be briefly stated here, that the way of\r\neffecting such an addition is given us in the crossing of the \"Fleshy\"\r\nand the \"Delila\" variety, the hybrid showing the two colors and\r\nreturning thereby to the old prototype.\r\n\r\nOther cases of compound flower colors or of color patterns might be\r\ngiven as in the _Mimulus_ and the poppy, and in most of these cases some\r\nvarieties are to be seen in our gardens which show only the single\r\nconstituents of the group.\r\n\r\n[152] Many dark flowers have an intermediate bright hued form besides\r\nthe white variety, as in the case of roses, asters, _Nicandra_ and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nIntermediate forms with respect to stature may also be seen. The\r\nopium-poppy, the snapdragon, peas, the _Nicandra_, and many other\r\ngarden-plants have not only dwarf varieties, but also some of\r\nintermediate height. These, though they are intermediate between the\r\ntall and dwarf types, cannot be considered as transitions, as between\r\nthem and the extremes, intermediates are, as a rule wholly lacking.\r\nInstances of the same occurrence of three types may be seen in the seeds\r\nof maize (\"Cuzco,\" \"Horse-dent\" and \"Gracillima\") of beans and some\r\nother plants. The _Xanthium Wootoni_, above referred to, with only part\r\nof the prickles of Xanthium commune is also a very curious instance of\r\nthe demonstration of the compound nature of a character.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the conclusions that may be drawn from the evidence given in\r\nthis lecture, we have seen that varieties differ from elementary species\r\nin that they do not possess anything really new. They originate for the\r\ngreater part in a negative way, by the apparent loss of some quality,\r\nand rarely in a positive manner by acquiring a character, already seen\r\nin allied species. These characters are not of the nature of [153]\r\nmorphologic entities, but are to be considered as physiologic units,\r\npresent in all parts of the organisms, and manifesting themselves where\r\never occasion is afforded. They are units in the sense that they may\r\nappear and disappear singly. But very often they are combined to yield\r\ncompound characters, which are capable of analysis. Opportunities for\r\nsuch an analysis are afforded by these groups of cultivated varieties,\r\nof which some members show a single distinguishing quality, or a number\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[154]\r\n\r\nLECTURE VI\r\n\r\nSTABILITY AND REAL ATAVISM\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that varieties are principally distinguished\r\nfrom species by their inconstancy. This conception is derived from some\r\nspecial cases and transferred to others, and in its common form this\r\nbelief must have originated from the confusion which exists as to the\r\nmeaning of the term variety. It is true that vegetative varieties as a\r\nrule run back, when propagated by seeds; they are an obvious instance of\r\ninconstancy. In the second place we have considered the group of\r\ninconstant or sporting varieties, which of course we must exclude when\r\nstudying the stability of other types. However, even these sporting\r\nvarieties are unstable only to a certain degree, and in a broader sense\r\nwill prove to be as true to their character as the most constant types.\r\n\r\nHaving separated these two groups, which include also the wide range of\r\nhybrid forms, we may next consider only those varieties of pure origin,\r\nand ordinarily propagated by seeds, [155] which have been discussed in\r\nformer chapters. Their general character lies in their fidelity to type,\r\nand in the fact that this is single, and not double, as in the sporting\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nBut the current belief is, that they are only true to their\r\npeculiarities to a certain degree, and that from time to time, and not\r\nrarely, they revert to the type from which they have arisen. Such\r\nreversion is supposed to prove that they are mere varieties, and at the\r\nsame time to indicate empirically the species from which they have\r\nsprung.\r\n\r\nIn the next lecture we shall examine critically the evidence on which\r\nthis assumption rests. Before doing so however, it will be necessary to\r\ncollate the cases in which there is no reversion at all, or in which the\r\nreversion is absent at least in experimental and pure sowings.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge it is very difficult to decide,\r\nwhether or not true reversion occurs in constant varieties. If it does\r\noccur, it surely does so very rarely and only under unusual\r\ncircumstances, or in particular individuals. However when such\r\nindividuals are multiplied by buds and especially when they are the only\r\nrepresentatives of their type, the reversion, though theoretically rare,\r\nwill be shown by nearly every specimen of the variety. Examples of this\r\nwill be given below.\r\n\r\n[156] They are generally called atavists or reversionists, but even\r\nthese terms are sometimes used in a different sense.\r\n\r\nLastly it is to be said that the empirical and experimental evidence as\r\nto the question of constancy is not as extensive as it should be. The\r\nexperimental conditions are seldom described, and it is only recently\r\nthat an interest in the matter has been awakened. Much remains to be\r\ndone. Among other things the innumerable varieties of trees, shrubs and\r\nperennial herbs should be tested as to their constancy when grown from\r\npurely fertilized seeds. Many of them may be included among the number\r\nthat sport constantly.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the doubtful or insufficiently studied cases, we may now\r\nturn our attention to the facts that prove the absolute stability of a\r\nlarge number of varieties, at least as far as such completeness can be\r\nattained by experiment or observation.\r\n\r\nThe best proof is afforded by the varieties which grow wild in\r\nlocalities where they are quite isolated from the species, and where for\r\nthis reason, no possibility of crossing disturbs the significance of the\r\nproof. As one instance the rayless form of the wild camomile, or the\r\n_Matricaria Chamomilla discoidea_ may be mentioned. Many systematists\r\nhave been so strongly [157] impressed with its absolute constancy and\r\nits behavior as an ordinary species, that they have elevated it, as it\r\nis called, to the rank of a species. As such it is described under the\r\nname of _Matricaria discoidea_ DC. It is remarkable for its rapid and\r\nwidespread distribution, as of late years it has become naturalized in\r\ndifferent parts of America and of Europe, where it is to be seen\r\nespecially in France and in Norway. Experimentally I raised in\r\nsucceeding years between 1000 and 2000 seedlings, but observed no trace\r\nof reversion, either in the strongest or in the numerous very small and\r\nweak individuals which appeared in the cultures.\r\n\r\nThe tansy-ragwort or _Senecio Jacobaea_ may be chosen as a second\r\ninstance. It is a perennial herb with short rootstocks and stout stems\r\nbearing numerous short-peduncled heads in large compact corymb; it\r\nmultiplies itself abundantly by seeds and is very common on the sand\r\ndunes of Holland. It has two forms, differing only in the occurrence or\r\nthe lack of the ray florets. But these two varieties occupy different\r\nlocalities and are even limited to different provinces. As far as I have\r\nbeen able to ascertain on numerous excursions during a series of years,\r\nthey never sport, and are only intermingled on the outskirts of their\r\nhabitats. The rayless form is generally considered as the [158] variety\r\nbut it is quite as stable as the radiate species.\r\n\r\nThe radiate varieties of marigold, quoted in a former lecture, seem to\r\nbe equally constant, when growing far away from their prototypes. I\r\nsowed the seeds of a single plant of the radiate form of _Bidens\r\ncernua_, and found all of the seedlings came true, and in the next year\r\nI had from their seed between 2,000 and 3,000 flowering individuals, all\r\nequally radiate. Many species of composites have been tried, and they\r\nare all constant. On the other hand rare sports of this kind have been\r\nobserved by Murr and other authors.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of vegetables and of fruits give instances of stability.\r\nWhite strawberries, green grapes, white currants, crisped lettuce,\r\ncrisped parsley and some other crisped forms may be cited. The spinage\r\nwithout prickles is a widely known instance. White-flowered flax never\r\nreverts to the blue prototype, if kept pure. Sugar-peas and sugar-corn\r\nafford further instances. Strawberries without runners have come true\r\nfrom seed ever since their first appearance, over a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nMany garden-varieties, the stability of which under ordinary\r\ncircumstances is doubtful, because of their being sown too close to\r\nother varieties of the same species, have been tested in [159] respect\r\nto their stability by different writers and at different times. In doing\r\nthis it is plain that it is very essential to be sure of the purity of\r\nthe seed. Specimens must be grown in positions isolated from their\r\nallies, and if possible be pollinated artificially with the exclusion of\r\nthe visits of insects. This may be done in different ways. If it is a\r\nrare species, not cultivated in the neighborhood, it is often sufficient\r\nto make sure of this fact. Pollen may be conveyed by bees from distances\r\nof some ten or twenty meters, or in rare cases from some hundred meters\r\nand more, but a greater distance is ordinarily sufficient for isolation.\r\nIf the flowers fertilize themselves, as is more often the case than is\r\ngenerally supposed, or if it is easy to pollinate them artificially,\r\nwith their own pollen or in small groups of similar individuals, the\r\nbest way is to isolate them by means of close coverings. When flowering,\r\nthe plants are as a rule too large to be put under bell-glasses, and\r\nmoreover such coverings would keep the air moist, and cause the\r\nflower-buds to be thrown off. The best coverings are of netting, or of\r\ncanvas of sufficiently wide mesh, although after a long experience I\r\ngreatly prefer cages of fine iron-wire, which are put around and over\r\nthe whole plant or group of plants, and fastened securely and tightly to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n[160] Paper bags also may be made use of. They are slipped over the\r\nflowering branches, and bound together around the twigs, thus enclosing\r\nthe flowers. It is necessary to use prepared papers, in order that they\r\nmay resist rain and wind. The best sort, and the one that I use almost\r\nexclusively in my fertilization-experiments, is made of parchment-paper.\r\nThis is a wood-pulp preparation, freed artificially from the so-called\r\nwood-substance or lignin. Having covered the flowers with care, and\r\nhaving gathered the seeds free from intermixtures and if possible\r\nseparately for each single individual, it only remains to sow them in\r\nquantities that will yield the greatest possible number of individuals.\r\nReversions are supposed to be rare and small groups of seedlings of\r\ncourse would not suffice to bring them to light. Only sowings of many\r\nhundreds or thousands of individuals are decisive. Such sowings can be\r\nmade in one year, or can be extended over a series of years and of\r\ngenerations. Hildebrand and Hoffman have preferred the last method, and\r\nso did Hofmeister and many others. Hildebrand sowed the white hyacinth,\r\nand the white varieties of the larkspur, the stock and the sweet pea.\r\nHoffman cultivated the white flax and many other varieties and\r\nHofmeister extended his sowings [161] over thirty years with the white\r\nvariety of the yellow foxglove (_Digitalis parviflora_). White-flowered\r\nvarieties of perennial garden plants were used in my own experiments. I\r\nbought the plants, flowered them under isolation in the way described\r\nabove, gathered the seeds from each individual separately and sowed them\r\nin isolated groups, keeping many hundreds and in some cases above a\r\nthousand plants up to the time of flowering. Among them I found only one\r\ninconstant variety, the white form of the yellow columbine, _Aquilegia\r\nchrysantha_. It evidently belonged to the group of sporting varieties\r\nalready referred to. All others came absolutely true to type without any\r\nexception. The species experimented with, were _Campanula persicifolia_,\r\n_Hyssopus officinalis_, _Lobelia syphilitica_, _Lychnis chalcedonica_,\r\n_Polemonium dissectum_, _Salvia sylvestris_ and some others. Tested in\r\nthe same way I found the white varieties of the following annual plants\r\nalso quite true: _Chrysanthemum coronarium_, _Godetia amoena_, _Linum\r\nusitatissimum_, _Phlox drummondi_, and _Silene Armeria_. To these may be\r\nadded the white hemlock stork's-bill (_Erodium cicutarium album_) which\r\ngrows very abundantly in some parts of my fatherland, and is easily\r\nrecognizable by its pure green leaves and stems, even when not\r\nflowering. I cultivated it, in large numbers [162] during five\r\nsucceeding generations, but was never able to find even the slightest\r\nindication of a reversion to the red prototype. The scarlet pimpernel or\r\n_Anagallis arvensis_ has a blue variety which is absolutely constant.\r\nEven in Britton and Brown's \"Flora,\" which rarely enumerates varieties,\r\nit is mentioned as being probably a distinct species. Eight hundred\r\nblooming seedlings were obtained from isolated parents, all of the same\r\nblue color. The New Zealand spinage (_Tetragonia expansa_) has a\r\ngreenish and a brownish variety, the red color extending over the whole\r\nfoliage, including the stems and the branches. I have tried both of them\r\nduring several years, and they never sported into each other. I raised\r\nmore than 5,000 seedlings, from the different seeds of one lot of the\r\ngreen variety in succeeding years, but neither those germinating in the\r\nfirst year, nor the others coming into activity after two, three or four\r\nyears of repose gave any sign of the red color of the original species.\r\n\r\nIt is an old custom to designate intermediate forms as hybrids,\r\nespecially when both the types are widely known and the intermediates\r\nrare. Many persons believe that in doing so, they are giving an\r\nexplanation of the rarer forms. But since the laws of hybridism are\r\ncoming to be known we shall have to break with [163] all such usages. So\r\nfor instance there are numerous flowers which are of a dark red or a\r\ndark blue color, and which, besides a white variety, have a pink or a\r\npale blue form. Such pale varieties are of exactly the same value as\r\nothers, and on testing they are found to be equally stable. So for\r\ninstance the pink variety of the Sweet William (_Silene Armeria rosea_),\r\nthe _Clarkia pulchella carnea_ and the pale variety of the corn-cockle,\r\ncalled usually _Agrostemma Githago nicaeensis_ or even simply _A.\r\nnicaeensis_. The latter variety I found pure during ten succeeding\r\ngenerations. Another notable stable intermediate form is the poppy\r\nbearing the Danish flag (_Papaver somniferum Danebrog_). It is an old\r\nvariety, and absolutely pure when cultivated separately. A long list of\r\nother instances might easily be given.\r\n\r\nMany garden-varieties, that are still universally prized and cultivated\r\nare very old. It is curious to note how often such forms have been\r\nintroduced as novelties. The common foxglove is one of the best\r\nexamples. It has a monstrous variety, which is very showy because it\r\nbears on the summit of its raceme and branches, large erect cup-shaped\r\nflowers, which have quite a different aspect from the normal\r\nthimbleshaped side-blossoms. These flowers are ordinarily described as\r\nbelonging to the anomaly [164] known as \"peloria,\" or regular form of a\r\nnormally symmetric type; they are large and irregular on the stems and\r\nthe vigorous branches but slender and quinate on the weaker twigs. Their\r\nbeauty and highly interesting anomalous character has been the cause of\r\ntheir being described many times, and nearly always as a novelty; they\r\nhave been recently re-introduced into horticulture as such, though they\r\nwere already cultivated before the middle of the last century. About\r\nthat time very good descriptions with plates were published in the\r\njournal \"Flora\" by Vrolik, but afterwards they seem to have been\r\nforgotten. The peloric variety of the foxglove always comes true from\r\nseed, though in the strict sense of the word which we have chosen for\r\nour discussion, it does not seem to be a constant and pure variety.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to compare old botanical books, or even old\r\ndrawings and engravings containing figures of anomalous plants. The\r\ncelebrated Pinacothec of Munich contains an old picture by Holbein\r\n(1495-1543) representing St. Sebastian in a flower-garden. Of the plants\r\nmany are clearly recognizable, and among others there is one of the\r\n\"one-leaved\" variety of the strawberry, which may still be met with in\r\nbotanical gardens. In the year 1671 a Dutch botanist, Abraham Munting\r\npublished [165] a large volume on garden-plants, containing a great\r\nnumber of very good engravings. Most of them of course show normal\r\nplants, but intermixed with these are varieties, that are still in\r\ncultivation and therefore must be at least two centuries old. Others,\r\nthough not figured, are easily recognized by their names and\r\ndescriptions. The cockscomb is the most widely known, but many white or\r\ndouble flowered varieties were already cultivated at that time. The\r\nstriped Jalappa, the crested Sedum, the fasciated crown-imperial, white\r\nstrawberries, red gooseberries and many others were known to Munting.\r\n\r\nSome varieties are as old as culture itself, and it is generally known\r\nthat the Romans cultivated the white form of the opium-poppy and used\r\nthe foliage of the red variety of the sugarbeet as a vegetable.\r\n\r\nIn our time flowers and fruits are changing nearly as rapidly as the\r\nfancies and tastes of men. Every year new forms are introduced and usurp\r\nthe place of older ones. Many are soon forgotten. But if we look at old\r\ncountry gardens, a goodly number of fine and valued old sorts are still\r\nto be found. It would be worth while to make special collections of\r\nliving plants of old varieties, which surely would be a good and\r\ninteresting work and bring about a conviction [166] of the stability of\r\npure strains. Coming now to the other side of the question, we may\r\nconsider those cases of reversion which have been recorded from time to\r\ntime, and which always have been considered as direct proofs of the\r\nvarietal character of the reverting form. Reversion means the falling\r\nback or returning to another type, and the word itself expresses the\r\nidea that this latter type is the form from which the variety has\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nSome instances of atavism of this kind are well known, as they are often\r\nrepeated by individuals that are multiplied by buds or by grafting.\r\nBefore looking attentively into the different features of the many cases\r\nof rare reversions it will be advisable to quote a few examples.\r\n\r\nThe flowering-currant of the Pacific Coast or North American scarlet\r\nribes (_Ribes sanguineum_), a very popular ornamental shrub, will serve\r\nas a good example. It is prized because of its brilliant red racemes of\r\nflowers which blossom early in the spring, before the appearance of the\r\nleaves. From this species a white form has arisen, which is an old and\r\nwidely cultivated one, but not so highly prized because of its pale\r\nflowers. These are not of a pure white, but have retained a faint\r\nreddish hue. The young twigs and the stalks of the [167] leaves afford\r\nan instance of correlated variability since in the species the red color\r\nshows itself clearly mixed with the green, while in the variety this\r\ntinge is wholly wanting.\r\n\r\nOccasionally this white-flowered currant reverts back to the original\r\nred type and the reversion takes place in the bud. One or two buds on a\r\nshrub bearing perhaps a thousand bunches of white flowers produce twigs\r\nand leaves in which the red pigment is noticeable and the flowers of\r\nwhich become brightly colored. If such a twig is left on the shrub, it\r\nmay grow further, ramify and evolve into a larger group of branches. All\r\nof them keep true to the old type. Once reverted, the branches remain\r\nforever atavistic. It is a very curious sight, these small groups of red\r\nbranches among the many white ones. And for this reason attention is\r\noften called to it, and more than once I myself have had the opportunity\r\nof noting its peculiarities. It seems quite certain that by planting\r\nsuch shrubs in a garden, we may rely upon seeing sooner or later some\r\nnew buds reverting to the prototype.\r\n\r\nVery little attention seems hitherto to have been given to this curious\r\nphenomenon, though in many respects it deserves a closer investigation.\r\nThe variety is said to have originated from seed in Scotland, many years\r\nago, and [168] seems to be propagated only by cuttings or by grafting.\r\nIf this is true, all specimens must be considered as constituting\r\ntogether only one individual, notwithstanding their wide distribution in\r\nthe gardens and parks of so many countries. This induces me to suppose,\r\nthat the tendency to reversion is not a character of the variety as\r\nsuch, but rather a peculiarity of this one individual. In other words it\r\nseems probable that when the whitish variety arises a second time from\r\nthe red species, it is not at all necessary that it should exhibit this\r\nsame tendency to revert. Or to put it still in another way, I think that\r\nwe may suppose that a variety, which might be produced repeatedly from\r\nthe same original stock, would only in rare individuals have a tendency\r\nto revert, and in most cases would be as absolutely constant as the\r\nspecies itself.\r\n\r\nSuch a conception would give us a distinct insight into the cause of the\r\nrarity of these reversions. Many varieties of shrubs and trees have\r\noriginated but once or twice. Most of them must therefore, if our\r\nsupposition is correct, be expected to be stable and only a few may be\r\nexpected to be liable to reversions.\r\n\r\nAmong the conifers many very good cases of reversions by buds are to be\r\nfound in gardens and glasshouses. They behave exactly like the whitish\r\ncurrant. But as the varietal characters [169] are chiefly found in the\r\nfoliage and in the branches, these aberrations are to be seen on the\r\nplants during the whole year. Moreover they are in some cases much more\r\nnumerous than in the first instance. The _Cryptomeria_ of Japan has a\r\nvariety with twigs resembling ropes. This is not caused by a twisting,\r\nbut only by a curvature of the needles in such a way that they seem to\r\ngrow in spiral lines around the twigs. This variety often reverts to the\r\ntype with widely spread, straight needles. And on many a specimen four,\r\nfive, or more reverted branches may be seen on different parts of the\r\nsame shrub. Still more widely cultivated is the shrub called\r\n_Cephalotaxus pedunculata fastigiata_, and more commonly known under its\r\nold name of _Podocarpus koraiana_. It is the broomlike variety of a\r\nspecies, nearly allied to the common American and European species of\r\nyew, (_Taxus minor_ and _T. baccata_). It is a low shrub, with broadly\r\nlinear leaves of a clear green. In the species the leaves are arranged\r\nin two rows, one to the left and one to the right of the horizontally\r\ngrowing and widely spreading branches. In the variety the branches are\r\nerect and the leaves inserted on all sides. When sporting, it returns to\r\nthe bilateral prototype and flat wings of fan-shaped twigs are produced\r\nlaterally on its dense broom-like tufts.\r\n\r\n[170] Wherever this variety is cultivated the same reversion may be\r\nseen; it is produced abundantly, and even under seemingly normal\r\ncircumstances. But as in the case of the _Ribes_ all the specimens are\r\nderived by buds from a single original plant. The variety was introduced\r\nfrom Japan about the year 1860, but is probably much older. Nothing is\r\nknown as to its real origin. It never bears flowers or fruits. It is\r\ncurious to note that the analogous variety of the European yew, _Taxus\r\nbaccata fastigiata_, though much more commonly cultivated than the\r\n_Cephalotaxus_, never reverts, at least as far as I have been able to\r\nascertain. This clearly corroborates the explanation given above.\r\n\r\nAfter considering these rare instances of more widely known reversions,\r\nwe may now examine the question of atavism from a broader point of view.\r\nBut in doing so it should once more be remembered, that all cases of\r\nhybridism and also all varieties sporting annually or frequently, are to\r\nbe wholly excluded. Only the very rare occurrence of instances of\r\natavism in varieties that are for the rest known to be absolutely\r\nconstant, is to be considered.\r\n\r\nAtavism or reversion is the falling back to a prototype. But what is a\r\nprototype? We may take the word in a physiologic or in a systematic\r\nsense. Physiologically the signification is a [171] very narrowly\r\nrestricted one; and includes only those ancestors from which a form is\r\nknown to have been derived. But such evidence is of course historic. If\r\na variety has been observed to spring from a definite species, and if\r\nthe circumstances have been sufficiently ascertained not to leave the\r\nslightest doubt as to its pure origin, and if moreover all the evidence\r\nhas been duly recorded, we may say that the origin of the variety is\r\nhistorically known. In most cases we must be content with the testimony,\r\ngiven somewhat later, and recorded after the new variety had the\r\nopportunity of showing its greater merits.\r\n\r\nIf it now happens that such a variety of recorded origin should\r\noccasionally revert to its parent-species, we have all we can wish for,\r\nin the way of a thoroughly proved case of atavism. But such instances\r\nare very rare, as the birth of most varieties has only been very\r\nimperfectly controlled.\r\n\r\nNext to this comes the systematic relation of a variety to its species.\r\nThe historic origin of the variety may be obscure, or may simply be\r\nforgotten. But the distinguishing marks are of the order described in\r\nour last lecture, either in the positive or in the negative direction,\r\nand on this ground the rarer form is considered to be a variety of the\r\nmore wide-spread one. If [172] now the presumed variety sports and runs\r\nover to the presumed type, the probability of the supposed relation is\r\nevidently enhanced. But it is manifest that the explanation rests upon\r\nthe results of comparative studies, and not upon direct observations of\r\nthe phenomena themselves.\r\n\r\nThe nearer the relations between the two types in question, the less\r\nexposed to doubt and criticism are the conclusions. But the domain of\r\natavism is not restricted to the cases described. Quite on the contrary\r\nthe facts that strike us most forcibly as being reversions are those\r\nthat are apt to give us an insight into the systematic affinity of a\r\nhigher degree. We are disposed to make use of them in our attempts to\r\nperfect the natural system and to remould it in such a way as to become\r\na pedigree of the related groups. Such cases of atavism no doubt occur,\r\nbut the anomalies referred to them must be interpreted merely on the\r\nground of our assumptions as to the relative places in the system to be\r\nassigned to the different forms.\r\n\r\nThough such instances cannot be considered as belonging strictly to the\r\nsubject we are dealing with, I think it may be as well to give an\r\nexample, especially as it affords an occasion for referring to the\r\nhighly important researches of Heinricher on the variability and\r\natavistic [173] tendencies of the pale blue flag or _Iris pallida_. The\r\nflowers of the blue flags have a perianth of six segments united below\r\ninto a tube. The three outer parts are dilated and spreading, or\r\nreflexed, while the three inner usually stand erect, but in most species\r\nare broad and colored like the outer ones. Corresponding to the outer,\r\nperianth-segments are the three stamens and the three, petal-like\r\ndivisions of the style, each bearing a transverse stigma immediately\r\nabove the anther. They are pollinated by bumble-bees, and in some\r\ninstances by flies of the genus _Rhingia_, which search for the honey,\r\nbrush the pollen out of the anthers and afterwards deposit it on the\r\nstigma. According to systematic views of the monocotyledons the original\r\nprototype of the genus _Iris_ must have had a whorl of six equal, or\r\nnearly equal perianth-segments and six stamens, such as are now seen in\r\nthe more primitive types of the family of the lilies, as for instance in\r\nthe lilies themselves, the tulips, hyacinths and others. As to the\r\nperianth this view is supported by the existence of one species, the\r\n_Iris falcifolia_, the perianth of which consists of six equal parts.\r\nBut species with six stamens are wholly lacking. Heinricher however, in\r\ncultivating some anomalous forms of _Iris pallida_, succeeded in filling\r\nout this gap and in producing [174] flowers with a uniform perianth and\r\nsix stamens, recalling thereby the supposed ancestral type. The way in\r\nwhich he got these was as follows: he started from some slight\r\ndeviations observed in the flowers of the pale species, sowed the seeds\r\nin large numbers and selected from the seedlings only those which\r\nclearly showed anomalies in the expected atavistic direction. By\r\nrepeating this during several generations he at last reached his goal\r\nand was able to give reality to the prototype, which formerly was only a\r\nhypothetical one. The _Iris kaempferi_, a large-flowered Japanese\r\nspecies much cultivated in gardens, is very variable in the number of\r\nthe different parts of its flowers, and may in some instances be seen\r\neven with six stamens. If studied in the same way as Heinricher's iris,\r\nit no doubt will yield highly interesting and confirmatory results.\r\n\r\nMany other instances of such systematic atavism could be given, and\r\nevery botanist can easily add some from memory. Many anomalies,\r\noccurring spontaneously, are evidently due to the same principle, but it\r\nwould take too long to describe them.\r\n\r\nReversion may occur either by buds or by seeds. It is highly probable\r\nthat it occurs more readily by sexual than by asexual propagation. But\r\nif we restrict the discussion to the limits [175] hitherto observed,\r\nseed-reversions must be said to be extremely rare. Or rather cases which\r\nare sufficiently certain to be relied upon, are very rare, and perhaps\r\nwholly lacking. Most of the instances, recorded by various writers, are\r\nopen to question. Doubts exist as to the purity of the seeds and the\r\npossibility of some unobserved cross disturbing the results.\r\n\r\nIn the next lecture we shall deal in general with the ordinary causes\r\nand results of such crosses. We shall then see that they are so common\r\nand occur so regularly under ordinary circumstances that we can never\r\nrely on the absolute purity of any seeds, if the impossibility of an\r\noccasional cross has not been wholly excluded, either by the\r\ncircumstances themselves, or by experimental precautions taken during\r\nthe flowering period.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons cases of atavism given without recording the\r\ncircumstances, or the precautions that guarantee the purity of the\r\nfertilization, should always be disregarded. And moreover another proof\r\nshould always be demanded. The parent which yielded the seeds might be\r\nitself a hybrid and liable to reversions by the ordinary laws of the\r\nsplitting up of hybrids. Such cases should likewise be discarded, since\r\nthey bring in confusing elements. If we review the long list of recorded\r\ncases by these [176] strict methods of criticism very few instances will\r\nbe found that satisfy legitimate demands. On this ground it is by far\r\nsafer in the present state of our knowledge, to accept bud-variations\r\nonly as direct proofs of true atavism. And even these may not always be\r\nrelied on, as some hybrids are liable to split up in a vegetative way,\r\nand in doing so to give rise to bud-variations that are in many respects\r\napparently similar to cases of atavism. But fortunately such instances\r\nare as yet very rare.\r\n\r\nAfter this discussion it would be bold indeed to give instances of\r\nseed-atavism, and I believe that it will be better to refrain wholly\r\nfrom doing so.\r\n\r\nMany instances of so-called atavism are of purely morphologic nature.\r\nThe most interesting cases are those furnished by the forms which some\r\nplants bear only while young, and which evidently connect them with\r\nallied species, in which the same features may be seen in the adult\r\nstate. Some species of the genus _Acacia_ bear bipinnate leaves, while\r\nothers have no leaves at all, but bear broadened and flattened petioles\r\ninstead. The second type is presumed to be descended from the first by\r\nthe loss of the leaflets and the modification of the stalks into flat\r\nand simple phyllodes. But many of them are liable to recall this\r\nprimitive form [177] when very young, in the first two or three, or\r\nsometimes in eight or ten primary leaves. These leaves are small because\r\nof the weakness of the young plant and therefore often more or less\r\nreduced in structure. But they are usually strictly bipinnate and\r\nthereby give testimony as to their descent from species which bear such\r\nleaves throughout their life.\r\n\r\nOther similar cases could be given, but this will suffice. They once\r\nmore show how necessary it is to separate the different cases, thrown\r\ntogether until now, under this general name of atavism. It would be far\r\nbetter to give them all special names, and as long as these are not\r\navailable we must be cautious not to be misguided by the name, and\r\nespecially not to confuse different phenomena with one another, because\r\nat the present time they bear the same names.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the relatively numerous restrictions resulting\r\nfrom this discussion, we will now make a hasty survey of some of the\r\nmore notable and generally acknowledged cases of atavism by\r\nbud-propagation. But it should be repeated once more that most of the\r\nhighly cultivated plants, grown as vegetables, or for their fruit or\r\nflowers, have so many crosses in their ancestry, that it seems better to\r\nexclude them from all considerations, in which purity of [178] descent\r\nis a requisite. By so doing, we exclude most of the facts which were\r\nuntil now generally relied upon. For the roses, the hyacinths, the\r\ntulips, the chrysanthemums always have furnished the largest\r\ncontributions to the demonstrations of bud-variation. But they have been\r\ncrossed so often, that doubt as to the purity of the descent of any\r\nsingle form may recur, and may destroy the usefulness of their many\r\nrecorded cases of bud-variation for the demonstration of real atavism.\r\nThe same assertion holds good in many other cases, as with _Azalea_ and\r\n_Camellia_. And the striped varieties of these genera belong to the\r\ngroup of ever-sporting forms, and therefore will be considered later on.\r\nSo it is with carnations and pinks, which occasionally vary by layering,\r\nand of which some kinds are so uncertain in character that they are\r\ncalled by floriculturists \"catch-flowers.\" On the other hand there is a\r\nlarger group of cases of reversion by buds, which is probably not of\r\nhybrid nature, nor due to innate inconstancy of the variety, but must be\r\nconsidered as pure atavism. I refer to the bud-variations of so many of\r\nour cultivated varieties of shrubs and trees. Many of them are\r\ncultivated because of their foliage. They are propagated by grafting,\r\nand in most cases it is probable that all the numerous specimens [179]\r\nof the same variety have been derived in this way from one primitive,\r\naberrant individual. We may disregard variegated leaves, spotted or\r\nmarked with white or yellow, because they are too inconstant types.\r\n\r\nWe may next turn our attention to the varieties of trees with cut\r\nleaves, as the oakleaved _Laburnum_, the parsley-leaved vine and the\r\nfern-leaved birch. Here the margin of the leaves is deeply cut and\r\ndivided by many incisions, which sometimes change only the outer parts\r\nof the blade, but in other cases may go farther and reach, or nearly\r\nreach, the midvein, and change the simple leaf into a seemingly compound\r\nstructure. The anomaly may even lead to the almost complete loss of all\r\nthe chorophyll-tissue and the greater part of the lateral veins, as in\r\nthe case of the cut-leaved beech or _Fagus sylvatica pectinata_.\r\n\r\nSuch varieties are often apt to revert by buds to the common forms. The\r\ncut-leaved beech sometimes reverts partially only, and the branches\r\noften display the different forms of cut-leaved, fern-like, oak-leaved\r\nand other variously shaped leaves on the same twigs. But this is merely\r\ndue to the wide variability of the degree of fissure and is to be\r\nconsidered only as a fluctuation between somewhat widely distant\r\nextremes, which may even apparently include [180] the form of the common\r\nbeech-leaves. It is not a bud-variation at all, and it is to be met with\r\nquite commonly while the true reversions by buds are very rare and are\r\nof the nature of sports appearing suddenly and remaining constant on the\r\nsame twig. Analogous phenomena of wide variability with true reversion\r\nmay be seen in the variety of the European hornbeam called _Carpinus\r\nBetulus heterophylla_. The leaves of this tree generally show the\r\ngreatest diversity in form. Some other cases have been brought together\r\nby Darwin. In the first place a subvariety of the weeping-willow with\r\nleaves rolled up into a spiral coil. A tree of this kind kept true for\r\ntwenty-five years and then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat\r\nleaves. The barberry (_Berberis_) offers another case; it has a well\r\nknown variety with seedless fruit, which can be propagated by cuttings\r\nor layers, but its runners are said always to revert to the common form,\r\nand to produce ordinary berries with seeds. Most of the cases referred\r\nto by Darwin, however, seem to be doubtful and cannot be considered as\r\ntrue proofs of atavism until more is known about the circumstances under\r\nwhich they were produced.\r\n\r\nRed or brown-leaved varieties of trees and shrubs also occasionally\r\nproduce green-leaved branches, and in this way revert to the type [181]\r\nfrom which they must evidently have arisen. Instances are on record of\r\nthe hazel, _Corylus Avellana_, of the allied _Corylus tubulosa_, of the\r\nred beech, the brown birch and of some other purple varieties. Even the\r\nred bananas, which bear fruits without seeds and therefore have no other\r\nway of being propagated than by buds, have produced a green variety with\r\nyellow fruits. The _Hortensia_ of our gardens is another instance of a\r\nsterile form which has been observed to throw out a branch with cymes\r\nbearing in their center the usual small staminate and pistillate flowers\r\ninstead of the large radiate and neutral corollas of the variety,\r\nthereby returning to the original wild type. Crisped weeping-willows,\r\ncrisped parsley and others have reverted in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAll such cases are badly in need of a closer investigation. And as they\r\noccur only occasionally, or as it is commonly stated, by accident, the\r\nstudent of nature should be prepared to examine carefully any case which\r\nmight present itself to him. Many phases of this difficult problem could\r\nno doubt be solved in this way. First of all the question arises as to\r\nwhether the case is one of real atavism, or is only seemingly so, being\r\ndue to hybrid or otherwise impure descent of the varying individual, and\r\nsecondly whether it may be only an instance of the regularly [182]\r\noccurring so-called atavism of the sporting varieties with which we\r\nshall deal in a later lecture. If it proves to be real atavism and rare,\r\nthe case should be accurately described and figured, or photographed if\r\npossible; and the exact position of the reverting bud should be\r\nascertained. Very likely the so-called dormant or resting buds are more\r\nliable to reversions than the primary ones in the arils of the leaves of\r\nyoung twigs. Then the characters of the atavistic branches should be\r\nminutely compared with those of the presumed ancestor; they may be quite\r\nidentical with them or slightly divergent, as has been asserted in some\r\ninstances. The atavism may be complete in one case, but more or less\r\nincomplete in others. By far the most interesting point is the question,\r\nas to what is to be expected from the seeds of such an atavistic branch.\r\nWill they keep true to the reverted character, or return to the\r\ncharacters of the plant which bears the retrograde branch? Will all of\r\nthem do so, or only part of them, and how large a part? It is very\r\nastonishing that this question should still be unsolved where so many\r\nindividual trees bear atavistic branches that remain on them through\r\nlong series of years. But then many such branches do not flower at all,\r\nor if they flower and bear seed, no care is taken to prevent [183]\r\ncross-fertilization with the other flowers of the same plant, and the\r\nresults have no scientific value. For anyone who cares to work with the\r\nprecautions prescribed by science, a wide field is here open for\r\ninvestigation, because old reverted branches may be met with much less\r\nrarely than new ones.\r\n\r\nFinally the possibility is always to be considered that the tendency to\r\nbud-reversions may be a special feature of some individuals, and may not\r\nbe met with in others of the same variety. I have spoken of this before.\r\nFor the practical student it indicates that a specimen, once observed to\r\nproduce atavistic buds, may be expected to do the same thing again. And\r\nthen there is a very good chance that by combining this view with the\r\nidea that dormant buds are more apt to revert than young ones, we may\r\nget at a method for further investigation, if we recur to the practice\r\nof pruning. By cutting away the young twigs in the vicinity of dormant\r\nbuds, we may incite these to action. Evidently we are not to expect that\r\nin so doing they will all become atavistic. For this result is not at\r\nall assured; on the contrary, all that we might hope to attain would be\r\nthe possibility of some of them being induced to sport in the desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMany questions in scientific research can only [184] be answered by long\r\nand arduous work in well equipped laboratories; they are not to be\r\nattempted by every one. But there are other problems which the most\r\ncomplete of institutions are not able to study if opportunity is not\r\noffered them, and such opportunities are apt to occur more often in\r\nfields, gardens, parks, woods and plains, than in the relatively small\r\nexperimental gardens of even the largest institution. Therefore,\r\nwhosoever has the good fortune to find such sports, should never allow\r\nthe occasion to pass without making an investigation that may bring\r\nresults of very great importance to science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[185]\r\n\r\nLECTURE VII\r\n\r\nFALSE ATAVISM OR VICINISM\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last century Louis de Vilmorin showed that it\r\nwas possible to subject plants to the methods of amelioration of races\r\nthen in use for domestic animals, and since that time atavism has played\r\na large part in all breeding-processes. It was considered to be the\r\ngreatest enemy of the breeder, and was generally spoken of as a definite\r\nforce, working against and protracting the endeavors of the\r\nhorticulturist.\r\n\r\nNo clear conception as to its true nature had been formulated, and even\r\nthe propriety of designating the observed phenomena by the term atavism\r\nseemed doubtful. Duchesne used this word some decades ago to designate\r\nthose cases in which species or varieties revert spontaneously, or from\r\nunknown internal causes, to some long-lost characters of their\r\nancestors. Duchesne's definition was evidently a sharp and useful one,\r\nsince it developed for the first time the idea of latent or dormant\r\nqualities, [186] formerly active, and awaiting probably through\r\ncenturies an occasion to awaken, and to display the lost characters.\r\n\r\nCases of apparent reversion were often seen in nurseries, especially in\r\nflower culture, which under ordinary circumstances are rarely wholly\r\npure, but always sport more or less into the colors and forms of allied\r\nvarieties. Such sporting individuals have to be extirpated regularly,\r\notherwise the whole variety would soon lose its type and its uniformity\r\nand run over to some other form in cultivation in the vicinity. For this\r\nreason atavism in nurseries causes much care and labor, and consequently\r\nis to be dealt with as a very important factor.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the idea has suggested itself to some of the best\r\nauthorities on the amelioration of plants, that this atavism was not due\r\nto an innate tendency, but, in many cases at least, was produced by\r\ncrosses between neighboring varieties. It is especially owing to Verlot\r\nthat this side of the question was brought forward. But breeders as a\r\nrule have not attached much importance to this supposition, chiefly\r\nbecause of the great practical difficulties attending any attempt to\r\nguard the species of the larger cultures against intermixture with other\r\nvarieties. Bees and humble-bees fly from bud to bud, and carry the\r\npollen from one [187 ] sort to another, and separation by great\r\ndistances would be required to avoid this source of impurity.\r\nUnfortunately the arrangements and necessities of large cultures make it\r\nimpossible to isolate the allied varieties from each other.\r\n\r\nFrom a theoretical point of view the origin of these impurities is a\r\nhighly important question. If the breeders' atavism is due to crosses,\r\nand only to this cause, it has no bearing at all on the question of the\r\nconstancy of varieties. And the general belief, that varieties are\r\ndistinguished from true species by their repeated reversion and that\r\neven such reversibility is the real distinction of a variety, would not\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I have taken much trouble in ascertaining the\r\ncircumstances which attend this form of atavism. I have visited a number\r\nof the leading nurseries of Europe, tested their products in various\r\nways, and made some experiments on the unavoidable conditions of\r\nhybridizing and on their effect on the ensuing generations. These\r\ninvestigations have led me to the conclusion, that atavism, as it is\r\ngenerally described, always or nearly always is due to hybridization,\r\nand therefore it is to be considered as untrue or false atavism.\r\n\r\nTrue atavism, or reversion caused by an innate latent  tendency, seems\r\nto be very rare, [188] and limited to such cases as we have spoken of\r\nunder our last heading. And since the definition, given to this term by\r\nits author, Duchesne, is generally accepted in scientific works, it\r\nseems better not to use it in another sense, but rather to replace it in\r\nsuch cases by another term. For this purpose I propose the word\r\nvicinism, derived from the Latin vicinus or neighbor, as indicating the\r\nsporting of a variety under the influence of others in its vicinity.\r\nUsed in this way, this term has the same bearing as the word atavism of\r\nthe breeders, but it has the advantage of indicating the true cause\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the term variability is commonly employed in the\r\nbroadest possible sense. No single phenomenon can be designated by this\r\nname, unless some primary restriction be given. Atavism and vicinism are\r\nboth cases of variability, but in wholly different sense. For this\r\nreason it may be as well, to insert here a short survey of the general\r\nmeanings to be conveyed by the term variation. It implies in the first\r\nplace the occurrence of a wide range of forms and types, irrespective of\r\ntheir origin, and in the second place the process of the change in such\r\nforms. In the first signification it is nearly identical with\r\npolymorphy, or richness of types, especially so when these [189] types\r\nare themselves quite stable, or when it is not at all intended to raise\r\nthe question of their stability. In scientific works it is commonly used\r\nto designate the occurrence of subspecies or varieties, and the same is\r\nthe case in the ordinary use of the term when dealing with cultivated\r\nplants. A species may consist of larger or smaller groups of such units,\r\nand they may be absolutely constant, never sporting if hybridization is\r\nprecluded, and nevertheless it may be called highly variable. The\r\nopium-poppy affords a good instance. It \"varies\" in height, in color of\r\nfoliage and flowers; the last are often double or laciniated; it may\r\nhave white or bluish seeds, the capsules may open themselves or remain\r\nclosed and so on. But every single variety is absolutely constant, and\r\nnever runs into another, when the flowers are artificially pollinated\r\nand the visits of insects excluded. So it is with many other species.\r\nThey are at the same time wholly stable and very variable.\r\n\r\nThe terms variation and variety are used frequently when speaking of\r\nhybrids. By crossing forms, which are already variable in the sense just\r\nmentioned, it is easy to multiply the number of the types, and even in\r\ncrossing pure forms the different characters may be combined in\r\ndifferent ways, the resulting combinations [190] yielding new, and very\r\noften, valuable varieties. But it is manifest that this form of\r\nvariation is of quite another nature from the variations of pure races.\r\nMany hybrid varieties are quite constant, and remain true to their type\r\nif no further crosses are made; many others are artificially propagated\r\nonly in a vegetative way, and for this reason are always found true.\r\nHybrid varieties as a rule were formerly confused with pure varieties,\r\nand in many instances our knowledge as to their origin is quite\r\ninsufficient for sharp distinctions. To every student of nature it is\r\nobvious, that crossing and pure variability are wholly distinct groups\r\nof phenomena, which should never be treated under the same head, or\r\nunder the same name.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside polymorphy, we may now discuss those cases of variability,\r\nin which the changes themselves, and not only their final results play a\r\npart. Of such changes two types exist. First, the ever-recurring\r\nvariability, never absent in any large group of individuals, and\r\ndetermining the differences which are always to be seen between parents\r\nand their children, or between the children themselves. This type is\r\ncommonly called \"individual variability\" and since this term also has\r\nstill other meanings, it has of late become customary to use instead the\r\nterm \"fluctuating variability.\" [191] And to avoid the repetition of the\r\nlatter word it is called \"fluctuation.\" In contrast to these\r\nfluctuations are the so-called sports or single varieties, not rarely\r\ndenominated spontaneous variations, and for which I propose to use the\r\nterm \"mutations.\" They are of very rare occurrence and are to be\r\nconsidered as sudden and definite steps.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have to consider those varieties, which vary in a much wider\r\nrange than the ordinary ones, and seem to fluctuate between two opposite\r\nextremes, as for instance variegated leaves, cultivated varieties with\r\nvariegated or striped flowers, double flowers and some other anomalies.\r\nThey are eversporting and ever-returning from one type to the other. If\r\nhowever, we take the group of these extremes and their intermediates as\r\na whole, this group remains constant during the succeeding generations.\r\nHere we find once more an instance of the seemingly contradictory\r\ncombination of high variability and absolute constancy. It means that\r\nthe range of variability has quite definite limits, which in the common\r\ncourse of things, are never transgressed.\r\n\r\nWe may infer therefore that the word variability has such a wide range\r\nof meanings that it ought never be used without explanation. [192]\r\nNothing indeed, is more variable than the signification of the term\r\nvariable itself.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we will furthermore designate all variations under the\r\ninfluence of neighbors with the new and special term \"vicinism.\" It\r\nalways indicates the result of crossing.\r\n\r\nLeaving this somewhat lengthy terminological discussion, we now come to\r\nthe description of the phenomenon itself. In visiting the plantations of\r\nthe seedsmen in summer and examining the large fields of garden-flowers\r\nfrom which seed is to be gathered, it is very rare to find a plot quite\r\npure. On the contrary, occasional impurities are the rule. Every plot\r\nshows anomalous individuals, red or white flowers among a field of blue,\r\nnormal among laciniated, single among double and so on. The most curious\r\ninstance is afforded by dwarf varieties, where in the midst of hundreds\r\nand thousands of small individuals of the same height, some specimens\r\nshow twice their size. So for instance, among the dwarfs of the\r\nlarkspur, _Delphinium Ajacis_.\r\n\r\nEverywhere gardeners are occupied in destroying these \"atavists,\" as\r\nthey call them. When in full bloom the plants are pulled up and thrown\r\naside. Sometimes the degree of impurity is so high, that great piles of\r\ndiscarded plants of the same species lie about the [193] paths, as I\r\nhave seen at Erfurt in the ease of numerous varieties of the Indian\r\ncress or _Tropaeolum_.\r\n\r\nEach variety is purified at the time when it shows its characters most\r\nclearly. With vegetables, this is done long before flowering, but with\r\nflowers only when in full bloom, and with fruits, usually after\r\nfertilization has been accomplished. It needs no demonstration to show\r\nthat this difference in method must result in very diverging degrees of\r\npurity.\r\n\r\nWe will confine ourselves to a consideration of the flowers, and ask\r\nwhat degree of purity may be expected as the result of the elimination\r\nof the anomalous plants during the period of blooming.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that the colors and forms of the flowers can only be\r\nclearly distinguished, when they are fully displayed. Furthermore it is\r\nimpossible to destroy every single aberrant specimen as soon as it is\r\nseen. On the contrary, the gardener must wait until all or nearly all\r\nthe individuals of the same variety have displayed their characters, as\r\nonly in this way can all diverging specimens be eliminated by a single\r\ninspection. Unfortunately the insects do not wait for this selection.\r\nThey fertilize the flowers from the beginning, and the damage will have\r\nbeen done [194] long before the day of inspection comes around. Crosses\r\nare unavoidable and hybrid seeds will unavoidably come into the harvest.\r\nTheir number may be limited by an early eradication of the vicinists, or\r\nby the elimination of the first ripe seeds before the beginning of the\r\nregular harvest, or by other devices. But some degree of impurity will\r\nremain under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite superfluous to give more details. In any case in which\r\nthe selection is not done before the blooming period, some impurities\r\nmust result. Even if it is done before that time, errors may occur, and\r\namong hundreds and thousands of individuals a single anomalous one may\r\nescape observation.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, that flower seeds as they are offered in commerce,\r\nare seldom found absolutely pure. Every gardener knows that he will have\r\nto weed out aberrant plants in order to be sure of the purity of his\r\nbeds. I tested a large number of samples of seeds for purity, bought\r\ndirectly from the best seed growers. Most of them were found to contain\r\nadmixtures and wholly pure samples were very rare.\r\n\r\nI will now give some illustrative examples. From seeds of a yellow\r\nsnapdragon, I got one red-flowered specimen among half a hundred [195]\r\nyellow ones, and from the variety \"Delila\" of the same species two red\r\nones, a single white and two belonging to another variety called\r\n\"Firefly.\" _Calliopsis tinctoria_ has three varieties, the ordinary\r\ntype, a brown-flowered one and one with tubular rays. Seeds of each of\r\nthese three sorts ordinarily contain a few belonging to the others.\r\n_Iberis umbellata rosea_ often gives some white and violet examples. The\r\n\"Swan\" variety of the opium-poppy, a dwarfish double-flowered form of a\r\npure white, contained some single-flowered and some red-flowered plants,\r\nwhen sown from commercial seed are said to be pure. But these were only\r\noccasional admixtures, since after artificial fertilization of the\r\ntypical specimens the strain at once became absolutely pure, and\r\nremained so for a series of generations, as long as the experiment was\r\ncontinued. Seeds of trees often contain large quantities of impurities,\r\nand the laciniated varieties of birch, elder and walnut have often been\r\nobserved to come true only in a small number of seedlings.\r\n\r\nIn the case of new or young varieties, seed merchants often warn their\r\ncustomers as to the probable degree of purity of the seeds offered, in\r\norder to avoid complaints. For example the snow-white variety of the\r\ndouble daisy, _Bellis perennis plena_, was offered at the start as\r\ncontaining [196] as much as 20% of red-flowered specimens.\r\n\r\nMany fine varieties are recorded to come true from seed, as in the case\r\nof the holly with yellow fruits, tested by Darwin. Others have been\r\nfound untrue to a relatively high degree, as is notorious in the case of\r\nthe purple beech. Seeds of the laciniated beech gave only 10% of\r\nlaciniated plants in experiments made by Strasburger; seeds of the\r\nmonophyllous acacia, _Robinia Pseud-Acacia monophylla_, were found to be\r\ntrue in only 30% of the seedlings. Weeping ashes often revert to the\r\nupright type, red May-thorns (_Crataegus_) sometimes revert nearly\r\nentirely to the white species and the yellow cornel berry is recorded to\r\nhave reverted in the same way to the red berries of the _Cornus Mas_.\r\n\r\nVarieties have to be freed by selection from all such impurities, since\r\nisolation is a means which is quite impracticable under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. Isolation is a scientific requirement that should never\r\nbe neglected in experiments, indeed it may be said to be the first and\r\nmost important requisite for all exact research in questions of\r\nvariability and inheritance. But in cultivating large fields of allied\r\nvarieties for commercial purposes, it is impossible to grow them at such\r\ndistances from each other [197] as to prevent cross-pollination by the\r\nvisits of bees.\r\n\r\nThis purification must be done in nearly every generation. The oldest\r\nvarieties are to be subjected to it as well as the latest. There is no\r\nregular amelioration, no slow progression in the direction of becoming\r\nfree from these admixtures. Continuous selection is indispensable to\r\nmaintain the races in the degree of purity which is required in\r\ncommerce, but it does not lead to any improvement. Nor does it go so far\r\nas to become unnecessary in the future. This shows that there must be a\r\ncontinuous source of impurities, which in itself is not neutralized by\r\nselection, but of which selection can only eliminate the deteriorating\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe same selection is usually applied to new varieties, when they\r\noccasionally arise. In this case it is called \"fixing,\" as gardeners\r\ngenerally believe that through selection the varieties are brought to\r\nthe required degree of purity. This belief seems to rest mainly on\r\nobservations made in practice, where, as we have seen, isolation is of\r\nvery rare application. Most varieties would no doubt be absolutely pure\r\nfrom the first moment of their existence, if it were only possible to\r\nhave them purely fertilized. But in practice this is seldom to be\r\nobtained. Ordinarily the breeder is content with such slow [198]\r\nimprovement as may be obtained with a minimum of cost, and this mostly\r\nimplies a culture in the same part of the nursery with older varieties\r\nof the same species. Three, four or five years are required to purify\r\nthe novelty, and as this same length of time is also required to produce\r\nsufficient quantities of seed for commercial purposes, there is no\r\nstrong desire to shorten the period of selection and fixation. I had\r\noccasion to see this process going on with sundry novelties at Erfurt in\r\nGermany. Among them a chamois-colored variety of the common stock, a\r\nbluish _Clarkia elegans_ and a curiously colored opium-poppy may be\r\nmentioned. In some cases the crossfertilization is so overwhelming, that\r\nin the next generation the novelty seems entirely to have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe examples given may suffice to convey a general idea of the\r\nphenomenon, ordinarily called atavism by gardeners, and considered\r\nmostly to be the effect of some innate tendency to revert to the\r\nancestral form. It is on this conception that the almost universal\r\nbelief rests, that varieties are distinguished, as such, from species by\r\ntheir inconstancy. Now I do not deny the phenomenon itself. The impurity\r\nof seeds and cultures is so general and so manifest, and may so easily\r\nbe tested by every one [199] that it cannot reasonably be subjected to\r\nany doubt. It must be conceded to be a fact, that varieties as a rule\r\nrevert to their species under the ordinary circumstances of commercial\r\nculture. And I cannot see any reason why this fact should not be\r\nconsidered as stating a principal difference between varieties and\r\nspecies, since true species never sport into one another.\r\n\r\nMy objection only refers to the explanation of the observed facts.\r\nAccording to my view nearly all these ordinary reversions are due to\r\ncrosses, and it is for this reason that I proposed to call them by a\r\nseparate name, that of \"vicinists.\" Varieties then, by means of such\r\nspontaneous intercrossing sport into one another, while species either\r\ndo not cross, or when crossing produce hybrids that are otherwise\r\nconstituted and do not give the impression of atavistic reversion.\r\n\r\nI must not be content with proposing this new conception, but must give\r\nthe facts on which this assumption rests. These facts are the results of\r\nsimple experiments, which nevertheless are by no means easy to carry\r\nout, as they require the utmost care to secure the absolute purity of\r\nthe seeds that are employed. This can only be guaranteed by previous\r\ncultures of isolated plants or groups of plants, or by artificial\r\npollination.\r\n\r\n[200] Once sure of this preliminary condition, the experiment simply\r\nconsists in growing a variety at a given distance from its species and\r\nallowing the insects to transfer the pollen. After harvesting the seed\r\nthus subjected to the presumed cause of the impurities, it must be sown\r\nin quantities, large enough to bring to light any slight anomaly, and to\r\nbe examined during the period of blooming.\r\n\r\nThe wild seashore aster, _Aster Tripolium_, will serve as an example. It\r\nhas pale violet or bluish rays, but has given rise to a white variety,\r\nwhich on testing, I have found pure from seed. Four specimens of this\r\nwhite variety were cultivated at a distance of nearly 100 meters from a\r\nlarge lot of plants of the bluish species. I left fertilization to the\r\nbees, harvested the seeds of the four whites separately and had from\r\nthem the following year more than a thousand flowering plants. All of\r\nthem were of the purest white, with only one exception, which was a\r\nplant with the bluish rays of the species, wholly reverting to its\r\ngeneral type. As the variety does not give such reversions when\r\ncultivated in isolation, this sport was obviously due to some cross in\r\nthe former year. In the same way I tried the white Jacob's ladder,\r\n_Polemonium coeruleum_ album in the neighborhood of the blue-flowered\r\nspecies, the distance [202] in this case being only 40 meters. Of two\r\nhundred seeds one became a blue atavist, or rather vicinist, while all\r\nothers remained true to the white type. The same was observed in the\r\nwhite creeping thyme, or _Thymus Serpyllum album_, and the white\r\nself-heal, _Brunella vulgaris alba_, gave even so much as 28% seedlings\r\nwith purple corollas out of some 400 specimens, after being cultivated\r\nin close proximity to its parent-species. I have tried many other\r\nspecies, but always with the same result. Such atavists only arise by\r\ncultivation in the proximity of allied varieties, never in isolation.\r\nThey are not real atavists, but only vicinists.\r\n\r\nIn order to show this yet more clearly, I made another experiment with\r\nthe white selfheal. I had a lot of the pinnate-leaved variety with\r\npurple flowers and somewhat stouter stems, and cultivated single plants\r\nof the whiteflowering sort at distances that varied from 2-16 meters.\r\nThe seeds of each plant were collected and sown separately, those of the\r\nnearest gave up to 5 or 6 hybrids from the seeds of one parent, while\r\nthose of the farthest gave only one purple-flowered plant for each\r\nparent. Evidently the chance of the pollen being carried by bees is much\r\ngreater on short than on longer distances.\r\n\r\nTrue hybrids between species may arise in quite the same way, and since\r\nit is obviously impossible to attribute them to an innate tendency to\r\nreversion, they afford an absolutely irrefutable proof of the assertion\r\nthat pollen is often brought by insects from one lot of plants to\r\nanother. In this way I obtained a hybrid between the common Jacob's\r\nladder and the allied species _Polemonium dissectum_. With a distance of\r\n100 meters between them I had two hybrid seeds among a hundred of pure\r\nones. At a similar distance pollen was carried over from the wild\r\nradish, _Raphanus Raphanistrum_, to the allied _Raphanus caudatus_, and\r\nI observed the following year some very nice hybrids among my seedlings.\r\nA hybrid-bean between _Phaseolus nanus_ and _P. multiflorus_, and some\r\nhybrids between the yellow daisy, _Chrysanthemum segetum_ and the allied\r\n_Chrysanthemum coronarium_ or ox-eye daisy which also arose\r\nspontaneously in my garden between parents cultivated at recorded\r\ndistances, might further be noted. Further details of these experiments\r\nneed not be given. Suffice to say, that occasional crosses between\r\nspecies do occur, and not even rarely, that they are easily recognized\r\nas such and cannot be confused with cases of atavism, and that therefore\r\nthey give proof to the assumption that in the same way crosses\r\nordinarily occur also between varieties [203] of the same species, if\r\ncultivated at small distances apart, say 40-50 meters or even more.\r\nVicinism therefore, may play a part in all such cultures, enough to\r\naccount for all the impurities observed in the nurseries or in\r\ncommercial seed-samples.\r\n\r\nOf course this whole discussion is limited to such species as are not\r\nonly as a rule visited by insects, but are dependent on these visits for\r\ntheir fertilization. Most of our garden-flowers are included in this\r\ncategory. If not then we may expect to find the cultures and seeds pure,\r\nirrespective of the distances between allied varieties, as for instance\r\nwith peas, which are known to be self-fertilizing. Another instance is\r\ngiven by the barley. One of the most curious anomalous varieties of this\r\ncereal, is the \"Nepaul-barley,\" with its small adventitious flowers on\r\nthe palets or inner scales. It is a very old, widely cultivated sort,\r\nwhich always comes true from seed, and which has been tested in repeated\r\nexperiments in my garden. The spikelets of this curious plant are\r\noneflowered and provided with two linear glumes or outer scales. Of the\r\ninner scales or palets, the outer one is three-lobed at the summit,\r\nhence the varietal name of _Hordeum vulgare trifurcatum_. The central\r\nlobe is oblong and hollow, covering a small supernumerary floret\r\ninserted [204] at its base. The two lateral lobes are narrower,\r\nsometimes linear, and are often prolonged into an awn, which is\r\ngenerally turned away from the center of the spike. The central lobe\r\nsometimes bears two florets at its base, although but one is usually\r\npresent and it may be incomplete.\r\n\r\nI might give one more instance from my own experience. A variety of the\r\nevening-primrose with small linear petals was once found by one of my\r\nsons growing wild near Amsterdam. It was represented by only one\r\nindividual, flowering among a great many of the ordinary type with broad\r\npetals. But the evening-primroses open their anthers in the morning,\r\nfertilize themselves during the day, and only display their beautiful\r\nflowers in the evening, after the pollination has been accomplished.\r\nThey then allure evening moths, such as _Agrotis_ and _Plusia_, by their\r\nbright color, their sweet honeysmell and their nectar. Since the\r\nfertilization is accomplished many hours before opening, crosses are\r\neffected only in rare instances, and the seeds commonly remain true to\r\nthe parent type. The seeds of this one plant, when sown separately in my\r\ngarden, produced exclusively flowers with the small linear petals of\r\ntheir parent. Although I had a hundred individuals bearing many\r\nthousands of flowers, there was not an instance of reversion. And such\r\nwould [205] immediately have been observed, had it occurred, because the\r\nhybrids between the cruciate and the normal flowers are not\r\nintermediate, but bear the broad petals of the _O. biennis_.\r\n\r\nWe may now take up another phase of the question, that of the running\r\nout of new varieties, shortly after their introduction into a new\r\ncountry, or later.\r\n\r\nThe most widely known instance of this is that of the American corn in\r\nBaden, recorded by Metzger and quoted by Darwin as a remarkable instance\r\nof the direct and prompt action of climate on a plant. It has since been\r\nconsidered as a reversion to the old type. Such reversions invariably\r\noccur, according to Wallace, in cases of new varieties, which have been\r\nproduced quickly. But as we now know, such reversions are due to\r\nspontaneous crosses with the old form, and to the rule, that the hybrids\r\nof such origin are not intermediate, but assume the features of the\r\nolder of the two parents. In the light of this experience, Metzger's\r\nobservation becomes a typical instance of vicinism. It relates to the\r\n\"Tuscarora\" corn of St. Louis, a variety with broad and flat white\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1840, this corn was introduced into Baden in Germany, and\r\ncultivated by Metzger. In the first year it came true to type, and [206]\r\nattained a height of 12 feet, but the season did not allow its seeds to\r\nripen normally. Only a few kernels were developed before the winter.\r\nFrom this seed plants of a wholly different type came the next year, of\r\nsmaller stature, and with more brownish and rounded kernels. They also\r\nflowered earlier and ripened a large number of seeds. The depression on\r\nthe outer side of the seed had almost disappeared, and the original\r\nwhite had become darker. Some of the seeds had even become yellow and in\r\ntheir rounded form they approached the common European maize. Obviously\r\nthey were hybrids, assuming the character of their pollen-parent, which\r\nevidently was the ordinary corn, cultivated all around. The observation\r\nof the next year showed this clearly, for in the third generation nearly\r\nall resemblance to the original and very distinct American species was\r\nlost. If we assume that only those seeds ripened which reverted to the\r\nearly-ripening European type, and that those that remained true to the\r\nvery late American variety could not reach maturity, the case seems to\r\nbe wholly comprehensible, without supposing any other factors to have\r\nbeen at work than those of vicinism, which though unknown at the period\r\nof Metzger's and Darwin's writings, seems now to be fully understood. No\r\ninnate tendency to run out and no changing influence of the climate are\r\nrequired for an adequate explanation of the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the observation quoted, what astonishes us most, is the great\r\nrapidity of the change, and the short time necessary for the offspring\r\nof the accidental crosses to completely supplant the introduced type. In\r\nthe lecture on the selection of elementary species, closely analogous\r\ncases were described. One of them was the wild oat or _Avena fatua_\r\nwhich rapidly supplants the cultivated oats in bad years in parts of the\r\nfields. Other instances were the experiments of Risler with the\r\n\"Galland\" wheat and the observation of Rimpau on \"Rivett's bearded\"\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the question of vicinism and its bearing on the general\r\nbelief of the instability of varieties, which when tested with due care,\r\nprove to be quite stable, it may be as well to consider the phenomena\r\nfrom another point of view. Our present knowledge of the effects of\r\ncrosses between varieties enables us to formulate some general rules,\r\nwhich may be used to calculate, and in some way to predict, the nature\r\nof the impurities which necessarily attend the cultivation of allied\r\nspecies in close vicinity. And this mode of cultivation being in almost\r\nuniversal use in the larger nurseries, [208] we may, by this discussion,\r\narrive at a more scientific estimation of the phenomena of vicinism,\r\nhitherto described.\r\n\r\nThe simplest case that may be given, is when an ordinary retrograde\r\nvariety is cultivated with the species to which it belongs. For\r\ninstance, if dwarfs are cultivated next to the taller type, or a white\r\nvariety next to the red or blue-flowering species, or thornless forms in\r\nneighboring beds with the armed species. Bees and Bumble-bees,\r\nbutterflies and moths are seen flying from flower to flower, collecting\r\nthe honey and carrying pollen. I frequently saw them cross the limits of\r\nthe neighboring beds. Loaded with the pollen of the variety they visit\r\nthe flowers of the different species and impregnate the stigma with it.\r\nAnd returning to the variety they bring about similar crosses in the\r\nflowers of the latter. Hybrid seeds will develop in both cases and\r\nbecome mixed with the crop. We now have to ask the question, what sort\r\nof plants will arise from these hybrid seeds. As a general rule we may\r\nstate, first, that the hybrids of either form of cross are practically\r\nthe same, secondly that they are not intermediate, but that the\r\ncharacter of one parent prevails to the almost absolute exclusion of the\r\nother and in the third place that the older character dominates the\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\n[209] The hybrid offspring will therefore, in the main, have the\r\ncharacter of the species and be indistinguishable from it, or show only\r\nsuch differences as escape ordinary observation. When occurring in the\r\nseeds of the variety they betray themselves as soon as the differential\r\ncharacters are displayed. Between the thousands of flowering plants of a\r\nwhite variety the hybrids will instantly catch the eye by their red or\r\nblue corollas. Quite the contrary effect results from the admixture of\r\nhybrids with the seeds of the species itself. Here no difference will\r\nshow itself, even in the fullest bloom. The effect of the spontaneous\r\ncrosses will pass unobserved. The strain, if pure in the first year,\r\nwill seem to be still in the same condition. Or in other terms, the\r\nunavoidable spontaneous crosses will disturb the purity of the variety\r\nin the second year, while they do not seem to interfere at all with the\r\nuniformity of the species. The direct effect of the visits of the\r\ninsects is evident in the first case, but passes unobserved in the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem, that spontaneous crosses are hurtful to\r\nvarieties, but are innocuous to true species. Certainly this would be\r\nso, were there no selection. But it is easily seen, that through this\r\noperation the effect becomes quite the opposite. For when the fields\r\n[210] are inspected at the time of the fullest display of the varietal\r\ncharacters, the obvious hybrids will be eliminated, but the hidden ones\r\nwill of necessity be spared, as they are concealed among the species by\r\nthe similarity of their type. Hence, the harvest of the variety may be\r\nrendered pure or nearly so, while the harvest of the species will retain\r\nthe seeds of the hybrids. Moreover it will contain seeds originated by\r\nthe spontaneous but numerous crosses of the true plants with the\r\nsparsely intermingled hybrids.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the question, as to what will be the visible\r\nconsequences of the occurrence of such invisible hybrids in the\r\nfollowing generation. In opposition to the direct effects just\r\ndescribed, we may call them indirect. To judge of their influence, we\r\nmust know how hybrid seeds of the first generation behave.\r\n\r\nIn one of our lectures we will deal with the laws that show the\r\nnumerical relations known as the laws of Mendel. But for our present\r\npurpose, these numerical relations are only of subordinate importance.\r\nWhat interests us here is the fact that hybrids of varieties do not\r\nremain constant in the second generation but usually split as it is\r\nsaid, remaining hybrid only in part of their offspring, the other\r\nportion returning to the parental types. This however, will show itself\r\nonly in those individuals [211] which reassume the character of the\r\nvarietal parent, all the others apparently remaining true to the type of\r\nthe species. Now it is easy to foresee what must happen in the second\r\ngeneration if the first generation after the cross is supposed to be\r\nkept free from new vicinistic influences, or from crosses with\r\nneighboring varieties.\r\n\r\nWe may limit ourselves in the first place to the seeds of the unobserved\r\nhybrids. For the greater part they will repeat the character of their\r\nparents and still remain concealed. But a small number will display the\r\nvarietal marks, as for example showing white flowers in a field of blue\r\nones. Hence, the indirect consequence of the spontaneous crosses will be\r\nthe same in the species, as was the direct effect in the variety, only\r\nthat it appears a year later. It will then be eliminated in the process\r\nof selection.\r\n\r\nObviously, this elimination conduces only to a partial purification. The\r\nconspicuous plants will be destroyed, but a greater number of hybrids\r\nwill remain, still concealed by their resemblance to the general type\r\nand will be spared to repeat the same process next year. So while the\r\nvariety may be freed every year from the impurities brought into it in\r\nthe preceeding summer, the admixtures of the species [212] will continue\r\nduring a number of years, and it may not be possible to get rid of them\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nIt is an often recurring assertion that white varieties of colored\r\nspecies are the most stable of all horticultural races. They are often\r\nsaid to be at least as constant as the species itself, and even to\r\nsurpass it in this quality. With our present state of knowledge, the\r\nexplanation of this general experience is easily given. For selection\r\nremoves the effect of spontaneous crosses from the variety in each year,\r\nand renders it practically pure, while it is wholly inadequate to\r\nproduce the same effects on the species, because of the concealed\r\nhybrids.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given in this simple instance may be applied to the case\r\nof different varieties of the same species, when growing together and\r\ncrossed naturally by insects.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to go into all the details that present\r\nthemselves here to the student of nature and of gardens. I will only\r\nstate, that since varieties differ principally from their species by the\r\nlack of some sharp character, one variety may be characterized by the\r\nlack of color of the flowers, another by the lack of pubescence, a third\r\nby being dwarfed, and so on. Every character must be studied separately\r\nin its effects on the offspring [213] of the crosses. And it is\r\ntherefore easily seen, that the hybrids of two varieties may resemble\r\nneither of them, but revert to the species itself. This is necessarily\r\nand commonly the case, since it is always the older or positive\r\ncharacters that prevail in the hybrids and the younger or negative that\r\nlie hidden. So for instance, a blue dwarf larkspur, crossed with a tall\r\nwhite variety, must give a tall blue hybrid, reassuming in both\r\ncharacters the essentials of the species.\r\n\r\nKeeping this rule in view, it will be easy to calculate what may be\r\nexpected from spontaneous crosses for a wide range of occurrences, and\r\nthus to find an explanation of innumerable cases of apparent variability\r\nand reversion in the principle of vicinism. Students have only to\r\nrecollect that specific characters prevail over varietal ones, and that\r\nevery character competes only with its own antagonist. Or to give a\r\nsharper distinction: whiteness of flowers cannot be expected to be\r\ninterchanged with pubescence of leaves.\r\n\r\nIn concluding I will point out another danger which in the principle of\r\nvicinism may be avoided. If you see a plant in a garden with all the\r\ncharacteristics of its species, how can you be sure that it is truly a\r\nrepresentative of the species, and not a hybrid? The prevailing [214]\r\ncharacters are in either case the same. Perhaps on close inspection you\r\nmay find in some cases a slight difference, some character being not as\r\nfully developed in the hybrid as in the species. But when such is not\r\nthe case, or where the opportunity for such a closer examination is\r\nwanting, a hybrid may easily be taken for a specimen of the pure race.\r\nNow take the seeds of your plant and sow them. If you had not supposed\r\nit to be hybrid you will be astonished at finding among its progeny some\r\nof a wholly different type. You will be led to conclude that you are\r\nobserving a sudden change in structure such as is usually called a\r\nsport.\r\n\r\nOr in other words you may think that you are assisting at the\r\norigination of a new variety. If you are familiar with the principle of\r\nvicinism, you will refrain from such an inference and consider the\r\nsupposition of a hybrid origin. But in former times, when this principle\r\nwas still unknown and not even guessed at, it is evident that many\r\nmistakes must have been made, and that many an instance, which until now\r\nhas been considered reliable proof of a so-called single variation, is\r\nin fact only a case of vicinism. In reading the sparse literature on\r\nsports, numerous cases will be found, which cannot stand this test. In\r\nmany instances crossing must be looked to as an explanation, [215] and\r\nin other cases the evidence relied upon does not suffice to exclude this\r\nassumption. Many an old argument has of late lost its force by this\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nReturning to our starting point we may now state that regular reversions\r\nto a specific type characterize a form as a variety of that species.\r\nThese reversions, however, are not due to an innate tendency, but to\r\nunobserved spontaneous crosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[217]\r\n\r\nLECTURE VIII\r\n\r\nLATENT CHARACTERS\r\n\r\nNo organism exhibits all of its qualities at any one time. Many of them\r\nare generally dormant and await a period of activity. For some of them\r\nthis period comes regularly, while in others the awakening depends upon\r\nexternal influences, and consequently occurs very irregularly. Those of\r\nthe first group correspond to the differences in age; the second\r\nconstitute the responses of the plant to stimuli including\r\nwound-injuries.\r\n\r\nSome illustrative examples may be quoted in order to give a precise idea\r\nof this general conception of dormant or latent characters. Seed leaves\r\nare only developed in the seed and the seedling; afterwards, during the\r\nentire lifetime of the plant, the faculty of producing them is not made\r\nuse of. Every new generation of seeds however, bears the same kind of\r\nseed leaves, and hence it is manifest that it is the same quality, which\r\nshows itself from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe primary leaves, following the seed-leaves, are different in many\r\nspecies, from the later ones, and the difference is extremely pronounced\r\nin some cases of reduction. Often, when leaves are lacking in the adult\r\nplant, being replaced by flattened stalks as in the case of the acacias,\r\nor by thorns, or green stems and twigs as in the prickly broom or _Ulex\r\neuropaeus_, the first leaves of the young plant may be more highly\r\ndifferentiated, being pinnate in the first case and bearing three\r\nleaflets in the second instance. This curious behavior which is very\r\ncommon, brings the plants, when young, nearer to their allies than in\r\nthe adult state, and manifestly implies that the more perfect state of\r\nthe leaves is latent throughout the life of the plant, with the\r\nexception of the early juvenile period.\r\n\r\n_Eucalyptus Globulus_, the Australian gum tree, has opposite and broadly\r\nsessile leaves during the first years of its life. Later these disappear\r\nand are replaced by long sickle-shaped foliage organs, which seem to be\r\nscattered irregularly along the branches. The juvenile characters\r\nmanifestly lie dormant during the adult period, and that this is so, may\r\nbe shown artificially by cutting off the whole crown of the tree, when\r\nthe stem responds by producing numerous new branches, which assume the\r\n[218] shape proper to the young trees, bearing sessile and opposite\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite unnecessary to give further instances. They are familiar\r\nto every student. It is almost safe to say that every character has its\r\nperiods of activity and of inactivity, and numbers of flowers and fruits\r\ncan be mentioned as illustrations. One fact may be added to show that\r\nnearly every part of the plant must have the power of producing all or\r\nnearly all the characters of the individual to which it belongs. This\r\nproof is given by the formation of adventitious buds. These, when once\r\nformed, may grow out into twigs, with leaves and flowers and roots. They\r\nmay even be separated from the plants and used as cuttings to reproduce\r\nthe whole. Hence we may conclude that all tissues, which possess the\r\npower of producing adventitious buds, must conceal in a latent state,\r\nall the numerous characters required for the full development of the\r\nwhole individual.\r\n\r\nAdventitious buds may proceed from specialized cells, as on the margin\r\nof the leaves of _Bryophyllum calycinum_; or from the cells of special\r\ntissues, as in the epidermis of the begonias; or they may be provoked by\r\nwounds in nearly every part of the plant, provided it be able to heal\r\nthe wound by swelling tissues or [219] callus. The best instance is\r\nafforded by elms and by the horse-chestnut. If the whole tree is hewn\r\ndown the trunk tries to repair the injury by producing small\r\ngranulations of tissue between the wood and the bark, which gradually\r\ncoalesce while becoming larger. From this new ring of living matter\r\ninnumerable buds arise, that expand into leafy branches, showing clearly\r\nthat the old trunk possesses, in a latent state, all the qualities of\r\nthe whole crown. Indeed, such injured stumps may be used for the\r\nproduction of copses and hedges.\r\n\r\nAll the hitherto recorded cases of latency have this in common, that\r\nthey may become active during the life-time of any given individual\r\nonce, or oftener. This may be called the ordinary type of latency.\r\n\r\nBesides this there is another form of latent characters, in which this\r\nawakening power is extremely limited, or wholly absent. It is the\r\nsystematic latency, which may be said to belong to species and varieties\r\nin the same way as the ordinary latency belongs to individuals. As this\r\nindividual latency may show itself from time to time during the life of\r\na given plant, the first may only become active from time to time during\r\nthe whole existence of the variety or the species. It has no regular\r\nperiod of activity, nor may it be incited by artificial stimulation.\r\n\r\n[220] It emerges from concealment only very rarely and only on its own\r\ninitiative. Such instances of atavism have been described in previous\r\nlectures, and their existence has been proved beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nSystematic latency explains the innumerable instances in which species\r\nare seen to lack definite characteristics which ordinarily do not fail,\r\neither in plants at large, or in the group or family to which the plant\r\nbelongs. If we take for instance the broom-rape or _Orobanche_, or some\r\nother pale parasite, we explain their occurrence in families of plants\r\nwith green leaves, by the loss of the leaves and of the green color. But\r\nevidently this loss is not a true one, but only the latency of those\r\ncharacters. And even this latency is not a complete one, as little\r\nscales remind us of the leaves, and traces of chlorophyll still exist in\r\nthe tissues. Numerous other cases will present themselves to every\r\npractical botanist.\r\n\r\nTaking for granted that characters, having once been acquired, may\r\nbecome latent, and that this process is of universal occurrence\r\nthroughout the whole vegetable and animal kingdom, we may now come to a\r\nmore precise and clear conception of the existing differences between\r\nspecies and varieties.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose we must take a somewhat [221] broader view of the whole\r\nevolution of the vegetable kingdom. It is manifest that highly developed\r\nplants have a larger number of characters than the lower groups. These\r\nmust have been acquired in some way, during preceding times. Such\r\nevolution must evidently be called a process of improvement, or a\r\nprogressive evolution. Contrasted to this is the loss, or the latency of\r\ncharacters, and this may be designated retrogressive or retrograde\r\nevolution. But there is still a third possibility. For a latent\r\ncharacter may reassume its activity, return to the active state, and\r\nbecome once more an important part of the whole organization. This\r\nprocess may be designated as degressive evolution; it obviously\r\ncompletes the series of the general types of evolution.\r\n\r\nAdvancement in general in living nature depends on progressive\r\nevolution. In different parts of the vegetable kingdom, and even in\r\ndifferent families this progression takes place on different lines. By\r\nthis means it results in an ever increasing divergency between the\r\nseveral groups. Every step is an advance, and many a step must have been\r\ntaken to produce flowering plants from the simplest unicellular algae.\r\n\r\nBut related to, and very intimately connected with this advancement is\r\nthe retrogressive [222] evolution. It is equally universal, perhaps\r\nnever failing. No great changes have been attained, without acquiring\r\nnew qualities on one side, and reducing others to latency. Everywhere\r\nsuch retrogressions may be seen. The polypetalous genera _Pyrola_,\r\n_Ledum_, and _Monotropa_ among the sympetalous heaths, are a remarkable\r\ninstance of this. The whole evolution of the monocotyledons from the\r\nlowest orders of dicotyledons implies the seeming loss of cambial growth\r\nand many other qualities. In the order of aroids, from the calamus-root\r\nor sweet flag, with its small but complete flowers, up to the reduced\r\nduckweeds (_Lemna_), almost an unbroken line of intermediate steps may\r\nbe traced showing everywhere the concurrence of progressive and\r\nretrogressive evolution.\r\n\r\nDegressive evolution is not so common by far, and is not so easy to\r\nrecognize, but no doubt it occurs very frequently. It is generally\r\ncalled atavism, or better, systematic atavism, and the clearest cases\r\nare those in which a quality which is latent in the greater part of a\r\nfamily or group, becomes manifest in one of its members. Bracts in the\r\ninflorescence of crucifers are ordinarily wanting, but may be seen in\r\nsome genera, _Erucastrum pollichii_ being perhaps the [223] most widely\r\nknown instance, although other cases might easily be cited.\r\n\r\nFor our special purpose we may take up only the more simple cases that\r\nmay be available for experimental work. The great lines of evolution of\r\nwhole families and even of genera and of many larger species obviously\r\nlie outside the limits of experimental observation. They are the outcome\r\nof the history of the ancestors of the present types, and a repetition\r\nof their history is far beyond human powers. We must limit ourselves to\r\nthe most recent steps, to the consideration of the smallest differences.\r\nBut it is obvious that these may be included under the same heads as the\r\nlarger and older ones. For the larger movements are manifestly to be\r\nconsidered only as groups of smaller steps, going in the same direction.\r\n\r\nHence we conclude, that even the smallest steps in the evolution of\r\nplants which we are able to observe, may be divided into progressive,\r\nretrogressive and degressive ones. The acquisition of a single new\r\nquality is the most simple step in the progressive line, the becoming\r\nlatent and the reactivating of this same quality are the prototypes of\r\nthe two other classes.\r\n\r\nHaving taken this theoretical point of view, it remains to inquire, how\r\nit concurs with the [224] various facts, given in former lectures and\r\nhow it may be of use in our further discussions.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the differences between elementary species and\r\nvarieties on the one hand, and between the positive and negative\r\nvarieties as distinguished above, are quite comparable with our\r\ntheoretical views. For we have seen that varieties can always be\r\nconsidered as having originated by an apparent loss of some quality of\r\nthe species, or by the resumption of a quality which in allied species\r\nis present and visible. In our exposition of the facts we have of course\r\nlimited ourselves to the observable features of the phenomena without\r\nsearching for a further explanation. For a more competent inquiry\r\nhowever, and for an understanding of wider ranges of facts, it is\r\nnecessary to penetrate deeper into the true nature of the implied\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nTherefore we must try to show that elementary species are distinguished\r\nfrom each other by the acquisition of new qualities, and that varieties\r\nare derived from their species either by the reduction of one or more\r\ncharacteristics to the latent state, or by the energizing of dormant\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nHere we meet with a great difficulty. Hitherto varieties and subspecies\r\nhave never been clearly defined, or when they have been, it was [225]\r\nnot by physiological, but only by morphological research. And the claims\r\nof these two great lines of inquiry are obviously very diverging.\r\nMorphological or comparative studies need a material standard, by which\r\nit may be readily decided whether certain groups of animals and plants\r\nare to be described or de-nominated as species, as subspecies or as\r\nvarieties. To get at the inner nature of the differences is in most\r\ncases impossible, but a decision must be made. The physiological line of\r\ninquiry has more time at its disposal; it calls for no haste. Its\r\nexperiments ordinarily cover years, and a conclusion is only to be\r\nreached after long and often weary trials. There is no making a decision\r\non any matter until all doubtful points have been cleared up. Of course,\r\nlarge groups of facts remain uncertain, awaiting a closer inquiry, and\r\nthe teacher is constrained to rely on the few known instances of\r\nthoroughly investigated cases. These alone are safe guides, and it seems\r\nfar better to trust to them and to make use of them for the construction\r\nof sharp conceptions, which may help us to point out the lines of\r\ninquiry which are still open.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside all such divisions and definitions, as were stamped with\r\nthe name of provisional species and varieties by the great systematist,\r\n[226] Alphonse De Candolle, we may now try to give the proofs of our\r\nassertion, by using only those instances that have been thoroughly\r\ntested in every way.\r\n\r\nWe may at once proceed to the retrogressive or negative varieties. The\r\narguments for the assumption that elementary species owe their origin to\r\nthe acquisition of new qualities may well be left for later lectures\r\nwhen we shall deal with the experimental proofs in this matter.\r\n\r\nThere are three larger groups of facts, on which the assumption of\r\nlatent characters in ordinary varieties rests. These are true atavism,\r\nincomplete loss of characters, and systematic affinity. Before dealing\r\nwith each of these separately, it may be as well to recall once more\r\nthat in former lectures we have treated the apparent losses only as\r\nmodifications in a negative way, without contemplating the underlying\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nLet us recall the cases of bud-atavism given by the whitish variety of\r\nthe scarlet _Ribes_, by peaches and nectarines, and by conifers,\r\nincluding _Cephalotaxus_ and _Cryptomeria_. These and many other\r\nanalogous facts go to prove the relation of the variety to the species.\r\nTwo assumptions are allowable. In one the variety differs from the\r\nspecies by the total loss of the [227] distinctive character. In the\r\nother this character is simply reduced to an inactive or dormant state.\r\nThe fact of its recurrence from time to time, accompanied by secondary\r\ncharacters previously exhibited, is a manifest proof of the existence of\r\nsome relation between the lost and the resumed peculiarity. Evidently\r\nthis relation cannot be accounted for on the assumption of an absolute\r\ndisappearance; something must remain from which the old features may be\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThis lengthy discussion may be closed by the citation of the cases, in\r\nwhich plants not only show developmental features of a former state, but\r\nalso reproduce the special features they formerly had, but seemingly\r\nhave lost. Two good illustrative examples may be given. One is afforded\r\nby the wheat-ear carnation, the other by the green dahlias, and both\r\nhave occurred of late in my own cultures.\r\n\r\nA very curious anomaly may from time to time be observed in large beds\r\nof carnations. It bears no flowers, but instead of them small green\r\nears, which recall the ears of wheat. Thence the name of \"Wheat-ear\"\r\ncarnation. On closer inspection it is easily seen how they originate.\r\nThe normal flowers of the carnations are preceded by a small group of\r\nbracts, [228] which are arranged in opposite pairs and therefore\r\nconstitute four rows.\r\n\r\nIn this variety the flower is suppressed and this loss is attended by a\r\ncorresponding increase of the number of the pairs of bracts. This\r\nmalformation results in square spikes or somewhat elongated heads\r\nconsisting only of the greenish bracts. As there are no flowers, the\r\nvariety is quite sterile, and as it is not regarded by horticulturists\r\nas an improvement on the ordinary bright carnations, it is seldom\r\nmultiplied by layering. Notwithstanding this, it appears from time to\r\ntime and has been seen in different countries and at different periods,\r\nand, what is of great importance for us, in different strains of\r\ncarnations. Though sterile, and obviously dying out as often as it\r\nsprings into existence, it is nearly two centuries old. It was described\r\nin the beginning of the 18th century by Volckamer, and afterwards by\r\nJaeger, De Candolle, Weber, Masters, Magnus and many other botanists. I\r\nhave had it twice, at different times and from different growers.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have been able to ascertain reversions of this curious\r\ncarnation to normal flowers have not yet been recorded. Such a\r\nmodification occurred last summer in my garden on a plant which had not\r\nbeen divided or layered, but on which the slender branches had [229]\r\nbeen left on the stem. Some of them remained true to the varietal type\r\nand bore only green spikes. Others reverted wholly or partially to the\r\nproduction of normal flowers. Some branches bore these only, others had\r\nspikes and flowers on neighboring twigs, and in still other instances\r\nlittle spikes had been modified in such manner that a more or less well\r\ndeveloped flower was preceded by some part of an ear.\r\n\r\nThe proof that this retrograde modification was due to the existence of\r\na character in the latent state was given by the color of the flowers.\r\nIf the reverted bud had only lost the power of producing spikes, they\r\nwould evidently simply have returned to the characteristics of the\r\nordinary species, and their color would have been a pale pink. Instead\r\nof this, all flowers displayed corollas of a deep brown. They obviously\r\nreverted to their special progenitor, the chance variety from which they\r\nhad sprung, and not to the common prototype of the species. Of course it\r\nwas not possible to ascertain from which variety the plant had really\r\noriginated, but the reproduction of any one clearly defined varietal\r\nmark is in itself proof enough of their origin, and of the latency of\r\nthe dark brown flower-color in this special case.\r\n\r\nA still better proof is afforded by a new type of green dahlia. The\r\nordinary green dahlia [230] has large tufts of green bracts instead of\r\nflowering heads, the scales of the receptacle having assumed the texture\r\nand venation of leaves, and being in some measure as fleshy. But the\r\ngreen heads retain the form of the ordinary flower-heads, and as they\r\nhave no real florets that may fade away, they remain unchanged on the\r\nplants, and increase in number through the whole summer. The new types\r\nof green dahlia however, with which I have now to deal, are\r\ndistinguished by the elongation of the axis of the head, which is\r\nthereby changed into a long leafy stalk, attaining a length of several\r\ninches. These stalks continue growing for a very long time, and for the\r\nmost part die without producing anything else than green fleshy scales.\r\n\r\nThis long-headed green dahlia originated at Haarlem some years ago, in\r\nthe nursery of Messrs. Zocher & Co. It was seen to arise twice, from\r\ndifferent varieties. Both of these were double-flowered, one a deep\r\ncarmine with white tips on the rays, the other of a pale orange tint,\r\nknown by the name of \"Surprise.\" As they did not bear any florets or\r\nseeds, they were quite sterile. The strain arising from the carmine\r\nvariety was kindly given to me by Messrs. Zocher & Co., and was\r\npropagated in my garden, while the other was kept in the nursery. In the\r\nearlier cultures both remained true to [231] their types, never\r\nproducing true florets. No mark of the original difference was to be\r\nseen between them. But last summer (1903) both reverted to their\r\nprototypes, bearing relatively large numbers of ordinary double\r\nflowerheads among the great mass of green stalks. Some intermediate\r\nforms also occurred consisting of green-scaled stalks ending in small\r\nheads with colored florets.\r\n\r\nThus far we have an ordinary case of reversion. But the important side\r\nof the phenomenon was, that each plant exactly \"recollected\" from which\r\nparent it had sprung. All of those in my garden reverted to the carmine\r\nflorets with white tips, and all of those in the nursery to the pale\r\norange color and the other characteristics of the \"Surprise\" variety.\r\n\r\nIt seems absolutely evident, that no simple loss can account for this\r\ndifference. Something of the character of the parent-varieties must have\r\nremained in the plant. And whatever conception we may formulate of these\r\nvestigial characters it is clear that the simplest and most obvious idea\r\nis their preservation in a dormant or latent state. Assuming that the\r\ndistinguishing marks have only become inactive by virescence, it is\r\nmanifest that on returning each will show its own peculiarities, as\r\nrecorded above. Our second point was the incomplete loss of [232] the\r\ndistinguishing quality in some varieties. It is of general occurrence,\r\nthough often overlooked. Many white varieties of colored flowers give\r\nstriking instances, among them many of the most stable and most prized\r\ngarden-flowers. If you look at them separately or in little bouquets\r\nthey seem to be of irreproachable purity. But if you examine large beds\r\na pale hue will become visible. In many cases this tinge is so slight as\r\nto be only noticeable in a certain illumination, or by looking in an\r\noblique direction across the bed; in others it is at once evident as\r\nsoon as it has been pointed out. It always reminds the observer of the\r\ncolor of the species to which the variety belongs, being bluish in\r\nviolets and harebells, reddish in godetias and phloxes, in _Silene\r\nArmeria_ and many others. It proves that the original color quality of\r\nthe species has not wholly, but only partly disappeared. It is dormant,\r\nbut not entirely obliterated; latent, but not totally concealed;\r\ninactive, but only partially so. Our terminology is an awkward one; it\r\npractically assumes, as it so often does in other cases, a conventional\r\nunderstanding, not exactly corresponding to the simple meaning of the\r\nwords. But it would be cumbrous to speak always of partial inactivity,\r\nincomplete latency or half awakening qualities. Even such words as\r\nsub-latent, [233] which would about express the real state of things,\r\nwould have little chance of coming into general use.\r\n\r\nSuch sub-latent colors are often seen on special parts in white\r\nvarieties of flowers. In many cases it is the outer side of the petals\r\nwhich recalls the specific color, as in some white roses. In violets it\r\nis often on the spur that the remains of the original pigment are to be\r\nseen. In many instances it is on the tips of the petals or of the\r\nsegments of the corolla, and a large number of white or yellow flowers\r\nbetray their affinity to colored species by becoming red or bluish at\r\nthe edges or on the outer side.\r\n\r\nThe reality of such very slight hues, and their relation to the original\r\npigment of the species may in some cases be proved by direct experiment.\r\nIf it is granted that latency is not an absolute quality, then it will\r\nbe readily accepted, that even latency must be subjected to the laws of\r\ngradual variation or fluctuating variability. We will deal with these\r\nlaws in a later lecture but every one knows that greater deviations than\r\nthe ordinary may be attained by sowing very large numbers and by\r\nselecting from among them the extreme individuals and sowing anew from\r\ntheir seed. In this way the slightest tinge of any latent color may be\r\n[234] strengthened, not indeed to the restoration of the tinge of the\r\nspecies, but at least so far as to leave no doubt as to the identity of\r\nthe visible color of the species and the latent or sublatent one of the\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nI made such an experiment with the peach leaved harebell or _Campanula\r\npersicifolia_. The white variety of this species, which is often met\r\nwith in our gardens, shows a very pale bluish hue when cultivated in\r\nlarge quantities, which however is subject to individual variations. I\r\nselected some plants with a decided tinge, flowered them separately,\r\nsowed their seeds, and repeated this during two generations. The result\r\nwas an increase of the color on the tips of the segments of the corolla\r\nin a few individuals, most of them remaining as purely white as the\r\noriginal strain. But in those few plants the color was very manifest,\r\nindividually variable in degree, but always of the same blue as in the\r\nspecies itself.\r\n\r\nMany other instances could be given. Smooth varieties are seldom\r\nabsolutely so, and if scattering hairs are found on the leaves or only\r\non some more or less concealed parts, they correspond in their character\r\nto those of the species. So it is with prickles, and even the thornless\r\nthorn-apple has fruits with surfaces far from smooth. The thornless\r\nhorse-chestnut [235] has in some instances such evident protuberances on\r\nthe valves of its fruits, that it may seem doubtful whether it is a pure\r\nand stable variety.\r\n\r\nSystematic latency may betray itself in different ways, either by normal\r\nsystematic marks, or by atavism. With the latter I shall deal at length\r\non another occasion, and therefore I will give here only one very clear\r\nand beautiful example. It is afforded by the common red clover.\r\nObviously the clovers, with their three leaflets in each leaf, stand in\r\nthe midst of the great family of papilionaceous plants, the leaves of\r\nwhich are generally pinnate. Systematic affinity suggests that the\r\n\"three leaved\" forms must have been derived from pinnate ancestors,\r\nevidently by the reduction of the number of the leaflets. In some\r\nspecies of clover the middle of the three is more or less stalked, as is\r\nordinarily the case in pinnate leaves; in others it is as sessile as are\r\nits neighbors. In a subsequent chapter I will describe a very fine\r\nvariety, which sometimes occurs in the wild state and may easily be\r\nisolated and cultivated. It is an ordinary red clover with five leaflets\r\ninstead of three, and with this number varying between three and seven,\r\ninstead of being nearly wholly stable as in the common form. It produces\r\nfrom time to time pinnate leaves, [236] very few indeed, and only\r\nrarely, but then often two or three or even more on the same individual.\r\nIntermediate stages are not wanting, but are of no consequence here. The\r\npinnate leaves obviously constitute a reversion to some prototype, to\r\nsome ancestor with ordinary papilionaceous leaves. They give proof of\r\nthe presence of the common character of the family, concealed here in a\r\nlatent state. Any other explanation of this curious anomaly would\r\nevidently be artificial. On the other hand nothing is really known about\r\nthe ancestors of clover, and the whole conception rests only on the\r\nprevailing views of the systematic relationships in this family. But, as\r\nI have already said, further proof must be left for a subsequent\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMany instances, noted in our former lectures, could be quoted here. The\r\nsystematic distribution of rayed and rayless species and varieties among\r\nthe daisy-group of the composites affords a long series of examples.\r\nAccidental variations in both directions occur. The Canada fleabane or\r\n_Erigeron canadensis_, the tansy or _Tanacetum vulgare_ and some others\r\nmay at times be seen with ray-florets, and according to Murr, they may\r\nsometimes be wanting in _Aster Tripolium_, _Bellis perennis_, some\r\nspecies of _Anthemis_, _Arnica montana_ and in a number [237] of other\r\nwell-known rayed species. Another instance may be quoted; it has been\r\npointed out by Grant Allen, and refers to the dead-nettle or Lamium\r\nalbum. Systematically placed in a genus with red-flowering species, we\r\nmay regard its white color as due to the latency of the general red\r\npigment.\r\n\r\nBut if the flower of this plant is carefully examined, it will be found\r\nin most cases not to be purely white, but to have some dusky lines and\r\nmarkings on its lower lip. Similar devices are observed on the lip of\r\nthe allied _Lamium maculatum_, and in a less degree on the somewhat\r\ndistant _Lamium purpureum_. With _Lamium maculatum_ or spotted\r\ndead-nettle, the affinity is so close that even Bentham united the two\r\nin a single species, considering the ordinary dead-nettle only as a\r\nvariety of the dappled purple type. For the support of this conception\r\nof a specific or varietal retrograde change many other facts are\r\nafforded by the distribution of the characteristic color and of the\r\nseveral patterns of the lips of other labiates, and our general\r\nunderstanding of the relationships of the species and genera in this\r\nfamily may in a broad sense be based on the comparison of these\r\nseemingly subordinate characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good in many other cases, and systematists have often\r\nbecome uncertain [238] as to the true value of some form, by its\r\nrelationship to the allied types in the way of retrogressive\r\nmodification. Color-differences are so showy, that they easily\r\novershadow other characters. The white and the blue thorn-apple, the\r\nwhite and the red campion (_Lychnis vespertina_ and _diurna_) and many\r\nother illustrative cases could be given, in which two forms are\r\nspecifically separated by some authors, but combined by others on the\r\nground of the retrograde nature of some differentiating mark.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have dealt with negative characters and tried to prove that\r\nthe conception of latency of the opposite positive characteristics is a\r\nmore natural explanation of the phenomenon than the idea of a complete\r\nloss. We have now to consider the positive varieties, and to show that\r\nit is quite improbable that here the species have struck out for\r\nthemselves a wholly new character. In some instances such may have been\r\nthe case, but then I should prefer to treat these rather as elementary\r\nspecies. But in the main we will have to assume the latency of the\r\ncharacter in the species and its reassumption by the variety when\r\noriginating, as the most probable explanation.\r\n\r\nGreat stress is laid upon this conception by the fact, that positive\r\nvarieties are so excessively rare when compared with the common\r\noccurrence [239] of negative ones. Indeed, if we put aside the radiate\r\nand the color-varieties of flowers and foliage, hardly any cases can be\r\ncited. We have dealt with this question in a former lecture, and may now\r\nlimit ourselves to the positive color-varieties.\r\n\r\nThe latency of the faculty of producing the red pigment in leaves must\r\nobviously be accepted for nearly the whole vegetable kingdom. Oaks and\r\nelms, the beautiful climbing species of Ampelopsis, many conifers, as\r\nfor instance _Cryptomeria japonica_, some brambles, the Guelder-rose\r\n(_Viburnum Opulus_) and many other trees and shrubs assume a more or\r\nless bright red color in the fall. During summer this tendency must have\r\nbeen dormant, and that this is so, is shown by the young leaves of oaks\r\nand others, which, when unfolding in the spring show a similar but paler\r\nhue. Moreover, there is a way of awakening the concealed powers at any\r\ntime. We have only to inflict small wounds on the leaves, or to cut\r\nthrough the nerves or to injure them by a slight bruising, and the\r\nleaves frequently respond with an intense reddening of the living\r\ntissues around and especially above the wounds. _Azolla caroliniana_, a\r\nminute mosslike floating plant allied to the ferns, responds to light\r\nand cold with a reddish tinge, and to shade or warmth with a pure green.\r\nThe foliage [240] of many other plants behaves likewise, as also do\r\napples and peaches on the insolated sides of the fruits. It is quite\r\nimpossible to state these groups of facts in a more simple way than by\r\nthe statement that the tendency to become red is almost generally\r\npresent, though latent in leaves and stems, and that it comes into\r\nactivity whenever a stimulus provokes it.\r\n\r\nNow it must be granted that the energizing of such a propensity under\r\nordinary circumstances is quite another thing from the origination of a\r\npositive variety by the evolution of the same character. In the variety\r\nthe activity has become independent of outer influences or dependent\r\nupon them in a far lesser degree. The power of producing the red\r\npigments is shown to be latent by the facts given above, and we see that\r\nin the variety it is no longer latent but is in perfect and lasting\r\nactivity throughout the whole life of the plant.\r\n\r\nRed varieties of white flowers are much more rare. Here the latency of\r\nthe red pigment may be deduced partly from general arguments like those\r\njust given, partly from the special systematic relations in the given\r\ncases. Hildebrand has clearly worked out this mode of proof. He showed\r\nby the critical examination of a large number of instances that the\r\noccurrence of the red-flowered varieties is contingent upon the [241]\r\nexistence of red species in the same genus, or in some rare cases, in\r\nnearly allied genera. Colors that are not systematically present in the\r\ngroup to which a white species belongs are only produced in its\r\nvarieties in extremely rare cases.\r\n\r\nWe may quote some special rules, indicated by Hildebrand. Blue species\r\nare n the main very rare, and so are blue varieties of white species\r\nalso. Carnations, Asiatic or cultivated buttercups (_Ranunculus\r\nasiaticus_), _Mirabilis_, poppies, _Gladiolus_, _Dahlia_, and some other\r\nhighly cultivated or very old garden-plants have not been able to\r\nproduce true blue flowers. But the garden-anemone (_Anemone coronaria_)\r\nhas allies with very fine blue flowers. The common stock has bluish\r\nvarieties and is allied to _Aubretia_ and _Hesperis_, and gooseberries\r\nhave a red form, recalling the ordinary currant. In nearly all other\r\ninstances of blue or red varieties every botanist will be able to point\r\nout some allied red or blue species, as an indication of the probable\r\nsource of the varietal character.\r\n\r\nDark spots on the lower parts of the petals of some plants afford\r\nanother instance, as in poppies and in the allied _Glaucium_, where they\r\nsometimes occur as varietal and in other cases as specific marks.\r\n\r\nThe yellow fails in many highly developed [242] flowers, which are not\r\nliable to produce yellow variations, as in _Salvia_, _Aster_,\r\n_Centaurea_, _Vinca_, _Polygala_ and many others. Even the rare pale\r\nyellowish species of some of these genera have no tendency in this\r\ndirection. The hyacinths are the most remarkable, if not the sole known\r\ninstance of a species having red and blue and white and yellow\r\nvarieties, but here the yellow is not the bright golden color of the\r\nbuttercups.\r\n\r\nThe existence of varietal colors in allied species obviously points to a\r\ncommon cause, and this cause can be no other than the latency of the\r\npigment in the species that do not show it.\r\n\r\nThe conception of latency of characters as the common source of the\r\norigination of varieties, either in the positive or in the negative way,\r\nleads to some rules on variability, which are known under the names\r\ngiven to them by Darwin. They are the rules of repeated, homologous,\r\nparallel and analogous variability. Each of them is quite general, and\r\nmay be recognized in instances from the most widely distant families.\r\nEach of them is quite evident and easily understood on the principle of\r\nlatency.\r\n\r\nBy the term of repeated variability is meant the well-known phenomenon,\r\nthat the same variety has sprung at different times and in different\r\n[243] countries from the same species. The repetition obviously\r\nindicates a common internal cause. The white varieties of blue- and\r\nred-flowered plants occur in the wild state so often, and in most of the\r\ninstances in so few individuals that a common pedigree is absolutely\r\nimprobable. In horticulture this tendency is widely and vexatiously\r\nknown, since the repetition of an old variety does not bring any\r\nadvantage to the breeder. The old name of \"conquests,\" given by the\r\nbreeders of hyacinths, tulips and other flower-bulbs to any novelty, in\r\ndisregard of the common occurrence of repetitions, is an indication of\r\nthe same experience in the repeated appearance of certain varieties.\r\n\r\nThe rule of parallel variations demands that the same character\r\noccasionally makes its appearance in the several varieties or races,\r\ndescended from the same species, and even in widely distinct species.\r\nThis is a rule, which is very important for the general conception of\r\nthe meaning of the term variety as contrasted with elementary species.\r\nFor the recurrence of the same deviation always impresses us as a\r\nvarietal mark. Laciniated leaves are perhaps the most beautiful\r\ninstance, since they occur in so many trees and shrubs, as the walnut\r\ntree, the beech, the birch, the hazelnut, and even in [244] brambles and\r\nsome garden-varieties of the turnip (_Brassica_).\r\n\r\nIn such cases of parallel variations the single instances obviously\r\nfollow the same rules and are therefore to be designated as analogous.\r\nPitchers or ascidia, formed by the union of the margins of a leaf, are\r\nperhaps the best proof. They were classified by Morren under two heads,\r\naccording to their formation from one or more leaves. Monophyllous\r\npitchers obey the same law, viz.: that the upper side of the leaf has\r\nbecome the inner side of the pitcher. Only one exception to this rule is\r\nknown to me. It is afforded by the pitchers of the banyan or holy\r\nfig-tree, _Ficus religiosus_, but it does not seem to belong to the same\r\nclass as other pitchers, since as far as it has been possible to\r\nascertain the facts, these pitchers are not formed by a few leaves as in\r\nall other cases, but by all the leaves of the tree.\r\n\r\nIn some cases pitchers are only built up of part of the leaf-blade. Such\r\npartial malformations obey a rule, that is common to them and to other\r\nfoliar enations, viz.: that the side of the leaf from which they emerge,\r\nis always their outer side. The inner surface of these enations\r\ncorresponds to the opposite side of the leaf, both in color and in\r\nanatomical structure. The last of the four rules above mentioned is\r\n[245] that of the homologous variability. It asserts that the same\r\ndeviation may occur in different, but homologous parts of the same\r\nplant. We have already dealt with some instances, as the occurrence of\r\nthe same pigment in the flowers and foliage, in the fruits and seeds of\r\nthe same plant, as also illustrated by the loss of the red or blue tinge\r\nby flowers and berries. Other instances are afforded by the curious fact\r\nthat the division of the leaves into numerous and small segments is\r\nrepeated by the petals, as in the common celandine and some sorts of\r\nbrambles.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to make a closer examination of the numerous\r\ncases which afford proof of these statements. Suffice it to say that\r\neverywhere the results of close inspection point to the general rule,\r\nthat the failure of definite qualities both in species and in varieties\r\nmust, in a great number of cases, be considered as only apparent. Hidden\r\nfrom view, occasionally reappearing, or only imperfectly concealed, the\r\nsame character must be assumed to be present though latent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of negative or retrogressive varieties it is the transition\r\nfrom the active into a dormant state to which is due the origin of the\r\nvariety. Positive varieties on the contrary owe their origin to the\r\npresence of some character [246] in the species in the latent state, and\r\nto the occasional re-energizing thereof.\r\n\r\nSpecific or varietal latency is not the same thing as the ordinary\r\nlatency of characters that only await their period of activity, or the\r\nexternal influence which will awake them. They are permanently latent,\r\nand could well be designated by the word perlatent. They spring into\r\nactivity only by some sudden leap, and then at once become independent\r\nof ordinary external stimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[247]\r\n\r\nLECTURE IX\r\n\r\nCROSSES OF SPECIES AND VARIETIES\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing lectures I have tried to show that there is a real\r\ndifference between elementary species and varieties. The first are of\r\nequal rank, and together constitute the collective or systematic\r\nspecies. The latter are usually derived from real and still existing\r\ntypes. Elementary species are in a sense independent of each other,\r\nwhile varieties are of a derivative nature.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I have tried to show that the ways in which elementary or\r\nminor species must have originated from their common ancestor must be\r\nquite different from the mode of origin of the varieties. We have\r\nassumed that the first come into existence by the production of\r\nsomething new, by the acquirement of a character hitherto unnoticed in\r\nthe line of their ancestors. On the contrary, varieties, in most cases,\r\nevidently owe their origin to the loss of an already existing character,\r\nor in other less frequent cases, to the re-assumption of a quality [248]\r\nformerly lost. Some may originate in a negative, others in a positive\r\nmanner, but in both cases nothing really new is acquired.\r\n\r\nThis distinction holds good for all cases in which the relationship\r\nbetween the forms in question is well known. It seems entirely\r\njustifiable therefore to apply it also to cases in which the systematic\r\naffinity is doubtful, as well as to instances in which it is impossible\r\nto arrive at any taxonomic conclusions. The extreme application of the\r\nprinciple would no doubt disturb the limits between many species and\r\nvarieties as now recognized. It is not to be forgotten however that all\r\ntaxonomic distinctions, which have not been confirmed by physiologic\r\ntests are only provisional, a view acknowledged by the best\r\nsystematists. Of course the description of newly discovered forms can\r\nnot await the results of physiologic inquiries; but it is absolutely\r\nimpossible to reach definite conclusions on purely morphologic evidence.\r\nThis is well illustrated by the numerous discords of opinion of\r\ndifferent authors on the systematic worth of many forms.\r\n\r\nAssuming the above mentioned principle as established, and disregarding\r\ndoubtful cases as indicated, the term progressive evolution is used to\r\ndesignate the method in which elementary species must have originated.\r\nIt is the [249] manner in which all advance in the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms must have taken place, continuously adding new characters to\r\nthe already existing number. Contrasted with this method of growing\r\ndifferentiation, are the retrogressive modifications, which simply\r\nretrace a step, and the degressive changes in which a backward step is\r\nretraced and old characters revived. No doubt both of these methods have\r\nbeen operative on a large scale, but they are evidently not in the line\r\nof general advancement.\r\n\r\nIn all of these directions we see that the differentiating marks show\r\nmore or less clearly that they are built up of units. Allied forms are\r\nseparated from each other without intermediates. Transitions are wholly\r\nwanting, although fallaciously apparent in some instances owing to the\r\nwide range of fluctuating variability of the forms concerned, or to the\r\noccurrence of hybrids and subvarieties.\r\n\r\nThese physiologic units, which in the end must be the basis for the\r\ndistinction of the systematic units, may best be designated by the term\r\nof \"unit-characters.\" Their internal nature is as yet unknown to us, and\r\nwe will not now look into the theories, which have been propounded as to\r\nthe probable material basis underlying them. For our present purpose the\r\nempirical evidence of the general occurrence of [250] sharp limits\r\nbetween nearly related characters must suffice. As Bateson has put it,\r\nspecies are discontinuous, and we must assume that their characters are\r\ndiscontinuous also.\r\n\r\nMoreover there is as yet no reason for trying to make a complete\r\nanalysis of all the characters of a plant. No doubt, if attained, such\r\nan analysis would give us a deep insight into the real internal\r\nconstruction of the intricate properties of organisms in general. But\r\ntaxonomic studies in this direction are only in their infancy and do not\r\ngive us the material required for such an analysis. Quite on the\r\ncontrary, they compel us to confine our study to the most recently\r\nacquired, or youngest characters, which constitute the differentiating\r\nmarks between nearly allied forms.\r\n\r\nObviously this is especially the case in the realm of the hybrids, since\r\nonly nearly related forms are able to give hybrid offspring. In dealing\r\nwith this subject we must leave aside all questions concerning more\r\nremote relationships.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to treat of the doctrine of hybridization at any\r\nlength. Experience is so rapidly increasing both in a practical and in a\r\npurely scientific direction that it would take an entire volume to give\r\nonly a brief survey of the facts and of all the proposed theories.\r\n\r\n[251] For our present purposes we are to deal with hybrids only in so\r\nfar as they afford the means of a still better distinction between\r\nelementary species and varieties. I will try to show that these two\r\ncontrasting groups behave in quite a different manner, when subjected to\r\ncrossing experiments, and that the hope is justified that some day\r\ncrosses may become the means of deciding in any given instance, what is\r\nto be called a species, and what a variety, on physiologic grounds. It\r\nis readily granted that the labor required for such experiments, is\r\nperhaps too great for the results to be attained, but then it may be\r\npossible to deduce rules from a small series of experiments, which may\r\nlead us to a decision in wider ranges of cases.\r\n\r\nTo reach such a point of view it is necessary to compare the evidence\r\ngiven by hybrids, with the conclusions already attained by the\r\ncomparison of the differentiating characteristics of allied forms.\r\n\r\nOn this ground we first have to inquire what may be expected respecting\r\nthe internal nature and the outcome of the process of crossing in the\r\nvarious cases cited in our former discussion.\r\n\r\nWe must always distinguish the qualities, which are the same in both\r\nparents, from those that constitute the differentiating marks in every\r\nsingle cross. In respect to the first [252] group the cross is not at\r\nall distinguished from a normal fertilization, and ordinarily these\r\ncharacters are simply left out of consideration. But it should never be\r\nforgotten that they constitute the enormous majority, amounting to\r\nhundreds and thousands, whereas the differentiating marks in each case\r\nare only one or two or a few at most. The whole discussion is to be\r\nlimited to these last-named exceptions. We must consider first what\r\nwould be the nature of a cross when species are symmetrically combined,\r\nand what must be the case when varieties are subjected to the same\r\ntreatment. In so doing, I intend to limit the discussion to the most\r\ntypical cases. We may take the crosses between elementary species of the\r\nsame or of very narrowly allied systematic species on the one side, and\r\non the other, limit treatment to the crossing of varieties with the\r\nspecies, from which they are supposed to have sprung by a retrograde\r\nmodification. Crosses of different varieties of the same species with\r\none another obviously constitute a derivative case, and should only be\r\ndiscussed secondarily. And crosses of varieties with positive or\r\ndepressive characters have as yet so rarely been made that we may well\r\ndisregard them.\r\n\r\nElementary species differ from their nearest allies by progressive\r\nchanges, that is by the acquirement [253] of some new character. The\r\nderivative species has one unit more than the parent. All other\r\nqualities are the same as in the parent. Whenever such a derivative is\r\ncombined with its parent the result for these qualities will be exactly\r\nas in a normal fertilization. In such ordinary cases it is obvious that\r\neach character of the pollen-parent is combined with the same character\r\nof the pistil-parent. There may be slight individual differences, but\r\neach unit character will become opposed to, and united with, the same\r\nunit-character in the other parent. In the offspring the units will thus\r\nbe paired, each pair consisting of two equivalent units. As to their\r\ncharacter the units of each single pair are the same, only they may\r\nexhibit slight differences as to the degree of development of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNow we may apply this conception to the sexual combination of two\r\ndifferent elementary species, assuming one to be the derivative of the\r\nother. The differentiating mark is only present in one of the parents\r\nand wanting in the other. While all other units are paired in the\r\nhybrid, this one is not. It meets with no mate, and must therefore\r\nremain unpaired. The hybrid of two such elementary species is in some\r\nway incomplete and unnatural. In the ordinary course of things all\r\nindividuals derive [254] their qualities from both parents; for each\r\nsingle mark they possess at least two units. Practically but not\r\nabsolutely equal, these two opponents always work together and give to\r\nthe offspring a likeness to both parents. No unpaired qualities occur in\r\nnormal offspring; these constitute the essential features of the hybrids\r\nof species and are at the same time the cause of their wide deviations\r\nfrom the ordinary rules.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the varieties, we likewise need discuss their\r\ndifferentiating marks only. In the negative types, these consist of the\r\napparent loss of some quality which was active in the species. But it\r\nwas pointed out in our last lecture that such a change is an apparent\r\nloss. On a closer inquiry we are led to the assumption of a latent or\r\ndormant state. The presumably lost characters have not absolutely, or at\r\nleast not permanently disappeared. They show their presence by some\r\nslight indication of the quality they represent, or by occasional\r\nreversions. They are not wanting, but only latent.\r\n\r\nBasing our discussion concerning the process of crossing on this\r\nconception, and still limiting the discussion to one differentiating\r\nmark, we come to the inference, that this mark is present and active in\r\nthe species, and present but dormant in the variety. Thus it is present\r\nin both, and as all other characters not differentiating [255] find\r\ntheir mates in the cross, so these two will also meet one another. They\r\nwill unite just as well as though they were both active or both dormant.\r\nFor essentially they are the same, only differing in their degree of\r\nactivity. From this we can infer, that in the crossing of varieties, no\r\nunpaired remainder is left, all units combining in pairs exactly as in\r\nordinary fertilization.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the contrast between activity and latency in this single\r\npair, the procedure in the inter-crossing of varieties is the same as in\r\nordinary normal fertilization.\r\n\r\nSummarizing this discussion we may conclude that in normal fertilization\r\nand in the inter-crossing of varieties all characters are paired, while\r\nin crosses between elementary species the differentiating marks are not\r\nmated.\r\n\r\nIn order to distinguish these two great types of fertilization we will\r\nuse the term bisexual for the one and unisexual for the other. The term\r\nbalanced crosses then conveys the idea of complete bisexuality, all\r\nunit-characters combining in pairs. Unbalanced crosses are those in\r\nwhich one or more units do not find their mates and therefore remain\r\nunpaired. This distinction was proposed by Macfarlane when studying the\r\nminute structure of plant-hybrids in comparison with that of their\r\nparents (1892).\r\n\r\n[256] In the first place it shows that a species hybrid may inherit the\r\ndistinguishing marks of both parents. In this way it may become\r\nintermediate between them, having some characters in common with the\r\npollen-parent and others with the pistil-parent. As far as these\r\ncharacters do not interfere with each other, they may be fully developed\r\nside by side, and in the main this is the way in which hybrid characters\r\nare evolved. But in most cases our existing knowledge of the units is\r\nfar too slender to give a complete analysis, even of these\r\ndistinguishing marks alone. We recognize the parental marks more or less\r\nclearly, but are not prepared for exact delimitations. Leaving these\r\ntheoretical considerations, we will pass to the description of some\r\nillustrative examples.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I will describe a hybrid between two species of\r\n_Oenothera_, which I made some years ago. The parents were the common\r\nevening-primrose or _Oenothera biennis_ and of its small-flowered\r\ncongener, _Oenothera muricata_. These two forms were distinguished by\r\nLinnaeus as different species, but have been considered by subsequent\r\nwriters as elementary species or so-called systematic varieties of one\r\nspecies designated with the name of the presumably older type, the _O.\r\nbiennis_. Varietal differences in a physiologic sense they [257] do not\r\npossess, and for this reason afford a pure instance of unbalanced union,\r\nthough differing in more than one point.\r\n\r\nI have made reciprocal crosses, taking at one time the small-flowered\r\nand at the other the common species as pistillate parent. These crosses\r\ndo not lead to the same hybrid as is ordinarily observed in analogous\r\ncases; quite on the contrary, the two types are different in most\r\nfeatures, both resembling the pollen-parent far more than the\r\npistil-parent. The same curious result was reached in sundry other\r\nreciprocal crosses between species of this genus. But I will limit\r\nmyself here to one of the two hybrids.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1895 I castrated some flowers of _O. muricata_, and\r\npollinated them with _O. biennis_, surrounding the flowers with paper\r\nbags so as to exclude the visits of insects. I sowed the seeds in 1896\r\nand the hybrids were biennial and flowered abundantly the next year and\r\nwere artificially fertilized with their own pollen, but gave only a very\r\nsmall harvest. Many capsules failed, and the remaining contained only\r\nsome few ripe seeds.\r\n\r\nFrom these I had in the following year the second hybrid generation, and\r\nin the same way I cultivated also the third and fourth. These were as\r\nimperfectly fertile as the first, and in [258] some years did not give\r\nany seed at all, so that the operation had to be repeated in order to\r\ncontinue the experiment. Last summer (1903) I had a nice lot of some 25\r\nbiennial specimens blooming abundantly. All in all I have grown some 500\r\nhybrids, and of these about 150 specimens flowered.\r\n\r\nThese plants were all of the same type, resembling in most points the\r\npollen-parent, and in some others the pistil-parent of the original\r\ncross. The most obvious characteristic marks are afforded by the\r\nflowers, which in _O. muricata_ are not half so large as in _biennis_,\r\nthough borne by a calyx-tube of the same length. In this respect the\r\nhybrid is like the _biennis_ bearing the larger flowers. These may at\r\ntimes seem to deviate a little in the direction of the other parent,\r\nbeing somewhat smaller and of a slightly paler color. But it is very\r\ndifficult to distinguish between them, and if _biennis_ and hybrid\r\nflowers were separated from the plants and thrown together, it is very\r\ndoubtful whether one would succeed in separating them.\r\n\r\nThe next point is offered by the foliage. The leaves of _O. biennis_ are\r\nbroad, those of _O. muricata_ narrow. The hybrid has the broad leaves of\r\n_O. biennis_ during most of its life and at the time of flowering. Yet\r\nsmall deviations in the [259] direction of the other parent are not\r\nwanting, and in winter the leaves of the hybrid rosettes are often much\r\nnarrower than those of _O. biennis_, and easily distinguishable from\r\nboth parents. A third distinction consists in the density of the spike.\r\nThe distance between the insertion of the flowers of _O. biennis_ is\r\ngreat when compared with that of _O. muricata_. Hence the flowers of the\r\nlatter species are more crowded and those of _O. biennis_ more\r\ndispersed, the spikes of the first being densely crowned with flowers\r\nand flower-buds while those of _O. biennis_ are more elongated and\r\nslender. As a further consequence the _O. biennis_ opens on the same\r\nevening only one, two or three flowers on the same spike, whereas _O.\r\nmuricata_ bears often eight or ten or more flowers at a time. In this\r\nrespect the hybrid is similar to the pistil-parent, and the crowding of\r\nthe broad flowers at the top of the spikes causes the hybrids to be much\r\nmore showy than either of the parent types.\r\n\r\nOther distinguishing marks are not recorded by the systematists, or are\r\nnot so sharply separated as to allow of the corresponding qualities of\r\nthe hybrids being compared with them.\r\n\r\nThis hybrid remains true to the description given. In some years I\r\ncultivated two generations [260] so as to be able to compare them with\r\none another, but did not find any difference. The most interesting point\r\nhowever, is the likeness between the first generation, which obviously\r\nmust combine in its internal structure the units of both parents, and\r\nthe second and later generations which are only of a derivative nature.\r\nNext to this stands the fact that in each generation all individuals are\r\nalike. No reversion to the parental forms either in the whole type or in\r\nthe single characteristics has ever been observed, though the leaves of\r\nsome hundreds, and the spikes and flowers of some 150 individual plants\r\nhave been carefully examined. No segregation or splitting up takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHere we have a clear, undoubted and relatively simple, case of a true\r\nand pure species hybrid. No occurrence of possible varietal\r\ncharacteristics obscures the result, and in this respect this hybrid\r\nstands out much more clearly than all those between garden-plants, where\r\nvarietal marks nearly always play a most important part.\r\n\r\nFrom the breeder's point of view our hybrid _Oenothera_ would be a\r\ndistinct gain, were it not for the difficulty of its propagation. But to\r\nenlarge the range of the varieties this simple and stable form would\r\nneed to be treated anew, by [261] crossing it with the parent-types.\r\nSuch experiments however, have miscarried owing to the too stable nature\r\nof the unit-characters.\r\n\r\nThis stability and this absence of the splitting shown by varietal marks\r\nin the offspring of hybrids is one of the best proofs of unisexual\r\nunions. It is often obscured by the accompanying varietal marks, or\r\noverlooked for this reason. Only in rare cases it is to be met with in a\r\npure state and some examples are given of this below.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, I must call your attention to another feature of the\r\nunbalanced unions. This is the diminution of the fertility, a phenomenon\r\nuniversally known as occurring in hybridizations. It has two phases.\r\nFirst, the diminished chance of the crosses themselves of giving full\r\ncrops of seed, as compared with the pure fertilization of either parent.\r\nAnd, secondly, the fertility of the hybrids themselves. Seemingly, all\r\ngrades of diminished fertility occur and the oldest authors on hybrids\r\nhave pointed out that a very definite relation exists between the\r\ndifferences of the parents and the degree of sterility, both of the\r\ncross and of the hybrid offspring. In a broad sense these two factors\r\nare proportionate to each other, the sterility being the greater, the\r\nlesser the affinity between the parents. Many writers have [262] tried\r\nto trace this rule in the single cases, but have met with nearly\r\nunsurmountable difficulties, owing chiefly to our ignorance of the units\r\nwhich form the differences between the parents in the observed cases.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Oenothera muricata x biennis_ the differentiating units\r\nreduce the fertility to a low degree, threatening the offspring with\r\nalmost complete infertility and extinction. But then we do not know\r\nwhether these characters are really units, or perhaps only seemingly so\r\nand are in reality composed of smaller entities which as yet we are not\r\nable to segregate. And as long as we are devoid of empirical means of\r\ndeciding such questions, it seems useless to go farther into the details\r\nof the question of the sterility. It should be stated here however, that\r\npure varietal crosses, when not accompanied by unbalanced characters,\r\nhave never showed any tendency to diminished fertility. Hence there can\r\nbe little doubt that the unpaired units are the cause of this decrease\r\nin reproductive power.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Oenothera_ is to a large degree devoid of varietal\r\ncharacteristics, especially in the subgenus _Onagra_, to which\r\n_biennis_, _muricata_, _lamarckiana_ and some others belong. On the\r\nother hand it seems to be rich in elementary species, but an adequate\r\nstudy of [263] them has as yet not been made. Unfortunately many of the\r\nbetter systematists are in the habit of throwing all these interesting\r\nforms together, and of omitting their descriptive study. I have made a\r\nlarge number of crosses between such undescribed types and as a rule got\r\nconstant hybrid races. Only one or two exceptions could be quoted, as\r\nfor instance the _Oenothera brevistylis_, which in its crosses always\r\nbehaves as a pure retrogressive variety. Instead of giving an exhaustive\r\nsurvey of hybrids, I simply cite my crosses between _lamarckiana_ and\r\n_biennis_, as having nearly the aspect of the last named species, and\r\nremaining true to this in the second generation without any sign of\r\nreversion or of splitting. I have crossed another elementary species,\r\nthe _Oenothera hirtella_ with some of my new and with some older Linnean\r\nspecies, and got several constant hybrid races. Among these the\r\noffspring of a cross between _muricata_ and _hirtella_ is still in\r\ncultivation. The cross was made in the summer of 1897 and last year\r\n(1903) I grew the fourth generation of the hybrids. These had the\r\ncharacters of the _muricata_ in their narrow leaves, but the elongated\r\nspikes and relatively large flowers of the _hirtella_ parent, and\r\nremained true to this type, showing only slight fluctuations and never\r\nreverting or segregating [264] the mixed characters. Both parents bear\r\nlarge capsules with an abundance of seed, but in the hybrids the\r\ncapsules remain narrow and weak, ripening not more than one-tenth the\r\nusual quantity of seed. Both parents are easily cultivated in annual\r\ngenerations and the same holds good for the hybrid. But whereas the\r\nhybrid of muricata and biennis is a stout plant, this type is weak with\r\nbadly developed foliage, and very long strict spikes. Perhaps it was not\r\nable to withstand the bad weather of the last few years.\r\n\r\nA goodly number of constant hybrids are described in literature, or\r\ncultivated in fields and gardens. In such cases the essential question\r\nis not whether they are now constant, but whether they have been so from\r\nthe beginning, or whether they prove to be constant whenever the\r\noriginal cross is repeated. For constant hybrids may also be the issue\r\nof incipient splittings, as we shall soon see.\r\n\r\nAmong other examples we may begin with the hybrid alfalfa or hybrid\r\nlucerne (_Medicago media_). It often originates spontaneously between\r\nthe common purple lucerne or alfalfa and its wild ally with yellow\r\nflowers and procumbent stems, the _Medicago falcata_. This hybrid is\r\ncultivated in some parts of Germany on a large scale, as it is more\r\nproductive than [265] the ordinary lucerne. It always comes true from\r\nseed and may be seen in a wild state in parks and on lawns. It is one of\r\nthe oldest hybrids with a pure and known lineage. The original cross has\r\nbeen repeated by Urban, who found the hybrid race to be constant from\r\nthe beginning.\r\n\r\nAnother very notorious constant hybrid race is the _Aegilops\r\nspeltaeformis_. It has been cultivated in botanic gardens for more than\r\nhalf a century, mostly in annual or biennial generations. It is\r\nsufficiently fertile and always comes true. Numerous records have been\r\nmade of it, since formerly it was believed by Fabre and others to be a\r\nspontaneous transition from some wild species of grass to the ordinary\r\nwheat, not a cross. Godron, however, showed that it can be produced\r\nartificially, and how it has probably sprung into existence wherever it\r\nis found wild. The hybrid between _Aegilops ovata_, a small weed, and\r\nthe common wheat is of itself sterile, producing no good pollen. But it\r\nmay be fertilized by the pollen of wheat and then gives rise to a\r\nsecondary hybrid, which is no other than the _Aegilops speltaeformis_.\r\nThis remained constant in Godron's experiments during a number of\r\ngenerations, and has been constant up to the present time.\r\n\r\n[266] Constant hybrids have been raised by Millardet between several\r\nspecies of strawberries. He combined the old cultivated forms with newly\r\ndiscovered types from American localities. They ordinarily showed only\r\nthe characteristics of one of their parents and did not exhibit any new\r\ncombination of qualities, but they came true to this type in the second\r\nand later generations.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Anemone_, Janczewski obtained the same results. Some\r\ncharacters of course may split, but others remain constant, and when\r\nonly such are present, hybrid races result with new combinations of\r\ncharacters, which are as constant as the best species of the same genus.\r\nThe hybrids of Janczewski were quite fertile, and he points out that\r\nthere is no good reason why they should not be considered as good new\r\nspecies. If they had not been produced artificially, but found in the\r\nwild state, their origin would have been unknown, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that they would have been described by the best systematists as\r\nspecies of the same value as their parents. Such is especially the case\r\nwith a hybrid between _Anemone magellanica_ and the common _Anemone\r\nsylvestris_.\r\n\r\nStarting from similar considerations Kerner von Marilaun pointed out the\r\nfact long ago that many so-called species, of rare occurrence, [267]\r\nstanding between two allied types, may be considered to have originated\r\nby a cross. Surely a wide field for abuse is opened by such an\r\nassertion, and it is quite a common habit to consider intermediate forms\r\nas hybrids, on the grounds afforded by their external characters alone,\r\nand without any exact knowledge of their real origin and often without\r\nknowing anything as to their constancy from seed. All such apparent\r\nexplanations are now slowly becoming antiquated and obsolete, but the\r\ncases adduced by Kerner seem to stand this test.\r\n\r\nKerner designates a willow, _Salix ehrhartiana_ as a constant hybrid\r\nbetween _Salix alba_ and _S. pentandra_. _Rhododendron intermedium_ is\r\nan intermediate form between the hairy and the rusty species from the\r\nSwiss Alps, _R. hirsutum_ and _R. ferrugineum_, the former growing on\r\nchalky, and the other on silicious soils. Wherever both these types of\r\nsoil occur in the same valley and these two species approach one\r\nanother, the hybrid _R. intermedium_ is produced, and is often seen to\r\nbe propagating itself abundantly. As is indicated by the name, it\r\ncombines the essential characters of both parents.\r\n\r\n_Linaria italica_ is a hybrid toad-flax between _L. genistifolia_ and\r\n_L. vulgaris_, a cross which I have repeated in my garden. _Drosera\r\nobovata_ [268] is a hybrid sundew between _D. anglica_ and _D.\r\nrotundifolia_. _Primula variabilis_ is a hybrid between the two common\r\nprimroses, _P. officinalis_ and _P. grandiflora_. The willow-herb\r\n(_Epilobium_), the self-heal (_Brunella_) and the yellow pond-lilies\r\n(Nuphar) afford other instances of constant wild hybrids.\r\n\r\nMacfarlane has discovered a natural hybrid between two species of sundew\r\nin the swamps near Atco, N.J. The parents, _D. intermedia_ and _D.\r\nfiliformis_, were growing abundantly all around, but of the hybrid only\r\na group of eleven plants was found. A detailed comparison of the hybrid\r\nwith its parents demonstrated a minute blending of the anatomical\r\npeculiarities of the parental species.\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank of Santa Rosa, California, has produced a great many\r\nhybrid brambles, the qualities of which in many respects surpass those\r\nof the wild species. Most of them are only propagated by cuttings and\r\nlayers, not being stable from seed. But some crosses between the\r\nblackberry and the raspberry (_R. fruticosus_ and _R. idaeus_) which\r\nbear good fruit and have become quite popular, are so fixed in their\r\ntype as to reproduce their composite characters from seed with as much\r\nregularity as the species of _Rubus_ found in nature. Among them are the\r\n\"Phenomenal\" and the [269] \"Primus.\" The latter is a cross between the\r\nCalifornian dewberry and the Siberian raspberry and is certainly to be\r\nregarded as a good stable species, artificially produced. Bell Salter\r\ncrossed the willow-herbs _Epilobium tetragonum_ and _E. montanum_, and\r\nsecured intermediate hybrids which remained true to their type during\r\nfour successive generations.\r\n\r\nOther instances might be given. Many of them are to be found in\r\nhorticultural and botanical journals which describe their systematic and\r\nanatomical details. The question of stability is generally dealt with in\r\nan incidental manner, and in many cases it is difficult to reach\r\nconclusions from the facts given. Especially disturbing is the\r\ncircumstance that from a horticultural point of view it is quite\r\nsufficient that a new type should repeat itself in some of its offspring\r\nto be called stable, and that for this reason absolute constancy is\r\nrarely proved.\r\n\r\nThe range of constant hybrids would be larger by far were it not for two\r\nfacts. The first is the absolute sterility of so many beautiful hybrids,\r\nand the second is the common occurrence of retrogressive characters\r\namong cultivated plants. To describe the importance of both these groups\r\nof facts would take too much [270] time, and therefore it seems best to\r\ngive some illustrative examples instead.\r\n\r\nAmong the species of _Ribes_ or currant, which are cultivated in our\r\ngardens, the most beautiful are without doubt the Californian and the\r\nMissouri currant, or _Ribes sanguineum_ and _R. aureum_. A third form,\r\noften met with, is \"Gordon's currant,\" which is considered to be a\r\nhybrid between the two. It has some peculiarities of both parents. The\r\nleaves have the general form of the Californian parent, but are as\r\nsmooth as the Missouri species. The racemes or flower-spikes are densely\r\nflowered as in the red species, but the flowers themselves are of a\r\nyellow tinge, with only a flesh-red hue on the outer side of the calyx.\r\nIt grows vigorously and is easily multiplied by cuttings, but it never\r\nbears any fruit. Whether it would be constant, if fertile, is therefore\r\nimpossible to decide. _Berberis ilicifolia_ is considered as a hybrid\r\nbetween the European barberry (_B. vulgaris_) and the cultivated shrub\r\n_Mahonia aquifolia_. The latter has pinnate leaves, the former undivided\r\nones. The hybrid has undivided leaves which are more spiny than those of\r\nthe European parent, and which are not deciduous like them, but persist\r\nduring the winter, a peculiarity inherited from the _Mahonia_. As far as\r\nI [271] have been able to ascertain, this hybrid never produces seed.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of an absolutely sterile hybrid is the often quoted\r\n_Cytisus adami_. It is a cross between the common laburnum (_Cytisus\r\nLaburnum_) and another species of the same genus, _C. purpureus_, and\r\nhas some traits of both. But since the number of differentiating marks\r\nis very great in this case, most of the organs have become intermediate.\r\nIt is absolutely sterile. But it has the curious peculiarity of\r\nsplitting in a vegetative way. It has been multiplied on a large scale\r\nby grafting and was widely found in the parks and gardens of Europe\r\nduring the last century. Nearly all these specimens reverted from time\r\nto time to the presumable parents. Not rarely a bud of Adam's laburnum\r\nassumed all the qualities of the common laburnum, its larger leaves,\r\nricher flowered racemes, large and brightly yellow flowers and its\r\ncomplete fertility. Other buds on the same tree reverted to the purple\r\nparent, with its solitary small flowers, its dense shrublike branches\r\nand very small leaves. These too are fertile, though not producing their\r\nseeds as abundantly as the _C. Laburnum_ reversions. Many a botanist has\r\nsown the seeds of the latter and obtained only pure common _C. Laburnum_\r\nplants. I had a lot of nearly a hundred seedlings [272] myself, many of\r\nwhich have already flowered, bearing the leaves and flowers of the\r\ncommon species. Seeds of the purple reversions have also been sown, and\r\nalso yielded the parental type only.\r\n\r\nWhy this most curious hybrid sports so regularly and why others always\r\nremain true to their type is as yet an open question.\r\n\r\nBut recalling our former consideration of this subject the supposition\r\nseems allowable that the tendency to revert is not connected with the\r\ntype of the hybrid, but is apt to occur in some rare individuals of\r\nevery type. But since most of the sterile hybrids are only known to us\r\nin a single individual and its vegetative offspring, this surmise offers\r\nan explanation of the rare occurrence of sports.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must consider some of the so called hybrid races or strains\r\nof garden-plants. _Dahlia_, _Gladiolus_, _Amaryllis_, _Fuchsia_,\r\n_Pelargonium_ and many other common flowers afford the best known\r\ninstances. Immeasurable variability seems here to be the result of\r\ncrossing. But on a closer inspection the range of characters is not so\r\nvery much wider in these hybrid races than in the groups of parent\r\nspecies which have contributed to the origin of the hybrids. Our\r\ntuberous begonias owe their variability to at least seven original\r\nparent species, [273] and to the almost incredible number of\r\ncombinations which are possible between their characters. The first of\r\nthese crosses was made in the nursery of Veitch and Sons near London by\r\nSeden, and the first hybrid is accordingly known as _Begonia sedeni_ and\r\nis still to be met with. It has been superseded by subsequent crosses\r\nbetween the _sedeni_ itself and the _Veitchi_ and _rosiflora_, the\r\n_davisii_, the _clarkii_ and others. Each of them contributed its\r\nadvantageous qualities, such as round flowers, rosy color, erect flower\r\nstalks, elevation of the flowers above the foliage and others. New\r\ncrosses are being made continuously, partly between the already existing\r\nhybrids and partly with newly introduced wild species. Only rarely is it\r\npossible to get pure seeds, and I have not yet been able to ascertain\r\nwhether the hybrids would come true from seed. Specific and varietal\r\ncharacters may occur together in many of the several forms, but nothing\r\nis as yet accurately known as to their behavior in pure fertilizations.\r\nConstancy and segregation are thrown together in such a manner that\r\nextreme variability results, and numerous beautiful types may be had,\r\nand others may be expected from further crosses. For a scientific\r\nanalysis, however, the large range of recorded facts and the written\r\nhistory, which at first sight [274] seems to have no lacunae, are not\r\nsufficient. Most of the questions remain open and need investigation. It\r\nwould be a capital idea to try to repeat the history of the begonias or\r\nany other hybrid race, making all the described crosses and then\r\nrecording the results in a manner requisite for complete and careful\r\nscientific investigations.\r\n\r\nMany large genera of hybrid garden-flowers owe their origin to species\r\nrich in varieties or in elementary subspecies. Such is the case with the\r\ngladiolus and the tulips. In other cases the original types have not\r\nbeen obtained from the wild state but from the cultures of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe dahlias were cultivated in Mexico when first discovered by\r\nEuropeans, and the chrysanthemums have been introduced from the old\r\ngardens of Japan. Both of them consisted of various types, which\r\nafterwards have been increased chiefly by repeated intercrossing.\r\n\r\nThe history of many hybrid races is obscure, or recorded by different\r\nauthorities in a different way. Some have derived their evidence from\r\none nursery, some from another, and the crosses evidently may have been\r\ndifferent in different places. The early history of the gladiolus is an\r\ninstance. The first crosses are recorded to have been made between\r\n_Gladiolus_ [275] _psittacinus_ and _G. cardinalis_, and between their\r\nhybrid, which is still known under the name of gandavensis_ and the\r\n_purpureo-auratus_. But other authors give other lines of descent. So it\r\nis with _Amaryllis_, which is said by De Graaff to owe its stripes to\r\n_A. vittata_, its fine form to _A. brasiliensis_, the large petals to\r\n_A. psittacina_, the giant flowers to _A. leopoldi_, and the piebald\r\npatterns to _A. pardina_. But here, too, other authors give other\r\nderivations.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results of our inquiry we see in the first place how\r\nvery much remains to be done. Many old crosses must be repeated and\r\nstudied anew, taking care of the purity of the cross as well as of the\r\nharvesting of the seeds. Many supposed facts will be shown to be of\r\ndoubtful validity. New facts have to be gathered, and in doing so the\r\ndistinction between specific and varietal marks must be taken strictly\r\ninto account. The first have originated as progressive mutations; they\r\ngive unbalanced crosses with a constant offspring, as far as experience\r\nnow goes. The second are chiefly due to retrograde modifications, and\r\nwill be the subject of the next lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[276]\r\n\r\nLECTURE X\r\n\r\nMENDEL'S LAW OF BALANCED CROSSES\r\n\r\nIn the scientific study of the result of crosses, the most essential\r\npoint is the distinction of the several characters of the parents in\r\ntheir combination in the hybrids and their offspring. From a theoretical\r\npoint of view it would be best to choose parents which would differ only\r\nin a single point. The behavior of the differentiating character might\r\nthen easily be seen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, such simple cases do not readily occur. Most species, and\r\neven many elementary species are distinguished by more than one quality.\r\nVarieties deviating only in one unit-character from the species, are\r\nmore common. But a closer inspection often reveals some secondary\r\ncharacters which may be overlooked in comparative or descriptive\r\nstudies, but which reassume their importance in experimental crossings.\r\n\r\nIn a former lecture we have dealt with the qualities which must be\r\nconsidered as being due to the acquisition of new characters. If we\r\n[277] compare the new form in this case with the type from which it has\r\noriginated, it may be seen that the new character does not find its\r\nmate, or its opposite, and it will be unpaired in the hybrid.\r\n\r\nIn the case of retrogressive changes the visible modification is due, at\r\nleast in the best known instances, to the reduction of an active quality\r\nto a state of inactivity or latency. Now if we make a cross between a\r\nspecies and its variety, the differentiating character will be due to\r\nthe same internal unit, with no other difference than that it is active\r\nin the species and latent in the variety. In the hybrid these two\r\ncorresponding units will make a pair. But while all other pairs in the\r\nsame hybrid individuals consist of like antagonists, only this pair\r\nconsists of slightly unlike opponents.\r\n\r\nThis conception of varietal crosses leads to three assertions, which\r\nseem justifiable by actual experience.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no reason for a diminution of the fertility, as all\r\ncharacters are paired in the hybrid, and no disturbance whatever ensues\r\nin its internal structure. Secondly, it is quite indifferent, how the\r\ntwo types are combined, or which of them is chosen as pistillate and\r\nwhich as staminate parent. The deviating pair will have the same\r\nconstitution in both cases, being [278] built up of one active and one\r\ndormant unit. Thirdly this deviating pair will exhibit the active unit\r\nwhich it contains, and the hybrid will show the aspect of the parent in\r\nwhich the character was active and not that of the parent in which it\r\nwas dormant. Now the active quality was that of the species, and its\r\nlatent state was found in the variety. Hence the inference that hybrids\r\nbetween a species and its retrograde variety will bear the aspect of the\r\nspecies. This attribute may be fully developed, and then the hybrid will\r\nnot be distinguishable from the pure species in its outer appearance. Or\r\nthe character may be incompletely evolved, owing to the failure of\r\ncooperation of the dormant unit. In this case the hybrid will be in some\r\nsense intermediate between its parents, but these instances are more\r\nrare than the alternate ones, though presumably they may play an\r\nimportant part in the variability of many hybrid garden-flowers.\r\n\r\nAll of these three rules are supported by a large amount of evidence.\r\nThe complete fertility of varietal hybrids is so universally\r\nacknowledged that it is not worth while to give special instances. With\r\nmany prominent systematists it has become a test between species and\r\nvarieties, and from our present point of view this assumption is\r\ncorrect. Only the test is of little use in practice, as fertility may be\r\ndiminished [279] in unbalanced unions in all possible degrees, according\r\nto the amount of difference between the parents. If this amount is\r\nslight, if for instance, only one unit-character causes the difference,\r\nthe injury to fertility may, be so small as to be practically nothing.\r\nHence we see that this test would not enable us to judge of the doubtful\r\ncases, although it is quite sufficient as a proof in cases of wider\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nOur second assertion related to the reciprocal crosses. This is the name\r\ngiven to two sexual combinations between the same parents, but with\r\ninterchanged places as to which furnishes the pollen. In unbalanced\r\ncrosses of the genus _Oenothera_ the hybrids of such reciprocal unions\r\nare often different, as we have previously shown. Sometimes both\r\nresemble the pollen parent more, in other instances the pistil-parent.\r\nIn varietal crosses no such divergence is as yet known. It would be\r\nquite superfluous to adduce single cases as proofs for this rule, which\r\nwas formerly conceived to hold good for hybrids in general. The work of\r\nthe older hybridists, such as Koelreuter and Gaertner affords numerous\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nOur third rule is of a wholly different nature. Formerly the distinction\r\nbetween elementary species and varieties was not insisted upon, and the\r\nprinciple which stamps retrograde changes [280] as the true character of\r\nvarieties is a new one. Therefore it is necessary to cite a considerable\r\namount of evidence in order to prove the assertion that a hybrid bears\r\nthe active character of its parent-species and not the inactive\r\ncharacter of the variety chosen for the cross.\r\n\r\nWe may put this assertion in a briefer form, stating that the active\r\ncharacter prevails in the hybrid over its dormant antagonist. Or as it\r\nis equally often put, the one dominates and the other is recessive. In\r\nthis terminology the character of the species is dominant in the hybrid\r\nwhile that of the variety is recessive. Hence it follows that in the\r\nhybrid the latent or dormant unit is recessive, but it does not follow\r\nthat these three terms have the same meaning, as we shall see presently.\r\nThe term recessive only applies to the peculiar state into which the\r\nlatent character has come in the hybrid by its pairing with the\r\nantagonistic active unit.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is of the highest importance to consider crosses\r\nbetween varieties of recorded origin and the species from which they\r\nhave sprung. When dealing with mutations of celandine we shall see that\r\nthe laciniated form originated from the common celandine in a garden at\r\nHeidelberg about the year 1590. Among my _Oenotheras_ one of the eldest\r\nof the recent productions is the _O. brevistylis_ or short [281] styled\r\nspecies which was seen for the first time in the year 1889. The third\r\nexample offered is a hairless variety of the evening campion, _Lychnis\r\nvespertina_, found the same year, which hitherto had not been observed.\r\n\r\nFor these three cases I have made the crosses of the variety with the\r\nparent-species, and in each case the hybrid was like the species, and\r\nnot like the variety. Nor was it intermediate. Here it is proved that\r\nthe older character dominates the younger one.\r\n\r\nIn most cases of wild, and of garden-varieties, the relation between\r\nthem and the parent-species rests upon comparative evidence. Often the\r\nvariety is known to be younger, in other cases it may be only of local\r\noccurrence, but ordinarily the historic facts about its origin have\r\nnever been known or have long since been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe easiest and most widely known varietal crosses are those between\r\nvarieties with white flowers and the red- or blue-flowered species. Here\r\nthe color prevails in the hybrid over the lack of pigment, and as a rule\r\nthe hybrid is as deeply tinted as the species itself, and cannot be\r\ndistinguished from it, without an investigation of its hereditary\r\nqualities. Instances may be cited of the white varieties of the\r\nsnapdragon, of the red clover, the long-spurred violet (_Viola_ [282]\r\n_cornuta_) the sea-shore aster (_Aster Tripolium_), corn-rose\r\n(_Agrostemma Githago_), the Sweet William (_Silene Armeria_), and many\r\ngarden flowers, as for instance, the _Clarkia pulchella_, the\r\n_Polemonium coeruleum_, the _Veronica longifolia_, the gloxinias and\r\nothers. If the red hue is combined with a yellow ground-color in the\r\nspecies, the variety will be yellow and the hybrid will have the red and\r\nyellow mixture of the species as for instance, in the genus _Geum_. The\r\ntoad-flax has an orange-colored palate, and a variety occurs in which\r\nthe palate is of the same yellow tinge as the remaining parts of the\r\ncorolla. The hybrid between them is in all respects like the\r\nparent-species.\r\n\r\nOther instances could be given. In berries the same rule prevails. The\r\nblack nightshade has a variety with yellow berries, and the black color\r\nreturns in the hybrid. Even the foliage of some garden-plants may afford\r\ninstances, as for instance, the purplish amaranth (_Amaranthus\r\ncaudatus_). It has a green variety, but the hybrid between the two has\r\nthe red foliage of the species.\r\n\r\nSpecial marks in leaves and in flowers follow the same rule. Some\r\nvarieties of the opium poppy have large black patches at the basal end\r\nof the petals, while in others this pattern is entirely white. In\r\ncrossing two such varieties, [283] for instance, the dark \"Mephisto\"\r\nwith the white-hearted \"Danebrog,\" the hybrid shows the active character\r\nof the dark pattern.\r\n\r\nHairy species crossed with their smooth varieties produce hairy hybrids,\r\nas in some wheats, in the campion (_Lychnis_), in _Biscutella_ and\r\nothers. The same holds good for the crosses between spiny species and\r\ntheir unarmed derivatives, as in the thorn-apple, the corn-crowfoot\r\n(_Ranunculus arvensis_) and others.\r\n\r\nLack of starch in seeds is observed in some varieties of corn and of\r\npeas. When such derivatives are crossed with ordinary starch-producing\r\ntypes, the starch prevails in the hybrid.\r\n\r\nIt would take too much time to give further examples. But there is still\r\none point which should be insisted upon. It is not the systematic\r\nrelation of the two parents of a cross, that is decisive, but only the\r\noccurrence of the same quality, in the one in an active, and in the\r\nother in an inactive condition. Hence, whenever this relation occurs\r\nbetween the parents of a cross, the active quality prevails in the\r\nhybrid, even when the parents differ from each other in other respects\r\nso as to be distinguished as systematic species. The white and red\r\ncampions give a red hybrid, the black and pale henbane (_Hyoscyamus\r\nniger_ and _H. pallidus_) give a hybrid [284] with the purple veins and\r\ncenter in the corolla of the former, the white and blue thornapple\r\nproduce a blue hybrid, and so on. Instances of this sort are common in\r\ncultivated plants.\r\n\r\nHaving given this long list of examples of the rule of the dominancy of\r\nthe active character over the opposite dormant unit, the question\r\nnaturally arises as to how the antagonistic units are combined in the\r\nhybrid. This question is of paramount importance in the consideration of\r\nthe offspring of the hybrids. But before taking it up it is as well to\r\nlearn the real signification of recessiveness in the hybrids themselves.\r\n\r\nRecessive characters are shown by those rare cases, in which hybrids\r\nrevert to the varietal parent in the vegetative way. In other words by\r\nbud-variations or sports, analogous to the splitting of Adam's laburnum\r\ninto its parents, by means of bud-variation already described. But here\r\nthe wide range of differentiating characters of the parents of this most\r\ncurious hybrid fail. The illustrative examples are extremely simple, and\r\nare limited to the active and inactive condition of only one quality.\r\n\r\nAn instance is given by the long-leaved veronica (_Veronica\r\nlongifolia_), which has bluish flowers in long spikes. The hybrid\r\nbetween [285] this species and its white variety has a blue corolla. But\r\noccasionally it produces some purely white flowers, showing its power of\r\nseparating the parental heritages, combined in its internal structures.\r\nThis reversion is not common, but in thousands of flowering spikes one\r\nmay expect to find at least one of them. Sometimes it is a whole stem\r\nspringing from the underground system and bearing only white flowers on\r\nall its spikes. In other instances it is only a side branch which\r\nreverts and forms white flowers on a stem, the other spikes of which\r\nremain bluish. Sometimes a spike even differentiates longitudinally,\r\nbearing on one side blue and on the other white corollas, and the white\r\nstripe running over the spike may be seen to be long and large, or\r\nnarrow and short in various degrees. In such cases it is evident that\r\nthe heritages of the parents remain uninfluenced by each other during\r\nthe whole life of the hybrid, working side by side, but the active\r\nelement always prevails over its latent opponent which is ready to break\r\nfree whenever an opportunity is offered.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally assumed that this incomplete mixture of the parental\r\nqualities in a hybrid, this uncertain and limited combination is the\r\ntrue cause of the many deviations, exhibited by varietal hybrids when\r\ncompared with their [286] parents. Partial departures are rare in the\r\nhybrids themselves, but in their offspring the divergence becomes the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nSegregation seems to be a very difficult process in the vegetative way,\r\nbut it must be very easy in sexual reproduction, indeed so easy as to\r\nshow itself in nearly every single instance.\r\n\r\nLeaving this first generation, the original hybrids, we now come to a\r\ndiscussion of their offspring. Hybrids should be fertilized either by\r\ntheir own pollen, or by that of other individuals born from the same\r\ncross. Only in this case can the offspring be considered as a means of\r\narriving at a decision as to the internal nature of the hybrids\r\nthemselves. Breeders generally prefer to fertilize hybrids with the\r\npollen of their parents. But this operation is to be considered as a new\r\ncross, and consequently is wholly excluded from our present discussion.\r\nHence it follows that a clear insight into the heredity of hybrids may\r\nbe expected only from scientific experiments. Furthermore some of the\r\ndiversity observed as a result of ordinary crosses, may be due to the\r\ninstability of the parents themselves or at least of one of them, since\r\nbreeders ordinarily choose for their crosses some already very variable\r\nstrain. Combining such a strain with the desirable qualities of some\r\nnewly imported species, a new strain may [287] result, having the new\r\nattribute in addition to all the variability of the old types. In\r\nscientific experiments made for the purpose of investigating the general\r\nlaws of hybridity, such complex cases are therefore to be wholly\r\nexcluded. The hereditary purity of the parents must be considered as one\r\nof the first conditions of success.\r\n\r\nMoreover the progeny must be numerous, since neither constancy, nor the\r\nexact proportions in the case of instability, can be determined with a\r\nsmall lot of plants.\r\n\r\nFinally, and in order to come to a definite choice of research material,\r\nwe should keep in mind that the chief object is to ascertain the\r\nrelation of the offspring to their parents. Now in nearly all cases the\r\nseeds are separated from the fruits and from one another, before it\r\nbecomes possible to judge of their qualities. One may open a fruit and\r\ncount the seeds, but ordinarily nothing is noted as to their characters.\r\nIn this respect no other plant equals the corn or maize, as the kernels\r\nremain together on the spike, and as it has more than one variety\r\ncharacterized by the color, or constitution, or other qualities of the\r\ngrains. A corn-grain, however, is not a seed, but a fruit containing a\r\nseed. Hence the outer parts pertain to the parent plant and only the\r\ninnermost ones to the [288] seedling and therefore to the following\r\ngeneration. Fruit-characters thus do not offer the qualities we need,\r\nonly the qualities resulting from fertilizations are characteristic of\r\nthe new generation. Such attributes are afforded in some cases by the\r\ncolor, in others by the chemical constitution.\r\n\r\nWe will choose the latter, and take the sugarcorn in comparison with the\r\nordinary or starch producing forms for our starting point. Both sugar-\r\nand starch-corns have smooth fruits when ripening. No difference is to\r\nbe seen in the young ripe spikes. Only the taste, or a direct chemical\r\nanalysis might reveal the dissimilarity. But as soon as the spikes are\r\ndried, a diversity is apparent. The starchy grains remain smooth, but\r\nthe sugary kernels lose so much water that they become wrinkled. The\r\nformer becomes opaque, the latter more or less transparent. Every single\r\nkernel may instantly be recognized as belonging to either of the types\r\nin question, even if but a single grain of the opposite quality might be\r\nmet with on a spike. Kernels can be counted on the spike, and since\r\nordinary spikes may bear from 300-500 grains and often more, the\r\nnumerical relation of the different types may be deduced with great\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nComing now to our experiment, both starchy [289] and sugary varieties\r\nare in this respect wholly constant, when cultivated separately. No\r\nchange is to be seen in the spikes. Furthermore it is very easy to make\r\nthe crosses. The best way is to cultivate both types in alternate rows\r\nand to cut off the staminate panicles a few days before they open their\r\nfirst flowers. If this operation is done on all the individuals of one\r\nvariety, sparing all the panicles of the other, it is manifest that all\r\nthe plants will become fertilized by the latter, and hence that the\r\ncastrated plants will only bear hybrid seeds.\r\n\r\nThe experiment may be made in two ways; by castrating the sugary or the\r\nstarchy variety. In both cases the hybrid kernels are the same. As to\r\ntheir composition they repeat the active character of the starchy\r\nvariety. The sugar is only accumulated as a result of an incapacity of\r\nchanging it into starch, and the lack of this capacity is to be\r\nconsidered as a retrogressive varietal mark. The starch-producing unit\r\ncharacter, which is active in the ordinary sorts of corns, is therefore\r\nlatent in sugar-corn.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the second generation, the hybrid grains are sown\r\nunder ordinary conditions, but sufficiently distant from any other\r\nvariety of corn to insure pure fertilization. The several individuals\r\nmay be left to pollinate [290] each other, or they may be artificially\r\npollinated with their own pollen.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the experiments is shown by the spikes, as soon as they\r\ndry. Each spike bears two sorts of kernels irregularly dispersed over\r\nits surface. In this point all the spikes are alike. On each of them one\r\nmay see on the first inspection that the majority of the kernels are\r\nstarch-containing seeds, while a minor part becomes wrinkled and\r\ntransparent according to the rule for sugary seeds. This fact shows at\r\nonce that the hybrid race is not stable, but has differentiated the\r\nparental characters, bringing those of the varietal parent to perfect\r\npurity and isolation. Whether the same holds good for the starchy\r\nparent, it is impossible to judge from the inspection of the spikes,\r\nsince it has been seen in the first generation that the hybrid kernels\r\nare not visibly distinguished from those of the pure starch-producing\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to count the number of both sorts of grains in the spike\r\nof such a hybrid. In doing so we find, that the proportion is nearly the\r\nsame on all the spikes, and only slight variations would be found in\r\nhundreds of them. One-fourth of the seeds are wrinkled and three-fourths\r\nare always smooth. The number may vary in single instances and be a\r\nlittle more or a little less than 25%, ranging, for [291] instance, from\r\n20 to 27%, but as a rule, the average is found nearly equal to 25%.\r\n\r\nThe sugary kernels, when separated from the hybrid spikes and sown\r\nseparately, give rise to pure sugary race, in no degree inferior in\r\npurity to the original variety. But the starchy kernels are of different\r\ntypes, some of them being internally like the hybrids of the first\r\ngeneration and others like the original parent. To decide between these\r\ntwo possibilities, it is necessary to examine their progeny.\r\n\r\nFor the study of this third hybrid generation we will now take another\r\nexample, the opium poppies. They usually have a dark center in the\r\nflowers, the inferior parts of the four petals being stained a deep\r\npurple, or often nearly black. Many varieties exhibit this mark as a\r\nlarge black cross in the center of the flower. In other varieties the\r\npigment is wanting, the cross being of a pure white. Obviously it is\r\nonly reduced to a latent condition, as in so many other cases of loss of\r\ncolor, since it reappears in a hybrid with the parent-species.\r\n\r\nFor my crosses I have taken the dark-centered \"Mephisto\" and the\r\n\"Danebrog,\" or Danish flag, with a white cross on a red field. The\r\nsecond year the hybrids were all true to the type of \"Mephisto.\" From\r\nthe seeds of each artificially self-fertilized capsule, one-fourth\r\n(22.5%) [292] in each instance reverted to the varietal mark of the\r\nwhite cross, and three-fourths (77.5%) retained the dark heart. Once\r\nmore the flowers were self-pollinated and the visits of insects\r\nexcluded. The recessives now gave only recessives, and hence we may\r\nconclude that the varietal marks had returned to stability. The dark\r\nhearted or dominants behaved in two different ways. Some of them\r\nremained true to their type, all their offspring being dark-hearted.\r\nEvidently they had returned to the parent with the active mark, and had\r\nreassumed this type as purely as the recessives had reached theirs. But\r\nothers kept true to the hybrid character of the former generation,\r\nrepeating in their progeny exactly the same mixture as their parents,\r\nthe hybrids of the first generation, had given.\r\n\r\nThis third generation therefore gives evidence, that the second though\r\napparently showing only two types, really consists of three different\r\ngroups. Two of them have reassumed the stability of their original\r\ngrandparents, and the third has retained the instability of the hybrid\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises as to the numerical relation of these groups.\r\nOur experiments gave the following results: [293]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cross   1. Generation  2. Generation  3. Generation\r\n\r\n   Mephisto                               4- 100% Mephisto\r\n          |                              /\r\n          |                             /\r\n          |                 77.5 %  Dom.\r\n          |               /             \\\r\n          > --All Mephisto               \\\r\n          |               \\               9- all hybrids with 83-68%\r\n          |                 22.5 % Rec.    dominants and 17-32%\r\n          |                                 recessives. 100% Danebrog.\r\n   Danebrog\r\n\r\nExamining these figures we find one-fourth of constant recessives, as\r\nhas already been said, further one-fourth of constant dominants, and the\r\nrest or one half as unstable hybrids. Both of the pure groups have\r\ntherefore reappeared [293] in the same numbers. Calling A the specimens\r\nwith the pure active mark, L those with the latent mark, and H the\r\nhybrids, these proportions may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n           1A+2H+1L.\r\n\r\nThis simple law for the constitution of the second generation of\r\nvarietal hybrids with a single differentiating mark in their parents is\r\ncalled the law of Mendel. Mendel published it in 1865, but his paper\r\nremained nearly unknown to scientific hybridists. It is only of late\r\nyears that it has assumed a high place in scientific literature, and\r\nattained the first rank as an investigation on fundamental questions of\r\nheredity. [294] Read in the light of modern ideas on unit characters it\r\nis now one of the most important works on heredity and has already\r\nwidespread and abiding influence on the philosophy of hybridism in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nBut from its very nature and from the choice of the material made by\r\nMendel, it is restricted to balanced or varietal crosses. It assumes\r\npairs of characters and calls the active unit of the pair dominant, and\r\nthe latent recessive, without further investigations of the question of\r\nlatency. It was worked out by Mendel for a large group of varieties of\r\npeas, but it holds good, with only apparent exceptions, for a wide range\r\nof cases of crosses of varietal characters. Recently many instances have\r\nbeen tested, and even in many cases third and later generations have\r\nbeen counted, and whenever the evidence was complete enough to be\r\ntrusted, Mendel's prophecy has been found to be right.\r\n\r\nAccording to this law of Mendel's the pairs of antagonistic characters\r\nin the hybrid split up in their progeny, some individuals reverting to\r\nthe pure parental types, some crossing with each other anew, and so\r\ngiving rise to a new generation of hybrids. Mendel has given a very\r\nsuggestive and simple explanation of his formula. Putting this in the\r\nterminology of to-day, and limiting it to the occurrence of only [295]\r\none differential unit in the parents, we may give it in the following\r\nmanner. In fertilization, the characters of both parents are not\r\nuniformly mixed, but remain separated though most intimately combined in\r\nthe hybrid throughout life. They are so combined as to work together\r\nnearly always, and to have nearly equal influence on all the processes\r\nof the whole individual evolution. But when the time arrives to produce\r\nprogeny, or rather to produce the sexual cells through the combination\r\nof which the offspring arises, the two parental characters leave each\r\nother, and enter separately into the sexual cells. From this it may be\r\nseen that one-half of the pollen-cells will have the quality of one\r\nparent, and the other the quality of the other. And the same holds good\r\nfor [296] the egg-cells. Obviously the qualities lie latent in the\r\npollen and in the egg, but ready to be evolved after fertilization has\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nGranting these premises, we may now ask as to the results of the\r\nfertilization of hybrids, when this is brought about by their own\r\npollen. We assume that numerous pollen grains fertilize numerous egg\r\ncells. This assumption at once allows of applying the law of\r\nprobability, and to infer that of each kind of pollen grains one-half\r\nwill reach egg-cells with the same quality [297] and the other half\r\novules with the opposite character.\r\n\r\nCalling P pollen and O ovules, and representing the active mark by P and\r\nO, the latent qualities by P' and O', they would combine as follows:\r\n\r\n   P + 0 giving uniform pairs with the active mark,\r\n   P  + 0' giving unequal pairs,\r\n   P' + 0  giving unequal pairs,\r\n   P' + 0' giving uniform pairs with the latent mark.\r\n\r\nIn this combination the four groups are obviously of the same size, each\r\ncontaining one-fourth of the offspring. Manifestly they correspond\r\nexactly to the direct results of the experiments, P + O representing the\r\nindividuals which reverted to the specific mark, P' + O' those who\r\nreassumed the varietal quality and P + O' and P + O' those who\r\nhybridized [298] for the second time. These considerations lead us to\r\nthe following form of Mendel's,\r\n\r\n   P + O = 1/4 Active or 1A,\r\n\r\n   P + O'\r\n          > = 1/2 Hybrid or 2 H,\r\n   P' + O\r\n\r\n   P' + O' = 1/4 Latent or 1 L,\r\n\r\nWhich is evidently the same as Mendel's empirical law given above.\r\n\r\nTo give the proof of these assumptions Mendel has devised a very simple\r\ncrossing experiment, [299] which he has effected with his varieties of\r\npeas. I have repeated it with the sugar-corn, which gives far better\r\nmaterial for demonstration. It starts from the inference that if\r\ndissimilarity among the pollen grains is excluded, the diversity of the\r\novules must at once became manifest and vice versa. In other terms, if a\r\nhybrid of the first generation is not allowed to fertilize itself, but\r\nis pollinated by one of its parents, the result will be in accordance\r\nwith the Mendelian formula.\r\n\r\nIn order to see an effect on the spikes produced in this way, it is of\r\ncourse necessary to fertilize them with the pollen of the variety, and\r\nnot with that of the specific type. The latter would give partly pure\r\nstarchy grains and partly hybrid kernels, but these would assume the\r\nsame type. But if we pollinate the hybrid with pollen of a pure\r\nsugar-corn, we may predict the result as follows.\r\n\r\nIf the spike of the hybrid contains dormant paternal marks in one-half\r\nof its flowers and in the other half maternal latent qualities, the\r\nsugar-corn pollen will combine with one-half of the ovules to give\r\nhybrids, and with the other half so as to give pure sugar-grains. Hence\r\nwe see that it will be possible to count out directly the two groups of\r\novules on inspecting the ripe and dry spikes. Experience teaches us\r\n[298] that both are present, and in nearly equal numbers; one-half of\r\nthe grains remaining smooth, and the other half becoming wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding experiment could be made with plants of a pure\r\nsugar-race by pollination with hybrid pollen. The spikes would show\r\nexactly the same mixture as in the above case, but now this may be\r\nconsidered as conclusive proof that half the pollen-grains represent the\r\nquality of one parent and the other half the quality of the other.\r\n\r\nAnother corollary of Mendel's law is the following. In each generation\r\ntwo groups return to purity, and one-half remains hybrid. These last\r\nwill repeat the same phenomenon of splitting in their progeny, and it is\r\neasily seen that the same rule will hold good for all succeeding\r\ngenerations. According to Mendel's principle, in each year there is a\r\nnew hybridization, differing in no respect from the first and original\r\none. If the hybrids only are propagated, each year will show one-fourth\r\nof the offspring returning to the specific character, one-fourth\r\nassuming the type of the variety and one-half remaining hybrid. I have\r\ntested this with a hybrid between the ordinary nightshade with black\r\nberries, and its variety, _Solanum nigrum chlorocarpum_, with pale\r\nyellow fruits. Eight generations of the hybrids were cultivated, [299]\r\ndisregarding always the reverting offspring. At the end I counted the\r\nprogeny of the sixth and seventh generations and found figures for their\r\nthree groups of descendants, which exactly correspond to Mendel's\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nUntil now we have limited ourselves to the consideration of single\r\ndifferentiating units. This discussion gives a clear insight into the\r\nfundamental phenomena of hybrid fertilization. It at once shows the\r\ncorrectness of the assumption of unit-characters, and of their pairing\r\nin the sexual combinations.\r\n\r\nBut Mendel's law is not at all restricted to these simple cases. Quite\r\non the contrary, it explains the most intricate questions of\r\nhybridization, providing they do not transgress the limits of\r\nsymmetrical unions. But in this realm nearly all results may be\r\ncalculated beforehand, on the ground of the principle of probability.\r\nOnly one more assumption need be discussed. The several pairs of\r\nantagonistic characters must be independent from, and uninfluenced by,\r\none another. This premise seems to hold good in the vast majority of\r\ncases, though rare exceptions seem to be not entirely wanting. Hence the\r\nnecessity of taking all predictions from Mendel's law only as\r\nprobabilities, which will prove true in most, but not necessarily in all\r\ncases. [300] But here we will limit ourselves to normal cases.\r\n\r\nThe first example to be considered is obviously the assumption that the\r\nparents of a cross differ from each other in respect to two characters.\r\nA good illustrative example is afforded by the thorn-apple. I have\r\ncrossed the blue flowered thorny form, usually known as _Datura Tatula_,\r\nwith the white thornless type, designated as _D. Stramonium inermis_.\r\nThorns and blue pigment are obviously active qualities, as they are\r\ndominant in the hybrids. In the second generation both pairs of\r\ncharacters are resolved into their constituents and paired anew\r\naccording to Mendel's law. After isolating my hybrids during the period\r\nof flowering, I counted among their progeny:\r\n\r\n     128 individuals with blue flowers and thorns\r\n      47 individuals with blue flowers and without thorns\r\n      54 individuals with white flowers and thorns\r\n      21 individuals with white flowers and without thorns\r\n     ----\r\n     250\r\n\r\nThe significance of these numbers may easily be seen, when we calculate\r\nwhat was to be expected on the assumption that both characters follow\r\nMendel's law, and that both are independent from each other. Then we\r\nwould have three-fourths blue offspring and one-fourth individuals with\r\nwhite flowers. Each of these [301] two groups would consist of\r\nthorn-bearing and thornless plants, in the same numerical relation.\r\nThus, we come to the four groups observed in our experiment, and are\r\nable to calculate their relative size in the following way:\r\n\r\n                                               Proportion\r\n     Blue with thorns  3/4 X 3/4 = 9/16 = 56.25%   9\r\n     Blue, unarmed     3/4 X 1/4 = 3/16 = 18.75%   3\r\n     White with thorns 1/4 X 3/4 = 3/16 = 18.75%   3\r\n     White, unarmed    1/4 X 1/4 = 1/16 =  6.25%   1\r\n\r\nIn order to compare this inference from Mendel's law and the assumption\r\nof independency, with the results of our experiments, we must calculate\r\nthe figures of the latter in percentages. In this way we find:\r\n\r\n                             Found      Calculated\r\n        Blue with thorns    128=51%        56.25%\r\n        Blue unarmed         47=19%        18.75%\r\n        White with thorns    54=22%        18.75%\r\n        White unarmed        21= 8%         6.25%\r\n\r\nThe agreement of the experimental and the theoretical figures is as\r\nclose as might be expected.\r\n\r\nThis experiment is to be considered only as an illustrative example of a\r\nrule of wide application. The rule obviously will hold good in all such\r\ncases as comply with the two conditions already premised, viz.: that\r\neach character agrees with Mendel's law, and that both are wholly\r\nindependent of each other. It is clear that our figures show the\r\nnumerical composition [302] of the hybrid offspring for any single\r\ninstance, irrespective of the morphological nature of the qualities\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nMendel has proved the correctness of these deductions by his experiments\r\nwith peas, and by combining their color (yellow or green) with the\r\nchemical composition (starch or sugar) and other pairs of characters. I\r\nwill now give two further illustrations afforded by crosses of the\r\nordinary campion. I used the red-flowered or day-campion, which is a\r\nperennial herb, and a smooth variety of the white evening-campion, which\r\nflowers as a rule in the first summer. The combination of flower-color\r\nand pubescence gave the following composition for the second hybrid\r\ngeneration:\r\n\r\n                         Number   %  Calculation\r\n     Hairy and red         70    44     56.25%\r\n     Hairy and white       23    14     18.75%\r\n     Smooth and red        46    23     18.75%\r\n     Smooth and white      19    12      6.25%\r\n\r\nFor the combination of pubescence and the capacity of flowering in the\r\nfirst year I found:\r\n\r\n                         Number   %   Calculated\r\n     Hairy, flowering     286    52     56.25%\r\n     Hairy, without stem  128    23     18.75%\r\n     Smooth, flowering     96    17     18.75%\r\n     Smooth, without stem  42     8      6.25%\r\n\r\nMany other cases have been tested by different writers and the general\r\nresult is the [303] applicability of Mendel's formula to all cases\r\ncomplying with the given conditions.\r\n\r\nIntentionally I have chosen for the last example two pairs of\r\nantagonisms, relating to the same pair of plants, and which may be\r\ntested in one experiment and combined in one calculation.\r\n\r\nFor the latter we need only assume the same conditions as mentioned\r\nbefore, but now for three different qualities. It is easily seen that\r\nthe third quality would split each of our four groups into two smaller\r\nones in the proportion of 3/4 : 1/4.\r\n\r\nWe would then get eight groups of the following composition:\r\n\r\n               9/16 X 3/4 = 27/64  or  42.2%\r\n               9/16 X 1/4 =  9/64   \"  14.1%\r\n               3/16 X 3/4 =  9/64   \"  14.1%\r\n               3/16 X 1/4 =  3/64   \"   4.7%\r\n               3/16 X 3/4 =  9/64   \"  14.1%\r\n               3/16 X 1/4 =  3/64   \"   4.7%\r\n               1/16 X 3/4 =  3/64   \"   4.7%\r\n               1/16 X 1/4 =  1/64   \"   1.6%\r\n\r\nThe characters chosen for our experiment include the absence of stem and\r\nflowers in the first year, and therefore would require a second year to\r\ndetermine the flower-color on the perennial specimens. Instead of doing\r\nso I have taken another character, shown by the teeth of the capsules\r\nwhen opening. These curve outwards [304] in the red campion, but lack\r\nthis capacity in the evening-campion, diverging only until an upright\r\nposition is reached. The combination of hairs, colors and teeth gives\r\neight groups, and the counting of their respective numbers of\r\nindividuals gave the following:\r\n\r\n                          Teeth\r\n     Hairs    Flowers  of capsules  Number   %    Calculated\r\n\r\n     Hairy      red      curved       91     47     42.2%\r\n     Hairy      red      straight     15     7.5    14.1%\r\n     Hairy     white     curved       23     12     14.1%\r\n     Hairy     white     straight     17     8.5     4.7%\r\n     Smooth     red      curved       23     12     14.1%\r\n     Smooth     red      straight      9     4.5     4.7%\r\n     Smooth    white     curved        5     2.5     4.7%\r\n     Smooth    white     straight     12      6      1.6%\r\n\r\nThe agreement is as comprehensive as might be expected from an\r\nexperiment with about 200 plants, and there can be no doubt that a\r\nrepetition on a larger scale would give still closer agreement.\r\n\r\nIn the same way we might proceed to crosses with four or more\r\ndifferentiating characters. But each new character will double the\r\nnumber of the groups. Four characters will combine into 16 groups, five\r\ninto 32, six into 64, seven into 128, etc. Hence it is easily seen that\r\nthe size of the experiments must be made larger and larger in the same\r\nratio, if we intend to expect numbers equally trustworthy. For [305]\r\nseven differentiating marks 16,384 individuals are required for a\r\ncomplete series. And in this set the group with the seven attributes all\r\nin a latent condition would contain only a single individual.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the practical value of these calculations is not very\r\ngreat. They indicate the size of the cultures required to get all the\r\npossible combinations, and show that in ordinary cases many thousands of\r\nindividuals have to be cultivated, in order to exhaust the whole range\r\nof possibilities. They further show that among all these thousands, only\r\nvery few are constant in all their characters; in fact, it may easily be\r\nseen that with seven differentiating points among the 16,384 named\r\nabove, only one individual will have all the seven qualities in pure\r\nactive, and only one will have them all in a purely dormant condition.\r\nThen there will be some with some attributes active and others latent,\r\nbut their numbers will also be very small. All others will split up in\r\nthe succeeding generation in regard to one or more of their apparently\r\nactive marks. And since only in very rare cases the stable hybrids can\r\nbe distinguished by external characters from the unstable ones, the\r\nstability of each individual bearing a desired combination of characters\r\nwould have to be established by experiment [306] after pure\r\nfertilization. Mendel's law teaches us to predict the difficulties, but\r\nhardly shows any way to avoid them. It lays great stress on the old\r\nprescript of isolation and pure fertilization, but it will have to be\r\nworked out and applied to a large number of practical cases before it\r\nwill gain a preeminent influence in horticultural practice.\r\n\r\nOr, as Bailey states it, we are only beginning to find a pathway through\r\nthe bewildering maze of hybridization.\r\n\r\nThis pathway is to be laid out with regard to the following\r\nconsiderations. We are not to cross species or varieties, or even\r\naccidental plants. We must cross unit-characters, and consider the\r\nplants only as the bearers of these units. We may assume that these\r\nunits are represented in the hereditary substance of the cell-nucleus by\r\ndefinite bodies of too small a size to be seen, but constituting\r\ntogether the chromosomes. We may call these innermost representatives of\r\nthe unit-characters pangenes, in accordance with Darwin's hypothesis of\r\npangenesis, or give them any other name, or we may even wholly abstain\r\nfrom such theoretical discussion, and limit ourselves to the conception\r\nof the visible character-units. These units then may be present, or\r\nlacking and in the first case active, or latent.\r\n\r\n[307] True elementary species differ from each other in a number of\r\nunit-characters, which do not contrast. They have arisen by progressive\r\nmutation. One species has one kind of unit, another species has another\r\nkind. On combining these, there can be no interchange. Mendelism assumes\r\nsuch an interchange between units of the same character, but in a\r\ndifferent condition. Activity and latency are such conditions, and\r\ntherefore Mendel's law obviously applies to them. They require pairs of\r\nantagonistic qualities, and have no connection whatever with those\r\nqualities, which do not find an opponent in the other parent. Now, only\r\npure varieties afford such pure conditions. When undergoing further\r\nmodifications, some of them may be in the progressive line and others in\r\nthe retrogressive. Progressive modifications give new units, which are\r\nnot in contrast with any other, retrograde changes turn active units\r\ninto the latent condition and so give rise to pairs. Ordinary species\r\ngenerally originate in this way, and hence differ from each other partly\r\nin specific, partly in varietal characters. As to the first, they give\r\nin their hybrids stable peculiarities, while as to the latter, they\r\nsplit up according to Mendel's law.\r\n\r\nUnpaired or unbalanced characters lie side by side with paired or\r\nbalanced qualities, and they [308] do so in nearly all the crosses made\r\nfor practical purposes, and in very many scientific experiments. Even\r\nMendel's peas were not pure in this respect, much less do the campions\r\nnoted above differ only in Mendelian characters.\r\n\r\nComparative and systematic studies must be made to ascertain the true\r\nnature of every unit in every single plant, and crossing experiments\r\nmust be based on these distinctions in order to decide what laws are\r\napplicable in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[309]\r\nD. EVER-SPORTING VARIETIES\r\n\r\nLECTURE XI\r\n\r\nSTRIPED FLOWERS\r\n\r\nTerminology is an awkward thing. It is as disagreeable to be compelled\r\nto make new names, as to be constrained to use the old faulty ones.\r\nDifferent readers may associate different ideas with the same terms, and\r\nunfortunately this is the case with much of the terminology of the\r\nscience of heredity and variability. What are species and what are\r\nvarieties? How many different conceptions are conveyed by the terms\r\nconstancy and variability? We are compelled to use them, but we are not\r\nat all sure that we are rightly understood when we do so.\r\n\r\nGradually new terms arise and make their way. They have a more limited\r\napplicability than the old ones, and are more narrowly circumscribed.\r\nThey are not to supplant the older terms, but permit their use in a more\r\ngeneral way.\r\n\r\n[310] One of these doubtful terms is the word _sport_. It often means\r\nbud-variation, while in other cases it conveys the same idea as the old\r\nbotanical term of mutation. But then all sorts of seemingly sudden\r\nvariations are occasionally designated by the same term by one writer or\r\nanother, and even accidental anomalies, such as teratological ascidia,\r\nare often said to arise by sports.\r\n\r\nIf we compare all these different conceptions, we will find that their\r\nmost general feature is the suddenness and the rarity of the phenomenon.\r\nThey convey the idea of something unexpected, something not always or\r\nnot regularly occurring. But even this demarcation is not universal, and\r\nthere are processes that are regularly repeated and nevertheless are\r\ncalled sports. These at least should be designated by another name.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid confusion as far as possible, with the least change in\r\nexisting terminology, I shall use the term \"ever-sporting varieties\" for\r\nsuch forms as are regularly propagated by seed, and of pure and not\r\nhybrid origin, but which sport in nearly every generation. The term is a\r\nnew one, but the facts are for the most part new, and require to be\r\nconsidered in a new light. Its meaning will become clearer at once when\r\nthe illustrations afforded by [311] striped flowers are introduced. In\r\nthe following discussion it will be found most convenient to give a\r\nsummary of what is known concerning them, and follow this by a\r\nconsideration of the detailed evidence obtained experimentally, which\r\nsupports the usage cited.\r\n\r\nThe striped variety of the larkspur of our gardens is known to produce\r\nmonochromatic flowers, in addition to striped ones. They may be borne by\r\nthe same racemes, or on different branches, or some seedlings from the\r\nsame parent-plant may bear monochromatic flowers while others may be\r\nstriped. Such deviations are usually called sports. But they occur\r\nyearly and regularly and may be observed invariably when the cultures\r\nare large enough. Such a variety I shall call \"ever-sporting.\"\r\n\r\nThe striped larkspur is one of the oldest garden varieties. It has kept\r\nits capacity of sporting through centuries, and therefore may in some\r\nsense be said to be quite stable. Its changes are limited to a rather\r\nnarrow circle, and this circle is as constant as the peculiarities of\r\nany other constant species or variety. But within this circle it is\r\nalways changing from small stripes to broad streaks, and from them to\r\npure colors. Here the variability is a thing of absolute constancy,\r\nwhile the constancy consists in eternal changes. Such apparent [312]\r\ncontradictions are unavoidable, when we apply the old term to such\r\nunusual though not at all new cases. Combining the stability and the\r\nqualities of sports in one word, we may evidently best express it by the\r\nnew term of eversporting variety.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss the exact nature of such varieties, and of the laws\r\nof heredity which govern them. But before doing so, I might point out,\r\nthat this new type is a very common one. It embraces most of the\r\nso-called variable types in horticulture, and besides these a wide range\r\nof anomalies.\r\n\r\nEvery ever-sporting variety has at least two different types, around and\r\nbetween which it varies in numerous grades, but to which it is\r\nabsolutely limited. Variegated leaves fluctuate between green and white,\r\nor green and yellow, and display these colors in nearly all possible\r\npatterns. But there variability ends, and even the patterns are\r\nordinarily narrowly prescribed in the single varieties. Double flowers\r\nafford a similar instance. On one side the single type, on the other the\r\nnearly wholly double model are the extreme limits, between which the\r\nvariability is confined. So it is also with monstrosities. The race\r\nconsists of anomalous and normal individuals, and displays between them\r\nall possible combinations of normal and monstrous [313] parts. But its\r\nvariability is restricted to this group. And large as the group may seem\r\non first inspection, it is in reality very narrow. Many monstrosities,\r\nsuch as fasciated branches, pitchers, split leaves, peloric flowers, and\r\nothers constitute such ever-sporting varieties, repeating their\r\nanomalies year by year and generation after generation, changing as much\r\nas possible, but remaining absolutely true within their limits as long\r\nas the variety exists.\r\n\r\nIt must be a very curious combination of the unit-characters which\r\ncauses such a state of continuous variability. The pure quality of the\r\nspecies must be combined with the peculiarity of the variety in such a\r\nway, that the one excludes the other, or modifies it to some extent,\r\nalthough both never fully display themselves in the same part of the\r\nsame plant. A corolla cannot be at once monochromatic and striped, nor\r\ncan the same part of a stem be twisted and straight. But neighboring\r\norgans may show the opposite attributes side by side.\r\n\r\nIn order to look closer into the real mechanism of this form of\r\nvariability, and of this constant tendency to occasional reversions, it\r\nwill be best to limit ourselves first to a single case, and to try to\r\ngather all the evidence, which can be obtained by an examination of the\r\nhereditary relations of its sundry constituents.\r\n\r\n[314] This may best be done by determining the degree of inheritance for\r\nthe various constituents of the race during a series of years. It is\r\nonly necessary to apply the two precautions of excluding all\r\ncross-fertilization, and of gathering the seeds of each individual\r\nseparately. We do not need to ascertain whether the variety as such is\r\npermanent; this is already clear from the simple fact of its antiquity\r\nin so many cases. We wish to learn what part each individual, or each\r\ngroup of individuals with similar characters, play in the common line of\r\ninheritance. In other words, we must build up a genealogical tree,\r\nembracing several generations and a complete set of the single cases\r\noccurring within the variety, in order to allow of its being considered\r\nas a part of the genealogy of the whole. It should convey to us an idea\r\nof the hereditary relations during the life-time of the variety.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the construction of such a genealogical tree\r\nrequires a number of separate experiments. These should be extended over\r\na series of years. Each should include a number of individuals large\r\nenough to allow the determination of the proportion of the different\r\ntypes among the offspring of a single plant. A species which is easily\r\nfertilized by its own pollen, and which bears capsules with [315] large\r\nquantities of seeds, obviously affords the best opportunities. As such,\r\nI have chosen the common snapdragon of the gardens, _Antirrhinum majus_.\r\nIt has many striped varieties, some tall, others of middle height, or of\r\ndwarfed stature. In some the ground-color of the flowers is yellow, in\r\nothers it is white, the yellow disappearing, with the exception of a\r\nlarge mark in the throat. On these ground-colors the red pigment is seen\r\nlying in streaks of pure carmine, with white intervals where the yellow\r\nfails, but combined with yellow to make a fiery red, and with yellow\r\nintervals when that color is present. This yellow color is quite\r\nconstant and does not vary in any marked degree, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that it seems to make narrower and broader stripes, according to\r\nthe parts of the corolla left free by the red pigment. But it is easily\r\nseen that this appearance is only a fallacious one.\r\n\r\nThe variety of snapdragon chosen was of medium height and with the\r\nyellow ground-color, and is known by horticulturists as _A. majus luteum\r\nrubro-striatum_. As the yellow tinge showed itself to be invariable; I\r\nmay limit my description to the red stripes.\r\n\r\nSome flowers of this race are striped, others are not. On a hasty survey\r\nthere seem to be three types, pure yellow, pure red, and stripes [316]\r\nwith all their intermediate links of narrower and broader, fewer and\r\nmore numerous streaks. But on a close inspection one does not succeed in\r\nfinding pure yellow racemes. Little lines of red may be found on nearly\r\nevery flower. They are the extreme type on this side of the range of\r\nvariability. From them an almost endless range of patterns passes over\r\nto the broadest stripes and even to whole sections of a pure red. But\r\nthen, between these and the wholly red flowers we observe a gap, which\r\nmay be narrower by the choice of numerous broad striped individuals, but\r\nwhich is never wholly filled up. Hence we see that the red flowers are a\r\nseparate type within the striped variety.\r\n\r\nThis red type springs yearly from the striped form, and yearly reverts\r\nto it. This is what in the usual descriptions of this snapdragon, is\r\ncalled its sporting. The breadth of the streaks is considered to be an\r\nordinary case of variability, but the red flowers appear suddenly,\r\nwithout the expected links. Therefore they are to be considered as\r\nsports. Similarly the red forms may suddenly produce striped ones, and\r\nthis too is to be taken as a sport, according to the usual conception of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nSuch sports may occur in different ways. Either by seeds, or by buds, or\r\neven within the single spikes. Both opposite reversions, [317] from\r\nstriped to red and from red to stripes, occur by seed, even by the\r\nstrictest exclusion of cross-fertilization. As far as my experiments go,\r\nthey are the rule, and parent-plants that do not give such reversions,\r\nat least in some of their offspring, are very rare, if not wholly\r\nwanting. Bud-variations and variations within the spike I have as yet\r\nonly observed on the striped individuals, and never on the red ones,\r\nthough I am confident that they might appear in larger series of\r\nexperiments. Both cases are more common on individuals with broad\r\nstripes than on plants bearing only the narrower red lines, as might be\r\nexpected, but even on the almost purely yellow individuals they may be\r\nseen from time to time. Bud-variations produce branches with spikes of\r\nuniform red flowers. Every bud of the plant seems to have equal chances\r\nto be transformed in this way. Some striped racemes bear a few red\r\nflowers, which ordinarily are inserted on one side of the spike only. As\r\nthey often cover a sharply defined section of the raceme, this\r\ncircumstance has given rise to the term of sectional variability to\r\ncover such cases. Sometimes the section is demarcated on the axis of the\r\nflower-spike by a brownish or reddish color, sharply contrasting with\r\nthe green hue of the remaining parts. Sectional variation may be looked\r\nat as a [318] special type of bud-variation, and from this point of view\r\nwe may simplify our inquiry and limit ourselves to the inheritance of\r\nthree types, the striped plants, the red plants and the red asexual\r\nvariants of the striped individuals. In each case the heredity should be\r\nobserved not only for one, but at least for two successive generations.\r\n\r\nLeaving these introductory remarks I now come at once to the\r\ngenealogical tree, as it may be deduced from my experiments:\r\n\r\n   Year\r\n   1896                 95% Striped            84% Red\r\n                             |                    |\r\n   1895               Striped Individual      Red Indiv.\r\n                                    \\        /\r\n   1895         98% Striped           71% Red\r\n                   |                     |\r\n   1894    Striped branches.      Red branches.\r\n                           \\      /\r\n   1894                  98% Striped               76% Red\r\n                              |                       |\r\n   1893                 90% Striped Indiv.      10% Red Indiv.\r\n                                         \\      /\r\n   1892                              Striped Individual\r\n\r\nThis experiment was begun in the year 1892 with one individual out of a\r\nlarge lot of striped plants grown from seeds which I had purchased from\r\na firm in Erfurt. The capsules were gathered separately from this\r\nindividual and about 40 flowering plants were obtained from the seeds in\r\nthe following year. Most of them had neatly striped flowers, some\r\ndisplayed broader stripes and spare flowers were seen with one [319]\r\nhalf wholly red. Four individuals were found with only uniform red\r\nflowers. These were isolated and artificially pollinated, and the same\r\nwas done with some of the best striped individuals. The seeds from every\r\nparent were sown separately, so as to allow the determination of the\r\nproportion of uniform red individuals in the progeny.\r\n\r\nNeither group was constant in its offspring. But as might be expected,\r\nthe type of the parent plant prevailed in both groups, and more strongly\r\nso in the instances with the striped, than with the red ones. Or, in\r\nother words seed-reversions were more numerous among the already\r\nreverted reds than among the striped type itself. I counted 2% reversion\r\nin the latter case, but 24% from the red parents.\r\n\r\nAmong the striped plants from the striped parents, I found some that\r\nproduced bud variations. I succeeded in isolating these red flowering\r\nbranches in paper bags and in pollinating them with their own pollen,\r\nand subjected the striped spikes of the same individuals to a similar\r\ntreatment. Three individuals gave a sufficient harvest from both types,\r\nand these six lots of seeds were sown separately. The striped flowers\r\nrepeated their character in 98% of their offspring, the red twigs in\r\nonly 71%, the [320] remaining individuals sporting into the opposite\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nIn the following year I continued the experiment with the seeds of the\r\noffspring of the red bud-variations. The striped individuals gave 95%,\r\nbut in the red ones only 84% of the progeny remained true to the parent\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it is manifest that the red and striped types differ\r\nfrom one another not only in their visible attributes, but also in the\r\ndegree of their heredity. The striped individuals repeat their\r\npeculiarity in 90-98% of their progeny, 2-10% sporting into the uniform\r\nred color. On the other hand the red individuals are constant in 71-84%\r\nof their offspring, while 16-29% go over to the striped type. Or,\r\nbriefly, both types are inherited to a high degree, but the striped type\r\nis more strictly inherited than the red one.\r\n\r\nMoreover the figures show that the degree of inheritance is not\r\ncontingent upon the question as to how the sport may have arisen.\r\nBud-sports show the same degree of inheritance as seed-sports. Sexual\r\nand asexual variability therefore seem to be one and the same process in\r\nthis instance. But the deeper meaning of this and other special features\r\nof our genealogical tree are still awaiting further investigation. It\r\nseems that much important evidence might [321] come from an extension of\r\nthis line of work. Perhaps it might even throw some light on the\r\nintimate nature of the bud-variations of ever-sporting varieties in\r\ngeneral. Sectional variations remain to be tested as to the degree of\r\ninheritance exhibited, and the different occurrences as to the breadth\r\nof the streaks require similar treatment.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary horticultural practice it is desirable to give some\r\nguarantee as to what may be expected to come from the seeds of brightly\r\nstriped flowers. Neither the pure red type, nor the nearly yellow\r\nracemes are the object of the culture, as both of them may be had pure\r\nfrom their, own separate varieties. In order to insure proper striping,\r\nboth extremes are usually rejected and should be rooted out as soon as\r\nthe flowering period begins. Similarly the broad-striped ones should be\r\nrejected, as they give a too large amount of uniform red flowers.\r\nClearly, but not broadly striped individuals always yield the most\r\nreliable seed.\r\n\r\nSumming up once more the results of our pedigree-experiment, we may\r\nassert that the striped variety of the snapdragon is wholly permanent,\r\nincluding the two opposite types of uniform color and of stripes. It\r\nmust have been so since it first originated from the invariable uniform\r\n[322] varieties, about the middle of the last century, in the nursery of\r\nMessrs. Vilmorin, and probably it will remain so as long as popular\r\ntaste supports its cultivation. It has never been observed to transgress\r\nits limits or to sport into varieties without reversions or sports. It\r\nfluctuates from one extreme to the other yearly, always recurring in the\r\nfollowing year, or even in the same summer by single buds. Highly\r\nvariable within its limits, it is absolutely constant or permanent, when\r\nconsidered as a definite group.\r\n\r\nSimilar cases occur not rarely among cultivated plants. In the wild\r\nstate they seem to be wholly wanting. Neither are they met with as\r\noccasional anomalies nor as distinct varieties. On the contrary, many\r\ngarden-flowers that are colored in the species, and besides this have a\r\nwhite or yellow variety, have also striped sorts. The oldest instance is\r\nprobably the marvel of Peru, _Mirabilis Jalappa_, which already had more\r\nthan one striped variety at the time of its introduction from Peru into\r\nthe European gardens, about the beginning of the seventeenth century.\r\nStocks, liver-leaf (_Hepatica_), dame's violet (_Hesperis_), Sweet\r\nWilliam (_Dianthus barbatus_), and periwinkles (_Vinca minor_) seem to\r\nbe in the same condition, as their striped varieties were already quoted\r\n[323] by the writers of the same century. Tulips, hyacinths, _Cyclamen_,\r\n_Azalea_, _Camellia_, and even such types of garden-plants as the meadow\r\ncrane's-bill (_Geranium pratensev) have striped varieties. It is always\r\nthe red or blue color which occurs in stripes, the underlying ground\r\nbeing white or yellow, according to the presence or absence of the\r\nyellow in the original color mixture.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties are known to be permanent, coming true during long\r\nseries of successive generations. But very little is known concerning\r\nthe more minute details of their hereditary qualities. They come from\r\nseed, when this is taken from striped individuals, and thence revert\r\nfrom time to time to the corresponding monochromatic type. But whether\r\nthey would do so when self-fertilized, and whether the reversionary\r\nindividuals are always bound to return towards the center of the group\r\nor towards the opposite limit, remains to be investigated. Presumably\r\nthere is nowhere a real transgression of the limits, and never or only\r\nvery rarely and at long intervals of time a true production of another\r\nrace with other hereditary qualities.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy myself on these points, I made some\r\npedigree-cultures with the striped forms of dame's violet (_Hesperis\r\nmatronalis_) [324] and of _Clarkia pulchella_. Both of them are\r\never-sporting varieties. The experiments were conducted during five\r\ngenerations with the violet, and during four with the striped Clarkia,\r\nincluding the progeny of the striped and of the monochromatic red\r\noffspring of a primitive striped plant. I need not give the figures here\r\nfor the numerical relations between the different types of each group,\r\nand shall limit myself to the statement that they behaved in exactly the\r\nsame manner as the snapdragon.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to dwell a moment on the capacity of the individuals\r\nwith red flowers to reproduce the striped type among their offspring.\r\nFor it is manifest that this latter quality must have lain dormant in\r\nthem during their whole life. Darwin has already pointed out that when a\r\ncharacter of a grandparent, which is wanting in the progeny, reappears\r\nin the second generation, this quality must always be assumed to have\r\nbeen present though latent in the intermediate generation. To the many\r\ninstances given by him of such alternative inheritance, the\r\nmonochromatic reversionists of the striped varieties are to be added as\r\na new type. It is moreover, a very suggestive type, since the latency is\r\nmanifestly of quite another character than for instance in the case of\r\nMendelian hybrids, and probably more allied to those instances, [325]\r\nwhere secondary sexual marks, which are as a rule only evolved by one\r\nsex, are transferred to the offspring through the other.\r\n\r\nStripes are by no means limited to flowers. They may affect the whole\r\nfoliage, or the fruits and the seeds, and even the roots. But all such\r\ncases occur much more rarely than the striped flowers. An interesting\r\ninstance of striped roots is afforded by radishes. White and red\r\nvarieties of different shapes are cultivated. Besides them sometimes a\r\ncurious motley sort may be seen in the markets, which is white with red\r\nspots, which are few and narrow in some samples, and more numerous and\r\nbroader in others. But what is very peculiar and striking is the\r\ncircumstance, that these stripes do not extend in a longitudinal, but in\r\na transverse direction. Obviously this must be the effect of the very\r\nnotable growth in thickness. Assuming that the colored regions were\r\nsmall in the beginning, they must have been drawn out during the process\r\nof thickening of the root, and changed into transverse lines. Rarely a\r\nstreak may have had its greatest extension in a transverse direction\r\nfrom the beginning, in which case it would only be broadened and not\r\ndefinitely changed in its direction.\r\n\r\nThis variety being a very fine one, and more agreeable to the eye than\r\nthe uniform colors, is [326] being more largely cultivated in some\r\ncountries. It has one great drawback: it never comes wholly true from\r\nseed. It may be grown in full isolation, and carefully selected, all red\r\nor nearly monochromatic samples being rooted out long before blooming,\r\nbut nevertheless the seed will always produce some red roots. The most\r\ncareful selection, pursued through a number of years, has not been\r\nsufficient to get rid of this regular occurrence of reversionary\r\nindividuals. Seed-growers receive many complaints from their clients on\r\nthis account, but they are not able to remove the difficulty. This\r\nexperience is in full agreement with the experimental evidence given by\r\nthe snapdragon, and it would certainly be very interesting to make a\r\ncomplete pedigree-culture with the radishes to test definitely their\r\ncompliance with the rules observed for striped flowers.\r\n\r\nHorticulturists in such cases are in the habit of limiting themselves to\r\nthe sale of so-called mixed seeds. From these no client expects purity,\r\nand the normal and hereditary diversity of types is here in some sense\r\nconcealed under the impurities included in the mixture from lack of\r\nselection. Such cases invite scrutiny, and would, no doubt, with the\r\nmethods of isolation, artificial pollination, and the sowing of the\r\nseeds separately from each parent, yield [327] results of great\r\nscientific value. Any one who has a garden, and sufficient perseverance\r\nto make pure cultures during a series of years might make important\r\ncontributions to scientific knowledge in this way.\r\n\r\nChoice might be made from among a wide range of different types. A\r\nvariety of corn called \"Harlequin\" shows stripes on its kernels, and one\r\near may offer nearly white and nearly red seeds and all the possible\r\nintermediate steps between them. From these seeds the next generation\r\nwill repeat the motley ears, but some specimens will produce ears of\r\nuniform kernels of a dark purple, showing thus the ordinary way of\r\nreversion. Some varieties of beans have spotted seeds, and among a lot\r\nof them one may be sure to find some purely red ones. It remains to be\r\ninvestigated what will be their offspring, and whether they are due to\r\npartial or to individual variation.\r\n\r\nThe cockscomb (_Celosia cristata_) has varieties of nearly all colors\r\nfrom white and yellow to red and orange, and besides them some striped\r\nvarieties occur in our gardens, with the stripes going from the lower\r\nparts of the stem up to the very crest of the comb. They are on sale as\r\nconstant varieties, but nothing has as yet been recorded concerning\r\ntheir peculiar behavior in the inheritance of the stripes. [328] Striped\r\ngrapes, apples and other fruits might be mentioned in this connection.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the striped varieties, attention is called to an\r\ninteresting deduction, which probably gives an explanation of one of the\r\nmost widely known instances of ever-sporting garden plants. Striped\r\nraces always include two types. Both of them are fertile, and each of\r\nthem reproduces in its offspring both its own and the alternate type. It\r\nis like a game of ball, in which the opposing parties always return the\r\nball. But now suppose that only one of the types were fertile and the\r\nother for some reason wholly sterile, and assume the reversionary, or\r\nprimitive monochromatic individuals to be fertile, and the derivative\r\nstriped specimens to bloom without seed. If this were the case,\r\nknowledge concerning the hereditary qualities would be greatly limited.\r\nIn fact the whole pedigree would be reduced to a monochromatic strain,\r\nwhich would in each generation sport in some individuals into the\r\nstriped variety. But, being sterile, they would not be able to propagate\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSuch seems to be the case with the double flowered stocks. Their double\r\nflowers produce neither stamens nor pistils, and as each individual is\r\neither double or single in all its flowers, the doubles are wholly\r\ndestitute of seed. [329] Nevertheless, they are only reproduced by seed\r\nfrom single flowers, being an annual or biennial species.\r\n\r\nStocks are a large family, and include a wonderful variety of colors,\r\nranging from white and yellow to purple and red, and with some\r\nvariations toward blue. They exhibit also diversity in the habit of\r\ngrowth. Some are annuals, including the ten-week and pyramidal forms;\r\nothers are intermediates and are suitable for pot-culture; and the\r\nbiennial sorts include the well-known \"Brompton\" and \"Queen\" varieties.\r\nSome are large and others are small or dwarf. For their brightness,\r\ndurability and fragrance, they are deservedly popular. There are even\r\nsome striped varieties. Horticulturists and amateurs generally know that\r\nseed can be obtained from single stocks only, and that the double\r\nflowers never produce any. It is not difficult to choose single plants\r\nthat will produce a large percentage of double blossoms in the following\r\ngeneration. But only a percentage, for the experiments of the most\r\nskilled growers have never enabled them to save seed, which would result\r\nentirely in double flowering plants. Each generation in its turn is a\r\nmotley assembly of singles and doubles.\r\n\r\nBefore looking closer into the hereditary peculiarities of this old and\r\ninteresting ever-sporting [330] variety, it may be as well to give a\r\nshort description of the plants with double flowers. Generally speaking\r\nthere are two principal types of doubles. One is by the conversion of\r\nstamens into petals, and the other is an anomaly, known under the name\r\nof _petalomany_.\r\n\r\nThe change of stamens into petals is a gradual modification. All\r\nintermediate steps are easily to be found. In some flowers all stamens\r\nmay be enlarged, in others only part of them. Often the broadened\r\nfilaments bear one or two fertile anthers. The fertility is no doubt\r\ndiminished, but not wholly destroyed. Individual specimens may occur,\r\nwhich cannot produce any seed, but then others of the same lot may be as\r\nfertile as can be desired. As a whole, such double varieties are\r\nregularly propagated by seed.\r\n\r\nPetalomany is the tendency of the axis of some flowers never to make any\r\nstamens or pistils, not even in altered or rudimentary form. Instead of\r\nthese, they simply continue producing petals, going on with this\r\nproduction without any other limit than the supply of available food.\r\nNumerous petals fill the entire space within the outer rays, and in the\r\nheart of the flower innumerable young ones are developed half-way, not\r\nobtaining food enough to attain [331] full size. Absolute sterility is\r\nthe natural consequence of this state of things.\r\n\r\nHence it is impossible to have races of petalomanous types. If the\r\nabnormality happens to show itself in a species, which normally\r\npropagates itself in an asexual way, the type may become a vegetative\r\nvariety, and be multiplied by bulbs, buds or cuttings, etc. Some\r\ncultivated anemones and crowfoots (_Ranunculus_) are of this character,\r\nand even the marsh-marigold (_Caltha palustris_) has a petalomanous\r\nvariety. I once found in a meadow such a form of the meadow-buttercup\r\n(_Ranunculus_ acris_), and succeeded in keeping it in my garden for\r\nseveral years, but it did not make seeds and finally died. Camellias are\r\nknown to have both types of double flowers. The petalomanous type is\r\nhighly regular in structure, so much so as to be too uniform in all its\r\nparts to be pleasing, while the conversion of stamens into petals in the\r\nalternative varieties gives to these flowers a more lively diversity of\r\nstructure. Lilies have a variety called _Lilium candidum flore pleno_,\r\nin which the flowers seem to be converted into a long spike of bright,\r\nwhite narrow bracts, crowded on an axis which never seems to cease their\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly impossible to decide how all such sterile double\r\nflowers have originated. [332] Perhaps each of them originally had a\r\ncongruent single-flowered form, from which it was produced by seed in\r\nthe same way as the double stocks now are yearly. If this assumption is\r\nright, the corresponding fertile line is now lost; it has perhaps died\r\nout, or been masked. But it is not absolutely impossible that such\r\nstrains might one day be discovered for one or another of these now\r\nsterile varieties.\r\n\r\nReturning to the stocks we are led to the conception that some varieties\r\nare absolutely single, while others consist of both single-flowered and\r\ndouble-flowered individuals. The single varieties are in respect to this\r\ncharacter true to the original wild type. They never give seed which\r\nresults in doubles, providing all intercrossing is excluded. The other\r\nvarieties are ever-sporting, in the sense of this term previously\r\nassumed, but with the restriction that the sports are exclusively\r\none-sided, and never return, owing to their absolute sterility.\r\n\r\nThe oldest double varieties of stocks have attained an age of a century\r\nand more. During all this time they have had a continuous pedigree of\r\nfertile and single-flowered individuals, throwing off in each generation\r\na definite number of doubles. This ratio is not at all dependent on\r\nchance or accident, nor is it even variable to a remarkable degree.\r\nQuite on the contrary [333] it is always the same, or nearly the same,\r\nand it is to be considered as an inherent quality of the race. If left\r\nto themselves, the single individuals always produce singles and doubles\r\nin the same quantity; if cultivated after some special method, the\r\nproportion may be slightly changed, bringing the proportion of doubles\r\nup to 60% or even more.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the single and double members of such a race are quite equal\r\nin the remainder of their attributes, especially in the color of their\r\nflowers. But this is not always the case. The colors of such a race may\r\nrepeat for themselves the peculiarities of the ever-sporting characters.\r\nIt often happens that one color is more or less strictly allied to the\r\ndoubles, and another to the singles. This sometimes makes it difficult\r\nto keep the various colors true. There are certain sorts, which\r\ninvariably exhibit a difference in color between the single and the\r\ndouble flowers. The sulphur-yellow varieties may be adduced as\r\nillustrative examples, because in them the single flowers always come\r\nwhite. Hence in saving seed, it is impossible so to select the plant,\r\nthat an occasional white does not also appear among the double flowers,\r\nagreeing in this deviation with the general rule of the eversporting\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nI commend all the above instances to those [334] who wish to make\r\npedigree-cultures. The cooperation of many is needed to bring about any\r\nnotable advancement, since the best way to secure isolation is to\r\nrestrict one's self to the culture of one strain, so as to avoid the\r\nintermixture of others. So many facts remain doubtful and open to\r\ninvestigation, that almost any lot of purchased seed may become the\r\nstarting point for interesting researches. Among these the\r\nsulphur-yellow varieties should be considered in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the great questions of heredity, the stocks offer many\r\npoints of interest. Some of these features I will now try to describe,\r\nin order to show what still remains to be done, and in what manner the\r\nstocks may clear the way for the study of the ever-sporting varieties.\r\n\r\nThe first point, is the question, which seeds become double-flowered and\r\nwhich single-flowered plants? Beyond all doubt, the determination has\r\ntaken place before the ripening of the seed. But though the color of the\r\nseed is often indicative of the color of the flowers, as in some red or\r\npurple varieties, and though in balsams and some other instances the\r\nmost \"highly doubled\" flowers are to be obtained from the biggest and\r\nplumpest seeds, no such rule seems to exist respecting the double\r\nstocks. Now if one half of the seeds gives doubles, and [335] the other\r\nhalf singles, the question arises, where are the singles and the doubles\r\nto be found on the parent-plant?\r\n\r\nThe answer is partly given by the following experiment. Starting from\r\nthe general rule of the great influence of nutrition on variability, it\r\nmay be assumed that those seeds will give most doubles, that are best\r\nfed. Now it is manifest that the stem and larger branches are, in a\r\nbetter condition than the smaller twigs, and that likewise the first\r\nfruits have better chances than the ones formed later. Even in the same\r\npod the uppermost seeds will be in a comparatively disadvantageous\r\nposition. This conception leads to an experiment which is the basis of a\r\npractical method much used in France in order to get a higher percentage\r\nof seeds of double-flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThis method consists in cutting off, in the first place the upper parts\r\nof all the larger spikes, in the second place, the upper third part of\r\neach pod, and lastly all the small and weak twigs. In doing so the\r\npercentage is claimed to go up to 67-70%, and in some instances even\r\nhigher. This operation is to be performed as soon as the required number\r\nof flowers have ceased blossoming. All the nutrient materials, destined\r\nfor the seeds, are now forced to flow into these relatively few embryos,\r\nand it is clear that [336] they will be far better nourished than if no\r\noperation were made.\r\n\r\nIn order to control this experiment some breeders have made the\r\noperation on the fruits when ripe, instead of on the young pods, and\r\nhave saved the seeds from the upper parts separately. This seed,\r\nproduced in abundance, was found to be very poor in double flowers,\r\ncontaining only some 20-30%. On the contrary the percentage of doubles\r\nin the seed of the lower parts was somewhat augmented, and the average\r\nof both would have given the normal proportion of 50%.\r\n\r\nOpposed to the French method is the German practice of cultivating\r\nstocks, as I have seen it used on a very large scale at Erfurt and at\r\nother places. The stocks are grown in pots on small scaffolds, and not\r\nput on or into the earth. The obvious aim of this practice is to keep\r\nthe earth in the pots dry, and accordingly they are only scantily\r\nwatered. In consequence they cannot develop as fully as they would have\r\ndone when planted directly in the beds, and they produce only small\r\nracemes and no weak twigs, eliminating thereby without further operation\r\nthe weaker seeds as by the French method. The effect is increased by\r\nplanting from 6-10 separate plants in each pot.\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to make comparative [337] trials of both\r\nmethods, in order to discover the true relation between the practice and\r\nthe results reached. Bath should also be compared with cultures on open\r\nplots, which are said to give only 50% of doubles. This last method of\r\nculture is practiced wherever it is desired to produce great quantities\r\nof seeds at a low cost. Such trials would no doubt give an insight into\r\nthe relations of hereditary characters to the distribution of the food\r\nwithin the plant.\r\n\r\nA second point is the proportional increase of the double-flowering\r\nseeds with age. If seed is kept for two or three years, the greater part\r\nof the grains will gradually die, and among the remainder there is found\r\non sowing, a higher percentage of double ones. Hence we may infer that\r\nthe single-flowered seeds are shorter lived than the doubles, and this\r\nobviously points to a greater weakness of the first. It is quite evident\r\nthat there is some common cause for these facts and for the above cited\r\nexperience, that the first and best pods give more doubles. Much,\r\nhowever, remains to be investigated before a satisfactory answer can be\r\nmade to these questions.\r\n\r\nA third point is the curious practice, called by the French \"esimpler,\"\r\nand which consists in pulling out the singles when very young. It seems\r\nto be done at an age when the flower-buds [338] are not yet visible, or\r\nat least are not far enough developed to show the real distinctive\r\nmarks. Children may be employed to choose and destroy the singles. There\r\nare some slight differences in the fullness and roundness of the buds\r\nand the pubescence of the young leaves. Moreover the buds of the doubles\r\nare said to be sweeter to the taste than those of the singles. But as\r\nyet I have not been able to ascertain, whether any scientific\r\ninvestigation of this process has ever been made, though according to\r\nsome communications made to me by the late Mr. Cornu, the practice seems\r\nto be very general in the environs of Paris. In summer large fields may\r\nbe seen, bearing exclusively double flowers, owing to the weeding out of\r\nthe singles long before flowering.\r\n\r\nBud-variation is the last point to be taken up. It seems to be very rare\r\nwith stocks, but some instances have been recorded in literature. Darwin\r\nmentions a double stock with a branch bearing single flowers, and other\r\ncases are known to have occurred. But in no instance does the seed of\r\nsuch a bud-variant seem to have been saved. Occasionally other\r\nreversions also occur. From time to time specimens appear with more\r\nluxurious growth and with divergent instead of erect pods. They are\r\ncalled, in Erfurt, \"generals\" on account [339] of their stiff and erect\r\nappearance, and they are marked by more divergent horns crowning the\r\npods. They are said to produce only a relatively small number of doubles\r\nfrom their seeds, and even this small number might be due to\r\nfertilization with pollen of their neighbors. I saw some of these\r\nreversionary types; when inspecting the nurseries of Erfurt, but as they\r\nare, as a rule, thrown out before ripening their seed, nothing is\r\nexactly known about their real hereditary qualities.\r\n\r\nMuch remains to be cleared up, but it seems that one of the best means\r\nto find a way through the bewildering maze of the phenomena of\r\ninheritance, is to make groups of related forms and to draw conclusions\r\nfrom a comparison of the members of such groups. Such comparisons must\r\nobviously give rise to questions, which in their turn will directly lead\r\nto experimental investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[340]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XII\r\n\r\nFIVE-LEAVED CLOVER\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the \"four-leaved\" clover. It is occasionally found on\r\nlawns, in pastures and by the roadsides. Specimens with five leaflets\r\nmay be found now and then in the same place, or on the same plant, but\r\nthese are rarer. I have often seen isolated plants with quaternate\r\nleaves, but only rarely have I observed individuals with more than one\r\nsuch leaf.\r\n\r\nThe two cases are essentially dissimilar. They may appear to differ but\r\nlittle morphologically, but from the point of view of heredity they are\r\nquite different. Isolated quaternate leaves are of but little interest,\r\nwhile the occurrence of many on the same individual indicates a distinct\r\nvariety. In making experiments upon this point it is necessary to\r\ntransplant the divergent individuals to a garden in order to furnish\r\nthem proper cultural conditions and to keep them under constant\r\nobservation. When a plant bearing a quaternate leaf is thus transplanted\r\nhowever, it rarely repeats the [341] anomaly. But when plants with two\r\nor more quaternate leaves on the same individual are chosen it indicates\r\nthat it belongs to a definite race, which under suitable conditions may\r\nprove to become very rich in the anomalies in question.\r\n\r\nObviously it is not always easy to decide definitely whether a given\r\nindividual belongs to such a race or not. Many trials may be necessary\r\nto secure the special race. I had the good fortune to find two plants of\r\nclover, bearing one quinate and several quaternate leaves, on an\r\nexcursion in the neighborhood of Loosdrecht in Holland. After\r\ntransplanting them into my garden, I cultivated them during three years\r\nand observed a slowly increasing number of anomalous leaves. This number\r\nin one summer amounted to 46 quaternate and 16 quinate leaves, and it\r\nwas evident that I had secured an instance of the rare \"five-leaved\"\r\nrace which I am about to describe.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so it seems desirable to look somewhat closer into the\r\nmorphological features of the problem. Pinnate and palmate leaves often\r\nvary in the number of their parts. This variability is generally of the\r\nnature of a common fluctuation, the deviations grouping themselves\r\naround an average type in the ordinary way. Ash leaves bear five pairs,\r\nand [342] the mountain-ash (_Sorbus Aucuparia_) has six pairs of\r\nleaflets in addition to the terminal one. But this number varies\r\nslightly, the weaker leaves having less, the stronger more pairs than\r\nthe average. Such however, is not the case, with ternate leaves, which\r\nseem to be quite constant. Four leaflets occur so very rarely that one\r\nseems justified in regarding them rather as an anomaly than, as a\r\nfluctuation. And this is confirmed by the almost universal absence of\r\ntwo-bladed clover-leaves.\r\n\r\nConsidering the deviation as an anomaly, we may look into its nature.\r\nSuch an inquiry shows that the supernumerary leaflets owe their origin\r\nto a splitting of one or more of the normal ones. This splitting is not\r\nterminal, as is often the case with other species, and as it may be seen\r\nsometimes in the clover. It is for the most part lateral. One of the\r\nlateral nerves grows out becoming a median nerve of the new leaflet.\r\nIntermediate steps are not wanting, though rare, and they show a gradual\r\nseparation of some lateral part of a leaflet, until this division\r\nreaches the base and divides the leaflet into two almost equal parts. If\r\nthis splitting occurs in one leaflet we get the \"four-leaved\" Clover, if\r\nit occurs in two there will be five leaflets. And if, besides this, the\r\nterminal leaflet produces a derivative on one or both of its sides,\r\n[343] we obtain a crown of six or seven leaflets on one stalk. Such were\r\noften met with in the race I had under cultivation, but as a rule it did\r\nnot exceed this limit.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomenon of a lateral doubling of leaflets may of course be\r\nmet with in other instances. The common laburnum has a variety which\r\noften produces quaternate and quinate leaves, and in strawberries I have\r\nalso seen instances of this abnormality. It occurs also in pinnate\r\nleaves, and complete sets of all the intermediate links may often be\r\nfound on the false or bastard-acacia (_Robinia Pseud_Acacia_).\r\n\r\nOpposed to this increase of the number of leaflets, and still more rare\r\nand more curious is the occurrence of \"single-leaved\" varieties among\r\ntrees and herbs with pinnate or ternate leaves. Only very few instances\r\nhave been described, and are cultivated in gardens. The ashes and the\r\nbastard-acacia may be quoted among trees, and the \"one-leaved\"\r\nstrawberry among herbs. Here it seems that several leaflets have been\r\ncombined into one, since this one is, as a rule, much larger than the\r\nterminal leaflet of an ordinary leaf of the same species. These\r\nmonophyllous varieties are interesting also on account of their\r\ncontinuous but often incomplete reversion to the normal type.\r\n\r\n[344] Pinnate and palmate leaves are no doubt derivative types. They\r\nmust have originated from the ordinary simple leaf. The monophylly may\r\ntherefore be considered as a reversion to a more primitive state and the\r\nmonophyllous varieties may be called atavistic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we have seen that these atavistic varieties may revert\r\nto their nearest progenitors, and this leads to the curious conception\r\nof positive and negative atavism. For if the change of compound leaves\r\ninto single ones is a retrograde or negative step, the conversion of\r\nsingle or ternate leaves into pinnate and palmate ones must evidently be\r\nconsidered in this case as positive atavism.\r\n\r\nThis discussion seems to throw some light on the increase of leaflets in\r\nthe clover. The pea family, or the group of papilionaceous plants, has\r\npinnate leaves ordinarily, which, according to our premises, must be\r\nconsidered as a derivative type. In the clovers and their allies this\r\ntype reverts halfway to the single form, producing only three leaflets\r\non each stalk. If now the clover increases its number of leaflets, this\r\nmay be considered as a reversion to its nearest progenitors, the\r\npapilionaceous plants with pinnate leaves. Hence a halfway returning and\r\ntherefore positive atavism. And as I have already mentioned in a former\r\nlecture, pinnate [345] leaves are also sometimes produced by my new race\r\nof clover.\r\n\r\nReturning to the original plants of this race, it is evidently\r\nimpossible to decide whether they were really the beginning of a new\r\nstrain, and had originated themselves by some sudden change from the\r\ncommon type, or whether they belonged to an old variety, which had\r\npropagated itself perhaps during centuries, unobserved by man. But the\r\nsame difficulty generally arises when new varieties are discovered. Even\r\nthe behavior of the plants themselves or of their progeny does not\r\nafford any means of deciding the question. The simplest way of stating\r\nthe matter therefore, is to say that I accidentally found two\r\nindividuals of the \"five-leaved\" race. By transplanting them into my\r\ngarden, I have isolated them and kept them free from cross-fertilization\r\nwith the ordinary type. Moreover, I have brought them under such\r\nconditions as are necessary for the full development of their\r\ncharacters. And last but not least, I have tried to improve this\r\ncharacter as far as possible by a very rigid and careful selection.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this effort has been a rapid improvement of my strain.\r\nI saved the seed of the original plants in 1889 and cultivated the\r\nsecond generation in the following year. It [346] showed some increase\r\nof the anomaly, but not to a very remarkable degree. In the flowering\r\nperiod I selected four plants with the largest number of quaternate and\r\nquinate leaves and destroyed all the others. I counted in the average 25\r\nanomalous organs on each of them. From their seed I raised the third\r\ngeneration of my culture in the year 1891.\r\n\r\nThis generation included some 300 plants, on which above 8,000 leaves\r\nwere counted. More than 1,000 were quaternate or quinate, the ternate\r\nleaves being still in the majority. But the experiment clearly showed\r\nthat \"four-leaved\" clovers may be produced in any desired quantity,\r\nprovided that the seed of the variety is available. In the summer only\r\nthree, four and five leaflets on one stalk were seen, but towards the\r\nfall, and after the selection of the best individuals, this number\r\nincreased and came up to six and seven in some rare instances.\r\n\r\nThe selection in this year was by no means easy. Nearly all the\r\nindividuals produced at least some quaternate leaves, and thereby showed\r\nthe variety to be quite pure. I counted the abnormal organs on a large\r\ngroup of the best plants, and selected 20 excellent specimens from them,\r\nwith more than one-third of all their leaves changed in the desired\r\nmanner. Having brought my race up to this point, I [347] was able to\r\nintroduce a new and far more easy mark, afforded by the seedlings, for\r\nmy selections. This mark has since remained constant, and has brought\r\nabout a rapid continuance of the improvement, without necessitating such\r\nlarge cultures.\r\n\r\nThis seedling in the various species of clover usually begins with a\r\nfirst leaf above the cotyledons of a different structure from those that\r\nfollow. It has only one blade instead of three. But in my variety the\r\nincrease of the number of the leaflets may extend to these primary\r\norgans, and make them binate or even ternate. Now it is obvious that an\r\nindividual, which begins with a divided primary leaf, will have a\r\ngreater tendency to produce a large number of supernumerary leaflets\r\nthan a plant which commences in the ordinary way. Or in other words, the\r\nprimary leaves afford a sure criterion for the selection, and this\r\nselection may be made in the seed-pans. In consequence, no young\r\nindividual with an undivided primary leaf was planted out. Choosing the\r\n20 or 30 best specimens in the seed-pan, no further selection was\r\nrequired, and the whole lot could be left to cross-fertilization by\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe observation of this distinguishing mark in the young seedlings has\r\nled to the discovery of another quality as a starting-paint for further\r\n[348] selection. According to the general rule of pedigree-culture, the\r\nseeds of each individual plant are always saved and sowed separately.\r\nThis is done even with such species as the clover, which are infertile\r\nwhen self-pollinated, and which are incapable of artificial pollination\r\non the required scale, since each flower produces only one seed. My\r\nclover was always left free to be pollinated by insects. Obviously this\r\nmust have led to a diminution of the differentiating characters of the\r\nindividual plants. But this does not go far enough to obliterate the\r\ndifferences, and the selection made among the seedlings will always\r\nthrow out at least a large part of those that have suffered from the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nLeaving this discussion, we may inquire closer into the nature of the\r\nnew criterion afforded by the seedlings. Two methods present themselves.\r\nFirst, the choice of the best seedlings. In the second place it becomes\r\npossible to compare the parent-plants by counting the number of\r\ndeviating seedlings. This leads to the establishment of a percentage for\r\nevery single parent, and gives data for comparisons. Two or three\r\nhundreds of seeds from a parent may easily be grown in one pan, and in\r\nthis way a sufficiently high degree of accuracy may be reached. Only\r\nthose parents that give [349] the highest percentage are chosen, and\r\namong their progeny only the seedlings with trifoliolate primary leaves\r\nare planted out. The whole procedure of the selection is by this means\r\nconfined to the glasshouse during the spring, and the beds need not be\r\nlarge, nor do they require any special care during the summer.\r\n\r\nBy this method I brought my strain within two years up to an average of\r\nnearly 90% of the seedlings with a divided primary leaf. Around this\r\naverage the real numbers fluctuated between the maximum of 99% and the\r\nminimum of 70% or thereabouts. This condition was reached by the sixth\r\ngeneration in the year 1894, and has since proved to be the limit, the\r\ngroup of figures remaining practically the same during all the\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\nSuch selected plants are very rich in leaves with four, five and six\r\nblades. Excluding the small leaves at the tops of the branches, and\r\nthose on the numerous weaker side-branches, these three groups include\r\nthe large majority of all the stronger leaves. In summer the range is\r\nwider, and besides many trifoliolate leaves the curiously shaped\r\nseven-bladed ones are not at all rare. In the fall and in the winter the\r\nrange of variability is narrowed, and at first sight the plants often\r\nseem to bear only quinquefoliolate leaves.\r\n\r\n[350] I have cultivated a new generation of this race nearly every year\r\nsince 1894, using always the strictest selection. This has led to a\r\nuniform type, but has not been adequate to produce any further\r\nimprovement. Obviously the extreme limit, under the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil, has been reached. This extreme type is always\r\ndependent upon repeated selection. No constant variety, in the older\r\nsense, has been obtained, nor was any indication afforded that such a\r\ntype might ever be produced. On the contrary, it is manifest that the\r\nnew form belongs to the group of ever-sporting varieties. It is never\r\nquite free from the old atavistic type of the trifoliolate leaves, and\r\ninvariably, when external conditions become less favorable, this\r\natavistic form is apt to gain dominion over the more refined varietal\r\ncharacter. Reversions always occur, both partial and individual.\r\n\r\nSome instances of these reversions may now be given. They are not of\r\nsuch a striking character as those of the snapdragon. Intermediate steps\r\nare always occurring, both in the leaves themselves, and in the\r\npercentages of deviating seedlings of the several parent plants.\r\n\r\nOn normal plants of my variety the quinquefoliolate leaves usually\r\ncompose the majority, when there are no weak lateral branches, or when\r\nthey are left out of consideration. Next [351] to these come the fours\r\nand the sixes, while the trifoliolate and seven-bladed types are nearly\r\nequal in number. But out of a lot of plants, grown from seed of the same\r\nparent, it is often possible to choose some in which one extreme\r\nprevails, and others with a preponderating number of leaves with the\r\nother extreme number of leaflets. If seed from these extremes are saved\r\nseparately, one strain, that with numerous seven-bladed leaves will\r\nremain true to the type, but the other will diverge more or less,\r\nproducing leaves with a varying number of subdivisions.\r\n\r\nVery few generations of such opposite selection are required to reduce\r\nthe race to an utterly poor one. In three years I was able to nearly\r\nobliterate the type of my variety. I chose the seedlings with an\r\nundivided primary leaf, cultivated them and counted their offspring\r\nseparately after the sowing. I found some parents with only 2-3% of\r\nseedlings with divided primary leaves. And by a repeated selection in\r\nthis retrograde direction I succeeded in getting a great number of\r\nplants, which during the whole summer made only very few leaves with\r\nmore than three blades. But an absolute reversion could no more be\r\nreached in this direction than in the normal one. Any sowing without\r\nselection would be [352] liable to reduce the strain to an average\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe production of varietal and of atavistic leaves is dependent to a\r\nhigh degree on external conditions. It agrees with the general rule,\r\nthat favorable circumstances strengthen the varietal peculiarities,\r\nwhile unfavorable conditions increase the number of the parts with the\r\natavistic attribute. These influences may be seen to have their effect\r\non the single individuals, as well as on the generations growing from\r\ntheir seed. I cannot cite here all the experimental material, but a\r\nsingle illustrative example may be given. I divided a strong individual\r\ninto two parts, planted one in rich soil and the other in poor sand, and\r\nhad both pollinated by bees with the pollen of some normal individuals\r\nof my variety growing between them. The seeds of both were saved and\r\nsown separately, and the two lots of offspring cultivated close to each\r\nother under the same external conditions. In the beginning no difference\r\nwas seen, but as soon as the young plants had unfolded three or four\r\nleaves, the progeny of the better nourished half of the parent plant\r\nshowed a manifest advance. This difference increased rapidly and was\r\neasily seen in the beds, even before the flowering period.\r\n\r\nThis experience probably gives an explanation [353] why the\r\nquinquefoliolate variety is so seldom met with in the wild state. For\r\neven if it did occur more often, the plants would hardly find\r\ncircumstances favorable enough for the full development of their\r\nvarietal character. They must often be so poor in anomalous leaves as to\r\nbe overlooked, or to be taken for instances of the commonly occurring\r\nquadrifoliolate leaves and therefore as not indicating the true variety.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of my discussion I have asserted the existence of two\r\ndifferent races of \"four-leaved\" clovers, a poor one and a rich one, and\r\nhave insisted on a sharp distinction between them. This distinction\r\npartly depends on experiments with clover, but in great part on tests\r\nwith other plants. The previously mentioned circumstance, that clover\r\ncannot be pollinated on a sufficiently large scale otherwise than by\r\ninsects, prevents trials in more than one direction at the same time and\r\nin the same garden. For this reason I have chosen another species of\r\nclover to be able to give proof or disproof of the assertion quoted.\r\n\r\nThis species is the Italian, or crimson clover, which is sometimes also\r\ncalled scarlet clover (_Trifolium incarnatum_). It is commonly used in\r\nEurope as a crop on less fertile soils than are required by the red\r\nclover. It is annual [354] and erect and more or less hairy, and has\r\nstouter leaves than other kinds of clover. It has oblong or cylindrical\r\nheads with bright crimson flowers, and may be considered as one of the\r\nmost showy types. As an annual it has some manifest advantages over the\r\nperennial species, especially in giving its harvest of hay at other\r\nseasons of the year.\r\n\r\nI found some stray quaternate leaves of this plant some years ago, and\r\ntried to win from them, through culture and selection, a race that would\r\nbe as rich in these anomalies as the red clover. But the utmost care and\r\nthe most rigid selection, and all the attention I could afford, failed\r\nto produce any result. It is now ten years since I commenced this\r\nexperiment, and more than once I have been willing to give it up. Last\r\nyear (1903) I cultivated some hundreds of selected plants, but though\r\nthey yielded a few more instances of the desired anomaly than in the\r\nbeginning, no trace of a truly rich race could be discovered. The\r\nexperimental evidence of this failure shows at least that stray\r\n\"four-leaves\" may occur, which do not indicate the existence of a true\r\n\"four-\" or \"five-leaved\" variety.\r\n\r\nThis conception seems destined to become of great value in the\r\nappreciation of anomalies, as they are usually found, either in the wild\r\nstate [355] or in gardens. And before describing the details of my\r\nunsuccessful pedigree-culture, it may be as well to give some more\r\ninstances of what occurs in nature.\r\n\r\nStray anomalies are of course rare, but not so rare that they might not\r\nbe found in large numbers when perseveringly sought for. Pitcher-like\r\nleaves may be found on many trees and shrubs and herbs, but ordinarily\r\none or only two of them are seen in the course of many years on the same\r\nplant, or in the same strain. In some few instances they occur annually\r\nor nearly so, as in some individuals of the European lime-tree (_Tilia\r\nparvifolia_) and of the common magnolia (_Magnolia obovata_). Many of\r\nour older cultivated plants are very rich in anomalies of all kinds, and\r\n_Cyclamen_, _Fuchsia_, _Pelargonium_ and some others are notorious\r\nsources of teratologic phenomena. Deviations in flowers may often be\r\nseen, consisting of changes in the normal number of the several organs,\r\nor alterations in their shape and color. Leaves may have two tips,\r\ninstead of one, the mid-vein being split near the apex, and the fissure\r\nextending more or less towards the base. Rays of the umbels of\r\numbelliferous plants may grow together and become united in groups of\r\ntwo or more, and in the same way the fruits of [356] the composites may\r\nbe united into groups. Many other instances could easily be given.\r\n\r\nIf we select some of these anomalies for breeding-experiments, our\r\nresults will not agree throughout, but will tend to group themselves\r\nunder two heads. In some cases the isolation of the deviating\r\nindividuals will at once show the existence of a distinct variety, which\r\nis capable of producing the anomaly in any desired number of instances;\r\nonly dependent on a favorable treatment and a judicious selection. In\r\nother cases no treatment and no selection are adequate to give a similar\r\nresult, and the anomaly remains refractory despite all our endeavors to\r\nbreed it. The cockscomb and the peloric fox-glove are widely known\r\ninstances of permanent anomalies, and others will be dealt with in\r\nfuture lectures. On the other hand I have often tried in vain to win an\r\nanomalous race from an accidental deviation, or to isolate a teratologic\r\nvariety out of more common aberrations. Two illustrative examples may be\r\nquoted. In our next lecture we shall deal with a curious phenomenon in\r\npoppies, consisting in the change of the stamens into pistils and giving\r\nrise to a bright crown of secondary capsules around the central one.\r\nSimilar anomalies may be occasionally met with in other species of the\r\nsame genus. But they are rare, and may show [357] the conversion of only\r\na single stamen in the described manner. I observed this anomaly in a\r\npoppy called _Papaver commutatum_, and subjected it during several years\r\nto a rigid selection of the richest individuals. No amelioration was to\r\nbe gained and the culture had to be given up. In the same way I found on\r\nthe bulbous buttercup (_Ranunculus bulbosus_) a strain varying largely\r\nin the number of the petals, amounting often to 6-8, and in some flowers\r\neven yet to higher figures. During five succeeding years I cultivated\r\nfive generations, often in large numbers, selecting always those which\r\nhad the highest number of petals, throwing out the remainder and saving\r\nthe seed only from the very best plants. I got a strain of selected\r\nplants with an average number of nine petals in every flower, and found\r\namong 4,000 flowers four having 20 petals or more, coming up even to 31\r\nin one instance. But such rare instances had no influence whatever on\r\nthe selection, since they were not indicative of individual qualities,\r\nbut occurred quite accidentally on flowers of plants having only the\r\naverage number of petals. Now double flowers are widely known to occur\r\nin other species of the buttercups, both in the cultivated varieties and\r\nin some wild forms. For this reason it might be expected that through a\r\ncontinuous selection of [358] the individuals with the largest numbers a\r\ntendency to become double would be evolved. Such, however, was not the\r\ncase. No propensity to vary in any definite direction could be observed.\r\nQuite on the contrary, an average condition was quickly reached, and\r\nthen remained constant, strongly counteracting all selection.\r\n\r\nSuch experiences clearly show that the same anomaly may occur in\r\ndifferent species, and no doubt in strains of the same species from\r\ndifferent localities, according to at least two different standards. The\r\none is to be called the poor, and the other the rich variety. The first\r\nalways produces relatively few instances of the deviation, the last is\r\napt to give as many of them as desired. The first is only half-way a\r\nvariety, and therefore would deserve the name of a half-race; the second\r\nis not yet a full constant variety, but always fluctuates to and fro\r\nbetween the varietal and the specific mark, ever-sporting in both\r\ndirections. It holds a middle position between a half-race and a\r\nvariety, and therefore might be called a \"middle-race.\" But the term\r\never-sporting variety seems more adequate to convey a right idea of the\r\nnature of this curious type of inheritance.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion it will be seen that the behavior of the crimson\r\nclover is not to be considered [359] as an exception, but as a widely\r\noccurring type of phenomenon, occurring perhaps in all sorts of\r\nteratologic deviations, and in wide ranges of species and genera. Hence\r\nit may be considered worth while to give some more details of this\r\nextended experiment.\r\n\r\nTen years ago (1894-5) I bought and sowed about a pound of seed of the\r\ncrimson clover. Among many thousands of normal seedlings I found two\r\nwith three and one with four cotyledons. Trusting to the empirical rules\r\nof correlation, I transplanted these three individuals in order to\r\nisolate them in the flowering period.\r\n\r\nOne of them produced during the ensuing summer one four-bladed and one\r\nfive-bladed leaf. The seeds were saved separately and sown the following\r\nspring and the expected result could soon be seen. Among some 250\r\nindividual plants I counted 22 with one or two deviations, and 10 with\r\nfrom three to nine four- or five-bladed leaves. Proportions nearly\r\nsimilar have been observed repeatedly. Better nourished individuals have\r\nproduced more deviating leaves on one plant, partly owing to the larger\r\nnumber of stems and branches, and poor or average specimens have mostly\r\nbeen without any aberration or with only one or two abnormal leaves. No\r\nfurther improvement could be attained. Quadrifoliolate leaves were\r\nalways rare, never [360] attaining a number that would put its stamp on\r\na whole bed. I have endeavored to get some six- and seven-bladed crimson\r\nclover leaves, but in vain; selection, culture of many hundreds of\r\nindividuals, manure, and the best possible treatment has not been\r\nadequate to produce them. Of course I am quite convinced that a\r\nrepetition of my experiment on a far larger scale would yield the\r\ndesired types, but then only in such rare instances that they would have\r\nno influence whatever on the average, or on the improvement of the race.\r\nThe eighth generation in the year 1903 has not been noticeably better\r\nthan the second and third generations after the first selection.\r\n\r\nIn comparing this statement with the results gained in the experiment\r\nwith the red clover, the difference is at once striking. In one case a\r\nrich variety was isolated, and, by better treatment and sharp methods of\r\nselection, was brought up in a few years to its highest pitch of\r\ndevelopment. In the other case a very weak race was shown to exist, and\r\nno amount of work and perseverance was adequate to improve it to any\r\nnoticeable degree.\r\n\r\nI wish to point out that the decision of what is to be expected from\r\ndeviating specimens may become manifest within one or two generations.\r\nEven the generation grown from the seeds of [361] the first observed\r\naberrant-individuals, if gathered after sufficient isolation during the\r\nperiod of blossoming, may show which type of inheritance is present,\r\nwhether it is an unpromising half-race, or a richly endowed sporting\r\nvariety. I have kept such strains repeatedly after the first isolation,\r\nand a special case, that of cotyledoneous aberrations, will be dealt\r\nwith later. The first generation always gave a final decision, provided\r\nthat a suitable method of cultivation for the species under observation\r\nwas found at the beginning. This however, is a condition, which it is\r\nnot at all easy to comply with, when new sorts are introduced into a\r\ngarden. Especially so when they had been collected in the wild state.\r\nOften one or two years, sometimes more, are necessary to find the proper\r\nmethod of sowing, manuring, transplanting and, other cultural methods\r\nsatisfactory to the plants. Many wild species require more care and more\r\nmanure in gardens than the finest garden flowers. And a large number are\r\nknown to be dependent on very particular conditions of soil.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious features of anomalies, which has been learned\r\nfrom accumulated instances, is the fact that they obey definite laws as\r\nto their occurrence on the different parts of the plant. Obviously such\r\nlaws are [362] not apparent as long as each plant produces only one or\r\ntwo, or, at most, a few instances of the same deviation. On the\r\ncontrary, any existing regularity must betray itself, as soon as a\r\nlarger number of instances is produced. A rule of periodicity becomes\r\nmost clearly manifest in such cases.\r\n\r\nThis rule is shown by no other race in a more undoubted and evident\r\nmanner than by the \"five-leaved\" clover. Evidently the several degrees\r\nof deviation, going from three to seven leaflets, may be regarded as\r\nresponses to different degrees of variation, and their distribution over\r\nthe stems and branches, or over the whole plant, may be considered as\r\nthe manifestation of the ever-changing internal tendency to vary.\r\n\r\nConsidered from this point of view, my plants always showed a definite\r\nperiodicity in this distribution, which is the same for the whole plant.\r\nEach of them, and each of the larger branches, begin with atavistic\r\nleaves or with slight deviations. These are succeeded by greater\r\ndeviations, but only the strongest axes show as many as seven leaflets\r\non a stalk. This ordinarily does not occur before the height of\r\ndevelopment is reached, and often only towards its close. Then the\r\ndeviation diminishes rapidly, returning often to atavistic leaves at the\r\nsummit of the stem or branch. I give the numbers of the [363] leaves of\r\na branch, in their order from the base to the top. They were as follows:\r\n\r\n   3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  5.  5. 4.\r\n\r\nBut this is a selected case, and such regular examples of the expected\r\nperiodicity are rarely found. Often one or more of the various steps are\r\nlacking, or even leaves with smaller numbers may be interspersed among\r\nthose with larger numbers of leaflets. But while the regularity of the\r\nperiodicity is in some degree diminished by such occurrences, yet the\r\nrule always holds good, when taken broadly. It may be expressed by\r\nstating that the bases and apices have on the average fewer leaflets on\r\neach leaf than the middle parts of the stem and branches, and that the\r\nnumber of leaflets gradually increases from the base toward a maximum,\r\nwhich is reached in organs on the middle or upper part of the axis, and\r\nthen diminishes from this toward the apex.\r\n\r\nThis periodicity is not limited to the stems and branches, considered\r\nsingly, but also holds good in a comparison made between the branches of\r\na single stem, in regard to their relative places on that stem. So it is\r\nalso for the whole plant. The first stems, produced by the subterranean\r\naxis, ordinarily show only a low maximum deviation: the next succeeding\r\nbeing [364] more divergent and the last ones returning to less\r\ndifferentiated forms.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that on a given stem the group of deviating leaves will be\r\nextended upward and downward, with the increase of the number of these\r\norgans. This shows that a stem, or even a plant, promises a higher\r\ndegree of differentiation if it commences with its aberration earlier.\r\nHence it becomes possible to discern the most promising individuals in\r\nearly youth, and this conclusion leads to a very easy and reliable\r\nmethod of selection, which may be expressed simply as follows: the\r\nseedlings which commence earliest with the production of four- and\r\nfive-foliolate leaves are the best and should be selected for the\r\ncontinuance of the race. And it is easily seen that this rule agrees\r\nwith that given above, and which was followed in my pedigree-culture.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it is seen that there is a complete agreement between the\r\nlaw of periodicity and the responses of the deviations to nourishment\r\nand other conditions of life. Weak plants only produce low degrees of\r\ndeviation, the stronger the individual becomes, the higher it reaches in\r\nthe scale of differentiation, and the more often it develops leaves with\r\nfive or more blades. Whether weakness or strength are derived from outer\r\ncauses, or from the internal [365] succession of the periods of life, is\r\nevidently of no consequence, and in this way the law of periodicity may\r\nbe regarded as a special instance of the more general law of response to\r\nexternal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe validity of this law of periodicity is of course not limited to our\r\n\"five-leaved\" clover. Quite on the contrary it is universal in\r\neversporting varieties. Moreover it may be ascertained and studied in\r\nconnection with the most widely different morphologic abnormalities, and\r\ntherefore affords easily accessible material for statistical inquiry. I\r\nwill now give some further instances, but wish to insist first upon the\r\nnecessity of an inquiry on a far larger scale, as the evidence as yet is\r\nvery scanty.\r\n\r\nThe great celandine (_Chelidonium majus_) has a very curious double\r\nvariety. Its flowers are simpler and much more variable than in ordinary\r\ngarden-varieties. The process of doubling consists mainly in a change of\r\nstamens into petals. This change is dependent on the season. On each\r\nstem the earliest flowers are single. These are succeeded by blossoms\r\nwith one or two converted stamens, and towards the summer this number\r\nincreases gradually, attaining 10-11 and in some instances even more\r\naltered filaments. Each year the same succession may be seen repeating\r\nitself on the stems of [366] the old roots. Double tuberous begonias are\r\nordinarily absolutely sterile throughout the summer, but towards autumn\r\nthe new flowers become less and less altered, producing some normal\r\nstamens and pistils among the majority of metamorphosed organs. From\r\nthese flowers the seeds are saved. Sometimes similar flowers occur at\r\nthe beginning of the flowering-period. Double garden-camomiles\r\n(_Chrysanthemum inodorum plenissimum_) and many other double varieties\r\nof garden-plants among the great family of the composites are very\r\nsensitive to external agencies, and their flower-heads are fuller the\r\nmore favorable the external conditions. Towards the autumn many of them\r\nproduce fewer and fewer converted heads and often only these are fertile\r\nand yield seeds.\r\n\r\nAscidia afford another instance of this periodicity, though ordinarily\r\nthey are by far too rare to show any regularity in their distribution.\r\nHowever, it is easy to observe that on lime-trees they prefer the lower\r\nparts of each twig, while on magnolias the terminal leaves of the\r\nbranches are often pitcher-bearing. Ascidia of the white clover have\r\nbeen found in numbers, in my own experiment-garden, but always in the\r\nspringtime. The thickleaved saxifrage (_Saxifraga crassifolia_) is often\r\nvery productive of ascidia, especially in [367] the latter part of the\r\nseason, and as these organs may be developed to very different degrees,\r\nthey afford fine material for the study of the law of periodicity. On a\r\ngarden-cytisus (_Cytisus candicans attleyanus_) I once had the good\r\nfortune to observe a branch with ascidia, which ordinarily are very rare\r\nin this species. It had produced seven ascidia in all, each formed by\r\nthe conversion of one leaflet on the trifoliolate leaves. The first six\r\nleaves were destitute of this malformation and were quite normal. Then\r\nfollowed a group of five leaves, constituting the maximum of the period.\r\nThe first bore one small pitcher-like blade, the second and third, each\r\none highly modified organ, the fourth, two ascidia, and the last, one\r\nleaflet with slightly connate margins. The whole upper part of the\r\nbranch was normal, with the exception of the seventeenth leaf, which\r\nshowed a slight change in the same direction. All in all, the tendency\r\nto produce ascidia increased from the beginning to the tenth leaf, and\r\ndecreased from this upward.\r\n\r\nThe European Venus' looking-glass was observed in my garden to produce\r\nsome quaternate and some quinate flowers on the same specimens. The\r\nquinate were placed at the end of the branches, those with four petals\r\nand sepals lower down. The peloric fox-glove shows the [368] highest\r\ndegree of metamorphy in the terminal flowers of the stem itself, the\r\nweaker branches having but little tendency towards the formation of the\r\nanomaly. The European pine or _Pinus sylvestris_ ordinarily has two\r\nneedles in each sheath, but trifoliolate sheaths occur on the stems and\r\nstronger branches, where they prefer, as a rule, the upper parts of the\r\nsingle annual shoots. _Camellia japonica_ is often striped in the fall\r\nand during the winter, but when flowering in the spring it returns to\r\nthe monochromatic type.\r\n\r\nPeloric flowers are terminal in some cases, but occur in the lower parts\r\nof the flower-spikes in others. Some varieties of gladiolus commence on\r\neach spike with more or less double flowers, which, higher up, are\r\nreplaced by single ones. A wide range of bulbs and perennial\r\ngarden-plants develop their varietal characters only partly when grown\r\nfrom seed and flowering for the first time. The annual\r\ngarden-forget-me-not of the Azores (_Myosotis azorica_) has a variety\r\nwith curiously enlarged flowers, often producing 20 or more\r\ncorolla-segments in one flower. But this number gradually diminishes as\r\nthe season advances. It would be quite superfluous to give further proof\r\nof the general validity of the law of periodicity in ever-sporting\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n[369]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIII\r\n\r\nPISTILLODY IN POPPIES\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious anomalies that may be met with in ornamental\r\ngarden-plants is the conversion of stamens into pistils. It is neither\r\ncommon nor rare, but in most cases the change is so slight comparatively\r\nthat it is ordinarily overlooked. In the opium-poppy, on the contrary,\r\nit is very showy, and heightens the ornamental effect of the young\r\nfruits after the fading of the flowers. Here the central capsule is\r\nsurrounded by a large crown of metamorphosed stamens.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity has attracted the attention both of horticulturists and\r\nof botanists. As a rule not all the stamens are changed in this way but\r\nonly those of the innermost rows. The outer stamens remain normal and\r\nfertile, and the flowers, when pollinated with their own pollen, bear as\r\nrich a harvest of seeds as other opium-poppies. The change affects both\r\nthe filament and the anther, the former of which is dilated into a\r\nsheath. Within this sheath perfect [370] and more or less numerous\r\novules may be produced. The anthers become rudimentary and in their\r\nplace broad leafy flaps are developed, which protrude laterally from the\r\ntip and constitute the stigmas. Ordinarily these altered organs are\r\nsterile, but in some instances a very small quantity of seed is\r\nproduced, and when testing their viability I succeeded in raising a few\r\nplants from them.\r\n\r\nThe same anomaly occurs in other plants. The common wall-flower\r\n(_Cheiranthus Cheiri_) and the houseleek (_Sempervivum tectorum_) are\r\nthe best known instances. Both have repeatedly been described by various\r\ninvestigators. In compiling the literature of this subject it is very\r\ninteresting to observe the two contrasting views respecting the nature\r\nof this anomaly. Some writers, and among them Masters in his \"Vegetable\r\nTeratology\" consider the deviations to be merely accidental. According\r\nto them some species are more subject to this anomaly than others, and\r\nthe houseleek is said to be very prone to this change. Goeppert,\r\nHofmeister and others occasionally found the pistilloid poppies in\r\nfields or gardens, and sowed their seeds in order to ascertain whether\r\nthe accidental peculiarity was inheritable or not. On the other hand De\r\nCandolle in his \"Prodromus\" mentions the pistilloid wall-flowers as a\r\ndistinct [371] variety, under the name of _Cheiranthus Cheiri\r\ngynantherus_, and the analogous form of the opium-poppy is not at all an\r\naccidental anomaly, but an old true horticultural variety, which can be\r\nbought everywhere under the names of _Papaver somniferum monstruosum_ or\r\n_polycephalum_. Since it is an annual plant, only the seeds are for\r\nsale, and this at once gives a sufficient proof of its heredity. In all\r\ncases, where it was met with accidentally by botanists, it is to be\r\nassumed that stray seeds had been casually mixed with those of other\r\nvarieties, or that the habit had been transmitted by a spontaneous\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nWherever opportunity led to experiments on heredity, distinct races were\r\nfound to be in possession of this quality, while others were not. It is\r\nof no use to cultivate large numbers of wall-flowers in the hope of one\r\nday seeing the anomaly arise; the only means is to secure the strain\r\nfrom those who have got it. With poppies the various varieties are so\r\noften intercrossed by bees, that the appearance of an accidental change\r\nmay sometimes be produced, and in the houseleek the pistilloid warily\r\nseems to be the ordinary one, the normal strain being very rare or\r\nperhaps wholly wanting.\r\n\r\nOur three illustrative examples are good and permanent races, producing\r\ntheir peculiar qualities [372] regularly and abundantly. In this respect\r\nthey are however very variable and dependent on external circumstances.\r\nSuch a regularity is not met with in other instances. Often\r\npedigree-experiments lead to poor races, betraying their tendency to\r\ndeviate only from time to time and in rare cases. Such instances\r\nconstitute what we have called in a former lecture, \"half races,\" and\r\ntheir occurrence indicates that the casual observation of an anomaly is\r\nnot in itself adequate to give an opinion as to the chance of repetition\r\nin sowing experiments. A large number of species seem to belong to this\r\ncase, and their names may be found in the above mentioned work by\r\nMasters and elsewhere. But no effort has yet been made to separate\r\nthoroughly the pistilloid half-races from the corresponding\r\never-sporting varieties. Some plants are recorded as being more liable\r\nto this peculiarity than others.\r\n\r\nStamens are sometimes replaced by open carpels with naked ovules arising\r\nfrom their edges and even from their whole inner surfaces. This may be\r\nseen in distinct strains of the cultivated bulbous Begonia, and more\r\nrarely in primroses. Here the apex of the carpellary leaf is sometimes\r\ndrawn out into a long style, terminated by a flattened spatulate stigma.\r\n\r\nThe pistillody of the stamens is frequently [373] combined with another\r\ndeviation in the poppies. This is the growing together of some of the\r\naltered stamens so as to constitute smaller or larger connate groups.\r\nOften two are united, sometimes three, four or more. Flowers with\r\nnumerous altered stamens are seldom wholly free from this most\r\nundesirable secondary anomaly. I call it undesirable with respect to\r\nexperiments on the variability of the character. For it may easily be\r\nseen that while it is feasible to count the stamens even when converted\r\ninto pistils, it is not possible when groups of them are more or less\r\nintimately united into single bodies. This combination makes all\r\nenumeration difficult and inaccurate and often wholly unreliable. In\r\nsuch cases the observation is limited to a computation of the degree of\r\nthe change, rather than to a strict numerical inquiry. Happily the\r\nresponses to the experimental influences are so marked and distinct that\r\neven this method of describing them has proved to be wholly sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn extreme instances I have seen all the changed stamens of a flower of\r\nthe opium-poppy united into a single body, so as to form a close sheath\r\nall around the central ovary. Lesser sheaths, surrounding one-half or\r\none-third of the capsule are of course less rarely met with. Leaving\r\nthis description of the outer appearance [374] of our anomaly, we may\r\nnow consider it from the double point of view of inheritance and\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nThe fact of inheritance is shown by the experience of many authors, and\r\nby the circumstance already quoted, that the variety has been propagated\r\nfrom seed for more than half a century, and may be obtained from various\r\nseed merchants. In respect to the variability, the variety belongs to\r\nthe ever-sporting group, constituting a type which is more closely\r\nrelated to the \"five-leaved\" clover than to the striped flowers or even\r\nthe double stocks.\r\n\r\nIt fluctuates around an average type with half filled crowns, going as\r\nfar as possible in both directions, but never transgressing either\r\nlimit. It is even doubtful whether the presumable limits are, under\r\nordinary circumstances, ever reached. Obviously one extreme would be the\r\nconversion of all the stamens, and the other the absolute deficiency of\r\nany marked tendency to such a change. Both may occur, and will probably\r\nbe met with from time to time. But they must be extremely rare, since in\r\nmy own extensive experiments, which were strictly controlled, I never\r\nwas able to find a single instance of either of them. Some of the outer\r\nstamens have always remained unchanged, yielding enough pollen for the\r\nartificial pollination of [375] the central ovary, and on the other hand\r\nsome rudiments of hardened filaments were always left, even if they were\r\nreduced to small protuberances on the thalamus of the flower. Between\r\nthese extremes all grades occur. From single, partially or wholly\r\nchanged stamens upwards to 150 and over, all steps may be seen. It is a\r\ntrue fluctuating variability. There is an average of between 50 and 100,\r\nconstituting a nearly filled crown around the central capsule. Around\r\nthis average the smaller deviations are most numerous and the larger\r\nones more rare. The inspection of any bed of the variety suffices to\r\nshow that, taken broadly, the ordinary laws of fluctuating variability\r\nare applicable. No counting of the single individuals is required to\r\ndispel all doubts on this point.\r\n\r\nMoreover all intermediate steps respecting the conversion of the single\r\nstamens may nearly always be seen. Rarely all are changed into normal\r\nsecondary ovaries with a stigma and with a cavity filled with ovules.\r\nOften the stigma is incomplete or even almost wanting, in other\r\ninstances the ovules are lacking or the cavity itself is only partially\r\ndeveloped. Not rarely some stamens are reduced and converted into thin\r\nhard stalks, without any appearance of an ovary at their tip. But then\r\nthe demarcation [376] between them and the thalamus fails, so that they\r\ncannot be thrown off when the flower fades away, but remain as small\r\nstumps around the base of the more fully converted filaments. This fact\r\nwould frequently render the enumeration of the altered organs quite\r\nunreliable.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I have chosen a group of arbitrary stages in order to\r\nexpress the degree of deviation for a given lot of plants. The limits\r\nwere chosen so as to be sufficiently trustworthy and easy to ascertain.\r\nIn each group the members could be counted, and a series of figures was\r\nreached by this means which allowed of a further comparison of the\r\ncompeting sets of plants.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that in such experiments and especially in the case\r\nof such a showy criterion as the pistilloid heads afford after the time\r\nof flowering is over, the inspection of the controlling beds at once\r\nindicates the result of the experiment. Even a hasty survey is in most\r\ncases sufficient to get a definite conclusion. Where this is not the\r\ncase, the counting of the individuals of the various groups often does\r\nnot add to the evidence, and the result remains uncertain. On the other\r\nhand, the impression made by the groups of plants on the experimenter\r\nand on his casual visitors, cannot well be conveyed to the readers of\r\nhis account by [377] other means than by figures. For this reason the\r\nresult of the experiments is expressed in this way.\r\n\r\nI made six groups. The first includes the cases where the whole circle\r\nis reduced to small rudiments. The second shows 1-10 secondary capsules.\r\nThe two following constitute half a crown around the central fruit, the\r\nthird going up to this limit, the fourth going from this limit to a\r\nnearly filled circle. Wholly filled circles of secondary capsules\r\nwithout gaps give the two last degrees, the fifth requiring only\r\ncontinuity of the circle, the sixth displaying a large and bright crown\r\nall around the central head. The fifth group ordinarily includes from\r\n90-100 altered stamens, while the sixth has from 100-150 of these\r\ndeviating parts.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cultures the third and fourth group, with their interrupted\r\ncrowns, predominate. Large crowns are rare and flowers which at first\r\nsight seem to be wholly normal, occur only under circumstances\r\ndefinitely known to be unfavorable to growth, and to the development of\r\nthe anomaly.\r\n\r\nHaving reached by this means a very simple and easy method of stating\r\nthe facts shown by equal lots under contrasting influences, we will now\r\nmake use of it to inquire into the relation [378] of this exceptionally\r\nhigh degree of variability to the inner and outer conditions of life.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, all experiments show the existence of such a relation.\r\nUnfavorable conditions reduce the numbers of altered stamens, favorable\r\ncircumstances raise it to its highest point. This holds true for lots\r\nincluding hundreds of specimens, but also for the sundry heads of one\r\nbed, and often for one single plant.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the terminal flower with those of the lateral branches on\r\na plant, and when no special influences disturb the experiment, the\r\nterminal head ordinarily bears the richest crown. If the first has more\r\nthan 100 metamorphosed parts, the latter have often less than 50 on the\r\nsame plant. In poor soil, terminal heads are often reduced to 10-20\r\nmonstrous organs, and in such cases I found the lateral flowers of the\r\nsame plants ordinarily with less than 10 altered stamens. In some cases\r\nI allowed the branches of the third and fourth degree, in other words,\r\nthe side twigs of the first branches of my selected plants to grow out\r\nand produce flowers in the fall. They were ordinarily weak, sometimes\r\nvery small, having only 5-9 stigmas on their central fruit. Secondary\r\ncapsules were not seen on such flowers, even when the experiment was\r\nrepeated on a [379] somewhat larger scale and during a series of years.\r\n\r\nAmong the same lot of plants individual differences almost always occur.\r\nThey are partly due to inequalities already existing in the seeds, and\r\npartly to the diversity of the various parts of the same bed. Some of\r\nthe plants become stout and have large terminal heads. Others remain\r\nvery weak, with a slender stem, small leaves and undersized flowers. The\r\nheight and thickness of the stem, the growth of the foliage and of the\r\naxillary buds are the most obvious measures of the individual strength\r\nof the plant. The development of the terminal flower and the size of its\r\novary manifestly depends largely on this individual strength, as may be\r\nseen at once by the inspection of any bed of opium-poppies. Now this\r\nsize of the head can easily be measured, either by its height or\r\ncircumference, or by its weight. Moreover we can arrange them into a\r\nseries according to their size. If we do this with the polycephalous\r\nvariety, the relation between individual strength and degree of\r\nmetamorphosis at once becomes manifest. The largest heads have the\r\nbrightest crowns, and the number of supernumerary carpels diminishes in\r\nnearly exact proportion to the size of the fruits. Fruits with less than\r\n50 altered stamens weighed on an average 5 grams, [380] those with\r\n50-100 such organs 7 grams and those with a bright crown 10 grams, the\r\nappendices being removed before the weighing. Corresponding results have\r\nbeen reached by the comparison of the height of the capsules with their\r\nabnormal surroundings. The degree of development of the monstrosity is\r\nshown by this observation to be directly dependent on, and in a sense\r\nproportionate to the individual strength of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the specimens grown from a single lot of seeds,\r\nfor instance from the seeds of one self-fertilized capsule are, as I\r\nhave said, partly due to the divergences which are always present in a\r\nbed, even if the utmost care has been taken to make it as uniform as\r\npossible. These local differences are ordinarily underrated and\r\noverlooked, and it is often considered to be sufficient to cultivate\r\nsmall lots of plants under apparently similar conditions on neighboring\r\nbeds, to be justified in imputing all the observed deviations of the\r\nplants to hereditary inequalities. This of course is true for large\r\nlots, whenever the averages only are compared. In smaller experiments\r\nthe external conditions of the single individuals should always be\r\nconsidered carefully. Lots of one or two square meters suffice for such\r\ncomparisons, but smaller lots are always subject to chances and [381]\r\npossibilities, which should never be left out of consideration.\r\n\r\nTherefore I will now point out some circumstances, which are ordinarily\r\ndifferent on various parts of one and the same bed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place comes the inequality of the seeds themselves. Some of\r\nthem will germinate earlier and others later. Those that display their\r\ncotyledons on a sunny day will be able to begin at once with the\r\nproduction of organic food. Others appear in bad weather, and will thus\r\nbe retarded in their development. These effects are of a cumulative\r\nnature as the young plants must profit by every hour of sunshine,\r\naccording to the size of the cotyledons. Any inequality between two\r\nyoung seedlings is apt to be increased by this cumulative effect.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good for the soil of the bed. It is simply impossible to\r\nmix the manure so equally that all individuals receive the same amount\r\nof it from the very beginning. I am in the habit of using manures in a\r\ndry and pulverized condition, of giving definite quantities to each\r\nsquare meter, and of taking the utmost care to get equal distribution\r\nand mixture with the soil, always being present myself during this most\r\nimportant operation. Nevertheless it is impossible to make the\r\nnourishment exactly equal for all the plants of even a small bed.\r\n\r\n[382] Any inequality from this cause will increase the difference in the\r\nsize of the young leaves, augment the inequality of their production of\r\norganic matter and for this reason go on in an ever increasing rate.\r\n\r\nRain and spraying, or on the other hand dryness of the soil, have still\r\ngreater consequences. The slightest unevenness of the surface will cause\r\nsome spots to dry rapidly and others to retain moisture during hours and\r\neven sometimes during days.\r\n\r\nSeeds, germinating in such little moist depressions grow regularly and\r\nrapidly, while those on the dryer elevations may be retarded for hours\r\nand days, before fully unfurling their seed-leaves. After heavy rains\r\nthese differences may be observed to increase continually, and in some\r\ninstances I found that plants were produced only on the wet spots, while\r\nthe dry places remained perfectly bare. From this the wet spots seem to\r\nbe the most favorable, but on the other hand, seeds may come to\r\ngerminate there too numerously and so closely that the young plants will\r\nbe crowded together and find neither space nor light enough, for a free\r\nand perfect development. The advantage may change to disadvantage in\r\nthis way unless the superfluous individuals are weeded out in due time.\r\n\r\n[383] From all these and other reasons some plants will be favored by\r\nthe external conditions from the beginning, while others will be\r\nretarded, and the effects will gradually increase until at last they\r\nbecome sufficient to account for a considerable amount of individual\r\nvariability. There is no doubt that the difference in the strength of\r\nthe plant and in the size of the capsules, going from 5-10 grams for a\r\nsingle fruit, are for the most part due to these unavoidable\r\ncircumstances. I have tried all conceivable means to find remedies for\r\nthese difficulties, but only by sowing my seeds in pans in a glass-house\r\nhave I been able to reach more constant and equal conditions. But\r\nunfortunately such a method requires the planting out of the young\r\nseedlings in the beginning of the summer, and this operation is not\r\nwithout danger for opium-poppies, and especially not without important\r\ninfluence on the monstrosity of the pistilloid variety. Consequently my\r\nsowings of this plant have nearly always been made in the beds.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how great the influence of all these little things may\r\nbecome, we only have to make two sowings on neighboring beds and under\r\nconditions which have carefully been made as equal as possible. If we\r\nuse for these controlling experiments seeds from one and the same\r\ncapsule, it will soon become evident that [384] no exact similarity\r\nbetween the two lots may be expected. Such differences as may be seen in\r\nthese cases are therefore never to be considered of value when comparing\r\ntwo lots of seeds of different origin, or under varying conditions. No\r\namount of accuracy in the estimation of the results of a trial, or in\r\nthe counting out of the several degrees of the anomaly, is adequate to\r\novercome the inaccuracy resulting from these differences.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly of great importance to have a correct conception in\r\nregard to the influence of the surrounding conditions on the growth of a\r\nplant and on the development of the attribute we are to deal with. No\r\nless important is the question of the sensibility of the plants to these\r\nfactors. Obviously this sensibility must not be expected to remain the\r\nsame during the entire life-period, and periods of stronger and of\r\nweaker responses may be discerned.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is evident that external or inner influences are\r\nable to change the direction of the development of an organ only so long\r\nas this development is not yet fully finished. In the young flower-bud\r\nof the pistilloid poppy there must evidently be some moment in which it\r\nis definitely decided whether the young stamens will grow out normally\r\nor become metamorphosed into secondary pistils. From this [385] moment\r\nno further change of external conditions is able to produce a\r\ncorresponding change in the degree of the anomaly. The individual\r\nstrength of the whole plant may still be affected in a more or less\r\nmanifest degree, but the number of converted stamens of the flower has\r\nbeen definitely fixed. The sensitive period has terminated.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the exact moment of this termination of the period\r\nof sensibility, I have followed the development of the flower buds\r\nduring the first weeks of the life of the young plants. The terminal\r\nflower may already be seen in young plants only seven weeks old, with a\r\nstem not exceeding 5-6 cm. in height and a flower-bud with a diameter of\r\nnearly 1 mm., in which the stamens and secondary pistils are already\r\ndiscernible, but still in the condition of small rounded protuberances\r\non the thalamus. Though it is not possible at that time to observe any\r\ndifference between the future normal and converted stamens, it does not\r\nseem doubtful that the development is so far advanced, that in the inner\r\ntissues the decision has already definitely been taken. In the next few\r\ndays this decision rapidly becomes visible, and the different parts of\r\nthe normal stamens and the metamorphosed carpels soon become apparent.\r\nFrom this observation it [386] can be inferred that the sensitive period\r\nof the anomaly is limited for the terminal flower-head, to the first few\r\nweeks of the life of the young plants. The secondary heads manifestly\r\nleave this period at a somewhat later stage.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove the accuracy of this conclusion I have tried to injure\r\nthe anomalies after the expiration of the first six or seven weeks. I\r\ndeprived them of their leaves, and damaged them in different ways. I\r\nsucceeded in making them very weak and slender, without being able to\r\ndiminish the number of the supernumerary carpels. The proportionality of\r\nthe size of the central fruit and the development of the surrounding\r\ncrown can often be modified or even destroyed by this means, and the\r\napparent exceptions from this rule, which are often observed, may find\r\ntheir explanation in this way.\r\n\r\nIn the second place I have tried to change the development of the\r\nanomaly during the period of sensibility, and even in the last part of\r\nit. This experiment succeeded fully when carried out within the fifth or\r\nsixth week after the beginning of the germination. As means of injury I\r\ntransplanted the young plants. To this end I sowed my seeds in pans in\r\nunmanured soil, planted them out in little pots with richly prepared\r\nearth, grew them in these during a few weeks and afterwards transferred\r\nthem to the [387] beds, taking care that the pats were removed, but the\r\nballs of earth not broken.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this treatment the plants became very large and\r\nstrong, with luxuriant foliage and relatively numerous large flowers and\r\nfruits. But almost without exception they were poor in anomalous\r\nstamens, at least so on the terminal heads. On a lot of some 70 plants\r\nmore than 50 had less than half a crown of secondary capsules, while\r\nfrom the same packet of seed the control-plants gave in an equal number\r\nmore than half of filled crowns on all plants with the exception of five\r\nweak specimens.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to compare such artificially injured plants with the\r\nordinary cultures. Strong stems and heavy fruits, which otherwise are\r\nalways indicative of showy crowns, now bear fruits wholly or nearly\r\ndestitute of any anomalous change. The commonly prevailing rule seems to\r\nbe reversed, showing thereby the possibility of abolishing the\r\ncorrelation between individual strength and anomaly by an artificial\r\nencroachment upon the normal conditions.\r\n\r\nAside from these considerations the experiments clearly give proof of\r\nthe existence of a period of sensibility limited to the first weeks of\r\nthe life of the plant for the terminal flower. This knowledge enables us\r\nto explain many apparent [388] parent abnormalities, which may occur in\r\nthe experiments.\r\n\r\nWe now may take a broader view of the period of sensibility. Evidently\r\nthe response to external influences will be greater the younger the\r\norgan. Sensibility will gradually diminish, and the phenomena observed\r\nin the last part of this period may be considered as the last remainder\r\nof a reaction which previously must have been much stronger and much\r\nreadier, providing that it would be possible to isolate them from, and\r\ncontrast them with, the other responses of the same plant.\r\n\r\nWith the light thus cast upon the question, we may conclude that the\r\nsensitive period commences not only at the beginning of the germination,\r\nbut must also be considered to include the life of the seed itself. From\r\nthe moment of fertilization and the formation of the young embryo the\r\ndevelopment must be subjected to the influence of external agencies\r\nwhich determine the direction it will take and the degree of development\r\nit will finally be able to acquire. Probably the time of growth of the\r\nembryo and of the ripening of the seed correspond exactly to the period\r\nof highest sensibility. This period is only interrupted during the\r\nresting stage of the seed, to be repeated in germination. Afterwards the\r\nsensibility [389] slowly and gradually decreases, to end with the\r\ndefinite decision of all further growth sometime before the outer form\r\nof the organ becomes visible under the microscope. The last period of\r\nlife includes only an expansion of the tissues, which may still have\r\nsome influence on their final size, but not on their form. This has been\r\ndefinitely arrested before the end of the sensitive period, and\r\nordinarily before the commencement of that rapid development, which is\r\nusually designated by the name of growth, as contrasted with evolution.\r\n\r\nWithin the seed the evolution of the young plant manifestly depends upon\r\nthe qualities and life-conditions of the parent-plant. The stronger this\r\nis, and the more favorable circumstances it is placed under, the more\r\nfood will be available for the seed, and the healthier will be the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo. Only well-nourished plants give\r\nwell-nourished seeds, and the qualities of each plant are for this\r\nreason at least, partly dependent on the properties of its parents and\r\neven of its grandparents.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations the inference is forced upon us that the\r\napparently hereditary differences, which are observed to exist among the\r\nseeds of a species or a variety and even of a single strain or a single\r\nparent-plant, may for a large part, and perhaps wholly, be the result\r\n[390] of the life-conditions of their parents and grandparents. Within\r\nthe race all ssvariability would in this way be reduced to the effects\r\nof external circumstances. Among these nourishment is no doubt the most\r\nmomentous, and this to such a degree that older writers designated the\r\nexternal conditions by the term nourishment. According to Knight\r\nnutrition reigns supreme in the whole realm of variability, the kind of\r\nfood and the method of nourishment coming into consideration only in a\r\nsecondary way. The amount of useful nutrition is the all-important\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, and if nutrition decides the degree of deviation of any\r\ngiven character, the widest deviating individuals are the best nourished\r\nones. The best nourished not only during the period of sensibility of\r\nthe attribute under consideration, but also in the broadest sense of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThis discussion casts a curious light upon the whole question of\r\nselection. Not of course upon the choice of elementary species or\r\nvarieties out of the original motley assembly which nature and old\r\ncultures offer us, but upon the selection of the best individuals for\r\nisolation and for the improvement of the race. These are, according to\r\nmy views, only the best nourished ones. Their external conditions have\r\nbeen the [391] most favorable, not only from the beginning of their own\r\nlife in the field, but also during their embryonic stages, and even\r\nduring the preparation of these latter in the life of their parents and\r\nperhaps even their grandparents. Selection then, would only be the\r\nchoice of the best nourished individuals.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing arguments I have tried to separate the\r\nchoicest of the poppies with the largest crown of pistilloid stamens,\r\nfrom the most vigorous individuals. As we have already seen, these two\r\nattributes are as a rule proportional to one another. Exceptions occur,\r\nbut they may be explained by some later changes in the external\r\ncircumstances, as I have also pointed out. As a rule, these exceptions\r\nare large fruits with comparatively too few converted stamens; they are\r\nexactly the contrary from what is required for a selection. Or plants,\r\nwhich from the beginning were robust, may have become crowded together\r\nby further growth, and for these reasons become weaker than their\r\ncongeners, though retaining the full development of the staminodal\r\ncrown, which was fixed during the sensitive period and before the\r\ncrowding. I have searched my beds yearly for several years in vain to\r\nfind individuals which might recommend themselves for selection without\r\nhaving the stamp of permanent, [392] or at least temporarily better,\r\nnourishment. No starting-point for such an independent selection has\r\never been met with.\r\n\r\nSumming up the consequences of this somewhat extended discussion, we may\r\nstate it as a rule that a general proportion between the individual\r\nstrength and the degree of development of the anomaly exists. And from\r\nthis point of view it is easy to see that all external causes which are\r\nknown to affect the one, must be expected to influence the other also.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore hardly be necessary to give a full description of all\r\nmy experiments on the relations of the monstrosity to external\r\nconditions. A hasty survey will suffice.\r\n\r\nThis survey is not only intended to convey an idea of the relations of\r\npistilloid poppies to their environment, but may serve as an example of\r\nthe principle involved. According to my experience with a large range of\r\nother anomalies, the same rule prevails everywhere. And this rule is so\r\nsimple that exact knowledge of one instance may be considered as\r\nsufficient to enable us to calculate from analogy what is to be expected\r\nfrom a given treatment of any other anomaly. Our appreciation of\r\nobserved facts and the conditions to be chosen for intended cultures are\r\nlargely dependent on such calculations. What I am now going to describe\r\n[393] is to be considered therefore as an experimental basis for such\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nFirst of all comes the question how many individuals are to be grown in\r\na given place. When sowing plants for experimental purposes it is always\r\nbest to sow in rows, and to give as few seeds to each row as possible,\r\nso as to insure all necessary space to the young plants. On the other\r\nhand the seeds do not all germinate, and after sowing too thinly, gaps\r\nmay appear in the rows. This would cause not only a loss of space, but\r\nan inequality between the plants in later life, as those nearest the\r\ngaps would have more space and more light, and a larger area for their\r\nroots than those growing in the unbroken rows. Hence the necessity of\r\nusing large quantities of seed and of weeding out a majority of young\r\nplants on the spots where the greatest numbers germinate.\r\n\r\nCrowded cultures as a rule, will give weak plants with thin stems,\r\nmostly unbranched and bearing only small capsules. According to the\r\nrule, these will produce imperfect crowns of secondary pistils. The\r\nresult of any culture will thus be dependent to a high degree on the\r\nnumber of individuals per square meter. I have sown two similar and\r\nneighboring beds with the thoroughly mixed seeds of parent-plants of the\r\nsame strain and culture, using as much [394] as 2.5 cu. cm. per square\r\nmeter. On one of the beds I left all the germinating plants untouched\r\nand nearly 500 of them flowered, but among them 360 were almost without\r\npistillody, and only 10 had full crowns. In the other bed I weeded away\r\nmore than half of the young plants, leaving only some 150 individuals\r\nand got 32 with a full crown, nearly 100 with half crowns and only 25\r\napparently without monstrosity.\r\n\r\nThese figures are very striking. From the same quantity of seed, in\r\nequal spaces, by similar exposure and treatment I got 10 fully developed\r\ninstances in one and 32 in the other case. The weeding out of\r\nsupernumerary individuals had not only increased the percentage of\r\nbright crowns, but also their absolute number per square meter. So the\r\ngreatest number of anomalies upon a given space may be obtained by\r\ntaking care that not too many plants are grown upon it: any increase of\r\nthe number beyond a certain limit will diminish the probability of\r\nobtaining these structures. The most successful cultures may be made\r\nafter the maximum number of individuals per unit of area has been\r\ndetermined. A control-experiment was made under the same conditions and\r\nwith the same seed, but allowing much less for the same space. I sowed\r\nonly 1 cu. cm. on my bed of 2 square meters, and thereby avoided [395]\r\nnearly all weeding out. I got 120 plants, and among them 30 with full\r\ncrowns of converted stamens, practically the same number as after the\r\nweeding out in the first experiment. This shows that smaller quantities\r\nof seed give an equal chance for a greater number of large crowns, and\r\nshould therefore always be preferred, as it saves both seed and labor.\r\n\r\nWeeding out is a somewhat dangerous operation in a comparative trial.\r\nAny one who has done it often, knows that there is a strong propensity\r\nto root out the weaker plants and to spare the stronger ones. Obviously\r\nthis is the best way for ordinary purposes, but for comparisons\r\nevidently one should not discriminate. This rule is very difficult in\r\npractice, and for this reason one should never sow more than is\r\nabsolutely required to meet all requirements.\r\n\r\nOur second point is the manuring of the soil. This is always of the\r\nhighest importance, both for normal and for anomalous attributes. The\r\nconversion of the stamens into pistils is in a large measure dependent\r\nupon the conditions of the soil. I made a trial with some 800 flowering\r\nplants, using one sample of seed, but sowing one-third on richly manured\r\nsoil, one-third on an unprepared bed of my garden, and one-third on\r\nnearly pure sand. In all other respects the three groups were treated in\r\nthe same way. Of [396] the manured plants one-half gave full crowns, of\r\nthe non-manured only one-fifth, and on the sandy soil a still smaller\r\nproportion. Other trials led to the same results. I have often made use\r\nof steamed and ground horn, which is a manure very rich in nitrogenous\r\nsubstances. One-eighth of a kilo per square meter is an ample amount.\r\nAnd its effect was to increase the number of full crowns to an\r\nexceptional degree.\r\n\r\nIn the controlling trial and under ordinary circumstances this figure\r\nreached some 50%, but with ground horn it came up as high as 90%. We may\r\nstate this result by the very striking assertion that the number of\r\nlarge crowns in a given culture may be nearly doubled by rich manure.\r\n\r\nAll other external conditions act in a similar manner. The best\r\ntreatment is required to attain the best result. A sunny exposure is one\r\nof the most essential requisites, and in some attempts to cultivate my\r\npoppies in the shade, I found the pistillody strongly reduced, not a\r\nsingle full crown being found in the whole lot. Often the weather may be\r\nhurtful, especially during the earlier stages of the plants. I protected\r\nmy beds during several trials by covering them with glass for a few\r\nweeks, until the young plants reached the glass covering. I got a normal\r\nnumber of full crowns, some 55%, at a time [397] when the weather was so\r\nbad as to reduce the number in the control experiments to 10%.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite superfluous to give more details or to describe\r\nadditional experiments. Suffice to say, that the results all point in\r\nthe same direction, and that pistillody of the poppies always clearly\r\nresponds to the treatment, especially to external conditions during the\r\nfirst few weeks, that is, during the period of sensitiveness. The\r\nhealthier and the stronger the plants the more fully they will develop\r\ntheir anomaly.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion something is to be said about the choice of the seed.\r\nObviously it is possible to compare seeds of different origin by sowing\r\nand treating them in the same way, giving attention to all the points\r\nabove mentioned. In doing so the first question will be, whether there\r\nis a difference between the seeds of strong plants with a bright crown\r\naround the head and those of weaker individuals with lesser development\r\nof the anomaly. It is evident that such a difference must be expected,\r\nsince the nutrition of the seed takes place during the period of the\r\ngreatest sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nBut the experiments will show whether this effect holds good against the\r\ninfluences which tend to change the direction of the development of the\r\nanomaly during the time of germination. [398] The result of my attempt\r\nhas shown that the choice of the seeds has a manifest influence upon the\r\nultimate development of the monstrosity, but that this influence is not\r\nstrong enough to overwhelm all other factors.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the fullest or smallest crowns may be repeated during\r\nsucceeding generations, and each time compared with a culture under\r\naverage conditions. By this means we come to true selection-experiments,\r\nand these result in a notable and rapid change of the whole strain. By\r\nselecting the brightest crowns I have come up in three years from 40 to\r\n90 and ultimately to 120 converted stamens in the best flower of my\r\nculture, and in selecting the smallest crowns I was able in three years\r\nto exclude nearly all good crowns, and to make cultures in which heads\r\nwith less than half-filled crowns constituted the majority. But such\r\nselected strains always remain very sensitive to treatment, and by\r\nchanging the conditions the effect may be wholly lost in a single year,\r\nor even turned in the contrary direction. In other words, the anomaly is\r\nmore dependent on external conditions during the germinating period than\r\non the choice of the seeds, providing these belong to the pistilloid\r\nvariety and have not deteriorated by some crossing with other sorts.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this lecture I stated that [399] no selection is\r\nadequate to produce either a pure strain of brightly crowned\r\nflower-heads without atavism, or to conduce to an absolute and permanent\r\nloss of the anomaly. During a series of years I have tested my plants in\r\nboth directions, but without the least effect. Limits are soon reached\r\non both sides, and to transgress these seems quite impossible.\r\n\r\nTaking these limits as the marks of the variety, and considering all\r\nfluctuations between them as responses to external influences working\r\nduring the life of the individual or governing the ripening of the\r\nseeds, we get a clear picture of a permanent ever-sporting type. The\r\nlimits are absolutely permanent during the whole existence of this\r\nalready old variety. They never change. But they include so wide a range\r\nof variability, that the extremes may be said to sport into one another,\r\nso much the more so as one of the extremes is to be considered\r\nmorphologically as the type of the variation, while the other extreme\r\ncan hardly be distinguished from the normal form of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[400]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIV\r\n\r\nMONSTROSITIES\r\n\r\nI have previously dealt with the question of the hereditary tendencies\r\nthat cause monstrosities. These tendencies are not always identical for\r\nthe same anomaly. Two different types may generally, be distinguished.\r\nOne of them constitutes a poor variety, the other a rich one. But this\r\nlatter is abundant and the first one is poor in instances of exactly the\r\nsame conformation. Therefore the difference only lies in the frequency\r\nof the anomaly, and not in its visible features. In discovering an\r\ninstance of any anomaly it is therefore impossible to tell whether it\r\nbelongs to a poor or to a rich race. This important question can only be\r\nanswered by direct sowing-experiments to determine the degree of\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nMonstrosities are often considered as accidents, and rightfully so, at\r\nleast as long as they are considered from a morphological point of view.\r\nPhysiology of course excludes all accidentality. And in our present ease\r\nit shows [401] that some internal hereditary quality is present, though\r\noften latent, and that the observed anomalies are to be regarded as\r\nresponses of this innate tendency to external conditions. Our two types\r\ndiffer in the frequency of these responses. Rare in the poor race, they\r\nare numerous in the rich variety. The external conditions being the same\r\nfor both, the hereditary factor must be different. The tendency is weak\r\nin the one and strong in the other. In both cases, according to my\r\nexperience, it may be weakened or strengthened by selection and by\r\ntreatment. Often to a very remarkable degree, but not so far as to\r\ntransgress the limits between the two races. Such transgression may\r\napparently be met with from time to time, but then the next generation\r\ngenerally shows the fallacy of the conclusion, as it returns more or\r\nless directly to the type from which the strain had been derived.\r\nMonstrosities should always be studied by physiologists from this point\r\nof view. Poor and rich strains of the same anomaly seem at first sight\r\nto be so nearly allied that it might be thought to be very easy to\r\nchange the one into the other. Nevertheless such changes are not on\r\nrecord, and although I have made several attempts in this line, I never\r\nsucceeded in passing the limit. I am quite convinced that sometime [402]\r\na method will be discovered of arbitrarily producing such conversions,\r\nand perhaps the easiest way to attain artificial mutations may lie\r\nconcealed here. But as yet not the slightest indication of this\r\npossibility is to be found, save the fallacious conclusions drawn from\r\ntoo superficial observations.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the poor strains are not very interesting. Their chance of\r\nproducing beautiful instances of the anomaly for which they are\r\ncultivated is too small. Exceptions to this rule are only afforded by\r\nthose curious and rare anomalies, which command general attention, and\r\nof which, therefore, instances are always welcome. In such cases they\r\nare searched for with perseverance, and the fact of their rarity\r\nimpresses itself strongly on our mind.\r\n\r\nTwisted stems are selected as a first example. This monstrosity, called\r\n_biastrepsis_, consists of strongly marked torsions as are seen in many\r\nspecies with decussate leaves, though as a rule it is very rare. Two\r\ninstances are the most generally known, those of the wild valerian\r\n(_Valeriana officinalis_) and those of cultivated and wild sorts of\r\nteasels (_Dipsacus fullonum_, _D. sylvestris_, and others). Both of\r\nthese I have cultivated during upwards of fifteen years, but with\r\ncontradictory results. The valerian is a perennial herb, multiplying\r\nitself yearly by [403] slender rootstocks or runners producing at their\r\ntips new rosettes of leaves and in the center of these the flowering\r\nstem. My original plant has since been propagated in this manner, and\r\nduring several years I preserved large beds with hundreds of stems, in\r\nothers I was compelled to keep my culture within more restricted limits.\r\nThis plant has produced twisted stems of the curious shape, with a\r\nnearly straight flag of leaves on one side, described by De Candolle and\r\nother observers, nearly every year. But only one or two instances of\r\nabnormal stems occurred in each year, and no treatment has been found\r\nthat proved adequate to increase this number in any appreciable manner.\r\nI have sown the seeds of this plant repeatedly, either from normal or\r\nfrom twisted stems, but without better results. It was highly desirable\r\nto be able to offer instances of this rare and interesting peculiarity\r\nto other universities and museums, but no improvement of the race could\r\nbe reached and I have been constrained to give it up. My twisted\r\nvalerian is a poor race, and hardly anything can be done with it.\r\nPerhaps, in other countries the corresponding rich race may be hidden\r\nsomewhere, but I have never had the good fortune of finding it.\r\n\r\nThis good fortune however, I did have with the wild teasel or _Dipsacus\r\nsylvestris_. [404] Stems of this and of allied species are often met\r\nwith and have been described by several writers, but they were always\r\nconsidered as accidents and nobody had ever tried to cultivate them. In\r\nthe summer of 1885 I saw among a lot of normal wild teasels, two nicely\r\ntwisted stems in the botanical garden of Amsterdam. I at once proposed\r\nto ascertain whether they would yield a hereditary race and had all the\r\nnormal individuals thrown away before the flowering time. My two plants\r\nflowered in this isolated condition and were richly pollinated by\r\ninsects. Of course, at that time, I knew nothing of the dependency of\r\nmonstrosities on external conditions, and made the mistake of sowing the\r\nseeds and cultivating the next generation in too great numbers on a\r\nsmall space. But nevertheless the anomaly was repeated, and the aberrant\r\nindividuals were once more isolated before flowering. The third\r\ngeneration repeated the second, but produced sixty twisted stems on some\r\n1,600 individuals. The result was very striking and quite sufficient for\r\nall further researches, but the normal condition of the race was not\r\nreached. This was the case only after I had discovered the bad effects\r\nof growing too many plants in a limited space. In the fourth generation\r\nI restricted my whole culture to about 100 individuals, and by this\r\nsimple [405] means at once got up to 34% of twisted stems. This\r\nproportion has since remained practically the same. I have selected and\r\nisolated my plants during five succeeding generations, but without any\r\nfurther result, the percentage of twisted stems fluctuating between 30\r\nand about 45 according to the size of the cultures and the favorableness\r\nor unfavorableness of the weather.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note that all depends on the question whether\r\none has the good fortune of finding a rich race or not, as this\r\npedigree-culture shows. Afterwards everything depends on treatment and\r\nvery little on selection. As soon as the treatment becomes adequate, the\r\nfull strength of the race at once displays itself, but afterwards no\r\nselection is able to improve it to any appreciable amount. Of course, in\r\nthe long run, the responses will be the same as those of the pistilloid\r\npoppies on the average, and some influence of selection will show itself\r\non closer scrutiny.\r\n\r\nCompared with the polycephalous poppies my race of twisted teasels is\r\nmuch richer in atavists. They are never absent, and always constitute a\r\nlarge part of each generation and each bed, comprising somewhat more\r\nthan half of the individuals. Intermediate stages between them and the\r\nwholly twisted stems are not wanting, [406] and a whole series of steps\r\nmay easily be observed from sufficiently large cultures. But they are\r\nalways relatively rare, and any lot of plants conveys the idea of a\r\ndimorphous race, the small twisted stems contrasting strongly with the\r\ntall straight ones.\r\n\r\nA sharper contrast between good representatives of a race and their\r\natavists is perhaps to be seen in no other instance. All the details\r\ncontribute to the differentiation in appearance. The whole stature of\r\nthe plants is affected by the varietal mark. The atavists are not, as in\r\nthe case of the poppies, obviously allied with the type by a full range\r\nof intermediate steps, but quite distant from it by their rarity. There\r\nseems to be a gap in the same way as between the striped flowers of the\r\nsnapdragon and their uniform red atavists, while with the poppies the\r\natavists may be viewed as being only the extremes of a series of\r\nvariations fluctuating around some average type.\r\n\r\nFrom this reason it is as interesting to appreciate the hereditary\r\nposition of the atavists of twisted varieties as it was for the\r\nred-flowered descendants of the striped flowers. In order to ascertain\r\nthis relation it is only necessary to isolate some of them during the\r\nblooming-period. I made this experiment in the summer of 1900 with the\r\neighth generation of my race, and contrived [407] to isolate three\r\ngroups of plants by the use of parchment bags, covering them\r\nalternately, so the flowers of only one group were accessible to\r\ninsects, at a time. I made three groups, because the atavists show two\r\ndifferent types. Some specimens have decussate stems, others bear all\r\ntheir leaves in whorls of three, but in respect to the hereditary\r\ntendency of the twisting character this difference does not seem to be\r\nof any importance.\r\n\r\nIn this way I got three lots of seeds and sowed enough of them to have\r\nthree groups of plants each containing about 150-200 well developed\r\nstems. Among these I counted the twisted individuals, and found nearly\r\nthe same numbers for all three. The twisted parents gave as many as 41%\r\ntwisted children, but the decussate atavists gave even somewhat more,\r\nviz., 44%, while the ternate specimens gave 37%. Obviously the\r\ndivergences between these figures are too slight to be dwelt upon, but\r\nthe fact that the atavists are as true or nearly as true inheritors of\r\nthe twisted race as the best selected individuals is clearly proved by\r\nthis experience.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that here we have a double race, including two types,\r\nwhich may be combined in different degrees. These combinations determine\r\na wide range of changes in the stature of the plants, and it seems\r\nhardly right to use the [408] same term for such changes as for common\r\nvariations. It is more a contention of opposite characters than a true\r\nphenomenon of simple variability. Or perhaps we might say that it is the\r\neffect of the cooperation of a very variable mark, the twisting, with a\r\nscarcely varying attribute of the normal structure of the stem. Between\r\nthe two types an endless diversity prevails, but outwardly there are\r\nlimits which are never transgressed. The double race is as permanent,\r\nand in this sense as constant, as any ordinary simple variety, both in\r\nexternal form, and in its intimate hereditary qualities.\r\n\r\nI have succeeded in discovering some other rich races of twisted plants.\r\nOne of them is the Sweet William (_Dianthus barbatus_), which yielded,\r\nafter isolation, in the second generation, 25% of individuals with\r\ntwisted stems, and as each individual produces often 10 and more stems,\r\nI had a harvest of more than half a thousand of instances of this\r\ncurious, and ordinarily very rare anomaly. My other race is a twisted\r\nvariety of _Viscaria oculata_, which is still in cultivation, as it has\r\nthe very consistent quality of being an annual. It yielded last summer\r\n(1903) as high a percentage as 65 of twisted individuals, many of them\r\nrepeating the monstrosity on several branches. After some occasional\r\nobservations _Gypsophila paniculata_ [409] seems to promise similar\r\nresults. On the other hand I have sowed in vain the seeds of twisted\r\nspecimens of the soapwort and the cleavewort (_Saponaria officinalis_\r\nand _Galium Aparine_). These and some others seem to belong to the same\r\ngroup as the valerian and to constitute only poor or so-called\r\nhalf-races.\r\n\r\nNext to the torsions come the fasciated stems. This is one of the most\r\ncommon of all malformations, and consists, in its ordinary form, of a\r\nflat ribbon-like expansion of the stems or branches. Below they are\r\ncylindrical, but they gradually lose this form and assume a flattened\r\ncondition. Sometimes the rate of growth is unequal on different portions\r\nor on the opposite sides of the ribbon, and curvatures are produced and\r\nthese often give to the fasciation a form that might be compared with a\r\nshepherd's crook. It is a common thing for fasciated branches and stems\r\nto divide at the summit into a number of subdivisions, and ordinarily\r\nthis splitting occurs in the lower part, sometimes dividing the entire\r\nfasciated portion. In biennial species the rosette of the root-leaves of\r\nthe first year may become changed by the monstrosity, the heart\r\nstretching in a transverse direction so as to become linear. In the next\r\nyear this line becomes the base from which the stem grows. In such cases\r\nthe fasciated stems [410] are broadened and flattened from the very\r\nbeginning, and often retain the incipient breadth throughout their\r\nfurther development. Species of primroses (_Primula japonica_ and\r\nothers), of buttercups (_Ranunculus bulbosus_), the rough hawksbeard\r\n(_Crepis biennis_), the Aster _Tripolium_, and many others could be\r\ngiven as instances.\r\n\r\nSome of these are so rare as to be considered as poor races, and in\r\ncultural trials do not produce the anomaly except in a very few\r\ninstances. Heads of rye are found in a cleft condition from time to\r\ntime, single at their base and double at the top, but this anomaly is\r\nonly exceptionally repeated from seed. Flattened stems of _Rubia\r\ntinctorum_ are not unfrequently met with on the fields, but they seem to\r\nhave as little hereditary tendency as the split rye (_Secale Cereale_).\r\nMany other instances could be given. Both in the native localities and\r\nin pedigree-cultures such ribboned stems are only seen from time to\r\ntime, in successive years, in annual and biennial as well as in\r\nperennial species. The purple pedicularis (_Pedicularis palustris_) in\r\nthe wild state, and the sunflower among cultivated plants, may be cited\r\ninstead of giving a long list of analogous instances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand rich races of flattened stems are not entirely\r\nlacking. They easily betray [411] themselves by the frequency of the\r\nanomaly, and therefore may be found, and tried in the garden. Under\r\nadequate cultivation they are here as rich in aberrant individuals as\r\nthe twisted races quoted above, producing in good years from 30-40% and\r\noften more instances. I have cultivated such rich races of the dandelion\r\n(_Taraxacum officinale_), of _Thrincia hirta_, of the dame's violet\r\n(_Hesperis matronalis_), of the hawkweed (_Picris hieracioides_), of the\r\nrough hawksbeard (_Crepis biennis_), and others.\r\n\r\nRespecting the hereditary tendencies these rich varieties with flattened\r\nstems may be put in the same category with the twisted races. Two points\r\nhowever, seem to be of especial interest and to deserve a separate\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe common cockscomb or _Celosia cristata_, one of the oldest and most\r\nwidely cultivated fasciated varieties may be used to illustrate the\r\nfirst point. In beds it is often to be seen in quite uniform lots of\r\nlarge and beautiful crests, but this uniformity is only secured by\r\ncareful culture and selection of the best individuals. In experimental\r\ntrials such selection must be avoided, and in doing so a wide range of\r\nvariability at once shows itself. Tall, branched stems with fan-shaped\r\ntops arise, constituting a series of steps towards complete atavism.\r\nThis last [412] however, is not to be reached easily. It often requires\r\nseveral successive generations grown from seed collected from the most\r\natavistic specimens. And even such selected strains are always reverting\r\nto the crested type. There is no transgression, no springing over into a\r\npurely atavistic form, such as may be supposed to have once been the\r\nancestor of the present cockscomb. The variety includes crests and\r\natavists, and may be perpetuated from both. Obviously every gardener\r\nwould select the seeds of the brightest crests, but with care the full\r\ncrests may be recovered, even from the worst reversionists in two or\r\nthree generations. It is a double race of quite the same constitution as\r\nthe twisted teasels.\r\n\r\nMy second point is a direct proof of this assertion, but made with a\r\nfasciated variety of a wild species. I took for my experiment the rough\r\nhawksbeard. In the summer of 1895 I isolated some atavists of the fifth\r\ngeneration of my race, which, by ordinary selection, gave in the average\r\nfrom 20-40% of fasciated stems. My isolated atavists bore abundant\r\nfruit, and from these I had the next year a set of some 350 plants, out\r\nof which about 20% had broadened and linear rosettes. This proportion\r\ncorresponds with the degree of inheritance which is shown in many years\r\nby the largest and strongest [413] fasciated stems. It strengthens our\r\nconclusion as to the innermost constitution of the double races or\r\never-sporting varieties.\r\n\r\nTwisted stems and fasciations are very striking monstrosities. But they\r\nare not very good for further investigation. They require too much space\r\nand too much care. The calculation of a single percentage requires the\r\ncounting of some hundreds of individuals, taking many square meters for\r\ntheir cultivation, and this, as my best races are biennial, during two\r\nyears. For this reason the countings must always be very limited, and\r\nselection is restrained to the most perfect specimens.\r\n\r\nNow the question arises, whether this mark is the best upon which to\r\nfound selection. This seems to be quite doubtful. In the experiments on\r\nthe heredity of the atavists, we have seen that they are, at least\r\noften, in no manner inferior to even the best inheritors of the race.\r\nThis suggests the idea that it is not at all certain that the visible\r\ncharacters of a given individual are a trustworthy measure of its value\r\nas to the transmission of the same character to the offspring. In other\r\nwords, we are confronted with the existence of two widely different\r\ngroups of characters in estimating the hereditary tendency. One is the\r\nvisible quality of the individuals and the other is the direct\r\nobservation [414] of the degree in which the attribute is transmitted.\r\nThese are by no means parallel, and seem in some sense to be nearly\r\nindependent of each other. The fact that the worst atavists may have the\r\nhighest percentage of varietal units seems to leave no room for another\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nDeveloping this line of thought, we gradually arrive at the conclusion\r\nthat the visible attribute of a varying individual is perhaps the most\r\nuntrustworthy and the most unreliable character for selection, even if\r\nit seems in many cases practically to be the only available one. The\r\ndirect determination of the degree of heredity itself is obviously\r\npreferable by far. This degree is expressed by the proportion of its\r\ninheritors among the offspring, and this figure therefore should be\r\nelevated to the highest rank, as a measure of the hereditary qualities.\r\nHenceforward we will designate it by the name of hereditary percentage.\r\n\r\nIn scientific experiments this figure must be determined for every plant\r\nof a pedigree-culture singly, and the selection should be founded\r\nexclusively or at least mainly on it. It is easily seen that this method\r\nrequires large numbers of individuals to be grown and counted. Some two\r\nor three hundred progeny of one plant are needed to give the decisive\r\nfigure for this one [415] individual, and selection requires the\r\ncomparison of at least fifty or more individuals. This brings the total\r\namount of specimens to be counted up to some tens of thousands. In\r\npractice, where important interests depend upon the experiments, such\r\nnumbers are usually employed and often exceeded, but for the culture of\r\nmonstrosities, other methods are to be sought in order to avoid these\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe idea suggests itself here that the younger the plants are, when\r\nshowing their distinguishing marks, the more of them may be grown on a\r\nsmall space. Hence the best way is to choose such attributes, as may\r\nalready be seen in the young seedlings, in the very first few weeks of\r\ntheir lives. Fortunately the seed-leaves themselves afford such\r\ndistinctive marks, and by this means the plants may be counted in the\r\npans, requiring no culture at all in the garden. Only the selected\r\nindividuals need be grown to ripen their seeds, and the whole selection\r\nmay be made in the spring, in the glasshouse. Instead of being very\r\ntroublesome, the determination of the hereditary percentages becomes a\r\ndefinite reduction of the size of the experiments. Moreover it may\r\neasily be effected by any one who cares for experimental studies, but\r\nhas not the means required for cultures on a larger scale. And lastly,\r\nthere are [416] a number of questions about heredity, periodicity,\r\ndependency on nourishment and other life conditions, and even about\r\nhybridizing, which may be answered by this new method.\r\n\r\nSeed-leaves show many deviations from the ordinary shape, especially in\r\ndicotyledonous plants. A very common aberration is the multiplication of\r\ntheir number, and three seed-leaves in a whorl are not rarely met with.\r\nThe whorl may even consist of four, and in rare cases of five or more\r\ncotyledons. Cleft cotyledons are also to be met with, and the fissure\r\nmay extend varying distances from the tips. Often all these deviations\r\nmay be seen among the seedlings of one lot, and then it is obvious that\r\ntogether they constitute a scale of cleavages, the ternate and\r\nquaternate whorls being only cases where the cleaving has reached its\r\ngreatest development. All in all it is manifest that here we are met by\r\none type of monstrosity, but that this type allows of a wide range of\r\nfluctuating variability. For brevity's sake all these cleft and ternate,\r\ndouble cleft and quaternate cotyledons and even the higher grades are\r\ncombined under one common name and indicated as tricotyls.\r\n\r\nA second aberration of young seed-plants is exactly opposite to this. It\r\nconsists of the union of the two seed-leaves into a single organ. This\r\nordinarily betrays its origin by [417] having two separate apices, but\r\nnot always. Such seedlings are called syncotyledonous or syncotyls.\r\nOther monstrosities have been observed from time to time, but need not\r\nbe mentioned here.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the determination of the hereditary percentage is\r\nvery easy in tricotylous or syncotylous cultures. The parent plants must\r\nbe carefully isolated while blooming. Many species pollinate themselves\r\nin the absence of bees; from these the insects are to be excluded.\r\nOthers have the stamens and stigmas widely separated and have to be\r\npollinated artificially. Still others do not lend themselves to such\r\noperations, but have to be left free to the visits of bees and of\r\nhumble-bees, this being the only means of securing seed from every\r\nplant. At the time of the harvest the seeds should be gathered\r\nseparately from each plant, and this precaution should also be observed\r\nin studies of the hereditary percentage at large, and in all scientific\r\npedigree-cultures. Every lot of seeds is to be sown in a separate pan,\r\nand care must be taken to sow such quantities the three to four hundred\r\nseedlings will arise from each. As soon as they display their\r\ncotyledons, they are counted, and the number is the criterion of the\r\nparent-plant. Only parent-plants with the highest percentages are\r\nselected, and out of [418] their seedlings some fifty or a hundred of\r\nthe best ones are chosen to furnish the seeds for the next generation.\r\n\r\nThis description of the method shows that the selection is a double one.\r\nThe first feature is the hereditary percentage. But then not all the\r\nseedlings of the selected parents can be planted out, and a choice has\r\nto be made. This second selection may favor the finest tricotyls, or the\r\nstrongest individuals, or rely on some other character, but is\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the description of the cultures. Starting points are the\r\nstray tricotyls which are occasionally found in ordinary sowings. In\r\norder to increase the chance of finding them, thousands of seeds of the\r\nsame species must be inspected, and the range of species must be widened\r\nas much as possible.\r\n\r\nMaterial for beginning such experiments is easily obtained, and almost\r\nany large sample of seeds will be found suitable. Some tricotyls will be\r\nfound among every thousand seedlings in many species, while in others\r\nten or a hundred times, as many plants must be examined to secure them,\r\nbut species with absolutely pure dicotylous seeds are very rare.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of the experiment, however, is not so promising. Some\r\nspecies are rich, and others are poor in this anomaly. This difference\r\n[419] often indicates what can be expected from further culture. Stray\r\ntricotyls point to poor species or half-races, while more frequent\r\ndeviations suggest rich or double-races. In both cases however, the\r\ntrial must be made, and this requires the isolation of the aberrant\r\nindividuals and the determination of their hereditary percentage.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the degree of their inheritance is only a very small\r\none. The isolated tricotyls yield 1 or 2% of inheritors, in some cases\r\neven less, or upwards up to 3 or 4%. If the experiment is repeated, no\r\namelioration is observed, and this result remains the same during a\r\nseries of successive generations. In the case of _Polygonum\r\nconvolvulus_, the Black bindweed, I have tried as many as six\r\ngenerations without ever obtaining more than 3%. With other species I\r\nhave limited myself to four successive years with the same negative\r\nresult, as with spinage, the Moldavian dragon-head, (_Dracocephalum\r\nmoldavicum_), and two species of corn catch-fly (_Silene conica_ and _S.\r\nconoidea_).\r\n\r\nSuch poor races hardly afford a desirable material for further\r\ninquiries. Happily the rich races, though rare, may be discovered also\r\nfrom time to time. They seem to be more common among cultivated plants\r\nand horticultural as well as agricultural species may be used. Hemp\r\n[420] and mercury (_Mercurialis annua_) among the first, snapdragon,\r\npoppies, _Phacelia_, _Helichrysum_, and _Clarkia_ among garden-flowers\r\nmay be given as instances of species containing the rich tricotylous\r\ndouble races.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note how strong the difference is between such\r\ncases and those which only yield poor races. The rich type at once\r\nbetrays itself. No repeated selection is required. The stray tricotyls\r\nthemselves, that are sought out from among the original samples, give\r\nhereditary percentages of a much higher type after isolation than those\r\nquoted above. They come up to 10-20% and in some cases even to 40%. As\r\nmay be expected, individual differences occur, and it must even be\r\nsupposed that some of the original tricotyls may not be pure, but\r\nhybrids between tricotylous and dicotylous parents. These are at once\r\neliminated by selection, and if only the tricotyls which have the\r\nhighest percentages are chosen for the continuance of the new race, the\r\nsecond generation comes up with equal numbers of dicotyls and tricotyls\r\namong the seedlings. The figures have been observed to range from 51-58%\r\nin the majority of the cases, and average 55%, rarely diverging somewhat\r\nmore from this average.\r\n\r\nHere we have the true type of an ever-sporting variety. Every year it\r\nproduces in the [421] same way heirs and atavists. Every plant, if\r\nfertilized with its own pollen, gives rise to both types. The parent\r\nitself may be tricotylous or dicotylous, or show any amount of\r\nmultiplication and cleavage in its seed-leaves, but it always gives the\r\nentire range among its progeny of the variation. One may even select the\r\natavists, pollinate them purely and repeat this in a succeeding\r\ngeneration without any chance of changing the result. On an average the\r\natavists may give lower hereditary figures, but the difference will be\r\nonly slight.\r\n\r\nSuch tricotylous double races offer highly interesting material for\r\ninquiries into questions of heredity, as they have such a wide range of\r\nvariability. There is little danger in asserting that they go upwards to\r\nnearly 100%, and downwards to 0%, diverging symmetrically on both sides\r\nof their average (50-55%). These limits they obviously cannot\r\ntransgress, and are not even able to reach them. Samples of seed\r\nconsisting only of tricotyls are very rare, and when they are met with\r\nthe presumption is that they are too few to betray the rare aberrants\r\nthey might otherwise contain. Experimental evidence can only be reached\r\nby the culture of a succeeding generation, and this always discloses the\r\nhidden qualities, showing that the double [422] type was only\r\ntemporarily lost, but bound to return as soon as new trials are made.\r\n\r\nThis wide range of variability between definite limits is coupled with a\r\nhigh degree of sensibility and adequateness to the most diverging\r\nexperiments. Our tricotylous double races are perhaps more sensitive to\r\nselection than any other variety, and equally dependent on outer\r\ncircumstances. Here, however, I will limit myself to a discussion of the\r\nformer point.\r\n\r\nIn the second generation after the isolation of stray tricotylous\r\nseedlings the average condition of the race is usually reached, but only\r\nby some of the strongest individuals, and if we continue the race,\r\nsowing or planting only from their offspring, the next generation will\r\nshow the ordinary type of variability, going upwards in some and\r\ndownwards in other instances. With the _Phacelia_ and the mercury and\r\nsome others I had the good luck in this one generation to reach as high\r\nas nearly 90% of tricotylous seedlings, a figure indicating that the\r\nnormal dicotylous type had already become rare in the race. In other\r\ncases 80% or nearly 80% was easily attained. Any further divergence from\r\nthe average would have required very much larger sowings, the effect of\r\nselection between a limited number of parents being only to retain the\r\nhigh degree once [423] reached; so for instance with the mercury, I had\r\nthree succeeding generations of selection after reaching the average of\r\n55%, but their extremes gave no increasing advance, remaining at 86, 92\r\nand 91%.\r\n\r\nIf we compare these results with the effects of selection in twisted and\r\nfasciated races, we observe a marked contrast. Here they reached their\r\nheight at 30-40%, and no number of generations had the power of making\r\nany further improvement. The tricotyls come up in two generations to a\r\nproportion of about 54%, which shows itself to correspond to the average\r\ntype. And as soon as this is reached, only one generation is required to\r\nobtain a very considerable improvement, going up to 80 or even 90%.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the cause of this difference does not lie in the\r\nnature of the monstrosity, but is due to the criterion upon which the\r\nselection is made. Selection of the apparently best individuals is one\r\nmethod, and it gives admirable results. Selection on the ground of the\r\nhereditary percentages is another method and gives results which are far\r\nmore advantageous than the former.\r\n\r\nIn the lecture on the pistillody of the poppies we limited ourselves to\r\nthe selection of the finest individuals and showed that there is always\r\na manifest correlation between the individual [424] strength of the\r\nplant and the degree of development of its anomaly. The same holds good\r\nwith other monstrosities, and badly nourished specimens of rich races\r\nwith twisted or fasciated stems always tend to reversion. This\r\nreversion, however, is not necessarily correlated with the hereditary\r\npercentage and therefore does not always indicate a lessening of the\r\ndegree of inheritance. This shows that even in those cases an\r\nimprovement may be expected, if only the means can be found to subject\r\nthe twisted and the fasciated races to the same sharp test as the\r\ntricotylous varieties.\r\n\r\nMuch remains to be done, and the principle of the selection of parents\r\naccording to the average constitution of their progeny seems to be one\r\nof the most promising in the whole realm of variability.\r\n\r\nBesides tricotylous, the syncotylous seedlings may be used in the same\r\nway. They are more rarely met with, and in most instances seem to belong\r\nonly to the unpromising half-races. The black bindweed (_Polygonum\r\nConvolvulus_), the jointed charlock (Raphanus Raphanistrum), the\r\nglaucous evening-primrose (_Oenothera glauca_) and many other plants\r\nseem to contain such half-races. On the other hand I found a plant of\r\n_Centranthus macrosiphon_ yielding as much as 55% of syncotylous\r\nchildren [425] and thereby evidently betraying the nature of a rich or\r\ndouble race. Likewise the mercury was rich in such deviations. But the\r\nbest of all was the Russian sunflower, and this was chosen for closer\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIn the year of 1888 I had the good luck to isolate some syncotylous\r\nseedlings and of finding among them one with 19% of inheritors among its\r\nseeds. The following generation at once surpassed the ordinary average\r\nand came up in three individuals to 76, 81 and even 89%. My race was at\r\nonce isolated and ameliorated by selection. I have tried to improve it\r\nfurther and selected the parents with the highest percentages during\r\nseven more generations; but without any remarkable result. I got figures\r\nof 90% and above, coming even in one instance up to the apparent purity\r\nof 100%. These, however, always remained extremes, the averages\r\nfluctuating yearly between 80-90% or thereabouts, and the other extremes\r\ngoing nearly every year downwards to 50%, the value which would be\r\nattained, if no selection were made.\r\n\r\nContra-selection is as easily made as normal selection. According to our\r\npresent principle it means the choice of the parents with the smallest\r\nhereditary percentage. One might easily imagine that by this means the\r\ndicotylous seedlings could be rendered pure. This, however, [426] is not\r\nat all the case. It is easy to return from so highly selected figures as\r\nfor instance 95% to the average about of 50%, as regression to\r\nmediocrity is always an easy matter. But to transgress this average on\r\nthe lower side seems to be as difficult as it is on the upper side. I\r\ncontinued the experiment during four succeeding generations, but was not\r\nable to go lower than about 10%, and could not even exclude the high\r\nfigures from my strain. Parents with 65-75% of syncotylous seedlings\r\nreturned in each generation, notwithstanding the most careful\r\ncontra-selection. The attribute is inherent in the race, and is not to\r\nbe eliminated by so simple a means as selection, nor even by a selection\r\non the ground of hereditary percentages.\r\n\r\nWe have dealt with torsions and fasciations and with seedling variations\r\nat some length, in order to point out the phases needing investigation\r\naccording to recent views. It would be quite superfluous to consider\r\nother anomalies in a similar manner, as they all obey the same laws. A\r\nhasty survey may suffice to show what prospects they offer to the\r\nstudent of nature.\r\n\r\nFirst of all come the variegated leaves. They are perhaps the most\r\nvariable of all variations. They are evidently dependent on external\r\ncircumstances, and by adequate nutrition the leaves may even become\r\nabsolutely white or [427] yellowish, with only scarcely perceptible\r\ntraces of green along the veins. Some are very old cultivated varieties,\r\nas the wintercress, or _Barbarea vulgaris_. They continuously sport into\r\ngreen, or return from this normal color, both by seeds and by buds.\r\nSports of this kind are very often seen on shrubs or low trees, and they\r\nmay remain there and develop during a long series of years. Bud-sports\r\nof variegated holly, elms, chestnuts, beeches and others might be cited.\r\nOne-sided variegation on leaves or twigs with the opposite side wholly\r\ngreen are by no means rare. It is very curious to note that variegation\r\nis perhaps the most universally known anomaly, while its hereditary\r\ntendencies are least known.\r\n\r\nCristate and plumose ferns are another instance. Half races or rare\r\naccidental cleavages seem to be as common with ferns as cultivated\r\ndouble races, which are very rich in beautiful crests. But much depends\r\non cultivation. It seems that the spores of crested leaves are more apt\r\nto reproduce the variety than those of normal leaves, or even of normal\r\nparts of the same leaves. But the experiments on which this assertion is\r\nmade are old and should be repeated. Other cases of cleft leaves should\r\nalso be tested. Ascidia are far more common than is usually believed.\r\nRare instances point [428] to poor races, but the magnolias and\r\nlime-trees are often so productive of ascidia as to suggest the idea of\r\never-sporting varieties. I have seen many hundred ascidia on one\r\nlime-tree, and far above a hundred on the magnolia. They differ widely\r\nin size and shape, including in some cases two leaves instead of one, or\r\nare composed of only half a leaf or of even still a smaller part of the\r\nsummit. Rich ascidia-bearing varieties seem to offer notable\r\nopportunities for scientific pedigree-cultures.\r\n\r\nUnion of the neighboring fruits and flowers on flower-heads, of the rays\r\nof the umbellifers or of the successive flowers of the racemes of\r\ncabbages and allied genera, seem to be rare. The same holds good for the\r\nadhesion of foliar to axial organs, of branches to stems and other cases\r\nof union. Many of these cases return regularly in each generation, or\r\nmay at least be seen from time to time in the same strains.\r\nProliferation of the inflorescence is very common and changes in the\r\nposition of staminate and pistillate flowers are not rare. We find\r\nstarting points for new investigations in almost any teratological\r\nstructure. Half-races and double-races are to be distinguished and\r\nisolated in all cases, and their hereditary qualities, the periodicity\r\nof the recurrence of the anomaly, the dependency on external\r\ncircumstances [429] and many other questions have to be answered.\r\n\r\nHere is a wide field for garden experiments easily made, which might\r\nultimately yield much valuable information on many questions of heredity\r\nof universal interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n[430]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XV\r\n\r\nDOUBLE ADAPTATIONS\r\n\r\nThe chief object of all experimentation is to obtain explanations of\r\nnatural phenomena. Experiments are a repetition of things occurring in\r\nnature with the conditions so guarded and so closely followed that it is\r\npossible to make a clear analysis of facts and their causes, it being\r\nrightfully assumed that the laws are the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nExperiments on heredity and the experience of the breeder find their\r\nanalogy in the succession of generations in the wild state. The\r\nstability of elementary species and of retrograde varieties is quite the\r\nsame under both conditions. Progression and retrogression are narrowly\r\nlinked everywhere, and the same laws govern the abundance of forms in\r\ncultivated and in wild plants.\r\n\r\nElementary species and retrograde varieties are easily recognizable.\r\nEver-sporting varieties on the contrary are far less obvious, and in\r\nmany cases their hereditary relations have [431] had to be studied anew.\r\nA clear analogy between them and corresponding types of wild plants has\r\nyet to be pointed out. There can be no doubt that such analogy exists;\r\nthe conception that they should be limited to cultivated plants is not\r\nprobable. Striped flowers and variegated leaves, changes of stamens into\r\ncarpels or into petals may be extremely rare in the wild state, but the\r\n\"five-leaved\" clover and a large number of monstrosities cannot be said\r\nto be typical of the cultivated condition. These, however, are of rare\r\noccurrence, and do not play any important part in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nIn order to attain a better solution of the problem we must take a\r\nbroader view of the facts. The wide range of variability of\r\never-sporting varieties is due to the presence of two antagonistic\r\ncharacters which cannot be evolved at the same time and in the same\r\norgan, because they exclude one another. Whenever one is active, the\r\nother must be latent. But latency is not absolute inactivity and may\r\noften only operate to encumber the evolution of the antagonistic\r\ncharacter, and to produce large numbers of lesser grades of its\r\ndevelopment. The antagonism however, is not such in the exact meaning of\r\nthe word; it is rather a mutual exclusion, because one of the opponents\r\nsimply takes the place of the other when absent, or supplements [432] it\r\nto the extent that it may be only imperfectly developed. This completion\r\nordinarily occurs in all possible degrees and thus causes the wide range\r\nof the variability. Nevertheless it may be wanting, and in the case of\r\nthe double stocks only the two extremes are present.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to get a clear conception of the substitution,\r\nand it seems necessary to designate the peculiar relationship between\r\nthe two characters forming such a pair by a simple name. They might be\r\ntermed alternating, if only it were clearly understood that the\r\nalternation may be complete, or incomplete in all degrees. Complete\r\nalternation would result in the extremes, the incomplete condition in\r\nthe intermediate states. In some cases as with the stocks, the first\r\nprevails, while in other cases, as with the poppies, the very extremes\r\nare only rarely met with.\r\n\r\nTaking such an alternation as a real character of the ever-sporting\r\nvarieties, a wide range of analogous cases is at once revealed among the\r\nnormal qualities of wild plants. Alternation is here almost universal.\r\nIt is the capacity of young organs to develop in two diverging\r\ndirections. The definitive choice must be made in extreme youth, or\r\noften at a relatively late period of development. Once made, this [433]\r\nchoice is final, and a further change does not occur in the normal\r\ncourse of things.\r\n\r\nThe most curious and most suggestive instance of such an alternation is\r\nthe case of the water-persicaria or _Polygonum amphibium_. It is known\r\nto occur in two forms, one aquatic and the other terrestrial. These are\r\nrecorded in systematic works as varieties, and are described under the\r\nnames of _P. amphibium_ var. _natans_ Moench, and _P. amphibium_ var.\r\n_terrestre_ Leers or _P. amphibium_ var. _terrestris_ Moench. Such\r\nauthorities as Koch in his German flora, and Grenier and Godron in their\r\nFrench flora agree in the conception of the two forms as varieties.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the two varieties may often be observed to sport\r\ninto one another. They are only branches of the same plant, grown under\r\ndifferent conditions. The aquatic form has floating or submerged stems\r\nwith oblong or elliptic leaves, which are glabrous and have long\r\npetioles. The terrestrial plants are erect, nearly simple, more or less\r\nhispid throughout, with lanceolate leaves and short petioles, often\r\nnearly sessile. The aquatic form flowers regularly, producing its\r\npeduncle at right angles from the floating stems, but the terrestrial\r\nspecimens are ordinarily seen without flower-spikes, which are but\r\nrarely met with, at least as far as my own experience goes. Intermediate\r\n[434] forms are very rare, perhaps wholly wanting, though in swamps the\r\nterrestrial plants may often vary widely in the direction of the\r\nfloating type.\r\n\r\nThat both types sport into each other has long been recognized in\r\nfield-observations, and has been the ground for the specific name of\r\n_amphibium_, though in this respect herbarium material seems usually to\r\nbe scant. The matter has recently been subjected to critical and\r\nexperimental studies by the Belgian botanist Massart, who has shown that\r\nby transplanting the forms into the alternate conditions, the change may\r\nalways be brought about artificially. If floating plants are established\r\non the shore they make ascending hairy stems, and if the terrestrial\r\nshoots are submerged, their buds grow into long and slack, aquatic\r\nstems. Even in such experiments, intermediates are rare, both types\r\nagreeing completely with the corresponding models in the wild state.\r\n\r\nAmong all the previously described cases of horticultural plants and\r\nmonstrosities there is no clearer case of an ever-sporting variety than\r\nthis one of the water-persicaria. The var. _terrestris_ sports into the\r\nvar. _natans_, and as often as the changing life conditions may require\r\nit. It is-true that ordinary sports occur without our discerning the\r\ncause and without [435] any relation to adaptation. This however is\r\npartly due to our lack of knowledge, and partly to the general rule that\r\nin nature only such sports as are useful are spared by natural\r\nselection, and what is useful we ordinarily term adaptive.\r\n\r\nAnother side of the question remains to be considered. The word variety,\r\nas is now becoming generally recognized, has no special meaning\r\nwhatever. But here it is assumed in the clearly defined sense of a\r\nsystematic variety, which includes all subdivisions of species. Such\r\nsubdivisions may be, from a biological point of view, elementary species\r\nand also be eversporting varieties. They may be retrograde varieties,\r\nand the two alternating types may be described as separate varieties.\r\n\r\nIt is readily granted that many writers would not willingly accept this\r\nconclusion. But it is simply impossible to avoid it. The two forms of\r\nthe water-persicaria must remain varieties, though they are only types\r\nof the different branches of a single plant.\r\n\r\nIf not, hundreds and perhaps thousands of analogous cases are at once\r\nexposed to doubt, and the whole conception of systematic varieties would\r\nhave to be thrown over. Biologists of course would have no objection to\r\nthis, but the student of the flora of any given country [436] or region\r\nrequires the systematic subdivisions and should always use his utmost\r\nefforts to keep them as they are. There is no intrinsic difficulty in\r\nthe statement that different parts of the same plant should constitute\r\ndifferent varieties.\r\n\r\nIn some cases different branches of the same plant have been described\r\nas species. So for instance with the climbing forms of figs. Under the\r\nname of _Ficus repens_ a fine little plant is quite commonly cultivated\r\nas a climber in flower baskets. It is never seen bearing figs. On the\r\nother hand a shrub of our hothouses called _Ficus stipulata_, is\r\ncultivated in pots and makes a small tree which produces quite large,\r\nthough non-edible figs. Now these two species are simply branches of the\r\nsame plant. If the _repens_ is allowed to climb up high along the walls\r\nof the hothouses, it will at last produce stipulate branches with the\r\ncorresponding fruits. _Ficus radicans_ is another climbing form,\r\ncorresponding to the shrub _Ficus ulmifolia_ of our glasshouses. And\r\nquite the same thing occurs with ivy, the climbing stems of which never\r\nflower, but always first produce erect and free branches with rhombic\r\nleaves. These branches have often been used as cuttings and yield little\r\nerect and richly flowering shrubs, which are known in [437] horticulture\r\nunder the varietal name of _Hedera Helix arborea_.\r\n\r\nManifestly this classification is as nearly right as that of the two\r\nvarieties of the water-persicaria. Going one step further, we meet with\r\nthe very interesting case of alpine plants. The vegetation of the higher\r\nregions of mountains is commonly called alpine, and the plants show a\r\nlarge number of common features, differentiating them from the flora of\r\nlower stations. The mountain plants have small and dense foliage, with\r\nlarge and brightly-colored flowers. The corresponding forms of the\r\nlowlands have longer and weaker stems, bearing their leaves at greater\r\ndistances, the leaves themselves being more numerous. The alpine forms,\r\nif perennial, have thick, strongly developed and densely branched\r\nrootstocks with heavy roots, in which a large amount of food material is\r\nstored up during the short summer, and is available during the long\r\nwinter months of the year.\r\n\r\nSome species are peculiar to such high altitudes, while many forms from\r\nthe lowlands have no corresponding type on the mountains. But a large\r\nnumber of species are common to both regions, and here the difference of\r\ncourse is most striking. _Lotus corniculatus_ and _Calamintha Acinos_,\r\n_Calluna vulgaris_ and _Campanula_ [438] _rotundifolia_ may be quoted as\r\ninstances, and every botanist who has visited alpine regions may add\r\nother examples. Even the edelweiss of the Swiss Alps, _Gnaphalium\r\nLeontopodium_, loses its alpine characters, if cultivated in lowland\r\ngardens. Between such lowland and alpine forms intermediates regularly\r\noccur. They may be met with whenever the range of the species extends\r\nfrom the plains upward to the limit of eternal snow.\r\n\r\nIn this case the systematists formerly enumerated the alpine plants as\r\n_forma alpestris_, but whenever the intermediate is lacking the term\r\n_Varietas alpestris_ was often made use of.\r\n\r\nIt is simply impossible to decide concerning the real relation between\r\nthe alpine and lowland types without experiments. About the middle of\r\nthe last century it was quite a common thing to collect plants not only\r\nfor herbarium-material, but also for the purpose of planting them in\r\ngardens and thus to observe their behavior under new conditions. This\r\nwas done with the acknowledged purpose of investigating the systematic\r\nsignificance of observed divergencies. Whenever these held good in the\r\ngarden they were considered to be reliable, but if they disappeared they\r\nwere regarded as the results of climatic conditions, or of the influence\r\nof soil or nourishment. Between [439] these two alternatives, many\r\nwriters have tried to decide, by transplanting their specimens after\r\nsome time in the garden, into arid or sandy soil, in order to see\r\nwhether they would resume their alpine character.\r\n\r\nAmong the systematists who tested plants in this way, Nageli especially,\r\ndirected his attention to the hawkweeds or _Hieracium_. On the Swiss\r\nAlps they are very small and exhibit all the characters of the pure\r\nalpine type. Thousands of single plants were cultivated by him in the\r\nbotanical garden of Munich, partly from seed and partly from introduced\r\nrootstocks. Here they at once assumed the tall stature of lowland forms.\r\nThe identical individual, which formerly bore small rosettes of basal\r\nleaves, with short and unbranched flower-stalks, became richly leaved\r\nand often produced quite a profusion of flower-heads on branched stems.\r\nIf then they were transplanted to arid sand, though remaining in the\r\nsame garden and also under the same climatic conditions they resumed\r\ntheir alpine characters. This proved nutrition to be the cause of the\r\nchange and not the climate.\r\n\r\nThe latest and most exact researches on this subject are due to Bonnier,\r\nwho has gone into all the details of the morphologic as well as of the\r\nphysiologic side of the problem. [440] His purpose was the study of\r\npartial variability under the influence of climate and soil. In every\r\nexperiment he started from a single individual, divided it into two\r\nparts and planted one half on a mountain and the other half on the\r\nplain. The garden cultures were made chiefly at Paris and Fontainebleau,\r\nthe alpine cultures partly in the Alps, partly in the Pyrenees. From\r\ntime to time the halved plants were compared with each other, and the\r\ncultures lasted, as a rule, during the lifetime of the individual, often\r\ncovering many years.\r\n\r\nThe common European frostweed or _Helianthemum vulgare_ will serve to\r\nillustrate his results. A large plant growing in the Pyrenees in an\r\naltitude of 2,400 meters was divided. One half was replanted on the same\r\nspot, and the other near Cadeac, at the base of the mountain range (740\r\nM.). In order to exclude the effect of a change of soil, a quantity of\r\nthe earth from the original locality was brought into the garden and the\r\nplant put therein. Further control experiments were made at Paris. As\r\nsoon as the two halved individuals commenced to grow and produced new\r\nshoots, the influence of the different climates made itself felt. On the\r\nmountain, the underground portions remained strong and dense, the leaves\r\nand internodes small and hairy, the flowering stems nearly [441]\r\nprocumbent, the flowers being large and of a deep yellow. At Cadeac and\r\nat Paris the whole plant changed at once, the shoots becoming elongated\r\nand loose, with broad and flattened, rather smooth leaves and numerous\r\npale-hued flowers. The anatomical structure exhibited corresponding\r\ndifferences, the intercellular spaces being small in the alpine plant\r\nand large in the one grown in the lowlands, the wood-tissues strong in\r\nthe first and weak in the second case.\r\n\r\nThe milfoil (_Achillea Millefolium_) served as a second example, and the\r\nexperiments were carried on in the same localities. The long and thick\r\nrootstocks of the alpine plant bearing short stems only with a few dense\r\ncorymbs contrasted markedly with the slender stems, loose foliage and\r\nrich groups of flowerheads of the lowland plant. The same differences,\r\nin inner and outer structures were observed in numerous instances,\r\nshowing that the alpine type in these cases is dependent on the climate,\r\nand that the capacity for assuming the antagonistic characters is\r\npresent in every individual of the species. The external conditions\r\ndecide which of them becomes active and which remains inactive, and the\r\ncase seems to be exactly parallel to that of the water-persicaria.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments of Bonnier the influence of the soil was, as a rule,\r\nexcluded by transplanting [442] part of the original earth with the\r\ntransplanted half of the plant. From this he concluded that the observed\r\nchanges were due to the inequality of the climate. This involved three\r\nmain factors, light, moisture and temperature. On the mountains the\r\nlight is more intense, the air drier and cooler. Control-experiments\r\nwere made on the mountains, depriving the plants of part of the light.\r\nIn various ways they were more or less shaded, and as a rule responded\r\nto this treatment in the same way as to transplantation to the plain\r\nbelow. Bonnier concluded that, though more than one factor takes part in\r\ninciting the morphologic changes, light is to be considered as the chief\r\nagency. The response is to be considered as a useful one, as the whole\r\nstructure of the alpine varieties is fitted to produce a large amount of\r\norganic material in a short time, which enables the plants to thrive\r\nduring the short summers and long winters of their elevated stations.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these studies on the influences of alpine climates,\r\nBonnier has investigated the internal structure of arctic plants, and\r\nmade a series of experiments on growth in continuous electric light. The\r\narctic climate is cold, but wet, and the structure of the leaves is\r\ncorrespondingly loose, though the plants become [443] as small as on the\r\nAlps. Continuous electric light had very curious effects; the plants\r\nbecame etiolated, as if growing in darkness, with the exception that\r\nthey assumed a deep green tinge. They showed more analogy with the\r\narctic than with the alpine type.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the soil often produces changes similar to that of\r\nclimate. This was shown by the above cited experiments of Nageli with\r\nthe hawkweeds, and may easily be controlled in other cases. The\r\nground-honeysuckle or _Lotus corniculatus_ grows in Holland partly on\r\nthe dry and sandy soil of the dunes, and occasionally in meadows. It is\r\nsmall and dense in the first case, with orange and often very darkly\r\ncolored petals, while it is loose and green in the meadows, with\r\nyellower flowers. Numerous analogous cases might be given. On mountain\r\nslopes in South Africa, and especially in Natal, a species of composite\r\nis found, which has been introduced into culture and is used as a\r\nhanging plant. It is called _Othonna crassifolia_ and has fleshy, nearly\r\ncylindrical leaves, and exactly mimics some of the crassulaceous\r\nspecies. On dry soil the leaves become shorter and thicker and assume a\r\nreddish tinge, the stems remain short and woody and bear their leaves in\r\ndense rosettes. On moist and rich garden-soil this aspect becomes [444]\r\nchanged at once, the stems grow longer and of a deeper green.\r\nIntermediates occur, but notwithstanding this the two extremes\r\nconstitute clearly antagonistic types.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the deserts is known to exhibit a similar divergent type.\r\nOr rather two types, one adapted to paucity of water, and the other to a\r\nstorage of fluid at one season in order to make use of it at other\r\ntimes, as is the case with the cactuses. Limiting ourselves to the\r\nalternate group, we observe a rich and dense branching, small and\r\ncompact leaves and extraordinarily long roots. Here the analogy with the\r\nalpine varieties is manifest, and the dryness of the soil evidently\r\naffects the plants in a similar way, as do the conditions of life in\r\nalpine regions. The question at once comes up as to whether here too we\r\nhave only instances of partial variability, and whether many of the\r\ntypical desert-species would lose their peculiar character by\r\ncultivation under ordinary conditions. The varieties of _Monardella\r\nmacrantha_, described by Hall, from the San Jacinto Mountain, Cal., are\r\nsuggestive of such an intimate analogy with the cases studied by\r\nBonnier, that it seems probable that they might yield similar results,\r\nif tested by the same method.\r\n\r\nLeaving now the description of these special [445] cases, we may resume\r\nour theoretical discussion of the subject, and try to get a clearer\r\ninsight into the analogy of ever-sporting varieties and the wild species\r\nquoted. All of them may be characterized by the general term of\r\ndimorphism. Two types are always present, though not in the same\r\nindividual or in the same organ. They exclude one another, and during\r\ntheir juvenile stage a decision is taken in one direction or in the\r\nother. Now, according to the theory of natural selection, wild species\r\ncan only retain useful or at least innocuous qualities, since all\r\nmutations in a wrong direction must perish sooner or later. Cultivated\r\nspecies on the other hand are known to be largely endowed with\r\nqualities, which would be detrimental in the wild condition.\r\nMonstrosities are equally injurious and could not hold their own if left\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nThese same principles may be applied to ever-sporting or antagonistic\r\npairs of characters. According to the theory of mutations such pairs may\r\nbe either useful or useless. But only the useful will stand further\r\ntest, and if they find suitable conditions will become specific or\r\nvarietal characters. On this conclusion it becomes at once clear, why\r\nnatural dimorphism is, as a rule, a very useful quality, while the\r\ncultivated dimorphous varieties [446] strike us as something unnatural.\r\nThe relation between cause and effect, is in truth other than it might\r\nseem to be at first view, but nevertheless it exists, and is of the\r\nhighest importance.\r\n\r\nFrom this same conclusion we may further deduce some explanation of the\r\nhereditary races characterized by monstrosities. It is quite evident\r\nthat the twisted teasels are inadequate for the struggle with their tall\r\ncongeners, or with the surrounding plants. Hence the conclusion that a\r\npure and exclusively twisted race would soon die out. The fact that such\r\nraces are not in existence finds its explanation in this circumstance,\r\nand therefore it does not prove the impossibility or even the\r\nimprobability that some time a pure twisted race might arise. If chance\r\nshould put such an accidental race in the hands of an experimenter, it\r\ncould be protected and preserved, and having no straight atavistic\r\nbranches, but being twisted in all its organs, might yield the most\r\ncurious conceivable monstrosity, surpassing even the celebrated dwarf\r\ntwisted shrubs of Japanese horticulturists.\r\n\r\nSuch varieties however, do not exist at present. The ordinary twisted\r\nraces on the other hand, are found in the wild state and have only to be\r\nisolated and cultivated to yield large numbers [447] of twisted\r\nindividuals. In nature they are able to maintain themselves during long\r\ncenturies, quite as well as normal species and varieties. But they owe\r\nthis quality entirely to their dimorphous character. A twisted race of\r\nteasels might consist of successive generations of tall atavistic\r\nindividuals, and produce yearly some twisted specimens, which might be\r\ndestroyed every time before ripening their seeds. Reasoning from the\r\nevidence available, and from analogous cases, the variety would, even\r\nunder such extreme circumstances, be able to last as long as any other\r\ngood variety or elementary species. And it seems to me that this\r\nexplanation makes clear how it is possible that varieties, which are\r\npotentially rich in their peculiar monstrosity, are discovered from time\r\nto time among plants when tested by experimental methods.\r\n\r\nGranting these conclusions, monstrosities on the one side, and\r\ndimorphous wild species on the other, constitute the most striking\r\nexamples of the inheritance of latent characters.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the phenomena of dimorphism upon the principles of\r\nevolution formulated by Lamarck, and modified by his followers to\r\nconstitute Neo-Lamarckianism, remains to be considered. Lamarck assumed\r\nthat the external conditions directly affected the organisms in [448]\r\nsuch a way as to make them better adapted to life, under prevailing\r\ncircumstances. Nageli gave to this conception the name \"Theory of direct\r\ncausation\" (Theorie der directen Bewirkung), and it has received the\r\napproval of Von Wettstein, Strasburger and other German investigators.\r\nAccording to this conception a plant, when migrating from lowlands into\r\nthe mountains would slowly be changed and gradually assume alpine\r\nhabits. Once acquired this habit would become fixed and attain the rank\r\nof specific characters. In testing this theory by field-observations and\r\nculture-experiments, the defenders of the Nagelian principle could\r\neasily produce evidence upon the first point. The change of\r\nlowland-plants into alpine varieties can be brought about in numerous\r\ncases, and corresponding changes under the influence of soil, or\r\nclimate, or life-conditions are on record for the most various\r\ncharacters and qualities.\r\n\r\nThe second point, however, is as difficult to prove as the first is of\r\neasy treatment. If after hundreds and thousands of years of exposure to\r\nalpine or other extreme conditions a fixed change is proved to have\r\ntaken place, the question remains unanswered, whether the change has\r\nbeen a gradual or a sudden one. Darwin pointed out that long periods of\r\nlife afford a [449] chance for a sudden change in the desired direction,\r\nas well as for the slow accumulation of slight deviations. Any mutations\r\nin a wrong direction would at once be destroyed, but an accidental\r\nchange in a useful way would be preserved, and multiply itself. If in\r\nthe course of centuries this occurred, they would be nearly sure to\r\nbecome established, however rare at the outset. Hence the positive\r\nassertion is scarcely capable of direct proof.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the negative assertion must be granted full\r\nsignificance. If the alpine climate has done no more than produce a\r\ntransitory change, it is clear that thousands of years do not,\r\nnecessarily, cause constant and specific alterations. This requirement\r\nis one of the indispensable supports of the Lamarckian theory. The\r\nmatter is capable of disproof however, and such disproof seems to be\r\nafforded by the direct evidence of the present condition of the alpine\r\nvarieties at large, and by many other similar cases.\r\n\r\nAmong these the observations of Holtermann on some desert-plants of\r\nCeylon are of the highest value. Moreover they touch questions which are\r\nof wide importance for the study of the biology of American deserts. For\r\nthis reason I may be allowed to introduce them here at some length.\r\n\r\n[450] The desert of Kaits, in Northern Ceylon, nourishes on its dry and\r\ntorrid sands some species, represented by a large number of individuals,\r\ntogether with some rarer plants. The commonest forms are _Erigeron\r\nAsteroides_, _Vernonia cinerea_, _Laurea pinnatifida_, _Vicoa\r\nauriculata_, _Heylandia latebrosa_ and _Chrysopogon montanus_. In direct\r\ncontrast with the ordinary desert-types they have a thin epidermis, with\r\nexposed stomata, features that ordinarily were characteristic of species\r\nof moister regions. They are annuals, growing rapidly, blooming and\r\nripening their seeds before the height of the dry season. Evidently they\r\nare to be considered as the remainder of the flora of a previous period,\r\nwhen the soil had not yet become arid. They might be called relics. Of\r\ncourse they are small and dwarf-like, when compared with allied forms.\r\n\r\nThese curious little desert-plants disprove the Nagelian views in two\r\nimportant points. First, they show that extreme conditions do not\r\nnecessarily change the organisms subjected to them, in a desirable\r\ndirection. During the many centuries that these plants must have existed\r\nin the desert in annual generations, no single feature in the anatomical\r\nstructure has become changed. Hence the conclusion that small leaves,\r\nabundant rootstocks and short [451] stems, a dense foliage, a strongly\r\ncuticularized epidermis, few and narrow air-cavities in the tissues and\r\nall the long range of characteristics of typical desert-plants are not a\r\nsimple result of the influence of climate and soil. There is no direct\r\ninfluence in this sense.\r\n\r\nThe second point, in which Nageli's idea is broken down by Holtermann's\r\nobservations, results from the behavior of the plants of the Kaits\r\ndesert when grown or sown on garden soil. When treated in this way they\r\nat once lose the only peculiarity which might be considered as a\r\nconsequence of the desert-life of their ancestors, their dwarf stature.\r\nThey behave exactly like the alpine plants in Bonnier's experiments, and\r\nwith even more striking differences. In the desert they attain a height\r\nof a few centimeters, but in the garden they attain half a meter and\r\nmore in height. Nothing in the way of stability has resulted from the\r\naction of the dry soil, not even in such a minor point as the height of\r\nthe stems.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts and discussions we may conclude that double adaptation is\r\nnot induced by external influences, at least not in any way in which it\r\nmight be of use to the plant. It may arise by some unknown cause, or may\r\nnot be incited at all. In the first case the plant becomes capable of\r\nliving under the alternating [452] circumstances, and if growing near\r\nthe limits of such regions it will overlap and get into the new area.\r\nAll other species, which did not acquire the double habit, are of course\r\nexcluded, with such curious exceptions as those of Kaits. The typical\r\nvegetation under such extreme conditions however, finds explanation\r\nquite as well by the one as by the other view.\r\n\r\nLeaving these obvious cases of double adaptation, there still remains\r\none point to be considered. It is the dwarf stature of so many desert\r\nand alpine plants. Are these dwarfs only the extremes of the normal\r\nfluctuating variability, or is their stature to be regarded as the\r\nexpression of some peculiar adaptive but latent quality? It is as yet\r\ndifficult to decide this question, because statistical studies of this\r\nform of variability are still wanting. The capacity of ripening the seed\r\non individuals of dwarf stature however, is not at all a universal\r\naccompaniment of a variable height. Hence it cannot be considered as a\r\nnecessary consequence of it. On the other hand the dwarf varieties of\r\nnumerous garden-plants, as for instance: of larkspurs, snapdragon,\r\nopium-poppies and others are quite stable and thence are obviously due\r\nto peculiar characteristics. Such characteristics, if combined with tall\r\nstature into a pair of antagonists, would yield a double [453]\r\nadaptation, and on such a base a hypothetical explanation could no doubt\r\nbe rested. Instead of discussing this problem from the theoretical side,\r\nI prefer to compare those species which are capable of assuming a dwarf\r\nstature under less uncommon conditions than those of alpine and\r\ndesert-plants. Many weeds of our gardens and many wild species have this\r\ncapacity. They become very tall, with large leaves, richly branched\r\nstems and numerous flowers in moist and rich soil. On bad soil, or if\r\ngerminating too late, when the season is drier, they remain very small,\r\nproducing only a few leaves and often limiting themselves to one\r\nflower-head. This is often seen with thorn-apples and amaranths, and\r\neven with oats and rye, and is notoriously the case with buckwheat.\r\nGauchery has observed that the extremes differ often as much from one\r\nanother as 1:10. In the case of the Canadian horseweed or _Erigeron\r\ncanadensis_, which is widely naturalized in Europe, the tallest\r\nspecimens are often twenty-five times as tall as the smallest, the\r\ndifference increasing to greater extremes, if besides the main stem, the\r\nlength of the numerous branches of the tall plants are taken into\r\nconsideration. Other instances studied by the French investigator are\r\n_Erythraea pulchella_ and _Calamintha Acinos_.\r\n\r\n[454] Dimorphism is of universal occurrence in the whole vegetable\r\nkingdom. In some cases it is typical, and may easily be discerned from\r\nextreme fluctuating variability. In others the contrast is not at all\r\nobvious, and a closer investigation is needed to decide between the two\r\npossibilities. Sometimes the adaptive quality is evident, in other cases\r\nit is not. A large number of plants bear two kinds of leaves linked with\r\none another by intermediate forms. Often the first leaves of a shoot, or\r\nthose of accidentally strong shoots, exhibit deviating shapes, and the\r\nusefulness of such occurrences seems to be quite doubtful. The\r\nelongation of stems and linear leaves, and the reduction of lateral\r\norgans in darkness, is manifestly an adaptation. Many plants have\r\nstolons with double adaptations which enable them to retain their\r\ncharacter of underground stems with bracts or to exchange it for the\r\ncharacteristics of erect stems with green leaves according to the outer\r\ncircumstances. In some shrubs and trees the capacity of a number of buds\r\nto produce either flowers or shoots with leaves seems to be in the same\r\ncondition. The capacity of producing spines is also a double adaptation,\r\nactive on dry and arid soil and latent in a moist climate or under\r\ncultivation, as with the wild and cultivated apple, and in the\r\nexperiments of Lothelier [455] with _Berberis_, _Lycium_ and other\r\nspecies, which lose their spines in damp air.\r\n\r\nIn some conifers the evolution of horizontal branches may be modified by\r\nsimply turning the buds upside down. Or the lateral branches can be\r\ninduced to become erect stems by cutting off the normal summit of a\r\ntree. Numerous organs and functions lie dormant until aroused by\r\nexternal agencies, and many other cases could be cited, showing the wide\r\noccurrence of double adaptation.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two points, which should not be passed over without\r\nsome mention. One of them is the influence of sun and shade on leaves,\r\nand the other the atavistic forms, often exhibited during the juvenile\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of many plants, and especially those of some shrubs and\r\ntrees, have the capacity of adapting themselves either to intense or to\r\ndiffuse light. On the circumference of the crown of a tree the light is\r\nstronger and the leaves a small and thick, with a dense tissue. In the\r\ninner parts of the crown the light is weak and the leaves are broader in\r\norder to get as much of it as possible. They become larger but thinner,\r\nconsisting often of a small number of cell layers. The definitive\r\nformation is made in extreme youth, often even during the previous\r\nsummer, at the time of the [456] very first evolution of the young\r\norgans within the buds. _Iris_, and _Lactuca Scariola_ or the prickly\r\nlettuce, and many other plants afford similar instances. As the\r\ndefinitive decision must be made in these cases long before the direct\r\ninfluence of the conditions which would make the change useful is felt,\r\nit is hardly conceivable how they could be ascribed to this cause.\r\n\r\nIt is universally known that many plants show deviating features when\r\nvery young, and that these often remind us of the characters of their\r\nprobable ancestors. Many plants that must have been derived from their\r\nnearest systematic relatives, chiefly by reductions, are constantly\r\nbetraying this relation by a repetition of the ancestral marks during\r\ntheir youth.\r\n\r\nThere can be hardly a doubt that the general law of natural selection\r\nprevails in such cases as it does in others. Or stated otherwise, it is\r\nvery probable, that in most cases the atavistic characters have been\r\nretained during youth because of their temporary usefulness.\r\nUnfortunately, our knowledge of utility of qualities is as yet, very\r\nincomplete. Here we must assume that what is ordinarily spared by\r\nnatural selection is to be considered as useful, [457] until direct\r\nexperimental investigations have been made.\r\n\r\nSo it is for instance with the submerged leaves of water-plants. As a\r\nrule they are linear, or if compound, are reduced to densely branching\r\nfiliform threads. Hence we may conclude that this structure is of some\r\nuse to them. Now two European and some corresponding American species of\r\nwater-parsnip, the _Sium latifolium_ and _Berula angustifolia_ with\r\ntheir allies, are umbellifers, which bear pinnate instead of bi- or\r\ntri-pinnate leaves. But the young plants and even the young shoots when\r\ndeveloping from the rootstocks under water comply with the above rule,\r\nproducing very compound, finely and pectinately dissected leaves. From a\r\nsystematic point of view these leaves indicate the origin of the\r\nwater-parsnips from ordinary umbellifers, which generally have bi- and\r\ntripinnate leaves.\r\n\r\nSimilar cases of double adaptation, dependent on external conditions at\r\ndifferent periods of the evolution of the plant are very numerous. They\r\nare most marked among leguminous plants, as shown by the trifoliolate\r\nleaves of the thorn-broom and allies, which in the adult state have\r\ngreen twigs destitute of leaves.\r\n\r\nAs an additional instance of dimorphism and probable double adaptation\r\nto unrecognized external [458] conditions I might point to the genus\r\n_Acacia_. As we have seen in a previous lecture some of the numerous\r\nspecies of this genus bear bi-pinnate leaves, while others have only\r\nflattened leaf-stalks. According to the prevailing systematic\r\nconceptions, the last must have been derived from the first by the loss\r\nof the blades and the corresponding increase of size and superficial\r\nextension of the stalk. In proof of this view they exhibit, as we have\r\ndescribed, the ancestral characters in the young plantlets, and this\r\nproduction of bi-pinnate leaves has probably been retained at the period\r\nof the corresponding negative mutations, because of some distinct,\r\nthough still unknown use.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results of this discussion, we may state that useful\r\ndimorphism, or double adaptation, is a substitution of characters quite\r\nanalogous to the useless dimorphism of cultivated ever-sporting\r\nvarieties and the stray occurrence of hereditary monstrosities. The same\r\nlaws and conditions prevail in both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[459]\r\n\r\nE. MUTATIONS\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVI\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE PELORIC TOAD-FLAX\r\n\r\nI have tried to show previously that species, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word, consist of distinct groups of units. In systematic works these\r\ngroups are all designated by the name of varieties, but it is usually\r\ngranted that the units of the system are not always of the same value.\r\nHence we have distinguished between elementary species and varieties\r\nproper. The first are combined into species whose common original type\r\nis now lost or unknown, and from their characters is derived an\r\nhypothetical image of what the common ancestor is supposed to have been.\r\nThe varieties proper are derived in most cases from still existing\r\ntypes, and therefore are subjoined to them. A closer investigation has\r\nshown that this derivation is ordinarily produced by the loss of some\r\ndefinite attribute, or by the re-acquisition of an apparently [460] lost\r\ncharacter. The elementary species, on the other hand, must have arisen\r\nby the production of new qualities, each new acquisition constituting\r\nthe origin of a new elementary form.\r\n\r\nMoreover we have seen, that such improvements and such losses constitute\r\nsharp limits between the single unit-forms. Every type, of course,\r\nvaries around an average, and the extremes of one form may sometimes\r\nreach or even overlap those of the nearest allies, but the offspring of\r\nthe extremes always return to the type. The transgression is only\r\ntemporary and a real transition of one form to another does not come\r\nwithin ordinary features of fluctuating variability. Even in the cases\r\nof eversporting varieties, where two opposite types are united within\r\none race, and where the succeeding individuals are continually swinging\r\nfrom one extreme to the other, passing through a wide range of\r\nintermediate steps, the limits of the variety are as sharply defined and\r\nas free from real transgression as in any other form.\r\n\r\nIn a complete systematic enumeration of the real units of nature, the\r\nelementary species and varieties are thus observed to be discontinuous\r\nand separated by definite gaps. Every unit may have its youth, may lead\r\na long life in the adult state and may finally die. But through [461]\r\nthe whole period of its existence it remains the same, at the end as\r\nsharply defined from its nearest allies as in the beginning. Should some\r\nof the units die out, the gaps between the neighboring ones will become\r\nwider, as must often have been the case. Such segregations, however\r\nimportant and useful for systematic distinctions, are evidently only of\r\nsecondary value, when considering the real nature of the units\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe may now take up the other side of the problem. The question arises as\r\nto how species and varieties have originated. According to the Darwinian\r\ntheory they have been produced from one another, the more highly\r\ndifferentiated ones from the simpler, in a graduated series from the\r\nmost simple forms to the most complicated and most highly organized\r\nexisting types. This evolution of course must have been regular and\r\ncontinuous, diverging from time to time into new directions, and linking\r\nall organisms together into one common pedigree. All lacunae in our\r\npresent system are explained by Darwin as due to the extinction of the\r\nforms, which previously filled them.\r\n\r\nSince Lamarck first propounded the conception of a common origin for all\r\nliving beings, much has been done to clear up our ideas as to the real\r\nnature of this process. The broader [462] aspect of the subject,\r\nincluding the general pedigree of the animal and vegetable kingdom, may\r\nbe said to have been outlined by Darwin and his followers, but this\r\nphase of the subject lies beyond the limits of our present discussion.\r\n\r\nThe other phase of the problem is concerned with the manner in which the\r\nsingle elementary species and varieties have sprung from one another.\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that the world is reaching the end of its\r\ndevelopment, and so we are to infer that the production of new species\r\nand varieties is still going on. In reality, new forms are observed to\r\noriginate from time to time, both wild and in cultivation, and such\r\nfacts do not leave any doubt as to their origin from other allied types,\r\nand according to natural and general laws.\r\n\r\nIn the wild state however, and even with cultivated plants of the field\r\nand garden, the conditions, though allowing of the immediate observation\r\nof the origination of new forms, are by no means favorable for a closer\r\ninquiry into the real nature of the process. Therefore I shall postpone\r\nthe discussion of the facts till another lecture, as their bearing will\r\nbe more easily understood after having dealt with more complete cases.\r\n\r\nThese can only be obtained by direct experimentation. Comparative\r\nstudies, of course, [463] are valuable for the elucidation of general\r\nproblems and broad features of the whole pedigree, but the narrower and\r\nmore practical question as to the genetic relation of the single forms\r\nto one another must be studied in another way, by direct experiment. The\r\nexact methods of the laboratory must be used, and in this case the\r\ngarden is the laboratory. The cultures must be guarded with the\r\nstrictest care and every precaution taken to exclude opportunities for\r\nerror. The parents and grandparents and their offspring must be kept\r\npure and under control, and all facts bearing upon the birth or origin\r\nof the new types should be carefully recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo great difficulties have of late stood in the way of such\r\nexperimental investigation. One of them is of a theoretical, the, other\r\nof a practical nature. One is the general belief in the supposed\r\nslowness of the process, the other is the choice of adequate material\r\nfor experimental purposes. Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection as\r\nthe means by which new types arise, is now being generally interpreted\r\nas stating the slow transformation of ordinary fluctuating divergencies\r\nfrom the average type into specific differences. But in doing so it is\r\noverlooked that Quetelet's law of fluctuating variability was not yet\r\ndiscovered at the time, when Darwin propounded his theory. So there\r\n[464] is no real and intimate connection between these two great\r\nconceptions. Darwin frequently pointed out that a long period of time\r\nmight be needed for slow improvements, and was also a condition for the\r\noccurrence of rare sports. In any case those writers have been in error,\r\naccording to my opinion, who have refrained from experimental work on\r\nthe origin of species, on account of this narrow interpretation of\r\nDarwin's views. The choice of the material is quite another question,\r\nand obviously all depends upon this choice. Promising instances must be\r\nsought for, but as a rule the best way is to test as many plants as\r\npossible. Many of them may show nothing of interest, but some might lead\r\nto the desired end.\r\n\r\nFor to-day's lecture I have chosen an instance, in which the grounds\r\nupon which the choice was based are very evident. It is the origin of\r\nthe peloric toad-flax (_Linaria vulgaris peloria_).\r\n\r\nThe ground for this choice lies simply in the fact that the peloric\r\ntoad-flax is known to have originated from the ordinary type at\r\ndifferent times and in different countries, under more or less divergent\r\nconditions. It had arisen from time to time, and hence I presumed that\r\nthere was a chance to see it arise again. If this should happen under\r\nexperimental circumstances [465] the desired evidence might easily be\r\ngathered. Or, to put it in other words, we must try to arrange things so\r\nas to be present at the time when nature produces another of these rare\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThere was still another reason for choosing this plant for observational\r\nwork. The step from the ordinary toad-flax to the peloric form is short,\r\nand it appears as if it might be produced by slow conversion. The\r\nordinary species produces from time to time stray peloric flowers. These\r\noccur at the base of the raceme, or rarely in the midst of it. In other\r\nspecies they are often seen at the summit. Terminal pelories are usually\r\nregular, having five equal spurs. Lateral pelories are generally of\r\nzygomorphic structure, though of course in a less degree than the normal\r\nbilabiate flowers, but they have unequal spurs, the middle one being of\r\nthe ordinary length, the two neighboring being shorter, and those\r\nstanding next to the opposite side of the flower being the shortest of\r\nall. This curious remainder of the original, symmetrical structure of\r\nthe flower seems to have been overlooked hitherto by the investigators\r\nof peloric toad-flaxes.\r\n\r\nThe peloric variety of this plant is characterized by its producing only\r\npeloric flowers. No single bilabiate or one-spurred flower remains.\r\n\r\n[466] I once had a lot of nearly a hundred specimens of this fine\r\nvariety, and it was a most curious and beautiful sight to observe the\r\nmany thousands of nearly regular flowers blooming at the same time. Some\r\ndegree of variability was of course present, even in a large measure.\r\nThe number of the spurs varied between four and six, transgressing these\r\nlimits in some instances, but never so far as to produce really\r\none-spurred flowers. Comparing this variety with the ordinary type, two\r\nways of passing over from the one to the other might be imagined. One\r\nwould entail a slow increase of the number of the peloric flowers on\r\neach plant, combined with a decrease of the number of the normal ones,\r\nthe other a sudden leap from one extreme to the other without any\r\nintermediate steps. The latter might easily be overlooked in field\r\nobservations and their failure may not have the value of direct proof.\r\nThey could never be overlooked, on the other hand, in experimental\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe first record of the peloric toad-flax is that of Zioberg, a student\r\nof Linnaeus, who found it in the neighborhood of Upsala. This curious\r\ndiscovery was described by Rudberg in his dissertation in the year 1744.\r\nSoon afterwards other localities were discovered by Link near Gottingen\r\nin Germany about 1791 and afterwards [467] in the vicinity of Berlin, as\r\nstated by Ratzeburg, 1825. Many other localities have since been\r\nindicated for it in Europe, and in my own country some have been noted\r\nof late, as for instance near Zandvoort in 1874 and near Oldenzaal in\r\n1896. In both these last named cases the peloric form arose\r\nspontaneously in places which had often been visited by botanists before\r\nthe recorded appearance, and therefore, without any doubt, they must\r\nhave been produced directly and independently by the ordinary species\r\nwhich grows in the locality. The same holds good for other occurrences\r\nof it. In many instances the variety has been recorded to disappear\r\nafter a certain lapse of time, the original specimens dying out and no\r\nnew ones being produced. _Linaria_ is a perennial herb, multiplying\r\nitself easily by buds growing on the roots, but even with this means of\r\npropagation its duration seems to have definite limits.\r\n\r\nThere is one other important point arguing strongly for the independent\r\nappearance of the peloric form in its several localities. It is the\r\ndifficulty of fertilization and the high degree of sterility, even if\r\nartificially pollinated. Bees and bumble-bees are unable to crawl into\r\nthe narrow tubular flowers, and to bring the fertilizing pollen to the\r\nstigma. Ripe capsules with seeds [468] have never been seen in the wild\r\nstate. The only writer who succeeded in sowing seeds of the peloric\r\nvariety was Wildenow and he got only very few seedlings. But even in\r\nartificial pollination the result is the same, the anthers seeming to be\r\nseriously affected by the change. I tried both self-fertilization and\r\ncross-pollination, and only with utmost care did I succeed in saving\r\nbarely a hundred seeds. In order to obtain them I was compelled to\r\noperate on more than a thousand flowers on about a dozen peloric plants.\r\n\r\nThe variety being wholly barren in nature, the assumption that the\r\nplants in the different recorded localities might have a common origin\r\nis at once excluded. There must have been at least nearly as many\r\nmutations as localities. This strengthens the hope of seeing such a\r\nmutation happen in one's own garden. It should also be remembered that\r\npeloric flowers are known to have originated in quite a number of\r\ndifferent species of _Linaria_, and also with many of the allied species\r\nwithin the range of the Labiatiflorae.\r\n\r\nI will now give the description of my own experiment. Of course this did\r\nnot give the expected result in the first year. On the contrary, it was\r\nonly after eight years' work that I had the good fortune of observing\r\nthe mutation. [469] But as the whole life-history of the preceding\r\ngenerations had been carefully observed and recorded, the exact\r\ninterpretation of the fact was readily made.\r\n\r\nMy culture commenced in the year 1886. I chose some plants of the normal\r\ntype with one or two peloric flowers besides the bilabiate majority\r\nwhich I found on a locality in the neighborhood of Hilversum in Holland.\r\nI planted the roots in my garden and from them had the first flowering\r\ngeneration in the following summer. From their seeds I grew the second\r\ngeneration in three following years. They flowered profusely and\r\nproduced in 1889 only one, and in 1890 only two peloric structures. I\r\nsaved the seeds in 1889 and had in 1890-1891 the third generation. These\r\nplants likewise flowered only in the second year, and gave among some\r\nthousands of symmetrical blossoms, only one five-spurred flower. I\r\npollinated this flower myself, and it produced abundant fruit with\r\nenough seeds for the entire culture in 1892, and they only were sown.\r\n\r\nUntil this year my generations required two years each, owing to the\r\nperennial habit of the plants. In this way the prospects of the culture\r\nbegan to decrease, and I proposed to try to heighten my chances by\r\nhaving a new generation yearly. With this intention I sowed the [470]\r\nselected seeds in a pan in the glasshouse of my laboratory and planted\r\nthem out as soon as the young stems had reached a length of some few\r\ncentimeters. Each seedling was put in a separate pot, in heavily manured\r\nsoil. The pots were kept under glass until the beginning of June, and\r\nthe young plants produced during this period a number of secondary stems\r\nfrom the curious hypocotylous buds which are so characteristic of the\r\nspecies. These stems grew rapidly and as soon as they were strong\r\nenough, the plants were put into the beds. They all, at least nearly\r\nall, some twenty specimens, flowered in the following month.\r\n\r\nI observed only one peloric flower among the large number present. I\r\ntook the plant bearing this flower and one more for the culture of the\r\nfollowing year, and destroyed all others. These two plants grew on the\r\nsame spot, and were allowed to fertilize each other by the agency of the\r\nbees, but were kept isolated from any other congener. They flowered\r\nabundantly, but produced only one-spurred bilabiate flowers during the\r\nwhole summer. They matured more than 10 cu. cm. of seeds.\r\n\r\nIt is from this pair of plants that my peloric race has sprung. And as\r\nthey are the ancestors of the first closely observed case of peloric\r\nmutation, [471] it seems worth while to give some details regarding\r\ntheir fertilization.\r\n\r\nIsolated plants of _Linaria vulgaris_ do not produce seed, even if\r\nfreely pollinated by bees. Pollen from other plants is required. This\r\nrequirement is not at all restricted to the genus _Linaria_, as many\r\ninstances are known to occur in different families. It is generally\r\nassumed that the pollen of any other individual of the same species is\r\ncapable of producing fertilization, although it is to be said that a\r\ncritical examination has been made in but few instances.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the case, at least not in the present instance. I\r\nhave pollinated a number of plants, grown from seed of the same strain\r\nand combined them in pairs, and excluded the visits of insects, and\r\npollen other than that of the plant itself and that of the specimen with\r\nwhich it was paired. The result was that some pairs were fertile and\r\nothers barren. Counting these two groups of pairs, I found them nearly\r\nequal in number, indicating thereby that for any given individual the\r\npollen of half of the others is potent, but that of the other half\r\nimpotent. From these facts we may conclude the presence of a curious\r\ncase of dimorphy, analogous to that proposed for the primroses, but\r\nwithout visible differentiating marks in the flowers. At least such\r\nopposite characters [472] have as yet not been ascertained in the case\r\nof our toad-flax.\r\n\r\nIn order to save seed from isolated plants it is necessary, for this\r\nreason, to have at least two individuals, and these must belong to the\r\ntwo physiologically different types. Now in the year 1892, as in other\r\nyears, my plants, though separated at the outset by distances of about\r\n20 cm. from each other, threw out roots of far greater length, growing\r\nin such a way as to abolish the strict isolation of the individuals. Any\r\nplot may produce several stems from such roots, and it is manifestly\r\nimpossible to decide whether they all belong to one original plant or to\r\nthe mixed roots of several individuals. No other strains were grown on\r\nthe same bed with my plants however, and so I considered all the stems\r\nof the little group as belonging to one plant. But their perfect\r\nfertility showed, according to the experience described, that there must\r\nhave been at least two specimens mingled together.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the seeds of this pair of plants, I had, of course, not\r\nthe least occasion to ascribe to it any higher value than the harvest of\r\nformer years. The consequence was that I had no reason to make large\r\nsowings, and grew only enough young plants to have about 50 in bloom in\r\nthe summer of 1894. Among [473] these, stray peloric flowers were\r\nobserved in somewhat larger number than in the previous generations, 11\r\nplants bearing one or two, or even three such abnormalities. This\r\nhowever, could not be considered as a real advance, since such plants\r\nmay occur in varying, though ordinarily small numbers in every\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nBesides them a single plant was seen to bear only peloric flowers; it\r\nproduced racemes on several stems and their branches. All were peloric\r\nwithout exception. I kept it through the winter, taking care to preserve\r\na complete isolation of its roots. The other plants were wholly\r\ndestroyed. Such annihilation must include both the stems and roots and\r\nthe latter of course requires considerable labor. The following year,\r\nhowever, gave proof of the success of the operation, since my plant\r\nbloomed luxuriously for the second time and remained true to the type of\r\nthe first year, producing peloric flowers exclusively.\r\n\r\nHere we have the first experimental mutation of a normal into a peloric\r\nrace. Two facts were clear and simple. The ancestry was known for over a\r\nperiod of four generations, living under the ordinary care and\r\nconditions of an experimental garden, isolated from other toad-flaxes,\r\nbut freely fertilized by bees or at times by myself. This ancestry was\r\nquite constant as to [474] the peloric peculiarity, remaining true to\r\nthe wild type as it occurs everywhere in my country, and showing in no\r\nrespect any tendency to the production of a new variety.\r\n\r\nThe mutation took place at once. It was a sudden leap from the normal\r\nplants with very rare peloric flowers to a type exclusively peloric. No\r\nintermediate steps were observed. The parents themselves had borne\r\nthousands of flowers during two summers, and these were inspected nearly\r\nevery day, in the hope of finding some pelories and of saving their seed\r\nseparately. Only one such flower was seen. If there had been more, say a\r\nfew in every hundred flowers, it might be allowable to consider them as\r\nprevious stages, showing a preparation of the impending change. But\r\nnothing of this kind was observed. There was simply no visible\r\npreparation for the sudden leap.\r\n\r\nThis leap, on the other hand, was full and complete. No reminiscence of\r\nthe former condition remained. Not a single flower on the mutated plant\r\nreverted to the previous type. All were thoroughly affected by the new\r\nattribute, and showed the abnormally augmented number of spurs, the\r\ntubular structure of the corolla and the round and narrow entrance of\r\nits throat. The whole plant departed absolutely from the old type of its\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\n[475] Three ways were open to continue my experiment. The first was\r\nindicated by the abundant harvest from the parent-plants of the\r\nmutation. It seemed possible to compare the numerical proportion of the\r\nmutated seeds with those of normal plants. In order to ascertain this\r\nproportion I sowed the greatest part of my 10 cu. cm. of seed and\r\nplanted some 2,000 young plants in little pots with well-manured soil. I\r\ngot some 1,750 flowering plants and observed among them 16 wholly\r\npeloric individuals. The numerical proportion of the mutation was\r\ntherefore in this instance to be calculated equal to about 1% of the\r\nwhole crop.\r\n\r\nThis figure is of some importance. For it shows that the chance of\r\nfinding mutations requires the cultivation of large groups of\r\nindividuals. One plant in each hundred may mutate, and cultures of less\r\nthan a hundred specimens must therefore be entirely dependent on chance\r\nfor the appearance of new forms, even if such should accidentally have\r\nbeen produced and lay dormant in the seed. In other cases mutations may\r\nbe more numerous, or on the contrary, more rare. But the chance of\r\nmutative changes in larger numbers is manifestly much reduced by this\r\nexperiment, and they may be expected to form a very small proportion of\r\nthe culture.\r\n\r\n[476] The second question which arose from the above result was this.\r\nCould the mutation be repeated? Was it to be ascribed to some latent\r\ncause which might be operative more than once? Was there some hidden\r\ntendency to mutation, which, ordinarily weak, was strengthened in my\r\ncultures by some unknown influence? Was the observed mutation to be\r\nexplained by a common cause with the other cases recorded by\r\nfield-observations? To answer this question I had only to continue my\r\nexperiment, excluding the mutated individuals from any intercrossing\r\nwith their brethren. To this end I saved the seeds from duly isolated\r\ngroups in different years and sowed them at different times. For various\r\ncauses I was not prepared to have large cultures from these seeds, but\r\nnotwithstanding this, the mutation repeated itself. In one instance I\r\nobtained two, in another, one peloric plant with exclusively\r\nmany-spurred flowers. As is easily understood, these were related as\r\n\"nieces\" to the first observed mutants. They originated in quite the\r\nsame way, by a sudden leap, without any preparation and without any\r\nintermediate steps.\r\n\r\nMutation is proved by this experience to be of an iterative nature. It\r\nis the expression of some concealed condition, or as it is generally\r\n[477] called, of some hidden tendency. The real nature of this state of\r\nthe hereditary qualities is as yet wholly unknown. It would not be safe\r\nto formulate further conclusions before the evidence offered by the\r\nevening-primroses is considered.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the question arises, whether the mutation is complete, not only\r\nas to the morphologic character, but also as to the hereditary\r\nconstitution of the mutated individuals. But here unfortunately the high\r\ndegree of sterility of the peloric plants, as previously noted, makes\r\nthe experimental evidence a thing of great difficulty. During the course\r\nof several years I isolated and planted together the peloric individuals\r\nalready mentioned, all in all some twenty plants. Each individual was\r\nnearly absolutely sterile when treated with its own pollen, and the aid\r\nof insects was of no avail. I intercrossed my plants artificially, and\r\npollinated more than a thousand flowers. Not a single one gave a normal\r\nfruit, but some small and nearly rudimentary capsules were produced,\r\nbearing a few seeds. From these I had 119 flowering plants, out of which\r\n106 were peloric and 13 one-spurred. The great majority, some 90%, were\r\nthus shown to be true to their new type. Whether the 10% reverting ones\r\nwere truly atavists, or whether they were [478] only vicinists, caused\r\nby stray pollen grains from another culture, cannot of course be decided\r\nwith sufficient certitude.\r\n\r\nHere I might refer to the observations concerning the invisible\r\ndimorphous state of the flowers of the normal toad-flax. Individuals of\r\nthe same type, when fertilized with each other, are nearly, but not\r\nabsolutely, sterile. The yield of seeds of my peloric plants agrees\r\nfairly well with the harvest which I have obtained from some of the\r\nnearly sterile pairs of individuals in my former trial. Hence the\r\nsuggestion is forced upon us that perhaps, owing to some unknown cause,\r\nall the peloric individuals of my experiment belonged to one and the\r\nsame type, and were sterile for this reason only. If this is true, then\r\nit is to be presumed that all previous investigators have met the same\r\ncondition, each having at hand only one of the two required types. And\r\nthis discussion has the further advantage of showing the way, in which\r\nperhaps a full and constant race of peloric toad-flaxes may be obtained.\r\nTwo individuals of different type are required to start from. They seem\r\nas yet never to have arisen from one group of mutations. But if it were\r\npossible to combine the products of two mutations obtained in different\r\ncountries and under different conditions, there would be a chance [479]\r\nthat they might belong to the supposed opposite types, and thus be\r\nfertile with one another. My peloric plants are still available, and the\r\noccurrence of this form elsewhere would give material for a successful\r\nexperiment. The probability thereof is enhanced by the experience that\r\nmy peloric plants bear large capsules and a rich harvest of seeds when\r\nfertilized from plants of the normal one-spurred race, while they remain\r\nnearly wholly barren by artificial fertilization with others. I suppose\r\nthat they are infertile with the normal toad-flaxes of their own sexual\r\ndisposition, but fertile with those of the opposite constitution. At all\r\nevents the fact that they may bear abundant seed when properly\r\npollinated is an indication of successful experiments on the possibility\r\nof gaining a hereditary race with exclusively peloric flowers. And such\r\na race would be a distinct gain for sundry physiologic inquiries, and\r\nperhaps not wholly destitute of value from an horticultural point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the often recorded occurrence of peloric toad-flaxes in\r\nthe wild state and recalling our discussion about the improbability of a\r\ndispersion from one locality to another by seed, and the probability of\r\nindependent origin for most of these cases, we are confronted with the\r\nconception that a latent [480] tendency to mutation must be universally\r\npresent in the whole species. Another observation, although it is of a\r\nnegative character, gains in importance from this point of view. I refer\r\nto the total lack of intermediate steps between normal and peloric\r\nindividuals. If such links had ordinarily been produced previous to the\r\npurely peloric state they would no doubt have been observed from time to\r\ntime. This is so much the more probable as _Linaria_ is a perennial\r\nherb, and the ancestors of a mutation might still be in a flowering\r\ncondition together with their divergent offspring. But no such\r\nintermediates are on record. The peloric toad-flaxes are, as a rule,\r\nfound surrounded by the normal type, but without intergrading forms.\r\nThis discontinuity has already been insisted upon by Hofmeister and\r\nothers, even at the time when the theory of descent was most under\r\ndiscussion, and any link would surely have been produced as a proof of a\r\nslow and continuous change. But no such proof has been found, and the\r\nconclusion seems admissible that the mutation of toad-flaxes ordinarily,\r\nif not universally, takes place by a sudden step. Our experiment may\r\nsimply be considered as a thoroughly controlled instance of an often\r\nrecurring phenomenon. It teaches us how, in the [481] main, the peloric\r\nmutations must be assumed to proceed.\r\n\r\nThis conception may still be broadened. We may include in it all similar\r\noccurrences, in allied and other species. There is hardly a limit to the\r\npossibilities which are opened up by this experience. But it will be\r\nwell to refrain from hazardous theorizing, and consider only those cases\r\nwhich may be regarded as exact repetitions of the same phenomenon and of\r\nwhich our culture is one of the most recent instances on record. We will\r\nlimit ourselves to the probable origin of peloric variations at large,\r\nof which little is known, but some evidence may be derived from the\r\nrecorded facts. Only one case can be said to be directly analogous to\r\nour observations.\r\n\r\nThis refers to the peloric race of the common snapdragon, or\r\n_Antirrhinum majus_ of our gardens. It is known to produce peloric races\r\nfrom time to time in the same way as does the toadflax. But the\r\nsnapdragon is self-fertile and so is its peloric variety. Some cases are\r\nrelatively old, and some of them have been recorded and in part observed\r\nby Darwin. Whence they have sprung and in what manner they were\r\nproduced, seems never to have been noted. Others are of later origin,\r\nand among these one or two varieties have been accidentally produced\r\n[482] in the nursery of Mr. Chr. Lorenz in Erfurt, and are now for sale,\r\nthe seeds being guaranteed to yield a large proportion of peloric\r\nindividuals. The peloric form in this case appeared at once, but was not\r\nisolated, and was left free to visiting insects, which of course crossed\r\nit with the surrounding varieties. Without doubt the existence of two\r\ncolor-varieties of the peloric type, one of a very dark red, indicating\r\nthe \"Black prince\" variety as the pollen-parent, and the other with a\r\nwhite tube of the corolla, recalling the form known as \"Delila,\" is due\r\nto these crossings. I had last year (1903) a large lot of plants, partly\r\nnormal and partly peloric, but evidently of hybrid origin, from seeds\r\nfrom this nursery, showing moreover all intermediate steps between\r\nnearly wholly peloric individuals and apparently normal ones. I have\r\nsaved the seeds of the isolated types and before seeing the flowers of\r\ntheir offspring, nothing can be said about the purity and constancy of\r\nthe type, when freed from hybrid admixtures. The peloric snapdragon has\r\nfive small unequal spurs at the base of its long tube, and in this\r\nrespect agrees with the peloric toad-flax.\r\n\r\nOther pelories are terminal and quite regular, and occur in some species\r\nof _Linaria_, where I observed them in _Linaria dalmatica_. The [483]\r\nterminal flowers of many branches were large and beautifully peloric,\r\nbearing five long and equal spurs. About their origin and inheritance\r\nnothing is known.\r\n\r\nA most curious terminal pelory is that of the common foxglove or\r\n_Digitalis purpurea_. As we have seen in a previous lecture, it is an\r\nold variety. It was described and figured for the first time by Vrolik\r\nof Amsterdam, and the original specimens of his plates are still to be\r\nseen in the collections of the botanic garden of that university. Since\r\nhis time it has been propagated by seed as a commercial variety, and may\r\nbe easily obtained. The terminal flower of the central stem and those of\r\nthe branches only are affected, all other flowers being wholly normal.\r\nAlmost always it is accompanied by other deviations, among which a\r\nmarked increase of the number of the parts of the corolla and other\r\nwhorls is the most striking. Likewise supernumerary petals on the outer\r\nside of the corolla, and a production of a bud in the center of the\r\ncapsule may be often met with. This bud as a rule grows out after the\r\nfading away of the flower, bursting through the green carpels of the\r\nunripe fruit, and producing ordinarily a secondary raceme of flowers.\r\nThis raceme is a weak but exact repetition of the first, bearing\r\nsymmetrical foxgloves all [484] along and terminating in a peloric\r\nstructure. On the branches these anomalies are more or less reduced,\r\naccording to the strength of the branch, and conforming to the rule of\r\nperiodicity, given in our lecture on the \"five-leaved\" clover. Through\r\nall this diminution the peloric type remains unchanged and therefore\r\nbecomes so much the purer, the weaker the branches on which it stands.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether such peloric flowers have ever been purely\r\npollinated and their seed saved separately, but I have often observed\r\nthat the race comes pure from the seed of the zygomorphic flowers. It is\r\nas yet doubtful whether it is a half race or a double race, and whether\r\nit might be purified and strengthened by artificial selection. Perhaps\r\nthe determination of the hereditary percentage described when dealing\r\nwith the tricotyls might give the clue to the acquisition of a higher\r\nspecialized race. The variety is old and widely disseminated, but must\r\nbe subjected to quite a number of additional experiments before it can\r\nbe said to be sufficiently understood.\r\n\r\nThe most widespread peloric variety is that of _Gloxinia_. It has erect\r\ninstead of drooping flowers; and with the changed position the structure\r\nis also changed. Like other pelories it has five equal stamens instead\r\nof four unequal [485] ones, and a corolla with five equal segments\r\ninstead of an upper and a lower lip. It shows the peloric condition in\r\nall of its flowers and is often combined with a small increase of the\r\nnumber of the parts of the whorls. It is for sale under the name of\r\n_erecta_, and may be had in a wide range of color-types. It seems to be\r\nquite constant from seed.\r\n\r\nMany other instances of peloric flowers are on record. Indian cress or\r\n_Tropaeolum majus_ loses the spur in some double varieties and with it\r\nmost of its symmetrical structure; it seems to be considered justly as a\r\npeloric malformation. Other species produce such anomalies only from\r\ntime to time and nothing is known about their hereditary tendency. One\r\nof the most curious instances is the terminal flower of the raceme of\r\nthe common laburnum, which loses its whole papilionaceous character and\r\nbecomes as regularly quinate as a common buttercup.\r\n\r\nSome families are more liable to pelorism than others. Obviously all the\r\ngroups, the flowers of which are not symmetrical, are to be excluded.\r\nBut then we find that labiates and their allies among the dicotyledonous\r\nplants, and orchids among the monocotyledonous ones are especially\r\nsubjected to this alteration. In both groups many genera and a long list\r\nof species [486] could be quoted as proof. The family of the labiates\r\nseems to be essentially rich in terminal pelories, as for instance in\r\nthe wild sage or _Salvia_ and the dead-nettle or _Lamium_. Here the\r\npelories have long and straight corolla-tubes, which are terminated by a\r\nwhorl of four or five segments. Such forms often occur in the wild state\r\nand seem to have a geographic distribution as narrowly circumscribed as\r\nin the case of many small species. Those of the labiates chiefly belong\r\nto southern Europe and are unknown at least in some parts of the other\r\ncountries. On the contrary terminal pelories of _Scrophularia nodosa_\r\nare met with from time to time in Holland. Such facts clearly point to a\r\ncommon origin, and as only the terminal flowers are affected by the\r\nmalformation, the fertility of the whole plant is evidently not\r\nseriously infringed upon.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the labiates, we may cite a curious instance of pelorism\r\nin the toad-flax, which is quite different from the ordinary peloric\r\nvariety. This latter may be considered from a morphologic standpoint to\r\nbe owing to a five-fold repetition of the middle part of the underlip.\r\nThis conception would at once explain the occurrence of five spurs and\r\nof the orange border all around the corolla-tube. We might readily\r\nimagine that any other of the five [487] parts of the corolla could be\r\nrepeated five-fold, in which case there would be no spur, and no orange\r\nhue on the upper corolla-ring. Such forms really occur, though they seem\r\nto be more rare than the five-spurred pelories. Very little is known\r\nabout their frequency and hereditary qualities.\r\n\r\nOrchids include a large number of peloric monstrosities and moreover a\r\nwild pelory which is systematically described not only as a separate\r\nspecies but even as a new genus. It bears the name of _Uropedium\r\nlindenii_, and is so closely related to _Cypripedium caudatum_ that many\r\nauthors take it for the peloric variety of this plant. It occurs in the\r\nwild state in some parts of Mexico, where the _Cypripedium_ also grows.\r\nIts claims to be a separate genus are lessened by the somewhat monstrous\r\ncondition of the sexual organs, which are described as quite abnormal.\r\nBut here also, intermediates are lacking, and this fact points to a\r\nsudden origin.\r\n\r\nMany cases of pelorism afford promising material for further studies of\r\nexperimental mutations. The peloric toad-flax is only the prototype of\r\nwhat may be expected in other cases. No opportunity should be lost to\r\nincrease the as yet too scanty, evidence on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n[488]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVII\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF DOUBLE FLOWERS\r\n\r\nMutations occur as often among cultivated plants as among those in the\r\nwild state. Garden flowers are known to vary markedly. Much of their\r\nvariability, however, is due to hybridism, and the combination of\r\ncharacters previously separate has a value for the breeder nearly equal\r\nthe production of really new qualities. Nevertheless there is no doubt\r\nthat some new characters appear from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn a previous lecture we have seen that varietal characters have many\r\nfeatures in common. One of them is their frequent recurrence both in the\r\nsame and in other, often very distantly related, species. This\r\nrecurrence is an important factor in the choice of the material for an\r\nexperimental investigation of the nature of mutations.\r\n\r\nSome varieties are reputed to occur more often and more readily than\r\nothers. White-colored varieties, though so very common, seem for the\r\nmost part to be of ancient date, but only few [489] have a known origin,\r\nhowever. Without any doubt many of them have been found in a wild state\r\nand were introduced into culture. On the other hand double flowers are\r\nexceedingly rare in the wild state, and even a slight indication of a\r\ntendency towards doubling, the stray petaloid stamens, are only rarely\r\nobserved growing wild. In cultivation, however, double flowers are of\r\nfrequent occurrence; hence the conclusion that they have been produced\r\nin gardens and nurseries more frequently than perhaps any other type of\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of my experimental work I cherished the hope of being\r\nable to produce a white variety. My experiments, however, have not been\r\nsuccessful, and so I have given them up temporarily. Much better chances\r\nfor a new double variety seemed to exist, and my endeavors in this\r\ndirection have finally been crowned with success.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I propose to deal now with the production of double\r\nflowers, to inquire what is on record about them in horticultural\r\nliterature, and to give a full description of the origin thereof in an\r\ninstance which it was my good fortune to observe in my garden.\r\n\r\nOf course the historical part is only a hasty survey of the question and\r\nwill only give such evidence as may enable us to get an idea of the\r\n[490] chances of success for the experimental worker. In the second half\r\nof the seventeenth century (1671), my countryman, Abraham Munting,\r\npublished a large book on garden plants with many beautiful figures. It\r\nis called \"Waare Oeffeninge der Planters,\" or \"True Exercises With\r\nPlants.\" The descriptions pertain to ordinary typical species in greater\r\npart, but garden varieties receive special attention. Among these a long\r\nlist of double flowers are to be seen. Double varieties of poppies,\r\nliverleaf (Hepatica), wallflowers (_Cheiranthus_), violets, _Caltha_,\r\n_Althaea_, _Colchicum_, and periwinkles (_Vinca_), and a great many\r\nother common flowers were already in cultivation at that time.\r\n\r\nOther double forms have been since added. Many have been introduced from\r\nJapan, especially the Japanese marigold, _Chrysanthemum indicum_. Others\r\nhave been derived from Mexico, as for instance the double zinnias. The\r\nsingle dahlias only seem to have been originally known to the\r\ninhabitants of Mexico. They were introduced into Spain at about 1789,\r\nand the first double ones were produced in Louvain, Belgium, in 1814.\r\nThe method of their origin has not been described, and probably escaped\r\nthe originators themselves. But in historical records we find the\r\ncurious statement that it took place after three years' work. This\r\nindicates [491] a distinct plan, and the possibility of carrying it to a\r\npractical conclusion within a few years' time.\r\n\r\nSomething more is known about other cases. Garden anemones, _Anemone\r\ncoronaria_, are said to have become double in the first half of the last\r\ncentury in an English nursery. The owner, Williamson, observing in his\r\nbeds a flower with a single broadened stamen, saved its seeds\r\nseparately, and in the next generations procured beautifully filled\r\nflowers. These he afterwards had crossed by bees with a number of\r\ncolored varieties, and in this way succeeded in producing many new\r\ndouble types of anemone.\r\n\r\nThe first double petunia is known to have suddenly and accidentally\r\narisen from ordinary seed in a private garden at Lyons about 1855. From\r\nthis one plant all double races and-varieties have been derived by\r\nnatural and partly by artificial crosses. Carriere, who reported this\r\nfact, added that likewise other species were known at that time to\r\nproduce new double varieties rapidly. The double fuchsias originated\r\nabout the same time (1854) and ten years later the range of double\r\nvarieties of this plant had become so large that Carriere found it\r\nimpossible to enumerate all of them.\r\n\r\nDouble carnations seem to be relatively old, double corn-flowers and\r\ndouble blue-bells being [492] of a later period. A long list could\r\neasily be made, to show that during the whole history of horticulture\r\ndouble varieties have arisen from time to time. As far as we can judge,\r\nsuch appearances have been isolated and sudden. Sometimes they sprang\r\ninto existence in the full display of their beauty, but most commonly\r\nthey showed themselves for the first time, exhibiting only spare\r\nsupernumerary petals. Whenever such sports were worked up, a few years\r\nsufficed to reach the entire development of the new varietal attribute.\r\n\r\nFrom this superficial survey of historical facts, the inference is\r\nforced upon us that the chance of producing a new double variety is good\r\nenough to justify the attempt. It has frequently succeeded for practical\r\npurposes, why should it not succeed as well for purely scientific\r\ninvestigation? At all events the type recommends itself to the student\r\nof nature, both on account of its frequency, and of the apparent\r\ninsignificance of the first step, combined with the possibility of\r\nrapidly working up from this small beginning of one superfluous petal\r\ntowards the highest degree of duplication.\r\n\r\nCompared with the tedious experimental production of the peloric\r\ntoad-flax, the attempt to produce a double flower has a distinct\r\nattraction. The peloric toad-flax is nothing new; the [493] experiment\r\nwas only a repetition of what presumably takes place often within the\r\nsame species. To attempt to produce a double variety we may choose any\r\nspecies, and of course should select one which as yet has not been known\r\nto produce double flowers. By doing so we will, if we succeed, produce\r\nsomething new. Of course, it does not matter whether the new variety has\r\nan horticultural interest or not, and it seems preferable to choose a\r\nwild or little cultivated species, to be quite sure that the variety in\r\nquestion is not already in existence. Finally the prospect of success\r\nseems to be enhanced if a species is chosen, the nearest allies of which\r\nare known to have produced double flowers.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons and others I chose for my experiment the\r\ncorn-marigold, or _Chrysanthemum segetum_. It is also called the golden\r\ncornflower. In the wheat and rye fields of central Europe it associates\r\nwith the blue-bottle or blue corn-flower. It is sometimes cultivated and\r\nthe seeds are offered for sale by many nurserymen. It has a cultivated\r\nvariety, called _grandiflorum_, which is esteemed for its brilliancy and\r\nlong succession of golden bloom. This variety has larger flower-heads,\r\nsurrounded with a fuller border of ray-florets. The species belongs to a\r\ngenus many species of which have produced [494] double varieties. One of\r\nthem is the Japanese marigold, others are the _carinatum_ and the\r\n_imbricatum_ species. Nearly allied are quite a number of garden-plants\r\nwith double flower-heads, among which are the double camomiles.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first drawn to the structure of the heads and\r\nespecially to the number of the ray-florets of the corn-marigold. The\r\nspecies appertains to that group of composites which have a head of\r\nsmall tubular florets surrounded by a broad border of rays. These rays,\r\nwhen counted, are observed to occur in definite numbers, which are\r\nconnected with each other by a formula, known as \"the series\" of Braun\r\nand Schimper. In this formula, which commences with 1 and 2, each number\r\nis equal to the sum of the two foregoing figures. Thus 5, 8 and 13 are\r\nvery frequent occurrences, and the following number, 21, is a most\r\ngeneral one for apparently full rays, such as in daisies, camomiles,\r\n_Arnica_ and many other wild and cultivated species.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are not at all constant. They are only the averages,\r\naround which the real numbers fluctuate. There may even be an\r\noverlapping of the extremes, since the fluctuation around 13 may even go\r\nbeyond 8 and 21, and so on. But such extremes are only found in stray\r\nflowers, occurring on the same [495] individuals with the lesser degrees\r\nof deviation.\r\n\r\nNow the marigold averages 13, and the _grandiflorum_ 21 rays. The wild\r\nspecies is pure in this respect, but the garden-variety is not. The\r\nseeds which are offered for sale usually contain a mixture of both forms\r\nand their hybrids. So I had to isolate the pure types from this mixture\r\nand to ascertain their constancy and mutual independency. To this end I\r\nisolated from the mixture first the 13-rayed, and afterwards the\r\n21-rayed types. As the marigolds are not sufficiently self-fertile, and\r\nare not easily pollinated artificially, it seemed impossible to carry on\r\nthese two experiments at the same time and in the same garden. I devoted\r\nthe first three years to the lower form, isolated some individuals with\r\n12-13 rays out of the mixture of 1892 and counted the ray-florets on the\r\nterminal head of every plant of the ensuing generation next year. I\r\ncultivated and counted in this way above 150 individuals and found an\r\naverage of exactly 13 with comparatively few individuals displaying 14\r\nor only 12 rays, and with the remainder of the plants grouped\r\nsymmetrically around this average. I continued the experiment for still\r\nanother year and found the same group of figures. I was then satisfied\r\nas to the purity of the isolated strain. Next year I sowed a new mixture\r\nin [496] order to isolate the reputed pure _grandiflorum_ type. During\r\nthe beginning of the flowering period I ruthlessly threw away all plants\r\ndisplaying less than 21 rays in the first or terminal head. But this\r\nselection was not to be considered as complete, because the 13-rayed\r\nrace may eventually transgress its boundary and come over to the 21 and\r\nmore. This made a second selection necessary. On the selected plants all\r\nthe secondary heads were inspected and their ray-florets counted. Some\r\nindividuals showed an average of about 13 and were destroyed. Others\r\ngave doubtful figures and were likewise eliminated, and only 6 out of a\r\nlot of nearly 300 flowering plants reached an average of 21 for all of\r\nthe flowers.\r\n\r\nOur summer is a short one, compared with the long and beautiful summer\r\nof California, and it was too late to cut off the faded and the open\r\nflowers, and await new ones, which might be purely fertilized after the\r\ndestruction of all minor plants. So I had to gather the seed from\r\nflowers, which might have been partially fertilized by the wrong pollen.\r\nThis however, is not so great a drawback in selection experiments as\r\nmight be supposed at first sight. The selection of the following year is\r\nsure to eliminate the offspring of such impure parentage.\r\n\r\n[497] A far more important principle is that of the hereditary\r\npercentage, already discussed in our lecture on the selection of\r\nmonstrosities. In our present case it had to be applied only to the six\r\nselected plants of 1895. To this end the seeds of each of them were sown\r\nseparately, the ray-florets of the terminal heads of each of the new\r\ngeneration were counted, and curves and averages were made up for the\r\nsix groups. Five of them gave proof of still being mixtures and were\r\nwholly rejected. The children of the sixth parent, however, formed a\r\ngroup of uniform constitution, all fluctuating around the desired\r\naverage of 21. All in all the terminal heads of over 1,500 plants have\r\nbeen subjected to the somewhat tedious work of counting their\r\nray-florets. And this not in the laboratory, but in the garden, without\r\ncutting them off. Otherwise it would obviously have been impossible to\r\nrecognize the best plants for preservation. I chose only two plants\r\nwhich in addition recommended themselves by the average number of rays\r\non their secondary heads, sowed their seeds next year separately and\r\ncompared the numerical constitution of their offspring. Both groups\r\naveraged 21 and were distributed very symmetrically around this mean.\r\nThis result [498] showed that no further selection could be of any\r\navail, and that I had succeeded in purifying the 21-rayed _grandiflorum_\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIt is from this _grandiflorum_ that I have finally produced my double\r\nvariety. In the year 1896 I selected from among the above quoted 1,500\r\nplants, 500 with terminal heads bearing 21 or more rays. On these I\r\ncounted the rays of all the secondary heads about the middle of August\r\n(1896) and found that they had, as a rule, retrograded to lower figures.\r\nOn many thousands of heads only two were found having 22 rays. All\r\nothers had the average number of 21 or even less. I isolated the\r\nindividual which bore these two heads, allowed them to be fertilized by\r\ninsects with the pollen of some of the best plants of the same group,\r\nbut destroyed the remainder.\r\n\r\nThis single exceptional plant has been the starting point of my double\r\nvariety. It was not remarkable for its terminal head, which exhibited\r\nthe average number of rays of the 21-rayed race. Nor was it\r\ndistinguished by the average figure for all its heads. It was only\r\nselected because it was the one plant which had some secondary heads\r\nwith one ray more than all the others. This indication was very slight,\r\nand could not have been detected save by the counting of the rays of\r\nthousands of heads.\r\n\r\n[499] But the rarity of the anomaly was exactly the indication wanted,\r\nand the same deviation would have had no signification whatever, had it\r\noccurred in a group fluctuating symmetrically around the average figure.\r\nOn the other hand, the observed anomaly was only an indication, and no\r\nguarantee of future developments.\r\n\r\nHere it should be remarked that the indication alluded to was not the\r\nappearance of the expected character of doubling in ever so slight a\r\nmeasure. It was only a guide to be followed in further work. The real\r\ncharacter of double flower-heads among composites lies in the production\r\nof rays on the disk. No increase of the number of the outer rays can\r\nhave the same significance. A hasty inspection of double flower heads\r\nmay convey the idea that all rays are arranged around a little central\r\ncluster of disk-florets, the remainder of the original disk-florets but\r\na closer investigation will always reveal the fallacy of this\r\nconclusion. Hidden between the inner rays, and covered by them, lie the\r\nlittle tubular and fertile florets everywhere on the disk. They may not\r\nbe easily seen, but if the supernumerary rays are pulled out, the disk\r\nmay be seen to bear numerous small florets at intervals. But these\r\nintervals are not at all numerous, showing thereby that only a\r\nrelatively small number of tubes has been [500] converted into rays.\r\nThis conversion is obviously the true mark of the doubling, and before\r\ntraces of it are found, no assertion whatever can be given as to the\r\nissue of the pedigree experiment.\r\n\r\nThree more years were required before this first, but decisive trace was\r\ndiscovered. During these years I subjected my strain to the same sharp\r\nselection as has already been described. The chosen ancestor of the race\r\nhad flowered in 1896, and the next year I sowed its seeds only. From\r\nthis generation I chose the one plant with the largest number of rays in\r\nits terminal head, and repeated this in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that the average number of rays increased rapidly,\r\nand with it the absolute maximum of the whole strain. The average came\r\nup from 21 to 34. Brighter and brighter crowns of the yellow rays\r\nimproved my race, until it became difficult and very time consuming to\r\ncount all the large rays of the borders. The largest numbers determined\r\nin the succeeding generations increased by leaps from 21 to 34 in the\r\nfirst year, and thence to 48 and 66 in the two succeeding summers. Every\r\nyear I was able to save enough seed from the very best plant and to use\r\nit only for the continuance of the race. Before the selected plants were\r\nallowed to open the flowers from which the seed [501] was to be\r\ngathered, nearly the whole remaining culture was exterminated, excepting\r\nonly some of the best examples, in order to have the required material\r\nfor cross-pollination by insects. Each new generation was thereby as\r\nsharply selected as possible with regard to both parents.\r\n\r\nAll flower-heads were of course closely inspected. Not the slightest\r\nindication of real doubling was discovered, even in the summer of 1899\r\nin the fourth generation of my selected race. But among the best the new\r\ncharacter suddenly made its appearance. It was at the commencement of\r\nSeptember (1899), too late to admit of the seeds ripening before winter.\r\nAn inspection of the younger heads was made, which revealed three heads\r\nwith some few rays in the midst of the disk on one plant, the result of\r\nthe efforts of four years. Had the germ of the mutation lain hidden\r\nthrough all this time? Had it been present, though dormant in the\r\noriginal sample of seed? Or had an entirely new creation taken place\r\nduring my continuous endeavors? Perhaps as their more or less immediate\r\nresult? It is obviously impossible to answer these questions, before\r\nfurther and similar experiments shall have been performed, bringing to\r\nlight other details that will enable us to reach a more definite\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n[502] The fact that the origination of such forms is accessible to\r\ndirect investigation is proven quite independently of all further\r\nconsiderations. The new variety came into existence at once. The leap\r\nmay have been made by the ancestor of the year 1895, or by the plant of\r\n1899, which showed the first central rays, or the sport may have been\r\ngradually built up during those four years. In each case there was a\r\nleap, contrasting with the view which claims a very long succession of\r\nyears for the development of every new character.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered this first trace of doubling, it was to be expected\r\nthat the new variety would be at once as pure and as rich as other\r\ndouble composites usually are. Some effect of the crossing with the\r\nother seed-bearing individuals might still disturb this uniformity in\r\nthe following year, but another year's work would eliminate even this\r\nsource of impurity.\r\n\r\nThese two years have given the expected result. The average number of\r\nthe rays, which had already arisen from 13 to 34 now at once came up to\r\n47 and 55, the last figure being the sum of 21 and 34 and therefore the\r\nprobable uttermost limit to be reached before absolute doubling. The\r\nmaximum numbers came as high as 100 in 1900, and reached even 200 in\r\n1901. Such heads are as completely double as are the [503] brightest\r\nheads of the most beautiful double commercial varieties of composites.\r\nEven the best white camomiles (_Chrysanthemum inodorum_) and the\r\ngold-flowers or garden-marigolds (_Calendula officinalis_) do not come\r\nnearer to purity since they always have scores of little tubular florets\r\nbetween the rays on their disks.\r\n\r\nReal atavists or real reversionists were seen no more after the first\r\npurification of the race. I have continued my culture and secured last\r\nsummer (1903) as many and as completely doubled heads as previously. The\r\nrace has at once become permanent and constant. It has of course a wide\r\nrange of fluctuating variability, but the lower limit has been worked up\r\nto about 34 rays, a figure never reached by the _grandiflorum_ parent,\r\nfrom which my new variety is thus sharply separated.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the best flowers and even the best individuals of my race\r\nare wholly barren. Selection has reached its practical limit. Seeds must\r\nbe saved from less dense heads, and no way has been found of avoiding\r\nit. The ray-florets are sterile, even in the wild species, and when\r\ngrowing in somewhat large numbers on the disk, they conceal the fertile\r\nflowers from the visiting insects, and cause them also to be sterile.\r\nThe same is the case with the best cultivated forms. Their showiest\r\nindividuals are [504] barren, and incapable of the reproduction of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThis last is therefore, of necessity, always continued by means of\r\nindividuals whose deviation from the mean average is the least. But in\r\nmany cases the varieties are so highly differentiated that selection has\r\nbecome quite superfluous for practical purposes. I have already\r\ndiscussed the question as to the actual moment, in which the change of\r\nthe _grandiflorum_ variety into the new _plenum_ form must be assumed to\r\nhave taken place. In this respect some stress is to be laid on the fact\r\nthat the improvement through selection has been gradual and continuous,\r\nthough very rapid from the first moment. But with the appearance of the\r\nfirst stray rays within the disk, this continuity suddenly changed. All\r\nthe children of this original mutated plant showed the new character,\r\nthe rays within the disk, without exception. Not on all the heads, nor\r\neven on the majority of the heads on some individuals, but on some heads\r\nall gave clear proof of the possession of the new attribute. This was\r\npresent in all the representatives of the new race, and had never been\r\nseen in any of their parents and grandparents. Here there was evidently\r\na sudden leap, at least in the external form of the plants. And it seems\r\nto me to be the most simple conception, [505] that this visible leap\r\ndirectly corresponded to that inner change, which brought about the\r\ncomplete inheritability of the new peculiarity. It is very interesting\r\nto observe how completely my experience agrees with the results of the\r\nobservations of breeders at large. No doubt a comparison is difficult,\r\nand the circumstances are not adequate to a close study.\r\n\r\nIsolation and selection have been applied commonly only so far as was\r\nconsistent with the requirements of practical horticulture, and of\r\ncourse a determination of the hereditary percentage was never made. The\r\ndisregard of this feature made necessary a greater length of time and a\r\nlarger number of generations to bring about the desired changes.\r\nNotwithstanding this, however, it has been seen that double varieties\r\nare produced suddenly. This may have occurred unexpectedly or after a\r\nfew years' effort toward the end desired. Whether this sudden appearance\r\nis the consequence of a single internal differentiating step, or of the\r\nrapid succession of lesser changes, cannot yet be made out. The extreme\r\nvariability of double flowers and the chance of their appearance with\r\nonly slight indications of the previous petaloid alterations of a few\r\nstamens may often result in their origin being overlooked, while\r\nsubsequent generations may come in for full notice. [506] In the greater\r\nnumber of cases recorded it remains doubtful whether the work said to be\r\ndone to obtain a new double variety was done before the appearance of\r\nthese preliminary indications or afterward.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, it would correspond with our selection of large\r\nnumbers of florets in the outer rays, in the second however, with the\r\nordinary purification of new races from hybrid mixtures.\r\n\r\nIn scientific selection-experiments such crosses are of course avoided,\r\nand the process of purification is unnecessary, even as in the\r\n_Chrysanthemum_ culture. The first generation succeeding the original\r\nplant with disk-rays was in this respect wholly uniform and true to the\r\nnew type.\r\n\r\nIn practice the work does not start from such slight indications, and is\r\ndone with no other purpose in view than to produce double flowers in\r\nspecies in which they did not already exist. Therefore it is of the\r\nhighest importance to know the methods used and the chances of success.\r\nUnfortunately the evidence is very scanty on both points.\r\n\r\nLindley and other writers, on horticultural theory and practice assert\r\nthat a large amount of nourishment tends to produce double flowers,\r\nwhile a culture under normal conditions, [507] even if the plants are\r\nvery strong and healthy, has no such effect. But even here it remains\r\ndoubtful whether it applies to the period before or after the internal\r\nmutation. On the other hand success is not at all to be relied upon, nor\r\nis the work to be regarded as easy. The instances of double flowers said\r\nto be obtainable at will, are too rare in comparison with the number of\r\ncases, where the first indication of them was found accidentally.\r\n\r\nLeaving all these doubtful points, which will have to be cleared up by\r\nfurther scientific investigation, the high degree of variability\r\nrequires further discussion. It may be considered from three different\r\npoints of view according to the limit of the deviation from the average,\r\nto the dependency on external conditions and to periodicity. It seems\r\nbest to take up the last two points first.\r\n\r\nOn a visit to a nursery at Erfurt I once inspected an experiment with a\r\nnew double variety of the common blue-bottle or blue corn-flower. The\r\nplants were dependent on the weather to a high degree. Bad weather\r\nincreased the number of poorly filled flower-heads, while warm and sunny\r\ndays were productive of beautiful double flowers. The heads that are\r\nborne by strong branches have a greater tendency to become double than\r\nthose of the weaker ones, [508] and towards the autumn, when all those\r\nof the first group are faded away, and only a weak though large section\r\nof the heads is still flowering, the whole aspect of the variety\r\ngradually retrogrades. The same law of dependency and periodicity is\r\nprevalent everywhere. In my own cultures of the improved field-marigold\r\nI have observed it frequently. The number of the ray-florets may be\r\nconsidered as a direct response to nourishment, both when this is\r\ndetermined by external circumstances, and when it depends on the\r\nparticular strength of the branch, which bears the head in question. It\r\nis a case exactly similar to that of the supernumerary carpels of the\r\npistilloid poppy, and the deductions arrived at with that variety may be\r\napplied directly to double flowers.\r\n\r\nThis dependency upon nourishment is of high practical importance in\r\ncombination with the usual effect of the doubling which makes the\r\nflowers sterile. It is a general rule that the most perfect flowers do\r\nnot produce seed. At the height of the flowering period the external\r\ncircumstances are the most favorable, and the flowering branches still\r\nconstitute the stronger axes of the plants. Hence we may infer that\r\nsterility will prevail precisely in this period. Many varieties are\r\nknown to yield only seeds from the very last flowers, as for instance\r\nsome [509] double begonias. Others bear only seed on their weaker\r\nlateral branches, as the double camomile, or become fertile only towards\r\nthe fall, as is often the case with the above quoted Erfurt variety of\r\nthe blue-bottle. As far as I have been able to ascertain, such seeds are\r\nquite adequate for the reproduction and perpetuation of the double\r\nvarieties, but the question whether there are differences between the\r\nseeds of the more or less double flowers of the same plants still\r\nremains open. It is very probable, from a theoretical point of view,\r\nthat such differences exist, but perhaps they are so slight, as to have\r\npractically no bearing on the question.\r\n\r\nOn the ground of their wide range of variability, the double varieties\r\nmust be regarded as pertaining to the group of ever-sporting forms. On\r\none side they fluctuate in the direction towards such petalomanous\r\nflowers as are borne by the stocks and others, which we have previously\r\ndiscussed. Here no trace of the fertile organs is left. But this extreme\r\nis never reached by petaloid double flowers. A gap remains which, often\r\noverlooked, always exists, and which sharply separates the two types. On\r\nthe other hand the alteration of the stamens gradually relapses to\r\nperfectly single flowers. Here the analogy with the pistillody of the\r\npoppies and with the \"five-leaved\" clover is obvious.\r\n\r\n[510] This conception of the inner nature of double flowers explains the\r\nfact that the varietal mark is seldom seen to be complete throughout\r\nlarger groups of individuals, providing these have not been already\r\nselected by this character. _Tagetes africana_ is liable to produce some\r\npoorly filled specimens, and some double varieties of carnations are\r\noffered for sale with the note that the seed yields only 80% of doubles.\r\nWith _Chrysanthemum coronarium_ and blue-bottles this figure is often\r\nannounced to be only about 50%. No doubt it is partly due to impurities,\r\ncaused by vicinism, but it is obviously improbable that the effect of\r\nthese impurities should be so large.\r\n\r\nSome cases of partial reversion may be interpreted in the same way.\r\nAmong the garden anemones, _Anemone coronaria_, there is a variety\r\ncalled the \"Bride,\" on account of its pure white dowers. It is for sale\r\nwith single and with double flowers, and these two forms are known to\r\nsport into one another, although they are multiplied in the vegetative\r\nway. Such cases are known to be of quite ordinary occurrence. Of course\r\nsuch sports must be considered as partial, and the same stem may bear\r\nboth types of flowers. It even happens that some particular flower is\r\npartly double and partly single. Mr. Krelage, of Haarlem, had the\r\nkindness to [511] send me such a curious flower. One half of it was\r\ncompletely double, while the other half was entirely single, bearing\r\nnormal and fertile stamens in the ordinary number.\r\n\r\nThe same halfway doubling is recorded to occur among composites\r\nsometimes, and from the same source I possess in my collection a head of\r\n_Pyrethrum roseum_, bearing on half of its disk elongated corolla tubes,\r\nand on the other half the small disk-florets of the typical species.\r\n\r\nIt is a current belief, that varieties are improved by continued\r\nculture. I have never been able to ascertain the grounds on which this\r\nconviction rests. It may be referred either to the purity of the race or\r\nto the complete development of the varietal character. In the first case\r\nit is a question of hybrid mixtures from which many young varieties must\r\nbe freed before being placed on the market. But as we have already seen\r\nin a former lecture, this requires only three or four years, and\r\nafterwards the degree of purity is kept up to the point which proves to\r\nbe the most suitable for practical purposes. The complete development of\r\nthe varietal character is a question restricted to ever-sporting\r\nvarieties, since in white flowers and other constant varieties this\r\ndegree is variable in a very small and unimportant measure. [512] Hence\r\nthe double flowers seem to afford a very good example for this\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nIt can be decided by two facts. First by a consideration of the oldest\r\ndouble varieties, and secondly by that of the very youngest. Are the\r\nolder ones now in a better condition than at the outset? Have they\r\nreally been gradually improved during the centuries of their existence?\r\nObviously this can only be answered by a comparison of the figures given\r\nby older writers, with the varieties as they are now in culture.\r\nMunting's drawings and descriptions are now nearly two centuries and a\r\nhalf old, but I do not find any real difference between his double\r\nvarieties and their present representatives. So it is in other cases in\r\nwhich improvements by crossing or the introduction of new forms does not\r\nvitiate the evidence. Double varieties, as a rule, are exactly the same\r\nnow, as they were at the time of their first introduction.\r\n\r\nIf this were otherwise one would expect that young double varieties\r\nshould in the main display only slight grades of the anomaly, and that\r\nthey would require centuries to reach their full development. Nothing of\r\nthe kind is on record. On the contrary the newest double sorts are said\r\nto be not only equal to their predecessors, but to excel them. As a rule\r\nsuch claims may be exaggerated, but not to any great extent. [513] This\r\nis proven in the simplest way by the result of our own experiment.\r\n\r\nIn the double field-marigold we have the very first generation of a\r\nvariety of pure and not hybrid origin. It shows the new attribute in its\r\nfull development. It has flower-heads nearly as completely filled as the\r\nbest double varieties of allied cultivated composites. In the second\r\ngeneration it reached heads with 200 rays each, and much larger numbers\r\nwill seldom be seen in older species on heads of equal size. I have\r\ncompared my novelty with the choicest double camomiles and others, but\r\nfailed to discover any real difference. Improvement of the variety\r\ndeveloped in the experiments carried on by myself seems to be excluded\r\nby the fact that it comes into conflict with the same difficulty that\r\nconfronts the older cultivated species, viz.: the increasing sterility\r\nof the race.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly evident that this double marigold is now quite constant.\r\nContinuously varying about a fixed average it may live through\r\ncenturies, but the mean and the limits will always remain the same, as\r\nin the case of the ever-sporting varieties.\r\n\r\nThroughout this lecture I have spoken of double flowers and double\r\nflower-heads of composites as of one single group. They are as nearly\r\nrelated from the hereditary point of [514] view, as they are divergent\r\nin other respects. It would be superfluous to dwell any longer upon the\r\ndifference between heads and flowers. But it is as well to point out,\r\nthat the term double flowers indicates a motley assemblage of different\r\nphenomena. The hen-and-chicken daisy, and the corresponding variety of\r\nthe garden cineraria (_Cineraria cruenta_), are extremes on one side.\r\nThe hen-and-chicken type occurs even in other families and is known to\r\nproduce most curious anomalies, as with _Scabiosa_, the supernumerary\r\nheads of which may be produced on long stalks and become branched\r\nthemselves in the same manner.\r\n\r\nPetalody of the stamens is well known to be the ordinary type of\r\ndoubling. But it is often accompanied by a multiplication of the organs,\r\nboth of the altered stamens and of the petals themselves. This\r\nproliferation may consist in median or in lateral cleavages, and in both\r\ncases the process may be repeated one or more times. It would be quite\r\nsuperfluous to give more details, which may be gathered from any\r\nmorphologic treatise on double flowers. But from the physiologic point\r\nof view all these cases are to be considered as one large group,\r\ncomplying with previously given definitions of the ever-sporting\r\nvarieties. They are very variable and wholly permanent. Obviously this\r\n[515] permanency agrees perfectly with the conception of their sudden\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[516]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XVIII\r\n\r\nNEW SPECIES OF _OENOTHERA_\r\n\r\nIn our experiments on the origin of peloric varieties and double flowers\r\nwe were guided in the choice of our material by a survey of the evidence\r\nalready at hand. We chose the types known to be most commonly produced\r\nanew, either in the wild state or under the conditions of cultivation.\r\nIn both instances our novelty was a variety in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword. Our pedigree-culture was mainly an experimental demonstration of\r\nthe validity of conclusions, which had previously been deduced from such\r\nobservations as can be made after the accidental birth of new forms.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, and even from these pedigree-experiments, it is\r\nscarcely allowable to draw conclusions as to the origin of real species.\r\nIf we want to know how species originate, it is obviously necessary to\r\nhave recourse to direct observation. The question is of the highest\r\nimportance, both for the theory of descent, and for our conception of\r\nthe real nature of [517] systematic affinities at large. Many authors\r\nhave tried to solve it on the ground of comparative studies and of\r\nspeculations upon the biologic relations of plants and animals. But in\r\nvain. Contradiction and doubt still reign supreme. All our hopes now\r\nrest on the result of experiments.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately such experiments seemed simply impossible a few years ago.\r\nWhat is to guide us in the choice of the material? The answer may only\r\nbe expected from a consideration of elementary species. For it is\r\nobvious that they only can be observed to originate, and that the\r\nsystematic species, because they are only artificial groups of lower\r\nunities, can never become the subject of successful experimental\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nIn previous lectures we tried to clear up the differences existing\r\nbetween nearly related elementary species. We have seen that they affect\r\nall of the attributes of the plants, each of them changing in some\r\nmeasure all of the organs. Nevertheless they were due to distinct\r\nunities and of the lowest possible degree. Such unit-steps may therefore\r\nbe expected to become visible some time or other by artificial means. On\r\nthe other hand, mutations as a rule make their appearance in groups, and\r\nthere are many systematic species which on close inspection [518] have\r\nbeen shown to be in reality composite assemblages. Roses and brambles,\r\nhawkweeds and willows are the best known examples. Violets and _Draba\r\nverna_, dandelions and helianthemums and many other instances were dealt\r\nwith in previous lectures. Even wheat and barley and corn afford\r\ninstances of large groups of elementary species. Formerly mixed in the\r\nfields, they became separated during the last century, and now\r\nconstitute constant races, which, for brevity's sake, are dealt with\r\nunder the name of varieties.\r\n\r\nIn such groups of nearly allied forms the single members must evidently\r\nbe of common origin. It is not necessary for them to have originated all\r\nin the same place or at the same time. In some cases, as with _Draba\r\nverna_, the present geographic distribution points to a common\r\nbirthplace, from whence the various forms may about the same period have\r\nradiated in all directions. The violets on the other hand seem to\r\ninclude widely diffused original forms, from which branches have started\r\nat different times and in different localities.\r\n\r\nThe origin of such groups of allied forms must therefore be the object\r\nof our research. Perhaps we might find a whole group, perhaps only part\r\nof it. In my opinion we have the right to assume that if _Draba_ and\r\nviolets and [519] others have formerly mutated in this way, other\r\nspecies must at present be in the same changeable condition. And if\r\nmutations in groups, or such periodic mutations should be the rule, it\r\nis to be premised that these periods recur from time to time, and that\r\nmany species must even now be in mutating condition, while others are\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIt is readily granted that the constant condition of species is the\r\nnormal one, and that mutating periods must be the exception. This fact\r\ndoes not tend to increase our prospect of discovering a species in a\r\nstate of mutability. Many species will have to be tested before finding\r\nan instance. On the other hand, a direct trial seems to be the only way\r\nto reach the goal. No such special guides as those that led us to the\r\nchoice of pelories and double flowers are available. The only indication\r\nof value is the presumption that a condition of mutability might be\r\ncombined with a general state of variability at large, and that groups\r\nof plants of very uniform features might be supposed to be constant in\r\nthis respect too. On the contrary, anomalies and deviations if existent\r\nin the members of one strain, or found together in one native locality\r\nof a species, might be considered as an indication in the desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFew plants vary in the wild state in such a [520] measure as to give\r\ndistinct indications. All have to be given a trial in the garden under\r\nconditions as similar as possible to their natural environments.\r\nCultivated plants are of course to be excluded. Practically they have\r\nalready undergone the experience in question and can not be expected to\r\nchange their habits soon enough. Moreover they are often of hybrid\r\norigin. The best way is to experiment with the native plants of one's\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nI have made such experiments with some hundred species that grow wild in\r\nHolland. Some were very variable, as for instance, the jointed charlock\r\n(_Raphanus Raphanistrum_) and the narrow-leaved plantain (_Plantago\r\nlanceolata_). Others seemed more uniform, but many species, collected\r\nwithout showing any malformation, subsequently produced them in my\r\ngarden, either on the introduced plants themselves or among their\r\noffspring. From this initial material I have procured a long series of\r\nhereditary races, each with some peculiar anomaly for its special\r\ncharacter. But this result was only a secondary gain, a meager\r\nconsolation for the negative fact that no real mutability could be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nMy plants were mostly annuals or biennials, or such perennials as under\r\nadequate treatment might produce flowers and seeds during their [521]\r\nfirst summer. It would be of no special use to enumerate them. The\r\nnegative result does not apply to the species as such, but only to the\r\nindividual strain, which I collected and cultivated. Many species, which\r\nare quite constant with us, may be expected to be mutable in other parts\r\nof their range.\r\n\r\nOnly one of all my tests met my expectations. This species proved to be\r\nin a state of mutation, producing new elementary forms continually, and\r\nit soon became the chief member of my experimental garden. It was one of\r\nthe evening primroses.\r\n\r\nSeveral evening-primroses have at different times been introduced into\r\nEuropean gardens from America. From thence they have spread into the\r\nvicinity, becoming common and exhibiting the behavior of indigenous\r\ntypes. _Oenothera biennis_ was introduced about 1614 from Virginia, or\r\nnearly three centuries ago. _O. muricata_, with small corollas and\r\nnarrow leaves, was introduced in the year 1789 by John Hunneman, and _O.\r\nsuaveolens_, or sweet-scented primrose, a form very similar to the\r\n_biennis_, about the same time, in 1778, by John Fothergill. This form\r\nis met with in different parts of France, while the _biennis_ and\r\n_muricata_ are very common in the sandy regions of Holland, where I have\r\nobserved them for [522] more than 40 years. They are very constant and\r\nhave proven so in my experiments. Besides these three species, the\r\nlarge-flowered evening-primrose, or _Oenothera lamarckiana_, is found in\r\nsome localities in Holland and elsewhere. We know little concerning its\r\norigin. It is supposed to have come from America in the same way as its\r\ncongeners, but as yet I have not been able to ascertain on what grounds\r\nthis supposition rests. As far as I know, it has not been seen growing\r\nwild in this country, though it may have been overlooked. The fact that\r\nthe species of this group are subject to many systematic controversies\r\nand are combined by different writers into systematic species in\r\ndifferent ways, being often considered as varieties of one or two types,\r\neasily accounts for it having been overlooked. However, it would be of\r\ngreat interest to ascertain whether _O. lamarckiana_ yet grows in\r\nAmerica, and whether it is in the same state of mutability here as it is\r\nin Holland.\r\n\r\nThe large-flowered evening-primrose was also cultivated about the\r\nbeginning of the last century in the gardens of the Museum d'Histoire\r\nNaturelle, at Paris, where it was noticed by Lamarck, who at once\r\ndistinguished it as an undescribed species. He wrote a complete\r\ndescription [523] of it and his type specimens are still preserved in\r\nthe herbarium of the Museum, where I have compared them with the plants\r\nof my own culture. Shortly afterwards it was renamed by Seringe, in\r\nhonor of its eminent discoverer, whose name it now bears. So Lamarck\r\nunconsciously discovered and described himself the plant, which after a\r\ncentury, was to become the means of an empirical demonstration of his\r\nfar-reaching views on the common origin of all living beings.\r\n\r\n_Oenothera lamarckiana_ is considered in Europe as a garden-plant, much\r\nprized for parks and ornamental planting. It is cultivated by\r\nseed-merchants and offered for sale. It has escaped from gardens, and\r\nhaving abundant means for rapid multiplication, has become wild in many\r\nplaces. As far as I know its known localities are small, and it is to be\r\npresumed that in each of them the plant has escaped separately from\r\nculture. It was in this state that I first met with this beautiful\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nLamarck's evening-primrose is a stately plant, with a stout stem,\r\nattaining often a height of 1.6 meters and more. When not crowded the\r\nmain stem is surrounded by a large circle of smaller branches, growing\r\nupwards from its base so as often to form a dense bush. These branches\r\nin their turn have numerous lateral [524] branches. Most of them are\r\ncrowned with flowers in summer, which regularly succeed each other,\r\nleaving behind them long spikes of young fruits. The flowers are large\r\nand of a bright yellow color, attracting immediate attention, even from\r\na distance. They open towards evening, as the name indicates, and are\r\npollinated by humble-bees and moths. On bright days their duration is\r\nconfined to one evening, but during cloudy weather they may still be\r\nfound open on the following morning. Contrary to their congeners they\r\nare dependent on visiting insects for pollination. _O. biennis_ and _O.\r\nmuricata_ have their stigmas in immediate contact with the anthers\r\nwithin the flower-buds, and as the anthers open in the morning preceding\r\nthe evening of the display of the petals, fecundation is usually\r\naccomplished before the insects are let in. But in _O. lamarckiana_ no\r\nsuch self-fertilization takes place. The stigmas are above the anthers\r\nin the bud, and as the style increases in length at the time of the\r\nopening of the corolla, they are elevated above the anthers and do not\r\nreceive the pollen. Ordinarily the flowers remained sterile if not\r\nvisited by insects or pollinated by myself, although rare instances of\r\nself-fertilization were seen.\r\n\r\nIn falling off, the flowers leave behind them a stout ovary with four\r\ncells and a large number [525] of young seeds. The capsule when ripe,\r\nopens at its summit with four valves, and contains often from two to\r\nthree hundred seeds. A hundred capsules on the main stem is an average\r\nestimate, and the lateral branches may ripen even still more fruits, by\r\nwhich a very rapid dissemination is ensured.\r\n\r\nThis striking species was found in a locality near Hilvers, in the\r\nvicinity of Amsterdam, where it grew in some thousands of individuals.\r\nOrdinarily biennial, it produces rosettes in the first, and stems in the\r\nsecond year. Both the stems and the rosettes were at once seen to be\r\nhighly variable, and soon distinct varieties could be distinguished\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery of this locality was made in 1886. Afterwards I\r\nvisited it many times, often weekly or even daily during the first few\r\nyears, and always at least once a year up to the present time. This\r\nstately plant showed the long-sought peculiarity of producing a number\r\nof new species every year. Some of them were observed directly on the\r\nfield, either as stems or as rosettes. The latter could be transplanted\r\ninto my garden for further observation, and the stems yielded seeds to\r\nbe sown under like control. Others were too weak to live a sufficiently\r\nlong time in the field. They were discovered by sowing seed from\r\nindifferent plants [526] of the wild locality in the garden. A third and\r\nlast method of getting still more new species from the original strain,\r\nwas the repetition of the sowing process, by saving and sowing the seed\r\nwhich ripened on the introduced plants. These various methods have led\r\nto the discovery of over a dozen new types, never previously observed or\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nLeaving the physiologic side of the relations of these new forms for the\r\nnext lecture, it would be profitable to give a short description of the\r\nseveral novelties. To this end they may be combined under five different\r\nheads, according to their systematic value. The first head includes\r\nthose which are evidently to be considered as varieties, in the narrower\r\nsense of the word, as previously given. The second and third heads\r\nindicate the real progressive elementary species, first those which are\r\nas strong as the parent-species, and secondly a group of weaker types,\r\napparently not destined to be successful. Under the fourth head I shall\r\ninclude some inconstant forms, and under the last head those that are\r\norganically incomplete.\r\n\r\nOf varieties with a negative attribute, or real retrograde varieties, I\r\nhave found three, all of them in a flowering condition in the field. I\r\nhave given them the names of _laevifolia_, _brevistylis_ and _nanella_.\r\n\r\n[527] The _laevifolia_, or smooth-leaved variety, was one of the very\r\nfirst deviating types found in the original field. This was in the\r\nsummer of 1887, seventeen years ago. It formed a little group of plants\r\ngrowing at some distance from the main body, in the same field. I found\r\nsome rosettes and some flowering stems and sowed some seed in the fall.\r\nThe variety has been quite constant in the field, neither increasing in\r\nnumber of individual plants nor changing its place, though now closely\r\nsurrounded by other _Lamarckiana_s. In my garden it has proved to be\r\nconstant from seed, never reverting to the original _lamarckiana_,\r\nprovided intercrossing was excluded.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly distinguished from Lamarck's evening-primrose by its\r\nsmooth leaves, as the name indicates. The leaves of the original form\r\nshow numerous sinuosities in their blades, not at the edge, but anywhere\r\nbetween the veins. The blade shows numbers of convexities on either\r\nsurface, the whole surface being undulated in this manner; it lacks also\r\nthe brightness of the ordinary evening-primrose or _Oenothera biennis_.\r\n\r\nThese undulations are lacking or at least very rare on the leaves of the\r\nnew _laevifolia_. Ordinarily they are wholly wanting, but at times\r\nsingle leaves with slight manifestations of this [528] character may\r\nmake their appearance. They warn us that the capacity for such\r\nsinuosities is not wholly lost, but only lies dormant in the new\r\nvariety. It is reduced to a latent state, exactly as are the apparently\r\nlost characters of so many ordinary horticultural varieties.\r\n\r\nLacking the undulations, the _laevifolia_ leaves are smooth and bright.\r\nThey are a little narrower and more slender than those of the\r\n_lamarckiana_. The convexities and concavities of leaves are said to be\r\nuseful in dry seasons, but during wet summers, such as those of the last\r\nfew years, they must be considered as very harmful, as they retain some\r\nof the water which falls on the plants, prolonging the action of the\r\nwater on the leaves. This is considered by some writers to be of some\r\nutility after slight showers, but was observed to be a source of\r\nweakness during wet weather in my garden, preventing the leaves from\r\ndrying. Whether the _laevifolia_ would do better under such\r\ncircumstances, remains to be tested.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the _laevifolia_ are also in a slight degree different\r\nfrom those of _lamarckiana_. The yellow color is paler and the petals\r\nare smoother. Later, in the fall, on the weaker side branches these\r\ndifferences increase. The _laevifolia_ petals become smaller and are\r\noften not emarginated at the apex, becoming ovate [529] instead of\r\nobcordate. This shape is often the most easily recognized and most\r\nstriking mark of the variety. In respect to the reproductive organs, the\r\nfertility and abundance of good seed, the _laevifolia_ is by no means\r\ninferior or superior to the original species.\r\n\r\n_O. brevistylis_, or the short-styled evening primrose, is the most\r\ncurious of all my new forms. It has very short styles, which bring the\r\nstigmas only up to the throat of the calyx tube, instead of upwards of\r\nthe anthers. The stigmas themselves are of a different shape, more\r\nflattened and not cylindrical. The pollen falls from the anthers\r\nabundantly on them, and germinates in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\nThe ovary which in _lamarckiana_ and in all other new forms is wholly\r\nunderneath the calyx-tube, is here only partially so. This tube is\r\ninserted at some distance under its summit. The insertion divides the\r\novary into two parts: an upper and a lower one. The upper part is much\r\nreduced in breadth and somewhat attenuated, simulating a prolongation of\r\nthe base of the style. The lower part is also reduced, but in another\r\nmanner. At the time of flowering it is like the ovary of _lamarckiana_,\r\nneither smaller nor larger. But it is reached by only a very few\r\npollen-tubes, and is therefore always incompletely fertilized. It does\r\n[530] not fall off after the fading away of the flower, as unfertilized\r\novaries usually do; neither does it grow out, nor assume the upright\r\nposition of normal capsules. It is checked in its development, and at\r\nthe time of ripening it is nearly of the same length as in the\r\nbeginning. Many of them contain no good seeds at all; from others I have\r\nsucceeded in saving only a hundred seeds from thousands of capsules.\r\n\r\nThese seeds, if purely pollinated, and with the exclusion of the visits\r\nof insects, reproduce the variety, entirely and without any reversion to\r\nthe _lamarckiana_ type.\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the detailed structures is the form of the flower-buds.\r\nThey lack the high stigma placed above the anthers, which in the\r\n_lamarckiana_, by the vigorous growth of the style, extends the calyx\r\nand renders the flower bud thinner and more slender. Those of the\r\n_brevistylis_ are therefore broader and more swollen. It is quite easy\r\nto distinguish the individuals by this striking character alone,\r\nalthough it differs from the parent in other particulars.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the _O. brevistylis_ are more rounded at the tip, but the\r\ndifference is only pronounced at times, slightly in the adult rosettes,\r\nbut more clearly on the growing summits of the stems and branches. By\r\nthis character, the plants [531] may be discerned among the others, some\r\nweeks before the flowers begin to show themselves. But the character by\r\nwhich the plants may be most easily recognized from a distance in the\r\nfield is the failure of the fruits. They were found there nearly every\r\nyear in varying, but always small numbers.\r\n\r\nLeaving the short-styled primrose, we come now to the last of our group\r\nof retrograde varieties. This is the _O. nanella_, or the dwarf, and is\r\na most attractive little plant. It is very short of stature, reaching\r\noften a height of only 20-30 cm., or less than one-fourth of that of the\r\nparent. It commences flowering at a height of 10-15 cm., while the\r\nparent-form often measures nearly a meter at this stage of its\r\ndevelopment. Being so very dwarfed the large flowers are all the more\r\nstriking. They are hardly inferior to those of the _lamarckiana_, and\r\nagree with them in structure. When they fade away the spike is rapidly\r\nlengthened, and often becomes much longer than the lower or vegetative\r\npart of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs are one of the most common mutations in my garden, and were\r\nobserved in the native locality and also grown from seeds saved there.\r\nOnce produced they are absolutely constant. I have tried many thousands\r\nof seeds from various dwarf mutants, and never observed [532] any trace\r\nof reversion to the _lamarckiana_ type. I have also cultivated them in\r\nsuccessive generations with the same result. In a former lecture we have\r\nseen that contrary to the general run of horticultural belief, varieties\r\nare as constant as the best species, if kept free from hybrid\r\nadmixtures. This is a general rule, and the exceptions, or cases of\r\natavism are extremely rare. In this respect it is of great interest to\r\nobserve that this constancy is not an acquired quality, but is to be\r\nconsidered as innate, because it is already fully developed at the very\r\nmoment when the original mutation takes place.\r\n\r\nFrom its first leaves to the rosette period, and through this to the\r\nlengthening of the stem, the dwarfs are easily distinguished from any\r\nother of their congeners. The most remarkable feature is the shape of\r\nthe leaves. They are broader and shorter, and especially at the base\r\nthey are broadened in such a way as to become apparently sessile. The\r\nstalk is very brittle, and any rough treatment may cause the leaves to\r\nbreak off. The young seedlings are recognizable by the shape of the\r\nfirst two or three leaves, and when more of them are produced, the\r\nrosettes become dense and strikingly different from others. Later leaves\r\nare more nearly like the parent-type, but the petioles remain short. The\r\nbases of the blades are frequently [533] almost cordate, the laminae\r\nthemselves varying from oblong-ovate to ovate in outline. The stems are\r\noften quite unbranched, or branched only at the base of the spike.\r\nStrong secondary stems are a striking attribute of the _lamarckiana_\r\nparent, but they are lacking, or almost so in the dwarfs. The stem is\r\nstraight and short, and this, combined with the large crown of bright\r\nflowers, makes the dwarfs eminently suitable for bed or border plants.\r\nUnfortunately they are very sensitive, especially to wet weather.\r\n\r\n_Oenothera gigas_ and _O. rubrinervis_, or the giant, and the red-veined\r\nevening-primroses, are the names given to two robust and stout species,\r\nwhich seem to be equal in vigor to the parent-plant, while diverging\r\nfrom it in striking characters. Both are true elementary species,\r\ndifferentiated from _lamarckiana_ in nearly all their organs and\r\nqualities, but not showing any preponderating character of a retrograde\r\nnature. Their differences may be compared with those of the elementary\r\nspecies of other genera, as for instance, of _Draba_, or of violets, as\r\nwill be seen by their description.\r\n\r\nThe giant evening-primrose, though not taller in stature than _O.\r\nlamarckiana_, deserves its name because it is so much stouter in all\r\nrespects. [534] The stems are robust, often with twice the diameter of\r\n_lamarckiana_ throughout. The internodes are shorter, and the leaves\r\nmore numerous, covering the stems with a denser foliage. This shortness\r\nof the internodes extends itself to the spike, and for this reason the\r\nflowers and fruits grow closer together than on the parent-plant. Hence\r\nthe crown of bright flowers, opening each evening, is more dense and\r\nmore strikingly brilliant, so much the more so as the individual flowers\r\nare markedly larger than those of the parents. In connection with these\r\ncharacters, the flower-buds are seen to be much stouter than those of\r\n_lamarckiana_. The fruits attain only half the normal size, but are\r\nbroader and contain fewer, but larger seeds.\r\n\r\nThe _rubrinervis_ is in many respects a counterpart to the _gigasv, but\r\nits stature is more slender. The spikes and flowers are those of the\r\n_lamarckianav, but the bracts are narrower. Red veins and red streaks on\r\nthe fruits afford a striking differentiating mark, though they are not\r\nabsolutely lacking in the parent-species. A red hue may be seen on the\r\ncalyx, and even the yellow color of the petals is somewhat deepened in\r\nthe same way. Young plants are often marked by the pale red tinge of the\r\nmid-veins, but in adult rosettes, or from lack of sunshine, this hue is\r\noften very faint.\r\n\r\n[535] The leaves are narrow, and a curious feature of this species is\r\nthe great brittleness of the leaves and stems, especially in annual\r\nindividuals, especially in those that make their stem and flowers in the\r\nfirst year. High turgidity and weak development of the mechanical and\r\nsupporting tissues are the anatomical cause of this deficiency, the\r\nbast-fibers showing thinner walls than those of the parent-type under\r\nthe microscope. Young stems of _rubrinervis_ may be broken off by a\r\nsharp stroke, and show a smooth rupture across all the tissues, while\r\nthose of _lamarckiana_ are very tough and strong.\r\n\r\nBoth the giant and the red-veined species are easily recognized in the\r\nrosette-stage. Even the very young seedlings of the latter are clearly\r\ndifferentiated from the _lamarckiana_, but often a dozen leaves are\r\nrequired, before the difference may be seen. Under such circumstances\r\nthe young plants must reach an age of about two months before it is\r\npossible to discern their characters, or at least before these\r\ncharacters have become reliable enough to enable us to judge of each\r\nindividual without doubt. But the divergencies rapidly become greater.\r\nThe leaves of _O. gigas_ are broader, of a deeper green, the blade more\r\nsharply set off against the stalk, all the rosettes [536] becoming stout\r\nand crowded with leaves. Those of _O. rubrinervis_ on the contrary are\r\nthin, of a paler green and with a silvery white surface; the blades are\r\nelliptic, often being only 2 cm. or less in width. They are acute at the\r\napex and gradually narrowed into the petiole.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that such pale narrow leaves must produce smaller\r\nquantities of organic food than the darker green and broad organs of the\r\n_gigas_. Perhaps this fact is accountable partly, at least, for the more\r\nrobust growth of the giant in the second year. Perhaps also some\r\nrelation exists between this difference in chemical activity and the\r\ntendency to become annual or biennial. The _gigas_, as a rule, produces\r\nfar more, and the _rubrinervis_ far less biennial plants than the\r\n_lamarckiana_. Annual culture for the one is as unreliable as biennial\r\nculture for the other. _Rubrinervis_ may be annual in apparently all\r\nspecimens, in sunny seasons, but _gigas_ will ordinarily remain in the\r\nstate of rosettes during the entire first summer. It would be very\r\ninteresting to obtain a fuller insight into the relation of the length\r\nof life to other qualities, but as yet the facts can only be detailed as\r\nthey stand.\r\n\r\nBoth of these stout species have been found [537] quite constant from\r\nthe very first moment of their appearance. I have cultivated them from\r\nseed in large numbers, and they have never reverted to the\r\n_lamarckiana_. From this they have inherited the mutability or the\r\ncapacity of producing at their turn new mutants. But they seem to have\r\ndone so incompletely, changing in the direction of more absolute\r\nconstancy. This was especially observed in the case of _rubrinervis_,\r\nwhich is not of such rare occurrence as _O. gigas_, and which it has\r\nbeen possible to study in large numbers of individuals. So for instance,\r\nthe \"red-veins\" have never produced any dwarfs, notwithstanding they are\r\nproduced very often by the parent-type. And in crossing experiments also\r\nthe red-veins gave proof of the absence of a mutative capacity for their\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nLeaving the robust novelties, we may now take up a couple of forms,\r\nwhich are equally constants and differentiated from the parent species\r\nin exactly the same manner, though by other characters, but which are so\r\nobviously weak as to have no manifest chance of self maintenance in the\r\nwild state. These are the whitish and the oblong-leaved\r\nevening-primroses or the _Oenothera albida_ and _oblonga_.\r\n\r\n_Oenothera albida_ is a very weak species, with whitish, narrow leaves,\r\nwhich are evidently incapable [538] of producing sufficient quantities\r\nof organic food. The young seedling-plants are soon seen to lag behind,\r\nand if no care is taken of them they are overgrown by their neighbors.\r\nIt is necessary to take them out, to transplant them into pots with\r\nrichly manured soil, and to give them all the care that should be given\r\nto weak and sickly plants. If this is done fully grown rosettes may be\r\nproduced, which are strong enough to keep through the winter. In this\r\ncase the individual leaves become stronger and broader, with oblong\r\nblades and long stalks, but retain their characteristic whitish color.\r\n\r\nIn the second year the stems become relatively stout. Not that they\r\nbecome equal to those of _lamarckiana_, but they become taller than\r\nmight have been expected from the weakness of the plants in the previous\r\nstages. The flowers and racemes are nearly as large as those of the\r\nparent-form, the fruits only a little thinner and containing a smaller\r\nquantity of seed. From these seeds I have grown a second and a third\r\ngeneration, and observed that the plants remain true to their type.\r\n\r\n_O. oblonga_ may be grown either as an annual, or as a biennial. In the\r\nfirst case it is very slender and weak, bearing only small fruits and\r\nfew seeds. In the alternative case however, it [539] becomes densely\r\nbranched, bearing flowers on quite a number of racemes and yielding a\r\nfull harvest of seeds. But it always remains a small plant, reaching\r\nabout half the height of that of _lamarckiana_.\r\n\r\nWhen very young it has broader leaves, but in the adult rosettes the\r\nleaves become very narrow, but fleshy and of a bright green color. They\r\nare so crowded as to leave no space between them unoccupied. The\r\nflowering spikes of the second year bear long leaf-like bracts under the\r\nfirst few flowers, but those arising later are much shorter. Numerous\r\nlittle capsules cover the axis of the spike after the fading away of the\r\npetals, constituting a very striking differentiating mark. This species\r\nalso was found to be quite constant, if grown from pure seed.\r\n\r\nWe have now given the descriptions of seven new forms, which diverge in\r\ndifferent ways from the parent-type. All were absolutely constant from\r\nseed. Hundreds or thousands of seedlings may have arisen, but they\r\nalways come true and never revert to the original _O. lamarckiana_ type.\r\nFrom this they have inherited the condition of mutability, either\r\ncompletely or partly, and according to this they may be able to produce\r\nnew forms themselves. But this occurs only rarely, and combinations of\r\nmore than one [540] type in one single plant seem to be limited to the\r\nadmixture of the dwarf stature with the characters of the other new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThese seven novelties do not comprise the whole range of the new\r\nproductions of my _O. lamarckiana_. But they are the most interesting\r\nones. Others, as the _O. semilata_ and the _O. leptocarpa_ are quite as\r\nconstant and quite as distinct, but have no special claims for a closer\r\ndescription. Others again were sterile, or too weak to reach the adult\r\nstage and to yield seeds, and no reliable description or appreciation\r\ncan be given on the ground of the appearance of a single individual.\r\n\r\nContrasted with these groups of constant forms are three inconstant\r\ntypes which we now take up. They belong to two different groups,\r\naccording to the cause of their inconstancy. In one species which I call\r\n_O. lata_, the question of stability or instability must remain wholly\r\nunsolved, as only pistillate flowers are produced, and no seed can be\r\nfertilized save by the use of the pollen of another form, and therefore\r\nby hybridization. The other head comprises two fertile forms, _O.\r\nscintillans_ and _O. elliptica_, which may easily be fertilized with\r\ntheir own pollen, but which gave a progeny only partly similar to the\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe _Oenothera lata_ is a very distinct form [541] which was found more\r\nthan once in the field, and recently (1902) in a luxuriant flowering\r\nspecimen. It has likewise been raised from seeds collected in different\r\nyears at the original station. It is also wholly pistillate. Apparently\r\nthe anthers are robust, but they are dry, wrinkled and nearly devoid of\r\ncontents. The inner wall of cells around the groups of pollen grow out\r\ninstead of being resorbed, partly filling the cavity which is left free\r\nby the miscarriage of the pollen-grains. This miscarriage does not\r\naffect all the grains in the same degree, and under the microscope a few\r\nof them with an apparently normal structure may be seen. But the\r\ncontents are not normally developed, and I have tried in vain to obtain\r\nfertilization with a large number of flowers. Only by\r\ncross-fertilization does _O. lata_ produce seeds, and then as freely as\r\nthe other species when self-fertilized. Of course its chance of ever\r\nfounding a wild type is precluded by this defect.\r\n\r\n_O. lata_ is a low plant, with a limp stem, bent tips and branches, all\r\nvery brittle, but with dense foliage and luxuriant growth. It has bright\r\nyellow flowers and thick flower-buds. But for an unknown reason the\r\npetals are apt to unfold only partially and to remain wrinkled\r\nthroughout the flowering time. The stigmas are slightly divergent from\r\nthe normal type, [542] also being partly united with one another, and\r\nlaterally with the summit of the style, but without detriment to their\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nYoung seedlings of _lata_ may be recognized by the very first leaves.\r\nThey have a nearly orbicular shape and are very sharply set off against\r\ntheir stalk. The surface is very uneven, with convexities and\r\nconcavities on both sides. This difference is lessened in the later\r\nleaves, but remains visible throughout the whole life of the plant, even\r\nduring the flowering season. Broad, sinuate leaves with rounded tips are\r\na sure mark of _O. lata_. On the summits of the stems and branches they\r\nare crowded so as to form rosettes.\r\n\r\nConcerning inheritance of these characteristics nothing can be directly\r\nasserted because of the lack of pollen. The new type can only be\r\nperpetuated by crosses, either with the parent form or some other\r\nmutant. I have fertilized it, as a rule, with _lamarckiana_ pollen, but\r\nhave often also used that from _nanella_ and others. In doing so, the\r\n_lata_ repeats its character in part of its offspring. This part seems\r\nto be independent of the nature of the pollen used, but is very variable\r\naccording to external circumstances. On the average one-fourth of the\r\noffspring become _lata_, the others assuming the type of the\r\npollen-parent, if this was a _lamarckiana_ or [543] partly this type and\r\npartly that of any other of the new species derived from _lamarckiana_,\r\nthat might have been used as the pollen-parent. This average seems to be\r\na general rule, recurring in all experiments, and remaining unchanged\r\nthrough a long series of successive generations. The fluctuations around\r\nthis mean go up to nearly 50% and down nearly to 1%, but, as in other\r\ncases, such extreme deviations from the average are met with only\r\nexceptionally.\r\n\r\nThe second category includes the inconstant but perfectly fertile\r\nspecies. I have already given the names of the only two forms, which\r\ndeserve to be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nOne of them is called _scintillans_ or the shiny evening-primrose,\r\nbecause its leaves are of a deep green color with smooth surfaces,\r\nglistening in the sunshine. On the young rosettes these leaves are\r\nsomewhat broader, and afterwards somewhat narrower than those of _O.\r\nlamarckiana_ at the corresponding ages. The plants themselves always\r\nremain small, never reaching the stature of the ancestral type. They are\r\nlikewise much less branched. They can easily be cultivated in annual\r\ngenerations, but then do not become as fully developed and as fertile,\r\nas when flowering in the second year. The flowers have the same\r\nstructure as those of the _lamarckiana_, but are of a smaller size.\r\n\r\n[544] Fertilizing the flowers artificially with their own pollen,\r\nexcluding the visiting insects by means of paper bags, and saving and\r\nsowing the seed of each individual separately, furnishes all the\r\nrequisites for the estimation of the degree of stability of this\r\nspecies. In the first few weeks the seed-pans do not show any\r\nunequality, and often the young plants must be replanted at wider\r\nintervals, before anything can be made out with certainty. But as soon\r\nas the rosettes begin to fill it becomes manifest that some of them are\r\nmore backward than others in size. Soon the smaller ones show their\r\ndeeper green and broader leaves, and thereby display the attributes of\r\nthe _scintillans_. The other grow faster and stronger and exhibit all\r\nthe characteristics of ordinary _lamarckiana_s.\r\n\r\nThe numerical proportion of these two groups has been found different on\r\ndifferent occasions. Some plants give about one-third _scintillans_ and\r\ntwo-thirds _lamarckiana_, while the progeny of individuals of another\r\nstrain show exactly the reverse proportion.\r\n\r\nTwo points deserve to be noticed. First the progeny of the _scintillans_\r\nappears to be mutable in a large degree, exceeding even the\r\n_lamarckiana_. The same forms that are produced most often by the\r\nparent-family are also most ordinarily [545] met with among the\r\noffspring of the shiny evening-primrose. They are _oblonga_, _lata_ and\r\n_nanella_. _Oblonga_ was observed at times to constitute as much as 1%\r\nor more of the sowings of _scintillans_, while _lata_ and _nanella_ were\r\ncommonly seen only in a few scattering individuals, although seldom\r\nlacking in experiments of a sufficient size.\r\n\r\nSecondly the instability seems to be a constant quality, although the\r\nwords themselves are at first sight, contradictory. I mean to convey the\r\nconception that the degree of instability remains unchanged during\r\nsuccessive generations. This is a very curious fact, and strongly\r\nreminds us of the hereditary conditions of striped-flower varieties.\r\nBut, on the contrary, the atavists, which are here the individuals with\r\nthe stature and the characteristics of the _lamarckiana_, have become\r\n_lamarckiana_s in their hereditary qualities, too. If their seed is\r\nsaved and sown, their progeny does not contain any _scintillans_, or at\r\nleast no more than might arise by ordinary mutations.\r\n\r\nOne other inconstant new species is to be noted, but as it was very rare\r\nboth in the field and in my cultures, and as it was difficult of\r\ncultivation, little can as yet be said about it. It is the _Oenothera\r\nelliptica_, with narrow elliptical leaves and also with elliptical\r\npetals. It repeats [546] its type only in a very small proportion of its\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nAll in all we thus have a group of a dozen new types, springing from an\r\noriginal form in one restricted locality, and seen to grow there, or\r\narising in the garden from seeds collected from the original locality.\r\nWithout any doubt the germs of the new types are fully developed within\r\nthe seed, ready to be evolved at the time of germination. More favorable\r\nconditions in the field would no doubt allow all of the described new\r\nspecies to unfold their attributes there, and to come into competition\r\nwith each other and with the common parents. But obviously this is only\r\nof secondary importance, and has no influence on the fact that a number\r\nof new types, analogous to the older swarms of _Draba_, _Viola_ and of\r\nmany other polymorphous species, have been seen to arise directly in the\r\nwild state.\r\n\r\n\r\n[547]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XIX\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTAL PEDIGREE-CULTURES\r\n\r\nThe observation of the production of mutants in the field at Hilversum,\r\nand the subsequent cultivation of the new types in the garden at\r\nAmsterdam, gives ample proof of the mutability of plants. Furthermore it\r\nfurnishes an analogy with the hypothetical origin of the swarms of\r\nspecies of _Draba_ and _Viola_. Last but not least important it affords\r\nmaterial for a complete systematic and morphologic study of the newly\r\narisen group of forms.\r\n\r\nThe physiologic laws, however, which govern this process are only very\r\nimperfectly revealed by such a study. The instances are too few.\r\nMoreover the seeds from which the mutants spring, escape observation. It\r\nis simply impossible to tell from which individual plants they have been\r\nderived. The laevifolia and the brevistylis have been found almost every\r\nyear, the first always recurring on the same spot, the second on various\r\nparts of the original field. It is therefore allowable to assume a\r\ncommon [548] origin for all the observed individuals of either strain.\r\nBut whether, besides this, similar strains are produced anew by the old\r\n_lamarckiana_ group, it is impossible to decide on the sole ground of\r\nthese field-observations.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good with the other novelties. Even if one of them should\r\ngerminate repeatedly, without ever opening its flowers, the possibility\r\ncould not be excluded that the seeds might have come originally from the\r\nsame capsule but lain dormant in the earth during periods of unequal\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nOther objections might be cited that can only be met by direct and fully\r\ncontrolled experiments. Next to the native locality comes the\r\nexperimental garden. Here the rule prevails that every plant must be\r\nfertilized with pollen of its own, or with pollen of other individuals\r\nof known and recorded origin. The visits of insects must be guarded\r\nagainst, and no seeds should be saved from flowers which have been\r\nallowed to open without this precaution. Then the seeds of each\r\nindividual must be saved and sown separately, so as to admit of an\r\nappreciation, and if necessary, a numerical determination of the nature\r\nof its progeny. And last but not least the experiments should be\r\nconducted in a similar manner during a series of successive years.\r\n\r\n[549] I have made four such experiments, each comprising the handling of\r\nmany thousands of individual plants, and lasting through five to nine\r\ngenerations. At the beginning the plants were biennial, as in the native\r\nlocality, but later I learned to cultivate them in annual generations.\r\nThey have been started from different plants and seeds, introduced from\r\nthe original field into my garden at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIt seems sufficient to describe here one of these pedigree-cultures, as\r\nthe results of all four were similar. In the fall of 1886 I took nine\r\nlarge rosettes from the field, planted them together on an isolated spot\r\nin the garden, and harvested their seeds the next year. These nine\r\noriginal plants are therefore to be considered as constituting the first\r\ngeneration of my race. The second generation was sown in 1888 and\r\nflowered in 1889. It at once yielded the expected result. 15,000\r\nseedlings were tested and examined, and among them 10 showed diverging\r\ncharacters. They were properly protected, and proved to belong to two\r\nnew types. 5 of them were _lata_ and 5 _nanella_. They flowered next\r\nyear and displayed all the characters as described in our preceding\r\nlecture. Intermediates between them and the general type were not found,\r\nand no indication of their appearance was noted in their parents. [550]\r\nThey came into existence at once, fully equipped, without preparation or\r\nintermediate steps. No series of generations, no selection, no struggle\r\nfor existence was needed. It was a sudden leap into another type, a\r\nsport in the best acceptation of the word. It fulfilled my hopes, and at\r\nonce gave proof of the possibility of the direct observation of the\r\norigin of species, and of the experimental control thereof.\r\n\r\nThe third generation was in the main a repetition of the second. I tried\r\nsome 10,000 seedlings and found three _lata_ and three _nanella_, or\r\nnearly the same proportion as in the first instance. But besides these a\r\n_rubrinervis_ made its appearance and flowered the following year. This\r\nfact at once revealed the possibility that the instability of\r\n_lamarckiana_ might not be restricted to the three new types now under\r\nobservation. Hence the question arose how it would be possible to obtain\r\nother types or to find them if they were present. It was necessary to\r\nhave better methods of cultivation and examination of the young plants.\r\nAccordingly I devoted the three succeeding years to working on this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nI found that it was not at all necessary to sow any larger quantities of\r\nseed, but that the young plants must have room enough to develop into\r\nfull and free rosettes. Moreover I observed [551] that the attributes of\r\n_lata_ and _nanella_, which I now studied in the offspring of my first\r\nmutants, were clearly discernible in extreme youth, while those of\r\n_rubrinervis_ remained concealed some weeks longer. Hence I concluded\r\nthat the young plants should be examined from time to time until they\r\nproved clearly to be only normal _lamarckiana_. Individuals exhibiting\r\nany deviation from the type, or even giving only a slight indication of\r\nit, were forthwith taken out of the beds and planted separately, under\r\ncircumstances as favorable as possible. They were established in pots\r\nwith well-manured soil and kept under glass, but fully exposed to\r\nsunshine. As a rule they grew very fast, and could be planted out early\r\nin June. Some of them, of course, proved to have been erroneously taken\r\nfor mutants, but many exhibited new characters.\r\n\r\nAll in all I had 334 young plants which did not agree with the parental\r\ntype. As I examined some 14,000 seedlings altogether, the result was\r\nestimated at about 2.5%. This proportion is much larger than in the\r\nyields of the two first generations and illustrates the value of\r\nimproved methods. No doubt many good mutations had been overlooked in\r\nthe earlier observations.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, _lata_ and _nanella_ [552] were repeated in this\r\nthird generation (1895). I was sure to get nearly all of them, without\r\nany important exceptions, as I now knew how to detect them at almost any\r\nage. In fact, I found many of them; as many as 60 _nanella_ and 73\r\n_lata_, or nearly 5% of each. _Rubrinervis_ also recurred, and was seen\r\nin 8 specimens. It was much more rare than the two first-named types.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious fact in that year was the appearance of _oblonga_.\r\nNo doubt I had often seen it in former years, but had not attached any\r\nvalue to the very slight differences from the type, as they then seemed\r\nto me. I knew now that any divergence was to be esteemed as important,\r\nand should be isolated for further observation. This showed that among\r\nthe selected specimens not less than 176, or more than 1% belonged to\r\nthe _oblonga_ type. This type was at that time quite new to me, and it\r\nhad to be kept through the winter, to obtain stems and flowers. It\r\nproved to be as uniform as its three predecessors, and especially as\r\nsharply contrasted with _lamarckiana_. The opportunity for the discovery\r\nof any intermediates was as favorable as could be, because the\r\ndistinguishing marks were hardly beyond doubt at the time of the\r\nselection and removal of the young plants. But no connecting links were\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[553] The same holds good for _albida_, which appeared in 15 specimens,\r\nor in 0.1%, of the whole culture. By careful cultivation these plants\r\nproved not to be sickly, but to belong to a new, though weak type. It\r\nwas evident that I had already seen them in former years, but having\r\nfailed to recognize them had allowed them to be destroyed at an early\r\nage, not knowing how to protect them against adverse circumstances. Even\r\nthis time I did not succeed in getting them strong enough to keep\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\nBesides these, two new types were observed, completing the range of all\r\nthat have since been recorded to regularly occur in this family. They\r\nwere _scintillans_ and _gigas_. The first was obtained in the way just\r\ndescribed. The other hardly escaped being destroyed, not having showed\r\nitself early enough, and being left in the bed after the end of the\r\nselection. But as it was necessary to keep some rosettes through the\r\nwinter in order to have biennial flowering plants to furnish seeds, I\r\nselected in August about 30 of the most vigorous plants, planted them on\r\nanother bed and gave them sufficient room for their stems and branches\r\nin the following summer. Most of them sent up robust shoots, but no\r\ndifference was noted till the first flowers opened. One plant had a much\r\nlarger crown of bright blossoms than any of the others. [554] As soon as\r\nthese flowers faded away, and the young fruits grew out, it became clear\r\nthat a new type was showing itself. On that indication I removed all the\r\nalready fertilized flowers and young fruits, and protected the buds from\r\nthe visits of insects. Thus the isolated flowers were fertilized with\r\ntheir own pollen only, and I could rely upon the purity of the seed\r\nsaved. This lot of seeds was sown in the spring of 1897 and yielded a\r\nuniform crop of nearly 300 young _gigas_ plants.\r\n\r\nHaving found how much depends upon the treatment, I could gradually\r\ndecrease the size of my cultures. Evidently the chance of discovering\r\nnew types would be lessened thereby, but the question as to the repeated\r\nproduction of the same new forms could more easily and more clearly be\r\nanswered in this way. In the following year (1896) I sowed half as many\r\nseeds as formerly, and the result proved quite the same. With the\r\nexception of _gigas_ all the described forms sprang anew from the purely\r\nfertilized ancestry of normal _lamarckiana_s. It was now the fifth\r\ngeneration of my pedigree, and thus I was absolutely sure that the\r\ndescendants of the mutants of this year had been pure and without\r\ndeviation for at least four successive generations.\r\n\r\nOwing partly to improved methods of selection, [555] partly no doubt to\r\nchance, even more mutants were found this year than in the former. Out\r\nof some 8,000 seedlings I counted 377 deviating ones, or nearly 5%,\r\nwhich is a high proportion. Most of them were _oblonga_ and _lata_, the\r\nsame types that had constituted the majority in the former year.\r\n\r\n_Albida_, _nanella_ and _rubrinervis_ appeared in large numbers, and\r\neven _scintillans_, of which I had but a single plant in the previous\r\ngeneration, was repeated sixfold.\r\n\r\nNew forms did not arise, and the capacity of my strain seemed exhausted.\r\nThis conclusion was strengthened by the results of the next three\r\ngenerations, which were made on a much smaller scale and yielded the\r\nsame, or at least the mutants most commonly seen in previous years.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving the figures for these last two years separately, I\r\nwill now summarize my whole experiment in the form of a pedigree. In\r\nthis the normal _lamarckiana_ was the main line, and seeds were only\r\nsown from plants after sufficient isolation either of the plants\r\nthemselves, or in the latter years by means of paper bags enclosing the\r\ninflorescences. I have given the number of seedlings of _lamarckiana_\r\nwhich were examined each year in the table below. Of course by far the\r\nlargest number of them were [556] thrown away as soon as they showed\r\ntheir differentiating characters in order to make room for the remaining\r\nones. At last only a few plants were left to blossom in order to\r\nperpetuate the race. I have indicated for each generation the number of\r\nmutants of each of the observed forms, placing them in vertical columns\r\nunderneath their respective heads. The three first generations were\r\nbiennial, but the five last annual.\r\n\r\n\r\n   PEDIGREE OF A MUTATING FAMILY\r\n   OF _OENOTHERA LAMARCKIANA_ IN THE\r\n   EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN AT AMSTERDAM\r\n\r\n   Gener: O.gig. albida obl. rubrin.

There is no chaos of forms, no\r\nindefinite varying in all degrees and in all directions. Quite on the\r\ncontrary, it is at once evident that very simple rules govern the whole\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nI shall now attempt to deduce these laws from [557] my experiment.\r\nObviously they apply not only to our evening-primroses, but may be\r\nexpected to be of general validity. This is at once manifest, if we\r\ncompare the group of new mutants with the swarms of elementary forms\r\nwhich compose some of the youngest systematic species, and which, as we\r\nhave seen before, are to be considered as the results of previous\r\nmutations. The difference lies in the fact that the evening-primroses\r\nhave been seen to spring from their ancestors and that the _drabas_ have\r\nnot. Hence the conclusion that in comparing the two we must leave out\r\nthe pedigree of the evening-primroses and consider only the group of\r\nforms as they finally show themselves. If in doing so we find sufficient\r\nsimilarity, we are justified in the conclusion that the _drabas_ and\r\nothers have probably originated in the same way as the\r\nevening-primroses. Minor points of course will differ, but the main\r\nlines cannot have complied with wholly different laws. All so-called\r\nswarms of elementary species obviously pertain to a single type, and\r\nthis type includes our evening-primroses as the only controlled case.\r\n\r\nFormulating the laws of mutability for the evening-primroses we\r\ntherefore assume that they hold good for numerous other corresponding\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[558]  I. The first law is, that new elementary species appear suddenly,\r\nwithout intermediate steps.\r\n\r\nThis is a striking point, and the one that is in the most immediate\r\ncontradiction to current scientific belief. The ordinary conception\r\nassumes very slow changes, in fact so slow that centuries are supposed\r\nto be required to make the differences appreciable. If this were true,\r\nall chance of ever seeing a new species arise would be hopelessly small.\r\nFortunately the evening-primroses exhibit contrary tendencies. One of\r\nthe great points of pedigree-culture is the fact that the ancestors of\r\nevery mutant have been controlled and recorded. Those of the last year\r\nhave seven generations of known _lamarckiana_ parents preceding them. If\r\nthere had been any visible preparation towards the coming mutation, it\r\ncould not have escaped observation. Moreover, if visible preparation\r\nwere the rule, it could hardly go on at the same time and in the same\r\nindividuals in five or six diverging directions, producing from one\r\nparent, _gigas_ and _nanella_, _lata_ and _rubrinervis_, _oblonga_ and\r\n_albida_ and even _scintillans_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the mutants, that constitute the first representatives\r\nof their race, exhibit all the attributes of the new type in full\r\ndisplay at once. No series of generations, no selection, [559] no\r\nstruggle for existence are needed to reach this end. In previous\r\nlectures I have mentioned that I have saved the seeds of the mutants\r\nwhenever possible, and have always obtained repetitions of the prototype\r\nonly. Reversions are as absolutely lacking as is also a further\r\ndevelopment of the new type. Even in the case of the inconstant forms,\r\nwhere part of the progeny yearly return to the stature of _lamarckiana_,\r\nintermediates are not found. So it is also with _lata_, which is\r\npistillate and can only be propagated by cross-fertilization. But though\r\nthe current belief would expect intermediates at least in this case,\r\nthey do not occur. I made a pedigree-culture of lata during eight\r\nsuccessive generations, pollinating them in different ways, and always\r\nobtained cultures which were partly constituted of _lata_ and partly of\r\n_lamarckiana_ specimens. But the _lata_s remained _lata_ in all the\r\nvarious and most noticeable characters, never showing any tendency to\r\ngradually revert into the original form.\r\n\r\nIntermediate forms, if not occurring in the direct line from one species\r\nto another, might be expected to appear perhaps on lateral branches. In\r\nthis case the mutants of one type, appearing in the same year, would not\r\nbe a pure type, but would exhibit different degrees of deviation from\r\nthe parent. The best would then have to [560] be chosen in order to get\r\nthe new type in its pure condition. Nothing of the kind, however, was\r\nobserved. All the _oblonga_-mutants were pure _oblongas_. The pedigree\r\nshows hundreds of them in the succeeding years, but no difference was\r\nseen and no material for selection was afforded. All were as nearly\r\nequal as the individuals of old elementary species.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. New forms spring laterally from the main stem.\r\n\r\nThe current conception concerning the origin of species assumes that\r\nspecies are slowly converted into others. The conversion is assumed to\r\naffect all the individuals in the same direction and in the same degree.\r\nThe whole group changes its character, acquiring new attributes. By\r\ninter-crossing they maintain a common line of progress, one individual\r\nnever being able to proceed much ahead of the others.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the new species necessarily seemed to involve the death of\r\nthe old one. This last conclusion, however, is hard to understand. It\r\nmay be justifiable to assume that all the individuals of one locality\r\nare ordinarily intercrossed, and are moreover subjected to the same\r\nexternal conditions. They might be supposed to vary in the same\r\ndirection if these conditions were changed slowly. But this could of\r\ncourse have no possible influence on the plants of the [561] same\r\nspecies growing in distant localities, and it would be improbable they\r\nshould be affected in the same way. Hence we should conclude that when a\r\nspecies is converted into a new type in one locality this is only to be\r\nconsidered as one of numerous possible ones, and its alteration would\r\nnot in the least change the aspect of the remainder of the species.\r\n\r\nBut even with this restriction the general belief is not supported by\r\nthe evidence of the evening-primroses. There is neither a slow nor a\r\nsudden change of all the individuals. On the contrary, the vast majority\r\nremain unchanged; thousands are seen exactly repeating the original\r\nprototype yearly, both in the native field and in my garden. There is no\r\ndanger that _lamarckiana_ might die out from the act of mutating, nor\r\nthat the mutating strain itself would be exposed to ultimate destruction\r\nfrom this cause.\r\n\r\nIn older swarms, such as _Draba_ or _Helianthemum_, no such center,\r\naround which the various forms are grouped, is known. Are we to conclude\r\ntherefore that the main strain has died out? Or is it perhaps concealed\r\namong the throng, being distinguished by no peculiar character? If our\r\n_gigas_ and _rubrinervis_ were growing in equal numbers with the\r\n_lamarckiana_ in the native field, would it be possible to decide [562]\r\nwhich of them was the progenitor of the others? Of course this could be\r\ndone by long and tedious crossing experiments, showing atavism in the\r\nprogeny, and thereby indicating the common ancestor. But even this\r\ncapacity seems to be doubtful and connected only with the state of\r\nmutability and to be lost afterwards. Therefore if this period of\r\nmutation were ended, probably there would be no way to decide concerning\r\nthe mutual relationship of the single species.\r\n\r\nHence the lack of a recognizable main stem in swarms of elementary\r\nspecies makes it impossible to answer the question concerning their\r\ncommon origin.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the opposition between the prevailing view and my own\r\nresults seems far more important. According to the current belief the\r\nconversion of a group of plants growing in any locality and flowering\r\nsimultaneously would be restricted to one type. In my own experiments\r\nseveral new species arose from the parental form at once, giving a wide\r\nrange of new forms at the same time and under the same conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. New elementary species attain their full constancy at once.\r\n\r\nConstancy is not the result of selection or of improvement. It is a\r\nquality of its own. It can neither be constrained by selection if it is\r\nabsent [563] from the beginning, nor does it need any natural or\r\nartificial aid if it is present. Most of my new species have proved\r\nconstant from the first. Whenever possible, the original mutants have\r\nbeen isolated during the flowering period and artificially\r\nself-fertilized. Such plants have always given a uniform progeny, all\r\nchildren exhibiting the type of the parent. No atavism was observed and\r\ntherefore no selection was needed or even practicable.\r\n\r\nBriefly considering the different forms, we may state that the full\r\nexperimental proof has been given for the origin of _gigas_ and\r\n_rubrinervis_, for _albida_ and _oblonga_, and even for _nanella_, which\r\nis to be considered as of a varietal nature; with _lata_ the decisive\r\nexperiment is excluded by its unisexuality. _laevifolia_ and\r\n_brevistylis_ were found originally in the field, and never appeared in\r\nmy cultures. No observations were made as to their origin, and seeds\r\nhave only been sown from later generations. But these have yielded\r\nuniform crops, thereby showing that there is no ground for the\r\nassumption that these two older varieties might behave otherwise than\r\nthe more recent derivatives.\r\n\r\n_Scintillans_ and _elliptica_ constitute exceptions to the rule given.\r\nThey repeat their character, from pure seed, only in part of the\r\noffspring. I have tried to deliver the _scintillans_ from this [564]\r\nincompleteness of heredity, but in vain. The succeeding generations, if\r\nproduced from true representatives of the new type, and with pure\r\nfertilization, have repeated the splitting in the same numerical\r\nproportions. The instability seems to be here as permanent a quality as\r\nthe stability in other instances. Even here no selection has been\r\nadequate to change the original form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Some of the new strains are evidently elementary species, while\r\nothers are to be considered as retrograde varieties.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to decide whether a given form belongs to one or\r\nanother of these two groups. I have tried to show that the best and\r\nstrictest conception of varieties limits them to those forms that have\r\nprobably originated by retrograde or degressive steps. Elementary\r\nspecies are assumed to have been produced in a progressive way, adding\r\none new element to the store. Varieties differ from their species\r\nclearly in one point, and this is either a distinct loss, or the\r\nassumption of a character, which may be met with in other species and\r\ngenera. _laevifolia_ is distinguished by the loss of the crinkling of\r\nthe leaves, _brevistylis_ by the partial loss of the epigynous qualities\r\nof the flowers, and _nanella_ is a dwarf. These three new forms are\r\ntherefore [565] considered to constitute only retrograde steps, and no\r\nadvance. This conclusion has been fully justified by some crossing\r\nexperiments with _brevistylis_, which wholly complies with Mendel's law,\r\nand in one instance with _nanella_, which behaves in the same manner, if\r\ncrossed with _rubrinervis_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, _gigas_ and _rubrinervis_, _oblonga_ and _albida_\r\nobviously bear the characters of progressive elementary species. They\r\nare not differentiated from _lamarckiana_ by one or two main features.\r\nThey diverge from it in nearly all organs, and in all in a definite\r\nthough small degree. They may be recognized as soon as they have\r\ndeveloped their first leaves and remain discernible throughout life.\r\nTheir characters refer chiefly to the foliage, but no less to the\r\nstature, and even the seeds have peculiarities. There can be little\r\ndoubt but that all the attributes of every new species are derived from\r\none principal change. But why this should affect the foliage in one\r\nmanner, the flowers in another and the fruits in a third direction,\r\nremains obscure. To gain ever so little an insight into the nature of\r\nthese changes, we may best compare the differences of our\r\nevening-primroses with those between the two hundred elementary species\r\nof _Draba_ and other similar instances. In doing so we find the same\r\nmain [566] feature, the minute differences in nearly all points.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The same new species are produced in a large number of individuals.\r\n\r\nThis is a very curious fact. It embraces two minor points, viz: the\r\nmultitude of similar mutants in the same year, and the repetition\r\nthereof in succeeding generations. Obviously there must be some common\r\ncause. This cause must be assumed to lie dormant in the _Lamarckiana_s\r\nof my strain, and probably in all of them, as no single parent-plant\r\nproved ever to be wholly destitute of mutability. Furthermore the\r\ndifferent causes for the sundry mutations must lie latent together in\r\nthe same parent-plant. They obey the same general laws, become active\r\nunder similar conditions, some of them being more easily awakened than\r\nothers. The germs of the _oblonga_, _lata_ and _nanella_ are especially\r\nirritable, and are ready to spring into activity at the least summons,\r\nwhile those of _gigas_, _rubrinervis_ and _scintillans_ are far more\r\ndifficult to arouse.\r\n\r\nThese germs must be assumed to lie dormant during many successive\r\ngenerations. This is especially evident in the case of _lata_ and\r\n_nanella__, which appeared in the first year of the pedigree culture and\r\nwhich since have been repeated yearly, and have been seen to arise by\r\nmutation [567] also during the last season (1903). Only _gigas_ appeared\r\nbut once, but then there is every reason to assume that in larger\r\nsowings or by a prolongation of the experiments it might have made a\r\nsecond appearance.\r\n\r\nIs the number of such germs to be supposed to be limited or unlimited?\r\nMy experiment has produced about a dozen new forms. Without doubt I\r\ncould easily have succeeded in getting more, if I had had any definite\r\nreason to search for them. But such figures are far from favoring the\r\nassumption of indefinite mutability. The group of possible new forms is\r\nno doubt sharply circumscribed. Partly so by the morphologic\r\npeculiarities of _lamarckiana_, which seem to exclude red flowers,\r\ncomposite leaves, etc. No doubt there are more direct reasons for these\r\nlimits, some changes having taken place initially and others later,\r\nwhile the present mutations are only repetitions of previous ones, and\r\ndo not contribute new lines of development to those already existing.\r\nThis leads us to the supposition of some common original cause, which\r\nproduced a number of changes, but which itself is no longer at work, but\r\nhas left the affected qualities, and only these, in the state of\r\nmutability.\r\n\r\nIn nature, repeated mutations must be of far greater significance than\r\nisolated ones. How [568] great is the chance for a single individual to\r\nbe destroyed in the struggle for life? Hundreds of thousands of seeds\r\nare produced by _lamarckiana_ annually in the field, and only some slow\r\nincrease of the number of specimens can be observed. Many seeds do not\r\nfind the proper circumstances for germination, or the young seedlings\r\nare destroyed by lack of water, of air, or of space. Thousands of them\r\nare so crowded when becoming rosettes that only a few succeed in\r\nproducing stems. Any weakness would have destroyed them. As a matter of\r\nfact they are much oftener produced in the seed than seen in the field\r\nwith the usual unfavorable conditions; the careful sowing of collected\r\nseeds has given proof of this fact many times.\r\n\r\nThe experimental proof of this frequency in the origin of new types,\r\nseems to overcome many difficulties offered by the current theories on\r\nthe probable origin of species at large.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The relation between mutability and fluctuating variability has\r\nalways been one of the chief difficulties of the followers of Darwin.\r\nThe majority assumed that species arise by the slow accumulation of\r\nslight fluctuating deviations, and the mutations were only to be\r\nconsidered as extreme fluctuations, obtained, in the main, by a\r\ncontinuous selection of small differences in a constant direction.\r\n\r\n[569] My cultures show that quite the opposite is to be regarded as\r\nfact. All organs and all qualities of _lamarckiana_ fluctuate and vary\r\nin a more or less evident manner, and those which I had the opportunity\r\nof examining more closely were found to comply with the general laws of\r\nfluctuation. But such oscillating changes have nothing in common with\r\nthe mutations. Their essential character is the heaping up of slight\r\ndeviations around a mean, and the occurrence of continuous lines of\r\nincreasing deviations, linking the extremes with this group. Nothing of\r\nthe kind is observed in the case of mutations. There is no mean for them\r\nto be grouped around and the extreme only is to be seen, and it is\r\nwholly unconnected with the original type. It might be supposed that on\r\ncloser inspection each mutation might be brought into connection with\r\nsome feature of the fluctuating variability. But this is not the case.\r\nThe dwarfs are not at all the extreme variants of structure, as the\r\nfluctuation of the height of the _lamarckiana_ never decreases or even\r\napproaches that of the dwarfs. There is always a gap. The smallest\r\nspecimens of the tall type are commonly the weakest, according to the\r\ngeneral rule of the relationship between nourishment and variation, but\r\nthe tallest dwarfs are of course the most robust specimens of their\r\ngroup. [570] Fluctuating variability, as a rule, is subject to\r\nreversion. The seeds of the extremes do not produce an offspring which\r\nfluctuates around their parents as a center, but around some point on\r\nthe line which combines their attributes with the corresponding\r\ncharacteristic of their ancestors, as Vilmorin has put it. No reversion\r\naccompanies mutation, and this fact is perhaps the completest contrast\r\nin which these two great types of variability are opposed to each other.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of my mutants are, of course, subject to the general laws\r\nof fluctuating variability. They vary, however, around their own mean,\r\nand this mean is simply the type of the new elementary species.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. The mutations take place in nearly all directions.\r\n\r\nMany authors assume that the origin of species is directed by unknown\r\ncauses. These causes are assumed to work in each single case for the\r\nimprovement of the animals and plants, changing them in a manner\r\ncorresponding in a useful way to the changes that take place in their\r\nenvironment. It is not easy to imagine the nature of these influences\r\nnor how they would bring about the desired effect.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty was strongly felt by Darwin, and one of the chief\r\npurposes of his selection theory may be said to have been the attempt\r\n[571] to surmount it. Darwin tried to replace the unknown cause by\r\nnatural agencies, which lie under our immediate observation. On this\r\npoint Darwin was superior to his predecessors, and it is chiefly due to\r\nthe clear conception of this point that his theory has gained its\r\ndeserved general acceptance. According to Darwin, changes occur in all\r\ndirections, quite independently of the prevailing circumstances. Some\r\nmay be favorable, others detrimental, many of them without significance,\r\nneither useful nor injurious. Some of them will sooner or later be\r\ndestroyed, while others will survive, but which of them will survive, is\r\nobviously dependent upon whether their particular changes agree with the\r\nexisting environic conditions or not. This is what Darwin has called the\r\nstruggle for life. It is a large sieve, and it only acts as such. Some\r\nfall through and are annihilated, others remain above and are selected,\r\nas the phrase goes. Many are selected, but more are destroyed; daily\r\nobservation does not leave any doubt upon this point.\r\n\r\nHow the differences originate is quite another question. It has nothing\r\nto do with the theory of natural selection nor with the struggle for\r\nlife. These have an active part only in the accumulation of useful\r\nqualities, and only in so [572] far as they protect the bearers of such\r\ncharacters against being crowded out by their more poorly constituted\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nHowever, the differentiating characteristics of elementary species are\r\nonly very small. How widely distant they are from the beautiful\r\nadaptative organizations of orchids, of insectivorous plants and of so\r\nmany others! Here the difference lies in the accumulation of numerous\r\nelementary characters, which all contribute to the same end. Chance must\r\nhave produced them, and this would seem absolutely improbable, even\r\nimpossible, were it not for Darwin's ingenious theory. Chance there is,\r\nbut no more than anywhere else. It is not by mere chance that the\r\nvariations move in the required direction. They do go, according to\r\nDarwin's view, in all directions, or at least in many. If these include\r\nthe useful ones, and if this is repeated a number of times, cumulation\r\nis possible; if not, there is simply no progression, and the type\r\nremains stable through the ages. Natural selection is continually acting\r\nas a sieve, throwing out the useless changes and retaining the real\r\nimprovements. Hence the accumulation in apparently predisposed\r\ndirections, and hence the increasing adaptations to the more specialized\r\nconditions of life. It must be obvious to any one who can free himself\r\nfrom the current ideas, [573] that this theory of natural selection\r\nleaves the question as to how the changes themselves are brought about,\r\nquite undecided. There are two possibilities, and both have been\r\npropounded by Darwin. One is the accumulation of the slight deviations\r\nof fluctuating variability, the other consists of successive sports or\r\nleaps taking place in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn further lectures a critical comparison of the two views will be\r\ngiven. Today I have only to show that the mutations of the\r\nevening-primroses, though sudden, comply with the demands made by Darwin\r\nas to the form of variability which is to be accepted as the cause of\r\nevolution and as the origin of species.\r\n\r\nSome of my new types are stouter and others weaker than their parents,\r\nas shown by _gigas_ and _albida_. Some have broader leaves and some\r\nnarrower, _lata_ and _oblonga_. Some have larger flowers (_gigas_) or\r\ndeeper yellow ones (_rubrinervis_), or smaller blossoms (_scintillans_),\r\nor of a paler hue (_albida_). In some the capsules are longer\r\n(_rubrinervis_), or thicker (_gigas_), or more rounded (_lata_), or\r\nsmall (_oblonga_), and nearly destitute of seeds (_brevistylis_). The\r\nunevenness of the surface of the leaves may increase as in _lata_, or\r\ndecrease as in _laevifolia_. The tendency to become annual prevails in\r\n_rubrinervis_, but _gigas_ tends to become [574] biennial. Some are rich\r\nin pollen, while _scintillans_ is poor. Some have large seeds, others\r\nsmall. _Lata_ has become pistillate, while _brevistylis_ has nearly lost\r\nthe faculty to produce seeds. Some undescribed forms were quite sterile,\r\nand some I observed which produced no flowers at all. From this\r\nstatement it may be seen that nearly all qualities vary in opposite\r\ndirections and that our group of mutants affords wide material for the\r\nsifting process of natural selection. On the original field the\r\n_laevifolia_ and _brevistylis_ have held their own during sixteen years\r\nand probably more, without, however, being able to increase their\r\nnumbers to any noticeable extent. Others perish as soon as they make\r\ntheir appearance, or a few individuals are allowed to bloom, but\r\nprobably leave no progeny.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the circumstances may change, or the whole strain may be\r\ndispersed and spread to new localities with different conditions. Some\r\nof the latter might be found to be favorable to the robust _gigas_, or\r\nto _rubrinervis_, which requires a drier air, with rainfall in the\r\nspringtime and sunshine during the summer. It would be worth while to\r\nsee whether the climate of California, where neither _O. lamarckiana_\r\nnor _O. biennis_ are found wild, would not exactly [575] suit the\r\nrequirements of the new species _rubrinervis_ and _gigas_.\r\n\r\nNOTE. _Oenothera_s are native to America and all of the species growing\r\nin Europe have escaped from gardens directly, or may have arisen by\r\nmutation, or by hybridization of introduced species. A fixed hybrid\r\nbetween _O. cruciata_ and _O. biennis_ constituting a species has been\r\nin cultivation for many years. The form known as _O. biennis_ in Europe,\r\nand used by de Vries in all of the experiments described in these\r\nlectures, has not yet been found growing wild in America and is not\r\nidentical with the species bearing that name among American botanists.\r\nConcerning this matter Professor de Vries writes under date of Sept. 12,\r\n1905: \"The '_biennis_' which I collected in America has proved to be a\r\nmotley collection of forms, which at that time I had no means of\r\ndistinguishing. No one of them, so far as they are now growing in my\r\ngarden is identical with our _biennis_ of the sand dunes.\" The same\r\nappears to be the case with _O. muricata_. Plants from the Northeastern\r\nAmerican seaboard, identifiable with the species do not entirely agree\r\nwith those raised from seed received from Holland.\r\n\r\n_O. lamarckiana_ has not been found growing wild in America in recent\r\nyears although the evidence at hand seems to favor the conclusion that\r\nit was seen and collected in the southern states in the last century.\r\n(See MacDougal, Vail, Shull, and Small: Mutants and Hybrids of the\r\n_Oenotheras_.

EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[576]\r\nLECTURE XX\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF WILD SPECIES AND VARIETIES\r\n\r\nNew species and varieties occur from time to time in the wild state.\r\nSetting aside all theoretical conceptions as to the common origin of\r\nspecies at large, the undoubted fact remains that new forms are\r\nsometimes met with. In the case of the peloric toad-flax the mutations\r\nare so numerous that they seem to be quite regular. The production of\r\nnew species of evening-primroses was observed on the field and\r\nafterwards duplicated in the garden. There is no reason to think that\r\nthese cases are isolated instances. Quite on the contrary they seem to\r\nbe the prototypes of repeated occurrences in nature.\r\n\r\nIf this conception is granted, the question at once arises, how are we\r\nto deal with analogous cases, when fortune offers them, and what can we\r\nexpect to learn from them?\r\n\r\nA critical study of the existing evidence seems to be of great\r\nimportance in order to ascertain the best way of dealing with new facts,\r\nand of estimating the value of the factors concerned. [577] It is\r\nmanifest that we must be very careful and conservative in dealing with\r\nnew facts that are brought to our attention, and every effort should be\r\nmade to bring additional evidence to light. Many vegetable anomalies are\r\nso rare that they are met with only by the purest chance, and are then\r\nbelieved to be wholly new. When a white variety of some common plant is\r\nmet with for the first time we generally assume that it originated on\r\nthat very spot and only a short time previously. The discovery of a\r\nsecond locality for the same variety at once raises the question as to a\r\ncommon origin in the two instances. Could not the plants of the second\r\nlocality have arisen from seeds transported from the first?\r\n\r\nWhite varieties of many species of blue-bells and gentians are found not\r\nrarely, white-flowering plants of heather, both of _Erica Tetralix_ and\r\n_Calluna vulgaris_ occur on European heaths; white flowers of _Brunella\r\nvulgaris_, _Ononis repens_, _Thymus vulgaris_ and others may be seen in\r\nmany localities in the habitats of the colored species. Pelories of\r\nlabiates seem to occur often in Austria, but are rare in Holland; white\r\nbilberries (_Vaccinium Myrtillus_) have many known localities throughout\r\nEurope, and nearly all the berry-bearing species in the large heath\r\nfamily are recorded as having white varieties.\r\n\r\n[578] Are we to assume a single origin for all the representatives of\r\nsuch a variety, as we have done customarily for all the representatives\r\nof a wild species? Or can the same mutation have been repeated at\r\ndifferent times and in distant localities? If a distinct mutation from a\r\ngiven species is once possible, why should it not occur twice or thrice?\r\n\r\nA variety which seems to be new to us may only appear so, because the\r\nspot where it grows had hitherto escaped observation. _Lychnis preslii_\r\nis a smooth variety of _Lychnis diurna_ and was observed for the first\r\ntime in the year 1842 by Sekera. It grew abundantly in a grove near\r\nMunchengratz in southern Hungary. It was accompanied by the ordinary\r\nhairy type of the species. Since then it has been observed to be quite\r\nconstant in the same locality, and some specimens have been collected\r\nfor me there lately by Dr. Nemec, of Prague. No other native localities\r\nof this variety have been discovered, and there can be no doubt that it\r\nmust have arisen from the ordinary campion near the spot where it still\r\ngrows. But this change may have taken place some years before the first\r\ndiscovery, or perhaps one or more centuries ago. This could only be\r\nknown if it could be proved that the locality had been satisfactorily\r\ninvestigated previously, and that the variety had not [579] been met\r\nwith. Even in this case only something would be discovered about the\r\ntime of the change, but nothing about its real nature.\r\n\r\nSo it is in many cases. If a variety is observed in a number of\r\nspecimens at the time of its first discovery, and at a locality not\r\nstudied previously, it takes the aspect of an old form of limited\r\ndistribution, and little can be learned as to the circumstances under\r\nwhich it arose. If on the contrary it occurs in very small numbers or\r\nperhaps even in a single individual, and if the spot where it is found\r\nis located so that it could hardly have escaped previous observation,\r\nthen the presumption of a recent origin seems justified.\r\n\r\nWhat has to be ascertained on such occasions to give them scientific\r\nvalue? Three points strike me as being of the highest importance. First,\r\nthe constancy of the new type; secondly, the occurrence or lack of\r\nintermediates, and last, but not least, the direct observation of a\r\nrepeated production.\r\n\r\nThe first two points are easily ascertained. Whether the new type is\r\nlinked with its more common supposed ancestor by intermediate steps is a\r\nquery which at once strikes the botanist. It is usually recorded in such\r\ncases, and we may state at once that the general result is, that such\r\nintermediates do not occur. This is [580] of the highest importance and\r\nadmits of only two explanations. One is that intermediates may be\r\nassumed to have preceded the existent developed form, and to have died\r\nout afterwards. But why should they have done so, especially in cases of\r\nrecent changes? On the other hand the intermediates may be lacking\r\nbecause they have never existed, the change having taken place by a\r\nsudden leap, such as the mutations described in our former lectures. It\r\nis manifest that the assumption of hypothetical intermediates could only\r\ngain some probability if they had been found in some instance. Since\r\nthey do not occur, the hypothesis seems wholly unsupported.\r\n\r\nThe second point is the constancy of the new type. Seeds should be saved\r\nand sown. If the plant fertilizes itself without the aid of insects, as\r\ndo some evening-primroses, the seed saved from the native locality may\r\nprove wholly pure, and if it does give rise to a uniform progeny the\r\nconstancy of the race may be assumed to be proved, provided that\r\nrepeated trials do not bring to light any exceptions. If the offspring\r\nshows more than one type, cross-fertilization is always to be looked to\r\nas the most probable cause, and should be excluded, in order to sow pure\r\nseeds. Garden-experiments of this kind, and repeated trials, should\r\nalways be combined [581] with the discovery of a presumed mutation. In\r\nmany instances the authors have realized the importance of this point,\r\nand new types have been found constant from the very beginning. Many\r\ncases are known which show no reversions and even no partial reversions.\r\nThis fact throws a distinct light on our first point, as it makes the\r\nhypothesis of a slow and gradual development still more improbable.\r\n\r\nMy third point is of quite another nature and has not as yet been dealt\r\nwith. But as it appeals to me as the very soul of the problem, it seems\r\nnecessary to describe it in some detail. It does not refer to the new\r\ntype itself, nor to any of its morphologic or hereditary attributes, but\r\ndirectly concerns the presumed ancestors themselves.\r\n\r\nThe peloric toad-flax in my experiment was seen to arise thrice from the\r\nsame strain. Three different individuals of my original race showed a\r\ntendency to produce peloric mutations, and they did so in a number of\r\ntheir seeds, exactly as the mutations of the evening-primroses were\r\nrepeated nearly every year. Hence the inference, that whenever we find a\r\nnovelty which is really of very recent date, the parent-strain which has\r\nproduced it might still be in existence on the same spot. In the case of\r\nshrubs or perennials the very parents might yet be found. [582] But it\r\nseems probable, and is especially proved in the case of the\r\nevening-primroses, that all or the majority of the representatives of\r\nthe whole strain have the same tendency to mutate. If this were a\r\ngeneral rule, it would suffice to take some pure seeds from specimens of\r\nthe presumed parents and to sow and multiply the individuals to such an\r\nextent that the mutation might have a chance to be repeated.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this has not as yet been done, but in my opinion it\r\nshould be the first effort of any one who has the good luck to discover\r\na new wild mutation. Specimens of the parents should be transplanted\r\ninto a garden and fertilized under isolated conditions. Seeds saved from\r\nthe wild plant would have little worth, as they might have been partly\r\nfertilized by the new type itself.\r\n\r\nAfter this somewhat lengthy discussion of the value of observations\r\nsurrounding the discovery of new wild mutations, we now come to the\r\ndescription of some of the more interesting cases. As a first example, I\r\nwill take the globular fruited shepherd's purse, described by Solms\r\nLaubach as _Capsella heegeri_. Professor Heeger discovered one plant\r\nwith deviating fruits, in a group of common shepherd's purses in the\r\nmarket-place near Landau in Germany, in the fall of 1897. They were\r\nnearly spherical, [583] instead of flat and purse-shaped. Their valves\r\nwere thick and fleshy, while those of the ordinary form are\r\nmembranaceous and dry. The capsules hardly opened and therefore differed\r\nin this point from the shepherd's purse, which readily loosens both its\r\nvalves as soon as it is ripe.\r\n\r\nOnly one plant was observed; whence it came could not be determined, nor\r\nwhether it had arisen from the neighboring stock of C_apsella_ or not.\r\nThe discoverer took some seed to his garden and sent some to the\r\nbotanical garden at Strassburg, of which Solms-Laubach is the director.\r\nThe majority of the seeds of course were sowed naturally on the original\r\nspot. The following year some of the seeds germinated and repeated the\r\nnovelty. The leaves, stems and flowers were those of the common\r\nshepherd's purse, but no decision could be reached concerning the type\r\nof this generation before the first flowers had faded and the rounded\r\ncapsules had developed. Then it was seen that the _heegeri_ came true\r\nfrom seed. It did so both in the gardens and on the market-place, where\r\nit was observed to have multiplied and spread in some small measure. The\r\nsame was noted the following year, but then the place was covered with\r\ngravel and all the plants destroyed. It is not recorded to have been\r\nseen wild since.\r\n\r\n[584] Intermediate forms have not been met with. Some slight reversions\r\nmay occur in the autumn on the smallest and weakest lateral branches.\r\nSuch reversions, however, seem to be very rare, as I have tried in vain\r\nto produce them on large and richly branched individuals, by applying\r\nall possible inducements in the form of manure and of cutting, to\r\nstimulate the production of successive generations of weaker side\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThis constancy was proved by the experiments of Solms-Laubach, which I\r\nhave repeated in my own garden during several years with seed received\r\nfrom him. No atavists or deviating specimens have been found among many\r\nhundreds of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that within the family of the crucifers the form\r\nof the capsule and the attributes of the valves and seeds are usually\r\nconsidered to furnish the characteristics of genera, and this point has\r\nbeen elucidated at some length by Solms-Laubach. There is, however, no\r\nsufficient reason to construe a new genus on the ground of Heeger's\r\nglobular fruited shepherd's purse; but as a true elementary species, and\r\neven as a good systematic species it has proved itself, and as such it\r\nis described by Solms-Laubach, who named it in honor of its discoverer.\r\n\r\nExactly analogous discoveries have been [586] instead of displaying a\r\nbright yellow cup. _O. cruciata_ grows in the Adirondack Mountains, in\r\nthe states of New York and Vermont, and seems to be abundant there. It\r\nhas been introduced into botanical gardens and yielded a number of\r\nhybrids, especially with _O. biennis and _O. lamarckiana_, and the\r\nnarrow petals of the parent-species may be met with in combination with\r\nthe stature and vegetative characteristics of these last named species.\r\n_O. cruciata_ has a purple foliage, while _biennis_ and _lamarckiana_\r\nare green, and many of the hybrids may instantly be recognized by their\r\npurple color.\r\n\r\nThe curious attribute of the petals is not to be considered simply as a\r\nreduction in size. On anatomical inquiry it has been found that these\r\nnarrow petals bear some characteristics which, on the normal plants, are\r\nlimited to the calyx. Stomata and hairs, and the whole structure of the\r\nsurface and inner tissues on some parts of these petals are exactly\r\nsimilar to those of the calyx, while on others they have retained the\r\ncharacteristics of petals. Sometimes there may even be seen by the naked\r\neye green longitudinal stripes of calyx-like structure alternating with\r\nbright yellow petaloid parts. For these reasons the cruciata character\r\nmay be considered as a case of sepalody of the petals, or of the petals\r\nbeing partly converted into sepals.\r\n\r\n[587] It is worth while to note that as a monstrosity this occurrence is\r\nextremely rare throughout the whole vegetable kingdom, and only very few\r\ninstances have been recorded.\r\n\r\nTwo cases of sudden mutations have come to my knowledge, producing this\r\nsame anomaly in allied species. One has been already alluded to; it\r\npertains to the common evening-primrose or _Oenothera biennis_, and one\r\nis a species belonging to another genus of the same family, the great\r\nhairy willow-herb or _Epilobium _hirsutum_. I propose to designate both\r\nnew forms by the varietal name of _cruciata_, or _cruciatum_.\r\n\r\n_Oenothera biennis cruciata_ was found in a native locality of the _O.\r\nbiennis itself. It consisted of only one plant, showing in all its\r\nflowers the _cruciata_ marks. In all other respects it resembled wholly\r\nthe _biennis_, especially in the pure green color of its foliage, which\r\nat once excluded all suspicion of hybrid origin with the purple _O.\r\ncruciata_. Moreover in our country this last occurs only in the\r\ncultivated state in botanical gardens.\r\n\r\nIntermediates were not seen, and as the plant bore some pods, it was\r\npossible to test its constancy. I raised about 500 plants from its\r\nseeds, out of which more than 100 flowered in the first year. The others\r\nwere partly kept through the winter and flowered next year. Seeds saved\r\nin [588] both seasons were sown on a large scale. Both the first and the\r\nsucceeding generations of the offspring of the original plant came true\r\nwithout any exception. Intermediates are often found in hybrid cultures,\r\nand in them the character is a very variable one, but as yet they were\r\nnot met with in progeny of this mutant. All these plants were exactly\r\nlike _O. biennis_, with the single exception of their petals.\r\n\r\n_Epilobium hirsutum cruciatum_ was discovered by John Rasor near\r\nWoolpit, Bury St. Edmunds, in England. It flowered in one spot,\r\nproducing about a dozen stems, among large quantities of the\r\nparent-species, which is very common there, as it is elsewhere in\r\nEurope. This species is a perennial, multiplying itself by underground\r\nrunners, and the stems of the new variety were observed to stand so\r\nclose to each other that they might be considered as the shoots of one\r\nindividual. In this case this specimen might probably be the original\r\nmutant, as the variety had not been seen on that spot in previous years,\r\neven as it has not been found elsewhere in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIntermediates were not observed, though the difference is a very\r\nstriking one. In the cruciate flowers the broad and bright purple petals\r\nseem at first sight to be wholly wanting. They are too weak to expand\r\nand to reflex the calyx [589] as in the normal flowers of the species.\r\nThe sepals adhere to one another, and are only opened at their summit by\r\nthe protruding pistils. Even the stamens hardly come to light. At the\r\nperiod of full bloom the flowers convey only the idea of closed buds\r\ncrowned by the conspicuous white cross of the stigma. Any intermediate\r\nform would have at once betrayed itself by larger colored petals, coming\r\nout of the calyx-sheath. The cruciate petals are small and linear and\r\ngreenish, recalling thereby the color of the sepals.\r\n\r\nMr. Rasor having sent me some flowers and some ripe capsules of his\r\nnovelty, I sowed the latter in my experimental garden, where the plant\r\nflowered in large numbers and with many thousands of flowers both in\r\n1902 and 1903. All of these plants and all of these flowers repeated the\r\ncruciate type exactly, and not the slightest impurity or tendency to\r\npartial reversion has been observed.\r\n\r\nThus true and constant cruciate varieties have been produced from\r\naccidentally observed initial plants, and because of their very curious\r\ncharacters they will no doubt be kept in botanical gardens, even if they\r\nshould eventually become lost in their native localities.\r\n\r\nAt this point I might note another observation made on the wild species\r\nof _Oenothera cruciata_ [590] from the Adirondacks. Through the kindness\r\nof Dr. MacDougal, of the New York Botanical Garden, I received seeds\r\nfrom Sandy Hill near Lake George. When the plants, grown from these\r\nseeds, flowered, they were not a uniform lot, but exhibited two distinct\r\ntypes. Some had linear petals and thin flower-buds, and in others the\r\npetals were a little broader and the buds more swollen. The difference\r\nwas small, but constant on all the flowers, each single plant clearly\r\nbelonging to one or the other of the two types. Probably two elementary\r\nspecies were intermixed here, but whether one is the systematic type and\r\nthe other a mutation, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nNor seem these two types to exhaust the range of variability of\r\n_Oenothera cruciata_. Dr. B.L. Robinson of Cambridge, Mass., had the\r\nkindness to send me seeds from another locality in the same region. The\r\nseeds were collected in New Hampshire and in my garden produced a true\r\nand constant _cruciata_, but with quite different secondary characters\r\nfrom both the aforesaid varieties. The stems and flower-spikes and even\r\nthe whole foliage were much more slender, and the calyx-tubes of the\r\nflowers were noticeably more elongated. It seems not improbable that\r\n_Oenothera cruciata_ includes a group of lesser unities, and may prove\r\nto comprise a [591] swarm of elementary species, while the original\r\nstrain might even now be still in a condition of mutability. A close\r\nscrutiny in the native region is likely to reveal many unexpected\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nA very interesting novelty has already been described in a former\r\nlecture. It is the _Xanthium wootoni_, discovered in the region about\r\nLas Vegas, New Mexico, by T.D.A. Cockerell. It is similar in all\r\nrespects to _X. commune_, but the burrs are more slender and the\r\nprickles much less numerous, and mostly stouter at their base. It grows\r\nin the same localities as the _X. commune_, and is not recorded to occur\r\nelsewhere. Whether it is an old variety or a recent mutation it is of\r\ncourse impossible to decide. In a culture made in my garden from the\r\nseed sent me by Mr. Cockerell, I observed (1903) that both forms had a\r\nsubvariety with brownish foliage, and, besides this, one of a pure\r\ngreen. Possibly this species, too, is still in a mutable condition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the same may be asserted concerning the beautiful shrub,\r\n_Hibiscus Moscheutos_, observed in quite a number of divergent types by\r\nJohn W. Harshberger. They grew in a small meadow at Seaside Park, New\r\nJersey, in a locality which had been undisturbed for years. They\r\ndiffered from each other in nearly all the [592] organs, in size, in the\r\ndiameter of the stems, which were woody in some and more fleshy in\r\nothers, in the shape of the foliage and in the flowers. More than twenty\r\ntypes could be distinguished and seeds were saved from a number of them,\r\nin order to ascertain whether they are constant, or whether perhaps a\r\nmain stem in a mutating condition might be found among them. If this\r\nshould prove to be the case, the relations between the observed forms\r\nwould probably be analogous to those between the _O. lamarckiana_ and\r\nits derivatives.\r\n\r\nMany other varieties have sprung from the type-species under similar\r\nconditions from time to time. A fern-leaved mercury, _Mercurialis annua\r\nlaciniata_, was discovered in the year 1719 by Marchant. The type was\r\nquite new at the time and maintained itself during a series of years.\r\nThe yellow deadly nightshade or _Atropa Belladonna lutea_ was found\r\nabout 1850 in the Black Forest in Germany in a single spot, and has\r\nsince been multiplied by seeds. It is now dispersed in botanical\r\ngardens, and seems to be quite constant. A dwarf variety of a bean,\r\n_Phaseolus lunatus_, was observed to spring from the ordinary type by a\r\nsudden leap about 1895 by W.W. Tracy, and many similar cases could be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe annual habit is not very favorable for [593] the discovery of new\r\nforms in the wild state. New varieties may appear, but may be crowded\r\nout the first year. The chances are much greater with perennials, and\r\nstill greater with shrubs or trees. A single aberrant specimen may live\r\nfor years and even for centuries, and under such conditions is pretty\r\nsure to be discovered sooner or later. Hence it is no wonder that many\r\nsuch cases are on record. They have this in common that the original\r\nplant of the variety has been found among a vast majority of\r\nrepresentatives of the corresponding species. Nothing of course is\r\ndirectly known about its origin. Intermediate links have as a rule been\r\nwanting, and the seeds, which have often been sown, have not yielded\r\nreliable results, as no care was taken to preserve the blossoms from\r\nintercrossing with their parent-forms.\r\n\r\nStress should be laid upon one feature of these curious occurrences.\r\nRelatively often the same novelty has been found twice or thrice, or\r\neven more frequently, and under conditions which make it very improbable\r\nthat any relation between such occurrences might exist. The same\r\nmutation must have taken place more than once from the same main stem.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of these facts are connected with the origin of the\r\npurple beech, which [594] is now so universally cultivated. I take the\r\nfollowing statements from an interesting historical essay of Prof.\r\nJaggi. He describes three original localities. One is near the Swiss\r\nvillage, Buch am Irchel, and is located on the Stammberg. During the\r\n17th century five purple beeches are recorded to have grown on this\r\nspot. Four of them have died, but one is still alive. Seedlings have\r\ngerminated around this little group, and have been mostly dug up and\r\ntransplanted into neighboring gardens. Nothing is known about the real\r\norigin of these plants, but according to an old document, it seems that\r\nabout the year 1190 the purple beeches of Buch were already enjoying\r\nsome renown, and attracting large numbers of pilgrims, owing to some old\r\nlegend. The church of Embrach is said to have been built in connection\r\nwith this legend, and was a goal for pilgrimages during many centuries.\r\n\r\nA second native locality of the purple beech is found in a forest near\r\nSondershausen in Thuringen, Germany, where a fine group of these trees\r\nis to be seen. They were mentioned for the first time in the latter half\r\nof the eighteenth century, but must have been old specimens long before\r\nthat time. The third locality seems to be of much later origin. It is a\r\nforest near Roveredo in South Tyrol, where a new [595] university is\r\nbeing erected. It is only a century ago that the first specimens of the\r\npurple beech were discovered there.\r\n\r\nAs it is very improbable that the two last named localities should have\r\nreceived their purple beeches from the first named forest, it seems\r\nreasonable to assume that the variety must have been produced at least\r\nthrice.\r\n\r\nThe purple beech is now exceedingly common in cultivation. But Jaggi\r\nsucceeded in showing that all the plants owe their origin to the\r\noriginal trees mentioned above, and are, including nearly all cultivated\r\nspecimens with the sole exception of the vicinity of Buch, probably\r\nderived from the trees in Thuringen. They are easily multiplied by\r\ngrafting, and come true from seed, at least often, and in a high\r\nproportion. Whether the original trees would yield a pure progeny if\r\nfertilized by their own pollen has as yet not been tested. The young\r\nseedlings have purple seed-leaves, and may easily be selected by this\r\ncharacter, but they seem to be always subjected in a large measure to\r\nvicinism.\r\n\r\nMany other instances of trees and shrubs, found in accidental specimens\r\nconstituting a new variety in the wild state, might be given. The\r\noak-leaved beech has been found in a forest of Lippe-Detmold in Germany\r\nand near Versailles, [596] whence it was introduced into horticulture by\r\nCarriere. Similarly divided and cleft leaves seem to have occurred more\r\noften in the wild state, and cut-leaved hazels are recorded from Rouen\r\nin France, birches and alders from Sweden and Lapland, where both are\r\nsaid to have been met with in several forests. The purple barberry was\r\nfound about 1830 by Bertin, near Versailles. Weeping varieties of ashes\r\nwere found wild in England and in Germany, and broom-like oaks, _Quercus\r\npedunculata fastigiata_, are recorded from Hessen-Darmstadt, Calabria,\r\nthe Pyrenees and other localities. About the real origin of all these\r\nvarieties nothing is definitely known.\r\n\r\nThe \"single-leaved\" strawberry is a variety often seen in botanical\r\ngardens, as it is easily propagated by its runners. It was discovered\r\nwild in Lapland at the time of Linnaeus, and appeared afterwards\r\nunexpectedly in a nursery near Versailles. This happened about the year\r\n1760 and Duchesne tested it from seeds and found it constant. This\r\nstrain, however, seems to have died out before the end of the 18th\r\ncentury. In a picture painted by Holbein (1495-1543), strawberry leaves\r\ncan be seen agreeing exactly with the monophyllous type. The variety may\r\nthus be assumed to have arisen independently [597] at least thrice, at\r\ndifferent periods and in distant localities.\r\n\r\nFrom all these statements and a good many others which can be found in\r\nhorticultural and botanical literature, it may be inferred that\r\nmutations are not so very rare in nature as is often supposed. Moreover\r\nwe may conclude that it is a general rule that they are neither preceded\r\nnor accompanied by intermediate steps, and that they are ordinarily\r\nconstant from seed from the first.\r\n\r\nWhy then are they not met with more often? In my opinion it is the\r\nstruggle for life which is the cause of this apparent rarity; which is\r\nnothing else than the premature death of all the individuals that so\r\nvary from the common type of their species as to be incapable of\r\ndevelopment under prevailing circumstances. It is obviously without\r\nconsequence whether these deviations are of a fluctuating or of a\r\nmutating nature. Hence we may conclude that useless mutations will soon\r\ndie out and will disappear without leaving any progeny. Even if they are\r\nproduced again and again by the same strain, but under the same\r\nunfavorable conditions, there will be no appreciable result.\r\n\r\nThousands of mutations may perhaps take place yearly among the plants of\r\nour immediate vicinity without any chance of being discovered. [598] We\r\nare trained to the appreciation of the differentiating marks of\r\nsystematic species. When we have succeeded in discerning these as given\r\nby our local flora lists, we rest content. Meeting them again we are in\r\nthe habit of greeting them with their proper names. Such is the\r\nsatisfaction ensuing from this knowledge that we do not feel any\r\ninclination for further inquiry. Striking deviations, such as many\r\nvarietal characters, may be remarked, but then they are considered as\r\nbeing of only secondary interest. Our minds are turned from the\r\ndelicately shaded features which differentiate elementary species.\r\n\r\nEven in the native field of the evening-primroses, no botanist would\r\nhave discovered the rosettes with smaller or paler leaves, constituting\r\nthe first signs of the new species. Only by the guidance of a distinct\r\ntheoretical idea were they discovered, and having once been pointed out\r\na closer inspection soon disclosed their number.\r\n\r\nVariability seems to us to be very general, but very limited. The limits\r\nhowever, are distinctly drawn by the struggle for existence. Of course\r\nthe chance for useful mutations is a very small one. We have seen that\r\nthe same mutations are as a rule repeated from time to time by the same\r\nspecies. Now, if a useful mutation, [599] or even a wholly indifferent\r\none, might easily be produced, it would have been so, long ago, and\r\nwould at the present time simply exist as a systematic variety. If\r\nproduced anew somewhere the botanist, would take it for the old variety\r\nand would omit to make any inquiry as to its local origin.\r\n\r\nThousands of seeds with perhaps wide circles of variability are ripened\r\neach year, but only those that belong to the existing old narrow circles\r\nsurvive. How different would Nature appear to us if she were free to\r\nevolve all her potentialities!\r\n\r\nDarwin himself was struck with this lack of harmony between common\r\nobservations and the probable real state of things. He discussed it in\r\nconnection with the cranesbill of the Pyrenees (_Geranium pyrenaicum_).\r\nHe described how this fine little plant, which has never been\r\nextensively cultivated, had escaped from a garden in Staffordshire and\r\nhad succeeded in multiplying itself so as to occupy a large area.\r\n\r\nIn doing so it had evidently found place for an uncommonly large number\r\nof plantlets from its seeds and correspondingly it had commenced to vary\r\nin almost all organs and qualities and nearly in all imaginable\r\ndirections. It displayed under these exceptional circumstances a\r\ncapacity which never had been exceeded and [600] which of course would\r\nhave remained concealed if its multiplication had been checked in the\r\nordinary way.\r\n\r\nMany species have had occasion to invade new regions and cover them with\r\nhundreds of thousands of individuals. First are to be cited those\r\nspecies which have been introduced from America into Europe since the\r\ntime of Columbus, or from Europe into this country. Some of them have\r\nbecome very common. In my own country the evening-primroses and Canada\r\nfleabane or are examples, and many others could be given. They should be\r\nexpected to vary under these circumstances in a larger degree. Have they\r\ndone so? Manifestly they have not struck out useful new characters that\r\nwould enable their bearers to found new elementary species. At least\r\nnone have been observed. But poor types might have been produced, and\r\nperiods of mutability might have been gone through similar to that which\r\nis now under observation for Lamarck's evening primrose in Holland.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion we may infer that the chances of discovering new\r\nmutating species are great enough to justify the utmost efforts to\r\nsecure them. It is only necessary to observe large numbers of plants,\r\ngrown under circumstances which allow the best opportunities for [601]\r\nall the seeds. And as nature affords such opportunities only at rare\r\nintervals, we should make use of artificial methods. Large quantities of\r\nseed should be gathered from wild plants and sowed under very favorable\r\nconditions, giving all the nourishment and space required to the young\r\nseedlings. It is recommended that they be sown under glass, either in a\r\nglass-house or protected against cold and rain by glass-frames. The same\r\nlot of seed will be seen to yield twice or thrice as many seedlings if\r\nthus protected, compared with what it would have produced when sown in\r\nthe field or in the garden. I have nearly wholly given up sowing seeds\r\nin my garden, as circumstances can be controlled and determined with\r\ngreater exactitude when the sowing is done in a glasshouse.\r\n\r\nThe best proof perhaps, of the unfavorable influence of external\r\nconditions for slightly deteriorated deviations is afforded by\r\nvariegated leaves. Many beautiful varieties are seen in our gardens and\r\nparks, and even corn has a variety with striped leaves. They are easily\r\nreproduced, both by buds and by seeds, and they are the most ordinary of\r\nall varietal deviations. They may be expected to occur wild also. But no\r\nreal variegated species, nor even good varieties with this attribute\r\noccurs in nature. [602] On the other hand occasional specimens with a\r\nsingle variegated leaf, or with some few of them, are actually met with,\r\nand if attention is once drawn to this question, perhaps a dozen or so\r\ninstances might be brought together in a summer. But they never seem to\r\nbe capable of further evolution, or of reproducing themselves\r\nsufficiently and of repeating their peculiarity in their progeny. They\r\nmake their appearance, are seen during a season, and then disappear.\r\nEven this slight incompleteness of some spots on one or two leaves may\r\nbe enough to be their doom.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that new varieties owe their origin to the direct\r\naction of external conditions and moreover it is often assumed that\r\nsimilar deviations must have similar causes, and that these causes may\r\nact repeatedly in the same species, or in allied, or even systematically\r\ndistant genera. No doubt in the end all things must have their causes,\r\nand the same causes will lead under the same circumstances to the same\r\nresults. But we are not justified in deducing a direct relation between\r\nthe external conditions and the internal changes of plants. These\r\nrelations may be of so remote a nature that they cannot as yet be\r\nguessed at. Therefore only direct experience may be our guide. Summing\r\nup the result of our facts and discussions [603] we may state that wild\r\nnew elementary species and varieties are recorded to have appeared from\r\ntime to time. Invariably this happened by sudden leaps and without\r\nintermediates. The mutants are constant when propagated by seed, and at\r\nonce constitute a new race. In rare instances this may be of sufficient\r\nsuperiority to win a place for itself in nature, but more often it has\r\nqualities which have led to its introduction into gardens as an\r\nornamental plant or into botanical gardens by reason of the interest\r\nafforded by their novelty, or by their anomaly.\r\n\r\nMany more mutations may be supposed to be taking place all around us,\r\nbut artificial sowings on a large scale, combined with a close\r\nexamination of the seedlings and a keen appreciation of the slightest\r\nindications of deviation seem required to bring them to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n[604]\r\nLECTURE XXI\r\n\r\nMUTATIONS IN HORTICULTURE\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Darwin based his theory of natural selection to a\r\nlarge extent upon the experience of breeders. Natural and artificial\r\nselection exhibit the same general features, yet it was impossible in\r\nDarwin's time to make a critical and comparative analysis of the two\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our present conception there is selection of species\r\nand selection within the species. The struggle for life determines which\r\nof a group of elementary species shall survive and which shall\r\ndisappear. In agricultural practice the corresponding process is usually\r\ndesignated by the name of variety-testing. Within the species, or within\r\nthe variety, the sieve of natural selection is constantly eliminating\r\npoor specimens and preserving those that are best adapted to live under\r\nthe given conditions. Some amelioration and some local races are the\r\nresult, but this does not appear to be of much importance. On the\r\ncontrary, the selection [605] within the race holds a prominent place in\r\nagriculture, where it is known by the imposing term, race-breeding.\r\n\r\nExperience and methods in horticulture differ from those in agriculture\r\nin many points. Garden varieties have been tested and separated for a\r\nlong time, but neither vegetables nor flowers are known to exhibit such\r\nmotley groups of types as may be seen in large forage crops.\r\n\r\nNew varieties which appear from time to time may be ornamental or\r\notherwise in flowers, and more or less profitable than their parents in\r\nvegetables and fruits. In either case the difference is usually\r\nstriking, or if not, its culture would be unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of useful new varieties being thus made easy, the whole\r\nattention of the breeder is reduced to isolating the seeds of the\r\nmutants that are to be saved and sown separately, and this process must\r\nbe repeated during a few years, in order to produce the quantity of seed\r\nthat is needed for a profitable introduction of the variety into\r\ncommerce. In proportion to the abundance of the harvest of each year\r\nthis period is shorter for some and longer for other species.\r\n\r\nIsolation in practice is not so simple nor so easy an affair as it is in\r\nthe experimental garden. Hence we have constant and nearly unavoidable\r\n[606] cross-fertilizations with the parent form or with neighboring\r\nvarieties, and consequent impurity of the new strain. This impurity we\r\nhave called vicinism, and in a previous lecture have shown its effects\r\nupon the horticultural races on one hand, and on the other, on the\r\nscientific value that can be ascribed to the experience of the breeder.\r\nWe have established the general rule that stability is seldom met with,\r\nbut that the observed instability is always open to the objection of\r\nbeing the result of vicinism. Often this last agency is its sole cause;\r\nor it may be complicated with other factors without our being able to\r\ndiscern them.\r\n\r\nThough our assertion that the practice of the horticulturist in\r\nproducing new varieties is limited to isolation, whenever chance affords\r\nthem, is theoretically valid, it is not always so. We may discern\r\nbetween the two chief groups of varieties. The retrograde varieties are\r\nconstant, the individuals not differing more from one another than those\r\nof any ordinary species. The highly variable varieties play an important\r\npart in horticulture. Double flowers, striped flowers, variegated leaves\r\nand some others yield the most striking instances. Such forms have been\r\nincluded in previous lectures among the ever-sporting varieties, because\r\ntheir peculiar characters oscillate between two extremes, viz: [607] the\r\nnew one of the variety and the corresponding character of the original\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn such cases isolation is usually accompanied by selection: rarely has\r\nthe first of a double, striped or variegated race well filled or richly\r\nstriped flowers or highly spotted leaves. Usually minor degrees of the\r\nanomaly are seen first, and the breeder expects the novelty to develop\r\nits features more completely and more beautifully in subsequent\r\ngenerations. Some varieties need selection only in the beginning, in\r\nothers the most perfect specimens must be chosen every year as\r\nseed-bearers. For striped flowers, it has been prescribed by Vilmorin,\r\nthat seeds should be taken only from those with the smallest stripes,\r\nbecause there is always reversion. Mixed seed or seed from medium types\r\nwould soon yield plants with too broad stripes, and therefore less\r\ndiversified flowers.\r\n\r\nIn horticulture, new varieties, both retrograde and ever-sporting, are\r\nknown to occur almost yearly. Nevertheless, not every novelty of the\r\ngardener is to be considered as a mutation in the scientific sense of\r\nthe word. First of all, the novelties of perennial and woody species are\r\nto be excluded. Any extreme case of fluctuating variability may be\r\npreserved and multiplied in the vegetative way. Such types are\r\ndesignated [608] in horticulture as varieties, though obviously they are\r\nof quite another nature than the varieties reproduced by seed. Secondly,\r\na large number, no doubt the greater number of novelties, are of hybrid\r\norigin. Here we may discern two cases. Hybrids may be produced by the\r\ncrossing of old types, either of two old cultivated forms or newly\r\nintroduced species, or ordinarily between an old and an introduced\r\nvariety. Such novelties are excluded from our present discussion.\r\nSecondly, hybrids may be produced between a true, new mutation and some\r\nof the already existing varieties of the same species. Examples of this\r\nobvious and usual practice will be given further on, but it must be\r\npointed out now that by such crosses a single mutation may produce as\r\nmany novelties as there are available varieties of the same species.\r\n\r\nSummarizing these introductory remarks we must lay stress on the fact\r\nthat only a small part of the horticultural novelties are real\r\nmutations, although they do occur from time to time. If useful, they are\r\nas a rule isolated and multiplied, and if necessary, improved by\r\nselection. They are in many instances, as constant from seed as the\r\nunavoidable influence of vicinism allows them to be. Exact observations\r\non the origin, or on the degree of constancy, are usually lacking, [609]\r\nthe notes being ordinarily made for commercial purposes, and often only\r\nat the date of introduction into trade, when the preceding stages of the\r\nnovelty may have been partly forgotten.\r\n\r\nWith this necessary prelude I will now give a condensed survey of the\r\nhistorical facts relating to the origin of new horticultural varieties.\r\nAn ample description has been given recently by Korshinsky, a Russian\r\nwriter, who has brought together considerable historical material as\r\nevidence of the sudden appearance of novelties throughout the whole\r\nrealm of garden plants.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known, and at the same time one of the most accurately\r\ndescribed mutations is the origin of the cut-leaved variety of the\r\ngreater celandine or _Chelidonium majus_. This variety has been\r\ndescribed either as such, or as a distinct species, called _Chelidonium\r\nlaciniatum_ Miller.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished from the ordinary species, by the leaves being cut\r\ninto narrow lobes, with almost linear tips, a character which is, as we\r\nhave seen on a previous occasion, repeated in the petals. It is at\r\npresent nearly as commonly cultivated in botanical gardens as the _C.\r\nmajus_, and has escaped in many localities and is observed to thrive as\r\nreadily as the native wild [610] plants. It was not known until a few\r\nyears before the close of the 16th century. Its history has been\r\ndescribed by the French botanist, Rose. It was seen for the first time\r\nin the garden of Sprenger, an apothecary of Heidelberg, where the _C.\r\nmajus_ had been cultivated for many years. Sprenger discovered it in the\r\nyear 1590, and was struck by its peculiar and sharply deviating\r\ncharacters. He was anxious to know whether it was a new plant and sent\r\nspecimens to Clusius and to Plater, the last of whom transmitted them to\r\nCaspar Bauhin. These botanists recognized the type as quite new and\r\nBauhin described it some years afterwards in his Phytopinax under the\r\nname of _Chelidonium majus foliis quernis_, or oak-leaved celandine. The\r\nnew variety soon provoked general interest and was introduced into most\r\nof the botanical gardens of Europe. It was recognized as quite new, and\r\nrepeated search has been made for it in a wild state, but in vain. No\r\nother origin has been discovered than that of Sprenger's garden.\r\nAfterwards it became naturalized in England and elsewhere, but there is\r\nnot the least doubt as to its derivation in all the observed cases.\r\n\r\nHence its origin at Heidelberg is to be considered as historically\r\nproven, and it is of course only legitimate to assume that it originated\r\nin [611] the year 1590 from the seeds of the _C. majus_. Nevertheless,\r\nthis was not ascertained by Sprenger, and some doubt as to a possible\r\nintroduction from elsewhere might arise. If not, then the mutation must\r\nhave been sudden, occurring without visible preparation and without the\r\nappearance of intermediates.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, the cut-leaved celandine has been constant from\r\nseed. Or at least it has been propagated by seed largely and without\r\ndifficulty. Nothing, however, is known about it in the first few years\r\nof its existence. Later careful tests were made by Miller, Rose and\r\nothers and later by myself, which have shown its stability to be\r\nabsolute and without reversion, and it has probably been so from the\r\nbeginning. The fact of its constancy has led to its specific distinction\r\nby Miller, as varieties were in his time universally, and up to the\r\npresent time not rarely, though erroneously, believed to be less stable\r\nthan true species.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the laciniate celandine it is to be noted that in crosses\r\nwith _C. majus_ it follows the law of Mendel, and for this reason should\r\nbe considered as a retrograde variety, the more so, as it is also\r\ntreated as such from a morphological point of view by Stahl and others.\r\n\r\nWe now come to an enumeration of those cases in which the date of the\r\nfirst appearance [612] of a new horticultural variety has been recorded,\r\nand I must apologize for the necessity of again quoting many variations,\r\nwhich have previously been dealt with from another point of view. In\r\nsuch cases I shall limit myself as closely as possible to historical\r\nfacts. They have been recorded chiefly by Verlot and Carriere, who wrote\r\nin Paris shortly after the middle of the past century, and afterwards by\r\nDarwin, Korshinsky, and others. It is from their writings and from\r\nhorticultural literature at large that the following evidence is brought\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nA very well-known instance is that of the dwarf variety of _Tagetes\r\nsignata_, which arose in the nursery of Vilmorin in the year 1860. It\r\nwas observed for the first time in a single individual among a lot of\r\nthe ordinary _Tagetes signata_. It was found impossible to isolate it,\r\nbut the seeds were saved separately. The majority of the offspring\r\nreturned to the parental type, but two plants were true dwarfs. From\r\nthese the requisite degree of purity for commercial purposes was\r\nreached, the vicinists not being more numerous than 10% of the entire\r\nnumber. The same mutation had been observed a year earlier in the same\r\nnursery in a lot of _Saponaria calabrica_. The seeds of this dwarf\r\nrepeated the variety in the next generation, but in the third none were\r\nobserved. Then the variety was [613] thought to be lost, and the culture\r\nwas given up, as the Mendelian law of the splitting of varietal hybrids\r\nwas not known. According to our present knowledge we might expect the\r\natavistic descendants of the first dwarf to be hybrids, and to be liable\r\nto split in their progeny into one-fourth dwarfs and three-fourths\r\nnormal specimens. From this it is obvious that the dwarfs would have\r\nappeared a second time if the strain had been continued by means of the\r\nseeds of the vicinistic progeny.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a return to this phase of the question, another use of\r\nthe vicinists should at once be pointed out. It is the possibility of\r\nincreasing the yield of the new variety. If space admits of sowing the\r\nseeds of the vicinists, a quarter of the progeny may be expected to come\r\ntrue to the new type, and if they were partly pollinated by the dwarfs,\r\neven a larger number would do so. Hence it should be made a rule to sow\r\nthese seeds also, at least when those of the true representatives of the\r\nnovelty do not give seed enough for a rapid multiplication.\r\n\r\nOther dwarfs are recorded to have sprung from species in the same sudden\r\nand unexpected manner, as for instance _Ageratum coeruleum_ of the same\r\nnursery, further _Clematis Viticella nana_ and _Acer campestre nanum_.\r\n_Prunus Mahaleb nana_ was discovered in 1828 in one [614] specimen near\r\nOrleans by Mme. LeBrun in a large culture of Mahaleb. _Lonicera tatarica\r\nnana_ appeared in 1825 at Fontenay-aux Roses. A tall variety of the\r\nstrawberry is called \"Giant of Zuidwijk\" and originated at Boskoop in\r\nHolland in the nursery of Mr. van de Water, in a lot of seedlings of the\r\nordinary strawberry. It was very large, but produced few runners, and\r\nwas propagated with much difficulty, for after six years only 15 plants\r\nwere available. It proved to be a late variety with abundant large\r\nfruit, and was sold at a high price. For a long time it was prominent in\r\ncultures in Holland only.\r\n\r\nVarieties without prickles are known to have originated all of a sudden\r\nin sundry cases. _Gleditschia sinensis_, introduced in 1774 from China,\r\ngave two seedlings without spines in the year 1823, in the nursery of\r\nCaumzet. It is curious in being one of the rare instances where a\r\nsimultaneous mutation in two specimens is acknowledged, because as a\r\nrule, such records comply with the prevailing, though inexact, belief\r\nthat horticultural mutations always appear in single individuals.\r\n\r\nFrom Korshinsky's survey of varieties with cut leaves or laciniate forms\r\nthe following cases may be quoted. In the year 1830 a nurseryman named\r\nJacques had sown a large lot of elms, [615] _Ulmus pedunculata_. One of\r\nthe seedlings had cut leaves. He multiplied it by grafting and gave it\r\nto the trade under the name of _U. pedunculata urticaefolia_. It has\r\nsince been lost.\r\n\r\nLaciniate alders seem to have been produced by mutation at sundry times.\r\nMirbel says that the _Alnus glutinosa laciniata_ is found wild in\r\nNormandy and in the forests of Montmorency near Paris. A similar variety\r\nhas been met with in a nursery near Orleans in the year 1855. In\r\nconnection with this discovery some discussion has arisen concerning the\r\nquestion whether it was probable that the Orleans strain was a new\r\nmutation, or derived in some way from the trees cited by Mirbel. Of\r\ncourse, as always in such cases, any doubt, once pronounced, affects the\r\nimportance of the observation for all time, since it is impossible to\r\ngather sufficient historical evidence to fully decide the point. The\r\nsame variety had appeared under similar circumstances in a nursery at\r\nLyons previously (1812).\r\n\r\nLaciniated maples are said to be of relatively frequent occurrence in\r\nnurseries, among seedlings of the typical species. Loudon says that once\r\n100 laciniated seedlings were seen to originate from seed of some normal\r\ntrees. But in this case it is rather probable that the presumed [616]\r\nnormal parents were in reality hybrids between the type and the\r\nlaciniated form, and simply split according to Mendel's law. This\r\nhypothesis is partly founded on general considerations and partly on\r\nexperiments made by myself with the cut-leaved celandine, previously\r\nalluded to, which I crossed with the type. The hybrids repeated the\r\nfeatures of the species and showed no signs of their internal hybrid\r\nconstitution. But the following year one-fourth of their progeny\r\nreturned to the cut-leaved form. If the same thing has taken place in\r\nthe case of Loudon's maples, but without their hybrid origin being\r\nknown, the result would have been precisely what he observed.\r\n\r\n_Broussonetia papyriffera dissecta_ originated about 1830 at Lyons, and\r\na second time in 1866 at Fontenay-aux-Roses. The cut-leaved hazelnuts,\r\nbirches, beeches and others have mostly been found in the wild state, as\r\nI have already pointed out in a previous lecture. A similar variety of\r\nthe elder, _Sambucus nigra laciniata_, and its near ally, _Sambucus\r\nracemosa laciniata_, are often to be seen in our gardens. They have been\r\non record since 1886 and come true from seed, but their exact origin\r\nseems to have been forgotten. Cut-leaved walnuts have been known since\r\n1812; they come true from seed, but are extremely liable to vicinism, a\r\nnuisance which is [617] ascribed by some authors to the fact that often\r\non the same tree the male catkins flower and fall off several weeks\r\nbefore the ripening of the pistils of the other form of flowers.\r\n\r\nWeeping varieties afford similar instances. _Sophora japonica pendula_\r\noriginated about 1850, and _Gleditschia triacanthos pendula_ some time\r\nlater in a nursery at Chateau-Thierry (Aisne, France). In the year 1821\r\nthe bird's cherry, or _Prunus Padus_, produced a weeping variety, and in\r\n1847 the same mutation was observed for the allied _Prunus Mahaleb_.\r\nNumerous other instances of the sudden origin of weeping trees, both of\r\nconifers and of others, have been brought together in Korshinsky's\r\npaper. This striking type of variation includes perhaps the best\r\nexamples of the whole historical evidence. As a rule they appear in\r\nlarge sowings, only one, or only a few at a time. Many of them have not\r\nbeen observed during their youth, but only after having been planted out\r\nin parks and forests, since the weeping characters show only after\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nThe monophyllous bastard-acacia originated in the same way. Its\r\npeculiarities will be dealt with on another occasion, but the\r\ncircumstances of its birth may as well be given here. In 1855 in the\r\nnursery of Deniau, at Brain-sur-l'Authion (Maine et Loire), it appeared\r\nin a lot of [618] seedlings of the typical species in a single\r\nindividual. This was transplanted into the Jardin des Plantes at Paris,\r\nwhere it flowered and bore seeds in 1865. It must have been partly\r\npollinated by the surrounding normal representatives of the species,\r\nsince the seeds yielded only one-fourth of true offspring. This\r\nproportion, however, has varied in succeeding years. Briot remarks that\r\nthe monophyllous bastard acacia is liable to petaloid alterations of its\r\nstamens, which deficiency may encroach upon its fertility and\r\naccordingly upon the purity of its offspring.\r\n\r\nBroom-like varieties often occur among trees, and some are known for\r\ntheir very striking reversions by buds, as we have seen on a previous\r\noccasion. They are ordinarily called pyramidal or fastigiate forms, and\r\nas far as their history goes, they arise suddenly in large sowings of\r\nthe normal species. The fastigiate birch was produced in this way by\r\nBaumann, the _Abies concolor fastigiata_ by Thibault and Keteleer at\r\nParis, the pyramidal cedar by Paillat, the analogous form of\r\n_Wellingtonia_ by Otin. Other instances could easily be added, though of\r\ncourse some of the most highly prized broom-like trees are so old that\r\nnothing is known about their origin. This, for instance, is the case\r\nwith the pyramidal yew-tree, _Taxus baccata fastigiata_. [619] Others\r\nhave been found wild, as already mentioned in a former lecture.\r\n\r\nAn analogous case is afforded by the purpleleaved plums, of which the\r\nmost known form is Prunus Pissardi. It is said to be a purple variety of\r\n_Prunus cerasifera_, and was introduced at the close of the seventies\r\nfrom Persia, where it is said to have been found in Tabris. A similar\r\nvariety arose independently and unexpectedly in the nursery of Spath,\r\nnear Berlin, about 1880, but it seems to differ in some minor points\r\nfrom the Persian prototype.\r\n\r\nA white variety of _Cyclamen vernum_ made its appearance in the year\r\n1836 in Holland. A single individual was observed for the first time\r\namong a large lot of seedlings, in a nursery near Haarlem. It yielded a\r\nsatisfactory amount of seed, and the progeny was true to the new type.\r\nSuch plants propagate slowly, and it was only twenty-seven years later\r\n(1863) that the bulbs were offered for sale by the Haarlem firm of\r\nKrelage & Son. The price of each bulb was $5.00 in that year, but soon\r\nafterwards was reduced to $1.00 each, which was about thrice the\r\nordinary price of the red variety.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Messrs. Krelage & Son has brought into commerce a wide range\r\nof new bulb-varieties, all due to occasional mutations, some by seed and\r\nothers by buds, or to the accidental [620] transference of new qualities\r\ninto the already existing varieties by cross-pollination through the\r\nagency of insects. Instead of giving long lists of these novelties, I\r\nmay cite the black tulips, which cost during the first few years of\r\ntheir introduction about $25.00 apiece.\r\n\r\nHorticultural mutations are as a rule very rare, especially in genera or\r\nspecies which have not yet been brought to a high degree of variability.\r\nIn these the wide range of varieties and the large scale in which they\r\nare multiplied of course give a greater chance for new varieties. But\r\nthen the possibilities of crossing are likewise much larger, and\r\napparent changes due to this cause may easily be taken for original\r\nmutations.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of the mutations is often proved by the lapse of time between\r\nthe introduction of a species and its first sport. Some instances may be\r\ngiven. They afford a proof of the length of the period during which the\r\nspecies remained unaltered, although some of these alterations may be\r\ndue to a cross with an allied form. _Erythrina Crista-galli_ was\r\nintroduced about 1770, and produced its first sport in 1884, after more\r\nthan a century of cultivation. _Begonia semperflorens_ has been\r\ncultivated since 1829, and for half a century before it commenced\r\nsporting. The same length of time has elapsed [621] between the first\r\nculture and the first variation of _Crambe maritima_. Other cases are on\r\nrecord in which the variability exhibited itself much sooner, perhaps\r\nwithin a few years after the original discovery of the species. But such\r\ninstances seem, as a rule, to be subject to doubt as to the concurrence\r\nof hybridization. So for instance the _Iris lortetii_, introduced in the\r\nyear 1895 from the Lebanon, which produced a white variety from its very\r\nfirst seeds. If by chance the introduced plants were natural hybrids\r\nbetween the species and the white variety, this apparent and rather\r\nimprobable mutation would find a very simple explanation. The length of\r\nthe period preceding the first signs of variability is largely, of\r\ncourse, due to divergent methods of culture. Such species as\r\n_Erythrina_, which are perennial and only sown on a small scale, should\r\nnot be expected to show varieties very soon. Annual species, which are\r\ncultivated yearly in thousands or even hundreds of thousands of\r\nindividuals, have a much better chance. Perhaps the observed differences\r\nare largely due to this cause.\r\n\r\nMonstrosities have, from time to time, given rise to cultivated races.\r\nThe cockscomb or _Celosia_ is one of the most notorious instances.\r\nCauliflowers, turnips and varieties of cabbages are recorded by De\r\nCandolle to have arisen in [622] culture, more than a century ago, as\r\nisolated monstrous individuals. They come true from seed, but show\r\ndeviations from time to time which seem to be intimately linked with\r\ntheir abnormal characters. Apetalous flowers may be considered as\r\nanother form of monstrosity, and in _Salpiglossis sinuata_ such a\r\nvariety without a corolla made its appearance in the year 1892 in the\r\nnursery of Vilmorin. It appeared suddenly, yielded a good crop of seed\r\nand was constant from the outset, without any sign of vicinism or\r\nimpurity.\r\n\r\nIn several cases the origin of a variety is obscure, while the\r\nsubsequent historical evidence is such as to make an original sudden\r\nappearance quite probable. Although these instances offer but indirect\r\nevidence, and will sooner or later lose their importance, it seems\r\ndesirable to lay some stress on them here, because most of these cases\r\nare very obvious and more striking than purely historical facts. Sterile\r\nvarieties belong to this heading. Sometimes they bear fruit without\r\nkernels, sometimes flowers without sexual organs, or even no flowers at\r\nall. Instances have been given in the lecture on retrograde varieties;\r\nthey are ordinarily assumed to have originated by a leap, because it is\r\nnot quite clear how a loss of the capacity for the formation of seeds\r\ncould have been slowly accumulated [623] in preceding generations. An\r\ninteresting case is afforded by a sterile variety of corn, which\r\noriginated some time ago in my own pedigree-cultures made for another\r\npurpose, and which had begun with an ear of 1886. The first generation\r\nfrom the original seeds showed nothing particular, but the second at\r\nonce produced quite a number of sterile plants. The sterility was caused\r\nby the total lack of branches, including those bearing the pistillate\r\nflowers. The terminal spikes themselves were reduced to naked spindles,\r\nwithout branches, without flowers and even almost without bracts.\r\n\r\nIn some individuals, however, this negative character was seen to give\r\nway at the tip, showing a few small naked branches. Of course it was\r\nimpossible to propagate this curious form, but my observations showed\r\nthat it sprang into existence from known ancestors by a single step or\r\nsudden leap. This leap, however, was not confined to a single specimen;\r\non the contrary it affected 40 plants out of a culture of 340\r\nindividuals. The same phenomenon was repeated from the seeds of the\r\nnormal plants in the following year, but afterwards the monstrosity\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Italian poplar affords another instance. It is considered by some\r\nauthors as a distinct species, _Populus italica_, and by others as a\r\n[624] broom-like variety of the _Populus nigra_, from which it is\r\ndistinguished by its erect branches and other characters of minor\r\nimportance. It is often called the pyramidal or fastigiate poplar. Its\r\norigin is absolutely unknown and it occurs only in the cultivated state.\r\nIn Italy it seems to have been cultivated from the earliest historical\r\ntimes, but it was not introduced into other countries till the\r\neighteenth century. In 1749 it was brought into France, and in 1758 into\r\nEngland, and to day it may be seen along roads throughout central Europe\r\nand in a large part of Asia. But the most curious fact is that it is\r\nonly observed in staminate specimens; pistillate trees have not been\r\nfound, although often sought for. This circumstance makes it very\r\nprobable that the origin of the broom-like poplar was a sudden mutation,\r\nproducing only one individual. This being staminate, it has been\r\npropagated exclusively by cuttings. It is to be admitted, however, that\r\nno material evidence is at hand to prove that it is not an original wild\r\nspecies, the pistillate form of which has been lost by vegetative\r\nmultiplication. One form only of many dioecious plants is to be found in\r\ncultivation, as, for instance some South American species of _Ribes_.\r\n\r\nTotal lack of historical evidence concerning [625] the origin of a\r\nvariety has sometimes been considered as sufficient proof of a sudden\r\norigin. The best known instance is that of the renowned cactus-dahlia\r\nwith its recurved instead of incurved ray-florets. It was introduced\r\nfrom Mexico into the Netherlands by Van den Berg of Jutphaas, under the\r\nfollowing remarkable circumstances. In the autumn of 1872 one of his\r\nfriends had sent him a small case, containing seeds, bulbs and roots\r\nfrom Mexico. From one of these roots a _Dahlia_ shoot developed. It was\r\ncultivated with great care and bloomed next year. It surprised all who\r\nsaw it by the unexpected peculiarity of its large rich crimson flowers,\r\nthe rays of which were reversed tubular. The margins of the narrow rays\r\nwere curved backwards, showing the bright color of the upper surface. It\r\nwas a very showy novelty, rapidly multiplied by cuttings, and was soon\r\nintroduced into commerce. It has since been crossed with nearly all\r\nother available varieties of the _Dahlia_, giving a large and rich group\r\nof forms, bound together by the curious curling of the petals. It has\r\nnever been observed to grow in Mexico, either wild or in gardens, and\r\nthus the introduced individual has come to be considered as the first of\r\nits race.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned that the rapid production of large numbers of\r\nnew varieties, by [626] means of the crossing of the offspring of a\r\nsingle mutant with previously existing sorts, is a very common feature\r\nin horticultural practice. It warns us that only a small part of the\r\nnovelties introduced yearly are due to real mutations. Further instances\r\nof novelties with such a common origin are the purple-leaved dahlias,\r\nthe gooseberries without prickles, the double petunias, erect gloxinias\r\nand many others. Accumulation of characters, acquired in different races\r\nof a species, may easily be effected in this way; in fact it is one of\r\nthe important factors in the breeding of horticultural novelties.\r\n\r\nI have alluded more than once in this lecture to the question, whether\r\nit is probable that mutations occur in one individual or in more. The\r\ncommon belief among horticulturists is that, as a rule, they appear in a\r\nsingle plant. This belief is so widespread that whenever a novelty is\r\nseen for the first time in two or more specimens it is at once suggested\r\nthat it might have originated and been overlooked in a previous\r\ngeneration. Not caring to confess a lack of close observation, the\r\nnumber of mutants in such cases is usually kept secret. At least this\r\nstatement has been made to me by some of the horticulturists at Erfurt,\r\nwhom I visited some years ago in order to learn as much as [627]\r\npossible about the methods of production of their novelties. Hence it is\r\nsimply impossible to decide the question on the basis of the experience\r\nof the breeders. Even in the case of the same novelty arising in sundry\r\nvarieties of the same species, the question as to common origin, by\r\nmeans of crossing, is often hard to decide, as for instance in\r\nmoss-roses and nectarines. On the other hand, instances are on record\r\nwhere the same novelty has appeared at different times, often at long\r\nintervals. Such is the case with the butterfly-cyclamen, a form with\r\nwide-spreading petals which originated in Martin's nursery in England.\r\nThe first time it was seen it was thought to be of no value, and was\r\nthrown away, but when appearing for a second time it was multiplied and\r\neventually placed on the market. Other varieties of _Cyclamen_, as for\r\ninstance the crested forms, are also known to have originated\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this series of examples of horticultural mutations, I\r\nmight mention two cases, which have occurred in my own experimental\r\ngarden. The first refers to a tubular _Dahlia_. It has ray-florets, the\r\nligules of which have their margins grown together so as to form tubes,\r\nwith the outer surface corresponding to the pale under-surface of the\r\ncorolla.\r\n\r\nThis novelty originated in a single plant in a [628] culture from the\r\nseed of the dwarf variety \"Jules Chretien.\" The seeds were taken from\r\nintroduced plants in my garden, and as the sport has no ornamental value\r\nit is uncertain whether this was the first instance or whether it had\r\npreviously occurred in the nursery at Lyons, from whence the bulbs were\r\nsecured. Afterwards it proved true from seed, but was very variable,\r\nexhibiting rather the features of an ever-sporting variety.\r\n\r\nAnother novelty was seen the first time in several individuals. It was a\r\npink sport of the European cranesbill, _Geranium pratense_. It arose\r\nquite unexpectedly in the summer of 1902 from a striped variety of the\r\nblue species. It was seen in seven specimens out of a lot of about a\r\nhundred plants. This strain was introduced into my garden in 1897, when\r\nI bought two plants under the name of _Geranium pratense album_, which\r\nhowever proved to belong to the striped variety. From their seeds I\r\nsowed in 1898 a first generation, of which a hundred plants flowered the\r\nnext year, and from their seeds I sowed in 1900 the lot which produced\r\nthe sport. Neither the introduced plants nor their offspring had\r\nexhibited the least sign of a color-variation, besides the blue and\r\nwhite stripes. Hence it is very probable that my novelty was a true\r\nfirst mutation, the more probably [629] so since a pink variety would\r\nwithout doubt have a certain horticultural value and would have been\r\npreserved if it had occurred. But as far as I have been able to\r\nascertain, it is as yet unknown, nor has it been described until today.\r\n\r\nSumming up the results of this long, though very incomplete, list of\r\nhorticultural novelties with a more or less well-known origin, we see\r\nthat sudden appearances are the rule. Having once sprung into existence\r\nthe new varieties are ordinarily constant, except as affected by\r\nvicinism. Details concerning the process are mostly unavailable or at\r\nleast are of very doubtful value. And to this it should be added that\r\nreally progressive mutations have hardly been observed in horticulture.\r\nHence the theoretical value of the facts is far less than might have\r\nbeen expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n[630]\r\nLECTURE XXII\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC ATAVISM\r\n\r\nThe steady cooperation of progression and retrogression is one of the\r\nimportant principles of organic evolution. I have dwelt upon this point\r\nmore than once in previous lectures. I have tried to show that both in\r\nthe more important lines of the general pedigree of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and in the numerous lateral branches ending in the genera and\r\nspecies within the families, progression and retrogression are nearly\r\nalways at work together. Your attention has been directed to the\r\nmonocotyledons as an example, where retrogression is everywhere so\r\nactive that it can almost be said to be the prevailing movement.\r\nReduction in the vegetative and generative organs, in the anatomical\r\nstructure and growth of the stems, and in sundry other ways is the\r\nmethod by which the monocotyledons have originated as a group from their\r\nsupposed ancestors among the lower dicotyledonous families.\r\nRetrogression is the leading idea in the larger families of the group,\r\n[631] as for instance in the aroids and the grasses. Retrograde\r\nevolution is also typical in the highest and most highly differentiated\r\nfamily of the monocotyledons, the orchids, which have but one or two\r\nstamens. In the second place I have had occasion more than once to\r\nassert that retrogression, though seemingly consisting in the\r\ndisappearance of some quality, need not, as a rule, be considered as a\r\ncomplete loss. Quite on the contrary, it is very probable that real\r\nlosses are extremely rare, if not wholly lacking. Ordinarily the loss is\r\nonly apparent, the capacity becomes inactive only, but is not destroyed.\r\nThe character has become latent, as it is commonly stated, and therefore\r\nmay return to activity and to the full display of its peculiarity,\r\nwhenever occasion offers.\r\n\r\nSuch a return to activity was formerly called atavism. But as we have\r\nseen, when dealing with the phenomena of latency at large, sundry cases\r\nof latency are to be distinguished, in order to get a clear insight into\r\nthese difficult processes.\r\n\r\nSo it is with atavism, too. If any plant reverts to a known ancestor, we\r\nhave a positive and simple case. But ancestors with alternate specific\r\nmarks are as a rule neither historically nor experimentally manifest.\r\nThey are only reputed to be such, and the presumption rests [632] upon\r\nthe systematic affinity between the derivative species and its nearest\r\nprobable allies. Such reversions are now to be examined at some length\r\nand may be adequately treated under the head of systematic atavism. To\r\nthis form of atavism pertain, on the basis of our definition, those\r\nphenomena by which species assume one or more characters of allies, from\r\nwhich they are understood to have descended by the loss of the character\r\nunder discussion. The phenomena themselves consist in the production of\r\nanomalies and varieties, and as the genetic relation of the latter is\r\noften hardly beyond doubt, the anomalies seem to afford the best\r\ninstances for the study of systematic atavism. This study has for its\r\nchief aim the demonstration of the presence of the latent characters,\r\nand to show that they return to activity suddenly and not by a slow and\r\ngradual recovery of the former features. It supports the assertion that\r\nthe visible elementary characters are essentially an external display of\r\nqualities carried by the bearers of heredity, and that these bearers are\r\nseparate entities, which may be mingled together, but are not fused into\r\na chaotic primitive life-substance. Systematic atavism by this means\r\nleads us to a closer examination of the internal and concealed causes,\r\nwhich rule the affinities and divergencies of [633] allied species. It\r\nbrings before us and emphasizes the importance of the conception of the\r\nso-called unit-characters.\r\n\r\nThe primrose will serve as an example. In the second lecture we have\r\nseen that the old species of Linnaeus, the _Primula veris_, was split up\r\nby Jacquin into three smaller ones, which are called _P. officinalis_,\r\n_P. elatior_ and _P. acaulis_. From this systematic treatment we can\r\ninfer that these three forms are assumed to be derived from a common\r\nancestor. Now two of them bear their flowers in bracted whorls,\r\ncondensed into umbels at the summits of a scape. The scapes themselves\r\nare inserted in the axils of the basal leaves, and produce the flowers\r\nabove them. In the third species, _Primula acaulis_, this scape is\r\nlacking and the flowers are inserted singly in the axils on long slender\r\nstalks. For this reason the species is called acaulescent, indicating\r\nthat it has no other stem than the subterranean rootstock. But on closer\r\ninspection we observe that the flower stalks are combined into little\r\ngroups, each group occupying the aril of one of the basal leaves. This\r\nfact at once points to an analogy with the umbellate allies, and induces\r\nus to examine the insertion of the flowers more critically. In doing so\r\nwe find that they are united at their base so as to constitute a sessile\r\numbel. [634] The scapes are not absolutely lacking, but only reduced to\r\nalmost invisible rudiments.\r\n\r\nRelying upon this conclusion we infer that all of the three elementary\r\nspecies have umbels, some pedunculate and the others not. On this point\r\nthey agree with the majority of the allied species in the genus and in\r\nother genera, as for instance in _Androsace_. Hence the conclusion that\r\nthe common ancestors were perennial plants with a rootstock bearing\r\ntheir flowers in umbels or whorls on scapes. Lacking in the _Primula\r\nveris_, these scapes must obviously have been lost at the time of the\r\nevolution of this form.\r\n\r\nProceeding on this line of speculation we at once see that a very\r\nadequate opportunity for systematic atavism is offered here. According\r\nto our general conception the apparent loss of a scape is no proof of a\r\ncorresponding internal loss, but might as well be caused simply by the\r\nreduction of the scape-growing capacity to a latent or inactive state.\r\nIt might be awakened afterwards by some unknown agency, and return to\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nNow this is exactly what happens from time to time. In Holland the\r\nacaulescent primrose is quite a common plant, filling the woods in the\r\nspring with thousands of clusters of bright yellow flowers. It is a very\r\nuniform type, but in [635] some years it is seen to return to atavistic\r\nconditions in some rare individuals. More than once I have observed such\r\ncases myself, and found that the variation is only a partial one,\r\nproducing one or rarely two umbels on the same plant, and liable to fail\r\nof repetition when the varying specimens are transplanted into the\r\ngarden for further observation. But the fact remains that scapes occur.\r\nThe scapes themselves are of varying length, often very short, and\r\nseldom long, and their umbels display the involucre of bracts in a\r\nmanner quite analogous to that of the _Primula officinalis_ and _P.\r\nelatior_. To my mind this curious anomaly strongly supports the view of\r\nthe latent condition of the scape in the acaulescent species, and that\r\nsuch a dormant character must be due to a descent from ancestors with\r\nactive scapes, seems to be in no need of further reiteration. Returning\r\nto activity the scapes at once show a full development, in no way\r\ninferior to that of the allied forms, and only unstable in respect to\r\ntheir length.\r\n\r\nA second example is afforded by the bracts of the crucifers. This group\r\nis easily distinguished by its cruciform petals and the grouping of the\r\nflowers into long racemes. In other families each flower of such an\r\ninflorescence would be subtended by a bract, according to the [636]\r\ngeneral rule that in the higher plants side branches are situated in the\r\narils of leaves. Bracts are reduced leaves, but the spikes of the\r\ncruciferous plants are generally devoid of them. The flower-stalks, with\r\nnaked bases, seem to arise from the common axis at indefinite points.\r\n\r\nHence the inference that crucifers are an exception to a general rule,\r\nand that they must have originated from other types which did comply\r\nwith this rule, and accordingly were in the possession of floral bracts.\r\nOr, in other words, that the bracts must have been lost during the\r\noriginal evolution of the whole family. This conclusion being accepted,\r\nthe accidental re-apparition of bracts within the family must be\r\nconsidered as a case of systematic atavism, quite analogous to the\r\nre-appearance of the scapes in the acaulescent primrose. The systematic\r\nimportance of this phenomenon, however, is far greater than in the first\r\ncase, in which we had only to deal with a specific character, while the\r\nabolition of the bracts has become a feature of a whole family.\r\n\r\nThis reversion is observed to take place according to two widely\r\ndifferent principles. On one hand, bracts may be met with in a few stray\r\nspecies, assuming the rank of a specific character. On the other hand\r\nthey may be seen [637] to occur as an anomaly, incompletely developed,\r\noften very rare and with all the appearance of an accidental variation,\r\nbut sometimes so common as to seem nearly normal.\r\n\r\nComing now to particular instances, we may turn our attention in the\r\nfirst place to the genus _Sisymbrium_. This is a group of about 50\r\nspecies, of wide geographic distribution, among which the hedge mustard\r\n(_S. officinalis_) is perhaps the most common of weeds. Two species are\r\nreputed to have bracts, _Sisymbrium hirsutum_ and _S. supinum_. Each\r\nflower-stalk of their long racemes is situated in the aril of such a\r\nbract, and the peculiarity is quite a natural one, corresponding exactly\r\nto what is seen in the inflorescence of other families. Besides the\r\n_Sisymbrium some six other genera afford similar structures.\r\n\r\n_Erucastrum pollichii_ has been already alluded to in a former lecture\r\nwhen dealing with the same problem from another point of view. As\r\npreviously stated, it is one of the most manifest and most easily\r\naccessible examples of a latent character becoming active through\r\nsystematic atavism. In fact, its bracts are found so often as to be\r\nconsidered by some authors as of quite normal occurrence. Contrasted\r\nwith those of the above mentioned species of _Sisymbrium_, they are not\r\nseen at the base of all the flower [638] stalks, but are limited to the\r\nlowermost part of the raceme, adorning a few, often ten or twelve, and\r\nrarely more flower-stalks. Moreover they exhibit a feature which is\r\nindicative of the presence of an abnormality. They are not all of the\r\nsame size, but decrease in length from the base of the raceme upward,\r\nand finally slowly disappear.\r\n\r\nBesides these rare cases there are quite a number of cruciferous species\r\non record, which have been observed to bear bracts. Penzig in his\r\nvaluable work on teratology gives a list of 33 such genera, many of them\r\nrepeating the anomaly in more than one species. Ordinary cabbages are\r\nperhaps the best known instance, and any unusual abundance of\r\nnourishment, or anomalous cause of growth seems to be liable to incite\r\nthe development of bracts. The hedge garlic or garlic mustard\r\n(_Alliaria_), the shepherd's purse, the wormseed or _Erysimum\r\ncheiranthoides_ and many others afford instances. In my cultures of\r\nHeeger's shepherd's purse, the new species derived at Landau in Germany\r\nfrom the common shepherd's purse, the anomaly was observed to occur more\r\nthan once, showing that the mutation, which changed the fruits, had not\r\nin the least affected this subordinate anomalous peculiarity. In all\r\nthese cases the bracts behave as with the Erucastrum, [639] being\r\nlimited to the base of the spike, and decreasing in size from the lower\r\nflowers upward. Connected with these atavistic bracts is a feature of\r\nminor importance, which however, by its almost universal accompaniment\r\nof the bracts, deserves our attention, as it is indicative of another\r\nlatent character. As a rule, the bracts are grown together with their\r\naxillary flower-stalk. This cohesion is not complete, nor is it always\r\ndeveloped in the same degree. Sometimes it extends over a large part of\r\nthe two organs, leaving only their tips free, but on other occasions it\r\nis limited to a small part of the base. But it is very interesting that\r\nthis same cohesion is to be seen in the shepherd's purse, in the\r\nwormseed and in the cabbage, as well as in the case of the _Erucastrum_\r\nand most of the other observed cases of atavistic bracts. This fact\r\nsuggests the idea of a common origin for these anomalies, and would lead\r\nto the hypothesis that the original ancestors of the whole family,\r\nbefore losing the bracts, exhibited this peculiar mode of cohesion.\r\n\r\nBracts and analogous organs afford similar cases of systematic atavism\r\nin quite a number of other families. Aroids sometimes produce long\r\nbracts from various places on their spadix, as may be seen in the\r\ncultivated greenhouse species, _Anthurium scherzerianum_. [640] Poppies\r\nhave been recorded to bear bracts analogous to the little scales on the\r\nflower-stalks of the pansies, on the middle of their flower stalks. A\r\nsimilar case is shown by the yellow foxglove or _Digitalis parviflora_.\r\nThe foxgloves as a rule have naked flower-stalks, without the two little\r\nopposite leafy organs seen in so many other instances. The yellow\r\nspecies, however, has been seen to produce such scales from time to\r\ntime. The honeysuckle genus is, as a rule, devoid of the stipules at the\r\nbase of the petiole, but _Lonicera etrusca_ has been observed to develop\r\nsuch organs, which were seen to be free in some, but in other specimens\r\nwere adnate to the base of the leaf, and even connate with those of the\r\nopposite leaf.\r\n\r\nOther instances could be given proving that bracts and stipules, when\r\nsystematically lacking, are liable to reappear as anomalies. In doing\r\nso, they generally assume the peculiar characters that would be expected\r\nof them by comparison with allied genera in which they are of normal\r\noccurrence. There can be no doubt that their absence is due to an\r\napparent loss, resulting from the reduction of a formerly active quality\r\nto inactivity. Resuming this effective state, the case attains the value\r\nand significance accorded to systematic atavism.\r\n\r\nA very curious instance of reduced bracts, developing [641] to unusual\r\nsize, is afforded by a variety of corn, which is called _Zea Mays\r\ncryptosperma_, or _Zea Mays tunicata_. In ordinary corn the kernels are\r\nsurrounded by small and thin, inconspicuous and membranaceous scales.\r\nInvisible on the integrate spikes, when ripe, they are easily detected\r\nby pulling the kernels out. In _cryptosperma_ they are so strongly\r\ndeveloped as to completely hide the kernels. Obviously they constitute a\r\ncase of reversion to the characters of some unknown ancestor, since the\r\ncorn is the only member of the grass-family with naked kernels. The var.\r\n_tunicata_, for this same reason, has been considered to be the original\r\nwild form, from which the other varieties of corn have originated. But\r\nas no historical evidence on this point is at hand, we must leave it as\r\nit is, notwithstanding the high degree of attractiveness attached to the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe horsetail-family may be taken as a further support of our assertion.\r\nSome species have stems of two kinds, the fertile being brownish and\r\nappearing in early spring before the green or sterile ones. In others\r\nthe stems are all alike, green and crowned with a conelike spike of\r\nsporangia-bearing scales. Manifestly the dimorphous cases are to be\r\nconsidered as the younger ones, partly because they are obvious\r\nexceptions to the common rule, and [642] partly because the division of\r\nlabor is indicative of a higher degree of evolution. But sometimes these\r\ndimorphic species are seen to revert to the primary condition,\r\ndeveloping a fertile cone at the summit of the green summer-stem. I have\r\nhad the opportunity of collecting an instance of this anomaly on the\r\ntall _Equisetum telmateja_ in Switzerland, and other cases are on record\r\nin teratological literature. It is an obvious example of systematic\r\natavism, occurring suddenly and with the full development of all the\r\nqualities needed for the normal production of sporangia and spores. All\r\nof these must be concealed in a latent condition within the young\r\ntissues of the green stems.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have had occasion to deal with the phenomenon of\r\ntorsions, as exhibited by the teasels and some other plants. This\r\nanomaly has been shown to be analogous to the cases described as double\r\nadaptations. The capacity of evolving antagonistic characters is\r\nprominent in both. The antagonists are assumed to lie quietly together\r\nwhile inactive. But as soon as evolution calls them into activity they\r\nbecome mutually exclusive, because only one of them can come to full\r\ndisplay in the same organ. External influences decide which of the two\r\nbecomes dominant and which remains dormant. This decision must take\r\nplace separately [643] for each stem and each branch, but as a rule, the\r\nstronger ages are more liable to furnish anomalies than the weaker.\r\n\r\nExactly the same thing is true of double adaptations. Every bud of the\r\nwater-persicaria may develop either into an erect or into a floating\r\nstem, according as it is surrounded by water or by relatively dry soil.\r\nIn other cases utility is often less manifest, but some use may either\r\nbe proved, or shown to be very probable. At all events the term\r\nadaptation includes the idea of utility, and obviously useless\r\ncontrivances could hardly be brought under the same head.\r\n\r\nWe have also dealt with the question of heredity. It is obvious that\r\nfrom the flowers of the floating and erect stems of the water-persicaria\r\nseeds will result, each capable of yielding both forms. Quite the same\r\nthing was the case with the teasels. Some 40% of the progeny produce\r\nbeautifully twisted stems, but whether the seed was saved from the most\r\ncompletely twisted specimens or from the straight plants of the race was\r\nof no importance.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon of twisting may now be considered from quite another\r\npoint of view. It is a case of systematic atavism, or of the\r\nreacquirement of some ancient and long-lost quality. This quality is the\r\nalternate position of [644] the leaves, which has been replaced in the\r\nteasel family by a grouping in pairs. In order to prove the validity of\r\nthis assertion, it will be necessary to discuss two points separately,\r\nviz.: relative positions of the leaves, and the manner in which the\r\nalternate position causes the stems to become twisted.\r\n\r\nLeaves are affixed to their stems and branches in various ways. Among\r\nthem one is of wide occurrence throughout the whole realm of the higher\r\nplants, while all the others are more rare. Moreover these subordinate\r\narrangements are, as a rule, confined to definite systematic groups.\r\nSuch groups may be large, as for instance, the monocotyledons, that have\r\ntheir leaves arranged in two opposite rows in many families, or small,\r\nas genera or subdivisions of genera. Apart from these special cases the\r\nmain stem and the greater part of the branches of the pedigree of the\r\nhigher plants exhibit a spiral condition or a screw arrangement, all\r\nleaves being inserted at different points and on different sides of the\r\nstem. This condition is assumed to be the original one, from which the\r\nmore specialized types have been derived. As is usual with characters in\r\ngeneral, it is seen to vary around an average, the spiral becoming\r\nnarrower and looser. A narrow spiral condenses the leaves, while a [645]\r\nloose one disperses them. According to such fluctuating deviations the\r\nnumber of leaves, inserted upon a given number of spiral circuits, is\r\ndifferent in different species. In a vast majority of cases 13 leaves\r\nare found on 5 circuits, and as we have only to deal with this\r\nproportion in the teasels we will not consider others.\r\n\r\nIn the teasels this screw-arrangement has disappeared, and has been\r\nreplaced by a decussate grouping. The leaves are combined into pairs,\r\neach pair occupying the opposite sides of one node. The succeeding pairs\r\nalternate with one another, so as to place their leaves at right angles.\r\nThe leaves are thus arranged on the whole stem in four equidistant rows.\r\n\r\nOn the normal stem of a teasel the two members of a pair are tied to one\r\nanother in a comparatively complicated way. The leaves are broadly\r\nsessile and their bases are united so as to constitute a sort of cup.\r\nThe margins of these cups are bent upward, thereby enabling them to hold\r\nwater, and after a rainfall they may be seen filled to the brim. It is\r\nbelieved that these little reservoirs are useful to the plant during the\r\nflowering period, because they keep the ants away from the honey.\r\nConsidering the internal structure of the stem at the base of these cups\r\nwe find that the vascular bundles of the two opposite leaves are\r\nstrongly connected [646] with one another, constituting a ring which\r\nnarrowly surrounds the stem, and which would impede an increase in\r\nthickness, if such were in the nature of the plant. But since the stems\r\nend their existence during the summer of their development, this\r\nstructure is of no real harm.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the leaves in alternate pairs may be seen within the bud\r\nas well as on the adult stems. In order to do this, it is necessary to\r\nmake transverse sections through the heart of the rosette of the leaves\r\nof the first year. If cut through the base, the pair exhibit connate\r\nwings, corresponding to the water-cups; if cut above these, the leaves\r\nseem to be free from one another.\r\n\r\nIn order to compare the position of leaves of the twisted plants with\r\nthis normal arrangement, the best way is to make a corresponding section\r\nthrough the heart of the rosette of the first year. It is not necessary\r\nto make a microscopic preparation. In the fall the changed disposition\r\nmay at once be seen to affect the central leaves of the group. All the\r\nrosettes of the whole race commence with opposite leaves; those that are\r\nto produce straight stems remain in this condition, but the preparation\r\nfor twisting begins at the end of the first year as shown by a special\r\narrangement of the leaves. This [647] disposition may then be seen to\r\nextend to the very center of the rosette, by use of microscopical\r\nsections. Examining sections made in the spring, the original\r\narrangement of the leaves of the stem is observed to continue until the\r\nbeginning of the growth of the shoot. It is easy to estimate the number\r\nof leaves corresponding to a given number of spiral circuits in these\r\nsections and the proportion is found to indicate 13 leaves on 5 turns.\r\nThese figures are the same as those given above for the ordinary\r\narrangement of alternate leaves in the main lines of the pedigree of the\r\nvegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside for the moment the subsequent changes of this spiral\r\narrangement, it becomes at once clear that here we have a case of\r\nsystematic atavism. The twisted teasels lose their decussation, but in\r\ndoing so the leaves are not left in a disorderly dispersion, but a\r\ndistinct new arrangement takes its place, which is to be assumed as the\r\nnormal one for the ancestors of the teasel family. The case is to be\r\nconsidered as one of atavism. Obviously no other explanation is\r\npossible, than the supposition that the 5-13 spiral is still latent,\r\nthough not displayed by the teasels. But in the very moment when the\r\nfaculty of decussation disappears, it resumes its place, and becomes\r\n[648] as prominent as it must once have been in the ancestors, and is\r\nstill in that part of their offspring, which has not become changed in\r\nthis respect. Thus the proof of our assertion of systematic atavism is,\r\nin this case, not obtained by the inspection of the adult, but by the\r\ninvestigation of the conditions in an early stage. It remains to be\r\nexplained how the twisting may finally be caused by this incipient\r\ngrouping of the leaves. Before doing so, it may be as well to state that\r\nthe case of the teasel is not an isolated one, and that the same\r\nconclusions are supported by the valerian, and a large number of other\r\nexamples. In early spring some rosettes show a special condition of the\r\nleaves, indicating thereby at once their atavism and their tendency to\r\nbecome twisted as soon as they begin to expand. The Sweet William or\r\n_Dianthus barbatus_ affords another instance; it is very interesting\r\nbecause a twisted race is available, which may produce thousands of\r\ninstances developed in all imaginable degrees, in a single lot of\r\nplants. _Viscaria oculata_ is another instance belonging to the same\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe bedstraw (_Galium_) also includes many species which from time to\r\ntime produce twisted stems. I have found them myself in Holland on\r\n_Galium verum_ and _G. Aparine_. Both seem [649] to be of rare\r\noccurrence, as I have not succeeded in getting any repetition by\r\nprolonged culture.\r\n\r\nSpecies, which generally bear their leaves in whorls, are also subjected\r\nto casual atavisms of this kind, as for instance the tall European\r\nhorsetail, _Equisetum Telmateja_, which occasionally bears cones on its\r\ngreen summer stems. Its whorls are changed on the twisted parts into\r\nclearly visible spirals. The ironwood or _Casuarina quadrivalvis_ is\r\nsometimes observed to produce the same anomaly on its smaller lateral\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nComing now to the discussion of the way in which the twisting is the\r\nresult of the spiral disposition of the leaves, we may consider this\r\narrangement on stems in the adult state. These at once show the spiral\r\nline and it is easy to follow this line from the base up to the apex. In\r\nthe most marked cases it continues without interruption, not rarely\r\nhowever, ending in a whorl of three leaves and a subsequent straight\r\ninternode, of which there may even be two or three. The spiral exhibits\r\nthe basal parts of the leaves, with the axillary lateral branches. The\r\ndirection of the screw is opposed to that of the twisting, and the\r\nspiral ribs are seen to cross the line of insertion of the leaves at\r\nnearly right angles. On this line the leaves are nearer [650] to one\r\nanother than would correspond to the original proportion of 5 turns for\r\n13 leaves. In fact, 10 or even 13 leaves may not rarely be counted on a\r\nsingle turn. Or the twist may become so strong locally as to change the\r\nspiral into a longitudinal line. On this line all inserted leaves extend\r\nthemselves in the same direction, resembling an extended flag.\r\n\r\nThe spiral on the stem is simply the continuation of the spiral line\r\nfrom within the rosettes of the first year. Accordingly it is seen to\r\nbecome gradually less steep at the base. For this reason it must be one\r\nand the same with this line, and in extreme youth it must have produced\r\nits leaves at the same mutual distances as this line. Transverse\r\nsections of the growing summits of the stems support this conclusion.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts we may infer that the steepness of the spiral\r\nline increases on the stem, as it is gradually changed into a screw.\r\nOriginally 5 turns were needed for 13 leaves, but this number diminishes\r\nand 4 or 3 or even 2 turns may take the same number of foliar organs,\r\nuntil the screw itself is changed into a straight line.\r\n\r\nThis change consists in an unwinding of the whole spiral, and in order\r\nto effect this the stem must become wound up in the opposite direction.\r\nThe winding of the foliar screw must [651] curve the longitudinal ribs.\r\nThe straighter and steeper the screw becomes, the more the ribs will\r\nbecome twisted. That this happens in the opposite direction is obvious,\r\nwithout further discussion. The twisting is the inevitable consequence\r\nof the reversal of the screw.\r\n\r\nTwo points remain to be dealt with. One is the direct proof of the\r\nreversal of the screw, the other the discussion of its cause. The first\r\nmay be observed by a simple experiment. Of course it proceeds only\r\nslowly, but all that is necessary is to mark the position of one of the\r\nyounger leaves of a growing stem of a twisting individual and to observe\r\nthe change in its position in a few hours. It will be seen to have\r\nturned some way around the stem, and finally may be seen to make a\r\ncomplete revolution in the direction opposite to the screw, and thereby\r\ndemonstrating the fact of its uncurling.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this phenomenon is to be sought in the intimate connection\r\nof the basal parts of the leaves, which we have detailed above. The\r\nfibrovascular strands constitute a strong rope, which is twisted around\r\nthe stem along the line on which the leaves are inserted. The\r\nstrengthening of the internodes may stretch this rope to some extent,\r\nbut it is too strong to be rent asunder. Hence it opposes the normal\r\ngrowth, and the only manner in which the internodes [652] may adjust\r\nthemselves to the forces which tend to cause their expansion is by\r\nstraightening the rope. In doing so they may find the required space, by\r\ngrowing out in an unusual direction, bending their axes and twisting the\r\nribs.\r\n\r\nTo prove the validity of this explanation, a simple experiment may be\r\ngiven. If the fibrovascular rope is the mechanical impediment which\r\nhinders the normal growth, we may try the effect of cutting through this\r\nrope. By this means the hindrance may at least locally be removed. Now,\r\nof course, the operation must be made in an early stage before, or at\r\nthe beginning of the period of growth, in every case before the\r\nuncurling of the rope begins. Wounds made at this time are apt to give\r\nrise to malformations, but notwithstanding this difficulty I have\r\nsucceeded in giving the necessary proof. Stems operated upon become\r\nstraight where the rope is cut through, though above and under the\r\nwounded part they go on twisting in the usual way.\r\n\r\nSometimes the plants themselves succeed in tearing the rope asunder, and\r\nlong straight internodes divide the twisted stems in two or more parts\r\nin a very striking manner. A line of torn leaf-bases connects the two\r\nparts of the screw and gives testimony of what has passed within [653]\r\nthe tissues. At other times the straightening may have taken place\r\ndirectly internal to a leaf, and it is torn and may be seen to be\r\nattached to the stem by two distinct bases.\r\n\r\nSumming up this description of the hereditary qualities of our twisted\r\nteasels and of their mechanical consequences, we may say that the loss\r\nof the normal decussation is the cause of all the observed changes. This\r\nspecial adaptation, which places the leaves in alternating pairs,\r\nreplaced and concealed the old and universal arrangement on a screw\r\nline. In disappearing, it leaves the latter free, and according to the\r\nrule of systematic atavism, this now becomes active and takes its place.\r\nIf the fibrovascular connection of the leaf-bases were lost at the same\r\ntime the stems would grow and become straight and tall. This change\r\nhowever, does not occur, and the bases of the leaves now constitute a\r\ncontinuous rope instead of separate rings, and thereby impede the\r\nstretching of the internodes. These in their turn avoid the difficulty\r\nby twisting themselves in a direction opposite to that of the spiral of\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nAs a last example of systematic atavism I will refer to the reversionary\r\nchanges, afforded by the tomatoes. Though the culture of this plant is a\r\nrecent one, it seems to be at present in a state of mutability,\r\nproducing new strains, or [654] assuming the features of their\r\npresumable ancestors. In his work \"The Survival of the Unlike,\" Bailey\r\nhas given a detailed description of these various types. Moreover, he\r\nhas closely studied the causes of the changes, and shown the great\r\ntendency of the tomatoes to vicinism. By far the larger part of the\r\nobserved cases of running out of varieties are caused by accidental\r\ncrosses through the agency of insects. Even improvements are not rarely\r\ndue to this cause. Besides these common and often unavoidable changes,\r\nothers of greater importance occur from time to time. Two of them\r\ndeserve to be mentioned. They are called the \"Upright\" and the \"Mikado\"\r\ntypes, and differ as much or even more from their parents than the\r\nlatter do from any one of their wild congeners. Their characters come\r\ntrue from seed. The \"Mikado\" race or the _Lycopersicum grandifolium_\r\n(_L. latifolium_) has larger and fewer leaflets than the slender and\r\nsomewhat flimsy foliage of the common form. Flat or plane blades with\r\ndecurrent margins constitute another character. This variety, however,\r\ndoes not concern our present discussion. The upright type has stiff and\r\nself-sustaining stems and branches, resembling rather a potato-plant\r\nthan a tomato. Hence the name _Lycopersicum solanopsis_ or _L. validum_,\r\nunder which it is usually described. [655] The foliage of the plant is\r\nso distinct as to yield botanical characters of sufficient importance to\r\njustify this specific designation. The leaflets are reduced in numbers\r\nand greatly modified, and the flowers in the inflorescence are reduced\r\nto two or three. This curious race came in suddenly, without any\r\npremonition, and the locality and date of its mutation are still on\r\nrecord. Until some years ago it had not made its appearance for a second\r\ntime. Obviously it is to be considered as a reversionary form. The limp\r\nstems of the common tomatoes are in all respects indicative of the\r\ncultivated condition. They cannot hold themselves erect, but must be\r\ntied up to supports. The color of the leaves is a paler green than\r\nshould be expected from a wild plant. Considering other species of the\r\ngenus _Solanum_, of which the _Lycopersicum_ is a subdivision, the stems\r\nare as a rule erect and self-supporting, with some few exceptions.\r\nThese, however, are special adaptations as shown by the winding stems of\r\nthe bitter-sweet.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion we seem justified in concluding that the original\r\nappearance of the upright type was of the nature of systematic atavism.\r\nIt differs however, from the already detailed cases in that it is not a\r\nmonstrosity, nor an ever-sporting race, but is as constant a form [656]\r\nas the best variety or species. Even on this ground it must be\r\nconsidered as a representative of a separate group of instances of the\r\nuniversal rule of systematic reversions.\r\n\r\nOf late the same mutation has occurred in the garden of C.A. White at\r\nWashington. The parent form in this case was the \"Acme,\" of the ordinary\r\nweak and spreading habit of growth. It is known as one of the best and\r\nmost stable of the varieties and was grown by Mr. White for many years,\r\nand had not given any sign of a tendency towards change. Seeds from some\r\nof the best plants in 1899 were sown the following spring, and the young\r\nseedlings unexpectedly exhibited a marked difference from their parents.\r\nFrom the very outset they were more strong and erect, more compact and\r\nof a darker green than the \"Acme.\" When they reached the fruiting stage\r\nthey had developed into typical representatives of the _Lycopersicum\r\nsolanopsis_ or upright division. The whole lot of plants comprised only\r\nsome 30 specimens, and this number, of course, is too small to base\r\nfar-reaching conclusions upon. But all of the lot showed this type, no\r\ntrue \"Acme\" being seen among them. The fruit differed in flavor,\r\nconsistency and color from that of the parent, and it also ripened\r\nearlier than the latter. No seed was saved from [657] these plants, but\r\nthe following year the \"Acme\" was sown again and found true to its type.\r\nSeeds saved from this generation in 1900 have, however, repeated the\r\nmutation, giving rise to exactly the same new upright form in 1901. This\r\nwas called by its originator \"The Washington.\" Seeds from this second\r\nmutation were kindly sent to me by Mr. White, and proved true to their\r\ntype when sown in my garden.\r\n\r\nObviously it is to be assumed in the case of the tomatoes as well as in\r\ninstances from other genera cited, that characters of ancestors, which\r\nare not displayed in their progeny, have not been entirely lost, but are\r\nstill present, though in a latent condition. They may resume their\r\nactivity unexpectedly, and at once develop all the features which they\r\nformerly had borne.\r\n\r\nLatency, from this point of view, must be one of the most common things\r\nin nature. All organisms are to be considered as internally formed of a\r\nhost of units, partly active and partly inactive. Extremely minute and\r\nalmost inconceivably numerous, these units must have their material\r\nrepresentatives within the most intimate parts of the cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n[658]\r\nLECTURE XXIII\r\n\r\nTAXONOMIC ANOMALIES\r\n\r\nThe theory of descent is founded mainly on comparative studies, which\r\nhave the advantage of affording a broad base and the convincing effect\r\nof concurrent evidence brought together from widely different sources.\r\nThe theory of mutation on the other hand rests directly upon\r\nexperimental investigations, and facts concerning the actual descent of\r\none form from another are as yet exceedingly rare. It is always\r\ndifficult to estimate the validity of conclusions drawn from isolated\r\ninstances selected from the whole range of contingent phenomena, and\r\nthis is especially true of the present case. Systematic and physiologic\r\nfacts seem to indicate the existence of universal laws, and it is not\r\nprobable that the process of production of new species would be\r\ndifferent in the various parts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\nMoreover the principle of unit-characters, the preeminent significance\r\nof which has come to be more fully recognized of late, is in full\r\nharmony [659] with the theory of sudden mutations. Together these two\r\nconceptions go to strengthen the probability of the sudden origin of all\r\nspecific characters.\r\n\r\nExperimental researches are limited in their extent, and the number of\r\ncases of direct observation of the process of mutation will probably\r\nnever become large enough to cover the whole field of the theory of\r\ndescent. Therefore it will always be necessary to show that the\r\nsimilarity between observed and other cases is such as to lift above all\r\ndoubt the assertion of their resulting from the same causes.\r\n\r\nBesides the direct comparison of the mutations described in our former\r\nlectures, with the analogous cases of the horticultural and natural\r\nproduction of species and varieties at large, another way is open to\r\nobtain the required proof. It is the study of the phenomena, designated\r\nby Casimir de Candolle by the name of taxonomic anomalies. It is the\r\nassertion that characters, which are specific in one case, may be\r\nobserved to arise as anomalies or as varieties in other instances. If\r\nthey can be shown to be identical or nearly so in both, it is obviously\r\nallowable to assume the same origin for the specific character and for\r\nthe anomaly. In other terms, the specific marks may be considered as\r\nhaving originated according to the laws [660] that govern the production\r\nof anomalies, and we may assume them to lie within reach of our\r\nexperiments. The experimental treatment of the origin of species may\r\nalso be looked upon as a method within our grasp.\r\n\r\nThe validity and the significance of these considerations will at once\r\nbecome clear, if we choose a definite example. The broadest and most\r\nconvincing one appears to me to be afforded by the cohesion of the\r\npetals in gamopetalous flowers. According to the current views the\r\nfamilies with the petals of their flowers united are regarded as one or\r\ntwo main branches of the whole pedigree of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nEichler and others assume them to constitute one branch, and therefore\r\none large subdivision of the system. Bessey, on the other hand, has\r\nshown the probability of a separate origin for those groups which have\r\ninferior ovaries. Apart from such divergencies the connation of the\r\npetals is universally recognized as one of the most important systematic\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nHow may this character have originated? The heath-family or the\r\nEricaceae and their nearest allies are usually considered to be the\r\nlowest of the gamopetalous plants. In them the cohesion of the petals is\r\nstill subject to reversionary exceptions. Such cases of atavism may\r\n[661] be observed either as specific marks, or in the way of anomalies.\r\n_Ledum_, _Monotropa_ and _Pyrola_, or the Labrador tea, the Indian pipe\r\nand wintergreen are instances of reversionary gamopetalism with free\r\npetals. In heaths (_Erica Tetralix_) and in rhododendrons the same\r\ndeviation is observed to occur from time to time as an anomaly, and even\r\nthe common _Rhododendron ponticum_ of our gardens has a variety in which\r\nthe corolla is more or less split. Sometimes it exhibits five free\r\npetals, while at other times only one or two are entirely free, the\r\nremaining four being incompletely loosened.\r\n\r\nSuch cases of atavism make it probable that the coherence of the petals\r\nhas originally arisen by the same method, but by action in the opposite\r\ndirection. The direct proof of this conclusion is afforded by a curious\r\nobservation, made by Vilmorin upon the bright and large-flowered\r\ngarden-poppy, _Papaver bracteatum_. Like all poppies it has four petals,\r\nwhich are free from one another. In the fields of Messrs. Vilmorin,\r\nwhere it is largely cultivated for its seeds, individuals occur from\r\ntime to time which are anomalous in this respect. They exhibit a\r\ntendency to produce connate petals. Their flowers become monopetalous,\r\nand the whole strain is designated by the name of _Papaver_ [662]\r\n_bracteatum monopetalum_. Henry de Vilmorin had the kindness to send me\r\nsome of these plants, and they have flowered in my garden during several\r\nyears. The anomaly is highly variable. Some flowers are quite normal,\r\nexhibiting no sign of connation; others are wholly gamopetalous, the\r\nfour petals being united from their base to the very margin of the cup\r\nformed. In consequence of the broadness of the petals however, this cup\r\nis so wide as to be very shallow.\r\n\r\nIntermediate states occur, and not infrequently. Sometimes only two or\r\nthree petals are united, or the connation does not extend the entire\r\nlength of the petals. These cases are quite analogous to the imperfect\r\nsplitting of the corolla of the rhododendron. Giving free rein to our\r\nimagination, we may for a moment assume the possibility of a new\r\nsubdivision of the vegetable kingdom, arising from Vilmorin's poppy and\r\nhaving gamopetalous flowers for its chief character. If the character\r\nbecame fixed, so as to lose its present state of variability, such a\r\ngroup of supposititious gamopetalous plants might be quite analogous to\r\nthe corresponding real gamopetalous families. Hence there can be no\r\nobjection to the view, that the heaths have arisen in an analogous\r\nmanner from their polypetalous ancestors. Other species of [663] the\r\nsame genus have also been recorded to produce gamopetalous flowers, as\r\nfor instance, _Papaver hybridum_, by Hoffmann. Poppies are not the sole\r\nexample of accidental gamopetaly. Linnaeus observed the same deviation\r\nlong ago for _Saponaria officinalis_, and since, it has been seen in\r\n_Clematis Vitalba_ by Jaeger, in _Peltaria alliacea_ by Schimper, in\r\n_Silene annulata_ by Boreau and in other instances. No doubt it is not\r\nat all of rare occurrence, and the origin of the present gamopetalous\r\nfamilies is to be considered as nothing extraordinary. It is, as a\r\nmatter of fact, remarkable that it has not taken place in more numerous\r\ninstances, and the mallows show that such opportunities have been\r\navailable at least more than once.\r\n\r\nOther instances of taxonomic anomalies are afforded by leaves. Many\r\ngenera, the species of which mainly bear pinnate or palmate leaves, have\r\nstray types with undivided leaves. Among the brambles, _Rubus odoratus_\r\nand _R. flexuosus_ may be cited, among the aralias, _Aralia crassifolia_\r\nand _A. papyrifera_, and among the jasmines, the deliciously scented\r\nsambac (_Jasminum Sambac_). But the most curious instance is that of the\r\ntelegraph-plant, or _Desmodium gyrans_, each complete leaf of which\r\nconsists of a large terminal leaflet and two little lateral ones. These\r\nlatter keep up, [664] night and day, an irregular jerking movement,\r\nwhich has been compared to the movements of a semaphore. _Desmodium_ is\r\na papilionaceous plant and closely allied to the genus _Hedysarum_,\r\nwhich has pinnate leaves with numerous pairs of leaflets. Its place in\r\nthe system leaves no doubt concerning its origin from pinnate-leaved\r\nancestors. At the time of its origination its leaves must have become\r\nreduced as to the number of the blades, while the size of the terminal\r\nleaflet was correspondingly increased.\r\n\r\nIt might seem difficult to imagine this great change taking place\r\nsuddenly. However, we are compelled to familiarize ourselves with such\r\nhypothetical assumptions. Strange as they may seem to those who are\r\naccustomed to the conception of continuous slow improvements, they are\r\nnevertheless in complete agreement with what really occurs. Fortunately\r\nthe direct proof of this assertion can be given, and in a case which is\r\nnarrowly related, and quite parallel to that of the _Desmodium_, since\r\nit affects a plant of the same family. It is the case of the\r\nmonophyllous variety of the bastard-acacia or _Robinia Pseud-Acacia_. In\r\na previous lecture we have seen that it originated suddenly in a French\r\nnursery in the year 1855. It can be propagated by seed, and exhibits a\r\ncurious degree [665] of variability of its leaves. In some instances\r\nthese are one-bladed, the blade reaching a length of 15 cm., and hardly\r\nresembling those of the common bastard-acacia. Other leaves produce one\r\nor two small leaflets at the base of the large terminal one, and by this\r\ncontrivance are seen to be very similar to those of the _Desmodium_,\r\nrepeating its chief characters nearly exactly, and only differing\r\nsomewhat in the relative size of the various parts. Lastly real\r\nintermediates are seen between the monophyllous and the pinnate types.\r\nAs far as I have been able to ascertain, these are produced on weak\r\ntwigs under unfavorable conditions; the size of the terminal leaflet\r\ndecreases and the number of the lateral blades increases, showing\r\nthereby the presence of the original pinnate type in a latent condition.\r\n\r\nThe sudden origin of this \"one-leaved\" acacia in a nursery may be taken\r\nas a prototype of the ancient origin of _Desmodium_. Of course the\r\ncomparison only relates to a single character, and the movements of the\r\nleaflets are not affected by it. But the monophylly, or rather the size\r\nof the terminal blade and the reduction of the lateral ones, may be held\r\nto be sufficiently illustrated by the bastard-acacia. It is worth while\r\nto state, that analogous varieties have also arisen in other genera. The\r\n\"one-leaved\" [666] strawberry has already been referred to. It\r\noriginated from the ordinary type in Norway and at Paris. The walnut\r\nlikewise, has its monophyllous variety. It was mentioned for the first\r\ntime as a cultivated tree about 1864, but its origin is unknown. A\r\nsimilar variety of the walnut, with \"one-bladed\" leaves but of varying\r\nshapes, was found wild in a forest near Dieppe in France some years ago,\r\nand appeared to be due to a sudden mutation.\r\n\r\nSomething more is known concerning the \"one-bladed\" ashes, varieties of\r\nwhich are often seen in our parks and gardens. The common form has broad\r\nand deeply serrate leaves, which are far more rounded than the leaflets\r\nof the ordinary ash. The majority of the leaves are simple, but some\r\nproduce one or two smaller leaflets at their base, closely corresponding\r\nin this respect to the variations of the \"one-bladed\" bastard-acacia,\r\nand evidently indicating the same latent and atavistic character. In\r\nsome instances this analogy goes still further, and incompletely pinnate\r\nleaves are produced with two or more pairs of leaflets. Besides this\r\nvariable type another has been described by Willdenow. It has single\r\nleaves exclusively, never producing smaller lateral leaflets, and it is\r\nsaid to be absolutely constant from seed, while the more variable types\r\n[667] seem to be also more inconstant when propagated sexually. The\r\ndifference is so striking and affords such a reliable feature that Koch\r\nproposed to make two distinct varieties of them, calling the pure type\r\n_Fraxinus excelsior monophylla_, and the varying trees _F. excelsior\r\nexheterophylla_. Some writers, and among them Willdenow, have preferred\r\nto separate the \"one-leaved\" forms from the species, and to call them\r\n_Fraxinus simplicifolia_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Smith and to Loudon, the \"one-leaved\" ashes are found wild\r\nin different districts in-England. Intermediate forms have not been\r\nrecorded from these localities. This mode of origin is that already\r\ndetailed for the laciniate varieties of alders and so many other trees.\r\nHence it may be assumed that the \"one-leaved\" ashes have sprung suddenly\r\nbut frequently from the original pinnate species. The pure type of\r\nWilldenow should, in this case, be considered as due to a slightly\r\ndifferent mutation, perhaps as a pure retrograde variety, while the\r\nvarying strains may only be eversporting forms. This would likewise\r\nexplain part of their observed inconstancy.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the historic dates, as collected by Korshinsky, are not\r\nvery convincing. Vicinism has of course, almost never been excluded, and\r\npart of the multiformity of the offspring [668] must obviously be due to\r\nthis most universal agency. Indirect vicinism also plays some part, and\r\nprobably affords the explanation of some reputed mutative productions of\r\nthe variety. So, for instance, in the case of Sinning, who after sowing\r\nthe seeds of the common ash, got as large a proportion as 2% of\r\nmonophyllous trees in a culture of some thousand plants. It is probable\r\nthat his seeds were taken partly from normal plants, and partly from\r\nhybrids between the normal and the \"one-bladed\" type, assuming that\r\nthese hybrids have pinnate leaves like their specific parent, and bear\r\nthe characters of the other parent only in a latent condition.\r\n\r\nOur third example relates to peltate leaves. They have the stalk\r\ninserted in the middle of the blade, a contrivance produced by the\r\nconnation of the two basal lobes. The water-lilies are a well known\r\ninstance, exhibiting sagittate leaves in the juvenile stage and changing\r\nin many species, into nearly circular peltate forms, of which _Victoria\r\nregia_ is a very good example, although its younger stages do not always\r\nexcite all the interest they deserve. The Indian cress (_Tropaeolum_),\r\nthe marsh pennywort or _Hydrocotyle_, and many other instances could be\r\nquoted. Sometimes the peltate leaves are not at all orbicular, but are\r\nelongated, oblong or elliptic, and with only the lobes [669] at the base\r\nunited. The lemon-scented _Eucalyptus citriodora_ is one of the most\r\nwidely known cases. In other instances the peltate leaves become more or\r\nless hollow, constituting broad ascidia as in the case of the\r\ncrassulaceous genus _Umbilicus_.\r\n\r\nThis connation of the basal lobes is universally considered as a good\r\nand normal specific character. Nevertheless it has its manifest analogy\r\nin the realm of the anomalies. This is the pitcher or ascidium. On some\r\ntrees it is of quite common occurrence, as on the lime-tree (_Tilia\r\nparvifolia_) and the magnolia (_Magnolia obovata_ and its hybrids). It\r\nis probable that both these forms have varieties with, and others\r\nwithout, ascidia. Of the lime-tree, instances are known of single trees\r\nwhich produce hundreds of such anomalous leaves yearly, and one such a\r\ntree is growing in the neighborhood of Amsterdam at Lage Vuursche. I\r\nhave alluded to these cases more than once, but on this occasion a\r\ncloser inspection of the structure of the ascidium is required. For this\r\npurpose we may take the lime-tree as an example. Take the shape of the\r\nnormal leaves in the first place. These are cordate at their base and\r\nmainly inequilateral, but the general shape varies to a considerable\r\nextent. This variation is closely related to the position of the leaves\r\non the twigs, and shows [670] distinct indications of complying with the\r\ngeneral law of periodicity. The first leaves are smaller, with more\r\nrounded lobes, the subsequent leaves attain a larger size, and their\r\nlobes slightly change their forms. In the first leaves the lobes are so\r\nbroad as to touch one another along a large part of their margins, but\r\nin organs formed later this contact gradually diminishes and the typical\r\nleaves have the lobes widely separated. Now it is easily understood that\r\nthe contact or the separation of the lobes must play a part in the\r\nconstruction of the ascidia, as soon as the margins grow together.\r\nLeaves which touch one-another, may be affected by the connation without\r\nany further malformation. They remain flat, become peltate and exhibit a\r\nshape which in some way holds a middle position between the pennyworts\r\nand the lemon-scented eucalyptus. Here we have the repetition of the\r\nspecific characters of these plants by the anomaly of another. Whenever\r\nthe margins are not in contact, and become connate, notwithstanding\r\ntheir separation, the blade must be folded together in some slight\r\ndegree, in order to produce the required contact. This is the origin of\r\nthe ascidium. It is quite superfluous to insist upon the fact that their\r\nwidth or narrowness must depend upon the corresponding normal form. The\r\nmore distant the [671] lobes, the deeper the ascidium will become. It\r\nshould be added that this explanation of the different shapes of ascidia\r\nis of general validity.\r\n\r\nAscidia of the snake-plantain or _Plantago lanceolata_ are narrow tubes,\r\nbecause the leaves are oblong or lanceolate, while those of the broad\r\nleaved species of arrowhead, as for instance, the _Sagittaria japonica_,\r\nare of a conical shape.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence of the lime-tree we may conclude that normal peltate\r\nleaves may have originated in the same way. And from the fact that\r\npitchers are one of the most frequent anomalies, we may conclude that\r\nthe chance of producing peltate leaves must have been a very great one,\r\nand wholly sufficient to account for all observed cases. In every\r\ninstance the previously existing shape of the leaf must have decided\r\nwhether peltate or pitcher-like leaves would be formed. As far as we can\r\njudge peltate anomalies are quite uninjurious, while ascidia are forms\r\nwhich must impede the effect of the light on the leaf, as they conceal\r\nquite an important part of the upper surface. In this way it is easily\r\nconceivable that peltate leaves are a frequent specific character, while\r\nascidia are not, as they only appear in the special cases of limited\r\nadaptation, as in the instances of the so called pitcher-plants. The\r\ngenera _Nepenthes_, [672] _Sarracenia_ and some others are very well\r\nknown and perhaps even the bladderworts or _Utricularia_ might be\r\nincluded here.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of specific characters by anomalous ascidia is not at\r\nall limited to the general case as described above. More minute details\r\nmay be seen to be duplicated in the same way. Proofs are afforded on one\r\nside by incomplete ascidia, and on the other by the double cups.\r\n\r\nIncomplete ascidia are those of the _Nepenthes_. The leaf is divided\r\ninto three parts, a blade, a tendril and the pitcher. Or in other words,\r\nthe limb produces a tendril at its summit, by means of which the plant\r\nis enabled to fasten itself to surrounding shrubs and to climb between\r\ntheir branches. But the end of this tendril bears a well-formed urn,\r\nwhich however, is produced only after the revolving and grasping\r\nmovements of the tendril have been made. Some species have more rounded\r\nand some more elongated ascidia and often the shape is seen to change\r\nwith the development of the stem. The mouth of the urn is strengthened\r\nby a thick rim and covered with a lid. Numerous curious contrivances in\r\nthese structures to catch ants and other insects have been described,\r\nbut as they have no relation to our present discussion, we shall abstain\r\nfrom dealing with them. [673] Likewise we must refrain from a\r\nconsideration of the physiologic qualities of the tendril, and confine\r\nour attention to the combination of a limb, a naked midvein and an\r\nascidium. This combination is to be the basis of our discussion. It is\r\nliable to be produced all of a sudden. This assertion is proved by its\r\noccurrence as a varietal mark in one of our most ordinary cultivated\r\nplants. It is the group known as _Croton_, belonging to the genus\r\n_Codiaeum_. A variety is called _interruptum_ and another\r\n_appendiculatum_, and these names both relate to the interruption of the\r\nleaves by a naked midvein. The leaves are seen to be built up of three\r\nparts. The lower half retains the aspect of a limb; it is crowned by a\r\nvein without lateral nerves or blade-like expansions, and this stalk in\r\nits turn bears a short limb on its summit. The base of this apical limb\r\nexhibits two connate lobes, forming together a wide cup or ascidium. It\r\nshould be stated that these _interruptum_ varieties are highly variable,\r\nespecially in the relative size of the three principal parts of the\r\nleaf. Though it is of course conceded that the ascidium of _Nepenthes_\r\nhas many secondary devices which are lacking in _Croton_, it seems\r\nhardly allowable to deny the possibility of an analogous origin for\r\nboth. Those of the _Croton_, according to our knowledge regarding\r\nsimilar cases, must [674] have arisen at once, and hence the conclusion\r\nthat the ascidia of _Nepenthes_ are also originally due to a sudden\r\nmutation. Interrupted leaves, with an ascidium on a naked prolongation\r\nof the midvein, are by no means limited to the _Croton_ varieties. As\r\nstray anomalies they have often been observed, and I myself had the\r\nopportunity of collecting them on magnolia, on clover and on some other\r\nspecies. They are additional evidence in support of the explanation\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nIn the same way double ascidia may be made use of to explain the foliar\r\ncups of the teasels and some other plants, as for instance, some\r\nEuropean snakeroots (_Eryngium maritimum_ and _E. campestre_), or the\r\nfloral leaves of the honeysuckle. The leaves on the stems of the teasels\r\nare disposed in pairs, and the bases of the two leaves of each pair are\r\nconnate so as to constitute large cups. We have already mentioned these\r\ncups, and recall them in the present connection to use them as a\r\nprototype of the double ascidia. These are constituted of two opposite\r\nleaves, accidentally connated at their base or along some part of their\r\nmargins. If the leaves are sessile, the analogy with the teasels is\r\ncomplete, as shown, for instance, in a case of _Cotyledon_, a\r\ncrassulaceous plant which is [675] known to produce such cups from time\r\nto time. They are narrower than those of the teasel, but this depends,\r\nas we have seen for the \"one-leaved\" ascidium, on the shape of the\r\noriginal leaf. In other respects they exactly imitate the teasel cups\r\nshowing thereby how these cups may probably have originated.\r\n\r\nIn numerous cases of anomalies some accidental structures are parallel\r\nto specific characters, while others are not, being obviously injurious\r\nto their bearers. So it is also with the double ascidia. In the case of\r\nstalked leaves the two opposite stalks must, of course, constitute a\r\nlong and very narrow tube, when growing together. This tube must bear at\r\nits summit the conical ascidium produced by the two connate limbs. At\r\nits base however, it includes the terminal bud of the stem, and\r\nfrequently the tube is so narrow as to impede its further development.\r\nBy this contrivance the double ascidium assumes a terminal position.\r\nInstances have been observed on magnolia, in _Boehmeria_ and in other\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nFlowers on leaves are of rare occurrence. Notwithstanding this, they\r\nconstitute specific characters in some instances, accidental anomalies\r\nin others. _Helwingia rusciflora flora_ is the most curious and best\r\nknown instance. It is a little shrub, belonging to the Cornaceae, and\r\n[676] has broad elliptical undivided leaves. On the middle of the\r\nmidvein these leaves are seen to bear small clusters of flowers; indeed\r\nthis is the only place where flowers are produced. Each cluster has from\r\n13-15 flowers, of which some are staminate and borne on stalks, while\r\nothers are pistillate and nearly sessile. These flowers are small and of\r\na pale greenish color and yield small stone-fruits, with a thin coating\r\nof pulpy tissue. As the name indicates, this mode of flowering is\r\nclosely similar to that of _Ruscus_, which however, does not bear its\r\nflowers and berries on real leaves, but on leaflike expansions of the\r\ntwigs. _Phyllonoma ruscifolia_, a saxifragaceous plant, bears the same\r\nspecific name, indicating a similar origin of the flowers. Other\r\ninstances have been collected by Casimir de Candolle, but their number\r\nis very small.\r\n\r\nAs a varietal mark, flowers on leaves likewise rarely occur. One\r\ninstance however, is very remarkable, and we have already dealt with it,\r\nwhen treating of constant varieties, and of the lack of vicinism in the\r\ncase of species with exclusive self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nIt is the \"Nepaul-barley\" or _Hordeum trifurcatum_. The leaves, which in\r\nthis case bear the adventitious flowers, are the inner scales of the\r\nspikelets, and not on green leaves as in the [677] cases already alluded\r\nto. But this of course makes no real difference. The character is\r\nvariable to a high degree, and this fact indicates its varietal nature,\r\nthough it should be recalled that at least with the _Helwingia_, the\r\nmajority of the leaves are destitute of flowers, and that in this way\r\nsome degree of variability is present in this normal case too.\r\n\r\nAll in all there are three sorts of \"Nepaul-barley.\" They have the same\r\nvarietal mark, but belong to different species of barley. These are\r\ndifferentiated according to the number of the rows in which the grains\r\nare seen on the spikes. These numbers may be two, four or six, giving\r\nrise to the specific names of _Hordeum distichum_, _tetrastichum_ and\r\n_hexastichum_. Whether these three varieties are of independent, but\r\nparallel origin, or are to be considered as due to a single mutation and\r\nsubsequent crosses is not known, all of them being of ancient origin.\r\nHistoric evidence concerning their birth is wholly wanting. From analogy\r\nit would seem probable that the character had arisen by a mutation in\r\none of the three named species, and had been transferred to others by\r\nmeans of accidental crosses, even as it has been artificially\r\ntransmitted of late to quite a number of other sorts. But however\r\nadmissible this conception may seem, there is of course no real\r\nobjection [678] to the assumption of independent and parallel mutations.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of a comparison with the _Helwingia_ type we are\r\nhowever, not at all concerned with the species to which the\r\n_trifurcatum_ variety belongs, but only with the varietal mark itself.\r\nThe spikelets may be one-, two- or three-flowered, according to the\r\nspecies. If we choose for further consideration the _hexastichum_ type,\r\neach spikelet produces three normal flowers and afterwards three normal\r\ngrains. Morphologically however, the spikelet is not homologous to those\r\nparts of other grasses which have the same name. It is constituted of\r\nthree real spikelets, and thus deserves the name of a triple\r\nconstruction. Each of these three little organs has its normal pair of\r\nouter scales or glumae. These are linear and short, ending in a long and\r\nnarrow spine. Those of the middle-most spikelets stand on its outer\r\nside, while those of the lateral part are placed transversely. In this\r\nway they form a kind of involucre around the central parts. The latter\r\nconsist of the inner and outer palets or scales, each two of which\r\ninclude one of the flowers. The outer palet is to be considered as the\r\nmetamorphosed leaf, in the aril of which the flower is produced. In the\r\ncommon sorts of barley it bears a long awn, giving thereby its typical\r\naspect to the [679] whole spike. The axillary flower is protected on the\r\nopposite side by a two-keeled inner palet. Each flower exhibits three\r\nstamens and an ovary. In the six-rowed barley all the three flowers of a\r\ntriple spikelet are fertile, and each of them has a long awn on the top\r\nof the outer palet. But in the two-rowed species only the middle-most\r\nflower is normal and has an awn, the two remaining being sterile and\r\nmore or less rudimentary and with only very short awns. From this\r\ndescription it is easily seen that the species of barley may be\r\ndistinguished from one another, even at a casual glance, by the number\r\nof the rows of the awns, and therefore by the shape of the entire\r\nspikes. This striking feature, however, does not exist in the\r\n\"Nepaul-barley.\" The awns are replaced by curiously shaped appendices,\r\nwhich are three-lobed. The central lobe is oblong and hollow, and forms\r\na kind of hood, which covers a small supernumerary floret. The two\r\nlateral lobes are narrower, often linear and extended into a smaller or\r\nlonger awn. These awns are mostly turned away from the center of the\r\nspike. The central lobe may sometimes bear two small florets, but\r\nordinarily only one is to be found, and this is often incomplete, having\r\nonly one or two stamens, or is different in some other way. [680] These\r\nnarrow lateral lobes heighten the abnormal aspect of the whole spike.\r\n\r\nThey are only produced at a somewhat advanced stage of the development\r\nof the palet, are united to one another and to the central part by\r\nstrong veins, which form transversal anastomoses at their insertion. The\r\nlength of these awns is very variable, and this quality is perhaps the\r\nmost striking of the whole variety. Often they reach only 1-2 mm., or\r\nthe majority may become longer and attain even 1 cm., while here and\r\nthere, between them, longer ones are inserted, extending in some\r\ninstances even as far as 3 cm. from the spike. Their transverse position\r\nin such cases is strikingly contrasted with the ordinary erect type of\r\nthe awns.\r\n\r\nThese lateral lobes are to be regarded, from the morphologic point of\r\nview, as differentiated parts of the blade of the leaf. Before they are\r\nformed, or coincidently with the beginning of their development, the\r\nsummit of the central lobe becomes hollow, and the development of the\r\nsupernumerary flower commences. In different varieties, and especially\r\nin the most recent crosses of them, this development is excessively\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nThe accidental flower arises at some distance beneath the summit of the\r\nscale, on its middle [681] vein. The development begins with the\r\nprotrusion of a little scale, and the flower itself is situated beneath\r\nthis scale, and is to be protected by it and by the primary scale, but\r\nis turned upside down at the same time. Opposite to this organ, which\r\nrepresents the outer palet of the adventitious flower, two little\r\nswollen bodies are evolved. In the normal flowers of barley and other\r\ngrains and grasses their function is to open the flowers by swelling,\r\nand afterwards collapse and allow them to close.\r\n\r\nIn the adventitious flowers of the \"Nepaul-barley,\" however, this\r\nfunction is quite superfluous. The stamens occur in varying numbers;\r\ntypically there are three, but not rarely less, or more, are seen. In\r\nsome instances the complete double whorl of six, corresponding to the\r\nancestral monocotyledonous type, has been found. This is a very curious\r\ncase of systematic atavism, quite analogous to the _Iris pallida\r\nabavia_, previously alluded to, which likewise has six stamens, and to\r\nthe cases given in a previous lecture. But for our present discussion it\r\nis of no further interest. The ovary is situated in the middle of the\r\nflower, and in some instances two have been observed. This is also to be\r\nconsidered as a case of atavism.\r\n\r\nAll these parts of the adventitious flower are more or less subject to\r\narrest of development, [682] in a later stage. They may even sometimes\r\nbecome abnormal. Stamens may unite into pairs, or carpels bear four\r\nstigmas. The pollen-sacs are as a rule barren, the mother-cells\r\nundergoing atrophy, while normal grains are seen but rarely. Likewise\r\nthe ovaries are rudimentary, but Wittmack has observed the occasional\r\nproduction of ripe grains from these abnormal florets.\r\n\r\nThe scale is seldom seen to extend any farther upwards than the\r\nsupernumerary flower. But in the rare instances where it does prolong\r\nits growth, it may repeat the abnormality and bear a second floret above\r\nthe first. This of course is generally much weaker, and more\r\nrudimentary.\r\n\r\nRaciborsky, who has lately given a full and very accurate description of\r\nthis anomaly, lays great stress upon the fact that it is quite useless.\r\nIt is perhaps the most obviously useless structure in the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom. Notwithstanding this, it has come to be as completely\r\nhereditary as any of the most beautiful adaptations in nature. Therefore\r\nit is one of the most serious objections to the hypothesis of slow and\r\ngradual improvements on the sole ground of their usefulness. The\r\nstruggle for life and natural selection are manifestly inadequate to\r\ngive even the slightest indication of [683] an explanation of this case.\r\nIt is simply impossible to imagine the causes that might have produced\r\nsuch a character. The only way out of this difficulty is to assume that\r\nit has arisen at once, in its present apparently differentiated and very\r\nvariable condition, and that, being quite uninjurious and since it does\r\nnot decrease the fertility of the race, it has never been subjected to\r\nnatural selection, and so has saved itself from destruction.\r\n\r\nBut if we once grant the probability of the origin of the\r\n\"Nepaul-barley\" by a sudden mutation, we obviously must assume the same\r\nin the case of the _Helwingia_ and other normal instances. In this way\r\nwe gain a further support for our assertion, that even the strangest\r\nspecific characters may have arisen suddenly.\r\n\r\nAfter having detailed at some length those proofs which seem to be the\r\nmost striking, and which had not been previously described with\r\nsufficient detail, we may now take a hasty survey of other contingent\r\ncases. In the first place the cruciate flowers of some onagraceous\r\nplants should be remembered. Small linear petals occur as a specific\r\ncharacter in _Oenothera cruciata_ of the Adirondacks, but have been seen\r\nto arise as sudden mutations in the common evening-primrose (_O.\r\nbiennis_) in Holland, and in the willow-herb (_Epilobium hirsutum_) in\r\nEngland. [684] Leaves placed in whorls of three are very rare. The\r\noleander, juniper and some few other plants have ternate whorls as a\r\nspecific character. As an anomaly, ternate whorls are far more common,\r\nand perhaps any plant with opposite leaves may from time to time produce\r\nthem. Races rich in this abnormality are found in the wild state in the\r\nyellow loosestrife or _Lysimachia vulgaris_, in which it is a very\r\nvariable specific character, the whorls varying from two to four leaves.\r\nIn the cultivated state it is met with in the myrtle or _Myrtus\r\ncommunis_, where it has come to be of some importance in Israelitic\r\nritual. Crisped leaves are known in a mallow, _Malva crispa_, and as a\r\nvariety in cabbages, parsley, lettuce and others. The orbicular fruits\r\nof Heeger's shepherd's purse (_Capsella heegeri_) recall similar fruits\r\nof other cruciferous genera, as for instance, _Camelina_. Screw-like\r\nstems with wide spirals are specific in the flower-stalks of _Cyclamen_\r\nand _Vallisneria_, varietal in _Juncus effusus spiralis_ and accidental\r\nin _Scirpus lacustris_. Dormant buds or small bulbs in inflorescences\r\nare normal for wild onions, _Polygonum viviparum_ and others, varietal\r\nin _Poa alpina vivipara_ and perhaps in _Agave vivipara_, and accidental\r\nin plantains (_Plantago lanceolata_), _Saxifraga umbrosa_ and others.\r\n[685] Cleft leaves, one of the most general anomalies, are typical in\r\n_Boehmeria biloba_. The adnation of the peduncles of the inflorescences\r\nto the stem is typical in _Solanum_ and accidental in many other cases.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite superfluous to add further proof. It is a very general\r\nphenomenon that specific characters occur in other genera as anomalies,\r\nand under such circumstances that the idea of a slow evolution on the\r\nground of utility is absolutely excluded. No other explanation remains\r\nthan that of a sudden mutation, and once granted for the abnormal cases,\r\nthis explanation must obviously likewise be granted for the analogous\r\nspecific characters.\r\n\r\nOur whole discussion shows that mutations, once observed in definite\r\ninstances, afford the most probable basis for the explanation of\r\nspecific characters at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n[686]\r\nLECTURE XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE HYPOTHESIS OF PERIODIC MUTATIONS\r\n\r\nThe prevailing belief that slow and gradual, nearly invisible changes\r\nconstitute the process of evolution in the animal and vegetable kingdom,\r\ndid not offer a strong stimulus for experimental research. No\r\nappreciable response to any external agency was of course to be\r\nexpected. Responses were supposed to be produced, but the corresponding\r\noutward changes would be too small to betray themselves to the\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\nThe direct observation of the mutations of the evening-primrose has\r\nchanged the whole aspect of the problem at once. It is no longer a\r\nmatter dealing with purely hypothetical conditions. Instead of the vague\r\nnotions, uncertain hopes, and a priori conceptions, that have hitherto\r\nconfused the investigator, methods of observation have been formulated,\r\nsuitable for the attainment of definite results, the general nature of\r\nwhich is already known.\r\n\r\nTo my mind the real value of the discovery [687] of the mutability of\r\nthe evening-primrose lies in its usefulness as a guide for further work.\r\nThe view that it might be an isolated case, lying outside of the usual\r\nprocedure of nature, can hardly be sustained. On such a supposition it\r\nwould be far too rare to be disclosed by the investigation of a small\r\nnumber of plants from a limited area. Its appearance within the limited\r\nfield of inquiry of a single man would have been almost a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe assumption seems justified that analogous cases will be met with,\r\nperhaps even in larger numbers, when similar methods of observation are\r\nused in the investigation of plants of other regions. The mutable\r\ncondition may not be predicated of the evening-primroses alone. It must\r\nbe a universal phenomenon, although affecting a small proportion of the\r\ninhabitants of any region at one time: perhaps not more than one in a\r\nhundred species, or perhaps not more than one in a thousand, or even\r\nfewer may be expected to exhibit it. The exact proportion is immaterial,\r\nbecause the number of mutable instances among the many thousands of\r\nspecies in existence must be far too large for all of them to be\r\nsubmitted to close scrutiny.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above discussion that next in importance to the\r\ndiscovery of the prototype of mutation is the formulation of methods\r\n[688] for bringing additional instances to light. These methods may\r\ndirect effort toward two different modes of investigation. We may search\r\nfor mutable plants in nature, or we may hope to induce species to become\r\nmutable by artificial methods. The first promises to yield results most\r\nquickly, but the scope of the second is much greater and it may yield\r\nresults of far more importance. Indeed, if it should once become\r\npossible to bring plants to mutate at our will and perhaps even in\r\narbitrarily chosen directions, there is no limit to the power we may\r\nfinally hope to gain over nature.\r\n\r\nWhat is to guide us in this new line of work? Is it the minute\r\ninspection of the features of the process in the case of the\r\nevening-primroses? Or are we to base our hopes and our methods on\r\nbroader conceptions of nature's laws? Is it the systematic study of\r\nspecies and varieties, and the biologic inquiry into their real\r\nhereditary units? Or is the theory of descent to be our starting-point?\r\nAre we to rest our conceptions on the experience of the breeder, or is\r\nperhaps the geologic pedigree of all organic life to open to us better\r\nprospects of success?\r\n\r\nThe answer to all such questions is a very simple one. All possibilities\r\nmust be considered, and no line of investigation ignored. For myself I\r\nhave based my field-researches and my [689] testing of native plants on\r\nthe hypothesis of unit-characters as deduced from Darwin's _Pangenesis_.\r\nThis conception led to the expectation of two different kinds of\r\nvariability, one slow and one sudden. The sudden ones known at the time\r\nwere considered as sports, and seemed limited to retrograde changes, or\r\nto cases of minor importance. The idea that sudden steps might be taken\r\nas the principal method of evolution could be derived from the\r\nhypothesis of unit characters, but the evidence might be too remote for\r\na starting point for experimental investigation.\r\n\r\nThe success of my test has given proof to the contrary. Hence the\r\nassertion that no evidence is to be considered as inadequate for the\r\npurpose under discussion. Sometime a method of discovering, or of\r\nproducing, mutable plants may be found, but until this is done, all\r\nfacts of whatever nature or direction must be made use of. A very slight\r\nindication may change forever the whole aspect of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe probabilities are now greatly in favor of our finding out the causes\r\nof evolution by a close scrutiny of what really happens in nature. A\r\npersistent study of the physiologic factors of this evolution is the\r\nchief condition of success. To this study field-observations may\r\ncontribute as well as direct experiments, [690] microscopical\r\ninvestigations as well as extended pedigree-cultures. The cooperation of\r\nmany workers is required to cover the field. Somewhere no doubt the\r\ndesired principle lies hidden, but until it is discovered, all methods\r\nmust be tried.\r\n\r\nWith this conception as the best starting point for further\r\ninvestigation, we may now make a brief survey of the other phase of the\r\nproblem. We shall try to connect our observations on the\r\nevening-primroses with the theory of descent at large.\r\n\r\nWe start with two main facts. One is the mutability of Lamarck's\r\nprimrose, and the second is the immutable condition of quite a number of\r\nother species. Among them are some of its near allies, the common and\r\nthe small flowered evening-primrose, or _Oenothera biennis_ and _O.\r\nmuricata_.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, a very important question arises in connection with\r\nthe theory of descent. Is the mutability of our evening-primroses\r\ntemporary, or is it a permanent condition? A discussion of this problem\r\nwill give us the means of reaching a definite idea as to the scope of\r\nour inquiries.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the present first. If mutability is a permanent\r\ncondition, it has of course no beginning, and moreover is not due to the\r\n[691] agency of external circumstances. Should this be granted for the\r\nevening-primrose, it would have to be predicated for other species found\r\nin a mutable state. Then, of course, it would be useless to investigate\r\nthe causes of mutability at large, and we should have to limit ourselves\r\nto the testing of large numbers of plants in order to ascertain which\r\nare mutable and which not.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, mutability is not a permanent feature, it must\r\nonce have had a beginning, and this beginning itself must have had an\r\nexternal cause. The amount of mutability and its possible directions may\r\nbe assumed to be due to internal causes. The determination of the moment\r\nat which they will become active can never be the result of internal\r\ncauses. It must be assigned to some external factor, and as soon as this\r\nis discovered the way for experimental investigation is open.\r\n\r\nIn the second place we must consider the past. On the supposition of\r\npermanency all the ancestors of the evening-primrose must have been\r\nmutable. By the alternative view mutability must have been a periodic\r\nphenomenon, producing at times new qualities, and at other times leaving\r\nthe plants unchanged during long successions of generations. The present\r\nmutable state must then have been preceded by an immutable [692]\r\ncondition, but of course thousands of mutations must have been required\r\nto produce the evening-primroses from their most remote ancestors.\r\n\r\nIf we take the species into consideration that are not mutable at\r\npresent, we may ask how we are to harmonize them with each of the two\r\ntheories proposed. If mutability is permanent, it is manifest that the\r\nwhole pedigree of the animal and vegetable kingdom is to be considered\r\nas built up of main mutable lines, and that the thousands of constant\r\nspecies can only be taken to represent lateral branches of the\r\ngenealogic tree.\r\n\r\nThese lateral branches would have lost the capacity of mutating,\r\npossessed by all their ancestors. And as the principle of the hypothesis\r\nunder discussion does not allow a resumption of this habit, they would\r\nbe doomed to eternal constancy until they finally die out. Loss of\r\nmutability, under this conception, means loss of the capacity for all\r\nfurther development. Only those lines of the main pedigree which have\r\nretained this capacity would have a future; all others would die out\r\nwithout any chance of progression.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, mutability is not permanent, but a periodic\r\ncondition, all lines of the genealogic tree must be assumed to show\r\nalternatively [693] mutating and constant species. Some lines may be\r\nmutating at the present moment; others may momentarily be constant. The\r\nmutating lines will probably sooner or later revert to the inactive\r\nstate, while the powers of development now dormant may then become\r\nawakened on other branches.\r\n\r\nThe view of permanency represents life as being surrounded with\r\nunavoidable death, the principle of periodicity, on the contrary,\r\nfollows the idea of resurrection, granting the possibility of future\r\nprogression for all living beings. At the same time it yields a more\r\nhopeful prospect for experimental inquiry.\r\n\r\nExperience must decide between the two main theories. It demonstrates\r\nthe existence of polymorphous genera, such as _Draba_ and _Viola_ and\r\nhundreds of others. They clearly indicate a previous state of\r\nmutability. Their systematic relation is exactly what would be expected,\r\nif they were the result of such a period. Perhaps mutability has not\r\nwholly ceased in them, but, might be found to survive in some of their\r\nmembers. Such very rich genera however, are not the rule, but are\r\nexceptional cases, indicating the rarity of powerful mutative changes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, species may remain in a state of constancy during\r\nlong, apparently during indefinite, ages.\r\n\r\n[694] Many facts plead in favor of the constancy of species. This\r\nprinciple has always been recognized by systematists. Temporarily the\r\ncurrent form of the theory of natural selection has assumed species to\r\nbe inconstant, ever changing and continuously being improved and adapted\r\nto the requirements of the life-conditions. The followers of the theory\r\nof descent believed that this conclusion was unavoidable, and were\r\ninduced to deny the manifest fact that species are constant entities.\r\nThe mutation theory gives a clew to the final combination of the two\r\ncontending ideas. Reducing the changeability of the species to distinct\r\nand probably short periods, it at once explains how the stability of\r\nspecies perfectly agrees with the principle of descent through\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the hypothesis of mutative periods is by no means\r\nirreconcilable with the observed facts of constancy. Such casual changes\r\ncan be proved by observations such as those upon the evening-primrose,\r\nbut it is obvious that a disproof can never be given. The principle\r\ngrants the present constancy of the vast majority of living forms, and\r\nonly claims the exceptional occurrence of definite changes.\r\n\r\nProofs of the constancy of species have been given in different ways.\r\nThe high degree of similarity of the individuals of most of our [695]\r\nspecies has never been denied. It is observed throughout extended\r\nlocalities, and during long series of years. Other proofs are afforded\r\nby those plants which have been transported to distant localities some\r\ntime since, but do not exhibit any change as a result of this migration.\r\nWidely dispersed plants remain the same throughout their range, provided\r\nthat they belong to a single elementary species. Many species have been\r\nintroduced from America into Europe and have spread rapidly and widely.\r\nThe Canadian horsetail (_Erigeron canadensis_), the evening-primrose and\r\nmany other instances could be given. They have not developed any special\r\nEuropean features after their introduction. Though exposed to other\r\nenvironmental conditions and to competition with other species, they\r\nhave not succeeded in developing a new character. Such species as proved\r\nadequate to the new environment have succeeded, while those which did\r\nnot have succumbed.\r\n\r\nMuch farther back is the separation of the species which now live both\r\nin arctic regions and on the summits of our highest mountaintops. If we\r\ncompare the alpine flora with the arctic plants, a high degree of\r\nsimilarity at once strikes us. Some forms are quite identical; others\r\nare slightly different, manifestly representing elementary species of\r\nthe same systematic [696] type. Still others are more distant or even\r\nbelong to different genera. The latter, and even the diverging, though\r\nnearly allied, elementary species, do not yield adequate evidence in any\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThey may as well have lived together in the long ages before the\r\nseparation of the now widely distant floras, or have sprung from a\r\ncommon ancestor living at that time, and subsequently have changed their\r\nhabits. After excluding these unreliable instances, a good number of\r\nspecies remain, which are quite the same in the arctic and alpine\r\nregions and on the summits of distant mountain ranges. As no\r\ntransportation over such large distances can have brought them from one\r\nlocality to the other, no other explanation is left than that they have\r\nbeen wholly constant and unchanged ever since the glacial period which\r\nseparated them. Obviously they must have been subjected to widely\r\nchanging conditions. The fact of their stability through all these\r\noutward changes is the best proof that the ordinary external conditions\r\ndo not necessarily have an influence on specific evolution. They may\r\nhave such a result in some instances, in others they obviously have not.\r\nMany arctic forms bearing the specific name of _alpinus_ justify this\r\nconclusion. _Astragalus alpinus_, _Phleum alpinum_, _Hieracium alpinum_\r\nand [697] others from the northern parts of Norway may be cited as\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThus Primula imperialis has been found in the Himalayas, and many other\r\nplants of the high mountains of Java, Ceylon and northern India are\r\nidentical forms. Some species from the Cameroons and from Abyssinia have\r\nbeen found on the mountains of Madagascar. Some peculiar Australian\r\ntypes are represented on the summit of Kini Balu in Borneo. None of\r\nthese species, of course, are found in the intervening lowlands, and the\r\nonly possible explanation of their identity is the conception of a\r\ncommon post-glacial origin, coupled with complete stability. This\r\nstability is all the more remarkable as nearly allied but slightly\r\ndivergent forms have also been reported from almost all of these\r\nlocalities. Other evidence is obtained by the comparison of ancient\r\nplants with their living representatives. The remains in tombs of\r\nancient Egypt have always afforded strong support of the views of the\r\nadherents of the theory of stability, and to my mind they still do so.\r\nThe cereals and fruits and even the flowers and leaves in the funeral\r\nwreaths of Rameses and Amen-Hotep are the same that are still now\r\ncultivated in Egypt. Nearly a hundred or more species have been\r\nidentified. Flowers of _Acacia_, leaves of _Mimusops_, [698] petals of\r\n_Nymphaea_ may be cited as instances, and they are as perfectly\r\npreserved as the best herbarium-specimens of the present time. The\r\npetals and stamens retain their original colors, displaying them as\r\nbrightly as is consistent with their dry state.\r\n\r\nPaleontologic evidence points to the same conclusion. Of course the\r\nremains are incomplete, and rarely adequate for a close comparison. The\r\nrange of fluctuating variability should be examined first, but the test\r\nof elementary species given by their constancy from seed cannot, of\r\ncourse, be applied. Apart from these difficulties, paleontologists agree\r\nin recognizing the very great age of large numbers of species. It would\r\nrequire a too close survey of geologic facts to go into details on this\r\npoint. Suffice it to say that in more recent Tertiary deposits many\r\nspecies have been identified with living forms. In the Miocene period\r\nespecially, the similarity of the types of phanerogamic plants with\r\ntheir present offspring, becomes so striking that in a large number of\r\ncases specific distinctions rest in greater part on theoretical\r\nconceptions rather than on real facts. For a long time the idea\r\nprevailed that the same species could not have existed through more than\r\none geologic period. Many distinctions founded on this belief have since\r\nhad to be abandoned. [699] Species of algae belonging to the\r\nwell-preserved group of the diatoms, are said to have remained unchanged\r\nfrom the Carboniferous period up to the present time.\r\n\r\nSumming up the results of this very hasty survey, we may assert that\r\nspecies remain unchanged for indefinite periods, while at times they are\r\nin the alternative condition. Then at once they produce new forms often\r\nin large numbers, giving rise to swarms of subspecies. All facts point\r\nto the conclusion that these periods of stability and mutability\r\nalternate more or less regularly with one another. Of course a direct\r\nproof of this view cannot, as yet, be given, but this conclusion is\r\nforced upon us by a consideration of known facts bearing on the\r\nprinciple of constancy and evolution.\r\n\r\nIf we are right in this general conception, we may ask further, what is\r\nto be the exact place of our group of new evening-primroses in this\r\ntheory? In order to give an adequate answer, we must consider the whole\r\nrange of the observations from a broader point of view. First of all it\r\nis evident that the real mutating period must be assumed to be much\r\nlonger than the time covered by my observations. Neither the beginning\r\nnor the end have been seen. It is quite obvious that _Oenothera\r\nlamarckiana_ was in a mutating condition when I first [700] saw it,\r\nseventeen years ago. How long had it been so? Had it commenced to mutate\r\nafter its introduction into Europe, some time ago, or was it already\r\npreviously in this state? It is as yet impossible to decide this point.\r\nPerhaps the mutable state is very old, and dates from the time of the\r\nfirst importation of the species into Europe.\r\n\r\nApart from all such considerations the period of the direct\r\nobservations, and the possible duration of the mutability through even\r\nmore than a century, would constitute only a moment, if compared with\r\nthe whole geologic time. Starting from this conception the pedigree of\r\nour mutations must be considered as only one small group. Instead of\r\nfiguring a fan of mutants for each year, we must condense all the\r\nsucceeding swarms into one single fan, as might be done also for _Draba\r\nverna_ and other polymorphous species. In _Oenothera_ the main stem is\r\nprolonged upwards beyond the fan; in the others the main stem is lacking\r\nor at least undiscernable, but this feature manifestly is only of\r\nsecondary importance. We might even prefer the image of a fan, adjusted\r\nlaterally to a stem, which itself is not interrupted by this branch.\r\n\r\nOn this principle two further considerations are to be discussed. First\r\nthe structure of the [701] fan itself, and secondly the combination of\r\nsucceeding fans into a common genealogic tree.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the fan as a whole includes more than is directly\r\nindicated by the facts concerning the birth of new species. They arise\r\nin considerable quantities, and each of them in large numbers of\r\nindividuals, either in the same or in succeeding years. This multiple\r\norigin must obviously have the effect of strengthening the new types,\r\nand of heightening their chances in the struggle for life. Arising in a\r\nsingle specimen they would have little chance of success, since in the\r\nfield among thousands of seeds perhaps one only survives and attains\r\ncomplete development. Thousands or at least hundreds of mutated seeds\r\nare thus required to produce one mutated individual, and then, how small\r\nare its chances of surviving! The mutations proceed in all directions,\r\nas I have pointed out in a former lecture. Some are useful, others might\r\nbecome so if the circumstances were accidentally changed in definite\r\ndirections, or if a migration from the original locality might take\r\nplace. Many others are without any real worth, or even injurious.\r\nHarmless or even slightly useless ones have been seen to maintain\r\nthemselves in the field during the seventeen years of my research, as\r\nproved by _Oenothera laevifolia_ and _Oenothera_ [702] _brevistylis_.\r\nMost of the others quickly disappear.\r\n\r\nThis failure of a large part of the productions of nature deserves to be\r\nconsidered at some length. It may be elevated to a principle, and may be\r\nmade use of to explain many difficult points of the theory of descent.\r\nIf, in order to secure one good novelty, nature must produce ten or\r\ntwenty or perhaps more bad ones at the same time, the possibility of\r\nimprovements coming by pure chance must be granted at once. All\r\nhypotheses concerning the direct causes of adaptation at once become\r\nsuperfluous, and the great principle enunciated by Darwin once more\r\nreigns supreme.\r\n\r\nIn this way too, the mutation-period of the evening-primrose is to be\r\nconsidered as a prototype. Assuming it as such provisionally, it may aid\r\nus in arranging the facts of descent so as to allow of a deeper insight\r\nand a closer scrutiny. All swarms of elementary species are the remains\r\nof far larger initial groups. All species containing only a few\r\nsubspecies may be supposed to have thrown off at the outset far more\r\nnumerous lateral branches, out of which however, the greater part have\r\nbeen lost, being unfit for the surrounding conditions. It is the\r\nprinciple of the struggle for life between elementary species, followed\r\nby the survival of the [703] fittest, the law of the selection of\r\nspecies, which we have already laid stress upon more than once.\r\n\r\nOur second consideration is also based upon the frequent repetition of\r\nthe several mutations. Obviously a common cause must prevail. The\r\nfaculty of producing _nanella_ or _lata_ remains the same through all\r\nthe years. This faculty must be one and the same for all the hundreds of\r\nmutative productions of the same form. When and how did it originate? At\r\nthe outset it must have been produced in a latent condition, and even\r\nyet it must be assumed to be continuously present in this state, and\r\nonly to become active at distant intervals. But it is manifest that the\r\noriginal production of the characters of _Oenothera gigas_ was a\r\nphenomenon of far greater importance than the subsequent accidental\r\ntransition of this quality into the active state. Hence the conclusion\r\nthat at the beginning of each series of analogous mutations there must\r\nhave been one greater and more intrinsic mutation, which opened the\r\npossibility to all its successors. This was the origination of the new\r\ncharacter itself, and it is easily seen that this incipient change is to\r\nbe considered as the real one. All others are only its visible\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nConsidering the mutative period of our evening-primrose [704] as one\r\nunit-stride section in the great genealogic tree, this period includes\r\ntwo nearly related, but not identical changes. One is the production of\r\nnew specific characters in the latent condition, and the other is the\r\nbringing of them to light and putting them into active existence. These\r\ntwo main factors are consequently to be assumed in all hypothetic\r\nconceptions of previous mutative periods.\r\n\r\nAre all mutations to be considered as limited to such periods? Of course\r\nnot. Stray mutations may occur as well. Our knowledge concerning this\r\npoint is inadequate for any definite statement. Swarms of variable\r\nspecies are easily recognized, if the remnants are not too few. But if\r\nonly one or two new species have survived, how can we tell whether they\r\nhave originated-alone or together with others. This difficulty is still\r\nmore pronounced in regard to paleontologic facts, as the remains of\r\ngeologic swarms are often found, but the absence of numerous mutations\r\ncan hardly be proved in any case.\r\n\r\nI have more than once found occasion to lay stress on the importance of\r\na distinction between progressive and retrograde mutations in previous\r\nlectures. All improvement is, of course, by the first of these modes of\r\nevolution, but apparent losses of organs or qualities are [705] perhaps\r\nof still more universal occurrence. Progression and regression are seen\r\nto go hand in hand everywhere. No large group and probably even no genus\r\nor large species has been evolved without the joint agency of these two\r\ngreat principles. In the mutation-period of the evening-primroses the\r\nobserved facts give direct support to this conclusion, since some of the\r\nnew species proved, on closer inspection, to be retrograde varieties,\r\nwhile others manifestly owe their origin to progressive steps. Such\r\nsteps may be small and in a wrong direction; notwithstanding this they\r\nmay be due to the acquisition of a wholly new character and therefore\r\nbelong to the process of progression at large.\r\n\r\nBetween them however, there is a definite contrast, which possibly is in\r\nintimate connection with the question of periodic and stray mutations.\r\nObviously each progressive change is dependent upon the production of a\r\nnew character, for whenever this is lacking, no such mutation is\r\npossible. Retrograde changes, on the other hand, do not require such\r\nelaborate preliminary work. Each character may be converted into the\r\nlatent condition, and for all we know, a special preparation for this\r\npurpose is not at all necessary. It is readily granted that such special\r\npreparation may occur, because the [706] great numbers in which our\r\ndwarf variety of the _Oenothera_ are yearly produced are suggestive of\r\nsuch a condition. On the other hand, the _laevifolia_ and _brevistylis_\r\nmutations have not been repeated, at least not in a visible way.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion we may infer that it is quite possible that a large\r\npart of the progressive changes, and a smaller part of the retrograde\r\nmutations, are combined into groups, owing their origin to common\r\nexternal agencies. The periods in which such groups occur would\r\nconstitute the mutative periods. Besides them the majority of the\r\nretrograde changes and some progressive steps might occur separately,\r\neach being due to some special cause. Degressive mutations, or those\r\nwhich arise by the return of latent qualities to activity, would of\r\ncourse belong with the latter group.\r\n\r\nThis assumption of a stray and isolated production of varieties is to a\r\nlarge degree supported by experience in horticulture. Here there are no\r\nreal swarms of mutations. Sudden leaps in variability are not rare, but\r\nthen they are due to hybridization. Apart from this mixture of\r\ncharacters, varieties as a rule appear separately, often with intervals\r\nof dozens of years, and without the least suggestion of a common cause.\r\nIt is quite superfluous to go into details, as we have dealt with the\r\nhorticultural [707] mutations at sufficient length on a previous\r\noccasion. Only the instance of the peloric toadflax might be recalled\r\nhere, because the historic and geographic evidence, combined with the\r\nresults of our pedigree-experiment, plainly show that peloric mutations\r\nare quite independent of any periodic condition. They may occur anywhere\r\nin the wide range of the toad-flax, and the capacity of repeatedly\r\nproducing them has lasted some centuries at least, and is perhaps even\r\nas old as the species itself.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside such stray mutations, we may now consider the probable\r\nconstitution of the great lines of the genealogic tree of the evening\r\nprimroses, and of the whole vegetable and animal kingdom at large. The\r\nidea of drawing up a pedigree for the chief groups of living organisms\r\nis originally due to Haeckel, who used this graphic method to support\r\nthe Darwinian theory of descent. Of course, Haeckel's genealogic trees\r\nare of a purely hypothetic nature, and have no other purpose than to\r\nconvey a clear conception of the notion of descent, and of the great\r\nlines of evolution at large. Obviously all details are subject to doubt,\r\nand many have accordingly been changed by his successors. These changes\r\nmay be considered as partial improvements, and the somewhat picturesque\r\nform of Haeckel's pedigree might well be replaced by [708] more simple\r\nplans. But the changes have by no means removed the doubts, nor have\r\nthey been able to supplant the general impression of distinct groups,\r\nunited by broad lines. This feature is very essential, and it is easily\r\nseen to correspond with the conception of swarms, as we have deduced it\r\nfrom the study of the lesser groups.\r\n\r\nGenealogic trees are the result of comparative studies; they are far\r\nremoved from the results of experimental inquiry concerning the origin\r\nof species. What are the links which bind them together? Obviously they\r\nmust be sought in the mutative periods, which have immediately preceded\r\nthe present one. In the case of the evening-primrose the systematic\r\narrangement of the allied species readily guides us in the delimitations\r\nof such periods. For manifestly the species of the large genus of\r\n_Oenothera_ are grouped in swarms, the youngest or most recent of which\r\nwe have under observation. Its immediate predecessor must have been the\r\nsubgenus _Onagra_, which is considered by some authors as consisting of\r\na single systematic species, _Oenothera biennis_. Its multifarious forms\r\npoint to a common origin, not only morphologically but also\r\nhistorically. Following this line backward or downward we reach another\r\napparent mutation-period, which includes the origin of [709] the group\r\ncalled _Oenothera_, with a large number of species of the same general\r\ntype as the _Onagra-forms, Still farther downward comes the old genus\r\n_Oenothera_ itself, with numerous subgenera diverging in sundry\r\ncharacters and directions.\r\n\r\nProceeding still farther we might easily construct a main stem with\r\nnumerous succeeding fans of lateral branches, and thus reach, from our\r\nnew empirical point of view, the theoretical conclusion already\r\nformulated.\r\n\r\nPaleontologic facts readily agree with this conception. The swarms of\r\nspecies and varieties are found to succeed one another like so many\r\nstories. The same images are repeated, and the single stories seem to be\r\nconnected by the main stems, which in each tier produce the whole number\r\nof allied forms. Only a few prevailing lines are prolonged through\r\nnumerous geologic periods; the vast majority of the lateral branches are\r\nlimited each to its own storey. It is simply the extension of the\r\npedigree of the evening-primroses backward through ages, with the same\r\nconstruction and the same leading features. There can be no doubt that\r\nwe are quite justified in assuming that evolution has followed the same\r\ngeneral laws through the whole duration of life on earth. Only a moment\r\nof their lifetime is disclosed to us, but it [710] is quite sufficient\r\nto enable us to discern the laws and to conjecture the outlines of the\r\nwhole scheme of evolution.\r\n\r\nA grave objection which has, often, and from the very outset, been urged\r\nagainst Darwin's conception of very slow and nearly imperceptible\r\nchanges, is the enormously long time required. If evolution does not\r\nproceed any faster than what we can see at present, and if the process\r\nmust be assumed to have gone on in the same slow manner always,\r\nthousands of millions of years would have been needed to develop the\r\nhigher types of animals and plants from their earliest ancestors.\r\n\r\nNow it is not at all probable that the duration of life on earth\r\nincludes such an incredibly long time. Quite on the contrary the\r\nlifetime of the earth seems to be limited to a few millions of years.\r\nThe researches of Lord Kelvin and other eminent physicists seem to leave\r\nno doubt on this point. Of course all estimates of this kind are only\r\nvague and approximate, but for our present purposes they may be\r\nconsidered as sufficiently exact.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in 1862 Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin) first\r\nendeavored to show that great limitation had to be put upon the enormous\r\ndemand for time made by Lyell, Darwin and other biologists. From a\r\nconsideration [711] of the secular cooling of the earth, as deduced from\r\nthe increasing temperature in deep mines, he concluded that the entire\r\nage of the earth must have been more than twenty and less than forty\r\nmillions of years, and probably much nearer twenty than forty. His views\r\nhave been much criticised by other physicists, but in the main they have\r\ngained an ever-increasing support in the way of evidence. New mines of\r\ngreater depth have been bored, and their temperatures have proved that\r\nthe figures of Lord Kelvin are strikingly near the truth. George Darwin\r\nhas calculated that the separation of the moon from the earth must have\r\ntaken place some fifty-six millions of years ago. Geikie has estimated\r\nthe existence of the solid crust of the earth at the most as a hundred\r\nmillion years. The first appearance of the crust must soon have been\r\nsucceeded by the formation of the seas, and a long time does not seem to\r\nhave been required to cool the seas to such a degree that life became\r\npossible. It is very probable that life originally commenced in the\r\ngreat seas, and that the forms which are now usually included in the\r\nplankton or floating-life included the very first living beings.\r\nAccording to Brooks, life must have existed in this floating condition\r\nduring long primeval epochs, and evolved nearly all the main branches of\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdom [712] before sinking to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, and later producing the vast number of diverse forms which now\r\nadorn the sea and land.\r\n\r\nAll these evolutions, however, must have been very rapid, especially at\r\nthe beginning, and together cannot have taken more time than the figures\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the larger streams, and the deposits which they bring into\r\nthe seas, afford further evidence. The amount of dissolved salts,\r\nespecially of sodium chloride, has been made the subject of a\r\ncalculation by Joly, and the amount of lime has been estimated by Eugene\r\nDubois. Joly found fifty-five and Dubois thirty-six millions of years as\r\nthe probable duration of the age of the rivers, and both figures\r\ncorrespond to the above dates as closely as might be expected from the\r\ndiscussion of evidence so very incomplete and limited.\r\n\r\nAll in all it seems evident that the duration of life does not comply\r\nwith the demands of the conception of very slow and continuous\r\nevolution. Now it is easily seen, that the idea of successive mutations\r\nis quite independent of this difficulty. Even assuming that some\r\nthousands of characters must have been acquired in order to produce the\r\nhigher animals and plants of the present time, no valid objection is\r\nraised. The demands of the biologists and the results of [713] the\r\nphysicists are harmonized on the ground of the theory of mutation.\r\n\r\nThe steps may be surmised to have never been essentially larger than in\r\nthe mutations now going on under our eyes, and some thousands of them\r\nmay be estimated as sufficient to account for the entire organization of\r\nthe higher forms. Granting between twenty and forty millions of years\r\nsince the beginning of life, the intervals between two successive\r\nmutations may have been centuries and even thousands of years. As yet\r\nthere has been no objection cited against this assumption, and hence we\r\nsee that the lack of harmony between the demands of biologists and the\r\nresults of the physicists disappears in the light of the theory of\r\nmutation.\r\n\r\nSumming up the results of this discussion, we may justifiably assert\r\nthat the conclusions derived from the observations and experiments made\r\nwith evening-primroses and other plants in the main agree satisfactorily\r\nwith the inferences drawn from paleontologic, geologic and systematic\r\nevidence. Obviously these experiments are wonderfully supported by the\r\nwhole of our knowledge concerning evolution. For this reason the laws\r\ndiscovered in the experimental garden may be considered of great\r\nimportance, and they may guide us in our further inquiries. Without\r\ndoubt many minor [714] points are in need of correction and elaboration,\r\nbut such improvements of our knowledge will gradually increase our means\r\nof discovering new instances and, new proofs.\r\n\r\nThe conception of mutation periods producing swarms of species from time\r\nto time, among which only a few have a chance of survival, promises to\r\nbecome the basis for speculative pedigree-diagrams, as well as for\r\nexperimental investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[715]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXV\r\n\r\nGENERAL LAWS OF FLUCTUATION\r\n\r\nThe principle of unit-characters and of elementary species leads at once\r\nto the recognition of two kinds of variability. The changes of wider\r\namplitude consist of the acquisition of new units, or the loss of\r\nalready existing ones. The lesser variations are due to the degree of\r\nactivity of the units themselves.\r\n\r\nFacts illustrative of these distinctions were almost wholly lacking at\r\nthe time of the first publication of Darwin's theories. It was a bold\r\nconception to point out the necessity for such distinction on purely\r\ntheoretical grounds. Of course some sports were well known and\r\nfluctuations were evident, but no exact analysis of the details was\r\npossible, a fact that was of great importance in the demonstration of\r\nthe theory of descent. The lack of more definite knowledge upon this\r\nmatter was keenly felt by Darwin, [716] and exercised much influence\r\nupon his views at various times.\r\n\r\nQuetelet's famous discovery of the law of fluctuating variability\r\nchanged the entire situation and cleared up many difficulties. While a\r\nclear conception of fluctuations was thus gained, mutations were\r\nexcluded from consideration, being considered as very rare, or\r\nnon-existent. They seemed wholly superfluous for the theory of descent,\r\nand very little importance was attached to their study. Current\r\nscientific belief in the matter has changed only in recent years.\r\nMendel's law of varietal hybrids is based upon the principle of\r\nunit-characters, and the validity of this conception has thus been\r\nbrought home to many investigators.\r\n\r\nA study of fluctuating or individual variability, as it was formerly\r\ncalled, is now carried on chiefly by mathematical methods. It is not my\r\npurpose to go into details, as it would require a separate course of\r\nlectures. I shall consider the limits between fluctuation and mutation\r\nonly, and attempt to set forth an adequate idea of the principles of the\r\nfirst as far as they touch these limits. The mathematical treatment of\r\nthe facts is no doubt of very great value, but the violent discussions\r\nnow going on between mathematicians such as Pearson, Kapteyn and others\r\nshould warn biologists to abstain [717] from the use of methods which\r\nare not necessary for the furtherance of experimental work.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Quetelet's law is a very clear and simple one, and quite\r\nsufficient for our considerations. It claims that for biologic phenomena\r\nthe deviations from the average comply with the same laws as the\r\ndeviations from the average in any other case, if ruled by chance only.\r\nThe meaning of this assertion will become clear by a further discussion\r\nof the facts. First of all, fluctuating variability is an almost\r\nuniversal phenomenon. Every organ and every quality may exhibit it. Some\r\nare very variable, while others seem quite constant. Shape and size vary\r\nalmost indefinitely, and the chemical composition is subject to the same\r\nlaw, as is well known for the amount of sugar in sugar-beets. Numbers\r\nare of course less liable to changes, but the numbers of the rays of\r\numbels, or ray-florets in the composites, of pairs of blades in pinnate\r\nleaves, and even of stamens and carpels are known to be often\r\nexceedingly variable. The smaller numbers however, are more constant,\r\nand deviations from the quinate structure of flowers are rare.\r\nComplicated structures are generally capable of only slight deviations.\r\n\r\nFrom a broad point of view, fluctuating variability [718] falls under\r\ntwo heads. They obey quite the same laws and are therefore easily\r\nconfused, but with respect to questions of heredity they should be\r\ncarefully separated. They are designated by the terms individual and\r\npartial fluctuation. Individual variability indicates the differences\r\nbetween individuals, while partial variability is limited to the\r\ndeviations shown by the parts of one organism from the average\r\nstructure. The same qualities in some cases vary individually and in\r\nothers partially. Even stature, which is as markedly individual for\r\nannual and biennial plants as it is for man, becomes partially variant\r\nin the case of perennial herbs with numbers of stems. Often a character\r\nis only developed once in the whole course of evolution, as for\r\ninstance, the degree of connation of the seed-leaves in tricotyls and in\r\nnumerous cases it is impossible to tell whether a character is\r\nindividual or partial. Consequently such minute details are generally\r\nconsidered to have no real importance for the hereditary transmission of\r\nthe character under discussion.\r\n\r\nFluctuations are observed to take place only in two directions. The\r\nquality may increase or decrease, but is not seen to vary in any other\r\nway. This rule is now widely established by numerous investigations, and\r\nis fundamental to [719] the whole method of statistical investigation.\r\nIt is equally important for the discussion of the contrast between\r\nfluctuations and mutations, and for the appreciation of their part in\r\nthe general progress of organization. Mutations are going on in all\r\ndirections, producing, if they are progressive, something quite new\r\nevery time. Fluctuations are limited to increase and decrease of what is\r\nalready available. They may produce plants with higher stems, more\r\npetals in the flowers, larger and more palatable fruits, but obviously\r\nthe first petal and the first berry, cannot have originated by the\r\nsimple increase of some older quality. Intermediates may be found, and\r\nthey may mark the limit, but the demonstration of the absence of a limit\r\nis quite another question. It would require the two extremes to be shown\r\nto belong to one unit, complying with the simple law of Quetelet.\r\n\r\nNourishment is the potent factor of fluctuating variability. Of course\r\nin thousands of cases our knowledge is not sufficient to allow us to\r\nanalyze this relation, and a number of phases of the phenomenon have\r\nbeen discovered only quite recently. But the fact itself is thoroughly\r\nmanifest, and its appreciation is as old as horticultural science.\r\nKnight, who lived at the beginning of the last century, has laid great\r\nstress upon it, and it has since influenced practice in a [720] large\r\nmeasure. Moreover, Knight pointed out more than once that it is the\r\namount of nourishment, not the quality of the various factors, that\r\nexercises the determinative influence. Nourishment is to be taken in the\r\nwidest sense of the word, including all favorable and injurious\r\nelements. Light and temperature, soil and space, water and salts are\r\nequally active, and it is the harmonious cooperation of them all that\r\nrules growth.\r\n\r\nWe treated this important question at some length, when dealing with the\r\nanomalies of the opium-poppies, consisting of the conversion of stamens\r\ninto supernumerary pistils. The dependency upon external influences\r\nwhich this change exhibited is quite the same as that shown by\r\nfluctuating variability at large. We inquired into the influence of good\r\nand bad soil, of sunlight and moisture and of other concurrent factors.\r\nEspecial emphasis was laid upon the great differences to which the\r\nvarious individuals of the same lot may be exposed, if moisture and\r\nmanure differ on different portions of the same bed in a way unavoidable\r\neven by the most careful preparation. Some seeds germinate on moist and\r\nrich spots, while their neighbors are impeded by local dryness, or by\r\ndistance from manure. Some come to light on a sunny day, and increase\r\ntheir first leaves rapidly, while on [721] the following day the weather\r\nmay be unfavorable and greatly retard growth. The individual differences\r\nseem to be due, at least in a very great measure, to such apparent\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand partial differences are often manifestly due to\r\nsimilar causes. Considering the various stems of plants, which multiply\r\nthemselves by runners or by buds on the roots, the assertion is in no\r\nneed of further proof. The same holds good for all cases of artificial\r\nmultiplication by cuttings, or by other vegetative methods. But even if\r\nwe limit ourselves to the leaves of a single tree, or the branches of a\r\nshrub, or the flowers on a plant, the same rule prevails. The\r\ndevelopment of the leaves is dependent on their position, whether\r\ninserted on strong or weak branches, exposed to more or less light, or\r\nnourished by strong or weak roots. The vigor of the axillary buds and of\r\nthe branches which they may produce is dependent upon the growth and\r\nactivity of the leaves to which the buds are axillary.\r\n\r\nThis dependency on local nutrition leads to the general law of\r\nperiodicity, which, broadly speaking, governs the occurrence of the\r\nfluctuating deviations of the organs. This law of periodicity involves\r\nthe general principle that every axis, as a rule, increases in strength\r\nwhen [722] growing, but sooner or later reaches a maximum and may\r\nafterwards decrease.\r\n\r\nThis periodic augmentation and declination is often boldly manifest,\r\nthough in other cases it may be hidden by the effect of alternate\r\ninfluences. Pinnate leaves generally have their lower blades smaller\r\nthan the upper ones, the longest being seen sometimes near the apex and\r\nsometimes at a distance from it. Branches bearing their leaves in two\r\nrows often afford quite as obvious examples, and shoots in general\r\ncomply with the same rule. Germinating plants are very easy of\r\nobservation on this point. When they are very weak they produce only\r\nsmall leaves. But their strength gradually increases and the subsequent\r\norgans reach fuller dimensions until the maximum is attained. The\r\nphenomenon is so common that its importance is usually overlooked. It\r\nshould be considered as only one instance of a rule, which holds good\r\nfor all stems and all branches, and which is everywhere dependent on the\r\nrelation of growth to nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe rule of periodicity not only affects the size of the organs, but\r\nalso their number, whenever these are largely variable. Umbellate plants\r\nhave numerous rays on the umbels of strong stems, but the number is seen\r\nto decrease and to become very small on the weakest lateral [723]\r\nbranches. The same holds good for the number of ray-florets in the\r\nflower-heads of the composites, even for the number of stigmas on the\r\novaries of the poppies, which on weak branches may be reduced to as few\r\nas three or four. Many other instances could be given.\r\n\r\nOne of the best authenticated cases is the dependency of partial\r\nfluctuation on the season and on the weather. Flowers decline when the\r\nseason comes to an end, become smaller and less brightly colored. The\r\nnumber of ray-florets in the flower-heads is seen to decrease towards\r\nthe fall. Extremes become rarer, and often the deviations from the\r\naverage seem nearly to disappear. Double flowers comply with this rule\r\nvery closely, and many other cases will easily occur to any student of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOf course, the relation to nourishment is different for individual and\r\npartial fluctuations. Concerning the first, the period of development of\r\nthe germ within the seed is decisive. Even the sexual cells may be in\r\nwidely different conditions at the moment of fusion, and perhaps this\r\nstate of the sexual cells includes the whole matter of the decision for\r\nthe average characters of the new individual. Partial fluctuation\r\ncommences as soon as the leaves and buds begin to form, and all later\r\nchanges in nutrition can only cause partial differences. All leaves,\r\n[724] buds, branches, and flowers must come under the influence of\r\nexternal conditions during the juvenile period, and so are liable to\r\nattain a development determined in part by the action of these factors.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these general considerations, we must direct our\r\nattention to the question of utility. Obviously, fluctuating variability\r\nis a very useful contrivance, in many cases at least. It appears all the\r\nmore so, as its relation to nutrition becomes manifest. Here two aspects\r\nare intimately combined. More nutrient matter produces larger leaves and\r\nthese are in their turn more fit to profit by the abundance of\r\nnourishment. So it is with the number of flowers and flower-groups, and\r\neven with the numbers of their constituent organs. Better nourishment\r\nproduces more of them, and thereby makes the plant adequate to make a\r\nfuller use of the available nutrient substances. Without fluctuation\r\nsuch an adjustment would hardly be possible, and from all our notions of\r\nusefulness in nature, we therefore must recognize the efficiency of this\r\nform of variability.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the fluctuations often strike us as quite useless or\r\neven as injurious. The numbers of stamens, or of carpels are dependent\r\non nutrition, but their fluctuation is not known to have any attraction\r\nfor the visiting insects.\r\n\r\n[725] If the deviations become greater, they might even become\r\ndetrimental. The flowers of the St. Johnswort, or _Hypericum\r\nperforatum_, usually have five petals, but the number varies from three\r\nto eight or more. Bees could hardly be misled by such deviations. The\r\ncarpels of buttercups and columbines, the cells in the capsules of\r\ncotton and many other plants are variable in number. The number of seeds\r\nis thereby regulated in accordance with the available nourishment, but\r\nwhether any other useful purpose is served, remains an open question.\r\nVariations in the honey-guides or in the pattern of color-designs might\r\neasily become injurious by deceiving insects, and such instances as the\r\ngreat variability of the spots on the corolla of some cultivated species\r\nof monkey-flowers, for instance, the _Mimulus quinquevulnerus_, could\r\nhardly be expected to occur in wild plants. For here the dark brown\r\nspots vary between nearly complete deficiency up to such predominancy as\r\nalmost to hide the pale yellow ground-color.\r\n\r\nAfter this hasty survey of the causes of fluctuating variability, we now\r\ncome to a discussion of Quetelet's law. It asserts that the deviations\r\nfrom the average obey the law of probability. They behave as if they\r\nwere dependent on chance only.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that the law of Quetelet can [726] be demonstrated the\r\nmost readily by placing a sufficient number of adult men in a row,\r\narranging them according to their size. The line passing over their\r\nheads proves to be identical with that given by the law of probability.\r\nQuite in the same way, stems and branches, leaves and petals and even\r\nfruits can be arranged, and they will in the main exhibit the same line\r\nof variability. Such groups are very striking, and at the first glance\r\nshow that the large majority of the specimens deviate from the mean only\r\nto a very small extent. Wider deviations are far more rare, and their\r\nnumber lessens, the greater the deviation, as is shown by the curvature\r\nof the line. It is almost straight and horizontal in the middle portion,\r\nwhile at the ends it rapidly declines, going sharply downward at one\r\nextreme and upward at the other.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious however, that in these groups the leaves and other organs\r\ncould conveniently be replaced by simple lines, indicating their size.\r\nThe result would be quite the same, and the lines could be placed at\r\narbitrary, but equal distances. Or the sizes could be expressed by\r\nfigures, the compliance of which with the general law could be\r\ndemonstrated by simple methods of calculation. In this manner the\r\nvariability of different organs can easily be compared. Another method\r\nof demonstration consists in [727] grouping the deviations into\r\npreviously fixed divisions. For this purpose the variations are measured\r\nby standard units, and all the instances that fall between two limits\r\nare considered to constitute one group. Seeds and small fruits, berries\r\nand many other organs may conveniently be dealt with in this way. As an\r\nexample we take ordinary beans and select them according to their size.\r\nThis can be done in different ways. On a small piece of board a long\r\nwedge-shaped slit is made, into which seeds are pushed as far as\r\npossible. The margin of the wedge is calibrated in such a manner that\r\nthe figures indicate the width of the wedge at the corresponding place.\r\nBy this device the figure up to which a bean is pushed at once shows its\r\nlength. Fractions of millimeters are neglected, and the beans, after\r\nhaving been measured, are thrown into cylindrical glasses of the same\r\nwidth, each glass receiving only beans of equal length. It is clear that\r\nby this method the height to which beans fill the glasses is\r\napproximately a measure of their number. If now the glasses are put in a\r\nrow in the proper sequence, they at once exhibit the shape of a line\r\nwhich corresponds to the law of chance. In this case however, the line\r\nis drawn in a different manner from the first. It is to be pointed out\r\nthat the glasses may be replaced by lines indicating [728] the height of\r\ntheir contents, and that, in order to reach a more easy and correct\r\nstatement, the length of the lines may simply be made proportionate to\r\nthe number of the beans in each glass. If such lines are erected on a\r\ncommon base and at equal distances, the line which unites their upper\r\nends will be the expression of the fluctuating variability of the\r\ncharacter under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe same inquiry may be made with other seeds, with fruits, or other\r\norgans. It is quite superfluous to arrange the objects themselves, and\r\nit is sufficient to arrange the figures indicating their value. In order\r\nto do this a basal line is divided into equal parts, the demarcations\r\ncorresponding to the standard-units chosen for the test. The observed\r\nvalues are then written above this line, each finding its place between\r\nthe two demarcations, which include its value. It is very interesting\r\nand stimulating to construct such a group. The first figures may fall\r\nhere and there, but very soon the vertical rows on the middle part of\r\nthe basal line begin to increase. Sometimes ten or twenty measurements\r\nwill suffice to make the line of chance appear, but often indentations\r\nwill remain. With the increasing number of the observations the\r\nirregularities gradually [729] disappear, and the line becomes smoother\r\nand more uniformly curved.\r\n\r\nThis method of arranging the figures directly on a basal line is very\r\nconvenient, whenever observations are made in the field or garden. Very\r\nfew instances need be recorded to obtain an appreciation of the mean\r\nvalue, and to show what may be expected from a continuance of the test.\r\nThe method is so simple and so striking, and so wholly independent of\r\nany mathematical development that it should be applied in all cases in\r\nwhich it is desired to ascertain the average value of any organ, and the\r\nmeasure of the attendant deviations.\r\n\r\nI cite an instance, secured by counting the ray-florets on the\r\nflower-heads of the corn-marigold or _Chrysanthemum segetum_. It was\r\nthat, by which I was enabled to select the plant, which afterwards\r\nshowed the first signs of a double head. I noted them in this way;\r\n\r\n       47\r\n       47   52\r\n       41   54   68\r\n       44   50   62   75\r\n  36   45   58   65   72   __   99\r\n\r\nOf course the figures might be replaced in this work by equidistant dots\r\nor by lines, but experience teaches that the chance of making mistakes\r\nis noticeably lessened by writing down [730] the figures themselves.\r\nWhenever decimals are made use of it is obviously the best plan to keep\r\nthe figures themselves. For afterwards it often becomes necessary to\r\narrange them according to a somewhat different standard.\r\n\r\nUniting the heads of the vertical rows of figures by a line, the form\r\ncorresponding to Quetelet's law is easily seen. In the main it is always\r\nthe same as the line shown by the measurements of beans and seeds. It\r\nproves a dense crowding of the single instances around the average, and\r\non both sides of the mass of the observations, a few wide deviations.\r\nThese become more rare in proportion to the amount of their divergency.\r\nOn both sides of the average the line begins by falling very rapidly,\r\nbut then bends slowly so as to assume a nearly horizontal direction. It\r\nreaches the basal line only beyond the extreme instances.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that all qualities, which can be expressed by\r\nfigures, may be treated in this way. First, of all the organs occurring\r\nin varying numbers, as for instance the ray-florets of composites, the\r\nrays of umbels, the blades of pinnate and palmate leaves, the numbers of\r\nveins, etc., are easily shown to comply with the same general rule.\r\nLikewise the amount of chemical substances can be expressed in\r\npercentage numbers, as is done on a large [731] scale with sugar in\r\nbeets and sugar-cane, with starch in potatoes and in other instances.\r\nThese figures are also found to follow the same law.\r\n\r\nAll qualities which are seen to increase and to decrease may be dealt\r\nwith in the same manner, if a standard unit for their measurement can be\r\nfixed. Even the colors of flowers may not escape our inquiry.\r\n\r\nIf we now compare the lines, compiled from the most divergent cases,\r\nthey will be found to exhibit the same features in the main. Ordinarily\r\nthe curve is symmetrical, the line sloping down on both sides after the\r\nsame manner. But it is not at all rare that the inclination is steep on\r\none side and gradual on the other. This is noticeably the case if the\r\nobservations relate to numbers, the average of which is near zero. Here\r\nof course the allowance for variation is only small on one side, while\r\nit may increase with out distinct limits on the alternate slope. So it\r\nis for instance with the numbers of ray-florets in the example given on\r\np. 729. Such divergent cases, however, are to be considered as\r\nexceptions to the rule, due to some unknown cause.\r\n\r\nHeretofore we have discussed the empirical side of the problem only. For\r\nthe purpose of experimental study of questions of heredity this is\r\nordinarily quite sufficient. The inquiry [732] into the phenomenon of\r\nregression, or of the relation of the degree of deviation of the progeny\r\nto that of their parents, and the selection of extreme instances for\r\nmultiplication are obviously independent of mathematical considerations.\r\nOn the other hand an important inquiry lies in the statistical treatment\r\nof these phenomena, and such treatment requires the use of mathematical\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nStatistics however, are not included in the object of these lectures,\r\nand therefore I shall refrain from an explanation of the method of their\r\npreparation and limit myself to a general comparison of the observed\r\nlines with the law of chance. Before going into the details, it should\r\nbe repeated once more that the empirical result is quite the same for\r\nindividual and for partial fluctuations. As a rule, the latter occur in\r\nfar greater number, and are thus more easily investigated, but\r\nindividual or personal averages have also been studied.\r\n\r\nNewton discovered that the law of chance can be expressed by very simple\r\nmathematical calculations. Without going into details, we may at once\r\nstate that these calculations are based upon his binomium. If the form\r\n(a + b) is calculated for some value of the exponent, and if the values\r\nof the coefficients after development are alone considered, they yield\r\nthe basis [733] for the construction of what is called the line or curve\r\nof probability. For this construction the coefficients are used as\r\nordinates, the length of which is to be made proportionate to their\r\nvalue. If this is done, and the ordinates are arranged at equal\r\ndistances, the line which unites their summits is the desired curve. At\r\nfirst glance it exhibits a form quite analogous to the curves of\r\nfluctuating variability, obtained by the measurements of beans and in\r\nother instances. Both lines are symmetrical and slope rapidly down in\r\nthe region of the average, while with increasing distance they gradually\r\nlose their steep inclination, becoming nearly parallel to the base at\r\ntheir termination.\r\n\r\nThis similarity between such empirical and theoretical lines is in\r\nitself an empirical fact. The causes of chance are assumed to be\r\ninnumerable, and the whole calculation is based on this assumption. The\r\ncauses of the fluctuations of biological phenomena have not as yet been\r\ncritically examined to such an extent as to allow of definite\r\nconceptions. The term nourishment manifestly includes quite a number of\r\nseparate factors, as light, space, temperature, moisture, the physical\r\nand chemical conditions of the soil and the changes of the weather.\r\nWithout doubt the single factors are very numerous, but whether they are\r\nnumerous enough to be treated [734] as innumerable, and thereby to\r\nexplain the laws of fluctuations, remains uncertain. Of course the\r\neasiest way is to assume that they combine in the same manner as the\r\ncauses of chance, and that this is the ground of the similarity of the\r\ncurves. On the other hand, it is manifestly of the highest importance to\r\ninquire into the part the several factors play in the determination of\r\nthe curves. It is not at all improbable that some of them have a larger\r\ninfluence on individual, and others on partial, fluctuations. If this\r\nwere the case, their importance with respect to questions of heredity\r\nmight be widely different. In the present state of our knowledge the\r\nfluctuation-curves do not contribute in any large measure to an\r\nelucidation of the causes. Where these are obvious, they are so without\r\nstatistics, exactly as they were, previous to Quetelet's discovery.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of a large number of questions concerning heredity and\r\nselection, it is very desirable to have a somewhat closer knowledge of\r\nthese curves. Therefore I shall try to point out their more essential\r\nfeatures, as far as this can be done without mathematical calculations.\r\n\r\nAt a first glance three points strike us, the average or the summit of\r\nthe curve, and the extremes. If the general shape is once denoted by the\r\nresults of observations or by the coefficients [735] of the binomium,\r\nall further details seem to depend upon them. In respect to the average\r\nthis is no doubt the case; it is an empirical value without need of any\r\nfurther discussion. The more the number of the observations increases,\r\nthe more assured and the more correct is this mean value, but generally\r\nit is the same for smaller and for larger groups of observations.\r\n\r\nThis however, is not the case with the extremes. It is quite evident\r\nthat small groups have a chance of containing neither of them. The more\r\nthe number of the observations increases, the larger is the chance of\r\nextremes. As a rule, and excluding exceptional cases, the extreme\r\ndeviations will increase in proportion to the number of cases examined.\r\nIn a hundred thousand beans the smallest one and the largest one may be\r\nexpected to differ more widely from one another than in a few hundred\r\nbeans of the same sample. Hence the conclusion that extremes are not a\r\nsafe criterion for the discussion of the curves, and not at all adequate\r\nfor calculations, which must be based upon more definite values.\r\n\r\nA real standard is afforded by the steepness of the slope. This may be\r\nunequal on the two sides of one curve, and likewise it may differ for\r\ndifferent cases. This steepness is usually measured by means of a point\r\non the half curve and [736 ] for this purpose a point is chosen which\r\nlies exactly half way between the average and the extreme. Not however\r\nhalf way with respect to the amplitude of the extreme deviation, for on\r\nthis ground it would partake of the uncertainty of the extreme itself.\r\nIt is the point on the curve which is surpassed by half the number, and\r\nnot reached by the other half of the number of the observations included\r\nin the half of the curve. This point corresponds to the important value\r\ncalled the probable error, and was designated by Galton as the quartile.\r\nFor it is evident that the average and the two quartiles divide the\r\nwhole of the observations into four equal parts.\r\n\r\nChoosing the quartiles as the basis for calculations we are independent\r\nof all the secondary causes of error, which necessarily are inherent in\r\nthe extremes. At a casual examination, or for demonstrative purposes,\r\nthe extremes may be prominent, but for all further considerations the\r\nquartiles are the real values upon which to rest calculations.\r\n\r\nMoreover if the agreement with the law of probability is once conceded,\r\nthe whole curve is defined by the average and the quartiles, and the\r\nresult of hundreds of measurements or countings may be summed up in\r\nthree, or, in [737] the case of symmetrical curves, perhaps in two\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nAlso in comparing different curves with one another, the quartiles are\r\nof great importance. Whenever an empirical fluctuation-curve is to be\r\ncompared with the theoretical form, or when two or more cases of\r\nvariability are to be considered under one head, the lines are to be\r\ndrawn on the same base. It is manifest that the averages must be brought\r\nupon the same ordinate, but as to the steepness of the line, much\r\ndepends on the manner of plotting. Here we must remember that the mutual\r\ndistance of the ordinates has been a wholly arbitrary one in all our\r\nprevious considerations. And so it is, as long as only one curve is\r\nconsidered at a time. But as soon as two are to be compared, it is\r\nobvious that free choice is no longer allowed. The comparison must be\r\nmade on a common basis, and to this effect the quartiles must be brought\r\ntogether. They are to lie on the same ordinates. If this is done, each\r\ndivision of the base corresponds to the same proportionate number of\r\nindividuals, and a complete comparison is made possible.\r\n\r\nOn the ground of such a comparison we may thus assert that,\r\nfluctuations, however different the organs or qualities observed, are\r\nthe same whenever their curves are seen to overlap one [738] another.\r\nFurthermore, whenever an empirical curve agrees in this manner with the\r\ntheoretical one, the fluctuation complies with Quetelet's law, and may\r\nbe ascribed to quite ordinary and universal causes. But if it seems to\r\ndiverge from this line, the cause of this divergence should be inquired\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nSuch abnormal curves occur from time to time, but are rare.\r\nUnsymmetrical instances have already been alluded to, and seem to be\r\nquite frequent. Another deviation from the rule is the presence of more\r\nthan one summit. This case falls under two headings. If the ray florets\r\nof a composite are counted, and the figures brought into a curve, a\r\nprominent summit usually corresponds to the average. But next to this,\r\nand on both sides, smaller summits are to be seen. On a close inspection\r\nthese summits are observed to fall on the same ordinates, on which, in\r\nthe case of allied species, the main apex lies. The specific character\r\nof one form is thus repeated as a secondary character on an allied\r\nspecies. Ludwig discovered that these secondary summits comply with the\r\nrule discovered by Braun and Schimper, stating the relation of the\r\nsubsequent figures of the series. This series gives the terms of the\r\ndisposition of leaves in general, and of the bracts and flowers on the\r\ncomposite flower [739] heads in our particular case. It is the series to\r\nwhich we have already alluded when dealing with the arrangement of the\r\nleaves on the twisted teasels. It commences with 1 and 2 and each\r\nfollowing figure is equal to the sum of its two precedents. The most\r\ncommon figures are 3, 5, 8, 13, 18, 21, higher cases seldom coming under\r\nobservation. Now the secondary summits of the ray-curves of the\r\ncomposites are seen to agree, as a rule, with these figures. Other\r\ninstances could readily be given.\r\n\r\nOur second heading includes those cases which exhibit two summits of\r\nequal or nearly equal height. Such cases occur when different races are\r\nmixed, each retaining its own average and its own curve-summit. We have\r\nalready demonstrated such a case when dealing with the origin of our\r\ndouble corn-chrysanthemum. The wild species culminates with 13 rays, and\r\nthe grandiflorum variety with 21. Often the latter is found to be\r\nimpure, being mixed with the typical species to a varying extent. This\r\nis not easily ascertained by a casual inspection of the cultures, but\r\nthe true condition will promptly betray itself, if curves are\r\nconstructed. In this way curves may in many instances be made use of to\r\ndiscover mixed races. Double curves may also result from the\r\ninvestigation [740] of true double races, or ever-sporting varieties.\r\nThe striped snapdragon shows a curve of its stripes with two summits,\r\none corresponding to the average striped flowers, and the other to the\r\npure red ones. Such cases may be discovered by means of curves, but the\r\nconstituents cannot be separated by culture-experiments.\r\n\r\nA curious peculiarity is afforded by half curves. The number of petals\r\nis often seen to vary only in one direction from what should be expected\r\nto be the mean condition. With buttercups and brambles and many others\r\nthere is only an increase above the typical five; quaternate flowers are\r\nwanting or at least are very rare. With weigelias and many others the\r\nnumber of the tips of the corolla varies downwards, going from five to\r\nfour and three. Hundreds of flowers show the typical five, and determine\r\nthe summit of the curve. This drops down on one side only, indicating\r\nunilateral variability, which in many cases is due to a very intimate\r\nconnection of a concealed secondary summit and the main one. In the case\r\nof the bulbous buttercup, _Ranunculus bulbosus_, I have succeeded in\r\nisolating this secondary summit, although not in a separate variety, but\r\nonly in a form corresponding to the type of ever-sporting varieties.\r\n\r\n[741] Recapitulating the results of this too condensed discussion, we\r\nmay state that fluctuations are linear, being limited to an increase and\r\nto a decrease of the characters. These changes are mainly due to\r\ndifferences in nourishment, either of the whole organism or of its\r\nparts. In the first case, the deviations from the mean are called\r\nindividual; they are of great importance for the hereditary characters\r\nof the offspring. In the second case the deviations are far more\r\nuniversal and far more striking, but of lesser importance. They are\r\ncalled partial fluctuations.\r\n\r\nAll these fluctuations comply, in the main, with the law of probability,\r\nand behave as if their causes were influenced only by chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[742]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVI\r\n\r\nASEXUAL MULTIPLICATION OF EXTREMES\r\n\r\nFluctuating variability may be regarded from two different points of\r\nview. The multiformity of a bed of flowers is often a desirable feature,\r\nand all means which widen the range of fluctuation are therefore used to\r\nenhance this feature, and variability affords specimens, which surpass\r\nthe average, by yielding a better or larger product.\r\n\r\nIn the case of fruits and other cultivated forms, it is of course\r\nprofitable to propagate from the better specimens only, and if possible\r\nonly from the very best. Obviously the best are the extremes of the\r\nwhole range of diverging forms, and moreover the extremes on one side of\r\nthe group. Almost always the best for practical purposes is that in\r\nwhich some quality is strengthened. Cases occur however, in which it is\r\ndesirable to diminish an injurious peculiarity as far as possible, and\r\nin these instances the opposite extreme is the most profitable one.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead us to a discussion [743] of the results of the\r\nchoice of extremes, which it may be easily seen is a matter of the\r\ngreatest practical importance. This choice is generally designated as\r\nselection, but as with most of the terms in the domain of variability,\r\nthe word selection has come to have more than one meaning. Facts have\r\naccumulated enormously since the time of Darwin, a more thorough\r\nknowledge has brought about distinctions, and divisions at a rapidly\r\nincreasing rate, with which terminology has not kept pace. Selection\r\nincludes all kinds of choice. Darwin distinguished between natural and\r\nartificial selection, but proper subdivisions of these conceptions are\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth lecture we dealt with this same question, and saw that\r\nselection must, in the first place, make a choice between the elementary\r\nspecies of the same systematic form. This selection of species or\r\nspecies-selection was the work of Le Couteur and Patrick Shirreff, and\r\nis now in general use in practice where it has received the name of\r\nvariety-testing. This clear and unequivocal term however, can hardly be\r\nincluded under the head of natural selection. The poetic terminology of\r\nselection by nature has already brought about many difficulties that\r\nshould be avoided in the future. On the other hand, the designation of\r\nthe process as a natural [744] selection of species complies as closely\r\nas possible with existing terminology, and does not seem liable to any\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIt is a selection between species. Opposed to it is the selection within\r\nthe species. Manifestly the first should precede the second, and if this\r\nsequence is not conscientiously followed it will result in confusion.\r\nThis is evident when it is considered that fluctuations can only appear\r\nwith their pure and normal type in pure strains, and that each admixture\r\nof other units is liable to be shown by the form of the curves. More\r\nover, selection chooses single individuals, and a single plant, if it is\r\nnot a hybrid, can scarcely pertain to two different species. The first\r\nchoice therefore is apt to make the strain pure.\r\n\r\nIn contrasting selection between species with that within the species,\r\nof course elementary species are meant, including varieties. The terms\r\nwould be of no consequence if only rightly understood. For the sake of\r\nclearness we might designate the last named process with the term of\r\nintra-specific selection, and it is obvious that this term is applicable\r\nboth to natural and to artificial selection.\r\n\r\nHaving previously dealt with species-selection at sufficient length, we\r\nmay now confine ourselves to the consideration of the intra-specific\r\n[745] selection process. In practice it is of secondary importance, and\r\nin nature it takes a very subordinate position. For this reason it will\r\nbe best to confine further discussions to the experience of the\r\nbreeders.\r\n\r\nTwo different ways are open to make fluctuating variability profitable.\r\nBoth consist in the multiplication of the chosen extremes, and this\r\nincrease may be attained in a vegetative manner, or by the use of seeds.\r\nAsexual and sexual propagation are different in many respects, and so\r\nthey are also in the domain of variability.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a clear comprehension of this difference, it is\r\nnecessary to start from the distinction between individual and partial\r\nfluctuations, as given in the last lecture. This distinction may be\r\ndiscussed more understandingly if the causes of the variability are\r\ntaken into consideration. We have dealt with them at some length, and\r\nare now aware that inner conditions only, determine averages, while some\r\nfluctuation around them is allowable, as influenced by external\r\nconditions. These outward influences act throughout life. At the very\r\nfirst they impress their stamp on the whole organism, and incite a\r\nlasting change in distinct directions. This is the period of the\r\ndevelopment of the germ within the seed; it begins with the fusion of\r\nthe sexual cells, and each of them may be influenced [746] to a\r\nnoticeable degree before this union. This is the period of the\r\ndetermination of individual variability. As soon as ramifications begin,\r\nthe external conditions act separately on every part, influencing some\r\nto a greater and others to a lesser degree. Here we have the beginning\r\nof partial variability. At the outset all parts may be affected in the\r\nsame way and in the same measure, but the chances of such an agreement,\r\nof course, rapidly diminish. This is partly due to differences in\r\nexposure, but mainly to alterations of the sensibility of the organs\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to gain a clear conception of the contrast between\r\nindividual and partial variability, and neither is it easy to appreciate\r\ntheir cooperation rightly. Perhaps the best way is to consider their\r\nactivity as a gradual narrowing of possibilities. At the outset the\r\nplant may develop its qualities in any measure, nothing being as yet\r\nfixed. Gradually however, the development takes a definite direction,\r\nfor better or for worse. Is a direction once taken, then it becomes the\r\naverage, around which the remaining possibilities are grouped. The plant\r\nor the organ goes on in this way, until finally it reaches maturity with\r\none of the thousands of degrees of development, between which at the\r\nbeginning it had a free choice.\r\n\r\n[747] Putting this discussion in other terms, we find every individual\r\nand every organ in the adult state corresponding with a single ordinate\r\nof the curve. The curve indicates the range of possibilities, the\r\nordinate shows the choice that has been made. Now it is clear at once\r\nthat this choice has not been made suddenly but gradually. Halfway of\r\nthe development, the choice is halfway determined, but the other half is\r\nstill undefined. The first half is the same for all the organs of the\r\nplant, and is therefore termed individual; the second differs in the\r\nseparate members, and consequently is known as partial. Which of the two\r\nhalves is the greater and which the lesser, of course depends on the\r\ncases considered.\r\n\r\nFinally we may describe a single example, the length of the capsules of\r\nthe evening-primrose. This is highly variable, the longest reaching more\r\nthan twice the length of the smallest. Many capsules are borne on the\r\nsame spike, and they are easily seen to be of unequal size. They vary\r\naccording to their position, the size diminishing in the main from the\r\nbase upwards, especially on the higher parts. Likewise the fruits of\r\nweaker lateral branches are smaller. Curves are easily made by measuring\r\na few hundred capsules from corresponding parts of different plants, or\r\neven by limiting the [748] inquiry to a single individual. These curves\r\ngive the partial variability, and are found to comply with Quetelet's\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nBesides this limited study, we may compare the numerous individuals of\r\none locality or of a large plot of cultivated plants with one another.\r\nIn doing so, we are struck with the fact that some plants have large and\r\nothers small fruits. We now limit ourselves to the main spike of each\r\nplant, and perhaps to its lower parts, so as to avoid as far as possible\r\nthe impression made by the partial fluctuations. The differences remain,\r\nand are sufficient to furnish an easy comparison with the general law.\r\nIn order to do this, we take from each plant a definite number of\r\ncapsules and measure their average length. In some experiments I took\r\nthe twenty lowermost capsules of the main spikes. In this way one\r\naverage was obtained for each plant, and combining these into a curve,\r\nit was found that these fluctuations also came under Quetelet's law.\r\nThus the individual averages, and the fluctuations around each of them,\r\nfollow the same rule. The first are a measure for the whole plant, the\r\nsecond only for its parts. As a general resume we can assert that, as a\r\nrule, a quality is determined in some degree during the earlier stages\r\nof the organism, and that this determination is valid throughout its\r\n[749] life. Afterwards only the minor points remain to be regulated.\r\nThis makes it at once clear that the range of individual and partial\r\nvariability together must be wider than that of either of them, taken\r\nalone. Partial fluctuations cannot, of course, be excluded. Thus our\r\ncomparison is limited to individual and partial variability on one side,\r\nand partial fluctuations alone on the other side.\r\n\r\nIntra-specific selection is thus seen to fall under two heads: a\r\nselection between the individuals, and a choice within each of them. The\r\nfirst affords a wider and the latter a narrower field.\r\n\r\nIndividual variability, considered as the result of outward influences\r\noperative during extreme youth, can be excluded in a very simple manner.\r\nObviously it suffices to exclude extreme youth, in other words, to\r\nexclude the use of seeds. Multiplication in a vegetative way, by\r\ngrafting and budding, by runners or roots, or by simple division of\r\nrootstocks and bulbs is the way in which to limit variability to the\r\npartial half. This is all we may hope to attain, but experience shows\r\nthat it is a very efficient means of limitation. Partial fluctuations\r\nare generally far smaller than individual and partial fluctuations\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIndividual variability in the vegetable kingdom [750] might be called\r\nseed-variation, as opposed to partial or bud-fluctuation. And perhaps\r\nthese terms are more apt to convey a clear conception of the distinction\r\nthan any other. The germ within the unripe seed is easily understood to\r\nbe far more sensitive to external conditions than a bud.\r\n\r\nMultiplication of extremes by seed is thus always counteracted by\r\nindividual variability, which at once reopens all, or nearly all, the\r\ninitial possibilities. Multiplication by buds is exempt from this danger\r\nand thus leads to a high degree of uniformity. And this uniformity is in\r\nmany cases exactly what the breeder endeavors to obtain.\r\n\r\nWe will treat of this reopening of previous possibilities under the head\r\nof regression in the next lecture. It is not at all absolute, at least\r\nnot in one generation. Part of the improvement remains, and favors the\r\nnext generation. This part may be estimated approximately as being about\r\none-third or one-half of the improvement attained. Hence the conclusion\r\nthat vegetative multiplication gives rise to varieties which are as a\r\nrule twice or thrice as good as selected varieties of plants propagated\r\nby seeds. Hence, likewise the inference that breeders generally prefer\r\nvegetative multiplication of improved forms, and apply it in all\r\npossible cases. [751] Of course the application is limited, and forage\r\ncrops and the greater number of vegetables will always necessarily be\r\npropagated by seed.\r\n\r\nNature ordinarily prefers the sexual way. Asexual multiplications,\r\nalthough very common with perennial plants, appear not to offer\r\nimportant material for selection. Hence it follows that in comparing the\r\nwork of nature with that of man, the results of selection followed by\r\nvegetative propagation should always be carefully excluded. Our large\r\nbulb-flowers and delicious fruits have nothing in common with natural\r\nproducts, and do not yield a standard by which to judge nature's work.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for a botanist to give a survey of what practice\r\nhas attained by the asexual multiplication of extremes. Nearly all of\r\nthe large and more palatable fruits are due to such efforts. Some\r\nflowers and garden-plants afford further instances. By far the greatest\r\nmajority of improved asexual varieties, however, are not the result of\r\npure intra-specific selection. They are due largely to the choice of the\r\nbest existing elementary species, and to some extent to crosses between\r\nthem, or between distinct systematic species. In practice selection and\r\nhybridization go hand in hand and it is often difficult to ascertain\r\nwhat part of [752] the result is due to the one, and what to the other\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nThe scientist, on the contrary, has nothing to do with the industrial\r\nproduct. His task is the analysis of the methods, in order to reach a\r\nclear appreciation of the influence of all the competing factors. This\r\nstudy of the working causes leads to a better understanding of the\r\npractical processes, and may become the basis of improvement in methods.\r\n\r\nStarting from these considerations, we will now give some illustrative\r\nexamples, and for the first, choose one in which hybridization is almost\r\ncompletely excluded.\r\n\r\nSugar-canes have long been considered to be plants without seed. Their\r\nnumerous varieties are propagated only in a vegetative way. The stems\r\nare cut into pieces, each bearing one or two or more nodes with their\r\nbuds. An entire variety, though it may be cultivated in large districts\r\nand even in various countries, behaves with respect to variability as a\r\nsingle individual. Its individual fluctuability has been limited to the\r\nearliest period of its life, when it arose from an unknown seed. The\r\npersonal characters that have been stamped on this one seed, partly by\r\nits descent, and partly in the development of its germ during the period\r\nof ripening, have become the indelible characters [753] of the variety,\r\nand only the partial fluctuability, due to the effect of later\r\ninfluences, can now be studied statistically.\r\n\r\nThis study has for its main object the production of sugar in the stems,\r\nand the curves, which indicate the percentage of this important\r\nsubstance in different stems of the same variety, comply with Quetelet's\r\nlaw. Each variety has its own average, and around this the data of the\r\nmajority of the stems are densely crowded, while deviations on both\r\nsides are rare and become the rarer the wider they are. The \"Cheribon\"\r\ncane is the richest variety cultivated in Java, and has an average of\r\n19% sugar, while it fluctuates between 11% and 28%. \"Chunnic\" averages\r\n14%, \"Black Manilla\" 13% and \"White Manilla\" 10%; their highest and\r\nlowest extremes diverge in the same manner, being for the last named\r\nvariety 1% and 15%.\r\n\r\nThis partial variability is of high practical interest, because on it a\r\nselection may be founded. According to the conceptions described in a\r\nprevious lecture, fluctuating variability is the result of those outward\r\nfactors that determine the strength of development of the plant or the\r\norgan. The inconstancy of the degree of sensibility, combined with the\r\never-varying weather conditions preclude any close proportionality, but\r\napart from this difficulty there is, in the [754] main, a distinct\r\nrelation between organic strength and the development of single\r\nqualities. This correlation has not escaped observation in the case of\r\nthe sugar-cane, and it is known that the best grown stocks are generally\r\nthe richest in sugar. Now it is evident that the best grown and richest\r\nstems will have the greater chance of transmitting these qualities to\r\nthe lateral-buds. This at once gives, a basis for vegetative selection,\r\nupon which it is not necessary to choose a small number of very\r\nexcellent stems, but simply to avoid the planting of all those that are\r\nbelow the average. By this means the yield of the cultures has often\r\nnoticeably been enhanced.\r\n\r\nAs far as experience goes, this sort of selection, however profitable,\r\ndoes not conduce to the production of improved races. Only temporary\r\nameliorations are obtained, and the selection must be made in the same\r\nmanner every year. Moreover the improvement is very limited and does not\r\ngive any promise of further increase. In order to reach this, one has to\r\nrecur to the individual fluctuability, and therefore to seed.\r\n\r\nNearly half a century ago, Parris discovered, on the island of Barbados,\r\nthat seeds might occasionally be gathered from the canes. These,\r\nhowever, yielded only grass-like plants of no real value. The same\r\nobservation was made [755] shortly afterwards in Java and in other sugar\r\nproducing countries. In the year 1885, Soltwedel, the director of one of\r\nthe experiment stations for the culture of sugar-cane in Java, conceived\r\nthe idea of making use of seedlings for the production of improved\r\nraces. This idea is a very practical one, precisely because of the\r\npossibility of vegetative propagation. If individuals would show the\r\nsame range as that of partial fluctuability, then the choice of the\r\nextremes would at once bring the average up to the richness of the best\r\nstocks. Once attained, this average would be fixed, without further\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is one great drawback. This is the infertility of\r\nthe best variety, that of the \"Cheribon\" cane. It flowers abundantly in\r\nsome years, but it has never been known to produce ripe seeds. For this\r\nreason Soltwedel had to start from the second best sort, and chose the\r\n\"Hawaii\" cane. This variety usually yields about 14% sugar, and\r\nSoltwedel found among his seedlings one that showed 15%. This fact was\r\nquite unexpected at that time, and excited widespread interest in the\r\nnew method, and since then it has been applied to numerous varieties,\r\nand many thousands of seedlings have been raised and tested as to their\r\nsugar-production.\r\n\r\n[756] From a scientific point of view the results are quite striking.\r\nFrom the practical standpoint, however, the question is, whether the\r\n\"Hawaii\" and other fertile varieties are adequate to yield seedlings,\r\nwhich will surpass the infertile \"Cheribon\" cane. Now \"Hawaii\" averages\r\n14% and \"Cheribon\" 19%, and it is easily understood that a \"Hawaii\"\r\nseedling with more than 19% can be expected only from very large\r\nsowings. Hundreds of thousands of seedlings must be cultivated, and\r\ntheir juice tested, before this improvement can be reached. Even then,\r\nit may have no significance for practical purposes. Next to the amount\r\nof sugar comes the resistance to the disease called \"Sereh,\" and the new\r\nrace requires to be ameliorated in this important direction, too. Other\r\nqualities must also be considered, and any casual deterioration in other\r\ncharacters would make all progress illusory. For these reasons much time\r\nis required to attain distinct improvements.\r\n\r\nThese great difficulties in the way of selecting extremes for vegetative\r\npropagation are of course met with everywhere. They impede the work of\r\nthe breeder to such a degree, that but few men are able to surmount\r\nthem. Breeding new varieties necessitates the bending of every effort to\r\nthis purpose, and a clear conception of [757] the manifold aspects of\r\nthis intricate problem. These fall under two heads, the exigencies of\r\npractice, and the physiologic laws of variability. Of course, only the\r\nlatter heading comes within the limits of our discussion which includes\r\ntwo main points. First comes the general law of fluctuation that, though\r\nslight deviations from the average may be found by thousands, or rather\r\nin nearly every individual, larger and therefore important deviations\r\nare very rare. Thousands of seedlings must be examined carefully in\r\norder to find one or two from which it might be profitable to start a\r\nnew race. This point is the same for practical and for scientific\r\ninvestigation. In the second place however, a digression is met with.\r\nThe practical man must take into consideration all the varying qualities\r\nof his improved strains. Some of them must be increased and others be\r\ndecreased, and their common dependency on external conditions often\r\nmakes it very difficult to discover the desired combinations. It is\r\nobvious, however, that the neglect of one quality may make all\r\nimprovement of other characters wholly useless. No augmentation of\r\nsugar-percentage, of size and flavor of fruits can counterbalance an\r\nincrease in sensitiveness to disease, and so it is with other qualities\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n[758] Improved races for scientific investigation can be kept free from\r\ninfection, and protected against numerous other injuries. In the\r\nexperimental garden they may find conditions which cannot be realized\r\nelsewhere. They may show a luxuriant growth, and prove to be excellent\r\nmaterial for research, but have features which, having been overlooked\r\nat the period of selection, would at once condemn them if left to\r\nordinary conditions, or to the competition of other species.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these obstacles, it is only natural that breeders should\r\nuse every means to reach their goal. Only in very rare instances do they\r\nfollow methods analogous to scientific processes, which tend to simplify\r\nthe questions as much as possible. As a rule, the practical way is the\r\ncombination of as many causes of variability as possible. Now the three\r\ngreat sources of variability are, as has been pointed out on several\r\noccasions, the original multiformity of the species, fluctuating\r\nvariability, and hybridization. Hence, in practical experiments, all\r\nthree are combined. Together they yield results of the highest value,\r\nand Burbank's improved fruits and flowers give testimony to the\r\npractical significance of this combination.\r\n\r\nFrom a scientific point of view however, it is [759] ordinarily\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to discern the part which each of the\r\nthree great branches of variability has taken in the origination of the\r\nproduct. A full analysis is rarely possible, and the treatment of one of\r\nthe three factors must necessarily remain incomplete.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these considerations, I will now give some examples in\r\norder to show that fluctuating variability plays a prominent part in\r\nthese improvements. Of course it is the third in importance in the\r\nseries. First comes the choice of the material from the assemblage of\r\nspecies, elementary species and varieties. Hybridization comes next in\r\nimportance. But even the hybrids of the best parents may be improved,\r\nbecause they are no less subject to Quetelet's law than any other\r\nstrain. Any large number of hybrids of the same ancestry will prove\r\nthis, and often the excellency of a hybrid variety depends chiefly, or\r\nat least definitely, on the selection of the best individuals. Being\r\npropagated only in a vegetative way, they retain their original good\r\nqualities through all further culture and multiplication.\r\n\r\nAs an illustrative example I will take the genus _Canna_. Originally\r\ncultivated for its large and bright foliage only, it has since become a\r\nflowering plant of value. Our garden strains have originated by the\r\ncrossing of [760] a number of introduced wild species, among which the\r\n_Canna indica_ is the oldest, now giving its name to the whole group. It\r\nhas tall stems and spikes with rather inconspicuous flowers with narrow\r\npetals. It has been crossed with _C. nepalensis_ and _C. warczewiczii_,\r\nand the available historic evidence points to the year 1846 as that of\r\nthe first cross. This was made by Annee between the _indica_ and the\r\n_nepalensis_; it took ten years to multiply them to the required degree\r\nfor introduction into commerce. These first hybrids had bright foliage\r\nand were tall plants, but their flowers were by no means remarkable.\r\n\r\nOnce begun, hybridization was widely practiced. About the year 1889\r\nCrozy exhibited at Paris the first beautifully flowering form, which he\r\nnamed for his wife, \"Madame Crozy.\" Since that time he and many others,\r\nhave improved the flowers in the shape and size, as well as in color and\r\nits patterns. In the main, these ameliorations have been due to the\r\ndiscovery and introduction of new wild species possessing the required\r\ncharacters. This is illustrated by the following incident. In the year\r\n1892 I visited Mr. Crozy at Lyons. He showed me his nursery and numerous\r\nacquisitions, those of former years as well as those that were quite\r\nnew, and which were in the process of rapid [761] multiplication,\r\nprevious to being given to the trade. I wondered, and asked, why no pure\r\nwhite variety was present. His answer was \"Because no white species had\r\nbeen found up to the present time, and there is no other means of\r\nproducing white varieties than by crossing the existing forms with a new\r\nwhite type.\"\r\n\r\nComparing the varieties produced in successive periods, it is very easy\r\nto appreciate their gradual improvement. On most points this is not\r\nreadily put into words, but the size of the petals can be measured, and\r\nthe figures may convey at least some idea of the real state of things.\r\nLeaving aside the types with small flowers and cultivated exclusively\r\nfor their foliage, the oldest flowers of _Canna_ had petals of 45 mm.\r\nlength and 13 mm. breadth. The ordinary types at the time of my visit\r\nhad reached 61 by 21 mm., and the \"Madame Crozy\" showed 66 by 30 mm. It\r\nhad however, already been surpassed by a few commercial varieties, which\r\nhad the same length but a breadth of 35 mm. And the latest production,\r\nwhich required some years of propagation before being put on the market,\r\nmeasured 83 by 43 mm. Thus in the lapse of some thirty years the length\r\nhad been doubled and the breadth tripled, giving flowers with broad\r\ncorollas and with petals [762] joined all around, resembling the best\r\ntypes of lilies and _Amaryllis_.\r\n\r\nStriking as this result unquestionably is, it remains doubtful as to\r\nwhat part of it is due to the discovery and introduction of new large\r\nflowered species, and what to the selection of the extremes of\r\nfluctuating variability. As far as I have been able to ascertain\r\nhowever, and according to the evidence given to me by Mr. Crozy,\r\nselection has had the largest part in regard to the size, while the\r\ncolor-patterns are introduced qualities.\r\n\r\nThe scientific analysis of other intricate examples is still more\r\ndifficult. To the practical breeder they often seem very simple, but the\r\nstudent of heredity, who wishes to discern the different factors, is\r\noften quite puzzled by this apparent simplicity. So it is in the case of\r\nthe double lilacs, a large number of varieties of which have recently\r\nbeen originated and introduced into commerce by Lemoine of Nancy. In the\r\nmain they owe their origin to the crossing and recrossing of a single\r\nplant of the old double variety with the numerous existing\r\nsingle-flowered sorts.\r\n\r\nThis double variety seems to be as old as the culture of the lilacs. It\r\nwas already known to Munting, who described it in the year 1671. Two\r\ncenturies afterwards, in 1870, a new description [763] was given by\r\nMorren, and though more than one varietal name is recorded in his paper,\r\nit appears from the facts given that even at that time only one variety\r\nexisted. It was commonly called _Syringa vulgaris azurea plena_, and\r\nseems to have been very rare and without real ornamental value.\r\n\r\nLemoine, however, conceived the desirability of a combination of the\r\ndoubling with the bright colors and large flower-racemes of other\r\nlilacs, and performed a series of crosses. The \"_azurea plena_\" has no\r\nstamens, and therefore must be used in all crosses as the pistil-parent;\r\nits ovary is narrowly inclosed in the tube of the flower, and difficult\r\nto fertilize. On the other hand, new crosses could be made every year,\r\nand the total number of hybrids with different pollen-parents was\r\nrapidly increased. After five years the hybrids began to flower and\r\ncould be used for new crosses, yielding a series of compound hybrids,\r\nwhich however, were not kept separate from the products of the first\r\ncrosses.\r\n\r\nGradually the number of the flowering specimens increased, and the\r\ncharacter of doubling was observed to be variable to a high degree.\r\nSometimes only one supernumerary petal was produced, sometimes a whole\r\nnew typical corolla was extruded from within the first. In the same\r\n[764] way the color and the number of the flowers on each raceme were\r\nseen to vary. Thousands of hybrids were produced, and only those which\r\nexhibited real advantages were selected for trade. These were multiplied\r\nby grafting, and each variety at present consists only of the buds of\r\none original individual and their products. No constancy from seed is\r\nassumed, many varieties are even quite sterile.\r\n\r\nOf course, no description was given of the rejected forms. It is only\r\nstated that many of them bore either single or poorly filled flowers, or\r\nwere objectionable in some other way. The range of variability, from\r\nwhich the choices were made, is obscure and only the fact of the\r\nselection is prominent. What part is due to the combination of the\r\nparental features and what to the individual fluctuation of the hybrid\r\nitself cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\nSo it is in numerous other instances. The dahlias have been derived from\r\nthree or more original species, and been subjected to cultivation and\r\nhybridization in an ever-increasing scale for a century. The best\r\nvarieties are only propagated in the vegetative way, by the roots and\r\nbuds, or by grafting and cutting. Each of them is, with regard to its\r\nhereditary qualities, only one individual, and the individual characters\r\nwere selected at the same time with the [765] varietal and hybrid\r\ncharacters. Most of them are very inconstant from seed and as a rule,\r\nonly mixtures are offered for sale in seed-lists. Which of their\r\nornamental features are due to fluctuating deviation from an average is\r\nof course unknown. _Amaryllis_ and _Gladiolus_ are surrounded with the\r\nsame scientific uncertainties. Eight or ten, or even more, species have\r\nbeen combined into one large and multiform strain, each bringing its\r\npeculiar qualities into the mixed mass. Every hybrid variety is one\r\nindividual, being propagated by bulbs only. Colors and color-patterns,\r\nshape of petals and other marks, have been derived from the wild\r\nancestors, but the large size of many of the best varieties is probably\r\ndue to the selection of the extremes of fluctuating variability. So it\r\nis with the begonias of our gardens, which are also composite hybrids,\r\nbut are usually sown on a very large scale. Flowers of 15 cm. diameter\r\nare very showy, but there can be no doubt about the manner in which they\r\nare produced, as the wild species fall far short of this size.\r\n\r\nAmong vegetables the potatoes afford another instance. Originally quite\r\na number of good species were in culture, most of them having small\r\ntubers. Our present varieties are due to hybridization and selection,\r\neach of them being propagated only in the vegetative way.\r\n\r\n[766] Selection is founded upon different qualities, according to the\r\nuse to be made of the new sort. Potatoes for the factory have even been\r\nselected for their amount of starch, and in this case at least,\r\nfluctuating variability has played a very important part in the\r\nimprovement of the race.\r\n\r\nVegetative propagation has the great advantage of exempting the\r\nvarieties from regression to mediocrity, which always follows\r\nmultiplication by seeds. It affords the possibility of keeping the\r\nextremes constant, and this is not its only advantage. Another, likewise\r\nhighly interesting, side of the question is the uniformity of the whole\r\nstrain. This is especially important in the case of fruits, though\r\nordinarily it is regarded as a matter of course, but there are some\r\nexceptions which give proof of the real importance of the usual\r\ncondition. For example, the walnut-tree. Thousands of acres of\r\nwalnut-orchards consist of seedling trees grown from nuts of unknown\r\nparentage. The result is a great diversity in the types of trees and in\r\nthe size and shape of the nuts, and this diversity is an obvious\r\ndisadvantage to the industry. The cause lies in the enormous\r\ndifficulties attached to grafting or budding of these trees, which make\r\nthis method very expensive and to a high degree uncertain and\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[767] After this hasty survey of the more reliable facts of the practice\r\nof an asexual multiplication of the extremes of fluctuating variability,\r\nwe may now return to the previously mentioned theoretical\r\nconsiderations. These are concerned with an estimation of the chances of\r\nthe occurrence of deviations, large enough to exhibit commercial value.\r\nThis chance may be calculated on the basis of Quetelet's law, whenever\r\nthe agreement of the fluctuation of the quality under consideration has\r\nbeen empirically determined. In the discussion of the methods of\r\ncomparing two curves, we have pointed to the quartiles as the decisive\r\npoints, and to the necessity of drawing the curves so that these points\r\nare made to overlie one another, on each side of the average. If now we\r\ncalculate the binomium of Newton for different values of the exponent,\r\nthe sum of the coefficients is doubled for each higher unit of the\r\nexponent, and at the same time the extreme limit of the curve is\r\nextended one step farther. Hence it is possible to calculate a relation\r\nbetween the value of the extreme and the number of cases required. It\r\nwould take us too long to give this calculation in detail, but it is\r\neasily seen that for each succeeding step the number of individuals must\r\nbe doubled, though the length of the steps, or the amount of increase of\r\nthe quality [768] remains the same. The result is that many thousands of\r\nseedlings are required to go beyond the ordinary range of variations,\r\nand that every further improvement requires the doubling of the whole\r\nculture. If ten thousand do not give a profitable deviation, the next\r\nstep requires twenty thousand, the following forty thousand, and so on.\r\nAnd all this work would be necessary for the improvement of a single\r\nquality, while practice requires the examination and amelioration of\r\nnearly all the variable characters of the strain.\r\n\r\nHence the rule that great results can only be obtained by the use of\r\nlarge numbers, but it is of no avail to state this conclusion from a\r\nscientific point of view. Scientific experimenters will rarely be able\r\nto sacrifice fifty thousand plants to a single selection. The problem is\r\nto introduce the principle into practice and to prove its direct\r\nusefulness and reliability. It is to Luther Burbank that we owe this\r\ngreat achievement. His principles are in full harmony with the teachings\r\nof science. His methods are hybridization and selection in the broadest\r\nsense and on the largest scale. One very illustrative example of his\r\nmethods must suffice to convey an idea of the work necessary to produce\r\na new race of superlative excellency. Forty thousand blackberry and\r\nraspberry [769] hybrids were produced and grown until the fruit matured.\r\nThen from the whole lot a single variety was chosen as the best. It is\r\nnow known under the name of \"Paradox.\" All others were uprooted with\r\ntheir crop of ripening berries, heaped up into a pile twelve feet wide,\r\nfourteen feet high and twenty-two feet long, and burned. Nothing\r\nremained of that expensive and lengthy experiment, except the one\r\nparent-plant of the new variety. Similar selections and similar amount\r\nof work have produced the famous plums, the brambles and the\r\nblackberries, the Shasta daisy, the peach almond, the improved\r\nblueberries, the hybrid lilies, and the many other valuable fruits and\r\ngarden-flowers that have made the fame of Burbank and the glory of\r\nhorticultural California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[770]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVII\r\n\r\nINCONSTANCY OF IMPROVED RACES\r\n\r\nThe greater advantages of the asexual multiplication of extremes are of\r\ncourse restricted to perennial and woody plants. Annual and biennial\r\nspecies cannot as a rule, be propagated in this way, and even with some\r\nperennials horticulturists prefer the sale of seeds to that of roots and\r\nbulbs. In all these cases it is clear that the exclusion of the\r\nindividual variability, which was shown to be an important point in the\r\nlast lecture, must be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nSeed-propagation is subject to individual as well as to fluctuating\r\nvariability. The first could perhaps be designated by another term,\r\nembryonic variability, since it indicates the fluctuations occurring\r\nduring the period of development of the germ. This period begins with\r\nthe fusion of the male and female elements and is largely dependent upon\r\nthe vigor of these cells at the moment, and on the varying qualities\r\nthey may have acquired. It comprises in the main the time of the\r\nripening of the seed, and [771] might perhaps best be considered to end\r\nwith the beginning of the resting stage of the ripe seed. Hence it is\r\nclear that the variability of seed-propagated annual races has a wider\r\nrange than that of perennials, shrubs and trees. At present it is\r\ndifficult to discern exactly the part each of these two main factors\r\nplays in the process. Many indications are found however, that make it\r\nprobable that embryonic variability is wider, and perhaps of far greater\r\nimportance than the subsequent partial fluctuations. The high degree of\r\nsimilarity between the single specimens of a vegetative variety, and the\r\nlarge amount of variability in seed-races strongly supports this view.\r\nThe propagation and multiplication of the extremes of fluctuating\r\nvariability by means of seeds requires a close consideration of the\r\nrelation between seedling and parent. The easiest way to get a clear\r\nconception of this relation is to make use of the ideas concerning the\r\ndependency of variability upon nourishment. Assuming these to be correct\r\nin the main, and leaving aside all minor questions, we may conclude that\r\nthe chosen extreme individual is one of the best nourished and\r\nintrinsically most vigorous of the whole culture. On account of these\r\nvery qualities it is capable of nourishing all of its organs better and\r\nalso its seeds. In other words, the seeds [772] of the extreme\r\nindividuals have exceptional chances of becoming better nourished than\r\nthe average of the seeds of the race. Applying the same rule to them, it\r\nis easily understood that they will vary, by reason of this better\r\nnourishment, in a direction corresponding to that of their parent.\r\n\r\nThis discussion gives a very simple explanation of the acknowledged fact\r\nthat the seeds of the extremes are in the main the best for the\r\npropagation of the race. It does not include however, all the causes for\r\nthis preferment. Some are of older date and due to previous influences.\r\n\r\nA second point in our discussion is the appreciation of the fact that a\r\nsingle individual may be chosen to gather the seed from, and that these\r\nseeds, and the young plants they yield, are as a rule, numerous. Hence\r\nit follows that we are to compare their average and their extremes with\r\nthe qualities of the parents. Both are of practical as well as of\r\ntheoretical interest. The average of the progeny is to be considered as\r\nthe chief result of the selection in the previous generation, while the\r\nextremes, at least those which depart in the same direction, are\r\nobviously the means of further improvement of the race.\r\n\r\nThus our discussion should be divided into [773] two heads. One of these\r\ncomprises the relation of the average of the progeny to the exceptional\r\nqualities of the chosen parent, and the other the relation of\r\nexceptional offspring to the exceptional parents.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the averages first. Are they to be expected to be equal\r\nto the unique quality of the parent, or perhaps to be the same as the\r\naverage of the whole unselected race? Neither of these cases occur.\r\nExperience is clear and definite on this important point. Vilmorin, when\r\nmaking the first selections to improve the amount of sugar in beets, was\r\nstruck with the fact that the average of the progeny lies between that\r\nof the original strain and the quality of the chosen parent. He\r\nexpressed his observation by stating that the progeny are grouped around\r\nand diverge in all directions from some point, placed on the line which\r\nunites their parent with the type from which it sprang. All breeders\r\nagree on this point, and in scientific experiments it has often been\r\nconfirmed. We shall take up some illustrative examples presently, but in\r\norder to make them clear, it is necessary to give a closer consideration\r\nto the results of Vilmorin.\r\n\r\nFrom his experience it follows that the average of the progeny is higher\r\nthan that of the race at large, but lower than the chosen parent. [774]\r\nIn other words, there is a progression and a regression. A progression\r\nin relation to the whole race, and a regression in comparison with the\r\nparent. The significance of this becomes clear at once, if we recall the\r\nconstancy of the variety which could be obtained from the selected\r\nextreme in the case of vegetative multiplication. The progression is\r\nwhat the breeder wants, the regression what he detests. Regression is\r\nthe permanency of part of the mediocrity which the selection was invoked\r\nto overcome. Manifestly it is of the highest interest that the\r\nprogression should be as large, and the regression as small as possible.\r\nIn order to attain this goal the first question is to know the exact\r\nmeasure of progression and regression as they are exhibiting themselves\r\nin the given cases, and the second is to inquire into the influences, on\r\nwhich this proportion may be incumbent.\r\n\r\nAt present our notions concerning the first point are still very limited\r\nand those concerning the second extremely vague. Statistical inquiries\r\nhave led to some definite ideas about the importance of regression, and\r\nthese furnish a basis for experimental researches concerning the causes\r\nof the phenomenon. Very advantageous material for the study of\r\nprogression and regression in the realm of fluctuating variability is\r\nafforded by the [775] ears of corn or maize. The kernels are arranged in\r\nlongitudinal rows, and these rows are observed to occur in varying, but\r\nalways even, numbers. This latter circumstance is due to the fact that\r\neach two neighboring rows contain the lateral branches of a single row\r\nof spikelets, the ages of which however, are included in the fleshy body\r\nof the ear. The variation of the number of the rows is easily seen to\r\ncomply with Quetelet's law, and often 30 or 40 ears suffice to give a\r\ntrustworthy curve. Fritz Muller made some experiments upon the\r\ninheritance of the number of the rows, in Brazil. He chose a race which\r\naveraged 12 rows, selected ears with 14, 16 and 18 rows, etc., and sowed\r\ntheir kernels separately. In each of-these cultures he counted the rows\r\nof the seeds on the ears of all the plants when ripe, and calculated\r\ntheir average. This average, of course, does not necessarily correspond\r\nto a whole number, and fractions should not be neglected.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vilmorin's rule he always found some progression of the\r\naverage and some regression. Both were the larger, the more the\r\nparent-ear differed from the general average, but the proportion between\r\nboth remained the same, and seems independent of the amount of the\r\ndeviation. Putting the deviation at 5, the progression calculated from\r\nhis figures is [776] 2 and the regression 3. In other words the average\r\nof the progeny has gained over the average of the original variety\r\nslightly more than one-third, and slightly less than one-half of the\r\nparental deviation. I have repeated this experiment of Fritz Miller's\r\nand obtained nearly the same regression of three-fifths, though working\r\nwith another variety, and under widely different climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe figures of Fritz Muller were, as given below, in one experiment. In\r\nthe last column I put the improvement calculated for a proportion of\r\ntwo-fifths above the initial average of 12.\r\n\r\n     Rows on    Average of rows    12 + 2/5 of\r\n   parent ears    of progeny       Difference\r\n       14            12.6             12.8\r\n       16            14.1             13.6\r\n       18            15.2             14.4\r\n       20            15.8             15.2\r\n       22            16.1             16.0\r\n\r\nGalton, in his work on natural inheritance, describes an experiment with\r\nthe seeds of the sweet pea or _Lathyrus odoratus_. He determined the\r\naverage size in a lot of purchased seeds, and selected groups of seeds\r\nof different, but for each group constant, sizes. These were sown, and\r\nthe average of the seeds was determined anew in the subsequent harvest\r\nthey yielded. These figures agreed with the rule of Vilmorin and were\r\ncalculated in the manner [777] given for the test of the corn. The\r\nprogression and regression were found to be proportionate to the amount\r\nof the deviation. The progression of the average was one-third, and the\r\nregression in consequence two-thirds of the total deviation. The\r\namelioration is thus seen to be nearly, though not exactly, the same as\r\nin the previous case.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence of the other corresponding experiments, and from\r\nvarious statistical inquiries it seems that the value of the progression\r\nis nearly the same in most cases, irrespective of the species used and\r\nthe quality considered. It may be said to be from one-third to one-half\r\nof the parental deviation, and in this form the statement is obviously\r\nof wide and easy applicability.\r\n\r\nOur figures also demonstrate the great preeminence of vegetative\r\nvarieties above the improved strains multiplied by seeds. They have a\r\ndefinite relation. Asexually multiplied strains may be said to be\r\ngenerally two times or even three times superior to the common\r\noffspring. This is a difference of great practical importance, and\r\nshould never be lost sight of in theoretical considerations of the\r\nproductive capacity of selection. Multiplication by seed however, has\r\none great advantage over the asexual method; it may be repeated. The\r\n[778] selection is not limited to a single choice, but may be applied in\r\ntwo or more succeeding generations. Obviously such a repetition affords\r\na better chance of increasing the progression of the average and of\r\nameliorating the race to a greater degree than would be possible by a\r\nsingle choice. This principle of repeated selection is at present the\r\nprominent feature of race improvement. Next to variety-testing and\r\nhybridizing it is the great source of the steady progression of\r\nagricultural crops. From a practical standpoint the method is clear and\r\nas perfect as might be expected, but this is not the side of the problem\r\nwith which we are concerned here. The theoretical analysis and\r\nexplanation of the results obtained, however, is subject to much doubt,\r\nand to a great divergence of conceptions. So it is also with the\r\napplication of the practical processes to those occurring in nature.\r\nSome assume that here repeated selection is only of subordinate\r\nimportance, while others declare that the whole process of evolution is\r\ndue to this agency. This very important point however, will be reserved\r\nfor the next lecture, and only the facts available at present will be\r\nconsidered here.\r\n\r\nAs a first example we may take the ray-florets of the composites. On a\r\nformer occasion we have dealt with their fluctuation in number and [779]\r\nfound that it is highly variable and complies in the main with\r\nQuetelet's law. _Madia elegans_, a garden species, has on the average 21\r\nrays on each head, fluctuating between 16 and 25 or more. I saved the\r\nseeds of a plant with only 17 rays on the terminal head, and got from\r\nthem a culture which averaged 19 rays, which is the mean between 21 and\r\n17. In this second generation I observed the extremes to be 22 and 12,\r\nand selected a plant with 13 rays as the parent for a continuation of\r\nthe experiment. The plants, which I got from its seeds, averaged 18 and\r\nshowed 22 and 13 as extremes. The total progression of the average was\r\nthus, in two generations, from 21 to 18, and the total regression from\r\n13 to 18, and the proportion is thus seen to diminish by the repetition\r\nrather than to increase.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, however, is of course too imperfect upon which to found\r\ngeneral conclusions. It only proves the important fact that the improved\r\naverage of the second generation is not the starting-point for the\r\nfurther improvement. But the second generation allows a choice of an\r\nextreme, which diverges noticeably more from the mean than any\r\nindividual of the first culture, and thereby gives a larger amount of\r\nabsolute progression, even if the proportion between progression and\r\nregression remains [780] the same. The repetition is only an easy method\r\nof getting more widely deviating extremes; whether it has, besides this,\r\nanother effect, remains doubtful. In order to be able to decide this\r\nquestion, it is necessary to repeat the selection during a series of\r\ngenerations. In this way the individual faults may be removed as far as\r\npossible. I chose an experiment of Fritz Muller, relating to the number\r\nof rows of grains on the ears exactly as in the case above referred to,\r\nand which I have repeated in my experimental garden at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nI started from a variety known to fructify fairly regularly in our\r\nclimate, and exhibiting in the mean 12-14 rows, but varying between 8\r\nand 20 as exceptional cases. I chose an ear with 16 rows and sowed its\r\nseeds in 1887. A number of plants were obtained, from each of which, one\r\near was chosen in order to count its rows. An average of 15 rows was\r\nfound with variations complying with Quetelet's law. One ear reached 22\r\nrows, but had not been fertilized, some others had 20 rows, and the best\r\nof these was chosen for the continuation of the experiment. I repeated\r\nthe sowing during 6 subsequent generations in the same way, choosing\r\neach time the most beautiful ear from among those with the greatest\r\nnumber of rows. Unfortunately with the increase of the number the [781]\r\nsize of the grains decreases, the total amount of nourishment available\r\nfor all of them remaining about the same. Thus the kernels and\r\nconsequently the new plants became smaller and weaker, and the chance of\r\nfertilization was diminished in the ears with the highest number of\r\nrows. Consequently the choice was limited, and after having twice chosen\r\na spike with 20 and once one with 24 rows, I finally preferred those\r\nwith the intermediate number of 22.\r\n\r\nThis repeated choice has brought the average of my race up from 13 to\r\n20, and thus to the extreme limit of the original variety. Seven years\r\nwere required to attain this result, or on an average the progression\r\nwas one row in a year. This augmentation was accompanied by an\r\naccompanying movement of the whole group in the same direction. The\r\nextreme on the side of the small numbers came up from 8 to 12 rows, and\r\ncobs with 8 or 10 rows did not appear in my race later than the third\r\ngeneration. On the other side the extreme reached 28, a figure never\r\nreached by the original variety as cultivated with us, and ears with 24\r\nand 26 rows have been seen during the four last generations in\r\nincreasing numbers.\r\n\r\nThis slow and gradual amelioration was partly due to the mode of\r\npollination of the corn. [782] The pollen falls from the male spikes on\r\nthe ears of the same plant, but also is easily blown on surrounding\r\nspikes. In order to get the required amount of seed it is necessary in\r\nour climate to encroach as little as possible upon free pollination,\r\naiding the self-pollination, but taking no precautions against\r\nintercrossing. It is assumed that the choice of the best ears indicates\r\nthe plants which have had the best pollen-parents as well as the best\r\npistil parents, and that selection here, as in other cases, corrects the\r\nfaults of free intercrossing. But it is granted that this correction is\r\nonly a slow one, and accounts in a great degree for the slowness of the\r\nprogression. Under better climatic conditions and with a more entire\r\nisolation of the individuals, it seems very probable that the same\r\nresult could have been reached in fewer generations.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the fact is that by repeated selection the strain\r\ncan be ameliorated to a greater extent than by a single choice. This\r\nresult completely agrees with the general experience of breeders and the\r\nexample given is only an instance of a universal rule. It has the\r\nadvantage of being capable of being recorded in a numerical way, and of\r\nallowing a detailed and definite description of all the succeeding\r\ngenerations. The entire harvest of all [783] of them has been counted\r\nand the figures combined into curves, which at once show the whole\r\ncourse of the pedigree-experiment. These curves have in the main taken\r\nthe same shape, and have only gradually been moved in the chosen\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThree points are now to be considered in connection with this\r\nexperiment. The first is the size of the cultures required for the\r\nresulting amelioration. In other words, would it have been possible to\r\nattain an average of 20 rows in a single experiment? This is a matter of\r\ncalculation, and the calculation must be based upon the experience\r\nrelated above, that the progression in the case of maize is equal to\r\ntwo-fifths of the parental deviation. A cob with 20 rows means a\r\ndeviation of 7 from the average of 13, the incipient value of my race.\r\nTo reach such an average at once, an ear would be required with 7 x 5/2\r\n= 17-1/2 rows above the average, or an ear with 30-32 rows. These never\r\noccur, but the rule given in a previous lecture gives a method of\r\ncalculating the probability of their occurrence, or in other words, the\r\nnumber of ears required to give a chance of finding such an ear. It\r\nwould take too long to give this calculation here, but I find that\r\napproximately 12,000 ears would be required to give one with 28 rows,\r\nwhich was the highest number attained in [784] my experiment, while\r\n100,000 ears would afford a chance of one with 32 rows*. Had I been able\r\nto secure and inspect this number of ears, perhaps I would have needed\r\nonly a year to get an average of 20 rows. This however, not being the\r\ncase, I have worked for seven years, but on the other hand have\r\ncultivated all in all only about one thousand individuals for the entire\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nObviously this reduction of the size of the experiment is of importance.\r\nOne hundred thousand ears of corn could of course, be secured directly\r\nfrom trade or from some industrial culture, but corn is cultivated only\r\nto a small extent in Holland, and in most cases the requisite number of\r\nindividuals would be larger than that afforded by any single plantation.\r\n\r\nRepeated selection is thereby seen to be the means of reducing the size\r\nof the required cultures to possible measures, not only in the\r\nexperimental-garden, but also for industrial purposes. A selection from\r\namong 60,000-100,000 individuals may be within reach of Burbank, but of\r\nfew others. As a rule they prefer a longer time with a smaller lot of\r\nplants. This\r\n\r\n\r\n * On about 200 ears the variability ranges from 8-22 rows, and\r\n   this leads approximately to one row more by each doubling of\r\n   the numbers of instances. One ear with 22 rows in 200 would\r\n   thus lead to the expectation of one ear with 32 rows in\r\n   100,000 ears.\r\n\r\n[785] is exactly what is gained by repeated selections. To my mind this\r\nreduction of the size of the cultures is probably the sole effect of the\r\nrepetition. But experience is lacking on this point, and exact\r\ncomparisons should be made whenever possible, between the descendants of\r\na unique but extreme choice, and a repeated but smaller selection. The\r\neffect of the repetition on the nourishment of the chosen\r\nrepresentatives should be studied, for it is clear that a plant with 22\r\nrows, the parents and grandparents of which had the same number,\r\nindicates a better condition of internal qualities than one with the\r\nsame number of rows, produced accidentally from the common race. In this\r\nway it may perhaps be possible to explain, why in my experiment an ear\r\nwith 22 rows gave an average offspring with 20, while the calculation,\r\nfounded on the regression alone would require a parental ear with 32\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nHowever, as already stated, this discussion is only intended to convey\r\nsome general idea as to the reduction of the cultures by means of\r\nrepeated selections, as the material at hand is wholly inadequate for\r\nany closer calculation. This important point of the reduction may be\r\nillustrated in still another manner.\r\n\r\nThe sowing of very large numbers is only required because it is\r\nimpossible to tell from the [786] inspection of the seeds which of them\r\nwill yield the desired individual. But what is impossible in the\r\ninspection of the seeds may be feasible, at least in important measure,\r\nin the inspection of the plants which bear the seeds. Whenever such an\r\ninspection demonstrates differences, in manifest connection with the\r\nquality under consideration, any one will readily grant that it would be\r\nuseless to sow the seeds of the worst plants, and that even the whole\r\naverage might be thrown over, if it were only possible to point out a\r\nnumber of the best. But it is clear that by this inspection of the\r\nparent plants the principle of repeated selection is introduced for two\r\nsucceeding generations, and that its application to a larger series of\r\ngenerations is only a question of secondary importance.\r\n\r\nSumming up our discussion of this first point we may assert that\r\nrepeated selection is only selection on a small and practical scale,\r\nwhile a single choice would require numbers of individuals higher than\r\nare ordinarily available.\r\n\r\nA second discussion in connection with our pedigree-culture of corn is\r\nthe question whether the amelioration obtained was of a durable nature,\r\nor only temporary. In other words, whether the progeny of the race would\r\nremain constant, if cultivated after cessation of the selection. In\r\norder to ascertain this, [787] I continued the culture during several\r\ngenerations, choosing ears with less than the average number of rows.\r\nThe excellence of the race at once disappeared, and the ordinary average\r\nof the variety from which I had started seven years before, returned\r\nwithin two or three seasons. This shows that the attained improvement is\r\nneither fixed nor assured and is dependent on continued selection. This\r\nresult only confirms the universal experience of breeders, which teaches\r\nthe general dependency of improved races on continued selection. Here a\r\nstriking contrast with elementary species or true varieties is obvious.\r\nThe strains which nature affords are true to their type; their average\r\ncondition remains the same during all the succeeding generations, and\r\neven if it should be slightly altered by changes in the external\r\nconditions, it returns to the type, as soon as these changes come to an\r\nend. It is a real average, being the sum of the contribution of all the\r\nmembers of the strain. Improved races have only an apparent average,\r\nwhich is in fact biased by the exclusion of whole groups of individuals.\r\nIf left to themselves, their appearance changes, and the real average\r\nsoon returns. This is the common experience of breeders.\r\n\r\nA third point is to be discussed in connection [788] with the detailed\r\npedigree-cultures. It is the question as to what might be expected from\r\na continuation of improvement selection. Would it be possible to obtain\r\nany imaginable deviation from the original type, and to reach\r\nindependency from further selection? This point has not until now\r\nattracted any practical interest, and from a practical point of view and\r\nwithin the limits of ordinary cultures, it seems impossible to obtain a\r\npositive answer. But in the theoretical discussion of the problems of\r\ndescent it has become of the highest importance, and therefore requires\r\na separate treatment, which will be reserved for the next lecture.\r\n\r\nHere we come upon another equally difficult problem. It relates to the\r\nproportion of embryonic or individual fluctuation, to partial variation\r\nas involved in the process of selection. Probably all qualities which\r\nmay be subjected to selection vary according to both principles, the\r\nembryonic decision giving only a more definite average, around which the\r\nparts of the individual are still allowed to oscillate. It is so with\r\nthe corn, and whenever two or more ears are ripening or even only\r\nflowering on the same plant, differences of a partial nature may be seen\r\nin the number of their rows. These fluctuations are only small however,\r\nordinarily not exceeding two and rarely four [789] rows. Choosing always\r\nthe principal ear, the figures may be taken to indicate the degree of\r\npersonal deviation from the average of the race. But whenever we make a\r\nmistake, and perchance sow from an ear, the deviation of which was\r\nlargely due to partial variation, the regression should be expected to\r\nbecome considerably larger. Hence it must be conceded that exact\r\ncalculations of the phenomena of inheritance are subject to much\r\nuncertainty, resulting from our very imperfect knowledge concerning the\r\nreal proportion of the contributing factors, and the difficulty of\r\nascertaining their influence in any given case. Here also we encounter\r\nmore doubts than real facts, and much remains to be done before exact\r\ncalculations may become of real scientific value.\r\n\r\nReturning to the question of the effects of selection in the long run,\r\ntwo essentially different cases are to be considered. Extremes may be\r\nselected from among the variants of ordinary fluctuating variability, or\r\nfrom ever-sporting varieties. These last we have shown to be double\r\nraces. Their peculiar and wide range of variability is due to the\r\nsubstitution of two characters, which exclude one another, or if\r\ncombined, are diminished in various degrees. Striped flowers and stocks,\r\n\"five-leaved\" clover, pistilloid opium-poppies and numerous other [790]\r\nmonstrosities have been dealt with as instances of such ever-sporting\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nNow the question may be put, what would be the effect of selection if in\r\nlong series of years one of the two characters of such a double race\r\nwere preferred continuously, to the complete exclusion of the other.\r\nWould the race become changed thereby? Could it be affected to such a\r\ndegree as to gradually lose the inactive quality, and cease to be a\r\ndouble race?\r\n\r\nHere manifestly we have a means by which to determine what selection is\r\nable to accomplish. Physiologic experiments may be said to be too short\r\nto give any definite evidence. But cases may be cited where nature has\r\nselected during long centuries and with absolute constancy in her\r\nchoice. Moreover unconscious selections by man have often worked in an\r\nanalogous manner, and many cultivated plants may be put to the test\r\nconcerning the evidence they might give on this point. Stating\r\nbeforehand the result of this inquiry, we may assert that long-continued\r\nselection has absolutely no appreciable effect. Of course I do not deny\r\nthe splendid results of selection during the first few years, nor the\r\nnecessity of continued selection to keep the improved races to the\r\nheight of their ameliorated qualities. I only wish to state that the\r\nwork [791] of selection here finds its limit and that centuries and\r\nperhaps geologic periods of continued effort in the same direction are\r\nnot capable of adding anything more to the initial effect. Some\r\nillustrative examples may suffice to prove the validity of this\r\nassertion. Every botanist who has studied the agricultural practice of\r\nplant-breeding, or the causes of the geographic distribution of plants,\r\nwill easily recall to his mind numerous similar cases. Perhaps the most\r\nstriking instance is afforded by cultivated biennial plants. The most\r\nimportant of them are forage-beets and sugar-beets. They are, of course,\r\ncultivated only as biennials, but some annual specimens may be seen each\r\nyear and in nearly every field. They arise from the same seed as the\r\nnormal individuals, and their number is obviously dependent on external\r\nconditions, and especially on the time of sowing. Ordinary cultures\r\noften show as much as 1% of these useless plants, but the exigencies of\r\ntime and available labor often compel the cultivator to have a large\r\npart of his fields sown before spring. In central Europe, where the\r\nclimate is unfavorable at this season, the beets respond by the\r\nproduction of far larger proportions of annual specimens, their number\r\ncoming often up to 20% or more, thus constituting noticeable losses in\r\nthe product [792] of the whole field. Rimpau, who has made a thorough\r\nstudy of this evil and has shown its dependency on various external\r\nconditions, has also tried to find methods of selection with the aim of\r\novercoming it, or at least of reducing it to uninjurious proportions.\r\nBut in these efforts he has reached no practical result. The annuals are\r\nsimply inexterminable.\r\n\r\nComing to the alternative side of the problem it is clear that annuals\r\nhave always been excluded in the selection. Their seeds cannot be mixed\r\nwith the good harvest, not even accidentally, since they have ripened in\r\na previous year. In order to bear seeds in the second year beets must be\r\ntaken from the field, and kept free from frost through the winter. The\r\nfollowing spring they are planted out, and it is obvious that even the\r\nmost careless farmer is not liable to mix them with annual specimens.\r\nHence we may conclude that a strict and unexcelled process of selection\r\nhas been applied to the destruction of this tendency, not only for\r\nsugar-beets, since Vilmorin's time, when selection had become a well\r\nunderstood process, but also for forage-beets since the beginning of\r\nbeet culture. Although unconscious, the selection of biennials must have\r\nbeen uninterrupted and strict throughout many centuries.\r\n\r\nIt has had no effect at all. Annuals are seen [793] to return every\r\nyear. They are ineradicable. Every individual is in the possession of\r\nthis latent quality and liable to convert it into activity as soon as\r\nthe circumstances provoke its appearance, as proved by the increase of\r\nannuals in the early sowings. Hence the conclusion that selection in the\r\nlong run is not adequate to deliver plants from injurious qualities.\r\nOther proofs could be given by other biennials, and among them the stray\r\nannual plants of common carrots are perhaps the most notorious. In my\r\nown cultures of evening-primroses I have preferred the annuals and\r\nexcluded the biennials, but without being able to produce a pure annual\r\nrace. As soon as circumstances are favorable, the biennials return in\r\nlarge numbers. Cereals give analogous proofs. Summer and winter\r\nvarieties have been cultivated separately for centuries, but in trials\r\nit is often easy to convert the one into the other. No real and definite\r\nisolation has resulted from the effect of the long continued unconscious\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nStriped flowers, striped fruits, and especially striped radishes afford\r\nfurther examples. It would be quite superfluous to dwell upon them.\r\nSelection always tends to exclude the monochromatic specimens, but does\r\nnot prevent their return in every generation. Numerous [794] rare\r\nmonstrosities are in the same category, especially when they are of so\r\nrare occurrence as not to give any noticeable contribution to the\r\nseed-production, or even if they render their bearers incapable of\r\nreproduction. In such cases the selection of normal plants is very\r\nsevere or even absolute, but the anomalies are by no means exterminated.\r\nAny favorable circumstances, or experimental selection in their behalf\r\nshows them to be still capable of full development. Numerous cases of\r\nsuch subordinate hereditary characters constitute the greater part of\r\nthe science of vegetable teratology.\r\n\r\nIf it should be objected that all these cases cover too short a time to\r\nbe decisive, or at least fail in giving evidence relative to former\r\ntimes, alpine plants afford a proof which one can hardly expect to be\r\nsurpassed. During the whole present geologic epoch they have been\r\nsubjected to the never failing selection of their climate and other\r\nexternal conditions. They exhibit a full and striking adaptation to\r\nthese conditions, but also possess the latent capacity for assuming\r\nlowland characters as soon as they are transported into such\r\nenvironment. Obviously this capacity never becomes active on the\r\nmountains, and is always counteracted by selection. This agency is\r\nevidently without any effect, for as we have seen when dealing [795]\r\nwith the experiments of Nageli, Bonnier and others, each single\r\nindividual may change its habits and its aspect in response to\r\ntransplantation. The climate has an exceedingly great influence on each\r\nindividual, but the continuance of this influence is without permanent\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nSo much concerning ever-sporting varieties and double adaptations. We\r\nnow come to the effects of a continuous selection of simple characters.\r\n\r\nHere the sugar-beets stand preeminent. Since Vilmorin's time they have\r\nbeen selected according to the amount of sugar in their roots, and the\r\nresult has been the most striking that has ever been attained, if\r\nconsidered from the standpoint of practice. But if critically examined,\r\nwith no other aim than a scientific appreciation of the improvement in\r\ncomparison with other processes of selection, the support of the\r\nevidence for the theory of accumulative influence proves to be very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sugar is expressed by percentage-figures. These however,\r\nare dependent on various causes, besides the real quantity of sugar\r\nproduced. One of these causes is the quantity of watery fluid in the\r\ntissues, and this in its turn is dependent on the culture in dryer or\r\nmoister soil, and on the amount of moisture in the air, and the same\r\nvariety of sugar-beets [796] yields higher percentage-figures in a dry\r\nregion than in a wet one. This is seen when comparing, for instance, the\r\nresults of the analyses from the sandy provinces of Holland with those\r\nfrom the clay-meadows, and it is very well known that Californian beets\r\naverage as high as 26% or more, while the best European beets remain at\r\nabout 20%. As far as I have been able to ascertain, these figures\r\nhowever, are not indicative of any difference of race, but simply direct\r\nresponses to the conditions of climate and of soil.\r\n\r\nApart from these considerations the improvement reached in half a\r\ncentury or in about twenty to thirty generations is not suggestive of\r\nanything absolute. Everything is fluctuating now, even as it was at the\r\noutset, and equally dependent on continual care. Vilmorin has given some\r\nfigures for the beets of the first generations from which he started his\r\nrace. He quotes 14% as a recommendable amount, and 7 and 21 as the\r\nextreme instances of his analyses. However incorrect these figures may\r\nbe, they coincide to a striking degree with the present condition of the\r\nbest European races. Of course minor values are excluded each year by\r\nthe selection, and in consequence the average value has increased. For\r\nthe year 1874 we find a standard of 10-14% considered as normal, [797]\r\nbad years giving 10%, good years from 12% to 14% in the average. Extreme\r\ninstances exceeded 17%. From that time the practice of the polarization\r\nof the juice for the estimate of the sugar has rapidly spread throughout\r\nEurope, and a definite increase of the average value soon resulted. This\r\nhowever, often does not exceed 14%, and beets selected in the field for\r\nthe purpose of polarization come up to an average of 15 to 16%, varying\r\ndownward to less than 10% and upward to 20 and 21%. In the main the\r\nfigures are the same as those of Vilmorin, the range of variability has\r\nnot been reduced, and higher extremes are not reached. An average\r\nincrease of 1% is of great practical importance, and nothing can excel\r\nthe industry and care displayed in the improvement of the beet-races.\r\nNotwithstanding this a lasting influence has not been exercised; the\r\nmethods of selection have been improved, and the number of polarized\r\nbeets has been brought up to some hundreds of thousands in single\r\nfactories, but the improvement is still as dependent upon continuous\r\nselection as it was half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe process is practically very successful, but the support afforded by\r\nit to the selection theory vanishes on critical examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n[798]\r\n\r\nLECTURE XXVIII\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nThe comparison of artificial and natural selection has furnished\r\nmaterial support for the theory of descent, and in turn been the object\r\nof constant criticism since the time of Darwin. The criticisms, in\r\ngreater part, have arisen chiefly from an imperfect knowledge of both\r\nprocesses. By the aid of distinctions recently made possible, the\r\ncontrast between elementary species and improved races has become much\r\nmore vivid, and promises to yield better results on which to base\r\ncomparisons of artificial and natural selection.\r\n\r\nElementary species, as we have seen in earlier lectures, occur in wild\r\nand in cultivated plants. In older genera and systematic species they\r\nare often present in small numbers only, but many of the more recent\r\nwild types and also many of the cultivated forms are very rich in this\r\nrespect. In agriculture the choice of the most adequate elementary forms\r\nfor any special purpose is acknowledged [799] as the first step in the\r\nway of selection, and is designated by the name of variety-testing,\r\napplying the term variety to all the subdivisions of systematic species\r\nindiscriminately. In natural processes it bears the title of survival of\r\nspecies. The fact that recent types show large numbers, and in some\r\ninstances even hundreds of minor constant forms, while the older genera\r\nare considerably reduced in this respect, is commonly explained by the\r\nassumption of extinction of species on a correspondingly large scale.\r\nThis extinction is considered to affect the unfit in a higher measure\r\nthan the fit. Consequently the former vanish, often without leaving any\r\ntrace of their existence, and only those that prove to be sufficiently\r\nadapted to the surrounding external conditions, resist and survive.\r\n\r\nThis selection exhibits far-reaching analogies between the artificial\r\nand the natural processes, and is in both cases of the very highest\r\nimportance. In nature the dying out of unfit mutations is the result of\r\nthe great struggle for life. In a previous lecture we have compared its\r\nagency with that of a sieve. All elements which are too small or too\r\nweak fall through, and only those are preserved which resist the sifting\r\nprocess. Reduced in number they thrive and multiply and are thus enabled\r\nto [800] strike out new mutative changes. These are again submitted to\r\nthe sifting tests, and the frequent repetition of this process is\r\nconsidered to give a good explanation of the manifold, highly\r\ncomplicated, and admirable structures which strike the beginner as the\r\nonly real adaptations in nature.\r\n\r\nExactly in the same way artificial selection isolates and preserves some\r\nelementary species, while it destroys others. Of course the time is not\r\nsufficient to secure new mutations, or at least these are only rare at\r\npresent, and their occurrence is doubtful in historic periods. Apart\r\nfrom this unavoidable difference the analogy between natural and\r\nartificial selection appears to me to be very striking.\r\n\r\nThis form of selection may be termed selection between species. Opposed\r\nto it stands the selection within the elementary species or variety. It\r\nhas of late, alone come to be known as selection, though in reality it\r\ndoes not deserve this distinction. I have already detailed the\r\nhistorical evidence which gives preference to selection between species.\r\nThe process can best be designated by the name of intraspecific\r\nselection, if it is understood that the term intraspecific is meant to\r\napply to the conception of small or elementary species.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to propose new terms, but [801] I think that the principal\r\ndifferences might better become understood by the introduction of the\r\nword election into the discussion of questions of heredity. Election\r\nmeant formerly the preferential choice of single individuals, while the\r\nderivation of the word selection points to a segregation of assemblies\r\ninto their larger parts. Or to state it in a shorter way, individual\r\nselection is exactly what is usually termed election. Choosing one man\r\nfrom among thousands is to elect him, but a select party is a group of\r\nchosen persons. There would be no great difficulty in the introduction\r\nof the word election, as breeders are already in the habit of calling\r\ntheir choice individuals \"elite,\" at least in the case of beets and of\r\ncereals.\r\n\r\nThis intraspecific selection affords a second point for the comparison\r\nbetween natural and artificial processes. This case is readily granted\r\nto be more difficult than the first, but there can be no doubt that the\r\nsimilarity is due to strictly comparable causes. In practice this\r\nprocess is scarcely second in importance to the selection between\r\nspecies, and in numerous cases it rests upon it, and crowns it, bringing\r\nthe isolated forms up to their highest possible degree of usefulness. In\r\nnature it does quite the same, adapting strains of individuals to the\r\nlocal conditions of their environment. Improved [802] races do not\r\ngenerally last very long in practice; sooner or later they are surpassed\r\nby new selections. Exactly so we may imagine the agency of natural\r\nintraspecific selection. It produces the local races, the marks of which\r\ndisappear as soon as the special external conditions cease to act. It is\r\nresponsible only for the smallest lateral branches of the pedigree, but\r\nhas nothing in common with the evolution on the main stems. It is of\r\nvery subordinate importance.\r\n\r\nThese assertions of course, are directly opposed to the current run of\r\nscientific belief, but they are supported by facts. A considerable part\r\nof the evidence has already been dealt with and for our closing\r\ndiscussion only an exact comparison remains to be made between the two\r\ndetailed types of intraspecific selection. In coming to this I will\r\nfirst dwell upon some intermediate types and conclude with a critical\r\ndiscussion of the features of artificial selection, which to my mind\r\nprove the invalidity of the conclusions drawn from it in behalf of an\r\nexplanation of the processes of nature.\r\n\r\nNatural selection occurs not only in the wild state, but is also active\r\nin cultivated fields. Here it regulates the struggle of the selected\r\nvarieties and improved races with the older types, and even with the\r\nwild species. In a previous [803] lecture I have detailed the rapid\r\nincrease of the wild oats in certain years, and described the\r\nexperiments of Risler and Rimpau in the running out of select varieties.\r\nThe agency is always the same. The preferred forms, which give a larger\r\nharvest, are generally more sensitive to injurious influences, more\r\ndependent on rich manure and on adequate treatment. The native varieties\r\nhave therefore the advantage, when climatic or cultural conditions are\r\nunfavorable for the fields at large. They suffer in a minor degree, and\r\nare thereby enabled to propagate themselves afterwards more rapidly and\r\nto defeat the finer types. This struggle for life is a constant one, and\r\ncan easily be followed, whenever the composition of a strain is noted in\r\nsuccessive years. It is well appreciated by breeders and farmers,\r\nbecause it is always liable to counteract their endeavors and to claim\r\ntheir utmost efforts to keep their races pure. There can be no doubt\r\nthat exactly the same struggle exempt from man's intrusion is fought out\r\nin the wild state.\r\n\r\nLocal races of wild plants have not been the object for field\r\nobservations recently. Some facts however, are known concerning them. On\r\nthe East Friesian Islands in the North Sea the flowers are strikingly\r\nlarger and brighter colored than those of the same species on the [804]\r\nneighboring continent. This local difference is ascribed by Behrens to a\r\nmore severe selection by the pollinating insects in consequence of their\r\nlesser frequency on these very windy isles. Seeds of the pines from the\r\nHimalayas yield cold-resisting young plants if gathered from trees in a\r\nhigh altitude, while the seeds of the same species from lower regions\r\nyield more sensitive seedlings. Similar instances are afforded by\r\n_Rhododendron_ and other mountain species. According to Cieslar\r\ncorresponding differences are shown by seeds of firs and larches from\r\nalpine and lowland provinces.\r\n\r\nSuch changes are directly dependent on external influences. This is\r\nespecially manifest in experiments extending the cultures in higher or\r\nin more northern regions. The shorter summer is a natural agent of\r\nselection; it excludes all individuals which cannot ripen their seeds\r\nduring so short a period. Only the short lived ones survive. Schubeler\r\nmade very striking experiments with corn and other different cereals,\r\nand has succeeded in making their culture possible in regions of Norway\r\nwhere it formerly failed. In the district of Christiania, corn had\r\nwithin some few years reduced its lifetime from 123 to 90 days, yielding\r\nsmaller stems and fewer kernels, but still sufficient to make its\r\nculture profitable under the existing conditions. [805] This change was\r\nnot permanent, but was observed to diminish rapidly and to disappear\r\nentirely, whenever the Norwegian strain was cultivated in the southern\r\npart of Germany. It was a typical improved race, dependent on continual\r\nselection by the short summers which had produced it. Similar results\r\nhave been reached by Von Wettstein in the comparison of kinds of flax\r\nfrom different countries. The analogy between such cultivated local\r\nraces and the local races of nature is quite striking. The practice of\r\nseed exchange rests for a large part on the experience that the\r\ncharacters, acquired under the definite climatic and cultural conditions\r\nof some select regions, hold good for one or two, and sometimes even\r\nmore generations, before they decrease to practical uselessness. The\r\nProbstei, the Hanna and other districts owe their wealth to this\r\ntemporary superiority of their wheat and other cereals.\r\n\r\nLeaving these intermediate forms of selection, we now come to our\r\nprincipal point. It has already been discussed at some length in the\r\nprevious lecture, but needs further consideration. It is the question\r\nwhether intraspecific selection may be regarded as a cause of lasting\r\nand ever-increasing improvement. This is assumed by biologists who\r\nconsider fluctuating variability as the main source of progression [806]\r\nin the organic world. But the experience of the breeders does not\r\nsupport this view, since the results of practice prove that selection\r\naccording to a constant standard soon reaches a limit which it is not\r\ncapable of transgressing. In order to attain further improvements the\r\nmethod of selection itself must be improved. A better and sharper method\r\nassures the choice of more valuable representatives of the race, even if\r\nthese must be sought for in far larger numbers of individuals, as is\r\nindicated by the law of Quetelet.\r\n\r\nContinuous or even prolonged improvement of a cultivated race is not the\r\nresult of frequently repeated selection, but of the improvement of the\r\nstandard of appreciation. Nature, as far as we know, changes her\r\nstandard from time to time only in consequence of the migrations of the\r\nspecies, or of local changes of climate. Afterwards the new standard\r\nremains unchanged for centuries.\r\n\r\nSelection, according to a constant standard, reaches its results in few\r\ngenerations. The experience of Van Mons and other breeders of apples\r\nshows that the limit of size and lusciousness may be soon attained.\r\nVilmorin's experiments with wild carrots and those of Carriere with\r\nradishes lead to the same conclusion as regards roots. Improvements of\r\nflowers in [807] size and color are usually easy and rapid in the\r\nbeginning, but an impassable limit is soon reached. Numerous other\r\ninstances could be given.\r\n\r\nContrasted with these simple cases is the method of selecting sugar\r\nbeets. More than once I have alluded to this splendid example of the\r\ninfluence of man upon domestic races, and tried to point out how little\r\nsupport it affords to the current scientific opinion concerning the\r\npower of natural selection. For this reason it is interesting to see how\r\na gradual development of the methods of selection has been, from the\r\nvery outset, one of the chief aims of the breeders. None of them doubts\r\nthat an improvement of the method alone is adequate to obtain results.\r\nThis result, in the main, is the securing of a few percent more of\r\nsugar, a change hardly comparable with that progress in evolution, which\r\nour theories are destined to explain.\r\n\r\nVilmorin's original method was a very simple one. Polarization was still\r\nundiscovered in his time. He determined the specific weight of his\r\nbeets, either by weighing them as a whole, or by using a piece cut from\r\nthe base of the roots and deprived of its bark, in order to test only\r\nthe sugar tissues. The pieces were floated in solutions of salt, which\r\nwere diluted until the pieces [808] began to sink. Their specific weight\r\nat that moment was determined and considered to be a measure of the\r\ncorresponding value of the beet. This principle was afterwards improved\r\nin two ways. The first was a selection after the salt solution method,\r\nbut performed on a large scale. After some few determinations, a\r\nsolution was made of such strength as to allow the greater number of the\r\nbeets to float, and only the best to sink down. In large vessels\r\nthousands of beets could be tested in this way, to select a few of the\r\nvery heaviest. The other improvement was the determination of the\r\nspecific weight of the sap, pressed out from the tissue. It was more\r\ntedious and more expensive, but more direct, as the influence of the air\r\ncavities of the tissue was excluded. It prepared the way for\r\npolarization.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced about the year 1874 in Germany, and soon became\r\ngenerally accepted. It allowed the amount of sugar to be measured\r\ndirectly, and with but slight trouble. Thousands of beets could be\r\ntested yearly by this method, and the best selected for the production\r\nof seed. In some factories a standard percentage is determined by\r\nprevious inquiries, and the mass of the beets is tested only by it. In\r\nothers the methods of taking samples and clearing the sap have been\r\nimproved so far as to allow the [809] exact determination of three\r\nhundred thousand polarization values of beets within a few weeks. Such\r\nfigures give the richest material for statistical studies, and at once\r\nindicate the best roots, while they enable the breeder to change his\r\nstandard in accordance with the results at any time. Furthermore they\r\nallow the mass of the beets to be divided into groups of different\r\nquality, and to produce, besides the seeds for the continuation of the\r\nrace, a first class and second-class product and so on. In the factory\r\nof Messrs. Kuhn & Co., at Naarden, Holland, the grinding machine has\r\nbeen markedly improved, so as to tear all cell walls asunder, open all\r\ncells, and secure the whole of the sap within less than a minute, and\r\nwithout heating.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to go into further details, or to describe the\r\nsimultaneous changes that have been applied to the culture of the elite\r\nstrains. The detailed features suffice to show that the chief care of\r\nthe breeder in this case is a continuous amelioration of the method of\r\nselecting. It is manifest that the progression of the race is in the\r\nmain due to great technical improvements, and not solely to the\r\nrepetition of the selection.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts may be seen on all the great lines of industrial\r\nselection. An increasing appreciation [810] of all the qualities of the\r\nselected plants is the common feature. Morphological characters, and the\r\ncapacity of yielding the desired products, are the first points that\r\nstrike the breeder. The relation to climate and the dependence on manure\r\nsoon follow; but the physiological and chemical sides of the problem are\r\nusually slow of recognition in the methods of selection. When visiting\r\nMr. de Vilmorin at Paris some years ago, I inspected his laboratory for\r\nthe selection of potatoes. In the method in use, the tubers were rubbed\r\nto pulp and the starch was extracted and measured. A starch percentage\r\nfigure was determined for each plant, and the selection of the tubers\r\nfor planting was founded upon this result. In the same way wheat has\r\nbeen selected by Dippe at Quedlinburg, first by a determination of its\r\nnitrogenous contents in general, and secondly by the amount of the\r\nsubstances which determine its value for baking purposes.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated rye of Schlanstedt was produced by the late Mr. Rimpau in\r\na similar manner and was put on the market between 1880 and 1890 and was\r\nreceived with great favor throughout central Europe, especially in\r\nGermany and in France. It is a tall variety, with vigorous stems and\r\nvery long heads, the kernels of which are nearly double the size of\r\nthose of the [811] ordinary rye, and are seen protruding, when ripe,\r\nfrom between the scales of the spikelets. It is unfit for poor soils,\r\nbut is one of the very best varieties for soils of medium fertility in a\r\ntemperate climate. It is equal in the production of grain to the best\r\nFrench sorts, but far surpassing them in its amount of straw. It was\r\nperfected at the farm of Schlanstedt very slowly, according to the\r\ncurrent conceptions of the period. The experiment was started in the\r\nyear 1866, at which time Rimpau collected the most beautiful heads from\r\namong his fields, and sowed their kernels in his experiment garden. From\r\nthis first culture the whole race was derived. Every year the best ears\r\nof the strain were chosen for repeated culture, under experimental care,\r\nwhile the remainder was multiplied in a field to furnish the seeds for\r\nlarge and continually increasing areas of his farms.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years were required to produce the quantity of seed of each\r\nkind required for all the fields of Schlanstedt. The experiment garden,\r\nwhich through the kindness of Mr. Rimpau I had the good fortune of\r\nvisiting more than once between 1875 and 1878, was situated in the\r\nmiddle of his farm, at some distance from the dwellings. Of course it\r\nwas treated with more care, and especially kept [812] in better\r\nconditions of fertility than was possible for the fields at large. A\r\ncontinued study of the qualities and exigencies of the elite plants\r\naccompanied this selection, and gave the means of gradually increasing\r\nthe standard. Resistance against disease was observed and other\r\nqualities were ameliorated in the same manner. Mr. Rimpau repeatedly\r\ntold me that he was most anxious not to overlook any single character,\r\nbecause he feared that if any of them might become selected in the wrong\r\nway, perchance unconsciously, the whole strain might suffer to such a\r\ndegree as to make all the other ameliorations quite useless. With this\r\npurpose the number of plants per acre was kept nearly the same as those\r\nin the fields, and the size of the culture was large enough every year\r\nto include the best kernels of quite a number of heads. These were never\r\nseparated, and exact individual pedigrees were not included in the plan.\r\nThis mixture seemed to have the advantage of keeping up an average value\r\nof the larger number of the characters, which either from their nature\r\nor from their apparent unimportance had necessarily to be neglected.\r\n\r\nAfter ten years of continuous labor, the rye of Rimpau caught the\r\nattention of his neighbors, being manifestly better than that of\r\nordinary [813] sowings. Originally he had made his cultures for the\r\nimprovement of his own fields only. Gradually however, he began to sell\r\nhis product as seed to others, though he found the difference still very\r\nslight. After ten years more, about 1886, he was able to sell all his\r\nrye as seed, thereby making of course large profits. It is now\r\nacknowledged as one of the best sorts, though in his last letter Mr.\r\nRimpau announced to me that the profits began to decline as other\r\nselected varieties of rye became known. The limit of productiveness was\r\nreached, and to surmount this, selection had to be begun again from some\r\nnew and better starting point.\r\n\r\nThis new starting point invokes quite another principle of selection, a\r\nprinciple which threatens to make the contrast between artificial and\r\nnatural selection still greater. In fact it is nothing new, being in use\r\nformerly in the selection of domestic animals, and having been applied\r\nby Vilmorin to his sugar beets more than half a century ago. Why it\r\nshould ever have been overlooked and neglected in the selection of sugar\r\nbeets now is not clear.\r\n\r\n The principle in itself is very simple. It agrees that the visible\r\n characters of an animal or a plant are only an imperfect measure for\r\n its hereditary qualities, instead of being the real criterion to be\r\n relied upon, as is the current belief. [814] It further reasons that a\r\n direct appreciation of the capacity of inheritance can only be derived\r\n from the observation of the inheritance itself. Hence it concludes that\r\n the average value of the offspring is the only real standard by which\r\n to judge the representatives of a race and to found selection upon.\r\n\r\nThese statements are so directly opposed to views prevalent among plant\r\nbreeders, that it seems necessary to deal with them from the theoretical\r\nand experimental, as well as from the practical side.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical arguments rest on the division of the fluctuating\r\nvariability into the two large classes of individual or embryonic, and\r\nof partial deviations. We have dealt with this division at some length\r\nin the previous lecture. It will be apparent at once, if we choose a\r\ndefinite example. Let us ask what is the real significance of the\r\npercentage figure of a single plant in sugar beets. This value depends\r\nin the first place, on the strain or family from which the beet has been\r\nderived, but this primary point may be neglected here, because it is the\r\nsame for all the beets of any lot, and determines the average, around\r\nwhich all are fluctuating.\r\n\r\nThe deviation of the percentage figure of a single beet depends on two\r\nmain groups of external [815] causes. First come those that have\r\ninfluenced the young germs of the plant during its most sensitive\r\nperiod, when still an embryo within the ripening seed. They give a new\r\nlimitation to the average condition, which once and forever becomes\r\nfixed for this special individual. In the second place the young\r\nseedling is affected during the development of its crown of leaves, and\r\nof its roots, by numerous factors, which cannot change this average, but\r\nmay induce deviations from it, increasing or decreasing the amount of\r\nsugar, which will eventually be laid down in the root. The best young\r\nbeet may be injured in many ways during periods of its lifetime, and\r\nproduce less sugar than could reasonably be expected from it. It may be\r\nsurpassed by beets of inferior constitution, but growing under more\r\nfavorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nConsidered from this point of view the result of the polarization test\r\nis not a single value, but consists of at least two different factors.\r\nIt may be equal to the algebraic sum of these, or to their difference,\r\naccording to whether the external conditions on the field were locally\r\nand individually favorable or unfavorable. A large amount of sugar may\r\nbe due to high individual value, with slight subsequent deviation from\r\nit, [816] or to a less prominent character combined with an extreme\r\nsubordinate deviation.\r\n\r\nHence it is manifest that even the results of such a highly improved\r\ntechnical method do not deserve the confidence usually put in them. They\r\nare open to doubt, and the highest figures do not really indicate the\r\nbest representatives of the race. In order to convey this conception to\r\nyou in a still stronger manner, let us consider the partial variability\r\nas it usually shows itself. The various leaves of a plant may noticeably\r\nvary in size, the flowers in color, the fruits in flavor. They fluctuate\r\naround an average, which is assumed to represent the approximate value\r\nof the whole plant. But if we were allowed to measure only one leaf, or\r\nto estimate only one flower or fruit, and be compelled to conclude from\r\nit the worth of the whole plant, what mistakes we could make! We might\r\nindeed hit upon an average case, but we might as easily get an extreme,\r\neither in the way of increase or of decrease. In both cases our judgment\r\nwould be badly founded. Now who can assure us that the single root of a\r\ngiven beet is an average representative of the partial variability? The\r\nfact that there is only one main root does not prove anything. An annual\r\nplant has only one stem, but a perennial species has many. The average\r\nheight of the last is a [817] reliable character, but the casual height\r\nof the former is very uncertain.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the beets. A beet may be divided by its buds and give\r\nquite a number of roots, belonging to the same individual. These\r\nsecondary roots have been tested for the amount of sugar, and found to\r\nexhibit a manifest degree of variability. If the first root corresponded\r\nto their average, it might be considered as reliable, but if not anyone\r\nwill grant that an average is more reliable than a single determination.\r\nDeviations have as a fact been observed, proving the validity of our\r\nassertion. These considerations at once explain the disappointment so\r\noften experienced by breeders. Some facts may be quoted from the Belgian\r\nprofessor of agriculture at Gembloux, the late Mr. Laurent. He selected\r\ntwo beets, from a strain, with the exceptional amount of 23% sugar, but\r\nkept their offspring separate and analyzed some 60 of each. In both\r\ngroups the average was only 11-12%, the extremes not surpassing 14-15%.\r\nEvidently the choice was a bad one, notwithstanding the high\r\npolarization value of the parent. Analogous cases are often observed,\r\nand my countrymen, Messrs. Kuhn & Co., go so far as to doubt all\r\nexcessive variants, and to prefer beets with high, but less\r\nextraordinary percentages. Such are to be had in larger numbers [818]\r\nand their average has a good chance of exemption from a considerable\r\nportion of the doubts adhering to single excessive cases.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note here what Louis de Vilmorin taught concerning this\r\npoint in the year 1850. I quote his own words: \"I have observed that in\r\nexperiments on heredity it is necessary to individualize as much as\r\npossible. So I have taken to the habit of saving and sowing separately\r\nthe seeds of every individual beet, and I have always found that among\r\nthe chosen parent plants some had an offspring with a better average\r\nyield than others. At the end I have come to consider this character\r\nonly, as a standard for amelioration.\"\r\n\r\nThe words are clear and their author is the originator of the whole\r\nmethod of plant breeding selection. Yet the principle has been\r\nabandoned, and nearly forgotten under the impression that polarization\r\nalone was the supreme guide to be relied upon. However, if I understand\r\nthe signs rightly, the time is soon coming when Vilmorin's experience\r\nwill become once more the foundation for progress in breeding.\r\n\r\nLeaving the theoretical and historical aspects of the problem, we will\r\nnow recall the experimental evidence, given in a former lecture, dealing\r\nwith the inheritance of monstrosities. I have shown that in many\r\ninstances monstrosities [819] constitute double races, consisting of\r\nmonstrous and of normal individuals. At first sight one might be induced\r\nto surmise that the monstrous ones are the true representatives of the\r\nrace, and that their seeds should be exclusively sown, in order to keep\r\nthe strain up to its normal standard. One might even suppose that the\r\nnormal individuals, or the so-called atavists, had really reverted to\r\nthe original type of the species and that their progeny would remain\r\ntrue to this.\r\n\r\nMy experiments, however, have shown that quite the contrary is the case.\r\nNo doubt, the seeds of the monstrous specimens are trustworthy, but the\r\nseeds of the atavists are not less so. Fasciated hawkweeds and twisted\r\nteasels gave the same average constitution of the offspring from highly\r\nmonstrous, and from apparently wholly normal individuals. In other words\r\nthe fullest development of the visible characteristic was not in the\r\nslightest degree an indication of better hereditary tendencies. In\r\nunfavorable years a whole generation of a fasciated race may exhibit\r\nexclusively normal plants, without transmitting a trace of this\r\ndeficiency to the following generation. As soon as the suitable\r\nconditions return, the monstrosity reassumes its full development. The\r\naccordance of these facts with the experience [820] of breeders of\r\ndomestic animals, and of Louis de Vilmorin, and with the result of the\r\ntheoretical considerations concerning the factors of fluctuation has led\r\nme to suggest the method of selecting, which I have made use of in my\r\nexperiments with tricotyls and syncotyls.\r\n\r\nSeedling variations afford a means of counting many hundreds of\r\nindividuals in a single germinating pan. If seed from one parent plant\r\nis sown only in each pan, a percentage figure for the amount of\r\ndeviating seedlings may be obtained. These figures we have called the\r\nhereditary percentages. I have been able to select the parent plants\r\nafter their death on the sole ground of these values. And the result has\r\nbeen that from varieties which, on an average, exhibited 50-55%\r\ndeviating seedlings, after one or two years of selection this proportion\r\nin the offspring was brought up to about 90% in most of the cases.\r\n_Phacelia_ and mercury with tricotylous seedlings, and the Russian\r\nsunflower with connate seed leaves, may be cited as instances.\r\n\r\nBesides these tests, others were performed, based only on the visible\r\ncharacters of the seedlings. The result was that this characteristic was\r\nalmost useless as a criterion. The atavists gave, in the main, nearly\r\nthe same hereditary percentages as the tricotyls and syncotyls, and\r\n[821] their extremes were in each case far better constituted than the\r\naverage of the chosen type. Hence, for selection purposes, the atavists\r\nmust be considered to be in no way inferior to the typical specimens.\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible to apply this principle to twisted and fasciated\r\nplants, and perhaps even to other monstrosities, I think that it will\r\nreadily be granted that the chance of bringing even these races up to a\r\npercentage of 90% would have been large enough. But the large size of\r\nthe cultures required for the counting of numerous groups of offspring\r\nin the adult state has deterred me from making such trials. Recently\r\nhowever, I have discovered a species, _Viscaria oculata_ which allows of\r\ncounting twisted specimens in the pans, and I may soon be able to obtain\r\nproofs of this assertion. The validity of the hereditary percentage as a\r\nstandard of selection has, within the last few years, been recognized\r\nand defended by two eminent breeders, W.A. Hays in this country and Von\r\nLochow in Germany. Both of them have started from the experience of\r\nbreeders of domestic animals. Von Lochow applied the principle to rye.\r\nHe first showed how fallacious the visible characters often are. For\r\ninstance the size of the kernels is often dependent on their number in\r\nthe head, and if this number is [822] reduced by the injurious varietal\r\nmark of lacunae (Luckigkeit), the whole harvest will rapidly deteriorate\r\nby the selection of the largest kernels from varieties which are not\r\nquite free from this hereditary deficiency.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the value of his rye plants, he gathers the seed of\r\neach one separately and sows them in rows. Each row corresponds to a\r\nparent plant and receives 200 or 150 seeds, according to the available\r\nquantity. In this way from 700 to 800 parent plants are tested yearly.\r\nEach row is harvested separately. The number of plants gives the average\r\nmeasure of resistance to frost, this being the only important cause of\r\nloss. Then the yield in grain and straw is determined and calculated,\r\nand other qualities are taken into consideration. Finally one or more\r\ngroups stand prominent above all others and are chosen for the\r\ncontinuation of the race. All other groups are wholly excluded from the\r\n\"elite,\" but among them the best groups and the very best individuals\r\nfrom lesser groups are considered adequate for further cultivation, in\r\norder to produce the commercial product of the race.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the rye of Von Lochow is now one of the best\r\nvarieties, and even surpasses the celebrated variety of Schlanstedt. It\r\nwas only after obtaining proof of the validity [823] of his method that\r\nVon Lochow decided to give it to the public.\r\n\r\nW.M. Hays has made experiments with wheat at the Minnesota Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station. He chose a hundred grains as a proper number for the\r\nappreciation of each parent plant, and hence has adopted the name of\r\n\"centgener power\" for the hereditary percentage.\r\n\r\nThe average of the hundred offspring is the standard to judge the parent\r\nby. Experience shows at once that this average is not at all\r\nproportional to the visible qualities of the parent. Hence the\r\nconclusion that the yield of the parent plant is a very uncertain\r\nindication of its value as a parent for the succeeding generation. Only\r\nthe parents with the largest power in the centgener of offspring are\r\nchosen, while all others are wholly discarded. Afterwards the seeds of\r\nthe chosen groups are propagated in the field until the required\r\nquantities of seed are obtained.\r\n\r\nThis centgener power, or breeding ability, is tested and compared for\r\nthe various parent plants as to yield, grade, and percentage of\r\nnitrogenous content in the grain, and as to the ability of the plant to\r\nstand erect, resist rust, and other important qualities. It is evident\r\nthat by this test of a hundred specimens a far better [824] and much\r\nmore reliable determination can be made than on the ground of the\r\nminutest examination of one single plant. From this point of view the\r\nmethod of Hays commands attention. But the chief advantage lies in the\r\nfact that it is a direct proof of that which it is desired to prove,\r\nwhile the visible marks give only very indirect information.\r\n\r\nThus the results of the men of practice are in full accordance with\r\nthose of theory and scientific experiment, and there can be little doubt\r\nthat they open the way for a rapid and important improvement. Once\r\nattained, progress however, will be dependent on the selection\r\nprinciple, and the hereditary percentage, or centgener power or breeding\r\nability, must be determined in each generation anew. Without this the\r\nrace would soon regress to its former condition.\r\n\r\nTo return to our starting point, the comparison of artificial and\r\nnatural selection. Here we are at once struck by the fact that it is\r\nhardly imaginable, how nature can make use of this principle. In some\r\nmeasure the members of the best centgener will manifestly be at an\r\nadvantage, because they contain more fit specimens than the other\r\ngroups. But the struggle for existence goes on between individuals, and\r\nnot between groups of brethren against groups of [825] cousins. In every\r\ngroup the best adapted individuals will survive, and soon the breeding\r\ndifferences between the parents must vanish altogether. Manifestly they\r\ncan, as a rule, have no lasting result on the issue of the struggle far\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIf now we remember that in Darwin's time this principle, breeding\r\nability, enjoyed a far more general appreciation than at present, and\r\nthat Darwin must have given it full consideration, it becomes at once\r\nclear that this old, but recently revived principle, is not adequate to\r\nsupport the current comparison between artificial and natural selection.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, summing up all our arguments, we may state that there is\r\na broad analogy between breeding selection in the widest sense of the\r\nword, including variety testing, race improvement and the trial of the\r\nbreeding ability on one side, and natural selection on the other. This\r\nanalogy however, points to the importance of the selection between\r\nelementary species, and the very subordinate role of intraspecific\r\nselection in nature. It strongly supports our view of the origin of\r\nspecies by mutation instead of continuous selection. Or, to put it in\r\nthe terms chosen lately by Mr. Arthur Harris in a friendly criticism of\r\nmy views: \"Natural selection may explain the survival [826] of the\r\nfittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n_Abies concolor fastigiata_, 618\r\n_Acacia_, 176, 196, 217, 458, 697\r\n     bastard, 343, 617, 618, 664, 665, 666\r\n_Acer compestre nanum_,
