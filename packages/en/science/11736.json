In a \"selected paper\" contributed to the\r\nvolume of these proceedings just published, Mr. Jorge Rademaker Grunewald,\r\nMemb. Inst. C.E., describes the work as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIADUCT OVER THE RETIRO, BRAZIL.]\r\n\r\nThis viaduct was constructed in the year 1875, according to designs\r\nfurnished by the author, for the purpose of passing the Dom Pedro Segundo\r\nState Railway over the valley which forms the bed of the river Retiro, a\r\nsmall confluent on the left bank of the river Parahybuna. It is 265\r\nkilometers (165 miles) from Rio de Janeiro, and about 10 kilometers (6.4\r\nmiles) from the city of Juiz de Fora, in the province of Minas Geraes,\r\nBrazil. It has a curve of 382 meters (1,253 ft.) radius, and a gradient of\r\n1 in 83.3. Its total length is 109 meters (357 ft. 7 in.); width between\r\nhandrails, 4 meters (13 ft.); and greatest height above the bed of the\r\nriver, 20 meters (65 ft. 7 in.).\r\n\r\nThe viaduct is composed of seven semicircular arches, each end arch being\r\nbuilt of ashlar masonry, and of 6 meters (19 ft. 8 in.) diameter; five\r\nintermediate arches, 15 meters (49 ft. 2 in.) in diameter, are of iron. The\r\nfour central piers are of iron erected on pillars of ashlar masonry. The\r\nmetallic part of this viaduct is 80 meters (262 ft. 6 in.) long, and is\r\nconstructed in the following manner: The arches, and the longitudinal\r\ngirders which they support, are made of two Barlow rails riveted together,\r\nwith an iron plate ½ inch thick placed between them. The spandrels are\r\nformed of uprights and diagonals, the former being made of four\r\nangle-irons, and the latter of one angle-iron. Each pair of arches,\r\nlongitudinal girders and uprights, is transversely 3 meters (9 ft. 10 in.)\r\nfrom center to center, and is connected by cross and diagonal bracing. On\r\nthe top of the longitudinal girders are fixed cross pieces of single Barlow\r\nrails, upon which again are fastened two longitudinals of wood 12 in.\r\nsquare in section, and which in their turn carry the rails of the permanent\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe gauge of the Dom Pedro Segundo Railway is 1.60 meters, or 5 ft. 3 in.\r\nnearly, between the rails. At each end of the transverse Barlow rails is\r\nfixed the customary simple iron handrail, carried by light cast-iron\r\nstandards. The iron piers are each formed of four columns, and the columns\r\nconsist of two Barlow rails, with a slotted iron plate ½ inch thick let in\r\nbetween the rails, and the whole being riveted together connects each pair\r\nof side columns.\r\n\r\nThe details show the system of cross and diagonal bracing. The columns are\r\neach supported by four buttresses formed of plates and angle-irons. These\r\nbuttresses, fastened with bolts 8 ft. 3 in. long, let into the masonry\r\npillars, secure the stability of the viaduct against lateral strains, due\r\nmostly to the centrifugal force caused by the passage of the trains.\r\n\r\nThe Barlow rails, which constitute the peculiarity of the structure, are\r\nfrom those taken up from the permanent way when the Vignoles pattern of\r\nrail was adopted on this railway. The whole of the foundations were built\r\nwithout difficulty. The principal parts of the iron work were calculated to\r\nresist the strains resulting from a weight of 4 tons 8 cwt. per lineal\r\nmeter traveling over the viaduct at a velocity of 60 kilometers, or about\r\n37 miles, per hour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its fragile appearance this viaduct has, up to the present\r\ntime, served in a most satisfactory manner the purpose for which it was\r\nbuilt.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-GOING TORPEDO BOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll investigations of the sea-going qualities of torpedo boats show that\r\nwhile the basin experiments are highly satisfactory, those made at sea\r\nprove with equal force the unreliability of these craft when they leave the\r\ncoast. At the beginning of the Milford Haven operations, the boisterous\r\nweather necessitated the postponing of operations, on account of the\r\nunfitness of the torpedo boat crews to continue work after the twelve hours\r\nof serious fatigue they had already undergone. In the French evolutions,\r\nthe difficulties of the passage from Bastia to Ajaccio, although not\r\nremarkably severe, so unfitted fifteen of the twenty boats that they could\r\ntake no part in the final attack. In two nights we find recorded collisions\r\nwhich disable boats Nos. 52, 61, 63, and 72, and required their return to\r\nport for repairs.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-two torpedo boats leaving Toulon a few days before, but six\r\narrived near the enemy, although their commanders displayed admirable\r\nenergy. One had run aground, and was full of water; another had been sunk\r\nby collision; another's engine was seriously injured; and as for the rest,\r\nthey could not follow.\r\n\r\nOf the boats under the command of Admiral Brown de Colstoun, but five\r\nremained for service, for the sixth received an accident to her machinery\r\nwhich prevented her taking part in the attack.\r\n\r\nDuring the operations off the Balearic Isles, only one of six boats\r\nattacked, and none was able to follow the armorclads, all meeting with\r\ncircumstances quite unexpected and embarrassing.\r\n\r\nWith the weather as it existed May 13, the armorclads had the torpedo fleet\r\ncompletely at their mercy, for even if they had not been destroyed by the\r\nexcellent practice of the Hotchkiss gunners, they would have been of no\r\nuse, as they could not with safety discharge their torpedoes. In fact, the\r\nsearch lights discovered distinctly that one of the boats, which burned her\r\nCoston's signal to announce victory, did not have her torpedo tube open, on\r\naccount of the heavy sea.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, their positions were frequently easily discovered by the\r\nimmense volume of smoke and flame ejected while going at great speed. This\r\napplies as well by night as by day. It was also reported that after the\r\nfour days' running the speed of the boats was reduced to twelve knots.\r\n\r\nWith such evidence before us, the seaworthiness of boats of the Nos. 63 and\r\n64 type may be seriously questioned. Weyl emphasizes the facts that\r\n\"practice has shown that boats of No. 61 type cannot make headway in a\r\nheavy sea, and that it is then often impossible to open their torpedo\r\ntubes. On this account they are greatly inferior to ships of moderate\r\ntonnage, which can certainly make some progress, fire their torpedoes, and\r\nuse their artillery in weather when a torpedo boat will be utterly\r\nhelpless. The torpedo boat abandoned to itself has a very limited field of\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nDu Pin de Saint Andre admits the success of the torpedo boat for harbor and\r\ncoast work, but wisely concludes that this can prove nothing as to what\r\nthey may or may not be able to do at sea.\r\n\r\nIn an article which appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ in June last,\r\nhe presented able reasons why the torpedo boats of to-day's type, being\r\ndestitute of most, if not all, of the requisites of sea-going craft, cannot\r\ngo to sea, take care of themselves, and remain there prepared to attack an\r\nenemy wherever he may be found. Invisibility to an enemy may facilitate\r\nattack, but it has to be dearly paid for in diminished safety. Further, the\r\nlife that must be led in such vessels in time of war would very quickly\r\nunfit men for their hazardous duties.\r\n\r\nHe points out that the effect of such a life upon the bodies and minds of\r\nthe officers and crew would be most disastrous. The want of exercise alone\r\nwould be sufficient to unfit them for the demands that service would make\r\nupon them. He has intelligently depicted the consequences of such a life,\r\nand his reasoning has been indorsed by the reports of French officers who\r\nhave had experience in the boats in question.\r\n\r\nNo weapon, no matter how ingenious, is of utility in warfare unless it can\r\nbe relied upon, and no vessel that is not tenantable can be expected to\r\nrender any service at sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence before us, we must conclude that the type of torpedo boat\r\nunder discussion is capable of making sea passages, provided it can\r\ncommunicate frequently with its supply stations and secure the bodily rest\r\nso necessary to its crew. But even in a moderate sea it is useless for\r\nattack, and in the majority of cases will not be able even to open its\r\nimpulse tubes. Should it succeed in doing this, the rolling and yawing will\r\nrender its aim very uncertain.\r\n\r\nAn experiment conducted against the Richelieu in October last, at Toulon,\r\nbefore Admiral O'Neil, the director-general of the torpedo service, has\r\nadded its testimony to the uncertainty of the Whitehead torpedo. The\r\nRichelieu had been fitted with Bullivant nets, and the trial was made to\r\nlearn what protection they would afford.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fair, the sea moderate, and the conditions generally\r\nfavorable to the torpedo; but the Whitehead missed its mark, although the\r\nRichelieu's speed was only three knots. Running at full speed, the torpedo\r\nboat, even in this moderate sea, deemed it prudent to keep the launching\r\ntube closed, and selected a range of 250 yards for opening it and firing.\r\nJust at the moment of discharge a little sea came on board, the boat yawed,\r\nthe torpedo aim was changed more than 30 deg., and it passed astern without\r\ntouching its object.\r\n\r\nWhile the Milford Haven operations have taught some valuable lessons, they\r\nwere conducted under but few of the conditions that are most likely to\r\noccur in actual warfare; and had the defense been carried on with an\r\norganization and command equal to that of the attack, the Navy's triumph\r\nwould, perhaps, not have been so easily secured, and the results might have\r\nbeen very different.\r\n\r\nMay not the apparent deficiencies of the defense have been due to the fact\r\nthat soldiers instead of sailors are given the control of the harbor and\r\ncoast defense? Is this right? Ought they not to be organized on a naval\r\nbasis? This is no new suggestion, but its importance needs emphasis.\r\n\r\nThese operations, however, convinced at least one deeply interested\r\nspectator, Lord Brassey, to the extent of calling attention \"to the urgent\r\nnecessity for the construction of a class of torpedo vessels capable of\r\nkeeping the sea in company with an armored fleet.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no one in Great Britain who takes a greater interest in the\r\nprogress of the British Navy than Lord Brassey, and we take pleasure in\r\nquoting from his letter of August 23 last to the _Times_, in which he\r\nexpressed the following opinion: \"The torpedo boats ordered last year from\r\nMessrs. Thornycroft and Yarrow are excellent in their class. But their\r\ndimensions are not sufficient for sea-going vessels. We must accept a\r\ntonnage of not less than 300 tons in order to secure thorough seaworthiness\r\nand sufficient coal endurance.\r\n\r\n\"A beginning has been made in the construction of vessels of the type\r\nrequired. To multiply them with no stinting hand is the paramount question\r\nof the day in the department of construction. The boats attached to the\r\nChannel fleet at Milford Haven will be most valuable for harbor defense,\r\nand for that purpose they are greatly needed. Torpedo boat catchers are not\r\nless essential to the efficiency of a fleet. The gunboats attached to the\r\nChannel fleet were built for service in the rivers of China. They should be\r\nreserved for the work for which they were designed.\r\n\r\n\"We require for the fleet more fast gunboats of the Curlew and Landrail\r\ntype. I trust that the next estimates for the Navy will contain an ample\r\nprovision for building gun vessels of high speed.\"\r\n\r\nAs torpedoes must be carried, the next point to which we would call the\r\nattention of our readers is the very rapid progress that has been made in\r\nthe boats designed to carry automatic torpedoes.\r\n\r\nA very few years ago the names of Thornycroft and Yarrow were almost alone\r\nas builders of a special type of vessel to carry them. To-day, in addition,\r\nwe have Schichau, White, Herreshoff, Creusot, Thomson, and others, forming\r\na competitive body of high speed torpedo-boat builders who are daily making\r\nnew and rapid development--almost too rapid, in fact, for the military\r\nstudent to follow.\r\n\r\nAs new types are designed, additional speed gained, or increased\r\nseaworthiness attained, public descriptions quickly follow, and we have\r\nourselves recorded the various advances made so fully that it will be\r\nunnecessary to enter into details here.\r\n\r\nAs late as October, 1885, an able writer said: \"The two most celebrated\r\nbuilders of torpedo boats in the world are Thornycroft and Yarrow, in\r\nEngland. Each is capable of producing a first class torpedo boat, from 100\r\nft. to 130 ft. long, and with 10 ft. to 14 ft. beam, that will steam at the\r\nrate of from 18 knots to 22 knots per hour for 370 knots, or at the rate of\r\n10 knots per hour for 3000 miles. A second class torpedo boat is from 40\r\nft. to 60 ft. long, and with 6 ft. or 8 ft. beam.\r\n\r\nThe use of these boats is gradually being abandoned in Europe except for\r\nuse from sea-going ships; but in Europe the harbors are very small, and it\r\nhas been found that practically every torpedo boat for coast defense must\r\nbe able to go to sea. The tendency is, therefore, to confinement to the\r\nfirst class boats.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper on \"Naval Torpedo Warfare,\" prepared in January, 1886, for a\r\nspecial committee of the American Senate, by Lieutenant Jaques of the\r\nAmerican Navy, we find the following reference to the progress in torpedo\r\nboat construction: \"The development in torpedo boats has been phenomenal,\r\nthe last year alone showing an advance from a length of 120 ft. and a speed\r\nof 19 knots, which were considered remarkable qualities in a first class\r\nboat, to a length of 140 ft. and a speed of 23 knots loaded (carrying 15\r\ntons), and 25 knots light, together with the introduction of novel features\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\n\"Although Messrs. Yarrow and Thornycroft have brought the second class\r\nboats to a very high standard in Europe, I believe they will soon be\r\nabandoned there even for sea-going ships (very few are now laid down), and\r\nthat the great development will be in overcoming the disadvantages of\r\ndelicacy and weakness by increasing their size, giving them greater\r\nmaneuvering power and safety by the introduction of two engines and twin\r\nscrews, and steel plate and coal protection against rapid firing\r\nammunition. Yarrow and Co. have already laid down some boats of this\r\ncharacter that give promise of developing a speed of from 23 to 25 knots.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Russian boat recently built at Glasgow, progress in this direction\r\nis also seen in the 148 ft. length, 17 ft. beam, the maneuvering powers and\r\nsafety element of the twin screws. But while the boat is fitted for the 19\r\nft. torpedo, a weapon of increased range and heavier explosive charge, it\r\nsuffers from the impossibility of broadside fire and the disadvantages that\r\nGallwey has named: \"The great length of this torpedo, however, makes it a\r\nvery unhandy weapon for a boat, besides which its extra weight limits the\r\nnumber which can be carried.\"\r\n\r\nWhile perhaps Messrs. Thomson have been the first to show the performance\r\nof a twin screw torpedo boat in England, the one completed in June last by\r\nYarrow for the Japanese government recalls the intelligence that Japan has\r\nexercised in the selection of types.\r\n\r\nCommencing as far back as nine years ago, the Japanese were probably the\r\nfirst to introduce sea-going boats, and they have been the first power to\r\ninitiate the armor type, one of which was shipped last summer to be put\r\ntogether in Japan. As before stated, it was built by Messrs. Yarrow and\r\nCo., was 166 ft. long, 19 ft. beam, with twin screws, 1 in. steel armor,\r\ndouble engines, with bow and broadside torpedo guns, the latter so arranged\r\nas to greatly increase their efficiency.\r\n\r\nWhile the advances are not restricted to the English builders, a glance at\r\nthe points to which Thornycroft and Yarrow have brought their improvements\r\nup to the present time will indicate that their achievements are not only\r\nequal to but greater than those of any other builders.\r\n\r\nThe former has boats under construction 148 ft. long, 15 ft. beam, to make\r\n420 revolutions with 130 lb. of steam, the guaranteed speed being 23 knots\r\non a continuous run of two hours' duration, with a load of 15 tons. They\r\nwill have triple-expansion or compound direct-acting surface-condensing\r\nengines and twin screws, Thornycroft's patent tubular boilers, double\r\nrudders, electric search lights, three masts and sails.\r\n\r\nWhile the armaments of the various boats differ, Thornycroft is prepared to\r\nfit the launching tubes with either air or powder impulse, to mount the\r\ntubes forward or on deck, and also the fittings for machine and rapid\r\nfiring guns.\r\n\r\nYarrow and Co. have contracted for boats varying in length from 117 ft. to\r\n166 ft., with fittings and armament as may be required. They have obtained\r\nexcellent results in their last English boat of the Admiralty type. They\r\nare, in fact, prepared to guarantee a speed of 23 knots in a length of 125\r\nft. and 25 knots in a length of 140 ft., carrying in both causes a mean\r\nload corresponding to fuel and armament of 10 tons.\r\n\r\nAnd so the progress goes on, but it will not stop here; it has already\r\nincited a marked development in ship construction, and the endeavors to\r\nwithstand torpedo attack have improved the defense against gun fire also.\r\n\r\nIn quoting a German opinion on the development of the Russian torpedo\r\nfleet, Charmes refers to the type which will, no doubt, be most successful\r\nupon the sea, namely, the torpedo cruisers, and it is to this type, more\r\nthan for any other, that we may expect torpedo boats to be adapted.\r\nAlready, writers have dropped the phrase \"torpedo boats\" for \"torpedo\r\nvessels.\"--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRING TRIAL OF THE 110½ TON B.L. ELSWICK GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firing trial of the first new 110½ ton breech loading gun approved for\r\nH.M.'s ships Benbow, Renown, and Sanspareil was commenced recently at the\r\nWoolwich proof butts, under the direction of Colonel Maitland, the\r\nsuperintendent of the Royal Gun Factories. We give herewith a section\r\nshowing the construction of this gun (_vide_ Fig. 8). It very nearly\r\ncorresponds to the section given of it when designed in 1884, in a paper\r\nread by Colonel Maitland at the United Service Institution, of which we\r\ngave a long account in the _Engineer_ of June 27, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are authoritative: Length over all, 524 in.; length\r\nof bore, 487.5 in. (30 calibers). The breech engages in the breech piece,\r\nleaving the A tube with its full strength for tangential strain (_vide_\r\nFig.). The A tube is in a single piece instead of two lengths, as in the\r\ncase of the Italia guns. It is supplied to Elswick from Whitworth's works,\r\none of the few in England where such a tube could be made. There are four\r\nlayers of metal hoops over the breech. Copper and bronze are used to give\r\nlongitudinal strength. The obturation is a modification of the De Bange\r\nsystem, proposed by Vavasseur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW 110½ TON ELSWICK GUNS FOR H.M.S. BENBOW.]\r\n\r\nThe maximum firing charge is 900 lb. of cocoa powder. The projectile weighs\r\n1,800 lb. The estimated muzzle velocity is 2,216 ft. per second. The\r\ncapacity of the chamber is 28,610 cubic inches, and that of the bore\r\n112,595 cubic inches. The estimated total energy is 61,200 ft. tons. It\r\nwill be a few days probably before the full powers of the gun are tested,\r\nbut the above are confidently expected to be attained, judging from the\r\nresults with the 100 ton guns supplied to Italy. On January 7 last we gave\r\nthose of the new Krupp 119 ton gun. It had fired a projectile with a\r\nvelocity of almost 1,900 ft. with a charge of less than 864.67 lb., with\r\nmoderate pressure. The estimated maximum for this gun was a velocity of\r\n2,017 ft. with a projectile weighing 1,632 lb., giving a total energy of\r\n46,061 ft. tons, or 13,000 ft. tons less than the Elswick gun, comparing\r\nthe estimated results.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the Elswick gun is mounted on a carriage turned out by the\r\nRoyal Carriage Department, under Colonel Close. This carriage is made on\r\nbogies so as to run on rails passing easily round curves of 50 ft. radius.\r\nThe gun is fired on an inclined length of rails, the recoil presses of the\r\ncarriage first receiving the shock and reducing the recoil. The carriage is\r\nmade to lift into the government barge, so as to go easily to Shoeburyness\r\nor elsewhere. It can be altered so as to provide for turning, and it allows\r\nthe piece to be fired at angles of elevation up to 24 deg. The cheeks of\r\nthe carriage are made to open and close, so as to take the 12 in. gun and\r\nlarger pieces. The steel castings for it are supplied from the Stanners\r\nClose Steel Works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe first round was fired at about noon. The charge was only 598 lb.,\r\nconsisting of four charges of 112 lb. and one of 130 lb. of Waltham Abbey\r\nbrown prism No. 1 powder. The proof shot weighs, like the service\r\nprojectile, 1,800 lb. Thus fired, the gun recoiled nearly 4 ft. on the\r\npress, and the carriage ran back on the rails about 50 ft. The projectile\r\nhad a velocity of 1,685 ft. per second, and entered about 52 ft. into the\r\nbutt. We cannot yet give the pressure, but unquestionably it was a low one.\r\nThe charges as the firing continues will be increased in successive rounds\r\nup to the full 900 lb. charge.\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2 show the mounting of the 110½ ton gun in the barbette towers\r\nof the Benbow. The gun is held down on the bed by steel bands and recoils\r\nin its bed on the slide (vide Fig. 2). The latter is hinged or pivoted in\r\nfront and is elevated by elevating ram, shown in Fig. 2. When the slide is\r\nfully down, the gun is in the loading position. The ammunition lift brings\r\nup the projectile and charge, which latter is subdivided, like those\r\nemployed in the German guns, in succession to the breech, the hydraulic\r\nrammer forcing them home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the arrangement is apparent. The recoil always acts\r\nparallel to the slide. This is much better than allowing its direction to\r\nbe affected by elevation, and the distributed hold of the steel bands is\r\npreferable to the single attachment at trunnions. Theoretically, the recoil\r\nis not so perfectly met as in some of the earlier Elswick designs, in which\r\nthe presses were brought opposite to the trunnions, so that they acted\r\nsymmetrically on each side of the center of resistance. The barbette tower\r\nis covered by a steel plate, shown in Fig. 1, fitting close to the gun\r\nslide, so that the only opening is that behind the breech when the gun is\r\nin the forward position, and this is closed as it recoils.\r\n\r\nThe only man of the detachment even partly exposed is the number one, while\r\nlaying the gun, and in that position he is nearly covered by the gun and\r\nfittings. Common shell, shrapnel shell, and steel armor-piercing\r\nprojectiles, have been approved for the 110½ ton gun. The common shell is\r\nshown in Fig. 3. Like the common shell for all the larger natures of new\r\ntype guns, it is made of steel. It has been found necessary to support the\r\ncore used in casting these projectiles at both ends. Consequently, there is\r\na screw plug at the base as well as at the apex. The hole at the base is\r\nused as a filling hole for the insertion of the bursting charge, which\r\nconsists of 179 lb. of powder, the total weight of the filled shell being\r\n1,800 lb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe apex has a screw plug of larger diameter than that of the fuse. This is\r\nshown in Fig. 4. The fuse is a direct action one. The needle, B, is held in\r\nthe center of a copper disk, C C, and is safe against explosion until it is\r\nactually brought into contact with an object, when it is forced down,\r\nigniting a patch of cap composition and the magazine at A, and so firing\r\nthe bursting charge of the shell below. E E E are each priming charges of\r\nseven grains of pistol powder, made up in shalloon bags to insure the\r\nignition of the bursting charge, which is in a bag of serge and shalloon\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nThe use of this fuse involves the curious question of the physical\r\nconditions now existing in the discharge of our projectiles by slow burning\r\npowder. The forward movement of the shell is now so gradual that the\r\ninertia of a pellet is only sufficient to shear a wire of one-tenth the\r\nstrength of that which might formerly have been sheared by a similar pellet\r\nin an old type gun with quick burning powder. Consequently, in many cases,\r\nit is found better not to depend on a suspending wire thus sheared, but to\r\nadopt direct action. The fuse in question would, we believe, act even on\r\ngraze, at any angle over 10°. Probably at less angles than 10° it would not\r\nexplode against water, which would be an advantage in firing at ships.\r\n\r\nShells so gently put in motion, and having no windage, might be made, it\r\nmight naturally be supposed, singularly thin, and the adoption of steel in\r\nplace of iron calls for some explanation. The reason is that it has been\r\nfound that common shells break up against masonry, instead of penetrating\r\nit, when fired from these large high velocity guns.\r\n\r\nThe shrapnel shell is shown at Fig. 5. Like the common shell, it is made of\r\nsteel, and is of the general form of the pattern of General Boxer, with\r\nwooden head, central tube, and bursting charge in the base. It contains\r\n2,300 four ounce sand shots and an 8 lb. bursting charge. It weighs 1,800\r\nlb. The fuse is time and percussion. It is shown in Figs. 6 and 6A. It\r\nclosely resembles the original Armstrong time and percussion pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6A.]\r\n\r\nThe action is as follows: The ignition pellet, A, which is ordinarily held\r\nby a safety pin, is, after the withdrawal of the latter, only held by a\r\nfine, suspending wire, which is sheared by the inertia of the pellet on\r\ndischarge, a needle lighting a percussion patch of composition and the\r\ncomposition ring, B B, which burns round at a given rate until it reaches\r\nthe communication passage, C, when it flashes through the percussion\r\npellet, E, and ignites the magazine, D, and so ignites the primer shown in\r\nFig. 6, flashes down the central tube of the shell, and explodes the\r\nbursting charge in the base, Fig. 5. The length of time during which the\r\nfuse burns depends on how far the composition ring is turned round, and\r\nwhat length it consequently has to burn before it reaches the communication\r\npassage, C. If the fuse should be set too long, or from any other cause\r\nthe shell strikes before the fuse fires the charge, the percussion action\r\nfires the shell on graze by the following arrangement: The heavy metal\r\npiece containing the magazine, D, constitutes a striker, which is held in\r\nplace by a plain ball, G, near the axis of the fuse and by a safety pellet,\r\nH. On first movement in the gun, this latter by inertia shears a suspending\r\nwire and leaves the ball free to escape above it, which it does by\r\ncentrifugal force, leaving the magazine striker, D, free to fire itself by\r\nmomentum on the needle shown above it, on impact. There is a second safety\r\narrangement, not shown in the figure, consisting of a cross pin, held by a\r\nweak spiral spring, which is compressed by centrifugal force during flight,\r\nleaving the magazine pellet free to act, as above described, on impact.\r\n\r\nThe armor-piercing projectile is shown in Fig. 7. It is to be made of\r\nforged steel, and supplied by Elswick. In appearance it very closely\r\nresembles those fired from the 100 ton gun at Spezia, but if it is made on\r\nthe Firmini system, it will differ from it in the composition of its metal,\r\ninasmuch as it will contain a large proportion of chromium, probably from 1\r\nto 2 per cent., whereas an analysis of Krupp's shell gives none. In fact,\r\nas Krupp's agent at Spezia predicted, the analysis is less instructive than\r\nwe could wish.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS ENGINE FOR USE ON RAILROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industrial world has reason to feel considerable interest in any\r\neconomical method of traction on railways, owing to the influence which\r\ncost of transportation has upon the price of produce. We give a description\r\nof the gas engine invented by Mr. Emmanuel Stevens. Many experiments have\r\nbeen made both at Berlin and Liege during the past few years. They all\r\nfailed, owing to the impossibility the builders encountered in securing\r\nsufficient speed.\r\n\r\nThe Stevens engine does not present this defect, as will be seen. It has\r\nthe appearance of an ordinary street car entirely inclosed, showing none of\r\nthe machinery from without. On the interior is a Koerting gas motor of six\r\nhorse power, which is a sufficiently well known type not to require a\r\ndescription. In the experiment which we saw, the motor was supplied with a\r\nmixture of gas and air, obtained by the evaporation of naphtha. On the\r\nshaft of the motor are fixed two pulleys of different sizes, which give the\r\nengine two rates of speed, one of three miles and the other of 8½ miles an\r\nhour. Between these two pulleys is a friction socket, by which either rate\r\nof speed may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe power is transmitted from one of the pulleys by a rubber belt to an\r\nintermediate shaft, which carries a toothed wheel that transmits the power\r\nto the axle by means of an endless chain. On this axle are three conical\r\ngear wheels, two of which are furnished with hooked teeth, and the third\r\nwith wooden projections and fixed permanently in place. This arrangement\r\nenables the engine to be moved forward or backward according as it is\r\nthrown in right or left gear. When the conical pinions are thrown out of\r\ngear, the motive force is no longer applied to the axle, and by the aid of\r\nthe brakes the engine may be instantly stopped. The movement of the pinions\r\nis effected by two sets of wheels on each of the platforms of the engine,\r\nand near the door for the conductor. By turning one of the wheels to the\r\nright or left on either platform, the conductor imparts either the less or\r\nthe greater speed to the engine. In case he has caused the engine to move\r\nforward by turning the second wheel, he will not have to touch it again\r\nuntil the end of the trip. The brake, which is also operated from the two\r\nplatforms, is applied to all four wheels at the same time. From this\r\narrangement it is seen that the movement is continuous. Nevertheless, the\r\nconductor has access to the regulator by a small chain connected with the\r\noutside by a wheel near at hand, but the action is sufficiently regular not\r\nto require much attention to this feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS ENGINE FOR USE ON RAILROADS.]\r\n\r\nThe gas is produced by the Wilford apparatus, which regularly furnishes the\r\nrequisite quantity necessary for an explosion, which is produced by a\r\nparticular kind of light placed near the piston. The vapor is produced by\r\npassing hot water from the envelope of the cylinder of the motor through\r\nthe Wilford apparatus. The water is cooled again in a reservoir (system\r\nKoerting) placed in direct communication with the cylinder. Any permanent\r\nheating is therefore impossible.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the explosions is prevented by a device invented by Mr.\r\nStevens himself. It consists of a drum covered with asbestos or any other\r\nmaterial which absorbs noise.\r\n\r\nAccording to the inventor, the saving over the use of horses for traction\r\nis considerable. This system is soon to be tried practically at Antwerp in\r\nBelgium, and then it will be possible to arrive at the actual cost of\r\ntraction.--_Industrie Moderne, Brussels_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN NORTH CAROLINA LOCATION OVER THE BLUE RIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCATION OVER THE BLUE RIDGE.--WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA\r\nRAILROAD.]\r\n\r\nThe interesting piece of railroad location illustrated in this issue is on\r\nthe mountain section of the Western North Carolina Railroad. This section\r\ncrosses the Blue Ridge Mountains 18 miles east of Asheville, at a point\r\nknown as Swannanoa Gap, 2,660 feet above tide water.

C. and W. Walker for\r\nthe Imperial Continental Gas Company at Erdberg, near Vienna, has been\r\ngraphically described by Herr E.R. Leonhardt in a paper which he read\r\nbefore the Austrian Society of Engineers. The enormous dimensions and\r\nelegant construction of the holder--being the largest out of England--as\r\nwell as the work of putting up the new gasholder, are of special interest\r\nto English engineers, as Erdberg contains the largest and best appointed\r\nworks in Austria. The dimensions of the holder are--inner lift, 195 feet\r\ndiameter, 40 feet deep; middle lift, 197½ feet diameter, 40 feet deep;\r\nouter lift, 200 feet diameter, 40 feet deep. The diameter over all is about\r\n230 feet. The impression produced upon the members of the Austrian Society\r\nby their visit to Erdberg was altogether most favorable; and not only did\r\nthe inspection of the large gasholder justify every expectation, but the\r\nvisitors were convinced that all the buildings were in excellent condition\r\nand well adapted for their purpose, that the machinery was of the latest\r\nand most approved type, and that the management was in experienced hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GASHOLDER\r\n\r\nis contained in a building consisting of a circular wall covered with a\r\nwrought iron roof. The holder itself is telescopic, and is capable of\r\nholding 3½ million cubic feet of gas. The accompanying illustrations (Figs.\r\n1 and 3) are a sectional elevation of the holder and its house and a\r\nsectional plan of the roof and holder crown. Having a capacity of close\r\nupon 3,200,000 Austrian cubic feet, this gasholder is the largest of its\r\nkind on the Continent, and is surpassed in size by only a few in England\r\nand America. By way of comparison, Hamburg possesses a holder of 50,000\r\ncubic meters (1,765,000 cubic feet) capacity; and there is one in Berlin\r\nwhich is expected to hold 75,000 cubic meters (2,647,500 cubic feet) of\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASHOLDER HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe gasholder house at Erdberg is perfectly circular, and has an internal\r\ndiameter of 63.410 meters. It is constructed, in three stories, with forty\r\npiers projecting on the outside, and with four rows of windows between the\r\npiers--one in each of the top and bottom stories, and two rows in the\r\nmiddle. These windows have a height of 1.40 meters in the lowest circle,\r\nwhere the wall is 1.40 meters thick, and of 2.90 meters in the two top\r\nstories, where it is respectively 1.11 meters and 0.90 meter thick. The top\r\nedge of the wall is 35.35 meters above the base of the building, and 44.39\r\nmeters from the bottom of the tank; the piers rising 1.60 meters beyond the\r\ntop of the wall. The highest point of the lantern on the roof will thus be\r\n48.95 meters above the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASHOLDER TANK.\r\n\r\nThe tank in which the gasholder floats has an internal diameter of 61.57\r\nmeters, and therefore a superficial area of 3,000 square meters; and since\r\nthe coping is 12.31 meters above the floor, it follows that the tank is\r\ncapable of holding 35,500 cubic meters (7,800,000 gallons) of water. The\r\nbottom consists of brickwork 1.10 meters thick, rendered with Portland\r\ncement, and resting on a layer of concrete 1 meter thick. The walls are\r\nlikewise of brick and cement, of a thickness of 3.30 meters up to the\r\nground level, and 2.40 meters thick to the height of 3.44 meters above the\r\nsurface. Altogether, 2,988,680 kilos. of cement and 5,570,000 bricks were\r\nused in its construction. In fact, from the bottom of tank to top of roof,\r\nit reaches as high as the monument at London Bridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SECTION OF GASHOLDER AND HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the tank offered many and serious difficulties. The\r\nbottom of the tank is fully 3 meters below the level of the Danube Canal,\r\nwhich passes close by, and it was not until twelve large pulsometer pumps\r\nwere set up, and worked continually night and day, that it was possible to\r\nreach the necessary depth to allow of the commencement of the foundations\r\nof the boundary wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOF OF HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe wrought iron cupola-shaped roof of the gasholder house was designed by\r\nHerr W. Brenner, and consists of 40 radiating rafters, each weighing about\r\n25 cwt., and joined together by 8 polygonal circles of angle iron (90×90×10\r\nmm.). The highest middle circle is uncovered, and carries a round lantern\r\n(Fig. 1). These radiating rafters consist of flat iron bars 7 mm. thick,\r\nand of a height which diminishes gradually, from one interval to another on\r\nthe inside, from 252 to 188 mm. At the outside ends (varying from 80×80×9\r\nmm. in the lowest to 60×60×7 mm. in the last polygon but one) these rafters\r\nare strengthened, at least as far as the five lowest ones are concerned, by\r\nflat irons tightly riveted on. At their respective places of support, the\r\nends of all the spars are screwed on by means of a washer 250 mm. high and\r\n31 mm. thick, and surmounted by a gutter supported by angle irons. From\r\nevery junction between the radial rafters and the polygonal circle,\r\ndiagonal bars are made to run to the center of the corresponding interval,\r\nwhere they meet, and are there firmly held together by means of a tongue\r\nring. The roof is 64.520 meters wide and 14.628 meters high; and its total\r\nweight is 103.300 kilos. for the ironwork--representing a weight of 31.6\r\nkilos. per square meter of surface. It is proposed to employ for its\r\ncovering wooden purlins and tin plates. The whole construction has a light,\r\npleasing, and yet thoroughly solid appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING THE ROOF.\r\n\r\nHerr Brenner, the engineer of the Erdberg Works, gives a description of how\r\nthe roof of a house, 54.6 meters wide, for a gasholder in Berlin, was\r\nraised to a height of 22 meters. In that instance the iron structure was\r\nput together at the bottom of the tank, leaving the rafter ends and the\r\nmural ring. The hoisting itself was effected by means of levers--one to\r\neach rafter--connected with the ironwork below by means of iron chains. At\r\nthe top there were apertures at distances of about 26 mm. from each other,\r\nand through these the hoisting was proceeded with. With every lift, the\r\niron structure was raised a distance of 26 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nHerr Brenner had considerable hesitation in raising in the same way the\r\nstructure at Erdberg, which was much larger and heavier than that in\r\nBerlin. The simultaneous elevation to 48 meters above the level, proposed\r\nto be effected at forty different points, did not appear to him to offer\r\nsufficient security. He therefore proposed to put the roof together on the\r\nground, and to raise it simultaneously with the building of the wall;\r\nstating that this mode would be perfectly safe, and would not involve any\r\nadditional cost. The suggestion was adopted, and it was found to possess,\r\nin addition, the important advantage that the structure could be made to\r\nrest on the masonry at any moment; whereas this had been impossible in the\r\ncase at the Berlin Gasworks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOISTING.\r\n\r\nAt a given signal from the foreman, two operatives, stationed at each of\r\nthe forty lifting points, with crowbars inserted in the holes provided for\r\nthe purpose, give the screws a simultaneous turn in the same direction. The\r\nbars are then inserted in another hole higher up. The hoisting screws are\r\nconnected with the structure of the roof, and rise therewith. All that is\r\nrequisite for the hoisting from the next cross beam is to give a forward\r\nturn to the screws. When the workmen had become accustomed to their task,\r\nthe hoisting to a distance of 1 meter occupied only about half to\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. At the outset, and merely by way of a trial, the\r\nroof was lifted to a height of fully 2 meters, and left for some time\r\nsuspended in the air. The eighty men engaged in the operation carry on the\r\nwork with great regularity and steadiness, obeying the signal of the\r\nforeman as soon as it was given.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GASHOLDER.\r\n\r\nThe holder, which was supplied by the well-known firm of Messrs. C. and W.\r\nWalker, of Finsbury Circus, London, and Donnington, Salop, was in an outer\r\ncourtyard. It is a three-lift telescopic one; the lowest lift being 200\r\nfeet, the middle lift 197 ft. 6 in., and the top lift 195 ft. in diameter.\r\nThe height of each lift is 40 feet. The several lifts are raised in the\r\nusual way; and they all work in a circle of 24 vertical U-shaped channel\r\nirons, fixed in the wall of the house by means of 13 supports placed at\r\nequal distances from the base to the summit (as shown in Fig. 2). When the\r\ngasholder is perfectly empty, the three lifts are inclosed, one in the\r\nother, and rest with their lower edges upon the bottom of the tank. In this\r\ncase the roof of the top lift rests upon a wooden framework. Fixed in the\r\nfloor of the tank are 144 posts, 9 inches thick at the bottom and 6 inches\r\nthick at the top, to support the crown of the holder in such a way that the\r\ntops are fixed in a kind of socket, each of them being provided with four\r\nhorizontal bars, which decrease in thickness from 305 by 100 mm. to 150 by\r\n50 mm., and represent 16 parallel polygons, which in their turn are\r\nfastened diagonally by means of iron rails 63 by 100 mm. thick, arranged\r\ncrosswise. The top of this framework is perfectly contiguous with the\r\ninside of the crown of the gasholder. The crown itself is made up of iron\r\nplates, the outer rows having a thickness of 11 mm., decreasing to 5 mm.\r\ntoward the middle, and to 3 mm. at the top. The plates used for the side\r\nsheets of the holder are: For the top and bottom rows, 6.4 mm.; and for the\r\nother plates, 2.6 mm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new bleaching compound has been discovered, consisting of three parts by\r\nmeasure of mustard-seed oil, four of melted paraffin, three of caustic soda\r\n20° Baume, well mixed to form a soapy compound. Of this one part of weight\r\nand two of pure tallow soap are mixed, and of this mixture one ounce for\r\neach gallon of water is used for the bleaching bath, and one ounce caustic\r\nsoda 20° Baume for each gallon is added, when the bath is heated in a close\r\nvessel, the goods entered, and boiled till sufficiently bleached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. WHISTLER, C.E.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper by Prof. G.L. Vose, Member of the Boston Society of\r\nCivil Engineers. Read September 15, 1886.]\r\n\r\nBy Prof. G.L. VOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons, even among those best acquainted with our modern railroad\r\nsystem, are aware of the early struggles of the men to whose foresight,\r\nenergy, and skill the new mode of transportation owes its introduction into\r\nthis country. The railroad problem in the United States was quite a\r\ndifferent one from that in Europe. Had we simply copied the railways of\r\nEngland, we should have ruined the system at the outset, for this country.\r\nIn England, where the railroad had its origin, money was plenty, the land\r\nwas densely populated, and the demand for rapid and cheap transportation\r\nalready existed. A great many short lines connecting the great centers of\r\nindustry were required, and for the construction of such in the most\r\nsubstantial manner the money was easily obtained. In America, on the\r\ncontrary, a land of enormous extent, almost entirely undeveloped, but of\r\ngreat possibilities, lines of hundreds and even thousands of miles in\r\nextent were to be made, to connect cities as yet unborn, and accommodate a\r\nfuture traffic of which no one could possibly foresee the amount. Money was\r\nscarce, and in many districts the natural obstacles to be overcome were\r\ninfinitely greater than any which had presented themselves to European\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nBy the sound practical sense and the unconquerable will of George\r\nStephenson, the numerous inventions which together make up the locomotive\r\nengine had been collected into a machine which, in combination with the\r\nimproved roadway, was to revolutionize the transportation of the world. The\r\nrailroad, as a machine, was invented. It remained to apply the new\r\ninvention in such a manner as to make it a success, and not a failure. To\r\ndo this in a new country like America required infinite skill, unbounded\r\nenergy, the most careful study of local conditions, and the exercise of\r\nwell matured, sound business judgment. To see how well the great invention\r\nhas been applied in the United States, we have only to look at the network\r\nof iron roads which now reaches from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWith all the experience we have had, it is not an easy problem, even at the\r\npresent time, to determine how much money we are authorized to spend upon\r\nthe construction of a given railroad. To secure the utmost benefit at the\r\nleast outlay, regarding both the first cost of building the road and the\r\nperpetual cost of operating it, is the railroad problem which is perhaps\r\nless understood at the present day than any other. It was an equally\r\nimportant problem fifty years ago, and certainly not less difficult at that\r\ntime. It was the fathers of the railroad system in the United States who\r\nfirst perceived the importance of this problem, and who, adapting\r\nthemselves to the new conditions presented in this country, undertook to\r\nsolve it. Among the pioneers in this branch of engineering no one has done\r\nmore to establish correct methods, nor has left behind a more enviable or\r\nmore enduring fame, than Major George W. Whistler.\r\n\r\nThe Whistler family is of English origin, and is found toward the end of\r\nthe 15th century in Oxfordshire, at Goring and Whitchurch, on the Thames.\r\nOne branch of the family settled in Sussex, at Hastings and Battle, being\r\nconnected by marriage with the Websters of Battle Abbey, in which\r\nneighborhood some of the family still live. Another branch lived in Essex,\r\nfrom which came Dr. Daniel Whistler, President of the College of Physicians\r\nin London in the time of Charles the Second. From the Oxfordshire branch\r\ncame Ralph, son of Hugh Whistler, of Goring, who went to Ireland, and there\r\nfounded the Irish branch of the family, being the original tenant of a\r\nlarge tract of country in Ulster, under one of the guilds or public\r\ncompanies of the city of London. From this branch of the family came Major\r\nJohn Whistler, father of the distinguished engineer, and the first\r\nrepresentative of the family in America. It is stated that in some youthful\r\nfreak he ran away and enlisted in the British Army. It is certain that he\r\ncame to this country during the Revolutionary War, under General Burgoyne,\r\nand remained with his command until its surrender at Saratoga, when he was\r\ntaken prisoner of war. Upon his return to England he was honorably\r\ndischarged, and, soon after, forming an attachment for a daughter of Sir\r\nEdward Bishop, a friend of his father, he eloped with her, and came to this\r\ncountry, settling at Hagerstown, in Maryland. He soon after entered the\r\narmy of the United States, and served in the ranks, being severely wounded\r\nin the disastrous campaign against the Indians under Major-General St.\r\nClair in the year 1791. He was afterward commissioned as lieutenant, rose\r\nto the rank of captain, and later had the brevet of major. At the reduction\r\nof the army in 1815, having already two sons in the service, he was not\r\nretained; but in recognition of his honorable record, he was appointed\r\nMilitary Storekeeper at Newport, Kentucky, from which post he was afterward\r\ntransferred to Jefferson Barracks, where he lived to a good old age.\r\n\r\nMajor John Whistler had a large family of sons and daughters, among whom we\r\nmay note particularly William, who became a colonel in the United States\r\nArmy, and who died at Newport, Ky., in 1863; John, a lieutenant in the\r\narmy, who died of wounds received in the battle of Maguago, near Detroit,\r\nin 1812; and George Washington, the subject of our sketch. Major John\r\nWhistler was not only a good soldier, and highly esteemed for his military\r\nservices, but was also a man of refined tastes and well educated, being an\r\nuncommonly good linguist and especially noted as a fine musician. In his\r\nfamily he is stated to have united firmness with tenderness, and to have\r\nimpressed upon his children the importance of a faithful and thorough\r\nperformance of duty in whatever position they should be placed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Whistler, the youngest son of Major John Whistler, was\r\nborn on the 19th of May, in the year 1800, at Fort Wayne, in the present\r\nState of Indiana, but then part of the Northwest Territory, his father\r\nbeing at the time in command of that post. Of the boyhood of Whistler we\r\nhave no record, except that he followed his parents from one military\r\nstation to another, receiving his early education for the most part at\r\nNewport, Ky., from which place, on July 31, 1814, he was appointed a cadet\r\nto the United States Military Academy, being then fourteen years of age.\r\nThe course of the student at West Point was a very satisfactory one. Owing\r\nto a change in the arrangement of classes after his entrance, he had the\r\nadvantage of a longer term than had been given to those who preceded him,\r\nremaining five years under instruction. His record during his student life\r\nwas good throughout. In a class of thirty members he stood No. 1 in\r\ndrawing, No. 4 in descriptive geometry, No. 5 in drill, No. 11 in\r\nphilosophy and in engineering, No. 12 in mathematics, and No. 10 in general\r\nmerit. He was remarkable, says one who knew him at this time, for his frank\r\nand open manner and for his pleasant and cheerful disposition. A good story\r\nis told of the young cadet which shows his ability, even at this time, to\r\nmake the best of circumstances apparently untoward, and to turn to his\r\nadvantage his surroundings, whatever they might be. Having been for some\r\nslight breach of discipline required to bestride a gun in the campus for a\r\nshort time, he saw, to his dismay, coming down the walk the beautiful\r\ndaughter of Dr. Foster Swift, a young lady who, visiting West Point, had\r\ntaken the hearts of the cadets by storm, and who, little as he may at the\r\ntime have dreamed it, was destined to become his future wife. Pulling out\r\nhis handkerchief, he bent over his gun, and appeared absorbed in cleaning\r\nthe most inaccessible parts of it with such vigor as to be entirely unaware\r\nthat any one was passing; nor did the young lady dream that a case of\r\ndiscipline had been before her until in after years, when, on a visit to\r\nWest Point, an explanation was made to her by her husband.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time of his life that the refinement and taste for which\r\nMajor Whistler was ever after noted began to show itself. An accomplished\r\nscientific musician and performer, he gained a reputation in this direction\r\nbeyond that of a mere amateur, and scarcely below that of the professionals\r\nof the day. His _sobriquet_ of \"Pipes,\" which his skill upon the flute at\r\nthis time gave him, adhered to him through life among his intimates in the\r\narmy. His skill with the pencil, too, was something phenomenal, and would,\r\nhad not more serious duties prevented, have made him as noted an artist as\r\nhe was an engineer. Fortunately for the world this talent descended to one\r\nof his sons, and in his hands has had full development. These tastes in\r\nMajor Whistler appeared to be less the results of study than the\r\nspontaneous outgrowth of a refined and delicate organization, and so far\r\nconstitutional with him that they seemed to tinge his entire character.\r\nThey continued to be developed till past the meridian of life, and amid all\r\nthe pressure of graver duties furnished a most delightful relaxation.\r\n\r\nUpon completing his course at the Military Academy he was graduated, July\r\n1, 1819, and appointed second lieutenant in the corps of artillery. From\r\nthis date until 1821 he served part of the time on topographical duty, and\r\npart of the time he was in garrison at Fort Columbus. From November 2,\r\n1821, to April 30, 1822, he was assistant professor at the Military\r\nAcademy, a position for which his attainments in descriptive geometry and\r\nhis skill in drawing especially fitted him. This employment, however, was\r\nnot altogether to his taste. He was too much of an artist to wish to\r\nconfine himself to the mechanical methods needed in the training of\r\nengineering students. In 1822, although belonging to the artillery, he was\r\ndetailed on topographical duty under Major (afterward Colonel) Abert, and\r\nwas connected with the commission employed in tracing the international\r\nboundary between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. This work\r\ncontinued four years, from 1822 to 1826, and subsequent duties in the\r\ncabinet of the commission employed nearly two years more.\r\n\r\nThe field service of this engagement was anything but light work, much of\r\nit being performed in the depth of winter with a temperature fifty degrees\r\nbelow zero. The principal food of the party was tallow and some other\r\nsubstance, which was warmed over a fire on stopping at night. The snow was\r\nthen removed to a sufficient depth for a bed, and the party wrapped one\r\nanother up in their buffalo robes, until the last man's turn came, when he\r\nhad to wrap himself up the best he could. In the morning, after warming\r\ntheir food and eating, the remainder was allowed to harden in the pan,\r\nafter which it was carried on the backs of men to the next stopping place.\r\nThe work was all done upon snow-shoes, and occasionally a man became so\r\nblinded by the glare of the sun upon the snow that he had to be led by a\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nUpon the 1st of June, 1821, Whistler was made second lieutenant in the\r\nFirst Artillery, in the reorganized army; on the 16th of August, 1821, he\r\nwas transferred to the Second Artillery, and on the 16th of August, 1829,\r\nhe was made first lieutenant. Although belonging to the artillery, he was\r\nassigned to topographical duty almost continually until December 31, 1833,\r\nwhen he resigned his position in the army. A large part of his time during\r\nthis period was spent in making surveys, plans, and estimates for public\r\nworks, not merely those needed by the national government, but others which\r\nwere undertaken by chartered companies in different parts of the United\r\nStates. There were at that time very few educated engineers in the country,\r\nbesides the graduates of the Military Academy; and the army engineers were\r\nthus frequently applied for, and for several years government granted their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nProminent among the early works of internal improvement was the Baltimore &\r\nOhio Railroad, and the managers of this undertaking had been successful in\r\nobtaining the services of several officers who were then eminent, or who\r\nafterward became so. The names of Dr. Howard, who, though not a military\r\nman, was attached to the Corps of Engineers, of Lieut.-Col. Long, and of\r\nCapt. William Gibbs McNeill appear in the proceedings of the company as\r\n\"Chiefs of Brigade,\" and those of Fessenden, Gwynne, and Trimble among the\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1828, this company made a special request for the services of\r\nLieutenant Whistler. The directors had resolved on sending a deputation to\r\nEngland to examine the railroads of that country, and Jonathan Knight,\r\nWilliam Gibbs McNeill, and George W. Whistler were selected for this duty.\r\nThey were also accompanied by Ross Winans, whose fame and fortune, together\r\nwith those of his sons, became so widely known afterward in connection with\r\nthe great Russian railway. Lieutenant Whistler, says one who knew him well,\r\nwas chosen for this service on account of his remarkable thoroughness in\r\nall the details of his profession, as well as for his superior\r\nqualifications in other respects. The party left this country in November,\r\n1828, and returned in May, 1829.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following year the organization of the Baltimore and\r\nOhio Railroad, a part of which had already been constructed under the\r\nimmediate personal supervision of Lieutenant Whistler, assumed a more\r\npermanent form, and allowed the military engineers to be transferred to\r\nother undertakings of a similar character. Accordingly, in June, 1830,\r\nCaptain McNeill and Lieutenant Whistler were sent to the Baltimore and\r\nSusquehanna Railroad, for which they made the preliminary surveys and a\r\ndefinite location, and upon which they remained until about twenty miles\r\nwere completed, when a lack of funds caused a temporary suspension of the\r\nwork. In the latter part of 1831 Whistler went to New Jersey to aid in the\r\nconstruction of the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad (now a part of the\r\nErie Railway). Upon this work he remained until 1833, at which time he\r\nmoved to Connecticut to take charge of the location of the railroad from\r\nProvidence to Stonington, a line which had been proposed as an extension of\r\nthat already in process of construction from Boston to Providence.\r\n\r\nIn this year, December 31, 1833, Lieut. Whistler resigned his commission in\r\nthe army, and this not so much from choice as from a sense of duty.\r\nHitherto his work as an engineer appears to have been more an employment\r\nthan a vocation. He carried on his undertakings diligently, as it was his\r\nnature to do, but without much anxiety or enthusiasm; and he was satisfied\r\nin meeting difficulties as they came up, with a sufficient solution.\r\nHenceforward he handled his profession from a love of it. He labored that\r\nhis resources against the difficulties of matter and space should be\r\noverabundant, and if he had before been content with the sure-footed facts\r\nof observation, he now added the luminous aid of study. How luminous and\r\nhow sure these combined became, his later works show best.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Mr. Whistler accepted the position of engineer to the proprietors\r\nof locks and canals at Lowell. This position gave him among other things\r\nthe direction of the machine shops, which had been made principally for the\r\nconstruction of locomotive engines. The Boston and Lowell Railroad, which\r\nat this time was in process of construction, had imported a locomotive from\r\nthe works of George and Robert Stephenson, at Newcastle, and this engine\r\nwas to be reproduced, not only for the use of the Lowell road, but for\r\nother railways as well, and to this work Major Whistler gave a large part\r\nof his time from 1834 to 1837. The making of these engines illustrated\r\nthose features in his character which then and ever after were of the\r\nutmost value to those he served. It showed the self-denial with which he\r\nexcluded any novelties of his own, the caution with which he admitted those\r\nof others, and the judgment which he exercised in selecting and combining\r\nthe most meritorious of existing arrangements. The preference which he\r\nshowed for what was simple and had been tried did not arise from a want of\r\noriginality, as he had abundant occasion to show during the whole of his\r\nengineering life. He was, indeed, uncommonly fertile in expedients, as all\r\nwho knew him testify, and the greater the demand upon his originality, the\r\nhigher did he rise to meet the occasion. The time spent in Lowell was not\r\nonly to the great advantage of the company, but it increased also his own\r\nstores of mechanical knowledge, and in a direction, too, which in later\r\nyears was of especial value to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the condition of the Stonington Railroad became such as to demand\r\nthe continual presence and attention of the engineer. Mr. Whistler\r\ntherefore moved to Stonington, a place to which he became much attached,\r\nand to which he seems during all of his wanderings to have looked with a\r\nview of making it finally his home. While engaged upon the above road he\r\nwas consulted in regard to many other undertakings in different parts of\r\nthe country, and prominent among these was the Western Railroad of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis great work, remarkable for the boldness of its engineering, was to run\r\nfrom Worcester through Springfield and Pittsfield to Albany. To surmount\r\nthe high lands dividing the waters of the Connecticut from those of the\r\nHudson called for engineering cautious and skillful as well as heroic. The\r\nline from Worcester to Springfield, though apparently much less formidable,\r\nand to one who now rides over the road showing no very marked features,\r\ndemanded hardly less study, as many as twelve several routes having been\r\nexamined between Worcester and Brookfield. To undertake the solution of a\r\nproblem of so much importance required the best of engineering talent, and\r\nwe find associated on this work the names of three men who in the early\r\nrailroad enterprises of this country stood deservedly in the front rank:\r\nGeorge W. Whistler, William Gibbs McNeill, and William H. Swift. McNeill\r\nhad graduated from the Military Academy in 1817, and rose to the rank of\r\nmajor in the Topographical Engineers. Like Whistler, he had been detailed\r\nto take charge of the design and construction of many works of internal\r\nimprovement not under the direction of the general government. These two\r\nengineers exercised an influence throughout the country for many years much\r\ngreater than that of any others. Indeed, there were very few works of\r\nimportance undertaken at that time in connection with which their names do\r\nnot appear. This alliance was further cemented by the marriage between\r\nWhistler and McNeill's sister. Capt. William H. Swift had also graduated\r\nfrom the Military Academy, and had already shown marked ability as an\r\nengineer. Such were the men who undertook the location and construction of\r\nthe railroad which was to surmount the high lands between the Connecticut\r\nand the Hudson, and to connect Boston with the Great West.\r\n\r\nThe early reports of these engineers to the directors of the Western\r\nRailroad show an exceedingly thorough appreciation of the complex problem\r\npresented to them, and a much better understanding of the principles\r\ninvolved in establishing the route than seems to have been shown in many\r\nfar more recent works. In these early reports made in 1836 and 1837, we\r\nfind elaborate discussions as to the power of the locomotive engine, and a\r\nrecognition of the fact that in comparing different lines we must regard\r\nthe _plan_ as well as the _profile_, \"as the resistance from curves on a\r\nlevel road may even exceed that produced by gravity on an incline;\" and in\r\none place we find the ascents \"_equated_ at 18 feet, the slope which\r\nrequires double the power needed on a level road,\" resulting in a \"_virtual\r\nincrease_.\" We find also a very clear expression of the fact that an\r\nincreased expenditure in the power needed to operate the completed road may\r\noverbalance a considerable saving in first cost. To bear this principle in\r\nmind, and at the same time to work in accordance with the directors' ideas\r\nof economy, in a country where the railroad was regarded very largely as an\r\nexperiment, was by no means an easy task. The temptation to make the first\r\ncost low at the expense of the quality of the road in running up the valley\r\nof Westfield River was very great, and the directors were at one time very\r\nstrongly urged to make an exceedingly narrow and crooked road west of\r\nSpringfield; but Major Whistler so convinced the President, Thomas B.\r\nWales, of the folly of such a course, that the latter declared, with a most\r\nemphatic prefix, that he would have nothing to do with such a two-penny\r\ncow-path, and thus prevented its adoption.\r\n\r\nMr. Whistler had many investigations to make concerning the plans and\r\npolicy of railroad companies at a time when almost everything connected\r\nwith them was comparatively new and untried. When he commenced, there was\r\nno passenger railroad in the country, and but very few miles of quarry and\r\nmining track. If at that time an ascent of more than 1 in 200 was required,\r\nit was thought necessary to have inclined planes and stationary power. It\r\nwas supposed that by frequent relays it would be possible to obtain for\r\npassenger cars a speed of eight or nine miles an hour. Almost nothing was\r\nknown of the best form for rails, of the construction of the track, or of\r\nthe details for cars or engines. In all of these things Major Whistler's\r\nhighly gifted and well balanced mind enabled him to judge wisely for his\r\nemployers, and to practice for them the truest economy.\r\n\r\nMajor Whistler's employment upon the Western Railroad began while he was\r\nstill engaged upon the Stonington line. In connection with his friend\r\nMcNeill he acted as consulting engineer for the Western road from 1836 to\r\n1840. From 1840 to 1842 he was its chief engineer, with his headquarters at\r\nSpringfield. The steep grades west of the Connecticut presented not only a\r\ndifficult problem in location and construction, but in locomotive\r\nengineering as well. At the present day we can order any equipment which\r\nmay best meet the requirement upon any railroad, and the order will be\r\npromptly met by any one of our great manufactories. But in the early days\r\nof the Western Railroad it was far otherwise, and the locomotive which\r\nshould successfully and economically operate the hitherto unheard of grade\r\nof over 80 feet to the mile was yet to be seen. The Messrs. Winans, of\r\nBaltimore, had built some nondescript machines, which had received the name\r\nof \"crabs,\" and had tried to make them work upon the Western road. But\r\nafter many attempts they were given up as unfit for such service.\r\n\r\nThese \"crabs\" were eight wheeled engines, weighing about 20 tons, with a\r\nvertical boiler. The wheels were 3½ feet in diameter, but the engine worked\r\non to an intermediate shaft, which was connected with the driving axle in\r\nsuch a way as to get the effect of a five foot wheel. These engines did not\r\nimpress Major Whistler at all favorably. And it is related that one Sunday\r\nthe watchman in charge of the building in which some of them were kept,\r\nhearing some one among the engines, went in quietly and overheard Major\r\nWhistler, apparently conversing with the \"crab,\" and saying: \"No; you\r\nmiserable, top-heavy, lop-sided abortion of a grasshopper, you'll never do\r\nto haul the trains over this road.\" His experience in Lowell was here of\r\ngreat value to him, and he had become convinced that the engine of George\r\nStephenson was in the main the coming machine, and needed but to be\r\nproperly proportioned and of sufficient size to meet every demand.\r\n\r\nWith Major Whistler's work upon the Western Railroad his engineering\r\nservice in this country concluded, and that by an occurrence which marked\r\nhim as the foremost railroad engineer of his time. Patient, indefatigable,\r\ncautious, remarkable for exhaustless resource, admirable judgment, and the\r\nhighest engineering skill, he had begun with the beginning of the railroad\r\nsystem, and had risen to the chief control of one of the greatest works in\r\nthe world, the Western Railroad of Massachusetts. Not only had he shown the\r\nmost far-sighted wisdom in fixing the general features of this undertaking,\r\nbut no man surpassed him, if, indeed, any one equaled him, in an exact and\r\nthorough knowledge of technical details. To combine the various elements in\r\nsuch a manner as to produce the greatest commercial success, and to make\r\nthe railroad in the widest sense of the word a public improvement, never\r\nforgetting the amount of money at his disposal, was the problem he had\r\nundertaken to solve. He had proved himself a great master in his\r\nprofession, and had shown how well fitted he was to grapple with every\r\ndifficulty. He was equally a man of science and a man of business. And to\r\nall this he added the most delicate sense of honor and the most spotless\r\nintegrity. He was in the prime of manhood, and was prepared to enter upon\r\nthe great work of his life.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the introduction of the railroad that intelligent\r\npersons saw very plainly that the new mode of transportation was not to be\r\nconfined to the working of an already established traffic, in densely\r\npopulated regions, but that it would be of equal service in awakening the\r\nenergies of undeveloped countries, in bringing the vast interior regions of\r\nthe continents into communication with the seaboard, in opening markets to\r\nlands which before were beyond the reach of commerce. And it was seen, too,\r\nthat in event of war, a new and invaluable element had been introduced,\r\nviz., the power of transportation to an extent never before imagined.\r\n\r\nEspecially were these advantages foreseen in the vast empire of Russia, and\r\nan attempt was very early made to induce private capitalists to undertake\r\nthe construction of the lines contemplated in that country. The Emperor,\r\nbesides guaranteeing to the shareholders a minimum profit of four per\r\ncent., proposed to give them, gratuitously, all the lands of the state\r\nthrough which the lines should pass, and to place at their disposal, also\r\ngratuitously, the timber and raw materials necessary for the way and works\r\nwhich might be found upon the ground. It was further proposed, to permit\r\nthe importation of rails and of the rolling stock free of duty. Russian\r\nproprietors also came forward, and not only agreed to grant such portions\r\nof their land as the railroads might pass through, gratuitously, but\r\nfurther to dispossess themselves temporarily of their serfs, and surrender\r\nthem to the use of the companies, on the sole condition that they should\r\nbe properly supported while thus employed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the great line, however, which was to unite the two\r\ncapitals, St. Petersburg and Moscow, it was decreed that this should be\r\nmade exclusively at the expense of the state, in order to retain in the\r\nhands of the government and in the general interest of the people a line of\r\ncommunication so important to the industry and the internal commerce of the\r\ncountry. The local proprietors agreed to surrender to the government,\r\ngratuitously, the lands necessary for this line.\r\n\r\nIt was very early understood that the railroad problem in Russia was much\r\nmore analogous to that in the United States than to that in England. The\r\nEmperor, therefore, in 1839, sent the Chevalier De Gerstner to the United\r\nStates to obtain information concerning the railroads of this country. It\r\nwas this person who obtained from the Emperor the concession for the short\r\nrailway from St. Petersburg to Zarskoe Selo, which had been opened in 1837,\r\nand who had also made a careful reconnoissance in 1835 for a line from St.\r\nPetersburg to Moscow, and had very strongly urged its construction on the\r\nAmerican plan. The more De Gerstner examined our roads, the more impressed\r\nhe was with the fitness of what he termed the American system of building\r\nand operating railroads to the needs of the empire of Russia. In one of his\r\nletters in explaining the causes of the cheap construction of American\r\nrailroads, after noting the fact that labor as well as material is much\r\ndearer in America than in Europe, he refers to the use of steep grades (93\r\nfeet to the mile) and sharp curves (600 feet radius), upon which the\r\nAmerican equipment works easily, to the use of labor saving machinery,\r\nparticularly to a steam excavating machine upon the railroad between\r\nWorcester and Springfield, and to the American system of wooden bridge\r\nbuilding, and says: \"The superstructure of the railroads in America is made\r\nconformable to the expected traffic, and costs therefore more or less\r\naccordingly;\" and he concludes, \"considering the whole, it appears that the\r\ncheapness of the American railroads has its foundation in the practical\r\nsense which predominates in their construction.\" Again, under the causes of\r\nthe cheap management of the American roads, he notes the less expensive\r\nadministration service, the low rate of speed, the use of the eight wheeled\r\ncars and the four-wheeled truck under the engines, and concludes: \"In my\r\nopinion it would be of great advantage for every railroad company in Europe\r\nto procure at least one such train\" (as those used in America). \"Those\r\ncompanies, however, whose works are yet under construction I can advise\r\nwith the fullest conviction to procure all their locomotive engines and\r\ntenders from America, and to construct their cars after the American\r\nmodel.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this report, the suggestions of De Gerstner were not at\r\nonce accepted. The magnitude of the enterprise would not admit of taking a\r\nfalse step. Further evidence was needed, and accordingly it was decided to\r\nsend a committee of engineer officers to various countries in Europe, and\r\nto the United States, to select such a system for the road and its\r\nequipment as would be best adapted to Russia. These officers, Colonels\r\nMelnikoff and Krofft, not only reported in the most decided manner in favor\r\nof the American methods, but also stated that of all persons with whom they\r\nhad communicated, no one had given them such full and satisfactory\r\ninformation upon all points, or had so impressed them as possessing\r\nextraordinary ability, as Major George W. Whistler. This led to his\r\nreceiving an invitation from the Emperor to go to Russia and become\r\nconsulting engineer for the great road which was to connect the imperial\r\ncity upon the Baltic with the ancient capital of the Czars.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the magnitude of the engineering works with which the\r\nolder countries abound, we can but regard with a feeling of pride the fact\r\nthat an American should have been selected for so high a trust by a\r\nEuropean government possessing every opportunity and means for securing the\r\nhighest professional talent which the world could offer. Nor should it be\r\nforgotten that the selection of our countryman did not arise from any\r\nnecessity which the Russian Government felt for obtaining professional aid\r\nfrom abroad, growing out of a lack of the requisite material at home. On\r\nthe contrary, the engineers of the Russian service are perhaps the most\r\naccomplished body of men to be found in any country. Selected in their\r\nyouth, irrespective of any artificial advantages of birth or position, but\r\nfor having a genius for such work, and trained to a degree of excellence in\r\nall of the sciences unsurpassed in any country, they stand deservedly in\r\nthe front rank. Such was the body of men with whom Major Whistler was\r\ncalled to co-operate, and whose professional duties, if not directed\r\nspecially by him, were to be controlled by his judgment.\r\n\r\nAccepting the position offered to him in so flattering a manner, he sailed\r\nfor St. Petersburg about mid-summer in 1842, being accompanied on his\r\nvoyage by Major Bouttattz, of the Russian Engineer Corps, who had been sent\r\nto this country by the Emperor as an escort. Arriving in St. Petersburg,\r\nand having learned the general character of the proposed work, he traveled\r\npartly by horse and partly on foot over the entire route, and made his\r\npreliminary report, which was at once accepted.\r\n\r\nThe plan contemplated the construction of a double track railroad 420 miles\r\nlong, perfect in all its parts, and equipped to its utmost necessity. The\r\nestimates amounted to nearly forty millions of dollars, and the time for\r\nits construction was reckoned at seven years. The line selected for the\r\nroad had no reference to intermediate points, and was the shortest\r\nattainable, due regard being paid to the cost of construction. It is nearly\r\nstraight, and passes over so level a country as to encounter no obstacle\r\nrequiring a grade exceeding 20 feet to the mile, and for most of the\r\ndistance it is level. The right of way taken was 400 feet in width\r\nthroughout the entire length. The roadbed was raised from six to ten feet\r\nabove the ordinary level of the country, and was 30 feet wide on top.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important questions to settle at the outset in regard to\r\nthis great work was the width of the gauge. At that time the opinion in\r\nEngland as well as in the United States among engineers was setting very\r\nstrongly in favor of a gauge wider than 4 feet 8½ inches, and the Russian\r\nengineers were decidedly in favor of such increased width. Major Whistler,\r\nhowever, in an elaborate report to the Count Kleinmichel argued very\r\nstrongly in favor of the ordinary gauge. To this a commission of the most\r\ndistinguished engineers in Russia replied, urging in the most forcible\r\nmanner the adoption of a gauge of six feet. Major Whistler rejoined in a\r\nreport which is one of the finest models of an engineering argument ever\r\nwritten, and in which we have perhaps the best view of the quality of his\r\nmind. In this document no point is omitted, each part of the question is\r\nhandled with the most consummate skill, the bearing of the several parts\r\nupon the whole is shown in the clearest possible manner, and in a style\r\nwhich could only come from one who from his own knowledge was thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with all the details, not only of the railroad, but of the\r\nlocomotive as well.\r\n\r\nIn this report the history of the ordinary gauge is given, with the origin\r\nof the standard of 4 feet 8½ inches; the questions of strength, stability,\r\nand capacity of cars, of the dimensions, proportions, and power of engines,\r\nthe speed of trains, resistances to motion, weight and strength of rails,\r\nthe cost of the roadway, and the removal of snow are carefully considered.\r\nThe various claims of the advocates for a wider gauge are fairly and\r\ncritically examined, and while the errors of his opponents are laid bare in\r\nthe most unsparing manner, the whole is done in a spirit so entirely\r\nunprejudiced, and with so evident a desire for the simple truth, as to\r\ncarry conviction to any fair minded person. The dry way, too, in which he\r\nsuggests that conclusions based upon actual results from existing railways\r\nare of more value than deductions from supposed conditions upon imaginary\r\nroads, is exceedingly entertaining. The result was the adoption of the\r\ngauge recommended by him, namely, five feet. Those who remember the \"Battle\r\nof the Gauges,\" and who know how much expense and trouble the wide gauge\r\nhas since caused, will appreciate the stand taken thus early by Major\r\nWhistler; and this was but one among many cases which might be mentioned to\r\nshow how comprehensive and far-reaching was his mind.\r\n\r\nThe roadbed of the St. Petersburg and Moscow Railway was made 30 feet wide\r\non top, for a double track of 5 foot gauge, with a gravel ballasting two\r\nfeet deep. The bridges were of wood, of the Howe pattern, no spans being\r\nover 200 feet in length. The stations at each end, and the station and\r\nengine houses along the line, were on a plan uniform throughout, and of the\r\nmost ample accommodation. Fuel and water stations were placed at suitable\r\npoints, and engine houses were provided 50 miles apart, built of the most\r\nsubstantial masonry, circular in form, 180 feet in diameter, surmounted by\r\na dome, and having stalls for 22 engines each. Repair shops were attached\r\nto every engine house, furnished with every tool or implement that the\r\nwants of the road could suggest.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of rolling stock and fixed machinery for the shops was\r\nfurnished by the American firm of Winans, Harrison & Eastwick, who from\r\nprevious acquaintance were known by Major Whistler to be skillful,\r\nenergetic, and reliable. Much diplomacy was needed to procure the large\r\nmoney advances for this part of the work, the whole Winans contract\r\namounting to nearly five millions of dollars; but the assurance of Major\r\nWhistler was a sufficient guarantee against disappointment or failure.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the plans for the work were all complete, and in 1844 the various\r\noperations along the line were well under way, and proceeding according to\r\nthe well arranged programme. In 1845 the work had progressed so far that\r\nthe construction of the rolling stock was commenced. The locomotives were\r\nof two classes, freight and passenger. The engines of each class were made\r\nthroughout from the same patterns, so that any part of one engine would fit\r\nthe same position on any other. The passenger engines had two pairs of\r\ndriving wheels, coupled, 6 feet in diameter, and a four wheeled truck\r\nsimilar to the modern American locomotive. The general dimensions were:\r\nWaist of boiler, 47 inches, 186 two inch tubes 10½ feet long; cylinders, 16\r\n× 22 inches. The freight engines had the same capacity of boiler and the\r\nsame number and length of tubes, three pairs of driving wheels, coupled, 4½\r\nfeet in diameter, a truck and cylinders 18 × 22 inches, and all uniform\r\nthroughout in workmanship and finish. The passenger cars were 56 feet long\r\nand 9½ feet wide, the first class carrying 33 passengers, the second class\r\n54, and the third class 80. They all had eight truck wheels under each, and\r\nelliptic steel springs. The freight cars were all 30 feet long and 9½ feet\r\nwide, made in a uniform manner, with eight truck wheels under each. The\r\nimperial saloon carriages were 80 feet long and 9½ feet wide, having double\r\ntrucks, or sixteen wheels under each. They were divided into five\r\ncompartments and fitted with every convenience.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1847 the Emperor Nicholas visited the mechanical works at\r\nAlexandroffsky, where the rolling stock was being made by the Messrs.\r\nWinans, in the shops prepared by them and supplied by Russian labor.\r\nEverything here was on the grandest scale, and the work was conducted under\r\nthe most perfect system. Upon this occasion the Emperor was so much\r\ngratified at what had already been accomplished that he conferred upon\r\nMajor Whistler the decoration of the Order of St. Anne. He had previously\r\nbeen pressed to wear the Russian uniform, which he promptly declined to do;\r\nbut there was no escape from the decoration without giving offense. He is\r\nsaid, however, to have generally contrived to hide it beneath his coat in\r\nsuch a manner that few ever saw it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Major Whistler was consulting engineer, Colonel Melnikoff\r\nbeing constructing engineer for the northern half of the road, and Colonel\r\nKrofft for the southern half; but as a matter of fact, by far the larger\r\npart of planning the construction in detail of both railway and equipment\r\nfell upon Major Whistler. There was also a permanent commission having\r\ngeneral charge of the construction of the road, of which the president was\r\nGeneral Destrem, one of the four French engineers whom Napoleon, at the\r\nrequest of the Emperor Alexander, sent to Russia for the service of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe year 1848 was a very trying one to Major Whistler. He had already on\r\nseveral occasions overtasked his strength, and had been obliged to rest.\r\nThis year the Asiatic cholera made its appearance. He sent his family\r\nabroad, but remained himself alone in his house. He would on no account at\r\nthis time leave his post, nor omit his periodical inspections along the\r\nline of the road, where the epidemic was raging. In November he had an\r\nattack of cholera, and while he recovered from it, he was left very weak.\r\nStill, he remained upon the work through the winter, though suffering much\r\nfrom a complication of diseases. As spring advanced he became much worse,\r\nand upon the 7th of April, 1849, he passed quietly away, the immediate\r\ncause of his death being a trouble with the heart.\r\n\r\nFuneral services were held in the Anglican (Episcopal) Church in St.\r\nPetersburg. His body was soon afterward carried to Boston and deposited\r\nbeneath St. Paul's Church; but the final interment took place at\r\nStonington. The kindness and attention of the Emperor and of all with whom\r\nMajor Whistler had been associated knew no bounds. Everything was done to\r\ncomfort and aid his wife, and when she left St. Petersburg the Emperor sent\r\nher in his private barge to the mouth of the Baltic. \"It was not only,\"\r\nsays one who knew him weil, \"through his skill, ability, and experience as\r\nan engineer that Major Whistler was particularly qualified for and\r\neminently successful in the important task he performed so well in Russia.\r\nHis military training and bearing, his polished manner, good humor, sense\r\nof honor, knowledge of a language (French) in which he could converse with\r\nofficers of the government, his resolution in adhering to what he thought\r\nwas right, and in meeting difficulties only to surmount them, with other\r\nadmirable personal qualities, made him soon, and during his whole residence\r\nin Russia, much liked and trusted by all persons by whom he was known, from\r\nthe Emperor down to the peasant. Such is the reputation he left behind him,\r\nand which is given to him in Russia to this day.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the firm of Winans, Harrison and Eastwick had already furnished the\r\nroad with 162 locomotives, 72 passenger and 2,580 freight cars. They had\r\nalso arranged to instruct a suitable number of Russian mechanics to take\r\ncharge of the machinery when completed. The road was finished its entire\r\nlength in 1850, being opened for passenger and freight traffic on the 25th\r\nof September of that year, in two divisions, experimentally, and finally\r\nopened for through business on November 1, 1851. In all of its construction\r\nand equipment it was essentially American of the best kind, everything\r\nbeing made under a carefully devised system, by which the greatest economy\r\nin maintenance and in management should be possible. The use of standard\r\npatterns, uniformity in design and duplication of parts was applied, not\r\nonly to the rolling stock, but to the railroad as well, wherever it was\r\npossible. Indeed, the whole undertaking in all its parts bore the impress\r\nof one master mind.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Major Whistler the government with jealous care prevented\r\nany changes whatever being made in his plans, including those which had not\r\nbeen carried out as well as those already in process of execution. An\r\nAmerican engineer, Major T.S. Brown, was invited to Russia to succeed Major\r\nWhistler as consulting engineer. The services of the Messrs. Winans also\r\nwere so satisfactory to the government that a new contract was afterward\r\nmade, upon the completion of the road, for the maintenance and the future\r\nconstruction of rolling stock.\r\n\r\nWhile the great railroad was the principal work of Major Whistler in\r\nRussia, he was also consulted in regard to all the important engineering\r\nworks of the period. The fortifications at Cronstadt, the Naval Arsenal and\r\ndocks at the same place, the plans for improving the Dwina at Archangel,\r\nthe great iron roof of the Riding House at St. Petersburg, and the iron\r\nbridge over the Neva all received his attention. The government was\r\naccustomed to rely upon his judgment in all cases requiring the exercise of\r\nthe highest combination of science and practical skill; and here, with a\r\nhappy tact peculiarly his own, he secured the warm friendship of men whose\r\nprofessional acts he found himself called upon in the exercise of his high\r\ntrust in many cases to condemn. The Russians are proverbially jealous of\r\nstrangers, and no higher evidence of their appreciation of the sterling\r\nhonesty of Major Whistler, and of his sound, discriminating judgment, could\r\nbe afforded than the fact that all his recommendations on the great\r\nquestions of internal improvement, opposed as many of them were to the\r\nprinciples which had previously obtained, and which were sanctioned by\r\nusage, were yet carried out by the government to the smallest details.\r\n\r\nWhile in Russia Major Whistler was sometimes placed in positions most\r\ntrying to him. It is said that some of the corps of native engineers, many\r\nof whom were nobles, while compelled to look up to him officially, were\r\ninclined to look down upon him socially, and exercised their supposed\r\nprivileges in this respect so as to annoy him exceedingly, for he had not\r\nknown in his own country what it was to be the social inferior of any one.\r\nThe Emperor, hearing of this annoyance, determined to stop it; so, taking\r\nadvantage of a day when he knew the engineer corps would visit a celebrated\r\ngallery of art, he entered it while they were there, and without at first\r\nnoticing any one else, looked around for Major Whistler, and seeing him,\r\nwent directly toward him, took his arm, and walked slowly with him entirely\r\naround the gallery. After this the conduct of the nobles was all that could\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\nMajor Whistler's salary while in Russia was $12,000 a year; a sum no more\r\nthan necessary for living in a style befitting his position. He had\r\nabundant opportunity for making money, but this his nice sense of honor\r\nforbade. It is even stated that he would never allow any invention to be\r\nused on the road that could by any possibility be of any profit to himself\r\nor to any of his friends. He was continually besieged by American\r\ninventors, but in vain. The honor of the profession he regarded as a sacred\r\ntrust. He served the Emperor with the fidelity that characterized all his\r\nactions. His unswerving devotion to his duty was fully appreciated, and it\r\nis said that no American in Russia, except John Quincy Adams, was ever held\r\nin so high estimation.\r\n\r\nMajor Whistler married for his first wife Mary, daughter of Dr. Foster\r\nSwift of the U.S. Army, and Deborah, daughter of Capt. Thomas Delano of\r\nNantucket. By her he had three children: Deborah, his only daughter, who\r\nmarried Seymour Haden of London, a surgeon, but later and better known for\r\nhis skill in etching; George William, who became an engineer and railway\r\nmanager, and who went to Russia, and finally died at Brighton, in England,\r\nDec. 24, 1869; Joseph Swift, born at New London, Aug. 12, 1825, and who\r\ndied at Stonington, Jan. 1, 1840. His first wife died Dec. 9, 1827, at the\r\nearly age of 23 years, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, in the shade of\r\nthe monument erected to the memory of her husband by the loving hands of\r\nhis professional brethren. For his second wife he married Anna Matilda,\r\ndaughter of Dr. Charles Donald McNeill of Wilmington, N.C., and sister of\r\nhis friend and associate, William Gibbs McNeill. By her he had five sons:\r\nJames Abbot McNeill, the noted artist, and William Gibbs McNeill, a well\r\nknown physician, both now living in London; Kirk Boott, born in Stonington,\r\nJuly 16, 1838, and who died at Springfield, July 10, 1842; Charles Donald,\r\nborn in Springfield, Aug. 27, 1841, and who died in Russia, Sept. 24, 1843;\r\nand John Bouttattz, who was born and who died at St. Petersburg, having\r\nlived but little more than a year. His second wife, who outlived him,\r\nreturned to America, and remained here during the education of her\r\nchildren, after which she moved to England. She died Jan. 31, 1881, at the\r\nage of 76 years, and was buried at Hastings.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held in the office of the Panama Railroad Company in New York,\r\nAugust 27, 1849, for the purpose of suggesting measures expressive of their\r\nrespect for the memory of Major Whistler, Wm. H. Sidell being chairman and\r\nA.W. Craven secretary, it was resolved that a monument in Greenwood\r\nCemetery would be a suitable mode of expressing the feelings of the\r\nprofession in this respect, and that an association be formed to collect\r\nfunds and take all necessary steps to carry out the work. At this meeting\r\nCapt. William H. Swift was appointed president, Major T.S. Brown\r\ntreasurer, and A.W. Craven secretary, and Messrs. Horatio Allen, W.C.\r\nYoung, J.W. Adams, and A.W. Craven were appointed a committee to procure\r\ndesigns and estimates, and to select a suitable piece of ground. The design\r\nwas made by Mr. Adams, and the ground was given by Mr. Kirkwood. The\r\nmonument is a beautiful structure of red standstone, about 15 feet high,\r\nand stands in \"Twilight Dell.\" Upon the several faces are the following\r\ninscriptions:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upon the Front_.\r\n\r\nIN MEMORY OF\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER,\r\nCIVIL ENGINEER,\r\nBORN AT FORT WAYNE, INDIANA, MAY, 1800,\r\nDIED AT ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA, APRIL, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upon the Right Side_.\r\n\r\nEDUCATED AT THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY. HE\r\nRETIRED FROM THE ARMY IN 1833 AND BECAME\r\nASSOCIATED WITH WILLIAM GIBBS M'NEILL.\r\nTHEY WERE IN THEIR TIME ACKNOWLEDGED TO\r\nBE AT THE HEAD OF THEIR PROFESSION IN THIS\r\nCOUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upon the Back_.\r\n\r\nHE WAS DISTINGUISHED FOR THEORETICAL AND\r\nPRACTICAL ABILITY, COUPLED WITH SOUND\r\nJUDGMENT AND GREAT INTEGRITY. IN 1842 HE\r\nWAS INVITED TO RUSSIA BY THE EMPEROR\r\nNICHOLAS, AND DIED THERE WHILE CONSTRUCTING\r\nTHE ST. PETERSBURG & MOSCOW RAILROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Upon the Left Side_.\r\n\r\nTHIS CENOTAPH IS A MONUMENT OF THE ESTEEM\r\nAND AFFECTION OF HIS FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS.\r\n\r\nWhile the monument thus raised to the memory of the great engineer stands\r\nin that most delightful of the cities of the dead, his worn-out body rests\r\nin the quaint old town of Stonington. It was here that his several children\r\nhad been buried, and he had frequently expressed a desire that when he\r\nshould die he might be placed by their side. A deputation of engineers who\r\nhad been in their early years associated with him attended the simple\r\nservice which was held over his grave, and all felt as they turned away\r\nthat they had bid farewell to such a man as the world has not often seen.\r\n\r\nIn person Major Whistler was of medium size and well made. His face showed\r\nthe finest type of manly beauty, combined with a delicacy almost feminine.\r\nIn private life he was greatly prized for his natural qualities of heart\r\nand mind, his regard for the feelings of others, and his unvarying\r\nkindness, especially toward his inferiors and his young assistants. His\r\nduties and his travels in this and in other countries brought him in\r\ncontact with men of every rank; and it is safe to say that the more\r\ncompetent those who knew him were to judge, the more highly was he valued\r\nby them. A close observer, with a keen sense of humor and unfailing tact,\r\nfond of personal anecdote, and with a mind stored with recollections from\r\nassociation with every grade of society, he was a most engaging companion.\r\nThe charm of his manner was not conventional, nor due to intercourse with\r\nrefined society, but came from a sense of delicacy and a refinement of\r\nfeeling which was innate, and which showed itself in him under all\r\ncircumstances. He was in the widest and best sense of the word a gentleman;\r\nand he was a gentleman outwardly because he was a gentleman at heart.\r\n\r\nAs an engineer, Whistler's works speak for him. He was eminently a\r\npractical man, remarkable for steadiness of judgment and for sound business\r\nsense. Whatever he did was so well done that he was naturally followed as a\r\nmodel by those who were seeking a high standard. Others may have excelled\r\nin extraordinary boldness or in some remarkable specialty, but in all that\r\nrounds out the perfect engineer, whether natural characteristics,\r\nprofessional training, or the well digested results of long and valuable\r\nexperience, we look in vain for his superior, and those who knew him best\r\nwill hesitate to acknowledge his equal.--_Journal of the Association of\r\nEngineering Societies_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING LANTERN PICTURES BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT ON BROMIDE PLATES FROM\r\nVARIOUS SIZES.\r\n\r\nBy A. PUMPHREY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read before the Birmingham Photographic Society. Reported in the\r\n_Photo. News_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that there is no plan that is so simple for\r\nproducing transparencies as contact printing, but in this, as in other\r\nphotographic matters, one method of work will not answer all needs.\r\nReproduction in the camera, using daylight to illuminate the negative,\r\nenables the operator to reduce or enlarge in every direction, but the\r\nlantern is a winter instrument, and comes in for demand and use during the\r\nshort days. When even the professional photographer has not enough light to\r\nget through his orders, how can the amateur get the needed daylight if\r\nphotography be only the pursuit in spare time? Besides, there are days in\r\nour large towns when what daylight there is is so yellow from smoke or fog\r\nas to have little actinic power. These considerations and needs have led me\r\nto experiment and test what can be done with artificial light, and I think\r\nI have made the way clear for actual work without further experiment. I\r\nhave not been able by any arrangement of reflected light to get power\r\nenough to print negatives of the ordinary density, and have only succeeded\r\nby causing the light to be equally dispersed over the negative by a lens as\r\nused in the optical lantern, but the arrangements required are somewhat\r\ndifferent to that of the enlarging lantern.\r\n\r\nThe following is the plan by which I have succeeded best in the production\r\nof transparencies:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nB is a lamp with a circular wick, which burns petroleum and gives a good\r\nbody of light.\r\n\r\nC is a frame for holding the negative, on the opposite side of which is a\r\ndouble convex lens facing the light.\r\n\r\nD is the camera and lens.\r\n\r\nAll these must be placed in a line, so that the best part of the light, the\r\ncenter of the condenser, and the lens are of equal height.\r\n\r\nThe method of working is as follows: The lamp, B, is placed at such a\r\ndistance from the condenser that the rays come to a focus and enter the\r\nlens; the negative is then placed in the frame, the focus obtained, and the\r\nsize of reduction adjusted by moving the camera nearer to or further from\r\nthe condenser and negative. In doing this no attention need be paid to the\r\nlight properly covering the field, as that cannot be adjusted while the\r\nnegative is in its place. When the size and focus are obtained, remove the\r\nnegative, and carefully move the lamp till it illuminates the ground glass\r\nequally all over, by a disk of light free from color.\r\n\r\nThe negative can then be replaced, and no further adjustment will be needed\r\nfor any further reproduction of the same size.\r\n\r\nThere is one point that requires attention: The lens used in the camera\r\nshould be a doublet of about 6 inch focus (in reproducing 8½ × 6½ or\r\nsmaller sizes), and the stop used must not be a very small one, not less\r\nthan ½ inch diameter. If a smaller stop is used, an even disk of light is\r\nnot obtained, but ample definition is obtainable with the size stop\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement described, a single lens is used for the condenser, not\r\nbecause it is better than a double one, as is general for such purposes,\r\nbut because it is quite sufficient for the purpose. Of course, a large\r\ncondenser is both expensive and cumbersome. There is, therefore, no\r\nadvantage in using a combination if a single lens will answer.\r\n\r\nIn reproducing lantern pictures from half-plate negatives, the time\r\nrequired on my lantern plates is from two to four minutes, using 6 inch\r\ncondenser. For whole plate negatives, from two to six minutes with a 9 inch\r\ncondenser. In working in this way it is easy to be developing one picture\r\nwhile exposing another.\r\n\r\nThe condenser must be of such a size that it will cover the plate from\r\ncorner to corner. The best part of an 8½ × 6½ negative will be covered by a\r\n9 inch condenser, and a 6½ × 4¾ by a 6 inch condenser.\r\n\r\nWith this arrangement it will be easy to reproduce from half or whole plate\r\nnegatives or any intermediate sizes quite independently of daylight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN TONING GELATINO-CHLORIDE PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Photographic News_ we take the following: The use of paper coated\r\nwith a gelatino-citro-chloride emulsion in place of albumenized paper\r\nappears to be becoming daily more common. Successful toning has generally\r\nbeen the difficulty with such paper, the alkaline baths commonly in use\r\nwith albumenized having proved unsuitable for toning this paper. On the\r\nwhole, the bath that has given the best results is one containing, in\r\naddition to gold, a small quantity of hypo and a considerable quantity of\r\nsulphocyanide of ammonium. Such a bath tones very rapidly, and gives most\r\npleasing colors. It appears, moreover, to be impossible to overtone the\r\ncitro-chloro emulsion paper with it in the sense that it is possible to\r\novertone prints on albumenized paper with the ordinary alkaline bath. That\r\nis to say, it is impossible to produce a slaty gray image. The result of\r\nprolonged toning is merely an image of an engraving black color. Of this,\r\nhowever, we shall say more hereafter. We wish first of all to refer to an\r\nelaborate series of experiments by Lionel Clark on the effects of various\r\ntoning baths used with the gelatino-citro-chloride paper.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments we have before us at the time of writing,\r\nand we may at once say that, from the manner in which the experiments have\r\nbeen carried out and in which the results have been tabulated, Lionel\r\nClark's work forms a very useful contribution to our photographic\r\nknowledge, and a contribution that will become more and more useful, the\r\nlonger the results of the experiments are kept. A number of small prints\r\nhave been prepared. Of these several--in most cases, three--have been toned\r\nby a certain bath, and each print has been torn in two. One-half has been\r\ntreated with bichloride of mercury, so as to bleach such portion of the\r\nimage as is of silver, and finally the prints--the two halves of each being\r\nbrought close together--have been mounted in groups, each group containing\r\nall the prints toned by a certain formula, with full information tabulated.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement we could suggest in the arrangement is that all the\r\nprints should have been from the same negative, or from only three\r\nnegatives, so that we should have prints from the same negatives in every\r\ngroup, and should the better be able to compare the results of the toning\r\nbaths. Probably, however, the indifferent light of the present season of\r\nthe year made it difficult to get a sufficiency of prints from one\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of the toning baths used and of the\r\nappearance of the prints.

It is very inferior to that in No. 3, the color less pleasant, and\r\nthe appearance generally as if the details of the lights had been bleached\r\nby the large quantity either of hypo or of sulphocyanide of potassium.\r\n\r\n5.--Gold chloride......................  1 gr.\r\n    Sulphocyanide of potassium......... 50 gr.\r\n    Hyposulphite of soda...............  ½ gr.\r\n    Water..............................  2 oz.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this description of formula there are no prints, but the\r\nfollowing is written: \"These prints were completely destroyed, the\r\nsulphocyanide of potassium (probably) dissolving off the gelatine.\"\r\n\r\n6.--Gold chloride......................  1 gr.\r\n    Sulphocyanide of potassium......... 20 gr.\r\n    Hypo...............................  5 gr.\r\n    Carbonate of soda.................. 10 gr.\r\n    Water..............................  2 oz.\r\n\r\nThis it will be seen is the same as 4, but that the solution is rendered\r\nalkaline with carbonate of soda. The result of the alkalinity certainly\r\nappears to be good, the color is more pleasing than that produced by No. 4,\r\nand there is less appearance of bleaching. It must be borne in mind in this\r\nconnection that the paper itself is strongly acid, and that, unless special\r\nmeans be taken to prevent it, the toning bath is sure to be more or less\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n7.--Gold chloride......................  1 gr.\r\n    Acetate of soda.................... 30 gr.\r\n    Water..............................  2 oz.\r\n\r\nThe color of the prints toned by this bath is not exceedingly pleasing.

Two out of the three prints are much\r\ntoo dark, indicating, perhaps, that this toning bath did not have any\r\ntendency to reduce the intensity of the image.\r\n\r\nThe general lesson taught by Clark's experiments is that the sulphocyanide\r\nbath gives better results than any other. A certain proportion of the\r\ningredients--namely, that of bath No. 3--gives better results than any\r\nother proportions tried, and about as good as any that could be hoped for.\r\nAny of the ordinary alkaline toning baths may be used, but they all give\r\nresults inferior to those got by the sulphocyanide bath. The best of the\r\nordinary baths is, however, the phosphate of soda.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word as to those parts of the prints which have been treated with\r\nbichloride of mercury. The thing that strikes us as remarkable in\r\nconnection with them is that in them the image has scarcely suffered any\r\nreduction of intensity at all. In most cases there has been a disagreeable\r\nchange of color, but it is almost entirely confined to the whites and\r\nlighter tints, which are turned to a more or less dirty yellow. Even in the\r\ncase of the prints toned by bath No. 10, where the image is quite red, it\r\nhas suffered no appreciable reduction of intensity.\r\n\r\nThis would indicate that an unusually large proportion of the toned image\r\nconsists of gold, and this idea is confirmed by the fact that to tone a\r\nsheet of gelatino-chloro-citrate paper requires several times as much gold\r\nas to tone a sheet of albumenized paper. Indeed, we believe that, with the\r\nemulsion paper, it is possible to replace the whole of the silver of the\r\nimage with gold, thereby producing a permanent print. We have already said\r\nthat the print may be left for any reasonable length of time in the toning\r\nbath without the destruction of its appearance, and we cannot but suppose\r\nthat a very long immersion results in a complete substitution of gold for\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"SENSIM\" PREPARING BOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a perspective view of the machine, Fig. 2 a sectional\r\nelevation, and Fig. 3 a plan. In the ordinary screw gill box, the screws\r\nwhich traverse the gills are uniform in their pitch, so that a draught is\r\nonly obtained between the feed rollers and the first gill, between the last\r\ngill of the first set and the first of the second, and between the last\r\ngill of the second set and the delivery roller. As thus arranged, the gills\r\nare really not active workers after their first draw during the remainder\r\nof their traverse, but simply carriers of the wool to the next set. It is\r\nsomewhat remarkable, as may indeed be said of every invention, that this\r\nfact has only been just observed, and suggested an improvement. There is no\r\nreason why each gill should not be continuously working to the end of the\r\ntraverse, and only cease during its return to its first position. The\r\nperception of this has led to several attempts to realize this\r\nimprovement. The inventor in the present case seems to have solved the\r\nproblem in a very perfect manner by the introduction of gill screws of a\r\ngradually increasing pitch, by which the progress of the gills, B, through\r\nthe box is constantly undergoing acceleration to the end, as will be\r\nobvious from the construction of the screws, A and A¹, until they are\r\npassed down in the usual manner, and returned by the screws, C and C¹,\r\nwhich are, as usual, of uniform pitch. The two sets of screws are so\r\nadjusted as to almost meet in the middle, so that the gills of the first\r\nset finish their forward movement close to the point where the second\r\ncommence. The bottom screws, C, of the first set of gills, B, are actuated\r\nby bevel wheels on a cross shaft engaging with bevel wheels on their outer\r\nextremity, the cross shaft being geared to the main shaft. The screws, C¹,\r\nof the second set of gills from two longitudinal shafts are connected by\r\nbevel gearing to the main shaft. Intermediate wheels communicate motion\r\nfrom change wheels on the longitudinal shafts to the wheels on the screw,\r\nC¹, traversing the second set of gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--\"SENSIM\" SCREW GILL PREPARING BOX.]\r\n\r\nThe feed and delivery rollers, D and E, are operated by gearing connected\r\nto worms on longitudinal shafts. These worms engage with worm wheels on\r\ncross shafts, which are provided at their outer ends with change wheels\r\nengaging with other change wheels on the arbors of the bottom feed and\r\ndelivery rollers, D and E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--\"SENSIM\" SCREW GILL--SECTIONAL ELEVATION.]\r\n\r\nThe speeds are so adjusted that the fibers are delivered to the first set\r\nof gills at a speed approximately equal to the speed at which these start\r\ntheir traverse. The gills in the second set begin their journey at a pace\r\nwhich slightly exceeds that at which those of the first finish their\r\ntraverse. These paces are of course regulated by the class and nature of\r\nthe fibers under operation. The delivery rollers, E, take off the fibers at\r\na rate slightly exceeding that of the gills delivering it to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--\"SENSIM\" SCREW GILL--PLAN.]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary gill box, the feed and delivery rollers are fluted, in\r\norder the better to retain in the first instance their grip upon the wool\r\npassing through, and in the second to enable them to overcome any\r\nresistance that might be offered to drawing the material. It thus often\r\nhappens in this class of machines that a large percentage of the fibers are\r\nbroken, and thus much waste is made. The substitution of plain rollers in\r\nboth these positions obviates most of this mischief, while in combination\r\nwith the other parts of the arrangement it is almost precluded altogether.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from what we have said that the special features of this\r\nmachine, which may be summarized as, first, the use of a screw thread of\r\ngraduated pitch; second, an increased length of screw action and an\r\nadditional number of fallers; and third, the use of light plain rollers in\r\nplace of heavy fluted back and front rollers, enable the inventor to justly\r\nclaim the acquisition of a number of advantages, which may be enumerated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the gills from mere carriers into constant workers\r\nduring the whole of their outward traverse, by which the work is done much\r\nmore efficiently, more gently, and in greater quantity than by the old\r\nsystem with uniformly pitched screws. A great improvement in the quality of\r\nthe work, resulting from the breakage of fiber being, if not entirely\r\nobviated, nearly. An increased yield and better quality of top, owing to\r\nthe absence of broken fiber, and consequent diminution of noil and waste.\r\nThe better working of cotted wools, which can be brought to a proper\r\ncondition with far more facility and with diminished risk of breaking pins\r\nthan before. A saving in labor, space, and plant also results from the fact\r\nthat the wool is as well opened and straightened for carding with a passage\r\nthrough a pair of improved boxes as it is in going through four of the\r\nordinary ones, while the quantity will be as great. Owing to the first\r\nfeature referred to, which distributes the strain over all the gills, a\r\ngreater weight of wool can be put into them and a higher speed be worked.\r\nThe space occupied and the attendance required is only about half that of\r\nboxes required to do the same amount of work on the old system. Taking the\r\nflutes out of the feed and delivery rollers, and greatly diminishing their\r\nweight, it is estimated will reduce by 90 per cent. the wear and tear of\r\nthe leather aprons, and thus to that extent diminish a very heavy annual\r\noutlay incident to the system generally in vogue. A considerable saving of\r\npower for driving and of time and cost of repairs from the bending and\r\nbreakage of pins also results.

Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 585, p. 9340.]\r\n\r\nBy Prof. OLIVER LODGE.\r\n\r\nLECTURE II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe points to which I specially called your attention in the first lecture,\r\nand which it is necessary to recapitulate to-day, are these: (1) That coal\r\nis distilled, or burned partly into gas, before it can be burned. (2) That\r\nthe gas, so given off, if mixed with carbonic acid, cannot be expected to\r\nburn properly or completely. (3) That to burn the gas, a sufficient supply\r\nof air must be introduced at a temperature not low enough to cool the gases\r\nbelow their igniting point. (4) That in stoking a fire, a small amount\r\nshould be added at a time because of the heat required to warm and distill\r\nthe fresh coal. (5) That fresh coal should be put in front of or at the\r\nbottom of a fire, so that the gas may be thoroughly heated by the\r\nincandescent mass above and thus, if there be sufficient air, have a chance\r\nof burning. A fire may be inverted, so that the draught proceeds through it\r\ndownward. This is the arrangement in several stoves, and in them, of\r\ncourse, fresh coal is put at the top.\r\n\r\nTwo simple principles are at the root of all fire management: (1) Coal gas\r\nmust be at a certain temperature before it can burn; and (2) it must have a\r\nsufficient supply of air. Very simple, very obvious, but also extremely\r\nimportant, and frequently altogether ignored. In a common open fire they\r\nare both ignored. Coal is put on the top of a glowing mass of charcoal, and\r\nthe gas distilled off is for a longtime much too cold for ignition, and\r\nwhen it does catch fire it is too mixed with carbonic acid to burn\r\ncompletely or steadily. In order to satisfy the first condition better, and\r\nkeep the gases at a higher temperature, Dr. Pridgin Teale arranges a\r\nsloping fire-clay slab above his fire. On this the gases play, and its\r\ntemperature helps them to ignite. It also acts as a radiator, and is said\r\nto be very efficient.\r\n\r\nIn a close stove and in many furnaces the second condition is violated;\r\nthere is an insufficient supply of air; fresh coal is put on, and the\r\nfeeding doors are shut. Gas is distilled off, but where is it to get any\r\nair from? How on earth can it be expected to burn? Whether it be expected\r\nor not, it certainly does not burn, and such a stove is nothing else than a\r\ngas works, making crude gas, and wasting it--it is a soot and smoke\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nMost slow combustion stoves are apt to err in this way; you make the\r\ncombustion slow by cutting off air, and you run the risk of stopping the\r\ncombustion altogether. When you wish a stove to burn better, it is\r\ncustomary to open a trap door below the fuel; this makes the red hot mass\r\nglow more vigorously, but the oxygen will soon become CO_{2}, and be unable\r\nto burn the gas.\r\n\r\nThe right way to check the ardor of a stove is not to shut off the air\r\nsupply and make it distill its gases unconsumed, but to admit so much air\r\nabove the fire that the draught is checked by the chimney ceasing to draw\r\nso fiercely. You at the same time secure better ventilation; and if the\r\nfire becomes visible to the room so much the better and more cheerful. But\r\nif you open up the top of a stove like this, it becomes, to all intents and\r\npurposes, an open fire. Quite so, and in many respects, therefore, an open\r\nfire is an improvement on a close stove. An open fire has faults, and it\r\ncertainly wastes heat up the chimney. A close stove may have more\r\nfaults--it wastes less _heat_, but it is liable to waste _gas_ up the\r\nchimney--not necessarily visible or smoky gas; it may waste it from coke or\r\nanthracite, as CO.\r\n\r\nYou now easily perceive the principles on which so-called smoke consumers\r\nare based. They are all special arrangements or appendages to a furnace for\r\npermitting complete combustion by satisfying the two conditions which had\r\nbeen violated in its original construction. But there is this difficulty\r\nabout the air supply to a furnace: the needful amount is variable if the\r\nstoking be intermittent, and if you let in more than the needful amount,\r\nyou are unnecessarily wasting heat and cooling the boiler, or whatever it\r\nis, by a draught of cold air.\r\n\r\nEvery time a fresh shovelful is thrown on, a great production of gas\r\noccurs, and if it is to flame it must have a correspondingly great supply\r\nof air. After a time, when the mass has become red hot, it can get nearly\r\nenough air through the bars. But at first the evolution of gas actually\r\nchecks the draught. But remember that although no smoke is visible from a\r\nglowing mass, it by no means follows that its combustion is perfect. On an\r\nopen fire it probably is perfect, but not necessarily in a close stove or\r\nfurnace. If you diminish the supply of air much (as by clogging your\r\nfurnace bars and keeping the doors shut), you will be merely distilling\r\ncarbonic oxide up the chimney--a poisonous gas, of which probably a\r\nconsiderable quantity is frequently given off from close stoves.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at some smoke consumers. The diagrams show those of Chubb,\r\nGrowthorpe, Ireland and Lowndes, and of Gregory. You see that they all\r\nadmit air at the \"bridge\" or back of the fire, and that this air is warmed\r\neither by passing under or round the furnace, or in one case through hollow\r\nfire bars. The regulation of the air supply is effected by hand, and it is\r\nclear that some of these arrangements are liable to admit an unnecessary\r\nsupply of air, while others scarcely admit enough, especially when fresh\r\ncoal is put on. This is the difficulty with all these arrangements when\r\nused with ordinary hand--i.e., intermittent--stoking. Two plans are open to\r\nus to overcome the difficulty. Either the stoking and the air supply must\r\nboth be regular and continuous, or the air supply be made intermittent to\r\nsuit the stoking. The first method is carried out in any of the many forms\r\nof mechanical stoker, of which this of Sinclair's is an admirable specimen.\r\nFresh fuel is perpetually being pushed on in front, and by alternate\r\nmovement of the fire bars the fire is kept in perpetual motion till the\r\nashes drop out at the back. To such an arrangement as this a steady air\r\nsupply can be adjusted, and if the boiler demand is constant there is no\r\nneed for smoke, and an inferior fuel may be used. The other plan is to vary\r\nthe air supply to suit the stoking. This is effected by Prideaux automatic\r\nfurnace doors, which have louvers to remain open for a certain time after\r\nthe doors are shut, and so to admit extra air immediately after coal has\r\nbeen put on, the supply gradually decreasing as distillation ceases. The\r\nworst of air admitted through chinks in the doors, or through partly open\r\ndoors, is that it is admitted cold, and scarcely gets thoroughly warm\r\nbefore it is among the stuff it has to burn. Still this is not a fatal\r\nobjection, though a hot blast would be better. Nothing can be worse than\r\nshoveling on a quantity of coal and shutting it up completely. Every\r\ncondition of combustion is thus violated, and the intended furnace is a\r\nmere gas retort.\r\n\r\n_Gas Producers_.--Suppose the conditions of combustion are purposely\r\nviolated; we at once have a gas producer. That is all gas producers are,\r\nextra bad stoves or furnaces, not always much worse than things which\r\npretend to serve for combustion. Consider how ordinary gas is made. There\r\nis a red-hot retort or cylinder plunged in a furnace. Into this tube you\r\nshovel a quantity of coal, which flames vigorously as long as the door is\r\nopen, but when it is full you shut the door, thus cutting off the supply of\r\nair and extinguishing the flame. Gas is now simply distilled, and passes\r\nalong pipes to be purified and stored. You perceive at once that the\r\ndifference between a gas retort and an ordinary furnace with closed doors\r\nand half choked fire bars is not very great. Consumption of smoke! It is\r\nnot smoke consumers you really want, it is fuel consumers. You distill your\r\nfuel instead of burning it, in fully one-half, might I not say nine-tenths,\r\nof existing furnaces and close stoves. But in an ordinary gas retort the\r\nheat required to distill the gas is furnished by an outside fire; this is\r\nonly necessary when you require lighting gas, with no admixture of carbonic\r\nacid and as little carbonic oxide as possible. If you wish for heating gas,\r\nyou need no outside fire; a small fire at the bottom of a mass of coal will\r\nserve to distill it, and you will have most of the carbon also converted\r\ninto gas. Here, for instance, is Siemens' gas producer. The mass of coal is\r\nburning at the bottom, with a very limited supply of air. The carbonic acid\r\nformed rises over the glowing coke, and takes up another atom of carbon to\r\nform the combustible gas carbonic oxide. This and the hot nitrogen passing\r\nover and through the coal above distill away its volatile constituents, and\r\nthe whole mass of gas leaves by the exit pipe. Some art is needed in\r\nadjusting the path of the gases distilled from the fresh coal with\r\nreference to the hot mass below. If they pass too readily, and at too low a\r\ntemperature, to the exit pipe, this is apt to get choked with tar and dense\r\nhydrocarbons. If it is carried down near or through the hot fuel below, the\r\nhydrocarbons are decomposed over much, and the quality of the gas becomes\r\npoor. Moreover, it is not possible to make the gases pass freely through a\r\nmass of hot coke; it is apt to get clogged. The best plan is to make the\r\nhydrocarbon gas pass over and near a red-hot surface, so as to have its\r\nheaviest hydrocarbons decomposed, but so as to leave all those which are\r\nable to pass away as gas uninjured, for it is to the presence of these that\r\nthe gas will owe its richness as a combustible material, especially when\r\nradiant heat is made use of.\r\n\r\nThe only inert and useless gas in an arrangement like this is the nitrogen\r\nof the air, which being in large quantities does act as a serious diluent.\r\nTo diminish the proportion of nitrogen, steam is often injected as well as\r\nair. The glowing coke can decompose the steam, forming carbonic oxide and\r\nhydrogen, both combustible. But of course no extra energy can be gained by\r\nthe use of steam in this way; all the energy must come from the coke, the\r\nsteam being already a perfectly burned product; the use of steam is merely\r\nto serve as a vehicle for converting the carbon into a convenient gaseous\r\nequivalent. Moreover, steam injected into coke cannot keep up the\r\ncombustion; it would soon put the fire out unless air is introduced too.\r\nSome air is necessary to keep up the combustion, and therefore some\r\nnitrogen is unavoidable. But some steam is advisable in every gas producer,\r\nunless pure oxygen could be used instead of air; or unless some substance\r\nlike quicklime, which holds its oxygen with less vigor than carbon does,\r\nwere mixed with the coke and used to maintain the heat necessary for\r\ndistillation. A well known gas producer for small scale use is Dowson's.\r\nSteam is superheated in a coil of pipe, and blown through glowing\r\nanthracite along with air. The gas which comes off consists of 20 per cent.\r\nhydrogen, 30 per cent. carbonic oxide, 3 per cent. carbonic acid, and 47\r\nper cent. nitrogen. It is a weak gas, but it serves for gas engines, and is\r\nused, I believe, by Thompson, of Leeds, for firing glass and pottery in a\r\ngas kiln. It is said to cost 4d. per 1,000 ft., and to be half as good as\r\ncoal gas.\r\n\r\nFor furnace work, where gas is needed in large quantities, it must be made\r\non the spot. And what I want to insist upon is this, that all\r\nwell-regulated furnaces are gas retorts and combustion chambers combined.\r\nYou may talk of burning coal, but you can't do it; you must distill it\r\nfirst, and you may either waste the gas so formed or you may burn it\r\nproperly. The thing is to let in not too much air, but just air enough.\r\nLook, for instance, at Minton's oven for firing pottery. Round the central\r\nchamber are the coal hoppers, and from each of these gas is distilled,\r\npasses into the central chamber, where the ware is stacked, and meeting\r\nwith an adjusted supply of air as it rises, it burns in a large flame,\r\nwhich extends through the whole space and swathes the material to be\r\nheated. It makes its exit by a central hole in the floor, and thence rises\r\nby flues to a common opening above. When these ovens are in thorough\r\naction, nothing visible escapes. The smoke from ordinary potters' ovens is\r\nin Staffordshire a familiar nuisance. In the Siemens gas producer and\r\nfurnace, of which Mr. Frederick Siemens has been good enough to lend me\r\nthis diagram, the gas is not made so closely on the spot, the gas retort\r\nand furnace being separated by a hundred yards or so in order to give the\r\nrequired propelling force. But the principle is the same; the coal is first\r\ndistilled, then burnt. But to get high temperature, the air supply to the\r\nfurnace must be heated, and there must be no excess. If this is carried on\r\nby means of otherwise waste heat we have the regenerative principle, so\r\nadmirably applied by the Brothers Siemens, where the waste heat of the\r\nproducts of combustion is used to heat the incoming air and gas supply. The\r\nreversing arrangement by which the temperature of such a furnace can be\r\ngradually worked up from ordinary flame temperature to something near the\r\ndissociation point of gases, far above the melting point of steel, is well\r\nknown, and has already been described in this place. Mr. Siemens has lent\r\nme this beautiful model of the most recent form of his furnace, showing its\r\napplication to steel making and to glass working.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and, at first sight, astounding thing about this\r\nfurnace is, however, that it works solely by radiation. The flames do not\r\ntouch the material to be heated; they burn above it, and radiate their heat\r\ndown to it. This I regard as one of the most important discoveries in the\r\nwhole subject, viz., that to get the highest temperature and greatest\r\neconomy out of the combustion of coal, one must work directly by radiant\r\nheat only, all other heat being utilized indirectly to warm the air and gas\r\nsupply, and thus to raise the flame to an intensely high temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show the effect of supplying a common gas flame with warm air\r\nby holding it over a cylinder packed with wire gauze which has been made\r\nred hot. A common burner held over such a hot air shaft burns far more\r\nbrightly and whitely. There is no question but that this is the plan to get\r\ngood illumination out of gas combustion; and many regenerative burners are\r\nnow in the market, all depending on this principle, and utilizing the waste\r\nheat to make a high temperature flame. But although it is evidently the\r\nright way to get light, it was by no means evidently the right way to get\r\nheat. Yet so it turns out, not by warming solid objects or by dull warm\r\nsurfaces, but by the brilliant radiation of the hottest flame that can be\r\nprocured, will rooms be warmed in the future. And if one wants to boil a\r\nkettle, it will be done, not by putting it into a non-luminous flame, and\r\nso interfering with the combustion, but by holding it near to a freely\r\nburning regenerated flame, and using the radiation only. Making toast is\r\nthe symbol of all the heating of the future, provided we regard Mr.\r\nSiemens' view as well established.\r\n\r\nThe ideas are founded on something like the following considerations: Flame\r\ncannot touch a cold surface, i.e., one below the temperature of combustion,\r\nbecause by the contact it would be put out. Hence, between a flame and the\r\nsurface to be heated by it there always intervenes a comparatively cool\r\nspace, across which heat must pass by radiation. It is by radiation\r\nultimately, therefore, that all bodies get heated. This being so, it is\r\nwell to increase the radiating power of flame as much as possible. Now,\r\nradiating power depends on two things: the presence of solid matter in the\r\nflame in a fine state of subdivision, and the temperature to which it is\r\nheated. Solid matter is most easily provided by burning a gas rich in dense\r\nhydrocarbons, not a poor and non-luminous gas. To mix the gas with air so\r\nas to destroy and burn up these hydrocarbons seems therefore to be a\r\nretrograde step, useful undoubtedly in certain cases, as in the Bunsen\r\nflame of the laboratory, but not the ideal method of combustion. The ideal\r\nmethod looks to the use of a very rich gas, and the burning of it with a\r\nmaximum of luminosity. The hot products of combustion must give up their\r\nheat by contact. It is for them that cross tubes in boilers are useful.\r\nThey have no combustion to be interfered with by cold contacts. The _flame_\r\nonly should be free.\r\n\r\nThe second condition of radiation was high temperature. What limits the\r\ntemperature of a flame? Dissociation or splitting up of a compound by heat.\r\nSo soon as the temperature reaches the dissociation point at which the\r\ncompound can no longer exist, combustion ceases. Anything short of this may\r\ntheoretically be obtained.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Siemens believes, and adduces some evidence to prove, that the\r\ndissociation point is not a constant and definite temperature for a given\r\ncompound; it depends entirely upon whether solid or foreign surfaces are\r\npresent or not. These it is which appear to be an efficient cause of\r\ndissociation, and which, therefore, limit the temperature of flame. In the\r\nabsence of all solid contact, Mr. Siemens believes that dissociation, if it\r\noccur at all, occurs at an enormously higher temperature, and that the\r\ntemperature of free flame can be raised to almost any extent. Whether this\r\nbe so or not, his radiating flames are most successful, and the fact that\r\nlarge quantities of steel are now melted by mere flame radiation speaks\r\nwell for the correctness of the theory upon which his practice has been\r\nbased.\r\n\r\n_Use of Small Coal_.--Meanwhile, we may just consider how we ought to deal\r\nwith solid fuel, whether for the purpose of making gas from it or for\r\nburning it _in situ_. The question arises, In what form ought solid fuel to\r\nbe--ought it to be in lumps or in powder? Universal practice says lumps,\r\nbut some theoretical considerations would have suggested powder. Remember,\r\ncombustion is a chemical action, and when a chemist wishes to act on a\r\nsolid easily, he always pulverizes it as a first step.\r\n\r\nIs it not possible that compacting small coal into lumps is a wrong\r\noperation, and that we ought rather to think of breaking big coal down into\r\nslack? The idea was suggested to me by Sir W. Thomson in a chance\r\nconversation, and it struck me at once as a brilliant one. The amount of\r\ncoal wasted by being in the form of slack is very great. Thousands of tons\r\nare never raised from the pits because the price is too low to pay for the\r\nraising--in some places it is only 1s. 6d. a ton. Mr. McMillan calculates\r\nthat 130,000 tons of breeze, or powdered coke, is produced every year by\r\nthe Gas Light and Coke Company alone, and its price is 3s. a ton at the\r\nworks, or 5s. delivered.\r\n\r\nThe low price and refuse character of small coal is, of course, owing to\r\nthe fact that no ordinary furnace can burn it. But picture to yourself a\r\nblast of hot air into which powdered coal is sifted from above like ground\r\ncoffee, or like chaff in a thrashing mill, and see how rapidly and\r\ncompletely it might burn. Fine dust in a flour mill is so combustible as to\r\nbe explosive and dangerous, and Mr. Galloway has shown that many colliery\r\nexplosions are due not to the presence of gas so much as the presence of\r\nfine coal-dust suspended in the air. If only fine enough, then such dust is\r\neminently combustible, and a blast containing it might become a veritable\r\nsheet of flame. (Blow lycopodium through a flame.) Feed the coal into a\r\nsort of coffee-mill, there let it be ground and carried forward by a blast\r\nto the furnace where it is to be burned. If the thing would work at all,\r\nalmost any kind of refuse fuel could be burned--sawdust, tan, cinder heaps,\r\norganic rubbish of all kinds. The only condition is that it be fine enough.\r\n\r\nAttempts in this direction have been made by Mr. T.R. Crampton, by Messrs.\r\nWhelpley and Storer, and by Mr. G.K. Stephenson; but a difficulty has\r\npresented itself which seems at present to be insuperable, that the slag\r\nfluxes the walls of the furnace, and at that high temperature destroys\r\nthem. If it be feasible to keep the flame out of contact with solid\r\nsurfaces, however, perhaps even this difficulty can be overcome.\r\n\r\nSome success in blast burning of dust fuel has been attained in the more\r\ncommonplace method of the blacksmith's forge, and a boiler furnace is\r\narranged at Messrs. Donkin's works at Bermondsey on this principle. A\r\npressure of about half an inch of water is produced by a fan and used to\r\ndrive air through the bars into a chimney draw of another half-inch. The\r\nfire bars are protected from the high temperatures by having blades which\r\ndip into water, and so keep fairly cool. A totally different method of\r\nburning dust fuel by smouldering is attained in M. Ferret's low temperature\r\nfurnace by exposing the fuel in a series of broad, shallow trays to a\r\ngentle draught of air. The fuel is fed into the top of such a furnace, and\r\neither by raking or by shaking it descends occasionally, stage by stage,\r\ntill it arrives at the bottom, where it is utterly inorganic and mere\r\nrefuse. A beautiful earthworm economy of the last dregs of combustible\r\nmatter in any kind of refuse can thus be attained. Such methods of\r\ncombustion as this, though valuable, are plainly of limited application;\r\nbut for the great bulk of fuel consumption some gas-making process must be\r\nlooked to. No crude combustion of solid fuel can give ultimate perfection.\r\n\r\nCoal tar products, though not so expensive as they were some time back, are\r\nstill too valuable entirely to waste, and the importance of exceedingly\r\ncheap and fertilizing manure in the reclamation of waste lands and the\r\nimprovement of soil is a question likely to become of most supreme\r\nimportance in this overcrowded island. Indeed, if we are to believe the\r\nsocial philosophers, the naturally fertile lands of the earth may before\r\nlong become insufficient for the needs of the human race; and posterity may\r\nthen be largely dependent for their daily bread upon the fertilizing\r\nessences of the stored-up plants of the carboniferous epoch, just as we are\r\nlargely dependent on the stored-up sunlight of that period for our light,\r\nour warmth, and our power. They will not then burn crude coal, therefore.\r\nThey will carefully distill it--extract its valuable juices--and will\r\nsupply for combustion only its carbureted hydrogen and its carbon in some\r\ngaseous or finely divided form.\r\n\r\nGaseous fuel is more manageable in every way than solid fuel, and is far\r\nmore easily and reliably conveyed from place to place. Dr. Siemens, you\r\nremember, expected that coal would not even be raised, but turned into gas\r\nin the pits, to rise by its own buoyancy to be burnt on the surface\r\nwherever wanted. And not only will the useful products be first removed and\r\nsaved, its sulphur will be removed too; not because it is valuable, but\r\nbecause its product of combustion is a poisonous nuisance. Depend upon it,\r\nthe cities of the future will not allow people to turn sulphurous acid\r\nwholesale into the air, there to oxidize and become oil of vitriol. Even if\r\nit entails a slight strain upon the purse they will, I hope, be wise enough\r\nto prefer it to the more serious strain upon their lungs. We forbid sulphur\r\nas much as possible in our lighting gas, because we find it is deleterious\r\nin our rooms. But what is London but one huge room packed with over four\r\nmillions of inhabitants? The air of a city is limited, fearfully limited,\r\nand we allow all this horrible stuff to be belched out of hundreds of\r\nthousands of chimneys all day long.\r\n\r\nGet up and see London at four or five in the morning, and compare it with\r\nfour or five in the afternoon; the contrast is painful. A city might be\r\ndelightful, but you make it loathsome; not only by smoke, indeed, but still\r\ngreatly by smoke. When no one is about, then the air is almost pure; have\r\nit well fouled before you rise to enjoy it. Where no one lives, the breeze\r\nof heaven still blows; where human life is thickest, there it is not fit to\r\nlive. Is it not an anomaly, is it not farcical? What term is strong enough\r\nto stigmatize such suicidal folly? But we will not be in earnest, and our\r\nrulers will talk, and our lives will go on and go out, and next century\r\nwill be soon upon us, and here is a reform gigantic, ready to our hands,\r\neasy to accomplish, really easy to accomplish if the right heads and\r\nvigorous means were devoted to it. Surely something will be done.\r\n\r\nThe following references may be found useful in seeking for more detailed\r\ninformation: Report of the Smoke Abatement Committee for 1882, by Chandler\r\nRoberts and D.K.

For ages,\r\nscrew conveyers for corn and meal have been employed, and in spite of the\r\npower consumed and the rubbing of the material conveyed, they have\r\nremained, with little exception, unimproved and without a rival. Now we\r\nhave a new conveyer, which, says _The Engineer_, in its simplicity excels\r\nanything brought out for many years, and, until it is seen at work, makes a\r\nheavier demand upon one's credulity than is often made by new mechanical\r\ninventions. As will be seen from the engravings, the new conveyer consists\r\nsimply of a spiral of round steel rod mounted upon a quickly revolving\r\nspindle by means of suitable clamps and arms. The spiral as made for\r\nEngland is of 5/8 in. steel rod, because English people would not be\r\ninclined to try what is really sufficient in most cases, namely, a mere\r\nwire. The working of this spiral as a conveyer is simply magical. A 6 in.\r\nspiral delivers 800 bushels per hour at 100 revolutions per minute, and\r\nmore in proportion at higher speeds. A little 4 in. spiral delivers 200\r\nbushels per hour at 100 revolutions per minute. It seems to act as a mere\r\npersuader. The spiral moves a small quantity, and sets the whole contents\r\nof the trough in motion. In fact, it embodies the great essentials of\r\nsuccess, namely, simplicity, great capacity for work, and cheapness. It is\r\nthe invention of Mr. J. Little, and is made by the Anti-friction Conveyer\r\nCompany, of 59 Mark Lane, London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTI-FRICTION CONVEYER WITH CASING OR TROUGH--END\r\nVIEW WITH HANGER.]\r\n\r\nSince the days of Archimedes, who is credited with being the inventor of\r\nthe screw, there has not been any improvement in the principle of the worm\r\nconveyer.

METHODS OF ILLUMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Torches_ consist of a bundle of loosely twisted threads which has been\r\nimmersed in a mixture formed of two parts, by weight, of beeswax, eight of\r\nresin, and one of tallow. In warm, dry weather, these torches when lighted\r\nlast for two hours when at rest, and for an hour and a quarter on a march.\r\nA good light is obtained by spacing them 20 or 30 yards apart.\r\n\r\nAnother style of torch consists of a cardboard cylinder fitted with a\r\ncomposition consisting of 100 parts of saltpeter, 60 of sulphur, 8 of\r\npriming powder, and 30 of pulverized glass, the whole sifted and well\r\nmixed. This torch, which burns for a quarter of an hour, illuminates a\r\nspace within a radius of 180 or 200 yards very well.\r\n\r\nThe _tourteau goudronné_ (lit. \"tarred coke\") is merely a ring formed of\r\nold lunt or of cords well beaten with a mallet (Fig. 10). This ring is\r\nfirst impregnated with a composition formed of 20 parts of black pitch\r\nand 1 of tallow, and then with another one formed of equal parts of\r\nblack pitch and resin. One of these torches will burn for an hour in\r\ncalm weather, and half an hour in the wind. Rain does not affect the\r\nburning of it. These rings are usually arranged in pairs on brackets\r\nwith two branches and an upper circle, the whole of iron, and these\r\nbrackets are spaced a hundred yards apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 9 TO 16.--VARIOUS PYROTECHNIC DEVICES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 17.--ILLUMINATING ROCKET.]\r\n\r\nA _tarred fascine_ consists of a small fagot of dry wood, 20 inches in\r\nlength by 4 in diameter, covered with the same composition as the preceding\r\n(Fig. 11). Fascines thus prepared burn for about half an hour. They are\r\nplaced upright in supports, and these latter are located at intervals of\r\ntwenty yards.\r\n\r\nThe _Lamarre compositions_ are all formed of a combustible substance, such\r\nas boiled oil,[1] of a substance that burns, such as chlorate of potash,\r\nand of various coloring salts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For preparation see page 9304 of SUPPLEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe _white composition_ used for charging fire balls and 1½ inch flambeaux\r\nis formed of 500 parts of powdered chlorate of potash, 1,500 of nitrate of\r\nbaryta, 120 of light wood charcoal, and 250 of boiled oil. Another white\r\ncomposition, used for charging ¾ inch flambeaux, consists of 1,000 parts of\r\nchlorate of potash, 1,000 of nitrate of baryta, and 175 of boiled oil.\r\n\r\nThe _red composition_ used for making red flambeaux and percussion signals\r\nconsists of 1,800 parts of chlorate of potash, 300 of oxalate of strontia,\r\n300 of carbonate of strontia, 48 of whitewood charcoal, 240 of boiled oil,\r\n6 of oil, and 14 of gum lac.\r\n\r\nA red or white _Lamarre flambeau_ consists of a sheet rubber tube filled\r\nwith one of the above-named compositions. The lower extremity of this tube\r\nis closed with a cork. When the charging has been effected, the flambeau is\r\nprimed by inserting a quickmatch in the composition. This is simply lighted\r\nwith a match or a live coal. The composition of the Lamarre quickmatch will\r\nbe given hereafter.\r\n\r\nA Lamarre flambeau 1½ inch in diameter and 3 inches in length will burn for\r\nabout thirty-five minutes. One of the same length, and ¾ inch in diameter,\r\nlasts but a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nA _fire ball_ consists of an open work sack internally strengthened with a\r\nsheet iron shell, and fitted with the Lamarre white composition. After the\r\ncharging has been done, the sphere is wound with string, which is made to\r\nadhere by means of tar, and canvas is then wrapped around the whole.\r\nProjectiles of this kind, which have diameters of 6, 8, 11, and 13 inches,\r\nare shot from mortars.\r\n\r\nThe _illuminating grenade_ (Fig. 13) consists of a sphere of vulcanized\r\nrubber, two inches in diameter, charged with the Lamarre white composition.\r\nThe sphere contains an aperture to allow of the insertion of a fuse. The\r\npriming is effected by means of a tin tube filled with a composition\r\nconsisting of three parts of priming powder, two of sulphur, and one of\r\nsaltpeter. These grenades are thrown either by hand or with a sling, and\r\nthey may likewise be shot from mortars. Each of these projectiles\r\nilluminates a circle thirty feet in diameter for a space of time that\r\nvaries, according to the wind, from sixty to eighty seconds.\r\n\r\nThe _percussion signal_ (Fig. 14) consists of a cylinder of zinc, one inch\r\nin diameter and one and a quarter inch in length, filled with Lamarre red\r\ncomposition. It is provided with a wooden handle, and the fuse consists of\r\na capsule which is exploded by striking it against some rough object. This\r\nsignal burns for nearly a minute.\r\n\r\n_Belgian illuminating balls and cylinders_ are canvas bags filled with\r\ncertain compositions. The cylinders, five inches in diameter and seven in\r\nlength, are charged with a mixture of six parts of sulphur, two of priming\r\npowder, one of antimony, and two of beeswax cut up into thin slices. They\r\nare primed with a quickmatch. The balls, one and a half inch in diameter,\r\nare charged with a composition consisting of twelve parts of saltpeter,\r\neight of sulphur, four of priming powder, two of sawdust, two of beeswax,\r\nand two of tallow. They are thrown by hand. They burn for six minutes.\r\n\r\n_Illuminating kegs_ (Fig. 15) consist of powder kegs filled with shavings\r\ncovered with pitch. An aperture two or three inches in diameter is made in\r\neach head, and then a large number of holes, half an inch in diameter, and\r\narranged quincuncially, are bored in the staves and heads. All these\r\napertures are filled with port-fires.\r\n\r\nThe _illuminating rocket_ (Fig. 17) consists of a sheet iron cartridge,\r\n_a_, containing a composition designed to give it motion, of a cylinder,\r\n_b_, of sheet iron, capped with a cone of the same material and containing\r\nilluminating stars of Lamarre composition and an explosive for expelling\r\nthem, and, finally, of a directing stick, _c_. Priming is effected by means\r\nof a bunch of quickmatches inclosed in a cardboard tube placed in contact\r\nwith the propelling composition. This latter is the same as that used in\r\nsignal rockets. As in the case of the latter, a space is left in the axis\r\nof the cartridges. These rockets are fired from a trough placed at an\r\ninclination of fifty or sixty degrees. Those of three inches illuminate the\r\nearth for a distance of 900 yards. They may be used to advantage in the\r\noperation of signaling.\r\n\r\nA _parachute fire_ is a device designed to be ejected from a pot at the end\r\nof the rocket's travel, and to emit a bright light during its slow descent.\r\nIt consists of a small cylindrical cardboard box (Fig. 16) filled with\r\ncommon star paste or Lamarre stars, and attached to a parachute, _e_, by\r\nmeans of a small brass chain, _d_.\r\n\r\nTo make this parachute, we cut a circle ten feet in diameter out of a piece\r\nof calico, and divide its circumference into ten or twelve equal parts. At\r\neach point of division we attach a piece of fine hempen cord about three\r\nfeet in length, and connect these cords with each other, as well as with\r\nthe suspension chain, by ligatures that are protected against the fire by\r\nmeans of balls of sized paper.\r\n\r\nIn rockets designed to receive these parachutes, a small cavity is reserved\r\nat the extremity of the cartridge for the reception of 225 grains of\r\npowder. To fill the pot, the chain, _d_, is rolled spirally around the box,\r\n_c_, and the latter is covered with the parachute, _e_, which has been\r\nfolded in plaits, and then folded lengthwise alternately in one direction\r\nand the other.\r\n\r\nThe _parachute port-fire_ consists of a cardboard tube of from quarter to\r\nhalf an inch in diameter, and from four to five inches in length, closed at\r\none extremity and filled with star paste. This is connected by a brass wire\r\nwith a cotton parachute eight inches in diameter. A rocket pot is capable\r\nof holding twenty of these port-fires.\r\n\r\nParachute fires and port-fires are used to advantage in the operation of\r\nsignaling.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT IN LAYING OUT FRAMES OF VESSELS--THE FRAME TRACER.\r\n\r\nBy GUSTAVE SONNENBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid the long and time-consuming laying out of a boat by ordinates and\r\nabscissas, I have constructed a handy apparatus, by which it is possible\r\nwithout much trouble to obtain the sections of a vessel graphically and\r\nsufficiently accurate. The description of its construction is given with\r\nreference to the accompanying cut. A is a wooden rod of rectangular\r\nsection, to which are adapted two brackets, a_{1} a_{2}, lined with India\r\nrubber or leather; a_{1} is fixed to the wood, a_{2} is of metal, and, like\r\nthe movable block of a slide gauge, moves along A. In the same plane is a\r\nsecond rod, perpendicular to A, and attached thereto, which is perforated\r\nby a number of holes. A revolving pin, C, is adapted to pass through these\r\nholes, to which a socket, D, is pivoted, C acting as its axis. To prevent\r\nthis pin from falling out, it is secured by a nut behind the rod. Through\r\nthe socket, D, runs a rod, E, which carries the guide point, s_{1}, and\r\npencil, s_{2}. Over s_{1} a rubber band is stretched, to prevent injury to\r\nthe varnish of the boat. Back of and to A and B a drawing board is\r\nattached, over which a sheet of paper is stretched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRAME TRACER.]\r\n\r\nThe method of obtaining a section line is as follows: The rod, A, is placed\r\nacross the gunwale and perpendicular to the axis of the boat, and its\r\nanterior vertical face is adjusted to each frame of the boat which it is\r\ndesired to reproduce. By means of the brackets, a_{1} and a_{2}, A is fixed\r\nin place. The bolt, C, is now placed in the perforations already alluded\r\nto, which are recognized as most available for producing the constructional\r\ndiagram. At the same time the position of the pencil point, s_{2}, must be\r\nchosen for obtaining the best results.\r\n\r\nNext the operator moves along the side of the boat the sharpened end,\r\ns_{1}, of the rod, E, and thus for the curve from keel to gunwale, s_{2}\r\ndescribes a construction line. It is at once evident that a_{2}, for\r\nexample, corresponds to the point, a_{1}. The apparatus is now removed and\r\nplaced on the working floor. If, reversing things, the point, s_{1}, is\r\ncarried around the construction curve, the point, s_{2}, will inscribe the\r\ndesired section in its natural dimensions. This operation is best conducted\r\nafter one has chosen and described all the construction curves of the\r\nboat. Next, the different section lines are determined, one by one, by the\r\nreversed method above described. The result is a half section of the boat;\r\nthe other symmetrical half is easily obtained.\r\n\r\nIf the whole process is repeated for the other side of the boat, tracing\r\npaper being used instead of drawing paper, the boat may be tested for\r\nsymmetry of building, a good control for the value of the ship. For\r\nmeasuring boats, as for clubs and regattas, for seamen, and often for the\r\nso-called _Spranzen_ (copying) of English models, my apparatus, I doubt\r\nnot, will be very useful.--_Neuste Erfindungen und Erfahrungen_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAR FOR FIRING RETORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of gas engineers has been forcibly directed to the use of tar\r\nas a fuel for the firing of retorts, now that this once high-priced\r\nmaterial is suffering, like everything else (but, perhaps, to a more marked\r\nextent), by what is called \"depression in trade.\" In fact, it has in many\r\nplaces reached so low a commercial value that it is profitable to burn it\r\nas a fuel. Happily, this is not the case at Nottingham; and our interest in\r\ntar as a fuel is more experimental, in view of what may happen if a further\r\nfall in tar products sets in. I have abandoned the use of steam injection\r\nfor our experimental tar fires in favor of another system. The steam\r\ninjectors produce excellent heats, but are rather intermittent in their\r\naction, and the steam they require is a serious item, and not always\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTar being a _pseudo_ liquid fuel, in arranging for its combustion one has\r\nto provide for the 20 to 25 per cent. of solid carbon which it contains,\r\nand which is deposited in the furnace as a kind of coke or breeze on the\r\ndistillation of the volatile portions, which are much more easily consumed\r\nthan the tar coke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAR FIRE\r\n\r\nI have adopted is one that can be readily adapted to an ordinary coke\r\nfurnace, and be as readily removed, leaving the furnace as before. The\r\ndiagram conveys some idea of the method adopted. An iron frame, d, standing\r\non legs on the floor just in front of the furnace door, carries three fire\r\ntiles on iron bearers. The top one, a, is not moved, and serves to shield\r\nthe upper face of the tile, b, from the fierce heat radiated from the\r\nfurnace, and also causes the air that rushes into the furnace between the\r\ntiles, a and b, to travel over the upper face of the tile, b, on which the\r\ntar flows, thereby keeping it cool, and preventing the tar from bursting\r\ninto flame until it reaches the edge of the tile, b, over the whole edge of\r\nwhich it is made to run fairly well by a distributing arrangement. A rapid\r\ncombustion takes place here, but some unconsumed tar falls on to the bed\r\nbelow. About one-third of the grate area is filled up by a fire tile, and\r\non this the tar coke falls. The tile, c, is moved away from time to time,\r\nand the tar coke that accumulates in front of it is pushed back on to the\r\nfire bars, e, at the back of the furnace, to be there consumed. Air is thus\r\nadmitted, by three narrow slot-like openings, to the front of the furnace\r\nbetween the tiles, a, b, and c, and under c and through the fire bars, e.\r\nThe air openings below are about three times the area of the openings in\r\nthe front of the furnace; but as the openings between the fire bars and the\r\ntiles are always more or less covered by tar coke, it is impossible to say\r\nwhat the effective openings are. This disposition answers admirably, and\r\nrequires little attention. Three minutes per hour per fire seems to be the\r\naverage, and the labor is of a very light kind, consisting of clearing the\r\npassages between the tiles, and occasionally pushing back the coke on to\r\nthe fire bars. These latter are not interfered with, and will not require\r\ncleaning unless any bricks in the furnace have been melted, when a bed of\r\nslag will be found on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNT OF DRAUGHT\r\n\r\nrequired for these fires is very small, and less than with coke firing. I\r\nfind that 0.08 in. vacuum is sufficient with tar fires, and 0.25 in. for\r\ncoke fires. The fires would require less attention with more draught and\r\nlarger tar supply, as the apertures do not so easily close with a sharp\r\ndraught, and the tar is better carried forward into the furnace. A regular\r\nfeed of tar is required, and considerable difficulty seems to have been\r\nexperienced in obtaining this. So long as we employed ordinary forms of\r\ntaps or valves, so long (even with filtration) did we experience\r\ndifficulties with the flow of viscous tar. But on the construction of\r\nvalves specially designed for the regulation of its flow, the difficulty\r\nimmediately disappeared, and there is no longer the slightest trouble on\r\nthis account. The labor connected with the feeding of furnaces with coke\r\nand cleaning fires from clinker is of a very arduous and heavy nature.\r\nEight coke fires are normally considered to be work for one man. A lad\r\ncould work sixteen of these tar fires.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF FURNACE GASES.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been paid to the composition of the furnace\r\ngases from the tar fires. The slightest deficiency in the air supply, of\r\ncourse, results in the immediate production of smoke, so that the damper\r\nmust be set to provide always a sufficient air supply.

For instance, Geissler's pump requires a considerable\r\nnumber of taps, that of Alvergniat and Toepler is very fragile in\r\nconsequence of its complicated system of tubes connected together, and that\r\nof Sprengel is only suitable for certain purposes.\r\n\r\nThe new mercury pump constructed by Messrs. Greisser and Friedrichs, at\r\nStutzerbach, is remarkable for simplicity of construction and for the ease\r\nwith which it is manipulated, and also because it enables us to arrive at a\r\nperfect vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of this pump is, according to _La Lumiere Electrique_, a\r\ntap of peculiar construction. It has two tubes placed obliquely in respect\r\nto its axis, which, when we turn this tap 90 or 180 degrees, are brought\r\nopposite one of the three openings in the body of the tap.\r\n\r\nThus the striæ that are formed between the hollowed-out parts of the tap do\r\nnot affect its tightness; and, besides, the turns of the tap have for their\r\nprincipal positions 90 and 180 degrees, instead of 45 and 90 degrees, as in\r\nGeissler's pump.\r\n\r\nThe working of the apparatus, which only requires the manipulation of a\r\nsingle tap, is very simple. When the mercury is raised, the tap is turned\r\nin such a manner that the surplus of the liquid can pass into the enlarged\r\nappendage, a, placed above the tap, and communication is then cut off by\r\nturning the tap to 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe mercury reservoir having descended, the bulb empties itself, and then\r\nthe tap is turned on again, in order to establish communication with the\r\nexhausting tube. The tap is then closed, the mercury ascends again, and\r\nthis action keeps on repeating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNO ELECTRICITY FROM THE CONDENSATION OF VAPOR.--It has been maintained by\r\nPalmieri and others that the condensation of vapor results in the\r\nproduction of an electrical charge. Herr S. Kalischer has renewed his\r\ninvestigations upon this point, and believes that he has proved that no\r\nelectricity results from such condensation. Atmospheric vapor was condensed\r\nupon a vessel coated with tin foil, filled with ice, carefully insulated,\r\nand connected with a very sensitive electrometer. No evidence could be\r\nobtained of electricity.--_Ann. der Physik und Chemie_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting contribution was made by M. Mercadier in a recent number of\r\nthe _Comptes Rendus de l'Academie Francaise_. On the ground of some novel\r\nand some already accepted experimental evidence, M. Mercadier holds that\r\nthe mechanism by virtue of which the telephonic diaphragms execute their\r\nmovements is analogous to, if not identical with, that by which solid\r\nbodies of any form, a wall for instance, transmit to one of their surfaces\r\nall the vibratory movements of any kind which are produced in the air in\r\ncontact with the other surface. It is a phenomenon or resonance. Movements\r\ncorresponding to particular sounds may be superposed in slender diaphragms,\r\nbut this superposition must necessarily be disturbing under all but\r\nexceptional circumstances. In proof of this view, it is cited that\r\ndiaphragms much too rigid, or charged with irregularly distributed masses\r\nover the surface, or pierced with holes, or otherwise evidently unfitted\r\nfor the purpose, are available for transmission. They will likewise serve\r\nwhen feathers, wool, wood, metals, mica, and other substances to the\r\nthickness of four inches are placed between the diaphragm and the source of\r\nvibratory movement. The magnetic field does not alter these relations in\r\nany way. The real diaphragm may be removed altogether. It is sufficient to\r\nreplace it by a few grains of iron filings thrown on the pole covered with\r\na piece of pasteboard or paper. Such a telephone works distinctly although\r\nfeebly; but any slender flexible disk, metallic or not, spread over across\r\nthe opening of the cover of the instrument, with one or two tenths of a\r\ngramme (three grains) of iron filings, will yield results of increased and\r\neven ordinary intensity. This is the iron filing telephone, which is\r\nreversible; for a given magnetic field there is a certain weight of iron\r\nfilings for maximum intensity. It appears thus that the advantage of the\r\niron diaphragm over iron filings reduces itself to presenting in a certain\r\nvolume a much more considerable number of magnetic molecules to the action\r\nof the field. The iron diaphragm increases the telephonic intensity, but it\r\nis by no means indispensable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ELECTRO-DISSOLUTION, AND ITS USE AS REGARDS ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nBy H.N. WARREN, Research Analyst.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same principle that electro-dissolution is used for the estimation\r\nof combined carbon in steel, etc., I have lately varied the experiment by\r\nintroducing, instead of steel, iron containing a certain percentage of\r\nboron, and, having connected the respective boride with the positive pole\r\nof a powerful battery, and to the negative a plate of platinum, using as a\r\nsolvent dilute sulphuric acid, I observed, after the lapse of about twelve\r\nhours, the iron had entirely passed into solution, and a considerable\r\namount of brownish precipitate had collected at the bottom of the vessel,\r\nintercepted by flakes of graphite and carbon; the precipitate, having been\r\ncollected on a filter paper, washed, and dried, on examination proved to be\r\namorphous boron, containing graphite and other impurities, which had become\r\nchemically introduced during the preparation of the boron compound. The\r\nboron was next introduced into a small clay crucible, and intensely heated\r\nin a current of hydrogen gas, for the purpose of rendering it more dense\r\nand destroying its pyrophoric properties, and was lastly introduced into a\r\ncombustion tubing, heated to bright redness, and a stream of dry carbonic\r\nanhydride passed over it, in order to separate the carbon, finally pure\r\nboron being obtained.\r\n\r\nIn like manner silicon-eisen, containing 9 per cent. of silicon, was\r\ntreated, but not giving so satisfactory a result. A small quantity only of\r\nsilicon separates in the uncombined form, the greater quantity separating\r\nin the form of silica, SiO_{2}, the amorphous silicon so obtained\r\napparently being more prone to oxidation than the boron so obtained.\r\n\r\nFerrous sulphide was next similarly treated, and gave, after the lapse of a\r\nfew hours, a copious blackish precipitation of sulphur, and possessing\r\nproperties similar to the sulphur obtained by dissolving sulphides such as\r\ncupric sulphide in dilute nitric acid, in all other respects resembling\r\ncommon sulphur.\r\n\r\nPhosphides of iron, zinc, etc., were next introduced, and gave, besides\r\ncarbon and other impurities, a residue containing a large percentage of\r\nphosphorus, which differed from ordinary phosphorus with respect to its\r\ninsolubility in carbon disulphide, and which resembled the reaction in the\r\ncase with silicon-eisen rather than that of the boron compound, insomuch\r\nthat a large quantity of the phosphorus had passed into solution.\r\n\r\nA rod of impure copper, containing arsenic, iron, zinc, and other\r\nimpurities, was next substituted, using hydrochloric acid as a solvent in\r\nplace of sulphuric acid. In the course of a day the copper had entirely\r\ndissolved and precipitated itself on the negative electrode, the impurities\r\nremaining in solution. The copper, after having been washed, dried, and\r\nweighed, gave identical results with regard to percentage with a careful\r\ngravimetric estimation. I have lately used this method, and obtained\r\nexcellent results with respect to the analysis of commercial copper,\r\nespecially in the estimation of small quantities of arsenic, thus enabling\r\nthe experimenter to perform his investigation on a much larger quantity\r\nthan when precipitation is resorted to, at the same time avoiding the\r\nprecipitated copper carrying down with it the arsenic. I have in this\r\nmanner detected arsenic in commercial copper when all other methods have\r\ntotally failed. I have also found the above method especially applicable\r\nwith respect to the analysis of brass.\r\n\r\nWith respect to ammoniacal dissolution, which I will briefly mention, a rod\r\ncomposed of an alloy of copper and silver was experimented upon, the copper\r\nbecoming entirely dissolved and precipitating itself on the platinum\r\nelectrode, the whole of the silver remaining suspended to the positive\r\nelectrode in an aborescent form. Arsenide of zinc was similarly treated,\r\nthe arsenic becoming precipitated in like manner on the platinum electrode.\r\nVarious other alloys, being experimented upon, gave similar results.\r\n\r\nI may also, in the last instance, mention that I have found the above\r\nmethods of electro-dissolution peculiarly adapted for the preparation of\r\nunstable compounds such as stannic nitrate, potassic ferrate, ferric\r\nacetate, which are decomposed on the application of heat, and in some\r\ninstances have succeeded by the following means of crystallizing the\r\nresulting compound obtained.--_Chem.

Professor Scheibler, a chemist\r\nwell known for his researches on sugar, has observed that the determination\r\nof the quantity of that substance contained in a liquid gives different\r\nresults, according as it is done by Trommer's method or with the\r\npolariscope. As sugar nowadays is exclusively dealt with according to the\r\ndegree of polarization, this fact is of enormous value in trade. Scheibler\r\nhas isolated a substance that is more powerful in that respect than grape\r\nsugar. Dr. Leo's researches yield analogous results, though in a different\r\nfield. He has examined a great quantity of diabetic urine after three\r\ndifferent methods, namely, Trommer's (alkaline solution of copper); by\r\nfermentation; and with the polarization apparatus. In many cases the\r\nresults agreed, while in others there was a considerable difference.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in isolating a substance corresponding in its chemical\r\ncomposition to grape sugar, and also a carbo-hydrate differing considerably\r\nfrom grape sugar, and turning the plane of polarization to the left. The\r\npower of reduction of this newly discovered substance is to that of grape\r\nsugar as 1:2.48. Dr. Leo found this substance in three specimens of\r\ndiabetic urine, but it was absent in normal urine, although a great amount\r\nwas examined for that purpose. From this it may be concluded that the\r\nsubstance does not originate outside the organism, and that it is a\r\npathological product. The theory of Dr. Jaques Meyer, of Carlsbad, that it\r\nmay be connected with obesity, is negatived by the fact that of the three\r\npersons in whom this substance was found, only one was corpulent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNACE FOR DECOMPOSING CHLORIDE OF MAGNESIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe problem of decomposing chloride of magnesium is one which has attracted\r\nthe attention of technical chemists for many years. The solution of this\r\nproblem would be of great importance to the alkali trade, and,\r\nconsequently, to nearly every industry. The late Mr. Weldon made many\r\nexperiments on this subject, but without any particular success. Of late a\r\nfurnace has been patented in Germany, by A. Vogt, which is worked on a\r\nprinciple similar to that applied to salt cake furnaces; but with this\r\ndifference, that in place of the pot it has a revolving drum, and instead\r\nof the roaster a furnace with a number of shelves. The heating gases are\r\nfurnished by a producer, and pass from below upward over the shelves, S,\r\nthen through the channel, C, into the drum, D, which contains the\r\nconcentrated chloride of magnesium. When the latter has solidified, but\r\nbefore being to any extent decomposed, it is removed from the drum and\r\nplaced on the top shelf of the furnace. It is then gradually removed one\r\nshelf lower as the decomposition increases, until it arrives at the bottom\r\nshelf, where it is completely decomposed in the state of magnesia, which is\r\nemptied through, E. The drum, D, after being emptied, is again filled with\r\nconcentrated solution of chloride of magnesium. The hydrochloric acid\r\nleaves through F and G. If, instead of hydrochloric acid, chlorine is to be\r\nevolved, it is necessary to heat the furnace by means of hot air, as\r\notherwise the carbonic acid in the gases from the generator would prevent\r\nthe formation of bleaching powder. The air is heated in two regenerating\r\nchambers, which are placed below the furnace.--_Industries_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FILTRATION AND THE SECRETION THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Physiological Society, Dr. J. Munk reported on\r\nexperiments instituted by him in the course of the last two years with a\r\nview of arriving at an experimental decision between the two theories of\r\nthe secretion of urine--the filtration theory of Ludwig and the secretion\r\ntheory of Heidenhain. According to the first theory, the blood pressure\r\nprescribed the measure for the urine secretion; according to the second\r\ntheory, the urine got secreted from the secretory epithelial cells of the\r\nkidneys, and the quantity of the matter secreted was dependent on the rate\r\nof movement of the circulation of the blood. The speaker had instituted his\r\nexperiments on excided but living kidneys, through which he conducted\r\ndefibrinized blood of the same animals, under pressures which he was able\r\nto vary at pleasure between 80 mm. and 190 mm. Fifty experiments on dogs\r\nwhose blood and kidneys were, during the experiment, kept at 40° C.,\r\nyielded the result that the blood of starving animals induced no secretion\r\nof urine, which on the other hand showed itself in copious quantities where\r\nnormal blood was conducted through the kidney. If to the famished blood was\r\nadded one of the substances contained as ultimate products of digestion in\r\nthe blood, such, for example, as urea, then did the secretion ensue.\r\n\r\nThe fluid dropping from the ureter contained more urea than did the blood.\r\nThat fluid was therefore no filtrate, but a secretion. An enhancement of\r\nthe pressure of the blood flowing through the kidney had no influence on\r\nthe quantity of the secretion passing away. An increased rate of movement\r\non the part of the blood, on the other hand, increased in equal degree the\r\nquantity of urine. On a solution of common salt or of mere serum sanguinis\r\nbeing poured through the kidney, no secretion followed. All these facts,\r\ninvolving the exclusion of the possibility of a central influence being\r\nexercised from, the heart or from the nervous system on the kidneys, were\r\ndeemed by the speaker arguments proving that the urine was secreted by the\r\nrenal epithelial cells. A series of diuretics was next tried, in order to\r\nestablish whether they operated in the way of stimulus centrally on the\r\nheart or peripherally on the renal cells. Digitalis was a central diuretic.\r\nCommon salt, on the other hand, was a peripheral diuretic. Added in the\r\nportion of 2 per cent. to the blood, it increased the quantity of urine\r\neight to fifteen fold. Even in much less doses, it was a powerful diuretic.\r\nIn a similar manner, if yet not so intensely, operated saltpeter and\r\ncoffeine, as also urea and pilocarpine. On the introduction, however, of\r\nthe last substance into the blood, the rate of circulation was accelerated\r\nin an equal measure as was the quantity of urine increased, so that in this\r\ncase the increase in the quantity of urine was, perhaps, exclusively\r\nconditioned by the greater speed in the movement of the blood. On the other\r\nhand, the quantity of secreted urine was reduced when morphine or strychine\r\nwas administered to the blood. In the case of the application of\r\nstrychnine, the rate in the current of the blood was retarded in a\r\nproportion equal to the reduction in the secretion of the urine.\r\n\r\nThe speaker had, finally, demonstrated the synthesis of hippuric acid and\r\nsulphate of phenol in the excided kidney as a function of its cells, by\r\nadding to the blood pouring through the kidney, in the first place, benzoic\r\nacid and glycol; in the second place, phenol and sulphate of soda. In order\r\nthat these syntheses might make their appearance in the excided kidney, the\r\npresence of the blood corpuscles was not necessary, though, indeed, the\r\npresence of oxygen in the blood was indispensable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARYING CYLINDRICAL LENS.\r\n\r\nBy TEMPEST ANDERSON, M.D., B. Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author has had constructed a cylindrical lens in which the axis remains\r\nconstant in direction and amount of refraction, while the refraction in the\r\nmeridian at right angles to this varies continuously.\r\n\r\nA cone may be regarded as a succession of cylinders of different diameters\r\ngraduating into one another by exceedingly small steps, so that if a short\r\nenough portion be considered, its curvature at any point may be regarded as\r\ncylindrical. A lens with one side plane and the other ground on a conical\r\ntool is therefore a concave cylindrical lens varying in concavity at\r\ndifferent parts according to the diameter of the cone at the corresponding\r\npart. Two such lenses mounted with axes parallel and with curvatures\r\nvarying in opposite directions produce a compound cylindrical lens, whose\r\nrefraction in the direction of the axes is zero, and whose refraction in\r\nthe meridian at right angles to this is at any point the sum of the\r\nrefractions of the two lenses. This sum is nearly constant for a\r\nconsiderable distance along the axis so long as the same position of the\r\nlenses is maintained. If the lenses be slid one over the other in the\r\ndirection of their axes, this sum changes, and we have a varying\r\ncylindrical lens. The lens is graduated by marking on the frame the\r\nrelative position of the lenses when cylindrical lenses of known power are\r\nneutralized.\r\n\r\nLenses were exhibited to the Royal Society, London, varying from to -6 DCy,\r\nand from to +6 DCy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF THE ABSORPTION OF LIGHT IN CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\nBy H. BECQUEREL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The absorption spectrum observed through a crystal varies with the\r\ndirection of the rectilinear luminous vibration which propagates itself in\r\nthis crystal. 2. The bands or rays observed through the same crystal have,\r\nin the spectrum, fixed positions, their intensity alone varying. 3. For a\r\ngiven band or ray there exist in the crystal three rectangular directions\r\nof symmetry, according to one of which the band generally disappears, so\r\nthat for a suitable direction of the luminous vibrations the crystal no\r\nlonger absorbs the radiations corresponding to the region of the spectrum\r\nwhere the band question appeared. These three directions may be called the\r\nprincipal directions of absorption, relative to this band. 4. In the\r\northorhombic crystals, by a necessary consequence of crystalline symmetry,\r\nthe principal directions of absorption of all the bands coincide with the\r\nthree axes of symmetry. We may thus observe three principal absorption\r\nspectra. In uniaxial crystals the number of absorption spectra is reduced\r\nto two. 5. In clinorhombic crystals one of the principal directions of\r\nabsorption of each crystal coincides with the only axis of symmetry; the\r\ntwo other principal rectangular directions of each band may be found\r\nvariously disposed in the plane normal to this axis. Most commonly these\r\nprincipal directions are very near to the principal corresponding\r\ndirections of optical elasticity. 6. In various crystals the characters of\r\nthe absorption phenomena differ strikingly from those which we might expect\r\nto find after an examination of the optical properties of the crystal. We\r\nhave just seen that in clinorhombic crystals the principal absorption\r\ndirections of certain bands were completely different from the axis of\r\noptical elasticity of the crystal for the corresponding radiations. If we\r\nexamine this anomaly, we perceive that the crystals manifesting these\r\neffects are complex bodies, formed of various matters, one, or sometimes\r\nseveral, of which absorb light and give each different absorption bands.\r\nNow, M. De Senarmont has shown that the geometric isomorphism of certain\r\nsubstances does not necessarily involve identity of optical properties, and\r\nin particular in the directions of the axes of optical elasticity in\r\nrelation to the geometric directions of the crystal. In a crystal\r\ncontaining a mixture of isomorphous substances, each substance brings its\r\nown influence, which may be made to predominate in turn according to the\r\nproportions of the mixture. We may, therefore, admit that the molecules of\r\neach substance enter into the crystal retaining all the optical properties\r\nwhich they would have if each crystallized separately. The principal\r\ndirections of optical elasticity are given by the resultant of the actions\r\nwhich each of the component substances exerts on the propagation of light,\r\nwhile the absorption of a given region of the spectrum is due to a single\r\none of these substances, and may have for its directions of symmetry the\r\ndirections which it would have in the absorbing molecule supposing it\r\nisolated. It may happen that these directions do not coincide with the axes\r\nof optical elasticity of the compound crystal. If such is the cause of the\r\nanomaly of certain principal directions of absorption, the bands which\r\npresent these anomalies must belong to substances different from those\r\nwhich yield bands having other principal directions of absorption. If so,\r\nwe are in possession of a novel method of spectral analysis, which permits\r\nus to distinguish in certain crystals bands belonging to different matters,\r\nisomorphous, but not having the same optical properties. Two bands\r\nappearing in a crystal with common characters, but presenting in another\r\ncrystal characters essentially different, must also be ascribed to two\r\ndifferent bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 585, page 9345.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE WORLD'S POSTAL SERVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed in Europe that the mail is chiefly forwarded by the\r\nrailroads; but this is only partially the case, as the largest portion of\r\nthe mails is intrusted now, as formerly, to foot messengers. How long this\r\nwill last is of course uncertain, as the present postal service seems\r\nsuitable enough for the needs of the people. The first task of the mail is\r\nnaturally the collection of letters. Fig. 17 represents a letter box in a\r\nlevel country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--COUNTRY LETTER BOX.]\r\n\r\nBy way of example, it is not uninteresting to know that the inhabitants of\r\nHanover in Germany made great opposition to the introduction of letter\r\nboxes, for the moral reason that they could be used to carry on forbidden\r\ncorrespondence, and that consequently all letters should be delivered\r\npersonally to the post master.\r\n\r\nAfter the letters are collected, the sorting for the place of destination\r\nfollows, and Fig. 18 represents the sorting room in the Berlin Post Office.\r\nA feverish sort of life is led here day and night, as deficient addresses\r\nmust be completed, and the illegible ones deciphered.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that the delivery of letters to each floor of\r\napartment houses is limited chiefly to Austria and Germany. In France and\r\nEngland, the letters are delivered to the janitor or else thrown into the\r\nletter box placed in the hall.\r\n\r\nAfter the letters are arranged, then comes the transportation of them by\r\nmeans of the railroad, the chaise, or gig, and finally the dog mail, as\r\nseen in Fig. 19. It is hard to believe that this primitive vehicle is\r\nuseful for sending mail that is especially urgent, and yet it is used in\r\nthe northern part of Canada. Drawn by three or four dogs, it glides swiftly\r\nover the snow.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a large jump from free America, the home of the most unlimited\r\nprogress, into the Flowery Kingdom, where cues are worn, but we hope our\r\nreaders are willing to accompany us, in order to have the pleasure of\r\nseeing how rapidly a Chinese mail carrier (Fig. 20) trots along his route\r\nunder his sun umbrella.\r\n\r\nOnly the largest and most robust pedestrians are chosen for service, and\r\nthey are obliged to pass through a severe course of training before they\r\ncan lay any claim to the dignified name, \"Thousand Mile Horse.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--SORTING ROOM IN BERLIN POST OFFICE.]\r\n\r\nBut even the Chinese carrier may not strike us so curiously as another\r\nassociate, given in our next picture, Fig. 21, and yet he is a European\r\nemploye from the Landes department of highly cultivated France. The\r\ninhabitants of this country buckle stilts on to their feet, so as to make\r\ntheir way faster through brambles and underbrush which surrounds them. The\r\nmail carrier copied them in his equipment, and thus he goes around on\r\nstilts, provided with a large cane to help him keep his balance, and\r\nfurnishes a correct example of a post office official suiting the demands\r\nof every district.\r\n\r\nWhile the mail in Europe has but little to do with the transportation of\r\npassengers, it is important in its activity in this respect in the large\r\nRussian empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--DOG POST AT LAKE SUPERIOR.]\r\n\r\nThe tarantass (Fig. 22), drawn by three nimble horses, flies through the\r\nendless deserts with wind-like rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe next illustration (Fig. 23) leads us to a much more remote and deserted\r\ncountry, \"Post office on the Booby Island,\" occupied only by birds, and a\r\nhut containing a box in which are pens, paper, ink, and wafers. The\r\nmariners put their letters in the box, and look in to see if there is\r\nanything there addressed to them, then they continue their journey.\r\n\r\nPostage stamps are not demanded in this ideal post office, but provision is\r\nmade for the shipwrecked, by a notice informing them where they can find\r\nmeans of nourishment.\r\n\r\nOnce again we make a leap. The Bosnian mail carrier's equipment (Fig. 24)\r\nis, or rather was, quite singular, for our picture was taken before the\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThis mounted mail carrier with his weapons gives one the impression of a\r\nrobber.\r\n\r\nThe task of conducting the mail through the Alps of Switzerland (Fig. 25)\r\nmust be uncomfortable in winter, when the sledges glide by fearful\r\nprecipices and over snow-covered passes.\r\n\r\nSince the tariff union mail developed from the Prussian mail, and the\r\nworld's mail from the tariff union, it seems suitable to close our series\r\nof pictures by representing the old Prussian postal service (Fig. 26)\r\ncarried on by soldier postmen in the eighteenth century during the reign of\r\nFrederick the Great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--CHINESE POSTMAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--DELIVERING LETTERS IN LANDES DEPARTMENT,\r\nFRANCE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--RUSSIAN EXTRA POST.]\r\n\r\nThe complaint is made that poetry is wanting in our era, and it has\r\ncertainly disappeared from the postal service. One remembers that the\r\npostilion was for quite a while the favorite hero of our poets, the best of\r\nwhom have sung to his praises, and given space to his melancholy thoughts\r\nof modern times in which he is pushed aside. It is too true that the post\r\nhorn, formerly blown by a postilion, is now silenced, that the horse has\r\nnot been able to keep up in the race with the world in its use of the\r\nsteam horse, and yet how much poetry there is in that little post office\r\nall alone by itself on the Booby Island, that we have described--the\r\nsublimest poetry, that of love for mankind!\r\n\r\nThe poet of the modern postal system has not yet appeared; but he will find\r\nplenty of material. He will be able to depict the dangers a postman passes\r\nthrough in discharging his duty on the field, he will sing the praises of\r\nthose who are injured in a railroad disaster, and yet continue their good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--POST OFFICE ON BOOBY ISLAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--BOSNIAN POST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--SWISS ALPINE POST IN WINTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--SOLDIER POSTMAN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nHe can also praise the noble thought of uniting the nations, which assumed\r\nits first tangible form in the world's mail. It will not be a sentimental\r\nsong, but one full of power and indicative of our own time, in spite of\r\nthose who scorn it.--_Translated for the Scientific American Supplement by\r\nJenny H.

BRUCE WARREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compound used principally for the electro-deposition of nickel is a\r\ndouble sulphate of nickel and ammonia. The silvery appearance of the\r\ndeposit depends mainly on the purity of the salt as well as the anodes. The\r\ncondition of the bath, as to age, temperature, and degree of saturation,\r\nposition of anodes, strength of current, and other details of manipulation,\r\nwhich require care, cleanliness, and experience, such as may be met with in\r\nany intelligent workman fairly acquainted with his business, are easily\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nIn the present paper I shall deal principally with the chemical department\r\nof this subject, and shall briefly introduce, where necessary, allusion to\r\nthe mechanical and electrical details connected with the process. At a\r\nfuture time I shall be glad to enlarge upon this part of the subject, with\r\na view of making the article complete.\r\n\r\nA short time ago nickel plating was nearly as expensive as silver plating.\r\nThis is explained by the fact that only a few people, at least in this\r\ncountry, were expert in the mechanical portions of the process, and only a\r\nvery few chemists gave attention to the matter. To this must be added that\r\nour text-books were fearfully deficient in information bearing on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe salt used, and also the anodes, were originally introduced into this\r\ncountry from America, and latterly from Germany. I am not aware of any\r\nEnglish manufacturer who makes a specialty in the way of anodes. This is a\r\nmatter on which we can hardly congratulate ourselves, as a well known\r\nLondon firm some time ago supplied me with my first experimental anodes,\r\nwhich were in every way very superior to the German or American\r\nproductions. Although the price paid per pound was greater, the plates\r\nthemselves were cheaper on account of their lesser thickness.\r\n\r\nThe texture of the inner portions of these foreign anodes would lead one to\r\ninfer that the metallurgy of nickel was very primitive. A good homogeneous\r\nplate can be produced, still the spongy, rotten plates of foreign\r\nmanufacture were allowed the free run of our markets. The German plates\r\nare, in my opinion, more compact than the American. A serious fault with\r\nplates of earlier manufacture was their crumpled condition after a little\r\nuse. This involved a difficulty in cleaning them when necessary. The\r\nEnglish plates were not open to this objection; in fact, when the outer\r\nsurfaces were planed away, they remained perfectly smooth and compact.\r\n\r\nLarge plates have been known to disintegrate and fall to pieces after being\r\nused for some time. A large anode surface, compared with that of the\r\narticle to be plated, is of paramount importance. The tank should be\r\nsufficiently wide to take the largest article for plating, and to admit of\r\nthe anodes being moved nearer to or further from the article. In this way\r\nthe necessary electrical resistance can very conveniently be inserted\r\nbetween the anode and cathode surfaces. The elimination of hydrogen from\r\nthe cathode must be avoided, or at any rate must not accumulate. Moving the\r\narticle being plated, while in the bath, taking care not to break the\r\nelectrical contacts, is a good security against a streaky or foggy\r\nappearance in the deposit.\r\n\r\nAt one time a mechanical arrangement was made, by which the cathodes were\r\nkept in motion. The addition of a little borax to the bath is a great\r\nadvantage in mitigating the appearance of gas. Its behavior is electrical\r\nrather than chemical. If the anode surface is too great, a few plates\r\nshould be transferred to the cathode bars.\r\n\r\nWhen an article has been nickel plated, it generally presents a dull\r\nappearance, resembling frosted silver. To get over this I tried, some time\r\nago, the use of bisulphide of carbon in the same way as used for obtaining\r\na bright silver deposit. Curiously the deposit was very dark, almost black,\r\nwhich could not be buffed or polished bright. But by using a very small\r\nquantity of the bisulphide mixture, the plated surfaces were so bright that\r\nthe use of polishing mops or buffs could be almost dispensed with. When we\r\nconsider the amount of labor required in polishing a nickel plated article,\r\nand the impossibility of finishing off bright an undercut surface, this\r\nbecomes an important addendum to the nickel plater's list of odds and ends.\r\n\r\nThis mixture is made precisely in the same way as for bright silvering, but\r\na great deal less is to be added to the bath, about one pint per 100\r\ngallons. It should be well stirred in, after the day's work is done, when\r\nthe bath will be in proper condition for working next day. The mixture is\r\nmade by shaking together, in a glass bottle, one ounce bisulphide and one\r\ngallon of the plating liquid, allow to stand until excess of bisulphide has\r\nsettled, and decant the clear liquid for use as required. It is better to\r\nadd this by degrees than to run the risk of overdoing. If too much is\r\nadded, the bath is not of necessity spoiled, but it takes a great deal of\r\nworking to bring it in order again.\r\n\r\nAbout eight ounces of the double sulphate to each gallon of distilled or\r\nrain water is a good proportion to use when making up a bath. There is a\r\nslight excess with this. It is a mistake to add the salt afterward, when\r\nthe bath is in good condition. The chloride and cyanide are said to give\r\ngood results. I can only say that the use of either of these salts has not\r\nled to promising results in my hands.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the double sulphate, English grain nickel is decidedly the\r\nbest form of metal to use. In practice, old anodes are generally used.\r\n\r\nThe metal is dissolved in a mixture of nitric and dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nwith the application of a gentle heat. When sufficient metal has been\r\ndissolved, and the unused nitric acid expelled, the salt may be\r\nprecipitated by a strong solution sulphate of ammonia, or, if much free\r\nacid is present, carbonate of ammonia is better to use.\r\n\r\nTin, lead, and portion of the iron, if present, are removed by this method.\r\nThe silica, carbon, and portions of copper are left behind with the\r\nundissolved fragments of metals.\r\n\r\nThe precipitated salt, after slight washing, is dissolved in water and\r\nstrong solution ammonia added. A clean iron plate is immersed in the\r\nsolution to remove any trace of copper. This plate must be cleaned\r\noccasionally so as to remove any reduced copper, which will impede its\r\naction. As soon as the liquid is free from copper, it is left alkaline and\r\nwell stirred so as to facilitate peroxidation and removal of iron, which\r\nforms a film on the bath. When this ceases, the liquid is rendered neutral\r\nby addition of sulphuric acid, and filtered or decanted. The solution, when\r\nproperly diluted, has sp. gr. about 1.06 at 60° F. It is best to work the\r\nbath with a weak current for a short time until the liquid yields a fine\r\nwhite deposit. Too strong a current must be avoided.\r\n\r\nIf the copper has not been removed, it will deposit on the anodes when the\r\nbath is at rest. It should then be removed by scouring.\r\n\r\nCopper produces a reddish tinge, which is by no means unpleasant compared\r\nwith the dazzling whiteness of the nickel deposit. If this is desired, it\r\nis far better to use a separate bath, using anodes of suitable composition.\r\n\r\nThe want of adhesion between the deposited coating and the article need not\r\nbe feared if cleanliness be attended to and the article, while in the bath,\r\nbe not touched by the hands.\r\n\r\nThe bath should be neutral, or nearly so, slightly acid rather than\r\nalkaline. It is obvious that, as such a liquid has no detergent action on a\r\nsoiled surface, scrupulous care must be taken in scouring and rinsing.\r\nBoiling alkaline solutions and a free use of powdered pumice and the\r\nscrubbing brush must on no account be neglected.\r\n\r\nA few words on the construction of the tanks. A stout wood box, which need\r\nnot be water-tight, is lined with sheet lead, the joints being blown, _not\r\nsoldered_. An inner casing of wood which projects a few inches above the\r\nlead lining is necessary in order to avoid any chance of \"short circuiting\"\r\nor damage to the lead from the accidental falling of anodes or any article\r\nwhich might cut the lead. It is by no means a necessity that the lining\r\nshould be such as to prevent the liquid getting to the lead.\r\n\r\nOn a future occasion I hope to supplement this paper with the analysis of\r\nthe double sulphates used, and an account of the behavior of\r\nelectrolytically prepared crucibles and dishes as compared with those now\r\nin the market.--_Chem. News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILLED CAST IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the engineering section of the Bristol Naturalists'\r\nSociety a paper on \"Chilled Iron\" was read by Mr. Morgans, of which we give\r\nan abstract. Among the descriptions of chilled castings in common use the\r\nauthor instanced the following: Sheet, corn milling, and sugar rolls; tilt\r\nhammer anvils and bits, plowshares, \"brasses\" and bushes, cart-wheel boxes,\r\nserrated cones and cups for grinding mills, railway and tramway wheels and\r\ncrossings, artillery shot and bolts, stone-breaker jaws, circular cutters,\r\netc. Mr. Morgans then spoke of the high reputation of sheet mill rolls and\r\nwheel axle boxes made in Bristol. Of the latter in combination with wrought\r\niron wheels and steeled axles, the local wagon works company are exporting\r\nlarge numbers. With respect to the strength and fatigue resistance of\r\nchilled castings, details were given of some impact tests made in July,\r\n1864, at Pontypool, in the presence of Captain Palliser, upon some of his\r\nchilled bolts, 12¾ in. long by 4 in. diameter, made from Pontypool\r\ncold-blast pig iron. Those made from No. 1 pig iron--the most graphitic and\r\ncostly--broke more easily than those from No. 2, and so on until those made\r\nfrom No. 4 were tested, when the maximum strength was reached. No. 4 pig\r\niron was in fracture a pale gray, bordering on mottled. Several points\r\nregarding foundry operations in the production of chilled castings were\r\nraised for discussion. They embraced the depth of chill to be imparted to\r\nchilled rolls and railway wheels, and in the case of traction wheels, the\r\nwidth of chill in the tread; preparation of the chills--by coating with\r\nvarious carbonaceous matters, lime, beer grounds, or, occasionally, some\r\nmysterious compost--and moulds, selection and mixture of pig irons, methods\r\nand plant for melting, suitable heat for pouring, prevention of\r\nhoneycombing, ferrostatic pressure of head, etc. Melting for rolls being\r\nmostly conducted in reverberatories, the variations in the condition of the\r\nfurnace atmosphere, altering from reducing to oxidizing, and _vice versa_,\r\nin cases of bad stoking and different fuels, were referred to as\r\noccasionally affecting results. Siemens' method of melting by radiant heat\r\nwas mentioned for discussion. For promoting the success of a chilled roll\r\nin its work, lathing or turning it to perfect circularity in the necks\r\nfirst, and then turning the body while the necks bear in steady brasses,\r\nare matters of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nThe author next referred to the great excellence for chilling purposes\r\npossessed by some American pig irons, and to the fact that iron of a given\r\ncarbon content derived from some ores and fluxes differed much in chilling\r\nproperties from iron holding a similar proportion of carbon--free and\r\ncombined--derived from other ores and materials. Those irons are best which\r\ndevelop the hardest possible chill most uniformly to the desired depth\r\nwithout producing a too abrupt line of division between the hard white skin\r\nand the softer gray body. A medium shading off both ways is wanted here, as\r\nin all things. The impossibility of securing a uniform quality and chemical\r\ncomposition in any number grade of any brand of pig iron over a lengthened\r\nperiod was adverted to. Consequent from this a too resolute faith in any\r\nparticular make of pig iron is likely to be at times ill-requited.\r\nOccasional physical tests, accompanied with chemical analysis of irons used\r\nfor chilling, were advocated; and the author was of opinion it would be\r\nwell whenever a chilled casting had enjoyed a good reputation for standing\r\nup to its work, that when it was retired from work some portions of it\r\nshould be chemically analyzed so as to obtain clews to compositions of\r\nexcellence. Some of the physical characteristics of chilled iron, as well\r\nas the surprising locomotive properties of carbon present in heated iron,\r\nwere noticed.\r\n\r\nAttention was called to some German data, published by Dr. Percy in 1864,\r\nconcerning an iron which before melting weighed--approximately--448¼ lb.\r\nper cubic foot, and contained--approximately--4 per cent. of carbon--3¼\r\nbeing graphitic and ¾ combined. The chilled portion of a casting from this\r\nhad a specific gravity equivalent to 471 lb. per cubic foot, and contained\r\n5 per cent. of carbon, all combined. The soft portion of the same casting\r\nweighed 447¾ lb. per cubic foot, and contained 34.5 per cent. of\r\ncarbon--31.5 being graphitic and 3.5 combined. Mr. Morgans doubted whether\r\nso great an increase in density often arises from chilling. Tool steel,\r\nwhen hardened by being chilled in cold water, does not become condensed,\r\nbut slightly expanded from its bulk when annealed and soft. Here an\r\nincrease of hardness is accompanied by a decrease of density. The gradual\r\ndevelopment of a network of cracks over the face of a chilled anvil orbit\r\nwhile being used in tilt hammers was mentioned. Such minute cleavages\r\nbecame more marked as the chill is worn down by work and from grinding.\r\nTraces of the same occurrence are observable over the surface of much worn\r\nchilled rolls used in sheet mills. In such cases the sheets get a faint\r\ndiaper pattern impressed upon them. The opening of crack spaces points to\r\nlateral shrinkage of the portions of chilled material they surround, and to\r\nsome release from a state of involuntary tension. If this action is\r\naccompanied by some actual densification of the fissured chill, then we\r\nhave a result that possibly conflicts with the example of condensation from\r\nchilling cited by Dr. Percy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent dedication of Snow Hall, at Lawrence, Kansas, is an event in the\r\nhistory of the State, both historic and prophetic. Since the incorporation\r\nof the University of Kansas, and before that event, there has been a steady\r\ngrowth of science in the State, which has culminated in Snow Hall, a\r\nbuilding set apart for the increase and diffusion of the knowledge of\r\nnatural science, as long as its massive walls shall stand. It is named in\r\nhonor of the man who has been the inspiration and guiding spirit of the\r\nwhole enterprise, and some incidents in his life may be of interest to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago Professor Frank H. Snow, a recent graduate of Williams\r\nCollege, came to Kansas, to become a member of the faculty of the State\r\nUniversity. His election to the chair of natural science was unexpected, as\r\nhe first taught mathematics in the university, and expected in due time to\r\nbecome professor of Greek. As professor of the mellifluous and most plastic\r\nof all the ancient tongues, he would undoubtedly have been proficient, as\r\nhis college classics still remain fresh in his warm and retentive memory,\r\nand his literary taste is so severe and chaste as to make some of his\r\nscientific papers read like a psalm. But nature designed him for another,\r\nand some think a better, field, and endowed him with powers as a naturalist\r\nthat have won for him recognition among the highest living authorities of\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\nUpon being elected to the chair of natural history, Prof. Snow entered upon\r\nhis life work with an enthusiasm that charmed his associates and inspired\r\nhis pupils. The true naturalist must possess large and accurate powers of\r\nobservation and a love for his chosen profession that carries him over all\r\nobstacles and renders him oblivious to everything else except the specimen\r\nupon which he has set his heart. Years ago the writer was walking in the\r\nhall of the new university building in company with General Fraser and\r\nProfessor Snow, when the latter suddenly darted forward up the stairs and\r\ncaptured an insect in its flight, that had evidently just dug its way out\r\nof the pine of the new building. In a few moments he returned with such a\r\nglow on his countenance and such a satisfied air at having captured a rare\r\nbut familiar specimen, whose name was on his lips, that we both felt\r\n\"Surely here is a genuine naturalist.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago an incident occurred in connection with his scientific\r\nexcursions in Colorado that is quite characteristic, showing his\r\nobliviousness to self and everything else save the object of his scientific\r\npursuit, and a fertility in overcoming danger when it meets him face to\r\nface. He was descending alone from one of the highest peaks of the Rockies,\r\nwhen he thought he could leave the path and reach the foot of the mountain\r\nby passing directly down its side over an immense glacier of snow and ice,\r\nand thus save time and a journey of several miles. After a while his way\r\ndown the glacier grew steeper and more difficult, until he reached a point\r\nwhere he could not advance any further, and found, to his consternation,\r\nthat he could not return by the way he had come. There he clung to the side\r\nof the immense glacier, ready, should he miss his hold, to be plunged\r\nhundreds of feet into a deep chasm. The situation flashed over him, and he\r\nknew now it was, indeed, a struggle for dear life. With a precarious\r\nfoothold, he clung to the glacier with one hand, while with his pocket\r\nknife he cut a safer foothold with the other. Resting a little, he cut\r\nanother foothold lower down in the hard snow, and so worked his way after a\r\nsevere struggle of several hours amid constant danger to the foot of the\r\nmountain in safety. \"But,\" continued the professor, speaking of this\r\nincident to some of his friends, \"I was richly repaid for all my trouble\r\nand peril, for when I reached the foot of the mountain I captured a new and\r\nvery rare species of butterfly.\" Multitudes of practical men cannot\r\nappreciate such devotion to pure science, but it is this absorbing passion\r\nand pure grit that enable the devotees of science to enlarge its boundaries\r\nyear by year.\r\n\r\nOnce, while on a scientific excursion on the great plains, with the\r\nlamented Prof. Mudge, he nearly lost his life. He had captured a\r\nrattlesnake, and, in trying to introduce it into a jar filled with alcohol,\r\nthe snake managed to bite him on the hand. The arm was immediately bound\r\ntightly with a handkerchief, and the wound enlarged with a pocket knife,\r\nand both professors took turns in sucking it as clean as possible, and\r\nejecting the poison from their mouths. This and a heavy dose of spirits\r\nbrought the professor through in safety, although the poison remaining in\r\nthe wound caused considerable swelling and pain in the hand and arm. When\r\nthis incident was mentioned in the Kansas Academy of Science that year,\r\nsome one said, \"Now we know the effect of the bite of the prairie\r\nrattlesnake on the human system. Let some one, in the interests of pure\r\nscience, try the effect of the timber rattlesnake on the human system.\" But\r\nlike the mice in the fable, no one was found who cared to put the bell on\r\nthe cat.\r\n\r\nProfessors Mudge and Snow, because scientists were so few in the State at\r\nthat early day, divided the field of natural science between themselves,\r\nthe former taking geology and the latter living forms. Professor Mudge\r\nbuilt up at the agricultural college a royal cabinet, easily worth $10,000,\r\nand Professor Snow has made a collection at the State University whose\r\nvalue cannot be readily estimated until it is catalogued and placed in\r\ncases in Snow Hall.\r\n\r\nAs a scientist, Professor Snow is an indefatigable worker, conscientious\r\nand painstaking to the last degree, never neglecting anything that can be\r\ndiscovered by the microscope, and when he describes and names a new\r\nspecies, he gives the absolute facts, without regard to theories or\r\nphilosophies. For accuracy his descriptions of animal and vegetable life\r\nresemble photographs, and are received by scientists with unquestioned\r\nauthority. He possesses another quality, which may be called honesty. Some\r\nscientists, whose reputation has reached other continents, cannot be\r\ntrusted alone in the cabinet with the keys, for they are liable to borrow\r\nvaluable specimens, and forget afterward to return them.\r\n\r\nIt is possible only to glance at the immense amount of work performed by\r\nProfessor Snow during the last twenty years. Neglecting the small fry that\r\ncan only be taken in nets with very fine meshes, he ascertained that there\r\nare twenty-seven species of fish in the Kansas River at Lawrence. Work on\r\nthis paper occupied the leisure time of two summers, as much time in such\r\ninvestigations only produces negative results. For several years he worked\r\non a catalogue of the birds of Kansas, inspiring several persons in\r\ndifferent parts of the State to assist him. Later this work was turned over\r\nto Colonel N.S. Gross, of Topeka, an enthusiast in ornithology. Colonel\r\nGoss has a very fine collection of mounted birds in the capitol building at\r\nTopeka, and he has recently published a catalogue of the \"Birds of Kansas,\"\r\nwhich contains 335 species. Professor Snow has worked faithfully on the\r\nplants of Kansas, but as other botanists came into the State, he turned the\r\nwork over to their hands. For several years he has given a large share of\r\nhis time and strength to entomology. Nearly every year he has led\r\nscientific excursions to different points in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona,\r\netc., where he might reap the best results.\r\n\r\nOnce, during a meeting of the Kansas Academy of Science, at Lawrence,\r\nProfessor Snow was advertised to read a paper on some rare species of\r\nbutterflies. As the hour approached, the hall in the university building\r\nwas thronged, principally by ladies from the city, when Professor Snow\r\nbrought out piles of his trays of butterflies, and without a note gave such\r\nan exhibit and description of his specimens as charmed the whole audience.\r\n\r\nIn meteorology, Professor Snow is an acknowledged authority, wherever this\r\nscience is studied, and he has, probably, all things considered, the best\r\nmeteorological record in the State.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Professor Snow possesses qualities that are worth more,\r\nperhaps, to his pupils, in forming character, than the knowledge derived\r\nfrom him as an instructor. His life is pure and ennobling, his presence\r\ninspiring, and many young men have gone from his lecture room to hold good\r\npositions in the scientific world. When one sees him in his own home,\r\nsurrounded by his family, with books and specimens and instruments all\r\naround, he feels that the ideal home has not lost everything in the fall.\r\n\r\nSnow Hall is the natural resultant of twenty years of earnest and faithful\r\nlabor on the part of this eminent scientist. The regents displayed the rare\r\ngood sense of committing everything regarding the plans of the building,\r\nand the form and arrangement of the cases, to Professor Snow, which has\r\nresulted in giving to Kansas the model building of its kind in the West, if\r\nnot in this country. Very large collections have accumulated at the State\r\nUniversity, under the labors of Professor Snow and his assistants, which\r\nneed to be classified, arranged, and labeled; and when the legislature\r\nappropriates the money to furnish cases to display this collection in\r\nalmost every department of natural science, Kansas will possess a hall of\r\nnatural science whose influence will be felt throughout the State, and be\r\nan attraction to scientists everywhere.--_Chaplain J.D. Parker, in Kansas\r\nCity Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIMINATION OF POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of the means by which nature rids the economy of what is harmful\r\nhas been made by Sanquirico, of Siena, and his experiments and conclusions\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nHe finds that the vessels of the body, without undergoing extensive\r\nstructural alteration, can by exosmosis rid themselves of fluid to an\r\namount of eight per cent. of the body weight of the subject of the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThrough the injection of neutral fluids a great increase in the vascular\r\ntension is effected, which is relieved by elimination through the kidneys.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this fact, the author, in 1885, made experiments with\r\nalcohol and strychnine, and continued his researches in the use of chloral\r\nand aconitine with results favorable to the method employed, which is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe minimal fatal dose of a given poison was selected, and found to be in a\r\ncertain relation to the body weight.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the injection of the poison a solution of sodium chloride,\r\n0.75 per cent. in strength, was injected into the subcutaneous tissues of\r\nthe neck, in quantities being eight per cent. of the body weight of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIn the case of those poisons whose effect is not instantaneous, the\r\ninjection of saline solution was made on the first appearance of toxic\r\nsymptoms. In other poisons the injection was made at once.\r\n\r\nThe result of the use of salines was a diuresis varying in the promptness\r\nof its appearance and in its amount.\r\n\r\nThose animals in which diuresis was limited at first and then increased\r\ngenerally recovered, while those in which diuresis was not established\r\nperished. The poison used was found in the urine of those which died and\r\nalso those which recovered.\r\n\r\nThe author succeeded in rescuing animals poisoned by alcohol, strychnine,\r\nchloral, and aconitine. With morphine, curare, and hypnone, the method of\r\nelimination failed, although ten per cent. in quantity of the body weight\r\nof the animal was used in the saline injection. With aconitine, diuresis\r\nwas not always established, and when it failed the animal died in\r\nconvulsions.--_Centralblatt fur die Medicinischen Wissenschaften, December_\r\n18, 1886.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific papers\r\nheretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTerms of Subscription, $5 a Year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
