L. BANCROFT AND COMPANY,\r\nPRINTERS AND BINDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sketches and poems in this volume were written at a time when the\r\nauthor was engaged in the practice of a laborious profession. It was the\r\nintention of Mr. Rhodes to collect them from the various newspapers and\r\nperiodicals in which they had appeared, and publish them in book-form\r\nwhenever he could obtain a respite from his arduous duties. But before\r\nhe carried out his long-cherished object he died, in the prime of his\r\nmanhood and the ripeness of his literary life. Many of his poems were\r\nwritten for the monthly gatherings of the Bohemian Club. There, when\r\nCaxton's name was announced, his literary friends thronged about him,\r\nconfident of the rich treat the brain of their beloved poet had provided\r\nfor them. His wit was keen and sparkling, without a shade of malice; and\r\nmany an anecdote, that began with some delightful absurdity, closed in a\r\npathos that showed the great versatility of Caxton's genius. The Case of\r\nSummerfield, which is perhaps the most ingenious of the tales in that\r\npeculiar vein, was widely copied and warmly praised for the originality\r\nof its plan and the skill of its execution. The editor of this work has\r\nobserved, as far as lay in his power, the intention of the author in\r\nthe selection of those compositions which Mr. Rhodes had put aside for\r\ncompilation. With such a mass and variety of material (for Caxton had\r\nbeen a busy worker) it was difficult to select from productions all of\r\nwhich were excellent. Few liberties have been taken with them; for,\r\nindeed, Caxton was himself so conscientious in the arrangement and\r\ncorrection of his manuscript, that, with the exception of some slight\r\nand unimportant alterations, this book goes before his friends and the\r\npublic in the same order as the author would have chosen had he been\r\nspared to perform the task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when, according to custom, Mr. Rhodes's death was formally\r\nannounced to the several Courts of Record in San Francisco, one of the\r\nlearned Judges urged the publication of his writings in some form which\r\nwould give the bar a permanent memorial of one of it's most esteemed\r\nmembers, and to them their proper place in American literature. This has\r\nbeen accomplished by the present volume. It is sincerely to be hoped\r\nthat while it will largely add to Mr. Rhodes's reputation, it may also\r\nserve to furnish a most interesting family some substantial aid in the\r\nstruggle with life, from which the beloved husband and tender father has\r\nunhappily been removed.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Rhodes was born July 16, 1822, in Windsor, North Carolina.\r\nHis mother died when he was six years old, and his father, Col. E. A.\r\nRhodes, sent him to Princeton, New Jersey, to be educated at the seat of\r\nlearning established there. Col. Rhodes was subsequently appointed\r\nUnited States Consul at Galveston, Texas, and without completing his\r\ncollege course, the son followed his father to his new home. There he\r\ndiligently pursued his studies. He found many young men like himself,\r\nambitious and zealous in acquiring information, and these he associated\r\nwith himself in literary and debating clubs, where the most important\r\nmatters of natural science and political economy were discussed. The\r\neffect of this self-bestowed education was most marked. It remained with\r\nhim all his life. He was thoroughly versed in the political history of\r\nthe country, and possessed an amount of knowledge concerning the career,\r\nmotives and objects of politics, parties and public men, which, had he\r\never chosen to embark in public life, would have made him distinguished\r\nand successful. No one ever discussed with him the questions connected\r\nwith the theory of our government without a thorough respect for the\r\nsincerity of his convictions, and the ability with which they were\r\nmaintained. He was, in theory, a thorough partisan of the Southern\r\npolitical and constitutional school of ideas, and never abandoned them.\r\nBut he advocated them without passion or apparent prejudice, and at all\r\ntimes shrunk from active connection with politics as a trade. He was an\r\nidealist in law, in science and government, and perhaps his early\r\ntraining, self-imposed and self-contained, had much to do with his\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, he entered Harvard Law School, where he remained for two years.\r\nHere, as at home among his young friends, he was a master-spirit and\r\nleader. He was an especial favorite of his instructors; was noted for\r\nhis studious and exemplary habits, while his genial and courteous\r\nmanners won the lasting friendship of his classmates and companions. His\r\nfondness for weaving the problems of science with fiction, which became\r\nafterwards so marked a characteristic of his literary efforts, attracted\r\nthe especial attention of his professors; and had Mr. Rhodes devoted\r\nhimself to this then novel department of letters, he would have become,\r\nno doubt, greatly distinguished as a writer; and the great master of\r\nscientific fiction, Jules Verne, would have found the field of his\r\nefforts already sown and reaped by the young Southern student. But his\r\nnecessities and parental choice, conspired to keep him at \"the lawless\r\nscience of the law;\" and literature become an incident of life, rather\r\nthan its end and aim. He never really loved the law. He rather lived by\r\nit than in it. He became a good lawyer, but was an unwilling\r\npractitioner. He understood legal principles thoroughly. He loved the\r\nhigher lessons of truth and justice, of right and wrong, _fas et nefas_,\r\nwhich they illustrated; but he bent himself to the necessary details of\r\nprofessional life--to the money-getting part of it--with a peculiar and\r\nconstantly increasing reluctance. The yoke of labor galled him, and\r\nalways more severely. An opportunity to speak and write what was most\r\npleasing to his taste, which set him free as a liberated prisoner of\r\nthought, his untrammeled and wandering imagination extravagantly\r\ninterweaving scientific principles, natural forces, and elemental facts,\r\nin some witch's dance of fancy, where he dissolved in its alchemy,\r\nearth, air and water, and created a world of his own, or destroyed that\r\nbeneath his feet, was of more value to him, though it brought him no\r\ngain, than a stiff cause in courts which bound him to dry details of\r\nweary facts and legal propositions, though every hour of his time\r\nbestowed a golden reward.\r\n\r\nHis early professional life was passed in Galveston. He was measurably\r\nsuccessful in it, and won many friends by his gallant and chivalrous\r\nadvocacy of the causes intrusted to him. His personal popularity\r\nelevated him to a Probate Judgeship in Texas. This office he filled with\r\nhonor; and at the expiration of his term, he returned, after a brief\r\nsojourn in New York, to his native state and town, where he practiced\r\nhis profession until 1850. In this year he caught the inspiration of\r\nadventure in the new El Dorado, and sailed for California. From that\r\ntime he continued a citizen of this State. He was widely known and\r\nuniversally respected. He practiced his profession with diligence; but\r\nmind and heart were inviting him to the life and career of a man of\r\nletters; and he was every day sacrificed to duty, as he esteemed it. He\r\nwas too conscientious to become indifferent to his clients' interests:\r\nbut he had no ambition for distinction as a jurist. He was utterly\r\nindifferent to the profits of his labors. He cared nothing for money, or\r\nfor those who possessed it. His real life and real enjoyments were of a\r\nfar different sort; and his genius was perpetually bound to the altar,\r\nand sacrificed by a sense of obligation, and a pride which never\r\npermitted him to abandon the profession for which he was educated. Like\r\nmany another man of peculiar mental qualities, he distrusted himself\r\nwhere he should have been most confident. The writer has often discussed\r\nwith Mr. Rhodes his professional and literary life, urged him to devote\r\nhimself to literature, and endeavored to point out to him the real road\r\nto success. But he dreaded the venture; and like a swift-footed blooded\r\nhorse, fit to run a course for a man's life, continued on his way,\r\nharnessed to a plow, and broke his heart in the harness!\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Rhodes will long be remembered by his contemporaries at\r\nthe Bar of California as a man of rare genius, exemplary habits, high\r\nhonor, and gentle manners, with wit and humor unexcelled. His writings\r\nare illumined by powerful fancy, scientific knowledge, and a reasoning\r\npower which gave to his most weird imaginations the similitude of truth\r\nand the apparel of facts. Nor did they, nor do they, do him justice. He\r\ncould have accomplished far more had circumstances been propitious to\r\nhim. That they were not, is and will always be a source of regret. That,\r\nenvironed as he was, he achieved so much more than his fellows, has made\r\nhis friends always loyal to him while living, and fond in their memories\r\nof him when dead. We give his productions to the world with\r\nsatisfaction, not unmingled with regret that what is, is only the faint\r\necho, the unfulfilled promise of what might have been. Still, may we\r\nsay, and ask those who read these sketches to say with us, as they lay\r\ndown the volume: \"_Habet enim justam venerationem, quicquid excellit._\"\r\n\r\nW. H. L.

This\r\nastounding narrative is prefaced by the annexed clipping from the\r\n\"Auburn Messenger\" of November 1, 1870:\r\n\r\n   A few days since, we called public attention to the singular\r\n   conduct of James G. Wilkins, justice of the peace for the \"Cape\r\n   Horn\" district, in this county, in discharging without trial a\r\n   man named Parker, who was, as we still think, seriously\r\n   implicated in the mysterious death of an old man named\r\n   Summerfield, who, our readers will probably remember, met so\r\n   tragical an end on the line of the Central Pacific Railroad, in\r\n   the month of October last. We have now to record another bold\r\n   outrage on public justice, in connection with the same affair.\r\n   The grand jury of Placer County has just adjourned, without\r\n   finding any bill against the person named above. Not only did\r\n   they refuse to find a true bill, or to make any presentment, but\r\n   they went one step further toward the exoneration of the\r\n   offender: they specially _ignored_ the indictment which our\r\n   district attorney deemed it his duty to present. The main facts\r\n   in relation to the arrest and subsequent discharge of Parker may\r\n   be summed up in few words:\r\n\r\n   It appears that, about the last of October, one Gregory\r\n   Summerfield, an old man nearly seventy years of age, in company\r\n   with Parker, took passage for Chicago, _via_ the Pacific\r\n   Railroad, and about the middle of the afternoon reached the\r\n   neighborhood of Cape Horn, in this county. Nothing of any special\r\n   importance seems to have attracted the attention of any of the\r\n   passengers toward these persons until a few moments before\r\n   passing the dangerous curve in the track, overlooking the North\r\n   Fork of the American River, at the place called Cape Horn. As our\r\n   readers are aware, the road at this point skirts a precipice,\r\n   with rocky perpendicular sides, extending to the bed of the\r\n   stream, nearly seventeen hundred feet below. Before passing the\r\n   curve, Parker was heard to comment upon the sublimity of the\r\n   scenery they were approaching, and finally requested the old man\r\n   to leave the car and stand upon the open platform, in order to\r\n   obtain a better view of the tremendous chasm and the mountains\r\n   just beyond. The two men left the car, and a moment afterwards a\r\n   cry of horror was heard by all the passengers, and the old man\r\n   was observed to fall at least one thousand feet upon the crags\r\n   below. The train was stopped for a few moments, but, fearful of a\r\n   collision if any considerable length of time should be lost in an\r\n   unavailing search for the mangled remains, it soon moved on\r\n   again, and proceeded as swiftly as possible to the next station.\r\n   There the miscreant Parker was arrested, and conveyed to the\r\n   office of the nearest justice of the peace for examination. We\r\n   understand that he refused to give any detailed account of the\r\n   transaction, only that \"the deceased either fell or was thrown\r\n   off from the moving train.\"\r\n\r\n   The examination was postponed until the arrival of Parker's\r\n   counsel, O'Connell & Kilpatrick, of Grass Valley, and after they\r\n   reached Cape Horn not a single word could be extracted from the\r\n   prisoner. It is said that the inquisition was a mere farce; there\r\n   being no witnesses present except one lady passenger, who, with\r\n   commendable spirit, volunteered to lay over one day, to give in\r\n   her testimony. We also learn that, after the trial, the justice,\r\n   together with the prisoner and his counsel, were closeted in\r\n   secret session for more than two hours; at the expiration of\r\n   which time the judge resumed his seat upon the bench, and\r\n   discharged the prisoner!\r\n\r\n   Now, we have no desire to do injustice toward any of the parties\r\n   to this singular transaction, much less to arm public sentiment\r\n   against an innocent man. But we do affirm that _there is, there\r\n   must be_, some profound mystery at the bottom of this affair, and\r\n   we shall do our utmost to fathom the secret.\r\n\r\nYes, there is a secret and mystery connected with the disappearance of\r\nSummerfield, and the sole object of this communication is to clear it\r\nup, and place myself right in the public estimation. But, in order to do\r\nso, it becomes essentially necessary to relate all the circumstances\r\nconnected with my first and subsequent acquaintance with Summerfield. To\r\ndo this intelligibly, I shall have to go back twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nIt is well known amongst my intimate friends that I resided in the late\r\nRepublic of Texas for many years antecedent to my immigration to this\r\nState. During the year 1847, whilst but a boy, and residing on the\r\nsea-beach some three or four miles from the city of Galveston, Judge\r\nWheeler, at that time Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, paid\r\nus a visit, and brought with him a gentleman, whom he had known several\r\nyears previously on the Sabine River, in the eastern part of that State.\r\nThis gentleman was introduced to us by the name of Summerfield. At that\r\ntime he was past the prime of life, slightly gray, and inclined to\r\ncorpulency. He was of medium height, and walked proudly erect, as though\r\nconscious of superior mental attainments. His face was one of those\r\nwhich, once seen, can never be forgotten. The forehead was broad, high,\r\nand protuberant. It was, besides, deeply graven with wrinkles, and\r\naltogether was the most intellectual that I had ever seen. It bore some\r\nresemblance to that of Sir Isaac Newton, but still more to Humboldt or\r\nWebster. The eyes were large, deep-set, and lustrous with a light that\r\nseemed kindled in their own depths. In color they were gray, and whilst\r\nin conversation absolutely blazed with intellect. His mouth was large,\r\nbut cut with all the precision of a sculptor's chiseling. He was rather\r\npale, but, when excited, his complexion lit up with a sudden rush of\r\nruddy flushes, that added something like beauty to his half-sad and\r\nhalf-sardonic expression. A word and a glance told me at once, this is a\r\nmost extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nJudge Wheeler knew but little of the antecedents of Summerfield. He was\r\nof Northern birth, but of what State it is impossible to say definitely.\r\nEarly in life he removed to the frontier of Arkansas, and pursued for\r\nsome years the avocation of village schoolmaster. It was the suggestion\r\nof Judge Wheeler that induced him to read law. In six months' time he\r\nhad mastered Story's Equity, and gained an important suit, based upon\r\none of its most recondite principles. But his heart was not in the legal\r\nprofession, and he made almost constant sallies into the fields of\r\nscience, literature and art. He was a natural mathematician, and was the\r\nmost profound and original arithmetician in the Southwest. He frequently\r\ncomputed the astronomical tables for the almanacs of New Orleans,\r\nPensacola and Mobile, and calculated eclipse, transit and observations\r\nwith ease and perfect accuracy. He was also deeply read in metaphysics,\r\nand wrote and published, in the old _Democratic Review_ for 1846, an\r\narticle on the \"Natural Proof of the Existence of a Deity,\" that for\r\nbeauty of language, depth of reasoning, versatility of illustration, and\r\ncompactness of logic, has never been equaled. The only other\r\npublication which at that period he had made, was a book that astonished\r\nall of his friends, both in title and execution. It was called \"The\r\nDesperadoes of the West,\" and purported to give minute details of the\r\nlives of some of the most noted duelists and blood-stained villains in\r\nthe Western States. But the book belied its title. It is full of\r\nsplendid description and original thought. No volume in the language\r\ncontains so many eloquent passages and such gorgeous imagery, in the\r\nsame space. His plea for immortality, on beholding the execution of one\r\nof the most noted culprits of Arkansas, has no parallel in any living\r\nlanguage for beauty of diction and power of thought. As my sole object\r\nin this communication is to defend myself, some acquaintance with the\r\nmental resources of Summerfield is absolutely indispensable; for his\r\ndeath was the immediate consequence of his splendid attainments. Of\r\nchemistry he was a complete master. He describes it in his article on a\r\nDeity, above alluded to, as the \"Youngest Daughter of the Sciences, born\r\namid flames, and cradled in rollers of fire.\" If there were any one\r\nscience to which he was more specially devoted than to any and all\r\nothers, it was chemistry. But he really seemed an adept in all, and\r\nshone about everywhere with equal lustre.\r\n\r\nMany of these characteristics were mentioned by Judge Wheeler at the\r\ntime of Summerfield's visit to Galveston, but others subsequently came\r\nto my knowledge, after his retreat to Brownsville, on the banks of the\r\nRio Grande. There he filled the position of judge of the District Court,\r\nand such was his position just previous to his arrival in this city in\r\nthe month of September of the past year.\r\n\r\nOne day toward the close of last September, an old man rapped at my\r\noffice door, and on invitation came in, and advancing, called me by\r\nname. Perceiving that I did not at first recognize him, he introduced\r\nhimself as Gregory Summerfield. After inviting him to a seat, I\r\nscrutinized his features more closely, and quickly identified him as the\r\nsame person whom I had met twenty-two years before. He was greatly\r\naltered in appearance, but the lofty forehead and the gray eye were\r\nstill there, unchanged and unchangeable. He was not quite so stout, but\r\nmore ruddy in complexion, and exhibited some symptoms, as I then\r\nthought, of intemperate drinking. Still there was the old charm of\r\nintellectual superiority in his conversation, and I welcomed him to\r\nCalifornia as an important addition to her mental wealth.\r\n\r\nIt was not many minutes before he requested a private interview. He\r\nfollowed me into my back office, carefully closed the door after him and\r\nlocked it. We had scarcely seated ourselves before he inquired of me if\r\nI had noticed any recent articles in the newspapers respecting the\r\ndiscovery of the art of decomposing water so as to fit it for use as a\r\nfuel for ordinary purposes?\r\n\r\nI replied that I had observed nothing new upon that subject since the\r\nexperiments of Agassiz and Professor Henry, and added that, in my\r\nopinion, the expensive mode of reduction would always prevent its use.\r\n\r\nIn a few words he then informed me that he had made the discovery that\r\nthe art was extremely simple, and the expense attending the\r\ndecomposition so slight as to be insignificant.\r\n\r\nPresuming then that the object of his visit to me was to procure the\r\nnecessary forms to get out a patent for the right, I congratulated him\r\nupon his good fortune, and was about to branch forth with a description\r\nof some of the great benefits that must ensue to the community, when he\r\nsuddenly and somewhat uncivilly requested me to \"be silent,\" and listen\r\nto what he had to say.\r\n\r\nHe began with some general remarks about the inequality of fortune\r\namongst mankind, and instanced himself as a striking example of the fate\r\nof those men, who, according to all the rules of right, ought to be near\r\nthe top, instead of at the foot of the ladder of fortune. \"But,\" said\r\nhe, springing to his feet with impulsive energy, \"I have now the means\r\nat my command of rising superior to fate, or of inflicting incalculable\r\nills upon the whole human race.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at him more closely, I thought I could detect in his eye the\r\ngleam of madness; but I remained silent and awaited further\r\ndevelopments. But my scrutiny, stolen as it was, had been detected, and\r\nhe replied at once to the expression of my face: \"No, sir; I am neither\r\ndrunk nor a maniac; I am in deep earnest in all that I say; and I am\r\nfully prepared, by actual experiment, to demonstrate beyond all doubt\r\nthe truth of all I claim.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time I noticed that he carried a small portmanteau in his\r\nhand; this he placed upon the table, unlocked it, and took out two or\r\nthree small volumes, a pamphlet or two, and a small, square,\r\nwide-mouthed vial, hermetically sealed.\r\n\r\nI watched him with profound curiosity, and took note of his slightest\r\nmovements. Having arranged his books to suit him, and placed the vial in\r\na conspicuous position, he drew up his chair very closely to my own, and\r\nuttered in a half-hissing tone: \"I demand one million dollars for the\r\ncontents of that bottle; and you must raise it for me in the city of\r\nSan Francisco within one month, or scenes too terrible even for the\r\nimagination to conceive, will surely be witnessed by every living human\r\nbeing on the face of the globe.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone, the manner, and the absurd extravagance of the demand, excited\r\na faint smile upon my lips, which he observed, but disdained to notice.\r\n\r\nMy mind was fully made up that I had a maniac to deal with, and I\r\nprepared to act accordingly. But I ascertained at once that my inmost\r\nthoughts were read by the remarkable man before me, and seemed to be\r\nanticipated by him in advance of their expression.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said I, \"Mr. Summerfield, you would oblige me by informing me\r\nfully of the grounds of your claim, and the nature of your discovery.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the object of my visit,\" he replied. \"I claim to have\r\ndiscovered the key which unlocks the constituent gases of water, and\r\nfrees each from the embrace of the other, at a single touch.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to assert,\" I rejoined, \"that you can make water burn itself\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more nor less,\" he responded, \"except this: to insist upon the\r\nconsequences of the secret, if my demand be not at once complied with.\"\r\n\r\nThen, without pausing for a moment to allow me to make a suggestion, as\r\nI once or twice attempted to do, he proceeded in a clear and deliberate\r\nmanner, in these words: \"I need not inform you, sir, that when this\r\nearth was created, it consisted almost wholly of vapor, which, by\r\ncondensation, finally became water. The oceans now occupy more than two\r\nthirds of the entire surface of the globe. The continents are mere\r\nislands in the midst of the seas. They are everywhere ocean-bound, and\r\nthe hyperborean north is hemmed in by open polar seas. Such is my first\r\nproposition. My second embraces the constituent elements of water. What\r\nis that thing which we call water? Chemistry, that royal queen of all\r\nthe sciences, answers readily: 'Water is but the combination of two\r\ngases, oxygen and hydrogen, and in the proportion of eight to one.' In\r\nother words, in order to form water, take eight parts of oxygen and one\r\nof hydrogen, mix them together, and the result or product is water. You\r\nsmile, sir, because, as you very properly think, these are the\r\nelementary principles of science, and are familiar to the minds of every\r\nschoolboy twelve years of age. Yes! but what next? Suppose you take\r\nthese same gases and mix them in any other proportion, I care not what,\r\nand the instantaneous result is heat, flame, combustion of the intensest\r\ndescription. The famous Drummond Light, that a few years ago astonished\r\nEurope--what is that but the ignited flame of a mixture of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen projected against a small piece of lime? What was harmless as\r\nwater, becomes the most destructive of all known objects when decomposed\r\nand mixed in any other proportion.\r\n\r\n\"Now, suppose I fling the contents of this small vial into the Pacific\r\nOcean, what would be the result? Dare you contemplate it for an instant?\r\nI do not assert that the entire surface of the sea would instantaneously\r\nbubble up into insufferable flames; no, but from the nucleus of a\r\ncircle, of which this vial would be the centre, lurid radii of flames\r\nwould gradually shoot outward, until the blazing circumference would\r\nroll in vast billows of fire, upon the uttermost shores. Not all the\r\ndripping clouds of the deluge could extinguish it. Not all the tears of\r\nsaints and angels could for an instant check its progress. On and onward\r\nit would sweep, with the steady gait of destiny, until the continents\r\nwould melt with fervent heat, the atmosphere glare with the ominous\r\nconflagration, and all living creatures, in land and sea and air, perish\r\nin one universal catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly starting to his feet, he drew himself up to his full\r\nheight, and murmured solemnly, \"I feel like a God! and I recognize my\r\nfellow-men but as pigmies that I spurn beneath my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Summerfield,\" said I calmly, \"there must be some strange error in all\r\nthis. You are self-deluded. The weapon which you claim to wield is one\r\nthat a good God and a beneficent Creator would never intrust to the\r\nkeeping of a mere creature. What, sir! create a world as grand and\r\nbeautiful as this, and hide within its bosom a principle that at any\r\nmoment might inwrap it in flames, and sink all life in death? I'll not\r\nbelieve it; 't were blasphemy to entertain the thought!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" cried he passionately, \"your Bible prophesies the same\r\nirreverence. Look at your text in 2d Peter, third chapter, seventh and\r\ntwelfth verses. Are not the elements to melt with fervent heat? Are not\r\n'the heavens to be folded together like a scroll?' Are not 'the rocks to\r\nmelt, the stars to fall and the moon to be turned into blood?' Is not\r\nfire the next grand cyclic consummation of all things here below? But I\r\ncome fully prepared to answer such objections. Your argument betrays a\r\nnarrow mind, circumscribed in its orbit, and shallow in its depth. 'Tis\r\nthe common thought of mediocrity. You have read books too much, and\r\nstudied nature too little. Let me give you a lesson to-day in the\r\nworkshop of Omnipotence. Take a stroll with me into the limitless\r\nconfines of space, and let us observe together some of the scenes\r\ntranspiring at this very instant around us. A moment ago you spoke of\r\nthe moon: what is she but an extinguished world? You spoke of the sun:\r\nwhat is he but a globe of flame? But here is the _Cosmos_ of Humboldt.\r\nRead this paragraph.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this he placed before me the _Cosmos_ of Humboldt, and I read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n   Nor do the Heavens themselves teach unchangeable permanency in\r\n   the works of creation. Change is observable there quite as rapid\r\n   and complete as in the confines of our solar system. In the year\r\n   1752, one of the small stars in the constellation Cassiopeia\r\n   blazed up suddenly into an orb of the first magnitude, gradually\r\n   decreased in brilliancy, and finally disappeared from the skies.\r\n   Nor has it ever been visible since that period for a single\r\n   moment, either to the eye or to the telescope. It burned up and\r\n   was lost in space.\r\n\r\n\"Humboldt,\" he added, \"has not told us who set that world on fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" resumed he, \"I have still clearer proofs.\" Saying this, he thrust\r\ninto my hands the last London _Quarterly_, and on opening the book at an\r\narticle headed \"The Language of Light,\" I read with a feeling akin to\r\nawe, the following passage:\r\n\r\n   Further, some stars exhibit changes of complexion in themselves.\r\n   Sirius, as before stated, was once a ruddy, or rather a\r\n   fiery-faced orb, but has now forgotten to blush, and looks down\r\n   upon us with a pure, brilliant smile, in which there is no trace\r\n   either of anger or of shame. On the countenances of others, still\r\n   more varied traits have rippled, within a much briefer period of\r\n   time. May not these be due to some physiological revolutions,\r\n   general or convulsive, which are in progress in the particular\r\n   orb, and which, by affecting the constitution of its atmosphere,\r\n   compel the absorption or promote the transmission of particular\r\n   rays? The supposition appears by no means improbable, especially\r\n   if we call to mind the hydrogen volcanoes which have been\r\n   discovered on the photosphere of the sun. Indeed, there are a few\r\n   small stars which afford a spectrum of bright lines instead of\r\n   dark ones, and this we know denotes a gaseous or vaporized state\r\n   of things, from which it may be inferred that such orbs are in a\r\n   different condition from most of their relations.\r\n\r\n   And as, if for the very purpose of throwing light upon this\r\n   interesting question, an event of the most striking character\r\n   occurred in the heavens, almost as soon as the spectroscopists\r\n   were prepared to interpret it correctly.\r\n\r\n   On the 12th of May, 1866, a great conflagration, infinitely\r\n   larger than that of London or Moscow, was announced. To use the\r\n   expression of a distinguished astronomer, a world was found to be\r\n   on fire! A star, which till then had shone weakly and\r\n   unobtrusively in the _corona borealis_, suddenly blazed up into a\r\n   luminary of the second magnitude. In the course of three days\r\n   from its discovery in this new character, by Birmingham, at Tuam,\r\n   it had declined to the third or fourth order of brilliancy. In\r\n   twelve days, dating from its first apparition in the Irish\r\n   heavens, it had sunk to the eighth rank, and it went on waning\r\n   until the 26th of June, when it ceased to be discernible except\r\n   through the medium of the telescope. This was a remarkable,\r\n   though certainly not an unprecedented proceeding on the part of a\r\n   star; but one singular circumstance in its behavior was that,\r\n   after the lapse of nearly two months, it began to blaze up again,\r\n   though not with equal ardor, and after maintaining its glow for a\r\n   few weeks, and passing through sundry phases of color, it\r\n   gradually paled its fires, and returned to its former\r\n   insignificance. How many years had elapsed since this awful\r\n   conflagration actually took place, it would be presumptuous to\r\n   guess; but it must be remembered that news from the heavens,\r\n   though carried by the fleetest of messengers, light, reaches us\r\n   long after the event has transpired, and that the same celestial\r\n   carrier is still dropping the tidings at each station it reaches\r\n   in space, until it sinks exhausted by the length of its flight.\r\n\r\n   As the star had suddenly flamed up, was it not a natural\r\n   supposition that it had become inwrapped in burning hydrogen,\r\n   which in consequence of some great convulsion had been liberated\r\n   in prodigious quantities, and then combining with other elements,\r\n   had set this hapless world on fire? In such a fierce\r\n   conflagration, the combustible gas would soon be consumed, and\r\n   the glow would therefore begin to decline, subject, as in this\r\n   case, to a second eruption, which occasioned the renewed outburst\r\n   of light on the 20th of August.\r\n\r\n   By such a catastrophe, it is not wholly impossible that our own\r\n   globe may some time be ravaged; for if a word from the Almighty\r\n   were to unloose for a few moments the bonds of affinity which\r\n   unite the elements of water, a single spark would bring them\r\n   together with a fury that would kindle the funeral pyre of the\r\n   human race, and be fatal to the planet and all the works that are\r\n   thereon.\r\n\r\n\"Your argument,\" he then instantly added, \"is by no means a good one.\r\nWhat do we know of the Supreme Architect of the Universe, or of his\r\ndesigns? He builds up worlds, and he pulls them down; he kindles suns\r\nand he extinguishes them. He inflames the comet, in one portion of its\r\norbit, with a heat that no human imagination can conceive of; and in\r\nanother, subjects the same blazing orb to a cold intenser than that\r\nwhich invests forever the antarctic pole. All that we know of Him we\r\ngather through His works. I have shown you that He burns other worlds,\r\nwhy not this? The habitable parts of our globe are surrounded by water,\r\nand water you know is fire in possibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"But all this,\" I rejoined, \"is pure, baseless, profitless speculation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast,\" he answered. And then rising, he seized the small vial,\r\nand handing it to me, requested me to open it.\r\n\r\nI confess I did so with some trepidation.\r\n\r\n\"Now smell it.\"\r\n\r\nI did so.\r\n\r\n\"What odor do you perceive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Potassium,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he added, \"you are familiar with the chief characteristic\r\nof that substance. It ignites instantly when brought in contact with\r\nwater. Within that little globule of potassium, I have imbedded a pill\r\nof my own composition and discovery. The moment it is liberated from the\r\npotassium, it commences the work of decomposing the fluid on which it\r\nfloats. The potassium at once ignites the liberated oxygen, and the\r\nconflagration of this mighty globe is begun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"begun, if you please, but your little pill soon\r\nevaporates or sinks, or melts in the surrounding seas, and your\r\nconflagration ends just where it began.\"\r\n\r\n\"My reply to that suggestion could be made at once by simply testing the\r\nexperiment on a small scale, or a large one, either. But I prefer at\r\npresent to refute your proposition by an argument drawn from nature\r\nherself. If you correctly remember, the first time I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing you was on the island of Galveston, many years ago. Do you\r\nremember relating to me at that time an incident concerning the effects\r\nof a prairie on fire, that you had yourself witnessed but a few days\r\npreviously, near the town of Matagorde? If I recollect correctly, you\r\nstated that on your return journey from that place, you passed on the\r\nway the charred remains of two wagon-loads of cotton, and three human\r\nbeings, that the night before had perished in the flames; that three\r\nslaves, the property of a Mr. Horton, had started a few days before to\r\ncarry to market a shipment of cotton; that a norther overtook them on\r\nthe treeless prairie, and a few minutes afterwards they were surprised\r\nby beholding a line of rushing fire, surging, roaring and advancing like\r\nthe resistless billows of an ocean swept by a gale; that there was no\r\ntime for escape, and they perished terribly in fighting the devouring\r\nelement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I recollect the event.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, I wish a reply to the simple question: Did the single spark,\r\nthat kindled the conflagration, consume the negroes and their charge?\r\nNo? But what did? You reply, of course, that the spark set the entire\r\nprairie on fire; that each spear of grass added fuel to the flame, and\r\nkindled by degrees a conflagration that continued to burn so long as it\r\ncould feed on fresh material. The pillule in that vial is the little\r\nspark, the oceans are the prairies, and the oxygen the fuel upon which\r\nthe fire is to feed until the globe perishes in inextinguishable flames.\r\nThe elementary substances in that small vial recreate themselves; they\r\nare self-generating, and when once fairly under way must necessarily\r\nsweep onward, until the waters in all the seas are exhausted. There is,\r\nhowever, one great difference between the burning of a prairie and the\r\ncombustion of an ocean: the fire in the first spreads slowly, for the\r\nfuel is difficult to ignite; in the last, it flies with the rapidity of\r\nthe wind, for the substance consumed is oxygen, the most inflammable\r\nagent in nature.\"\r\n\r\nRising from my seat, I went to the washstand in the corner of the\r\napartment, and drawing a bowl half full of Spring Valley water, I turned\r\nto Summerfield, and remarked, \"Words are empty, theories are ideal--but\r\nfacts are things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I take you at your word.\" So saying, he approached the bowl, emptied it\r\nof nine-tenths of its contents, and silently dropped the\r\npotassium-coated pill into the liquid. The potassium danced around the\r\nedges of the vessel, fuming, hissing, and blazing, as it always does,\r\nand seemed on the point of expiring--when, to my astonishment and alarm,\r\na sharp explosion took place, and in a second of time the water was\r\nblazing in a red, lurid column, half way to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake,\" I cried, \"extinguish the flames, or we shall set the\r\nbuilding on fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I dropped the potassium into the bowl as you prepared it,\" he\r\nquietly remarked, \"the building would indeed have been consumed.\"\r\n\r\nLower and lower fell the flickering flames, paler and paler grew the\r\nblaze, until finally the fire went out, and I rushed up to see the\r\neffects of the combustion.\r\n\r\nNot a drop of water remained in the vessel! Astonished beyond measure at\r\nwhat I had witnessed, and terrified almost to the verge of insanity, I\r\napproached Summerfield, and tremblingly inquired, \"To whom, sir, is this\r\ntremendous secret known?\" \"To myself alone,\" he responded; \"and now\r\nanswer me a question: is it worth the money?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is entirely unnecessary to relate in detail the subsequent events\r\nconnected with this transaction. I will only add a general statement,\r\nshowing the results of my negotiations. Having fully satisfied myself\r\nthat Summerfield actually held in his hands the fate of the whole world,\r\nwith its millions of human beings, and by experiment having tested the\r\ncombustion of sea-water, with equal facility as fresh, I next deemed it\r\nmy duty to call the attention of a few of the principal men in San\r\nFrancisco to the extreme importance of Summerfield's discovery.\r\n\r\nA leading banker, a bishop, a chemist, two State university professors,\r\na physician, a judge, and two Protestant divines, were selected by me to\r\nwitness the experiment on a large scale. This was done at a small\r\nsand-hill lake, near the sea-shore, but separated from it by a ridge of\r\nlofty mountains, distant not more than ten miles from San Francisco.\r\nEvery single drop of water in the pool was burnt up in less than fifteen\r\nminutes. We next did all that we could to pacify Summerfield, and\r\nendeavored to induce him to lower his price and bring it within the\r\nbounds of a reasonable possibility. But without avail. He began to grow\r\nurgent in his demands, and his brow would cloud like a tempest-ridden\r\nsky whenever we approached him on the subject. Finally, ascertaining\r\nthat no persuasion could soften his heart or touch his feelings, a\r\nsub-committee was appointed, to endeavor, if possible, to raise the\r\nmoney by subscription. Before taking that step, however, we ascertained\r\nbeyond all question that Summerfield was the sole custodian of his dread\r\nsecret, and that he kept no written memorial of the formula of his\r\nprescription. He even went so far as to offer us a penal bond that his\r\nsecret should perish with him in case we complied with his demands.\r\n\r\nThe sub-committee soon commenced work amongst the wealthiest citizens of\r\nSan Francisco, and by appealing to the terrors of a few, and the\r\nsympathies of all, succeeded in raising one half the amount within the\r\nprescribed period. I shall never forget the woe-begone faces of\r\nCalifornia Street during the month of October. The outside world and the\r\nnewspapers spoke most learnedly of a money panic--a pressure in\r\nbusiness, and the disturbances in the New York gold-room. But to the\r\ninitiated, there was an easier solution of the enigma. The pale spectre\r\nof Death looked down upon them all, and pointed with its bony finger to\r\nthe fiery tomb of the whole race, already looming up in the distance\r\nbefore them. Day after day, I could see the dreadful ravages of this\r\nsecret horror; doubly terrible, since they dared not divulge it. Still,\r\ndo all that we could, the money could not be obtained. The day preceding\r\nthe last one given, Summerfield was summoned before the committee, and\r\nfull information given him of the state of affairs. Obdurate, hard and\r\ncruel, he still continued. Finally, a proposition was started, that an\r\nattempt should be made to raise the other half of the money in the city\r\nof New York. To this proposal Summerfield ultimately yielded, but with\r\nextreme reluctance. It was agreed in committee, that I should accompany\r\nhim thither, and take with me, in my own possession, evidences of the\r\nsums subscribed here; that a proper appeal should be made to the lending\r\ncapitalists, scholars and clergymen of that metropolis, and that, when\r\nthe whole amount was raised, it should be paid over to Summerfield, and\r\na bond taken from him never to divulge his awful secret to any human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nWith this, he seemed to be satisfied, and left us to prepare for his\r\ngoing the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he left the apartment, the bishop arose, and deprecated the\r\naction that had been taken, and characterized it as childish and absurd.\r\nHe declared that no man was safe one moment whilst \"that diabolical\r\nwretch\" still lived; that the only security for us all, was in his\r\nimmediate extirpation from the face of the earth, and that no amount of\r\nmoney could seal his lips, or close his hands. It would be no crime, he\r\nsaid, to deprive him of the means of assassinating the whole human\r\nfamily, and that as for himself he was for dooming him to immediate\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWith a unanimity that was extraordinary, the entire committee coincided.\r\n\r\nA great many plans were proposed, discussed and rejected, having in view\r\nthe extermination of Summerfield. In them all there was the want of that\r\nproper caution which would lull the apprehensions of an enemy; for\r\nshould he for an instant suspect treachery, we knew his nature well\r\nenough to be satisfied, that he would waive all ceremonies and carry his\r\nthreats into immediate execution.\r\n\r\nIt was finally resolved that the trip to New York should not be\r\nabandoned, apparently. But that we were to start out in accordance with\r\nthe original programme; that during the journey, some proper means\r\nshould be resorted to by me to carry out the final intentions of the\r\ncommittee, and that whatever I did would be sanctioned by them all, and\r\nfull protection, both in law and conscience, afforded me in any stage of\r\nthe proceeding.\r\n\r\nNothing was wanting but my own consent; but this was difficult to\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nAt the first view, it seemed to be a most horrible and unwarrantable\r\ncrime to deprive a fellow-being of life, under any circumstances; but\r\nespecially so where, in meeting his fate, no opportunity was to be\r\nafforded him for preparation or repentance. It was a long time before I\r\ncould disassociate, in my mind, the two ideas of act and intent. My\r\nstudies had long ago made me perfectly familiar with the doctrine of the\r\ncivil law, that in order to constitute guilt, there must be a union of\r\naction and intention. Taking the property of another is not theft,\r\nunless, as the lawyers term it, there is the _animus furandi_. So, in\r\nhomicide, life may be lawfully taken in some instances, whilst the deed\r\nmay be excused in others. The sheriff hangs the felon, and deprives him\r\nof existence; yet nobody thinks of accusing the officer of murder. The\r\nsoldier slays his enemy, still the act is considered heroical. It does\r\nnot therefore follow that human life is too sacred to be taken away\r\nunder all circumstances. The point to be considered was thus narrowed\r\ndown into one grand inquiry, whether Summerfield was properly to be\r\nregarded as _hostis humani generis_ the enemy of the human race or not.\r\nIf he should justly be so considered, then it would not only be not a\r\ncrime to kill him, but an act worthy of the highest commendation. Who\r\nblamed McKenzie for hanging Spencer to the yard-arm? Yet in his case,\r\nthe lives of only a small ship's crew were in jeopardy. Who condemned\r\nPompey for exterminating the pirates from the Adriatic? Yet, in his\r\ncase, only a small portion of the Roman Republic was liable to\r\ndevastation. Who accuses Charlotte Corday of assassination for stabbing\r\nMurat in his bath? Still, her arm only saved the lives of a few\r\nthousands of revolutionary Frenchmen. And to come down to our own times,\r\nwho heaps accusation upon the heads of Lincoln, Thomas or Sheridan, or\r\neven Grant, though in marching to victory over a crushed rebellion, they\r\ndeemed it necessary to wade through seas of human gore? If society has\r\nthe right to defend itself from the assaults of criminals, who, at best,\r\ncan only destroy a few of its members, why should I hesitate when it was\r\napparent that the destiny of the globe itself hung in the balance? If\r\nSummerfield should live and carry out his threats, the whole world would\r\nfeel the shock; his death was the only path to perfect safety.\r\n\r\nI asked the privilege of meditation for one hour, at the hands of the\r\ncommittee, before I would render a decision either way. During that\r\nrecess the above argumentation occupied my thoughts. The time expired,\r\nand I again presented myself before them. I did not deem it requisite to\r\nstate the grounds of my decision; I briefly signified my assent, and\r\nmade instant preparation to carry the plan into execution.\r\n\r\nHaving passed on the line of the Pacific Railway more than once, I was\r\nperfectly familiar with all of its windings, gorges and precipices.\r\n\r\nI selected Cape Horn as the best adapted to the purpose, and ... the\r\npublic knows the rest.\r\n\r\nHaving been fully acquitted by two tribunals of the law, I make this\r\nfinal appeal to my fellow-men throughout the State, and ask them\r\nconfidently not to reverse the judgments already pronounced.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of no guilt; I feel no remorse; I need no repentance. For\r\nme justice has no terrors, and conscience no sting. Let me be judged\r\nsolely by the motives which actuated me, and the importance of the end\r\naccomplished, and I shall pass, unscathed, both temporal and eternal\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\n                                               LEONIDAS PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_THE MERCHANT'S EXCHANGE._\r\n\r\n\r\n    One summer eve, as homeward saunt'ring slowly,\r\n      My toils and tasks for that day's business done;\r\n    With thoughts composed, and aspirations holy,\r\n      That heavenward rose, as downward sank the sun,\r\n    I heard a throng, whose multitudinous voices\r\n      Proclaimed some act of public weal begun.\r\n\r\n    The glad acclaim invited close inspection;\r\n      And through the crowd I gently made my way,\r\n    Till, standing firm upon a light projection,\r\n      That spanned a chasm dug deep into the clay,\r\n    I heard above the din of city noises,\r\n      An honored voice, in solemn accents say:\r\n\r\n    \"In presence of Creation's awful Builder,\r\n      I lay for you this polished corner-stone;\r\n    God grant no ills your architect bewilder\r\n      Till into strength and beauty shall have grown\r\n    The MERCHANT'S 'CHANGE that shall adorn your Guilder\r\n      When ye have mouldered into dust and bone!\"\r\n\r\n    Day after day, whilst passing to my labor,\r\n      I saw that gorgeous edifice arise;\r\n    Until its dome, like crest of sacred Tabor,\r\n      Sprang from the earth, and arching in the skies,\r\n    O'ertopp'd the peak of each aspiring neighbor\r\n      That wooed a tribute from the upturned eyes.\r\n\r\n    There was no pomp of pious dedication,\r\n      Boasting this Temple sanctified to God;\r\n    And yet my soul, in prayerful meditation,\r\n      Believed no less it might be His abode:\r\n    For when His arm from bondage led a nation,\r\n      He heard their cry, though kneeling on the sod!\r\n\r\n    Around this mart the world's great trade shall centre;\r\n      Within these walls a Babel tumult sound,\r\n    Not that which made doomed Shinar a memento\r\n      Of human pride laid level to the ground,\r\n    But blended music of all tongues shall enter,\r\n      And in trade's peaceful symphonies resound!\r\n\r\n    Above this portal shall no monarch thunder,\r\n      No grand patrician lord it o'er a slave;\r\n    Here shall the pagan's bonds be snapt asunder,\r\n      And creed and race no proud distinction crave;\r\n    Here shall mankind their shackles trample under,\r\n      And freedom's banner over freemen wave!\r\n\r\n    Here shall Confucius braid his ebon tresses,\r\n      Perfume the cup with aromatic teas,\r\n    Supply gay beauty with her gaudiest dresses,--\r\n      The worm's fine fabric, and the Bactrian fleece;\r\n    And in exchange shall quaff a balm that blesses,\r\n      Freedom and truth, in every passing breeze!\r\n\r\n    Here Kamehameha realize the splendor\r\n      Foretold by sirens, singing 'round his isles,\r\n    How cane and pulu be the realm's defender,\r\n      And roof his palaces with golden tiles;--\r\n    When sturdy Saxons should their hearts surrender\r\n      In captive bonds to coy Kanaka wiles!\r\n\r\n    Here Petropaulowski store her richest sables,\r\n      Tahiti waft her oranges and limes,\r\n    The Lascar weave his stout manila cables,\r\n      The Malay chafler midst his porcelain chimes,\r\n    Ceylon with spices scent our groaning tables,\r\n      Pariah bring Golconda's gems, not crimes;\r\n    Beneath this dome the Tycoon's gory dragon\r\n      Shall fold his wings, and close his fiery eyes;\r\n    Here quaffing from the same enchanted flagon,\r\n      Fraternal incense shall to Heaven arise;\r\n    Whilst Vishnu, Thor, Jehovah, Bhudd, and Dagon,\r\n      Shall cease all strife, and struggle for the prize!\r\n\r\n    Oh!

never may a son of thine,\r\n     Where'er his wand'ring steps incline,\r\n     Forget the sky which bent above\r\n     His childhood, like a dream of love.\"\r\n\r\n                                      --WHITTIER.\r\n\r\nThere is no silence like that sombre gloom which sometimes settles down\r\nupon the deserted playgrounds, the unoccupied benches, and the voiceless\r\nhalls of an old schoolhouse. But if, in addition to abandonment, the\r\nfingers of decay have been busy with their work; if the moss has been\r\npermitted to grow, and the mould to gather; if the cobwebs cluster, like\r\nclouds, in all the corners, and the damp dust incrusts the window-panes\r\nlike the frosts of a northern winter; if the old well has caved in, and\r\nthe little paths through the brushwood been smothered, and the fences\r\nrotted down, and the stile gone to ruin, then a feeling of utter\r\ndesolation seizes upon the soul, which no philosophy can master, no\r\nrecollections soothe, and no lapse of time dissipate.\r\n\r\nPerchance a lonely wanderer may be observed, traversing the same scenes\r\nwhich many years ago were trodden by his ungrown feet, looking pensively\r\nat each tree which sheltered his boyhood, peeping curiously under the\r\nbroken benches on which he once sat, and turning over most carefully\r\nwith his cane every scrap of old paper, that strangely enough had\r\nsurvived the winds and the rains of many winters.\r\n\r\nSuch a schoolhouse now stands near the little village of Woodville, in\r\nthe State of North Carolina, and such a wanderer was I in the autumn of\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nWoodville was the scene of my first studies, my earliest adventures, and\r\nmy nascent loves. There I was taught to read and write, to swim and\r\nskate, to wrestle and box, to play marbles and make love. There I fought\r\nmy first fight, had the mumps and the measles, stole my first\r\nwatermelon, and received my first flogging. And I can never forget, that\r\nwithin that tattered schoolroom my young heart first swelled with those\r\nbudding passions, whose full development in others has so often changed\r\nthe fortunes of the world. There eloquence produced its first throb,\r\nambition struck its first spark, pride mounted its first stilts, love\r\nfelt its first glow. There the eternal ideas of God and heaven, of\r\npatriotism and country, of love and woman, germinated in my bosom; and\r\nthere, too, Poesy sang her first song in my enchanted ear, lured me far\r\noff into the \"grand old woods\" alone, sported with the unlanguaged\r\nlongings of my boyish heart, and subdued me for the first time with that\r\nmysterious sorrow, whose depths the loftiest intellect cannot sound, and\r\nyet whose wailings mournfully agitate many a schoolboy's breast.\r\n\r\nI reached the village of Woodville one afternoon in November, after an\r\nabsence of twenty-two years. Strange faces greeted me, instead of old,\r\nfamiliar ones; huge dwellings stood where once I had rambled through\r\ncornfields, groves of young pines covered the old common in which I had\r\nonce played at ball, and everything around presented such an aspect of\r\nchange, that I almost doubted my personal identity. Nor was my\r\nastonishment diminished in the slightest degree when the landlord of the\r\ninn announced his name, and I recognized it as once belonging to a\r\nplaymate famous for mischief and fleetness. Now he appeared bloated,\r\nlanguid, and prematurely old. Bushy whiskers nearly covered his face, a\r\nhorrid gash almost closed up one of his eyes, and an ominous limp told\r\nthat he would run no more foot-races forever.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to provoke inquiries by mentioning my own name, and doubly\r\nanxious to see the old schoolhouse, which I had traveled many miles out\r\nof my way to visit, I took my cane and strolled leisurely along the road\r\nthat my feet had hurried over so often in boyhood.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse was situated in a small grove of oaks and hickories,\r\nabout half a mile from the village, so as to be more retired, but at the\r\nsame time more convenient for those who resided in the country. My\r\nimagination flew faster than my steps, and under its influence the half\r\nmile dwindled to a mere rod. Passing a turn in the road, which concealed\r\nit until within a few paces, it suddenly burst upon my vision in all the\r\nhorrors of its desolation. A fearful awe took possession of me, and as I\r\nstood beneath the trees I had so often climbed in years gone by, I could\r\nnot refrain from looking uneasily behind me, and treading more softly\r\nupon the sacred leaves, just commencing to wither and fall.\r\n\r\nI approached the door with as much reverence as ever crept Jew or\r\nMussulman, on bended knee and with downcast eye, to the portals of the\r\nKabbala or Holy of Holies, and as I reached forth my hand to turn the\r\nlatch, I involuntarily paused to listen before I crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nAh, manhood! what are all thy triumphs compared to a schoolboy's palms!\r\nWhat are thy infamies compared to his disgraces! As head of his class,\r\nhe carries a front which a monarch might emulate in vain; as master of\r\nthe playground, he wields a sceptre more indisputable than Czar or Cæsar\r\never bore! As a favorite, he provokes a bitterer hostility than ever\r\ngreeted a Bute or a Buckingham; as a coward or traitor, he is loaded\r\nwith a contumely beneath which Arnold or Hull would have sunk forever!\r\n\r\nI listened. The pleasant hum of busy voices, the sharp tones of the\r\nmaster, the mumbled accents of hurried recitations, all were gone. The\r\ngathering shadows of evening corresponded most fittingly with the\r\ndeepening gloom of my recollections, and I abandoned myself to their\r\nguidance, without an effort to control or direct them.\r\n\r\nI stood _alone_ upon the step. Where was he, whose younger hand always\r\nlocked in mine, entered that room and left it so often by my side; that\r\nbright-eyed boy, whose quick wit and genial temper won for him the\r\naffections both of master and scholar; that gentle spirit that kindled\r\ninto love, or saddened into tears, as easily as sunshine dallies with a\r\nflower or raindrops fall from a summer cloud; that brother, whose genius\r\nwas my pride, whose courage my admiration, whose soul my glory; he who\r\nfaltered not before the walls of Camargo, when but seven men, out of as\r\nmany hundred in his regiment, volunteered to go forward, under the\r\ncommand of Taylor, to endure all the hardships of a soldier's life, in a\r\ntropical clime, and to brave all the dangers of a three days' assault\r\nupon a fortified city; he who fought so heroically at Monterey, and\r\nescaped death in so many forms on the battle-field, only to meet it at\r\nlast as a victim to contagion, contracted at the bedside of a friend?\r\nWhere was he? The swift waters of the Rio Grande, as they hurry past his\r\nunsculptured grave, sing his requiem, and carry along proudly to the\r\neverlasting sea the memory of his noble self sacrifice, as the purest\r\ntribute they bear upon their tide!\r\n\r\nSuch were my thoughts, as I stood pensively upon the block that served\r\nas a step when I was boy, and which still occupied its ancient position.\r\nI noticed that a large crack extended its whole length, and several\r\nshrubs, of no insignificant size, were growing out of the aperture. This\r\nprepared me for the wreck and ruin of the interior. The door had been\r\ntorn from its hinge, and was sustained in an upright position by a bar\r\nor prop on the inside. This readily gave way on a slight pressure, and\r\nas the old door tumbled headlong upon the floor, it awoke a thousand\r\nconfused and muffled echoes, more startling to me than a clap of the\r\nloudest thunder. But the moment I passed the threshold, the gloom and\r\nterror instantly vanished. I noticed that the back door was open, and in\r\ncasting my glance to the upper end of the room, where the Rev. Mr. Craig\r\nonce presided in state, my eyes were greeted by an apparition, that had\r\nevidently become domiciliated in the premises, and whose appearance\r\nrevolutionized the whole tenor of my thoughts. Before me stood one of\r\nthose venerable-looking billy-goats, of sedate eye, fantastic beard, and\r\ncrumpled horn, the detestation of perfumed belle, and the dread of\r\nmischievous urchin. I had seen a _fac-simile_ of him many years before,\r\nnot exactly in the same place, but hard by in a thicket of pines. I\r\ncould almost fancy it to be the ghost of the murdered ancestor, or some\r\nphantom sent to haunt me near the spot of his execution. I shed no tear,\r\nI heaved no sigh, as I trod the dust-covered floor of the \"Woodville\r\nAcademy,\" but greeted my _Alma Mater_ with a shout of almost boyish\r\nlaughter as I approached the spot where the pedagogue once sat upon his\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nTo explain why it was that my feelings underwent a revulsion so sudden,\r\nI must relate the Story of the Murdered Billy-goat.\r\n\r\nColonel Averitt, a brave soldier in the war of 1812, retired from the\r\narmy at the termination of hostilities, and settled upon a farm\r\nadjoining the village of Woodville. He was rather a queer old gentleman;\r\nhad a high Roman nose, and, on muster days, was the general admiration\r\nof all Bertie County. He then officiated as colonel commandant of\r\nmilitia, and dressed in full uniform, with a tall, white feather waving\r\nmost belligerently from his three-cornered cocked hat. He wore a sash\r\nand sword, and always reviewed the troops on horseback.\r\n\r\nOne day, after a statutory review of the militia of the county, a\r\nproposition was started to form a volunteer company of mounted hussars.\r\nA nucleus was soon obtained, and in less than a week a sufficient number\r\nhad enrolled themselves to authorize the Colonel to order a drill. It\r\nhappened on a Saturday; the place selected was an old field near the\r\nschoolhouse, and I need not add that the entire battalion of boys was\r\nout in full force, as spectators of the warlike exercises. How they got\r\nthrough with the parade, I have forgotten; but I do remember that the\r\nmania for soldiering, from that day forward, took possession of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe enrollment at first consisted entirely of infantry, and several\r\nweeks elapsed before anybody ventured to suggest a mounted corps. Late\r\none afternoon, however, as we were returning homeward, with drums\r\nbeating and colors flying, we disturbed a flock of lazy goats, browsing\r\nupon dry grass, and evincing no great dread for the doughty warriors\r\nadvancing. Our captain, whose dignity was highly offended at this utter\r\nwant of respect, gave the order to \"form column!\" \"present arms!\" and\r\n\"charge!\" Austrian nor Spaniard, Italian nor Prussian, before the\r\nresistless squadrons of Murat or Macdonald, ever displayed finer\r\nqualities of light infantry or flying artillery, than did the vanquished\r\nenemy of the \"Woodville Cadets\" on this memorable occasion. They were\r\ntaken entirely by surprise, and, without offering the least resistance,\r\nright-about-faced, and fled precipitously from the field. Their\r\nterrified bleating mingled fearfully with our shouts of victory; and\r\nwhen, at the command of our captain. I blew the signal to halt and\r\nrendezvous, our brave fellows magnanimously gave up the pursuit, and\r\nreturned from the chase, bringing with them no less than five full-grown\r\nprisoners, as trophies of victory!\r\n\r\nA council of war was immediately called, to determine in what way we\r\nshould dispose of our booty. After much learned discussion, and some\r\nwarm disputes, the propositions were narrowed down to two:\r\n\r\nPlan the first was, to cut off all the beard of each prisoner, flog, and\r\nrelease him.\r\n\r\nPlan the second, on the contrary, was, to conduct the prisoners to the\r\nplayground, treat them kindly, and endeavor to train them to the bit and\r\nsaddle, so as to furnish the officers with what they needed so\r\nmuch,--war-steeds for battle, fiery chargers for review.\r\n\r\nThe vote was finally taken, and plan number two was adopted by a\r\nconsiderable majority.\r\n\r\nObstacles are never insurmountable to boys and Bonapartes! Our _coup\r\nd'etat_ succeeded quite as well as that of the 2d of December, and\r\nbefore a week elapsed the chief officers were all splendidly mounted and\r\nfully equipped.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the war against the \"bearded races,\" the cavalry\r\nquestion was propounded by one of the privates in Company A. For his\r\npart, he declared candidly that he was tired of marching and\r\ncountermarching afoot, and that he saw no good reason why an invasion of\r\nthe enemy's country should not at once be undertaken, to secure animals\r\nenough to mount the whole regiment.\r\n\r\nAnother council was held, and the resolve unanimously adopted, to cross\r\nthe border in full force, on the next Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the clouds of war began to thicken in another quarter.\r\nColonel Averitt had been informed of the _coup d'etat_ related above,\r\nand determined to prevent any further depredations on his flock by a\r\nstroke of masterly generalship, worthy of his prowess in the late war\r\nwith Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd now it becomes proper to introduce upon the scene the most important\r\npersonage in this history, and the hero of the whole story. I allude, of\r\ncourse, to the bold, calm, dignified, undaunted and imperturbable\r\nnatural guardian of the Colonel's fold--Billy Goat!\r\n\r\nHe boasted of a beard longer, whiter, and more venerable than a\r\nhigh-priest in Masonry; his mane emulated that of the king of beasts;\r\nhis horns were as crooked, and almost as long, as the Cashie River, on\r\nwhose banks he was born; his tail might have been selected by some\r\nSpanish hidalgo, as a coat of arms, emblematic of the pride and hauteur\r\nof his family; whilst his _tout ensemble_ presented that dignity of\r\ndemeanor, majesty of carriage, consciousness of superior fortune, and\r\ndefiance of all danger, which we may imagine characterized the elder\r\nNapoleon previous to the battle of Waterloo. But our hero possessed\r\nmoral qualities quite equal to his personal traits. He was brave to a\r\nfault, combative to a miracle, and as invincible in battle as he was\r\nbelligerent in mood. The sight of a coat-tail invariably excited his\r\nanger, and a red handkerchief nearly distracted him with rage. Indeed,\r\nhe had recently grown so irascible that Colonel Averitt was compelled to\r\nkeep him shut up in the fowl-yard, a close prisoner, to protect him from\r\na justly indignant neighborhood.\r\n\r\nSuch was the champion that the Colonel now released and placed at the\r\nhead of the opposing forces. Saturday came at last, and the entire\r\nmorning was devoted to the construction of the proper number of wooden\r\nbits, twine bridle-reins, leather stirrups and pasteboard saddles. By\r\ntwelve o'clock everything was ready, and the order given to march. We\r\nwere disappointed in not finding the enemy at his accustomed haunt, and\r\nhad to prolong our march nearly half a mile before we came up with him.\r\nOur scouts, however, soon discovered him in an old field, lying encamped\r\nbeneath some young persimmon bushes, and entirely unconscious of\r\nimpending danger. We approached stealthily, according to our usual plan,\r\nand then at a concerted signal rushed headlong upon the foe. But we had\r\nno sooner given the alarm than our enemies sprang to their feet, and\r\nclustered about a central object, which we immediately recognized, to\r\nour chagrin and terror, as none other than Billy Goat himself.\r\n\r\nThe captain, however, was not to be daunted or foiled; he boldly made a\r\nplunge at the champion of our adversaries, and would have succeeded in\r\nseizing him by the horns, if he had not been unfortunately butted over\r\nbefore he could reach them. Two or three of our bravest comrades flew to\r\nhis assistance, but met with the same fate before they could rescue him\r\nfrom danger. The remainder of us drew off a short but prudent distance\r\nfrom the field of battle, to hold a council of war, and determine upon a\r\nplan of operations. In a few moments our wounded companions joined us,\r\nand entreated us to close at once upon the foe and surround him. They\r\ndeclared they were not afraid to beard the lion in his den, and that\r\nbeing butted heels over head two or three times but whetted their\r\ncourage, and incited them to deeds of loftier daring. Their eloquence,\r\nhowever, was more admired than their prudence, and a large majority of\r\nthe council decided that \"it was inopportune, without other munitions of\r\nwar than those we had upon the field, to risk a general engagement.\" It\r\nwas agreed, however, _nem. con._, that on the next Saturday we would\r\nprovide ourselves with ropes and fishing-poles, and such other arms as\r\nmight prove advantageous, and proceed to surround and noose our most\r\nformidable enemy, overpower him by the force of numbers, and take him\r\nprisoner at all hazards. Having fully determined upon this plan of\r\nattack, we hoisted our flag once more, ordered the drum to beat Yankee\r\nDoodle, and retreated in most excellent order from the field--our foe\r\nnot venturing to pursue us.\r\n\r\nThe week wore slowly and uneasily away. The clouds of war were gathering\r\nrapidly, and the low roll of distant thunder announced that a battle\r\nstorm of no ordinary importance was near at hand. Colonel Averitt, by\r\nsome traitorous trick of war, had heard of our former defeat, and\r\npublicly taunted our commander with his failure. Indeed, more than one\r\nof the villagers had heard of the disastrous result of the campaign, and\r\nsent impertinent messages to those who had been wounded in the\r\nencounter. Two or three of the young ladies, also, in the girls'\r\ndepartment, had been inoculated with the _fun_ (as it was absurdly\r\ndenominated), and a leather medal was pinned most provokingly to the\r\nshort jacket of the captain by one of those hoydenish Amazons.\r\n\r\nAll these events served to whet the courage of our men, and strange as\r\nit may appear, to embitter our hostility to our victorious foe. Some of\r\nthe officers proceeded so far as to threaten Colonel Averitt himself,\r\nand at one time, I am confident, he stood in almost as much danger as\r\nthe protector of his flock.\r\n\r\nSaturday came at last, and at the first blast of the bugle, we formed\r\ninto line, and advanced with great alacrity into the enemy's country.\r\nAfter marching half an hour, our scouts hastily returned, with the\r\ninformation that the enemy was drawn up, in full force, near the scene\r\nof the Persimmon bush battle. We advanced courageously to within\r\nspeaking distance, and then halted to breathe the troops and prepare for\r\nthe engagement. We surveyed our enemies with attention, but without\r\nalarm. There they stood right before us!\r\n\r\n    \"Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they form;\r\n     Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm!\"\r\n\r\nOur preparations were soon made, and at the command of the captain, we\r\nseparated into single files, one half making a _detour_ to the right,\r\nand the other to the left, so as to encircle the foe. Our instructions\r\nwere to spare all non-combatants, to pass by as unworthy of notice all\r\nminor foes, and to make a simultaneous rush upon the proud champion of\r\nour adversaries.\r\n\r\nBy this masterly manoeuvre it was supposed we should be enabled to\r\nescape unharmed, or at any rate without many serious casualties. But as\r\nit afterward appeared, we did not sufficiently estimate the strength and\r\nactivity of our enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter this preparatory manoeuvre had been successfully accomplished,\r\nour captain gave the order to \"charge!\" in a stentorian voice, and at\r\nthe same time rushed forward most gallantly at the head of the\r\nsquadron. The post of honor is generally the post of danger also, and so\r\nit proved on this occasion; for before the captain could grapple with\r\nthe foe, Billy Goat rose suddenly on his hinder legs, and uttering a\r\nloud note of defiance, dashed with lightning speed at the breast of our\r\ncommander, and at a single blow laid him prostrate on the field. Then\r\nwheeling quickly, ere any of his assailants could attack his rear flank,\r\nhe performed the same exploit upon the first and second lieutenants, and\r\nmade an unsuccessful pass at the standard-bearer, who eluded the danger\r\nby a scientific retreat. At this moment, when the fortunes of the day\r\nhung, as it were, on a single hair, our drummer, who enjoyed the\r\n_sobriquet_ of \"Weasel,\" advanced slowly but chivalrously upon the foe.\r\n\r\nAs the hosts of Israel and Gath paused upon the field of Elah, and\r\nawaited with fear and trembling the issue of the single-handed contest\r\nbetween David and Goliah; as Roman and Sabine stood back and reposed on\r\ntheir arms, whilst Horatio and Curiatii fought for the destiny of Rome\r\nand the mastery of the world, so the \"Woodville Cadets\" halted in their\r\ntracks on this memorable day, and all aghast with awe and admiration,\r\nwatched the progress of the terrible duello between \"Weasel,\" the\r\ndrummer boy, and Billy Goat, the hero of the battle of the Persimmon\r\nbush.\r\n\r\nThe drummer first disengaged himself from the incumbrance of his martial\r\nmusic, then threw his hat fiercely upon the ground, and warily and\r\ncircumspectly approached his foe. Nor was that foe unprepared, for\r\nrearing as usual on his nether extremities, he bleated out a long note\r\nof contempt and defiance, and dashed suddenly upon the \"Weasel.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of waiting to receive the force of the blow upon his breast or\r\nbrow, the drummer wheeled right-about face, and falling suddenly upon\r\nall fours with most surprising dexterity, presented a less vulnerable\r\npart of his body to his antagonist, who, being under full headway, was\r\ncompelled to accept the substituted buttress, and immediately planted\r\nthere a herculean thump. I need not say that the drummer was hurled many\r\nfeet heels over head, by this disastrous blow; but he had obtained the\r\nvery advantage he desired to secure, and springing upon his feet he\r\nleaped quicker than lightning upon the back of his foe, and in spite of\r\nevery effort to dislodge him, sat there in security and triumph!\r\n\r\nWith a loud huzza, the main body of the \"Cadets\" now rushed forward, and\r\nafter a feeble resistance, succeeded in overpowering the champion of our\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of precaution, we blindfolded him with several\r\nhandkerchiefs, and led him away in as much state as the Emperor Aurelian\r\ndisplayed when he carried Zenobia to Rome, a prisoner at his\r\nchariot-wheels.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the vanquished Billy Goat is soon related. A council of war\r\ndecided that he should be taken into a dense pine thicket, there\r\nsuspended head downwards, and thrashed _ad libitum_, by the whole army.\r\n\r\nThe sentence was carried into execution immediately; and though he was\r\ncut down and released after our vengeance was satisfied, I yet owe it to\r\ntruth and history to declare, that before a week elapsed, he died of a\r\nbroken heart, and was buried by Colonel Averitt with all the honors of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIf it be any satisfaction to the curious inquirer, I may add in\r\nconclusion, that the Rev. Mr. Craig avenged his _manes_, by wearing out\r\na chinquapin apiece on the backs of \"Weasel,\" the captain and officers,\r\nand immediately afterward disbanded the whole army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_FOR AN ALBUM._\r\n\r\n\r\n    When first our father, Adam, sinned\r\n      Against the will of Heaven,\r\n    And forth from Eden's happy gates\r\n      A wanderer was driven,\r\n    He paused beside a limpid brook,\r\n      That through the garden ran,\r\n    And, gazing in its mirrored wave,\r\n      Beheld himself--_a man_!\r\n\r\n    God's holy peace no longer beamed\r\n      In brightness from his eye;\r\n    But in its depths dark passions blazed,\r\n      Like lightnings in the sky.\r\n    Young Innocence no longer wreathed\r\n      His features with her smile;\r\n    But Sin sat there in scorched dismay,\r\n      Like some volcanic isle.\r\n\r\n    No longer radiant beauty shone\r\n      Upon his manly brow;\r\n    But care had traced deep furrows there,\r\n      With stern misfortune's plow.\r\n    Joy beamed no longer from his face;\r\n      His step was sad and slow;\r\n    His heart was heavy with its grief;\r\n      His bosom with its woe.\r\n\r\n    Whilst gazing at his altered form\r\n      Within the mirrored brook,\r\n    He spied an angel leaning o'er,\r\n      With pity in her look.\r\n    He turned, distrustful of his sight,\r\n      Unwilling to believe,\r\n    When, lo! in Heaven's own radiance smiled,\r\n      His sweet companion, Eve!\r\n\r\n    Fondly he clasped her to his heart,\r\n      And blissfully he cried,\r\n    \"What tho' I've lost a Paradise,\r\n      I've gained an angel bride!\r\n    No flowers in Eden ever bloomed,\r\n      No! not in heaven above,\r\n    Sweeter than woman brings to man--\r\n      Her friendship, truth, and love!\"\r\n\r\n    These buds were brought by Adam's bride,\r\n      Outside of Eden's gate,\r\n    And scattered o'er the world; _to them_\r\n      This book I dedicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_PHASES IN THE LIFE OF JOHN POLLEXFEN._\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nThere are but three persons now living who can truthfully answer the\r\nquestion, \"How did John Pollexfen, the photographer, make his fortune?\"\r\n\r\nNo confidence will be violated, now that he is dead, and his heirs\r\nresidents of a foreign country, if I relate the story of that singular\r\nman, whose rapid accumulation of wealth astonished the whole circle of\r\nhis acquaintance.\r\n\r\nReturning from the old man's funeral a few days since, the subject of\r\nPollexfen's discoveries became the topic of conversation; and my\r\ncompanions in the same carriage, aware that, as his attorney and\r\nconfidential friend, I knew more of the details of his business than any\r\none else, extorted from me a promise that at the first leisure moment I\r\nwould relate, in print, the secret of that curious invention by which\r\nthe photographic art was so largely enriched, and himself elevated at\r\nonce to the acme of opulence and renown.\r\n\r\nFew persons who were residents of the city of San Francisco at an early\r\nday, will fail to remember the site of the humble gallery in which\r\nPollexfen laid the foundations of his fame. It was situated on Merchant\r\nStreet, about midway between Kearny and Montgomery Streets, in an old\r\nwooden building; the ground being occupied at present by the solid brick\r\nstructure of Thomas R. Bolton. It fed the flames of the great May fire\r\nof 1851, was rebuilt, but again consumed in December, 1853. It was\r\nduring the fall of the latter year that the principal event took place\r\nwhich is to constitute the most prominent feature of my narrative.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the facts will be discredited by many, and doubted at\r\nfirst by all; but I beg to premise, at the outset, that because they are\r\nuncommon, by no means proves that they are untrue. Besides, should the\r\nquestion ever become a judicial one, I hold in my hands such _written\r\nproofs_, signed by the parties most deeply implicated, as will at once\r\nterminate both doubt and litigation. Of this, however, I have at present\r\nno apprehensions; for Lucile and her husband are both too honorable to\r\nassail the reputation of the dead, and too rich themselves to attempt to\r\npillage the living.\r\n\r\nAs it is my wish to be distinctly understood, and at the same time to be\r\nexculpated from all blame for the part I myself acted in the drama, the\r\nstory must commence with my first acquaintance with Mademoiselle Lucile\r\nMarmont.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1851, I embarked at New York for Panama, or rather\r\nChagres, on board the steamship \"Ohio,\" Captain Schenck, on my way to\r\nthe then distant coast of California, attracted hither by the universal\r\ndesire to accumulate a rapid fortune, and return at the earliest\r\npracticable period to my home, on the Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nThere were many hundred such passengers on the same ship. But little\r\nsociability prevailed, until after the steamer left Havana, where it was\r\nthen the custom to touch on the \"outward bound,\" to obtain a fresh\r\nsupply of fuel and provisions. We were detained longer than customary at\r\nHavana, and most of the passengers embraced the opportunity to visit\r\nthe Bishop's Garden and the tomb of Columbus.\r\n\r\nOne morning, somewhat earlier than usual, I was standing outside the\r\nrailing which incloses the monument of the great discoverer, and had\r\njust transcribed in my note-book the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n    \"O! Restos y Imagen\r\n       Del Grande Colon:\r\n     Mil siglos durad guardados\r\n       En lare Urna,\r\n     Y en la Remembranza\r\n       De Nuestra Nacion,\"\r\n\r\nwhen I was suddenly interrupted by a loud scream directly behind me. On\r\nturning, I beheld a young lady whom I had seen but once before on the\r\nsteamer, leaning over the prostrate form of an elderly female, and\r\napplying such restoratives as were at hand to resuscitate her, for she\r\nhad fainted. Seeing me, the daughter exclaimed, \"_Oh, Monsieur! y-a-t-il\r\nun medecin ici?_\" I hastened to the side of the mother, and was about to\r\nlift her from the pavement, when M. Marmont himself entered the\r\ncathedral. I assisted him in placing his wife in a _volante_ then\r\npassing, and she was safely conveyed to the hotel.\r\n\r\nHaving myself some knowledge of both French and Spanish, and able to\r\nconverse in either tongue, Lucile Marmont, then sixteen years of age,\r\nand I, from that time forward, became close and confidential friends.\r\n\r\nThe steamer sailed the next day, and in due time anchored off the\r\nroadstead of Chagres. But Mme. Marmont, in the last stages of\r\nconsumption when she embarked at New York, continued extremely ill until\r\nwe passed Point Concepcion, on this coast, when she suddenly expired\r\nfrom an attack of hemorrhage of the lungs.\r\n\r\nShe was buried at sea; and never can I forget the unutterable anguish of\r\npoor Lucile, as her mother's body splashed into the cold blue waters of\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, holding on to the railing, paler than monumental\r\nmarble, motionless as a statue, rigid as a corpse. The whole scene\r\naround her seemed unperceived. Her eyes gazed upon vacancy; her head was\r\nthrust slightly forward, and her disheveled tresses, black as Plutonian\r\nnight, fell neglected about her shoulders.\r\n\r\nCaptain Watkins, then commanding the \"Panama\"--whom, may God bless--wept\r\nlike a child; and his manly voice, that never quailed in the dread\r\npresence of the lightning or the hurricane, broke, chokingly, as he\r\nattempted to finish the burial rite, and died away in agitated sobs.\r\n\r\nOne by one the passengers left the spot, consecrated to the grief of\r\nthat only child--now more than orphaned by her irreparable loss. Lifting\r\nmy eyes, at last, none save the daughter and her father stood before me.\r\nCharmed to the spot was I, by a spell that seemed irresistible. Scarcely\r\nable to move a muscle, there I remained, speechless and overpowered.\r\nFinally the father spoke, and then Lucile fell headlong into his arms.\r\nHe bore her into his state-room, where the ship's surgeon was summoned,\r\nand where he continued his ministrations until we reached this port.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that I attended them ashore, and saw\r\nthem safely and commodiously lodged at the old Parker House, before I\r\nonce thought of my own accommodations.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and months, too, stole gradually away, before I saw\r\nanything more of the bereaved and mourning child. One day, however, as I\r\nwas lolling carelessly in my office, after business hours (and that\r\nmeant just at dark in those early times), Lucile hastily entered. I was\r\nstartled to see her; for upon her visage I thought I beheld the same\r\nstolid spell of agony that some months before had transfixed my very\r\nsoul. Before I had time to recover myself, or ask her to be seated, she\r\napproached closer, and said in a half whisper, \"Oh, sir, come with me\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nOn our way she explained that her father was lying dangerously ill, and\r\nthat she knew no physician to whom she could apply, and in whose skill\r\nshe could place confidence. I at once recommended Dr. H. M. White (since\r\ndead), well knowing not only his great success, but equally cognizant of\r\nthat universal charity that rendered him afterwards no less beloved than\r\nillustrious. Without a moment's hesitation, the Doctor seized his hat,\r\nand hastened along with us, to the wretched abode of the sick, and, as\r\nit afterwards proved, the palsied father. The disease was pronounced\r\napoplexy, and recovery doubtful. Still, there was hope. Whilst we were\r\nseated around the bedside, a tall, emaciated, feeble, but very handsome\r\nyoung man entered, and staggered to a seat. He was coarsely and meanly\r\nclad; but there was something about him that not only betokened the\r\ngentleman, but the well-bred and accomplished scholar. As he seated\r\nhimself, he exchanged a glance with Lucile, and in that silent look I\r\nread the future history of both their lives. On lifting my eyes toward\r\nhers, the pallor fled for an instant from her cheek, and a traitor blush\r\nflashed its crimson confession across her features.\r\n\r\nThe patient was copiously bled from an artery in the temple, and\r\ngradually recovered his consciousness, but on attempting to speak we\r\nascertained that partial paralysis had resulted from the fit.\r\n\r\nAs I rose, with the Doctor, to leave, Lucile beckoned me to remain, and\r\napproaching me more closely, whispered in French, \"Stay, and I will tell\r\nyou all.\" The main points of her story, though deeply interesting to me,\r\nat that time, were so greatly eclipsed by subsequent events, that they\r\nare scarcely worthy of narration. Indeed, I shall not attempt to detail\r\nthem here fully, but will content myself with stating, in few words,\r\nonly such events as bear directly upon the fortunes of John Pollexfen.\r\n\r\nAs intimated above, Lucile was an only child. She was born in Dauphiny,\r\na province of France, and immigrated to America during the disastrous\r\nyear 1848. Her father was exiled, and his estates seized by the officers\r\nof the government, on account of his political tenets. The family\r\nembarked at Marseilles, with just sufficient ready money to pay their\r\npassage to New York, and support them for a few months after their\r\narrival. It soon became apparent that want, and perhaps starvation, were\r\nin store, unless some means of obtaining a livelihood could be devised.\r\nThe sole expedient was music, of which M. Marmont was a proficient, and\r\nto this resource he at once applied himself most industriously. He had\r\naccumulated a sufficient sum to pay his expenses to this coast, up to\r\nthe beginning of 1851, and took passage for San Francisco, as we have\r\nalready seen, in the spring of that year.\r\n\r\nReaching here, he became more embarrassed every day, unacquainted as he\r\nwas with the language, and still less with the wild life into which he\r\nwas so suddenly plunged. Whilst poverty was pinching his body, grief for\r\nthe loss of his wife was torturing his soul. Silent, sad, almost morose\r\nto others, his only delight was in his child. Apprehensions for her\r\nfate, in case of accident to himself, embittered his existence, and\r\nhastened the catastrophe above related. Desirous of placing her in a\r\nsituation in which she could earn a livelihood, independent of his own\r\nprecarious exertions, he taught her drawing and painting, and had just\r\nsucceeded in obtaining for her the employment of coloring photographs at\r\nPollexfen's gallery the very day he was seized with his fatal disorder.\r\n\r\nSome weeks previous to this, Charles Courtland, the young man before\r\nmentioned, became an inmate of his house under the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\nOne evening, after the performances at the Jenny Lind Theatre (where M.\r\nMarmont was employed) were over, and consequently very late, whilst he\r\nwas pursuing his lonely way homewards he accidentally stumbled over an\r\nimpediment in his path. He at once recognized it as a human body, and\r\nbeing near home, he lifted the senseless form into his house. A severe\r\ncontusion behind the ear had been the cause of the young man's\r\nmisfortune, and his robbery had been successfully accomplished whilst\r\nlying in a state of insensibility.\r\n\r\nHis recovery was extremely slow, and though watched by the brightest\r\npair of eyes that ever shot their dangerous glances into a human soul,\r\nCourtland had not fully recovered his strength up to the time that I\r\nmade his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nHe was a Virginian by birth; had spent two years in the mines on Feather\r\nRiver, and having accumulated a considerable sum of money, came to San\r\nFrancisco to purchase a small stock of goods, with which he intended to\r\nopen a store at Bidwell's Bar. His robbery frustrated all these golden\r\ndreams, and his capture by Lucile Marmont completed his financial ruin.\r\n\r\nHere terminates the first phase in the history of John Pollexfen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\"Useless! useless! all useless!\" exclaimed John Pollexfen, as he dashed\r\na glass negative, which he had most elaborately prepared, into the\r\nslop-bucket. \"Go, sleep with your predecessors.\" After a moment's\r\nsilence, he again spoke: \"But I know _it exists_. Nature has the secret\r\nlocked up securely, as she thinks, but I'll tear it from her. Doesn't\r\nthe eye see? Is not the retina impressible to the faintest gleam of\r\nlight? What telegraphs to my soul the colors of the rainbow? Nothing but\r\nthe eye, the human eye. And shall John Pollexfen be told, after he has\r\nlived half a century, that the compacted humors of this little organ can\r\ndo more than his whole laboratory? By heaven! I'll wrest the secret from\r\nthe labyrinth of nature, or pluck my own eyes from their sockets.\"\r\n\r\nThus soliloquized John Pollexfen, a few days after the events narrated\r\nin the last chapter.\r\n\r\nHe was seated at a table, in a darkened chamber, with a light burning,\r\nthough in the middle of the day, and his countenance bore an\r\nunmistakable expression of disappointment, mingled with disgust, at the\r\nfailure of his last experiment. He was evidently in an ill-humor, and\r\nseemed puzzled what to do next. Just then a light tap came at the door,\r\nand in reply to an invitation to enter, the pale, delicate features of\r\nLucile Marmont appeared at the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! is it you, my child?\" said the photographer, rising. \"Let me see\r\nyour touches.\" After surveying the painted photographs a moment, he\r\nbroke out into a sort of artistic glee: \"Beautiful! beautiful! an adept,\r\nquite an adept! Who taught you? Come, have no secrets from me; I'm an\r\nold man, and may be of service to you yet. What city artist gave you the\r\ncue?\"\r\n\r\nBefore relating any more of the conversation, it becomes necessary to\r\npaint John Pollexfen as he was. Methinks I can see his tall, rawboned,\r\nangular form before me, even now, as I write these lines. There he\r\nstands, Scotch all over, from head to foot. It was whispered about in\r\nearly times--for really no one knew much about his previous career--that\r\nJohn Pollexfen had been a famous sea captain; that he had sailed around\r\nthe world many times; had visited the coast of Africa under suspicious\r\ncircumstances, and finally found his way to California from the then\r\nunpopular region of Australia. Without pausing to trace these rumors\r\nfurther, it must be admitted that there was something in the appearance\r\nof the man sufficiently repulsive, at first sight, to give them\r\ncurrency. He had a large bushy head, profusely furnished with hair\r\nalmost brickdust in color, and growing down upon a broad, low forehead,\r\nindicative of great mathematical and constructive power. His brows were\r\nlong and shaggy, and overhung a restless, deep-set, cold, gray eye, that\r\nmet the fiercest glance unquailingly, and seemed possessed of that\r\nmagnetic power which dazzles, reads and confounds whatsoever it looks\r\nupon. There was no escape from its inquisitive glitter. It sounded the\r\nvery depths of the soul it thought proper to search. Whilst gazing at\r\nyou, instinct felt the glance before your own eye was lifted so as to\r\nencounter his. There was no human weakness in its expression. It was as\r\npitiless as the gleam of the lightning. But you felt no less that high\r\nintelligence flashed from its depths. Courage, you knew, was there; and\r\ntrue bravery is akin to all the nobler virtues. This man, you at once\r\nsaid, may be cold, but it is impossible for him to be unjust, deceitful\r\nor ungenerous. He might, like Shylock, insist on a _right_, no matter\r\nhow vindictive, but he would never forge a claim, no matter how\r\ninsignificant. He might crush, like Cæsar, but he could never plot like\r\nCatiline. In addition to all this, it required but slight knowledge of\r\nphysiognomy to perceive that his stern nature was tinctured with genuine\r\nenthusiasm. Earnestness beamed forth in every feature. His soul was as\r\nsincere as it was unbending. He could not trifle, even with the most\r\ninconsiderable subject. Laughter he abhorred. He could smile, but there\r\nwas little contagion in his pleasantry. It surprised more than it\r\npleased you. Blended with this deep, scrutinizing, earnest and\r\nenthusiastic nature, there was an indefinable something, shading the\r\nwhole character--it might have been early sorrow, or loss of fortune, or\r\nbaffled ambition, or unrequited love. Still, it shone forth patent to\r\nthe experienced eye, enigmatical, mysterious, sombre. There was danger,\r\nalso, in it, and many, who knew him best, attributed his eccentricity to\r\na softened phase of insanity.\r\n\r\nBut the most marked practical trait of Pollexfen's character was his\r\nenthusiasm for his art. He studied its history, from the humble hints of\r\nNiépce to the glorious triumphs of Farquer, Bingham, and Bradley, with\r\nall the soul-engrossing fidelity of a child, and spent many a midnight\r\nhour in striving to rival or surpass them. It was always a subject of\r\nastonishment with me, until after his death, how it happened that a\r\nrough, athletic seaman, as people declared he was originally, should\r\nbecome so intensely absorbed in a science requiring delicacy of taste,\r\nand skill in manipulation rather than power of muscle, in its practical\r\napplication. But after carefully examining the papers tied up in the\r\nsame package with his last will and testament, I ceased to wonder, and\r\nsought no further for an explanation.\r\n\r\nMost prominent amongst these carefully preserved documents was an old\r\ndiploma, granted by the University of Edinburgh, in the year 1821, to\r\n\"John Pollexfen, Gent., of Hallicardin, Perthshire,\" constituting him\r\nDoctor of Medicine. On the back of the diploma, written in a round,\r\nclear hand, I found indorsed as follows:\r\n\r\n   Fifteen years of my life have I lost by professing modern\r\n   quackery. Medicine is not a science, properly so called. It is at\r\n   most but an art. He best succeeds who creates his own system.\r\n   Each generation adopts its peculiar manual: Sangrado to-day;\r\n   Thomson to-morrow; Hahnemann the day after. Surgery advances;\r\n   physic is stationary. But chemistry, glorious chemistry, is a\r\n   science. Born amid dissolving ruins, and cradled upon rollers of\r\n   fire, her step is onward. At her side, as an humble menial,\r\n   henceforth shall be found\r\n\r\n                                                JOHN POLLEXFEN.\r\n\r\nThe indorsement bore no date, but it must have been written long before\r\nhis immigration to California.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed with the interview between the photographer and his\r\nemployee. Repeating the question quickly, \"Who gave you the cue?\"\r\ndemanded Pollexfen.\r\n\r\n\"My father taught me drawing and painting, but my own taste suggested\r\nthe coloring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me, really, that you taught yourself, Mlle.\r\nMarmont?\" and as he said this, the cold, gray eye lit up with unwonted\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\n\"What I say is true,\" replied the girl, and elevating her own lustrous\r\neyes, they encountered his own, with a glance quite as steady.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go into the sunlight, and examine the tints more fully;\" and\r\nleading the way they emerged into the sitting-room where customers were\r\nin the habit of awaiting the artist's pleasure.\r\n\r\nHere the pictures were again closely scrutinized, but far more\r\naccurately than before; and after fully satisfying his curiosity on the\r\nscore of the originality of the penciling, approached Lucile very\r\nclosely, and darting his wonderful glance into the depths of her own\r\neyes, said, after a moment's pause, \"You have glorious eyes.\"\r\n\r\nLucile was about to protest, in a hurried way, against such adulation,\r\nwhen he continued: \"Nay, nay, do not deny it. Your eyes are the most\r\nfathomless orbs that ever I beheld--large, too, and lustrous--the very\r\neyes I have been searching for these five years past. A judge of color;\r\na rare judge of color! How is your father to-day, my child?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of voice in which this last remark was made had in it more of\r\nthe curious than the tender. It seemed to have been propounded more as a\r\nmatter of business than of feeling. Still, Lucile replied respectfully,\r\n\"Oh! worse, sir; a great deal worse. Doctor White declares that it is\r\nimpossible for him to recover, and that he cannot live much longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not live?\" replied Pollexfen, \"not live?\" Then, as if musing, he\r\nsolemnly added, \"When your father is dead, Lucile, come to me, and I\r\nwill make your fortune. That is, if you follow my advice, and place\r\nyourself exclusively under my instructions. Nay, but you shall earn it\r\nyourself. See!\" he exclaimed, and producing a bank deposit-book from his\r\npocket, \"See! here have I seven thousand five hundred dollars in bank,\r\nand I would gladly exchange it for one of your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAstonishment overwhelmed the girl, and she could make no immediate\r\nreply; and before she had sufficiently recovered her self-possession to\r\nspeak, the photographer hastily added, \"Don't wonder; farewell, now.\r\nRemember what I have said--seven thousand five hundred dollars just for\r\none eye!\"\r\n\r\nLucile was glad to escape, without uttering a syllable. Pursuing her way\r\nhomewards, she pondered deeply over the singular remark with which\r\nPollexfen closed the conversation, and half muttering, said to herself,\r\n\"Can he be in earnest? or is it simply the odd way in which an eccentric\r\nman pays a compliment?\" But long before she could solve the enigma,\r\nother thoughts, far more engrossing, took sole possession of her mind.\r\n\r\nShe fully realized her situation--a dying father, and a sick lover, both\r\ndependent in a great measure upon her exertions, and she herself not yet\r\npast her seventeenth year.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home she found the door wide open, and Courtland standing in\r\nthe entrance, evidently awaiting her arrival. As she approached, their\r\neyes met, and a glance told her that all was over.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" softly whispered Courtland.\r\n\r\nA stifled sob was all that broke from the lips of the child, as she fell\r\nlifeless into the arms of her lover.\r\n\r\nI pass over the mournful circumstances attending the funeral of the\r\nexiled Frenchman. He was borne to his grave by a select few of his\r\ncountrymen, whose acquaintance he had made during his short residence in\r\nthis city. Like thousands of others, who have perished in our midst, he\r\ndied, and \"left no sign.\" The newspapers published the item the next\r\nmorning, and before the sun had set upon his funeral rites the poor man\r\nwas forgotten by all except the immediate persons connected with this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nTo one of them, at least, his death was not only an important event, but\r\nit formed a great epoch in her history.\r\n\r\nLucile was transformed, in a moment of time, from a helpless, confiding,\r\naffectionate girl, into a full-grown, self-dependent, imperious woman.\r\nSuch revolutions, I know, are rare in everyday life, and but seldom\r\noccur; in fact, they never happen except in those rare instances where\r\nnature has stamped a character with the elements of inborn originality\r\nand force, which accident, or sudden revulsion, develops at once into\r\nfull maturity. To such a soul, death of an only parent operates like the\r\nsummer solstice upon the whiter snow of Siberia. It melts away the\r\nweakness and credulity of childhood almost miraculously, and exhibits,\r\nwith the suddenness of an apparition, the secret and hitherto unknown\r\ntraits that will forever afterwards distinguish the individual. The\r\nexplanation of this curious moral phenomenon consists simply in bringing\r\nto the surface what already was in existence below; not in the\r\ninstantaneous creation of new elements of character. The tissues were\r\nalready there; circumstance hardens them into bone. Thus we sometimes\r\nbehold the same marvel produced by the marriage of some characterless\r\ngirl, whom we perhaps had known from infancy, and whose individuality we\r\nhad associated with cake, or crinoline--a gay humming-bird of social\r\nlife, so light and frivolous and unstable, that, as she flitted across\r\nour pathway, we scarcely deigned her the compliment of a thought. Yet a\r\nweek or a month after her nuptials, we meet the self-same warbler, not\r\nas of old, beneath the paternal roof, but under her own \"vine and\r\nfig-tree,\" and in astonishment we ask ourselves, \"Can this be the\r\nbread-and-butter Miss we passed by with the insolence of a sneer, a\r\nshort time ago?\" Behold her now! On her brow sits womanhood. Upon her\r\nfeatures beam out palpably traits of great force and originality. She\r\nmoves with the majesty of a queen, and astounds us by taking a leading\r\npart in the discussion of questions of which we did not deem she ever\r\ndreamed. What a transformation is here! Has nature proven false to\r\nherself? Is this a miracle? Are all her laws suspended, that she might\r\ntransform, in an instant, a puling trifler into a perfect woman? Not so,\r\noh! doubter. Not nature is false, but you are yourself ignorant of her\r\nlaws. Study Shakspeare; see Gloster woo, and win, the defiant,\r\nrevengeful and embittered Lady Anne, and confess in your humility that\r\nit is far more probable that you should err, than that Shakspeare should\r\nbe mistaken.\r\n\r\nNot many days after the death of M. Marmont, it was agreed by all the\r\nfriends of Lucile, that the kind offer extended to her by Pollexfen\r\nshould be accepted, and that she should become domiciliated in his\r\nhousehold. He was unmarried, it is true, but still he kept up an\r\nestablishment. His housekeeper was a dear old lady, Scotch, like her\r\nmaster, but a direct contrast in every trait of her character. Her\r\nduties were not many, nor burdensome. Her time was chiefly occupied in\r\nfamily matters--cooking, washing, and feeding the pets--so that it was\r\nbut seldom she made her appearance in any other apartment than those\r\nentirely beneath her own supervision.\r\n\r\nThe photographer had an assistant in his business, a Chinaman; and upon\r\nhim devolved the task of caring for the outer offices.\r\n\r\nCourtland, with a small stock of money, and still smaller modicum of\r\nhealth, left at once for Bidwell's Bar, where he thought of trying his\r\nfortune once more at mining, and where he was well and most cordially\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nIt now only remained to accompany Lucile to her new home, to see her\r\nsafely ensconced in her new quarters, to speak a flattering word in her\r\nfavor to Pollexfen, and then, to bid her farewell, perhaps forever. All\r\nthis was duly accomplished, and with good-bye on my lips, and a\r\nsorrowful sympathy in my heart, I turned away from the closing door of\r\nthe photographer, and wended my way homewards.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Marmont was met at the threshold by Martha McClintock, the\r\nhousekeeper, and ushered at once into the inner apartment, situated in\r\nthe rear of the gallery.\r\n\r\nAfter removing her veil and cloak, she threw herself into an arm-chair,\r\nand shading her eyes with both her hands, fell into a deep reverie. She\r\nhad been in that attitude but a few moments, when a large Maltese cat\r\nleaped boldly into her lap, and began to court familiarity by purring\r\nand playing, as with an old acquaintance. Lucile cast a casual glance at\r\nthe animal, and noticed immediately that it had but _one eye_!\r\nExpressing no astonishment, but feeling a great deal, she cast her eyes\r\ncautiously around the apartment.\r\n\r\nNear the window hung a large tin cage, containing a blue African parrot,\r\nwith crimson-tipped shoulders and tail. At the foot of the sofa, a\r\nsilken-haired spaniel was quietly sleeping, whilst, outside the window,\r\na bright little canary was making the air melodious with its happy\r\nwarbling. A noise in an adjoining room aroused the dog, and set it\r\nbarking. As it lifted its glossy ears and turned its graceful head\r\ntoward Lucile, her surprise was enhanced in the greatest degree, by\r\nperceiving that it, too, had lost an eye. Rising, she approached the\r\nwindow, impelled by a curiosity that seemed irresistible. Peering into\r\nthe cage, she coaxed the lazy parrot to look at her, and her amazement\r\nwas boundless when she observed that the poor bird was marred in the\r\nsame mournful manner. Martha witnessed her astonishment, and indulged\r\nin a low laugh, but said nothing. At this moment Pollexfen himself\r\nentered the apartment, and with his appearance must terminate the second\r\nphase of his history.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n\"Come and sit by me, Mademoiselle Marmont,\" said Pollexfen, advancing at\r\nthe same time to the sofa, and politely making way for the young lady,\r\nwho followed almost mechanically. \"You must not believe me as bad as I\r\nmay seem at first sight, for we all have redeeming qualities, if the\r\nworld would do us the justice to seek for them as industriously as for\r\nour faults.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very well able to believe that,\" replied Lucile, \"for my dear\r\nfather instructed me to act upon the maxim, that good predominates over\r\nevil, even in this life; and I feel sure that I need fear no harm\r\nbeneath the roof of the only real benefactor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! we will not bandy compliments at our first sitting; they are the\r\nprelude amongst men, to hypocrisy first, and wrong afterwards. May I so\r\nfar transgress the rules of common politeness as to ask your age? Not\r\nfrom idle curiosity, I can assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"At my next birthday,\" said Lucile, \"I shall attain the age of seventeen\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when may that be?\" pursued her interlocutor. \"I had hoped you were\r\nolder, by a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"My birthday is the 18th of November, and really, sir, I am curious to\r\nknow why you feel any disappointment that I am not older.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! nothing of any great consequence; only this, that by the laws of\r\nCalifornia, on reaching the age of eighteen you become the sole mistress\r\nof yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I greatly fear,\" timidly added the girl, \"that I shall have to\r\nanticipate the law, and assume that responsibility at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can only contract through a guardian before that era in your\r\nlife; and in the agreement _between us, that is to be_, no third person\r\nshall intermeddle. But we will not now speak of that. You must consider\r\nyourself my equal here; there must be no secrets to hide from each\r\nother; no suspicions engendered. We are both artists. Confidence is the\r\nonly path to mutual improvement. My business is large, but my ambition\r\nto excel greater, far. Listen to me, child!\" and suddenly rising, so as\r\nto confront Lucile, he darted one of those magnetic glances into the\r\nvery fortress of her soul, which we have before attempted to describe,\r\nand added, in an altered tone of voice, \"The sun's raybrush paints the\r\nrainbow upon the evanescent cloud, and photographs an iris in the skies.\r\nThe human eye catches the picture ere it fades, and transfers it with\r\nall its beauteous tints to that prepared albumen, the retina. The soul\r\nsees it there, and rejoices at the splendid spectacle. Shall insensate\r\nnature outpaint the godlike mind? Can she leave her brightest colors on\r\nthe dark _collodion_ of a thunder-cloud, and I not transfer the blush of\r\na rose, or the vermilion of a dahlia, to my _Rivi_ or _Saxe_? No! no!\r\nI'll not believe it. Let us work together, girl; we'll lead the age we\r\nlive in. My name shall rival Titian's, and you shall yet see me snatch\r\nthe colors of the dying dolphin from decay, and bid them live forever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he turned with a suddenness that startled his pupil, and\r\nstrode hastily out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed, as Lucile had been from her very birth, to brusque\r\nmanners, like those of the photographer, their grotesqueness impressed\r\nher with an indefinable relish for such awkward sincerity, and whetted\r\nher appetite to see more of the man whose enthusiasm always got the\r\nbetter of his politeness.\r\n\r\n\"He is no Frenchman,\" thought the girl, \"but I like him none the less.\r\nHe has been very, very kind to me, and I am at this moment dependent\r\nupon him for my daily bread.\" Then, changing the direction of her\r\nthoughts, they recurred to the subject-matter of Pollexfen's discourse.\r\n\"Here,\" thought she, \"lies the clue to the labyrinth. If insane, his\r\nmadness is a noble one; for he would link his name with the progress of\r\nhis art. He seeks to do away with the necessity of such poor creatures\r\nas myself, as adjuncts to photography. Nature, he thinks, should lay on\r\nthe coloring, not man--the Sun himself should paint, not the human\r\nhand.\" And with these, and kindred thoughts, she opened her escritoire,\r\nand taking out her pencils sat down to the performance of her daily\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nOh, blessed curse of Adam's posterity, healthful toil, all hail!\r\nOffspring of sin and shame--still heaven's best gift to man. Oh,\r\nwondrous miracle of Providence! divinest alchemy of celestial science!\r\nby which the chastisement of the progenitor transforms itself into a\r\npriceless blessing upon the offspring! None but God himself could\r\ntransmute the sweat of the face into a panacea for the soul. How many\r\nmyriads have been cured by toil of the heart's sickness and the body's\r\ninfirmities! The clink of the hammer drowns, in its music, the\r\nlamentations of pain and the sighs of sorrow. Even the distinctions of\r\nrank and wealth and talents are all forgotten, and the inequalities of\r\nstepdame Fortune all forgiven, whilst the busy whirls of industry are\r\nbearing us onward to our goal. No condition in life is so much to be\r\nenvied as his who is too busy to indulge in reverie. Health is his\r\ncompanion, happiness his friend. Ills flee from his presence as\r\nnight-birds from the streaking of the dawn. Pale Melancholy, and her\r\nsister Insanity, never invade his dominions; for Mirth stands sentinel\r\nat the border, and Innocence commands the garrison of his soul.\r\n\r\nHenceforth let no man war against fate whose lot has been cast in that\r\nhappy medium, equidistant from the lethargic indolence of superabundant\r\nwealth, and the abject paralysis of straitened poverty. Let them toil\r\non, and remember that God is a worker, and strews infinity with\r\nrevolving worlds! Should he forget, in a moment of grief or triumph, of\r\ngladness or desolation, that being born to toil, in labor only shall he\r\nfind contentment, let him ask of the rivers why they never rest, of the\r\nsunbeams why they never pause. Yea, of the great globe itself, why it\r\ntravels on forever in the golden pathway of the ecliptic, and nature,\r\nfrom her thousand voices, will respond: Motion is life, inertia is\r\ndeath; action is health, stagnation is sickness; toil is glory, torpor\r\nis disgrace!\r\n\r\nI cannot say that thoughts as profound as these found their way into the\r\nmind of Lucile, as she plied her task, but nature vindicated her own\r\nlaws in her case, as she will always do, if left entirely to herself.\r\n\r\nAs day after day and week after week rolled by, a softened sorrow, akin\r\nonly to grief--\r\n\r\n    \"As the mist resembles the rain\"--\r\n\r\ntook the place of the poignant woe which had overwhelmed her at first,\r\nand time laid a gentle hand upon her afflictions. Gradually, too, she\r\nbecame attached to her art, and made such rapid strides towards\r\nproficiency that Pollexfen ceased, finally, to give any instruction, or\r\noffer any hints as to the manner in which she ought to paint. Thus her\r\nown taste became her only guide; and before six months had elapsed after\r\nthe death of her father, the pictures of Pollexfen became celebrated\r\nthroughout the city and state, for the correctness of their coloring and\r\nthe extraordinary delicacy of their finish. His gallery was daily\r\nthronged with the wealth, beauty and fashion of the great metropolis,\r\nand the hue of his business assumed the coloring of success.\r\n\r\nBut his soul was the slave of a single thought. Turmoil brooded there,\r\nlike darkness over chaos ere the light pierced the deep profound.\r\n\r\nDuring the six months which we have just said had elapsed since the\r\ndomiciliation of Mlle. Marmont beneath his roof, he had had many long\r\nand perfectly frank conversations with her, upon the subject which most\r\ndeeply interested him. She had completely fathomed his secret, and by\r\ndegrees had learned to sympathize with him, in his search into the\r\nhidden mysteries of photographic science. She even became the frequent\r\ncompanion of his chemical experiments, and night after night attended\r\nhim in his laboratory, when the lazy world around them was buried in the\r\nprofoundest repose.\r\n\r\nStill, there was one subject which, hitherto, he had not broached, and\r\nthat was the one in which she felt all a woman's curiosity--_the offer\r\nto purchase an eye_. She had long since ascertained the story of the\r\none-eyed pets in the parlor, and had not only ceased to wonder, but was\r\nmentally conscious of having forgiven Pollexfen, in her own enthusiasm\r\nfor art.\r\n\r\nFinally, a whole year elapsed since the death of her father, and no\r\nextraordinary change took place in the relations of the master and his\r\npupil. True, each day their intercourse became more unrestrained, and\r\ntheir art-association more intimate. But this intimacy was not the tie\r\nof personal friendship or individual esteem. It began in the laboratory,\r\nand there it ended. Pollexfen had no soul except for his art; no love\r\noutside of his profession. Money he seemed to care for but little,\r\nexcept as a means of supplying his acids, salts and plates. He\r\nrigorously tested every metal, in its iodides and bromides;\r\nindustriously coated his plates with every substance that could be\r\nalbumenized, and plunged his negatives into baths of every mineral that\r\ncould be reduced to the form of a vapor. His activity was prodigious;\r\nhis ingenuity exhaustless, his industry absolutely boundless. He was as\r\nfamiliar with chemistry as he was with the outlines of the geography of\r\nScotland. Every headland, spring and promontory of that science he knew\r\nby heart. The most delicate experiments he performed with ease, and the\r\ngreatest rapidity. Nature seemed to have endowed him with a native\r\naptitude for analysis. His love was as profound as it was ready; in\r\nfact, if there was anything he detested more than loud laughter, it was\r\nsuperficiality. He instinctively pierced at once to the roots and\r\nsources of things; and never rested, after seeing an effect, until he\r\ngroped his way back to the cause. \"Never stand still,\" he would often\r\nsay to his pupil, \"where the ground is boggy. Reach the rock before you\r\nrest.\" This maxim was the great index to his character; the key to all\r\nhis researches.\r\n\r\nTime fled so rapidly and to Lucile so pleasantly, too, that she had\r\nreached the very verge of her legal maturity before she once deigned to\r\nbestow a thought upon what change, if any, her eighteenth birthday would\r\nbring about. A few days preceding her accession to majority, a large\r\npackage of letters from France, _via_ New York, arrived, directed to M.\r\nMarmont himself, and evidently written without a knowledge of his death.\r\nThe bundle came to my care, and I hastened at once to deliver it,\r\npersonally, to the blooming and really beautiful Lucile. I had not seen\r\nher for many months, and was surprised to find so great an improvement\r\nin her health and appearance. Her manners were more marked, her\r\nconversation more rapid and decided, and the general contour of her form\r\nfar more womanly. It required only a moment's interview to convince me\r\nthat she possessed unquestioned talent of a high order, and a spirit as\r\nimperious as a queen's. Those famous eyes of hers, that had, nearly two\r\nyears before, attracted in such a remarkable manner the attention of\r\nPollexfen, had not failed in the least; on the contrary, time had\r\nintensified their power, and given them a depth of meaning and a\r\ndazzling brilliancy that rendered them almost insufferably bright. It\r\nseemed to me that contact with the magnetic gaze of the photographer had\r\nlent them something of his own expression, and I confess that when my\r\neye met hers fully and steadily, mine was always the first to droop.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she was in full correspondence with her lover, I asked\r\nafter Courtland, and she finally told me all she knew. He was still\r\nsuffering from the effect of the assassin's blow, and very recently had\r\nbeen attacked by inflammatory rheumatism. His health seemed permanently\r\nimpaired, and Lucile wept bitterly as she spoke of the poverty in which\r\nthey were both plunged, and which prevented him from essaying the only\r\nremedy that promised a radical cure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed she, \"were it only in our power to visit _La belle\r\nFrance_, to bask in the sunshine of Dauphiny, to sport amid the lakes of\r\nthe Alps, to repose beneath the elms of Chálons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said I, \"the very letters now unopened in your hands may\r\ninvite you back to the scenes of your childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no,\" she rejoined, \"I recognize the handwriting of my widowed\r\naunt, and I tremble to break the seal.\"\r\n\r\nRising shortly afterwards, I bade her a sorrowful farewell.\r\n\r\nLucile sought her private apartment before she ventured to unseal the\r\ndispatches. Many of the letters were old, and had been floating between\r\nNew York and Havre for more than a twelvemonth. One was of recent date,\r\nand that was the first one perused by the niece. Below is a free\r\ntranslation of its contents. It bore date at \"Bordeaux, July 12, 1853,\"\r\nand ran thus:\r\n\r\n   EVER DEAR AND BELOVED BROTHER:\r\n\r\n   Why have we never heard from you since the beginning of 1851?\r\n   Alas! I fear some terrible misfortune has overtaken you, and\r\n   overwhelmed your whole family. Many times have I written during\r\n   that long period, and prayed, oh! so promptly, that God would\r\n   take you, and yours, in His holy keeping. And then our dear\r\n   Lucile! Ah! what a life must be in store for her, in that wild\r\n   and distant land! Beg of her to return to France; and do not\r\n   fail, also, to come yourself. We have a new Emperor, as you must\r\n   long since have learned, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, nephew\r\n   of the great Napoleon. Your reactionist principles against\r\n   Cavaignac and his colleagues, can be of no disservice to you at\r\n   present. Napoleon is lenient. He has even recalled Louis Blanc.\r\n   Come, and apply for restitution of the old estates; come, and be\r\n   a protector of my seven orphans, now, alas! suffering even for\r\n   the common necessaries of life. Need a fond sister say more to\r\n   her only living brother?\r\n\r\n                         Thine, as in childhood,\r\n\r\n                                                       ANNETTE.\r\n\r\n\"Misfortunes pour like a pitiless winter storm upon my devoted head,\"\r\nthought Lucile, as she replaced the letter in its envelope. \"Parents\r\ndead; aunt broken-hearted; cousins starving, and I not able to afford\r\nrelief. I cannot even moisten their sorrows with a tear. I would weep,\r\nbut rebellion against fate rises in my soul, and dries up the fountain\r\nof tears. Had Heaven made me a man it would not have been thus. I have\r\nsomething here,\" she exclaimed, rising from her seat and placing her\r\nhand upon her forehead, \"that tells me I could do and dare, and endure.\"\r\n\r\nHer further soliloquy was here interrupted by a distinct rap at her\r\ndoor, and on pronouncing the word \"enter,\" Pollexfen, for the first time\r\nsince she became a member of his family, strode heavily into her\r\nchamber. Lucile did not scream, or protest, or manifest either surprise\r\nor displeasure at this unwonted and uninvited visit. She politely\r\npointed to a seat, and the photographer, without apology or hesitation,\r\nseized the chair, and moving it so closely to her own that they came in\r\ncontact, seated himself without uttering a syllable. Then, drawing a\r\ndocument from his breast pocket, which was folded formally, and sealed\r\nwith two seals, but subscribed only with one name, he proceeded to read\r\nit from beginning to end, in a slow, distinct, and unfaltering tone.\r\n\r\nI have the document before me, as I write, and I here insert a full and\r\ncorrect copy. It bore date just one month subsequent to the time of the\r\ninterview, and was intended, doubtless, to afford his pupil full\r\nopportunity for consultation before requesting her signature:\r\n\r\n\r\n   |=This Indenture=|, Made this nineteenth day of November, A. D.\r\n   1853, by John Pollexfen, photographer, of the first part, and\r\n   Lucile Marmont, artiste, of the second part, both of the city of\r\n   San Francisco, and State of California, WITNESSETH:\r\n\r\n   WHEREAS, the party of the first part is desirous of obtaining a\r\n   living, sentient, human eye, of perfect organism, and\r\n   unquestioned strength, for the sole purpose of chemical analysis\r\n   and experiment in the lawful prosecution of his studies as\r\n   photograph chemist. AND WHEREAS, the party of the second part can\r\n   supply the desideratum aforesaid. AND WHEREAS FURTHER, the first\r\n   party is willing to purchase, and the second party willing to\r\n   sell the same:\r\n\r\n   Now, THEREFORE, the said John Pollexfen, for and in consideration\r\n   of such eye, to be by him safely and instantaneously removed from\r\n   its left socket, at the rooms of said Pollexfen, on Monday,\r\n   November 19, at the hour of eleven o'clock P. M., hereby\r\n   undertakes, promises and agrees, to pay unto the said Lucile\r\n   Marmont, in current coin of the United States, in advance, the\r\n   full and just sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars. AND the\r\n   said Lucile Marmont, on her part, hereby agrees and covenants to\r\n   sell, and for and in consideration of the said sum of seven\r\n   thousand and five hundred dollars, does hereby sell, unto the\r\n   said Pollexfen, her left eye, as aforesaid, to be by him\r\n   extracted, in time, place and manner above set forth; only\r\n   stipulating on her part, further, that said money shall be\r\n   deposited in the Bank of Page, Bacon & Co. on the morning of that\r\n   day, in the name of her attorney and agent, Thomas J. Falconer,\r\n   Esq., for her sole and separate use.\r\n\r\n   As witness our hands and seals, this nineteenth day of November,\r\n   A. D. 1853.\r\n\r\n      (Signed)                  JOHN POLLEXFEN, [L. S.]\r\n                                ..............  [L. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving finished the perusal, the photographer looked up, and the eyes of\r\nhis pupil encountered his own.\r\n\r\nAnd here terminates the third phase in the history of John Pollexfen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nThe confronting glance of the master and his pupil was not one of those\r\ncasual encounters of the eye which lasts but for a second, and\r\nterminates in the almost instantaneous withdrawal of the vanquished orb.\r\nOn the contrary, the scrutiny was long and painful. Each seemed\r\ndetermined to conquer, and both knew that flight was defeat, and\r\nquailing ruin. The photographer felt a consciousness of superiority in\r\nhimself, in his cause and his intentions. These being pure and\r\ncommendable, he experienced no sentiment akin to the weakness of guilt.\r\nThe girl, on the other hand, struggled with the emotions of terror,\r\ncuriosity and defiance. He thought, \"Will she yield?\" She, \"Is this man\r\nin earnest?\" Neither seemed inclined to speak, yet both grew impatient.\r\n\r\nNature finally vindicated her own law, that the most powerful intellect\r\nmust magnetize the weaker, and Lucile, dropping her eye, said, with a\r\nsickened smile, \"Sir, are you jesting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am incapable of trickery,\" dryly responded Pollexfen.\r\n\r\n\"But not of delusion?\" suggested the girl.\r\n\r\n\"A fool may be deceived, a chemist never.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would have the fiendish cruelty to tear out one of my eyes\r\nbefore I am dead? Why, even the vulture waits till his prey is carrion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not cruel,\" he responded; \"I labor under no delusion. I pursue no\r\nphantom. Where I now stand experiment forced me. With the rigor of a\r\nmathematical demonstration I have been driven to the proposition set\r\nforth in this agreement. Nature cannot lie. The earth revolves because\r\nit _must_. Causation controls the universe. Men speak of _accidents_,\r\nbut a fortuitous circumstance never happened since matter moved at the\r\nfist of the Almighty. Is it chance that the prism decomposes a ray of\r\nlight? Is it chance, that by mixing hydrogen and oxygen in the\r\nproportion of two to one in volume, water should be the result? How can\r\nNature err?\"\r\n\r\n\"She cannot,\" Lucile responded, \"but man may.\"\r\n\r\n\"That argues that I, too, am but human, and may fall into the common\r\ncategory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such was my thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then banish the idea forever. I deny not that I am but mortal, but man\r\nwas made in the image of God. Truth is as clear to the perception of the\r\ncreature, _when seen at all_, as it is to that of the Creator. What is\r\nman but a finite God? He moves about his little universe its sole\r\nmonarch, and with all the absoluteness of a deity, controls its motions\r\nand settles its destiny. He may not be able to number the sands on the\r\nseashore, but he can count his flocks and herds. He may not create a\r\ncomet, or overturn a world, but he can construct the springs of a watch,\r\nor the wheels of a mill, and they obey him as submissively as globes\r\nrevolve about their centres, or galaxies tread in majesty the\r\nmeasureless fields of space!\r\n\r\n\"For years,\" exclaimed he, rising to his feet, and fixing his eagle\r\nglance upon his pupil, \"for long and weary years, I have studied the\r\nlaws of light, color, and motion. Why are my pictures sharper in\r\noutline, and truer to nature, than those of rival artists around me?\r\nPoor fools! whilst they slavishly copied what nobler natures taught, I\r\nboldly trod in unfamiliar paths. I invented, whilst they traveled on the\r\nbeaten highway, look at my lenses! They use glass--yes, common\r\nglass--with a spectral power of 10, because they catch up the childish\r\nnotion of Dawson, and Harwick, that it is impossible to prepare the most\r\nbeautiful substance in nature, next to the diamond--crystalized\r\nquartz--for the purposes of art. Yet quartz has a power of refraction\r\nequal to 74! Could John Pollexfen sleep quietly in his bed whilst such\r\nan outrage was being perpetrated daily against God and His universe? No!\r\nLucile; never! Yon snowy hills conceal in their bosoms treasures far\r\nricher than the sheen of gold. With a single blast I tore away a ton of\r\ncrystal. How I cut and polished it is my secret, not the world's. The\r\nresult crowds my gallery daily, whilst theirs are half deserted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you not satisfied with your success?\" demanded the girl, whose\r\nown eye began to dilate, and gleam, as it caught the kindred spark of\r\nenthusiasm from the flaming orbs of Pollexfen.\r\n\r\n\"Satisfied!\" cried he; \"satisfied! Not until my _camera_ flashes back\r\nthe silver sheen of the planets, and the golden twinkle of the stars.\r\nNot until earth and all her daughters can behold themselves in yon\r\nmirror, clad in their radiant robes. Not until each hue of the rainbow,\r\neach tint of the flower, and the fitful glow of roseate beauty,\r\nchangeful as the tinge of summer sunsets, have all been captured,\r\ncopied, and embalmed forever by the triumphs of the human mind! Least of\r\nall, could I be satisfied now at the very advent of a nobler era in my\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you really believe,\" inquired Lucile, \"that color can be\r\nphotographed as faithfully as light and shade?\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe, girl? _I know it._ Does not your own beautiful eye print upon\r\nits retina tints, dyes and hues innumerable? And what is the eye but a\r\nlens? God was the first photographer. Give me but a living, sentient,\r\nperfect human eye to dissect and analyze, and I swear by the holy book\r\nof science that I will detect the secret, though hidden deep down in the\r\nprimal particles of matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why a human eye? Why not an eagle's or a lion's?\"\r\n\r\n\"A question I once propounded to myself, and never rested till it was\r\nsolved,\" replied Pollexfen. \"Go into my parlor, and ask my pets if I\r\nhave not been diligent, faithful, and honest. I have tested every eye\r\nbut the human. From the dull shark's to the imperial condor's, I have\r\ntried them all. Months elapsed ere I discovered the error in my\r\nreasoning. Finally, a little boy explained it all. 'Mother,' said a\r\nchild, in my hearing, 'when the pigeons mate, do they choose the\r\nprettiest birds?' 'No,' said his mother. 'And why not?' pursued the boy.\r\nBecause, responded I, waking as from a dream, _they have no perception\r\nof color_! The animal world sports in light and shade; the human only\r\nrejoices in the apprehension of color. Does the horse admire the\r\nrainbow? or does the ox spare the buttercup and the violet, because they\r\nare beautiful? The secret lies in the human eye alone. An eye! an eye!\r\ngive me but one, Lucile!\"\r\n\r\nAs the girl was about to answer, the photographer again interposed, \"Not\r\nnow; I want no answer now; I give you a month for reflection.\" And so\r\nsaying, he left the room as unceremoniously as he had entered.\r\n\r\nThe struggle in the mind of Lucile was sharp and decisive. Dependent\r\nherself upon her daily labor, her lover an invalid, and her nearest\r\nkindred starving, were facts that spoke in deeper tones than the thunder\r\nto her soul. Besides, was not one eye to be spared her, and was not a\r\nsingle eye quite as good as two? She thought, too, how glorious it would\r\nbe if Pollexfen should not be mistaken, and she herself should conduce\r\nso essentially to the noblest triumph of the photographic art.\r\n\r\nA shade, however, soon overspread her glowing face, as the unbidden idea\r\ncame forward: \"And will my lover still be faithful to a mutilated bride?\r\nWill not my beauty be marred forever? But,\" thought she, \"is not this\r\nsacrifice for him? Oh, yes! we shall cling still more closely in\r\nconsequence of the very misfortune that renders our union possible.\" One\r\nother doubt suggested itself to her mind: \"Is this contract legal? Can\r\nit be enforced? If so,\" and here her compressed lips, her dilated\r\nnostril, and her clenched hand betokened her decision, \"_if so, I\r\nyield_!\"\r\n\r\nThree weeks passed quickly away, and served but to strengthen the\r\ndetermination of Lucile. At the expiration of that period, and just one\r\nweek before the time fixed for the accomplishment of this cruel scheme,\r\nI was interrupted, during the trial of a cause, by the entry of my\r\nclerk, with a short note from Mademoiselle Marmont, requesting my\r\nimmediate presence at the office. Apologizing to the judge, and to my\r\nassociate counsel, I hastily left the court-room.\r\n\r\nOn entering, I found Lucile completely veiled. Nor was it possible,\r\nduring our interview, to catch a single glimpse of her features. She\r\nrose, and advancing toward me, extended her hand; whilst pressing it I\r\nfelt it tremble.\r\n\r\n\"Read this document, Mr. Falconer, and advise me as to its legality. I\r\nseek no counsel as to my duty. My mind is unalterably fixed on that\r\nsubject, and I beg of you, as a favor, in advance, to spare yourself the\r\ntrouble, and me the pain, of reopening it.\"\r\n\r\nIf the speech, and the tone in which it was spoken, surprised me, I need\r\nnot state how overwhelming was my astonishment at the contents of the\r\ndocument. I was absolutely stunned. The paper fell from my hands as\r\nthough they were paralyzed. Seeing my embarrassment, Lucile rose and\r\npaced the room in an excited manner. Finally pausing, opposite my desk,\r\nshe inquired, \"Do you require time to investigate the law?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an instant,\" said I, recovering my self-possession. \"This paper is\r\nnot only illegal, but the execution of it an offense. It provides for\r\nthe perpetration of the crime of _mayhem_, and it is my duty, as a good\r\ncitizen, to arrest the wretch who can contemplate so heinous and inhuman\r\nan act, without delay. See! he has even had the insolence to insert my\r\nown name as paymaster for his villainy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not visit your office to hear my benefactor and friend insulted,\"\r\nejaculated the girl, in a bitter and defiant tone. \"I only came to get\r\nan opinion on a matter of law.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this monster is insane, utterly crazy,\" retorted I. \"He ought, this\r\nmoment, to be in a madhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where they did put Tasso, and tried to put Galileo,\" she rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the good God!\" said I, solemnly, \"are you in earnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I not, I should not be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our conversation must terminate just where it began.\"\r\n\r\nLucile deliberately took her seat at my desk, and seizing a pen hastily\r\naffixed her signature to the agreement, and rising, left the office\r\nwithout uttering another syllable.\r\n\r\n\"I have, at least, the paper,\" thought I, \"and that I intend to keep.\"\r\n\r\nMy plans were soon laid. I sat down and addressed a most pressing letter\r\nto Mr. Courtland, informing him fully of the plot of the lunatic, for so\r\nI then regarded him, and urged him to hasten to San Francisco without a\r\nmoment's delay. Then, seizing my hat, I made a most informal call on Dr.\r\nWhite, and consulted him as to the best means of breaking through the\r\nconspiracy. We agreed at once that, as Pollexfen had committed no overt\r\nact in violation of law, he could not be legally arrested, but that\r\ninformation must be lodged with the chief of police, requesting him to\r\ndetail a trustworthy officer, whose duty it should be to obey us\r\nimplicitly, and be ready to act at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nAll this was done, and the officer duly assigned for duty. His name was\r\nCloudsdale. We explained to him fully the nature of the business\r\nintrusted to his keeping, and took great pains to impress upon him the\r\nnecessity of vigilance and fidelity. He entered into the scheme with\r\nalacrity, and was most profuse in his promises.\r\n\r\nOur settled plan was to meet at the outer door of the photographer's\r\ngallery, at half-past ten o'clock P. M., on the 19th of November, 1853,\r\nand shortly afterwards to make our way, by stratagem or force, into the\r\npresence of Pollexfen, and arrest him on the spot. We hoped to find such\r\npreparations on hand as would justify the arrest, and secure his\r\npunishment. If not, Lucile was to be removed, at all events, and\r\nconducted to a place of safety. Such was the general outline. During the\r\nweek we had frequent conferences, and Cloudsdale effected an entrance,\r\non two occasions, upon some slight pretext, into the room of the artist.\r\nBut he could discover nothing to arouse suspicion; so, at least, he\r\ninformed us. During the morning of the 19th, a warrant of arrest was\r\nduly issued, and lodged in the hands of Cloudsdale for execution. He\r\nthen bade us good morning, and urged us to be promptly on the ground at\r\nhalf-past ten. He told us that he had another arrest to make on the\r\nSacramento boat, when she arrived, but would not be detained five\r\nminutes at the police office. This was annoying, but we submitted with\r\nthe best grace possible.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, I got another glimpse at our \"trusty.\" The steamer\r\nleft for Panama at one P. M., and I went on board to bid adieu to a\r\nfriend who was a passenger.\r\n\r\nCloudsdale was also there, and seemed anxious and restive. He told me\r\nthat he was on the lookout for a highway robber, who had been tracked to\r\nthe city, and it might be possible that he was stowed away secretly on\r\nthe ship. Having business up town, I soon left, and went away with a\r\nheavy heart.\r\n\r\nAs night approached I grew more and more nervous, for the party most\r\ndeeply interested in preventing this crime had not made his appearance.\r\nMr. Courtland had not reached the city. Sickness or the miscarriage of\r\nmy letter, was doubtless the cause.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and myself supped together, and then proceeded to my\r\nchambers, where we armed ourselves as heavily as though we were about to\r\nfight a battle. We were both silent. The enormity of Pollexfen's\r\ncontemplated crime struck us dumb. The evening, however, wore painfully\r\naway, and finally our watches pointed to the time when we should take\r\nour position, as before agreed upon.\r\n\r\nWe were the first on the ground. This we did not specially notice then;\r\nbut when five, then ten, and next, fifteen minutes elapsed, and the\r\nofficer still neglected to make his appearance, our uneasiness became\r\nextreme. Twenty--_twenty-five_ minutes passed; still Cloudsdale was\r\nunaccountably detained. \"Can he be already in the rooms above?\" we\r\neagerly asked one another. \"Are we not betrayed?\" exclaimed I, almost\r\nfrantically.\r\n\r\n\"We have no time to spare in discussion,\" replied the Doctor, and,\r\nadvancing, we tried the door. It was locked. We had brought a\r\nstep-ladder, to enter by the window, if necessary. Next, we endeavored\r\nto hoist the window; it was nailed down securely. Leaping to the ground\r\nwe made an impetuous, united onset against the door; but it resisted all\r\nour efforts to burst it in. Acting now with all the promptitude demanded\r\nby the occasion, we mounted the ladder, and by a simultaneous movement\r\nbroke the sash, and leaped into the room. Groping our way hurriedly to\r\nthe stairs, we had placed our feet upon the first step, when our ears\r\nwere saluted with one long, loud, agonizing shriek. The next instant we\r\nrushed into the apartment of Lucile, and beheld a sight that seared our\r\nown eyeballs with horror, and baffles any attempt at description.\r\n\r\nBefore our faces stood the ferocious demon, holding in his arms the\r\nfainting girl, and hurriedly clipping, with a pair of shears, the last\r\nmuscles and integuments which held the organ in its place.\r\n\r\n\"Hold! for God's sake, hold!\" shouted Dr. White, and instantly grappled\r\nwith the giant. Alas! alas! it was too late, forever! The work had been\r\ndone; the eye torn, bleeding, from its socket, and just as the Doctor\r\nlaid his arm upon Pollexfen, the ball fell, dripping with gore, into his\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the fourth phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE THE FIFTH, AND LAST.\r\n\r\n\"Monster,\" cried I, \"we arrest you for the crime of mayhem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, gentlemen,\" said the photographer, \"you will be kind enough to\r\nexhibit your warrant.\" As he said this, he drew from his pocket with his\r\nright hand, the writ of arrest which had been intrusted to Cloudsdale,\r\nand deliberately lighting it in the candle, burned it to ashes before we\r\ncould arrest his movement. Lucile had fallen upon a ready prepared bed,\r\nin a fit of pain, and fainting. The Doctor took his place at her side,\r\nhis own eyes streaming with tears, and his very soul heaving with\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nAs for me, my heart was beating as audibly as a drum. With one hand I\r\ngrappled the collar of Pollexfen, and with the other held a cocked\r\npistol at his head.\r\n\r\nHe stood as motionless as a statue. Not a nerve trembled nor a tone\r\nfaltered, as he spoke these words: \"I am most happy to see you,\r\ngentlemen; especially the Doctor, for he can relieve me of the duties of\r\nsurgeon. You, sir, can assist him as nurse.\" And shaking off my hold as\r\nthough it had been a child's, he sprang into the laboratory adjoining,\r\nand locked the door as quick as thought.\r\n\r\nThe insensibility of Lucile did not last long. Consciousness returned\r\ngradually, and with it pain of the most intense description. Still she\r\nmaintained a rigidness of feature, and an intrepidity of soul that\r\nexcited both sorrow and admiration. \"Poor child! poor child!\" was all we\r\ncould utter, and even that spoken in whispers. Suddenly a noise in the\r\nlaboratory attracted attention. Rising I went close to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Two to one in measure; eight to one in weight; water, only water,\"\r\nsoliloquized the photographer. Then silence, \"Phosphorus; yellow in\r\ncolor; burns in oxygen.\" Silence again.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" cried I, \"Doctor, he is analyzing her eye! The fiend is\r\nactually performing his incantations!\"\r\n\r\nA moment elapsed. A sudden, sharp explosion; then a fall, as if a chair\r\nhad been upset, and----\r\n\r\n\"Carbon in combustion! Carbon in combustion!\" in a wild, excited tone,\r\nbroke from the lips of Pollexfen, and the instant afterwards he stood at\r\nthe bedside of his pupil. \"Lucile! Lucile! the secret is ours; ours\r\nonly!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice the girl lifted herself from her pillow,\r\nwhilst he proceeded: \"Carbon in combustion; I saw it ere the light died\r\nfrom the eyeball.\"\r\n\r\nA smile lighted the pale face of the girl as she faintly responded,\r\n\"Regulus gave both eyes for his country; I have given but one for my\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\nPressing both hands to my throbbing brow, I asked myself, \"Can this be\r\nreal? Do I dream? If real, why do I not assassinate the fiend? Doctor,\"\r\nsaid I, \"we must move Lucile. I will seek assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" responded Pollexfen; the excitement of motion might bring on\r\nerysipelas, or still worse, _tetanus_.\r\n\r\nA motion from Lucile brought me to her bedside. Taking from beneath her\r\npillow a bank deposit-book, and placing it in my hands, she requested me\r\nto hand it to Courtland the moment of his arrival, which she declared\r\nwould be the 20th, and desire him to read the billet attached to the\r\nbanker's note of the deposit. \"Tell him,\" she whispered, \"not to love me\r\nless in my mutilation;\" and again she relapsed into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe photographer now bent over the senseless form of his victim, and\r\nmuttering, \"Yes, carbon in combustion,\" added, in a softened tone, \"Poor\r\ngirl!\" As he lifted his face, I detected a solitary tear course down\r\nhis impressive features. \"The first I have shed,\" said he, sternly,\r\n\"since my daughter's death.\"\r\n\r\nSaying nothing, I could only think--\"And this wretch once had a child!\"\r\n\r\nThe long night through we stood around her bed. With the dawn, Martha,\r\nthe housekeeper, returned, and we then learned, for the first time, with\r\nwhat consummate skill Pollexfen had laid all his plans. For even the\r\nhousekeeper had been sent out of the way, and on a fictitious pretense\r\nthat she was needed at the bedside of a friend, whose illness was\r\nfeigned for the occasion. Nor was the day over before we learned with\r\ncertainty, but no longer with surprise, that Cloudsdale was on his way\r\nto Panama, with a bribe in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was safe to remove Lucile, she was borne on a litter to\r\nthe hospital of Dr. Peter Smith, where she received every attention that\r\nher friends could bestow.\r\n\r\nKnowing full well, from what Lucile had told me, that Courtland would be\r\ndown in the Sacramento boat, I awaited his arrival with the greatest\r\nimpatience. I could only surmise what would be his course. But judging\r\nfrom my own feelings, I could not doubt that it would be both desperate\r\nand decisive.\r\n\r\nFinally, the steamer rounded to, and the next moment the pale, emaciated\r\nform of the youth sank, sobbing, into my arms. Other tears mingled with\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nThe story was soon told. Eagerly, most eagerly, Courtland read the\r\nlittle note accompanying the bankbook. It was very simple, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n   MY OWN LIFE'S LIFE: Forgive the first, and only act, that you\r\n   will ever disapprove of in the conduct of your mutilated but\r\n   loving Lucile. Ah! can I still hope for your love, in the future,\r\n   as in the past? Give me but that assurance, and death itself\r\n   would be welcome.\r\n\r\n                                                          L. M.\r\n\r\nWe parted very late; he going to a hotel, I to the bedside of the\r\nwounded girl. Our destinies would have been reversed, but the surgeon's\r\norder was imperative, that she should see no one whose presence might\r\nconduce still further to bring on inflammation of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Courtland was confined to his bed until late in the\r\nafternoon, when he dressed, and left the hotel. I saw him no more until\r\nthe subsequent day. Why, it now becomes important to relate.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st, the day after his\r\narrival, Courtland staggered into the gallery, or rather the den of John\r\nPollexfen. He had no other arms than a short double-edged dagger, and\r\nthis he concealed in his sleeve.\r\n\r\nThey had met before; as he sometimes went there, anterior to the death\r\nof M. Marmont, to obtain the photographs upon which Lucile was\r\nexperimenting, previous to her engagement by the artist.\r\n\r\nPollexfen manifested no surprise at his visit; indeed, his manner\r\nindicated that it had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n\"You have come into my house, young man,\" slowly enunciated the\r\nphotographer, \"to take my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Courtland.\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he took a step forward. Pollexfen threw open his vest,\r\nraised himself to his loftiest height, and solemnly said: \"Fire! or\r\nstrike! as the case may be; I shall offer no resistance. I only beg of\r\nyou, as a gentleman, to hear me through before you play the part of\r\nassassin.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. The struck lamb gazing at the eagle! Vengeance\r\nencountering Faith! The pause was but momentary. \"I will hear you,\" said\r\nCourtland, sinking into a chair, already exhausted by his passion.\r\n\r\nPollexfen did not move. Confronting the lover, he told his story\r\ntruthfully to the end. He plead for his life; for he felt the proud\r\nconsciousness of having performed an act of duty that bordered upon the\r\nheroic.\r\n\r\nStill, there was no relenting in the eye of Courtland. It had that\r\nexpression in it that betokens blood. Cæsar saw it as Brutus lifted his\r\ndagger. Henry of Navarre recognized it as the blade of Ravillac sank\r\ninto his heart. Joaquin beheld it gleaming in the vengeful orbs of Harry\r\nLove! Pollexfen, too, understood the language that it spoke.\r\n\r\nDropping his hands, and taking one stride toward the young man, he\r\nsorrowfully said: \"I have but one word more to utter. Your affianced\r\nbride has joyfully sacrificed one of her lustrous eyes to science. In\r\ndoing so, she expressed but one regret, that you, whom she loved better\r\nthan vision, or even life, might, as the years roll away, forget to love\r\nher in her mutilation as you did in her beauty. Perfect yourself, she\r\nfeared mating with imperfection might possibly estrange your heart. Your\r\nsuperiority in personal appearance might constantly disturb the perfect\r\nequilibrium of love.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased. The covert meaning was seized with lightning rapidity by\r\nCourtland. Springing to his feet, he exclaimed joyfully: \"The sacrifice\r\nmust be mutual. God never created a soul that could outdo Charles\r\nCourtland's in generosity.\"\r\n\r\nFlinging his useless dagger upon the floor, he threw himself into the\r\nalready extended arms of the photographer, and begged him \"to be quick\r\nwith the operation.\" The artist required no second invitation, and ere\r\nthe last words died upon his lips, the sightless ball of his left eye\r\nswung from its socket.\r\n\r\nThere was no cry of pain; no distortion of the young man's features with\r\nagony; no moan, or sob, or sigh. As he closed firmly his right eye, and\r\ncompressed his pallid lips, a joyous smile lit up his whole countenance\r\nthat told the spectator how superior even human love is to the body's\r\nanguish; how willingly the severest sacrifice falls at the beck of\r\nhonor!\r\n\r\nI shall attempt no description of the manner in which I received the\r\nastounding news from the lips of the imperturbable Pollexfen; nor\r\nprolong this narrative by detailing the meeting of the lovers, their\r\ngradual recovery, their marriage, and their departure for the vales of\r\nDauphiny. It is but just to add, however, that Pollexfen added two\r\nthousand five hundred dollars to the bank account of Mademoiselle\r\nMarmont, on the day of her nuptials, as a bridal present, given, no\r\ndoubt, partially as a compensation to the heroic husband for his\r\nvoluntary mutilation.\r\n\r\nLong months elapsed after the departure of Lucile and her lover before\r\nthe world heard anything more of the photographer.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, in the early spring of the next season, it was\r\nobserved that Pollexfen had opened a new and most magnificent gallery\r\nupon Montgomery Street, and had painted prominently upon his sign, these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |          JOHN POLLEXFEN, PHOTOGRAPHER.             |\r\n    |                                                    |\r\n    |       _Discoverer of the Carbon Process,           |\r\n    | By which Colored Pictures are Painted by the Sun._ |\r\n    +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe news of this invention spread, in a short time, over the whole\r\ncivilized world; and the Emperor Napoleon the Third, with the liberality\r\ncharacteristic of great princes, on hearing from the lips of Lucile a\r\nfull account of this wonderful discovery, revived, in favor of John\r\nPollexfen, the pension which had been bestowed upon Niépce, and which\r\nhad lapsed by his death, in 1839; and with a magnanimity that would have\r\nrendered still more illustrious his celebrated uncle, revoked the decree\r\nof forfeiture against the estates of M. Marmont, and bestowed them, with\r\na corresponding title of nobility, upon Lucile and her issue.\r\n\r\nThis ends my story. I trust the patient reader will excuse its length,\r\nfor it was all necessary, in order to explain how John Pollexfen made\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_THE LOVE KNOT._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon my bosom lies\r\n      A knot of blue and gray;\r\n    You ask me why tears fill my eyes\r\n      As low to you I say:\r\n\r\n    \"I had two brothers once,\r\n      Warmhearted, bold and gay;\r\n    They left my side--one wore the blue,\r\n      The other wore the gray.\r\n\r\n    One rode with \"Stonewall\" and his men,\r\n      And joined his fate with Lee;\r\n    The other followed Sherman's march,\r\n      Triumphant to the sea.\r\n\r\n    Both fought for what they deemed the right,\r\n      And died with sword in hand;\r\n    One sleeps amid Virginia's hills,\r\n      And one in Georgia's land.\r\n\r\n    Why should one's dust be consecrate,\r\n      The other's spurned with scorn--\r\n    Both victims of a common fate,\r\n      Twins cradled, bred and born?\r\n\r\n    Oh! tell me not--a patriot one,\r\n      A traitor vile the other;\r\n    John was my mother's favorite son,\r\n      But Eddie was my brother.\r\n\r\n    The same sun shines above their graves,\r\n      My love unchanged must stay--\r\n    And so upon my bosom lies\r\n      Love's knot of blue and gray.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_THE AZTEC PRINCESS._\r\n\r\n\"Speaking marble.\"--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIn common with many of our countrymen, my attention has been powerfully\r\ndrawn to the subject of American antiquities, ever since the publication\r\nof the wonderful discoveries made by Stephens and Norman Among the ruins\r\nof Uxmal and Palenque.\r\n\r\nYucatan and Chiapas have always spoken to my imagination more forcibly\r\nthan Egypt or Babylon; and in my early dreams of ambition I aspired to\r\nemulate the fame of Champollion _le Jeune_, and transmit my name to\r\nposterity on the same page with that of the decipherer of the\r\nhieroglyphics on the pyramids of Ghizeh.\r\n\r\nThe fame of warriors and statesmen is transient and mean, when compared\r\nto that of those literary colossii whose herculean labors have turned\r\nback upon itself the tide of oblivion, snatched the scythe from the\r\nhands of Death, and, reversing the duties of the fabled Charon, are now\r\nbusily engaged in ferrying back again across the Styx the shades of the\r\nillustrious dead, and landing them securely upon the shores of true\r\nimmortality, the ever-living Present! Even the laurels of the poet and\r\norator, the historian and philosopher, wither, and\r\n\r\n    \"Pale their ineffectual fires\"\r\n\r\nin the presence of that superiority--truly godlike in its\r\nattributes--which, with one wave of its matchless wand, conjures up\r\nwhole realms, reconstructs majestic empires, peoples desolate\r\nwastes--voiceless but yesterday, save with the shrill cry of the\r\nbittern--and, contemplating the midnight darkness shrouding Thebes and\r\nNineveh, cries aloud, \"Let there be light!\" and suddenly Thotmes starts\r\nfrom his tomb, the dumb pyramids become vocal, Nimroud wakes from his\r\nsleep of four thousand years, and, springing upon his battle-horse, once\r\nmore leads forth his armies to conquest and glory. The unfamiliar air\r\nlearns to repeat accents, forgotten ere the foundations of Troy were\r\nlaid, and resounds once more with the echoes of a tongue in which old\r\nMenes wooed his bride, long before Noah was commanded to build the Ark,\r\nor the first rainbow smiled upon the cloud.\r\n\r\nAll honor, then, to the shades of Young and Champollion, Lepsius and De\r\nLacy, Figeac and Layard. Alexander and Napoleon conquered kingdoms, but\r\nthey were ruled by the living. On the contrary, the heroes I have\r\nmentioned vanquished mighty realms, governed alone by the\r\n\r\n    \"Monarch of the Scythe and Glass,\"\r\n\r\nthat unsubstantial king, who erects his thrones on broken columns and\r\nfallen domes, waves his sceptre over dispeopled wastes, and builds his\r\ncapitals amid the rocks of Petræa and the catacombs of Egypt.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nSuch being the object of my ambition, it will not appear surprising that\r\nI embraced every opportunity to enlarge my knowledge of my favorite\r\nsubject--American Antiquities--and eagerly perused every new volume\r\npurporting to throw any light upon it. I was perfectly familiar with the\r\nworks of Lord Kingsborough and Dr. Robertson before I was fifteen years\r\nof age, and had studied the explorations of Bernal Diaz, Waldeck, and\r\nDupaix, before I was twenty. My delight, therefore, was boundless when a\r\ncopy of Stephens's travels in Yucatan and Chiapas fell into my hands,\r\nand I devoured his subsequent publications on the same subject with all\r\nthe avidity of an enthusiast. Nor did my labors stop here. Very early I\r\nsaw the importance of an acquaintance with aboriginal tongues, and\r\nimmediately set about mastering the researches of Humboldt and\r\nSchoolcraft. This was easily done; for I discovered, much to my chagrin\r\nand disappointment, that but little is known of the languages of the\r\nIndian tribes, and that little is soon acquired. Dissatisfied with such\r\ninformation as could be gleaned from books only, I applied for and\r\nobtained an agency for dispensing Indian rations among the Cherokees and\r\nOuchitaws, and set out for Fort Towson in the spring of 1848.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival I left the fort, and took up my residence at the\r\nwigwam of Sac-a-ra-sa, one of the principal chiefs of the Cherokees. My\r\nintention to make myself familiar with the Indian tongues was noised\r\nabroad, and every facility was afforded me by my hospitable friends. I\r\ntook long voyages into the interior of the continent, encountered\r\ndelegations from most of the western tribes, and familiarized myself\r\nwith almost every dialect spoken by the Indians dwelling west of the\r\nRocky Mountains. I devoted four years to this labor, and at the end of\r\nthat period, with my mind enriched by a species of knowledge\r\nunattainable by a mere acquaintance with books, I determined to visit\r\nCentral America in person, and inspect the monuments of Uxmal and\r\nPalenque with my own eyes.\r\n\r\nFull of this intention, I took passage on the steamship \"Prometheus,\" in\r\nDecember, 1852, bound from New York to Greytown, situated in the State\r\nof Nicaragua; a point from which I could easily reach Chiapas or\r\nYucatan.\r\n\r\nAnd at this point of my narrative, it becomes necessary to digress for a\r\nmoment, and relate an incident which occurred on the voyage, and which,\r\nin its consequences, changed my whole mode of investigation, and\r\nintroduced a new element of knowledge to my attention.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Judge E----, formerly on the Bench of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the State of New York, was a fellow-passenger. He had been\r\nemployed by the Nicaragua Transit Company to visit Leon, the capital of\r\nNicaragua, and perfect some treaty stipulations with regard to the\r\nproject of an interoceanic canal. Fellow-passengers, we of course became\r\nacquainted almost immediately, and at an early day I made respectful\r\ninquiries concerning that science to which he had of late years\r\nconsecrated his life--I mean the \"Theory of Spiritual Communion between\r\nthe Two Worlds of Matter and Spirit.\" The judge was as communicative as\r\nI could desire, and with the aid of two large manuscript volumes (which\r\nwere subsequently given to the public), he introduced me at once into\r\nthe profoundest arcana of the science. I read his books through with the\r\ndeepest interest, and though not by any means convinced, I was startled\r\nand bewildered. The most powerful instincts of my nature were aroused,\r\nand I frankly acknowledged to my instructor, that an irresistible\r\ncuriosity had seized me to witness some of those strange phenomena with\r\nwhich his volumes superabounded. Finally, I extorted a promise from him,\r\nthat on our arrival at Greytown, if a favorable opportunity presented,\r\nhe would endeavor to form the mystical circle, and afford me the\r\nprivilege I so much coveted--_to see for myself_. The anticipated\r\nexperiments formed the staple of our conversation for the six weary days\r\nand nights that our trip occupied. Finally, on the morning of the\r\nseventh day, the low and wooded coast of Nicaragua gently rose in the\r\nwestern horizon, and before twelve o'clock we were safely riding at\r\nanchor within the mouth of the San Juan River. But here a new vexation\r\nwas in store for us. The river boats commenced firing up, and before\r\ndark we were transferred from our ocean steamer to the lighter crafts,\r\nand were soon afterwards leisurely puffing our way up the river.\r\n\r\nThe next day we arrived at the upper rapids, where the little village of\r\nCastillo is situated, and where we had the pleasure of being detained\r\nfive or six days, awaiting the arrival of the California passengers.\r\nThis delay was exactly what I most desired, as it presented the\r\nopportunity long waited for with the utmost impatience. But the weather\r\nsoon became most unfavorable, and the rain commenced falling in\r\ntorrents. The Judge declared that it was useless to attempt anything so\r\nlong as it continued to rain. But on the third evening he consented to\r\nmake the experiment, provided the materials of a circle could be found.\r\nWe were not long in suspense, for two young ladies from Indiana, a young\r\ndoctor from the old North State (now a practicing physician in Stockton,\r\nCalifornia), and several others, whose names I have long since\r\nforgotten, volunteered to take part in the mysterious proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut the next difficulty was to find a place to meet in. The doctor and I\r\nstarted off on a tour through the village to prepare a suitable spot.\r\nThe rain was still falling, and the night as dark as Erebus. Hoisting\r\nour umbrellas, we defied night and storm. Finally, we succeeded in\r\nhiring a room in the second story of a building in process of erection,\r\nprocured one or two lanterns, and illuminated it to the best of our\r\nability. Soon afterwards we congregated there, but as the doors and\r\nwindows were not put in, and there were no chairs or tables, we were\r\nonce more on the point of giving up in despair. Luckily there were\r\nfifteen or twenty baskets of claret wine unopened in the room, and these\r\nwe arranged for seats, substituting an unhinged door, balanced on a pile\r\nof boxes, for the leaf of a table. Our rude contrivance worked\r\nadmirably, and before an hour had rolled by we had received a mass of\r\ncommunications from all kinds of people in the spirit world, and fully\r\nsatisfied ourselves that the Judge was either a wizard or what he\r\nprofessed to be--a _medium_ of communication with departed spirits.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to detail all the messages we received; one only do I\r\ndeem it important to notice. A spirit, purporting to be that of Horatio\r\nNelson, rapped out his name, and stated that he had led the assault on\r\nthe Spaniards in the attack of the old Fort of Castillo frowning above\r\nus, and there first distinguished himself in life. He declared that\r\nthese mouldering ruins were one of his favorite haunts, and that he\r\nprided himself more on the assault and capture of _Castillo Viejo_ than\r\non the victory of the Nile or triumph of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nThe circle soon afterwards dispersed, and most of those who had\r\nparticipated in it were, in a few minutes, slumbering in their cots. As\r\nfor myself, I was astounded with all that I had witnessed, but at the\r\nsame time delighted beyond measure at the new field opening before me. I\r\ntossed from side to side, unable to close my eyes or to calm down the\r\nexcitement, until, finding that sleep was impossible, I hastily rose,\r\nthrew on my coat, and went to the door, which was slightly ajar. On\r\nlooking out, I observed a person passing toward the foot of the hill\r\nupon which stood the Fort of Castillo Viejo. The shower had passed off,\r\nand the full moon was riding majestically in mid heavens. I thought I\r\nrecognized the figure, and I ventured to accost him. It was the Judge.\r\nHe also had been unable to sleep, and declared that a sudden impulse\r\ndrove him forth into the open air.\r\n\r\nGradually he had approached the foot of the hill, which shot up, like a\r\nsugar-loaf, two or three hundred feet above the level of the stream, and\r\nhad just made up his mind to ascend it when I spoke to him. I readily\r\nconsented to accompany him, and we immediately commenced climbing\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThe ascent was toilsome, as well as dangerous, and more than once we\r\nwere on the point of descending without reaching the summit. Still,\r\nhowever, we clambered on, and at half-past one o'clock A. M., we\r\nsucceeded in our effort, and stood upon the old stone rampart that had\r\nfor more than half a century been slowly yielding to the remorseless\r\ntooth of Time. Abandoned for many years, the ruins presented the very\r\npicture of desolation. Rank vines clung upon every stone, and half\r\nfilled up with their green tendrils the yawning crevices everywhere\r\ngaping at us, and whispering of the flight of years.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a broken fragment that once served as the floor of a\r\nport-hole, and many minutes elapsed before either of us spoke a word. We\r\nwere busy with the past. Our thoughts recalled the terrible scenes which\r\nthis same old fort witnessed on that glorious day when the youthful\r\nNelson planted with his own hand the flag of St. George upon the very\r\nramparts where we were sitting.\r\n\r\nHow long we had been musing I know not; but suddenly we heard a low,\r\nlong-drawn sigh at our very ears. Each sprang to his feet, looked wildly\r\naround, but seeing nothing, gazed at the other in blank astonishment. We\r\nresumed our seats, but had hardly done so, when a deep and most\r\nanguishing groan was heard, that pierced our very hearts. This time we\r\nretained our position. I had unclosed my lips, preparatory to speaking\r\nto my companion, when I felt myself distinctly touched upon the\r\nshoulder. My voice died away inarticulately, and I shuddered with\r\nill-concealed terror. But my companion was perfectly calm, and moved not\r\na nerve or a muscle. Able at length to speak, I said, \"Judge, let us\r\nleave this haunted sepulchre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the world,\" he coolly replied. \"You have been anxious for\r\nspiritual phenomena; now you can witness them unobserved and without\r\ninterruption.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, my right arm was seized with great force, and I was\r\ncompelled to resign myself to the control of the presence that possessed\r\nme. My right hand was then placed on the Judge's left breast, and his\r\nleft hand laid gently on my right shoulder. At the same time he took a\r\npencil and paper from his pocket, and wrote very rapidly the following\r\ncommunication, addressed to me:\r\n\r\n   The Grave hath its secrets, but the Past has none. Time may\r\n   crumble pyramids in the dust, but the genius of man can despoil\r\n   him of his booty, and rescue the story of buried empires from\r\n   oblivion. Even now the tombs of Egypt are unrolling their\r\n   recorded epitaphs. Even now the sculptured mounds of Nineveh are\r\n   surrendering the history of Nebuchadnezzar's line. Before another\r\n   generation shall pass away, the columns of Palenque shall find a\r\n   tongue, and the _bas-reliefs_ of Uxmal wake the dead from their\r\n   sleep of two thousand years. Young man! open your eyes; we shall\r\n   meet again amid the ruins of the _Casa Grande_!\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Judges hand fell palsied at his side, and the paper\r\nwas thrust violently into my left hand. I held it up so as to permit the\r\nrays of the moon to fall full upon it, and read it carefully from\r\nbeginning to end. But no sooner had I finished reading it than a shock\r\nsomething like electricity struck us simultaneously, and seemed to rock\r\nthe old fort to its very foundation. Everything near us was apparently\r\naffected by it, and several large bowlders started from their ticklish\r\nbeds and rolled away down the mountain. Our surprise at this was hardly\r\nover, ere one still greater took possession of us. On raising our eyes\r\nto the moss-grown parapet, we beheld a figure sitting upon it that bore\r\na very striking resemblance to the pictures in the Spanish Museum at\r\nMadrid of the early Aztec princes. It was a female, and she bore upon\r\nher head a most gorgeous headdress of feathers, called a _Panache_. Her\r\nface was calm, clear, and exceedingly beautiful. The nose was\r\nprominent--more so than the Mexican or Tezcucan--and the complexion much\r\nlighter. Indeed, by the gleam of the moonlight, it appeared as white as\r\nthat of a Caucasian princess, and wore an expression full of benignity\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nOur eyes were riveted upon this beautiful apparition, and our lips\r\nsilent. She seemed desirous of speaking, and once or twice I beheld her\r\nlips faintly moving. Finally, raising her white, uncovered arm, she\r\npointed to the north, and softly murmured, \"_Palenque_!\"\r\n\r\nBefore we could resolve in our minds what to say in reply, the fairy\r\nprincess folded her arms across her breast, and disappeared as suddenly\r\nand mysteriously as she had been evoked from night. We spoke not a word\r\nto each other, but gazed long and thoughtfully at the spot where the\r\nbright vision had gladdened and bewildered our sight. By a common\r\nimpulse, we turned to leave, and descended the mountain in silence as\r\ndeep as that which brooded over chaos ere God spoke creation into being.\r\nWe soon reached the foot of the hill, and parted, with no word upon our\r\nlips, though with the wealth of untold worlds gathered up in our hearts.\r\n\r\nNever, since that bright and glorious tropical night, have I mentioned\r\nthe mysterious scene we witnessed on the ramparts of Fort Castillo; and\r\nI have every reason to believe that my companion has been as discreet.\r\n\r\nThis, perhaps, will be the only record that shall transmit it to the\r\nfuture; but well I know that its fame will render me immortal.\r\n\r\nThrough me and me alone, the sculptured marbles of Central America have\r\nfound a tongue. By my efforts, Palenque speaks of her buried glories,\r\nand Uxmal wakes from oblivion's repose. Even the old pyramid of Cholula\r\nyields up its bloody secrets, and _Casa Grande_ reveals the dread\r\nhistory of its royalties.\r\n\r\nThe means by which a key to the monumental hieroglyphics of Central\r\nAmerica was furnished me, as well as a full account of the discoveries\r\nmade at Palenque, will be narrated in the subsequent chapters of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n   \"Amid all the wreck of empires, nothing ever spoke so forcibly\r\n   the world's mutations, as this immense forest, shrouding what was\r\n   once a great city.\"--STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the next morning after the singular adventure recorded in\r\nthe preceding chapter, the California passengers bound eastward arrived,\r\nand those of us bound to the westward were transshipped to the same\r\nsteamer which they had just abandoned. In less than an hour we were all\r\naboard, and the little river-craft was busily puffing her way toward the\r\nfairy shores of Lake Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nFor me, however, the evergreen scenery of the tropics possessed no\r\ncharms, and its balmy air no enchantments. Sometimes, as the steamer\r\napproached the ivy-clad banks, laden as they were with flowers of every\r\nhue, and alive with ten thousand songsters of the richest and most\r\nvariegated plumage, my attention would be momentarily aroused, and I\r\nenjoyed the sweet fragrance of the flowers, and the gay singing of the\r\nbirds. But my memory was busy with the past, and my imagination with the\r\nfuture. With the Judge, even, I could not converse for any length of\r\ntime, without falling into a reverie by no means flattering to his\r\npowers of conversation. About noon, however, I was fully aroused to the\r\nbeauty and sublimity of the surrounding scenery. We had just passed Fort\r\nSan Carlos, at the junction of the San Juan River with the lake, and\r\nbefore us was spread out like an ocean that magnificent sheet of water.\r\nIt was dotted all over with green islands, and reminded me of the\r\npicture drawn by Addison of the Vision of Mirza.\r\n\r\nHere, said I to myself, is the home of the blest. These emerald islets,\r\nfed by vernal skies, never grow sere and yellow in the autumn; never\r\nbleak and desolate in the winter. Perpetual summer smiles above them,\r\nand wavelets dimpled by gentle breezes forever lave their shores. Rude\r\nstorms never howl across these sleeping billows, and the azure heavens\r\nwhisper eternal peace to the lacerated heart.\r\n\r\nHardly had these words escaped my lips, when a loud report, like a whole\r\npark of artillery, suddenly shook the air. It seemed to proceed from the\r\nwestward, and on turning our eyes in that direction, we beheld the true\r\ncause of the phenomenon. Ometepe was in active eruption. It had given no\r\nadmonitory notice of the storm which had been gathering in its bosom,\r\nbut like the wrath of those dangerous men we sometimes encounter in\r\nlife, it had hidden its vengeance beneath flowery smiles, and covered\r\nover its terrors with deceitful calm.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the whole face of nature was changed. The skies became dark\r\nand lurid, the atmosphere heavy and sultry, and the joyous waters across\r\nwhich we had been careering only a moment before with animation and\r\nlaughter, rose in tumultuous swells, like the cross-seas in the Mexican\r\nGulf after a tornado. Terror seized all on board the steamer, and the\r\npassengers were clamorous to return to Fort San Carlos. But the captain\r\nwas inexorable, and seizing the wheel himself, he defied the war of the\r\nelements, and steered the vessel on her ordinary course. This lay\r\ndirectly to the south of Ometepe, and within a quarter of a mile of the\r\nfoot of the volcano.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the region of the eruption, the waters of the lake\r\nbecame more and more troubled, and the air still more difficult to\r\nrespire. Pumice-stone, seemingly as light as cork, covered the surface\r\nof the lake, and soon a terrific shower of hot ashes darkened the very\r\nsun. Our danger at this moment was imminent in the extreme, for, laying\r\naside all consideration of peril from the volcano itself, it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that the ashes could be swept from the deck fast enough\r\nto prevent the woodwork from ignition. But our chief danger was still in\r\nstore for us; for just as we had arrived directly under the impending\r\nsummit, as it were, a fearful explosion took place, and threatened to\r\ningulf us all in ruin. The crater of the volcano, which previously had\r\nonly belched forth ashes and lava, now sent up high into the heavens a\r\nsheet of lurid fire. It did not resemble gases in combustion, which we\r\ndenominate flame, flickering for a moment in transitory splendor, and\r\nthen dying out forever. On the contrary, it looked more like _frozen\r\nfire_ if the expression may be allowed. It presented an appearance of\r\nsolidity that seemed to defy abrasion or demolition, and rose into the\r\nblue sky like a marble column of lightning. It was far brighter than\r\nordinary flame, and cast a gloomy and peculiar shadow upon the deck of\r\nthe steamer. At the same instant the earth itself shook like a summer\r\nreed when swept by a storm, and the water struck the sides of the vessel\r\nlike some rocky substance. Every atom of timber in her trembled and\r\nquivered for a moment, then grew into senseless wood once more. At this\r\ninstant, the terrific cry of \"Fire!\" burst from a hundred tongues, and I\r\nhad but to cast my eyes toward the stern of the ship to realize the new\r\nperil at hand. The attention of the passengers was now equally divided\r\nbetween the burning ship and the belching volcano. The alternative of a\r\ndeath by flame, or by burial in the lake was presented to each of us.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments more the captain, crew, and passengers, including\r\nseventeen ladies, were engaged hand to hand with the enemy nearest to\r\nus. Buckets, pumps, and even hats, were used to draw up water from the\r\nlake and pass to those hardy spirits that dared to press closest to the\r\nflames. But I perceived at once that all would prove unavailing. The\r\nfire gained upon the combatants every moment, and a general retreat took\r\nplace toward the stem of the steamer. Fully satisfied what would be the\r\nfate of those who remained upon the ship, I commenced preparing to\r\nthrow myself into the water, and for that purpose was about tearing one\r\nof the cabin doors from its hinges, when the Judge came up, and accosted\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly calm; nor could I, after the closest scrutiny of his\r\nfeatures, detect either excitement, impatience, or alarm. In\r\nastonishment I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, death is at the doors! Prepare to escape from the burning ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no danger,\" he replied calmly; \"and even if there were, what\r\nis this thing that we call _death_, that we should fear it? Compose\r\nyourself, young man; there is as yet no danger. I have been forewarned\r\nof this scene, and not a soul of us shall perish.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding him as a madman, I tore the door from its hinges with the\r\nstrength of despair, and rushing to the side of the ship, was in the\r\nvery act of plunging overboard, when a united shriek of all the\r\npassengers rose upon my ear, and I paused involuntarily to ascertain the\r\nnew cause of alarm. Scarcely did I have time to cast one look at the\r\nmountain, ere I discovered that the flames had all been extinguished at\r\nits crater, and that the air was darkened by a mass of vapor, rendering\r\nthe sunlight a mockery and a shadow. But this eclipse was our\r\nredemption. The next moment a sheet of cool water fell upon the ship,\r\nand in such incredible masses, that many articles were washed overboard,\r\nand the door I held closely in my hands was borne away by the flood. The\r\nfire was completely extinguished, and, ere we knew it, the danger over.\r\n\r\nGreatly puzzled how to account for the strange turn in our affairs, I\r\nwas ready at the moment to attribute it to Judge E----, and I had almost\r\nsettled the question that he was a necromancer, when he approached me,\r\nand putting an open volume in my hand, which I ascertained was a\r\n\"History of the Republic of Guatemala,\" I read the following incident:\r\n\r\n   Nor is it true that volcanoes discharge only fire and molten lava\r\n   from their craters. On the contrary, they frequently shower down\r\n   water in almost incredible quantities, and cause oftentimes as\r\n   much mischief by floods as they do by flames. An instance of this\r\n   kind occurred in the year 1542, which completely demolished one\r\n   half the buildings in the city of Guatemala. It was chiefly owing\r\n   to this cause that the site of the city was changed; the ancient\r\n   site being abandoned, and the present locality selected for the\r\n   capital.[A-109]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A-109: Thompson's History of Guatemala, p. 238.]\r\n\r\nSix months after the events recorded above, I dismounted from my mule\r\nnear the old _cabilda_ in the modern village of Palenque. During that\r\ninterval I had met with the usual fortune of those who travel alone in\r\nthe interior of the Spanish-American States. The war of castes was at\r\nits height, and the cry of _Carrera_ and _Morazan_ greeted the ear of\r\nthe stranger at almost every turn of the road. Morazan represented the\r\naristocratic idea, still prevalent amongst the better classes in Central\r\nAmerica; whilst Carrera, on the other hand, professed the wildest\r\nliberty and the extremest democracy. The first carried in his train the\r\nwealth, official power, and refinement of the country; the latter drew\r\nafter him that huge old giant, _Plebs._, who in days gone by has pulled\r\ndown so many thrones, built the groundwork of so many republics, and\r\nthen, by fire and sword and barbarian ignorance, laid their trophies in\r\nthe dust. My sense and sympathy took different directions. Reason led me\r\nto the side of Morazan; but early prejudices carried me over to Carrera.\r\nVery soon, however, I was taught the lesson, that power in the hands of\r\nthe rabble is the greatest curse with which a country can be afflicted,\r\nand that a _paper constitution_ never yet made men free. I found out,\r\ntoo, that the entire population was a rabble and that it made but little\r\ndifference which hero was in the ascendant. The plunder of the\r\nlaboring-classes was equally the object of both, and anarchy the fate of\r\nthe country, no matter who held the reins. Civil wars have corrupted the\r\nwhole population. The men are all _bravos_, and the women coquettes. The\r\nfireside virtues are unknown. It will be generations before those\r\npseudo-republicans will learn that there can be no true patriotism where\r\nthere is no country; there can be no country where there are no homes;\r\nthere can be no home where woman rules not from the throne of Virtue\r\nwith the sceptre of Love!\r\n\r\nI had been robbed eighteen times in six months; taken prisoner four\r\ntimes by each party; sent in chains to the city of Guatemala, twice by\r\nCarrera, and once by Morazan as a spy; and condemned to be shot as a\r\ntraitor by both chieftains. In each instance I owed my liberation to the\r\nAmerican Consul-General, who, having heard the object with which I\r\nvisited the country, determined that it should not be thwarted by these\r\nintestine broils.\r\n\r\nFinally, as announced above, I reached the present termination of my\r\njourney, and immediately commenced preparations to explore the famous\r\nruins in the neighborhood. The first want of a traveler, no matter\r\nwhither he roams, is a guide; and I immediately called at the redstone\r\nresidence of the Alcalde, and mentioned to him my name, the purport of\r\nmy visit to Central America, and the object of my present call upon him.\r\nEying me closely from head to foot, he asked me if I had any money\r\n(\"Tiene V. dinero?\")\r\n\r\n\"Si, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cuanto?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poco mas de quinientos pesos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bien; sientase.\"\r\n\r\nSo I took a seat upon a shuck-bottom stool, and awaited the next move of\r\nthe high dignitary. Without responding directly to my application for a\r\nguide, he suddenly turned the conversation, and demanded if I was\r\nacquainted with Senor Catherwood or _el gobernador_. (I afterwards\r\nlearned that Mr. Stephens was always called Governor by the native\r\npopulation in the vicinity of Palenque.) I responded in the negative. He\r\nthen informed me that these gentlemen had sent him a copy of their work\r\non Chiapas, and at the same time a large volume, that had been recently\r\ntranslated into Spanish by a member of the Spanish Academy, named Don\r\nDonoso Cortes, which he placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nMy astonishment can be better imagined than described, when, on turning\r\nto the title-page, I ascertained that the book was called \"_Nature's\r\nDivine Revelations_. By A. J. DAVIS. _Traducido, etc._\"\r\n\r\nObserving my surprise, the Alcalde demanded if I knew the author.\r\n\r\n\"Most assuredly,\" said I; \"he is my----\" But I must not anticipate.\r\n\r\nAfter assuring me that he regarded the work as the greatest book in the\r\nworld, next to the Bible and Don Quixote, and that he fully believed\r\nevery line in it, _including the preface_, he abruptly left the room,\r\nand went into the court-yard behind the house.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely time to take a survey of the ill-furnished apartment,\r\nwhen he returned, leading in by a rope, made of horsehair, called a\r\n\"larriete,\" a youth whose arms were pinioned behind him, and whose\r\nfeatures wore the most remarkable expression I ever beheld.\r\n\r\nAmazed, I demanded who this young man was, and why he had been\r\nintroduced to my notice. He replied, without noticing in the slightest\r\ndegree my surprise, that _Pio_--for that was his name--was the best\r\nguide to the ruins that the village afforded; that he was taken prisoner\r\na few months before from a marauding party of _Caribs_ (here the young\r\nman gave a low, peculiar whistle and a negative shake of the head), and\r\nthat if his escape could be prevented by me, he would be found to be\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\nI then asked Pio if he understood the Spanish language, but he evinced\r\nno comprehension of what I said. The Alcalde remarked that the _mozo_\r\nwas very cunning, and understood a great deal more than he pretended;\r\nthat he was by law his (the Alcalde's) slave, being a Carib by birth,\r\nand uninstructed totally in religious exercises; in fact, that he was a\r\nneophyte, and had been placed in his hands by the Padre to teach the\r\nrudiments of Christianity.\r\n\r\nI next demanded of Pio if he was willing to conduct me to the ruins. A\r\ngleam of joy at once illuminated his features, and, throwing himself at\r\nmy feet, he gazed upward into my face with all the simplicity of a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nBut I did not fail to notice the peculiar posture he assumed whilst\r\nsitting. It was not that of the American Indian, who carelessly lolls\r\nupon the ground, nor that of the Hottentot, who sits flatly, with his\r\nknees upraised. On the contrary, the attitude was precisely the same as\r\nthat sculptured on the _basso-rilievos_ at Uxmal, Palenque, and\r\nthroughout the region of Central American ruins. I had first observed it\r\nin the Aztec children exhibited a few years ago throughout the United\r\nStates. The weight of the body seemed to be thrown on the inside of the\r\nthighs, and the feet turned outward, but drawn up closely to the body.\r\nNo sooner did I notice this circumstance than I requested Pio to rise,\r\nwhich he did. Then, pretending suddenly to change my mind, I requested\r\nhim to be seated again. This I did to ascertain if the first attitude\r\nwas accidental. But on resuming his seat, he settled down with great\r\nease and celerity into the self-same position, and I felt assured that I\r\nwas not mistaken. It would have required the united certificates of all\r\nthe population in the village, after that, to convince me that Pio was a\r\nCarib. But aside from this circumstance, which might by possibility have\r\nbeen accidental, neither the color, expression, nor structure of his\r\nface indicated Caribbean descent. On the contrary, the head was smaller,\r\nthe hair finer, the complexion several shades lighter, and the facial\r\nangle totally different. There was a much closer resemblance to Jew than\r\nto Gentile; indeed, the peculiar curve of the nose, and the Syrian leer\r\nof the eye, disclosed an Israelitish ancestry rather than an American.\r\n\r\nHaving settled these points in my own mind very rapidly, the Alcalde and\r\nI next chaffered a few moments over the price to be paid for Pio's\r\nservices. This was soon satisfactorily arranged, and the boy was\r\ndelivered into my charge. But before doing so formally, the Alcalde\r\ndeclared that I must never release him whilst in the woods or amongst\r\nthe ruins, or else he would escape, and fly back to his barbarian\r\nfriends, and the Holy Apostolic Church would lose a convert. He also\r\nadded, by way of epilogue, that if I permitted him to get away, his\r\nprice was _cien pesos_ (one hundred dollars).\r\n\r\nThe next two hours were devoted to preparations for a life in the\r\nforest. I obtained the services of two additional persons; one to cook\r\nand the other to assist in clearing away rubbish and stones from the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nMounting my mule, already heavily laden with provisions, mosquito bars,\r\nbedding, cooking utensils, etc., we turned our faces toward the\r\nsoutheast, and left the modern village of Palenque. For the first mile I\r\nobeyed strictly the injunctions of the Alcalde, and held Pio tightly by\r\nthe rope. But shortly afterwards we crossed a rapid stream, and on\r\nmounting the opposite bank, we entered a dense forest. The trees were of\r\na gigantic size, very lofty, and covered from trunk to top with\r\nparasites of every conceivable kind. The undergrowth was luxuriant, and\r\nin a few moments we found ourselves buried in a tomb of tropical\r\nvegetation. The light of the sun never penetrates those realms of\r\nperpetual shadow, and the atmosphere seems to take a shade from the\r\npervading gloom. Occasionally a bright-plumed songster would start up\r\nand dart through the inaccessible foliage, but more frequently we\r\ndisturbed snakes and lizards in our journey.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing several hundred yards of this primeval forest I called\r\na halt, and drew Pio close up to the side of my mule. Then, taking him\r\nby the shoulder, I wheeled him round quickly, and drawing a large knife\r\nwhich I had purchased to cut away the thick foliage in my exploration, I\r\ndeliberately severed the cords from his hands, and set him free. Instead\r\nof bounding off like a startled deer, as my attendants expected to see\r\nhim do, he seized my hand, pressed it respectfully between his own,\r\nraised the back of it to his forehead, and then imprinted a kiss betwixt\r\nthe thumb and forefinger. Immediately afterward, he began to whistle in\r\na sweet low tone, and taking the lead of the party, conducted us rapidly\r\ninto the heart of the forest.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded about seven or eight miles, crossing two or three small\r\nrivers in our way, when the guide suddenly throw up his hands, and\r\npointing to a huge pile of rubbish and ruins in the distance, exclaimed\r\n\"_El Palacio_!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first indication he had as yet given of his ability to\r\nspeak or to understand the Spanish, or, indeed, any tongue, and I was\r\ncongratulating myself upon the discovery, when he subsided into a\r\npainful silence, interrupted only by an occasional whistle, nor would he\r\nmake any intelligible reply to the simplest question.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on rapidly, and in a few moments more I stood upon the summit\r\nof the pyramidal structure, upon which, as a base, the ruins known as\r\n_El Palacio_ are situated.\r\n\r\nThese ruins have been so frequently described, that I deem it\r\nunnecessary to enter into any detailed account of them; especially as by\r\ndoing so but little progress would be made with the more important\r\nportions of this narrative. If, therefore, the reader be curious to get\r\na more particular insight into the form, size, and appearance of these\r\ncurious remains, let him consult the splendidly illuminated pages of Del\r\nRio, Waldeck, and Dupaix. Nor should Stephens and Catherwood be\r\nneglected; for though their explorations are less scientific and\r\nthorough than either of the others, yet being more modern, they will\r\nprove not less interesting.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nSeveral months had now elapsed since I swung my hammock in one of the\r\ncorridors of the old palace. The rainy season had vanished, and the hot\r\nweather once more set in for the summer. Still I worked on. I took\r\naccurate and correct drawings of every engraved entablature I could\r\ndiscover. With the assistance of my taciturn guide, nothing seemed to\r\nescape me. Certain am I that I was enabled to copy _basso-rilievos_\r\nnever seen by any of the great travelers whose works I had read; for\r\nPio seemed to know by intuition exactly where they were to be found. My\r\ncollection was far more complete than Mr. Catherwood's, and more\r\nfaithful to the original than Lord Kingsborough's. Pio leaned over my\r\nshoulder whilst I was engaged in drawing, and if I committed the\r\nslightest error his quick glance detected it at once, and a short, rough\r\nwhistle recalled my pencil back to its duty.\r\n\r\nFinally, I completed the last drawing I intended to make, and commenced\r\npreparations to leave my quarters, and select others affording greater\r\nfacilities for the study of the various problems connected with these\r\nmysterious hieroglyphics. I felt fully sensible of the immense toil\r\nbefore me, but having determined long since to devote my whole life to\r\nthe task of interpreting these silent historians of buried realms, hope\r\ngave me strength to venture upon the work, and the first step toward it\r\nhad just been successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nBut what were paintings, and drawings, and sketches, without some key to\r\nthe system of hieroglyphs, or some clue to the labyrinth, into which I\r\nhad entered? For hours I sat and gazed at the voiceless signs before me,\r\ndreaming of Champollion, and the _Rosetta Stone_, and vainly hoping that\r\nsome unheard-of miracle would be wrought in my favor, by which a single\r\nletter might be interpreted. But the longer I gazed, the darker became\r\nthe enigma, and the more difficult seemed its solution.\r\n\r\nI had not even the foundation, upon which Dr. Young, and Lepsius, and De\r\nLacy, and Champollion commenced. There were no living Copts, who spoke a\r\ndialect of the dead tongue in which the historian had engraved his\r\nannals. There were no descendants of the extinct nations, whose sole\r\nmemorials were the crumbling ruins before me. Time had left no teacher\r\nwhose lessons might result in success. Tradition even, with her\r\nuncertain light, threw no flickering glare around, by which the groping\r\narchæologist might weave an imaginary tale of the past.\r\n\r\n    \"Chaos of ruins, who shall trace the void,\r\n     O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,\r\n     And say, '_Here was_, _or is_,' where all is doubly night?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n   \"I must except, however, the attempt to explore an aqueduct,\r\n   which we made together. Within, it was perfectly dark, and we\r\n   could not move without candles. The sides were of smooth stones,\r\n   about four feet high, and the roof was made by stones lapping\r\n   over like the corridors of the buildings. At a short distance\r\n   from the entrance, the passage turned to the left, and at a\r\n   distance of one hundred and sixty feet it was completely blocked\r\n   up by the ruins of the roof which had fallen down.\"--INCIDENTS OF\r\n   TRAVEL IN CHIAPAS.\r\n\r\nOne day I had been unusually busy in arranging my drawings and forming\r\nthem into something like system, and toward evening, had taken my seat,\r\nas I always did, just in front of the large _basso-rilievo_ ornamenting\r\nthe main entrance into the corridor of the palace, when Pio approached\r\nme from behind and laid his hand upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\nNot having observed his approach, I was startled by the suddenness of\r\nthe contact, and sprang to my feet, half in surprise and half in alarm.\r\nHe had never before been guilty of such an act of impoliteness, and I\r\nwas on the eve of rebuking him for his conduct, when I caught the kind\r\nand intelligent expression of his eye, which at once disarmed me, and\r\nattracted most strongly my attention. Slowly raising his arm, he pointed\r\nwith the forefinger of his right hand to the entablature before us and\r\nbegan to whistle most distinctly, yet most musically, a low monody,\r\nwhich resembled the cadencial rise and fall of the voice in reading\r\npoetry. Occasionally, his tones would almost die entirely away, then\r\nrise very high, and then modulate themselves with the strictest regard\r\nto rhythmical measure. His finger ran rapidly over the hieroglyphics,\r\nfirst from left to right, and then from right to left.\r\n\r\nIn the utmost amazement I turned toward Pio, and demanded what he meant.\r\nIs this a musical composition, exclaimed I, that you seem to be reading?\r\nMy companion uttered no reply, but proceeded rapidly with his task. For\r\nmore than half an hour he was engaged in whistling down the double\r\ncolumn of hieroglyphics engraved upon the entablature before me. So soon\r\nas his task was accomplished, and without offering the slightest\r\nexplanation, he seized my hand and made a signal for me to follow.\r\n\r\nHaving provided himself with a box of lucifer matches and a fresh\r\ncandle, he placed the same implements in my possession, and started in\r\nadvance. I obeyed almost instinctively.\r\n\r\nWe passed into the innermost apartments of _El Palacio_, and approached\r\na cavernous opening into which Mr. Stephens had descended, and which he\r\nsupposed had been used as a tomb.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely high enough in the pitch to enable me to stand erect,\r\nand I felt a cool damp breeze pass over my brow, such as we sometimes\r\nencounter upon entering a vault.\r\n\r\nPio stopped and deliberately lighted his candle and beckoned me to do\r\nthe same. As soon as this was effected, he advanced into the darkest\r\ncorner of the dungeon, and stooping with his mouth to the floor, gave a\r\nlong, shrill whistle. The next moment, one of the paving-stones was\r\nraised _from within_, and I beheld an almost perpendicular stone\r\nstaircase leading down still deeper under ground. Calling me to his\r\nside, he pointed to the entrance and made a gesture for me to descend.\r\nMy feelings at this moment may be better imagined than described. My\r\nmemory ran back to the information given me by the Alcalde, that Pio was\r\na Carib, and I felt confident that he had confederates close at hand.\r\nThe Caribs, I well know, had never been christianized nor subdued, but\r\nroved about the adjacent swamps and fastnesses in their aboriginal\r\nstate. I had frequently read of terrible massacres perpetrated by them,\r\nand the dreadful fate of William Beanham, so thrillingly told by Mr.\r\nStephens in his second volume, uprose in my mind at this instant, with\r\nfearful distinctness. But then, thought I, what motive can this poor boy\r\nhave in alluring me to ruin? What harm have I done him? Plunder surely\r\ncannot be his object, for he was present when I intrusted all I\r\npossessed to the care of the Alcalde of the village. These\r\nconsiderations left my mind in equal balance, and I turned around to\r\nconfront my companion, and draw a decision from the expression of his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nOne look reassured me at once. A playful smile wreathed his lips, and\r\nlightened over his face a gleam of real benevolence, not unmixed, as I\r\nthought, with pity. Hesitating no longer, I preceded him into those\r\nrealms of subterranean night. Down, down, down, I trod, until there\r\nseemed no bottom to the echoing cavern. Each moment the air grew\r\nheavier, and our candles began to flicker and grow dimmer, as the\r\nimpurities of the confined atmosphere became more and more perceptible.\r\nMy head felt lighter, and began to swim. My lungs respired with greater\r\ndifficulty, and my knees knocked and jostled, as though faint from\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nStill there seemed no end to the descent. Tramp, tramp, tramp, I heard\r\nthe footsteps of my guide behind me, and I vainly explored the darkness\r\nbefore. At length we reached a broad even platform, covered over with\r\nthe peculiar tiling found among these ruins. As soon as Pio reached the\r\nlanding-place, he beckoned me to be seated on the stone steps, which I\r\nwas but too glad to do. He at once followed my example, and seemed no\r\nless rejoiced than I that the descent had been safely accomplished.\r\n\r\nI once descended from the summit of Bunker Hill Monument, and counted\r\nthe steps, from the top to the bottom. That number I made 465. The\r\nestimate of the depth of this cavern, made at the time, led me to\r\nbelieve that it was nearly equal to the height of that column. But there\r\nwas no railing by which to cling, and no friend to interrupt my fall, in\r\ncase of accident. _Pio was behind me!_\r\n\r\nAfter I became somewhat rested from the fatigue, my curiosity returned\r\nwith tenfold force, and I surveyed the apartment with real pleasure. It\r\nwas perfectly circular, and was about fifteen feet in diameter, and ten\r\nfeet high. The walls seemed to be smooth, except a close, damp coating\r\nof moss, that age and humidity had fastened upon them.\r\n\r\nI could perceive no exit, except the one by which we had reached it.\r\n\r\nBut I was not permitted to remain long in doubt on this point; for Pio\r\nsoon rose, walked to the side of the chamber exactly opposite the\r\nstairs, whistled shrilly, as before, and an aperture immediately\r\nmanifested itself, large enough to admit the body of a man! Through this\r\nhe crawled, and beckoned me to follow. No sooner had I crept through the\r\nwall, than the stone dropped from above, and closed the orifice\r\ncompletely. I now found myself standing erect in what appeared to be a\r\nsubterranean aqueduct. It was precisely of the same size, with a flat,\r\ncemented floor, shelving sides, and circular, or rather _Aztec-arched_\r\nroof. The passage was not straight, but wound about with frequent\r\nturnings as far as we pursued it.\r\n\r\nWhy these curves were made, I never ascertained, although afterward I\r\ngave the subject much attention. We started down the aqueduct at a brisk\r\npace, our candles being frequently extinguished by fresh drafts of air,\r\nthat struck us at almost every turn. Whenever they occurred, we paused a\r\nmoment, to reillume them, and then hastened on, as silently and swiftly\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing at least five or six miles of this passage,\r\noccasionally passing arched chambers like that at the foot of the\r\nstaircase, we suddenly reached the termination of the aqueduct, which\r\nwas an apartment the _fac-simile_ of the one at the other end of it.\r\nHere also we observed a stone stairway, and my companion at once began\r\nthe ascent. During our journey through the long arched way behind us, we\r\nfrequently passed through rents, made possibly by earthquakes, and more\r\nthan once were compelled to crawl through openings half filled with\r\nrubbish, sand and stones. Nor was the road dry in all places. Indeed,\r\ngenerally, the floor was wet, and twice we forded small brooks that ran\r\ndirectly across the path. Behind us, and before, we could distinctly\r\nhear the water dripping from the ceiling, and long before we reached the\r\nend of the passage, our clothing had been completely saturated. It was,\r\ntherefore, with great and necessary caution, that I followed my guide up\r\nthe slippery stairs. Our ascent was not so tedious as our descent had\r\nbeen, nor was the distance apparently more than half so great to the\r\nsurface. Pio paused a moment at the head of the stairway, extinguished\r\nhis candle, and then requested me by a gesture to do likewise. When this\r\nwas accomplished, he touched a spring and the trap-door flew open,\r\n_upwards_. The next instant I found myself standing in a chamber but\r\ndimly lighted from above. We soon emerged into open daylight, and there,\r\nfor the first time since the conquest of Mexico by Cortes, the eyes of a\r\nwhite man rested upon the gigantic ruins of _La Casa Grande_.\r\n\r\nThese ruins are far more extensive than any yet explored by travelers in\r\nCentral America. Hitherto, they have entirely escaped observation. The\r\nnatives of the country are not even aware of their existence, and it\r\nwill be many years before they are visited by the curious.\r\n\r\nBut here they were, a solid reality! Frowning on the surrounding gloom\r\nof the forest, and the shadows of approaching night, they stretched out\r\non every side, like the bodies of dead giants slain in battle with the\r\nTitans.\r\n\r\nDaylight was nearly gone, and it soon became impossible to see anything\r\nwith distinctness. For the first time, the peculiarity of my lonely\r\nsituation forced itself upon my attention. I was alone with the Carib\r\nboy. I had not even brought my side-arms with me, and I know that it was\r\nnow too late to make any attempt to escape through the forest. The idea\r\nof returning by the subterranean aqueduct never crossed my mind as a\r\npossibility; for my nerves flinched at the bare thought of the shrill\r\nwhistle of Pio, and the mysterious obedience of the stones.\r\n\r\nWhilst revolving these unpleasant ideas through my brain, the boy\r\napproached me respectfully, opened a small knapsack that I had not\r\nbefore observed he carried, and offered me some food. Hungry and\r\nfatigued as I was, I could not eat; the same peculiar smile passed over\r\nhis features; he rose and left me for a moment, returned, and offered me\r\na gourd of water. After drinking, I felt greatly refreshed, and\r\nendeavored to draw my companion into a conversation. But all to no\r\npurpose. He soon fell asleep, and I too, ere long, was quietly reposing\r\nin the depths of the forest.\r\n\r\nIt may seem remarkable that the ruins of _Casa Grande_ have never been\r\ndiscovered, as yet, by professional travelers. But it requires only a\r\nslight acquaintance with the characteristics of the surrounding country,\r\nand a peep into the intricacies of a tropical forest, to dispel at once\r\nall wonder on this subject. These ruins are situated about five miles in\r\na westerly direction from those known as _El Palacio_, and originally\r\nconstituted a part of the same city. They are as much more grand and\r\nextensive than those of _El Palacio_ as those are than the remains at\r\nUxmal, or Copan. In fact, they are gigantic, and reminded me forcibly of\r\nthe great Temple of Karnak, on the banks of the Nile. But they lie\r\nburied in the fastnesses of a tropical forest. One half of them is\r\nentombed in a sea of vegetation, and it would require a thousand men\r\nmore than a whole year to clear away the majestic groves that shoot up\r\nlike sleepless sentinels from court-yard and corridor, send their\r\nfantastic roots into the bedchamber of royalty, and drop their annual\r\nfoliage upon pavements where princes once played in their infancy, and\r\ncourtiers knelt in their pride. A thousand vines and parasites are\r\nclimbing in every direction, over portal and pillar, over corridor and\r\nsacrificial shrine. So deeply shrouded in vegetation are these awful\r\nmemorials of dead dynasties, that a traveler might approach within a few\r\nsteps of the pyramidal mound, upon which they are built, and yet be\r\ntotally unaware of their existence. I cannot convey a better idea of the\r\ndifficulties attending a discovery and explanation of these ruins than\r\nto quote what Mr. Stephens has said of _El Palacio_. \"The whole country\r\nfor miles around is covered by a dense forest of gigantic trees, with a\r\ngrowth of brush and underwood unknown in the wooded deserts of our own\r\ncountry, and impenetrable in any direction, except by cutting away with\r\na machete. What lies buried in that forest it is impossible to say of my\r\nown knowledge. Without a guide we might have gone within a hundred feet\r\nof all the buildings without discovering one of them.\"\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nI awoke with a start and a shudder. Something cold and damp seemed to\r\nhave touched my forehead, and left a chill that penetrated into my\r\nbrain. How long I had been asleep, I have no means of ascertaining; but\r\njudging from natural instinct, I presume it was near midnight when I\r\nawoke. I turned my head toward my companion, and felt some relief on\r\nbeholding him just where he had fallen asleep. He was breathing heavily,\r\nand was completely buried in unconsciousness. When I was fully aroused I\r\nfelt most strangely. I had never experienced the same sensation but once\r\nbefore in my whole life, and that was whilst in company with Judge E----\r\non the stone ramparts of _Castillo Viejo_.\r\n\r\nI was lying flat upon my back, with my left hand resting gently on my\r\nnaked right breast, and my right hand raised perpendicularly from my\r\nbody. The arm rested on the elbow and was completely paralyzed, or in\r\ncommon parlance, asleep.\r\n\r\nOn opening my eyes, I observed that the full moon was in mid-heavens,\r\nand the night almost as bright as day. I could distinctly see the\r\nfeatures of Pio, and even noticed the regular rise and fall of his\r\nbosom, as the tides of life ebbed and flowed into his lungs. The huge\r\nold forest trees, that had been standing amid the ruins for unnumbered\r\ncenturies, loomed up into the moonshine, hundreds of feet above me, and\r\ncast their deep black shadows upon the pale marbles, on whose fragments\r\nI was reposing.\r\n\r\nAll at once, I perceived that my hand and arm were in rapid motion. It\r\nrested on the elbow as a fulcrum, and swayed back and forth, round and\r\nround, with great ease and celerity. Perfectly satisfied that it moved\r\nwithout any effort of my own will, I was greatly puzzled to arrive at\r\nany satisfactory solution of the phenomenon. The idea crossed my mind\r\nthat the effect was of _spiritual_ origin, and that I had become\r\nself-magnetized. I had read and believed that the two sides of the human\r\nframe are differently electrified, and the curious phases of the disease\r\ncalled _paralysis_ sufficiently established the dogma, that one half the\r\nbody may die, and yet the other half live on. I had many times\r\nexperimented on the human hand, and the philosophical fact had long been\r\ndemonstrated, to my own satisfaction, that the inside of the hand is\r\ntotally different from the outside. If we desire to ascertain the\r\ntemperature of any object, we instinctively touch it with the inside of\r\nthe fingers; on the contrary, if we desire to ascertain our own\r\ntemperature, we do so by laying the back of the hand upon some isolated\r\nand indifferent object. Convinced, therefore, that the right and left\r\nsides of the human body are differently magnetized, I was not long in\r\nfinding a solution of the peculiar phenomenon, which at first\r\nastonished me so greatly. In fact, my body had become an electrical\r\nmachine, and by bringing the two poles into contact, as was affected by\r\nlinking my right and left sides together, by means of my left hand, a\r\nbattery had been formed, and the result was, the paralysis or\r\nmagnetization of my right arm and hand, such being precisely the effect\r\ncaused by a _spiritual circle_,--as it has been denominated. My arm and\r\nhand represented, in all respects, a table duly charged, and the same\r\nphenomenon could be produced, if I was right in my conjectures.\r\n\r\nImmediately, therefore, I set about testing the truth of this\r\nhypothesis. I asked, half aloud, if there were any spirits present. My\r\nhand instantly closed, except the forefinger, and gave three distinctive\r\njerks that almost elevated my elbow from its position. A negative reply\r\nwas soon given to a subsequent question by a single jerk of the hand;\r\nand thus I was enabled to hold a conversation in monosyllables with my\r\ninvisible companions.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to detail the whole of the interview which followed. I\r\nwill only add that portion of it which is intimately connected with this\r\nnarrative. Strange as it may appear, I had until this moment forgotten\r\nall about the beautiful apparition that appeared and disappeared so\r\nmysteriously at _Castillo Viejo_. All at once, however, the recollection\r\nrevived, and I remembered the promise contained in the single word she\r\nmurmured, \"Palenque!\"\r\n\r\nOvermastering my excitement, I whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful spirit, that once met me on the ramparts where Lord Nelson\r\nfought and conquered, art thou here?\"\r\n\r\nAn affirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\"Will you appear and redeem your promise?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the branches of the neighboring trees waved and nodded; the\r\ncold marbles about me seemed animated with life, and crashed and struck\r\neach other with great violence; the old pyramid trembled to its centre,\r\nas if shaken by an earthquake; and the forest around moaned as though a\r\ntempest was sweeping by. At the same instant, full in the bright\r\nmoonlight, and standing within three paces of my feet, appeared the\r\nAztec Princess, whose waving _panache_, flowing garments and benignant\r\ncountenance had bewildered me many months before, on the moss-grown\r\nparapet of _Castillo Viejo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n      \"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth\r\n       Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep.\"\r\n\r\n                                       --PARADISE LOST.\r\n\r\nWas I dreaming, or was the vision real, that my eyes beheld? This was\r\nthe first calm thought that coursed through my brain, after the terror\r\nand amazement had subsided. Awe-struck I certainly was, when the\r\nbeautiful phantom first rose upon my sight, at Castillo; awe-struck once\r\nmore, when she again appeared, amid the gray old rains of _Casa Grande_.\r\nI have listened very often to the surmises of others, as they detailed\r\nwhat _they_ would do, were a supernatural being to rise up suddenly\r\nbefore them. Some have said, they would gaze deliberately into the face\r\nof the phantom, scan its every feature, and coolly note down, for the\r\nbenefit of others, how long it \"walked,\" and in what manner it faded\r\nfrom the sight. The nerves of these very men trembled while they spoke,\r\nand had an apparition burst at that instant into full view, these heroes\r\nin imagination would have crouched and hid their faces, their teeth\r\nchattering with terror, and their hearts beating their swelling sides,\r\nas audibly as the convict hears his own when the hangman draws the black\r\ncap over his unrepentant head.\r\n\r\nI blame no man for yielding to the dictates of Nature. He is but a fool\r\nwho feels no fear, and hears not a warning in the wind, observes not a\r\nsign in the heavens, and perceives no admonition in the air, when\r\nhurricanes are brooding, clouds are gathering, or earthquakes muttering\r\nin his ears. The sane mind listens, and thwarts danger by its\r\napprehensions.\r\n\r\nThe true hero is not the man who knows no fear--for that were\r\nidiotic--but he who sees it, and escapes it, or meets it bravely. Was it\r\ncourage in the elder Pliny to venture so closely to the crater of\r\nVesuvius, whilst in eruption, that he lost his life? How can man make\r\nwar with the elements, or battle with his God?\r\n\r\nThere is, in the secret chambers of every human heart, one dark weird\r\ncell, over whose portal is inscribed--MYSTERY. There Superstition sits\r\nupon her throne; there Idolatry shapes her monsters, and there Religion\r\nreveals her glories. Within that cell, the soul communes with itself\r\nmost intimately, confesses its midnight cowardice, and in low whispers\r\nmutters its dread of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nAll races, all nations, and all times have felt its influences, oozing\r\nlike imperceptible dews from the mouth of that dark cavern.\r\n\r\nVishnu heard its deep mutterings in the morning of our race, and they\r\nstill sound hollow but indistinct, like clods upon a coffin-lid, along\r\nthe wave of each generation, as it rises and rolls into the past. Plato\r\nand Numa and Cicero and Brutus listened to its prophetic cadences, as\r\nthey fell upon their ears. Mohammed heard them in his cave, Samuel\r\nJohnson in his bed. Poets have caught them in the\r\n\r\n    \"Shivering whisper of startled leaves,\"\r\n\r\nmartyrs in the crackling faggots, heroes amid the din of battle.\r\n\r\nIf you ask, what means this voice? I reply,\r\n\r\n    \"A solemn murmur in the soul\r\n       _Tells of the world to be_,\r\n     As travelers hear the billows roll\r\n       Before they reach the sea.\"\r\n\r\nLet no man, therefore, boast that he has no dread of the supernatural.\r\nWhen mortal can look spirit in the face, without blanching, man will be\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nTo convince myself that I did not dream, I rose upon my elbow, and\r\nreclined for a moment in that attitude. Gradually I gained my feet, and\r\nthen stood confronting the Aztec maiden. The midnight breeze of the\r\ntropics had set in, and by the clear moonlight I distinctly saw the\r\n_panache_ of feathers that she wore upon her head swaying gracefully\r\nupon the air.\r\n\r\nConvinced now, beyond all doubt, that the scene was real, the ruling\r\ndesire of my life came back in full force upon me, and I spoke, in a\r\nhoarse whisper, the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Here lies a buried realm; I would be its historian!\"\r\n\r\nThe apparition, without any reply in words, glided toward me, and\r\napproached so close that I could easily have touched her had I dared.\r\nBut a sense of propriety subdued all unhallowed curiosity, and I\r\ndetermined to submit passively to all that my new friend should do. This\r\nstate of mind seemed at once known to her, for she smiled approvingly,\r\nand came still nearer to where I stood.\r\n\r\nElevating her beautiful arm, she passed it gently over my face, her hand\r\njust touching my features, and imparting a cool sensation to my skin. I\r\ndistinctly remember that the hand felt damp. No sooner was this done\r\nthan my nervous system seemed to be restored to its usual tone, and\r\nevery sensation of alarm vanished.\r\n\r\nMy brain began to feel light and swimmy, and my whole frame appeared to\r\nbe losing its weight. This peculiar sensation gradually increased in\r\nintensity until full conviction flashed upon me that I could, by an\r\neffort of will, rise into the air, and fly with all the ease and\r\nrapidity of an eagle.\r\n\r\nThe idea was no sooner fully conceived, than I noticed a wavy, unsteady\r\nmotion in the figure of the Aztec Princess, and almost immediately\r\nafterwards, I perceived that she was gradually rising from the broken\r\npavement upon which she had been standing, and passing slowly upwards\r\nthrough the branches of the overshadowing trees. What was most\r\nremarkable, the relative distance between us did not seem to increase,\r\nand my amazement was inconceivable, when on casting my eyes toward my\r\nfeet, I perceived that I was elevated more than twenty yards from the\r\npavement where I had slept.\r\n\r\nMy ascent had been so gradual, that I was entirely unaware of moving,\r\nand now that I became sensible of it, the motion itself was still\r\nimperceptible. Upward, still upward, I was carried, until the tallest\r\nlimbs of the loftiest trees had been left far below me. Still the ascent\r\ncontinued. A wide and beautiful panorama now opened before me. Above,\r\nall was flashing moonlight and starry radiance. The beams of the full\r\nmoon grew more brilliant as we cleared the vapory atmosphere contiguous\r\nto the earth, until they shone with half the splendor of morn, and\r\nglanced upon the features of my companion with a mellow sheen, that\r\nheightened a thousandfold her supermundane beauty. Below, the gray old\r\nrelics of a once populous capital glimmered spectrally in the distance,\r\nlooking like tombs, shrouded by a weeping forest; whilst one by one, the\r\nmourners lost their individuality, and ere long presented but a dark\r\nmass of living green. After having risen several hundred feet\r\nperpendicularly, I was enabled to form an estimate of the extent of the\r\nforest, in the bosom of which sleep and moulder the monuments of the\r\naboriginal Americans. There is no such forest existing elsewhere on the\r\nsurface of this great globe. It has no parallel in nature. The Black\r\nForest of Germany, the Thuringian Forest of Saxony, the Cross Timbers of\r\nTexas, the dense and inaccessible woods cloaking the headwaters of the\r\nAmazon and the La Plata, are mere parks in comparison. For miles and\r\nmiles, leagues and leagues, it stretched out--north, south, east and\r\nwest. It covers an area larger than the island of Great Britain; and\r\nthroughout this immense extent of country there is but one mountain\r\nchain, and but one river. The summits of this range have been but seldom\r\nseen by white men, and have never been scaled. The river drains the\r\nwhole territory, but loses itself in a terrific marsh before its tide\r\nreaches the Mexican gulf, toward which it runs. The current is\r\nexceedingly rapid; and, after passing for hundreds of miles under the\r\nland and under the sea, it unites its submarine torrent near the west\r\nend of Cuba, with that of the Orinoco and the Amazon, and thus forms\r\nthat great oceanic river called the Gulf Stream. Professor Maury was\r\nright in his philosophic conjecture as to the origin of that mighty and\r\nresistless tide.\r\n\r\nHaving attained a great height perpendicularly above the spot of our\r\ndeparture, we suddenly dashed off with the speed of an express\r\nlocomotive, toward the northeast.\r\n\r\nWhither we were hastening, I knew not; nor did I trouble my mind with\r\nany useless conjectures. I felt secure in the power of my companion, and\r\nsure of her protection. I knew that by some unaccountable process she\r\nhad neutralized the gravitating force of a material body, had elevated\r\nme hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feet in the atmosphere, and by some\r\nmysterious charm was attracting me toward a distant bourne. Years\r\nbefore, whilst a medical student at the University of Louisiana, the\r\nprofessor of _materia medica_ had opened his course of lectures with an\r\ninquiry into the origin and essence of gravitation, and I had listened\r\nrespectfully, but at that time doubtingly, to the theory he propounded.\r\nHe stated that it was not unphilosophical to believe that the time would\r\narrive when the gravitating power of dense bodies would be overcome, and\r\nballoons constructed to navigate the air with the same unerring\r\ncertainty that ships traversed the ocean.\r\n\r\nHe declared that gravitation itself was not a _cause_ but an _effect_;\r\nthat it might be produced by the rotation of the earth upon its axis, or\r\nby some undiscovered current of electricity, or by some recondite and\r\nhitherto undetected agent or force in nature. Magnetism he thought a\r\nspecies of electricity, and subsequent investigations have convinced me\r\nthat _sympathy_ or _animal magnetism_ was akin to the same parent power.\r\nBy means of this latter agent I had seen the human body rendered so\r\nlight that two persons could raise it with a single finger properly\r\napplied. More than this, I had but recently witnessed at Castillo, dead\r\nmatter clothed with life and motion, and elevated several feet into the\r\nair without the aid of any human agency. This age I knew well to be an\r\nage of wonders. Nature was yielding up her secrets on every hand; the\r\nboundary between the natural and the spiritual had been broken down; new\r\nworlds were flashing upon the eyes of the followers of Galileo almost\r\nnightly from the ocean depths of space. Incalculable treasures had been\r\ndiscovered in the most distant ends of the earth, and I, unlettered hind\r\nthat I was, did not presume to limit the power of the great Creator, and\r\nbecause an act seemed impossible to my narrow vision, and within my\r\nlimited experience, to cry aloud, _imposture_, or to mutter sneeringly,\r\n_insanity_.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther with the thread of this narrative, the\r\nattention of the reader is solicited to the careful perusal of the\r\nfollowing extracts from Stephens's _Travels in Central America, Chiapas\r\nand Yucatan_, published at New York in 1841.\r\n\r\n   But the Padre told us more; something that increased our\r\n   excitement to the highest pitch. On the other side of the great\r\n   traversing range of Cordilleras lies the district of Vera Paz,\r\n   once called Tierra de Guerra, or land of war, from the warlike\r\n   character of its aboriginal inhabitants. Three times the\r\n   Spaniards were driven back in their attempt to conquer it.[A-133]\r\n\r\n   The rest of the Tierra de Guerra never was conquered; and at this\r\n   day the northeastern section bounded by the range of the\r\n   Cordilleras and the State of Chiapa is occupied by Cadones, or\r\n   unbaptized Indians, who live as their fathers did, acknowledging\r\n   no submission to the Spaniards, and the government of Central\r\n   America does not pretend to exercise any control over them. But\r\n   the thing that roused us was the assertion by the Padre that four\r\n   days on the road to Mexico, on the other side of the Great\r\n   Sierra, was a LIVING CITY, large and populous, occupied by\r\n   Indians, precisely in the same state as before the discovery of\r\n   America. He had heard of it many years before, at the village of\r\n   Chajal, and was told by the villagers that from the topmost\r\n   ridge of the Sierra this city was distinctly visible. He was then\r\n   young, and with much labor climbed to the naked summit of the\r\n   Sierra, from which, at a height of ten or twelve thousand feet,\r\n   he looked over an immense plain extending to Yucatan and the Gulf\r\n   of Mexico, and saw at a great distance a large city, spread over\r\n   a great space, and with turrets white and glittering in the sun.\r\n   The traditionary account of the Indians of Chajal is, that no\r\n   white man has ever reached the city; that the inhabitants speak\r\n   the Maya language; are aware that a race of strangers has\r\n   conquered the whole country around, and murder any white man who\r\n   attempts to enter their territory. They have no coin or other\r\n   circulating medium; no horses, cattle, mules, or other domestic\r\n   animals, except fowls, and the cocks they keep under ground to\r\n   prevent their crowing being heard.[B-134]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A-133: Page 193, Vol. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B-134: Ibid. Page 195.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens then adds:\r\n\r\n   One look at that city is worth ten years of an every-day life. If\r\n   he is right, a place is left where Indians and an Indian city\r\n   exist as Cortez and Alvarado found them. There are living men who\r\n   can solve the mystery that hangs over the ruined cities of\r\n   America; perhaps, who can go to Copan and Palenque and read the\r\n   inscriptions on their monuments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moon, long past the meridian, was sinking slowly to her western\r\ngoal, whilst the east was already beginning to blush and redden with the\r\ndawn. Before us rose high and clear three distinct mountain peaks,\r\ncovered with a mantle of snow. I began to tremble with cold. But our\r\npace did not slacken, nor our altitude diminish. On the contrary, we\r\nbegan to rise gradually, until we found ourselves nearly upon a level\r\nwith the three peaks. Selecting an opening or gap betwixt the two\r\nwesternmost, we glided through like the wind. I shivered and my teeth\r\nchattered as we skimmed along those everlasting snows. Here, thought I,\r\nthe condor builds his nest in summer, and the avalanches find a home.\r\nThe eagle's wing has not strength enough to battle with this thin and\r\nfreezing atmosphere, and no living thing but \"the proud bird, the condor\r\nof the Andes,\" ever scaled these hoary summits. But our descent had\r\nalready commenced. Gradually, as the morning broke, the region of ice\r\nand snow was left behind us, and just as the first ray of the rising sun\r\nshot over the peaks we had but a moment before surmounted, I beheld,\r\nglittering in the dim and shadowy distance, the white walls of a\r\nmagnificent city. An exclamation of surprise and pleasure involuntarily\r\nescaped my lips; but one glance at my companion checked all further\r\nutterance. She raised her rounded forefinger to her lip, and made a\r\ngesture, whose purport I well understood.\r\n\r\nWe swept over forests and cornfields and vineyards, the city growing\r\nupon the vision every moment, and rising like the Mexican capital, when\r\nfirst beheld by Europeans from the bosom of a magnificent lake. Finally,\r\nwe found ourselves immediately above it, and almost at the same moment,\r\nbegan to descend. In a few seconds I stood alone, in a large open space,\r\nsurrounded upon all sides by lofty stone edifices, erected upon huge\r\npyramidal structures, that resembled the forest-covered mounds at\r\nPalenque. The day had fully dawned, but I observed no inhabitants.\r\nPresently a single individual appeared upon one of the towers near me,\r\nand gave a loud, shrill whistle, such as we sometimes hear in crowded\r\ntheatres. In an instant it was echoed and re-echoed a thousand times,\r\nupon every side, and immediately the immense city seemed to be awake, as\r\nif by magic. They poured by thousands into the open square, where I\r\nstood petrified with astonishment. Before me, like a vision of\r\nmidnight, marched by, in almost countless throngs, battalion on\r\nbattalion of a race of men deemed and recorded extinct by the wisest\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nThey presented the most picturesque appearance imaginable, dressed\r\napparently in holiday attire, and keeping step to a low air, performed\r\non instruments emitting a dull, confused sound, that seldom rose so as\r\nto be heard at any great distance.\r\n\r\nThey continued promenading the square, until the first level ray of\r\nsunshine fell upon the great Teocallis--as it was designated by the\r\nSpaniards--then with unanimous action they fell upon their faces,\r\nstriking their foreheads three times upon the mosaic pavement. Just as\r\nthey rose to their feet, I observed four persons, most gorgeously\r\ndressed, descending the steps of the Temple, bearing a palanquin, in\r\nwhich sat a single individual. My attention was at once arrested by her\r\nappearance, for she was a woman. She was arrayed in a _panache_, or\r\nhead-dress, made entirely of the plumage of the _Quezale_, the royal\r\nbird of Quiche. It was by far the most tasteful and becoming ornament to\r\nthe head I ever beheld, besides being the most magnificent. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the graceful movement of those waving plumes, as\r\nthey were stirred by the slightest inclination of the head, or the\r\nsoftest aspiration of the breeze. But the effect was greatly heightened\r\nby the constant change of color which they underwent. Blue and crimson,\r\nand orange and gold, were so blended that the eye was equally dazzled\r\nand delighted. But the utmost astonishment pervaded me, when, upon\r\nclosely scrutinizing her features, I thought I recognized the beautiful\r\nface of the Aztec Princess. Little leisure, however, was afforded me for\r\nthis purpose, for no sooner had her subjects, the assembled thousands,\r\nbowed with deferential respect to their sovereign, than a company of\r\ndrilled guards marched up to where I stood, and unresistingly made me\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to attempt a full description of the imposing ceremony I\r\nhad witnessed, or to portray the appearance of those who took the most\r\nprominent parts. Their costume corresponded precisely with that of the\r\nfigures in _bas-relief_ on the sculptured monuments at Palenque. Each\r\nwore a gorgeous head-dress, generally of feathers, carried an instrument\r\ndecorated with ribbons, feathers and skins, which appeared to be a\r\nwar-club, and wore huge sashes of yellow, green, or crimson cotton\r\ncloth, knotted before and behind, and falling in graceful folds almost\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nHitherto not a word had been spoken. The ceremony I had witnessed was a\r\nreligious one, and was at once interpreted by me to be the worship of\r\nthe sun. I remembered well that the ancient Peruvians were heliolaters,\r\nand my imagination had been dazzled when but a child by the gorgeous\r\ndescription given by the historian Robertson, of the great Temple of the\r\nSun at Cuzco. There the Incas had worshiped the God of Day from the\r\nperiod when Manco Capac came from the distant Island of Oello, and\r\ntaught the native Indians the rudiments of civilization, until the life\r\nof the last scion of royal blood was sacrificed to the perfidy of the\r\nSpanish invaders. These historical facts had long been familiar to my\r\nmind; but I did not recollect any facts going to show that the ancient\r\nAztecs were likewise heliolaters; but further doubt was now impossible.\r\n\r\nIn perfect silence I was hurried up the stone steps of the great\r\nTeocallis, toward the palace erected upon its summit, into whose broad\r\nand lofty corridors we soon entered. These we traversed in several\r\ndirections, leaving the more outward and gradually approaching the\r\nheart or central apartments.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was ushered into one of the most magnificently decorated\r\naudience-chambers that the eye of man ever beheld.\r\n\r\nWe were surrounded by immense tablets of _bas-reliefs_ sculptured in\r\nwhite and black marble, and presenting, evidently, a connected history\r\nof the ancient heroes of the race. Beside each tablet triple rows of\r\nhieroglyphics were carved in the solid stone, unquestionably giving in\r\ndetail the history of the hero or chief whose likeness stood near them.\r\nMany of these appeared to be females, but, judging from the sceptre each\r\ncarried, I was persuaded that the old _Salique_ law of France and other\r\nEuropean nations never was acknowledged by the aboriginal Americans.\r\n\r\nThe roof was high, and decorated with the plumage of the Quezale and\r\nother tropical birds, whilst a throne was erected in the centre of the\r\napartment, glittering in gold and silver ornaments, hung about with\r\nbeautiful shells, and lined with the skins of the native leopard,\r\nprepared in the most exquisite style.\r\n\r\nSeated upon a throne, I recognized the princess whose morning devotions\r\nI had just witnessed. At a gesture, I was carried up close to the foot\r\nof the throne.\r\n\r\nAfter closely inspecting her features, I satisfied myself that she was\r\nnot the companion of my mysterious journey, being several years older in\r\nappearance, and of a darker complexion. Still, there was a very striking\r\nresemblance between them, and it was evident that they not only belonged\r\nto the same race, but to the same family. I looked up at her with great\r\nrespect, anticipating some encouraging word or sign. But instead of\r\nspeaking, she commenced a low, melodious whistle, eying me intently\r\nduring the whole time. Ceasing, she evidently anticipated some reply on\r\nmy part, and I at once accosted her in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Most beautiful Princess, I am not voluntarily an invader of your realm.\r\nI was transported hither in a manner as mysterious as it was unexpected.\r\nTeach me but to read these hieroglyphics, and I will quit your\r\nterritories forever.\"\r\n\r\nA smile flitted across the features of the Princess as I uttered these\r\nwords; and she gave an order, by a sharp whistle, to an officer that\r\nstood near, who immediately disappeared. In a few moments, he returned,\r\nbringing with him a native dressed very coarsely in white cotton cloth,\r\nand who carried an empty jar, or water tank, upon his head. He was\r\nevidently a laborer, and, judging from the low obeisances he constantly\r\nmade, much to the amusement of the courtiers standing around, I am\r\nsatisfied that he never before in his whole life had been admitted to\r\nthe presence of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nMaking a gesture to the officer who had introduced him, he spoke a few\r\nlow words to the native, who immediately turned toward me, and uttered,\r\nslowly and distinctly, the following sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Ix-itl hua-atl zi-petl poppicobatl.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head despairingly. Several other attempts to communicate with\r\nme were made, both by the Princess and the interpreter, but all to no\r\npurpose. I could neither understand the melodies nor the jargon. But I\r\nnoticed throughout all these proceedings that there seemed to be two\r\nentirely distinct modes of expression; the first by whistling, and the\r\nsecond by utterance. The idea at once flashed across my mind, that there\r\nwere two languages used in the country--one sacred to the blood royal\r\nand the nobility, and the other used by the common people. Impressed\r\nwith this thought, I immediately set about verifying it by experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to detail the ingenious methods I devised to ascertain\r\nthis fact. It is sufficient for the present purposes of this narrative\r\nto state, that, during the day, I was abundantly satisfied with the\r\ntruth of my surmise; and that, before night, I learned another fact,\r\nequally important, that the hieroglyphics were written in the royal\r\ntongue, and could be read only by those connected by ties of blood with\r\nthe reigning family.\r\n\r\nThere was at first something ludicrous in the idea of communicating\r\nthought by sound emitted in the way indicated above. In my wildest\r\ndreams, the notion of such a thing being possible had never occurred to\r\nmy imagination. And when the naked fact was now demonstrated to me every\r\nmoment, I could scarcely credit my senses. Still, when I reflected that\r\nnight upon it, after I retired to rest, the system did not appear\r\nunnatural, nor even improbable. Birds, I knew, made use of the same\r\nmusical tongue; and when but a boy, on the shores of the distant\r\nAlbemarle, I had often listened, till long after midnight, to the\r\nwonderful loquacity of the common mocking-bird, as she poured forth her\r\nsummer strains. Who has not heard the turtle dove wooing her mate in\r\ntones that were only not human, because they were more sadly beautiful?\r\nMany a belated traveler has placed his hand upon his sword-hilt, and\r\nlooked suspiciously behind him, as the deep bass note of the owl has\r\nstartled the dewy air. The cock's crow has become a synonym for a pæan\r\nof triumph.\r\n\r\nRemembering all those varieties in sound that the air is capable of,\r\nwhen _cut_, as it were, by whistling, I no longer doubted that a\r\nlanguage could easily be constructed by analyzing the several tones and\r\ngiving value to their different modulations.\r\n\r\nThe ludicrousness of the idea soon gave place to admiration, and before\r\nI had been domiciliated in the palace of the Princess a month, I had\r\nbecome perfectly infatuated with her native language, and regarded it as\r\nthe most beautiful and expressive ever spoken by man. And now, after\r\nseveral years have elapsed since its melodious accents have fallen upon\r\nmy ears, I hesitate not to assert that for richness and variety of tone,\r\nfor force and depth of expression, for harmony and sweetness--in short,\r\nfor all those characteristics that give beauty and strength to spoken\r\nthought--the royal tongue of the aboriginal Americans is without a\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nFor many days after my mysterious appearance in the midst of the great\r\ncity I have described, my fate still hung in the balance. I was examined\r\nand re-examined a hundred times as to the mode of my entrance into the\r\nvalley; but I always persisted in making the same gestures, and pointed\r\nto the sky as the region whence I had descended. The guards stationed at\r\nevery avenue of entrance and exit were summoned to the capital, and\r\nquestioned closely as to the probability of my having passed them\r\nunawares; but they fully exculpated themselves from all blame, and were\r\nrestored to their forfeited posts.\r\n\r\nGradually the excitement in the city subsided, and one by one the great\r\nnobles were won over to credit the story of my celestial arrival in\r\ntheir midst, and I believed the great object of my existence in a fair\r\nway to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nEvery facility was afforded me to learn the royal tongue, and after a\r\nlittle more than a year's residence in the palace, I spoke it with\r\nconsiderable fluency and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBut all my efforts hitherto were vain to obtain a key to the\r\nhieroglyphics. Not only was the offense capital to teach their alphabet\r\nto a stranger, but equally so to natives themselves, unconnected with\r\nthe blood royal. With all my ingenuity and industry, I had not advanced\r\na single letter.\r\n\r\nOne night, as I lay tossing restlessly upon my bed, revolving this\r\ninsoluble enigma in my mind, one of the mosaic paving-stones was\r\nsuddenly lifted up in the middle of the room, and the figure of a young\r\nman with a lighted taper in his hand stood before me.\r\n\r\nRaising my head hastily from the pillow, I almost sank back with\r\nastonishment when I recognized in the form and features of my midnight\r\nvisitor, Pio the Carib boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n      \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n       Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n                                             --SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\nI sprang to my feet with all the eagerness of joy, and was about to rush\r\ninto the arms of Pio, when he suddenly checked my enthusiasm by\r\nextinguishing the light. I stood still and erect, like one petrified\r\ninto stone. That moment I felt a hand upon my arm, then around my waist,\r\nand ere I could collect my thoughts, was distinctly lifted from the\r\nground. But I was carried only a few steps. On touching the floor with\r\nmy feet, I was planted firmly, and the arms of my companion were tightly\r\ndrawn around my own so as to prevent me from raising them. The next\r\ninstant, and the stone upon which we stood suddenly slid from its\r\nposition, and gradually sank perpendicularly,--we still retaining our\r\nposition upon it.\r\n\r\nOur descent was not rapid, nor did I deem it very secure; for the\r\ntrap-door trembled under us, and more than once seemed to touch the\r\nshaft into which we were descending. A few moments more and we landed\r\nsecurely upon a solid pavement. My companion then disengaged his hold,\r\nand stepping off a few paces, pronounced the words \"_We are here_!\" in\r\nthe royal tongue, and immediately a panel slid from the side of the\r\napartment, and a long passage-way, lighted at the further end by a\r\nsingle candle, displayed itself to view. Into that passage we at once\r\nentered, and without exchanging a single word, walked rapidly toward the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe light stood upon a stone stand about four feet high, at the\r\nintersection of these passages. We took the one to the left, and\r\nadvanced twenty or thirty yards, when Pio halted. On coming up to him,\r\nhe placed his mouth close to the wall, and exclaimed as before. \"We are\r\nhere.\" A huge block of granite swung inward, and we entered a small but\r\nwell-lighted apartment, around which were hanging several costly and\r\nmagnificent suits of Palenquin costume.\r\n\r\nHastily seizing two of them, Pio commenced arraying himself in one, and\r\nrequested me by a gesture to don the other. With a little assistance, I\r\nsoon found myself decked from head to foot in a complete suit of regal\r\nrobes--_panache_, sash, and sandals inclusive.\r\n\r\nWhen all was completed, Pio, for the first time, addressed me as\r\nfollows: \"Young stranger, whoever you may be, or to whatever nation you\r\nmay belong, matters but little to me. The attendant guardian spirit of\r\nour race and country has conducted you hither, in the most mysterious\r\nmanner, and now commands me to have you instructed in the most sacred\r\nlore of the Aztecs. Your long residence in this palace has fully\r\nconvinced you of the danger to which we are both exposed; I in\r\nrevealing and you in acquiring the key to the interpretation of the\r\nhistorical records of my country. I need not assure you that our lives\r\nare both forfeited, should the slightest suspicion be aroused in the\r\nbreasts of the Princess or the nobility.\r\n\r\n\"You are now dressed in the appropriate costume of a student of our\r\nliterature, and must attend me nightly at the gathering of the Queen's\r\nkindred to be instructed in the art. Express no surprise at anything you\r\nsee or hear; keep your face concealed as much as possible, fear nothing,\r\nand follow me.\"\r\n\r\nAt a preconcerted signal given by Pio, a door flew open and we entered\r\nthe vestibule of a large and brilliantly illuminated chamber.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we passed the entrance I saw before me not less than two\r\nhundred young persons of both sexes, habited in the peculiar garb of\r\nstudents, like our own. We advanced slowly and noiselessly, until we\r\nreached two vacant places, prepared evidently beforehand for us. Our\r\nentrance was not noticed by the classes, nor by those whom I afterwards\r\nrecognized as teachers. All seemed intent upon the problem before them,\r\nand evinced no curiosity to observe the new comers. My own curiosity at\r\nthis moment was intense, and had it not been for the prudent cautions\r\nconstantly given me by Pio, by touching my robes or my feet, an exposure\r\nmost probably would have occurred the first night of my initiation, and\r\nthe narrative of these adventures never been written.\r\n\r\nMy presence of mind, however, soon came to my assistance, and before the\r\nevening was over, I had, by shrewdly noticing the conduct of others,\r\nshaped my own into perfect conformity with theirs, and rendered\r\ndetection next to impossible.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes necessary to digress a moment from the thread of my\r\nstory, and give an accurate description of the persons I beheld around\r\nme, the chamber in which we were gathered, and the peculiar mode of\r\ninstruction pursued by the sages.\r\n\r\nThe scholars were mostly young men and women, averaging in age about\r\ntwenty years. They all wore the emblem of royalty, which I at once\r\nrecognized in the _panache_ of Quezale plumes that graced their heads.\r\nThey stood in semi-circular rows, the platform rising as they receded\r\nfrom the staging in front, like seats in an amphitheatre. Upon the stage\r\nwere seated five individuals--two of the male, and three of the female\r\nsex. An old man was standing up, near the edge of the stage, holding in\r\nhis hands two very cunningly-constructed instruments. At the back of the\r\nstage, a very large, smooth tablet of black marble was inserted in the\r\nwall, and a royal personage stood near it, upon one side, with a common\r\npiece of chalk in his right hand, and a cotton napkin in the left. This\r\nreminded me but too truthfully of the fourth book of Euclid and Nassau\r\nHall; and I was again reminded of the great mathematician before the\r\nassembly broke up, and of his reply to that King of Sicily, who inquired\r\nif there were no easy way of acquiring mathematics. \"None, your\r\nHighness,\" replied the philosopher; \"there is no royal road to\r\nlearning.\" Labor, I soon found, was the only price, even amongst the\r\nAztecs, at which knowledge could be bought. Each student was furnished\r\nwith the same species of instruments which the old man before-mentioned\r\nheld in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe one held in the left hand resembled a white porcelain slate, only\r\nbeing much larger than those in common use. It was nearly twenty inches\r\nsquare, and was divided by mathematical lines into thirty-six\r\ncompartments. It was covered over with a thin crystal, resembling glass,\r\nwhich is found in great quantities in the neighboring mountains, and is\r\nperfectly transparent. The crystal was raised about the one eighth of an\r\ninch from the surface of the slate, and allowed a very fine species of\r\nblack sand to move at will between them. The instrument carried in the\r\nright hand resembled the bow of a common violin, more than anything\r\nelse. The outer edge was constructed of a beautiful yellow wood,\r\npolished, and bent into the arc of a quarter circle; whilst a mass of\r\nsmall cords, made of the native hemp, united the two ends.\r\n\r\nThe method of using the bow was this: The slate was shaken violently\r\nonce or twice, so as to distribute the black sand equally over the white\r\nsurface, and then the bow was drawn perpendicularly down the edge of the\r\nslate, very rapidly, so as to produce a quick whistling sound. The\r\neffect produced upon the grains of sand was truly wonderful to the\r\nuninitiated in the laws of acoustics. They arranged themselves into\r\npeculiar figures, sometimes in the form of a semicircle, sometimes into\r\nthat of a spiral, sometimes into a perfect circle, or a cone, or a\r\nrhomboid, or an oval, dependent entirely upon two things: first, the\r\nplace where the slate was held by the left hand; and second, the point\r\nwhere the bow was drawn across the edge. As the slate was subdivided\r\ninto thirty-six compartments, by either one of which it could be held,\r\nand as there was a corresponding point, across which the bow could be\r\ndrawn, there were seventy-two primitive sounds that might be produced by\r\nmeans of this simple contrivance. Each of these sounds inherently and\r\nnecessarily produced a different figure upon the slate, and there were\r\nconsequently just seventy-two initial letters in the Aztec alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe mode of instruction was extremely simple. A word was pronounced by\r\nthe aged teacher at the front of the stage, written upon his slate,\r\nexhibited to the scholar at the black tablet, and by him copied upon it.\r\nThe whole class then drew down their bows, so as to produce the proper\r\nsound, and the word itself, or its initial letter, was immediately\r\nformed upon the slate.\r\n\r\nAfter the seventy-two primitive letters or sounds had been learned, the\r\nnext step was the art of combining them, so as not only to produce\r\nsingle words, but very often whole sentences. Thus the first\r\nhieroglyphic carved upon the tablet, on the back wall of the altar, in\r\nCasa No. 3 (forming the frontispiece of the second volume of Stephens's\r\nTravels in Central America), expresses, within itself, the name, date of\r\nbirth, place of nativity, and parentage, of _Xixencotl_, the first king\r\nof the twenty-third dynasty of the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nThe hieroglyphics of the Aztecs are all of them both symbolical and\r\nphonetic. Hence, in almost every one we observe, first, the primitive\r\nsound or initial letter, and its various combinations; and, secondly,\r\nsome symbolic drawing, as a human face, for instance, or an eagle's\r\nbill, or a fish, denoting some peculiar characteristic of the person or\r\nthing delineated.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Hall of Students. The men and women on the stage\r\nwere placed there as critics upon the pronunciation of each articulate\r\nsound. They were selected from the wisest men and best elocutionists in\r\nthe kingdom, and never failed to detect the slightest error in the\r\npronunciation of the tutor.\r\n\r\nThe royal tongue of the Aztecs is the only one now in existence that is\r\nbased upon natural philosophy and the laws of sound. It appeals both to\r\nthe eye and ear of the speaker, and thus the nicest shades of thought\r\nmay be clearly expressed. There is no such thing as _stilted_ language\r\namongst them, and logomachy is unknown.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may be permitted to observe that a wider field for research\r\nand discovery lies open in the domain of _sound_ than in any other\r\nregion of science. The laws of harmony, even, are but imperfectly\r\nunderstood, and the most accomplished musicians are mere tyros in the\r\ngreat science of acoustics. There is every reason to believe that there\r\nis an intimate but yet undiscovered link between _number_, _light_, and\r\n_sound_ whose solution will astonish and enlighten the generations that\r\nare to succeed our own. _When God spake the worlds into being, the\r\nglobular form they assumed was not accidental, nor arbitrary, but\r\ndepended essentially upon the tone of the great Architect, and the\r\nmedium in which it resounded._\r\n\r\nLet the natural philosophers of the rising generation direct their\r\nespecial attention toward the fields I have indicated, and the rewards\r\nawaiting their investigations will confer upon them immortality of fame.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why the musical scale should not mount in whole tones\r\nup to the octave; why the mind grasps decimals easier than vulgar\r\nfractions, and why, by the laws of light, the blood-red tint should be\r\nheavier than the violet. Let Nature, in these departments, be studied\r\nwith the same care that Cuvier explored the organization of insects,\r\nthat Liebig deduced the property of acids, and that Leverrier computed\r\nthe orbit of that unseen world which his genius has half created, and\r\nall the wonderful and beautiful secrets now on the eve of bursting into\r\nbeing from the dark domain of sound, color, and shape, will at once\r\nmarch forth into view, and take their destined places in the ranks of\r\nhuman knowledge.\r\n\r\nThen the science of computation will be intuitive, as it was in the mind\r\nof Zerah Colburn; the art of music creative, as in the plastic voices of\r\nJehovah; and the great principles of light and shape and color divine,\r\nas in the genius of Swedenborg and the imagination of Milton.\r\n\r\nI have now completed the outline of the sketch, which in the foregoing\r\npages I proposed to lay before the world.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances which led me to explore the remains of the\r\naboriginal Americans, the adventures attending me in carrying out that\r\ndesign, the mode of my introduction into the Living City, spoken of by\r\nStephens, and believed in by so many thousands of enlightened men, and\r\nabove all, the wonderful and almost incredible character of the people I\r\nthere encountered, together with a rapid review of their language and\r\nliterature, have been briefly but faithfully presented to the public.\r\n\r\nIt but remains for me now to present my readers with a few specimens of\r\nAztec literature, translated from the hieroglyphics now mouldering amid\r\nthe forests of Chiapa; to narrate the history of my escape from the\r\nLiving City of the aborigines; to bespeak a friendly word for the\r\nforthcoming history of one of the earliest, most beautiful, and\r\nunfortunate of the Aztec queens, copied _verbatim_ from the annals of\r\nher race, and to bid them one and all, for the present, a respectful\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\nBefore copying from the blurred and water-soaked manuscript before me, a\r\nsingle extract from the literary remains of the monumental race amongst\r\nwhom I have spent three years and a half of my early manhood, it may not\r\nbe deemed improper to remark that a large work upon this subject is now\r\nin course of publication, containing the minutest details of the\r\ndomestic life, public institutions, language, and laws of that\r\ninteresting people.\r\n\r\nThe extracts I present to the reader may be relied upon as exactly\r\ncorrect, since they are taken from the memoranda made upon the spot.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the throne, in the great audience-chamber described\r\nin the preceding chapter, and written in the most beautiful hieroglyphic\r\nextant, I found the following account of the origin of the land:\r\n\r\n   The Great Spirit, whose emblem is the sun, held the water-drops\r\n   out of which the world was made, in the hollow of his hand. He\r\n   breathed a tone, and they rounded into the great globe, and\r\n   started forth on the errand of counting up the years.\r\n\r\n   Nothing existed but water and the great fishes of the sea. One\r\n   eternity passed. The Great Spirit sent a solid star, round and\r\n   beautiful, but dead and no longer burning, and plunged it into\r\n   the depths of the oceans. Then the winds were born, and the rains\r\n   began to fall. The animals next sprang into existence. They came\r\n   up from the star-dust like wheat and maize. The round star\r\n   floated upon the waters, and became the dry land; and the land\r\n   was high, and its edges steep. It was circular, like a plate, and\r\n   all connected together.\r\n\r\n   The marriage of the land and the sea produced man, but his spirit\r\n   came from the beams of the sun.\r\n\r\n   Another eternity passed away, and the earth became too full of\r\n   people. They were all white, because the star fell into the cold\r\n   seas, and the sun could not darken their complexions.\r\n\r\n   Then the sea bubbled up in the middle of the land, and the\r\n   country of the Aztecs floated off to the west. Wherever the star\r\n   cracked open, there the waters rose up and made the deep sea.\r\n\r\n   When the east and the west come together again, they will fit\r\n   like a garment that has been torn.\r\n\r\nThen followed a rough outline of the western coasts of Europe and\r\nAfrica, and directly opposite the coasts of North and South America.\r\nThe projections of the one exactly fitted the indentations of the other,\r\nand gave a semblance of truth and reality to the wild dream of the Aztec\r\nphilosopher. Let the geographer compare them, and he will be more\r\ndisposed to wonder than to sneer.\r\n\r\nI have not space enough left me to quote any further from the monumental\r\ninscriptions, but if the reader be curious upon this subject, I\r\nrecommend to his attention the publication soon to come out, alluded to\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nSome unusual event certainly had occurred in the city. The great plaza\r\nin front of the palace was thronged with a countless multitude of men\r\nand women, all clamoring for a sacrifice! a sacrifice!\r\n\r\nWhilst wondering what could be the cause of this commotion, I was\r\nsuddenly summoned before the Princess in the audience-chamber, so often\r\nalluded to before.\r\n\r\nMy surprise was great when, upon presenting myself before her, I beheld,\r\npinioned to a heavy log of mahogany, a young man, evidently of European\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nThe Princess requested me to interpret for her to the stranger, and the\r\nfollowing colloquy took place. The conversation was in the French\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nQ. \"Who are you, and why do you invade my dominions?\"\r\n\r\nA. \"My name is Armand de L'Oreille. I am a Frenchman by birth. I was\r\nsent out by Lamartine, in 1848, as attaché to the expedition of M. de\r\nBourbourg, whose duties were to explore the forests in the neighborhood\r\nof Palenque, to collate the language of the Central-American Indians, to\r\ncopy the inscriptions on the monuments, and, if possible, to reach the\r\nLIVING CITY mentioned by Waldeck, Dupaix, and the American traveler\r\nStephens.\"\r\n\r\nQ. \"But why are you alone? Where is the party to which you belonged?\"\r\n\r\nA. \"Most of them returned to Palenque, after wandering in the wilderness\r\na few days. Five only determined to proceed; of that number I am the\r\nonly survivor.\"\r\n\r\nHere the interview closed.\r\n\r\nThe council and the queen were not long in determining the fate of M. de\r\nL'Oreille. It was unanimously resolved that he should surrender his life\r\nas a forfeit to his temerity.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at sunrise, was fixed for his death. He was to be\r\nsacrificed upon the altar, on the summit of the great Teocallis--an\r\noffering to _Quetzalcohuatl_, the first great prince of the Aztecs. I at\r\nonce determined to save the life of the stranger, if I could do so, even\r\nat the hazard of my own. But fate ordained it otherwise. I retired\r\nearlier than usual, and lay silent and moody, revolving on the best\r\nmeans to accomplish my end.\r\n\r\nMidnight at length arrived; I crept stealthily from my bed, and opened\r\nthe door of my chamber, as lightly as sleep creeps over the eyelids of\r\nchildren. But----\r\n\r\n[Here the MS. is so blotted, and saturated with saltwater, as to be\r\nillegible for several pages. The next legible sentences are as\r\nfollows.--ED.]\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, the woods looked familiar to me. Proceeding a\r\nfew steps, I fell into the trail leading toward the modern village of\r\nPalenque, and, after an hour's walk, I halted in front of the _cabilda_\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nI was followed by a motley crowd to the office of the Alcalde, who did\r\nnot recognize me, dressed as I was in skins, and half loaded down with\r\nrolls of MS., made from the bark of the mulberry. I related to him and\r\nM. de Bourbourg my adventures; and though the latter declared he had\r\nlost poor Armand and his five companions, yet I am persuaded that\r\nneither of them credited a single word of my story.\r\n\r\nNot many days after my safe arrival at Palenque, I seized a favorable\r\nopportunity to visit the ruins of _Casa Grande_. I readily found the\r\nopening to the subterranean passage heretofore described, and after some\r\ntroublesome delays at the various landing-places, I finally succeeded in\r\nreaching the very spot whence I had ascended on that eventful night,\r\nnearly three years before, in company with the Aztec Princess.\r\n\r\nAfter exploring many of the mouldering and half-ruined apartments of\r\nthis immense palace, I accidentally entered a small room, that at first\r\nseemed to have been a place of sacrifice; but, upon closer inspection, I\r\nascertained that, like many of those in the \"Living City,\" it was a\r\nchapel dedicated to the memory of some one of the princes of the Aztec\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIn order to interpret the inscriptions with greater facility, I lit six\r\nor seven candles, and placed them in the best positions to illuminate\r\nthe hieroglyphics. Then turning, to take a view of the grand tablet in\r\nthe middle of the inscription, my astonishment was indescribable, when I\r\nbeheld the exact features, dress and _panache_ of the Aztec maiden,\r\ncarved in the everlasting marble before me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_THE MOTHER'S EPISTLE._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sweet daughter, leave thy tasks and toys,\r\n      Throw idle thoughts aside,\r\n    And hearken to a mother's voice,\r\n      That would thy footsteps guide;\r\n    Though far across the rolling seas,\r\n      Beyond the mountains blue,\r\n    She sends her counsels on the breeze,\r\n      And wafts her blessings too.\r\n\r\n    To guard thy voyage o'er life's wave,\r\n      To guide thy bark aright,\r\n    To snatch thee from an early grave,\r\n      And gild thy way with light,\r\n    Thy mother calls thee to her side,\r\n      And takes thee on her knee,\r\n    In spite of oceans that divide,\r\n      And thus addresses thee:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I.\r\n\r\n    Learn first this lesson in thy youth,\r\n      Which time cannot destroy,\r\n    To love and speak and act the truth--\r\n      'Tis life's most holy joy;\r\n    Wert thou a queen upon a throne,\r\n      Decked in each royal gem,\r\n    This little jewel would alone\r\n      Outshine thy diadem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II.\r\n\r\n    Next learn to conquer, as they rise,\r\n      Each wave of passion's sea;\r\n    Unchecked, 'twill sweep the vaulted skies,\r\n      And vanquish heaven and thee;\r\n    Lashed on by storms within thy breast,\r\n      These billows of the soul\r\n    Will wreck thy peace, destroy thy rest,\r\n      And ruin as they roll!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III.\r\n\r\n    But conquered passions were no gain,\r\n      Unless where once they grew\r\n    There falls the teardrop, like the rain,\r\n      And gleams the morning dew;\r\n    Sow flowers within thy virgin heart,\r\n      That spring from guileless love;\r\n    Extend to each a sister's part,\r\n      Take lessons of the dove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IV.\r\n\r\n    But, daughter, empty were our lives,\r\n      And useless all our toils,\r\n    If that within us, which survives\r\n      Life's transient battle-broils,\r\n    Were all untaught in heavenly lore,\r\n      Unlearned in virtue's ways,\r\n    Ungifted with religion's store,\r\n      Unskilled our God to praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   V.\r\n\r\n    Take for thy guide the Bible old,\r\n      Consult its pages fair\r\n    Within them glitter gems and gold,\r\n      Repentance, Faith, and Prayer;\r\n    Make these companions of thy soul;\r\n      Where e'er thy footsteps roam,\r\n    And safely shalt thou reach thy goal,\r\n      In heaven--the angel's home!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_LEGENDS OF LAKE BIGLER._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE HAUNTED ROCK.\r\n\r\nA great many years ago, ere the first white man had trodden the soil of\r\nthe American continent, and before the palaces of Uxmal and Palenque\r\nwere masses of shapeless ruins--whilst the splendid structures, now\r\nlining the banks of the Gila with broken columns and fallen domes were\r\ninhabited by a nobler race than the cowardly Pimos or the Ishmaelitish\r\nApaches, there lived and flourished on opposite shores of Lake Bigler\r\ntwo rival nations, disputing with each other for the supremacy of this\r\ninland sea, and making perpetual war in order to accomplish the object\r\nof their ambition.\r\n\r\nThe tribe dwelling upon the western shore was called the Ako-ni-tas,\r\nwhilst those inhabiting what is now the State of Nevada were known by\r\nthe name of Gra-so-po-itas. Each nation was subdivided into smaller\r\nprincipalities, over which subordinate sachems, or chiefs, presided. In\r\nnumber, physical appearance, and advance in the arts of civilization,\r\nboth very much resembled, and neither could be said to have decidedly\r\nthe pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nAt the time my story commences, Wan-ta-tay-to was principal chief or\r\nking of the Ako-ni-tas, or, as they were sometimes designated,\r\nO-kak-o-nitas, whilst Rhu-tog-au-di presided over the destinies of the\r\nGra-so-po-itas. The language spoken by these tribes were dialects of\r\nthe same original tongue, and could be easily understood the one by the\r\nother. Continued intercourse, even when at war, had assimilated their\r\ncustoms, laws and religion to such a degree that it often became a\r\nmatter of grave doubt as to which tribe occasional deserters belonged.\r\nIntermarriage between the tribes was strictly forbidden, and punished\r\nwith death in all cases, no matter what might be the rank, power or\r\nwealth of the violators of the law.\r\n\r\nAt this era the surface of the lake was about sixty feet higher than at\r\nthe present time. Constant evaporation, or perhaps the wearing channel\r\nof the Truckee, has contributed to lower the level of the water, and the\r\nsame causes still continue in operation, as is clearly perceptible by\r\nthe watermarks of previous years. Thousands of splendid canoes\r\neverywhere dotted its surface; some of them engaged in the peaceful\r\navocations of fishing and hunting, whilst the large majority were manned\r\nand armed for immediate and deadly hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe year preceding that in which the events occurred herein related, had\r\nbeen a very disastrous one to both tribes. A great many deaths had\r\nensued from casualties in battle; but the chief source of disaster had\r\nbeen a most terrific hurricane, which had swept over the lake,\r\nupsetting, sinking, and destroying whole fleets of canoes, with all\r\npersons aboard at the time. Amongst the lost were both the royal barges,\r\nwith the sons and daughters of the chiefs. The loss had been so\r\noverwhelming and general that the chief of the O-kak-o-nitas had but one\r\nsolitary representative of the line royal left, and that was a beloved\r\ndaughter named Ta-kem-ena. The rival chieftain was equally unfortunate,\r\nfor his entire wigwam had perished with the exception of Mo-ca-ru-po,\r\nhis youngest son. But these great misfortunes, instead of producing\r\npeace and good-will, as a universal calamity would be sure to do in an\r\nenlightened nation, tended only to embitter the passions of the hostile\r\nkings and lend new terrors to the war. At once made aware of what the\r\nother had suffered, each promulgated a sort of proclamation, offering an\r\nimmense reward for the scalp of his rival's heir.\r\n\r\nWan-ta-tay-to declared that he would give one half his realm to\r\nwhomsoever brought the body of Mo-ca-ru-po, dead or alive, within his\r\nlines; and Rhu-tog-au-di, not to be outdone in extravagance, registered\r\nan oath that whosoever captured Ta-kem-ena, the beautiful daughter of\r\nhis enemy, should be rewarded with her patrimonial rights, and also be\r\nassociated with him in ruling his own dominions.\r\n\r\nAs is universally the case with all American Indians, the females are\r\nequally warlike and sometimes quite as brave as the males. Ta-kem-ena\r\nwas no exception to this rule, and she accordingly made instant\r\npreparations to capture or kill the heir to the throne of her enemy. For\r\nthis purpose she selected a small, light bark canoe, and resolved all\r\nalone to make the attempt. Nor did she communicate her intention to any\r\none else. Her father, even, was kept in profound ignorance of his\r\ndaughter's design.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, a desire for fame, and a thirsting for supreme\r\npower, allured young Mo-ca-ru-po into the lists of those who became\r\ncandidates for the recent reward offered by his father. He, too,\r\ndetermined to proceed alone.\r\n\r\nIt was just at midnight, of a beautiful moonlight evening, that the\r\nyoung scions of royalty set forth from opposite shores of the lake, and\r\nstealthily paddled for the dominions of their enemies. When about half\r\nacross the boats came violently into collision. Each warrior seized arms\r\nfor the conflict. The light of the full moon, riding at mid-heavens,\r\nfell softly upon the features of the Princess, and at the same time\r\nilluminated those of the young Prince.\r\n\r\nThe blows from the uplifted battle-axes failed to descend. The poisoned\r\narrows were returned to their quivers. Surprise gave place quickly to\r\nadmiration--that to something more human--pity followed close in the\r\nrear, and love, triumphant everywhere, paralyzed the muscles, benumbed\r\nthe faculties, and captured the souls of his victims. Pouring a handful\r\nof the pure water of the lake upon each other's heads, as a pledge of\r\nlove, and a ceremonial of marriage, in another moment the two were\r\nlocked in each other's arms, made man and wife by the yearnings of the\r\nsoul, and by a destiny which naught but Omnipotent Power could avert.\r\nWhat were the commands of kings, their threats, or their punishments, in\r\nthe scale with youth, and hope, and love?\r\n\r\nNever did those transparent waters leap more lightly beneath the\r\nmoonbeams than upon this auspicious night. Hate, revenge, fame, power,\r\nall were forgotten in the supreme delights of love.\r\n\r\nWho, indeed, would not be a lover? The future takes the hue of the\r\nrainbow, and spans the whole earth with its arch. The past fades into\r\ninstant oblivion, and its dark scenes are remembered no more. Every\r\nbeautiful thing looks lovelier--spring's breath smells sweeter--the\r\nheavens bend lower--the stars shine brighter. The eyes, the lips, the\r\nsmiles of the loved one, bankrupt all nature. The diamond's gleam, the\r\nflower's blush, the fountain's purity, are all _her_ own! The antelope's\r\nswiftness, the buffalo's strength, the lion's bravery, are but the\r\nreflex of _his_ manly soul!\r\n\r\nFate thus had bound these two lovers in indissoluble bonds: let us now\r\nsee what it had left in reserve.\r\n\r\nThe plashing of paddles aroused the lovers from their caressing. Quickly\r\nleaping into his own boat, side by side, they flew over the exultant\r\nwaves, careless for the moment whither they went, and really aimless in\r\ntheir destination. Having safely eluded their pursuers, if such they\r\nwere, the princes now consulted as to their future course. After long\r\nand anxious debate it was finally determined that they should part for\r\nthe present, and would each night continue to meet at midnight at the\r\nmajestic rock which towered up from the waves high into the heavens, not\r\nfar from what is now known as Pray's Farm, that being the residence and\r\nheadquarters of the O-kak-oni-ta tribe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after many protestations of eternal fidelity, and warned by\r\nthe ruddy gleam along the eastern sky, they parted.\r\n\r\nNight after night, for many weeks and months, the faithful lovers met at\r\nthe appointed place, and proved their affection by their constancy. They\r\nsoon made the discovery that the immense rock was hollow, and contained\r\na magnificent cave. Here, safe from all observation, the tardy months\r\nrolled by, both praying for peace, yet neither daring to mention a\r\ntermination of hostilities to their sires. Finally, the usual\r\nconcomitants of lawful wedlock began to grow manifest in the rounded\r\nform of the Princess--in her sadness, her drooping eyes, and her\r\nperpetual uneasiness whilst in the presence of her father. Not able any\r\nlonger to conceal her griefs, they became the court scandal, and she\r\nwas summoned to the royal presence and required to name her lover. This,\r\nof course, she persisted in refusing, but spies having been set upon her\r\nmovements, herself and lover were surrounded and entrapped in the fatal\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nIn vain did she plead for the life of the young prince, regardless of\r\nher own. His doom was sealed. An embassador was sent to Rhu-tog-au-di,\r\nannouncing the treachery of his son, and inviting that chief to be\r\npresent at the immolation of both victims. He willingly consented to\r\nassist in the ceremonies. A grand council of the two nations was\r\nimmediately called, in order to determine in what manner the death\r\npenalty should be inflicted. After many and grave debates, it was\r\nresolved that the lovers should be incarcerated in the dark and gloomy\r\ncave where they had spent so many happy hours, and there starve to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt was a grand gala-day with the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas.\r\nThe mighty chiefs had been reconciled, and the wealth, power and beauty\r\nof the two realms turned out in all the splendor of fresh paint and\r\nbrilliant feathers, to do honor to the occasion. The young princes were\r\nto be put to death. The lake in the vicinity of the rock was alive with\r\ncanoes. The hills in the neighborhood were crowded with spectators. The\r\ntwo old kings sat in the same splendid barge, and followed close after\r\nthe bark canoe in which the lovers were being conveyed to their living\r\ntomb. Silently they gazed into each other's faces and smiled. For each\r\nother had they lived; with one another were they now to die. Without\r\nfood, without water, without light, they were hurried into their bridal\r\nchamber, and huge stones rolled against the only entrance.\r\n\r\nEvening after evening the chiefs sat upon the grave portals of their\r\nchildren. At first they were greeted with loud cries, extorted by the\r\ngnawing of hunger and the agony of thirst. Gradually the cries gave way\r\nto low moans, and finally, after ten days had elapsed, the tomb became\r\nas silent as the lips of the lovers. Then the huge stones were, by the\r\ncommand of the two kings, rolled away, and a select body of warriors\r\nordered to enter and bring forth their lifeless forms. But the west wind\r\nhad sprung up, and just as the stones were taken from the entrance, a\r\nlow, deep, sorrowful sigh issued from the mouth of the cave. Startled\r\nand terrified beyond control, the warriors retreated hastily from the\r\nspot; and the weird utterances continuing, no warriors could be found\r\nbrave enough to sound the depths of that dreadful sepulchre. Day after\r\nday canoes crowded about the mouth of the cave, and still the west wind\r\nblew, and still the sighs and moans continued to strike the souls of the\r\ntrembling warriors.\r\n\r\nFinally, no canoe dared approach the spot. In paddling past they would\r\nalways veer their canoes seaward, and hurry past with all the speed they\r\ncould command.\r\n\r\nCenturies passed away; the level of the lake had sunk many feet; the\r\nlast scions of the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas had mouldered\r\nmany years in the burying-grounds of their sires, and a new race had\r\nusurped their old hunting grounds. Still no one had ever entered the\r\nhaunted cave.\r\n\r\nOne day, late in the autumn of 1849, a company of emigrants on their way\r\nto California, were passing, toward evening, the month of the cavern,\r\nand hearing a strange, low, mournful sigh, seeming to issue thence, they\r\nlanded their canoe and resolved to solve the mystery. Lighting some\r\npitch-pine torches, they proceeded cautiously to explore the cavern. For\r\na long time they could discern nothing. At length, in the furthest\r\ncorner of the gloomy recess, they found two human skeletons, with their\r\nbony arms entwined, and their fleshless skulls resting upon each other's\r\nbosoms. The lovers are dead, but the old cave still echoes with their\r\ndying sobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--DICK BARTER'S YARN; OR, THE LAST OF THE MERMAIDS.\r\n\r\nWell, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having sailed the seas for\r\nmore than forty-nine years, and being entirely unaccustomed to living\r\nupon the land. By some accident or other, I found myself, in the winter\r\nof 1849, cook for a party of miners who were sluicing high up the North\r\nFork of the American. We had a hard time all winter, and when spring\r\nopened, it was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should cross\r\nthe summit and spend a week fishing at the lake. We took along an old\r\nWashoe Indian, who spoke Spanish, as a guide. This old man had formerly\r\nlived on the north margin of the lake, near where Tahoe City is now\r\nsituated, and was perfectly familiar with all the most noted fishing\r\ngrounds and chief points of interest throughout its entire circuit.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly got started before he commenced telling us of a remarkable\r\nstruggle, which he declared had been going on for many hundred years\r\nbetween a border tribe of Indians and the inhabitants of the lake, whom\r\nhe designated as Water-men, or \"_hombres de las aguas_.\" On asking if he\r\nreally meant to say that human beings lived and breathed like fish in\r\nLake Bigler, he declared without any hesitation that such was the fact;\r\nthat he had often seen them; and went on to describe a terrific combat\r\nhe witnessed a great many years ago, between a Pol-i-wog chief and _a\r\nman of the water_. On my expressing some doubt as to the veracity of the\r\nstatement, he proffered to show us the very spot where it occurred; and\r\nat the same time expressed a belief that by manufacturing a whistle from\r\nthe bark of the mountain chinquapin, and blowing it as the Pol-i-wogs\r\ndid, we might entice some of their old enemies from the depths of the\r\nlake. My curiosity now being raised tip-toe, I proceeded to interrogate\r\nJuan more closely, and in answer I succeeded in obtaining the following\r\ncurious particulars:\r\n\r\nThe tribe of border Indians called the Pol-i-wogs were a sort of\r\namphibious race, and a hybrid between the Pi-Utes and the mermaids of\r\nthe lake. They were of a much lighter color than their progenitors, and\r\nwere distinguished by a great many peculiar characteristics. Exceedingly\r\nfew in number, and quarrelsome in the extreme, they resented every\r\nintrusion upon the waters of the lake as a personal affront, and made\r\nperpetual war upon neighboring tribes. Hence, as Juan remarked, they\r\nsoon became extinct after the invasion of the Washoes. The last of them\r\ndisappeared about twenty-five years ago. The most noted of their\r\npeculiarities were the following:\r\n\r\nFirst. Their heads were broad and extremely flat; the eyes protuberant,\r\nand the ears scarcely perceptible--being a small opening closed by a\r\nmovable valve shaped like the scale of a salmon. Their mouths were very\r\nlarge, extending entirely across the cheeks, and bounded by a hard rim\r\nof bone, instead of the common lip. In appearance, therefore, the head\r\ndid not look unlike an immense catfish head, except there were no fins\r\nabout the jaws, and no feelers, as we call them.\r\n\r\nSecond. Their necks were short, stout, and chubby, and they possessed\r\nthe power of inflating them at will, and thus distending them to two or\r\nthree times their ordinary size.\r\n\r\nThird. Their bodies were long, round, and flexible. When wet, they\r\nglistened in the sun like the back of an eel, and seemed to possess much\r\ngreater buoyancy than those of common men. But the greatest wonder of\r\nall was a kind of loose membrane, that extended from beneath their\r\nshoulders all the way down their sides, and connected itself with the\r\nupper portion of their thighs. This loose skin resembled the wings of\r\nthe common house bat, and when spread out, as it always did in the\r\nwater, looked like the membrane lining of the legs and fore feet of the\r\nchipmunk.\r\n\r\nFourth. The hands and feet were distinguished for much greater length of\r\ntoe and finger; and their extremities grew together like the toes of a\r\nduck, forming a complete web betwixt all the fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nThe Pol-i-wogs lived chiefly upon fish and oysters, of which there was\r\nonce a great abundance in the lake. They were likewise cannibals, and\r\nate their enemies without stint or compunction. A young Washoe girl was\r\nconsidered a feast, but a lake maiden was the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nluxuries. The Washoes reciprocated the compliment, and fattened upon the\r\nblubber of the Pol-i-wogs. It is true that they were extremely difficult\r\nto capture, for, when hotly pursued, they plunged into the lake, and by\r\nexpert swimming and extraordinary diving, they generally managed to\r\neffect their escape.\r\n\r\nJuan having exhausted his budget concerning the Pol-i-wogs, I requested\r\nhim to give us as minute a description of the Lake Mermaids. This he\r\ndeclined for the present to do, alleging as an excuse that we would\r\nfirst attempt to capture, or at least to see one for ourselves, and if\r\nour hunt was unsuccessful, he would then gratify our curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt was some days before we came in sight of this magnificent sheet of\r\nwater. Finally, however, after many perilous adventures in descending\r\nthe Sierras, we reached the margin of the lake. Our first care was to\r\nprocure trout enough to last until we got ready to return. That was an\r\neasy matter, for in those days the lake was far more plentifully\r\nsupplied than at present. We caught many thousands at a place where a\r\nsmall brook came down from the mountains, and formed a pool not a great\r\ndistance from its entrance into the lake, and this pool was alive with\r\nthem. It occupied us but three days to catch, clean, and sun-dry as many\r\nas our single mule could carry, and having still nearly a week to spare\r\nwe determined to start off in pursuit of the mermaids.\r\n\r\nOur guide faithfully conducted us to the spot where he beheld the\r\nconflict between the last of the Pol-i-wogs and one of the water-men. As\r\nstated above, it is nearly on the spot where Tahoe City now stands. The\r\nbattle was a fierce one, as the combatants were equally matched in\r\nstrength and endurance, and was finally terminated only by the\r\ninterposition of a small party of Washoes, our own guide being of the\r\nnumber. The struggle was chiefly in the water, the Pol-i-wog being\r\nbetter able to swim than the mermaid was to walk. Still, as occasion\r\nrequired, a round or two took place on the gravelly beach. Never did old\r\nSpain and England engage in fiercer conflict for the dominion of the\r\nseas, than now occurred between Pol-i-wog and Merman for the mastery of\r\nthe lake. Each fought, as the Roman fought, for Empire. The Pol-i-wog,\r\nlike the last of the Mohicans, had seen his tribe melt away, until he\r\nstood, like some solitary column at Persepolis, the sole monument of a\r\nonce gorgeous temple. The water chieftain also felt that upon his arm,\r\nor rather tail, everything that made life desirable was staked. Above\r\nall, the trident of his native sea was involved.\r\n\r\nThe weapons of the Pol-i-wog were his teeth and his hind legs. Those of\r\nthe Merman were all concentrated in the flop of his scaly tail. With the\r\nenergy of a dying alligator, he would encircle, with one tremendous\r\neffort, the bruised body of the Pol-i-wog, and floor him beautifully on\r\nthe beach. Recovering almost instantly, the Pol-i-wog would seize the\r\nMerman by the long black hair, kick him in the region of the stomach,\r\nand grapple his windpipe between his bony jaws, as the mastiff does the\r\ninfuriated bull.\r\n\r\nFinally, after a great many unsuccessful attempts to drag the Pol-i-wog\r\ninto deep water, the mermaid was seized by her long locks and suddenly\r\njerked out upon the beach in a very battered condition. At this moment,\r\nthe Washoes with a yell rushed toward the combatants, but the Pol-i-wog\r\nseeing death before him upon water and land equally, preferred the\r\nembraces of the water nymphs to the stomachs of the landsmen, and\r\nrolling over rapidly was soon borne off into unfathomable depths by the\r\ntriumphant Merman.\r\n\r\nSuch was the story of Juan. It resembled the condition of the ancient\r\nBritons, who, being crowded by the Romans from the sea, and attacked by\r\nthe Picts from the interior, lamented their fate as the most unfortunate\r\nof men. \"The Romans,\" they said, \"drive us into the land; there we are\r\nmet by the Picts, who in turn drive us into the sea. We must perish in\r\neither event. Those whom enemies spare, the waves devour.\"\r\n\r\nOur first step was to prepare a chinquapin whistle. The flute was easily\r\nmanufactured by Juan himself, thuswise: He cut a twig about eighteen\r\ninches in length, and not more than half an inch in diameter, and\r\npeeling the bark from the ends an inch or so, proceeded to rub the bark\r\nrapidly with a dry stick peeled perfectly smooth. In a short time the\r\nsap in the twig commenced to exude from both ends. Then placing the\r\nlarge end between his teeth he pulled suddenly, and the bark slipped off\r\nwith a crack in it. Then cutting a small hole in the form of a\r\nparallelogram, near the upper end, he adjusted a stopper with flattened\r\nsurface so as to fit exactly the opening. Cutting off the end of the\r\nstopple even with the bark and filling the lower opening nearly full of\r\nclay, he declared the work was done. As a proof of this, he blew into\r\nthe hollow tube, and a low, musical sound was emitted, very flute-like\r\nand silvery. When blown harshly, it could be heard at a great distance,\r\nand filled the air with melodious echoes.\r\n\r\nThus equipped, we set out upon our search. The first two days were spent\r\nunsuccessfully. On the third we found ourselves near what is now called\r\nAgate Beach. At this place a small cove indents the land, which sweeps\r\nround in the form of a semi-circle. The shore is literally packed with\r\nagates and crystals. We dug some more than two feet deep in several\r\nplaces, but still could find no bottom to the glittering floor. They are\r\nof all colors, but the prevailing hues are red and yellow. Here Juan\r\npaused, and lifting his whistle to his lips, he performed a multitude of\r\nsoft, gentle airs, which floated across the calm waves like a lover's\r\nserenade breathes o'er the breast of sleeping beauty. It all seemed in\r\nvain. We had now entirely circumnavigated the lake, and were on the eve\r\nof despairing utterly, when suddenly we beheld the surface of the lake,\r\nnearly a quarter of a mile from the shore, disturbed violently, as if\r\nsome giant whale were floundering with a harpoon in its side. In a\r\nmoment more the head and neck of one of those tremendous serpents that\r\nof late years have infested the lake, were uplifted some ten or fifteen\r\nfeet above the surface. Almost at the same instant we beheld the head,\r\nface and hair, as of a human being, emerge quickly from the water, and\r\nlook back toward the pursuing foe. The truth flashed upon us\r\ninstantaneously. Here was a mermaid pursued by a serpent. On they came,\r\nseemingly regardless of our presence, and had approached to within\r\ntwenty yards of the spot where we stood, when suddenly both came to a\r\ndead halt. Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his tuneful flute,\r\nand it now became apparent that the notes had struck their hearing at\r\nthe same time. To say that they were charmed would but half express\r\ntheir ecstatic condition. They were absolutely entranced.\r\n\r\nThe huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a hundred feet or so,\r\nand never so much as shook the spray from his hide. He looked like\r\nMilton's portrait of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.\r\nIn perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful mermaiden lifted\r\nher pallid face above the water, dripping with the crystal tears of the\r\nlake, and gathering her long raven locks, that floated like the train of\r\na meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across her swelling\r\nbosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon her beauteous form. But\r\nthere my eyes were fastened! If she were entranced by the music, I was\r\nnot less so with her beauty. Presently the roseate hues of a dying\r\ndolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere long a gentle sigh,\r\nas if stolen from the trembling chords of an Eolian harp, issued from\r\nher coral lips. Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full\r\nsymphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.\r\n\r\nMy attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious clicking of my\r\ncomrade's rifle. Turning around suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his\r\npiece leveled at the unconscious mermaid.\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" I exclaimed! \"Liehard, would you commit murder?\" But the\r\nwarning came too late, for instantaneously the quick report of his rifle\r\nand the terrific shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;\r\nand, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of the water, she\r\nplunged headlong forwards, a corpse. Beholding his prey, powerless\r\nwithin his grasp, the serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock\r\nmy rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with it into the\r\nmysterious caverns of the lake. At this instant, I gave a loud outcry,\r\nas if in pain. On opening my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the\r\nmidday sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning some\r\nconfounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the rum trade of Jamaica,\r\nand the sloop _Edith Beaty_ was still riding at anchor off the wild\r\nglen, and gazing tranquilly at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of\r\nLake Bigler.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_ROSENTHAL'S ELAINE._\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stood and gazed far out into the waste;\r\n    No dip of oar broke on the listening ear;\r\n    But the quick rippling of the inward flood\r\n    Gave warning of approaching argosy.\r\n\r\n    Adown the west, the day's last fleeting gleam\r\n    Faded and died, and left the world in gloom.\r\n    Hope hung no star up in the murky east\r\n    To cheer the soul, or guide the pilgrim's way.\r\n    Black frown'd the heavens, and black the answering earth\r\n    Reflected from her watery wastes the night.\r\n\r\n    Sudden, a plash! then silence. Once again\r\n    The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,\r\n    Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.\r\n    Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,\r\n    Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept\r\n    From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,\r\n    Sailless and voiceless, all!\r\n                               Ah!

An estimable gentleman of the African\r\npersuasion, to whom we handed our \"pasteboard,\" soon returned with the\r\npolite message, \"Yes, sir; _in_. Please walk up.\" And so we followed our\r\nconductor through several passages almost as dark as the face of the\r\n_cicerone_, and in a few moments found ourselves in the presence of,\r\nperhaps, the busiest man in the city of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWithout any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired our object in\r\nseeking him and the information we desired. \"Ah,\" said he, \"that is a\r\nlong story. I have no time to go into particulars just now. I am\r\ncomputing the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the Transit\r\nof Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo. It must be ready before\r\nMay, and it requires six months' work to do it correctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I rejoined, \"can't you tell me where the lad is to be found?\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I did, they will not let you see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me alone for that,\" said I, smiling; \"a reporter, like love, finds\r\nhis way where wolves would fear to tread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, my dear sir,\" quickly responded the Doctor, \"I have no time to\r\nchat this morning. Our special committee submitted its report yesterday,\r\nwhich is on file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to\r\npublish it until after it has been read in open session of the College,\r\nyou may take it to your sanctum, run it over, and clip from it enough to\r\nsatisfy the public for the present.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case, took from a\r\npigeon-hole a voluminous written document tied up with red tape, and\r\nhanded it to me, adding, \"Be careful!\" Seating himself without another\r\nword, he turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the street.\r\n\r\nReaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the envelope, and\r\nfound it as follows: \"Report of Special Committee--Boy\r\nPalmer--Vision--Laws of Light--Filed February 10, 1876--Stittmore,\r\nSec.\" Opening the document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate,\r\nand, up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal case I\r\nwas after, and regretted the promise made not to publish the entire\r\nreport until read in open session of the College. Therefore, I shall be\r\ncompelled to give the substance of the report in my own words, only\r\ngiving _verbatim_ now and then a few scientific phrases which are not\r\nfully intelligible to me, or susceptible of circumlocution in common\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and Golson, three of our\r\nablest medical men, and approved by Professor Smyth, the oculist. So\r\nfar, therefore, as authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned,\r\nour readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness of every\r\nfact stated and conclusion reached.\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of the report gives the name of the child, \"John\r\nPalmer, age, nine years, and place of residence, South San Francisco,\r\nCulp Hill, near Catholic Orphan Asylum;\" and then plunges at once into\r\n_in medias res_.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the period through which the investigation ran was only\r\nfifteen days; but it seems to have been so thorough, by the use of the\r\nophthalmoscope and other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets\r\nought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed in\r\nexperiments. Besides, we have superadded a short and minute account of\r\nour own, verifying some of the most curious facts reported, with several\r\ntests proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement of the\r\nscientific committee.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by the committee.\r\nThey were conducted into a small back room, darkened by old blankets\r\nhung up at the window, for the purpose of the total exclusion of\r\ndaylight; an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a noted quack\r\nwhose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the San Francisco _Truth\r\nTeller_. The lad was reclining upon an old settee, ill-clad and almost\r\nidiotic in expression. As the committee soon ascertained, his mother\r\nonly was at home, the father being absent at his customary\r\noccupation--that of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad. She notified\r\nher son of the presence of strangers and he rose and walked with a firm\r\nstep toward where the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room. He\r\nshook them all by the hand and bade them good morning. In reply to\r\nquestions rapidly put and answered by his mother, the following account\r\nof the infancy of the boy and the accidental discovery of his\r\nextraordinary powers of vision was given:\r\n\r\nHe was born in the house where the committee found him, nine years ago\r\nthe 15th of last January. Nothing of an unusual character occurred until\r\nhis second year, when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was\r\ncompletely blind, his parents never having been suspicious of the fact\r\nbefore that time, although the mother declared that for some months\r\nanterior to the discovery she had noticed some acts of the child that\r\nseemed to indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness. From this\r\ntime forward until a few months ago nothing happened to vary the boy's\r\nexistence except a new remedy now and then prescribed by neighbors for\r\nthe supposed malady. He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber, and\r\nwas never trusted alone out of doors. He grew familiar, by touch and\r\nsound, with the forms of most objects about him, and could form very\r\naccurate guesses of the color and texture of them all. His\r\nconversational powers did not seem greatly impaired, and he readily\r\nacquired much useful knowledge from listening attentively to everything\r\nthat was said in his presence. He was quite a musician, and touched the\r\nharmonicon, banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling. He was unusually\r\nsensitive to the presence of light, though incapable of seeing any\r\nobject with any degree of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude\r\nlight as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision. It was very\r\nstrange that up to the time of the examination of the committee, no\r\nscientific examination of the boy's eye had been made by a competent\r\noculist, the parents contenting themselves with the chance opinions of\r\nvisitors or the cheap nostrums of quacks. It is perhaps fortunate for\r\nscience that this was the case, as a cure for the eye might have been an\r\nextinction of its abnormal power.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 12th of December last (1875), the position of the\r\nchild's bed was temporarily changed to make room for a visitor. The bed\r\nwas placed against the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with\r\nthe window opening at the side of the bed next to the head. The boy was\r\nsent to bed about seven o'clock, and the parents and their visitor were\r\nseated in the front room, spending the evening in social intercourse.\r\nThe moon rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock, and\r\nshone full in the face of the sleeping boy.\r\n\r\nSomething aroused him from slumber, and when he opened his eyes the\r\nfirst object they encountered was the round disk of her orb. By some\r\noversight the curtain had been removed from the window, and probably for\r\nthe first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen of night\r\nswimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing hill and bay in effulgent\r\nglory. Uttering a cry, equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in\r\nbed and sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open, finger\r\npointed, and astonishment depicted on every feature. His sudden, sharp\r\nscream brought his mother to his side, who tried for some moments in\r\nvain to distract his gaze from the object before him. Failing even to\r\nattract notice, she called in her husband and friend, and together they\r\nbesought the boy to lie down and go to sleep, but to no avail. Believing\r\nhim to be ill and in convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the\r\npoint of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a sudden spring, he\r\nescaped from their grasp and ran out the front door. Again he fixed his\r\nunwinking eyes upon the moon, and remained speechless for several\r\nseconds. At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity, he\r\nturned on his mother, who stood wringing her hands in the doorway and\r\nmoaning piteously, and exclaimed, \"I can see the moon yonder, and it is\r\nso beautiful that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon as I get\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"How big does it look?\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"So big,\" he replied, \"that I cannot see it all at one glance--as big as\r\nall out of doors.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far off from you does it seem to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"About half a car's distance,\" he quickly rejoined.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance had been\r\nmeasured all his life by the distance from his home to the street-car\r\nstation at the foot of the hill. This was about two hundred yards, so\r\nthat the reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one hundred\r\nyards from the spectator. The boy then proceeded of his own accord to\r\ngive a very minute description of the appearance of objects which he\r\nbeheld, corresponding, of course, to his poverty of words with which to\r\nclothe his ideas.\r\n\r\nHis account of things beheld by him was so curious, wonderful and\r\napparently accurate, that the little group about him passed rapidly from\r\na conviction of his insanity to a belief no less absurd--that he had\r\nbecome, in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or \"clairvoyant\" medium.\r\nSuch was the final conclusion to which his parents had arrived at the\r\ntime of the visit of the scientific committee. He had been classed with\r\nthat credulous school known to this century as spiritualists, and had\r\nbeen visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe committee having fully examined the boy, and a number of independent\r\nwitnesses, as to the facts, soon set about a scientific investigation of\r\nthe true causes of of the phenomenon. The first step, of course, was to\r\nexamine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope, an invention of\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a few years ago, by means of which\r\nthe depths of this organ can be explored, and the smallest variations\r\nfrom a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.\r\n\r\nThe mode of using the instrument is as follows: The room is made\r\nperfectly dark; a brilliant light is then placed near the head of the\r\npatient, and the rays are reflected by a series of small mirrors into\r\nhis eye, as if they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking\r\nthrough the central aperture of the instrument, the oculist can examine\r\nthe illuminated interior of the eyeball, and perceive every detail of\r\nstructure, healthy or morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see\r\nany part of the exterior of the body. No discomfort arises to the organ\r\nexamined, and all its hidden mysteries can be studied and understood as\r\nclearly as those of any other organ of the body.\r\n\r\nThis course was taken with John Palmer, and the true secret of his\r\nmysterious power of vision detected in an instant.\r\n\r\nOn applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained in a moment\r\nthat the boy's eye was abnormally shaped. A natural, perfect eye is\r\nperfectly round. But the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin,\r\nwith large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully dilated\r\npupil. The effect of the shape was at once apparent. It was utterly\r\nimpossible to see any object with distinctness at any distance short of\r\nmany thousands of miles. Had the eye been elongated inward, or shaped\r\nlike an egg--to as great an extent, the boy would have been effectually\r\nblind, for no combination of lens power could have placed the image of\r\nthe object beyond the coat of the retina. In other words, there are two\r\ncommon imperfections of the human organ of sight; one called _myopia_,\r\nor \"near-sightedness;\" the _presbyopia_, or \"far-sightedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"The axis being too long,\" says the report, \"in myopic eyes, parallel\r\nrays, such as proceed from distant objects, are brought to a focus at a\r\npoint so far in front of the retina, that only confused images are\r\nformed upon it. Such a malformation, constituting an excess of\r\nrefractive power, can only be neutralized by concave glasses, which give\r\nsuch a direction to rays entering the eye as will allow of their being\r\nbrought to a focus at a proper point for distant perception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Presbyopia is the reverse of all this. The antero-posterior axis of\r\nsuch eyes being too short, owing to the flat plate-like shape of the\r\nball, their refractive power is not sufficient to bring even parallel\r\nrays to a focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent rays\r\nonly. Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate for this quality by\r\nrendering parallel rays convergent; and such glasses, in ordinary cases,\r\nbring the rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,\r\ncorresponding to its degree of curvature.\" But in the case under\r\nexamination, no glass or combination of glasses could be invented\r\nsufficiently concave to remedy the malformation. By a mathematical\r\nproblem of easy solution, it was computed that the nearest distance from\r\nthe unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image could be formed\r\nupon the retina, was two hundred and forty thousand miles, a fraction\r\nshort of the mean distance of the moon from the earth; and hence it\r\nbecame perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute distinctness\r\nwhatever was transpiring on the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nSuch being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by science, the\r\ndeclaration of the lad assumed a far higher value than the mere dicta of\r\nspiritualists, or the mad ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at\r\nonce set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge they could by\r\nfrequent and prolonged night interviews with the boy.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first satisfactory\r\nexperiment was tried, testing beyond all cavil or doubt the powers of\r\nthe subject's eye. It was full moon, and that luminary rose clear and\r\ndazzlingly bright. The committee were on hand at an early hour, and the\r\nboy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits. The interview was\r\nsecret, and none but the members of the committee and the parents of the\r\nchild were present. Of course the first proposition to be settled was\r\nthat of the inhabitability of that sphere. This the boy had frequently\r\ndeclared was the case, and he had on several previous occasions\r\ndescribed minutely the form, size and means of locomotion of the\r\nLunarians. On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,\r\nwhat he had before related to his parents and friends, but was more\r\nminute, owing to the greater transparency of the atmosphere and the\r\nexperience in expression already acquired.\r\n\r\nThe Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves. They are less in\r\nheight, and altogether of a different appearance. When fully grown, they\r\nresemble somewhat a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at the\r\ncenter or axle. They have four eyes in the head, which is the axle, so\r\nto speak, and all the limbs branch out directly from the center, like\r\nsome sea-forms known as \"Radiates.\" They move by turning rapidly like a\r\nwheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air. The children are\r\nundeveloped in form, and are perfectly round, like a pumpkin or orange.\r\nAs they grow older, they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the\r\nwhole body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot wheel.\r\n\r\nThey are of different colors, or nationalities--bright red, orange and\r\nblue being the predominant hues. The reds are in a large majority. They\r\ndo no work, but sleep every four or five hours. They have no houses, and\r\nneed none. They have no clothing, and do not require it. There being no\r\nnight on the side of the moon fronting the sun, and no day on the\r\nopposite side, all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some\r\nkind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the sleeping\r\ngrounds on the shadow-side of the planet. They do not appear to go very\r\nfar over the dark rim, for they reappear in immense platoons in a few\r\nhours, and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface. They\r\nsleep and wake about six times in one ordinary day of twenty-four hours.\r\nTheir occupations cannot be discerned; they must be totally different\r\nfrom anything upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the moon is all hill and hollow. There are but few level\r\nspots, nor is there any water visible. The atmosphere is almost as\r\nrefined and light as hydrogen gas. There is no fire visible, nor are\r\nthere any volcanoes. Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be\r\nspent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves into squares,\r\ncircles, triangles, and other mathematical figures. They move always in\r\nvast crowds. No one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.\r\nThe children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of one family.\r\nIndividualism is unknown. They seem to spawn like herring or shad, or to\r\nbe propagated like bees, from the queen, in myriads. Motion is their\r\nnormal condition. The moment after a mathematical figure is formed, it\r\nis dissolved, and fresh combinations take place, like the atoms in a\r\nkaleidoscope. No other species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the\r\nilluminated face of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all metallic. Vegetable life\r\nnowhere exists; but the forms of some of the shrubs and trees are\r\nexceedingly beautiful. The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,\r\nand they appear to have all acquired their full growth. The ground is\r\nstrewn with flowers, but they are all formed of metals--gold, silver,\r\ncopper, and tin predominating. But there is a new kind of metal seen\r\neverywhere on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the earth. It is\r\nof a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent. The mountains are\r\nall of bare and burnt granite, and appear to have been melted with fire.\r\nThe committee called the attention of the boy to the bright \"sea of\r\nglass\" lately observed near the northern rim of the moon, and inquired\r\nof what it is composed. He examined it carefully, and gave such a minute\r\ndescription of it that it became apparent at once to the committee that\r\nit was pure mercury or quicksilver. The reason why it has but very\r\nrecently shown itself to astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears\r\nclose up to the line of demarcation separating the light and shadow upon\r\nthe moon's disk; and on closer inspection a distinct cataract of the\r\nfluid--in short, a metallic Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the\r\nnight side to the day side of the luminary. It has already filled up a\r\nvast plain--one of the four that exist on the moon's surface--and\r\nappears to be still emptying itself with very great rapidity and volume.\r\nIt covers an area of five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may\r\npossibly deluge one half the entire surface of the moon. It does not\r\nseem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants, as they were soon\r\nskating, so to speak, in platoons and battalions, over and across it. In\r\nfact, it presents the appearance of an immense park, to which the\r\nLunarians flock, and disport themselves with great gusto upon its\r\npolished face. One of the most beautiful sights yet seen by the lad was\r\nthe formation of a new figure, which he drew upon the sand with his\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nThe central heart was of crimson-colored natives; the one to the right\r\nof pale orange, and the left of bright blue. It was ten seconds in\r\nforming, and five seconds in dispersing. The number engaged in the\r\nevolution could not be less than half a million.\r\n\r\nThus has been solved one of the great astronomical questions of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe next evening the committee assembled earlier, so as to get a view of\r\nthe planet Venus before the moon rose. It was the first time that the\r\nlad's attention had been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the\r\nliveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of that\r\nresplendent world. It may here be stated that his power of vision, in\r\nlooking at the fixed stars, was no greater or less than that of an\r\nordinary eye. They appeared only as points of light, too far removed\r\ninto the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning their\r\nproperties. But the committee were doomed to a greater disappointment\r\nwhen they inquired of the boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus. He\r\nreplied, \"Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I see nothing\r\nwith distinctness.\" The solution of the difficulty was easily\r\napprehended, and at once surmised. The focus of the eye was fixed by\r\nnature at 240,000 miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth\r\nbeing 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to observe that\r\nplanet's surface with distinctness. Still she appeared greatly enlarged,\r\ncovering about one hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with\r\nunimaginable splendor.\r\n\r\nExperiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally futile, and the committee\r\nhalf sorrowfully turned again to the inspection of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe report then proceeds at great length to give full descriptions of\r\nthe most noted geographical peculiarities of the lunar surface, and\r\ncorrects many errors fallen into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor.\r\nProfessor Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much better\r\nknown to astronomers than the surface of the earth is to geographers;\r\nfor there are two zones on the globe within the Arctic and Antarctic\r\ncircles, that we can never examine. But every nook and cranny of the\r\nilluminated face of the moon has been fully delineated, examined and\r\nnamed, so that no object greater than sixty feet square exists but has\r\nbeen seen and photographed by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la\r\nRuis' camera and apparatus. As the entire report will be ordered\r\npublished at the next weekly meeting of the College, we refrain from\r\nfurther extracts, but now proceed to narrate the results of our own\r\ninterviews with the boy.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876, that we ventured\r\nwith rather a misgiving heart to approach Culp Hill, and the humble\r\nresidence of a child destined, before the year is out, to become the\r\nmost celebrated of living beings. We armed ourselves with a pound of\r\nsugar candy for the boy, some _muslin-de-laine_ as a present to the\r\nmother, and a box of cigars for the father. We also took with us a very\r\nlarge-sized opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller. At\r\nfirst we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting the cigars,\r\na qualified negative; and finally, when the muslin and candy were drawn\r\non the enemy, we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a seat.\r\nThe boy was pale and restless, and his eyes without bandage or glasses.\r\nWe soon ingratiated ourself into the good opinion of the whole party,\r\nand henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our investigations.\r\nThe moon being nearly full, we first of all verified the tests by the\r\ncommittee. These were all perfectly satisfactory and reliable.\r\nRequesting, then, to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of\r\ninspecting Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in obtaining\r\nthe history of the child, which we have given above.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars being at this time almost in dead opposition to the sun,\r\nand with the earth in conjunction, is of course as near to the earth as\r\nhe ever approaches, the distance being thirty-five millions of miles. He\r\nrises toward midnight, and is in the constellation Virgo, where he may\r\nbe seen to the greatest possible advantage, being in perigee. Mars is\r\nmost like the earth of all the planetary bodies. He revolves on his axis\r\nin a little over twenty-four hours, and his surface is pleasantly\r\nvariegated with land and water, pretty much like our own world--the\r\nland, however, being in slight excess. He is, therefore, the most\r\ninteresting of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nHaving all things in readiness, we directed the glass to the planet.\r\nAlas, for all our calculations, the power was insufficient to clear away\r\nthe obscurity resulting from imperfect vision and short focus.\r\n\r\nSwallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily made arrangements for\r\nanother interview, with a telescope, and bade the family good night.\r\n\r\nThere is but one large telescope properly mounted in the city, and that\r\nis the property and pride of its accomplished owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq.\r\nWe at once procured an interview with that gentleman, and it was agreed\r\nthat on Saturday evening the boy should be conveyed to his residence,\r\npicturesquely situated on Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of\r\nthe Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself presented\r\nourselves at the door of that hospitable mansion. We were cordially\r\nwelcomed, and conducted without further parley into the lofty\r\nobservatory on the top of the house. In due time the magnificent tube\r\nwas presented at the planet, but it was discovered that the power it was\r\nset for was too low. It was then gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the\r\nfull strength of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed\r\nat the eye-glass. One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight told the story!\r\nMars, and its mountains and seas, its rivers, vales, and estuaries, its\r\npolar snow-caps and grassy plains--its inhabitants, palaces, ships,\r\nvillages and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and\r\ncertainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits of the Sierra\r\nNevada range, beheld the stupendous panorama of the Sacramento Valley,\r\nand the snow-clad summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_THE EMERALD ISLE._\r\n\r\n\r\n    Chaos was ended. From its ruins rolled\r\n    The central Sun, poised on his throne of gold;\r\n    The changeful Moon, that floods the hollow dome\r\n    Of raven midnight with her silvery foam;\r\n    Vast constellations swarming all around,\r\n    In seas of azure, without line or bound,\r\n    And this green globe, rock-ribbed and mountain-crown'd.\r\n\r\n    The eye of God, before His hand had made\r\n    Man in His image, this wide realm surveyed;\r\n    O'er hill and valley, over stream and wood,\r\n    He glanced triumphant, and pronounced it \"good.\"\r\n    But ere He formed old Adam and his bride,\r\n    He called a shining seraph to His side,\r\n    And pointing to our world, that gleamed afar,\r\n    And twinkled on creation's verge, a star,\r\n    Bade him float 'round this new and narrow span\r\n    And bring report if all were ripe for Man.\r\n    The angel spread his fluttering pinions fair,\r\n    And circled thrice the circumambient air;\r\n    Quick, then, as thought, he stood before the gate\r\n    Where cherubs burn, and minist'ring spirits wait.\r\n    Nor long he stood, for God beheld his plume,\r\n    Already tarnished by terrestrial gloom,\r\n    And beck'ning kindly to the flurried aid,\r\n    Said, \"Speak your wish; if good, be it obeyed.\"\r\n    The seraph raised his gem-encircled hand,\r\n    Obeisance made, at heaven's august command,\r\n    And thus replied, in tones so bold and clear,\r\n    That angels turned and lent a listening ear:\r\n    \"Lord of all systems, be they near or far,\r\n    Thrice have I circled 'round yon beauteous Star,\r\n    I've seen its mountains rise, its rivers roll,\r\n    Its oceans sweep majestic to each pole;\r\n    Its floors in mighty continents expand,\r\n    Or dwindle into specs of fairy-land;\r\n    Its prairies spread, its forests stretch in pride,\r\n    And all its valleys dazzle like a bride;\r\n    Hymns have I heard in all its winds and streams,\r\n    And beauty seen in all its rainbow gleams.\r\n    But whilst the LAND can boast of every gem\r\n    That sparkles in each seraph's diadem;\r\n    Whilst diamonds blaze 'neath dusk Golconda's skies,\r\n    And rubies bleed where Alps and Andes rise;\r\n    Whilst in Brazilian brooks the topaz shines,\r\n    And opals burn in California mines;\r\n    Whilst in the vales of Araby the Blest\r\n    The sapphire flames beside the amethyst:\r\n    The pauper Ocean sobs forever more,\r\n    Ungemm'd, unjeweled, on its wailing shore!\"\r\n\r\n    \"What wouldst thou do?\" responded heaven's great King.\r\n    \"Add music to the song the breakers sing!\"\r\n    The strong-soul'd seraph cried, \"I'd make yon sea\r\n    Rival in tone heaven's sweetest minstrelsy;\r\n    I'd plant within the ocean's bubbling tide\r\n    An island gem, of every sea the pride!\r\n    So bright in robes of ever-living green,\r\n    In breath so sweet, in features so serene,\r\n    Such crystal streams to course its valleys fair,\r\n    Such healthful gales to purify its air,\r\n    Such fertile soil, such ever-verdant trees,\r\n    Angels should name it 'EMERALD OF THE SEAS!'\"\r\n\r\n    The seraph paused, and downward cast his eyes,\r\n    Whilst heav'nly hosts stood throbbing with surprise.\r\n    Again the Lord of all the realms above,\r\n    Supreme in might, but infinite in love,\r\n    With no harsh accent in His tones replied:\r\n    \"Go, drop this Emerald in the envious tide!\"\r\n\r\n    Quick as the lightning cleaves the concave blue,\r\n    The seraph seized the proffer'd gem, and flew\r\n    Until he reached the confines of the earth,\r\n    Still struggling in the throes of turbid birth;\r\n    And there, upon his self-sustaining wing,\r\n    Sat poised, and heard our globe her matins sing;\r\n    Beheld the sun traverse the arching sky,\r\n    The sister Moon walk forth in majesty;\r\n    Saw every constellation rise and roll\r\n    Athwart the heaven, or circle round the pole.\r\n    Nor did he move, until our spotted globe\r\n    Had donned for him her morn and evening robe;\r\n    Till on each land his critic eye was cast,\r\n    And every ocean rose, and heav'd, and pass'd;\r\n    Then, like some eagle pouncing on its prey,\r\n    He downward sail'd, through bellowing clouds and spray,\r\n    To where he saw the billows bounding free,\r\n    And dropped the gem within the stormy sea!\r\n\r\n    And would'st thou know, Chief of St. Patrick's band,\r\n    Where fell this jewel from the seraph's hand?\r\n    What ocean caught the world-enriching prize?\r\n    O! Child of Moina, homeward cast your eyes!\r\n    Lo! in the midst of wat'ry deserts wide,\r\n    Behold the EMERALD bursting through the tide,\r\n    And bearing on its ever vernal-sod\r\n    The monogram of seraph, and of God!\r\n\r\n    Its name, the sweetest human lips e'er sung,\r\n    First trembled on an angel's fervid tongue;\r\n    Then chimed Æolian on the evening air,\r\n    Lisped by an infant, in its mother prayer;\r\n    Next roared in war, with battle's flag unfurl'd;\r\n    Now, gemm'd with glory, gather'd through the world!\r\n    What name! Perfidious Albion, blush with shame:\r\n    It is thy sister's! ERIN IS THE NAME!\r\n\r\n    Once more the seraph stood before the throne\r\n    Of dread Omnipotence, pensive and alone.\r\n    \"What hast thou done?\" Heaven's Monarch sadly sigh'd.\r\n    \"I dropped the jewel in the flashing tide,\"\r\n    The seraph said; but saw with vision keen\r\n    A mightier angel stalk upon the scene,\r\n    Whose voice like grating thunder smote his ear\r\n    And taught his soul the mystery of fear.\r\n\r\n    \"Because thy heart with impious pride did swell,\r\n    And dared make better what thy God made well;\r\n    Because thy hand did fling profanely down\r\n    On Earth a jewel wrenched from Heaven's bright crown,\r\n    The Isle which thine own fingers did create\r\n    Shall reap a blessing and a curse from fate!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE.\r\n\r\n    Far in the future, as the years roll on,\r\n    And all the pagan ages shall have flown;\r\n    When Christian virtues, flaming into light,\r\n    Shall save the world from superstition's night;\r\n    Erin, oppress'd, shall bite the tyrant's heel,\r\n    And for a thousand years enslaved shall kneel;\r\n    Her sons shall perish in the field and flood,\r\n    Her daughters starve in city, wold, and wood;\r\n    Her patriots, with their blood, the block shall stain,\r\n    Her matrons fly behind the Western main;\r\n    Harpies from Albion shall her strength consume,\r\n    And thorns and thistles in her gardens bloom.\r\n    But, curse of curses thine, O! fated land:\r\n    Traitors shall thrive where statesmen ought to stand!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLESSING.\r\n\r\n    But past her heritage of woe and pain,\r\n    A far more blest millennium shall reign;\r\n    Seedlings of heroes shall her exiles be,\r\n    Where'er they find a home beyond the sea;\r\n    Bright paragons of beauty and of truth,\r\n    Her maidens all shall dazzle in their youth;\r\n    And when age comes, to dim the flashing eye,\r\n    Still gems of virtue shall they live, and die!\r\n    No braver race shall breathe beneath the sun\r\n    Than thine, O!

FLANNAGAN'S REPORT.\r\n\r\n                                     BRUGES, December 12, 1872.\r\n\r\n   To THE HON. HAMILTON FISH,\r\n                     Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n   SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from\r\n   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof. Henry of the\r\n   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof. Lovering of Harvard), I\r\n   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the\r\n   \"International Exploring Works,\" and beg leave to submit the\r\n   following circumstantial report:\r\n\r\n   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at\r\n   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North\r\n   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of\r\n   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming\r\n   events have arisen. It will be remembered by the State Department\r\n   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government\r\n   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition\r\n   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,\r\n   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to\r\n   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an \"International Board for\r\n   Subterranean Exploration\" in furtherance of science, and in\r\n   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous\r\n   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward\r\n   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the\r\n   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the\r\n   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and\r\n   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English\r\n   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,\r\n   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the\r\n   manufacturing centers of Europe.\r\n\r\n   The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.\r\n   Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick\r\n   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great\r\n   Britain. To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,\r\n   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of\r\n   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.\r\n\r\n   The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the\r\n   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the\r\n   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the\r\n   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board\r\n   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each\r\n   country.\r\n\r\n   It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few\r\n   months after the organization of the commission. Prof. Watson, of\r\n   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called \"Prairie\r\n   Geology,\" was selected by President Fillmore, as the first\r\n   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;\r\n   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present\r\n   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr. Secchi, since so\r\n   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.\r\n   These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an\r\n   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of\r\n   operations was selected. Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the\r\n   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the\r\n   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\n\r\n   The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were\r\n   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the\r\n   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of\r\n   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.\r\n   Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated\r\n   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;\r\n   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,\r\n   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the\r\n   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of\r\n   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at\r\n   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the\r\n   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not\r\n   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific\r\n   appliances.\r\n\r\n   There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at\r\n   least one member of the commission, Prof. Watson, overrode them\r\n   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its\r\n   main characteristic.\r\n\r\n   The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,\r\n   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal\r\n   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant\r\n   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of\r\n   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being\r\n   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by\r\n   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that \"the globe\r\n   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated\r\n   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very\r\n   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its\r\n   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten\r\n   to two hundred miles. During the process of gradual\r\n   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly\r\n   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being\r\n   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner\r\n   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also\r\n   producing all volcanic action.\" The arguments in favor of this\r\n   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most\r\n   prominent:\r\n\r\n   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous\r\n   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial\r\n   revolution similar to that of our earth. Not many years ago\r\n   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most\r\n   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal\r\n   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a\r\n   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of\r\n   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt\r\n   in his \"Cosmos.\"\r\n\r\n   _Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases\r\n   with depth, in all subterranean excavations. This is the\r\n   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must\r\n   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,\r\n   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining\r\n   would have to be abandoned. The rate of increase has been\r\n   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant\r\n   portions of the globe. A few of them may be mentioned at this\r\n   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that\r\n   led to the present most deplorable results.\r\n\r\n   The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,\r\n   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines\r\n   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one\r\n   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.\r\n\r\n   In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the\r\n   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the\r\n   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred\r\n   feet. The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr. Fox, at\r\n   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average\r\n   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.\r\n\r\n   Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in\r\n   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and\r\n   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an\r\n   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in\r\n   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one\r\n   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.\r\n   Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat\r\n   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree\r\n   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of\r\n   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure.\r\n\r\n   _Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when\r\n   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed\r\n   from a common source; and\r\n\r\n   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change\r\n   of climate indicated by fossils.\r\n\r\n   The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less\r\n   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.\r\n\r\n   At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of\r\n   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and\r\n   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees\r\n   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of\r\n   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of\r\n   the mine. Of course, without ventilation no human being could\r\n   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of\r\n   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful\r\ncontrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only\r\na portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:\r\n\r\n   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten\r\n   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone\r\n   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the\r\n   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century. The rise\r\n   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to\r\n   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that\r\n   of the Mersey at Liverpool. The commissioners determined to\r\n   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive\r\n   steam works at the mouth of the mine. A plan was submitted by\r\n   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted. Turbine wheels were built,\r\n   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the\r\n   rise and fall of the tide. Gates were also constructed between\r\n   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet\r\n   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the\r\n   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the\r\n   machinery. Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron\r\n   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred\r\n   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of\r\n   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two\r\n   hundred atmospheres. These reservoirs were properly connected\r\n   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron\r\n   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost\r\n   nominal cost. It was by the same power of compressed air that the\r\n   tunneling through Mount St. Gothard was effected for the Lyons\r\n   and Turin Railway, just completed.\r\n\r\n   The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an\r\n   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure. This consumed\r\n   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of\r\n   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850. But from\r\n   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the\r\n   excavation steadily progressed. I neglected to state at the\r\n   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was\r\n   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that\r\n   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the\r\n   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter\r\n   fully narrated.\r\n\r\n   As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to\r\n   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the\r\n   calculations of the experts. After attaining the depth of fifteen\r\n   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.\r\n   Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the\r\n   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were\r\n   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio\r\n   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface\r\n   downward. Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at\r\n   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface. As\r\n   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if\r\n   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some\r\n   atheromatous or adiathermic covering. Professor Tyndall was\r\n   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast\r\n   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies. As the result of\r\n   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of\r\n   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of\r\n   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon\r\n   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the\r\n   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an\r\n   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,\r\n   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the\r\n   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day. The drilling was\r\n   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the\r\n   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the\r\n   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping\r\n   the drill-point _in situ_.\r\n\r\n   Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a\r\n   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st\r\n   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily\r\n   established. First in importance is the one alluded to above--the\r\n   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of\r\n   the earth. This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the\r\n   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by\r\n   all the scientists, living or dead. No one had for a moment\r\n   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a\r\n   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De\r\n   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_\r\n   and not as a ponderable quality.\r\n\r\n   But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse\r\n   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the\r\n   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule. Thus, while\r\n   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred\r\n   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one\r\n   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only\r\n   fifteen thousand feet above that level. This, we know, is owing\r\n   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a\r\n   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it. The\r\n   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being\r\n   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent. But\r\n   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere\r\n   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance\r\n   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious\r\n   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward. Its action also was\r\n   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it\r\n   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not\r\n   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at\r\n   for the time being. As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, \"The hands\r\n   of the magnetic clock stopped.\" But the activity of the needle\r\n   gradually increased as the surface was approached.\r\n\r\n   All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the\r\n   theory, of Professor Faraday, that \"electricity is a force\r\n   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that\r\n   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right\r\n   angles to its current.\" Hence electricity, from the nature of its\r\n   cause, must be superficial.\r\n\r\n   Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000\r\n   feet. From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic\r\n   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite\r\n   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery\r\n   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,\r\n   instead of _igneous_ deposition. As a corollary from the law of\r\n   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize\r\n   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was\r\n   reached in 1869. No amount of heat affected it in the least\r\n   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest\r\n   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found\r\n   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or\r\n   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of\r\nthe earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only\r\ntruncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the\r\nlatitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg. 20 min. N., and one or two other problems.\r\nThe concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.\r\n\r\n   For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the\r\n   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover\r\n   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the\r\n   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two\r\n   years. However, important results had been obtained, and a\r\n   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the\r\n   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks. In fact, the enormous\r\n   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured\r\n   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the\r\n   floor of the shaft building! The highest peak of the Himalayas is\r\n   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that\r\n   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the\r\n   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.\r\n\r\n   The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November\r\n   1. The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages\r\n   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the\r\n   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were\r\n   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from\r\n   cyncope. Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent\r\n   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon\r\n   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar. But the miners went\r\n   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as\r\n   human endurance could bear it. But this was not to be much\r\n   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible\r\n   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco\r\n   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of\r\n   asphyxia. The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,\r\n   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials\r\n   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in\r\n   the flames. At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another\r\n   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more\r\n   than 1000 feet at the other end. The detonations became more\r\n   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,\r\n   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice. A\r\n   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,\r\n   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious\r\n   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into\r\n   the still darkened atmosphere of night. At this time at least one\r\n   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the\r\n   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and\r\n   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and\r\n   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and\r\n   even to the now terrified miners. Finally, just before dawn, on\r\n   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty\r\n   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the\r\n   surface!\r\n\r\n   The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed\r\n   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire\r\n   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed\r\n   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur. The plains around were\r\n   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and\r\n   reduplicated the effects of the illumination. Toward sunrise the\r\n   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after\r\n   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,\r\n   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it\r\n   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction. It was at this\r\n   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,\r\n   lost his life. As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted\r\n   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders\r\n   to another. Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he\r\n   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded\r\n   his body was consumed to a crisp. I regret to add that his fate\r\n   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they\r\n   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,\r\n   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the\r\n   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal. Thus are\r\n   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a\r\n   plebeian mob.\r\n\r\n   It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the\r\n   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.\r\n   But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.\r\n   Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the\r\n   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils\r\n   are almost incalculable. The Belgian Government was duly notified\r\n   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous\r\n   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the\r\n   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was\r\n   dispatched to the spot to maintain order. But this interference\r\n   only made matters worse. The discontent, augmented by the wildest\r\n   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme. Nor could\r\n   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the\r\n   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,\r\n   and about midnight set the town on fire. The lurid glare of the\r\n   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their\r\n   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant\r\n   several miles from the spot. A meeting was called at the\r\n   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed. But\r\n   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,\r\n   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed. The government from\r\n   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could\r\n   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges. In this\r\n   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been\r\n   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established\r\n   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost\r\n   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the\r\n   limits of the danger. In the mean time, a congress of the most\r\n   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose\r\n   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the\r\n   devastation. The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in\r\n   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the\r\n   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the\r\n   members elect of the college. As in duty bound, I felt called on\r\n   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of\r\n   the proceedings.\r\n\r\n   Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr. Kirchoff\r\n   officiated as secretary.\r\n\r\n   Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the\r\n   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only\r\n   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action.\r\n   \"There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of,\" said he,\r\n   \"and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving\r\n   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly\r\n   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a\r\n   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim\r\n   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter. Thus, whenever\r\n   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active\r\n   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently\r\n   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes.\"\r\n\r\n   Palmieri then asked the speaker \"if he wished to be understood as\r\n   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being\r\n   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law\r\n   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could\r\n   rise?\"\r\n\r\n   Gassiot replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n   The Neapolitan philosopher then added: \"I dissent _in toto_ from\r\n   the opinion of M. Gassiot. For more than a quarter of a century I\r\n   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, Ætna and Stromboli, and\r\n   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw\r\n   in His mechanism of the globe. The truth is, that molten lava can\r\n   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to\r\n   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts\r\n   at that height all centrifugal energy. Were this not so, the\r\n   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent\r\n   center and fly off into surrounding space.\"\r\n\r\n   M. Gassiot replied, \"that true volcanoes were supplied by nature\r\n   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their\r\n   craters, they ceased to flow. But in the instance before us no\r\n   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could\r\n   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he\r\n   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all\r\n   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size.\"\r\n\r\n   Palmieri again responded, \"that he had no doubt but that the\r\n   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up\r\n   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,\r\n   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds\r\n   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply\r\n   ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n   Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited\r\n   tone, when Prof. Palmieri \"disclaimed any intention of personal\r\n   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint.\" He then\r\n   proceeded: \"The lava bed of Mount Ætna maintains a normal level\r\n   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than\r\n   one half that altitude. On the other hand, according to Prof.\r\n   Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich\r\n   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet. It\r\n   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true\r\n   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten\r\n   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when\r\n   controlled by the moon.\" It was seen at once that the scientists\r\n   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its\r\n   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the\r\n   close of the session, the members were equally divided between\r\n   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri. A further session will take\r\n   place on the arrival of Prof. Tyndall, who has been telegraphed\r\n   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and\r\n   astronomer, Tugenieff.\r\n\r\n   In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as\r\n   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the\r\n   formation of a basaltic dyke across it more than two hundred feet\r\n   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about\r\n   thirty thousand acres of valuable land. At the same time it is\r\n   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch\r\n   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and\r\n   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.\r\n\r\n   In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of\r\n   the United States in originating the work that led to the\r\n   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign\r\n   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State\r\n   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum\r\n   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States\r\n   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by\r\n   the conflagration of Dudzeele.\r\n\r\n   I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,\r\n   and rejoice to learn that Prof. Agassiz has returned from the\r\n   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.\r\n\r\n   With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,\r\n                                United States Consul at Bruges.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did\r\n   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory\r\n   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and\r\n   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his\r\n   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that \"Holland,\r\n   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of\r\n   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the\r\n   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the\r\n   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of\r\n   basalt.\" The reason given was this: \"That lava must continue to\r\n   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic\r\n   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the\r\n   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's\r\n   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of\r\n   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great\r\n   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created\r\n   cone could obtain the necessary altitude. Before _Ætna_ attained\r\n   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as\r\n   France; and Prof. Whitney has demonstrated that some center of\r\n   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw\r\n   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic\r\n   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a\r\n   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome.\" In concluding his\r\n   remarks, he ventured the prediction that \"the North Sea would be\r\n   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected\r\n   with the Continent.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  J. F., U.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_WILDEY'S DREAM._\r\n\r\n\r\n    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,\r\n          Just fifty years ago,\r\n    And struck in his might, to the left and right,\r\n          The iron all aglow.\r\n    And fast and far, as each miniature star\r\n          Illumined the dusky air,\r\n    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,\r\n          Like the aureola of prayer.\r\n\r\n    And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,\r\n          Just fifty years ago,\r\n    Of the sins that start in the human heart\r\n          When _its_ metal is all aglow;\r\n    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,\r\n          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,\r\n    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs\r\n          That environ the human soul!\r\n\r\n    When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,\r\n          With center in self alone,\r\n    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,\r\n          In the sweep of its mighty zone;\r\n    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,\r\n          He gazed from his swarthy home,\r\n    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,\r\n          That covered the world with its dome!\r\n\r\n    'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march\r\n          All peoples went wailing by,\r\n    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,\r\n          To the grave that was yawning nigh,\r\n    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows\r\n          On the iron that was aglow,\r\n    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,\r\n          Just fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n    He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,\r\n    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;\r\n    Men of all nations, and of every clime,\r\n    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,\r\n    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,\r\n    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.\r\n\r\n    First came Osiris, with his Memphian band\r\n    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;\r\n    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,\r\n    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.\r\n    From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,\r\n    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.\r\n    Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose\r\n    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;\r\n    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,\r\n    With tombs inscribed--\"Here lies a realm of slaves.\"\r\n\r\n    Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,\r\n    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,\r\n    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,\r\n    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.\r\n    He saw the walls of Babylon arise,\r\n    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,\r\n    And bear upon their airy ramparts old\r\n    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.\r\n    Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade\r\n    All woes and vices had their coverts made;\r\n    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,\r\n    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,\r\n    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,\r\n    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.\r\n\r\n    Then came the Persian, with his vast array\r\n    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,\r\n    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,\r\n    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.\r\n    On every side there rose a bloody screen,\r\n    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.\r\n    Behold that warrior! in his pomp and pride,\r\n    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;\r\n    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,\r\n    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,\r\n    And happy only amid war's alarms,\r\n    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;\r\n    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,\r\n    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.\r\n    Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,\r\n    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;\r\n    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,\r\n    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;\r\n    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,\r\n    And sink all nations into servient slaves.\r\n\r\n    As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,\r\n    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;\r\n    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;\r\n    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;\r\n    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;\r\n    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.\r\n\r\n    The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;\r\n    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.\r\n    \"Come!\" cried a low voice full of music sweet,\r\n    \"Come!\" and an angel touched his trembling feet.\r\n    Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,\r\n    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;\r\n    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,\r\n    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.\r\n\r\n    Again he stood at his anvil good\r\n      With an angel by his side,\r\n    And rested his sledge on its iron edge\r\n      And blew up his bellows wide;\r\n    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,\r\n      Then murmured in accent low:\r\n    \"All ready am I your bidding to try\r\n      So far as a mortal may go.\"\r\n\r\n    'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,\r\n      And breathed in his softest tone,\r\n    \"Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air\r\n      As it mounted toward the throne.\r\n    God weaveth no task for mortals to ask\r\n      Beyond a mortal's control,\r\n    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs\r\n      That encompass the human soul.\r\n\r\n    \"But go you first forth 'mong the sons of the earth,\r\n      And bring me a human heart\r\n    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,\r\n      And acts still a brother's part.\r\n    The night groweth late, but here will I wait\r\n      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;\r\n    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,\r\n      And search with _my_ angel eyes.\"\r\n\r\n    The dreamer once more passed the open door,\r\n      But plumed for an angel's flight;\r\n    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled\r\n      When the clouds are alive with light;\r\n    He followed the sun till his race was won,\r\n      And probed every heart and mind;\r\n    But in every zone man labored alone\r\n      For himself and not for his kind.\r\n\r\n    All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,\r\n      The dreamer returned to his home,\r\n    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,\r\n      Besprinkled with dew and foam.\r\n    \"The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught\r\n      In the flame that is all aglow.\"\r\n    \"No heart could I find that was true to its kind,\r\n      So I left all the world in its woe.\"\r\n\r\n    Then the stern angel cried: \"In your own throbbing side\r\n      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;\r\n    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife\r\n      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?\"\r\n    \"Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,\r\n      And sinful my sorrowing heart;\r\n    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,\r\n      With life I am willing to part.\"\r\n\r\n    Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast\r\n      To the angel's glittering blade;\r\n    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide\r\n      From the wound that the weapon had made.\r\n    With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,\r\n      And buried it deep in the flame\r\n    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell\r\n      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame.\r\n\r\n    \"Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs\r\n      That environ the human soul;\r\n    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might\r\n      The heart in yon blistering bowl.\"\r\n    Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,\r\n      Beat the heart that was all aglow,\r\n    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars\r\n      Illumined the night with their flow.\r\n\r\n    Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge\r\n      Of wounds that were healed long ago;\r\n    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm\r\n      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.\r\n    But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,\r\n      For the angel was holding the heart,\r\n    And cried at each blow, \"Strike high!\" or \"Strike low!\"\r\n      \"Strike hither!\" or \"Yonder apart!\"\r\n\r\n    So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought\r\n      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;\r\n    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,\r\n      _But left on the anvil a chain!_\r\n    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,\r\n      As pure as the fountain of youth;\r\n    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,\r\n      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.\r\n\r\n    The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke\r\n      At the anvil that slept by his side;\r\n    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,\r\n      The triple-linked chain he espied.\r\n    Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,\r\n      Our emblem in age and in youth;\r\n    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,\r\n      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_WHITHERWARD._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the\r\nvagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of\r\nloveliness and in similitudes of heaven.\r\n\r\nBy an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive\r\nin the direction of himself. This law is traceable from the molehill up\r\nto the mountain, from the mite up to the man. Geology, speaking to us\r\nfrom the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the\r\nimperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous\r\ntruth. Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as\r\nwe unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in\r\ncreation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the\r\nmighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!\r\n\r\nIn the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,\r\na boiling flood of lava. The elements were then unborn. Time was not;\r\nfor as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos. The sun\r\nhad not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure\r\nconcave the paths they were to tread. The planets were not worlds, but\r\nshot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.\r\nComets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their\r\nhorrid skirts of fire. The Spirit of God had not \"moved upon the face of\r\nthe waters,\" and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand. But\r\nchanges were at work. As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable\r\ndepths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,\r\ndestined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the\r\nlaws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.\r\n\r\nAn eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away. A new era dawned\r\nupon the earth. The gases were generated, and the elements of air and\r\nwater overspread the globe. Islands began to appear, at first presenting\r\npinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and\r\ndecomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.\r\n\r\nOne after another the sensational universe now springs into being. This\r\nbut prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the\r\ngroundwork and basis for the human. Man then came forth, the result of\r\nall her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.\r\n\r\nReason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet\r\naffections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God\r\ncalls him His child. He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and\r\ncommences its subjection. One by one the elements have yielded to his\r\nsway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven\r\nthrown wide its portals to his spirit. He stands now upon the very acme\r\nof the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and\r\nanxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous\r\nword--WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy slope of\r\nTelegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the\r\nwest, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa\r\nhills. I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand\r\nproblem of futurity. The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea\r\nof silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of\r\nthe setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold. The city lay\r\nlike a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at\r\nintervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs. The hours of\r\nbusiness I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since\r\ngrated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the\r\nnight. But I felt that my labors had just commenced. The duties of my\r\nprofession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to\r\nthe cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their\r\nthraldom that I found myself in truth a slave. The one master-thought\r\ncame back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in\r\nletters of fire--WHITHERWARD! WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\nThe past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,\r\nwith its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory. Italy\r\ncame with her republics, her \"starry\" Galileo, and her immortal\r\nBuonarotti. France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her\r\nNapoleons in chains. England rose up with her arts and her arms, her\r\ncommerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame. I beheld\r\nNewton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw\r\nRussell expiring on the scaffold. But ever and anon a pale,\r\nthorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a\r\ncross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but\r\nspeechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open\r\non my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above. Judea would\r\nthen pass with solemn tread before me. Her patriarchs, her prophets and\r\nher apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and\r\nwent like the phantasmagoria of a dream. The present then rose up in\r\nglittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow\r\nencircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud\r\nabove of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled\r\nand subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Earth's physical history also swept by in full\r\nreview. All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no\r\nmeans uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I\r\nseemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,\r\nread or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide\r\nheavens before me.\r\n\r\nThe actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an\r\nimmense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides\r\nI saw inscribed a faithful history of the past. Its foundations were in\r\ndeep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its\r\nsummit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.\r\n\r\nInscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in\r\nalternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: \"_Granite_, _Liquid_,\r\n_Gas_, _Electricity_;\" on another, \"_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,\r\n_Human_;\" on the third side, \"_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,\r\n_Imagination_;\" and on the fourth, \"_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,\r\n_Love_.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the\r\nbase of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward. He then placed his foot\r\nupon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit. I caught\r\na distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and\r\nswarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot. He toiled slowly\r\nupward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and\r\nI observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.\r\nThey now resembled those of an American Indian. He passed the second\r\nlayer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me\r\nfor observation. Another change had overspread it, and I readily\r\nrecognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan. As he\r\nreached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I\r\ncaught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high\r\nforehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of\r\nthe true Caucasian.\r\n\r\nI now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,\r\nand that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in\r\nreality a level plain. In a few moments more, the figure I had traced\r\nfrom the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with\r\nfolded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit. His lips parted as\r\nif about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in\r\ndistinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen\r\nto my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because\r\nunanswered--WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\n\"Whitherward, indeed!\" exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral\r\nsound of my voice. \"Home,\" responded a tiny voice at my side, and\r\nturning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little\r\nschool-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached\r\nme unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I\r\nspoke. \"Yes, little daughter,\" replied I, \"'tis time to proceed\r\nhomeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the\r\nevening star is visible in the west. I will attend you home,\" and taking\r\nher proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still\r\nringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nMidnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee. The\r\ncandle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering\r\nglimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber\r\nvisited my eyelids. My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and\r\nexcited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart\r\nand brain.\r\n\r\nI had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now\r\nperceived, when too late, the perils of my situation. Above me were\r\ndense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me\r\nhowling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving\r\nbillows, which no oil could calm. I thought of Plato struggling with his\r\ndoubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his\r\npoison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair. I remembered how all\r\nthe great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the\r\nsame thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and\r\nas I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and\r\nagain--WHITHERWARD! WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\nI could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart\r\nfrom Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin. I had followed\r\nher into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods. No\r\ncoquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair. Her robes are\r\nwoven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits\r\nimpassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair. The\r\nlight she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the\r\nbright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the\r\nsoul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the\r\nscene only to show its utter desolation.\r\n\r\nThe Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there. Its\r\nlessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was\r\ncased in pride. It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an\r\nocean of doubt. It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of\r\nan angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my\r\nconscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my\r\nmental acquirements. The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of\r\nthe straight sect of the Pharisees. Its promises were directed to the\r\npoor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely\r\nglancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable\r\npassage in one of Paul's epistles: \"That was not _first_ which is\r\nspiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is\r\nspiritual. Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but\r\nwe shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the\r\nlast trump.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection\r\nthan at first appeared in the words. Slowly a light broke in on the\r\nhorizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that\r\nthe past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the\r\nhuman soul, lit up by the torch of science! and guided by the\r\nprophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,\r\nand read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement. St. Paul\r\nevidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its\r\napplicability to man. He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in\r\nphilosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;\r\nthat man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of\r\nHis creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is\r\nbarren, and can produce no being superior to himself. On the contrary,\r\nhe clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science\r\nis demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first\r\nlaw, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone\r\nforth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!\r\n\r\nSuch were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up\r\nlike a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night. I was glad that\r\nthe shadows were gone. Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that\r\npoor flame which renders it visible. But I had suddenly grown rich in\r\nthought. A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had\r\nwandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it\r\nwould be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish. One letter had\r\nbeen identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually\r\ndecipher the inscription on the pyramid. What are these spectral\r\napparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by\r\nmortals _hints_? Whence do they come? Who lodges them in the chambers of\r\nthe mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and\r\nbear?\r\n\r\nThe Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the\r\ntelescope to observe them. Columbus caught another, as it was whispered\r\nby the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World. Franklin\r\nbeheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to\r\ntheir bourn. Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,\r\nand he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.\r\n\r\nRapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so\r\nlong tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.\r\nPaul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most\r\nunwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be\r\ncalled sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more\r\npowerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.\r\n\r\nI beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained. Whilst\r\nmy eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and\r\nalmost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking\r\nsong flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose\r\nshadow I found myself reclining. Before my surprise had vanished, I\r\nbeheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree\r\nwhich was blooming above me. It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the\r\nbranches, and commenced spinning its cocoon. Hardly had it finished its\r\nsilken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,\r\nspreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens. Quickly succeeding\r\nthis, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of\r\nTelegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view. It\r\nwas in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and\r\nthe identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the\r\ntop. I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or\r\ngreets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are\r\nwhistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many\r\nmoments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it\r\ncovered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and\r\nfertile fields. But the human figure still stood upon its crest. Then\r\ncame forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the\r\nmorn of a world-changing battle. Cæsar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at\r\nJerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nNo lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker\r\nthan the transformation which now overspread the earth. In a second of\r\ntime it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.\r\nBut in every other respect it preserved its identity. On casting my eyes\r\ntoward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his\r\nposition, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth. He appeared to\r\nbe floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere. His\r\nfeatures were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression\r\nof superhuman beauty.\r\n\r\nThe thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit? As sudden as the\r\nquestion came forth the response, \"I am.\" But, inquired my mind, for my\r\nlips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave? Again\r\nI read in his features the answer, \"For ages this earth existed as a\r\nnatural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;\r\ngradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that\r\nwhich transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the\r\nbutterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now\r\ngleams forth with the refulgence of the stars. I did not die, but passed\r\nas naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself. Prophets\r\nand apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind\r\ninfatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth. Your\r\nown mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the\r\nidea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and\r\ndismay--WHITHERWARD! WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\n\"The question is now solved. The revolution may not come in the year\r\nallotted you, but so surely as St. Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as\r\nscience elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,\r\nthe natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be\r\nchanged in the twinkling of an eye. Watch well! your own ears may hear\r\nthe clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the\r\ndark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my\r\nheart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum. When\r\nthe morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent\r\nand abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,\r\nbut thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the\r\nclouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its\r\nwings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when\r\nin terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_OUR WEDDING-DAY._\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I.\r\n\r\n    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,\r\n      Have bloomed, and passed away,\r\n    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,\r\n      We spent our wedding-day.\r\n    Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,\r\n      Joy chased each tear of woe,\r\n    When first we promised to be true,\r\n      That morning long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II.\r\n\r\n    Though many cares have come, dear Sue,\r\n      To checker life's career,\r\n    As down its pathway we have trod,\r\n      In trembling and in fear.\r\n    Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,\r\n      That lowered o'er the way,\r\n    We clung the closer, while it blew,\r\n      And laughed the clouds away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III.\r\n\r\n    'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,\r\n      And riches we have not,\r\n    But children gambol round our door,\r\n      And consecrate the spot.\r\n    Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,\r\n      Our daughters fair and gay,\r\n    But none so beautiful as you,\r\n      Upon our wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IV.\r\n\r\n    No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,\r\n      No crape festooned the door,\r\n    But health has waved its halcyon wings,\r\n      And plenty filled our store.\r\n    Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,\r\n      And chase dull cares away,\r\n    And kindle rosy hope anew,\r\n      As on our wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._\r\n\r\n\r\n    One more flutter of time's restless wing,\r\n    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;\r\n    One more step in the journey of fate,\r\n    One more ember gone out in life's grate;\r\n    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,\r\n    One more round in the ladder of age;\r\n    One leaf more in the volume of doom,\r\n    And one span less in the march to the tomb,\r\n    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,\r\n    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.\r\n\r\n        How has thy life been speeding\r\n          Since Aurora, at the dawn,\r\n        Peeped within thy portals, leading\r\n          The babe year, newly born?\r\n\r\n        Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,\r\n          Has some spectre nestled there?\r\n        And with every new to-morrow,\r\n          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?\r\n        Rise from thy grief, my brothers!\r\n          Burst its chain with strength sublime,\r\n        For behold!

The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged\r\nheavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose\r\nstate. No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder\r\nsleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician\r\nwith joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss\r\nLucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused\r\nme from slumber and oblivion.\r\n\r\nAbed at noonday! What did it betoken? I endeavored to recall something\r\nof the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared\r\nas fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever. Gradually, however, my\r\nshattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after\r\nmy awakening, I felt perfectly restored. No pain tormented me, and no\r\ntorpor benumbed my faculties. I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the\r\noccurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had\r\nhappened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my\r\nintended journey.\r\n\r\nAt this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I\r\nwas awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone. I\r\nsmiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all\r\napprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late\r\ncatastrophe. His delight knew no bounds. He seized my hand a thousand\r\ntimes, and pressed it again and again to his lips. At length,\r\nremembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he\r\nrushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nMy bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild\r\nwith joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and\r\nforehead. The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,\r\nand had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my\r\nchamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the\r\nnurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the\r\nreader's eye. As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything\r\naround me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.\r\n\r\nAnother morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when\r\nconsciousness again returned. The doctor was soon at my side, and\r\ninstead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at\r\nmy bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she\r\nmight select. He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual\r\nmanner, _Mormonism_, _St. Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most\r\nimplicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark\r\nin relation to either.\r\n\r\nMy sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what\r\ndelighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a\r\nmanuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its\r\nhistory. It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for\r\nmy brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day\r\ncame round, instead of \"hammering away,\" as he called it, on moral\r\nessays and metaphysical commonplaces. It was styled\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old\r\ntoper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great\r\nmany very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard\r\nof, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of\r\n\"Teutonic pluck\" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the\r\ndisplay of it. But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was\r\nhis strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_. He\r\nhad told me, in confidence, that \"many a time and oft\" he had rolled\r\nincessantly for weeks together. I think I heard him say that he once\r\nrolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to\r\neat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.\r\n\r\nI did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,\r\nthe fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might\r\naccidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically\r\nthat such a thing could not possibly be. And yet I have read of very\r\nlong fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great\r\nSahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader. But I must\r\nnot episodize, or I shall not reach my story.\r\n\r\nBlack Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the\r\nlittle town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he\r\nsaid so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat. His\r\ncompanions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and\r\ngazing around, he discovered that he was alone. The alley-keeper, too,\r\ncould nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the\r\npins had disappeared with the rest. It was growing very late, and Hal\r\nhad a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start\r\nhome. The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and\r\nthe heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever\r\nheard it before. The rain, too, now commenced to batter down\r\ntremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set\r\nout. Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable. If he\r\nhad but a boy to talk to! I'm afraid Hal began to grow scared. A verse\r\nthat he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into\r\nhis mind. It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire\r\nits company. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! for the might of dread Odin\r\n       The powers upon him shed,\r\n     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]\r\n       And a talk with Mimir's head!\"[B-236]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin. He could\r\nsail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and\r\ncarry it in his pocket.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin. When he\r\ndesired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired\r\nof Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]\r\n\r\nThis verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly. Gradually,\r\nhowever, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,\r\nuntil finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that\r\nit drowned the very thunder. He had repeated it just seventy-seven\r\ntimes, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and\r\ndemanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, \"What do _you_\r\nwant with Odin?\" \"Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,\"\r\npolitely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot. Here the head\r\nwas followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least\r\nforty feet high. Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in\r\nclose proximity to Black Hal. Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he\r\ncould, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, \"Now I lay me\r\ndown to sleep,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal\r\nsaid--that he would draw his knife on him. But be the cause what it\r\nmight, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,\r\n\"Stand up!\" As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said he, turning again to Hal, \"I'll bet you an ounce of\r\nyour blood I can beat you rolling.\"\r\n\r\nHal trembled again, but meekly replied, \"Please, sir, we don't bet\r\n_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blood's my money,\" roared forth the giant. \"Fee, fo, fum!\" Hal tried in\r\nvain to hoist the window.\r\n\r\n\"Will you bet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could\r\nspare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\n\"Roll first!\" said the giant.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest\r\nand his favorite ball.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing with Mimir's head?\" roared forth the monster.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, most humbly,\" began Hal, as he let the bloody head\r\nfall; \"I did not mean any harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rumble, bang-whang!\" bellowed the thunder.\r\n\r\nHal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, \"Now I lay me down,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Roll on! roll on! I say,\" and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar\r\nand set him on his feet.\r\n\r\nHe now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran\r\na few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what\r\nwas his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the\r\nball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley. Hal\r\nshuddered. The second and third ball met with no better success.\r\nOdin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head\r\nalong--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long\r\nbefore it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled\r\ndown, and lay sprawling on the alley.\r\n\r\n\"Two spares!\" said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.\r\n\"Get up!\" and up the pins all stood instantly. Taking another ball, he\r\nhurled it down the alley, and the same result followed. \"Two more\r\nspares!\" and Odin shook his gigantic sides with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"I give up the game,\" whined out Hal.\r\n\r\n\"Then you lose double,\" rejoined Odin.\r\n\r\nHal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at\r\nonce, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion. As he\r\nsaid so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made\r\nproportionably to his own size. He poised them upon a beam in the alley,\r\nand drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one\r\nscale. Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and\r\nwas quite as heavy.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!! Ha! ha! ha!!! Ha! ha! ha!!!!\" shouted the giant, as he\r\ngrasped the gasping and terrified gambler. He soon rolled up his\r\nsleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief. Next he drew\r\nforth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest\r\nvein he could discover. Hal screamed and fainted. When he returned to\r\nconsciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the\r\nsweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the\r\ngiant left him. On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum\r\nof blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he\r\ncould scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion. He returned\r\nimmediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,\r\nlike some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never\r\nintimated her doubts to Black Hal himself. The alley-keeper assured me\r\nin a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the\r\nadventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with\r\none of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.\r\nBut the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in\r\nstory telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect\r\nhe originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or\r\ndrunken braggadocio. One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat\r\nthe story in the presence of Black Hal himself.\r\n\r\n       #       #       #       #       #\r\n\r\nIn spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous\r\nhistory of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally\r\nwandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who\r\nI now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of\r\nmy destiny. Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and\r\nwhenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,\r\nlay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the\r\nperusal, unless I proved a better listener. I ask no man's pardon for\r\ndeclaring that my sister was an excellent reader. Most brothers, perhaps\r\nthink the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent\r\nand a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled. Owing\r\nto these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the\r\nstory, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when\r\nLucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, \"And pray where is Black Hal\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nMy thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded\r\nwhether or not the sample story had been imitated. A guilty blush\r\nassured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss\r\nLucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she\r\nhad whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly\r\nunfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious\r\ncondition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of\r\nsatisfying it.\r\n\r\n\"But you'll laugh at me,\" timidly whispered my sister.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I shall,\" said I, \"if your catastrophe is half as melancholy\r\nas Black Hal's. But make haste, or I shall be off to St. Louis. But pray\r\ninform me, what is the subject of your composition?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Origin of Marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, on my soul,\" responded I, laughing outright, \"you girls\r\nnever think about anything else.\"\r\n\r\nI provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus\r\nattempted to elucidate\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes\r\ninvoluntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring\r\naround me. There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being\r\nin the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment\r\nemerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the\r\nstar Zeta, one of the Pleiades. Now for a trip through infinite space!\r\nand as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of\r\nthe comet as it whizzed by me.\r\n\r\nI climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very\r\ncomfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit\r\nramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by\r\nthe song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and\r\nsystem to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to\r\nthose who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of\r\nhospitality. As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice\r\nlowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what\r\nevidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:\r\n\r\nThe flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above\r\nthe gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was\r\ngone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed\r\nthe delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that\r\nParadise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.\r\nWhere the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and\r\nsmouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself\r\nalong the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the\r\nfountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed the patriarch of men, \"where are now the pleasures which I\r\nonce enjoyed along these peaceful avenues? Where are all those\r\nbeautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me? Each\r\nguardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have\r\nflown. No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array\r\nhim in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,\r\nproduces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me. The very air, once all\r\nbalm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and\r\nthe fury of the hurricane. No more the notes of peace and happiness\r\ngreet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every\r\nside. Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and\r\nuniversal war has begun his reign!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his\r\ncompanion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam,\" exclaimed his companion. \"True,\r\nwe are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles\r\nof Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections. Let\r\nus learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn\r\nalso the mercy of redemption. We may yet be happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, talk not of happiness now,\" interrupted Adam; \"that nymph who once\r\nwailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled\r\nfrom the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not forever, Adam,\" kindly rejoined Eve; \"she may yet be lurking among\r\nthese groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us find her,\" quickly responded Adam; \"you follow the sun,\r\nsweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling\r\nwaters to their bourn. Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when\r\nwe have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her\r\nside, until the doom of death shall overtake us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on\r\nearth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and\r\nstarted eastward in his search.\r\n\r\nEve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.\r\n\r\nThe sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred\r\ntimes had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had\r\ntrod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed. Adam had in vain\r\ntraced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains. In\r\nvain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's\r\ncold in Siberia. He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea\r\nwhich separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the\r\nfar-off continent, exclaimed: \"In yon land, so deeply blue in the\r\ndistance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.\r\nAlas! I cannot pursue her there. I will return to Eden, and learn if\r\nEve, too, has been unsuccessful.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,\r\nand set out on his return.\r\n\r\nPoor Eve! First child of misery, first daughter of despair! Poor Eve,\r\nwith the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her\r\nlip! Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean\r\nsoon gleamed upon her sight. She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,\r\nand the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked\r\nfeet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar. A mermaid\r\nseemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every\r\nmotion. Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her\r\nsorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her.\r\n\r\n\"Sweet spirit,\" said Eve, \"canst thou inform me where the nymph\r\nHappiness lies concealed? She always stood beside us in the garden of\r\nEden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.\r\n\r\nAh! mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy\r\nlovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their\r\nbosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!\r\n\r\nNeither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;\r\nneither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the\r\nsought-for nymph. Eve explored them all. Her track was imprinted in the\r\nsands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in\r\nthe vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.\r\n\r\n\"O Happiness! art thou indeed departed from our earth? How can we live\r\nwithout thee? Come, Death,\" cried Eve; \"come now, and take me where thou\r\nwilt. This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate.\"\r\n\r\nA gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her\r\nsleep a vision came to comfort her. She dreamed that she stood before an\r\naged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had\r\nwhitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"Aged Father,\" said Eve, \"where is Happiness?\" and then she burst into a\r\nflood of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Comfort thyself, Daughter,\" mildly answered the old man; \"Happiness yet\r\ndwells on earth, but she is no longer visible. A temple is built for her\r\nin every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed\r\nthere by the child of Honor and Love.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the\r\nmemory of her dream. \"I will return to Eden, and there await until the\r\nchild of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph\r\nHappiness;\" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and\r\nthinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.\r\n\r\nThe sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in\r\nverdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the\r\nwarbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers\r\napproached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed\r\nthrough the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.\r\nA hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had\r\nresounded through the deserted groves. At length the dusky figures\r\nemerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into\r\neach other's faces. One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each\r\nother's arms.\r\n\r\nAdam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished\r\nhers. But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to\r\nhis bosom, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"There is no mystery here, my Eve. If Happiness on earth be indeed the\r\nchild of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone. What else now\r\nleft us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon? Approved by heaven,\r\nand cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;\r\nand if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!\"\r\n\r\nThey then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though\r\nthe garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an\r\nangel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every\r\nbosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of\r\nMatrimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_THE LAST OF HIS RACE._\r\n\r\n\r\n    No further can fate tempt or try me,\r\n      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;\r\n    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,\r\n      The last of my race I remain.\r\n    To that home so long left I might journey;\r\n      But they for whose greeting I yearn,\r\n    Are launched on that shadowy ocean\r\n      Whence voyagers never return.\r\n\r\n    My life is a blank in creation,\r\n      My fortunes no kindred may share;\r\n    No brother to cheer desolation,\r\n      No sister to soften by prayer;\r\n    No father to gladden my triumphs,\r\n      No mother my sins to atone;\r\n    No children to lean on in dying--\r\n      I must finish my journey alone!\r\n\r\n    In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,\r\n      How lone would now echo my tread!\r\n    While each fading portrait threw o'er me\r\n      The chill, stony smile of the dead.\r\n    One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,\r\n      From eve till the coming of dawn:\r\n    I cry out in visions, \"_Where are they_?\"\r\n      And echo responds, \"_They are gone_!\"\r\n\r\n    But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,\r\n      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,\r\n    That row of green hillocks, where moulder\r\n      The rest of my early doom'd race.\r\n    There slumber the true and the manly,\r\n      There slumber the spotless and fair;\r\n    And when my last journey is ended,\r\n      My place of repose be it there!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_THE TWO GEORGES._\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on\r\nopposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert\r\na commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to\r\ncontrol the fortunes of many succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nOne was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the\r\nother an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire. It will\r\nbe the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two\r\nindividuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and\r\nshow how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,\r\nwhilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with\r\nimmortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the\r\nguardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.\r\n\r\nGo with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of\r\nEngland. It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734. Some joyful event\r\nmust have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the\r\ninhabitants are dressed in holiday attire. Nor is the circumstance of a\r\nprivate nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is\r\nilluminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron\r\nthroats. The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously\r\ninto each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee. Tens of\r\nthousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on\r\na commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest\r\ntowers of St. James's Palace the national ensigns of St. George and the\r\nRed Cross are seen floating on the breeze. Within one of the most\r\ngorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of\r\nFrederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has\r\njust been delivered of a son. The scions of royalty crowd into the\r\nbed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny\r\nof a great empire is suspended. The corridors are thronged with dukes,\r\nand nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple\r\nknee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world. A\r\nRoyal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding\r\nBritish subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to\r\nrejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence\r\nGeorge William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended\r\nthe throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a\r\nscene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different\r\ncharacter. It is the 22d February, 1732. The locality is a distant\r\ncolony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored\r\nwilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with\r\nclay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards. Snow covers the\r\nground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning\r\nthrough the forest. Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the\r\nhouse, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality\r\nwithin, totally in contrast with external nature. There are but four\r\nsmall rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of\r\nAugustine Washington, has just given birth to a son. No dukes or\r\nmarquises or earls are there to attest the humble event. There are no\r\nprinces of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and\r\nfold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom. His first\r\nbreath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden\r\nwith perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the \"murmurs\r\nof low fountains.\" But the child is received from its Mother's womb by\r\nhands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,\r\nindicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.\r\nHe, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took\r\ncommand of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.\r\n\r\nBut if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were\r\nstill more unlike. From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only\r\nthe language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as\r\ncaprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in\r\nindolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle. The peasant\r\nboy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was\r\nhonorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health. He early\r\nlearned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a\r\nstone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of\r\nuntamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns. Truth,\r\ncourage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's\r\ncounsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's\r\nexample, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.\r\n\r\nEarly manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over\r\nextensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district\r\nsurveyor.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us\r\nnow proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public\r\nevent in the lives of either.\r\n\r\nFor a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all\r\nthe North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching\r\nin an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana. The English strenuously\r\ndenied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,\r\ncommenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg\r\nstands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them\r\nfrom the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary\r\nto dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and\r\ndemand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,\r\nand order him immediately to evacuate the territory.\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by\r\nthe Governor for this important mission.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery\r\nmarch through the wilderness. The historian of his life has painted in\r\nimperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in\r\nthe midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking. The\r\nmemory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,\r\naccompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through\r\nwintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more\r\nthan five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander. How\r\noften do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on\r\nhis return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that\r\nmajestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,\r\nto deprive Virginia of her young hero! And oh! with what fervent prayers\r\ndo we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate\r\nencounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of\r\nthe Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm. Standing\r\nbareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some\r\nfloating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was\r\nbroken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling\r\ncurrent. Save! oh, save him heaven! for the destinies of millions yet\r\nunborn hang upon that noble arm!\r\n\r\nLet us now recross the ocean. In the early part of the year 1764 a\r\nministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the\r\nBritish monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.\r\nThe troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to\r\nexcite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly\r\nirritated. A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that\r\nthe monarch is sick. His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,\r\nand even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger. Yet he has\r\nno fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step\r\nalong the corridors of the palace. His conduct becomes gradually more\r\nand more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal\r\nmedical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that\r\nthe King is threatened with _insanity_. For six weeks the cloud obscures\r\nhis mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the\r\nadministration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the\r\nfuture. His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,\r\npride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,\r\nand a radical cure impossible.\r\n\r\nPossessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and\r\nGeorge Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during\r\nthe struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nLet us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first\r\nindignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nNot long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the\r\nchief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the\r\nFrench; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on\r\naccount of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of\r\nlieutenant-colonel. Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he\r\nwas promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his\r\nown. Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in\r\nEurope, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,\r\nand his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,\r\n_under the command of favorite officers_. But this was not enough. An\r\nedict soon followed, denominated an \"Order to settle the rank of the\r\nofficers of His Majesty's forces serving in America.\" By one of the\r\narticles of this order, it was provided \"that all officers commissioned\r\nby the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade\r\ncommissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their\r\ncommissions might be of junior date;\" and it was further provided, that\r\n\"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy\r\nno rank at all.\" This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the\r\nink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication\r\ninforming him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.\r\nEntreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in\r\nvain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the\r\ndefenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly\r\nreplied: \"I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor.\"\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of\r\nGeorge the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp\r\nAct. This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent\r\nopposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual\r\nresistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia. The\r\nleading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barré, protested\r\nagainst the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city\r\nof London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the\r\nGranville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act. \"It is with the utmost\r\nastonishment,\" replied the King, \"that I find any of my subjects capable\r\nof encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some\r\nof my North American colonies. Having entire confidence in the wisdom of\r\nmy parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue\r\nthose measures which they have recommended for the support of the\r\nconstitutional rights of Great Britain.\" He heeded not the memorable\r\nwords of Burke, that afterward became prophetic. \"There are moments,\"\r\nexclaimed this great statesman, \"critical moments in the fortunes of all\r\nstates when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may\r\nyet be strong enough to complete your ruin.\" The Boston port bill\r\npassed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.\r\n\r\nIt is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that\r\nGeorge the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man\r\nin his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of\r\ncruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the\r\nsoul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable\r\njustice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince\r\nEngland that her revolted colonists were invincible.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution. Let us pass to\r\nthe social position of the two Georges in after-life.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at\r\nthe gate of St. James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named\r\nMargaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,\r\nendeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.\r\nThe weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of\r\nthe King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life. On the 29th\r\nOctober, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,\r\na ball passed through both windows of the carriage. On his return to St.\r\nJames the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck\r\nthe King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat. The state carriage was\r\ncompletely demolished by the mob. But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that\r\nGeorge the Third made his narrowest escapes. In the morning of that\r\nday, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one\r\nof the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the\r\nKing. The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a\r\ngentleman who was standing in the rear. In the evening of the same day a\r\nmore alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre. At the\r\nmoment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the\r\nright-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a\r\nlarge horse-pistol at him. The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown\r\nup by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nSuch were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.\r\nHe was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on\r\nthe 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic. In this dreadful\r\ncondition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the\r\nmost unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the\r\nEnglish throne. He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was\r\nhurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a\r\ndespot to the grave.\r\n\r\nHis whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,\r\nin few words: \"Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to\r\nbe his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in\r\nperilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.\r\nHis interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the\r\ncase of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous. _The\r\nseparation of America from the mother country, at the time it took\r\nplace, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference\r\nwith the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,\r\nattributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England. His\r\nobstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,\r\nkept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and\r\nthreatened the dismemberment of the kingdom. He has been often praised\r\nfor firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of\r\nobstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a\r\nresolution once formed.\"\r\n\r\nThe mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last\r\nresting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to\r\none of light.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the career of Washington. Throughout the\r\nRevolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of\r\nmillions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.\r\nHonored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from\r\nthraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and\r\nbest of the world's benefactors. Assassins did not unglory him in life,\r\nnor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death. The names of his\r\ngreat battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have\r\nimbedded themselves forever in the national character. Every pulsation\r\nof our hearts beats true to his memory. His mementoes are everywhere\r\naround and about us. Distant as we are from the green fields of his\r\nnative Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our\r\nborders. In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on\r\nshores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face\r\nof liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused\r\nperhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,\r\nthis day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the\r\ngleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of\r\nheaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles\r\nin his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the\r\nenslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!\r\n\r\nNor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice\r\nto his memory. Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in\r\ndischarging this debt of national gratitude. With a delicacy that none\r\nbut woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter\r\ncould feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of\r\npurchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel\r\nover his remains.

We should behold his ships\r\ntraversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of\r\nOphir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nSo, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be\r\ngiants, and their minds inspired.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles? We mean all that is\r\nglorious in the annals of Greece. We mean Apelles with his pencil,\r\nPhidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword. We seem to be\r\nstrolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the\r\ndivine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward\r\nthe theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is\r\npresenting his tragedies. Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition\r\nbefore us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious\r\nchariot. The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge\r\nin blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely\r\naround us. The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus\r\nand Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.\r\n\r\nRome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,\r\nstatesmen, and orators. Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the\r\ngreatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest\r\norator, and the greatest statesman of Rome. Cæsar and Cicero, Virgil and\r\nOctavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their\r\nblended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nItaly and Spain and France and England have had their golden age. The\r\neras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis\r\nQuatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten. They loom up from the\r\nsurrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;\r\nirradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,\r\nand dimming the lustre of the brightest stars. History has also left in\r\nits track mementoes of a different character. In sacred history we have\r\nthe age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero. We recognize at a glance\r\nthe talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the\r\nCrusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque\r\ntrack, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to\r\nthe reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout\r\nChristendom as the \"Dark Ages.\" Let us now take a survey of the field we\r\noccupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall\r\nbe ranked by our posterity.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let\r\nus define more especially what that epoch embraces.\r\n\r\nIt does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it\r\ninclude the acts or heroes of either. The impetus given to the human\r\nmind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully\r\ndistinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth. The\r\nfirst was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost\r\nuninterrupted peace. The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm\r\nbelong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds. Hence the wars of\r\nNapoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from\r\nobservation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.\r\n\r\nDe Staël and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,\r\nMetternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;\r\nCanova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning\r\nof this century, belong essentially to a former era. They were the\r\nripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first\r\ntook form on the 4th day of July, 1776. Our era properly commences with\r\nthe downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected\r\ntherewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in\r\nthe epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period. Ages\r\nhence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of\r\nthe nineteenth century:\r\n\r\n  \"The normal state of Christendom was peace. The age of steel that\r\n  immediately went before it had passed. It was the Iron age.\r\n\r\n  \"Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;\r\n  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility\r\n  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths\r\n  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly\r\n  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_. Everything was liable to\r\n  revision. The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against\r\n  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new\r\n  trial granted. The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg\r\n  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew\r\n  before the bar of public opinion. The head of Oliver Cromwell was\r\n  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the\r\n  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII\r\n  against the 'starry Galileo' reversed forever. Aristotle was\r\n  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In\r\n  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the\r\n  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and\r\n  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom. It was the age\r\n  of tests. Experiment governed the world. Germany led the van, and\r\n  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times.\"\r\n\r\nSuch unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present\r\ntime, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,\r\nshall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of\r\nbygone generations.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and\r\ntest its accuracy by exemplifications.\r\n\r\nI. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_? Locke has been\r\ncompletely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all\r\nspeculative moral philosophy exploded. The audiences of Edinburgh and\r\nBrown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr. Wayland in their\r\ndiscourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,\r\ninquisitively demand, \"_Cui bono_?\" What is the use of all this? How can\r\nwe apply it to the every-day concerns of life? We ask you for bread and\r\nyou have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is\r\nvalueless, except for its glitter. No philosopher can speculate\r\nsuccessfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every\r\nturn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who\r\nclips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an\r\noffer of copartnership to \"speculate,\" it may be, in the price of pork.\r\nHence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any\r\ntheory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment. Each school\r\nrises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in\r\ntoss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its\r\ncrest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever. As with its\r\npredecessor, so with itself.\r\n\r\n                       \"The eternal surge\r\n    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar\r\n    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,\r\n    Lashed from the foam of ages.\"\r\n\r\nII. But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_. It is\r\ntrue that more books are written and published, more newspapers and\r\nperiodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected\r\nand incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any\r\nformer period of the world's history. In looking about us we are\r\nforcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--\r\n\r\n    \"That those who cannot write, and those who can,\r\n     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man.\"\r\n\r\nHad a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,\r\nall the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his\r\neyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and\r\nhis years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual\r\nproduct of the press of Christendom at the present day. It is no figure\r\nof rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its\r\nlabors. Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak\r\nout, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to\r\nwhich they would solemnly respond: \"Spare us, good Lord!\"\r\n\r\nA recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating\r\nto the book trade in our own country: \"Books have multiplied to such an\r\nextent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000\r\nengines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and\r\nnight, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers. These\r\ntireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year. It\r\nrequires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus\r\n340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year. There\r\nare about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000\r\nbook-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum\r\nto the public.\"\r\n\r\nIt may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is\r\ndeclining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful\r\nextent. Byron wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;\r\n     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't.\"\r\n\r\nTrue enough; but books are not always literature. A man may become an\r\nauthor without ceasing to be an ignoramus. His name may adorn a\r\ntitle-page without being recorded _in ære perenne_. He may attempt to\r\nwrite himself up a very \"lion\" in literature, whilst good master Slender\r\nmay be busily engaged \"in writing him down an ass.\"\r\n\r\nNot one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand\r\nwreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up\r\ninto the region of the immortals. Tell me, ye who prate about the\r\n_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists? Whose\r\nare\r\n\r\n    \"The great, the immortal names\r\n     That were not born to die?\"\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold\r\nhundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals. They\r\njostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown\r\nand ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush\r\nonward and upward. One, it may be two, of the million who started out,\r\nstand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for\r\nadmittance. One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the\r\nother, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he\r\nenters, is transformed into imperishable stone.\r\n\r\nLet us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and\r\nselect, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen\r\nas it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall\r\ndrink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the\r\nvestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the\r\nsceptre?--who wears the crown? America, England, France and Germany can\r\nboast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single\r\npoet. The _poeta nascitur_ is not here. He may be on his way--and I have\r\nheard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives. Is\r\nhe in America? If so, which is he? Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with\r\nhis \"Raven,\" or Willis, cooing sweetly with his \"Dove\"? Is it Bryant,\r\nwith his \"Thanatopsis,\" or Prentice, with his \"Dirge to the Dead Year\"?\r\nPerhaps it is Holmes, with his \"Lyrics,\" or Longfellow, with his\r\n\"Idyls.\" Alas! is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is\r\nutterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nTrue, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,\r\nin abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the\r\neverlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.\r\n\r\nIn England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the\r\npet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and\r\nharmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into\r\nsublimity like the storm-swept sea.\r\n\r\nBéranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere\r\nsong-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and\r\nlyrist. Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor\r\nHugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.\r\n\r\nIn oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,\r\nBurke or Patrick Henry? I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor\r\nLamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.\r\nBut Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a\r\nmere debater, and the spokesman of a party. He was an eloquent speaker,\r\nbut can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnd in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of\r\nthat burly old bully, Dr. Sam Johnson? and yet Johnson, with all his\r\nlearning, was a third-rate philosopher.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist. Beyond all\r\ncontroversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of\r\nour times. With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an\r\nimagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;\r\nwith a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a\r\nstandard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a\r\nlearning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when\r\nan undergraduate, the \"Omniscient Macaulay;\" he still lacks the giant\r\ngrasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest\r\nenthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and\r\nidentify them with the eras they adorn.\r\n\r\nIII. As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the\r\n_Fine Arts_. The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,\r\nor composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.\r\nCanova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been\r\nsuperseded by negro minstrelsy and senseless pantomime. The greatest\r\narchitect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a\r\ncobbler of French farces.\r\n\r\nIV. But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has\r\nbeen left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next\r\nhighest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has\r\nbeen stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.\r\n\r\nOur age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact. Within its\r\nchosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have\r\npreceded it. It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors. It utilizes all that\r\nit touches. It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and\r\nestimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood. It\r\ndisentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the\r\nmanufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and\r\nplants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an\r\nagricultural experiment. It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no\r\nappreciation of the sublime. It stands upon the ocean shore, but with\r\nits eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold. It confronts\r\nNiagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an\r\necstasy of admiration, \"Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!\" Having no\r\nsoul to save, it has no religion to save it. It has discovered that\r\nMohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,\r\nafter all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,\r\nhis fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else. It does not\r\nbelieve in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible. It ridicules\r\nthe infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the\r\nchronology of the third. It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;\r\nit must \"touch and handle\" before it will believe. It questions the\r\nexistence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;\r\nit questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;\r\nit questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the\r\nevaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the\r\nheels of the lightnings. It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find\r\nout) through all its voices, moods and tenses. It invents everything;\r\nfrom a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through\r\nall the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope\r\nthat spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus\r\nin its inventions. It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for\r\na pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of\r\noil. From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a\r\ncolumbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it\r\noscillates like a pendulum.\r\n\r\nDeficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in\r\nscience. Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life. \"I\r\nwant to know,\" is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,\r\nthe crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it\r\nis upon the phiz of a regular \"Down-Easter.\" Our age has inherited the\r\nchief failing of our first mother, and passing by the \"Tree of Life in\r\nthe midst of the Garden,\" we are all busily engaged in mercilessly\r\nplundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit. The time is rapidly\r\napproaching when no man will be considered a gentleman who has not filed\r\nhis _caveat_ in the Patent Office.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins already to be\r\nseen. The philosophy of a cold, blank, calculating materialism has taken\r\npossession of all the avenues of learning. Epicurus is worshiped instead\r\nof Christ. Mammon is considered as the only true savior. _Dum Vivimus\r\nVivamus_, is the maxim we live by, and the creed we die by. We are all\r\niconoclasts. St. Paul has been superseded by St. Fulton; St John by St.\r\nColt; St. James by St. Morse; St. Mark by St. Manry; and St. Peter has\r\nsurrendered his keys to that great incarnate representative of this age,\r\nSt. Alexandre Von Humboldt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._\r\n\r\n\r\n    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,\r\n      The sword in its scabbard lay still,\r\n    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit\r\n      That crimson-dyed river and rill,\r\n    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,\r\n      To gladden the world with her smile,\r\n    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,\r\n      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.\r\n\r\n    As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,\r\n      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--\r\n    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece\r\n      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;\r\n    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod\r\n      In virginal beauty below;\r\n    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,\r\n      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.\r\n\r\n    Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,\r\n      Remembering the footprints of old\r\n    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,\r\n      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told.\r\n    \"I am naked,\" she cried; \"I am homeless on earth;\r\n      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,\r\n    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,\r\n      And condemned to the region of snows.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Hail, Liberty!

EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,\r\n  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to\r\n  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic\r\n  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even\r\n  in California. Before proceeding to relate in detail the late\r\n  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of\r\n  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most\r\n  profound and contradictory character. I, for one, halted between\r\n  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent\r\n  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable\r\n  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific\r\n  authenticity of the facts related.\r\n\r\n  The doubt with which the story was at first received in this\r\n  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an\r\n  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has\r\n  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that\r\n  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate. Too\r\n  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the\r\n  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the\r\n  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.\r\n\r\n  [Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has\r\n  been issued.--P. J.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\n                        =$10,000 REWARD!=\r\n\r\n                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\n    By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the\r\n    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the\r\n    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,\r\n    familiarly known as Black Bart. Said Graham is accused of the\r\n    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on\r\n    the 14th ultimo. He is five feet ten inches and a half in\r\n    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,\r\n    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in\r\n    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the\r\n    Confederate army. He may be lurking in some of the\r\n    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster\r\n    during the Comstock excitement. The above reward will be paid\r\n    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an\r\n    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory\r\n    Summerfield.\r\n\r\n    By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,\r\n                                            Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n    Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur correspondent continues:\r\n\r\n  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in\r\n  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but\r\n  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of\r\n  the editor above alluded to. But I am detaining you from more\r\n  important matters. Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4\r\n  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the\r\n  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on\r\n  the same errand, but without any previous conference. Two of these\r\n  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,\r\n  or, as he was usually called, \"Black Bart.\" Gillson kept a saloon\r\n  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and\r\n  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the\r\n  Norfolk livery stable. Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor\r\n  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his\r\n  untimely end. As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his\r\n  antecedents. It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of\r\n  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an\r\n  habitual gambler. Only one thing about him is certainly well\r\n  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served\r\n  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell. He was a man\r\n  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;\r\n  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and\r\n  left him but a wreck of himself. But he was not incapable of\r\n  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of\r\n  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies\r\n  from the flames. In so doing he scorched his left hand so\r\n  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very\r\n  scar may lead to his apprehension. There is no doubt about his\r\n  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will\r\n  probably be not alive.\r\n\r\n  So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.\r\n\r\n  Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses\r\n  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of\r\n  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.\r\n\r\n    STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.\r\n      County of Placer.  }\r\n\r\n    Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My\r\n    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife\r\n    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North\r\n    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's\r\n    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin\r\n    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at\r\n    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from\r\n    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain\r\n    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone\r\n    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for\r\n    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one\r\n    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning\r\n    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place\r\n    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered\r\n    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),\r\n    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so\r\n    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan\r\n    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his\r\n    eyes, and begged me, \"For God's sake, give me a drop of\r\n    water!\" I asked him, \"What is the matter?\" He replied, \"I am\r\n    shot in the back.\" \"Dangerously?\" I demanded. \"Fatally!\" he\r\n    faltered. Without waiting to question him further, I returned\r\n    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and\r\n    sent her off on a run for the men. Taking with me a gourd of\r\n    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman\r\n    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back\r\n    to his side, where I remained until \"father\"--as we all call\r\n    my husband--came with the men. We removed him as gently as we\r\n    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr. Liebner, and nursed him\r\n    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.\r\n\r\n    Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken\r\n    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A. I did.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you see him sign it?--A. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A. It is, sir.\r\n\r\n                 (Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n    Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name\r\n    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams\r\n    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my\r\n    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last\r\n    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a\r\n    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must\r\n    go for father and the boys immediately. I ran as fast as my\r\n    legs would carry me to where they were \"cleaning up,\" for they\r\n    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we\r\n    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the\r\n    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously\r\n    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday\r\n    sundown, when he died.\r\n\r\n    Question. Did he speak after he reached the cabin? A. He did\r\n    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more\r\n    audibly and intelligibly.\r\n\r\n    Q. What did he say? A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the\r\n    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;\r\n    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of\r\n    all sent for the doctor.\r\n\r\n    Q. Who was present when he died? A. Only myself; he had\r\n    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to\r\n    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and\r\n    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself\r\n    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered\r\n    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, \"Run! run! run!\r\n    He has it! Black Bart has got the vial! Quick! or he'll set\r\n    the world afire! See, he opens it! Oh, my God! Look! look!\r\n    look! Hold his hands! tie him! chain him down! Too late! too\r\n    late! oh the flames! Fire! fire! fire!\" His tone of voice\r\n    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he\r\n    cried \"fire!\" his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his\r\n    body convulsed, and before Mrs. Gillson could reach his\r\n    bedside he fell back stone dead.\r\n\r\n                 (Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of\r\n  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of\r\n  his demoniac ravings. He would taste nothing from a glass or\r\n  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his\r\n  eyes. In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,\r\n  tumblers, and even the castors. At times he spoke rationally, but\r\n  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.\r\n\r\n  The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the\r\n  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his\r\n  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and\r\n    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the\r\n    most part flighty and in a comatose condition. The wound was\r\n    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball\r\n    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces. It\r\n    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,\r\n    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the\r\n    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the\r\n    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,\r\n    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the\r\n    xiphoid portion of the sternum. Necessarily fatal, there was\r\n    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a\r\n    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect\r\n    of the wound he ultimately died. I witnessed the execution of\r\n    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his\r\n    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his\r\n    perfect senses. It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,\r\n    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read\r\n    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature. I was\r\n    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away\r\n    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his\r\n    bedside shortly afterward. In my judgment, no amount of care\r\n    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a\r\n    few days.\r\n\r\n                 (Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }\r\n                  _vs._               }\r\n            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }\r\n\r\n    _Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken\r\n    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._\r\n\r\n    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left\r\n    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory\r\n    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the\r\n    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,\r\n    since deceased. It was not fully light when I reached the\r\n    track of the Central Pacific Railroad. Having mined at an\r\n    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky\r\n    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the\r\n    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice. One was\r\n    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the\r\n    cañon below. I chose the latter, as being the freest from the\r\n    chance of observation. It required the greatest caution to\r\n    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky\r\n    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the\r\n    railroad. It was now broad daylight, and I commenced\r\n    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body. There is quite a\r\n    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the\r\n    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision\r\n    even at a short distance. Brushing aside a thick manzanita\r\n    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that\r\n    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot. It\r\n    was Bartholomew Graham, known as \"Black Bart.\" We suddenly\r\n    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying\r\n    exactly between us. Our recognition was mutual. Graham\r\n    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we\r\n    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.\r\n\r\n    Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse\r\n    whisper, \"Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that\r\n    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly\r\n    as I bid you, as long as you live!\"\r\n\r\n    I looked him full in the eye. Fate sat there, cold and\r\n    remorseless as stone. I hesitated; with his left hand he\r\n    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the\r\n    handle of a navy revolver.\r\n\r\n    \"Swear!\" again he cried.\r\n\r\n    As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his\r\n    brow darkened into a scowl. \"As your confederate,\" I answered,\r\n    \"never as your slave.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Be it so!\" was his only reply.\r\n\r\n    The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards. The\r\n    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of\r\n    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty. Snow and ice\r\n    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed\r\n    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the\r\n    entrails. But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to\r\n    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of\r\n    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory\r\n    Summerfield. A glance told us all these things. But they did\r\n    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost\r\n    froze my blood. In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,\r\n    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed\r\n    vial which was the object of our mutual visit. Graham fell\r\n    upon his knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the\r\n    grasp of its dead possessor. But the bones were firm, and when\r\n    he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden\r\n    wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems.\r\n\r\n    \"Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets,\" he\r\n    commanded.\r\n\r\n    I did as directed.\r\n\r\n    He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand into\r\n    the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS., matted\r\n    closely together and stained by the winter's rains. A further\r\n    search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold coin, a set\r\n    of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk, and a pair of\r\n    silver-mounted spectacles. Hastily covering over the body with\r\n    leaves and branches cut from the embowering shrubs, we\r\n    shudderingly left the spot.\r\n\r\n    We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the American\r\n    River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered thicket,\r\n    where we threw ourselves upon the ground. Neither had spoken a\r\n    word since we left the scene above described. Graham was the\r\n    first to break the silence which to me had become oppressive.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are safe.\"\r\n\r\n    I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n    \"Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure,\" he added. Saying\r\n    this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief and\r\n    placed it in his bosom.\r\n\r\n    \"What shall we do with our prize?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n    \"_Our_ prize?\" As he said this he laughed derisively, and cut\r\n    a most scornful and threatening glance toward me.\r\n\r\n    \"Yes,\" I rejoined firmly; \"_our_ prize!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Gillson,\" retorted Graham, \"you must regard me as a\r\n    consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah. This bottle is\r\n    mine, and _mine_ only. It is a great fortune for _one_, but of\r\n    less value than a toadstool for _two_. I am willing to divide\r\n    fairly. This secret would be of no service to a coward. He\r\n    would not dare to use it. Your share of the robbery of the\r\n    body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them to some poor devil\r\n    of a printer, and pay yourself for your day's work.\"\r\n\r\n    Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS. at my feet; but I\r\n    disdained to touch them. Observing this, he gathered them up\r\n    safely and replaced them in his pocket. \"As you are unarmed,\"\r\n    he said, \"it would not be safe for you to be seen in this\r\n    neighborhood during daylight. We will both spend the night\r\n    here, and just before morning return to Auburn. I will\r\n    accompany you part of the distance.\"\r\n\r\n    With the _sangfroid_ of a perfect desperado, he then stretched\r\n    himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank deeply from a\r\n    whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling his hat over his\r\n    eyes, was soon asleep and snoring. It was a long time before I\r\n    could believe the evidence of my own senses. Finally, I\r\n    approached the ruffian, and placed my hand on his shoulder. He\r\n    did not stir a muscle. I listened; I heard only the deep, slow\r\n    breathing of profound slumber. Resolved not to be balked and\r\n    defrauded by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial\r\n    from his pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear\r\n    the click of a revolver behind me. I was betrayed! I remember\r\n    only a dash and an explosion--a deathly sensation, a whirl of\r\n    the rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the\r\n    lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth. When I\r\n    awoke to consciousness it was past midnight. I looked up at\r\n    the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face. That\r\n    constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season of the\r\n    year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me that\r\n    many weary hours would intervene before daylight. My right arm\r\n    was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it rested in a\r\n    pool of my own blood. \"Oh, for one drop of water!\" I\r\n    exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the night\r\n    blast responded. Again I fainted. Shortly after daylight I\r\n    revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered on the\r\n    next day by the kind mistress of this cabin. You know the\r\n    rest. I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my assassination. I do\r\n    this in the perfect possession of my senses, and with a full\r\n    sense of my responsibility to Almighty God.\r\n\r\n                 (Signed)                        C. P.

EDITOR: On entering my office this morning I found A bundle\r\n  of MSS. which had been thrown in at the transom over the door,\r\n  labeled, \"The Summerfield MSS.\" Attached to them was an unsealed\r\n  note from one Bartholomew Graham, in these words:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: These are yours: you have earned them.

The mortals stood,\r\n    Watchful and solemn, in speechless sorrow bound.\r\n    He was erect, defiant, and unblenched.\r\n    Tho' fallen, free--deceived, but not undone.\r\n    She leaned on him, and drooped her pensive brow\r\n    In token of the character she bore--\r\n    _The world's first penitent_. Tears, gushing fast,\r\n    Streamed from her azure eyes; and as they fled\r\n    Beyond the eastern gate, where gleamed the swords\r\n    Of guarding Cherubim, the flowers themselves\r\n    Bent their sad heads, surcharged with dewy tears,\r\n    Wept by the stare o'er man's immortal woe.\r\n\r\n    Far had they wandered, slow had been the pace,\r\n    Grief at his heart and ruin on her face,\r\n    Ere Adam turned to contemplate the spot\r\n    Where Earth began, where Heaven was forgot.\r\n    He gazed in silence, till the crystal wall\r\n    Of Eden trembled, as though doomed to fall:\r\n    Then bidding Eve direct her tear-dimmed eye\r\n    To where the foliage kissed the western sky,\r\n    They saw, with horror mingled with surprise,\r\n    The wall, the garden, and the foliage rise!\r\n    Slowly it mounted to the vaulted dome,\r\n    And paused as if to beckon mortals home;\r\n    Then, like a cloud when winds are all at rest,\r\n    It floated gently to the distant west,\r\n    And left behind a crimson path of light,\r\n    By which to track the Garden in its flight!\r\n\r\n    Day after day, the exiles wandered on,\r\n    With eyes still fixed, where Eden's smile last shone;\r\n    Forlorn and friendless through the wilds they trod,\r\n    Remembering Eden, but forgetting God,\r\n    Till far across the sea-washed, arid plain,\r\n    The billows thundered that the search was vain!\r\n\r\n    Ah! who can tell how oft at eventide,\r\n    When the gay west was blushing like a bride,\r\n    Fair Eve hath whispered in her children's ear,\r\n    \"Beyond yon cloud will Eden reappear!\"\r\n\r\n    And thus, as slow millenniums rolled away,\r\n    Each generation, ere it turned to clay,\r\n    Has with prophetic lore, by nature blest,\r\n    In search of Eden wandered to the West.\r\n\r\n    I cast my thoughts far up the stream of time,\r\n    And catch its murmurs in my careless rhyme.\r\n    I hear a footstep tripping o'er the down:\r\n    Behold! 'tis Athens, in her violet crown.\r\n    In fancy now her splendors reappear;\r\n    Her fleets and phalanxes, her shield and spear;\r\n    Her battle-fields, blest ever by the free,--\r\n    Proud Marathon, and sad Thermopylæ!\r\n    Her poet, foremost in the ranks of fame,\r\n    Homer! a god--but with a mortal's name;\r\n    Historians, richest in primeval lore;\r\n    Orations, sounding yet from shore to shore!\r\n    Heroes and statesmen throng the enraptured gaze,\r\n    Till glory totters 'neath her load of praise.\r\n    Surely a clime so rich in old renown\r\n    Could build an Eden, if not woo one down!\r\n\r\n    Lo! Plato comes, with wisdom's scroll unfurl'd,\r\n    The proudest gift of Athens to the world!\r\n    Wisest of mortals, say, for thou can'st tell,\r\n    Thou, whose sweet lips the Muses loved so well,\r\n    Was Greece the Garden that our fathers trod;\r\n    When men, like angels, walked the earth with God?\r\n    \"Alas!\" the great Philosopher replied,\r\n    \"Though I love Athens better than a bride,\r\n    Her laws are bloody and her children slaves;\r\n    Her sages slumber in empoisoned graves;\r\n    Her soil is sterile, barren are her seas;\r\n    Eden still blooms in the Hesperides,\r\n    Beyond the pillars of far Hercules!\r\n    Westward, amid the ocean's blandest smile,\r\n    Atlantis blossoms, a perennial Isle;\r\n    A vast Republic stretching far and wide,\r\n    Greater than Greece and Macedon beside!\"\r\n\r\n    The vision fades. Across the mental screen\r\n    A mightier spirit stalks upon the scene;\r\n    His tread shakes empires ancient as the sun;\r\n    His voice resounds, and nations are undone;\r\n    War in his tone and battle in his eye,\r\n    The world in arms, a Roman dare defy!\r\n    Throned on the summit of the seven hills,\r\n    He bathes his gory heel in Tiber's rills;\r\n    Stretches his arms across a triple zone,\r\n    And dares be master of mankind, alone!\r\n    All peoples send their tribute to his store;\r\n    Wherever rivers glide or surges roar,\r\n    Or mountains rise or desert plains expand,\r\n    His minions sack and pillage every land.\r\n    But not alone for rapine and for war\r\n    The Roman eagle spreads his pinions far;\r\n    He bears a sceptre in his talons strong,\r\n    To guard the right, to rectify the wrong,\r\n    And carries high, in his imperial beak,\r\n    A shield armored to protect the weak.\r\n\r\n    Justice and law are dropping from his wing,\r\n    Equal alike for consul, serf or king;\r\n    Daggers for tyrants, for patriot-heroes fame,\r\n    Attend like menials on the Roman name!\r\n\r\n    Was Rome the Eden of our ancient state,\r\n    Just in her laws, in her dominion great,\r\n    Wise in her counsels, matchless in her worth,\r\n    Acknowledged great proconsul of the earth?\r\n\r\n    An eye prophetic that has read the leaves\r\n    The sibyls scattered from their loosened sheaves,\r\n    A bard that sang at Rome in all her pride,\r\n    Shall give response;--let Seneca decide!\r\n\r\n    \"Beyond the rocks where Shetland's breakers roar,\r\n    And clothe in foam the wailing, ice-bound shore,\r\n    Within the bosom of a tranquil sea,\r\n    Where Earth has reared her _Ultima Thule_,\r\n    The gorgeous West conceals a golden clime,\r\n    The petted child, the paragon of Time!\r\n    In distant years, when Ocean's mountain wave\r\n    Shall rock a cradle, not upheave a grave,\r\n    When men shall walk the pathway of the brine,\r\n    With feet as safe as Terra watches mine,\r\n    Then shall the barriers of the Western Sea\r\n    Despised and broken down forever be;\r\n    Then man shall spurn old Ocean's loftiest crest,\r\n    And tear the secret from his stormy breast!\"\r\n\r\n    Again the vision fades. Night settles down\r\n    And shrouds the world in black Plutonian frown;\r\n    Earth staggers on, like mourners to a tomb,\r\n    Wrapt in one long millennium of gloom.\r\n    That past, the light breaks through the clouds of war,\r\n    And drives the mists of Bigotry afar;\r\n    Amalfi sees her burial tomes unfurl'd,\r\n    And dead Justinian rules again the world.\r\n    The torch of Science is illumed once more;\r\n    Adventure gazes from the surf-beat shore,\r\n    Lifts in his arms the wave-worn Genoese,\r\n    And hails Iberia, Mistress of the Seas!\r\n\r\n    What cry resounds along the Western main,\r\n    Mounts to the stars, is echoed back again,\r\n    And wakes the voices of the startled sea,\r\n    Dumb until now, from past eternity?\r\n\r\n    \"Land! land!\" is chanted from the Pinta's deck;\r\n    Smiling afar, a minute glory-speck,\r\n    But grandly rising from the convex sea,\r\n    To crown Colon with immortality,\r\n    The Western World emerges from the wave,\r\n    God's last asylum for the free and brave!\r\n\r\n    But where within this ocean-bounded clime,\r\n    This fairest offspring of the womb of time,--\r\n    Plato's Atlantis, risen from the sea,\r\n    Utopia's realm, beyond old Rome's Thule,--\r\n    Where shall we find, within this giant land,\r\n    By blood redeemed, with Freedom's rainbow spann'd,\r\n    The spot first trod by mortals on the earth,\r\n    Where Adam's race was cradled into birth?\r\n\r\n    'Twas sought by Cortez with his warrior band,\r\n    In realms once ruled by Montezuma's hand;\r\n    Where the old Aztec, 'neath his hills of snow,\r\n    Built the bright domes of silver Mexico.\r\n    Pizarro sought it where the Inca's rod\r\n    Proclaimed the prince half-mortal, demi-god,\r\n    When the mild children of unblest Peru\r\n    Before the bloodhounds of the conqueror flew,\r\n    And saw their country and their race undone,\r\n    And perish 'neath the Temple of the Sun!\r\n    De Soto sought it, with his tawny bride,\r\n    Near where the Mississippi's waters glide,\r\n    Beneath the ripples of whose yellow wave\r\n    He found at last both monument and grave.\r\n    Old Ponce de Leon, in the land of flowers,\r\n    Searched long for Eden 'midst her groves and bowers,\r\n    Whilst brave La Salle, where Texan prairies smile,\r\n    Roamed westward still, to reach the happy isle.\r\n    The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower's deck,\r\n    Fleeing beyond a tyrant's haughty beck,\r\n    In quest of Eden, trod the rock-bound shore,\r\n    Where bleak New England's wintry surges roar;\r\n    Raleigh, with glory in his eagle eye,\r\n    Chased the lost realm beneath a Southern sky;\r\n    Whilst Boone believed that Paradise was found\r\n    In old Kentucky's \"dark and bloody ground!\"\r\n\r\n    In vain their labors, all in vain their toil;\r\n    Doomed ne'er to breathe that air nor tread that soil.\r\n    Heaven had reserved it till a race sublime\r\n    Should launch its heroes on the wave of time!\r\n\r\n    Go with me now, ye Californian band,\r\n    And gaze with wonder at your glorious land;\r\n    Ascend the summit of yon middle chain,\r\n    When Mount Diablo rises from the plain,\r\n    And cast your eyes with telescopic power,\r\n    O'er hill and forest, over field and flower.\r\n    Behold! how free the hand of God hath roll'd\r\n    A wave of wealth across your Land of Gold!\r\n    The mountains ooze it from their swelling breast,\r\n    The milk-white quartz displays it in her crest;\r\n    Each tiny brook that warbles to the sea,\r\n    Harps on its strings a golden melody;\r\n    Whilst the young waves are cradled on the shore\r\n    On spangling pillows, stuffed with golden ore!\r\n\r\n    Look northward!

On the plains of San Joaquin\r\n    Ten thousand herds in dense array are seen.\r\n    Aloft like columns propping up the skies\r\n    The cloud-kissed groves of Calaveras rise;\r\n    Whilst dashing downward from their dizzy home\r\n    The thundering falls of Yo Semite foam!\r\n    Look westward!
