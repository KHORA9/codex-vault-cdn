Alas, a few years ago, I\r\nshould have said “my universe”: but now my mind has been opened to higher\r\nviews of things.\r\n\r\nIn such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that\r\nthere should be anything of what you call a “solid” kind; but I dare say\r\nyou will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the\r\nTriangles, Squares and other figures moving about as I have described\r\nthem. On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so\r\nas to distinguish one figure from another. Nothing was visible, nor could\r\nbe visible, to us, except straight Lines; and the necessity of this I\r\nwill speedily demonstrate.\r\n\r\nPlace a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning\r\nover it, look down upon it. It will appear a circle.\r\n\r\nBut now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your eye\r\n(thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the\r\ninhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and\r\nmore oval to your view; and at last when you have placed your eye exactly\r\non the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a\r\nFlatland citizen) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,\r\nand will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a\r\nTriangle, or Square, or any other figure cut out of pasteboard. As soon\r\nas you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will find\r\nthat it ceases to appear to you a figure, and that it becomes in\r\nappearance a straight line. Take for example an equilateral Triangle—who\r\nrepresents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class. Fig. 1\r\nrepresents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending over\r\nhim from above; figs. 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see\r\nhim if your eye were close to the level, or all but on the level of the\r\ntable; and if your eye were quite on the level of the table (and that is\r\nhow we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing but a straight line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar\r\nexperiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant island\r\nor coast lying on the horizon. The far-off land may have bays, forelands,\r\nangles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a distance you see\r\nnone of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them revealing\r\nthe projections and retirements by means of light and shade), nothing but\r\na grey unbroken line upon the water.\r\n\r\nWell, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other\r\nacquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As there is neither sun with\r\nus, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none of the\r\nhelps to the sight that you have in Spaceland. If our friend comes close\r\nto us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes smaller:\r\nbut still he looks like a straight line; be he a Triangle, Square,\r\nPentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will—a straight Line he looks and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances we are\r\nable to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to this\r\nvery natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I come to\r\ndescribe the inhabitants of Flatland. For the present let me defer this\r\nsubject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             § 2.—_Of the climate and houses in Flatland._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass North,\r\nSouth, East, and West.\r\n\r\nThere being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us to\r\ndetermine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our own. By\r\na Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the South;\r\nand, although in temperate climates this is very slight—so that even a\r\nWoman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs northward without\r\nmuch difficulty—yet the hampering effect of the southward attraction is\r\nquite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts of our earth.\r\nMoreover the rain (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from\r\nthe North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have the\r\nguidance of the houses, which of course have their side-walls running for\r\nthe most part North and South, so that the roofs may keep off the rain\r\nfrom the North. In the country, where there are no houses, the trunks of\r\nthe trees serve as some sort of guide. Altogether, we have not so much\r\ndifficulty as might be expected in determining our bearings.\r\n\r\nYet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is\r\nhardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where there\r\nhave been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been occasionally\r\ncompelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting till the rain\r\ncame before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged, and especially\r\non delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much more heavily than\r\non the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point of breeding, if you\r\nmeet a Lady in the street, always to give her the North side of the\r\nway—by no means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you are\r\nin rude health and in a climate where it is difficult to tell your North\r\nfrom your South.\r\n\r\nWindows there are none in our houses: for the light comes to us alike in\r\nour homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times and\r\nin all places, whence we know not. It was in old days, with our learned\r\nmen, an interesting and oft-investigated question, What is the origin of\r\nlight; and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted, with no\r\nother result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the would-be solvers.\r\nHence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such investigations\r\nindirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in\r\ncomparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them. I, alas I alone\r\nin Flatland—know now only too well the true solution of this mysterious\r\nproblem; but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible to a single one of\r\nmy countrymen; and I am mocked at—I, the sole possessor of the truths of\r\nSpace and of the theory of the introduction of Light from the world of\r\nThree Dimensions—as if I were the maddest of the mad! But a truce to\r\nthese painful digressions: let me return to our houses.\r\n\r\nThe most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or\r\npentagonal, as in the annexed figure. The two Northern sides _RO_, _OF_,\r\nconstitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East is\r\na small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the Men;\r\nthe South side or floor is usually doorless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nSquare and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The\r\nangles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle)\r\nbeing much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of\r\ninanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and\r\nWomen, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a\r\nsquare or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an\r\ninconsiderate or perhaps absent-minded traveller suddenly running against\r\nthem: and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our era,\r\ntriangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions\r\nbeing fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other state\r\nbuildings, which it is not desirable that the general public should\r\napproach without circumspection.\r\n\r\nAt this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though\r\ndiscouraged by a special tax. But, about three centuries afterwards, the\r\nLaw decided that in all towns containing a population above ten thousand,\r\nthe angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that could be\r\nallowed consistently with the public safety. The good sense of the\r\ncommunity has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now, even in\r\nthe country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every other. It\r\nis only now and then in some very remote and backward agricultural\r\ndistrict that an antiquarian may still discover a square house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             § 3.—_Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest length or breadth of a full-grown inhabitant of Flatland may\r\nbe estimated at about eleven of your inches. Twelve inches may be\r\nregarded as a maximum.\r\n\r\nOur Women are Straight Lines.\r\n\r\nOur Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two equal\r\nsides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short\r\n(often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a\r\nvery sharp and formidable angle. Indeed when their bases are of the most\r\ndegraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size), they\r\ncan hardly be distinguished from Straight Lines or Women; so extremely\r\npointed are their vertices. With us, as with you, these Triangles are\r\ndistinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and by this name I\r\nshall refer to them in the following pages.\r\n\r\nOur Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-sided Triangles.\r\n\r\nOur Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself\r\nbelong) and Five-sided figures or Pentagons.\r\n\r\nNext above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,\r\nbeginning at Six-sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in\r\nthe number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of\r\nPolygonal, or many-sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes so\r\nnumerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot be\r\ndistinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or Priestly\r\norder; and this is the highest class of all.\r\n\r\nIt is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more side\r\nthan his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step\r\nin the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a\r\nPentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.\r\n\r\nBut this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen, and still less often\r\nto the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to\r\ndeserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides\r\nequal. With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the son\r\nof an Isosceles (_i.e._ a Triangle with two sides equal) remains\r\nIsosceles still. Nevertheless, all hope is not shut out, even from the\r\nIsosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded\r\ncondition. For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent\r\nand skilful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent\r\namong the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of their\r\nthird side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.\r\nIntermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters\r\nof these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally result\r\nin an offspring approximating still more to the type of the Equal-sided\r\nTriangle.\r\n\r\nRarely—in proportion to the vast number of Isosceles births—is a genuine\r\nand certifiable Equal-sided Triangle produced from Isosceles parents.[1]\r\nSuch a birth requires, as its antecedents, not only a series of carefully\r\narranged intermarriages, but also a long-continued exercise of frugality\r\nand self-control on the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming\r\nEquilateral, and a patient, systematic, and continuous development of the\r\nIsosceles intellect through many generations.\r\n\r\nThe birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the\r\nsubject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round. After a\r\nstrict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the\r\ninfant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted into\r\nthe class of Equilaterals. He is then immediately taken from his proud\r\nyet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral, who is\r\nbound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his former\r\nhome or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear lest the\r\nfreshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious imitation, fall\r\nback again into his hereditary level.\r\n\r\nThe occasional emergence of an Isosceles from the ranks of his serf-born\r\nancestors, is welcomed not only by the poor serfs themselves, as a gleam\r\nof light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their existence,\r\nbut also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher classes are well\r\naware that these rare phenomena, while they do little or nothing to\r\nvulgarise their own privileges, serve as a most useful barrier against\r\nrevolution from below.\r\n\r\nHad the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely\r\ndestitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in some\r\nof their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their superior\r\nnumbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the Circles. But a\r\nwise ordinance of Nature has decreed that, in proportion as the\r\nworking-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all virtue, in\r\nthat same proportion their acute angle (which makes them physically\r\nterrible) shall increase also and approximate to the harmless angle of\r\nthe Equilateral Triangle. Thus, in the most brutal and formidable of the\r\nsoldier class creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of\r\nintelligence—it is found that, as they wax in the mental ability\r\nnecessary to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage, so\r\ndo they wane in the power of penetration itself.\r\n\r\nHow admirable is this Law of Compensation! And how perfect a proof of the\r\nnatural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the\r\naristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland! By a judicious use\r\nof this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to\r\nstifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible\r\nand boundless hopefulness of the human mind. Art also comes to the aid of\r\nLaw and Order. It is generally found possible—by a little artificial\r\ncompression or expansion on the part of the State physicians—to make some\r\nof the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion perfectly Regular, and to\r\nadmit them at once into the privileged classes; a much larger number, who\r\nare still below the standard, allured by the prospect of being ultimately\r\nennobled, are induced to enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept\r\nin honourable confinement for life; one or two alone of the more\r\nobstinate, foolish, and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.\r\n\r\nThen the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are\r\neither transfixed without resistance by the small body of their brethren\r\nwhom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this kind; or else\r\nmore often, by means of jealousies and suspicions skilfully fomented\r\namong them by the Circular party, they are stirred to mutual warfare, and\r\nperish by one another’s angles. No less than one hundred and twenty\r\nrebellions are recorded in our annals, besides minor outbreaks numbered\r\nat two hundred and thirty-five; and they have all ended thus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      § 4.—_Concerning the Women._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it\r\nmay be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women. For, if a\r\nSoldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, _all_ point,\r\nat least at the two extremities. Add to this the power of making herself\r\npractically invisible at will, and you will perceive that a Female, in\r\nFlatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nBut here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask _how_ a woman in\r\nFlatland can make herself invisible. This ought, I think, to be apparent\r\nwithout any explanation. However, a few words will make it clear to the\r\nmost unreflecting.\r\n\r\nPlace a needle on a table. Then, with your eye on the level of the table,\r\nlook at it side-ways, and you see the whole length of it; but look at it\r\nend-ways, and you see nothing but a point: it has become practically\r\ninvisible. Just so is it with one of our Women. When her side is turned\r\ntowards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end containing her\r\neye or mouth—for with us these two organs are identical—is the part that\r\nmeets our eye, then we see nothing but a highly lustrous point; but when\r\nthe back is presented to our view, then—being only sub-lustrous, and,\r\nindeed, almost as dim as an inanimate object—her hinder extremity serves\r\nher as a kind of Invisible Cap.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must now be manifest\r\nto the meanest capacity in Spaceland. If even the angle of a respectable\r\nTriangle in the middle class is not without its dangers; if to run\r\nagainst a Working Man involves a gash; if collision with an Officer of\r\nthe military class necessitates a serious wound; if a mere touch from the\r\nvertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of death;—what can it\r\nbe to run against a Woman, except absolute and immediate destruction? And\r\nwhen a Woman is invisible, or visible only as a dim sub-lustrous point,\r\nhow difficult must it be, even for the most cautious, always to avoid\r\ncollision!\r\n\r\nMany are the enactments made at different times in the different States\r\nof Flatland, in order to minimize this peril; and in the Southern and\r\nless temperate climates, where the force of gravitation is greater, and\r\nhuman beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions, the Laws\r\nconcerning Women are naturally much more stringent. But a general view of\r\nthe Code may be obtained from the following summary:—\r\n\r\n1. Every house shall have one entrance in the Eastern side, for the use\r\nof Females only; by which all females shall enter “in a becoming and\r\nrespectful manner”[2] and not by the Men’s or Western door.\r\n\r\n2. No Female shall walk in any public place without continually keeping\r\nup her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.\r\n\r\n3. Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus’s Dance,\r\nfits, chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing, or any disease\r\nnecessitating involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,\r\nunder penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place\r\nwithout moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to\r\nindicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman, when\r\ntravelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by her\r\nhusband; others confine Women altogether to their houses except during\r\nthe religious festivals. But it has been found by the wisest of our\r\nCircles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on Females\r\ntends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race, but also\r\nto the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a State loses\r\nmore than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.\r\n\r\nFor whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement\r\nat home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their\r\nspleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate\r\nclimates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes\r\ndestroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak. Hence the\r\nThree Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated States, and\r\nmay be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female Code.\r\n\r\nAfter all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in\r\nthe interests of the Women themselves. For, although they can inflict\r\ninstantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at once\r\ndisengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of their\r\nvictim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.\r\n\r\nThe power of Fashion is also on our side. I pointed out that in some less\r\ncivilised States no female is suffered to stand in any public place\r\nwithout swaying her back from right to left. This practice has been\r\nuniversal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all\r\nwell-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach. It\r\nis considered a disgrace to any State that legislation should have to\r\nenforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a natural\r\ninstinct. The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated undulation\r\nof the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and imitated by the\r\nwife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing beyond a mere\r\nmonotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the regular tick of\r\nthe Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the wife of the\r\nprogressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose family no\r\n“back-motion” of any kind has become as yet a necessity of life. Hence,\r\nin every family of position and consideration, “back motion” is as\r\nprevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in these households\r\nenjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.\r\n\r\nNot that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute of\r\naffection. But unfortunately the passion of the moment predominates, in\r\nthe Frail Sex, over every other consideration. This is, of course, a\r\nnecessity arising from their unfortunate conformation. For as they have\r\nno pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this respect to the very\r\nlowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently wholly devoid of\r\nbrain-power, and have neither reflection, judgment nor forethought, and\r\nhardly any memory. Hence, in their fits of fury, they remember no claims\r\nand recognise no distinctions. I have actually known a case where a Woman\r\nhas exterminated her whole household, and half an hour afterwards, when\r\nher rage was over and the fragments swept away, has asked what has become\r\nof her husband and her children!\r\n\r\nObviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a\r\nposition where she can turn round. When you have them in their\r\napartments—which are constructed with a view to denying them that\r\npower—you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly impotent\r\nfor mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the incident for\r\nwhich they may be at this moment threatening you with death, nor the\r\npromises which you may have found it necessary to make in order to pacify\r\ntheir fury.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we get on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations, except\r\nin the lower strata of the Military Classes. There the want of tact and\r\ndiscretion on the part of the husbands produces at times indescribable\r\ndisasters. Relying too much on the offensive weapons of their acute\r\nangles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and seasonable\r\nsimulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect the prescribed\r\nconstruction of the Women’s apartments, or irritate their wives by\r\nill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse immediately to\r\nretract. Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal truth indisposes\r\nthem to make those lavish promises by which the more judicious Circle can\r\nin a moment pacify his consort. The result is massacre; not however\r\nwithout its advantages, as it eliminates the more brutal and troublesome\r\nof the Isosceles; and by many of our Circles the destructiveness of the\r\nThinner Sex is regarded as one among many providential arrangements for\r\nsuppressing redundant population, and nipping Revolution in the bud.\r\n\r\nYet even in our best regulated and most approximately circular families I\r\ncannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in\r\nSpaceland. There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may be\r\ncalled by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of tastes or\r\npursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured safety at\r\nthe cost of domestic comfort. In every Circular or Polygonal household it\r\nhas been a habit from time immemorial—and has now become a kind of\r\ninstinct among the women of our higher classes—that the mothers and\r\ndaughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards their\r\nhusband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family of distinction\r\nto turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a kind of portent,\r\ninvolving loss of _status_. But, as I shall soon shew, this custom,\r\nthough it has the advantage of safety, is not without its disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman—where the wife\r\nis allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing her\r\nhousehold avocations—there are at least intervals of quiet, when the wife\r\nis neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the continuous\r\nPeace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is too often no\r\npeace. There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye are ever\r\ndirected towards the Master of the household; and light itself is not\r\nmore persistent than the stream of feminine discourse. The tact and skill\r\nwhich suffice to avert a Woman’s sting are unequal to the task of\r\nstopping a Woman’s mouth; and as the wife has absolutely nothing to say,\r\nand absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or conscience to prevent her\r\nfrom saying it, not a few cynics have been found to aver that they prefer\r\nthe danger of the death-dealing but inaudible sting to the safe\r\nsonorousness of a Woman’s other end.\r\n\r\nTo my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seem truly\r\ndeplorable, and so indeed it is. A Male of the lowest type of the\r\nIsosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle, and to the\r\nultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste; but no Woman can\r\nentertain such hopes for her sex. “Once a Woman, always a Woman” is a\r\nDecree of Nature; and the very Laws of Evolution seem suspended in her\r\ndisfavour. Yet at least we can admire the wise Prearrangement which has\r\nordained that, as they have no hopes, so they shall have no memory to\r\nrecall, and no forethought to anticipate, the miseries and humiliations\r\nwhich are at once a necessity of their existence and the basis of the\r\nconstitution of Flatland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           § 5.—_Of our methods of recognizing one another._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you who are gifted with\r\ntwo eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed with the\r\nenjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually _see_ an angle, and\r\ncontemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the happy region of\r\nthe Three Dimensions—how shall I make clear to you the extreme difficulty\r\nwhich we in Flatland experience in recognizing one another’s\r\nconfigurations?\r\n\r\nRecall what I told you above. All beings in Flatland, animate or\r\ninanimate, no matter what their form, present _to our view_ the same, or\r\nnearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line. How then can\r\none be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?\r\n\r\nThe answer is threefold. The first means of recognition is the sense of\r\nhearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you, and\r\nwhich enables us not only to distinguish by the voice our personal\r\nfriends, but even to discriminate between different classes, at least so\r\nfar as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral, the Square, and\r\nthe Pentagon—for of the Isosceles I take no account. But as we ascend in\r\nthe social scale, the process of discriminating and being discriminated\r\nby hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices are\r\nassimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is a\r\nplebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy. And wherever\r\nthere is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this method. Amongst\r\nour lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a degree more than\r\ncorrespondent with those of hearing, so that an Isosceles can easily\r\nfeign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some training, that of a Circle\r\nhimself. A second method is therefore more commonly resorted to.\r\n\r\n_Feeling_ is, among our Women and lower classes—about our upper classes I\r\nshall speak presently—the principal test of recognition, at all events\r\nbetween strangers, and when the question is, not as to the individual,\r\nbut as to the class. What therefore “introduction” is among the higher\r\nclasses in Spaceland, that the process of “feeling” is with us. “Permit\r\nme to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr. So-and-so”—is still,\r\namong the more old-fashioned of our country gentlemen in districts remote\r\nfrom towns, the customary formula for a Flatland introduction. But in the\r\ntowns, and among men of business, the words “be felt by” are omitted and\r\nthe sentence is abbreviated to, “Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so”;\r\nalthough it is assumed, of course, that the “feeling” is to be\r\nreciprocal. Among our still more modern and dashing young gentlemen—who\r\nare extremely averse to superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to\r\nthe purity of their native language—the formula is still further\r\ncurtailed by the use of “to feel” in a technical sense, meaning, “to\r\nrecommend-for-the purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt”; and at this moment\r\nthe “slang” of polite or fast society in the upper classes sanctions such\r\na barbarism as “Mr. Smith, permit me to feel you Mr. Jones.”\r\n\r\nLet not my Reader however suppose that “feeling” is with us the tedious\r\nprocess that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel\r\nright round all the sides of every individual before we determine the\r\nclass to which he belongs. Long practice and training, begun in the\r\nschools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to\r\ndiscriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an\r\nequal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the\r\nbrainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest\r\ntouch. It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel a\r\nsingle angle of any individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us the\r\nclass of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he belongs to\r\nthe higher sections of the nobility. There the difficulty is much\r\ngreater. Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge has been\r\nknown to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and there is\r\nhardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University who could\r\npretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a twenty-sided and\r\na twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThose of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the\r\nLegislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the process\r\nof introduction by contact requires some care and discretion. Otherwise\r\nthe angles might inflict on the unwary Feeler irreparable injury. It is\r\nessential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt should stand\r\nperfectly still. A start, a fidgety shifting of the position, yes, even a\r\nviolent sneeze, has been known before now to prove fatal to the\r\nincautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising friendship. Especially\r\nis this true among the lower classes of the Triangles. With them, the eye\r\nis situated so far from their vertex that they can scarcely take\r\ncognizance of what goes on at that extremity of their frame. They are\r\nmoreover of a rough coarse nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of\r\nthe highly organized Polygon. What wonder then if an involuntary toss of\r\nthe head has ere now deprived the State of a valuable life!\r\n\r\nI have heard that my excellent Grandfather—one of the least irregular of\r\nhis unhappy Isosceles class, who indeed obtained, shortly before his\r\ndecease, four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for\r\npassing him into the class of the Equal-sided—often deplored with a tear\r\nin his venerable eye, a miscarriage of this kind, which had occurred to\r\nhis great-great-great-Grandfather, a respectable Working Man with an\r\nangle or brain of 59° 30′. According to his account, my unfortunate\r\nAncestor, being afflicted with rheumatism, and in the act of being felt\r\nby a Polygon, by one sudden start accidentally transfixed the Great Man\r\nthrough the diagonal; and thereby, partly in consequence of his long\r\nimprisonment and degradation, and partly because of the moral shock which\r\npervaded the whole of my Ancestor’s relations, threw back our family a\r\ndegree and a half in their ascent towards better things. The result was\r\nthat in the next generation the family brain was registered at only 58°,\r\nand not till the lapse of five generations was the lost ground recovered,\r\nthe full 60° attained, and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally\r\nachieved. And all this series of calamities from one little accident in\r\nthe process of Feeling.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers exclaim,\r\n“How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and degrees, or\r\nminutes? We can _see_ an angle, because we in the region of Space, can\r\nsee two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who can see\r\nnothing but one straight line at a time, or at all events only a number\r\nof bits of straight lines all in one straight line,—how can you ever\r\ndiscern any angle, and much less register angles of different sizes?”\r\n\r\nI answer that though we cannot _see_ angles, we can _infer_ them, and\r\nthis with great precision. Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity,\r\nand developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more\r\naccurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure of\r\nangles. Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural helps. It\r\nis with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles class shall\r\nbegin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall increase (if it\r\nincreases at all) by half a degree in every generation; until the goal of\r\n60° is reached, when the condition of serfdom is quitted, and the freeman\r\nenters the class of Regulars.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or\r\nAlphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60°, Specimens of which are\r\nplaced in every Elementary School throughout the land. Owing to\r\noccasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral and intellectual\r\nstagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity of the Criminal and\r\nVagabond Classes, there is always a vast superfluity of individuals of\r\nthe half degree and single degree class, and a fair abundance of\r\nSpecimens up to 10°. These are absolutely destitute of civic rights; and\r\na great number of them, not having even intelligence enough for the\r\npurposes of warfare, are devoted by the States to the service of\r\neducation. Fettered immovably so as to remove all possibility of danger,\r\nthey are placed in the class rooms of our Infant Schools, and there they\r\nare utilized by the Board of Education for the purpose of imparting to\r\nthe offspring of the Middle Classes that tact and intelligence of which\r\nthese wretched creatures themselves are utterly devoid.\r\n\r\nIn some states the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist\r\nfor several years; but in the more temperate and better regulated\r\nregions, it is found in the long run more advantageous for the\r\neducational interests of the young, to dispense with food, and to renew\r\nthe Specimens every month,—which is about the average duration of the\r\nfoodless existence of the Criminal class. In the cheaper schools, what is\r\ngained by the longer existence of the Specimens is lost, partly in the\r\nexpenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the\r\nangles, which are impaired after a few weeks of constant “feeling.” Nor\r\nmust we forget to add, in enumerating the advantages of the more\r\nexpensive system, that it tends, though slightly yet perceptibly, to the\r\ndiminution of the redundant Isosceles population—an object which every\r\nstatesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view. On the whole\r\ntherefore—although I am not ignorant that, in many popularly elected\r\nSchool Boards, there is a reaction in favour of “the cheap system,” as it\r\nis called—I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the many\r\ncases in which expense is the truest economy.\r\n\r\nBut I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me from\r\nmy subject. Enough has been said, I trust, to show that Recognition by\r\nFeeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process as might have been\r\nsupposed; and it is obviously more trustworthy than Recognition by\r\nhearing. Still there remain, as has been pointed out above, the objection\r\nthat this method is not without danger. For this reason many in the\r\nMiddle and Lower classes, and all without exception in the Polygonal and\r\nCircular orders, prefer a third method, the description of which shall be\r\nreserved for the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 6.—_Of Recognition by Sight._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am about to appear very inconsistent. In previous sections I have said\r\nthat all figures in Flatland present the appearance of a straight line;\r\nand it was added or implied, that it is consequently impossible to\r\ndistinguish by the visual organ between individuals of different classes:\r\nyet now I am about to explain to my Spaceland Critics how we are able to\r\nrecognize one another by the sense of sight.\r\n\r\nIf however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage in\r\nwhich Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal, he will find this\r\nqualification—“among the lower classes.” It is only among the higher\r\nclasses and in our more temperate climates that Sight Recognition is\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nThat this power exists in any regions and for any classes, is the result\r\nof Fog; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts\r\nsave the torrid zones. That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed\r\nevil, blotting out the landscape, depressing the spirits, and enfeebling\r\nthe health, is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely inferior to air\r\nitself, and as the Nurse of arts and Parent of sciences. But let me\r\nexplain my meaning, without further eulogies on this beneficent Element.\r\n\r\nIf Fog were non-existent, all lines would appear equally and\r\nindistinguishably clear; and this is actually the case in those unhappy\r\ncountries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and transparent. But\r\nwherever there is a rich supply of Fog, objects that are at a distance,\r\nsay of three feet, are appreciably dimmer than those at a distance of two\r\nfeet eleven inches; and the result is that by careful and constant\r\nexperimental observation of comparative dimness and clearness, we are\r\nenabled to infer with great exactness the configuration of the object\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAn instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make my meaning\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nSuppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to ascertain.\r\nThey are, we will suppose, a Merchant and a Physician, or in other words,\r\nan Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon: how am I to distinguish them?\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious, to every child in Spaceland who has touched the\r\nthreshold of Geometrical Studies, that, if I can bring my eye so that its\r\nglance may bisect an angle (A) of the approaching stranger, my view will\r\nlie as it were evenly between his two sides that are next to me (viz. CA\r\nand AB), so that I shall contemplate the two impartially, and both will\r\nappear of the same size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nNow in the case of (1) the Merchant, what shall I see? I shall see a\r\nstraight line DAE, in which the middle point (A) will be very bright\r\nbecause it is nearest to me; but on either side the line will shade away\r\n_rapidly into dimness_, because the sides AC and AD _recede rapidly into\r\nthe fog_; and what appear to me as the Merchant’s extremities, viz. D and\r\nC, will be _very dim indeed_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand in the case of (2) the Physician, though I shall here\r\nalso see a line (D′A′E′) with a bright centre (A′), yet it will shade\r\naway _less rapidly_ into dimness, because the sides (A′C′, A′B′) _recede\r\nless rapidly into the fog_; and what appear to me the Physician’s\r\nextremities, viz. D′ and E′, will be _not so dim_ as the extremities of\r\nthe Merchant.\r\n\r\nThe Reader will probably understand from these two instances how—after a\r\nvery long training supplemented by constant experience—it is possible for\r\nthe well-educated classes among us to discriminate with fair accuracy\r\nbetween the middle and lowest orders, by the sense of sight. If my\r\nSpaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception, so far as to\r\nconceive the possibility of it and not to reject my account as altogether\r\nincredible—I shall have attained all I can reasonably expect. Were I to\r\nattempt further details I should only perplex. Yet for the sake of the\r\nyoung and inexperienced, who may perchance infer—from the two simple\r\ninstances I have given above, of the manner in which I should recognize\r\nmy Father and my Sons—that Recognition by sight is an easy affair, it may\r\nbe needful to point out that in actual life most of the problems of Sight\r\nRecognition are far more subtle and complex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nIf for example, when my Father, the Triangle, approaches me, he happens\r\nto present his side to me instead of his angle, then, until I have asked\r\nhim to rotate, or until I have edged my eye round him, I am for the\r\nmoment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line, or, in other\r\nwords, a Woman. Again, when I am in the company of one of my two\r\nhexagonal Grandsons, contemplating one of his sides (AB) full front, it\r\nwill be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one whole\r\nline (AB) in comparative brightness (shading off hardly at all at the\r\nends) and two smaller lines (CA and BD) dim throughout and shading away\r\ninto greater dimness toward the extremities C and D.\r\n\r\nBut I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics.\r\nThe meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when I\r\nassert that the problems of life, which present themselves to the\r\nwell-educated—when they are themselves in motion, rotating, advancing or\r\nretreating, and at the same time attempting to discriminate by the sense\r\nof sight between a number of Polygons of high rank moving in different\r\ndirections, as for example in a ball-room or conversazione—must be of a\r\nnature to task the angularity of the most intellectual, and amply justify\r\nthe rich endowments of the Learned Professors of Geometry, both Static\r\nand Kinetic, in the illustrious University of Wentbridge, where the\r\nScience and Art of Sight Recognition are regularly taught to large\r\nclasses of the _élite_ of the States.\r\n\r\nIt is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses, who\r\nare able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough\r\nprosecution of this noble and valuable Art. Even to me, a Mathematician\r\nof no mean standing, and the Grandfather of two most hopeful and\r\nperfectly regular Hexagons, to find myself in the midst of a crowd of\r\nrotating Polygons of the higher classes, is occasionally very perplexing.\r\nAnd of course to a common Tradesman, or Serf, such a sight is almost as\r\nunintelligible as it would be to you, my Reader, were you suddenly\r\ntransported into our country.\r\n\r\nIn such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line,\r\napparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly and\r\nperpetually in brightness or dimness. Even if you had completed your\r\nthird year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University, and\r\nwere perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find that\r\nthere was need of many years of experience, before you could move in a\r\nfashionable crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it is\r\nagainst etiquette to ask to “feel,” and who, by their superior culture\r\nand breeding, know all about your movements, while you know very little\r\nor nothing about theirs. In a word, to comport oneself with perfect\r\npropriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself. Such\r\nat least is the painful teaching of my experience.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how much the Art—or I may almost call it instinct—of\r\nSight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of it and by the\r\navoidance of the custom of “Feeling.” Just as, with you, the deaf and\r\ndumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the hand-alphabet, will\r\nnever acquire the more difficult but far more valuable art of lip-speech\r\nand lip-reading, so it is with us as regards “Seeing” and “Feeling.” None\r\nwho in early life resort to “Feeling” will ever learn “Seeing” in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, among our Higher Classes, “Feeling” is discouraged or\r\nabsolutely forbidden. From the cradle their children, instead of going to\r\nthe Public Elementary schools (where the art of Feeling is taught,) are\r\nsent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character; and at our\r\nillustrious University, to “feel” is regarded as a most serious fault,\r\ninvolving Rustication for the first offence, and Expulsion for the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nBut among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded as\r\nan unattainable luxury. A common Tradesman cannot afford to let his son\r\nspend a third of his life in abstract studies. The children of the poor\r\nare therefore allowed to “feel” from their earliest years, and they gain\r\nthereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast at first most\r\nfavourably with the inert, undeveloped, and listless behaviour of the\r\nhalf-instructed youths of the Polygonal class; but when the latter have\r\nat last completed their University course, and are prepared to put their\r\ntheory into practice, the change that comes over them may almost be\r\ndescribed as a new birth, and in every art, science, and social pursuit\r\nthey rapidly overtake and distance their Triangular competitors.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the Polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or Leaving\r\nExamination at the University. The condition of the unsuccessful minority\r\nis truly pitiable. Rejected from the higher class, they are also despised\r\nby the lower. They have neither the matured and systematically trained\r\npowers of the Polygonal Bachelors and Masters of Arts, nor yet the native\r\nprecocity and mercurial versatility of the youthful Tradesman. The\r\nprofessions, the public services are closed against them; and though in\r\nmost States they are not actually debarred from marriage, yet they have\r\nthe greatest difficulty in forming suitable alliances, as experience\r\nshows that the offspring of such unfortunate and ill-endowed parents is\r\ngenerally itself unfortunate, if not positively Irregular.\r\n\r\nIt is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great\r\nTumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their leaders;\r\nand so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing minority\r\nof our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true mercy would\r\ndictate their entire suppression, by enacting that all who fail to pass\r\nthe Final Examination of the University should be either imprisoned for\r\nlife, or extinguished by a painless death.\r\n\r\nBut I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities, a matter\r\nof such vital interest that it demands a separate section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      § 7.—_Of Irregular Figures._\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the previous pages I have been assuming—what perhaps should\r\nhave been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and fundamental\r\nproposition—that every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure, that\r\nis to say of regular construction. By this I mean that a Woman must not\r\nonly be a line, but a straight line; that an Artisan or Soldier must have\r\ntwo of his sides equal; that Tradesmen must have three sides equal;\r\nLawyers (of which class I am a humble member), four sides equal, and,\r\ngenerally, that in every Polygon, all the sides must be equal.\r\n\r\nThe size of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the\r\nindividual. A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a tall\r\nadult Woman might extend to a foot. As to the Males of every class, it\r\nmay be roughly said that the length of an adult’s sides, when added\r\ntogether, is three feet or a little more. But the size of our sides is\r\nnot under consideration. I am speaking of the _equality_ of sides, and it\r\ndoes not need much reflection to see that the whole of the social life in\r\nFlatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature wills all Figures to\r\nhave their sides equal.\r\n\r\nIf our sides were unequal our angles would be unequal. Instead of its\r\nbeing sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order\r\nto determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to\r\nascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling. But life would be too\r\nshort for such a tedious groping. The whole science and art of Sight\r\nRecognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an art, would\r\nnot long survive; intercourse would become perilous or impossible; there\r\nwould be an end to all confidence, all forethought; no one would be safe\r\nin making the most simple social arrangements; in a word, civilization\r\nwould relapse into barbarism.\r\n\r\nAm I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious\r\nconclusions? Surely a moment’s reflection, and a single instance from\r\ncommon life, must convince every one that our whole social system is\r\nbased upon Regularity, or Equality of Angles. You meet, for example, two\r\nor three Tradesmen in the street, whom you recognize at once to be\r\nTradesmen by a glance at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides, and you\r\nask them to step into your house to lunch. This you do at present with\r\nperfect confidence, because every one knows to an inch or two the area\r\noccupied by an adult Triangle: but imagine that your Tradesman drags\r\nbehind his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of twelve or\r\nthirteen inches in diagonal:—what are you to do with such a monster\r\nsticking fast in your house door?\r\n\r\nBut I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating details\r\nwhich must be patent to every one who enjoys the advantages of a\r\nResidence in Spaceland. Obviously the measurements of a single angle\r\nwould no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances; one’s\r\nwhole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the perimeter of\r\none’s acquaintances. Already the difficulties of avoiding a collision in\r\na crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a well-educated Square;\r\nbut if no one could calculate the Regularity of a single figure in the\r\ncompany, all would be chaos and confusion, and the slightest panic would\r\ncause serious injuries, or—if there happened to be any Women or Soldiers\r\npresent—perhaps considerable loss of life.\r\n\r\nExpediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal of its\r\napproval upon Regularity of conformation: nor has the Law been backward\r\nin seconding their efforts. “Irregularity of Figure” means with us the\r\nsame as, or more than, a combination of moral obliquity and criminality\r\nwith you, and is treated accordingly. There are not wanting, it is true,\r\nsome promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that there is no necessary\r\nconnection between geometrical and moral Irregularity. “The Irregular,”\r\nthey say, “is from his birth scouted by his own parents, derided by his\r\nbrothers and sisters, neglected by the domestics, scorned and suspected\r\nby society, and excluded from all posts of responsibility, trust, and\r\nuseful activity. His every movement is jealously watched by the police\r\ntill he comes of age and presents himself for inspection; then he is\r\neither destroyed, if he is found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation,\r\nor else immured in a Government Office as a clerk of the seventh class;\r\nprevented from marriage; forced to drudge at an uninteresting occupation\r\nfor a miserable stipend; obliged to live and board at the office, and to\r\ntake even his vacation under close supervision; what wonder that human\r\nnature, even in the best and purest, is embittered and perverted by such\r\nsurroundings!”\r\n\r\nAll this very plausible reasoning does not convince me, as it has not\r\nconvinced the wisest of our Statesmen, that our ancestors erred in laying\r\nit down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of Irregularity is\r\nincompatible with the safety of the State. Doubtless, the life of an\r\nIrregular is hard; but the interests of the Greater Number require that\r\nit shall be hard. If a man with a triangular front and a polygonal back\r\nwere allowed to exist and to propagate a still more Irregular posterity,\r\nwhat would become of the arts of life? Are the houses and doors and\r\nchurches in Flatland to be altered in order to accommodate such monsters?\r\nAre our ticket-collectors to be required to measure every man’s perimeter\r\nbefore they allow him to enter a theatre, or to take his place in a\r\nlecture room? Is an Irregular to be exempted from the militia? And if\r\nnot, how is he to be prevented from carrying desolation into the ranks of\r\nhis comrades? Again, what irresistible temptations to fraudulent\r\nimpostures must needs beset such a creature! How easy for him to enter a\r\nshop with his polygonal front foremost, and to order goods to any extent\r\nfrom a confiding tradesman! Let the advocates of a falsely called\r\nPhilanthropy plead as they may for the abrogation of the Irregular Penal\r\nLaws, I for my part have never known an Irregular who was not also what\r\nNature evidently intended him to be—a hypocrite, a misanthropist, and, up\r\nto the limits of his power—a perpetrator of all manner of mischief.\r\n\r\nNot that I should be disposed to recommend (at present) the extreme\r\nmeasures adopted in some States, where an infant whose angle deviates by\r\nhalf a degree from the correct angularity is summarily destroyed at\r\nbirth. Some of our highest and ablest men, men of real genius, have\r\nduring their earliest days laboured under deviations as great as, or even\r\ngreater than, forty-five minutes: and the loss of their precious lives\r\nwould have been an irreparable injury to the State. The art of healing\r\nalso has achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the compressions,\r\nextensions, trepannings, colligations, and other surgical or diætetic\r\noperations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly cured.\r\nAdvocating therefore a _Via Media_, I would lay down no fixed or absolute\r\nline of demarcation; but at the period when the frame is just beginning\r\nto set, and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery is\r\nimprobable, I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be painlessly\r\nand mercifully consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              § 8.—_Of the Ancient Practice of Painting._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my Readers have followed me with any attention up to this point, they\r\nwill not be surprised to hear that life is somewhat dull in Flatland. I\r\ndo not, of course, mean that there are not battles, conspiracies,\r\ntumults, factions, and all those other phenomena which are supposed to\r\nmake History interesting; nor would I deny that the strange mixture of\r\nthe problems of life and the problems of Mathematics, continually\r\ninducing conjecture and giving the opportunity of immediate verification,\r\nimparts to our existence a zest which you in Spaceland can hardly\r\ncomprehend. I speak now from the æsthetic and artistic point of view when\r\nI say that life with us is dull; æsthetically and artistically, very dull\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nHow can it be otherwise, when all one’s prospect, all one’s landscapes,\r\nhistorical pieces, portraits, flowers, still life, are nothing but a\r\nsingle line, with no varieties except degrees of brightness and\r\nobscurity?\r\n\r\nIt was not always thus. Colour, if Tradition speaks the truth, once for\r\nthe space of half a dozen centuries or more, threw a transient charm upon\r\nthe lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages. Some private\r\nindividual—a Pentagon whose name is variously reported—having casually\r\ndiscovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a rudimentary\r\nmethod of painting, is said to have begun by decorating first his house,\r\nthen his slaves, then his Father, his Sons and Grandsons, lastly himself.\r\nThe convenience as well as the beauty of the results commended themselves\r\nto all. Wherever Chromatistes,—for by that name the most trustworthy\r\nauthorities concur in calling him,—turned his variegated frame, there he\r\nat once excited attention, and attracted respect. No one now needed to\r\n“feel” him; no one mistook his front for his back; all his movements were\r\nreadily ascertained by his neighbours without the slightest strain on\r\ntheir powers of calculation; no one jostled him, or failed to make way\r\nfor him; his voice was saved the labour of that exhausting utterance by\r\nwhich we colourless Squares and Pentagons are often forced to proclaim\r\nour individuality when we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles.\r\n\r\nThe fashion spread like wildfire. Before a week was over, every Square\r\nand Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes, and\r\nonly a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out. A month or\r\ntwo found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation. A year had\r\nnot elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very highest of\r\nthe Nobility. Needless to say, the custom soon made its way from the\r\ndistrict of Chromatistes to surrounding regions; and within two\r\ngenerations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women and\r\nthe Priests.\r\n\r\nHere Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier, and to plead against\r\nextending the innovation to these two classes. Many-sidedness was almost\r\nessential as a pretext for the Innovators. “Distinction of sides is\r\nintended by Nature to imply distinction of colours”—such was the sophism\r\nwhich in those days flew from mouth to mouth, converting whole towns at a\r\ntime to the new culture. But manifestly to our Priests and Women this\r\nadage did not apply. The latter had only one side, and therefore—plurally\r\nand pedantically speaking—_no sides_. The former—if at least they would\r\nassert their claim to be really and truly Circles, and not mere\r\nhigh-class Polygons with an infinitely large number of infinitesimally\r\nsmall sides—were in the habit of boasting (what Women confessed and\r\ndeplored) that they also had no sides, being blessed with a perimeter of\r\none line or, in other words, a Circumference. Hence it came to pass that\r\nthese two Classes could see no force in the so-called axiom about\r\n“Distinction of Sides implying Distinction of Colour”; and when all\r\nothers had succumbed to the fascinations of corporal decoration, the\r\nPriests and the Women alone still remained pure from the pollution of\r\npaint.\r\n\r\nImmoral, licentious, anarchical, unscientific—call them by what names you\r\nwill—yet, from an æsthetic point of view, those ancient days of the\r\nColour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland—a childhood,\r\nalas, that never ripened into manhood, nor even reached the blossom of\r\nyouth. To live was then in itself a delight, because living implied\r\nseeing. Even at a small party, the company was a pleasure to behold; the\r\nrichly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre are said to\r\nhave more than once proved too distracting for our greatest teachers and\r\nactors; but most ravishing of all is said to have been the unspeakable\r\nmagnificence of a military review.\r\n\r\nThe sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly\r\nfacing about, and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the\r\norange and purple of the two sides including their acute angle; the\r\nmilitia of the Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red, white, and blue;\r\nthe mauve, ultramarine, gamboge, and burnt umber of the Square\r\nartillerymen rapidly rotating near their vermilion guns; the dashing and\r\nflashing of the five-coloured and six-coloured Pentagons and Hexagons\r\ncareering across the field in their offices of surgeons, geometricians\r\nand aides-de-camp—all these may well have been sufficient to render\r\ncredible the famous story how an illustrious Circle, overcome by the\r\nartistic beauty of the forces under his command, threw aside his\r\nmarshal’s bâton and his royal crown, exclaiming that he henceforth\r\nexchanged them for the artist’s pencil. How great and glorious the\r\nsensuous development of these days must have been is in part indicated by\r\nthe very language and vocabulary of the period. The commonest utterances\r\nof the commonest citizens in the time of the Colour Revolt seem to have\r\nbeen suffused with a richer tinge of word or thought; and to that era we\r\nare even now indebted for our finest poetry and for whatever rhythm still\r\nremains in the more scientific utterance of these modern days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § 9.—_Of the Universal Colour Bill._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the intellectual Arts were fast decaying.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Sight Recognition, being no longer needed, was no longer\r\npractised; and the studies of Geometry, Statics, Kinetics, and other\r\nkindred subjects, came soon to be considered superfluous, and fell into\r\ndisrepute and neglect even at our University. The inferior Art of Feeling\r\nspeedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools. Then the\r\nIsosceles classes, asserting that the Specimens were no longer used nor\r\nneeded, and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the Criminal\r\nclasses to the service of Education, waxed daily more numerous and more\r\ninsolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden which had\r\nformerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once taming their\r\nbrutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers.\r\n\r\nYear by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to\r\nassert—and with increasing truth—that there was no great difference\r\nbetween them and the very highest class of Polygons, now that they were\r\nraised to an equality with the latter, and enabled to grapple with all\r\nthe difficulties and solve all the problems of life, whether Statical and\r\nKinetical, by the simple process of Colour Recognition. Not content with\r\nthe natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling, they began\r\nboldly to demand the legal prohibition of all “monopolising and\r\naristocratic Arts” and the consequent abolition of all endowments for the\r\nstudies of Sight Recognition, Mathematics, and Feeling. Soon, they began\r\nto insist that inasmuch as Colour, which was a second Nature, had\r\ndestroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions, the Law should follow in\r\nthe same path, and that henceforth all individuals and all classes should\r\nbe recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights.\r\n\r\nFinding the higher Orders wavering and undecided, the leaders of the\r\nRevolution advanced still further in their requirements, and at last\r\ndemanded that all classes alike, the Priests and the Women not excepted,\r\nshould do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted. When it was\r\nobjected that Priests and Women had no sides, they retorted that Nature\r\nand Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half of every human\r\nbeing (that is to say, the half containing his eye and mouth) should be\r\ndistinguishable from his hinder half. They therefore brought before a\r\ngeneral and extraordinary Assembly of all the States of Flatland a Bill\r\nproposing that in every Woman the half containing the eye and mouth\r\nshould be coloured red, and the other half green. The Priests were to be\r\npainted in the same way, red being applied to that semicircle in which\r\nthe eye and mouth formed the middle point; while the other or hinder\r\nsemicircle was to be coloured green.\r\n\r\nThere was no little cunning in this proposal, which indeed emanated, not\r\nfrom any Isosceles—for no being so degraded would have had angularity\r\nenough to appreciate, much less to devise, such a model of\r\nstate-craft—but from an Irregular Circle who, instead of being destroyed\r\nin his childhood, was reserved by a foolish indulgence to bring\r\ndesolation on his country and destruction on myriads of his followers.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women in all\r\nclasses over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation. For by assigning to\r\nthe Women the same two colours as were assigned to the Priests, the\r\nRevolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain positions, every Woman\r\nwould appear like a Priest, and be treated with corresponding respect and\r\ndeference—a prospect that could not fail to attract the Female Sex in a\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nBut by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance of\r\nPriests and Women, under the new Legislation, may not be recognized; if\r\nso, a word or two will make it obvious.\r\n\r\nImagine a woman duly decorated, according to the new Code; with the front\r\nhalf (_i.e._ the half containing eye and mouth) red, and with the hinder\r\nhalf green. Look at her from one side. Obviously you will see a straight\r\nline, _half red_, _half green_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nNow imagine a Priest, whose mouth is at M, and whose front semicircle\r\n(AMB) is consequently coloured red, while his hinder semicircle is green;\r\nso that the diameter AB divides the green from the red. If you\r\ncontemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye in the same straight\r\nline as his dividing diameter (AB), what you will see will be a straight\r\nline (CBD), of which _one half_ (CB) _will be red, and the other_ (BD)\r\n_green_. The whole line (CD) will be rather shorter perhaps than that of\r\na full-sized Woman, and will shade off more rapidly towards its\r\nextremities; but the identity of the colours would give you an immediate\r\nimpression of identity if not Class, making you neglectful of other\r\ndetails. Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which threatened\r\nsociety at the time of the Colour Revolt; add too the certainty that\r\nWomen would speedily learn to shade off their extremities so as to\r\nimitate the Circles; it must then be surely obvious to you, my dear\r\nReader, that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger of\r\nconfounding a Priest with a young Woman.\r\n\r\nHow attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may readily\r\nbe imagined. They anticipated with delight the confusion that would\r\nensue. At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical secrets\r\nintended not for them but for their husbands and brothers, and might even\r\nissue commands in the name of a priestly Circle; out of doors the\r\nstriking combination of red and green, without addition of any other\r\ncolours, would be sure to lead the common people into endless mistakes,\r\nand the Women would gain whatever the Circles lost, in the deference of\r\nthe passers by. As for the scandal that would befall the Circular Class\r\nif the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were imputed to them,\r\nand as to the consequent subversion of the Constitution, the Female Sex\r\ncould not be expected to give a thought to these considerations. Even in\r\nthe households of the Circles, the Women were all in favour of the\r\nUniversal Colour Bill.\r\n\r\nThe second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization of\r\nthe Circles themselves. In the general intellectual decay they still\r\npreserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding. From\r\ntheir earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular households with\r\nthe total absence of Colour, the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of\r\nSight Recognition, with all the advantages that result from that\r\nadmirable training of the intellect. Hence, up to the date of the\r\nintroduction of the Universal Colour Bill, the Circles had not only held\r\ntheir own, but even increased their lead of other classes by abstinence\r\nfrom the popular fashion.\r\n\r\nNow therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real\r\nauthor of this diabolical Bill, determined at one blow to lower the\r\nstatus of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of\r\nColour, and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of\r\ntraining in the Art of Sight Recognition, so as to enfeeble their\r\nintellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes. Once\r\nsubjected to the chromatic taint, every parental and every childish\r\nCircle would demoralize each other. Only in discerning between the Father\r\nand the Mother would the Circular infant find problems for the exercise\r\nof its understanding—problems too often likely to be corrupted by\r\nmaternal impostures with the result of shaking the child’s faith in all\r\nlogical conclusions. Thus by degrees the intellectual lustre of the\r\nPriestly Order would wane, and the road would then lie open for a total\r\ndestruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for the subversion of our\r\nPrivileged Classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         § 10.—_Of the Suppression of the Chromatic Sedition._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agitation for the Universal Colour Bill continued for three years;\r\nand up to the last moment of that period it seemed as though Anarchy were\r\ndestined to triumph.\r\n\r\nA whole army of Polygons, who turned out to fight as private soldiers,\r\nwas utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles—the\r\nSquares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral. Worse than all, some\r\nof the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal fury. Infuriated by\r\npolitical animosity, the wives in many a noble household wearied their\r\nlords with prayers to give up their opposition to the Colour Bill; and\r\nsome, finding their entreaties fruitless, fell on and slaughtered their\r\ninnocent children and husbands, perishing themselves in the act of\r\ncarnage. It is recorded that during that triennial agitation no less than\r\ntwenty-three Circles perished in domestic discord.\r\n\r\nGreat indeed was the peril. It seemed as though the Priests had no choice\r\nbetween submission and extermination; when suddenly the course of events\r\nwas completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents which\r\nStatesmen ought never to neglect, often to anticipate, and sometimes\r\nperhaps to originate, because of the absurdly disproportionate power with\r\nwhich they appeal to the sympathies of the populace.\r\n\r\nIt happened that an Isosceles of a low type, with a brain little if at\r\nall above four degrees—accidentally dabbling in the colours of some\r\nTradesman whose shop he had plundered—painted himself, or caused himself\r\nto be painted (for the story varies) with the twelve colours of a\r\nDodecahedron. Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned voice\r\na maiden, the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon, whose affection in\r\nformer days he had sought in vain; and by a series of deceptions, aided\r\non the one side by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate, and,\r\non the other, by an almost inconceivable fatuity and neglect of ordinary\r\nprecautions on the part of the relations of the bride, he succeeded in\r\nconsummating the marriage. The unhappy girl committed suicide on\r\ndiscovering the fraud to which she had been subjected.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds of\r\nthe Women were violently agitated. Sympathy with the miserable victim and\r\nanticipations of similar deceptions for themselves, their sisters, and\r\ntheir daughters, made them now regard the Colour Bill in an entirely new\r\naspect. Not a few openly avowed themselves converted to antagonism; the\r\nrest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar avowal. Seizing this\r\nfavourable opportunity the Circles hastily convened an extraordinary\r\nAssembly of the States; and besides the usual guard of Convicts, they\r\nsecured the attendance of a large number of reactionary Women.\r\n\r\nAmidst an unprecedented concourse, the Chief Circle of those days—by name\r\nPantocyclus—arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand Isosceles. But he secured silence by declaring that\r\nhenceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession; yielding to\r\nthe wishes of the majority, they would accept the Colour Bill. The uproar\r\nbeing at once converted to applause, he invited Chromatistes, the leader\r\nof the Sedition, into the centre of the hall, to receive in the name of\r\nhis followers the submission of the Hierarchy. Then followed a speech, a\r\nmasterpiece of rhetoric, which occupied nearly a day in the delivery, and\r\nto which no summary can do justice.\r\n\r\nWith a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were now\r\nfinally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation, it was desirable\r\nthat they should take one last view of the perimeter of the whole\r\nsubject, its defects as well as its advantages. Gradually introducing the\r\nmention of the dangers to the Tradesmen, the Professional Classes and the\r\nGentlemen, he silenced the rising murmurs of the Isosceles by reminding\r\nthem that, in spite of all these defects, he was willing to accept the\r\nBill if it was approved by the majority. But it was manifest that all,\r\nexcept the Isosceles, were moved by his words and were either neutral or\r\naverse to the Bill.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be\r\nneglected, and that, if they intended to accept the Colour Bill, they\r\nought at least to do so with a full view of the consequences. Many of\r\nthem, he said, were on the point of being admitted to the class of the\r\nRegular Triangles; others anticipated for their children a distinction\r\nthey could not hope for themselves. That honourable ambition would now\r\nhave to be sacrificed. With the universal adoption of Colour, all\r\ndistinctions would cease; Regularity would be confused with Irregularity;\r\ndevelopment would give place to retrogression; the Workman would in a few\r\ngenerations be degraded to the level of the Military, or even the Convict\r\nClass; political power would be in the hands of the greatest number, that\r\nis to say the Criminal Classes, who were already more numerous than the\r\nWorkmen, and would soon out-number all the other Classes put together\r\nwhen the usual Compensative Laws of Nature were violated.\r\n\r\nA subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans, and\r\nChromatistes, in alarm, attempted to step forward and address them. But\r\nhe found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain silent\r\nwhile the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final appeal to\r\nthe Women, exclaiming that, if the Colour Bill passed, no marriage would\r\nhenceforth be safe, no woman’s honour secure; fraud, deception, hypocrisy\r\nwould pervade every household; domestic bliss would share the fate of the\r\nConstitution and pass to speedy perdition. Sooner than this, he cried\r\n“Come death.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, which were the preconcerted signal for action, the\r\nIsosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes; the\r\nRegular Classes opening their ranks, made way for a band of Women who,\r\nunder direction of the Circles, moved, back foremost, invisibly and\r\nunerringly upon the unconscious Soldiers; the Artisans, imitating the\r\nexample of their betters, also opened their ranks. Meantime bands of\r\nConvicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe battle, or rather carnage, was of short duration. Under the skilful\r\ngeneralship of the Circles almost every Woman’s charge was fatal, and\r\nvery many extracted their sting uninjured, ready for a second slaughter.\r\nBut no second blow was needed; the rabble of the Isosceles did the rest\r\nof the business for themselves. Surprised, leader-less, attacked in front\r\nby invisible foes, and finding egress cut off by the Convicts behind\r\nthem, they at once—after their manner—lost all presence of mind, and\r\nraised the cry of “treachery.” This sealed their fate. Every Isosceles\r\nnow saw and felt a foe in every other. In half an hour not one of that\r\nvast multitude was living; and the fragments of seven score thousand of\r\nthe Criminal Class slain by one another’s angles attested the triumph of\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nThe Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost. The\r\nWorking Men they spared but decimated. The Militia of the Equilaterals\r\nwas at once called out; and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on\r\nreasonable grounds, was destroyed by Court Martial, without the formality\r\nof exact measurement by the Social Board. The homes of the Military and\r\nArtisan classes were inspected in a course of visitations extending\r\nthrough upwards of a year; and during that period every town, village,\r\nand hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the lower orders\r\nwhich had been brought about by the neglect to pay the Tribute of\r\nCriminals to the Schools and University, and by the violation of the\r\nother natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland. Thus the balance of\r\nclasses was again restored.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished, and its\r\npossession prohibited. Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour,\r\nexcept by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers, was punished\r\nby a severe penalty. Only at our University in some of the very highest\r\nand most esoteric classes—which I myself have never been privileged to\r\nattend—it is understood that the sparing use of Colour is still\r\nsanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper problems of\r\nmathematics. But of this I can only speak from hearsay.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in Flatland, Colour is now non-existent. The art of making it\r\nis known to only one living person, the Chief Circle for the time being;\r\nand by him it is handed down on his death-bed to none but his Successor.\r\nOne manufactory alone produces it; and, lest the secret should be\r\nbetrayed, the Workmen are annually consumed, and fresh ones introduced.\r\nSo great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy looks back to\r\nthe far-distant days of the agitation for the Universal Colour Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 11.—_Concerning our Priests._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is high time that I should pass from these brief and discursive notes\r\nabout things in Flatland to the central event of this book, my initiation\r\ninto the mysteries of Space. _That_ is my subject; all that has gone\r\nbefore is merely preface.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation would\r\nnot, I flatter myself, be without interest for my Readers: as for\r\nexample, our method of propelling and stopping ourselves, although\r\ndestitute of feet; the means by which we give fixity to structures of\r\nwood, stone, or brick, although of course we have no hands, nor can we\r\nlay foundations as you can, nor avail ourselves of the lateral pressure\r\nof the earth; the manner in which the rain originates in the intervals\r\nbetween our various zones, so that the northern regions do not intercept\r\nthe moisture from falling on the southern; the nature of our hills and\r\nmines, our trees and vegetables, our seasons and harvests; our Alphabet,\r\nand method of writing, adapted to our linear tablets; these and a hundred\r\nother details of our physical existence I must pass over, nor do I\r\nmention them now except to indicate to my readers that their omission\r\nproceeds not from forgetfulness on the part of the Author, but from his\r\nregard for the time of the Reader.\r\n\r\nYet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks will\r\nno doubt be expected by my Readers upon those pillars and mainstays of\r\nthe Constitution of Flatland, the controllers of our conduct and shapers\r\nof our destiny, the objects of universal homage and almost of adoration:\r\nneed I say that I mean our Circles or Priests?\r\n\r\nWhen I call them Priests, let me not be understood as meaning no more\r\nthan the term denotes with you. With us, our Priests are Administrators\r\nof all Business, Art, and Science; Directors of Trade, Commerce,\r\nGeneralship, Architecture, Engineering, Education, Statesmanship,\r\nLegislature, Morality, Theology; doing nothing themselves, they are the\r\nCauses of everything, worth doing, that is done by others.\r\n\r\nAlthough popularly every one called a Circle is deemed a Circle, yet\r\namong the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle is really a\r\nCircle, but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small sides.\r\nIn proportion to the number of the sides the Polygon approximates to a\r\nCircle; and, when the number is very great, say for example three or four\r\nhundred, it is extremely difficult for the most delicate touch to feel\r\nany polygonal angles. Let me say rather, it _would_ be difficult: for, as\r\nI have shown above, Recognition by Feeling is unknown among the highest\r\nsociety, and to _feel_ a Circle would be considered a most audacious\r\ninsult. This habit of abstention from Feeling in the best society enables\r\na Circle the more easily to sustain the veil of mystery in which, from\r\nhis earliest years, he is wont to enwrap the exact nature of his\r\nPerimeter or Circumference. Three feet being the average Perimeter it\r\nfollows that, in a Polygon of three hundred sides, each side will be no\r\nmore than the hundredth part of a foot in length, or little more than the\r\ntenth part of an inch; and in a Polygon of six or seven hundred sides the\r\nsides are little larger than the diameter of a Spaceland pin-head. It is\r\nalways assumed, by courtesy, that the Chief Circle for the time being has\r\nten thousand sides.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is not\r\nrestricted, as it is among the lower Regular classes, by the Law of\r\nNature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation. If\r\nit were so, the number of sides in a Circle would be a mere question of\r\npedigree and arithmetic, and the four hundred and ninety-seventh\r\ndescendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily be a Polygon with\r\nfive hundred sides. But this is not the case. Nature’s Law prescribes two\r\nantagonistic decrees affecting Circular propagation; first, that as the\r\nrace climbs higher in the scale of development, so development shall\r\nproceed at an accelerated pace; second, that in the same proportion, the\r\nrace shall become less fertile. Consequently in the home of a Polygon of\r\nfour or five hundred sides it is rare to find a son; more than one is\r\nnever seen. On the other hand the son of a five-hundred-sided Polygon has\r\nbeen known to possess five hundred and fifty, or even six hundred sides.\r\n\r\nArt also steps in to help the process of the higher Evolution. Our\r\nphysicians have discovered that the small and tender sides of an infant\r\nPolygon of the higher class can be fractured, and his whole frame re-set,\r\nwith such exactness that a Polygon of two or three hundred sides\r\nsometimes—by no means always, for the process is attended with serious\r\nrisk—but sometimes overleaps two or three hundred generations, and as it\r\nwere doubles at a stroke, the number of his progenitors and the nobility\r\nof his descent.\r\n\r\nMany a promising child is sacrificed in this way. Scarcely one out of ten\r\nsurvives. Yet so strong is the parental ambition among those Polygons who\r\nare, as it were, on the fringe of the Circular class, that it is very\r\nrare to find a Nobleman of that position in society, who has neglected to\r\nplace his first-born son in the Circular Neo-Therapeutic Gymnasium before\r\nhe has attained the age of a month.\r\n\r\nOne year determines success or failure. At the end of that time the child\r\nhas, in all probability, added one more to the tombstones that crowd the\r\nNeo-Therapeutic Cemetery; but on rare occasions a glad procession bears\r\nback the little one to his exultant parents, no longer a Polygon, but a\r\nCircle, at least by courtesy: and a single instance of so blessed a\r\nresult induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to submit to similar\r\ndomestic sacrifices, which have a dissimilar issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                § 12.—_Of the Doctrine of our Priests._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a single\r\nmaxim, “Attend to your Configuration.” Whether political, ecclesiastical,\r\nor moral, all their teaching has for its object the improvement of\r\nindividual and collective Configuration—with special reference of course\r\nto the Configuration of the Circles, to which all other objects are\r\nsubordinated.\r\n\r\nIt is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually suppressed\r\nthose ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in the\r\nvain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,\r\nencouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration. It was\r\nPantocyclus—the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the queller of the\r\nColour Revolt—who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes the\r\nman; that if, for example, you are born an Isosceles with two uneven\r\nsides, you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made even—for\r\nwhich purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital; similarly, if you\r\nare a Triangle, or Square, or even a Polygon, born with any Irregularity,\r\nyou must be taken to one of the Regular Hospitals to have your disease\r\ncured; otherwise you will end your days in the State Prison or by the\r\nangle of the State Executioner.\r\n\r\nAll faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most\r\nflagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect\r\nRegularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by\r\nsome collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking too\r\nmuch of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in a\r\nshrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.\r\nTherefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct\r\nnor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either\r\npraise or blame. For why should you praise, for example, the integrity of\r\na Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when you\r\nought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his Rectangles?\r\nOr again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles when you ought rather to\r\ndeplore the incurable inequality of his sides?\r\n\r\nTheoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical\r\ndrawbacks. In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he\r\ncannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that\r\nvery reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,\r\nyou, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed—and\r\nthere’s an end of the matter. But in little domestic difficulties, where\r\nthe penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this theory\r\nof Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must confess that\r\noccasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse\r\nfor his disobedience that a sudden change of the temperature has been too\r\nmuch for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but\r\non his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by abundance of the\r\nchoicest sweetmeats, I neither see my way logically to reject, nor\r\npractically to accept, his conclusions.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or\r\ncastigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my Grandson’s\r\nConfiguration; though I own that I have no grounds for thinking so. At\r\nall events I am not alone in my way of extricating myself from this\r\ndilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles, sitting as Judges\r\nin Law courts, use praise and blame towards Regular and Irregular\r\nFigures; and in their homes I know by experience that, when scolding\r\ntheir children, they speak about “right” or “wrong” as vehemently and\r\npassionately as if they believed that these names represented real\r\nexistences, and that a human Figure is really capable of choosing between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nConsistently carrying out their policy of making Configuration the\r\nleading idea in every mind, the Circles reverse the nature of that\r\nCommandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents\r\nand children. With you, children are taught to honour their parents; with\r\nus—next to the Circles, who are the chief object of universal homage—a\r\nman is taught to honour his Grandson, if he has one; or, if not, his Son.\r\nBy “honour,” however, is by no means meant “indulgence,” but a reverent\r\nregard for their highest interests: and the Circles teach that the duty\r\nof fathers is to subordinate their own interests to those of posterity,\r\nthereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as well as that of their\r\nown immediate descendants.\r\n\r\nThe weak point in the system of the Circles—if a humble Square may\r\nventure to speak of anything Circular as containing any element of\r\nweakness—appears to me to be found in their relations with Women.\r\n\r\nAs it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular births\r\nshould be discouraged, it follows that no Woman who has any\r\nIrregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires that\r\nhis posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale.\r\n\r\nNow the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as all\r\nWomen are straight, and therefore visibly Regular so to speak, one has to\r\ndevise some other means of ascertaining what I may call their invisible\r\nIrregularity, that is to say their potential Irregularities as regards\r\npossible offspring. This is effected by carefully-kept pedigrees, which\r\nare preserved and supervised by the State; and without a certified\r\npedigree no Woman is allowed to marry.\r\n\r\nNow it might have been supposed that a Circle—proud of his ancestry and\r\nregardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter in a Chief\r\nCircle—would be more careful than any other to choose a wife who had no\r\nblot on her escutcheon. But it is not so. The care in choosing a Regular\r\nwife appears to diminish as one rises in the social scale. Nothing would\r\ninduce an aspiring Isosceles, who had hopes of generating an Equilateral\r\nSon, to take a wife who reckoned a single Irregularity among her\r\nAncestors; a Square or Pentagon, who is confident that his family is\r\nsteadily on the rise, does not enquire above the five-hundredth\r\ngeneration; a Hexagon or Dodecahedron is even more careless of the wife’s\r\npedigree; but a Circle has been known deliberately to take a wife who has\r\nhad an Irregular Great-Grandfather, and all because of some slight\r\nsuperiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low voice—which,\r\nwith us, even more than with you, is thought “an excellent thing in\r\nWoman.”\r\n\r\nSuch ill-judged marriages are, as might be expected, barren, if they do\r\nnot result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides; but none\r\nof these evils have hitherto proved sufficiently deterrent. The loss of a\r\nfew sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily noticed, and is\r\nsometimes compensated by a successful operation in the Neo-Therapeutic\r\nGymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles are too much\r\ndisposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a Law of the superior\r\ndevelopment. Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual diminution of\r\nthe Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the time may be not\r\nfar distant when, the race being no longer able to produce a Chief\r\nCircle, the Constitution of Flatland must fall.\r\n\r\nOne other word of warning suggests itself to me, though I cannot so\r\neasily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with\r\nWomen. About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief Circle\r\nthat, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in Emotion, they\r\nought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive any mental\r\neducation. The consequence was that they were no longer taught to read,\r\nnor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to count the angles\r\nof their husband or children; and hence they sensibly declined during\r\neach generation in intellectual power. And this system of female\r\nnon-education or quietism still prevails.\r\n\r\nMy fear is that, with the best intentions, this policy has been carried\r\nso far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex.\r\n\r\nFor the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to lead a\r\nkind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bi-mental existence. With the\r\nWomen, we speak of “love,” “duty,” “right,” “wrong,” “pity,” “hope,” and\r\nother irrational and emotional conceptions, which have no existence, and\r\nthe fiction of which has no object except to control feminine\r\nexuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have an entirely\r\ndifferent vocabulary and I may almost say, idiom. “Love” then becomes\r\n“the anticipation of benefits;” “duty” becomes “necessity” or “fitness;”\r\nand other words are correspondingly transmuted. Moreover, among Women, we\r\nuse language implying the utmost deference for their Sex; and they fully\r\nbelieve that the Chief Circle Himself is not more devoutly adored by us\r\nthan they are: but behind their backs they are both regarded and spoken\r\nof—by all except the very young—as being little better than “mindless\r\norganisms.”\r\n\r\nOur Theology also in the Women’s chambers is entirely different from our\r\nTheology elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNow my humble fear is that this double training, in language as well as\r\nin thought, imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon the young,\r\nespecially when, at the age of three years old, they are taken from the\r\nmaternal care and taught to unlearn the old language—except for the\r\npurpose of repeating it in the presence of their Mothers and Nurses—and\r\nto learn the vocabulary and idiom of science. Already methinks I discern\r\na weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present time as\r\ncompared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three hundred\r\nyears ago. I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman should ever\r\nsurreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the result of her\r\nperusal of a single popular volume; nor of the possibility that the\r\nindiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male might reveal to a Mother\r\nthe secrets of the logical dialect. On the simple ground of the\r\nenfeebling of the Male intellect, I rest this humble appeal to the\r\nhighest Authorities to reconsider the regulations of Female Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _PART II\r\n                             OTHER WORLDS_\r\n\r\n\r\n                  “_O brave new worlds,_\r\n  _That have such people in them!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _PART II_\r\n                              OTHER LANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                § 13.—_How I had a Vision of Lineland._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last day but one of the 1999th year of our era, and the first\r\nday of the Long Vacation. Having amused myself till a late hour with my\r\nfavourite recreation of Geometry, I had retired to rest with an unsolved\r\nproblem in my mind. In the night I had a dream.\r\n\r\nI saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I\r\nnaturally assumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still\r\nsmaller and of the nature of lustrous Points—all moving to and fro in one\r\nand the same Straight Line, and, as nearly as I could judge, with the\r\nsame velocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nA noise of confused, multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from\r\nthem at intervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they ceased\r\nfrom motion, and then all was silence.\r\n\r\nApproaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I accosted\r\nher, but received no answer. A second and third appeal on my part were\r\nequally ineffectual. Losing patience at what appeared to me intolerable\r\nrudeness, I brought my mouth into a position full in front of her mouth\r\nso as to intercept her motion, and loudly repeated my question, “Woman,\r\nwhat signifies this concourse, and this strange and confused chirping,\r\nand this monotonous motion to and fro in one and the same Straight Line?”\r\n\r\n“I am no Woman,” replied the small Line; “I am the Monarch of the world.\r\nBut thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?” Receiving\r\nthis abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way startled or\r\nmolested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a stranger I\r\nbesought the King to give me some account of his dominions. But I had the\r\ngreatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information on points that\r\nreally interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain from constantly\r\nassuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be known to me and\r\nthat I was simulating ignorance in jest. However, by persevering\r\nquestions I elicited the following facts:\r\n\r\nIt seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch—as he called himself—was\r\npersuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in\r\nwhich he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and\r\nindeed the whole of Space. Not being able either to move or to see, save\r\nin his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it. Though\r\nhe had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had come to\r\nhim in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made no answer,\r\n“seeing no man,” as he expressed it, “and hearing a voice as it were from\r\nmy own intestines.” Until the moment when I placed my mouth in his World,\r\nhe had neither seen me, nor heard anything except confused sounds beating\r\nagainst what I called his side, but what he called his _inside_ or\r\n_stomach_; nor had he even now the least conception of the region from\r\nwhich I had come. Outside his World, or Line, all was a blank to him;\r\nnay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space; say, rather, all was\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nHis subjects—of whom the small Lines were Men and the Points Women—were\r\nall alike confined in motion and eye-sight to that single Straight Line,\r\nwhich was their World. It need scarcely be added that the whole of their\r\nhorizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one ever see anything but a\r\nPoint. Man, woman, child, thing—each was a Point to the eye of a\r\nLinelander. Only by the sound of the voice could sex or age be\r\ndistinguished. Moreover, as each individual occupied the whole of the\r\nnarrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe, and no one\r\ncould move to the right or left to make way for passers by, it followed\r\nthat no Linelander could ever pass another. Once neighbours, always\r\nneighbours. Neighbourhood with them was like marriage with us. Neighbours\r\nremained neighbours till death did them part.\r\n\r\nSuch a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a\r\nStraight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised to\r\nnote the vivacity and cheerfulness of the King. Wondering whether it was\r\npossible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic relations, to\r\nenjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for some time to\r\nquestion his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but at last I\r\nplunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his family. “My\r\nwives and children,” he replied, “are well and happy.”\r\n\r\nStaggered at this answer—for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch\r\n(as I had noted in my dream before I entered Lineland) there were none\r\nbut Men—I ventured to reply, “Pardon me, but I cannot imagine how your\r\nRoyal Highness can at any time either see or approach their Majesties,\r\nwhen there are at least half a dozen intervening individuals, whom you\r\ncan neither see through, nor pass by? Is it possible that in Lineland\r\nproximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of\r\nchildren?”\r\n\r\n“How can you ask so absurd a question?” replied the Monarch. “If it were\r\nindeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated. No, no;\r\nneighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the birth of\r\nchildren is too important a matter to have been allowed to depend upon\r\nsuch an accident as proximity. You cannot be ignorant of this. Yet since\r\nyou are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct you as if you were\r\nthe veriest baby in Lineland. Know, then, that marriages are consummated\r\nby means of the faculty of sound and the sense of hearing.\r\n\r\n“You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices—as well\r\nas two eyes—a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his extremities. I\r\nshould not mention this, but that I have been unable to distinguish your\r\ntenor in the course of our conversation.” I replied that I had but one\r\nvoice, and that I had not been aware that His Royal Highness had two.\r\n“That confirms my impression,” said the King, “that you are not a Man,\r\nbut a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice and an utterly uneducated\r\near. But to continue.\r\n\r\n“Nature herself having ordained that every Man should wed two wives——”\r\n“Why two?” asked I. “You carry your affected simplicity too far,” he\r\ncried. “How can there be a completely harmonious union without the\r\ncombination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man and\r\nthe Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?” “But supposing,” said I,\r\n“that a man should prefer one wife or three?” “It is impossible,” he\r\nsaid; “it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five, or\r\nthat the human eye should see a Straight Line.” I would have interrupted\r\nhim; but he proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n“Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move to\r\nand fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence, which\r\ncontinues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one. In the\r\nmidst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation, the inhabitants\r\nof the Universe pause in full career, and each individual sends forth his\r\nrichest, fullest, sweetest strain. It is in this decisive moment that all\r\nour marriages are made. So exquisite is the adaptation of Bass to Treble,\r\nof Tenor to Contralto, that oftentimes the Loved Ones, though twenty\r\nthousand leagues away, recognise at once the responsive note of their\r\ndestined Lover; and, penetrating the paltry obstacles of distance, Love\r\nunites the three. The marriage in that instant consummated results in a\r\nthreefold Male and Female offspring which takes its place in Lineland.”\r\n\r\n“What! Always threefold?” said I. “Must one wife then always have twins?”\r\n\r\n“Bass-voiced Monstrosity! yes,” replied the King. “How else could the\r\nbalance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born for every\r\nboy? Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?” He ceased, speechless\r\nfor fury; and some time elapsed before I could induce him to resume his\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n“You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds his\r\nmates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus. On the\r\ncontrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated. Few are the\r\nhearts whose happy lot it is at once to recognise in each other’s voices\r\nthe partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly into a reciprocal\r\nand perfectly harmonious embrace. With most of us the courtship is of\r\nlong duration. The Wooer’s voices may perhaps accord with one of the\r\nfuture wives, but not with both; or not, at first, with either; or the\r\nSoprano and Contralto may not quite harmonise. In such cases Nature has\r\nprovided that every weekly Chorus shall bring the three Lovers into\r\ncloser harmony. Each trial of voice, each fresh discovery of discord,\r\nalmost imperceptibly induces the less perfect to modify his or her vocal\r\nutterance so as to approximate to the more perfect. And after many trials\r\nand many approximations, the result is at last achieved. There comes a\r\nday at last, when, while the wonted Marriage Chorus goes forth from\r\nuniversal Lineland, the three far-off Lovers suddenly find themselves in\r\nexact harmony, and, before they are aware, the wedded Triplet is rapt\r\nvocally into a duplicate embrace; and Nature rejoices over one more\r\nmarriage and over three more births.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     § 14.—_How I vainly tried to explain the nature of Flatland._\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures to\r\nthe level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to him\r\nsome glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things in\r\nFlatland. So I began thus: “How does your Royal Highness distinguish the\r\nshapes and positions of his subjects? I for my part noticed by the sense\r\nof sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are\r\nLines and others Points, and that some of the Lines are larger——”\r\n\r\n“You speak of an impossibility,” interrupted the King; “you must have\r\nseen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point by\r\nthe sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things,\r\nimpossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the\r\nsame means my shape can be exactly ascertained. Behold me—I am a Line,\r\nthe longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space——” “Of Length,” I\r\nventured to suggest. “Fool,” said he, “Space is Length. Interrupt me\r\nagain, and I have done.”\r\n\r\nI apologised; but he continued scornfully, “Since you are impervious to\r\nargument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I\r\nreveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles\r\nseventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the other\r\nto the South. Listen, I call to them.”\r\n\r\nHe chirruped, and then complacently continued: “My wives at this moment\r\nreceiving the sound of one of my voices, closely followed by the other,\r\nand perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in which\r\nsound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is 6.457\r\ninches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my shape to\r\nbe 6.457 inches. But you will of course understand that my wives do not\r\nmake this calculation every time they hear my two voices. They made it,\r\nonce for all, before we were married. But they _could_ make it at any\r\ntime. And in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of my Male\r\nsubjects by the sense of sound.”\r\n\r\n“But how,” said I, “if a Man feigns a Woman’s voice with one of his two\r\nvoices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognised\r\nas the echo of the Northern? May not such deceptions cause great\r\ninconvenience? And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by\r\ncommanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?” This of\r\ncourse was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered\r\nthe purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I\r\nsucceeded perfectly.\r\n\r\n“What!” cried he in horror, “explain your meaning.” “Feel, touch, come\r\ninto contact,” I replied. “If you mean by _feeling_,” said the King,\r\n“approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals, know,\r\nStranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by death. And\r\nthe reason is obvious. The frail form of a Woman, being liable to be\r\nshattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by the State; but\r\nsince Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight from Man, the\r\nLaw ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman shall be approached so\r\nclosely as to destroy the interval between the approximator and the\r\napproximated.\r\n\r\n“And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and\r\nunnatural excess of approximation which you call _touching_, when all the\r\nends of so brutal and coarse a process are attained at once more easily\r\nand more exactly by the sense of hearing. As to your suggested danger of\r\ndeception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of one’s\r\nBeing, cannot be thus changed at will. But come, suppose that I had the\r\npower of passing through solid things, so that I could penetrate my\r\nsubjects, one after another, even to the number of a billion, verifying\r\nthe size and distance of each by the sense of _feeling_: how much time\r\nand energy would be wasted in this clumsy and inaccurate method! Whereas\r\nnow, in one moment of audition, I take as it were the census and\r\nstatistics, local, corporal, mental, and spiritual, of every living being\r\nin Lineland. Hark, only hark!”\r\n\r\nSo saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which\r\nseemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable multitude\r\nof lilliputian grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n“Truly,” replied I, “your sense of hearing serves you in good stead, and\r\nfills up many of your deficiencies. But permit me to point out that your\r\nlife in Lineland must be deplorably dull. To see nothing but a Point! Not\r\neven to be able to Contemplate a Straight Line! Nay, not even to know\r\nwhat a Straight Line is! To see, yet to be cut off from those Linear\r\nprospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland! Better surely to have\r\nno sense of sight at all than to see so little! I grant you I have not\r\nyour discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert of all Lineland\r\nwhich gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no better than a\r\nmultitudinous twittering or chirping. But at least I can discern, by\r\nsight, a Line from a Point. And let me prove it. Just before I came into\r\nyour kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right\r\nto left, with seven Men and a Woman in your immediate proximity on the\r\nleft, and eight Men and two Women on your right. Is not this correct?”\r\n\r\n“It is correct,” said the King, “so far as the numbers and sexes are\r\nconcerned, though I know not what you mean by ‘right’ and ‘left.’ But I\r\ndeny that you saw these things. For how could you see the Line, that is\r\nto say the inside, of any Man? But you must have heard these things, and\r\nthen dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those\r\nwords ‘left’ and ‘right.’ I suppose it is your way of saying Northward\r\nand Southward.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” replied I; “besides your motion of Northward and Southward,\r\nthere is another motion which I call from right to left.”\r\n\r\n_King._ Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.\r\n\r\n_I._ Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n_King._ Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the World? Out of Space?\r\n\r\n_I._ Well, yes. Out of _your_ World. Out of _your_ Space. For your Space\r\nis not the true Space. True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a\r\nLine.\r\n\r\n_King._ If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself\r\nmoving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.\r\n\r\n_I._ If you cannot tell your right side from my left, I fear that no\r\nwords of mine can make my meaning clear to you. But surely you cannot be\r\nignorant of so simple a distinction.\r\n\r\n_King._ I do not in the least understand you.\r\n\r\n_I._ Alas! How shall I make it clear? When you move straight on, does it\r\nnot sometimes occur to you that you _could_ move in some other way,\r\nturning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your\r\nside is now fronting? In other words, instead of always moving in the\r\ndirection of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move\r\nin the direction, so to speak, of your side?\r\n\r\n_King._ Never. And what do you mean? How can a man’s inside “front” in\r\nany direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?\r\n\r\n_I._ Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,\r\nand will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire\r\nto indicate to you.\r\n\r\nAt the word I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part\r\nof me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept exclaiming,\r\n“I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.” But when I had at last\r\nmoved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, “She is\r\nvanished; she is dead.” “I am not dead,” replied I; “I am simply out of\r\nLineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line which you call Space,\r\nand in the true Space, where I can see things as they are. And at this\r\nmoment I can see your Line, or side—or inside as you are pleased to call\r\nit; and I can also see the Men and Women on the North and South of you,\r\nwhom I will now enumerate, describing their order, their size, and the\r\ninterval between each.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, “Does this at\r\nlast convince you?” And, with that, I once more entered Lineland, taking\r\nup the same position as before.\r\n\r\nBut the Monarch replied, “If you were a Man of sense—though, as you\r\nappear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but a\r\nWoman—but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to reason.\r\nYou ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that which my\r\nsenses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am daily\r\nconscious. I, in return, ask you to describe in words or indicate by\r\nmotion that other Line of which you speak. Instead of moving, you merely\r\nexercise some magic art of vanishing and returning to sight; and instead\r\nof any lucid description of your new World, you simply tell me the\r\nnumbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts known to any child\r\nin my capital. Can anything be more irrational or audacious? Acknowledge\r\nyour folly or depart from my dominions.”\r\n\r\nFurious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed to\r\nbe ignorant of my Sex, I retorted in no measured terms, “Besotted Being!\r\nYou think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality\r\nthe most imperfect and imbecile. You profess to see, whereas you can see\r\nnothing but a Point! You plume yourself on inferring the existence of a\r\nStraight Line; but I _can see_ Straight Lines and infer the existence of\r\nAngles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why\r\nwaste more words? suffice it that I am the completion of your incomplete\r\nself. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines, called in my country a\r\nSquare: and even I, infinitely superior though I am to you, am of little\r\naccount among the great Nobles of Flatland, whence I have come to visit\r\nyou, in the hope of enlightening your ignorance.”\r\n\r\nHearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as\r\nif to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same moment there arose\r\nfrom myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing in\r\nvehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of a\r\nhundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons.\r\nSpell-bound and motionless I could neither speak nor move to avert the\r\nimpending destruction; and still the noise grew louder, and the King came\r\ncloser, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to the\r\nrealities of Flatland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             § 15.—_Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom dreams I proceed to facts.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of the 1999th year of our era. The pattering of the\r\nrain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting[3] in the\r\ncompany of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the prospects of\r\nthe coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.\r\n\r\nMy four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their several\r\napartments; and my Wife alone remained with me to see the old Millennium\r\nout and the new one in.\r\n\r\nI was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had casually\r\nissued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most promising young\r\nHexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity. His uncles and I\r\nhad been giving him his usual practical lesson in Sight Recognition,\r\nturning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly, now more slowly, and\r\nquestioning him as to our positions; and his answers had been so\r\nsatisfactory that I had been induced to reward him by giving him a few\r\nhints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.\r\n\r\nTaking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together so\r\nas to make one large Square, with a side of three inches, and I had hence\r\nproved to my little Grandson that—though it was impossible for us to\r\n_see_ the inside of the Square—yet we might ascertain the number of\r\nsquare inches in a Square by simply squaring the number of inches in the\r\nside: “and thus,” said I, “we know that 3², or 9, represents the number\r\nof square inches in a Square whose side is 3 inches long.”\r\n\r\nThe little Hexagon meditated on this awhile and then said to me: “But you\r\nhave been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power; I suppose 3³\r\nmust mean something in Geometry; what does it mean?” “Nothing at all,”\r\nreplied I, “not at least in Geometry; for Geometry has only Two\r\nDimensions.” And then I began to show the boy how a Point by moving\r\nthrough a length of three inches makes a Line of three inches, which may\r\nbe represented by 3; and how a Line of three inches, moving parallel to\r\nitself through a length of three inches, makes a Square of three inches\r\nevery way, which may be represented by 3².\r\n\r\nUpon this, my Grandson, again returning to his former suggestion, took me\r\nup rather suddenly and exclaimed, “Well, then, if a Point by moving three\r\ninches, makes a Line of three inches represented by 3; and if a straight\r\nLine of three inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a Square of three\r\ninches every way, represented by 3²; it must be that a Square of three\r\ninches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself (but I don’t see how)\r\nmust make a Something else (but I don’t see what) of three inches every\r\nway—and this must be represented by 3³.”\r\n\r\n“Go to bed,” said I, a little ruffled by his interruption; “if you would\r\ntalk less nonsense, you would remember more sense.”\r\n\r\nSo my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my Wife’s\r\nside, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of the\r\npossibilities of the year 2000, but not quite able to shake off the\r\nthoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon. Only a few\r\nsands now remained in the half-hour glass. Rousing myself from my reverie\r\nI turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old Millennium; and\r\nin the act, I exclaimed aloud, “The boy is a fool.”\r\n\r\nStraightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a chilling\r\nbreath thrilled through my very being. “He is no such thing,” cried my\r\nWife, “and you are breaking the Commandments in thus dishonouring your\r\nown Grandson.” But I took no notice of her. Looking round in every\r\ndirection I could see nothing; yet still I _felt_ a Presence, and\r\nshivered as the cold whisper came again. I started up. “What is the\r\nmatter?” said my Wife, “there is no draught; what are you looking for?\r\nThere is nothing.” There was nothing; and I resumed my seat, again\r\nexclaiming, “The boy is a fool, I say; 3³ can have no meaning in\r\nGeometry.” At once there came a distinctly audible reply, “The boy is not\r\na fool; and 3³ has an obvious Geometrical meaning.”\r\n\r\nMy Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not\r\nunderstand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the direction\r\nof the sound. What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure! At the\r\nfirst glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways; but a moment’s\r\nobservation shewed me that the extremities passed into dimness too\r\nrapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should have thought it\r\na Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a manner impossible\r\nfor a Circle or for any Regular Figure of which I had had experience.\r\n\r\nBut my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note\r\nthese characteristics. With the usual hastiness and unreasoning jealousy\r\nof her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman had entered\r\nthe house through some small aperture. “How comes this person here?” she\r\nexclaimed, “you promised me, my dear, that there should be no ventilators\r\nin our new house.” “Nor are there any,” said I; “but what makes you think\r\nthat the stranger is a Woman? I see by my power of Sight Recognition——”\r\n“Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition,” replied she,\r\n“‘Feeling is believing’ and ‘A Straight Line to the touch is worth a\r\nCircle to the sight’”—two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer Sex in\r\nFlatland.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, “if it must be so,\r\ndemand an introduction.” Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife\r\nadvanced towards the Stranger, “Permit me, Madam, to feel and be felt\r\nby——” then, suddenly recoiling, “Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are no\r\nangles either, not a trace of one. Can it be that I have so misbehaved to\r\na perfect Circle?”\r\n\r\n“I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,” replied the Voice, “and a\r\nmore perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately, I\r\nam many Circles in one.” Then he added more mildly, “I have a message,\r\ndear Madam, to your husband, which I must not deliver in your presence;\r\nand, if you would suffer us to retire for a few minutes——” But my Wife\r\nwould not listen to the proposal that our august Visitor should so\r\nincommode himself, and assuring the Circle that the hour for her own\r\nretirement had long passed, with many reiterated apologies for her recent\r\nindiscretion, she at last retreated to her apartment.\r\n\r\nI glanced at the half-hour glass. The last sands had fallen. The second\r\nMillennium had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16.—_How the Stranger vainly endeavoured to reveal to me in words the\r\n                        mysteries of Spaceland._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sound of my Wife’s retreating footsteps had died away, I\r\nbegan to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a nearer view\r\nand of bidding him be seated: but his appearance struck me dumb and\r\nmotionless with astonishment. Without the slightest symptoms of\r\nangularity he nevertheless varied every instant with gradations of size\r\nand brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope of my\r\nexperience. The thought flashed across me that I might have before me a\r\nburglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles, who, by\r\nfeigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow into the\r\nhouse, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.\r\n\r\nIn a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened to be\r\nremarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight Recognition,\r\nespecially at the short distance at which I was standing. Desperate with\r\nfear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious “You must permit me, Sir—”\r\nand felt him. My Wife was right. There was not the trace of an angle, not\r\nthe slightest roughness or inequality: never in my life had I met with a\r\nmore perfect Circle. He remained motionless while I walked round him,\r\nbeginning from his eye and returning to it again. Circular he was\r\nthroughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle; there could not be a doubt\r\nof it. Then followed a dialogue, which I will endeavour to set down as\r\nnear as I can recollect it, omitting only some of my profuse\r\napologies—for I was covered with shame and humiliation that I, a Square,\r\nshould have been guilty of the impertinence of feeling a Circle. It was\r\ncommenced by the Stranger with some impatience at the lengthiness of my\r\nintroductory process.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ Have you felt me enough by this time? Are you not introduced\r\nto me yet?\r\n\r\n_I._ Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from\r\nignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise and\r\nnervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit. And I beseech\r\nyou to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to my Wife.\r\nBut before your Lordship enters into further communications, would he\r\ndeign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know whence his\r\nVisitor came?\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ From Space, from Space, Sir: whence else?\r\n\r\n_I._ Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your\r\nLordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ Pooh! what do you know of Space? Define Space.\r\n\r\n_I._ Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ Exactly: you see you do not even know what Space is. You\r\nthink it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you a\r\nThird—height, breadth, and length.\r\n\r\n_I._ Your Lordship is pleased to be merry. We also speak of length and\r\nheight, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.\r\n\r\n_I._ Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is\r\nthe Third Dimension, unknown to me?\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ I came from it. It is up above and down below.\r\n\r\n_I._ My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ I mean nothing of the kind. I mean a direction in which you\r\ncannot look, because you have no eye in your side.\r\n\r\n_I._ Pardon me, my Lord, a moment’s inspection will convince your\r\nLordship that I have a perfect luminary at the juncture of two of my\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ Yes: but in order to see into Space you ought to have an eye,\r\nnot on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you would\r\nprobably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it your side.\r\n\r\n_I._ An eye in my inside! An eye in my stomach! Your Lordship jests.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ I am in no jesting humour. I tell you that I come from Space,\r\nor, since you will not understand what Space means, from the Land of\r\nThree Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your Plane which\r\nyou call Space forsooth. From that position of advantage I discerned all\r\nthat you speak of as _solid_ (by which you mean “enclosed on four\r\nsides”), your houses, your churches, your very chests and safes, yes even\r\nyour insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed to my view.\r\n\r\n_I._ Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ But not easily proved, you mean. But I mean to prove mine.\r\n\r\nWhen I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his\r\napartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons; I saw your youngest\r\nHexagon remain a while with you and then retire to his room, leaving you\r\nand your Wife alone. I saw your Isosceles servants, three in number, in\r\nthe kitchen at supper, and the little Page in the scullery. Then I came\r\nhere, and how do you think I came?\r\n\r\n_I._ Through the roof, I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ Not so. Your roof, as you know very well, has been recently\r\nrepaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman could penetrate. I\r\ntell you I come from Space. Are you not convinced by what I have told you\r\nof your children and household.\r\n\r\n_I._ Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching the belongings\r\nof his humble servant might be easily ascertained by any one in the\r\nneighbourhood possessing your Lordship’s ample means of obtaining\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n_Stranger._ How shall I convince him? Surely a plain statement of facts\r\nfollowed by ocular demonstration ought to suffice.—Now, Sir; listen to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYou are living on a Plane. What you style Flatland is the vast level\r\nsurface of what I may call a fluid, on, or in, the top of which you and\r\nyour countrymen move about, without rising above it or falling below it.\r\n\r\nI am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in\r\nreality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size\r\nvarying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one\r\nplaced on the top of the other. When I cut through your plane as I am now\r\ndoing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly, call a\r\nCircle. For even a Sphere—which is my proper name in my own country—if he\r\nmanifest himself at all to an inhabitant of Flatland—must needs manifest\r\nhimself as a Circle.\r\n\r\nDo you not remember—for I, who see all things, discerned last night the\r\nphantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain—do you not\r\nremember, I say, how, when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were\r\ncompelled to manifest yourself to the King not as a Square, but as a\r\nLine, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent\r\nthe whole of you, but only a slice or section of you? In precisely the\r\nsame way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to\r\nrepresent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section\r\nof me, which is what you call a Circle.\r\n\r\nThe diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity. But now\r\nprepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions. You\r\ncannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;\r\nfor you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland; but\r\nyou can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my section becomes\r\nsmaller. See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye will be that\r\nmy Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles to a point and\r\nfinally vanishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nThere was no “rising” that I could see; but he diminished and finally\r\nvanished. I winked once or twice to make sure that I was not dreaming.\r\nBut it was no dream. For from the depths of nowhere came forth a hollow\r\nvoice—close to my heart it seemed—“Am I quite gone? Are you convinced\r\nnow? Well, now I will gradually return to Flatland, and you shall see my\r\nsection become larger and larger.”\r\n\r\nEvery reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious Guest\r\nwas speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity. But to me,\r\nproficient though I was in Flatland Mathematics, it was by no means a\r\nsimple matter. The rough diagram given above will make it clear to any\r\nSpaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three positions\r\nindicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or to any\r\nFlatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and at last\r\nvery small indeed, approaching to a Point. But to me, although I saw the\r\nfacts before me, the causes were as dark as ever. All that I could\r\ncomprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and vanished,\r\nand that he had now reappeared and was rapidly making himself larger.\r\n\r\nWhen he had regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he\r\nperceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend him.\r\nAnd indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be no Circle at\r\nall, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that the old wives’ tales\r\nwere true, and that after all there were such people as Enchanters and\r\nMagicians.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause he muttered to himself, “One resource alone remains,\r\nif I am not to resort to action. I must try the method of Analogy.” Then\r\nfollowed a still longer silence, after which he continued our dialogue.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward, and\r\nleaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?\r\n\r\n_I._ A straight Line.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ And a straight Line has how many extremities?\r\n\r\n_I._ Two.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Now conceive the Northward straight line moving parallel to\r\nitself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind it the\r\nwake of a straight Line. What name will you give to the Figure thereby\r\nformed? We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal to the\r\noriginal straight Line.—What name, I say?\r\n\r\n_I._ A Square.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ And how many sides has a Square? And how many Angles?\r\n\r\n_I._ Four sides and four angles.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square in\r\nFlatland, moving parallel to itself upward.\r\n\r\n_I._ What? Northward?\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.\r\n\r\nIf it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square would have to\r\nmove through the positions previously occupied by the Northern points.\r\nBut that is not my meaning.\r\n\r\nI mean that every Point in you—for you are a Square and will serve the\r\npurpose of my illustration—every Point in you, that is to say in what you\r\ncall your inside, is to pass upwards through Space in such a way that no\r\nPoint shall pass through the position previously occupied by any other\r\nPoint; but each Point shall describe a straight Line of its own. This is\r\nall in accordance with Analogy; surely it must be clear to you.\r\n\r\nRestraining my impatience—for I was now under a strong temptation to rush\r\nblindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space, or out of\r\nFlatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him—I replied:—\r\n\r\n“And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out by this\r\nmotion which you are pleased to denote by the word ‘upward’? I presume it\r\nis describable in the language of Flatland.”\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Oh, certainly. It is all plain and simple, and in strict\r\naccordance with Analogy—only, by the way, you must not speak of the\r\nresult as being a Figure, but as a Solid. But I will describe it to you.\r\nOr rather not I, but Analogy. We began with a single Point, which of\r\ncourse—being itself a Point—has only _one_ terminal Point.\r\n\r\nOne Point produces a Line with _two_ terminal Points.\r\n\r\nOne Line produces a Square with _four_ terminal Points.\r\n\r\nNow you can yourself give the answer to your own question: 1, 2, 4, are\r\nevidently in Geometrical Progression. What is the next number.\r\n\r\n_I._ Eight.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Exactly. The one Square produces a\r\n_Something-which-you-do-not-as-yet-know-a-name-for-but-which-we-call-a-Cube_\r\nwith _eight_ terminal Points. Now are you convinced?\r\n\r\n_I._ And has this Creature sides, as well as angles or what you call\r\n“terminal Points?”\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Of course; and all according to Analogy. But, by the way, not\r\nwhat _you_ call sides, but what _we_ call sides. You would call them\r\n_solids_.\r\n\r\n_I._ And how many solids or sides will appertain to this Being whom I am\r\nto generate by the motion of my inside in an “upward” direction, and whom\r\nyou call a Cube?\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ How can you ask? And you a mathematician! The side of anything\r\nis always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing. Consequently,\r\nas there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0 sides; a Line, if\r\nI may so say, has 2 sides (for the Points of a Line may be called by\r\ncourtesy, its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4; what Progression do\r\nyou call that?\r\n\r\n_I._ Arithmetical.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ And what is the next number?\r\n\r\n_I._ Six.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Exactly. Then you see you have answered your own question. The\r\nCube which you will generate will be bounded by six sides, that is to\r\nsay, six of your insides. You see it all now, eh?\r\n\r\n“Monster,” I shrieked, “be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no\r\nmore will I endure thy mockeries. Either thou or I must perish.” And\r\nsaying these words I precipitated myself upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n § 17.—_How the Sphere, having in vain tried words, resorted to deeds._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in vain. I brought my hardest right angle into violent collision\r\nwith the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to have\r\ndestroyed any ordinary Circle: but I could feel him slowly and\r\nunarrestably slipping from my contact; not edging to the right nor to the\r\nleft, but moving somehow out of the world and vanishing to nothing. Soon\r\nthere was a blank. But I still heard the Intruder’s voice.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Why will you refuse to listen to reason? I had hoped to find in\r\nyou—as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician—a fit\r\napostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed to\r\npreach once only in a thousand years: but now I know not how to convince\r\nyou. Stay, I have it. Deeds, and not words, shall proclaim the truth.\r\nListen, my friend.\r\n\r\nI have told you I can see from my position in Space the inside of all\r\nthings that you consider closed. For example, I see in yonder cupboard\r\nnear which you are standing, several of what you call boxes (but like\r\neverything else in Flatland, they have no tops nor bottoms) full of\r\nmoney; I see also two tablets of accounts. I am about to descend into\r\nthat cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets. I saw you lock the\r\ncupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your\r\npossession. But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain unmoved.\r\nNow I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet. Now I have it. Now I\r\nascend with it.\r\n\r\nI rushed to the closet and dashed the door open. One of the tablets was\r\ngone. With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other corner of\r\nthe room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the floor. I took\r\nit up. There could be no doubt—it was the missing tablet.\r\n\r\nI groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my senses; but\r\nthe Stranger continued: “Surely you must now see that my explanation, and\r\nno other, suits the phenomena. What you call Solid things are really\r\nsuperficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great Plane. I\r\nam in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of which you\r\nonly see the outsides. You could leave this Plane yourself, if you could\r\nbut summon up the necessary volition. A slight upward or downward motion\r\nwould enable you to see all that I can see.\r\n\r\n“The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane, the more I can\r\nsee, though of course I see it on a smaller scale. For example, I am\r\nascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon and his family in\r\ntheir several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten doors\r\noff, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the other\r\nside a Circle in his study, sitting at his books. Now I shall come back\r\nto you. And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my giving you a\r\ntouch, just the least touch, in your stomach? It will not seriously\r\ninjure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be compared with\r\nthe mental benefit you will receive.”\r\n\r\nBefore I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in my\r\ninside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me. A moment\r\nafterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a dull ache\r\nbehind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he gradually\r\nincreased in size, “There, I have not hurt you much, have I? If you are\r\nnot convinced now, I don’t know what will convince you. What say you?”\r\n\r\nMy resolution was taken. It seemed intolerable that I should endure\r\nexistence subject to the arbitrary visitations of a Magician who could\r\nthus play tricks with one’s very stomach. If only I could in any way\r\nmanage to pin him against the wall till help came!\r\n\r\nOnce more I dashed my hardest angle against him, at the same time\r\nalarming the whole household by my cries for aid. I believe, at the\r\nmoment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane, and really\r\nfound difficulty in rising. In any case he remained motionless, while I,\r\nhearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching, pressed\r\nagainst him with redoubled vigour, and continued to shout for assistance.\r\n\r\nA convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere. “This must not be,” I\r\nthought I heard him say; “either he must listen to reason, or I must have\r\nrecourse to the last resource of civilization.” Then, addressing me in a\r\nlouder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, “Listen: no stranger must witness\r\nwhat you have witnessed. Send your Wife back at once, before she enters\r\nthe apartment. The Gospel of Three Dimensions must not be thus\r\nfrustrated. Not thus must the fruits of one thousand years of waiting be\r\nthrown away. I hear her coming. Back! back! Away from me, or you must go\r\nwith me—whither you know not—into the Land of Three Dimensions!”\r\n\r\n“Fool! Madman! Irregular!” I exclaimed; “never will I release thee; thou\r\nshalt pay the penalty of thine impostures.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! Is it come to this?” thundered the Stranger: “then meet your fate:\r\nout of your Plane you go. Once, twice, thrice! ’Tis done!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         § 18.—_How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unspeakable horror seized me. There was a darkness; then a dizzy,\r\nsickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line that\r\nwas no Line; Space that was not Space; I was myself, and not myself. When\r\nI could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, “Either this is madness or\r\nit is Hell.” “It is neither,” calmly replied the voice of the Sphere, “it\r\nis Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions: open your eye once again and try to\r\nlook steadily.”\r\n\r\nI looked, and, behold, a new world! There stood before me, visibly\r\nincorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of\r\nperfect Circular beauty. What seemed the centre of the Stranger’s form\r\nlay open to my view: yet I could see no heart, nor lungs, nor arteries,\r\nonly a beautiful harmonious Something—for which I had no words; but you,\r\nmy Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.\r\n\r\nProstrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, “How is it, O\r\ndivine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom, that I see thy inside,\r\nand yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries, thy liver?”\r\n“What you think you see, you see not,” he replied; “it is not given to\r\nyou, nor to any other Being, to behold my internal parts. I am of a\r\ndifferent order of Beings from those in Flatland. Were I a Circle, you\r\ncould discern my intestines, but I am a Being composed, as I told you\r\nbefore, of many Circles, the Many in the One, called in this country a\r\nSphere. And, just as the outside of a Cube is a Square, so the outside of\r\na Sphere presents the appearance of a Circle.”\r\n\r\nBewildered though I was by my Teacher’s enigmatic utterance, I no longer\r\nchafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration. He continued,\r\nwith more mildness in his voice: “Distress not yourself if you cannot at\r\nfirst understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland. By degrees they will\r\ndawn upon you. Let us begin by casting back a glance at the region whence\r\nyou came. Return with me a while to the plains of Flatland, and I will\r\nshow you that which you have so often reasoned and thought about, but\r\nnever seen with the sense of sight—a visible angle.” “Impossible!” I\r\ncried; but, the Sphere leading the way, I followed as if in a dream, till\r\nonce more his voice arrested me: “Look yonder, and behold your own\r\nPentagonal house and all its inmates.”\r\n\r\nI looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic\r\nindividuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with the\r\nunderstanding. And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture in\r\ncomparison with the reality which I now beheld! My four Sons calmly\r\nasleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons to the South;\r\nthe Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their several apartments.\r\nOnly my affectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued absence, had quitted\r\nher room and was roving up and down in the Hall, anxiously awaiting my\r\nreturn. Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had left his room, and under\r\npretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen somewhere in a faint, was\r\nprying into the cabinet in my study. All this I could now _see_, not\r\nmerely infer; and as we came nearer and nearer, I could discern even the\r\ncontents of my cabinet, and the two chests of gold, and the tablets of\r\nwhich the Sphere had made mention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nTouched by my Wife’s distress, I would have sprung downward to reassure\r\nher, but I found myself incapable of motion. “Trouble not yourself about\r\nyour Wife,” said my Guide; “she will not be long left in anxiety;\r\nmeantime, let us take a survey of Flatland.”\r\n\r\nOnce more I felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere\r\nhad said. The further we receded from the object we beheld, the larger\r\nbecame the field of vision. My native city, with the interior of every\r\nhouse and every creature therein, lay open to my view in miniature. We\r\nmounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the depths of mines and\r\ninmost caverns of the hills, were bared before me.\r\n\r\nAwestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled\r\nbefore my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, “Behold, I am become as a\r\nGod. For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or as\r\nthey express it, _omnividence_, is the attribute of God alone.” There was\r\nsomething of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer: “Is it\r\nso indeed? Then the very pickpockets and cut-throats of my country are to\r\nbe worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there is not one of\r\nthem that does not see as much as you see now. But trust me, your wise\r\nmen are wrong.”\r\n\r\n_I._ Then is omnividence the attribute of others beside Gods?\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ I do not know. But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our\r\ncountry can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no\r\nreason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a\r\nGod. This omnividence, as you call it—it is not a common word in\r\nSpaceland—does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish, more\r\nloving? Not in the least. Then how does it make you more divine?\r\n\r\n_I._ “More merciful, more loving!” But these are the qualities of women!\r\nAnd we know that a Circle is a higher Being than a Straight Line, in so\r\nfar as knowledge and wisdom are more to be esteemed than mere affection.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ It is not for me to classify human faculties according to\r\nmerit. Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of the\r\naffections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight\r\nLines than of your belauded Circles. But enough of this. Look yonder. Do\r\nyou know that building?\r\n\r\nI looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which I\r\nrecognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,\r\nsurrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles to each\r\nother, which I knew to be streets; and I perceived that I was approaching\r\nthe great Metropolis.\r\n\r\n“Here we descend,” said my Guide. It was now morning, the first hour of\r\nthe first day of the two thousandth year of our era. Acting, as was their\r\nwont, in strict accordance with precedent, the highest Circles of the\r\nrealm were meeting in solemn conclave, as they had met on the first hour\r\nof the first day of the year 1000, and also on the first hour of the\r\nfirst day of the year 0.\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I at once\r\nrecognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square, and the Chief\r\nClerk of the High Council. It was found recorded on each occasion that:\r\n“Whereas the States had been troubled by divers ill-intentioned persons\r\npretending to have received revelations from another World, and\r\nprofessing to produce demonstrations whereby they had instigated to\r\nfrenzy both themselves and others, it had been for this cause unanimously\r\nresolved by the Grand Council that on the first day of each millenary,\r\nspecial injunctions be sent to the Prefects in the several districts of\r\nFlatland, to make strict search for such misguided persons, and without\r\nformality of mathematical examination, to destroy all such as were\r\nIsosceles of any degree, to scourge and imprison any regular Triangle, to\r\ncause any Square or Pentagon to be sent to the district Asylum, and to\r\narrest any one of higher rank, sending him straightway to the Capital to\r\nbe examined and judged by the Council.”\r\n\r\n“You hear your fate,” said the Sphere to me, while the Council was\r\npassing for the third time the formal resolution. “Death or imprisonment\r\nawaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions.” “Not so,” replied\r\nI, “the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of real space so\r\npalpable, that methinks I could make a child understand it. Permit me but\r\nto descend at this moment and enlighten them.” “Not yet,” said my Guide,\r\n“the time will come for that. Meantime I must perform my mission. Stay\r\nthou there in thy place.” Saying these words, he leaped with great\r\ndexterity into the sea (if I may so call it) of Flatland, right in the\r\nmidst of the ring of Counsellors. “I come,” cried he, “to proclaim that\r\nthere is a land of Three Dimensions.”\r\n\r\nI could see many of the younger Counsellors start back in manifest\r\nhorror, as the Sphere’s circular section widened before them. But on a\r\nsign from the presiding Circle,—who showed not the slightest alarm or\r\nsurprise—six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters rushed\r\nupon the Sphere. “We have him,” they cried; “No; yes; we have him still!\r\nhe’s going! he’s gone!”\r\n\r\n“My Lords,” said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,\r\n“there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives, to\r\nwhich I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence happened on\r\nthe last two millennial commencements. You will, of course, say nothing\r\nof these trifles outside the Cabinet.”\r\n\r\nRaising his voice, he now summoned the guard. “Arrest the policemen; gag\r\nthem. You know your duty.” After he had consigned to their fate the\r\nwretched policemen—ill-fated and unwilling witnesses of a State-secret\r\nwhich they were not to be permitted to reveal—he again addressed the\r\nCounsellors. “My Lords, the business of the Council being concluded, I\r\nhave only to wish you a happy New Year.” Before departing, he expressed,\r\nat some length, to the Clerk, my excellent but most unfortunate brother,\r\nhis sincere regret that, in accordance with precedent and for the sake of\r\nsecrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual imprisonment, but added his\r\nsatisfaction that, unless some mention were made by him of that day’s\r\nincident, his life would be spared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19.—_How, though the Sphere showed me other mysteries of Spaceland, I\r\n               still desired more; and what came of it._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted to leap\r\ndown into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede on his behalf, or at\r\nleast bid him farewell. But I found that I had no motion of my own. I\r\nabsolutely depended on the volition of my Guide, who said in gloomy\r\ntones, “Heed not thy brother; haply thou shalt have ample time hereafter\r\nto condole with him. Follow me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nOnce more we ascended into space. “Hitherto,” said the Sphere, “I have\r\nshown you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors. Now I must\r\nintroduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan upon which they are\r\nconstructed. Behold this multitude of moveable square cards. See, I put\r\none on another, not, as you supposed, Northward of the other, but _on_\r\nthe other. Now a second, now a third. See, I am building up a Solid by a\r\nmultitude of Squares parallel to one another. Now the Solid is complete,\r\nbeing as high as it is long and broad, and we call it a Cube.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my Lord,” replied I; “but to my eye the appearance is as of\r\nan Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to the view; in other\r\nwords, methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as we infer in Flatland;\r\nonly of an Irregularity which betokens some monstrous criminal, so that\r\nthe very sight of it is painful to my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the Sphere; “it appears to you a Plane, because you are not\r\naccustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in Flatland a\r\nHexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of Sight\r\nRecognition. But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by the\r\nsense of Feeling.”\r\n\r\nHe then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this marvellous Being\r\nwas indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was endowed with six plane\r\nsides and eight terminal points called solid angles; and I remembered the\r\nsaying of the Sphere that just such a Creature as this would be formed by\r\na Square moving, in Space, parallel to himself: and I rejoiced to think\r\nthat so insignificant a Creature as I could in some sense be called the\r\nProgenitor of so illustrious an offspring.\r\n\r\nBut still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher had\r\ntold me concerning “light” and “shade” and “perspective”; and I did not\r\nhesitate to put my difficulties before him.\r\n\r\nWere I to give the Sphere’s explanation of these matters, succinct and\r\nclear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant of Space, who\r\nknows these things already. Suffice it, that by his lucid statements, and\r\nby changing the position of objects and lights, and by allowing me to\r\nfeel the several objects and even his own sacred Person, he at last made\r\nall things clear to me, so that I could now readily distinguish between a\r\nCircle and a Sphere, a Plane Figure and a Solid.\r\n\r\nThis was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History.\r\nHenceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall:—most\r\nmiserable, yet surely most undeserved! For why should the thirst for\r\nknowledge be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished! My volition\r\nshrinks from the painful task of recalling my humiliation; yet, like a\r\nsecond Prometheus, I will endure this and worse, if by any means I may\r\narouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid Humanity a spirit of rebellion\r\nagainst the Conceit which would limit our Dimensions to Two or Three or\r\nany number short of Infinity. Away then with all personal considerations!\r\nLet me continue to the end, as I began, without further digressions or\r\nanticipations, pursuing the plain path of dispassionate History. The\r\nexact facts, the exact words,—and they are burnt in upon my brain,—shall\r\nbe set down without alteration of an iota; and let my Readers judge\r\nbetween me and Destiny.\r\n\r\nThe Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons by indoctrinating\r\nme in the conformation of all regular Solids, Cylinders, Cones, Pyramids,\r\nPentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons and Spheres: but I ventured to\r\ninterrupt him. Not that I was wearied of knowledge. On the contrary, I\r\nthirsted for yet deeper and fuller draughts than he was offering to me.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said I, “O Thou Whom I must no longer address as the\r\nPerfection of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe thy servant a\r\nsight of thine interior.”\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ “My what?”\r\n\r\n_I._ “Thine interior: thy stomach, thy intestines.”\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ “Whence this ill-timed impertinent request? And what mean you\r\nby saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?”\r\n\r\n_I._ My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One even more\r\ngreat, more beautiful, and more closely approximate to Perfection than\r\nyourself. As you yourself, superior to all Flatland forms, combine many\r\nCircles in One, so doubtless there is One above you who combines many\r\nSpheres in One Supreme Existence, surpassing even the Solids of\r\nSpaceland. And even as we, who are now in Space, look down on Flatland\r\nand see the insides of all things, so of a certainty there is yet above\r\nus some higher, purer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead\r\nme—O Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions, my\r\nPriest, Philosopher, and Friend—some yet more spacious Space, some more\r\ndimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground of which we shall\r\nlook down together upon the revealed insides of Solid things, and where\r\nthine own intestines, and those of thy kindred Spheres, will lie exposed\r\nto the view of the poor wandering exile from Flatland, to whom so much\r\nhas already been vouchsafed.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Pooh! Stuff! Enough of this trifling! The time is short, and\r\nmuch remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel of\r\nThree Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.\r\n\r\n_I._ Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is in thy power to\r\nperform. Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior, and I am satisfied\r\nfor ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil, thy unemancipable slave,\r\nready to receive all thy teachings and to feed upon the words that fall\r\nfrom thy lips.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Well, then, to content and silence you, let me say at once, I\r\nwould show you what you wish if I could; but I cannot. Would you have me\r\nturn my stomach inside out to oblige you?\r\n\r\n_I._ But my Lord has shown me the intestines of all my countrymen in the\r\nLand of Two Dimensions by taking me with him into the Land of Three. What\r\ntherefore more easy than now to take his servant on a second journey into\r\nthe blessed region of the Fourth Dimension, where I shall look down with\r\nhim once more upon this land of Three Dimensions, and see the inside of\r\nevery three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the solid earth, the\r\ntreasures of the mines in Spaceland, and the intestines of every solid\r\nliving creature, even of the noble and adorable Spheres.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ But where is this land of Four Dimensions?\r\n\r\n_I._ I know not: but doubtless my Teacher knows.\r\n\r\n_Sphere._ Not I. There is no such land. The very idea of it is utterly\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\n_I._ Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers the\r\nrevelations imparted to him. Trifle not with me, my Lord; I crave, I\r\nthirst, for more knowledge. Doubtless we cannot _see_ that other higher\r\nSpaceland now, because we have no eye in our stomachs. But, just as there\r\n_was_ the realm of Flatland, though that poor puny Lineland Monarch could\r\nneither turn to left nor right to discern it, and just as there _was_\r\nclose at hand, and touching my frame, the land of Three Dimensions,\r\nthough I, blind senseless wretch, had no power to touch it, no eye in my\r\ninterior to discern it, so of a surety there is a Fourth Dimension, which\r\nmy Lord perceives with the inner eye of thought. And that it must exist\r\nmy Lord himself has taught me. Or can he have forgotten what he himself\r\nimparted to his servant?\r\n\r\nIn One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line with _two_\r\nterminal points?\r\n\r\nIn Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square with _four_\r\nterminal points?\r\n\r\nIn Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce—did not this eye of\r\nmine behold it—that blessed Being, a Cube, with _eight_ terminal points?\r\n\r\nAnd in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube—alas, for Analogy, and\r\nalas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so—shall not, I say, the\r\nmotion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine Organization with\r\n_sixteen_ terminal points?\r\n\r\nBehold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16: is not\r\nthis a Geometrical Progression? Is not this—if I might quote my Lord’s\r\nown words—“strictly according to Analogy”?\r\n\r\nAgain, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are _two_\r\nbounding Points, and in a Square there are _four_ bounding Lines, so in a\r\nCube there must be _six_ bounding Squares? Behold once more the\r\nconfirming Series, 2, 4, 6: is not this an Arithmetical Progression? And\r\nconsequently does it not of necessity follow that the more divine\r\noffspring of the divine Cube in the Land of Four Dimensions, must have 8\r\nbounding Cubes: and is not this also, as my Lord has taught me to\r\nbelieve, “strictly according to Analogy”?\r\n\r\nO, my Lord, my Lord, behold, I cast myself in faith upon conjecture, not\r\nknowing the facts; and I appeal to your Lordship to confirm or deny my\r\nlogical anticipations. If I am wrong, I yield, and will no longer demand\r\na Fourth Dimension; but, if I am right, my Lord will listen to reason.\r\n\r\nI ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now your\r\ncountrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order\r\nthan their own, entering closed rooms, even as your Lordship entered\r\nmine, without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and\r\nvanishing at will? On the reply to this question I am ready to stake\r\neverything. Deny it, and I am henceforth silent. Only vouchsafe an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n_Sphere_ (_after a pause_). It is reported so. But men are divided in\r\nopinion as to the facts. And even granting the facts, they explain them\r\nin different ways. And in any case, however great may be the number of\r\ndifferent explanations, no one has adopted or suggested the theory of a\r\nFourth Dimension. Therefore, pray have done with this trifling, and let\r\nus return to business.\r\n\r\n_I._ I was certain of it. I was certain that my anticipations would be\r\nfulfilled. And now have patience with me and answer me yet one more\r\nquestion, best of Teachers! Those who have thus appeared—no one knows\r\nwhence—and have returned—no one knows whither—have they also contracted\r\ntheir sections and vanished somehow into that more Spacious Space,\r\nwhither I now entreat you to conduct me?\r\n\r\n_Sphere (moodily)._ They have vanished, certainly—if they ever appeared.\r\nBut most people say that these visions arose from the thought—you will\r\nnot understand me—from the brain; from the perturbed angularity of the\r\nSeer.\r\n\r\n_I._ Say they so? Oh, believe them not. Or if it indeed be so, that this\r\nother Space is really Thoughtland, then take me to that blessed Region\r\nwhere I in Thought shall see the insides of all solid things. There,\r\nbefore my ravished eye, a Cube, moving in some altogether new direction,\r\nbut strictly according to Analogy, so as to make every particle of his\r\ninterior pass through a new kind of Space with a wake of its own—shall\r\ncreate a still more perfect perfection than himself, with sixteen\r\nterminal Extra-solid angles, and Eight solid Cubes for his Perimeter. And\r\nonce there, shall we stay our upward course? In that blessed region of\r\nFour Dimensions, shall we linger on the threshold of the Fifth, and not\r\nenter therein? Ah, no! Let us rather resolve that our ambition shall soar\r\nwith our corporal ascent. Then, yielding to our intellectual onset, the\r\ngates of the Sixth Dimension shall fly open; after that a Seventh, and\r\nthen an Eighth——\r\n\r\nHow long I should have continued I know not. In vain did the Sphere, in\r\nhis voice of thunder, reiterate his commands of silence, and threaten me\r\nwith the direst penalties if I persisted. Nothing could stem the flood of\r\nmy ecstatic aspirations. Perhaps I was to blame; but indeed I was\r\nintoxicated with the recent draughts of Truth to which he himself had\r\nintroduced me. However, the end was not long in coming. My words were cut\r\nshort by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me, which\r\nimpelled me through Space with a velocity that precluded speech. Down!\r\ndown! down! I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to Flatland\r\nwas my doom. One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I\r\nhad of that dull level wilderness—which was now to become my Universe\r\nagain—spread out before my eye. Then a darkness. Then a final,\r\nall-consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was once\r\nmore a common creeping Square, in my Study at home, listening to the\r\nPeace-Cry of my approaching Wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           § 20.—_How the Sphere encouraged me in a Vision._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I had less than a minute for reflection, I felt, by a kind of\r\ninstinct, that I must conceal my experiences from my Wife. Not that I\r\napprehended, at the moment, any danger from her divulging my secret, but\r\nI know that to any Woman in Flatland the narrative of my adventures must\r\nneeds be unintelligible. So I endeavoured to reassure her by some story,\r\ninvented for the occasion, that I had accidentally fallen through the\r\ntrap-door of the cellar, and had there lain stunned.\r\n\r\nThe Southward attraction in our country is so slight that even to a Woman\r\nmy tale necessarily appeared extraordinary and well-nigh incredible; but\r\nmy Wife, whose good sense far exceeds that of the average of her Sex, and\r\nwho perceived that I was unusually excited, did not argue with me on the\r\nsubject, but insisted that I was ill and required repose. I was glad of\r\nan excuse for retiring to my chamber to think quietly over what had\r\nhappened. When I was at last by myself, a drowsy sensation fell on me;\r\nbut before my eyes closed I endeavoured to reproduce the Third Dimension,\r\nand especially the process by which a Cube is constructed through the\r\nmotion of a Square. It was not so clear as I could have wished; but I\r\nremembered that it must be “Upward, and yet not Northward,” and I\r\ndetermined steadfastly to retain these words as the clue which, if firmly\r\ngrasped, could not fail to guide me to the solution. So mechanically\r\nrepeating, like a charm, the words, “Upward yet not Northward,” I fell\r\ninto a sound refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring my slumber I had a dream. I thought I was once more by the side of\r\nthe Sphere, whose lustrous hue betokened that he had exchanged his wrath\r\nagainst me for perfect placability. We were moving together towards a\r\nbright but infinitesimally small Point, to which my Master directed my\r\nattention. As we approached, methought there issued from it a slight\r\nhumming noise as from one of your Spaceland blue-bottles, only less\r\nresonant by far, so slight indeed that even in the perfect stillness of\r\nthe Vacuum through which we soared, the sound reached not our ears till\r\nwe checked our flight at a distance from it of something under twenty\r\nhuman diagonals.\r\n\r\n“Look yonder,” said my Guide, “in Flatland thou hast lived; of Lineland\r\nthou hast received a vision; thou hast soared with me to the heights of\r\nSpaceland; now, in order to complete the range of thy experience, I\r\nconduct thee downward to the lowest depth of existence, even to the realm\r\nof Pointland, the Abyss of No Dimensions.\r\n\r\n“Behold yon miserable creature. That Point is a Being like ourselves, but\r\nconfined to the non-dimensional Gulf. He is himself his own World, his\r\nown Universe; of any other than himself he can form no conception; he\r\nknows not Length, nor Breadth, nor Height, for he has had no experience\r\nof them; he has no cognizance even of the number Two; nor has he a\r\nthought of Plurality; for he is himself his One and All, being really\r\nNothing. Yet mark his perfect self-contentment, and hence learn this\r\nlesson, that to be self-contented is to be vile and ignorant, and that to\r\naspire is better than to be blindly and impotently happy. Now listen.”\r\n\r\nHe ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny, low,\r\nmonotonous, but distinct tinkling, as from one of your Spaceland\r\nphonographs, from which I caught these words, “Infinite beatitude of\r\nexistence! It is; and there is none else beside It.”\r\n\r\n“What,” said I, “does the puny creature mean by ‘it’?” “He means\r\nhimself,” said the Sphere: “have you not noticed before now, that babies\r\nand babyish people who cannot distinguish themselves from the world,\r\nspeak of themselves in the Third Person? But hush!”\r\n\r\n“It fills all Space,” continued the little soliloquizing Creature, “and\r\nwhat It fills, It is. What It thinks, that It utters; and what It utters,\r\nthat It hears; and It itself is Thinker, Utterer, Hearer, Thought, Word,\r\nAudition; it is the One, and yet the All in All. Ah, the happiness, ah,\r\nthe happiness of Being!”\r\n\r\n“Can you not startle the little thing out of its complacency?” said I.\r\n“Tell it what it really is, as you told me; reveal to it the narrow\r\nlimitations of Pointland, and lead it up to something higher.” “That is\r\nno easy task,” said my Master; “try you.”\r\n\r\nHereon, raising my voice to the uttermost, I addressed the Point as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Silence, silence, contemptible Creature. You call yourself the All in\r\nAll, but you are the Nothing: your so-called Universe is a mere speck in\r\na Line, and a Line is a mere shadow as compared with—” “Hush, hush, you\r\nhave said enough,” interrupted the Sphere, “now listen, and mark the\r\neffect of your harangue on the King of Pointland.”\r\n\r\nThe lustre of the Monarch, who beamed more brightly than ever upon\r\nhearing my words, showed clearly that he retained his complacency; and I\r\nhad hardly ceased when he took up his strain again. “Ah, the joy, ah, the\r\njoy of Thought! What can It not achieve by thinking! Its own Thought\r\ncoming to Itself, suggestive of Its disparagement, thereby to enhance Its\r\nhappiness! Sweet rebellion stirred up to result in triumph! Ah, the\r\ndivine creative power of the All in One! Ah, the joy, the joy of Being!”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said my Teacher, “how little your words have done. So far as\r\nthe Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own—for he\r\ncannot conceive of any other except himself—and plumes himself upon the\r\nvariety of ‘Its Thought’ as an instance of creative Power. Let us leave\r\nthis God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his omnipresence and\r\nomniscience: nothing that you or I can do can rescue him from his\r\nself-satisfaction.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, as we floated gently back to Flatland, I could hear the mild\r\nvoice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision, and stimulating me\r\nto aspire, and to teach others to aspire. He had been angered at first—he\r\nconfessed—by my ambition to soar to Dimensions above the Third; but,\r\nsince then, he had received fresh insight, and he was not too proud to\r\nacknowledge his error to a Pupil. Then he proceeded to initiate me into\r\nmysteries yet higher than those I had witnessed, showing me how to\r\nconstruct Extra-Solids by the motion of Solids, and Double Extra-Solids\r\nby the motion of Extra-Solids, and all “strictly according to Analogy,”\r\nall by methods so simple, so easy, as to be patent even to the Female\r\nSex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    § 21.—_How I tried to teach the theory of Three Dimensions to my\r\n                   Grandson, and with what success._\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before me.\r\nI would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of\r\nFlatland. Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three\r\nDimensions be proclaimed. I would begin with my Wife.\r\n\r\nJust as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound of\r\nmany voices in the street commanding silence. Then followed a louder\r\nvoice. It was a herald’s proclamation. Listening attentively, I\r\nrecognized the words of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the\r\narrest, imprisonment, or execution of any one who should pervert the\r\nminds of the people by delusions, and by professing to have received\r\nrevelations from another World.\r\n\r\nI reflected. This danger was not to be trifled with. It would be better\r\nto avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation, and by proceeding\r\non the path of Demonstration—which after all, seemed so simple and so\r\nconclusive that nothing would be lost by discarding the former means.\r\n“Upward, not Northward”—was the clue to the whole proof. It had seemed to\r\nme fairly clear before I fell asleep; and when I first awoke, fresh from\r\nmy dream, it had appeared as patent as Arithmetic; but somehow it did not\r\nseem to me quite so obvious now. Though my Wife entered the room\r\nopportunely just at that moment, I decided, after we had interchanged a\r\nfew words of commonplace conversation, not to begin with her.\r\n\r\nMy Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physicians of\r\nno mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that respect,\r\nunfit for my purpose. But it occurred to me that a young and docile\r\nHexagon, with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable pupil. Why\r\ntherefore not make my first experiment with my little precocious\r\nGrandson, whose casual remarks on the meaning of 3³ had met with the\r\napproval of the Sphere? Discussing the matter with him, a mere boy, I\r\nshould be in perfect safety; for he would know nothing of the\r\nProclamation of the Council; whereas I could not feel sure that my\r\nSons—so greatly did their patriotism and reverence for the Circles\r\npredominate over mere blind affection—might not feel compelled to hand me\r\nover to the Prefect, if they found me seriously maintaining the seditious\r\nheresy of the Third Dimension.\r\n\r\nBut the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity\r\nof my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons for\r\nwhich the Circle had desired that mysterious interview, and of the means\r\nby which he had entered our house. Without entering into the details of\r\nthe elaborate account I gave her,—an account, I fear, not quite so\r\nconsistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland might desire,—I must be\r\ncontent with saying that I succeeded at last in persuading her to return\r\nquietly to her household duties without eliciting from me any reference\r\nto the World of Three Dimensions. This done, I immediately sent for my\r\nGrandson; for, to confess the truth, I felt that all that I had seen and\r\nheard was in some strange way slipping away from me, like the image of a\r\nhalf-grasped, tantalizing dream, and I longed to essay my skill in making\r\na first disciple.\r\n\r\nWhen my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door. Then,\r\nsitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets—or, as you\r\nwould call them, Lines—I told him we would resume the lesson of\r\nyesterday. I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One Dimension\r\nproduces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions produces a\r\nSquare. After this, forcing a laugh, I said, “And now, you scamp, you\r\nwanted to make me believe that a Square may in the same way by motion\r\n‘Upward, not Northward,’ produce another figure, a sort of extra Square\r\nin Three Dimensions. Say that again, you young rascal.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment we heard once more the herald’s “O yes! O yes!” outside in\r\nthe street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council. Young though he\r\nwas, my Grandson—who was unusually intelligent for his age, and bred up\r\nin perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles—took in the\r\nsituation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared. He remained\r\nsilent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away, and then,\r\nbursting into tears, “Dear Grandpapa,” he said, “that was only my fun,\r\nand of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything\r\nthen about the new Law; and I don’t think I said anything about the Third\r\nDimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about ‘Upward, not\r\nNorthward,’ for that would be such nonsense, you know. How could a thing\r\nmove Upward, and not Northward? Upward, and not Northward! Even if I were\r\na baby, I could not be so absurd as that. How silly it is! Ha! ha! ha!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all silly,” said I, losing my temper; “here for example, I take\r\nthis Square,”—and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was\r\nlying at hand—“and I move it, you see, not Northward but—yes, I move it\r\nUpward—that is to say, not Northward, but I move it somewhere—not exactly\r\nlike this, but somehow—” Here I brought my sentence to an inane\r\nconclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner, much to the\r\namusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder than ever, and\r\ndeclared that I was not teaching him, but joking with him; and so saying\r\nhe unlocked the door and ran out of the room. Thus ended my first attempt\r\nto convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three Dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 22.—_How I then tried to diffuse the Theory of Three Dimensions by\r\n                    other means, and of the result._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate my secret\r\nto others of my household; yet neither was I led by it to despair of\r\nsuccess. Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on the catch-phrase\r\n“Upward, not Northward,” but must rather endeavour to seek a\r\ndemonstration by setting before the public a clear view of the whole\r\nsubject; and for this purpose it seemed necessary to resort to writing.\r\n\r\nSo I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise\r\non the mysteries of Three Dimensions. Only, with the view of evading the\r\nLaw, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a\r\nThoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland and\r\nsee simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was possible\r\nthat there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as it were,\r\nwith six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points. But in writing\r\nthis book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility of drawing\r\nsuch diagrams as were necessary for my purpose; for of course, in our\r\ncountry of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and no diagrams but\r\nLines, all in one straight Line and only distinguishable by difference of\r\nsize and brightness; so that, when I had finished my treatise (which I\r\nentitled “Through Flatland to Thoughtland”) I could not feel certain that\r\nmany would understand my meaning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my life was under a cloud. All pleasures palled upon me; all\r\nsights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because I could\r\nnot but compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was if\r\nseen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons aloud.\r\nI neglected my clients and my own business to give myself to the\r\ncontemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I could\r\nimpart to no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce even before\r\nmy own mental vision.\r\n\r\nOne day, about eleven months after my return from Spaceland, I tried to\r\nsee a Cube with my eye closed, but failed; and though I succeeded\r\nafterwards, I was not then quite certain (nor have I been ever\r\nafterwards) that I had exactly realized the original. This made me more\r\nmelancholy than before, and determined me to take some step; yet what, I\r\nknew not. I felt that I would have been willing to sacrifice my life for\r\nthe Cause, if thereby I could have produced conviction. But if I could\r\nnot convince my Grandson, how could I convince the highest and most\r\ndeveloped Circles in the land?\r\n\r\nAnd yet at times my spirit was too strong for me, and I gave vent to\r\ndangerous utterances. Already I was considered heterodox if not\r\ntreasonable, and I was keenly alive to the dangers of my position;\r\nnevertheless I could not at times refrain from bursting out into\r\nsuspicious or half-seditious utterances, even among the highest Polygonal\r\nand Circular society. When, for example, the question arose about the\r\ntreatment of those lunatics who said that they had received the power of\r\nseeing the insides of things, I would quote the saying of an ancient\r\nCircle, who declared that prophets and inspired people are always\r\nconsidered by the majority to be mad; and I could not help occasionally\r\ndropping such expressions as “the eye that discerns the interiors of\r\nthings,” and “the all-seeing land:” once or twice I even let fall the\r\nforbidden terms “the Third and Fourth Dimensions.” At last, to complete a\r\nseries of minor indiscretions, at a meeting of our Local Speculative\r\nSociety held at the palace of the Prefect himself,—some extremely silly\r\nperson having read an elaborate paper exhibiting the precise reasons why\r\nProvidence has limited the number of Dimensions to Two, and why the\r\nattribute of omnividence is assigned to the Supreme alone—I so far forgot\r\nmyself as to give an exact account of the whole of my voyage with the\r\nSphere into Space, and to the Assembly Hall in our Metropolis, and then\r\nto Space again, and of my return home, and of everything that I had seen\r\nand heard in fact or vision. At first, indeed, I pretended that I was\r\ndescribing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person; but my\r\nenthusiasm soon forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a\r\nfervent peroration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of\r\nprejudice and to become believers in the Third Dimension.\r\n\r\nNeed I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?\r\n\r\nNext morning, standing in the very place where but a very few months ago\r\nthe Sphere had stood in my company, I was allowed to begin and to\r\ncontinue my narration unquestioned and uninterrupted. But from the first\r\nI foresaw my fate; for the President, noting that a guard of the better\r\nsort of Policemen was in attendance, of angularity little, if at all,\r\nunder 55°, ordered them to be relieved before I began my defence, by an\r\ninferior class of 2° or 3°. I knew only too well what that meant. I was\r\nto be executed or imprisoned, and my story was to be kept secret from the\r\nworld by the simultaneous destruction of the officials who had heard it;\r\nand, this being the case, the President desired to substitute the cheaper\r\nfor the more expensive victims.\r\n\r\nAfter I had concluded my defence, the President, perhaps perceiving that\r\nsome of the junior Circles had been moved by my evident earnestness,\r\nasked me two questions:—\r\n\r\n1. Whether I could indicate the direction which I meant when I used the\r\nwords “Upward, not Northward”?\r\n\r\n2. Whether I could by any diagrams or descriptions (other than the\r\nenumeration of imaginary sides and angles) indicate the Figure I was\r\npleased to call a Cube?\r\n\r\nI declared that I could say nothing more, and that I must commit myself\r\nto the Truth, whose cause would surely prevail in the end.\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he quite concurred in my sentiment, and that I\r\ncould not do better. I must be sentenced to perpetual imprisonment; but\r\nif the Truth intended that I should emerge from prison and evangelize the\r\nworld, the Truth might be trusted to bring that result to pass. Meanwhile\r\nI should be subjected to no discomfort that was not necessary to preclude\r\nescape, and, unless I forfeited the privilege by misconduct, I should be\r\noccasionally permitted to see my brother, who had preceded me to my\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nSeven years have elapsed and I am still a prisoner, and—if I except the\r\noccasional visits of my brother—debarred from all companionship save that\r\nof my jailers. My brother is one of the best of Squares, just, sensible,\r\ncheerful, and not without fraternal affection; yet I must confess that my\r\nweekly interviews, at least in one respect, cause me the bitterest pain.\r\nHe was present when the Sphere manifested himself in the Council Chamber;\r\nhe saw the Sphere’s changing sections; he heard the explanation of the\r\nphenomena then given to the Circles. Since that time, scarcely a week has\r\npassed during seven whole years, without his hearing from me a repetition\r\nof the part I played in that manifestation, together with ample\r\ndescriptions of all the phenomena in Spaceland, and the arguments for the\r\nexistence of Solid things derivable from Analogy. Yet—I take shame to be\r\nforced to confess it—my brother has not yet grasped the nature of the\r\nThird Dimension, and frankly avows his disbelief in the existence of a\r\nSphere.\r\n\r\nHence I am absolutely destitute of converts, and, for aught that I can\r\nsee, the millennial Revelation has been made to me for nothing.\r\nPrometheus up in Spaceland was bound for bringing down fire for mortals,\r\nbut I—poor Flatland Prometheus—lie here in prison for bringing down\r\nnothing to my countrymen. Yet I exist in the hope that these memoirs, in\r\nsome manner, I know not how, may find their way to the minds of humanity\r\nin Some Dimension, and may stir up a race of rebels who shall refuse to\r\nbe confined to limited Dimensionality.\r\n\r\nThat is the hope of my brighter moments. Alas, it is not always so.\r\nHeavily weighs on me at times the burdensome reflection that I cannot\r\nhonestly say I am confident as to the exact shape of the once-seen,\r\noft-regretted Cube; and in my nightly visions the mysterious precept,\r\n“Upward, not Northward,” haunts me like a soul-devouring Sphinx. It is\r\npart of the martyrdom which I endure for the cause of the Truth that\r\nthere are seasons of mental weakness, when Cubes and Spheres flit away\r\ninto the background of scarce-possible existences; when the Land of Three\r\nDimensions seems almost as visionary as the Land of One or None; nay,\r\nwhen even this hard wall that bars me from my freedom, these very tablets\r\non which I am writing, and all the substantial realities of Flatland\r\nitself, appear no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination, or\r\nthe baseless fabric of a dream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END OF FLATLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]“What need of a certificate?” a Spaceland critic may ask: “Is not the\r\n    procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature herself,\r\n    proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?” I reply that no Lady of\r\n    any position will marry an uncertified Triangle. Square offspring has\r\n    sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle: but in almost\r\n    every such case the Irregularity of the first generation is visited\r\n    on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal rank, or\r\n    relapses to the Triangular.\r\n\r\n[2]When I was in Spaceland I understood that some of your Priestly\r\n    Circles have in the same way a separate entrance for Villagers,\r\n    Farmers, and Teachers of Board Schools (_Spectator_, Sept. 1884, p.\r\n    1255) that they may “approach in a becoming and respectful manner.”\r\n\r\n[3]When I say “sitting,” of course I do not mean any change of attitude\r\n    such as you in Spaceland signify by that word; for as we have no\r\n    feet, we can no more “sit” nor “stand” (in your sense of the word)\r\n    than one of your soles or flounders.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, we perfectly well recognise the different mental states\r\n    of volition implied in “lying,” “sitting,” and “standing,” which are\r\n    to some extent indicated to a beholder by a slight increase of lustre\r\n    corresponding to the increase of volition.\r\n\r\n    But on this, and a thousand other kindred subjects, time forbids me\r\n    to dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n              LONDON: R.
