This treatise is an attempt to answer that demand, and to\r\ngive to the farmers of our country, at the same time, enough of\r\nscientific principles to satisfy intelligent inquiry, and plain and full\r\ndirections for executing work in the field, according to the best known\r\nrules. It has been my endeavor to show what lands in America require\r\ndrainage, and how to drain them best, at least expense; to explain how\r\nthe theories and the practice of the Old World require modification for\r\nthe cheaper lands, the dearer labor, and the various climate of the New;\r\nand, finally, to suggest how, through improved implements and processes,\r\nthe inventive genius of our country may make the brain assist and\r\nrelieve the labor of the hand.\r\n\r\nWith some hope that my humble labors, in a field so broad, may not have\r\nentirely failed of their object, this work is offered to the attention\r\nof American farmers.\r\n\r\n                                                          H.

H.\r\n     Klippart, Esq.; of Professor Mapes; B. P. Johnston, Esq.; Governor\r\n     Wright, Mr. Custis, &c.--Prejudice against what is\r\n     English.--Acknowledgements to our Friends at Home and Abroad.--The\r\n     Wants of our Farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Book upon Farm Drainage! What can a person find on such a subject to\r\nwrite a book about? A friend suggests, that in order to treat any one\r\nsubject fully, it is necessary to know everything and speak of\r\neverything, because all knowledge is in some measure connected.\r\n\r\nWith an earnest endeavor to clip the wings of imagination, and to keep\r\nnot only on the earth, but to burrow, like a mole or a sub-soiler, _in_\r\nit, with a painful apprehension lest some technical term in Chemistry or\r\nPhilosophy should falsely indicate that we make pretensions to the\r\ncharacter of a scientific farmer, or some old phrase of law-Latin should\r\nbetray that we know something besides agriculture, and so, are not\r\nworthy of the confidence of practical men, we have, nevertheless, by\r\nsome means, got together more than a bookfull of matter upon our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOur publisher says our book must be so large, and no larger--and we all\r\nknow that an author is but as a grasshopper in the hands of his\r\npublisher, and ought to be very thankful to be allowed to publish his\r\nbook at all. So we have only to say, that if there is any chapter in\r\nthis book not sufficiently elaborate, or any subject akin to that of\r\ndrainage, that ought to have been embraced in our plan and is not, it is\r\nbecause we have not space for further expansion. The reader has our\r\nheartfelt sympathy, if it should happen that the very topic which most\r\ninterests him, is entirely omitted, or imperfectly treated; and we can\r\nonly advise him to write a book himself, by way of showing proper\r\nresentment, and put into it everything that everybody desires most to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nA book that shall contain all that we do _not_ know on the subject of\r\ndrainage, would be a valuable acquisition to agricultural literature,\r\nand we bespeak an early copy of it when published.\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION is a subject closely connected with drainage, and, although\r\nit would require a volume of equal size with this to lay it properly\r\nbefore the American public, who know so little of water-meadows and\r\nliquid-manuring, and even of the artificial application of water to land\r\nin any way, we feel called upon for an apology for its omission.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury, whose name does honor to his nation over all the\r\ncivilized world, and on whom the blessings of every navigator upon the\r\ngreat waters, are constantly showered, in a letter which we had the\r\nhonor recently to receive from him, thus speaks of this subject:\r\n\r\n\"I was writing to a friend some months ago upon the subject of drainage\r\nin this country, and I am pleased to infer from your letter, that our\r\nopinions are somewhat similar. The climate of England is much more moist\r\nthan this, though the amount of rain in many parts of this country, is\r\nmuch greater than the amount of rain there. It drizzles there more than\r\nit does here. Owing to the high dew point in England, but a small\r\nportion only--that is, comparatively small--of the rain that falls can\r\nbe evaporated again; consequently, it remains in the soil until it is\r\ndrained off. Here, on the other hand, the clouds pour it down, and the\r\nsun sucks it up right away, so that the perfection of drainage for this\r\ncountry would be the very reverse, almost, of the drainage in England.\r\nIf, instead of leading the water off into the water-veins and streams of\r\nthe country, as is there done, we could collect it in pools on the farm,\r\nso as to be used in time of drought for irrigation, then your system of\r\ndrainage would be worth untold wealth. Of course, in low grounds, and\r\nall places where the atmosphere does not afford sufficient drainage by\r\nevaporation, the English plan will do very well, and much good may be\r\ndone by a treatise which shall enable owners to reclaim or improve such\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the importance of this subject of drainage, seems all at once to\r\nhave found universal acknowledgement throughout our country, not only\r\nfrom agriculturists, but from philosophers and men of general science.\r\n\r\nEmerson, whose eagle glance, piercing beyond the sight of other men,\r\nrecognizes in so-called accidental heroes the \"Representative men\" of\r\nthe ages, and in what to others seem but caprices and conventionalisms,\r\nthe \"Traits\" of a nation, yet never overlooks the practical and\r\nevery-day wants of man, in a recent address at Concord, Mass., the place\r\nof his residence, thus characteristically alludes to our subject:\r\n\r\n\"Concord is one of the oldest towns in the country--far on now in its\r\nthird century. The Select-men have once in five years perambulated its\r\nbounds, and yet, in this year, a very large quantity of land has been\r\ndiscovered and added to the agricultural land, and without a murmur of\r\ncomplaint from any neighbor. By drainage, we have gone to the subsoil,\r\nand we have a Concord under Concord, a Middlesex under Middlesex, and a\r\nbasement-story of Massachusetts more valuable than all the\r\nsuperstructure. Tiles are political economists. They are so many\r\nYoung-Americans announcing a better era, and a day of fat things.\"\r\n\r\nJohn H. Klippart, Esq., the learned Secretary of the Ohio Board of\r\nAgriculture, expresses his opinion upon the importance of our subject in\r\nhis own State, in this emphatic language:\r\n\r\n\"The agriculture of Ohio can make no farther marked progress until a\r\ngood system of under-drainage has been adopted.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Country Gentleman_, from Ashtabula County, Ohio,\r\nsays:--\"One of two things must be done by us here. Clay predominates in\r\nour soil, and we must under-drain our land, or sell and move west.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Mapes, of New York, under date of January 17, 1859, says of\r\nunder-draining:\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that farming can be pursued with full profit without\r\nit. It would seem to be no longer a question. The experience of England,\r\nin the absence of all other proof, would be sufficient to show that\r\ncapital may be invested more safely in under-draining, than in any other\r\nway; for, after the expenditure of many millions by English farmers in\r\nthis way, it has been clearly proved that their increased profit,\r\narising from this cause alone, is sufficient to pay the total expense in\r\nfull, with interest, within twenty years, thus leaving their farms\r\nincreased permanently to the amount of the total cost, while the income\r\nis augmented in a still greater ratio. It is quite doubtful whether\r\nEngland could at this time sustain her increased population, if it were\r\nnot for her system of thorough-drainage. In my own practice, the result\r\nhas been such as to convince me of its advantages, and I should be\r\nunwilling to enter into any new cultivation without thorough drainage.\"\r\n\r\nB. P. Johnson, Secretary of the New York Board of Agriculture, in answer\r\nto some inquiries upon the subject of drainage with tiles, writes us,\r\nunder date of December, 1858, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I have given much time and attention to the subject of drainage, having\r\ndeemed it all-important to the improvement of the farms of our State. I\r\nam well satisfied, from a careful examination in England, as well as\r\nfrom my observation in this country, that tiles are far preferable to\r\nany other material that I know of for drains, and this is the opinion of\r\nall those who have engaged extensively in the work in this State, so far\r\nas I have information. It is gratifying to be assured, that during the\r\nyear past, there has been probably more land-draining than during any\r\nprevious year, showing the deep interest which is taken in this\r\nall-important work, so indispensable to the success of the farmer.\"\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained, by inquiry at the Land Office, that more than\r\n52,000,000 acres of swamp and overflowed lands have been selected under\r\nthe Acts of March 2d, 1849, and September 28th, 1850, from the dates of\r\nthose grants to September, 1856; and it is estimated that, when the\r\ngrants shall have been entirely adjusted, they will amount to 60,000,000\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nGrants of these lands have been made by Congress, from the public\r\ndomain, gratuitously, to the States in which they lie, upon the idea\r\nthat they were not only worthless to the Government, but dangerous to\r\nthe health of the neighboring inhabitants, with the hope that the State\r\ngovernments might take measures to reclaim them for cultivation, or, at\r\nleast, render them harmless, by the removal of their surplus water.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wright, of Indiana, in a public address, estimated the marshy\r\nlands of that State at 3,000,000 acres. \"These lands,\" he says, \"were\r\ngenerally avoided by early settlers, as being comparatively worthless;\r\nbut, when drained, they become eminently fertile.\" He further says: \"I\r\nknow a farm of 160 acres, which was sold five years ago for $500, that\r\nby an expenditure of less than $200, in draining and ditching, has been\r\nso improved, that the owner has refused for it an offer of $3,000.\"\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the United States Agricultural Society, at Washington,\r\nin January, 1857, Mr. G. W. P. Custis spoke in connection with the great\r\nimportance of this subject, of the vast quantity of soil--the richest\r\nconceivable--now lying waste, to the extent of 100,000 acres, along the\r\nbanks of the Lower Potomac, and which he denominates by the old Virginia\r\ntitle of _pocoson_. The fertility of this reclaimable swamp he reports\r\nto be astonishing; and he has corroborated the opinion by experiments\r\nwhich confounded every beholder. \"These lands on our time-honored\r\nriver,\" he says, \"if brought into use, would supply provisions at half\r\nthe present cost, and would in other respects prove of the greatest\r\nadvantage.\"\r\n\r\nThe drainage of highways and walks, was noted as a topic kindred to our\r\nsubject, although belonging more properly perhaps, to the drainage of\r\ntowns and to landscape-gardening, than to farm drainage. This, too, was\r\nfound to be beyond the scope of our proposed treatise, and has been left\r\nto some abler hand.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the whole subject of reclaiming lands from the sea, and from\r\nrivers, by embankment, and the drainage of lakes and ponds, which at a\r\nfuture day must attract great attention in this country, has proved\r\nquite too extensive to be treated here. The day will soon come, when on\r\nour Atlantic coast, the ocean waves will be stayed, and all along our\r\ngreat rivers, the Spring floods, and the Summer freshets, will be held\r\nwithin artificial barriers, and the enclosed lands be kept dry by\r\nengines propelled by steam, or some more efficient or economical agent.\r\n\r\nThe half million acres of fen-land in Lincolnshire, producing the\r\nheaviest wheat crops in England; and Harlaem Lake, in Holland, with its\r\n40,000 acres of fertile land, far below the tides, and once covered with\r\nmany feet of water, are examples of what science and well-directed labor\r\nmay accomplish. But this department of drainage demands the skill of\r\nscientific engineers, and the employment of combined capital and effort,\r\nbeyond the means of American farmers; and had we ability to treat it\r\nproperly, would afford matter rather of pleasing speculation, than of\r\npractical utility to agricultural readers.\r\n\r\nWith a reckless expenditure of paper and ink, we had already prepared\r\nchapters upon several topics, which, though not essential to\r\nfarm-drainage, were as near to our subject as the minister usually is\r\nlimited in preaching, or the lawyer in argument; but conformity to the\r\nProcrustean bed, in whose sheets we had in advance stipulated to\r\n_sleep_, cost us the amputation of a few of our least important heads.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too English,\" suggests a very wise and politic friend. We are\r\nfully aware of the prejudice which still exists in many minds in our\r\ncountry, against what is peculiarly English. Because, forsooth, our good\r\nMother England, towards a century ago, like most fond mothers, thought\r\nher transatlantic daughter quite too young and inexperienced to set up\r\nan establishment and manage it for herself, and drove her into wasteful\r\nexperiments of wholesale tea-making in Boston harbor, by way of\r\nillustrating her capacity of entertaining company from beyond seas; and\r\nbecause, near half a century ago, we had some sharp words, spoken not\r\nthrough the mouths of prophets and sages, but through the mouths of\r\ngreat guns, touching the right of our venerated parent to examine the\r\ninternal economy of our merchant-ships on the sea--because of\r\nreminiscences like these, we are to forswear all that is English! And so\r\nwe may claim no kindred in literature with Shakspeare and Milton, in\r\njurisprudence, with Bacon and Mansfield, in statesmanship, with Pitt and\r\nFox!\r\n\r\nWhence came the spirit of independence, the fearless love of liberty of\r\nwhich we boast, but from our English blood? Whence came our love of\r\nterritorial extension, our national ambition, exhibited under the\r\naffectionate name of annexation? Does not this velvet paw with which we\r\nsoftly play with our neighbors' heads, conceal some long, crooked\r\ntalons, which tell of the ancestral blood of the British Lion?\r\n\r\nThe legislature of a New England State, not many years ago, appointed a\r\ncommittee to revise its statutes. This committee had a pious horror of\r\nall dead languages, and a patriotic fear of paying too high a compliment\r\nto England, and so reported that all proceedings in courts of law should\r\nbe in the American language! An inquiry by a waggish member, whether the\r\ncommittee intended to allow proceedings to be in any one of the three\r\nhundred Indian dialects, restored to the English language its\r\nappropriate name.\r\n\r\nThough from some of our national traits, we might possibly be supposed\r\nto have sprung from the sowing of the dragon's teeth by Cadmus, yet the\r\nuniform record of all American families which goes back to the \"three\r\nbrothers who came over from England,\" contradicts this theory, and\r\nconnects us by blood and lineage with that country.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we can hardly consent to sell our birthright for so poor a mess\r\nof pottage as this petty jealousy offers. A teachable spirit in matters\r\nof which we are ignorant, is usually as profitable and respectable as\r\nabundant self-conceit, and rendering to Cæsar the things that are\r\nCæsar's, quite as honest as to pocket the coin as our own,\r\nnotwithstanding the \"image and superscription.\"\r\n\r\nWe make frequent reference to English writers and to English opinions\r\nupon our subject, because drainage is understood and practiced better in\r\nEngland than anywhere else in the world, and because by personal\r\ninspection of drainage-works there, and personal acquaintance and\r\ncorrespondence with some of the most successful drainers in that\r\ncountry, we feel some confidence of ability to apply English principles\r\nto American soil and climate.\r\n\r\nTo J. Bailey Denton, Engineer of the General Land Drainage Company, and\r\none of the most distinguished practical and scientific drainers in\r\nEngland, we wish publicly to acknowledge our obligations for personal\r\nfavors shown us in the preparation of our work.\r\n\r\nWe claim no great praise of originality in what is here offered to the\r\npublic. Wherever we have found a person of whom we could learn anything,\r\nin this or other countries, we have endeavored to profit by his\r\nteachings, and whenever the language of another, in book or journal, has\r\nbeen found to express forcibly an idea which we deemed worthy of\r\nadoption, we have given full credit for both thought and words.\r\n\r\nOur friends, Messrs. Shedd and Edson, of Boston, whose experience as\r\ndraining engineers entitles them to a high rank among American\r\nauthorities, have been in constant communication with us, throughout our\r\nlabors. The chapter upon Evaporation, Rain fall, &c., which we deem of\r\ngreat value as a contribution to science in general, will be seen to be\r\nin part credited to them, as are also the tables showing the discharge\r\nof water through pipes of various capacity.\r\n\r\nDrainage is a new subject in America, not well understood, and we have\r\nno man, it is believed, peculiarly fitted to teach its theory and\r\npractice; yet the farmers everywhere are awake to its importance, and\r\nare eagerly seeking for information on the subject. Many are already\r\nengaged in the endeavor to drain their lands, conscious of their want of\r\nthe requisite knowledge to effect their object in a profitable manner,\r\nwhile others are going resolutely forward, in violation of all correct\r\nprinciples, wasting their labor, unconscious even of their ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn New England, we have determined to dry the springy hill sides, and so\r\nlengthen our seasons for labor; we have found, too, in the valleys and\r\nswamps, the soil which has been washed from our mountains, and intend to\r\navail ourselves of its fertility in the best manner practicable. On the\r\nprairies of the great West, large tracts are found just a little too wet\r\nfor the best crops of corn and wheat, and the inquiry is anxiously made,\r\nhow can we be rid of this surplus water.\r\n\r\nThere is no treatise, English or American, which meets the wants of our\r\npeople. In England, it is true, land drainage is already reduced to a\r\nscience; but their system has grown up by degrees, the first principles\r\nbeing now too familiar to be at all discussed, and the points now in\r\ncontroversy there, quite beyond the comprehension of beginners. America\r\nwants a treatise which shall be elementary, as well as thorough--that\r\nshall teach the alphabet, as well as the transcendentalism, of draining\r\nland--that shall tell the man who never saw a drain-tile what thorough\r\ndrainage is, and shall also suggest to those who have studied the\r\nsubject in English books only, the differences in climate and soil, in\r\nthe prices of labor and of products, which must modify our operations.\r\n\r\nWith some practical experience on his own land, with careful observation\r\nin Europe and in America of the details of drainage operations, with a\r\nsomewhat critical examination of published books and papers on all\r\ntopics connected with the general subject, the author has endeavored to\r\nturn the leisure hours of a laborious professional life to some account\r\nfor the farmer. Although, as the lawyers say, the \"presumptions\" are,\r\nperhaps, strongly against the idea, yet a professional man _may_\r\nunderstand practical farming. The profession of the law has made some\r\nvaluable contributions to agricultural literature. Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert, author of the \"Boke of Husbandrie,\" published in 1523, was\r\nChief Justice of the Common Pleas, and, as he says, an \"_experyenced\r\nfarmer_ of more than 40 years.\" The author of that charming little book,\r\n\"Talpa,\" it is said, is also a lawyer, and there is such wisdom in the\r\nidea, so well expressed by Emerson as a fact, that we commend it by way\r\nof consolation to men of all the learned professions: \"All of us keep\r\nthe farm in reserve, as an asylum where to hide our poverty and our\r\nsolitude, if we do not succeed in society.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the prejudice against what is foreign, we meet everywhere the\r\nprejudice against what is new, though far less in this country than in\r\nEngland. \"No longer ago than 1835,\" says the _Quarterly Review_, \"Sir\r\nRobert Peel presented a Farmers' Club, at Tamworth, with two iron plows\r\nof the best construction. On his next visit, the old plows, with the\r\nwooden mould-boards, were again at work. 'Sir,' said a member of the\r\nclub, 'we tried the iron, and we be all of one mind, that they make the\r\nweeds grow!'\"\r\n\r\nAmerican farmers have no such ignorant prejudice as this. They err\r\nrather by having too much faith in themselves, than by having too little\r\nin the idea of progress, and will be more likely to \"go ahead\" in the\r\nwrong direction, than to remain quiet in their old position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE ART OF DRAINING.\r\n\r\n     Draining as Old as the Deluge.--Roman Authors.--Walter Bligh in\r\n     1650.--No thorough drainage till Smith of Deanston.--No mention of\r\n     tiles in the \"Compleat Body of Husbandry,\" 1758.--Tiles found 100\r\n     years old.--Elkington's System.--Johnstone's Puns and\r\n     Peripatetics.--Draining Springs.--Bletonism, or the Faculty of\r\n     Perceiving Subterranean Water.--Deanston System.--Views of Mr.\r\n     Parkes.--Keythorpe System.--Wharncliffe System.--Introduction of\r\n     tiles into America.--John Johnston, and Mr. Delafield, of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of removing superfluous water from land, must be as ancient as\r\nthe art of cultivation; and from the time when Noah and his family\r\nanxiously watched the subsiding of the waters into their appropriate\r\nchannels, to the present, men must have felt the ill effects of too much\r\nwater, and adopted means more or less effective, to remove it.\r\n\r\nThe Roman writers upon agriculture, Cato, Columella, and Pliny, all\r\nmention draining, and some of them give minute directions for forming\r\ndrains with stones, branches of trees, and straw. Palladius, in his _De\r\nAquæ Ductibus_, mentions earthen-ware tubes, used however for aqueducts,\r\nrather for conveying water from place to place, than for draining lands\r\nfor agriculture.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, like the systematic drainage of the present day, seems\r\nto have been conceived of in England, until about 1650, when Captain\r\nWalter Bligh published a work, which is interesting, as embodying and\r\nboldly advocating the theory of deep-drainage as applied by him to\r\nwater-meadows and swamps, and as applicable to the drainage of all other\r\nmoist lands.\r\n\r\nWe give from the 7th volume of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety, in the language of that eminent advocate of deep-drainage,\r\nJosiah Parkes, an account of this rare book, and of the principles which\r\nit advocates, as a fitting introduction to the more modern and more\r\nperfect system of thorough drainage:\r\n\r\n     \"The author of this work was a Captain Walter Bligh, signing\r\n     himself, 'A Lover of Ingenuity.' It is quaintly entitled, 'The\r\n     English Improver Improved; or, the Survey of Husbandry Surveyed;'\r\n     with several prefaces, but specially addressed to 'The Right\r\n     Honorable the Lord General Cromwell, and the Right Honorable the\r\n     Lord President, and the rest of the Honorable Society of the\r\n     Council of State.' In his instructions for forming the flooding and\r\n     draining trenches of water-meadows, the author says of the\r\n     latter:--'And for thy drayning-trench, it must be made so deep,\r\n     that it goe to the bottom of the cold spewing moyst water, that\r\n     feeds the flagg and the rush; for the widenesse of it, use thine\r\n     own liberty, but be sure to make it so wide as thou mayest goe to\r\n     the bottom of it, which must be so low as any moysture lyeth, which\r\n     moysture usually lyeth under the over and second swarth of the\r\n     earth, in some gravel or sand, or else, where some greater stones\r\n     are mixt with clay, under which thou must goe half one spade's\r\n     graft deep at least. Yea, suppose this corruption that feeds and\r\n     nourisheth the rush or flagg, should lie a yard or four-foot deepe;\r\n     to the bottom of it thou must goe, if ever thou wilt drayn it to\r\n     purpose, or make the utmost advantage of either floating or\r\n     drayning, without which the water cannot have its kindly operation;\r\n     for though the water fatten naturally, yet still this coldnesse and\r\n     moysture lies gnawing within, and not being taken clean away, it\r\n     eates out what the water fattens; and so the goodnesse of the water\r\n     is, as it were, riddled, screened, and strained out into the land,\r\n     leaving the richnesse and the leanesse sliding away from it.' In\r\n     another place, he replies to the objectors of floating, that it\r\n     will breed the rush, the flagg, and mare-blab; 'only make thy\r\n     drayning-trenches deep enough, and not too far off thy floating\r\n     course, and I'le warrant it they drayn away that under-moysture,\r\n     fylth, and venom as aforesaid, that maintains them; and then\r\n     believe me, or deny Scripture, which I hope thou doust not, as\r\n     Bildad said unto Job, \"Can the rush grow without mire, or the flagg\r\n     without water?\" Job viii. 12. That interrogation plainly showes\r\n     that the rush cannot grow, the water being taken from the root; for\r\n     it is not the moystnesse upon the surface of the land, for then\r\n     every shower should increase the rush, but it is that which lieth\r\n     at the root, which, drayned away at the bottom, leaves it naked and\r\n     barren of relief.'\r\n\r\n     \"The author frequently returns to this charge, explaining over and\r\n     over again the necessity of removing what we call bottom-water, and\r\n     which he well designates as 'filth and venom.'\r\n\r\n     \"In the course of my operations as a drainer, I have met with, or\r\n     heard of, so many instances of swamp-drainage, executed precisely\r\n     according to the plans of this author, and sometimes in a superior\r\n     manner--the conduits being formed of walling stone, at a period\r\n     long antecedent to the memory of the living--that I am disposed to\r\n     consider the practice of deep drainage to have originated with\r\n     Captain Bligh, and to have been preserved by imitators in various\r\n     parts of the country; since a book, which passed through three\r\n     editions in the time of the Commonwealth, must necessarily have had\r\n     an extensive circulation, and enjoyed a high renown. Several\r\n     complimentary autograph verses, written by some imitators and\r\n     admirers of the ingenious Bligh, are bound up with the volume. I\r\n     find also, not unfrequently, very ancient deep drains in arable\r\n     fields, and some of them still in good condition; and in a case or\r\n     two, I have met with several ancient drains six feet deep, placed\r\n     parallel with each other, but at so great a distance asunder, as\r\n     not to have commanded a perfect drainage of the intermediate space.\r\n     The author from whom I have so largely quoted, is the earliest\r\n     known to me, who has had the sagacity to distinguish between the\r\n     transient effect of rain, and the constant action of stagnant\r\n     bottom-water in maintaining land in a wet condition.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Shier, editor of \"Davy's Agricultural Chemistry,\" says, \"The history\r\nof drainage in Britain may be briefly told. Till the time of Smith, of\r\nDeanston, draining was generally regarded as the means of freeing the\r\nland from springs, oozes, and under-water, and it was applied only to\r\nlands palpably wet, and producing rushes and other aquatic plants.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to give the principles of Elkington, Smith, Parkes, and\r\nother modern writers, of which we shall speak more at large.\r\n\r\nThe work published in England, not far from Captain Bligh's time, under\r\nthe title \"A Complete Body of Husbandry,\" undertakes to give directions\r\nfor all sorts of farming processes. A Second Edition, in four octavo\r\nvolumes, of which we have a copy, was published in 1758. It professes to\r\ntreat of \"Draining in General,\" and then of the draining of boggy land\r\nand of fens, but gives no intimation that any other lands require\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nDirections are given for filling drains with \"rough stones,\" to be\r\ncovered with refuse wood, and over that, some of the earth that was\r\nthrown out in digging. \"By this means,\" says the writer, \"a passage will\r\nbe left free for all the water the springs yield, and there will be none\r\nof these great openings upon the surface.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus describes a method practiced in Oxfordshire of draining with\r\nbushes:\r\n\r\n     \"Let the trenches be cut deeper than otherwise, suppose three foot\r\n     deep, and two foot over. As soon as they are made, let the bottoms\r\n     of them be covered with fresh-cut blackthorn bushes. Upon these,\r\n     throw in a quantity of large refuse stones; over these let there be\r\n     another covering of straw, and upon this, some of the earth, so as\r\n     to make the surface level with the rest. These trenches will always\r\n     keep open.\"\r\n\r\nNo mention whatever is made in this elaborate treatise of tiles of any\r\nkind, which affords very strong evidence that they were not in use for\r\ndrainage at that time. In a note, however, to Stephen's \"Draining and\r\nIrrigation,\" we find the following statement and opinion:\r\n\r\n     \"In draining the park at Grimsthorpe, Lincolnshire, about three\r\n     years ago, some drains, made with tiles, were found eight feet\r\n     below the surface of the ground. The tiles were similar to what are\r\n     now used, and in as good a state of preservation as when first\r\n     laid, although they must have remained there above one hundred\r\n     years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nELKINGTON'S SYSTEM OF DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nIt appears, that, in 1795, the British Parliament, at the request of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture, voted to Joseph Elkington a reward of £1000, for\r\nhis valuable discoveries in the drainage of land. Joseph Elkington was a\r\nWarwickshire farmer, and Mr. Gisborne says he was a man of considerable\r\ngenius, but he had the misfortune to be illiterate. His discovery had\r\ncreated such a sensation in the agricultural world, that it was thought\r\nimportant to record its details; and, as Elkington's health was\r\nextremely precarious, the Board resolved to send Mr. John Johnstone to\r\nvisit, in company with him, his principal works of drainage, and to\r\ntransmit to posterity the benefits of his knowledge.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mr. John Johnstone, having carefully studied Elkington's\r\nsystem, under its author, in the peripatetic method, undertook, like\r\nPlato, to record the sayings of his master in science, and produced a\r\nwork, entitled, \"An Account of the Most Approved Mode of Draining Land,\r\nAccording to the System Practised by Mr. Joseph Elkington.\" It was\r\npublished at Edinburgh, in 1797. Mr. Gisborne says, that Elkington found\r\nin Johnstone \"a very inefficient exponent of his opinions, and of the\r\nprinciples on which he conducted his works.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Every one,\" says he, \"who reads the work, which is popularly\r\n     called 'Elkington on Draining,' should be aware, that it is not\r\n     Joseph who thinks and speaks therein, but John, who tells his\r\n     readers what, according to his ideas, Joseph would have thought and\r\n     spoken.\"\r\n\r\nAgain--\r\n\r\n     \"Johnstone, measured by general capacity, is a very shallow\r\n     drainer! He delights in exceptional cases, of which he may have met\r\n     with some, but of which, we suspect the great majority to be\r\n     products of his own ingenuity, and to be put forward, with a view\r\n     to display the ability with which he could encounter them.\"\r\n\r\nJohnstone's report seems to have undergone several revisions, and to\r\nhave been enlarged and reproduced in other forms than the original, for\r\nwe find, that, in 1838, it was published in the United States, at\r\nPetersburg, Virginia, as a supplement to the _Farmer's Register_, by\r\nEdmund Ruffin, Esq., editor, a reprint \"from the third British Edition,\r\nrevised and enlarged,\" under the following title:\r\n\r\n     \"A Systematic Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Draining Land,\r\n     &c., according to the most approved methods, and adapted to the\r\n     various situations and soils of England and Scotland; also on sea,\r\n     river, and lake embankments, formation of ponds and artificial\r\n     pieces of water, with an appendix, containing hints and directions\r\n     for the culture and improvement of bog, morass, moor, and other\r\n     unproductive ground, after being drained; the whole illustrated by\r\n     plans and sections applicable to the various situations and forms\r\n     of construction. Inscribed to the Highland and Agricultural Society\r\n     of Scotland, by John Johnstone, Land Surveyor.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ruffin certainly deserves great credit for his enterprise in\r\nrepublishing in America, at so early a day, a work of which an English\r\ncopy could not be purchased for less than six dollars, as well as for\r\nhis zealous labors ever since in the cause of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere is, in this work of Johnstone, a quaintness which he, probably,\r\ndid not learn from Elkington, and which illustrates the character of his\r\nmind as one not peculiarly adapted to a plain and practical history of\r\nanother man's system and labors. For instance, in speaking of the\r\narrangement of his subject into parts, he says, in a note, \"The subject\r\nbeing closely connected with _cutting_, _section_ is held as a better\r\n_division_ than chapter!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he speaks of embanking, and says he has some experience on that\r\nhead. Then he adds the following note, lest a possible pun should be\r\nlost: \"An embankment is often termed a 'head,' as it makes head, or\r\nresistance, against the encroachment of high tide or river floods.\"\r\n\r\nThere is some danger that a mind which scents a whimsical analogy of\r\nmeaning like this, may entirely lose the main track of pursuit; but\r\nJohnstone's special mission was to ascertain Elkington's method, and\r\nhis account of it is, therefore, the best authority we have on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHe gives the following statement of Elkington's discovery:\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1763, Elkington was left by his father in the\r\n     possession of a farm called Prince-Thorp, in the parish of\r\n     Stretton-upon-Dunsmore, and county of Warwick. The soil of this\r\n     farm was so poor, and, in many places, so extremely wet, that it\r\n     was the cause of rotting several hundreds of his sheep, which first\r\n     induced him, if possible, to drain it. This he begun to do, in\r\n     1764, in a field of wet clay soil, rendered almost a swamp, or\r\n     _shaking_ bog, by the springs which issued from an adjoining bank\r\n     of gravel and sand, and overflowed the surface of the ground below.\r\n     To drain this field, which was of considerable extent, he cut a\r\n     trench about four or five feet deep, a little below the upper side\r\n     of the bog, where the wetness began to make its appearance; and,\r\n     after proceeding with it in this direction and at this depth, he\r\n     found it did not reach the _principal body of subjacent water_ from\r\n     which the evil arose. On perceiving this, he was at a loss how to\r\n     proceed, when one of his servants came to the field with an _iron\r\n     crow_, or bar, for the purpose of making holes for fixing sheep\r\n     hurdles in an adjoining part of the farm, as represented on the\r\n     plan. Having a suspicion that his drain was not deep enough, and\r\n     desirous to know what strata lay under it, he took the iron bar,\r\n     and having forced it down about four feet below the bottom of the\r\n     trench, on pulling it out, to his astonishment, a great quantity of\r\n     water burst up through the hole he had thus made, and ran along the\r\n     drain. This led him to the knowledge, that wetness may be often\r\n     produced by water confined farther below the surface of the ground\r\n     than it was possible for the usual depth of drains to reach, and\r\n     that an _auger_ would be a useful instrument to apply in such\r\n     cases. Thus, chance was the parent of this discovery, as she often\r\n     is of other useful arts; and fortunate it is for society, when such\r\n     accidents happen to those who have sense and judgment to avail\r\n     themselves of hints thus fortuitously given. In this manner he soon\r\n     accomplished the drainage of his whole farm, and rendered it so\r\n     perfectly dry and sound, that none of his flock was ever after\r\n     affected with disease.\r\n\r\n     \"By the success of this experiment, Mr. Elkington's fame, as a\r\n     drainer, was quickly and widely extended; and, after having\r\n     successfully drained several farms in his neighborhood, he was, at\r\n     last, very generally employed for that purpose in various parts of\r\n     the kingdom, till about thirty years ago, when the country had the\r\n     melancholy cause to regret his loss. From his long practice and\r\n     experience, he became so successful in the works he undertook, and\r\n     so skillful in judging of the internal strata of the earth and the\r\n     nature of springs, that, with remarkable precision, he could\r\n     ascertain where to find water, and trace the course of springs that\r\n     made no appearance on the surface of the ground. During his\r\n     practice of more than thirty years, he drained in various parts of\r\n     England, particularly in the midland counties, many thousand acres\r\n     of land, which, from being originally of little or no value, soon\r\n     became as useful as any in the kingdom, by producing the most\r\n     valuable kinds of grain and feeding the best and healthiest species\r\n     of stock.\r\n\r\n     \"Many have erroneously entertained an idea that Elkington's skill\r\n     lay solely in applying the auger for the _tapping of springs_,\r\n     without attaching any merit to his method of conducting the drains.\r\n     The accidental circumstance above stated gave him the first notion\r\n     of using an auger, and directed his attention to the profession and\r\n     practice of draining, in the course of which he made various useful\r\n     discoveries, as will be afterwards explained. With regard to the\r\n     use of the auger, though there is every reason to believe that he\r\n     was led to employ that instrument from the circumstance already\r\n     stated, and did not derive it from any other source of\r\n     intelligence, yet there is no doubt that others might have hit upon\r\n     the same idea without being indebted for it to him. It has\r\n     happened, that, in attempts to discover mines by boring, springs\r\n     have been tapped, and ground thereby drained, either by letting the\r\n     water down, or by giving it vent to the surface; and that the auger\r\n     has been likewise used in bringing up water in wells, to save the\r\n     expense of deeper digging; but that it had been _used in draining\r\n     land, before Mr. Elkington made that discovery, no one has ventured\r\n     to assert_.\"\r\n\r\nBegging pardon of the shade of John Johnstone for the liberty, we will\r\ncopy from Mr. Gisborne, as being more clearly expressed, a summary\r\nexplanation of Elkington's system, as Mr. Gisborne has deduced it from\r\nJohnstone's report, with two simple and excellent plans:\r\n\r\n     \"A slight modification of Johnstone's best and simplest plan, with\r\n     a few sentences of explanation, will sufficiently elucidate\r\n     Elkington's mystery, and will comprehend the case of all simple\r\n     superficial springs. Perhaps in Agricultural Britain, no formation\r\n     is more common than moderate elevations of pervious material, such\r\n     as chalk, gravel, and imperfect stone or rock of various kinds,\r\n     resting upon more horizontal beds of clay, or other material less\r\n     pervious than themselves, and at their inferior edge overlapped by\r\n     it. For this overlap geological reasons are given, into which we\r\n     cannot now enter. In order to make our explanation simple, we use\r\n     the words, gravel and clay, as generic for pervious and impervious\r\n     material.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n     \"Our drawing is an attempt to combine plan and section, which will\r\n     probably be sufficiently illustrative. From A to T is the overlap,\r\n     which is, in fact, a dam holding up the water in the gravel. In\r\n     this dam there is a weak place at S, through which water issues\r\n     permanently (a superficial spring), and runs over the surface from\r\n     S to O. This issue has a tendency to lower the water in the gravel\r\n     to the line M _m_. But when continued rains overpower this issue,\r\n     the water in the gravel rises to the line A _a_, and meeting with\r\n     no impediment at the point A, it flows over the surface between A\r\n     and S. In addition to these more decided outlets, the water is\r\n     probably constantly squeezing, in a slow way, through the whole\r\n     dam. Elkington undertakes to drain the surface from A to O. He cuts\r\n     a drain from O to B, and then he puts down a bore-hole, an Artesian\r\n     well, from B to Z. His hole enters the tail of the gravel; the\r\n     water contained therein rises up it: and the tendency of this new\r\n     outlet is to lower the water to the line B _b_. If so lowered that\r\n     it can no longer overflow at A or at S, and the surface from A to O\r\n     is drained, so far as the springs are concerned, though our section\r\n     can only represent one spring, and one summit-overflow, it is\r\n     manifest that, however long the horizontal line of junction between\r\n     the gravel and clay may be, however numerous the weak places\r\n     (springs) in the overlap, or dam, and the summit-overflows, they\r\n     will all be stopped, provided they lie at a higher level than the\r\n     line B _b_. If Elkington had driven his drain forward from B to\r\n     _n_, he would, at least, equally have attained his object; but the\r\n     bore-hole was less expensive. He escapes the deepest and most\r\n     costly portion of his drain. At _x_, he might have bored to the\r\n     centre of the earth without ever realizing the water in this\r\n     gravel. His whole success, therefore, depended upon his sagacity in\r\n     hitting the point Z. Another simple and very common case, first\r\n     successfully treated by Elkington, is illustrated by our second\r\n     drawing.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n     \"Between gravel hills lies a dish-shaped bed of clay, the gravel\r\n     being continuous under the dish. Springs overflow at A and B, and\r\n     wet the surface from A to O, and from B to O. O D is a drain four\r\n     or five feet deep, and having an adequate outlet; D Z a bore-hole.\r\n     The water in the gravel rises from Z to D, and is lowered to the\r\n     level D _m_ and D _n_. Of course it ceases to flow over at A and B.\r\n     If Elkington's heart had failed him when he reached X, he would\r\n     have done no good. All his success depends on his reaching Z,\r\n     however deep it may lie. Elkington was a discoverer. We do not at\r\n     all believe that his discoveries hinged on the accident that the\r\n     shepherd walked across the field with a crow-bar in his hand. When\r\n     he forced down that crow-bar, he had more in his head than was ever\r\n     dreamed of in Johnstone's philosophy. Such accidents do not happen\r\n     to ordinary men. Elkington's subsequent use of his discovery, in\r\n     which no one has yet excelled him, warrants our supposition that\r\n     the discovery was not accidental. He was not one of those prophets\r\n     who are without honor in their own country: he created an immense\r\n     sensation, and received a parliamentary grant of one thousand\r\n     pounds. One writer compares his auger to Moses' rod, and Arthur\r\n     Young speculates, whether though worthy to be rewarded by millers\r\n     on one side of the hill for increasing their stream, he was not\r\n     liable to an action by those on the other for diminishing theirs.\"\r\n\r\nJohnstone sums up this system as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Draining according to Elkington's principles depends chiefly upon\r\n     three things:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Upon discovering the main spring, or source of the evil.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Upon taking the subterraneous bearings: and,\r\n\r\n     \"3dly. By making use of the auger to reach and _tap_ the springs,\r\n     when the depth of the drain is not sufficient for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     \"The first thing, therefore, to be observed is, by examining the\r\n     adjoining high grounds, to discover what strata they are composed\r\n     of; and then to ascertain, as nearly as possible, the inclination\r\n     of these strata, and their connection with the ground to be\r\n     drained, and thereby to judge at what place the level of the spring\r\n     comes nearest to where the water can be cut off, and most readily\r\n     discharged. The surest way of ascertaining the lay, or inclination,\r\n     of the different strata, is, by examining the bed of the nearest\r\n     streams, and the edges of the banks that are cut through by the\r\n     water; and any pits, wells, or quarries that may be in the\r\n     neighborhood. After the _main spring_ has been thus discovered, the\r\n     next thing is, to ascertain a line on the same level, to one or\r\n     both sides of it, in which the drain may be conducted, which is one\r\n     of the most important parts of the operation, and one on which the\r\n     art of draining in a scientific manner essentially depends.\r\n\r\n     \"Lastly, the use of the auger, which, in many cases, is the _sine\r\n     qua non_ of the business, is to reach and tap the spring when the\r\n     depth of the drain does not reach it: where the level of the outlet\r\n     will not admit of its being cut to a greater depth; and where the\r\n     expense of such cutting would be great, and the execution of it\r\n     difficult.\r\n\r\n     \"According to these principles, this system of draining has been\r\n     attended with extraordinary consequences, not only in laying the\r\n     land dry in the vicinity of the drain, but also springs, wells, and\r\n     wet ground, at a considerable distance, with which there was no\r\n     apparent connection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nWherever, from any cause, water bursts out from a hill's side, or from\r\nbelow, in a well defined spring, in any considerable quantity, the\r\nElkington method of cutting a deep drain directly into the seat of the\r\nevil, and so lowering the water that it may be carried away below the\r\nsurface, is obviously the true and common-sense remedy. There may be\r\ncases where, in addition to the drain, it may be expedient to bore with\r\nan auger in the course of the drain. This, however, would be useful only\r\nwhere, from the peculiar formation, water is pent up upon a retentive\r\nsubsoil in the manner already indicated. Elkington's method of draining\r\nby boring is illustrated in the following cut.\r\n\r\nIn studying the history of Elkington's discovery, and especially of his\r\nown application of it, it would seem that he must have possessed some\r\npeculiar faculty of ascertaining the subterranean currents of water, not\r\npossessed or even claimed by modern engineers.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mr. Denton, who may rightly claim as much skill as a draining\r\nengineer, perhaps, as any man in England, expressly says, \"It does not\r\nappear that any person now will undertake to do what Elkington did sixty\r\nyears back.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the Patent Office Report for 1851, at page 14, may be found an\r\narticle entitled, \"Well-digging,\" in which it is gravely contended, and\r\nnot without a fair show of evidence, that certain persons possess the\r\npower of indicating, by means of a sort of divining rod of hazel or\r\nwillow, subterraneous currents or springs of water. This power has been\r\ncalled Bletonism, which is defined by Webster to be, \"the faculty of\r\nperceiving and indicating subterraneous springs and currents by\r\nsensation--so called from one Bleton, of France, who possessed this\r\nfaculty.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of Webster, and of Mr. Ewbank, the Commissioner of\r\nPatents, in whose report the article in question was published by the\r\nGovernment of the United States, it will not be considered, perhaps, as\r\nputting faith in \"water-witchery,\" to suggest that, possibly, Elkington\r\ndid really possess a faculty, not common to all mankind, of detecting\r\nrunning water or springs, even far below the surface. We have the high\r\nauthority of Tam o' Shanter for the opinion, that witches cannot cross a\r\nstream of water; for, when pursued by the \"hellish legion\" from\r\nKirk-Alloway, he put his \"gude mare Meg\" to do her \"speedy utmost\" for\r\nthe bridge of Doon, knowing that,\r\n\r\n    \"A running stream they darena cross.\"\r\n\r\nIf witches are thus affected by flowing water, there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that others, of peculiar organization, may possess some\r\nsensitiveness at its presence.\r\n\r\nIt would not, probably, be useful to pursue more into detail the method\r\nof Mr. Elkington. The general principles upon which he wrought have been\r\nsufficiently explained. The miracles performed under his system seem to\r\nhave ceased with his life, and, until we receive some new revelation as\r\nto the mode of finding the springs hidden in the earth, we must be\r\ncontent with the moderate results of a careful application of ordinary\r\nscience, and not be discouraged in our attempts to leave the earth the\r\nbetter for our having lived on it, if we do not, like Elkington, succeed\r\nin draining, by a single ditch and a few auger holes, sixty statute\r\nacres of land.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEANSTON SYSTEM; OR, FREQUENT DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nJames Smith, Esq., of Deanston, Sterlingshire, in Scotland, next after\r\nElkington, in point of time, is the prominent leader of drainage\r\noperations in Great Britain. His peculiar views came into general notice\r\nabout 1832, and, in 1844, we find published a seventh edition of his\r\n\"Remarks on Thorough Draining.\" Smith was a man of education, and seems\r\nto be, in fact, the first advocate of any system worthy the name of\r\nthorough drainage.\r\n\r\nInstead of the few very deep drains, cut with reference to particular\r\nsprings or sources of wetness, adopted by Elkington, Smith advocated and\r\npracticed a systematic operation over the whole field, at regular\r\ndistances and shallow depths. Smith states, that in Scotland, much more\r\ninjury arises from the retention of rain water, than from springs; while\r\nElkington's attention seems to have been especially directed to springs,\r\nas the source of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic views of Smith, of Deanston, as stated by Mr. Denton,\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n     \"1st. _Frequent_ drains at intervals of from ten to twenty-four\r\n     feet.\r\n\r\n     \"2nd. _Shallow_ depth--not exceeding thirty inches--designed for\r\n     the single purpose of freeing that depth of soil from stagnant and\r\n     injurious water.\r\n\r\n     \"3rd. '_Parallel drains at regular distances_ carried throughout\r\n     the whole field, without reference to the wet and dry appearance of\r\n     portions of the field,' in order 'to provide frequent opportunities\r\n     for the water, _rising from_ below and falling on the surface, to\r\n     pass freely and completely off.\r\n\r\n     \"4th. _Direction of the minor drains_ 'down the steep,' and that of\r\n     the mains along the bottom of the chief hollow; tributary mains\r\n     being provided for the lesser hollows.\r\n\r\n     \"The reason assigned for the minor drains following the line of\r\n     steepest descent, was, that 'the stratification generally lies in\r\n     sheets at an angle to the surface.'\r\n\r\n     \"5th. _As to material_--Stones preferred to tiles and pipes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith somewhat modified his views during the last years of his life,\r\nespecially as to the depth of drains, and, instead of shallow drains,\r\nrecommended a depth of three feet, and even more in some cases; but\r\ncontinued, to the time of his death, which occurred about 1854, to\r\noppose any increased intervals between the drains, and the extreme depth\r\nof four feet and more advocated by others. The peculiar points insisted\r\non by Smith were, that drains should be near and parallel. His own words\r\nare:\r\n\r\n     \"The drains should be parallel with each other and at regular\r\n     distances, and should be carried throughout the whole field,\r\n     without regard to the wet and dry appearance of portions of the\r\n     field--the principle of this system being the providing of frequent\r\n     opportunities for the water rising from below, or falling on the\r\n     surface, to pass freely and completely off.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith called it the \"frequent drain system,\" and Mr. Denton says,\r\nthat, \"for distinction sake, I have ventured to christen this ready-made\r\npractice, the _gridiron system_,\" a name, by the way, which will,\r\nprobably, seem to most readers more distinctive than respectful.\r\nWhatever may be the improvements on the Deanston method of draining, the\r\nname of Mr. Smith deserves, and, indeed, has already obtained, a high\r\nplace among the improvers of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF MR. PARKES.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1846, when the first Act of the British Parliament\r\nauthorizing \"the advance of public money to promote the improvement of\r\nland by works of drainage\" was passed, a careful investigation of the\r\nwhole subject was made by a Committee of the House of Lords, and it was\r\nfound that the best recorded opinions, if we except the peculiar views\r\nof Elkington, were represented by, if not merged into, those of Smith,\r\nof Deanston, which have already been stated, or those of Josiah Parkes.\r\nMr. Parkes is the author of \"Essays on the Philosophy and Art of Land\r\nDrainage,\" and of many valuable papers on the same subject, published in\r\nthe journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, of which he was\r\nconsulting engineer. He is spoken of by Mr. Denton as \"one whose\r\nphilosophical publications on the same subject gave a scientific bearing\r\nto it, quite irreconcilable with the more mechanical rules laid down by\r\nMr. Smith.\"\r\n\r\nThe characteristic views of Mr. Parkes, as set forth at that time, as\r\ncompared with those of Mr. Smith, are--\r\n\r\n     \"1st. _Less frequent drains_, at intervals varying from twenty-one\r\n     to fifty feet, _with preference for wide intervals_.\r\n\r\n     \"2nd. _Deeper drains at a minimum depth of four feet_, designed\r\n     with the two-fold object of not only freeing the active soil from\r\n     stagnant and injurious water, but of converting the water falling\r\n     on the surface into an agent for fertilizing; no drainage being\r\n     deemed efficient that did not both remove the water failing on the\r\n     surface, and 'keep down the subterranean water at a depth exceeding\r\n     the power of capillary attraction to elevate it to near the\r\n     surface.'\r\n\r\n     \"3rd. _Parallel arrangement of drains_, as advocated by Smith, of\r\n     Deanston.\r\n\r\n     \"4th. _The advantage of increased depth_, as compensating for\r\n     increased width between the drains.\r\n\r\n     \"5th. _Pipes of an inch bore, the 'best known conduit'_ for the\r\n     parallel drains. (See Evidence before Lords' Committee on Entailed\r\n     Estates, 1845, Q. 67.)\r\n\r\n     \"6th. _The cost of draining uniform clays should not exceed £3 per\r\n     acre._\"\r\n\r\nThe most material differences between the views of these two leaders of\r\nwhat have been deemed rival systems of drainage, will be seen to be the\r\nfollowing. Smith advocates drains of two to three feet in depth, at from\r\nten to twenty-four feet distances; while Parkes contends for a depth of\r\nnot less than four feet, with a width between of from twenty-one to\r\nfifty feet, the depth in some measure compensating for the increased\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes advocated the use of pipes of _one_ inch bore, which Mr.\r\nSmith contemptuously denominated \"pencil-cases,\" and which subsequent\r\nexperience has shown to be quite too small for prudent use.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of Mr. Parkes, based, in part, upon his wide distances and\r\nsmall pipes, that drainage might be effected generally in England at a\r\ncost of about fifteen dollars per acre, was soon found to be far below\r\nthe average expense, which is now estimated at nearly double that sum.\r\n\r\nThe Enclosure Commissioners, after the most careful inquiry, adopted\r\nfully the views of Mr. Parkes as to the _depth_ of drains. Mr. Parkes\r\nhimself, saw occasion to modify his ideas, as to the cost of drainage,\r\nupon further investigation of the subject, and fixed his estimates as\r\nranging from $15 to $30 per acre, according to soil and other local\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by a recent English writer, of Mr. Parkes:\r\n\r\n     \"That gentleman's services in the cause of drainage, have been\r\n     inestimable, and his high reputation will not be affected by any\r\n     remarks which experience may suggest with reference to details, so\r\n     long as the philosophical principles he first advanced in support\r\n     of deep drainage are acknowledged by thinking men. Mr. Parkes'\r\n     practice in 1854, will be found to differ very considerably from\r\n     his anticipations of 1845, but the influence of his earlier\r\n     writings and sayings continues to this day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KEYTHORPE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nLord Berners having adopted a method of drainage on his estate at\r\n_Keythorpe_, differing somewhat from any of the regular and more uniform\r\nmodes which have been considered, a sharp controversy as to its merits\r\nhas arisen, and still continues in England, which, like most\r\ncontroversies, may be of more advantage to others than to the parties\r\nimmediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Keythorpe system seems to have been invented by Mr.\r\nJoshua Trimmer, a distinguished geologist of England, who, about 1854,\r\nproduced a paper, which was published in the journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, on the \"Keythorpe System.\" He states that his own\r\ntheory was based entirely on his knowledge of the geological structure\r\nof the earth, which will be presently given in his own language, and\r\nthat he afterwards ascertained that Lord Berners, who had no special\r\ntheory to vindicate, had, by the \"tentative process,\" or in plain\r\nEnglish, by trying experiments, hit upon substantially the same system,\r\nand found it to work admirably.\r\n\r\nMost people in the United States have no idea of what it is to be\r\npatronized by a lord. In England, it is thought by many to be the thing\r\nneedful to the chance, even, of success of any new theory, and\r\naccordingly, Mr. Trimmer, without hesitation, availed himself of the\r\nprivilege of being patronized by Lord Berners; and the latter, before he\r\nwas aware of how much the agricultural world was indebted to him for his\r\nvaluable discoveries, suddenly found himself at the head of the\r\n\"Keythorpe System of Drainage.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship was probably as much surprised to ascertain that he had\r\nbeen working out a new system, as some man of whom we have heard, was,\r\nto learn that he had been speaking _prose_ all his life! At the call of\r\nthe public, however, his lordship at once gave to the world the facts in\r\nhis possession, making no claim to any great discovery, and leaving Mr.\r\nTrimmer to defend the new system as best he might. The latter, in one of\r\nhis pamphlets published in defence of the Keythorpe system, states its\r\nclaims as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The peculiarities of the Keythorpe system of draining consist in\r\n     this--that the parallel drains are not equidistant, and that they\r\n     cross the line of the greatest descent. The usual depth is three\r\n     and a half feet, but some are as deep as five and six feet. The\r\n     depth and width of interval are determined by digging trial-holes,\r\n     in order to ascertain not only the depth at which the bottom water\r\n     is reached, but the height to which the water rises in the holes,\r\n     and the distance at which a drain will lay the hole dry. In sinking\r\n     these holes, clay-banks are found with hollows or furrows between\r\n     them, which are filled with a more porous soil, as represented in\r\n     the annexed sectional diagram.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n     _a_ _a_ Trial-holes.\r\n         _b_ Clay-banks of lias or of boulder-clay.\r\n         _c_ A more porous warp-drift filling furrows between the\r\n             clay-banks.]\r\n\r\n     \"The next object is to connect these furrows by drains laid across\r\n     them. The result is, that as the furrows and ridges here run along\r\n     the fall of the ground, which I have observed to be the case\r\n     generally elsewhere, the sub-mains follow the fall, and the\r\n     parallel drains cross it obliquely.\r\n\r\n     \"The intervals between the parallel drains are irregular, varying,\r\n     in the same field, from 14 to 21, 31, and 59 feet. The distances\r\n     are determined by opening the diagonal drains at the greatest\r\n     distance from the trial-holes at which experience has taught the\r\n     practicability of its draining the hole. If it does not succeed in\r\n     accomplishing the object, another drain is opened in the interval.\r\n     It has been found, in many cases, that a drain crossing the\r\n     clay-banks and furrows takes the water from holes lying lower down\r\n     the hill; that is to say, it intercepts the water flowing to them\r\n     through these subterranean channels. The parallel drains, however,\r\n     are not invariably laid across the fall. The exceptions are on\r\n     ground where the fall is very slight, in which case they are laid\r\n     along the line of greatest descent. On such grounds there are few\r\n     or no clay-banks and furrows.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem highly probable that the mode of drainage adopted at\r\nKeythorpe, is indebted for its success at that place, to a geological\r\nformation not often met with. At a public discussion in England, Mr. T.\r\nScott, a gentleman of large experience in draining, stated that \"he\r\nnever, in his practice, had met with such a geological formation as was\r\nsaid to exist at Keythorpe, except in such large areas as to admit of\r\ntheir being drained in the usual _gridiron_ or parallel fashion.\"\r\n\r\nIt is claimed for this system by its advocates, that it is far cheaper\r\nthan any other, because drains are only laid in the places where, by\r\ncareful examination beforehand, by opening pits, they are found to be\r\nnecessary; and that is a great saving of expense, when compared with the\r\nsystem of laying the drains at equal distances and depths over the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAgainst what is urged as the Keythorpe system, several allegations are\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that it is in fact _no system_. Mr. Denton, having\r\ncarefully examined the Keythorpe estate, and the published statements of\r\nits owner, asserts, that the drains there laid have _no uniformity of\r\ndepth_--part of the tiles being laid but eighteen inches deep, and\r\nothers four feet and more, in the same field.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that there is _no uniformity as to direction_--part of the\r\ndrains being laid across the fall, and part with the fall, in the same\r\nfields--with no obvious reason for the difference of direction.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that there is _no uniformity as to materials_--a part of the\r\ndrains being wood, and a part tiles, in the same field.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is contended that there is no saving of expense in the\r\nKeythorpe draining, over the ordinary mode, when all points are\r\nconsidered, because the pretended saving is made by the use of wood,\r\nwhere true economy would require tiles, and shallow drains are used\r\nwhere deeper ones would in the end be cheaper.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this controversy, it is due to Lord Berners to say, that\r\nhe expressly disclaims any invention or novelty in his operations at\r\nKeythorpe.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, although a work at the present day which should pass\r\nover, without consideration, the claims of the Keythorpe system, would\r\nbe quite incomplete in its history of the subject, yet the facts\r\nelicited with regard to it are perhaps chiefly valuable, as tending to\r\nshow the danger of basing a general principle upon an isolated case.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the claims of that system--if such it may be\r\ncalled--may be valuable in America, where novelty is sure to attract, by\r\nshowing that one more form of error has already been tried and \"found\r\nwanting;\" and so save us the trouble of proving its inutility by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHARNCLIFFE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nLord Wharncliffe, with a view to effect adequate drainage at less\r\nexpense than is usual in thorough drainage, has adopted upon his estate\r\na sort of compromise system, which he has brought to the notice of the\r\npublic in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\nUpon Fontenelle's idea, that \"mankind only settle into the right course\r\nafter passing through and exhausting all the varieties of error,\" it is\r\nwell to advise our readers of this particular form of error also--to\r\nshow that it has already been tried--so that no patent of invention can\r\nbe claimed upon it by those perverse persons who are not satisfied\r\nwithout constant change, and who seem to imagine that the ten\r\ncommandments might be improved by a new edition.\r\n\r\nLord Wharncliffe states his principles as follows, and calls his method\r\nthe combined system of deep and shallow drainage:\r\n\r\n     \"In order to secure the full effect of thorough drainage in clays,\r\n     it is necessary that there should be not only well-laid conduits\r\n     for the water which reaches them, but also subsidiary passages\r\n     opened through the substance of the close subsoil, by means of\r\n     atmospheric heat, and the contraction which ensues from it. The\r\n     cracks and fissures which result from this action, are reckoned\r\n     upon as a certain and essential part of the process.\r\n\r\n     \"To give efficiency, therefore, to a system of deep drains beneath\r\n     a stiff clay, these natural channels are required. To produce them,\r\n     there must be a continued action of heat and evaporation. If we\r\n     draw off effectually and constantly the bottom water from beneath\r\n     the clay and from its substance, as far as it admits of\r\n     percolation, and by some other means provide a vent for the upper\r\n     water, which needs no more than this facility to run freely, there\r\n     seems good reason to suppose that the object may be completely\r\n     attained, and that we shall remove the moisture from both portions\r\n     as effectually as its quantity and the substance will permit.\r\n     Acting upon this view, then, after due consideration, I determined\r\n     to combine with the fundamental four-feet drains a system of\r\n     auxiliary ones of much less depth, which should do their work\r\n     above, and contribute their share to the wholesome discharge, while\r\n     the under-current from their more subterranean neighbors should be\r\n     steadily performing their more difficult duty.\r\n\r\n     \"I accomplished this, by placing my four-feet drains at a distance\r\n     of from eighteen to twenty yards apart, and then leading others\r\n     into them, sunk only to about two feet beneath the surface (which\r\n     appeared, upon consideration, to be sufficiently below any\r\n     conceivable depth of cultivation), and laying these at a distance\r\n     from each other of eight yards. These latter are laid at an acute\r\n     angle with the main-drains, and at their mouths are either\r\n     gradually sloped downwards to the lower level, or have a few loose\r\n     stones placed in the same intervals between the two, sufficient to\r\n     ensure the perpendicular descent of the upper stream through that\r\n     space, which can never exceed, or, indeed, strictly equal, the\r\n     additional two feet.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why this mode of drainage cannot be adopted in the\r\nnorthern part of the United States.\r\n\r\nFirst: The two-foot drains would be liable to be frozen up solid, every\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nSecondly: The subsoil plow, now coming into use among our best\r\ncultivators, runs to so great a depth as to be likely to entirely\r\ndestroy two-foot drains at the first operation, even if it were not\r\nintended to run the sub-soiler to a greater general depth than eighteen\r\ninches. Any one who has had experience in holding a subsoil-plow, must\r\nknow that it is an implement somewhat unmanageable, and liable to plunge\r\ndeep into soft spots like the covering over drains; so that no skill or\r\ncare could render its use safe over two-foot drains.\r\n\r\nThe history of drainage in America, is soon given. It begins here, as it\r\nmust begin everywhere, when practiced as a general system, with the\r\nintroduction of tiles.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, Mr. John Johnston, of Seneca County, New York, a Scotchman by\r\nbirth, imported from Scotland patterns of drain-tiles, and caused them\r\nto be made by hand-labor, and set the example of their use on his own\r\nfarm. The effects of Mr. Johnston's operations were so striking, that in\r\n1848, John Delafield, Esq., for a long time President of the Seneca\r\nCounty Agricultural Society, imported from England one of Scragg's\r\nPatent Tile machines. From that time, tile-draining in that county, and\r\nin the neighboring counties, has been diligently and profitably pursued.\r\nSeveral interesting statements of successful experiments by Mr.\r\nJohnston, Mr. Delafield, Mr. Theron G. Yeomans of Wayne County, and\r\nothers, have been published, from time to time, in the \"New York\r\nTransactions.\" Indeed, most of our information of experimental draining\r\nin this country, has come from that quarter.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnston, for more than twenty years, has made himself useful to the\r\ncountry, and at the same time gained a wide reputation for himself, by\r\noccasional publications on the subject of drainage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, his practical knowledge of agriculture, and\r\nespecially of the subject of drainage, has gained for him a competence\r\nfor his declining years. In this we rejoice; and trust that in these,\r\nhis latter years, he may be made ever to feel, that even they among us\r\nof the friends of agriculture who have not known him personally, are not\r\nunmindful of their obligations to him as the leader of a\r\nmost beneficent enterprise.\r\n\r\nTile-works have since been established at various places in New York, at\r\nseveral places in Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, and many other States.\r\nThe first drain-tiles used in New-Hampshire, were brought from Albany,\r\nin 1854, by Mr. William Conner, and used on his farm in Exeter, that\r\nyear; and the following year, the writer brought some from Albany, and\r\nlaid them on his farm, in the same town.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, tile-works were put in operation at Exeter; and some 40,000\r\ntiles were made that year.\r\n\r\nThe horse-shoe tiles, we understand, have been generally used in New\r\nYork. At Albany, and in Massachusetts, the sole-tile has been of late\r\nyears preferred. We cannot learn that cylindrical pipes have ever been\r\nmanufactured in this country until the Summer of 1858 when the engineers\r\nof the New York Central Park procured them to be made, and laid them,\r\nwith collars, in their drainage-works there. This is believed to be the\r\nfirst practical introduction into this country of round pipes and\r\ncollars, which are regarded in England as the most perfect means of\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nExperiments all over the country, in reclaiming bog-meadows, and in\r\ndraining wet lands with drains of stone and wood, have been attempted,\r\nwith various success.\r\n\r\nThose attempts we regard as merely efforts in the right direction, and\r\nrather as evidence of a general conviction of the want, by the American\r\nfarmer, of a cheap and efficient mode of drainage, than as an\r\nintroduction of a system of thorough drainage; for--as we think will\r\nappear in the course of this work--no system of drainage can be made\r\nsufficiently cheap and efficient for general adoption, with other\r\nmaterials than drain-tiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRAIN, EVAPORATION, AND FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n     Fertilizing Substances in Rain Water.--Amount of Rain Fall in\r\n     United States--in England.--Tables of Rain Fall.--Number of Rainy\r\n     Days, and Quantity of Rain each Month.--Snow, how Computed as\r\n     Water.--Proportion of Rain Evaporated.--What Quantity of Water Dry\r\n     Soil will Hold.--Dew Point.--How Evaporation Cools\r\n     Bodies.--Artificial Heat Underground.--Tables of Filtration and\r\n     Evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we usually regard drainage as a means of rendering land\r\nsufficiently dry for cultivation, that is by no means a comprehensive\r\nview of the objects of the operation.\r\n\r\nRain is the principal source of moisture, and a surplus of moisture is\r\nthe evil against which we contend in draining. But rain is also a\r\nprincipal source of fertility, not only because it affords the necessary\r\nmoisture to dissolve the elements of fertility already in the soil, but\r\nalso because it contains in itself, or brings with it from the\r\natmosphere, valuable fertilizing substances. In a learned article by Mr.\r\nCaird, in the Cyclopedia of Agriculture, on the Rotation of Crops, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"The surprising effects of a fallow, even when unaided by any\r\n     manure, has received some explanation by the recent discovery of\r\n     Mr. Barral, that rain-water contains within itself, and conveys\r\n     into the soil, fertilizing substances of the utmost importance,\r\n     equivalent, in a fall of rain of 24 inches per annum, to the\r\n     quantity of ammonia contained in 2 cwt. of Peruvian guano, with 150\r\n     lbs. of nitrogeneous matter besides, all suited to the nutrition of\r\n     our crops.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 42 inches of rain may be taken as a fair general average of the\r\nrain-fall in the United States. If this supplies as much ammonia to the\r\nsoil as 3 cwt. of Peruvian guano to the acre, which is considered a\r\nliberal manuring, and which is valuable principally for its ammonia, we\r\nat once see the importance of retaining the rain-water long enough upon\r\nour fields, at least, to rob it of its treasures. But rain-water has a\r\nfarther value than has yet been suggested:\r\n\r\n     \"Rain-water always contains in solution, air, carbonic acid, and\r\n     ammonia. The two first ingredients are among the most powerful\r\n     disintegrators of a soil. The oxygen of the air, and the carbonic\r\n     acid being both in a highly condensed form, by being dissolved,\r\n     possess very powerful affinities for the ingredients of the soil.\r\n     The oxygen attacks and oxydizes the iron; the carbonic acid seizing\r\n     the lime and potash and other alkaline ingredients of the soil,\r\n     produces a further disintegration, and renders available the\r\n     locked-up ingredients of this magazine of nutriment. Before these\r\n     can be used by plants, they must be rendered soluble; and this is\r\n     only affected by the free and renewed access of rain and air. The\r\n     ready passage of both of these, therefore, enables the soil to\r\n     yield up its concealed nutriment.\"\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the rains of heaven bring us not only water, but food\r\nfor our plants, and that, while we would remove by proper drainage the\r\nsurplus moisture, we should take care to first conduct it through the\r\nsoil far enough to fulfill its mission of fertility. We cannot suppose\r\nthat all rain-water brings to our fields precisely the same proportion\r\nof the elements of fertility, because the foreign properties with which\r\nit is charged, must continually vary with the condition of the\r\natmosphere through which it falls, whether it be the thick and murky\r\ncloud which overhangs the coal-burning city, or the transparent ether of\r\nthe mountain tops. We may see, too, by the tables, that the quantity of\r\nrain that falls, varies much, not only with the varying seasons of the\r\nyear, and with the different seasons of different years, but with the\r\ndistance from the equator, the diversity of mountain and river, and\r\nlake and wood, and especially with locality as to the ocean. Yet the\r\naverage results of nature's operations through a series of years, are\r\nstartlingly constant and uniform, and we may deduce from tables of\r\nrain-falls, as from bills of mortality and tables of longevity,\r\nconclusions almost as reliable as from mathematical premises.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain is generally increased by the locality of mountain\r\nranges. \"Thus, at the Edinburgh Water Company's works, on the Pentland\r\nHills, there fell in 1849, nearly twice as much rain as at Edinburgh,\r\nalthough the distance between the two places is only seven miles.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough a much greater quantity of rain falls in mountainous districts\r\n(within certain limits of elevation) than in the plains, yet a greater\r\nquantity of rain falls at the surface of the ground than at an elevation\r\nof a few hundred feet. Thus, from experiments which were carefully made\r\nat York, it was ascertained that there fell eight and a half inches more\r\nrain at the surface of the ground, in the course of twelve months, than\r\nat the top of the Minster, which is 212 feet high. Similar results have\r\nbeen obtained in many other places.\r\n\r\nSome observations upon this point may also be found in the Report of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution for 1855, at p. 210, given by Professor C. W.\r\nMorris, of New York.\r\n\r\nAgain, the evaporation from the surface of water being much greater than\r\nfrom the land, clouds that are wafted by the winds from the sea to the\r\nland, condense their vapor upon the colder hills and mountain sides, and\r\nyield rain, so that high lands near the sea or other large bodies of\r\nwater, from which the winds generally blow, have a greater proportion of\r\nrainy days and a greater fall of rain than lands more remote from water.\r\nThe annual rain-fall in the lake districts in Cumberland County, in\r\nEngland, sometimes amounts to more than 150 inches.\r\n\r\nWith a desire to contribute as much as possible to the stock of accurate\r\nknowledge on this subject, we availed ourselves of the kindly offered\r\nservices of our friends, Shedd and Edson, in preparing a carefully\r\nconsidered article upon a part of our general subject, which has much\r\nengaged their attention. Neither the article itself, nor the\r\nobservations of Dr. Hobbs, which form a part of its basis, has ever\r\nbefore been published, and we believe our pages cannot be better\r\noccupied than by giving them in the language of our friends:\r\n\r\n\"All vegetables, in the various stages of growth, require warmth, air,\r\nand moisture, to support life and health.\r\n\r\nBelow the surface of the ground there is a body of stagnant water,\r\nsometimes at a great depth, but in retentive soils usually within a foot\r\nor two of the surface. This stagnant water not only excludes the air,\r\nbut renders the soil much colder, and, being in itself of no benefit,\r\nwithout warmth and air, its removal to a greater depth is very\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the depth to which this water-table should be removed,\r\nand of the means of removing it, constitutes the science of draining,\r\nand in its discussion, a knowledge of the rain-fall, humidity of the\r\natmosphere, and amount of evaporation, is very important.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rain-fall, as shown by the hyetal, or rain-chart, of North\r\nAmerica, by Lorin Blodget, is thirty inches vertical depth in the basin\r\nof the great lakes; thirty-two inches on Lake Erie and Lake Champlain;\r\nthirty-six inches in the valley of the Hudson, on the head waters of the\r\nOhio, through the middle portions of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and\r\nwestern portion of North Carolina; forty inches in the extreme eastern\r\nand the northern portion of Maine, northern portions of New Hampshire\r\nand Vermont, south-eastern counties of Massachusetts, Central New York,\r\nnorth-east portion of Pennsylvania, south-east portion of New Jersey and\r\nDelaware; also, on a narrow belt running down from the western portion\r\nof Maryland, through Virginia and North Carolina, to the north-western\r\nportion of South Carolina; thence, up through the western portion of\r\nVirginia, north-east portion of Ohio, Northern Indiana and Illinois, to\r\nPrairie du Chien; forty-two inches on the east coast of Maine, Eastern\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and middle portion of\r\nMaryland; thence, on a narrow belt to South Carolina; thence, up through\r\nEastern Tennessee, through Central Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, to Iowa;\r\nthence, down through Western Missouri and Texas to the Gulf of Mexico;\r\nforty-five inches from Concord, New Hampshire, through Worcester, Mass.,\r\nWestern Connecticut, and the City of New York, to the Susquehanna River,\r\njust north of Maryland; also, at Richmond, Va., Raleigh, N. C., Augusta,\r\nGeo., Knoxville, Tenn., Indianopolis, Ind., Springfield, Ill., St.\r\nLouis, Mo.; thence, through Western Arkansas, across Red River to the\r\nGulf of Mexico. From the belt just described, the rain-fall increases\r\ninland and southward, until at Mobile, Ala., the rain-fall is\r\nsixty-three inches. The same amount also falls in the extreme southern\r\nportion of Florida.\r\n\r\nIn England, the average rain-fall in the eastern portion is represented\r\nat twenty inches; in the middle portion, twenty-two inches; in the\r\nsouthern and western, thirty inches; in the extreme south-western,\r\nforty-five inches; and in Wales, fifty inches. In the eastern portion of\r\nIreland, it is twenty-five inches; and in the western, forty inches.\r\n\r\nObservations at London for forty years, by Dalton, gave average fall of\r\n20.69 inches. Observations at New Bedford, Mass., for forty-three years,\r\nby S. Rodman, gave average fall of 41.03 inches--about double the amount\r\nin London. The mean quantity for each month, at both places, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                _New Bedford._        _London._\r\n\r\n    January         3.36                1.46\r\n    February        3.32                1.25\r\n    March           3.44                1.17\r\n    April           3.60                1.28\r\n    May             3.63                1.64\r\n    June            2.71                1.74\r\n    July            2.86                2.45\r\n    August          3.61                1.81\r\n    September       3.33                1.84\r\n    October         3.46                2.09\r\n    November        3.97                2.22\r\n    December        3.74                1.74\r\n                   -----                ----\r\n    Spring         10.67                4.09\r\n    Summer          9.18                6.00\r\n    Autumn         10.76                6.15\r\n    Winter         10.42                4.45\r\n                   -----               -----\r\n    Year           41.03               20.69\r\n\r\nAnother very striking difference between the two countries is shown by a\r\ncomparison of the quantity of water falling in single days. The\r\nfollowing table, given in the Radcliffe Observatory Reports, Oxford,\r\nEngland, 15th volume, shows the proportion of very light rains there.\r\nThe observation was in the year 1854. Rain fell on 156 days:\r\n\r\n    73  days gave less than         .05  inch.\r\n    30      \"     between that and  .10    \"\r\n    27      \"     between .10   \"   .20    \"\r\n     9      \"        \"    .20   \"   .30    \"\r\n     9      \"        \"    .30   \"   .40    \"\r\n     4      \"        \"    .40   \"   .50    \"\r\n     1       gave                   .60    \"\r\n     2        \"                     .80    \"\r\n     1        \"                    1.00    \"\r\n\r\nNearly half the number gave less fall than five-hundredths of an inch,\r\nand more than four-fifths the number gave less than one-fifth of an\r\ninch, and none gave over an inch.\r\n\r\nThere is more rain in the United States, by a large measure, than there;\r\nbut the amount falls in less time, and the average of saturation is\r\ncertainly much less here. From manuscript records, furnished us by Dr.\r\nHobbs, of Waltham, Mass., we find, that the quantity falling in the year\r\n1854, was equal to the average quantity for thirty years, and that rain\r\nfell on fifty-four days, in the proportion as follows:\r\n\r\nNumber of rainy days, 54; total rain-fall, 41.29.\r\n\r\n    0 days gave less than            .05 inch.\r\n    2     \"     between that and     .10  \"\r\n    8     \"     between .10   \"      .20  \"\r\n    7     \"       \"     .20   \"      .30  \"\r\n    5     \"       \"     .30   \"      .40  \"\r\n    4     \"       \"     .40   \"      .50  \"\r\n    2     \"       \"     .50   \"      .60  \"\r\n    4     \"       \"     .60   \"      .70  \"\r\n    4     \"       \"     .70   \"      .80  \"\r\n    3     \"       \"     .80   \"      .90  \"\r\n    0     \"       \"     .90   \"     1.00  \"\r\n    0     \"       \"    1.00   \"     1.10  \"\r\n    2     \"       \"    1.10   \"     1.20  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    1.20   \"     1.30  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    1.30   \"     1.40  \"\r\n    3     \"       \"    1.40   \"     1.50  \"\r\n    2     \"       \"    1.50   \"     1.60  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    1.60   \"     1.70  \"\r\n    2     \"       \"    1.80   \"     1.90  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    2.30   \"     2.40  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    2.50   \"     2.60  \"\r\n    1     \"       \"    3.20   \"     3.30  \"\r\n\r\nNo rain-fall gave less than five-hundredths of an inch; and more than\r\none-fourth the number of days gave more than one inch.

The following observations of the\r\naverage depth of snow, have been made at the places cited, and are\r\ncopied, by Blodget, from various published notices:\r\n\r\n    Oxford Co., Me.      12 years     90   inches per year.\r\n    Dover, N.

The\r\nwater coming upon the surface, would force out an equal quantity of\r\nwater at the bottom, through the drains--the time occupied by the\r\nprocess, varying according to the porous or retentive nature of the\r\nsoil; but in ordinary circumstances, it would be, perhaps, about\r\nforty-eight hours. Drains usually run much longer than this after a\r\nheavy rain, and, in fact, many run constantly through the year, but they\r\nare supplied from lands at a higher level, either near by or at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the soil were perfectly dry, holding no water in\r\nsuspension, then there would be no water of drainage until the soil had\r\nbecome saturated.\r\n\r\nEvaporation is constantly carrying off great quantities of water during\r\nthe warm months, so that under-drained soil is seldom in the condition\r\nof saturation, and, on account of the supply by capillary attraction and\r\nby dew, is never thoroughly dry; but the same soil will, at different\r\ntimes, be at various points between saturation and dryness, and the\r\nwater of drainage will be consequently a greater or less per centage of\r\nthe rain-fall.\r\n\r\nAn experiment made by the writer, to ascertain what quantity of water a\r\ndry soil would hold in suspension, resulted as follows: A soil was\r\nselected of about average porosity, so that the result might be, as\r\nnearly as possible, a mean for the various kinds of soil, and dried by\r\nseveral days' baking. The quantity of soil then being carefully\r\nmeasured, a measured quantity of water was supplied slowly, until it\r\nbegan to escape at the bottom. The quantity draining away was measured\r\nand deducted from the total quantity supplied. It was thus ascertained\r\nthat one cubic foot of earth held 0.4826+ cubic feet of water, which is\r\na little more than three and one-half gallons. A dry soil, four feet\r\ndeep, would hold a body of water equal to a rain-fall of 23.17 inches,\r\nvertical depth, which is more than would fall in six months.\r\n\r\nThe quantity which is not drained away is used for vegetation or\r\nevaporated; and the fact, that the water of drainage is so much greater\r\nin proportion to the rain-fall in England than in this country, is owing\r\nto the humidity of that climate, in which the evaporation is only about\r\nhalf what it is in this country.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation from a reservoir surface at Baltimore, during the Summer\r\nmonths, was assumed by Colonel Abert to be to the quantity of rain as\r\ntwo to one.\r\n\r\nDr. Holyoke assigns the annual quantity evaporated at Salem, Mass., at\r\nfifty-six inches; and Colonel Abert quotes several authorities at\r\nCambridge, Mass., stating the quantity at fifty-six inches. These facts\r\nare given by Mr. Blodget, and also the table below.\r\n\r\n\r\n    QUANTITY OF WATER EVAPORATED, IN INCHES, VERTICAL DEPTH.\r\n\r\n            | Whitehaven, |             |\r\n            |   England,  | Ogdensburg, | Syracuse,\r\n            |   mean of   |   N.

F. Miller. It\r\nwas very carefully observed, from 1843 to 1848--the evaporation being\r\nfrom a copper vessel, protected from rain. The district is one of the\r\nwettest of England--the mean quantity of rain, for the same time, having\r\nbeen 45.25 inches.\r\n\r\nThis shows a great difference in the capacity of the air to absorb\r\nmoisture in England and the United States; and as evaporation is a\r\ncooling process, there is greater necessity for under-draining in this\r\ncountry than in England, supposing circumstances in other respects to be\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nEvaporation takes place at any point of temperature from 32°, or lower,\r\nto 212°--at which water boils. It is increased by heat, but is not\r\ncaused solely by it--for a north-west wind in New-England evaporates\r\nwater, and dries the earth more rapidly than the heat alone of a\r\nSummer's day; and when, under ordinary circumstances, evaporation from a\r\nwater-surface is slow, it becomes quite active when brought in close\r\nproximity to sulphuric acid, or other vapor-absorbing bodies.\r\n\r\nThe cold which follows evaporation is caused by a loss of the heat which\r\nis required for evaporation, and which passes off with the vapor, as a\r\nsolution, in the atmosphere; and as heat leaves the body to aid\r\nevaporation, it is evident that that body cannot be cooled by the\r\nprocess, below the dew-point at which evaporation ceases. The popular\r\nnotion that a body may be cooled almost to the freezing-point, in a hot\r\nSummer day, by the action of heat alone, is, then, erroneous. But still,\r\nthe amount of heat which is used up in evaporating stagnant water from\r\nundrained land, that might otherwise go towards warming the land and the\r\nroots of crops, is a very serious loss.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the temperature of a body, resulting from evaporation,\r\nmay reach 25° in the desert interior of the American continent; but, in\r\nthe Eastern States, it is not often more than 15°.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of evaporation is the reading of a wet-bulb-thermometer\r\n(the bulb being covered with moistened gauze) exposed to the natural\r\nevaporation; and the difference between that reading and the reading of\r\na dry-thermometer, is the expression of the cold resulting from\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is nearly saturated, the temperature of the air rarely goes\r\nabove 74°; but, if so, the moisture in the air prevents the passing away\r\nof insensible perspiration, and the joint action of heat and humidity\r\nexhausts the vital powers, causing sun-stroke, as it is called. At New\r\nYork city, August 12th to 14th, 1853, the wet-thermometer stood at 80°\r\nto 84°; the air, at 90° to 94°. The mortality, from this joint effect,\r\nwas very great--over two hundred persons losing their lives in the two\r\ndays, in that city.\r\n\r\nFrom very careful observations, made by Lorin Blodget, in 1853, at\r\nWashington, it was found that the difference between the wet and dry\r\nthermometer was 18-1/2° at 4 P. M., June 30th, and 16° at 2 P. M. on\r\nJuly 1st--the temperature of the air being 98° on the first day, and 95°\r\non the second; but such excesses are unusual.\r\n\r\nThe following table has been compiled from Mr. Blodget's notice of the\r\npeculiarities of the Summer of 1853:\r\n\r\nThe dates are such as were selected to illustrate the extreme\r\ntemperatures of the month, and the degrees represent the differences\r\nbetween the wet and dry thermometer.

The dew-point varies\r\naccording to the temperature and the humidity of the atmosphere; it is\r\nusually a few degrees lower than the temperature of evaporation--never\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nFrom observations made at Girard College, by Prof. A. D. Bache, in the\r\nyears 1840 to 1845, we find, that for April, 1844, the dew-point ranged\r\nfrom 4° to 16° lower than the temperature of the air; in May, from 4° to\r\n14° lower; in June, from 6° to 20° lower; in July, from 4° to 17°; in\r\nAugust, from 6° to 15° lower; and in September, from 6° to 21° lower.\r\nThe dew-point is, then, during the important months of vegetation,\r\nwithin about 20° of the temperature of the air. The temperature of the\r\ndew-point, as observed by Prof. Bache, was highest in August, 1843,\r\nbeing 66°, and lowest in January, 1844, being 18°; in July, 1844, it was\r\n64°, and in February, 1845, it was 25°. Its hourly changes during each\r\nday are quite marked, and follow, with some degree of regularity, the\r\nchanges in the temperature of the air; their greatest departure from\r\neach other being at the hottest hour of the day, which is two or three\r\nhours after noon, and the least at the coldest hour which is four or\r\nfive hours after midnight. The average temperature of the dew-point in\r\nApril, May, and June, 1844, was, at midnight, 50-1/2°, air, 57°; five\r\nhours after midnight, dew-point, 49°, air 54°; three hours after noon,\r\ndew-point, 54°, air, 63-1/2°. The average temperature for July, August\r\nand September, was, at midnight, dew-point, 58-1/2°, air, 65°; five\r\nhours after midnight, dew-point, 58°, air, 62°; three hours after noon,\r\ndew-point, 60-1/2°, air, 78°. The average temperature for the year was,\r\nat midnight, dew-point, 42°, air, 48°; five hours after midnight,\r\ndew-point, 41°, air, 46°; three hours after noon, dew-point, 44-1/2°,\r\nair, 59°.\r\n\r\nThe relative humidity of the atmosphere, or the amount of vapor held in\r\nsuspension in the air, in proportion to the amount which it might hold,\r\nwas, in the year 1858, as given in the journal of the Franklin\r\nInstitute, for\r\n\r\n                _Philadelphia._    _Somerset Co._\r\n    April              49   per cent.  --   2 P.

It has also been said that there is\r\ngreater need for drainage in the United States on this account; and, as\r\nthe warmth induced by draining is somewhat, in its effect, a\r\nmerchantable product, it may be well to consider it for a moment in that\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFirst: The drained land comes into condition for working, a week or ten\r\ndays earlier in the Spring than other lands.\r\n\r\nSecondly: The growth of the crops is quickened all through the Summer by\r\nan increase of several degrees in the temperature of the soil.\r\n\r\nThirdly: The injurious effects of frost are kept off several days later\r\nin the Fall.\r\n\r\nOf the value of these conditions, the farmer, who has lost his crops for\r\nlack of a few more warm days, may make his own estimates. In Roxbury,\r\nMr. I. P. Rand heats up a portion of his land, for the purpose of\r\nraising early plants for the market, by means of hot water carried by\r\niron pipes under the surface of the ground. In this manner he heats an\r\narea equal to 100 feet by 12 feet, by burning about one ton of coal a\r\nmonth. The increase of temperature which, in this case, is caused by\r\nthat amount of coal, can, in the absence of direct measurement, only be\r\nestimated; but it, probably, will average about 30°, day and night,\r\nthroughout the month. In an acre the area is 36.4 times as great as that\r\nheated by one ton of coal; the cost being in direct proportion to the\r\narea, 36.4 tons of coal would be required to heat an acre; which, at $6\r\nper ton, would cost $217.40. To heat an acre through 10°, would cost,\r\nthen, $72.47. It may be of interest to consider how much coal would be\r\nrequired to evaporate from an undrained field that amount of water which\r\nmight be carried off by under-drains, but which, without them, is\r\nevaporated from the surface. It may be taken as an approximate estimate,\r\nthat the evaporation from the surface of an undrained retentive field,\r\nis equal to two inches vertical depth of water for each of the months of\r\nMay, June, July, and August; which is equal to fifty-four thousand three\r\nhundred and five gallons, or eight hundred and sixty-two hogsheads per\r\nacre for each month. If this quantity of water were evaporated by means\r\nof a coal fire, about 22-2/3 tons of coal would be consumed, which, at\r\n$6 a ton, would cost $136. The cost of evaporating the amount of water\r\nwhich would pass off in one day from an acre would be about $4.53. It is\r\nprobable that about half as much water would be evaporated from\r\nthorough-drained land, though, by some experiments, the proportion has\r\nbeen made greater--in which case the loss of heat resulting from an\r\nexcess of moisture evaporated from undrained retentive land, over that\r\nwhich would be evaporated from drained land, would be equal to that\r\ngained by 11-1/3 tons of coal, which would cost $68; and this for each\r\nacre, in each of the three months. At whatever temperature a liquid\r\nvaporizes, it absorbs the same total quantity of heat.\r\n\r\nThe latent heat of watery vapor at 212° is 972°; that is, when water at\r\n212° is converted into vapor at the same temperature, the amount of heat\r\nexpended in the process is 972°. This heat becomes latent, or insensible\r\nto the thermometer. The heat rendered latent by converting ice into\r\nwater is about 140°. There are 7.4805 gallons in a cubic foot of water\r\nwhich weighs 62.38 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a sea of water, more than three feet deep over the\r\nwhole face of the land, falls annually from the clouds, equal to 4,000\r\ntons in weight to every acre. We would use enough of this water to\r\ndissolve the elements of fertility in the soil, and fit them for the\r\nfood of plants. We would retain it all in our fields, long enough to\r\ntake from it its stores of fertilizing substances, brought from reeking\r\nmarshes and steaming cities on cloud-wings to our farms. We would, after\r\ntaking enough of its moisture to cool the parched earth, and to fit the\r\nsoil for germination and vegetable growth, discharge the surplus, which\r\nmust otherwise stagnate in the subsoil, by rapid drainage into the\r\nnatural streams and rivers.\r\n\r\nEvaporation proceeds more rapidly from a surface of water, than from a\r\nsurface of land, unless it be a saturated surface. It proceeds more\r\nrapidly in the sun than in the shade, and it proceeds again more rapidly\r\nin warm than in cold weather. It varies much with the culture of the\r\nfield, whether in grass, or tillage, or fallow, and with its condition,\r\nas to being dry or wet, and with its formation, whether level or hilly.\r\nYet, with all these variations, very great reliance may be placed upon\r\nthe ascertained results of the observations already at our command.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that evaporation from a water surface is, in general,\r\ngreater than from land, and here we may observe one of those grand\r\ncompensating designs of Providence which exist through all nature.\r\n\r\nIf the same quantity of water fell upon the sea and the land, and the\r\nevaporation were the same from both, then all the rivers running into\r\nthe sea would soon convey to it all the water, and the sea would be\r\nfull. But though nearly as much water falls on the sea as on the land,\r\nyet evaporation is much greater from the water than from land.\r\n\r\nAbout three feet of rain falls upon the _water_, while the evaporation\r\nfrom a water surface far exceeds that amount. In the neighborhood of\r\nBoston, evaporation from water surface is said to be 56 inches in the\r\nyear, and in the State of New York, about 50 inches; while, in England,\r\nit is put by Mr. Dalton at 44.43 inches, and, by others, much lower.\r\n\r\nAgain, about three feet of water annually falls upon the _land_, while\r\nthe evaporation from the land is but little more than 20 inches. If this\r\nwater fell upon a flat surface of soil, with an impervious subsoil of\r\nrock or clay, we should have some sixteen inches of water in the course\r\nof the year more than evaporates from the land. If a given field be\r\ndish-shaped, so as to retain it all, it must become a pond, and so\r\nremain, except in Summer, when greater evaporation from a water surface\r\nmay reduce it to a swamp or marsh.\r\n\r\nWith 16 or 18 inches more water falling annually on all our cultivated\r\nfields than goes off by evaporation, is it not wise to inquire by what\r\nprocess of Nature or art this vast surplus shall escape?\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made with a view to determine the proportion of\r\nevaporation and filtration, upon well-drained land, in different months.\r\nFrom an able article in the N. Y. Agricultural Society for 1854, by\r\nGeorge Geddes, we copy the following statement of valuable observations\r\nupon these points.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, in the different observations collected in\r\nthis chapter, results are somewhat various. They have been brought\r\ntogether for comparison, and will be found sufficiently uniform for all\r\npractical purposes in the matter of drainage.\r\n\r\n     \"The experiments upon evaporation and drainage, made on Mr.\r\n     Dalton's plan, were in vessels three feet deep, filled with soil\r\n     just in the condition to secure perfect freedom from excess of\r\n     water, and the drainage was determined by the amount of water that\r\n     passed out of the tube at the bottom. These experiments have been\r\n     most perfectly made in England by Mr. John Dickinson.

The result\r\n     of the experiment is entirely in accordance with what would have\r\n     been expected by a person conversant with the laws of vegetation.\r\n\r\n     \"The mean of each month for the eight years is:\r\n\r\n     ==============================================\r\n                  |         |           |Per cent\r\n        MONTHS.   |  Rain.  |Filtration.|\r\n                  |         |           |filtered.\r\n     -------------+---------+-----------+----------\r\n                  |_Inches._| _Inches._ |\r\n                  |         |           |\r\n       January    |  1.84   |   1.30    |  70.7\r\n       February   |  1.79   |   1.54    |  78.4\r\n       March      |  1.61   |   1.08    |  66.6\r\n       April      |  1.45   |   0.30    |  21.0\r\n       May        |  1.85   |   0.11    |   5.8\r\n       June       |  2.21   |   0.04    |   1.7\r\n       July       |  2.28   |   0.04    |   1.8\r\n       August     |  2.42   |   0.03    |   1.4\r\n       September  |  2.64   |   0.37    |  13.9\r\n       October    |  2.82   |   1.40    |  49.5\r\n       November   |  3.83   |   3.26    |  84.9\r\n       December   |  1.64   |   1.80    | 110.0\r\n     ==============================================\r\n\r\n     \"The filtration from April to September is very small--practically\r\n     nothing; but during those months we have 12.67 inches of rain--that\r\n     is, we have two inches a month for evaporation besides the quantity\r\n     in the earth on the first day of April.

'Of\r\n     this Winter portion of 10.39, we must allow at least six inches for\r\n     floods running away at the time of the rain, and then we have only\r\n     4.39 inches left for the supply of rivers and wells.' (Breadmore,\r\n     p. 34.)\r\n\r\n     \"It is calculated in England that the ordinary Summer run of\r\n     streams does not exceed ten cubic feet per minute per square mile,\r\n     and that the average for the whole year, due to springs and\r\n     ordinary rains, is twenty feet per minute per square mile,\r\n     exclusive of floods--and assuming no very wet or high mountain\r\n     districts (Breadmore, p. 34)--which is equal to about four inches\r\n     over the whole surface. If we add to this the six inches that are\r\n     supposed to run off in freshets, we have ten inches discharged in\r\n     the course of the year by the streams. The whole filtration was\r\n     11.29 inches--10.39 in the Winter, and .90 in the Summer. The\r\n     remainder, 1.29 inches, is supposed to be consumed by wells and\r\n     excessive evaporation from marshes and pools, from which the\r\n     discharge is obstructed, by animals, and in various other ways.\r\n     These calculations were made from experiments running through eight\r\n     years, in which the average fall of water was only 26.61 inches per\r\n     annum. When the results derived from them are applied to our\r\n     average fall of 35.28 inches, we have for the water that\r\n     constitutes the Summer flow of our streams 13.25 cubic feet per\r\n     minute per mile of the country drained, and for the average annual\r\n     flow, exclusive of freshets, 26.50 cubic feet per mile per minute.\r\n     That is to say, of the 35.28 inches of water that fall in the\r\n     course of the year, 5.30 run away in the streams as the average\r\n     annual flow, 7.95 run away in the freshets, and 20.47 evaporate\r\n     from the earth's surface, leaving 1.56 for consumption in various\r\n     ways. In the whole year the drainage is nearly equal to one cubic\r\n     foot per second per square mile (.976), no allowance being made for\r\n     the 1.56 inches which is lost as before stated.

The fall is less, and the evaporation is less, in England\r\n     than here; and the fall, in each case, bears the same proportion to\r\n     the evaporation, very nearly; and it appears that the experiments\r\n     made on the two sides of the ocean, result in giving very nearly\r\n     the same per centage of drainage. In England, it is 42.4 per cent.;\r\n     in this State, it is 44.1.

There, the water which falls in Winter passes into the soil, and\r\nis drained off as it falls; while here, the snow accumulates to a great\r\ndepth, and in thawing floods the land at once.\r\n\r\nBoth here and in England, much of the land requires no under-draining,\r\nas it has already a subsoil porous enough to allow free passage for all\r\nthe surplus water; and it is no small part of the utility of\r\nunderstanding the principles of drainage, that it will enable farmers to\r\ndiscriminate--at a time when draining is somewhat of a fashionable\r\noperation with amateurs--between land that does and land that does _not_\r\nrequire so expensive an operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF HIGH LANDS--WHAT LANDS REQUIRE DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n     What is High Land?--Accidents to Crops from Water.--Do Lands need\r\n     Drainage in America?--Springs.--Theory of Moisture, with\r\n     Illustrations.--Water of Pressure.--Legal Rights as to Draining our\r\n     Neighbor's Wells and Land.--What Lands require Drainage?--Horace\r\n     Greeley's Opinion.--Drainage more Necessary in America than in\r\n     England; Indications of too much Moisture.--Will Drainage Pay?\r\n\r\n\r\nBy \"high land,\" is meant land, the surface of which is not overflowed,\r\nas distinguished from swamps, marshes, and the like low lands. How great\r\na proportion of such lands would be benefitted by draining, it is\r\nimpossible to estimate.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Draining, in their Report to the State Agricultural\r\nSociety of New York, in 1848, assert that, \"There is not one farm out of\r\nevery seventy-five in this State, but needs draining--yes, much\r\ndraining--to bring it into high cultivation. Nay, we may venture to say,\r\nthat every wheat-field would produce a larger and finer crop if properly\r\ndrained.\" The committee further say: \"It will be conceded, that no\r\nfarmer ever raised a good crop of grain on wet ground, or on a field\r\nwhere pools of water become masses of ice in the Winter. In such cases,\r\nthe grain plants are generally frozen out and perish; or, if any\r\nsurvive, they never arrive at maturity, nor produce a well-developed\r\nseed. In fact, every observing farmer knows that stagnant water, whether\r\non the surface of his soil, or within reach of the roots of his plants,\r\nalways does them injury.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Delafield, one of the most distinguished agriculturists of\r\nNew York, said in a public address:\r\n\r\n     \"We all well know that wheat and other grains, as well as grasses,\r\n     are never fully developed, and never produce good seed, when the\r\n     roots are soaked in moisture. No man ever raised good wheat from a\r\n     wet or moist subsoil. Now, the farms of this country, though at\r\n     times during the Summer they appear dry, and crack open on the\r\n     surface, are not, in fact, dry farms, for reasons already named. On\r\n     the contrary, for nine months out of twelve, they are moist or wet;\r\n     and we need no better evidence of the fact, than the annual\r\n     freezing out of the plants, and consequent poverty of many crops.\"\r\n\r\nIf we listen to the answers of farmers, when asked as to the success of\r\ntheir labors, we shall be surprised, perhaps, to observe how much of\r\ntheir want of success is attributed to _accidents_, and how uniformly\r\nthese accidents result from causes which thorough draining would remove.\r\nThe wheat-crop of one would have been abundant, had it not been badly\r\nfrozen out in the Fall; while another has lost nearly the whole of his,\r\nby a season too wet for his land. A farmer at the West has planted his\r\ncorn early, and late rains have rotted the seed in the ground; while one\r\nat the East has been compelled, by the same rains, to wait so long\r\nbefore planting, that the season has been too short. Another has worked\r\nhis _clayey_ farm so wet, because he had not time to wait for it to dry,\r\nthat it could not be properly tilled. And so their crops have wholly or\r\npartially failed, and all because of too much cold water in the soil. It\r\nwould seem, by the remarks of those who till the earth, as if there were\r\nnever a season just right--as if Providence had bidden us labor for\r\nbread, and yet sent down the rains of heaven so plentifully as always to\r\nblight our harvests. It is rare that we do not have a most remarkable\r\nseason, with respect to moisture, especially. Our potatoes are rotted by\r\nthe Summer showers, or cut off by a Summer drought; and when, as in the\r\nseason of 1856, in New England, they are neither seriously diseased nor\r\ndried up, we find at harvest-time that the promise has belied the\r\nfulfillment; that, after all the fine show above ground, the season has\r\nbeen too wet, and the crop is light. We frequently hear complaint that\r\nthe season was too _cold_ for Indian corn, and that the ears did not\r\nfill; or that a sharp drought, following a wet Spring, has cut short the\r\ncrop. We hear no man say, that he lacked skill to cultivate his crop.\r\nSeldom does a farmer attribute his failure to the poverty of his soil.\r\nHe has planted and cultivated in such a way, that, in a _favorable\r\nseason_, he would have reaped a fair reward for his toil; but the season\r\nhas been too wet or too dry; and, with full faith that farming will pay\r\nin the long run, he resolves to plant the same land in the same manner,\r\nhoping in future for better luck.\r\n\r\n_Too much cold water_ is at the bottom of most of these complaints of\r\nunpropitious seasons, as well as of most of our soils; and it is in our\r\npower to remove the cause of these complaints and of our want of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n    \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\r\n    But in ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nWe must underdrain all the land we cultivate, that Nature has not\r\nalready underdrained, and we shall cease complaints of the seasons. The\r\nadvice of Cromwell to his soldiers: \"Trust God, and keep your powder\r\ndry,\" affords a good lesson of faith and works to the farmer. We shall\r\nseldom have a season, upon properly drained land, that is too wet, or\r\ntoo cold, or even too dry; for thorough draining is almost as sure a\r\nremedy for a drought, as for a flood.\r\n\r\n_Do lands need under draining in America?_ It is a common error to\r\nsuppose that, because the sun shines more brightly upon this country\r\nthan upon England, and because almost every Summer brings such a drought\r\nhere as is unknown there, her system of thorough drainage can have no\r\nplace in agriculture on this side of the Atlantic. It is true that we\r\nhave a clearer sky and a drier climate than are experienced in England;\r\nbut it is also true that, although we have a far less number of showers\r\nand of rainy days, we have a greater quantity of rain in the year.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of drainage, however, does not depend so much upon the\r\nquantity of water which falls or flows upon land, nor upon the power of\r\nthe sun to carry it off by evaporation, as upon _the character of the\r\nsubsoil_. The vast quantity of water which Nature pours upon every acre\r\nof soil annually, were it all to be removed by evaporation alone, would\r\nrender the whole country barren; but Nature herself has kindly done the\r\nwork of draining upon a large proportion of our land, so that only a\r\nhealthful proportion of the water which falls on the earth, passes off\r\nat the surface by the influence of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the subsoil is of sand or gravel, or of other porous earth, that\r\nportion of the water not evaporated, passes off below by natural\r\ndrainage. If the subsoil be of clay, rock, or other impervious\r\nsubstances, the downward course of the water is checked, and it remains\r\nstagnant, or bursts out upon the surface in the form of springs.\r\n\r\nAs the primary object of drainage is to remove surplus water, it may be\r\nwell to consider with some care\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOURCES OF MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n_Springs._--These are, as has been suggested, merely the water of rain\r\nand snow, impeded in its downward percolation, and collected and poured\r\nforth in a perennial flow at a lower level.\r\n\r\nThe water which falls in the form of rain and snow upon the soil of the\r\nwhole territory of the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains, each\r\nyear, is sufficient to cover it to the depth of more than 3 feet. It\r\ncomes upon the earth, not daily in gentle dews to water the plants, but\r\nat long, unequal intervals, often in storms, tempests, and showers,\r\npouring out, sometimes, in a single day, more than usually falls in a\r\nwhole month.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of all this moisture, is an inquiry especially interesting\r\nto the agriculturist, upon whose fruitful fields this flood of water\r\nannually descends, and whose labor in seed-time would be destroyed by a\r\nsingle Summer shower, were not Nature more thoughtful than he, of his\r\nwelfare. Of the water which thus falls upon cultivated fields, a part\r\nruns away into the streams, either upon the surface, or by percolation\r\nthrough the soil; a part is taken up into the air by evaporation, while\r\na very small proportion enters into the constitution of vegetation. The\r\nproportion which passes off by percolation varies according to the\r\nnature of the soil in the locality where it falls.\r\n\r\nUsually, we find the crust of the earth in our cultivated fields, in\r\nstrata, or layers: first, a surface-soil of a few inches of a loamy\r\nnature, in which clay or sand predominates; and then, it may be, a layer\r\nof sand or gravel, freely admitting the passage of water; and, perhaps,\r\nnext, and within two or three feet of the surface, a stratum of clay, or\r\nof sand or gravel cemented with some oxyd of iron, through which water\r\npasses very slowly, or not at all. These strata are sometimes regular,\r\nextending at an equal depth over large tracts, and having a uniform dip,\r\nor inclination. Oftener, however, in hilly regions especially, they are\r\nquite irregular--the impervious stratum frequently having depressions of\r\ngreater or less extent, and holding water, like a bowl. Not\r\nunfrequently, as we cut a ditch upon a declivity, we find that the dip\r\nof the strata below has no correspondence with the visible surface of\r\nthe field, but that the different strata lie nearly level, or are much\r\nbroken, while the surface has a regular inclination.\r\n\r\nUnderlying all soils, at greater or less depth, is found some bed of\r\nrock, or clay, impervious to water, usually at but few feet below the\r\nsurface--the descending water meeting with obstacles to its regular\r\ndescent. The tendency of the rain-water which falls upon the earth, is\r\nto sink directly downward by gravitation. Turned aside, however, by the\r\nmany obstacles referred to, it often passes obliquely, or almost\r\nhorizontally, through the soil. The drop which falls upon the hill-top\r\nsinks, perhaps, a few inches, meets with a bed of clay, glides along\r\nupon it for many days, and is at last borne out to be drunk up by the\r\nsun on some far-off slope; another, falling upon the sand-plain, sinks\r\nat once to the \"water-line,\" or line of level water, which rests on clay\r\nbeneath, and, slowly creeping along, helps to form a swamp or bog in the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the rain which falls upon the high land is collected together\r\nby fissures in the rocks, or by seams or ruptures in the impervious\r\nstrata below the surface, and finds vent in a gushing spring on the\r\nhill-side.\r\n\r\nWe feel confident that no better illustration of the theory of springs,\r\nas connected with our subject, can be found, than that of Mr. Girdwood,\r\nin the Cyclopedia of Agriculture--a work from which we quote the more\r\nliberally, because it is very expensive and rare in America:\r\n\r\n     \"When rain falls on a tract of country, part of it flows over the\r\n     surface, and makes its escape by the numerous natural and\r\n     artificial courses which may exist, while another portion is\r\n     absorbed by the soil and the porous strata which lie under it.\r\n\r\n     \"Let the following diagram represent such a tract of country, and\r\n     let the dark portions represent clay or other impervious strata,\r\n     while the lighter portions represent layers of gravel, sand, or\r\n     chalk, permitting a free passage to water.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n     \"When rain falls in such a district, after sinking through the\r\n     surface-layer (represented in the diagram by a narrow band), it\r\n     reaches the stratified layers beneath. Through these it still\r\n     further sinks, if they are porous, until it reaches some impervious\r\n     stratum, which arrests its directly-downward course, and compels it\r\n     to find its way along its upper surface. Thus, the rain which falls\r\n     on the space represented between B and D, is compelled, by the\r\n     impervious strata, to flow towards C. Here it is at once absorbed,\r\n     but is again immediately arrested by the impervious layer E; it is,\r\n     therefore, compelled to pass through the porous stratum C, along\r\n     the surface of E to A, where it pours forth in a fountain, or forms\r\n     a morass or swamp, proportionate in size or extent to the tract of\r\n     country between B and D, or the quantity of rain which falls upon\r\n     it. In such a case as is here represented, it will be obvious that\r\n     the spring may often be at a great distance from the district from\r\n     which it derives its supplies; and this accounts for the fact, that\r\n     drainage-works on a large scale sometimes materially lessen the\r\n     supply of water at places remote from the scene of operations.\r\n\r\n     \"In the instance given above, the water forming the spring is\r\n     represented as gaining access to the porous stratum, at a point\r\n     where it crops out from beneath an impervious one, and as passing\r\n     along to its point of discharge at a considerable depth, and under\r\n     several layers of various characters. Sometimes, in an undulating\r\n     country, large tracts may rest immediately upon some highly-porous\r\n     stratum--as from B to C, in the following diagram--rendering the\r\n     necessity for draining less apparent; while the country from A to\r\n     B, and from C to D, may be full of springs and marshes--arising,\r\n     partly, from the rain itself, which falls in these latter\r\n     districts, being unable to find a way of escape, and partly from\r\n     the natural drainage of the more porous soils adjoining being\r\n     discharged upon it.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n     \"Again: the rocks lying under the surface are sometimes so full of\r\n     fissures, that, although they themselves are impervious to water,\r\n     yet, so completely do these fissures carry off rain, that, in some\r\n     parts of the county of Durham, they render the sinking of wells\r\n     useless, and make it necessary for the farmers to drive their\r\n     cattle many miles for water. It sometimes happens that these\r\n     fissures, or cracks, penetrate to enormous depths, and are of great\r\n     width, and filled with sand or clay. These are termed _faults_ by\r\n     miners; and some, which we lately examined, at distances of from\r\n     three to four hundred yards from the surface, were from five to\r\n     fifteen yards in width. These faults, when of clay, are generally\r\n     the cause of springs appearing at the surface: they arrest the\r\n     progress of the water in some of the porous strata, and compel it\r\n     to find an exit, by passing to the surface between the clay and the\r\n     faces of the ruptured strata. When the fault is of sand or gravel,\r\n     the opposite effect takes place, if it communicates with any porous\r\n     stratum; and water, which may have been flowing over the surface,\r\n     on reaching it, is at once absorbed. In the following diagram, let\r\n     us suppose that B represents such a clay-fault as has been\r\n     described, and that A represents a sandy one, and that C and D\r\n     represent porous strata charged with water. On the water reaching\r\n     the fault at B, it will be compelled to find its way to the\r\n     surface--there forming a spring, and rendering the retentive soil,\r\n     from B to A, wet; but, as soon as it reaches the sandy-fault at A,\r\n     it is immediately absorbed, and again reaches the porous strata,\r\n     along which it had traveled before being forced to the surface at\r\n     B. It will be observed, that the strata at the points of\r\n     dislocation are not represented as in a line with the portions from\r\n     which they have been dissevered. This is termed the upthrow of the\r\n     fault, as at B; and the downthrow, as at A. For the sake of the\r\n     illustration, the displacement is here shown as very slight; but,\r\n     in some cases, these elevations and depressions of the strata\r\n     extend to many hundreds of feet--as, for instance, at the mines of\r\n     the British Iron Company, at Cefn-Mawre, in North Wales, where the\r\n     downthrow of the fault is 360 feet.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n     \"Sometimes the strata are disposed in the form of a basin. In this\r\n     case, the water percolating through the more elevated ground--near\r\n     what may be called the rim--collects in the lower parts of the\r\n     strata towards the centre, there forcing its way to the surface, if\r\n     the upper impervious beds be thin; or, if otherwise, remaining a\r\n     concealed reservoir, ready to yield its supplies to the shaft or\r\n     boring-rod of the well-sinker, and sometimes forming a living\r\n     fountain capable of rising many feet above the surface. It is in\r\n     this way that what are called Artesian wells are formed. The\r\n     following diagram represents such a disposition of the strata as\r\n     has just been referred to. The rain which falls on the tracts of\r\n     country at A and B, gradually percolates towards the centre of the\r\n     basin, where it may be made to give rise to an Artesian well, as at\r\n     C, by boring through the superincumbent mass of clay; or it may\r\n     force itself to the surface through the thinner part of the layer\r\n     of clay, as at D--there forming a spring, or swamp.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n     \"Again: the higher parts of hilly ground are sometimes composed of\r\n     very porous and absorbent strata, while the lower portions are more\r\n     impervious--the soil and subsoil being of a very stiff and\r\n     retentive description. In this case, the water collected by the\r\n     porous layers is prevented from finding a ready exit, when it\r\n     reaches the impervious layers, by the stiff surface-soil. The water\r\n     is by this means dammed up in some measure, and acquires a\r\n     considerable degree of pressure; and, forcing itself to the day at\r\n     various places, it forms those extensive \"weeping\"-banks which have\r\n     such an injurious effect upon many of our mountain-pastures. This\r\n     was the form of spring, or swamp, to the removal of which Elkington\r\n     principally turned his attention; and the following diagram, taken\r\n     from a description of his system of draining, will explain the\r\n     stratification and springs referred to, more clearly.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n     \"In some districts, where clay forms the staple of the soil, a bed\r\n     of sand or gravel, completely saturated with water, occurs at the\r\n     depth of a few feet from the surface, following all the undulations\r\n     of the country, and maintaining its position, in relation to the\r\n     surface, over considerable tracts, here and there pouring forth its\r\n     waters in a spring, or denoting its proximity, by the subaquatic\r\n     nature of the herbage. Such a configuration is represented in the\r\n     following diagram, where A represents the surface-soil; B, the\r\n     impervious subsoil of clay; C, the bed of sandy-clay or gravel; and\r\n     D, the lower bed of clay, resting upon the rocky strata beneath.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n     \"Springs sometimes communicate with lakes or pools, at higher\r\n     levels. In such cases, the quantity of water discharged is\r\n     generally so great, as to form at once a brook or stream of some\r\n     magnitude. These, therefore, hardly come under the ordinary\r\n     cognizance of the land-drainer, and are, therefore, here merely\r\n     referred to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OF PRESSURE.\r\n\r\nWater that issues from the land, either constantly, periodically, or\r\neven intermittently, may, perhaps, be properly termed a _spring_. But\r\nthere is often much water in the soil which did not fall in rain upon\r\nthat particular field, and which does not issue from it in any defined\r\nstream, but which is slowly passing through it by percolation from a\r\nhigher source, to ooze out into some stream, or to pass off by\r\nevaporation; or, perhaps, farther on, to fall into crevices in the soil,\r\nand eventually form springs. As we find it in our field, it is neither\r\nrain-water, which has there fallen, nor spring-water, in any sense. It\r\nhas been appropriately termed the _water of pressure_, to distinguish it\r\nfrom both rain and spring-water; and the recognition of this term will\r\ncertainly be found convenient to all who are engaged in the discussion\r\nof drainage.\r\n\r\nThe distinction is important in a legal point of view, as relating to\r\nthe right of the land-owner to divert the sources of supply to\r\nmill-streams, or to adjacent lower lands. It often happens that an owner\r\nof land on a slope may desire to drain his field, while the adjacent\r\nowner below, may not only refuse to join in the drainage, but may\r\nbelieve that he derives an advantage from the surface-washing or the\r\npercolation from his higher neighbor. He may believe that, by deep\r\ndrainage above, his land will be dried up and rendered worthless; or, he\r\nmay desire to collect the water which thus percolates, into his land,\r\nand use it for irrigation, or for a water-ram, or for the supply of his\r\nbarn-yard. May the upper owner legally proceed with the drainage of his\r\nown land, if he thus interfere with the interests of the man below?\r\n\r\nAgain: wherever drains have been opened, we already hear complaints of\r\ntheir effects upon wells. In our good town of Exeter, there seems to be\r\na general impression on one street, that the drainage of a swamp,\r\nformerly owned by the author, has drawn down the wells on that street,\r\nsituated many rods distant from the drains. Those wells are upon a sandy\r\nplain, with underlying clay, and the drains are cut down upon the clay,\r\nand into it, and may possibly draw off the water a foot or two lower\r\nthrough the whole village--if we can regard the water line running\r\nthrough it as the surface of a pond, and the swamp as a dam across its\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nThe rights of land-owners, as to running water over their premises, have\r\nbeen fruitful of litigation, but are now well defined. In general, in\r\nthe language of Judge Story,\r\n\r\n     \"Every proprietor upon each bank of a river, is entitled to the\r\n     land covered with water in front of his bank to the middle thread\r\n     of the stream, &c. In virtue of this ownership, he has a right to\r\n     the use of the water flowing over it in its natural current,\r\n     without diminution or obstruction. The consequence of this\r\n     principle is, that no proprietor has a right to use the water to\r\n     the prejudice of another. It is wholly immaterial whether the party\r\n     be a proprietor above or below, in the course of the river, the\r\n     right being common to all the proprietors _on_ the river. No one\r\n     has a right to diminish the quantity which will, according to the\r\n     natural current, flow to the proprietor below, or to throw it back\r\n     upon a proprietor above.\"\r\n\r\nChief Justice Richardson, of New Hampshire, thus briefly states the same\r\nposition:\r\n\r\n     \"In general, every man has a right to the use of the water flowing\r\n     in a stream through his land, and if any one divert the water from\r\n     its natural channel, or throw it back, so as to deprive him of the\r\n     use of it, the law will give him redress. But one man may acquire,\r\n     by grant, a right to throw the water back upon the land of another,\r\n     and long usage may be evidence of such a grant. It is, however,\r\n     well settled that a man acquires no such right by merely being the\r\n     first to make use of the water.\"\r\n\r\nWe are not aware that it has ever been held by any court of law, or even\r\nasserted, that a land-owner may not intercept the percolating water in\r\nhis soil for any purpose and at his pleasure; nor have we in mind any\r\ncase in which the draining out of water from a well, by drainage for\r\nagricultural purposes, has subjected the owner of the land to\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that a land-owner has the right to follow the rules of\r\ngood husbandry in the drainage of his land, so far as the water of\r\npressure is concerned, without responsibility for remote consequences to\r\nadjacent owners, to the owners of distant wells or springs that may be\r\naffected, or to mill-owners.\r\n\r\nIn considering the effect of drainage on streams and rivers, it appears\r\nthat the results of such operations, so far as they can be appreciated,\r\nare, to lessen the value of water powers, by increasing the flow of\r\nwater in times of freshets, and lessening it in times of drought. It is\r\nsupposed in this country, that clearing the land of timber has sensibly\r\naffected the value of \"mill privileges,\" by increasing evaporation, and\r\ndiminishing the streams. No mill-owner has been hardy enough to contend\r\nthat a land-owner may not legally cut down his own timber, whatever the\r\neffect on the streams. So, we trust, no court will ever be found, which\r\nwill restrict the land-owner in the highest culture of his soil, because\r\nhis drainage may affect the capacity of a mill-stream to turn the\r\nwater-wheels.\r\n\r\nTo return from our digression. It is necessary, in order to a correct\r\napprehension of the work which our drains have to perform, to form a\r\ncorrect opinion as to how much of the surplus moisture in our field is\r\ndue to each of the three causes to which we have referred--to wit,\r\nrain-water, which falls upon it; springs, which burst up from below; and\r\nwater of pressure, stagnant in, or slowly percolating through it. The\r\nrain-tables will give us information as to the first; but as to the\r\nothers, we must form our opinion from the structure of the earth around\r\nus, and observation upon the field itself, by its natural phenomena and\r\nby opening test-holes and experimental ditches. Having gained accurate\r\nknowledge of the sources of moisture, we may then be able to form a\r\ncorrect opinion whether our land requires drainage, and of the aid which\r\nNature requires to carry off the surplus water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT LANDS REQUIRE DRAINAGE?\r\n\r\nThe more one studies the subject of drainage, the less inclined will he\r\nbe to deal in general statements. \"Do you think it is profitable to\r\nunderdrain land?\" is a question a thousand times asked, and yet is a\r\nquestion that admits of no direct general answer. Is it profitable to\r\nfence land? is it profitable to plow land? are questions of much the\r\nsame character. The answers to them all depend upon circumstances.\r\nThere is land that may be profitably drained, and fenced, and plowed,\r\nand there is a great deal that had better be let alone. Whether draining\r\nis profitable or not, depends on the value and character of the land in\r\nquestion, as well as on its condition as to water. Where good land is\r\nworth one hundred dollars an acre, it might be profitably drained; when,\r\nif the same land were worth but the Government price of $1.25 an acre,\r\nit might be better to make a new purchase in the neighborhood, than to\r\nexpend ten times its value on a tract that cannot be worth the cost of\r\nthe operation. Drainage is an expensive operation, requiring much labor\r\nand capital, and not to be thought of in a pioneer settlement by\r\nindividual emigrants. It comes after clearing, after the building of\r\nlog-houses and mills, and schoolhouses, and churches, and roads, when\r\ncapital and labor are abundant, and when the good lands, nature-drained,\r\nhave been all taken up.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, whether drainage is profitable, depends not only on the\r\nvalue, but on the character of the soil as to productiveness when\r\ndrained. There is much land that would be improved by drainage, that\r\ncannot be profitably drained. It would improve almost any land in New\r\nEngland to apply to it a hundred loads of stable manure to the acre; but\r\nwhether such application would be profitable, must depend upon the\r\nreturns to be derived from it. Horace Greeley, who has his perceptions\r\nof common affairs, and especially of all that relates to progress, wide\r\nawake, said, in an address at Peekskill, N. Y.:\r\n\r\n     \"My deliberate judgment is, that all lands which are worth plowing,\r\n     which is not the case with all lands that are plowed, would _be\r\n     improved_ by draining; but I know that our farmers are neither able\r\n     nor ready to drain to that extent, nor do I insist that it would\r\n     pay while land is so cheap, and labor and tile so dear as at\r\n     present. Ultimately, I believe, we shall tile-drain nearly all our\r\n     level, or moderately sloping lands, that are worth cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nWhether land would be _improved_ by drainage, is one question, and\r\nwhether the operation will _pay_, is quite another. The question whether\r\nit will pay, depends on the value of the land before drainage, the cost\r\nof the operation, and the value of the land when completed. And the cost\r\nof the operation includes always, not only the money and labor expended\r\nin it, but also the loss to other land of the owner, by diverting from\r\nit the capital which would otherwise be applied to it. Where labor and\r\ncapital are limited so closely as they are in all our new States, it is\r\na question not only how can they be profitably applied, but how can they\r\nbe _most_ profitably applied. A proprietor, who has money to loan at six\r\nper cent. interest, may well invest it in draining his land; when a\r\nworking man, who is paying twelve per cent. interest for all the capital\r\nhe employs, might ruin himself by making the same improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO ALL LANDS REQUIRE DRAINAGE?\r\n\r\nOur opinion is, that a great deal of land does not in any sense require\r\ndrainage, and we should differ with Mr. Greeley, in the opinion that\r\n_all_ lands worth ploughing, would be improved by drainage. Nature has\r\nherself thoroughly drained a large proportion of the soil. There is a\r\ngreat deal of finely-cultivated land in England, renting at from five to\r\nten dollars per acre, that is thought there to require no drainage.\r\n\r\nIn a published table of estimates by Mr. Denton, made in 1855, it is\r\nsupposed that Great Britain, including England, Scotland, and Wales,\r\ncontain 43,958,000 acres of land, cultivated and capable of cultivation;\r\nof which he sets down as \"wet land,\" or land requiring drainage,\r\n22,890,004 acres, or about one half the whole quantity. His estimate is,\r\nthat only about 1,365,000 acres had then been permanently drained, and\r\nthat it would cost about 107 millions of pounds to complete the\r\noperation, estimating the cost at about twenty shillings, or five\r\ndollars per acre.\r\n\r\nThese estimates are valuable in various views of our subject. They\r\nanswer with some definiteness the question so often asked, whether all\r\nlands require drainage, and they tend to correct the impression, which\r\nis prevalent in this country, that there is something in the climate of\r\nGreat Britain that makes drainage there essential to good cultivation on\r\nany land. The fact is not so. There, as in America, it depends upon the\r\ncondition and character of the soil, more than upon the quantity of\r\nrain, or any condition of climate, whether drainage is required or not.\r\nGenerally, it will be found on investigation, that so far as climate,\r\nincluding of course the quantity and regularity of the rain-fall, is\r\nconcerned, drainage is more necessary in America than in Great\r\nBritain--the quantity of rain being in general greater in America, and\r\nfar less regular in its fall. This subject, however, will receive a more\r\ncareful consideration in another place.\r\n\r\nIf in America, as in Great Britain, one half the cultivable land require\r\ndrainage, or even if but a tenth of that half require it, the subject is\r\nof vast importance, and it is no less important for us to apprehend\r\nclearly what part of our land does _not_ require this expenditure, than\r\nto learn how to treat properly that which does require it.\r\n\r\nTo resume the inquiry, what lands require drainage? it may be answered--\r\n\r\n\r\nALL LANDS OVERFLOWED IN SUMMER REQUIRE DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nLands overflowed by the regular tides of the ocean require drainage,\r\nwhether they lie upon the sea-shore, or upon rivers or bays. But this\r\ndrainage involves embankments, and a peculiar mode of procedure, of\r\nwhich it is not now proposed to treat.\r\n\r\nAgain, all lands overflowed by Summer freshets, as upon rivers and\r\nsmaller streams, require drainage. These, too, usually require\r\nembankments, and excavations of channels or outlets, not within the\r\nusual scope of what is termed thorough drainage. For a further answer to\r\nthe question--what lands require drainage? the reader is referred to the\r\nchapters which treat of the effect of drainage upon the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAMPS AND BOGS REQUIRE DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nNo argument is necessary to convince rational men that the very\r\nextensive tracts of land, which are usually known as swamps and bogs,\r\nmust, in some way, be relieved of their surplus water, before they can\r\nbe rendered fit for cultivation. The treatment of this class of wet\r\nlands is so different from that applied to what we term upland, that it\r\nwill be found more convenient to pass the subject by with this allusion,\r\nat present, and consider it more systematically under a separate head.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL HIGH LANDS THAT CONTAIN TOO MUCH WATER AT ANY SEASON, REQUIRE\r\nDRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nDraining has been defined, \"The art of rendering land not only so free\r\nof moisture as that no superfluous water shall remain in it, but that no\r\nwater shall remain in it so long as to injure, or even retard the\r\nhealthy growth of plants required for the use of man and beast.\"\r\n\r\nSome plants grow in water. Some even spring from the bottom of ponds,\r\nand have no other life than such a position affords. But most plants,\r\nuseful to man, are drowned by being overflowed even for a short time,\r\nand are injured by any stagnant water about their roots. Why this is so,\r\nit is not easy to explain. Most of our knowledge on these points, is\r\nderived from observation. We know that fishes live in water, and if we\r\nwould propagate them, we prepare ponds and streams for the purpose. Our\r\ndomestic animals live on land, and we do not put them into fish-ponds to\r\npasture. There are useful plants which thrive best in water. Such is the\r\ncranberry, notwithstanding all that has been said of its cultivation on\r\nupland. And there are domestic fowls, such as ducks and geese, that\r\nrequire pools of water; but we do not hence infer that our hens and\r\nchickens would be better for daily immersion. All lands, then, require\r\ndrainage, that contain too much water, at any season _for the intended\r\ncrops_.\r\n\r\nThis will be found to be an important element in our rule. Land may\r\nrequire drainage for Indian corn, that may not require it for grass.\r\nMost of the cultivated grasses are improved in quality, and not lessened\r\nin quantity, by the removal of stagnant water in Summer; but there are\r\nreasons for drainage for hoed crops, which do not apply to our mowing\r\nfields. In New England, we have for a few weeks a perfect race with\r\nNature, to get our seeds into the ground before it is too late. Drained\r\nland may be plowed and planted several weeks earlier than land\r\nundrained, and this additional time for preparation is of great value to\r\nthe farmer. Much of this same land would be, by the first of June, by\r\nthe time the ordinary planting season is past, sufficiently drained by\r\nNature, and a grass crop upon it would be, perhaps, not at all\r\nbenefitted by thorough-drainage; so that it is often an important\r\nconsideration with reference to this operation, whether a given portion\r\nof our farm may not be most profitably kept in permanent grass, and\r\nmaintained in fertility by top-dressing, or by occasional plowing and\r\nreseeding in Autumn. It is certainly convenient to have all our fields\r\nadapted to our usual rotation, and it is for each man to balance for\r\nhimself this convenience against the cost of drainage in each particular\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWhat particular crops are most injured by stagnant water in the soil,\r\nor by the too tardy percolation of rain-water, may be determined by\r\nobservation. How stagnant water injures plants, is not, as has been\r\nsuggested, easily understood in all its relations. It doubtless retards\r\nthe decomposition of the substances which supply their nutriment, and it\r\nreduces the temperature of the soil. It has been suggested, that it\r\nprevents or checks perspiration and introsusception, and it excludes the\r\nair which is essential to the vegetation of most plants. Whatever the\r\ntheory, the fact is acknowledged, that stagnant water _in_ as well as\r\n_on_ the soil, impedes the growth of all our valuable crops, and that\r\ndrainage soon cures the evil, by removing the effect with its cause. And\r\nthe remedy seems to be almost instantaneous; for, on most upland, it is\r\nfound that by the removal of stagnant water, the soil is in a single\r\nseason rendered fit for the growth of cultivated crops. In low meadows,\r\ncomposed of peat and swamp mud, in many cases, exposure to the air for a\r\nyear or two after drainage, is often found to enhance the fertility of\r\nthe soil, which contains, frequently, acids which need correction.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF TOO MUCH MOISTURE.\r\n\r\nIt has already been suggested, that motives of convenience may induce us\r\nto drain our lands--that we may have a longer season in which to work\r\nthem; and that there may be cases where the crop would flourish if\r\nplanted at precisely the right time, where yet we cannot well, without\r\ndrainage, seasonably prepare for the crop. Generally, however, lands too\r\nwet seasonably to plant, will give indications, throughout the season,\r\nof hidden water producing its ill effects.\r\n\r\nIf the land be in grass, we find that aquatic plants, like rushes or\r\nwater grasses, spring up with the seeds we have sown, and, in a few\r\nyears, have possession of the field, and we are soon compelled to plow\r\nup the sod, and lay it again to grass. If it be in wheat or other\r\ngrain, we see the field spotted and uneven; here a portion on some\r\nslight elevation, tall and dark colored, and healthy; and there a little\r\ndepression, sparsely covered with a low and sickly growth. An American\r\ntraveling in England in the growing season, will always be struck with\r\nthe perfect _evenness_ of the fields of grain upon the well-drained\r\nsoil. Journeying through a considerable portion of England and Wales\r\nwith intelligent English farmers, we were struck with their nice\r\nperception on this point.\r\n\r\nThe slightest variation in the color of the wheat in the same or\r\ndifferent fields, attracted their instant attention.\r\n\r\n\"That field is not well-drained; the corn is too light-colored.\" \"There\r\nis cold water at the bottom there; the corn cannot grow;\" were the\r\nconstant criticisms, as we passed across the country. Inequalities that,\r\nin our more careless cultivation, we should pass by without observation,\r\nwere at once explained by reference to the condition of the land, as to\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe drill-sowing of wheat, and the careful weeding it with the horse-hoe\r\nand by hand, are additional reasons why the English fields should\r\npresent a uniform appearance, and why any inequalities should be fairly\r\nreferable to the condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nUpon a crop of Indian corn, the cold water lurking below soon places its\r\nunmistakable mark. The blade comes up yellow and feeble. It takes\r\ncourage in a few days of bright sunshine in June, and tries to look\r\nhopeful, but a shower or an east wind again checks it. It had already\r\nmore trouble than it could bear, and turns pale again. Tropical July and\r\nAugust induce it to throw up a feeble stalk, and to attempt to spindle\r\nand silk, like other corn. It goes through all the forms of vegetation,\r\nand yields at last a single nubbin for the pig. Indian corn must have\r\nland that is dry in Summer, or it cannot repay the labor of cultivation.\r\n\r\nCareful attention to the subject will soon teach any farmer what parts\r\nof his land are injured by too much water; and having determined that,\r\nthe next question should be, whether the improvement of it by drainage\r\nwill justify the cost of the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL IT PAY?\r\n\r\nDrainage is a permanent investment. It is not an operation like the\r\napplication of manure, which we should expect to see returned in the\r\nform of salable crops in one or two years, or ten at most, nor like the\r\nlabor applied in cultivating an annual crop. The question is not whether\r\ndrainage will pay in one or two years, but will it pay in the long run?\r\nWill it, when completed, return to the farmer a fair rate of interest\r\nfor the money expended? Will it be more profitable, on the whole, than\r\nan investment in bank or railway shares, or the purchase of Western\r\nlands? Or, to put the question in the form in which an English\r\nland-owner would put it, will the rent of the land improved by drainage,\r\nbe permanently increased enough to pay a fair interest on the cost of\r\nthe improvement?\r\n\r\nLet us bring out this idea clearly to the American farmer by a familiar\r\nillustration. Your field is worth to you now one hundred dollars an\r\nacre. It pays you, in a series of years, through a rotation of planting,\r\nsowing, and grass, a nett profit of six dollars an acre, above all\r\nexpenses of cultivation and care.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, it will cost one-third of a hundred dollars an acre to\r\ndrain it, and you expend on each three acres one hundred dollars, what\r\nmust the increase of your crops be, to make this a fair investment? Had\r\nyou expended the hundred dollars in _labor_, to produce a crop of\r\ncabbages, you ought to get your money all back, with a fair profit, the\r\nfirst year. Had you expended it in guano or other special manures, whose\r\nbeneficial properties are exhausted in some two or three years, your\r\nexpenditure should be returned within that period. But the improvement\r\nby drainage is permanent; it is done for all time to come. If,\r\ntherefore, your drained land shall pay you a fair rate of interest on\r\nthe cost of drainage, it is a good investment. Six per cent. is the most\r\ncommon rate of interest, and if, therefore, each three acres of your\r\ndrained land shall pay you an increased annual income of six dollars,\r\nyour money is fairly invested. This is at the rate of two dollars an\r\nacre. How much increase of crop will pay this two dollars? In the common\r\nrotation of Indian corn, potatoes, oats, wheat, or barley, and grass,\r\ntwo or three bushels of corn, five or six bushels of potatoes, as many\r\nbushels of oats, a bushel or two of wheat, two or three bushels of\r\nbarley, will pay the two dollars. Who, that has been kept back in his\r\nSpring's work by the wetness of his land, or has been compelled to\r\nre-plant because his seed has rotted in the ground, or has experienced\r\nany of the troubles incident to cold wet seasons, will not admit at\r\nonce, that any land which Nature has not herself thoroughly drained,\r\nwill, in this view, pay for such improvement?\r\n\r\nBut far more than this is claimed for drainage. In England, where such\r\noperations have been reduced to a system, careful estimates have been\r\nmade, not only of the cost of drainage, but of the increase of crops by\r\nreason of the operation.\r\n\r\nIn answer to questions proposed by a Board of Commissioners, in 1848, to\r\npersons of the highest reputation for knowledge on this point, the\r\nincrease of crops by drainage was variously stated, but in no case at\r\nless than a paying rate. One gentleman says: \"A sixth of increase in\r\nproduce of grain crops may be taken as the very lowest estimate, and, in\r\nactual result, it is seldom less than one-fourth. In very many cases,\r\nafter some following cultivation, the produce is doubled, whilst the\r\nexpense of working the land is much lessened.\" Another says: \"In many\r\ninstances, a return of fully 25 per cent. on the expenditure is\r\nrealized, and in some even more.\" A third remarks, \"My experience and\r\nobservation have chiefly been in heavy clay soils, where the result of\r\ndrainage is eminently beneficial, and where I should estimate the\r\nincreased crop at six to ten bushels (wheat) per statute acre.\"\r\n\r\nThese are estimates made upon lands that had already been under\r\ncultivation. In addition to such lands as are merely rendered less\r\nproductive by surplus water, we have, even on our hard New England\r\nfarms--on side hills, where springs burst out, or at the foot of\r\ndeclivities, where the land is flat, or in runs, which receive the\r\nnatural drainage of higher lands--many places which are absolutely unfit\r\nfor cultivation, and worse than useless, because they separate those\r\nparts of the farm which can be cultivated. If, of these wet portions, we\r\nmake by draining, good, warm, arable land, it is not a mere question of\r\nper centage or profit; it is simply the question whether the land, when\r\ndrained, is worth more than the cost of drainage. If it be, how much\r\nmore satisfactory, and how much more profitable it is, to expend money\r\nin thus reclaiming the waste places of our farms, and so uniting the\r\ndetached fields into a compact, systematic whole, than to follow the\r\nnatural bent of American minds, and \"annex\" our neighbor's fields by\r\npurchasing.\r\n\r\nAny number of instances could be given of the increased value of lands\r\nin England by drainage, but they are of little practical value. The\r\nfacts, that the Government has made large loans in aid of the process,\r\nthat private drainage companies are executing extensive works all over\r\nthe kingdom, and that large land-holders are draining at their own cost,\r\nare conclusive evidence to any rational mind, that drainage in Great\r\nBritain, at least, well repays the cost of the operation.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter may be found accurate statements of American farmers\r\nof their drainage operations, in different States, from which the reader\r\nwill be able to form a correct opinion, whether draining in this country\r\nis likely to prove a profitable operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS METHODS OF DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n     Open Ditches.--Slope of Banks.--Brush Drains.--Ridge and\r\n     Furrow.--Plug-Draining.--Mole-Draining.--Mole-Plow.--Wedge and\r\n     Shoulder Drains.--Larch Tubes.--Drains of Fence Rails, and\r\n     Poles.--Peat Tiles.--Stone Drains Injured by Moles.--Downing's\r\n     Giraffes.--Illustrations of Various Kinds of Stone Drains.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN DITCHES.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious mode of getting rid of surface-water is, to cut a ditch\r\non the surface to a lower place, and let it run. So, if the only object\r\nwere to drain a piece of land merely for a temporary purpose--as, where\r\nland is too wet to ditch properly in the first instance, and it is\r\nnecessary to draw off part of the surplus water before systematic\r\noperations are commenced--an open ditch is, perhaps, the cheapest method\r\nto be adopted.\r\n\r\nAgain: where land to be drained is part of a large sloping tract, and\r\nwater runs down, at certain seasons, in large quantities upon the\r\nsurface, an open catch-water-ditch may be absolutely necessary. This\r\ncondition of circumstances is very common in mountainous districts,\r\nwhere the rain which falls on the hills flows down, either on the\r\nvisible surface or on the rock-formation under the soil, and breaks out\r\nat the foot, causing swamps, often high up on the hill-sides. Often,\r\ntoo, in clay districts, where sand or loam two or three feet deep rests\r\non tough clay, we see broad sloping tracts, which form our best\r\ngrass-fields.\r\n\r\nIf we are attempting to drain the lower part of such a slope, we shall\r\nfind that the water from the upper part flows down in large quantities\r\nupon us, and an open ditch may be most economical as a header, to cut\r\noff the down-flowing water; though, in most cases, a covered drain may\r\nbe as efficient.\r\n\r\nAt the outlets, too, of our tile or stone drains, when we come down\r\nnearly to the level of the stream which receives our drainage-water, we\r\nfind it convenient, often, and indeed necessary, to use open\r\nditches--perhaps only a foot or two deep--to carry off the water\r\ndischarged. These ditches are of great importance, and should be\r\nfinished with care, because, if they become obstructed, they cause\r\nback-water in the drains, and may ruin the whole work.\r\n\r\nOpen drains are thus essential auxiliaries to the best plans of thorough\r\ndrainage; and, whatever opinion may be entertained of their economy,\r\nmany farmers are so situated that they feel obliged to resort to them\r\nfor the present, or abandon all idea of draining their wet lands. We\r\nwill, therefore, give some hints as to the best manner of constructing\r\nopen drains; and then suggest, in the form of objections to them, such\r\nconsiderations as shall lead the proprietor who adopts this mode to\r\nconsider carefully his plan of operations in the outset, with a view to\r\nobviate, as much as possible, the manifest embarrassments occasioned by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs to the location of drains in swamps and peculiarly wet places,\r\ndirections may be found in another chapter. We here propose only to\r\ntreat of the mode of forming open drains, after their location is fixed.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all drains is an open ditch, of equal width from top to\r\nbottom. It cannot stand a single season, in any climate or soil, without\r\nbeing seriously impaired by the frosts or the heavy rains. All open\r\ndrains should be sloping; and it is ascertained, by experiment, what is\r\nthe best, or, as it is sometimes expressed, the natural slope, on\r\ndifferent kinds of soil. If earth be tipped from a cart down a bank, and\r\nbe left exposed to the action of the weather, it will rest, and finally\r\nremain, at a regular angle or inclination, varying from 21° to 55° with\r\nthe horizon, according to the nature of the soil. The natural slope of\r\ncommon earth is found to be about 33° 42'; and this is the inclination\r\nusually adopted by railroad engineers for their embankments.\r\n\r\nIf the banks of the open ditch are thus sloped, they will have the least\r\npossible tendency to wash away, or break down by frost.\r\n\r\nAgain: where open ditches are adopted in mowing fields, they may, if not\r\nvery deep, be sloped still lower than the natural slope, and seeded down\r\nto the bottom; so that no land will be lost, and so that teams may pass\r\nacross them.\r\n\r\nThis amounts, in fact, to the old ridge and furrow system, which was\r\nalmost universal in England before tiles were used, and is sometimes\r\nseen practiced in this country. The land, by that system, is\r\nback-furrowed in narrow lands, till it is laid up into beds, sloping\r\nfrom the tops, or backs, to the furrows which constitute the drains.\r\nThis mode of culture is very ancient, and is probably referred to in the\r\nlanguage of the Psalmist, in the Scriptures: \"Thou waterest the ridges\r\nthereof abundantly, thou settlest the furrows thereof, thou makest it\r\nsoft with showers.\"\r\n\r\nThe objections to open ditches, as compared with under-drains, may be\r\nbriefly stated thus:\r\n\r\n1. _They are expensive._ The excavation of a sloping drain is much\r\ngreater than that of an upright drain. An open drain must have a width\r\nof one or two feet at the bottom, to receive the earth that always must,\r\nto some extent, wash into it. An open drain requires to be cleaned out\r\nonce a year, to keep it in good order. There is a large quantity of\r\nearth from an open drain to be disposed of, either by spreading or\r\nhauling away. Thus, a drain of this kind is costly at the outset, and\r\nrequires constant labor and care to preserve it in working condition.\r\n\r\n2. _They are not permanent._ A properly laid underdrain will last half a\r\ncentury or more, but an open drain, especially if deep, has a constant\r\ntendency to fill up. Besides, the action of frost and water and\r\nvegetation has a continual operation to obstruct open ditches. Rushes\r\nand water-grasses spring up luxuriantly in the wet and slimy bottom, and\r\noften, in a single season, retard the flow of water, so that it will\r\nstand many inches deep where the fall is slight. The slightest accident,\r\nas the treading of cattle, the track of a loaded cart, the burrowing of\r\nanimals, dams up the water and lessens the effect of the drain. Hence,\r\nwe so often see meadows which have been drained in this way going back,\r\nin a few years, into wild grass and rushes.\r\n\r\n3. _They obstruct good husbandry._ In the chapter upon the effects of\r\ndrainage on the condition of the soil, we suggest, in detail, the\r\nhindrances which open ditches present to the convenient cultivation of\r\nthe land, and, especially, how they obstruct the farmer in his plowing,\r\nhis mowing, his raking, and the general laying out of his land for\r\nconvenient culture.\r\n\r\n4. _They occupy too much land._ If a ditch have an upright bank, it is\r\nso soft that cattle will not step within several feet of it in plowing,\r\nand thus a strip is lost for culture, or must be broken up by hand. If,\r\nindeed, we can get the plow near it, there being no land to rest\r\nagainst, the last furrow cannot be turned from the ditch, and if it be\r\nturned into it, must be thrown out by hand. If the banks be sloped to\r\nthe bottom, and the land be thus laid into beds or ridges, the\r\nappearance of the field may, indeed, be improved, but there is still a\r\nloss of soil; for the soil is all removed from the furrow, which will\r\nalways produce rushes and water-grass, and carried to the ridge, where\r\nit doubles the depth of the natural soil. Thus, instead of a field of\r\nuniform condition, as to moisture and temperature and fertility, we have\r\nstrips of wet, cold, and poor soil, alternating with dry, warm, and rich\r\nsoil, establishing a sort of gridiron system, neither beautiful,\r\nconvenient, nor profitable.\r\n\r\n5. _The manure washes off and is lost._ The three or four feet of water\r\nwhich the clouds annually give us in rain and snow, must either go off\r\nby evaporation, or by filtration, or run off upon the surface. Under the\r\ntitle of Rain and Evaporation, it will be seen that not much more than\r\nhalf this quantity goes off by evaporation, leaving a vast quantity to\r\npass off through or upon the soil. If lands are ridged up, the manure\r\nand finer portions of the soil are, to a great extent, washed away into\r\nthe open ditches and lost. Of the water which filters downwards, a large\r\nportion enters open ditches near the surface, before the fertilizing\r\nelements have been strained out; whereas, in covered drains of proper\r\ndepth, the water is filtered through a mass of soil sufficiently deep to\r\ntake from it the fertilizing substances, and discharge it, comparatively\r\npure, from the field. In a paper by Prof. Way (11th Jour. Roy. Ag.\r\nSoc.), on \"The Power of Soils to retain Manure,\" will be found\r\ninteresting illustrations of the filtering qualities of different kinds\r\nof soil.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above reasons for preferring covered drains, it has\r\nbeen asserted by one of the most skillful drainers in the world (Mr.\r\nParkes), \"that a proper covered drain of the same depth as an open\r\nditch, will drain a greater breadth of land than the ditch can effect.\r\nThe sides of the ditch,\" he says, \"become dried and plastered, and\r\ncovered with vegetation; and even while they are free from vegetation,\r\ntheir absorptive power is inferior to the covered drain.\"\r\n\r\nOf the depth, direction, and distance of drains, our views will be found\r\nunder the appropriate heads. They apply alike to open and covered\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSH DRAINS.\r\n\r\nHaving a farm destitute of stones, before tiles were known among us, we\r\nmade several experiments with covered drains filled with brush. Some of\r\nthose drains operated well for eight or ten years; others caved in and\r\nbecame useless in three or four years, according to the condition of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIn a wet swamp a brush drain endures much longer than in sandy land,\r\nwhich is dry a part of the year, because the brush decays in dry land,\r\nbut will prove nearly imperishable in land constantly wet. In a peat or\r\nmuck swamp, we should expect that such drains, if carefully constructed,\r\nmight last twenty years, but that in a sandy loam they would be quite\r\nunreliable for a single year.\r\n\r\nOur failure on upland with brush drains, has resulted, not from the\r\ndecay of the wood, but from the entrance of sand, which obstructed the\r\nchannel. Moles and field-mice find these drains the very day they are\r\nlaid, and occupy them as permanent homes ever after.\r\n\r\nThose little animals live partly upon earth-worms, which they find by\r\nburrowing after them in the ground, and partly upon insects, and\r\nvegetation above ground. They have a great deal of business, which\r\nrequires convenient passages leading from their burrows to the\r\nday-light, and drains in which they live will always be found perforated\r\nwith holes from the surface. In the Spring, or in heavy showers, the\r\nwater runs in streams into these holes, breaks down the soft soil as it\r\ngoes, and finally the top begins to fall in, and the channel is choked\r\nup, and the work ruined. We have tried many precautions against this\r\nkind of accident, but none that was effectual on light land.\r\n\r\nThe general mode of construction is this: Open the trench to the depth\r\nrequired, and about 12 inches wide at the bottom. Lay into this poles of\r\nfour or five inches diameter at the butt, leaving an open passage\r\nbetween. Then lay in brush of any size, the coarsest at the bottom,\r\nfilling the drain to within a foot of the surface, and covering with\r\npine, or hemlock, or spruce boughs. Upon these lay turf, carefully cut,\r\nas close as possible. The brush should be laid but-end up stream, as it\r\nobstructs the water less in this way. Fill up with soil a foot above the\r\nsurface, and tread it in as hard as possible. The weight of earth will\r\ncompress the brush, and the surface will settle very much. We have tried\r\nplacing boards at the sides, and upon the top of the brash, to prevent\r\nthe caving in, but with no great success. Although our drains thus laid,\r\nhave generally continued to discharge some water, yet they have, upon\r\nupland, been dangerous traps and pitfalls for our horses and cattle, and\r\nhave cost much labor to fill up the holes, where they have fallen\r\nthrough by washing away below.\r\n\r\nIn clay, brush drains might be more durable. In the English books, we\r\nhave descriptions of drains filled with thorn cuttings from hedges and\r\nwith gorse. When well laid in clay, they are said to last about 15\r\nyears. When the thorns decay, the clay will still retain its form, and\r\nleave a passage for the water.\r\n\r\nA writer in the Cyclopedia sums up the matter as to this kind of drains,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     \"Although in some districts they are still employed, they can only\r\n     be looked upon as a clumsy, and superficial plan of doing that\r\n     which can be executed in a permanent and satisfactory manner, at a\r\n     very small additional expense, now that draining-tiles are so cheap\r\n     and plentiful.\"\r\n\r\nDraining-tiles are not yet either cheap or plentiful in this country;\r\nbut we have full faith that they will become so very soon. In the mean\r\ntime it may be profitable for us to use such of the substitutes for them\r\nas may lie within our reach, selecting one or another according as\r\nmaterial is convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUG-DRAINING\r\n\r\nhas never been, that we are aware, practiced in America. Our knowledge\r\nof it is limited to what we learn from English books. We, therefore,\r\ncontent ourselves with giving from Morton's Cyclopedia the following\r\ndescription and illustrations.\r\n\r\n     \"_Plug-draining_, like mole-draining, does not require the use of\r\n     any foreign material--the channel for the water being wholly formed\r\n     of clay, to which this kind of drain, like that last mentioned is\r\n     alone suited.\r\n\r\n     \"This method of draining requires a particular set of tools for its\r\n     execution, consisting of, first, a common spade, by means of which\r\n     the first spit is removed, and laid on one side; second, a\r\n     smaller-sized spade, by means of which the second spit is taken\r\n     out, and laid on the opposite side of the trench thus formed;\r\n     third, a peculiar instrument called a bitting iron (Fig. 11),\r\n     consisting of a narrow spade, three and a half feet in length, and\r\n     one and a half inches wide at the mouth and sharpened like a\r\n     chisel; the mouth, or blade, being half an inch in thickness in\r\n     order to give the necessary strength to so slender an implement.\r\n     From the mouth, _a_, on the right-hand side, a ring of steel, _b_,\r\n     six inches long and two and a half broad, projects at right angles;\r\n     and on the left, at fourteen inches from the mouth, a tread, _c_,\r\n     three inches long, is fitted.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n     \"A number of blocks of wood, each one foot long, six inches high,\r\n     and two inches thick at the bottom, and two and a half at the top,\r\n     are next required. From four to six of these are joined together by\r\n     pieces of hoop-iron let into their sides by a saw-draught, a small\r\n     space being left between their ends, so that when completed, the\r\n     whole forms a somewhat flexible bar, as shown in the cut, to one\r\n     end of which a stout chain is attached. These blocks are wetted,\r\n     and placed with the narrow end undermost, in the bottom of the\r\n     trench, which should be cut so as to fit them closely; the clay\r\n     which has been dug out is then to be returned, by degrees, upon the\r\n     blocks, and rammed down with a wooden rammer three inches wide. As\r\n     soon as the portion of the trench above the blocks, or plugs, has\r\n     been filled, they are drawn forward, by means of a lever thrust\r\n     through a link of the chain, and into the bottom of the drain for a\r\n     fulcrum, until they are all again exposed, except the last one. The\r\n     further portion of the trench, above the blocks, is now filled in\r\n     and rammed, and so on the operations proceed until the whole drain\r\n     is finished.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--PLUG DRAINAGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLE DRAINING.\r\n\r\nWe hear of an implement, in use in Illinois and other Western States,\r\ncalled the Gopher Plow, worked by a capstan, which drains wet land by\r\nmerely drawing through it an iron shoe, at about two and a half feet in\r\ndepth, without the use of any foreign substance.\r\n\r\nWe hear reports of a mole plow, in use in the same State, known by the\r\nname of Marcus and Emerson's Patent Subsoiler, with which, an informant\r\nsays, drains are made also in the manner above named. This machine is\r\nworked by a windlass power, by a horse or yoke of oxen, and the price\r\ncharged is twenty-eight cents a rod for the work. These machines are,\r\nfrom description, modifications of the English Mole Plow, an implement\r\nlong ago known and used in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--MOLE PLOW.]\r\n\r\nThe following description is from Morton's Cyclopedia:\r\n\r\n     \"_Mole-Drains_ are the simplest of all the forms of the covered\r\n     drains. They are formed by means of a machine called the mole plow.\r\n     This machine consists of a long wooden beam and stilts, somewhat in\r\n     the form of the subsoil plow; but instead of the apparatus for\r\n     breaking up the subsoil in the latter, a short cylindrical and\r\n     pointed bar of iron is attached, horizontally, to the lower end of\r\n     the broad coulter, which can be raised or lowered by means of a\r\n     slot in the beam. The beam itself is sheathed with iron on the\r\n     under side, and moves close to the ground; thus keeping the bar at\r\n     the end of the coulter at one uniform depth. This machine is\r\n     dragged through the soft clay, which is the only kind of land on\r\n     which it can be used with propriety, by means of a chain and\r\n     capstan, worked by horses, and produces a hollow channel very\r\n     similar to a mole-run, from which it derives its name.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _New York Tribune_ thus describes the operation\r\nand utility of a mole plow, which he saw on the farm of Major A. B.\r\nDickinson, of Hornby, Steuben County, New York:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe there is not a rod of tile laid on this farm, and not a\r\n     dozen rods of covered stone drain. But the major has a home-made,\r\n     or, at least, home-devised, 'bull plow,' consisting of a\r\n     sharp-pointed iron wedge, or roller, surmounted by a broad, sharp\r\n     shank nearly four feet high, with a still sharper cutter in front,\r\n     and with a beam and handles above all. With five yoke of oxen\r\n     attached, this plow is put down through the soil and subsoil to an\r\n     average depth of three feet--in the course which the superfluous\r\n     water is expected and desired to take--and the field thus plowed\r\n     through and through, at intervals of two rods, down to three feet,\r\n     as the ground is more or less springy and saturated with water. The\r\n     cut made by the shank closes after the plow and is soon\r\n     obliterated, while that made by the roller, or wedge, at the\r\n     bottom, becomes the channel of a stream of water whenever there is\r\n     any excess of moisture above its level, which stream tends to clear\r\n     itself and rather enlarge its channel. From ten to twenty acres a\r\n     day are thus drained, and Major D. has such drains of fifteen to\r\n     twenty years' standing, which still do good service. In rocky\r\n     soils, this mode of draining is impracticable: in sandy tracts it\r\n     would not endure; but here it does very well, and, even though it\r\n     should hold good in the average but ten years, it would many times\r\n     repay its cost.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Dickinson himself in a recent address, thus speaks of what he\r\ncalls his\r\n\r\n\r\n     SHANGHAE PLOW.\r\n\r\n     \"I will take the poorest acre of stubble ground, and if too wet for\r\n     corn in the first place, I will thoroughly drain it with a Shanghae\r\n     plow and four yoke of oxen in three hours.\r\n\r\n     \"I will suppose the acre to be twenty rods long and eight rods\r\n     wide. To thoroughly drain the worst of your clay subsoil, it may\r\n     require a drain once in eight feet, and they can be made so cheaply\r\n     that I can afford to make them at that distance. To do so, will\r\n     require the team to travel sixteen times over the twenty rods\r\n     lengthwise, or one mile in three hours; two men to drive, one to\r\n     hold the plow, one to ride the beam, and one to carry the crow-bar,\r\n     pick up any large stones thrown out by going to the right or left,\r\n     and to help to carry around the plow, which is too heavy for the\r\n     other two to do quickly.\r\n\r\n     \"The plow is quite simple in its construction, consisting of a\r\n     round piece of iron three and a half or four inches in diameter,\r\n     drawn down to a point, with a furrow cut in the top one and a half\r\n     inches deep; a plate, eighteen inches wide and three feet long,\r\n     with one end welded into the furrow of the round bar, while the\r\n     other is fastened to the beam. The coulter is six inches in width,\r\n     and is fastened to the beam at one end, and at the other to the\r\n     point of the round bar. The coulter and plate are each\r\n     three-fourths of an inch thick, which is the entire width of the\r\n     plow above the round iron at the bottom.\r\n\r\n     \"It would require much more team to draw this plow on some soils\r\n     than on yours. The strength of team depends entirely on the\r\n     character of the subsoil. Cast-iron, with the exception of the\r\n     coulter, for an easy soil would be equally good; and from eighteen\r\n     to twenty-four inches is sufficiently deep to run the plow. I can\r\n     as thoroughly drain an acre of ground in this way as any that can\r\n     be found in Seneca County.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the best information we can gather, it would seem, that on certain\r\nsoils with a clay subsoil, the mole plow, as a sort of pioneer\r\nimplement, may be very useful. The above account certainly indicates\r\nthat on the farm in question it is very cheap, rapid, and effectual in\r\nits operation.\r\n\r\nStephens gives a minute description of the mole plow figured above, in\r\nhis Book of the Farm. Its general structure and principle of operation\r\nmay be easily understood by what has been already said, and any person\r\ndesirous of constructing one may find in that work exact directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDGE AND SHOULDER DRAINS.\r\n\r\nThese, like the last-mentioned kind of drains, are mere channels formed\r\nin the subsoil. They have, therefore, the same fault of want of\r\ndurability, and are totally unfitted for land under the plow. In forming\r\n_wedge-drains_, the first spit, with the turf attached, is laid on one\r\nside, and the earth removed from the remainder of the trench is laid on\r\nthe other. The last spade used is very narrow, and tapers rapidly, so as\r\nto form a narrow wedge-shaped cavity for the bottom of the trench. The\r\nturf first removed is then cut into a wedge, so much larger than the\r\nsize of the lower part of the drain, that when rammed into it with the\r\ngrassy side undermost, it leaves a vacant space in the bottom six or\r\neight inches in depth, as in Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nThe _shoulder-drain_ does not differ very materially from the\r\nwedge-drain. Instead of the whole trench forming a gradually tapering\r\nwedge, the upper portion of the shoulder-drain has the sides of the\r\ntrench nearly perpendicular, and of considerable width, the last spit\r\nonly being taken out with a narrow, tapering spade, by which means a\r\nshoulder is left on either side, from which it takes its name. After the\r\ntrench has been finished, the first spit, having the grassy side\r\nundermost as in the former case, is placed in the trench, and pushed\r\ndown till it rests upon the shoulders already mentioned; so that a\r\nnarrow wedge-shaped channel is again left for the water, as shown in\r\nFig. 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--WEDGE-DRAIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--SHOULDER-DRAIN.]\r\n\r\nThese drains may be formed in almost any kind of land which is not a\r\nloose gravel or sand. They are a very cheap kind of drain; for neither\r\nthe cost of cutting nor filling in, much exceeds that of the ordinary\r\ntile drain, while the expense of tiles or other materials is altogether\r\nsaved. Still, such drains cannot be recommended, for they are very\r\nliable to injury, and, even under the most favorable circumstances, can\r\nonly last a very limited time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARCH TUBES.\r\n\r\nThese have been used in Scotland, in mossy or swampy soils, it is said,\r\nwith economy and good results. The tube represented below presents a\r\nsquare of 4 inches outside, with a clear water-way of 2 inches. Any\r\nother durable wood will, of course, answer the same purpose. The tube is\r\npierced with holes to admit the water. In wet meadows, these tubes laid\r\ndeep would be durable and efficient, and far more reliable than brush or\r\neven stones, because they may be better protected from the admission of\r\nsand and the ruinous working of vermin. Their economy depends upon the\r\nprice of the wood and the cost of tiles--which are far better if they\r\ncan be reasonably obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--LARCH TUBE-DRAIN.]\r\n\r\nNear Washington, D. C., we know of drainage tolerably well performed by\r\nthe use of common fence-rails. A trench is opened about three inches\r\nwider at bottom than two rails. Two rails are then laid in the bottom,\r\nleaving a space of two or three inches between them. A third rail is\r\nthen laid on for a cover, and the whole carefully covered with turf or\r\nstraw, and then filled up with earth. Poles of any kind may be used\r\ninstead of rails, if more convenient.\r\n\r\nIn clay, these drains would be efficient and durable; in sand, they\r\nwould be likely to be filled up and become useless. This is an\r\nextravagant waste of timber, except in the new districts where it is of\r\nno value.\r\n\r\nMr. J. F. Anderson, of Windham, Maine, has adopted a mode of draining\r\nwith poles, which, in regions where wood is cheap and tiles are dear,\r\nmay be adopted with advantage.\r\n\r\nTwo poles, of from 3 to 6 inches diameter, are laid at the bottom of the\r\nditch, with a water-way of half their diameter between them. Upon these,\r\na third pole is laid, thus forming a duct of the desired dimensions.\r\nThe security of this drain will depend upon the care with which it is\r\nprotected by a covering of turf and the like, to prevent the admission\r\nof earth, and its permanency will depend much upon its being placed low\r\nenough to be constantly wet, as such materials are short-lived when\r\nfrequently wet and dried, and nearly imperishable if constantly wet. It\r\nis unnecessary to place brush or stones over such drains to make them\r\ndraw, as it is called. The water will find admission fast enough to\r\ndestroy the work, unless great care is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--POLE-DRAIN.]\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, and in some parts of England and Scotland, peat-tiles are\r\nsometimes used in draining bogs. They are cheap and very durable in such\r\nlocalities, but, probably, will not be used in this country. They are\r\nformed somewhat like pipes, of two pieces of peat. Two halves are formed\r\nwith a peculiar tool, with a half circle in each. When well dried, they\r\nare placed together, thus making a round opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--TOOL FOR PEAT-TILES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--PEAT-TILES.]\r\n\r\nIn draining, the object being merely to form a durable opening in the\r\nsoil, at suitable depth, which will receive and conduct away the water\r\nwhich filters through the soil, it is obvious that a thousand expedients\r\nmay be resorted to, to suit the peculiar circumstances of persons. In\r\ngeneral, the danger to be apprehended is from obstruction of the\r\nwater-way. Nothing, except a tight tube of metal or wood, will be likely\r\nto prevent the admission of water.\r\n\r\nEconomy and durability are, perhaps, the main considerations. Tiles, at\r\nfair prices, combine these qualities better than anything else. Stones,\r\nhowever, are both cheap and durable, so far as the material is\r\nconcerned; but the durability of the material, and the durability of the\r\ndrains, are quite different matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINS OF STONES.\r\n\r\nProvidence has so liberally supplied the greater part of New England\r\nwith stones, that it seems to most inexperienced persons to be a work of\r\nsupererogation, almost, to manufacture tiles or any other draining\r\nmaterial for our farms.\r\n\r\nWe would by no means discourage the use of stones, where tiles cannot be\r\nused with greater economy. Stone drains are, doubtless, as efficient as\r\nany, so long as the water-way can be kept open. The material is often\r\nclose at hand, lying on the field and to be removed as a nuisance, if\r\nnot used in drainage. In such cases, true economy may dictate the use of\r\nthem, even where tiles can be procured; though, we believe, tiles will\r\nbe found generally cheaper, all things considered, where made in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the cost of drainage, we have undertaken to give fair\r\nestimates of the comparative cost of different materials.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer is capable of making estimates for himself, and of testing\r\nthose made by us, and so of determining what is true economy in his\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\nThe various modes of constructing drains of stones, may be readily shown\r\nby simple illustrations:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nIf stone-drains are decided upon, the mode of constructing them will\r\ndepend upon the kind of stone at hand. In some localities, round\r\npebble-stones are found scattered over the surface, or piled in heaps\r\nupon our farms; in others, flat, slaty stones abound, and in others,\r\nbroken stones from quarries may be more convenient. Of these, probably,\r\nthe least reliable is the drain filled with pebble-stones, or broken\r\nstones of small size. They are peculiarly liable to be obstructed,\r\nbecause there is no regular water-way, and the flow of the water must,\r\nof course, be very slow, impeded as it is by friction at all points with\r\nthe irregular surfaces.\r\n\r\nSand, and other obstructing substances, which find their way, more or\r\nless, into all drains, are deposited among the stones--the water having\r\nno force of current sufficient to carry them forward--and the drain is\r\nsoon filled up at some point, and ruined.\r\n\r\nMiles of such drains have been laid on many New England farms, at shoal\r\ndepths, of two or two and a half feet, and have in a few years failed.\r\nFor a time, their effect, to those unaccustomed to under-drainage, seems\r\nalmost miraculous. The wet field becomes dry, the wild grass gives place\r\nto clover and herds-grass, and the experiment is pronounced successful.\r\nAfter a few years, however, the wild grass re-appears, the water again\r\nstands on the surface, and it is ascertained, on examination, that the\r\ndrain is in some place packed solid with earth, and is filled with\r\nstagnant water.\r\n\r\nThe fault is by no means wholly in the material. In clay or hard pan,\r\nsuch a drain may be made durable, with proper care, but it must be laid\r\ndeep enough to be beyond the effect of the treading of cattle and of\r\nloaded teams, and the common action of frost. They can hardly be laid\r\nlow enough to be beyond the reach of our great enemy, the mole, which\r\nfollows relentlessly all our operations.\r\n\r\nWe recollect the remarks of Mr. Downing about the complaints in New\r\nEngland, of injury to fruit-trees by the gnawing of field-mice.\r\n\r\nHe said he should as soon think of danger from injury by giraffes as\r\nfield-mice, in his own neighborhood, though he had no doubt of their\r\ndepredations elsewhere!\r\n\r\nIt may seem to many, that we lay too much stress on this point, of\r\ndanger from moles and mice. We know whereof we do testify in this\r\nmatter. We verily believe that we never finished a drain of brush or\r\nstones, on our farm, ten rods long, that there was not a colony of these\r\n_varmint_ in the one end of it, before we had finished the other. If\r\nthese drains, however, are made three or four feet deep, and the solid\r\nearth rammed hard over the turf, which covers the stones, they will be\r\ncomparatively safe.\r\n\r\nThe figures 24 and 25 below, represent a mode of laying stone drains,\r\npracticed in Ireland, which will be found probably more convenient and\r\nsecure than any other method, for common small drains. A flat stone is\r\nset upright against one side of the ditch, which should be near the\r\nbottom, perpendicular. Another stone is set leaning against the first,\r\nwith its foot resting against the opposite bank. If the soil be soft\r\nclay, a flat stone may be placed first on the bottom of the ditch, for\r\nthe water to flow upon; but this will be found a great addition to the\r\nlabor, unless flat stones of peculiarly uniform shape and thickness are\r\nat hand. A board laid at the bottom will be usually far cheaper, and\r\nless liable to cause obstructions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 24, 25.--STONE DRAINS.]\r\n\r\nFigure 25 represents the ditch without the small stones above the duct.\r\nThese small stones are, in nine cases in ten, worse than useless, for\r\nthey are not only unnecessary to admit the water, but furnish a harbor\r\nfor mice and other vermin.\r\n\r\nDrawings, representing a filling of small stones above the duct, have\r\nbeen copied from one work to another for generations, and it seems never\r\nto have occurred, even to modern writers, that the small stones might be\r\nomitted. Any one, who knows anything of the present system of draining\r\nwith tiles, must perceive at once that, if we have the open triangular\r\nduct or the square culvert, the water cannot be kept from finding it, by\r\nany filling over it with such earth as is usually found in ditching.\r\nFormerly, when tiles were used, the ditch was filled above the tiles, to\r\nthe height of a foot or more, with broken stones; but this practice has\r\nbeen everywhere abandoned as expensive and useless.\r\n\r\nAn opening of any form, equal to a circle of two or three inches\r\ndiameter, will be sufficient in most cases, though the necessary size of\r\nthe duct must, of course, depend on the quantity of water which may be\r\nexpected to flow in it at the time of the greatest flood.\r\n\r\nWhatever the form of the stone drain, care should be taken to make the\r\njoints as close as possible, and turf, shavings, straw, tan, or some\r\nother material, should be carefully placed over the joints, to prevent\r\nthe washing in of sand, which is the worst enemy of all drains.\r\n\r\nIt is not deemed necessary to remark particularly upon the mode of\r\nlaying large drains for water-courses, with abutments and covering\r\nstones, forming a square duct, because it is the mode universally known\r\nand practiced. For small drains, in thorough-draining lands, it may,\r\nhowever, be remarked, that this is, perhaps, the most expensive of all\r\nmodes, because a much greater width of excavation is necessary in order\r\nto place in position the two side stones and leave the requisite space\r\nbetween them. That mode of drainage which requires the least excavation\r\nand the least carriage of materials, and consequently the least filling\r\nup and levelling, is usually the cheapest.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion as to stone drains is, that, at present, they may be, in\r\nmany cases, found useful and economical; and even where tiles are to be\r\nprocured at present prices stones may well be used, where materials are\r\nat hand, for the largest drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE WITH TILES.\r\n\r\n     What are Drain-Tiles?--Forms of Tiles.--Pipes.--Horse-shoe\r\n     Tiles.--Sole-Tiles--Form of Water-Passage.--Collars and their\r\n     Use.--Size of Pipes.--Velocity.--Friction.--Discharge of Water\r\n     through Pipes.--Tables of Capacity.--How Water enters Tiles.--Deep\r\n     Drains run soonest and longest.--Pressure of Water on\r\n     Pipes.--Durability of Tile Drains.--Drain-Bricks 100 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE DRAIN-TILES?\r\n\r\nThis would be an absurd question to place at the head of a division in a\r\nwork intended for the English public, for tiles are as common in England\r\nas bricks, and their forms and uses as familiar to all. But in America,\r\nthough tiles are used to a considerable extent in some localities,\r\nprobably not one farmer in one hundred in the whole country ever saw\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe author has recently received letters of inquiry about the use and\r\ncost of tiles, from which it is manifest that the writers have in their\r\nmind as tiles, the square bricks with which our grandfathers used to lay\r\ntheir hearths.\r\n\r\nIn Johnstone's _Report to the Board of Agriculture on Elkington's System\r\nof Draining_, published in England in 1797, the only kind of tiles or\r\nclay conduits described or alluded to by him, are what he calls\r\n\"draining-bricks,\" of which he gives drawings, which we transfer to our\r\npages precisely as found in the American edition. It will be seen to be\r\nas clumsy a contrivance as could well be devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--DRAINING-BRICKS.]\r\n\r\nSo lately as 1856, tiles were brought from Albany, N. Y., to Exeter, N. H.,\r\nnearly 300 miles, by railway, at a cost, including freight, of $25 a\r\nthousand for two-inch pipes, and it is believed that no tiles were ever\r\nmade in New Hampshire till the year 1857. These facts will soon become\r\ncuriosities in agricultural literature, and so are worth preserving.\r\nThey furnish excuse, too, for what may appear to learned agriculturists\r\nan unnecessary particularity in what might seem the well-known facts\r\nrelative to tile-drainage.\r\n\r\nDrain-tiles are made of clay of almost any quality that will make\r\nbricks, moulded by a machine into tubes, or into half-tube or horse-shoe\r\nforms, usually fourteen inches long before drying, and burnt in a\r\nfurnace or kiln to be about as hard as what are called hard-burnt\r\nbricks. They are usually moulded about half an inch in thickness,\r\nvarying with the size and form of the tile. The sizes vary from one inch\r\nto six inches, and sometimes larger, in the diameter of the bore. The\r\nforms are also very various; and as this is one of the most essential\r\nmatters, as affecting the efficiency, the cost, and the durability of\r\ntile-drainage, it will be well to give it critical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS OF TILES.\r\n\r\nThe simplest, cheapest, and best form of drain-tile is the cylinder, or\r\nmerely a tube, round outside and with a round bore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 27, 28, 29.--ROUND PIPES.]\r\n\r\nTiles of this form, and all others which are tubular, are called\r\n_pipes_, in distinction from those with open bottoms, like those of\r\nhorse-shoe form.\r\n\r\nAbout forty years ago, as Mr. Gisborne informs us, small pipes for\r\nland-drainage were used, concurrently, by persons residing in the\r\ncounties of Lincoln, Oxford, and Kent, who had, probably, no knowledge\r\nof each other's operations. Most of those pipes were made with\r\neyelet-holes, to admit the water. Pipes for thorough-draining excited no\r\ngeneral attention till they were exhibited by John Read at the show at\r\nDerby, in the year 1843. A medal was awarded to the exhibitor. Mr.\r\nParkes was one of the judges, and brought the pipes to the special\r\nnotice of the council. From this time, inventions and improvements were\r\nrapid, and soon, collars were introduced, and the use of improved\r\nmachines to mould the pipes; and drainage, under the fostering\r\ninfluence of the Royal Agricultural Society, became a subject of general\r\nattention throughout the kingdom. The round pipe, or _the pipe_, as it\r\nseems, _par excellence_, to be termed by English drainers, though one of\r\nthe latest, if not the last form of tiles introduced in England, has\r\nbecome altogether the most popular among scientific men, and is\r\ngenerally used in all works conducted under the charge of the Land\r\nDrainage Companies. This ought to settle the question for us, when we\r\nconsider that the immense sum of twenty millions of dollars of public\r\nfunds has been expended by them, in addition to vast amounts of private\r\nfunds, and that the highest practical talent of the nation is engaged in\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nAfter giving some idea of the various forms of tiles in use, it is,\r\nhowever, proposed to examine the question upon its merits, so that each\r\nmay judge for himself which is best.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of tiles introduced for the purpose of\r\nthorough-drainage, was the horse-shoe tile, so called from its shape.\r\nThe horse-shoe tile has been sometimes used without any sole to form the\r\nbottom of the drain, thus leaving the water to run on the ground. There\r\ncan hardly be a question of the false economy of this mode, for the\r\nhardest and most impervious soil softens under the constant action of\r\nrunning water, and then the edges of the tiles must sink, or the bottom\r\nof the drain rise, and thus destroy the work.\r\n\r\nVarious devices have been tried to save the expense of soles, such as\r\nproviding the edges of the tiles with flanges or using pieces of soles\r\non which to rest the ends of the tiles. They all leave the bottom of the\r\ndrain unprotected against the wearing action of the water.\r\n\r\nHORSE-SHOE TILES, or \"tops and bottoms\" as they are called in some\r\ncounties, are still much used in England; and in personal conversation\r\nwith farmers there, the writer found a strong opinion expressed in their\r\nfavor. The advantages claimed for the \"tops and bottoms\" are, that they\r\nlie firmly in place, and that they admit the water more freely than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe objections to them are, that they are more expensive than round\r\npipes, and are not so strong, and are not so easily laid, and that they\r\ndo not discharge water so well as tiles with a round bore. In laying\r\nthem, they should be made to rest partly upon two adjoining soles, or to\r\nbreak bond, as it is called. The soles are made separate from the tiles,\r\nand are merely flat pieces, of sufficient width to support firmly both\r\nedges of the tiles. The soles are usually an inch wider than the tiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30--HORSE-SHOE TILES AND SOLES.]\r\n\r\nThe above figure represents the horse-shoe tiles and soles properly\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nAs this form of tile has been generally used by the most successful\r\ndrainers in New York, it may be well to cite the high authority of Mr.\r\nGisborne for the objections which have been suggested. It should be\r\nrecollected in this connection, that the drainage in this country has\r\nbeen what in England would be called shallow, and that it is too recent\r\nto have borne the test of time.\r\n\r\nMr. Gisborne says:\r\n\r\n     \"We shall shock and surprise many of our readers, when we state\r\n     confidently that, in average soils, and still more in those which\r\n     are inclined to be tender, horse-shoe tiles form the weakest and\r\n     most failing conduit which has ever been used for a deep drain. It\r\n     is so, however; and a little thought, even if we had no experience,\r\n     will tell us that it must be so.\r\n\r\n     \"A horse-shoe tile, which may be a tolerably secure conduit in a\r\n     drain of 2 feet, in one of 4 feet becomes an almost certain\r\n     failure. As to the longitudinal fracture, not only is the tile\r\n     subject to be broken by one of those slips which are so troublesome\r\n     in deep draining, and to which the lightly-filled material, even\r\n     when the drain is completed, offers an imperfect resistance, but\r\n     the constant pressure together of the sides, even when it does not\r\n     produce a fracture of the soil, catches hold of the feet of the\r\n     tile, and breaks it through the crown. When the Regent's Park was\r\n     first drained, large conduits were in fashion, and they were made\r\n     circular by placing one horse-shoe tile upon another. It would be\r\n     difficult to invent a weaker conduit. On re-drainage, innumerable\r\n     instances were found in which the upper tile was broken through the\r\n     crown and had dropped into the lower.\"\r\n\r\nAnother form of tiles, called _sole-tiles_, or _sole-pipes_, is much\r\nused in America, more indeed than any other, except perhaps the\r\nhorse-shoe tile; probably, because the first manufacturers fancied them\r\nthe best, and offered no others in the market.\r\n\r\nIn this form, the sole is solid with the tile. The bottom is flat, but\r\nthe bore is round, or oval, or egg-shaped, with the small end of the\r\norifice downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31--SOLE-TILE.]\r\n\r\nThe sole-pipe has considerable advantages theoretically. The opening or\r\nbore is of the right shape, the bottom lies fair and firm in place, and\r\nthe drain, indeed, is perfect, if carefully and properly laid.\r\n\r\nThe objections to the sole-pipes are, that they are somewhat more\r\nexpensive than round pipes, and that they require great care in placing\r\nthem, so as to make the passage even from one pipe to another.\r\n\r\nA slight depression of one side of a pipe of this kind, especially if\r\nthe bore be oval or egg-shaped, throws the water passage out of line. In\r\nlaying them, the author has taken the precaution to place under each\r\njoint a thin piece of wood, such as our honest shoe manufacturers use\r\nfor stiffening in shoes, to keep the bottoms of the pipes even, at\r\nleast until the ground has settled compactly, and as much longer as they\r\nmay escape \"decay's effacing finger.\"\r\n\r\nCOLLARS for tiles are used wherever a sudden descent occurs in the\r\ncourse of a drain, or where there is a loose sand or a boggy place, and\r\nby many persons they are used in all drains through sandy or gravelly\r\nland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--PIPES AND COLLAR.]\r\n\r\nThe above figure represents pipe-tiles fitted with collars. Collars are\r\nmerely short sections of pipes of such size as to fit upon the smaller\r\nones loosely, covering the joint, and holding the ends in place, so that\r\nthey cannot slip past each other. In very bad places, small pipes may be\r\nentirely sheathed in larger ones; and this is advisable in steep\r\ndescents or flowing sands.\r\n\r\nA great advantage in round pipes is, that there is no wrong-side-up to\r\nthem, and they are, therefore, more readily placed in position than\r\ntiles of any other form.\r\n\r\nAgain: all tiles are more or less warped in drying and burning; and,\r\nwhere it is desired to make perfect work, round pipes may be turned so\r\nas to make better joints and a straighter run for the water--which is\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\nIf collars are used, there is still less difficulty in adjusting the\r\npipes so as to make the lines straight, and far less danger of\r\nobstruction by sand or roots. Indeed, it is believed that no drain can\r\nbe made more perfect than with round pipes and collars.\r\n\r\nAs it is believed that few collars have ever yet been used in this\r\ncountry, and the best drainers in England are not agreed as to the\r\nnecessity of using them, we give the opinions of two or three\r\ndistinguished gentlemen, in their own language. Mr. Gisborne says:\r\n\r\n     \"We were astounded to find, at the conclusion of Mr. Parkes'\r\n     Newcastle Lecture, this sentence: 'It may be advisable for me to\r\n     say, that in clays, and other clean-cutting and firm-bottomed\r\n     soils, I do not find the collars to be indispensably necessary,\r\n     although I always prefer their use.' This is a barefaced treachery\r\n     to pipes, an abandonment of the strongest point in their case--the\r\n     assured continuity of the conduit. Every one may see how very small\r\n     a disturbance at their point of junction would dissociate two pipes\r\n     of one inch diameter. One finds a soft place in the bottom of the\r\n     drain and dips his nose into it one inch deep, and cocks up his\r\n     other end. By this simple operation, the continuity of the conduit\r\n     is twice broken. An inch of lateral motion produces the same\r\n     effect. Pipes of a larger diameter than two inches are generally\r\n     laid without collars. This is a practice on which we do not look\r\n     with much complacency; it is the compromise between cost and\r\n     security, to which the affairs of men are so often compelled. No\r\n     doubt, a conduit from three to six inches in diameter is much less\r\n     subject to a breach in its continuity than one which is smaller;\r\n     but, when no collars are used, the pipes should be laid with\r\n     extreme care, and the bed which is prepared for them at the bottom\r\n     of the drain should be worked to their size and shape with great\r\n     accuracy.\r\n\r\n     \"To one advantage which is derived from the use of collars we have\r\n     not yet adverted--the increased facility with which free water\r\n     existing in the soil can find entrance into the conduit.\r\n\r\n     \"The collar for a one and a half inch pipe has a circumference of\r\n     nine inches. The whole space between the collar and the pipe, on\r\n     each side of the collar, is open, and affords no resistance to the\r\n     entrance of water: while, at the same time, the superincumbent arch\r\n     of the collar protects the junction of two pipes from the intrusion\r\n     of particles of soil. We confess to some original misgivings, that\r\n     a pipe resting only on an inch at each end, and lying hollow, might\r\n     prove weak, and liable to fracture by weight pressing on it from\r\n     above; but the fear was illusory. Small particles of soil trickle\r\n     down the sides of every drain, and the first flow of water will\r\n     deposit them in the vacant space between the two collars. The\r\n     bottom, if at all soft, will also swell up into any vacancy.\r\n     Practically, if you re-open a drain well laid with pipes and\r\n     collars, you will find them reposing in a beautiful nidus, which,\r\n     when they are carefully removed, looks exactly as if it had been\r\n     moulded for them.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the danger of breaking the pipes, which might well be apprehended,\r\nwe found by actual experiment, at the New York Central Park, that a\r\none-inch Albany pipe resting on collars upon a floor, with a bearing at\r\neach end of but one inch, would support the weight of a man weighing 160\r\npounds, standing on one foot on the middle of the pipe.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes sums up his opinion upon the subject of collars, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     \"It may be advisable for me to say, that in clays, and other\r\n     clean-cutting and firm-bottomed soils, I do not find collars to be\r\n     at all necessary; but that they are essential in all sandy, loose,\r\n     and soft strata.\"\r\n\r\nIn draining in the neighborhood of trees, collars are also supposed to\r\nbe of great use in preventing the intrusion of roots into the pipes,\r\nalthough it may be impossible, even in this way, to exclude the roots of\r\nwater-loving trees.\r\n\r\nFrom the most careful inquiry that the writer was able to make, as to\r\nthe practice in England, he is satisfied that collars are not generally\r\nused there in the drainage of clays, but that the pipes are laid in\r\nopenings shaped for them at the bottom of the drains, with a tool which\r\nforms a groove into which the pipes fall readily into line, and very\r\nlittle seems to be said of collars in the published estimates of the\r\ncost of drainage.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, we have the opinion of Mr. Denton, thus expressed:\r\n\r\n     \"The use of collars is by no means general, although those who have\r\n     used them speak highly of their advantages. Except in sandy soils,\r\n     and in those that are subject to sudden alteration of character, in\r\n     some of the deposits of red sand-stones, and in the clayey subsoils\r\n     of the Bagshot sand district, for instance, collars are not found\r\n     to be essential to good drainage. In the north of England they are\r\n     used but seldom, and, in my opinion, much less than they ought to\r\n     be; but this opinion, it is right to state, is opposed, in numerous\r\n     instances of successful drainage, by men of extensive practice; and\r\n     as every cause of increased outlay is to be avoided, the value of\r\n     collars, as general appliances, remains an open question. In all\r\n     the more porous subsoils in which collars have not been used, the\r\n     more successful drainers increase the size of the pipes in the\r\n     minor drains to a minimum size of two inches bore.\"\r\n\r\n_The form of the bore, or water passage_, in tiles, is a point of more\r\nimportance than at first appears. At one of our colleges, certain plank\r\nsewers, in the ordinary square form, were often obstructed by the\r\nsediment from the dirty water. \"Turn them cornerwise,\" suggested the\r\nprofessor of Natural Philosophy. It was done, and ever after they kept\r\nin order. The pressure of water depends on its height, or head.\r\nEverybody knows that six feet of water carries a mill-wheel better than\r\none foot. The same principle operates on a small scale. An inch head of\r\nwater presses harder than a half inch. The _velocity_ of water, again,\r\ndepends much on its height. Whether there be much or little water\r\npassing through a drain, it has manifestly a greater power to make its\r\nway, to drive before it sand or other obstructions, when it is heaped up\r\nin a round passage, than when wandering over the flat surface of a tile\r\nsole. Any one who has observed the discharge of water from flat-bottomed\r\nand round tiles, will be satisfied that the quantity of water which is\r\nsufficient to run in a rapid stream of a half or quarter inch diameter\r\nfrom a round tile, will lazily creep along the flat bottom of a sole\r\ntile, with hardly force sufficient to turn aside a grain of sand, or to\r\nbring back to light an enterprising cricket that may have entered on an\r\nexploration. On the whole, solid tiles, with flat-bottomed passages, may\r\nbe set down among the inventions of the adversary. They have not the\r\nclaims even of the horse-shoe form to respect, because they do not admit\r\nwater better than round pipes, and are not united by a sole on which the\r\nends of the adjoining tiles rest. They combine the faults of all other\r\nforms, with the peculiar virtues of none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33--FLAT-BOTTOMED PIPE-TILE.]\r\n\r\nFrom an English report on the drainage of towns, the following, which\r\nillustrates this point, is taken:\r\n\r\n     \"It was found that a large proportion of sewers were constructed\r\n     with flat bottoms, which, when there was a small discharge, spread\r\n     the water, increased the friction, retarded the flow, and\r\n     accumulated deposit. It was ascertained, that by the substitution\r\n     of circular sewers of the same width, with the same inclination and\r\n     the same run of water, the amount of deposit was reduced more than\r\n     one-half.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIZE OF TILES.\r\n\r\nIs a matter of much importance, whether we regard the efficiency and\r\ndurability of our work, or economy in completing it. The cost of tiles,\r\nand the freight of them, increase rapidly with their size, and it is,\r\ntherefore, well to use the smallest that will effect the object in view.\r\nTiles should be large enough, as a first proposition, to carry off, in a\r\nreasonable time, all the surplus water that may fall upon the land.\r\nHere, the English rules will not be safe for us; for, although England\r\nhas many more rainy days than we have, yet we have, in general, a\r\ngreater fall of rain--more inches of water from the clouds in the year.\r\nInstead of their eternal drizzle, we have thunder showers in Summer, and\r\nin Spring and Autumn north-east storms, when the windows of heaven are\r\nopened, and a deluge, except in duration, bursts upon us. Then, at the\r\nNorth, the Winter snows cover the fields until April, when they suddenly\r\ndissolve, often under heavy showers of rain, and planting time is at\r\nonce upon us. It is desirable that all the snow and rain-water should\r\npass through the soil into the drains, instead of overflowing the\r\nsurface, so as to save the elements of fertility with which such water\r\nabounds, and also to prevent the washing of the soil. We require, then,\r\na greater capacity of drainage, larger tiles, than do the English, for\r\nour drains must do a greater work than theirs, and in less time.\r\n\r\nThere are several other general considerations that should be noticed,\r\nbefore we attempt to define the particular size for any location.\r\nSeveral small drains are usually discharged into one main drain. This\r\nmain should have sufficient capacity to conduct all the water that may\r\nbe expected to enter it, and no more. If the small drains overflow it,\r\nthe main will be liable to be burst, or the land about it filled with\r\nwater, gushing from it at the joints; especially, if the small drains\r\ncome down a hill side, so as to give a great pressure, or head of water.\r\nOn the other hand, if the main be larger than is necessary, there is the\r\nuseless expense of larger tiles than were required. The capacity of\r\npipes to convey water, depends, other things being equal, upon their\r\nsize; but here the word size has a meaning which should be kept clearly\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of round water-pipes is in proportion to the squares of\r\ntheir diameters.\r\n\r\nA one-inch pipe carries one inch (circular, not square) of water, but a\r\ntwo-inch pipe carries not two inches only, but twice two, or four inches\r\nof water; a three-inch pipe carries three times three, or nine inches;\r\nand a four-inch pipe, sixteen inches. Thus we see, that under the same\r\nconditions as to fall, directness, smoothness, and the like, a four-inch\r\npipe carries just four times as much water as a two-inch pipe. In fact,\r\nit will carry more than this proportion, because _friction_, which is an\r\nimportant element in all such calculations, is greater in proportion to\r\nthe smaller size of the pipe.\r\n\r\nVELOCITY is another essential element to be noticed in determining the\r\namount of water which may be discharged through a pipe of given\r\ndiameter. Velocity, again, depends on several conditions. Water runs\r\nfaster down a steep hill than down a gentle declivity. This is due to\r\nthe weight of the water, or, in other words, to gravitation, and\r\noperates whether the water be at large on the ground, or confined in a\r\npipe, and it operates alike whether the water in a pipe fill its bore or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nBut, again, the velocity of water in a pipe depends on the pressure, or\r\nhead of water, behind it, and there is, perhaps, no definite limit to\r\nthe quantity of water that may be forced through a given orifice. More\r\nwater, for instance, is often forced through the pipe of a fire-engine\r\nin full play, in ten minutes, than would run through a pipe of the same\r\ndiameter, lying nearly level in the ground, in ten hours.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary aqueducts, for supplying water, and not for drainage, it is\r\ndesirable to have a high pressure upon the pipes to ensure a rapid flow;\r\nbut in drainage, a careful distinction must be made between velocity\r\ninduced by gravitation, and velocity induced by pressure. If induced by\r\nthe former merely, the pipe through which the water is swiftly running,\r\nif not quite full, may still receive water at every joint, while, if the\r\nvelocity be induced by pressure, the pipe must be already full. It can\r\nthen receive no more, and must lose water at the joints, and wet the\r\nland through which it passes, instead of draining it.\r\n\r\nSo that although we should find that the mains might carry a vast\r\nquantity of water admitted by minor drains from high elevations, yet we\r\nshould bear in mind, that drains when full can perform no ordinary\r\noffice of drainage. If there is more than the pressure of four feet head\r\nof water behind; the pipes, if they passed through a pond of water, at\r\nfour feet deep, must lose and not receive water at the joints.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of a pipe to convey water depends, then, not only on its\r\nsize, but on its inclination or fall--a pipe running down a considerable\r\ndescent having much greater capacity than one of the same size lying\r\nnearly level. This fact should be borne in mind even in laying single\r\ndrains; for it is obvious that if the drain lie along a sandy plain,\r\nfor instance, extending down a springy hill-side, and then, as is\r\nusually the case, along a lower plain again, to its outlet at some\r\nstream, it may collect as much water as will fill it before it reaches\r\nthe lower level. Its stream rushes swiftly down the descent, and when it\r\nreaches the plain, there is not sufficient fall to carry it away by its\r\nnatural gravitation. It will still rush onward to its outlet, urged by\r\nthe pressure from behind; but, with such pressure, it will, as we have\r\nseen, instead of draining the land, suffuse it with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRICTION,\r\n\r\nas has already been suggested, is an element that much interferes with\r\nexact calculations as to the relative capacity of water-pipes of various\r\ndimensions, and this depends upon several circumstances, such as\r\nsmoothness, and exactness of form, and directness. The smoother, the\r\nmore regular in form, and the straighter the drain, the more water will\r\nit convey. Thus, in some recent English experiments,\r\n\r\n     \"it was found that, with pipes of the same diameter, exactitude of\r\n     form was of more importance than smoothness of surface; that glass\r\n     pipes, which had a wavy surface, discharged less water, at the same\r\n     inclinations, than Staffordshire stone-ware clay pipes, which were\r\n     of perfectly exact construction. By passing pipes of the same\r\n     clay--the common red clay--under a second pressure, obtained by a\r\n     machine at an extra expense of about eighteen pence per thousand,\r\n     whilst the pipe was half dry, very superior exactitude of form was\r\n     obtained, and by means of this exactitude, and with nearly the same\r\n     diameters, an increased discharge of water of one-fourth was\r\n     effected within the same time.\"\r\n\r\nSo all sudden turns or angles increase friction and retard velocity, and\r\nthus lessen the capacity of the drain--a topic which may be more\r\nproperly considered under the head of the junction of drains.\r\n\r\n     \"On a large scale, it was found that when equal quantities of water\r\n     were running direct, at a rate of 90 seconds, with a turn at\r\n     right-angles, the discharge was only effected in 140 seconds;\r\n     whilst, with a turn or junction with a gentle curve, the discharge\r\n     was effected in 100 seconds.\"\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Messrs. Shedd & Edson for the following valuable\r\ntables showing the capacity of water-pipes, with the accompanying\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"DISCHARGE OF WATER THROUGH PIPES.\r\n\r\n     \"The following tables of discharge are founded on the experiments\r\n     made by Mr. Smeaton, and have been compared with those by Henry\r\n     Law, and with the rules of Weisbach and D'Aubuisson. The conditions\r\n     under which such experiments are made may be so essentially\r\n     different in each case, that few experiments give results\r\n     coincident with each other, or with the deductions of theory: and\r\n     in applying these tables to practice, it is quite likely that the\r\n     discharge of a pipe of a certain area, at a certain inclination,\r\n     may be quite unlike the discharge found to be due to those\r\n     conditions by this table, and that difference may be owing partly\r\n     to greater or less roughness on the inside of the pipe, unequal\r\n     flow of water through the joints into the pipe, crookedness of the\r\n     pipes, want of accuracy in their being placed, so that the fall may\r\n     not be uniform throughout, or the ends of the pipes may be shoved a\r\n     little to one side, so that the continuity of the channel is\r\n     partially broken; and, indeed, from various other causes, all of\r\n     which may occur in any practical case, unless great care is taken\r\n     to avoid it, and some of which may occur in almost any case.\r\n\r\n     \"We have endeavored to so construct the tables that, in the\r\n     ordinary practice of draining, the discharge given may approximate\r\n     to the truth for a well laid drain, subject even to considerable\r\n     friction. The experiments of Mr. Smeaton, which we have adopted as\r\n     the basis of these tables, gave a less quantity discharged, under\r\n     certain conditions, than given under similar conditions by other\r\n     tables. This result is probably due to a greater amount of friction\r\n     in the pipes used by Smeaton. The curves of friction resemble, very\r\n     nearly, parabolic curves, but are not quite so sharp near the\r\n     origin.\r\n\r\n     \"We propose, during the coming season, to institute some careful\r\n     experiments, to ascertain the friction due to our own drain-pipe.\r\n     Water can get into the drain-pipe very freely at the joints, as may\r\n     be seen by a simple calculation. It is impossible to place the ends\r\n     so closely together, in laying, as to make a tight joint on account\r\n     of roughness in the clay, twisting in burning, &c.; and the opening\r\n     thus made will usually average about one-tenth of an inch on the\r\n     whole circumference, which is, on the inside of a two-inch pipe,\r\n     six inches--making six-tenths of a square inch opening for the\r\n     entrance of water at each joint.\r\n\r\n     \"In a lateral drain 200 feet long, the pipes being thirteen inches\r\n     long, there will be 184 joints, each joint having an opening of\r\n     six-tenth square inch area; in 184 joints there is an aggregate\r\n     area of 110 square inches; the area of the opening at the end of a\r\n     two-inch pipe is about three inches; 110 square inches inlet to\r\n     three inches outlet; thirty-seven times as much water can flow in\r\n     as can flow out. There is, then, no need for the water to go\r\n     through the pores of the pipe; and the fact is, we think, quite\r\n     fortunate, for the passage of water through the pores would in no\r\n     case be sufficient to benefit the land to much extent. We tried an\r\n     experiment, by stopping one end of an ordinary drain-pipe and\r\n     filling it with water. At the end of sixty-five hours, water still\r\n     stood in the pipe three-fourths of an inch deep. About half the\r\n     water first put into the pipe had run out at the end of twenty-four\r\n     hours. If the pipe was stopped at both ends and plunged four feet\r\n     deep in water, it would undoubtedly fill in a short time; but such\r\n     a test is an unfair one, for no drain could be doing service, over\r\n     which water could collect to the depth of four feet.\"\r\n\r\n                          1-1/2-INCH  DRAIN-PIPE.\r\n                           Area: 1.76709 inches.\r\n

====================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WATER ENTERS THE TILES.\r\n\r\nHow water enters the tiles, is a question which all persons unaccustomed\r\nto the operation of tile-draining usually ask at the outset. In brief,\r\nit may be answered, that it enters both at the joints and through the\r\npores of the burnt clay, but mostly at the joints.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes expresses the opinion, based upon careful observation, that\r\nfive hundred times as much water enters at the crevices as through the\r\npores of the tiles! If this be so, we may as well, for all practical\r\npurposes, regard the water as all entering at the joints. In several\r\nexperiments which we have attempted, we have found the quantity of water\r\nthat enters through the pores to be quite too small to be of much\r\npractical account.\r\n\r\nTiles differ so much in porosity, that it is difficult to make\r\nexperiments that can be satisfactory--soft-burnt tiles being, like pale\r\nbricks, quite pervious, and hard-burnt tiles being nearly or quite\r\nimpervious. The amount of pressure upon the clay in moulding also\r\naffects the density and porosity of tiles.\r\n\r\nWater should enter at the bottom of the tiles, and not at the top. It is\r\na well-known fact in draining, that the deepest drain flows first and\r\nlongest. A familiar illustration will make this point evident. If a cask\r\nor deep box be filled with sand, with one hole near the bottom and\r\nanother half way to the top, these holes will represent the tiles in a\r\ndrain. If water be poured into the sand, it will pass downward to the\r\nbottom of the vessel, and will not flow out of either hole till the sand\r\nbe saturated up to the lower hole, and then it will flow out there. If,\r\nnow, water be poured in faster than the lower hole can discharge it, the\r\nvessel will be filled higher, till it will run out at both holes. It is\r\nmanifest, however, that it will first cease to flow from the upper\r\norifice. There is in the soil a line of water, called the \"water-line,\"\r\nor \"water-table;\" and this, in drained land, is at about the level of\r\nthe bottom of the tiles. As the rain falls it descends, as in the\r\nvessel; and as the water rises, it enters the tiles at the bottom, and\r\nnever at the top, unless there is more than can pass out of the soil by\r\nthe lower openings (the crevices and pores) into the tiles. It is well\r\nalways to interrupt the direct descent of water by percolation from the\r\nsurface to the top of the tiles, because, in passing so short a distance\r\nin the soil, the water is not sufficiently filtered, especially in soil\r\nso recently disturbed, but is likely to carry with it not only valuable\r\nelements of fertility, but also particles of sand, which may obstruct\r\nthe drain. This is prevented by placing above the tiles (after they are\r\ncovered a few inches with gravel, sand, or other porous soil) compact\r\nclay, if convenient. If not, a furrow each side of the drain, or a\r\nheaping-up of the soil over the drain, when finished, will turn aside\r\nthe surface-water, and prevent such injury.\r\n\r\nIn the estimates as to the area of the openings between pipes, it should\r\nbe considered that the spaces between the pipes are not, in fact, clean\r\nopenings of one-tenth of an inch, but are partially closed by earthy\r\nparticles, and that water enters them by no means as rapidly as it would\r\nenter the clean pipes before they are covered. Although the rain-fall in\r\nEngland is much less in quantity and much more regular than in this\r\ncountry, yet it is believed that the use of two-inch pipes will be found\r\nabundantly sufficient for the admission and conveyance of any quantity\r\nof water that it may be necessary to carry off by drainage in common\r\nsoils. In extraordinary cases, as where the land drained is a swamp, or\r\nreservoir for water which falls on the hills around, larger pipes must\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nIn many places in England \"tops and bottoms,\" or horse-shoe tiles, are\r\nstill preferred by farmers, upon the idea that they admit the water more\r\nreadily; but their use is continued only by those who have never made\r\ntrial of pipes. No scientific drainer uses any but pipes in England, and\r\nthe million of acres well drained with them, is pretty good evidence of\r\ntheir sufficiency. In this country, horse-shoe tiles have been much used\r\nin Western New York, and have been found to answer a good purpose; and\r\nso it may be said of the sole-pipes. Indeed, it is believed that no\r\ninstance is to be found on record in America of the failure of tile\r\ndrains, from the inability of the water to gain admission at the joints.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting in this connection to state, that water is 815\r\ntimes heavier than air. Here is a drain at four feet depth in the\r\nground, filled only with air, and open at the end so that the air can go\r\nout. Above this open space is four feet of earth saturated with water.\r\nWhat is the pressure of the water upon the tiles?\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Arkell, in a communication to the Society of Arts, in\r\nEngland, says--\r\n\r\n     \"The pressure due to a head of water four or five feet, may be\r\n     imagined from the force with which water will come through the\r\n     crevices of a hatch with that depth of water above it. Now, there\r\n     is the same pressure of water to enter the vacuum in the pipe-drain\r\n     as there is against the hatches, supposing the land to be full of\r\n     water to the surface.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to demonstrate the truth of this theory; but the same\r\nopinion has been expressed to the writer by persons of learning and of\r\npractical skill, based upon observations as to the entrance of water\r\ninto gas pipes, from which it is almost, if not quite, impossible to\r\nexclude it by the most perfect joints in iron pipes. Whatever be the\r\ntheory as to pressure, or the difficulties as to the water percolating\r\nthrough compact soils to the tiles, there will be no doubt left on the\r\nmind of any one, after one experiment tried in the field, that, in\r\ncommon cases, all the surplus water that reaches the tiles is freely\r\nadmitted. A gentleman, who has commenced draining his farm, recently, in\r\nNew Hampshire, expressed to the author his opinion, that tiles in his\r\nland admitted the water as freely as a hole of a similar size to the\r\nbore of the tile would admit it, if it could be kept open through the\r\nsoil without the tile.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURABILITY OF TILE DRAINS.\r\n\r\nHow long will they last? This is the first and most important question.\r\nMen, who have commenced with open ditches, and, having become disgusted\r\nwith the deformity, the inconvenience, and the inefficiency of them,\r\nhave then tried bushes, and boards, and turf, and found them, too,\r\nperishable; and again have used stones, and after a time seen them fail,\r\nthrough obstructions caused by moles or frost--these men have the right\r\nto a well-considered answer to this question.\r\n\r\nThe foolish fellow in the Greek Reader, who, having heard that a crow\r\nwould live a hundred years, purchased one to verify the saying, probably\r\ndid not live long enough to ascertain that it was true. How long a\r\nproperly laid tile-drain of hard-burnt tiles will endure, has not been\r\ndefinitely ascertained, but it is believed that it will outlast the life\r\nof him who lays it.\r\n\r\nNo tiles have been long enough laid in the United States to test this\r\nquestion by experience, and in England no further result seems to have\r\nbeen arrived at, than that the work is a _permanent_ improvement.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this treatise, may be found some account of Land\r\nDrainage Companies, and of Government loans in aid of improvements by\r\ndrainage in Great Britain. One of these acts provides for a charge on\r\nthe land for such improvements, to be paid in full in fifty years. That\r\nis to say, the expense of the drainage is an incumbrance like a mortgage\r\non the land, at a certain rate of interest, and the tenant or occupant\r\nof the land, each year pays the interest and enough more to discharge\r\nthe debt in just fifty years. Thus, it is assumed by the Government,\r\nthat the improvement will last fifty years in its full operation,\r\nbecause the last year of the fifty pays precisely the same as every\r\nother year.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be considered as the settled conviction of all branches\r\nof the British government, and of all the best-informed, practical\r\nland-drainers in that country, that TILE-DRAINAGE WILL ENDURE FIFTY\r\nYEARS AT LEAST, if properly executed.\r\n\r\nThis is long enough to satisfy any American; for the migratory habits of\r\nour citizens, and the constant changes of cultivated fields into village\r\nand city lots, prevent our imagination even conceiving the idea that we\r\nor our posterity can remain for half a century upon the same farm.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier, however, to lay tile-drains so that they will not be\r\nof use half of fifty years, than to make them permanent in their effect.\r\nTile-drainage, it cannot be too much enforced, is an operation requiring\r\ngreat care and considerable skill--altogether more care and skill than\r\nour common laborers, or even most of our farmers, are accustomed to\r\nexercise in their farm operations.\r\n\r\nA blunder in draining, like the blunder of a physician, may be soon\r\nconcealed by the grass that grows over it, but can never be corrected.\r\nDrainage is a new art in this country, and tile-making is a new art.\r\nWithout good, hard-burnt tiles, no care or skill can make permanent\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTile-drainage will endure so long as the tiles last, if the work be\r\nproperly done.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why a tile should not last in the ground as long as a\r\nbrick will last. Bricks will fall to pieces in the ground in a very\r\nshort time if not hard-burnt, while hard-burnt bricks of good clay will\r\nlast as long as granite.\r\n\r\nTiles must be hard-burnt in order to endure. But this is not all. Drains\r\nfail from various other causes than the crumbling of the tiles. They are\r\nfrequently obstructed by mice, moles, frogs, and vermin of all kinds, if\r\nnot protected at the outlet. They are often destroyed by the treading of\r\ncattle, and by the deposit of mud at the outlet, through insufficient\r\ncare. They are liable to be filled with sand, through want of care in\r\nprotecting the joints in laying, and through want of collars, and other\r\nmeans of keeping them in line. They are liable, too, to fill up by\r\ndeposits of sand and the like, by being laid lower in some places than\r\nthe parts nearer the outlet, so that the slack places catch and retain\r\nwhatever is brought down, till the pipe is filled.\r\n\r\nFROST is an enemy which in this country we have to contend with, more\r\nthan in any other, where tile-drainage has been much practiced.\r\n\r\nUpon all these points, remarks will be found under the appropriate\r\nheads; and these suggestions are repeated here, because we know that\r\nhaste and want of skill are likely to do much injury to the cause which\r\nwe advocate. Any work that requires only energy and progress, is safe in\r\nAmerican hands; but cautious and slow operations are by no means to\r\ntheir taste.\r\n\r\nDickens says, that on railways and coaches, wherever in England they\r\nsay, \"All right,\" the Americans use, instead, the phrase, \"Go ahead.\" In\r\ntile-drainage, the motto, \"All right,\" will be found far more safe than\r\nthe motto, \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nInstances are given in England of drains laid with handmade tiles, which\r\nhave operated well for thirty years, and have not yet failed.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes informs us: \"That, about 1804, pipe-tiles made tapering, with\r\none end entering the other, and two inches in the smallest point, were\r\nlaid down in the park now possessed by Sir Thomas Whichcote, Aswarby,\r\nLincolnshire, and that they still act well.\"\r\n\r\nStephens gives the following instance of the durability of bricks used\r\nin draining:\r\n\r\n     \"Of the durability of common brick, when used in drains, there is a\r\n     remarkable instance mentioned by Mr. George Guthrie, factor to the\r\n     Earl of Stair or Calhoun, Wigtonshire. In the execution of modern\r\n     draining on that estate, some brick-drains, on being intersected,\r\n     emitted water very freely. According to documents which refer to\r\n     these drains, it appears that they had been formed by the\r\n     celebrated Marshal, Earl Stair, _upwards of a hundred years ago_.\r\n     They were found between the vegetable mould and the clay upon which\r\n     it rested, between the 'wet and the dry,' as the country phrase has\r\n     it, and about thirty-one inches below the surface. They presented\r\n     two forms--one consisting of two bricks set asunder on edge, and\r\n     the other two laid lengthways across them, leaving between them an\r\n     opening of four inches square for water, but having no soles. The\r\n     bricks had not sunk in the least through the sandy clay bottom upon\r\n     which they rested, as they were three inches broad. The other form\r\n     was of two bricks laid side by side, as a sole, with two others\r\n     built or laid on each other, at both sides, upon the solid ground,\r\n     and covered with flat stones, the building being packed on each\r\n     side of the drain with broken bricks.\"\r\n\r\nIn our chapter upon the \"Obstruction of Drains,\" the various causes\r\nwhich operate against the permanency of drains, are more fully\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION, DISTANCE, AND DEPTH OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\n     DIRECTION OF DRAINS.--Whence comes the Water?--Inclination of\r\n     Strata.--Drains across the Slope let Water out as well as Receive\r\n     it.--Defence against Water from Higher Land.--Open\r\n     Ditches.--Headers.--Silt-basins.\r\n\r\n     DISTANCE OF DRAINS.--Depends on Soil, Depth, Climate, Prices,\r\n     System.--Conclusions as to Distance.\r\n\r\n     DEPTH OF DRAINS.--Greatly Increases Cost.--Shallow Drains first\r\n     tried in England.--10,000 Miles of Shallow Drains laid in Scotland\r\n     by way of Education.--Drains must be below Subsoil plow, and\r\n     Frost.--Effect of Frost on Tiles and Aqueducts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTION OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\nWhether drains should run up and down the slope of the hill, or directly\r\nacross it, or in a diagonal line as a compromise between the first two,\r\nare questions which beginners in the art and mystery of drainage usually\r\ndiscuss with great zeal. It seems so plain to one man, at the first\r\nglance, that, in order to catch the water that is running down under the\r\nsoil upon the subsoil, from the top of the hill to the bottom, you must\r\ncut a ditch across the current, that he sees no occasion to examine the\r\nquestion farther. Another, whose idea is, to catch the water in his\r\ndrain before it rises to the surface, as it is passing up from below or\r\nrunning along on the subsoil, and keep it from rising higher than the\r\nbottom of his ditch, thinks it quite as obvious that the drains should\r\nrun up and down the slope, that the water, once entering, may remain in\r\nthe drain, going directly down hill to the outlet. A third hits on the\r\nKeythorpe system, and regarding the water as flowing down the slope,\r\nunder the soil, in certain natural channels in the subsoil, fancies they\r\nmay best be cut off by drains, in the nature of mains, running\r\ndiagonally across the slope.\r\n\r\nThese different ideas of men, if examined, will be found to result\r\nmainly from their different notions of the underground circulation of\r\nwater. In considering the Theory of Moisture, an attempt was made to\r\nsuggest the different causes of the wetness of land.\r\n\r\nTo drain land effectually, we must have a correct idea of the sources of\r\nthe water that makes the particular field too wet; whether it falls from\r\nthe clouds directly upon it; or whether it falls on land situated above\r\nit and sloping towards it, so that the water runs down, as upon a roof,\r\nfrom other fields or slopes to our own; or whether it gushes up in\r\nsprings which find vent in particular spots, and so is diffused through\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nIf we have only to take care of the water that falls on our own field,\r\nfrom the clouds, that is quite a different matter from draining the\r\nwhole adjoining region, and requires a different mode of operation. If\r\nyour field is in the middle, or at the foot, of an undrained slope, from\r\nwhich the water runs on the surface over your land, or soaks through it\r\ntoward some stream or swamp below, provision must be made not only for\r\ndrainage of your own field, but also for partial drainage of your\r\nneighbor's above, or at least for defence against his surplus of water.\r\n\r\nThe first, and leading idea to be kept in mind, as governing this\r\nquestion of the direction of drains, is the simple fact that _water runs\r\ndown hill_; or, to express the fact more scientifically, water\r\nconstantly seeks a lower level by the force of gravitation, and the\r\nwhole object of drains is to open lower and still lower passages, into\r\nwhich the water may fall lower and lower until it is discharged from our\r\nfield at a safe depth.\r\n\r\nWater goes down, then, by its own weight, unless there is something\r\nthrough which it cannot readily pass, to bring it out at the surface. It\r\nwill go into the drains, only because they are lower than the land\r\ndrained. It will never go _upward_ to find a drain, and it will go\r\ntoward a drain the more readily, in proportion as the descent is more\r\nsteep toward it.\r\n\r\nTo decide properly what direction a drain should have, it is necessary,\r\nthen, to have a definite and a correct idea as to what office the drain\r\nis to perform, what water is to fall into it, what land it is to drain.\r\n\r\nSuppose the general plan to be, to lay drains forty feet apart, and four\r\nfeet deep over the field, and the question now to be determined, as to\r\nthe _direction_, whether across, or up and down the slope, there being\r\nfall enough to render either course practicable. The first point of\r\ninquiry is, what is expected of each drain? How much and what land\r\nshould it drain? The general answer must be, forty feet breadth, either\r\nup and down the slope, or across it; according to the direction. But we\r\nmust be more definite in our inquiry than even this. From _what_ forty\r\nfeet of land will the water fall into the drain? Obviously, from some\r\nland in which the water is higher than the bottom of the drain.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the drain run directly _across_ the slope, most of the water\r\nthat can fall into it, must come from the forty feet breadth of land\r\nbetween the drain in question, and the drain next above it. If the water\r\nwere falling on an impervious surface, it would all run according to the\r\nslope of the surface, in which case, by the way, no drains but those\r\nacross, could catch any of it except what fell upon the drains. But the\r\nwhole theory of drainage is otherwise, and is based on the idea that we\r\nchange the course of the underground flow, by drawing out the water at\r\ngiven points by our drains; or, in other words, that \"the water seeks\r\nthe lowest level in all directions.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the best view the writer has been able to take of the two systems\r\nas to the direction of drains, there is but a very small advantage in\r\ntheory in favor of either over the other, in soil which is homogeneous.\r\nBut it must be borne in mind that homogeneous soil is rather the\r\nexception in nature than the rule.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to advance or defend any peculiar geological views\r\nof the structure of the earth, or of the depositions or formations that\r\ncompose its surface, it may be said, that very often the first four feet\r\nof subsoil is composed of strata, or layers of earth of varying\r\nporosity.\r\n\r\nBeneath sand will be found a stratum of clay, or of compact or cemented\r\ngravel, and frequently these strata are numerous and thin. Indeed, if\r\nthere be not some stratum below the soil, which impedes the passage of\r\nwater, it would pass downward, and the land would need no artificial\r\ndrainage. Quite often it will be found that the dip or inclination of\r\nthe various strata below the soil is different from that of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe surface may have a considerable slope, while the lower strata lie\r\nnearly level, as if they had been cut through by artificial grading.\r\n\r\nThe following figure from the Cyclopedia of Agriculture, with the\r\nexplanation, fully illustrates this idea.\r\n\r\n     \"In many subsoils there are thin partings, or layers, of porous\r\n     materials, interspersed between the strata, which, although not of\r\n     sufficient capacity to give rise to actual springs, yet exude\r\n     sufficient water to indicate their presence. These partings\r\n     occasionally crop out, and give rise to those damp spots, which are\r\n     to be seen diversifying the surface of fields, when the drying\r\n     breezes of Spring have begun to act upon them. In the following\r\n     cut, the light lines represent such partings.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, it will be evident, in draining such land, that if the drains\r\n     be disposed in a direction transverse or oblique to the slope, it\r\n     will often happen that the drains, no matter how skillfully\r\n     planned, will not reach these partings at all, as at A. In this\r\n     case, the water will continue to flow on in its accustomed channel,\r\n     and discharge its waters at B.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 34--DRAINS ACROSS THE SLOPE.]\r\n\r\n     \"But again, even though it does reach these partings, as at C, a\r\n     considerable portion of water will escape from the drain itself,\r\n     and flow to the _lower level_ of its old point of discharge at D.\r\n     Whereas, a drain cut in the line of the slope, as from D to E,\r\n     intersects all these partings, and furnishes an outlet to them at a\r\n     lower level than their old ones.\"\r\n\r\nThese reasons are, it is true, applicable only to land of peculiar\r\nstructure; but there are reasons for selecting the line of greatest fall\r\nfor the direction of drains which are applicable to all lands alike.\r\n\r\n\"The line of the greatest fall is the only line in which a drain is\r\nrelatively lower than the land on either side of it.\" Whether we regard\r\nthe surplus water as having recently fallen upon the field, and as being\r\nstopped near the surface by an impervious stratum, or as brought down on\r\nthese strata from above, we have it to be disposed of as it rests upon\r\nthis stratum, and is borne out by it to the surface.\r\n\r\nIf there is a decided dip, or inclination, of this stratum outward down\r\nthe slope, it is manifest that the water cannot pass backward to a cross\r\ndrain higher up the slope. The course of the water must be downward upon\r\nthe stratum on which it lies, and so all between two cross drains must\r\npass to the lower one. The upper drain could take very little, if any,\r\nand the greater the inclination of this stratum, the less could flow\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\nBut in such case a drain down the slope gives to the water borne up by\r\nthese strata, an outlet of the depth of the drain. If the drain be four\r\nfeet deep, it cuts the water-bearing strata each at that depth, and\r\ntakes off the water.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the different layers of clay or other impervious\r\n\"partings,\" are like the steps of a huge stairway, with the soil filling\r\nthem up to a regular grade. The ditch cuts through these steps, letting\r\nthe water that rests on them fall off at the ends, instead of running\r\nover the edges. Drains across the slope have been significantly termed\r\n\"mere catch-waters.\"\r\n\r\nIf we wish to use water to irrigate lands, we carefully conduct it along\r\nthe surface across the slope, allowing it to flow over and to soak\r\nthrough the soil. If we desire to carry the same water off the field as\r\nspeedily as possible, we should carry our surface ditch directly down\r\nthe slope.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at the operation of drains across the slope, and supposing\r\nthat each drain is draining the breadth next above it, we will suppose\r\nthe drain to be running full of water. What is there to prevent the\r\nwater from passing out of that drain in its progress, at every point of\r\nthe tiles, and so saturating the breadth below it? Drainpipes afford the\r\nsame facility for water to soak out at the lower side, as to enter on\r\nthe upper, and there is the same law of gravitation to operate in each\r\ncase. Mr. Denton gives instances in which he has observed, where drains\r\nwere carried across the slope, in Warwickshire, lines of moisture at a\r\nregular distance below the drains. He could ascertain, he says, the\r\ndepth of the drain itself, by taking the difference of height between\r\nthe line of the drain at the surface, and that of the line of moisture\r\nbeneath it. He says again:\r\n\r\n     \"I recently had an opportunity, in Scotland, of gauging the quantity\r\n     of water traveling along an important drain carried obliquely across\r\n     the fall, when I ascertained with certainty, that, although the land\r\n     through which it passed was comparatively full of water, the drain\r\n     actually lost more than it gained in a passage of several chains\r\n     through it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as authority goes, there seems, with the exception of some\r\nadvocates of the Keythorpe system, of which an account has been given,\r\nto be very little difference of opinion. Mr. Denton says:\r\n\r\n     \"With respect to the direction of drains, I believe very little\r\n     difference of opinion exists. All the most successful drainers\r\n     concur in the line of the steepest descent, as essential to\r\n     effective and economical drainage. Certain exceptions are\r\n     recognized in the West of England, but I believe it will be found,\r\n     as practice extends in that quarter, that the exceptions have been\r\n     allowed in error.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"The very general concurrence in the adoption of the line of\r\n     greatest descent, as the proper course for the minor drains in\r\n     soils free from rock, would almost lead me to declare this as an\r\n     incontrovertible principle.\"\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to cases where we may have to defend ourselves\r\nfrom the flow of water from higher undrained lands of our neighbor. To\r\narrest the flow of mere surface water, an open ditch, or catch-water, is\r\nthe most effectual, as well as the most obvious mode. There are many\r\ninstances in New England, where lands upon the lowest slopes of hills\r\nare overflowed by water which fell high up upon the hill, and, after\r\npassing downward till arrested by rock formation, is borne out again to\r\nthe surface, in such quantity as to produce, just at the foot of the\r\nhill, almost a swamp. This land is usually rich from the wash of the\r\nhills, but full of cold water.\r\n\r\nTo effect perfect drainage of a portion of this land, which we will\r\nsuppose to be a gentle slope, the first object must be to cut off the\r\nflow of water upon or near the surface. An open ditch across the top\r\nwould most certainly effect this object, and it may be doubtful whether\r\nany other drain would be sufficient. This would depend upon the quantity\r\nof water flowing down. If the quantity be very great at times, a part of\r\nit would be likely to flow across the top of an under-drain, from not\r\nhaving time to percolate downward into it.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, it is advised, where our work stops upon a slope, to\r\nintroduce a cross-drain, connecting the tops of all the minor-drains.\r\nThis cross-drain is called a _header_. The object of it is to cut off\r\nthe water that may be passing along in the subsoil down the slope, and\r\nwhich would otherwise be likely to pass downward between the system of\r\ndrains to a considerable distance before finding them. If we suppose the\r\nground saturated with water, and our drains running up the slope and\r\nstopping at 4 feet depth, with no header connecting them, they, in\r\neffect, stop against 4 feet head of water, and in order to drain the\r\nland as far up as they go, must not only take their fair proportion of\r\nwater which lies between them, but must draw down this 4 feet head\r\nbeyond them. This they cannot do, because the water from a higher\r\nsource, with the aid of capillary attraction, and the friction or\r\nresistance met with in percolation, will keep up this head of water far\r\nabove the drained level.\r\n\r\nIn railway cuttings, and the like, we often see a slope of this kind cut\r\nthrough, without drying the land above the cutting; and if the slope be\r\ndisposed in alternate layers of sand or gravel, and clay, the water will\r\ncontinue to flow out high up on the perpendicular bank. Even in porous\r\nsoils of homogeneous character, it will be found that the _head_ of\r\nwater, if we may use the expression, is affected but a short distance\r\nby a drain across its flow. Indeed, the whole theory as to the distance\r\nof drains apart, rests upon the idea, that the limit to which drains may\r\nbe expected effectually to operate, is at most but two or three rods.\r\n\r\nWhether, in a particular case, a header alone will be sufficient to cut\r\noff the flow of water from the higher land, or whether, in addition to\r\nthe header, an open catch-water may be required, must depend upon the\r\nquantity of water likely to flow through or upon the land. An\r\nunder-drain might be expected to absorb any moderate quantity of what\r\nmay be termed drainage-water, but it cannot stop a river or mill-stream;\r\nand if the earth above the tiles be compact, even water flowing through\r\nthe soil with rapidity, might pass across it. If there is reason to\r\napprehend this, an open ditch might be added to the header; or, if this\r\nis not considered sufficiently scientific or in good taste, a tile-drain\r\nof sufficient capacity may be laid, with the ditch above it carefully\r\npacked with small stones to the top of the ground. Such a drain would be\r\nlikely to receive sand and other obstructing substances, as well as a\r\nlarge amount of water, and should, for both reasons, be carried off\r\nindependently of the small drains, which would thus be left to discharge\r\ntheir legitimate service.\r\n\r\nWhere it is thought best to connect an open, or surface drain, with a\r\ncovered drain, it will add much to its security against silt and other\r\nobstructions, to interpose a trap or silt-basin at the junction, and\r\nthus allow the water to pass off comparatively clean. Where, however,\r\nthere is a large flow of water into a basin, it will be kept so much in\r\nmotion as to carry along with it a large amount of earth, and thus\r\nendanger the drain below, unless it be very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES APART, OR FREQUENCY OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\nThe reader, who has studied carefully the rival systems of \"deep\r\ndrainage\" and \"thorough drainage,\" has seen that the distance of drains\r\napart, is closely connected with that controversy. The greatest variety\r\nof opinion is expressed by different writers as to the proper distances,\r\nranging all the way from ten feet apart to seventy, or even more.\r\n\r\nMany English writers have ranged themselves on one side or the other of\r\nsome sharp controversy as to the merits of some peculiar system. Some\r\ndistinguished geologist has discovered, or thinks he has, some new law\r\nof creation by which he can trace the underground currents of water; or\r\nsome noble noble lord has \"patronized\" into notice some caprice of an\r\naspiring engineer, and straight-way the kingdom is convulsed with\r\ncontests to set up or cast down these idols. By careful observation, it\r\nis said, we may find \"sermons in stones, and good in everything;\" and,\r\nstanding aloof from all exciting controversies, we may often profit, not\r\nonly by the science and wisdom of our brethren, but also by their errors\r\nand excesses. If, by the help of the successes and failures of our\r\nEnglish neighbors, we shall succeed in attaining to their present\r\nstandard of perfection in agriculture, we shall certainly make great\r\nadvances upon our present position.\r\n\r\nAs the distances of drains apart, depend manifestly on many\r\ncircumstances, which may widely vary in the diversity of soil, climate,\r\nand cost of labor and materials to be found in the United States, it\r\nwill be convenient to arrange our remarks on the subject under\r\nappropriate heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES DEPEND UPON THE NATURE OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nWater runs readily through sand or gravel. In such soils it easily seeks\r\nand finds its level. If it be drawn out at one point, it tends towards\r\nthat point from all directions. In a free, open sand, you may draw out\r\nall the water at one opening, almost as readily as from an open pond.\r\n\r\nYet, even such sands may require draining. A body of sandy soil\r\nfrequently lies not only upon clay, but in a basin; so that, if the sand\r\nwere removed, a pond would remain. In such a case, a few deep\r\ndrains, rightly placed, might be sufficient. This, however, is a case\r\nnot often met with, though open, sandy soil upon clay is a common\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThen there is the other extreme of compact clay, through which water\r\nseems scarcely to percolate at all. Yet it has water in it, that may\r\nprobably soak out by the same process by which it soaked in. Very few\r\nsoils, of even such as are called clay, are impervious to water,\r\nespecially in the condition in which they are found in nature. To render\r\nthem impervious, it is necessary to wet and stir them up, or, as it is\r\ntermed, _puddle_ them. Any soil, so far as it has been weathered--that\r\nis, exposed to air, water and frost--is permeable to water to a greater\r\nor less degree; so that we may feel confident that the upper stratum of\r\nany soil, not constantly under water, will readily allow the water to\r\npass through.\r\n\r\nAnd in considering the \"Drainage of Stiff Clays,\" we shall see that the\r\nmost obstinate clays are usually so affected by the operation of\r\ndrainage, that they crack, and so open passages for the water to the\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\nAll gravels, black mud of swamps, and loamy soils of any kind, are\r\nreadily drained.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, however--even in tracts of easy drainage, as a\r\nwhole--deposits are found of some combinations with iron, so firmly\r\ncemented together, as to be almost impenetrable with the pick-axe, and\r\napparently impervious to water. Exceptional cases of this nature must\r\nbe carefully sought for by the drainer.\r\n\r\nWhenever a wet spot is observed, seek for the cause, and be satisfied\r\nwhether it is wet because a spring bursts up from the bottom; or because\r\nthe subsoil is impervious, and will not allow the surface-water to pass\r\ndownward. Ascertain carefully the cause of the evil, and then skillfully\r\ndoctor the disease, and not the symptoms merely. A careful attention to\r\nthe theory of moisture, will go far to enable us properly to determine\r\nthe requisite frequency of drains.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES DEPEND UPON THE DEPTH OF THE DRAINS.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the depth and distance of drains will be more fully\r\nconsidered, in treating of the depth of drains. The idea that depth will\r\ncompensate for frequency, in all cases, seems now to be abandoned. It is\r\nconceded that clay-soils, which readily absorb moisture, and yet are\r\nstrongly retentive, cannot be drained with sufficient rapidity, or even\r\nthoroughness, by drains at any depth, unless they are also within\r\ncertain distances.\r\n\r\nIn a porous soil, as a general rule, the deeper the drain, the further\r\nit will draw. The tendency of water is to lie level in the soil; but\r\ncapillary attraction and mechanical obstructions offer constant\r\nresistance to this tendency. The farther water has to pass in the soil,\r\nthe longer time, other things being equal, will be required for the\r\npassage. Therefore, although a single deep drain might, in ten days\r\nlower the water-line as much as two drains of the same depth, or, in\r\nother words, might draw the water all down to its own level, yet, it is\r\nquite evident that the two drains might do the work in less\r\ntime--possibly, in five days. We have seen already the necessity of\r\nlaying drains deep enough to be below the reach of the subsoil plow and\r\nbelow frost, so that, in the Northern States, the question of shallow\r\ndrainage seems hardly debatable. Yet, if we adopt the conclusion that\r\nfour feet is the least allowable depth, where an outfall can be found,\r\nthere may be the question still, whether, in very open soils, a still\r\ngreater depth may not be expedient, to be compensated by increased\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES DEPEND UPON CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nClimate includes the conditions of temperature and moisture, and so,\r\nnecessarily, the seasons. In the chapter which treats of _Rain_, it will\r\nbe seen that the quantity of rain which falls in the year is singularly\r\nvarious in different places. Even, in England, \"the annual average\r\nrain-fall of the wettest place in Cumberland is stated to be 141 inches,\r\nwhile 19-1/2 inches may be taken as the average fall in Essex. In\r\nCumberland, there are 210 days in the year in which rain falls, and in\r\nChiswick, near London, but 124.\"\r\n\r\nA reference to the tables in another place, will show us an infinite\r\nvariety in the rain-fall at different points of our own country.\r\n\r\nIf we expect, therefore, to furnish passage for but two feet of water in\r\nthe year, our drains need not be so numerous as would be necessary to\r\naccommodate twice that quantity, unless, indeed, the time for its\r\npassage may be different; and this leads us to another point which\r\nshould ever be kept in mind in New England--the necessity of quick\r\ndrainage. The more violent storms and showers of our country, as\r\ncompared with England, have been spoken of when considering _The Size of\r\nTiles_. The sudden transition from Winter to Summer, from the breaking\r\nup of deep snows with the heavy falls of rain, to our brief and hasty\r\nplanting time, requires that our system of drainage should be efficient,\r\nnot only to take off large quantities of water, but to take them off in\r\na very short time. How rapidly water may be expected to pass off by\r\ndrainage, is not made clear by writers on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"One inch in depth,\" says an English writer, \"is a very heavy fall of\r\nrain in a day, and it generally takes two days for the water to drain\r\nfully from deep drained land.\" One inch of water over an acre is\r\ncalculated to be something more than one hundred tons. This seems, in\r\ngross, to be a large amount, but we should expect that an inch, or even\r\ntwo inches of water, spread evenly over a field, would soon disappear\r\nfrom the surface; and if not prevented by some impervious obstruction,\r\nit must continue downward.\r\n\r\nIt is said, on good authority, that, in England, the smallest sized\r\npipes, if the fall be good, will be sufficiently large, at ordinary\r\ndistances, to carry off all the surplus water. In the author's own\r\nfields, where two-inch tiles are laid at four feet depth and fifty feet\r\napart, in an open soil, they seem amply sufficient to relieve the ground\r\nof all surplus water from rain, in a very few days. Most of them have\r\nnever ceased to run every day in the year, but as they are carried up\r\ninto an undrained plain, they probably convey much more water than falls\r\nupon the land in which they lie.\r\n\r\nSo far as our own observation goes, their flow increases almost as soon\r\nas rain begins to fall, and subsides, after it ceases, about as soon as\r\nthe water in the little river into which they lead, sinks back into its\r\nordinary channel, the freshet in the drains and in the stream being\r\nnearly simultaneous. Probably, two-inch pipes, at fifty feet distances,\r\nwill carry off, with all desirable rapidity, any quantity of water that\r\nwill ever fall, if the soil be such that the water can pass through it\r\nto the distance necessary to find the drains; but it is equally probable\r\nthat, in a compact clay soil, fifty feet distance is quite too great for\r\nsufficiently rapid drainage, because the water cannot get to the drains\r\nwith sufficient rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES DEPEND UPON THE COMPARATIVE PRICES OF LABOR AND TILES.\r\n\r\nThe fact, that the last foot of a four-foot drain costs as much labor as\r\nthe first three feet, is shown in another chapter, and the deeper we go,\r\nthe greater the comparative cost of the labor. With tiles at $10 per\r\nthousand, the cost of opening and filling a four-foot ditch is, in,\r\nround numbers, by the rod, equal to twice the cost of the tiles. In\r\nporous soils, therefore, where depth may be made to compensate for\r\ngreater distance, it is always a matter for careful estimate, whether we\r\nshall practice true economy by laying the tiles at great depths, or at\r\nthe smallest depth at which they will be safe from frost and the subsoil\r\nplow, and at shorter distances. The rule is manifest that, where labor\r\nis cheap and tiles are dear, it is true economy to dig deep and lay few\r\ntiles; and, where tiles are cheap and labor is dear, it is economy to\r\nmake the number of drains, if possible, compensate for less depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES DEPEND UPON SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nWhile we would not lay down an arbitrary arrangement for any farm,\r\nexcept upon a particular examination, and while we would by no means\r\nadvocate what has been called the gridiron system--of drains everywhere\r\nat equal depths and distances--yet some system is absolutely essential,\r\nin any operation that approaches to thorough drainage.\r\n\r\nIf it be only desired to cut off some particular springs, or to assist\r\nNature in some ravine or basin, a deep drain here and there may be\r\nexpedient; but when any considerable surface is to be drained, there can\r\nbe no good work without a connected plan of operations.\r\n\r\nMains must be laid from the outfall, through the lowest parts; and into\r\nthe mains the smaller drains must be conducted, upon such a system as\r\nthat there may be the proper fall or inclination throughout, and that\r\nthe whole field shall be embraced.\r\n\r\nAgain, a perfect _plan_ of the completed work, accurately drawn on\r\npaper, should always be preserved for future reference. Now it is\r\nmanifest, that it is impossible to lay out a given field, with proper\r\nmains and small drains, dividing the fall as equally as practicable\r\nbetween the different parts of an undulating field, preserving a system\r\nthroughout, by which, with the aid of a plan, any drain may at any time\r\nbe traced, without making distances conform somewhat to the system of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIt is easily demonstrable, too, that drains at right angles with the\r\nmains, and so parallel with each other, are the shortest possible drains\r\nin land that needs uniform drainage. They take each a more uniform share\r\nof the water, and serve a greater breadth of soil than when laid at\r\nacute angles. While, therefore, it may be supposed that in particular\r\nparts of the field, distances somewhat greater or less might be\r\nadvisable, considered independently, yet in practice, it will be found\r\nbest, usually, to pay becoming deference to order, \"Heaven's first law,\"\r\nand sacrifice something of the individual good, to the leading idea of\r\nthe general welfare.\r\n\r\nIn the letter of Mr. Denton, in another chapter, some remarks will be\r\nfound upon the subject of which we are treating. The same gentleman has,\r\nin a published paper, illustrated the impossibility of strict adherence\r\nto any arbitrary rule in the distances or arrangement of drains, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The wetness of land, which for distinction's sake, I have called\r\n     'the water of pressure,' like the water of springs, to which it is\r\n     nearly allied, can be effectually and cheaply removed only by\r\n     drains devised for, and devoted to the object. Appropriate deep\r\n     drains at B B B, for instance, as indicated in the dark vertical\r\n     lines, are found to do the service of many parallel drains, which\r\n     as frequently miss, as they hit, those furrows, or 'lips,' in the\r\n     horizontal out-crop of water-bearing strata which continue to exude\r\n     wetness after the higher portions are dry.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 35.--The vertical dotted lines show the\r\n     position of parallel drains.]\r\n\r\n     \"A consideration, too, of the varying inclinations of surface, of\r\n     which instances will frequently occur in the same field,\r\n     necessitates a departure from uniformity, not in direction only,\r\n     but in intervals between drains. Take, for instance, the ordinary\r\n     case of a field, in which a comparatively flat space will intervene\r\n     between quickly rising ground and the outfall ditch. It is clear\r\n     that the soak of the hill will pervade the soil of the lower\r\n     ground, let the system of drainage adopted be what it may; and,\r\n     therefore, supposing the soil of the hill and flat to be precisely\r\n     alike, the existence of bottom water in a greater quantity in the\r\n     lower lands than in the higher, will call for a greater number of\r\n     drains. It is found, too, that an independent discharge or relief\r\n     of the water coming from the hill, at B, should always be provided,\r\n     in order to avoid any impediment by the slower flow of the flatter\r\n     drains.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n     \"Experience shows that, with few exceptions, hollows, or 'slacks,'\r\n     observable on the surface, as at B B, have a corresponding\r\n     undulation of subsoil and that any system which does not provide a\r\n     direct release for water, which would otherwise collect in and\r\n     draw towards these spots, is imperfect and unsatisfactory. It is\r\n     found to be much more safe to depend on relief drains, than on the\r\n     cutting of drains sufficiently deep through the banks, at A A, to\r\n     gain a fall at a regular inclination.\r\n\r\n     \"Still, in spite of experience, we often observe a disregard of\r\n     these facts, even in works which are otherwise well executed to a\r\n     depth of four feet, but fettered by methodical rules, and I feel\r\n     compelled to remark, that it has often occurred to me, when I have\r\n     observed with what diligent examination the rules of depth and\r\n     distance have been tested, that if more attention had been paid to\r\n     the _source_ of injury, and to the mode of securing an effective\r\n     and permanent _discharge_ of the injurious water, much greater\r\n     service would be done.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as to distances, we should advise great caution on the\r\npart of beginners in laying out their drains. Draining is too expensive\r\na work to be carelessly or unskillfully done. A mistake in locating\r\ndrains too far apart, brings a failure to accomplish the end in view. A\r\nmistake in placing them too near, involves a great loss of labor and\r\nmoney. Consult, then, those whose experience has given them knowledge,\r\nand pay to a professional engineer, or some other skillful person, a\r\nsmall amount for aid, which will probably save ten times as much in the\r\nend. We have placed our own drains in porous, though very wet soil, at\r\nfifty feet distances, which, in most soils, might be considered\r\nextremely wide. We are fully satisfied that they would have drained the\r\nland as well at sixty feet, except in a few low places, where they could\r\nnot be sunk four feet for want of fall.\r\n\r\nIn most New England lands that require drainage, we believe that from 40\r\nto 50 feet distances, with four feet depth, will prove sufficient. Upon\r\nstiff clays, we have no experience of our own of any value, although we\r\nhave a field of the stiffest clay, drained last season at 40 feet\r\ndistances and four feet depth. In England, this would, probably, prove\r\ninsufficient, and, perhaps, it will prove so here. One thing is\r\ncertain, that, at present, there is little land in this country that\r\nwill pay for drainage by hand labor, at the English distances in clay,\r\nof 16 or 20 feet. If our powerful Summer's sun will not somehow\r\ncompensate in part for distance, we must, upon our clays, await the\r\ncoming of draining plows and steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\nCheap and temporary expedients in agriculture are the characteristics of\r\nus Americans, who have abundance of land, a whole continent to\r\ncultivate, and comparatively few hands and small capital with which to\r\ndo the work. We erect temporary houses and barns and fences, hoping to\r\nfind time and means at a future day, to reconstruct them in a more\r\nthorough manner. We half cultivate our new lands, because land is\r\ncheaper than labor; and it pays best for the present, rather to rob our\r\nmother earth, than to give her labor for bread.\r\n\r\nThe easy and cheap process in draining, is that into which we naturally\r\nfall. It is far easier and cheaper to dig shallow than deep drains, and,\r\ntherefore, we shall not dig deep unless we see good reason to do so. If,\r\nhowever, we carefully study the subject, it will be manifest that\r\nsuperficial drainage is, in general, the result of superficial\r\nknowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nThorough-drainage does not belong to pioneer farming, nor to a cheap and\r\ntemporary system. It involves capital and labor, and demands skill and\r\nsystem. It cannot be patched up, like a brush fence, to answer the\r\npurpose, from year to year, but every tile must be placed where it will\r\nbest perform its office for a generation. In England, the rule and the\r\nhabit in all things, is thoroughness and permanency; yet the first and\r\ngreatest mistake there in drainage was shallowness, and it has required\r\nyears of experiments, and millions of money, to correct that mistake.\r\nIf we commit the same folly, as we are very likely to do, we cannot\r\nclaim even the originality of the blunder, and shall be guilty of the\r\nfolly of pursuing the crooked paths of their exploration, instead of the\r\nstraight highway which they have now established. To be sure, the\r\ncontroversy as to the depth of drains has by no means ceased in England,\r\nbut the question is reduced to this, whether the least depth shall be\r\nthree feet or four; one party contending that for certain kinds of clay,\r\na three-foot drain is as effectual as a four-foot drain, and that the\r\nleast effectual depth should be used, because it is the cheapest; while\r\nthe general opinion of the best scientific and practical men in the\r\nkingdom, has settled down upon four feet as the minimum depth, where the\r\nfall and other circumstances render it practicable. At the same time,\r\nall admit that, in many cases, a greater depth than four feet is\r\nrequired by true economy. It may seem, at first, that a controversy, as\r\nto one additional foot in a system of drainage, depends upon a very\r\nsmall point; but a little reflection will show it to be worthy of\r\ncareful consideration. Without going here into a nice calculation, it\r\nmay be stated generally as an established fact, that the excavation of a\r\nditch four feet deep, costs twice as much as that of a ditch three feet\r\ndeep. Although this may not seem credible to one who has not considered\r\nthe point, yet it will become more probable on examination, and very\r\nclear, when the actual digging is attempted. Ditches for tiles are\r\nalways opened widest at top, with a gradual narrowing to near the\r\nbottom, where they should barely admit the tile. Now, the addition of a\r\nfoot to the depth, is not, as it would perhaps at first appear, merely\r\nthe addition of the lowest and narrowest foot, but rather of the topmost\r\nand widest foot. In other words, a four-foot ditch is precisely a\r\nthree-foot ditch in size and form, with an additional foot on the top\r\nof it, and not a three-foot ditch deepened an additional foot.\r\n\r\nThe lowest foot of a four-foot ditch is raised one foot higher, to get\r\nit upon the surface, than if the ditch were but three feet deep. In\r\nclays, and most other soils, the earth grows harder as we go deeper, and\r\nthis consideration, in practice, will be found important. Again: the\r\nsmall amount of earth from a three-foot ditch, may lie conveniently on\r\none bank near its edge, while the additional mass from a deeper one must\r\nbe thrown further; and then is to be added the labor of replacing the\r\nadditional quantity in filling up.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the point may be conceded, that the labor of opening and\r\nfinishing a four-foot drain is double that of a three-foot drain.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping here to estimate carefully the cost of excavation and\r\nthe cost of tiles, it may be remarked, that, upon almost any estimate,\r\nthe cost of labor, even in a three-foot drain in this country, yet far\r\nexceeds the cost of tiles: but, if we call them equal, then, if the\r\nadditional foot of depth costs as much as the first three feet, we have\r\nthe cost of a four-foot tile-drain fifty per cent. more than that of a\r\nthree-foot drain. In other words, 200 rods of four-foot drain will cost\r\njust as much as 300 rods of three-foot drain. This is, probably, as\r\nnearly accurate as any general estimate that can be made at present. The\r\nprinciples upon which the calculations depend, having been thus\r\nsuggested, it will not be difficult to vary them so as to apply them to\r\nthe varying prices of labor and tiles, and to the use of the plow or\r\nother implements propelled by animals or steam, when applied to drainage\r\nin our country.\r\n\r\nThe earliest experiments in thorough-drainage, in England, were at very\r\nsmall depths, two feet being, for a time, considered very deep, and\r\nlarge tracts were underlaid with tiles at a depth of eighteen, and even\r\ntwelve inches. It is said, that 10,000 miles of drains, two feet deep\r\nand less, were laid in Scotland before it was found that this depth was\r\nnot sufficient. Of course, the land thus treated was relieved of much\r\nwater, and experimenters were often much gratified with their success;\r\nbut it may be safely said now, that there is no advocate known to the\r\npublic, in England, for a system of drainage of less than three feet\r\ndepth, and no one advocates a system of drainage of less than four feet\r\ndeep, except upon some peculiar clays.\r\n\r\nThe general principle seems well established, that depth will compensate\r\nfor width; or, in other words, that the deeper the drain, the farther it\r\nwill draw. This principle, generally correct, is questioned when applied\r\nto peculiar clays only. As to them, all that is claimed is, that it is\r\nmore economical to make the drains but three feet, because they must,\r\neven if deep, be near together--nobody doubting, that if four feet deep\r\nor more, and near enough, they will drain the land.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of _clay_ soil, it should always be borne in mind, that clay\r\nis merely a relative term in agriculture. \"A clay in Scotland,\" says Mr.\r\nPusey, \"would be a loam in the South of England.\" Professor Mapes, of\r\nour own country, in the _Working Farmer_, says, \"We are convinced, that,\r\nwith thorough subsoil plowing, no clay soil exists in this country which\r\nmight not be underdrained to a depth of four feet with advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, that, with four-foot drains at proper distances,\r\nall soils, except some peculiar clays, may be drained, even without\r\nreference to the changes produced in the mechanical structure of soil by\r\nthe operation. There is no doubt, however, that all soils are, by the\r\nadmission of air, which must always take the place of the water drawn\r\nout, and by the percolation of water through them, rendered gradually\r\nmore porous. Added to this, the subsoil plow, which will be the\r\nfollower of drainage, will break up the soil to considerable depth, and\r\nthus make it more permeable to moisture. But there is still another and\r\nmore effective aid which Nature affords to the land-drainer, upon what\r\nmight be otherwise impracticable clays.\r\n\r\nThis topic deserves a careful and distinct consideration, which it will\r\nreceive under the title of \"Drainage of Stiff Clays.\"\r\n\r\nIn discussing the subject of the depth of drains, we are not unmindful\r\nof the fact that, in this country, the leaders in the drainage movement,\r\nespecially Messrs. Delafield, Yeomans, and Johnston, of New York, have\r\nachieved their truly striking results, by the use of tiles laid at from\r\ntwo and a half to three feet depth. On the \"Premium Farm\" of R. J. Swan,\r\nof Rose Hill, near Geneva, it is stated that there are sixty-one miles\r\nof under-drains, laid from two and a half to three feet deep. That these\r\nlands thus drained have been changed in their character, from cold, wet,\r\nand unproductive wastes, in many cases, to fertile and productive fields\r\nof corn and wheat, sufficiently appears. Indeed, we all know of fields\r\ndrained only with stone drains two feet deep, that have been reclaimed\r\nfrom wild grasses and rushes into excellent mowing fields. In England\r\nand in Scotland, as we have seen, thousands of miles of shallow drains\r\nwere laid, and were for years quite satisfactory. These facts speak\r\nloudly in favor of drainage in general. The fact that shoal drains\r\nproduce results so striking, is a stumbling-block in the progress of a\r\nmore thorough system. It may seem like presumption to say to those to\r\nwhom we are so much indebted for their public spirit, as well as private\r\nenterprise, that they have not drained deep enough for the greatest\r\nadvantage in the end. It would seem that they should know their own\r\nfarms and their own results better than others. We propose to state,\r\nwith all fairness, the results of their experiments, and to detract\r\nnothing from the credit which is due to the pioneers in a great work.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, against the overwhelming weight of authority, and\r\nagainst the reasons for deeper drainage, which, to us, seem so\r\nsatisfactory, conclude, that even three feet is, in general, deep enough\r\nfor under-drains. Three-foot drains will produce striking results on\r\nalmost any wet lands, but four-foot drains will be more secure and\r\ndurable, will give wider feeding-grounds to the roots, better filter the\r\npercolating water, warm and dry the land earlier in Spring, furnish a\r\nlarger reservoir for heavy rains, and, indeed, more effectually perform\r\nevery office of drains.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing our somewhat minute discussion of this essential point--the\r\nproper depth of drains--certain propositions may be laid down with\r\nconsiderable assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILES MUST BE LAID BELOW THE REACH OF THE SUBSOIL PLOW.\r\n\r\nLet no man imagine that he shall never use the subsoil plow; for so\r\nsurely as he has become already so much alive to improvement, as to\r\nthorough-drain, so surely will he next complete the work thus begun, by\r\nsubsoiling his land.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil plow follows in the furrow of another plow, and if the\r\nforward plow turn a furrow one foot deep, the subsoil may be run two\r\nfeet more, making three feet in all. Ordinarily, the subsoil plow is run\r\nonly to the depth of 18 or 20 inches; but if the intention were to run\r\nit no deeper than that, it would be liable to dip much deeper\r\noccasionally, as it came suddenly upon the soft places above the drains.\r\nThe tiles should lie far enough below the deepest path of the subsoil\r\nplow, not to be at all disturbed by its pressure in passing over the\r\ndrains. It is by no means improbable that fields that have already been\r\ndrained in this country, may be, in the lifetime of their present\r\noccupants, plowed and subsoiled by means of steam-power, and stirred to\r\nas great a depth as shall be found at all desirable. But, in the present\r\nmode of using the subsoil plow on land free from stones, a depth less\r\nthan three and a half or four feet would hardly be safe for the depth of\r\ntile-drains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILES MUST BE LAID BELOW FROST.\r\n\r\nThis is a point upon which we must decide for our selves. There is no\r\ncountry where drainage is practiced, where the thermometer sinks, as in\r\nalmost every Winter it does in New England, to 20° below zero\r\n(Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nAll writers seem to assume that tile-drains must be injured by frost.\r\nWhat the effect of frost upon them is supposed to be, does not seem very\r\nclear. If filled with water, and frozen, they must, of course, burst by\r\nthe expansion of the water in freezing; but it would probably rarely\r\nhappen, that drainage-water, running in cold weather, could come from\r\nother than deep sources, and it must then be considerably above the\r\nfreezing point. Still; we know that aqueduct pipes do freeze at\r\nconsiderable depths, though supplied from deep springs. Neither these\r\nnor gas-pipes are, in our New England towns, safe below frost, unless\r\nlaid four feet below the surface; and instances occur where they freeze\r\nat a much greater depth, usually, however, under the beaten paths of\r\nstreets, or in exposed positions, where the snow is blown away. In such\r\nplaces, the earth sometimes freezes solid to the depth of even six feet.\r\nIt will be suggested at once that our fields, and especially our wet\r\nlands, do not freeze so deep, and this is true; but it must be borne in\r\nmind, that the very reason why our wet lands do not freeze deeper, may\r\nbe, that they are filled with the very spring-water which makes them\r\ncold in Summer, indeed, but is warmer than the air in Winter, and so\r\nkeeps out the frost. Drained lands will freeze deeper than undrained\r\nlands, and the farmer must be vigilant upon this point, or he may have\r\nhis work ruined in a single Winter.\r\n\r\nWe are aware, that upon this, as every other point, ascertained facts\r\nmay seem strangely to conflict. In the town of Lancaster, among the\r\nmountains in the coldest part of New Hampshire, many of the houses and\r\nbarns of the village are supplied with water brought in aqueducts from\r\nthe hills. We observed that the logs which form the conduit are, in many\r\nplaces, exposed to view on the surface of the ground, sometimes partly\r\ncovered with earth, but generally very little protected. There has not\r\nbeen a Winter, perhaps in a half century, when the thermometer has not\r\nat times been 10° below Zero, and often it is even lower than that. Upon\r\nparticular inquiry, we ascertained that very little inconvenience is\r\nexperienced there from the freezing of the pipes. The water is drawn\r\nfrom deep springs in the mountains, and fills the pipes of from one to\r\ntwo-inch bore, passing usually not more than one or two hundred rods\r\nbefore it is discharged, and its warmth is sufficient, with the help of\r\nits usual snow covering, to protect it from the frost.\r\n\r\nWe have upon our own premises an aqueduct, which supplies a cattle-yard,\r\nwhich has never been covered more than two feet deep, and has never\r\nfrozen in the nine years of its use. We should not, therefore, apprehend\r\nmuch danger from the freezing of pipes, even at shallow depths, if they\r\ncarry all the Winter a considerable stream of spring-water; but in pipes\r\nwhich take merely the surface water that passes into them by\r\npercolation, we should expect little or no aid from the water in\r\npreventing frost. The water filtering downward in Winter must be nearly\r\nat the freezing point; and the pipes may be filled with solid ice, by\r\nthe freezing of a very small quantity as it enters them.\r\n\r\nNeither hard-burnt bricks nor hard-burnt tiles will crumble by mere\r\nexposure to the Winter weather above ground, though soft bricks or tiles\r\nwill scarcely endure a single hard frost. Too much stress cannot be laid\r\nupon the importance of using hard-burnt tiles only, as the failure of a\r\nsingle tile may work extensive mischief. Writers seem to assume, that\r\nthe freezing of the ground about the drains will displace the tiles, and\r\nso destroy their continuity, and this may be so; though we find no\r\nevidence, perhaps, that at three or four feet, there is any disturbance\r\nof the soil by freezing. We dig into clay, or into our strong subsoils,\r\nand find the earth, at three feet deep, as solid and undisturbed as at\r\ntwice that depth, and no indication that the frost has touched it,\r\nthough it has felt the grip of his icy fingers every year since the\r\nFlood. With these suggestions for warning and for encouragement, the\r\nsubject must be left to the sound judgment of the farmer or engineer\r\nupon each farm, to make the matter so safe, that the owner need not have\r\nan anxious thought, as he wakes in a howling Winter night, lest his\r\ndrains should be freezing.\r\n\r\nFinally, in view of the various considerations that have been,\r\nsuggested, as well as of the almost uniform authority of the ablest\r\nwriters and practical men, it is safe to conclude, that, in general, in\r\nthis country, wherever sufficient outfall can be had, _four feet above\r\nthe top of the tiles should be the minimum depth of drains_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\n     Necessity of System.--What Fall is Necessary.--American\r\n     Examples.--Outlets.--Wells and Relief-Pipes.--Peep holes.--How to\r\n     secure Outlets.--Gate to Exclude Back-Water.--Gratings and Screens\r\n     to keep out Frogs, Snakes, Moles, &c.--Mains, Submains, and Minors,\r\n     how placed.--Capacity of Pipes.--Mains of Two Tiles.--Junction of\r\n     Drains.--Effect of Curves and Angles on Currents.--Branch\r\n     Pipes.--Draining into Wells or Swallow Holes.--Letter from Mr.\r\n     Denton.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs every act is, or should be, a part of a great plan of life, so every\r\nstake that is set, and every line laid in the field, should have\r\nrelation not only to general principles, but also to some comprehensive\r\nplan of operations.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that the principles advocated in this treatise are\r\nadopted as to the details, that the depth preferred is not less than\r\nfour feet--that the direction preferred is up and down the slope--that\r\nthe distance apart may range from fifteen to sixty feet, and more in\r\nsome cases, according to the depth of drains and the nature of the\r\nsoil--that no tiles smaller than one and a half inch bore will be used,\r\nand none less than two inches except for the first one hundred yards,\r\nthere still remains the application of all these principles to the\r\nparticular work in hand. With the hope of assisting the deliberations of\r\nthe farmer on this point, some additional suggestions will be made under\r\nappropriate heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT MUST HAVE REFERENCE TO SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe absolute necessity of some regularity of plan in our work, must be\r\nmanifest. Without system, we can never, in the outset, estimate the\r\ncost of our operation; we can never proportion our tiles to the quantity\r\nof water that will pass through them; we can never find the drains\r\nafterwards, or form a correct opinion of the cause of any failure that\r\nmay await us.\r\n\r\nWe prefer, in general, where practicable, parallel lines for our minor\r\ndrains, at right angles with the mains, because this is the simplest and\r\nmost systematic arrangement; but the natural ravines or water-courses in\r\nfields, seldom run parallel with each other, or at right angles with the\r\nslope of the hills, so that regular work like this, can rarely be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIf the earth were constructed of regular slopes, or plains of uniform\r\ncharacter, we could easily apply to it all our rules; but, broken as it\r\nis into hills and valleys, filled with stones here, with a bank of clay\r\nthere, and a sand-pit close by, we are obliged to sacrifice to general\r\nconvenience, often, some special abstract rule.\r\n\r\nWe prefer to run drains up and down the slope; but if the field be\r\nfilled with undulations, or hills with various slopes, we may often find\r\nit expedient, for the sake of system, to vary this course.\r\n\r\nIf the question were only as to one single drain, we could adjust it so\r\nas to conform to our perfect ideal; but as each drain is, as it were, an\r\nartery in a complicated system, which must run through and affect every\r\npart of it, all must be located with reference to every other, and to\r\nthe general effect.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind, then, the importance of some regular system that shall\r\ninclude the whole field of operation, the work should be laid out, with\r\nas near a conformity to established principles as circumstances will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT MUST HAVE REFERENCE TO THE FALL.\r\n\r\nIn considering what fall is necessary, and what is desirable, we have\r\nseen, that although a very slight inclination may carry off water, yet\r\na proportionably larger drain is necessary as the fall decreases,\r\nbecause the water runs slower.\r\n\r\n     \"It is surprising,\" says Stephens, \"what a small descent is\r\n     required for the flow of water in a well-constructed duct. People\r\n     frequently complain that they cannot find sufficient fall to carry\r\n     off the water from the drains. There are few situations where a\r\n     sufficient fall cannot be found if due pains are exercised. It has\r\n     been found in practice, that a water-course thirty feet wide and\r\n     six feet deep, giving a transverse sectional area of one hundred\r\n     and eighty square feet, will discharge three hundred cubic yards of\r\n     water per minute, and will flow at the rate of one mile per hour,\r\n     with a fall of no more than _six inches per mile_.\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. Shedd and Edson, of Boston, have superintended some drainage\r\nworks in Milton, Mass., where, after obtaining permission to drain\r\nthrough the land of an adjacent owner, not interested in the operation,\r\nthey could obtain but three inches fall in one hundred feet, or a half\r\ninch to the rod, for three quarters of a mile, and this only by blasting\r\nthe ledges at the outlet. This fall, however, proves sufficient for\r\nperfect drainage, and by their skill, a very unhealthful swamp has been\r\nrendered fit for gardens and building-lots. In another instance, in\r\nDorchester, Mass., Mr. Shedd informs us that in one thousand feet, they\r\ncould obtain only a fall of two inches for their main, and this, by nice\r\nadjustment, he expects to make sufficient. In another instance, he has\r\nfound a fall of two and a half inches in one hundred feet, in an open\r\npaved drain to be effectual.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly advisable always to divide the fall as even as possible\r\nthroughout the drains, yet this will be found a difficult rule to\r\nfollow. Very often we have a space of nearly level ground to pass\r\nthrough to our outfall; and, usually, the mains, in order that the minor\r\ndrains may be carried into them from both sides, must follow up the\r\nnatural valleys in the field, thus controlling, in a great measure, our\r\nchoice as to the fall. We are, in fact, often compelled to use the\r\nnatural fall nearly as we find it.\r\n\r\nIt is thought advisable to have the mains from three to six inches lower\r\nthan the drains discharging into them, so that there may be no\r\nobstruction in the minor drains by the backing up of water, and the\r\nconsequent deposition of sand or other obstructing substances. Wherever\r\none stream flows into another, there must be more or less interruption\r\nof the course of each. If the water from the minors enters the main with\r\na quick fall, the danger of obstruction in the minor, at least, is much\r\nlessened. A frequent cause of partial failure of drains, is their not\r\nhaving been laid with a regular inclination. If, instead of a gradual\r\nand uniform fall, there should be a slight rising in the bed of a drain,\r\nthe descending water will be interrupted there till it accumulate so\r\nhigh as to be above the level of the rising. At this point, therefore,\r\nthe water must have a tendency to press out of the drains, and will\r\ndeposit whatever particles of sand or other earthy matter it may bring\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nDrains must, therefore, be so arranged, that in cutting them, their beds\r\nmay be as nearly as possible, straight, or, at least, have a constant,\r\nif not a regular and equal fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT MUST HAVE REFERENCE TO THE OUTLET.\r\n\r\nAll agree that it is best to have but few general outlets. \"In the whole\r\nprocess of draining,\" says an engineer of experience, \"there is nothing\r\nso desirable as permanent and substantial work at the point of\r\ndischarge.\" The outlet is the place, of all others, where obstruction is\r\nmost likely to occur. Everywhere else the work is protected by the earth\r\nabove it, but here it is exposed to the action of frost, to cattle, to\r\nmischievous boys, to reptiles, as well as to the obstructing deposits\r\nwhich are discharged from the drains themselves. In regular work, under\r\nthe direction of engineers, iron pipes, with swing gratings set in\r\nmasonry, are used, to protect permanently this important part of the\r\nsystem of drainage.\r\n\r\nIt may often be convenient to run parallel drains down a slope, bringing\r\neach out into an open ditch, or at the bottom of some bank, thus making\r\na separate outlet for each. This practice, however, is strongly\r\ndeprecated. These numerous outlets cannot be well protected without\r\ngreat cost; they will be forgotten, or, at least, neglected, and the\r\nwork will fail.\r\n\r\nRegarding this point, of few and well-secured outlets, as of great\r\nimportance, the arrangement of all the drains must have reference to it.\r\nWhen drains are brought down a slope, as just suggested, let them,\r\ninstead of discharging separately, be crossed, near the foot of the\r\nslope, by a sub-main running a little diagonally so as to secure\r\nsufficient fall, and so carried into a main, or discharged at a single\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that by thus uniting the whole system, and\r\ndischarging the water at one point, there may be difficulty in\r\nascertaining by inspection, whether any of the drains are obstructed, or\r\nwhether all are performing their appropriate work. There is prudence and\r\ngood sense in this suggestion, and the objection may be obviated by\r\nplacing _wells_, or \"peep-holes,\" at proper intervals, in which the flow\r\nof the water at various points may be observed. On the subject of wells\r\nand peep-holes, the reader will find in another chapter a more\r\nparticular description of their construction and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe position of the outlet must, evidently, be at a point sufficiently\r\nlow to receive all the water of the field; or, in other words, it must\r\nbe the lowest point of the work. It will be fortunate, too, if the\r\noutlet can be at the same time high enough to be at all times above the\r\nback-water of the stream, or pond, or marsh, into which it empties; and\r\nhigh enough, too, to be protected by solid earth about it. In any case,\r\ngreat care should be taken to make the outlet secure and permanent. The\r\nprocess of thorough-drainage is expensive, and will only repay cost,\r\nupon the idea that it is permanent--that once well done, it is done\r\nforever. The tiles may be expected to operate well, for a lifetime; and\r\nthe outlet, the only exposed portion of the work, should be constructed\r\nto endure as long as the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this portion of the work may be reached and repaired\r\nmore conveniently than the tiles themselves; but it must be remembered\r\nthat the decay of the outlet obstructs the flow of the water, produces a\r\ngeneral stagnation throughout the drains, and so may cause their\r\npermanent obstruction at various points, hard to be ascertained, and\r\ndifficult to be reached. Considering our liability to neglect such\r\nthings as perish by a gradual decay, as well as the many accidental\r\ninjuries to which the outlet is exposed, there is no security but in a\r\nsolid and permanent structure at the first.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the importance attached to this point in England, as well\r\nas to indicate the best mode of securing the outlet, the drawings below\r\nhave been taken from a pamphlet by Mr. Denton. Fig. 37 represents the\r\nmode of constructing the common small outlets of field drainage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--SMALL OUTLET.]\r\n\r\nThe distinguished engineer, of whose labors we have so freely availed\r\nourselves, remarks as follows upon the subject:\r\n\r\n     \"Too many outlets are objectionable, on account of the labor of\r\n     their maintenance: too few are objectionable, because they can only\r\n     exist where there are mains of excessive length. A limit of twenty\r\n     acres to an outlet, resulting in an average of, perhaps, fourteen\r\n     acres, will appear, by the practices of the best drainers, to be\r\n     about the proper thing. If a shilling an acre is reserved for\r\n     fixing the outlets, which should be _iron pipes, with swing\r\n     gratings_, in masonry, very substantial work may be done.\"\r\n\r\nFigures 38 and 39 represent the elevation and section of larger outlets,\r\nused in more extensive works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--LARGE OUTLET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--LARGE OUTLET.]\r\n\r\nIt is almost essential to the efficiency of drains, that there be fall\r\nenough beyond the outlet to allow of the quick flow of the water\r\ndischarged. At the outlet, must be deposited whatever earth is brought\r\ndown by the drains; and, in many cases, the outlet must be at a swamp or\r\npond. If no decided fall can be obtained at the outlet, there must be\r\ncare to provide and keep an open ditch or passage, so that the\r\ndrainage-water may not be dammed back in the drains. It is advised,\r\neven, to follow down the bank of a stream or river, so as to obtain\r\nsufficient fall, rather than to have the outlet flooded, or _back-water_\r\nin the drains. Still, there may be cases where it will be impossible to\r\nhave an outlet that shall be always above the level of the river or pond\r\nwhich may receive the drainage water. If the outlet must be so situated\r\nas to be at times overflowed, great care should be taken to excavate a\r\nplace at the outlet, into which any deposits brought down by the drain,\r\nmay fall. If the outlet be level with the ground beyond it, the smallest\r\nquantity of earth will operate as a dam to keep back the water.\r\nTherefore, at the outlet, in such cases, a small well of brick or\r\nstonework should be constructed, into which the water should pour.\r\nThere, even if the water stand above the outlet, will be deposited the\r\nearth brought along in the drain. This well must at times, when the\r\nwater is low, be cleared of its contents, and kept ready for its work.\r\n\r\nThe effect of back-water in drains cannot ordinarily be injurious,\r\nexcept as it raises the water higher in the land, and occasions deposits\r\nof earthy matter, and so obstructs the drains. We have in mind now, the\r\ncommon case of water temporarily raised, by Winter flowage or by Summer\r\nfreshets.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that even when the outlet is under water, if\r\nthere is any current in the stream into which the drain empties, there\r\nmust be some current in the drain also; and even if the drain discharge\r\ninto a still pond, there must be a current greater or less, as water\r\nfrom a level higher than the surface of the pond, presses into the\r\ndrains. Generally, then, under the most unfavorable circumstances, we\r\nmay expect to have some flow of water through the pipes, and rarely an\r\nutter stagnation. If, then, the tiles be carefully laid, so as to admit\r\nonly well-filtered water, there can be but little deposit in the drain;\r\nand a temporary stagnation, even, will not injure them, and a trifling\r\nflow will keep them clean. Much will depend, as to the obstruction of\r\ndrains, in this, and indeed in all cases, upon the internal smoothness,\r\nand upon the nice adjustment of the pipes. In case of the drainage of\r\nmarshes, and other lands subject to sudden flood, a flap, or gate, is\r\nused to exclude the water of flowage, until counterbalanced by the\r\ndrainage-water in the pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--OUTLET PIPE WITH FLAP TO EXCLUDE FLOOD-WATER.]\r\n\r\nWe are quite sure that it is not in us a work of supererogation to urge\r\nupon our farmers the importance of careful attention to this matter of\r\noutlets. This is one of that class of things which will never be\r\nattended to, if left to be daily watched. We Americans have so much work\r\nto do, that we have no time to be careful and watchful. If a child fall\r\ninto the fire, we take time to snatch him out. If a sheep or ox get\r\nmired in a ditch, we leave our other business, and fly to the rescue.\r\nEven if the cows break into the corn, all hands of us, men and boys and\r\ndogs, leave hoeing or haying, and drive them out. And, by the way, the\r\nfrequency with which most of us have had occasion to leave important\r\nlabors to drive back unruly cattle, rendered lawless by neglect of our\r\nfences, well illustrates a national characteristic. We are earnest,\r\nindustrious, and intent on _doing_. We can look forward to accomplish\r\nany labor, however difficult, but lack the conservatism which preserves\r\nthe fruit of our labors--the \"old fogyism\" which puts on its spectacles\r\nwith most careful adjustment, after wiping the glasses for a clear\r\nsight, and at stated periods, revises its affairs to see if some screw\r\nhas not worked loose. A steward on a large estate, or a corporation\r\nagent, paid for inspecting and superintending, may be relied upon to\r\nexamine his drainage works, and maintain them in repair; but no farmer\r\nin this country, who labors with his own hands, has time even for this\r\nmost essential duty. His policy is, to do his work now, while he is\r\nintent upon it, and not trust to future watchfulness.\r\n\r\nWe speak from personal experience in this matter of outfalls. Our first\r\ndrains ran down into a swamp, and the fall was so slight, that the mains\r\nwere laid as low as possible, so that at every freshet they are\r\noverflowed. We have many times, each season, been compelled to go down,\r\nwith spade and hoe, and clear away the mud which has been trodden up by\r\ncattle around the outlet. Although a small river flows through the\r\npasture, the cows find amusement, or better water, about these drains,\r\nand keep us in constant apprehension of a total obstruction of our\r\nworks. We propose to relieve ourself of this care, by connecting the\r\ndrains together, and building one or more reliable outlets.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATINGS OR SCREENS AT THE OUTLET.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of \"vermin,\" both \"creeping things\" and \"slimy\r\nthings, that crawl with legs,\" which seem to imagine that drains are\r\nconstructed for their especial accommodations. In dry times, it is a\r\nfavorite amusement of moles and mice and snakes, to explore the devious\r\npassages thus fitted up for them, and entering at the capacious open\r\nfront door, they never suspect that the spacious corridors lead to no\r\napartments, that their accommodations, as they progress, grow \"fine by\r\ndegrees and beautifully less,\" and that these are houses with no back\r\ndoors, or even convenient places for turning about for a retreat. Unlike\r\nthe road to Hades, the descent to which is easy, here the ascent is\r\ninviting; though, alike in both cases, \"_revocare gradum, hoc opus hic\r\nlabor est_.\" They persevere upward and onward till they come, in more\r\nsenses than one, to \"an untimely end.\" Perhaps stuck fast in a small\r\npipe tile, they die a nightmare death; or, perhaps overtaken by a\r\nshower, of the effect of which, in their ignorance of the scientific\r\nprinciples of drainage, they had no conception, they are drowned before\r\nthey have time for deliverance from the straight in which they find\r\nthemselves, and so are left, as the poet strikingly expresses it, \"to\r\nlie in cold _obstruction_ and to rot.\"\r\n\r\nIn cold weather, water from the drains is warmer than the open ditch,\r\nand the poor frogs, reluctant to submit to the law of Nature which\r\nrequires them to seek refuge in mud and oblivious sleep, in Winter,\r\ngather round the outfalls, as they do about springs, to bask in the\r\nwarmth of the running water. If the flow is small, they leap up into\r\nthe pipe, and follow its course upward. In Summer, the drains furnish\r\nfor them a cool and shady retreat from the mid-day sun, and they may be\r\nseen in single file by scores, at the approach of an intruding footstep,\r\nscrambling up the pipe. Dying in this way, affects these creatures, as\r\n\"sighing and grief\" did Falstaff, \"blows them up like a bladder;\" and,\r\nlike Sampson, they do more mischief in their death, than in all their\r\nlife together. They swell up, and stop the water entirely, or partially\r\ndam it, so that the effect of the work is impaired.\r\n\r\nTo prevent injuries from this source, there should be, at every outlet,\r\na grating or screen of cast iron, or of copper wire, to prevent the\r\nintrusion of vermin. The screen should be movable, so that any\r\naccumulation in the pipe may be removed. An arrangement of this kind is\r\nshown in Fig. 40, as used in England. We know of nothing of the kind\r\nused in this country. For ourself, we have made of coarse wire-netting,\r\na screen, which is attached to the pipe by hinges of wire. Holes may be\r\nbored with a bit through even a hard tile, or a No. 9 wire may be\r\ntwisted firmly round the end of it, and the screen thus secured.\r\n\r\nThis has thus far, been our own poor and unsatisfactory mode of\r\nprotecting our drains. It is only better than none, but it is not\r\npermanent, and we hope to see some successful invention that may supply\r\nthis want. So far as we have observed, no such precaution is used in\r\nthis country; and in England, farmers and others who take charge of\r\ntheir own drainage works, often run their pipes into the mud in an open\r\nditch, and trust the water to force its own passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF WELLS AND RELIEF PIPES.\r\n\r\nIn draining large tracts of land of uniform surface, it is often\r\nconvenient to have single mains, or even minors, of great length.\r\nObstructions are liable to occur from various causes: and, moreover,\r\nthere is great satisfaction in being certain that all is going right,\r\nand in watching the operation of our subterranean works. It is a common\r\npractice, and to be commended, to so construct our drains, that they may\r\nbe inspected at suspicious points, and that so we may know their real\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, wells, or traps, are introduced at suitable points,\r\ninto which the drains discharge, and from which the water proceeds again\r\nalong its course.\r\n\r\nThese are made of iron, or of stone or brick work, of any size that may\r\nbe thought convenient, secured by covers that may be removed at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nWhere there is danger of obstruction below the wells, relief pipes may\r\nbe introduced, or the wells may overflow, and so discharge temporarily,\r\nthe drainage water. These wells, sometimes called silt basins, or traps,\r\nare frequently used in road drainage, or in sewers where large deposits\r\nare made by the drainage water. The sediment is carried along and\r\ndeposited in the traps, while the water flows past.\r\n\r\nThese traps are large enough for a man to enter, and are occasionally\r\ncleared of their contents.\r\n\r\nWhen good stone, or common brick, are at hand, occasional wells may be\r\neasily constructed. Plank or timber might be used; and we have even seen\r\nan oil cask made to serve the purpose temporarily. In most parts of New\r\nEngland, solid iron castings would not be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe water of thorough-drainage is usually as pure as spring-water, and\r\nsuch wells may often be conveniently used as places for procuring water\r\nfor both man and beast, a consideration well worth a place in\r\narrangements so permanent as those for drainage.\r\n\r\nThe following figures represent very perfect arrangements of this kind,\r\nin actual use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 41 & 42.--WELL WITH SILT BASIN, OR TRAP, AND\r\nCOVER.]\r\n\r\nThe flap attached to a chain at A, is designed to close the incoming\r\ndrain, so as to keep back the water, and thus flush the drain, as it is\r\ntermed, by filling it with water, and then suddenly releasing it. It is\r\nfound that by this process, obstructions by sand, and by per-oxide of\r\niron, may be brought down from the drains, when the flow is usually\r\nfeeble.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL WELLS, OR PEEP-HOLES.\r\n\r\nBy the significant, though not very elegant name of peep-holes, are\r\nmeant openings at junctions, or other convenient points, for watching\r\nthe pulsations of our subterranean arteries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the large structures of wells and traps, such as have\r\nbeen represented, we need small and cheap arrangements, by which we may\r\nsatisfy ourselves and our questioning friends and neighbors, that every\r\npart of our buried treasure, is steadily earning its usury. It is really\r\ngratifying to be able to allow those who \"don't see how water can get\r\ninto the tiles,\" and who inquire so distrustfully whether you \"don't\r\nthink that land on the hill would be just as dry without the drains,\" to\r\nsatisfy themselves, by actually seeing, that there is a liberal flow\r\nthrough all the pipes, even in the now dry soil. And then, again,\r\n\r\n    \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men\r\n        Gang aft agley.\"\r\n\r\nand drains will get obstructed, by one or other of the various means\r\nsuggested in another place. It is then convenient to be able to\r\nascertain with certainty, and at once, the locality of the difficulty,\r\nand this may be done by means of peep-holes.\r\n\r\nThese may be formed of cast iron, or of well-burnt clay, or what is\r\ncalled stone-ware, of 4, 6, or 10 inches internal diameter, and long\r\nenough to reach from the bottom of the drain to the surface, or a little\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nThe drain or drains, coming into this little well, should enter a few\r\ninches above the pipe which carries off the water, so that the incoming\r\nstream may be plainly seen. A strong cover should be fitted to the top,\r\nand secured so as not to cause injury to cattle at work or feeding on\r\nthe land. The arrangement will be at once seen by a sketch given on the\r\nfollowing page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 43 & 44.--SMALL WELL, OR PEEP-HOLE, AND COVER.]\r\n\r\nIn our own fields, we have adopted several expedients to attain this\r\nobject of convenient inspection. In one case, where we have a sub-main,\r\nwhich receives the small drains of an acre of orchard, laid at nearly\r\nfive feet depth, we sunk two 40-gallon oil casks, one upon the other, at\r\nthe junction of this sub-main with another, and fitted upon the top a\r\nstrong wooden cover. The objections to this contrivance are, that it is\r\ntemporary; that it occupies too much room; and that it is more expensive\r\nthan a well of cast iron or stone-ware of proper size.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same field, we had a spring of excellent water,\r\nwhere, \"from the time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the\r\ncontrary,\" people had fancied they found better water to drink, than\r\nanywhere else. It is near a ravine, through which a main drain is\r\nlocated, and which is now graded up into convenient plow land.\r\n\r\nTo preserve this spring for use in the Summer time, we procured a\r\ntin-worker to make a well, of galvanized iron, five feet long and ten\r\ninches diameter, into which are conducted the drain and the spring. A\r\nfriendly hand has sketched it for us very accurately; thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 45 & 46.--HOW TO PRESERVE A SPRING IN A DRAINED\r\nFIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe spring is brought in at _a_ by a few tiles laid into the bank where\r\nthe water naturally bursts out. The pipe _b_ brings in the drain, which\r\nalways flows largely, and the pipe _c_ carries away the water. The small\r\ndipper, marked _d_, hangs inside the well, and is used by every man,\r\nwoman, and boy, who passes that way. The spring enters six inches above\r\nthe drain, for convenience in catching its water to drink.\r\n\r\nBy careful observation the present Winter of 1858-9, the impression that\r\nthere is some peculiar quality in this water is confirmed, for it is\r\nascertained that it is six degrees warmer in cold weather than any other\r\nwater upon the farm. The spring preserves a temperature of about 47°,\r\nwhile the drain running through the same well, and the other drains in\r\nthe field, and the well at the house, vary from 39° to 42°.\r\n\r\nWe confess to the weakness of taking great satisfaction in sipping this\r\nwater, cool in Summer and warm in Winter, and in watching the mingled\r\nstreams of spring and drainage water, and listening as we pass by, to\r\ntheir tinkling sound, which, like the faithful watchman of the night,\r\nproclaims that \"all is well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION AND SIZE OF THE MAINS.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed on the proper position of the outlet, for the whole, or any\r\nportion of our work, the next consideration is the location of the\r\ndrains that shall discharge at that point. It is convenient to speak of\r\nthe different drains as _mains_, _sub-mains_, and _minors_. By _mains_,\r\nare understood the principal drains, of whatever material, the office of\r\nwhich is, to receive and carry away water collected by other drains from\r\nthe soil. By _minors_, are intended the small drains which receive the\r\nsurplus water directly from the soil. By _sub-mains_, are meant such\r\nintermediate drains as are frequently in large fields, interposed across\r\nthe line of the minors, to receive their discharge, and conduct their\r\nwater to the mains.\r\n\r\nThey are principally used, where there is a greater length of small\r\ndrains in one direction than it is thought expedient to use; or where,\r\nfrom the unequal surface, it is necessary to lay out subordinate systems\r\nof drains, to reach particular localities.\r\n\r\nWhether after the outlet is located, the mains or minors should next be\r\nlaid out, is not perhaps very important. The natural course would seem\r\nto be, to lay out the mains according to the surface formation of the\r\nland, through the principal hollows of the field, although we have high\r\nauthority for commencing with the minors, and allowing their\r\nappropriate direction to determine the location of the mains.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, rather a question of precedence and etiquette, than of\r\npractical importance. The only safe mode of executing so important a\r\nwork as drainage, is by careful surveys by persons of sufficient skill,\r\nto lay out the whole field of operations, before the ground is broken;\r\nto take all the levels; to compare all the different slopes; consider\r\nall the circumstances, and arrange the work as a systematic whole.\r\nGenerally, there will be no conflict of circumstances, as to where the\r\nmains shall be located. They must be lower than the minors, because they\r\nreceive their water. They must ordinarily run across the direction of\r\nthe minors, either at right angles or diagonally, because otherwise they\r\ncannot receive their discharge. If, then, in general, the minors, as we\r\nassume, run down the slope, the mains must run at the foot of the slope\r\nand across it.\r\n\r\nIt will be found in practice, that all the circumstances alluded to,\r\nwill combine to locate the mains across the foot of regular slopes; and\r\nwhether in straight or curved lines, along through the natural valleys\r\nof the field.\r\n\r\nIn locating the mains, regard must always be had to the quantity of\r\nwater and to the fall. Where a field is of regular slope, and the\r\ndescent very slight, it will be necessary, in order to gain for the main\r\nthe requisite fall, to run it diagonally across the bottom of the slope,\r\nthus taking into it a portion of the fall of the slope. If the fall\r\nrequires to be still more increased, often the main may be deepened\r\ntowards the outlet, so as to gain fall sufficient, even on level ground.\r\n\r\nIf the fall is very slight, the size of the main may be made to\r\ncompensate in part for want of fall, for it will not be forgotten, that\r\nthe capacity of a pipe to convey water depends much on the velocity of\r\nthe current, and the velocity increases in proportion to the fall. If\r\nthe fall and consequent velocity be small, the water will require a\r\nlarger drain to carry it freely along. The size of the mains should be\r\nsufficient to convey, with such fall as is attainable, the greatest\r\nquantity of water that may ever be expected to reach them. Beyond this,\r\nan increase of size is rather a disadvantage than otherwise, because a\r\nsmall flow of water runs with more velocity when compressed in a narrow\r\nchannel, than when broadly spread, and so has more power to force its\r\nway, and carry before it obstructing substances.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in considering the size of tiles, that in laying the minor\r\ndrains, their capacity to carry all the water that may reach them is not\r\nthe only limit of their size. A one-inch tile might in many cases be\r\nsufficient to conduct the water; but the best drainers, after much\r\ncontroversy on the point, now all agree that this is a size too small\r\nfor prudent use, because so small an opening is liable to be obstructed\r\nby a very slight deposit from the water, or by a slight displacement,\r\nand because the joints furnish small space for the admission of water.\r\n\r\nMains, however, being designed merely to carry off such water as they\r\nmay receive from other drains, may in general be limited to the size\r\nsufficient to convey such water, at the greatest flow. It might seem a\r\nnatural course, to proportion the capacity of the main to the capacity\r\nof the smaller drains that fall into it; and this would be the true\r\nrule, were the small drains expected to run full.\r\n\r\nIf our smallest drain, however, be of two-inch, or even one and a half\r\ninch bore, it can hardly be expected to fill at any time, unless of\r\ngreat length, or in some peculiarly wet place. Considering, then, what\r\nquantity of water will be likely to be conducted into the main,\r\nproportion the main not to the capacity of all the smaller drains\r\nleading into it, but to the probable maximum flow--not to what they\r\n_might_ bring into it, but to what they _will_ bring.\r\n\r\nIf the mains be of three-inch pipes, other things being equal, their\r\ncapacity is nine times that of a one-inch pipe, and two and a quarter\r\ntimes the capacity of a two-inch pipe.\r\n\r\nA three-inch main may, then, with equal fall and directness, be safely\r\nrelied on to carry nine streams of water equal each to one inch\r\ndiameter, or two and a quarter streams, equal to a two-inch stream. The\r\nthree-inch main will, in fact, from the less amount of friction, carry\r\nmuch more than this proportion.\r\n\r\nThe allowance to be made for a less fall in the mains, has already been\r\nadverted to, and must not be overlooked. It is believed that the\r\ncapacity of a three or four-inch pipe to convey water, is in general\r\nlikely to be much under-estimated.\r\n\r\nIt is a common error, to imagine that some large stone water-course must\r\nbe necessary to carry off so large a flow as will be collected by a\r\nsystem over a ten or twenty-acre field. Any one, however, who has\r\nwatched the full flow of even a three-inch pipe, and observed the water\r\nafter it has fallen into a nearly level ditch, will be aware, that what\r\nseems in the ditch a large stream, impeded as it is by a rough, uneven\r\nbottom, may pass through a three inch opening of smooth, well-jointed\r\npipes. When we consider that a four-inch pipe is four times as capacious\r\nas a two-inch pipe, and sixteen times as large as a one-inch pipe, we\r\nmay see that we may accommodate any quantity of water that may be likely\r\nanywhere to be collected by drainage, without recourse to other\r\nmaterials than tiles.\r\n\r\nWhen one three or four-inch pipe is not sufficient to convey the water,\r\nmains may conveniently be formed of two or more tiles of any form. A\r\nmain drain is sometimes formed by combining two horse-shoe tiles, with a\r\ntile sole or slate between them, to prevent slipping, as in fig. 47.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Fig. 48.\r\n\r\nMain Drain of two or more Horse-shoe Tiles.]\r\n\r\nThe combinations represented in the above figures, will furnish\r\nsufficient suggestions to enable any one to select or arrange such forms\r\nas may be deemed best suited to the case in hand. Where the largest\r\nobtainable tile is not large enough, two or more lines of pipes may be\r\nlaid abreast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE MINOR DRAINS.\r\n\r\nAssuming that it is desirable to run the small drains, as far as\r\npracticable, up and down the slope, the following directions, from the\r\nCyclopedia of Agriculture, are given:\r\n\r\n     \"There is a very simple mode of laying out these (the minor\r\n     drains), which will apply to most cases, or, indeed, to all,\r\n     although in some its application may be more difficult. The surface\r\n     of each field must be regarded as being made up of one or more\r\n     planes, as the case may be, for each of which the drains should be\r\n     laid out separately. Level lines are to be set out, a little below\r\n     the upper edge of each of these planes, and the drains must be then\r\n     made to cross these lines at right angles. By this means, the\r\n     drains will run in the line of the greatest slope, no matter how\r\n     distorted the surface of the field may be.\"\r\n\r\nMuch is said, in the English books, about \"furrows,\" and the\r\n\"direction of the furrows,\" in connection with the laying out of drains.\r\nMuch of the land in England, especially in moist places, was formerly\r\nlaid up by repeated plowings, into ridges varying in breadth from ten to\r\ntwenty feet, so as to throw off, readily, the water from the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PART OF FIELD Thoroughly Drained BY B F. NOURSE\r\nORRINGTON, ME.]\r\n\r\nThese ridges were sometimes so high, that two boys in opposite furrows,\r\nbetween the ridges, could not see each other. In draining lands thus\r\nridged, it is found far more easy to cut the ditches in the furrows,\r\nrather than across or upon the ridges. After thorough-drainage, in most\r\nlocalities, these ridges and furrows are dispensed with. The fact is,\r\nprobably, only important here, as explaining the constant reference by\r\nEnglish writers to this mode of working the land.\r\n\r\nWhether we shall drain \"down the furrows,\" or \"across the ridges,\" is\r\nnot likely to be inquired of, by Americans.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram represents a field of about thirty acres, as\r\ndrained by the owner, B. F. Nourse, Esq., of Orrington, Me., a\r\nparticular description of which will be found in another place.\r\n\r\nThe curves of the ends of the minors, at their junction with the mains,\r\nwill indicate their course--the minors curving always so as to more\r\nnearly coincide, in course, with the current of water in the mains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUNCTION OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\nMuch difficulty arises in practice, as to connecting, in a secure and\r\nsatisfactory manner, the smaller with the larger drains. It has already\r\nbeen suggested, that the streams should not meet at right angles, but\r\nthat a bend should be made in the smaller drain, a few feet before it\r\nenters the main, so as to introduce the water of the small drain in the\r\ndirection of the current in the main. In another place, an instance is\r\ngiven where it was found that a quantity of water was discharged with a\r\nturn, or junction with a gentle curve, in 100 seconds, that required 140\r\nseconds with a turn at right angles; and that while running direct, that\r\nis, without any turn, it was discharged in 90 seconds. This is given as\r\na mere illustration of the principle, which is obvious enough. Different\r\nexperiments would vary with the velocity, quantity of water, and\r\nsmoothness of the pipe; but nothing is more certain, than that every\r\nchange of direction impedes velocity.\r\n\r\nThus we see that if we had but a single drain, the necessary turns\r\nshould be curved, to afford the least obstruction.\r\n\r\nWhere the drain enters into another current, there is yet a further\r\nobstruction, by the meeting of the two streams. Two equal streams, of\r\nsimilar velocity and size, thus meeting at right angles, would have a\r\ntendency to move off diagonally, if not confined by the pipe; and,\r\nconfined as they are, must both be materially retarded in their flow. In\r\nwhatever manner united, there must be much obstruction, if the main is\r\nnearly full, at the point of junction. The common mode of connecting\r\nhorse-shoe tile-drains is shown thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--JUNCTION OF DRAINS.]\r\n\r\nHaving no tiles made for the purpose, we, at first, formed the union by\r\nmeans of common hard bricks. Curving down the small drain toward the\r\ndirection of the main, we left a space between two tiles of the main, of\r\ntwo or three inches, and brought down the last tile of the small drain\r\nto this opening, placing under the whole a flat stone, slate, or bricks,\r\nor a plank, to keep all firm at the bottom. Then we set bricks on edge\r\non all sides, and covered the space at the top with one or more, as\r\nnecessary, and secured carefully against sand and the like.\r\n\r\nWe have since procured branch-pipes to be made at the tile-works, such\r\nas are in use in England, and find them much more satisfactory. The\r\nbranches may be made to join the mains at any angle, and it might be\r\nadvisable to make this part of both drains larger than the rest, to\r\nallow room for the obstructed waters to unite peacefully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. BRANCH PIPES.]\r\n\r\nThe mains should be from three to six inches deeper than the minors. The\r\nfall from one to the other may usually be made most conveniently, by a\r\ngradual descent of three or four feet to the point of junction; but with\r\nbranch-pipes, the fall may be nearly vertical, if desired, by turning\r\nthe branch upward, to meet the small pipe. It will be necessary, in\r\nprocuring branches for sole-tiles, to bear in mind that they are \"rights\r\nand lefts,\" and must be selected accordingly, as the branch comes in\r\nupon the one or other side of the main.\r\n\r\nThe branch should enter the larger pipe not level with the bottom, but\r\nas high as possible, to give an inch fall to the water passing out of\r\nthe branch into the main, to prevent possible obstruction at the\r\njunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE INTO WELLS, OR SWALLOW HOLES.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of our country, there are lands lying too flat for\r\nconvenient drainage in the ordinary methods, or too remote from any good\r\noutlet, or perhaps enclosed by lands of others who will not consent to\r\nan outfall through their domain, where the drainage water may be\r\ndischarged into wells.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Washington, on Capitol Hill, it is a common practice to\r\ndrain cellars into what are termed \"dry wells.\" The surface formation is\r\na close red clay, of a few feet thickness, and then comes a stratum of\r\ncoarse gravel; and the wells for water are sunk often as deep as sixty\r\nfeet, indicating that the water-table lies very low. The heavy storms\r\nand showers fill the surface soil beyond saturation, and the water\r\ngushes out, literally, into the cellars and other low places. A dry\r\nwell, sunk through the clay, conducts this water into the gravel bed,\r\nand this carries it away. This idea is often applied to land drainage.\r\nIt is believed that there are immense tracts of fertile land at the\r\nWest, upon limestone, where the surface might readily be relieved of\r\nsurplus water, by conducting the mains into wells dug for the purpose.\r\nIn some places, there are openings called \"sink-holes,\" caused by the\r\nsinking of masses of earth, as in the neighborhood of the city of St.\r\nLouis, which would afford outlets for all the water that could be poured\r\ninto them. In the Report of the Tioga County Agricultural Society for\r\n1857, it is said in the _Country Gentleman_, that instances are given,\r\nwhere swamps were drained through the clay bottom into the underlying\r\ngravelly soil, by digging wells and filling them with stones.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 7, at page 82, is shown a \"fault\" in the stratification of the\r\nearth; which faults, it is said, so completely carry off water, that\r\nwells cannot be sunk so as to reach it.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton says that in several parts of England, advantage is taken of\r\nthe natural drainage existing beneath wet clay soils, by concentrating\r\nthe drains to holes, called \"swallow-holes.\" He says this practice is\r\nopen to the objection that those holes do not always absorb the water\r\nwith sufficient rapidity, and so render the drainage for a time,\r\ninoperative.\r\n\r\nThese wells are liable, too, to be obstructed in their operation by\r\ntheir bottoms being puddled with the clay carried into them by the\r\nwater, and so becoming impervious. This point would require occasional\r\nattention, and the removal of such deposits.\r\n\r\nThis principle of drainage was alluded to at the American Institute,\r\nFebruary 14, 1859, by Professor Nash. He states, that there are large\r\ntracts of land having clay soil, with sand or gravel beneath the clay,\r\nwhich yet need drainage, and suggests that this may be effected by\r\nmerely boring frequent holes, and filling them with pebbles, without\r\nditches. In all such soils, if the mode suggested prove insufficient,\r\nlarge wells of proper depth, stoned up, or otherwise protected, might\r\nobviously serve as cheap and convenient outlets for a regular system of\r\npipe or stone drains.\r\n\r\nMr. Bergen, at the same meeting, stated that such clayey soil, based on\r\ngravel, was the character of much of the land on Long Island; and we\r\ncannot doubt that on the prairies of the West, where the wells are\r\nfrequently of great depth to obtain water for use, wells or\r\nswallow-holes to receive it, may often be found useful. Whenever the\r\nwater-line is twenty or thirty feet below the surface, it is certain\r\nthat it will require a large amount of water poured in at the surface of\r\na well to keep it filled for any considerable length of time. The same\r\nprinciple that forces water into wells, that is, pressure from a higher\r\nsource, will allow its passage out when admitted at the top.\r\n\r\nWe close this chapter with a letter from Mr. Denton. The extract\r\nreferred to, has been here omitted, because we have already, in the\r\nchapter preceding this, given Mr. Denton's views, expressed more fully\r\nupon the same subject, with his own illustrations.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that the letter was in reply to inquiries upon\r\nparticular points, which, although disconnected, are all of interest,\r\nwhen touched upon by one whose opinions are so valuable.\r\n\r\n                      \"LONDON, 52 Parliament Street, Westminster, S. W.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR:--I have received your letter of the 17th August, and\r\n     hasten to reply to it.\r\n\r\n     \"I am gratified at the terms in which you speak of my\r\n     roughly-written 'Essays on Land Drainage.' If you have not seen my\r\n     published letter to Lord Berners, and my recent essay 'On the\r\n     Advantages of a Daily Record of Rain-fall,' I should much like you\r\n     to look over them, for my object in both has been to check the\r\n     uniformity of treatment which too much prevails with those who are\r\n     officially called upon to direct draining, and who still treat\r\n     mixed soils and irregular surfaces pretty much in the same way as\r\n     homogeneous clays and even surfaces, the only difference being,\r\n     that the distance between the drains is increased. We have now,\r\n     without doubt, arrived at that point in the practice of draining in\r\n     this country, which necessitates a revision of all the principles\r\n     and rules which have been called into force by the Drainage Acts,\r\n     and the institution of the Drainage Commission, whose duty it is to\r\n     administer those Acts, and to protect the interests of\r\n     Reversioners.\r\n\r\n     \"This protection is, in a great measure, performed by the\r\n     intervention of 'Inspectors of Drainage,' whose subordinate duty it\r\n     is to see that the improvements provisionally sanctioned are\r\n     carried out according to certain implied, if not fixed, rules. This\r\n     is done by measuring depth and distance, which tends to a _parallel\r\n     system (4 feet deep) in all soils_, which was Smith of Deanston's\r\n     notion, only his drains were shallower, _i.e._, from 2 to 3 feet\r\n     deep.\r\n\r\n     \"Some rules were undoubtedly necessary when the Commissioners first\r\n     commenced dispensing the public money, and I do not express my\r\n     objection to the absurd position to which these rules are bringing\r\n     us, from any disrespect to them, nor with an idea that any better\r\n     course could have been followed by the Government, in the first\r\n     instance, than the adoption of the '_Parkes--Smith frequent drain\r\n     system_.' This system was correctly applied, and continues to be\r\n     correctly applied, to absorbent and retentive soils requiring the\r\n     aeration of frequent drains to counteract their retentive nature;\r\n     but it is altogether misapplied when adopted in the outcropping\r\n     surfaces of the free water-bearing strata, which, though equally\r\n     wet, are frequently drained by a comparatively few drains, at less\r\n     than half the cost.\r\n\r\n     \"The only circumstance that can excuse the indiscriminate adoption\r\n     of a parallel system, is the fact, that all drains do some good,\r\n     and the chances of a cure being greater in proportion to the number\r\n     of drains, it was not necessary to insist upon that judgment which\r\n     ten years' experience should now give.\r\n\r\n     \"My views on this point will perhaps be best understood by the\r\n     following extract from an address I recently delivered.

It seems to us, that the prices at which\r\ntiles have thus far been sold in this country, are very far above those\r\nat which they may be profitably manufactured, when the business is well\r\nunderstood, and pursued upon a scale large enough to justify the use of\r\nthe best machinery. The following is a copy of the published prices of\r\ntiles at the Albany Tile Works, and the same prices prevail throughout\r\nNew England, so far as known:\r\n\r\n      _Horse-shoe Tile--Pieces._\r\n\r\n    2-1/2 inches rise  $12 per 1000.\r\n    3-1/2   \"      \"    15    \"\r\n    4-1/2   \"      \"    18    \"\r\n    5-1/2   \"      \"    40    \"\r\n    6-1/2   \"      \"    60    \"\r\n    7-1/2   \"      \"    75    \"\r\n\r\n      _Sole-Tile--Pieces._\r\n\r\n    2     inches rise  $12 per 1000.\r\n    3       \"      \"    18    \"\r\n    4       \"      \"    40    \"\r\n    5       \"      \"    60    \"\r\n    6       \"      \"    80    \"\r\n    8       \"      \"   125    \"\r\n\r\nFew round pipe-tiles have yet been used in this country, although they\r\nare the kind generally preferred by engineers in England. The prices of\r\nround tiles would vary little from those of sole-tiles.\r\n\r\nTiles are usually cut fourteen inches long, and shorten, in drying and\r\nburning, to about twelve and a half inches, so that, with breaking and\r\nother casualties, they may be calculated to lay about one foot each;\r\nthat is to say, 1,000 tiles may be expected to lay 1,000 feet of drains.\r\n\r\nTo assist those who desire to manufacture tiles for sale, or for private\r\nuse, it is proposed to give such information as has been gathered from\r\nvarious sources as to the cost of making, and the selling prices of\r\ntiles, in England. The following is a memorandum made at the residence\r\nof Mr. Thomas Crisp, at Butley Abbey, in Suffolk Co., Eng., from\r\ninformation given the author on the 8th of July, 1857:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisp makes his own tiles, and also supplies his neighbors who need\r\nthem. He sells one and a half inch pipes at 12s. ($3) per 1,000. He pays\r\n5s. ($1.25) per 1,000 for having them made and burnt. His machine is\r\nWaller's patent, No. 22, made by Garrett and Son, Leiston, Saxemundham,\r\nSuffolk. It works by a lever, makes five one and a half inch pipes at\r\nonce, or three sole-tiles about two-inch. The man at work said, that he,\r\nwith a man to carry away, &c., could make 4,000 one and a half inch\r\npipes per day. They used no screen, but cut the clay with a wire. The\r\nmachine cost £25 (about $125). At the kiln, which is permanent, the\r\ntiles are set on end, and bricks with them in the same kiln. They\r\nrequire less heat than bricks, and _cost about half as much_ as bricks\r\nhere, which are moulded ten inches by five.\r\n\r\n\"Two girls were loading bricks into a horse-cart, and two women\r\nreceiving them, and setting them in the kiln. They made roof-tiles with\r\nthe same machine, and also moulded large ones by hand. The wages of the\r\nwomen are about 8d. (sixteen cents) per day.\"\r\n\r\nAt the exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society, in England, the\r\nauthor saw Williams' Tile Machine in operation, and was there informed\r\nby the exhibitor, who said he was a tile-maker, that it requires\r\n_five-sevenths as much coal_ to burn 1,000 two-inch tiles, as 1,000\r\nbricks--the size of bricks being 10 by 5; and he declared, that he, with\r\none boy, could make with the machine, 7,000 two-inch tiles per day,\r\nafter the clay is prepared. Of course, one other person, at least, must\r\nbe employed to carry off the tiles.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton gives his estimates of the prices at which pipe-tiles may be\r\nprocured in England, as follows--the prices, which he gives in English\r\ncurrency, being translated into our own:\r\n\r\n     \"When ordinary agricultural labor is worth $2 50 per week, pipes\r\n     half one and a half inch, and half two-inch, maybe taken at an\r\n     average cost of $4 38 per 1,000. When labor is $3 00 per week, the\r\n     pipes will average $5 00 per 1,000, and when labor is $3 50, they\r\n     will rise to $5 62.\"\r\n\r\n     He adds: \"In giving the above average cost of materials, those\r\n     districts are excluded from consideration, where clay suitable for\r\n     pipes, exists in the immediate vicinity of coal-pits, which must\r\n     necessarily reduce the cost of producing them very considerably.\"\r\n\r\nTaking the averages of several careful estimates of the cost of tiles\r\nand bricks, from the \"Cyclopædia of Agriculture,\" we have the price of\r\ntiles in England about $5 per 1,000, and the price of bricks $7.87, from\r\nwhich the duty of 5s. 6d. should be deducted, leaving the average price\r\nof bricks $6.50. Upon tiles there is no such duty. Bricks in the United\r\nStates are made of different sizes, varying from 8 × 4 in. to the\r\nEnglish standard 10 × 5 in. Perhaps a fair average price for bricks of\r\nthe latter size, would be not far from $5 per 1,000; certainly below\r\n$6.50 per 1,000. There is no reason why tiles may not be manufactured in\r\nthe United States, as cheaply, compared with the prices of bricks, as in\r\nEngland; and it is quite clear that tiles of the sizes named, are far\r\ncheaper there than common bricks.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanted in this country is, first, a demand sufficient to\r\nauthorize the establishment of works extensive enough to make tiles at\r\nthe best advantage; next, competent skill to direct and perform the\r\nlabor; and, finally, the best machinery and fixtures for the purpose. It\r\nis confidently predicted, that, whenever the business of tile-making\r\nbecomes properly established, the ingenuity of American machinists will\r\nrender it easy to manufacture tiles at English prices, notwithstanding\r\nthe lower price of labor there; and that we shall be supplied with small\r\ntiles in all parts of the country at about the current prices of bricks,\r\nor at about one half the present Albany prices of tiles, as given at the\r\nhead of this chapter. It should be mentioned here, perhaps, that, in\r\nEngland, it is common to burn tiles and bricks together in the same\r\nkiln, placing the tiles away from the hottest parts of the furnace; as,\r\nbeing but about half an inch in thickness, they require less heat to\r\nburn them than bricks.\r\n\r\nIn the estimates of labor in making tiles in England, a small item is\r\nusually included for \"rolling.\" Round pipes are chiefly used in England.\r\nWhen partly dried, they are taken up on a round stick, and rolled upon a\r\nsmall table, to preserve their exact form. Tiles usually flatten\r\nsomewhat in drying, which is not of importance in any but round pipes,\r\nbut those ought to be uniform. By this process of rolling, great\r\nexactness of shape, and a great degree of smoothness inside, are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILE MACHINES.\r\n\r\nDrainage with tiles is a new branch of husbandry in America. The cost of\r\ntiles is now a great obstacle in prosecuting much work of this kind\r\nwhich land-owners desire to accomplish. The cost of tiles, and so the\r\ncost of drainage, depends very much--it may be said, chiefly--upon the\r\nperfection of the machinery for tile-making; and here, as almost\r\neverywhere else, agriculture and the mechanic arts go hand in hand.\r\nLabor is much dearer in America than in Europe, and there is, therefore,\r\nmore occasion here than there, for applying mechanical power to\r\nagriculture. We can have no cheap drainage until we have cheap tiles;\r\nand we can have cheap tiles only by having them made with the most\r\nperfect machinery, and at the lowest prices at which competing\r\nmanufacturers, who understand their business, can afford them.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding remarks on the _cost of tiles_, may be found estimates,\r\nwhich will satisfy any thinking man that tiles have not yet been sold in\r\nAmerica at reasonably low prices.\r\n\r\nTo give those who may desire to establish tileries, either for public or\r\nprivate supply, information, which cannot readily be obtained without\r\ngreat expense of English books, as to the prices of tile machines, it is\r\nnow proposed to give some account of the best English machines, and of\r\nsuch American inventions as have been brought to notice.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance that American machinists and inventors should be\r\napprised of the progress that has been made abroad in perfecting tile\r\nmachines; because, as the subject attracts attention, the ingenuity of\r\nthe universal Yankee nation will soon be directed toward the discovery\r\nof improvements in all the processes of tile-making. Tiles were made by\r\nhand long before tile machines were invented.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Read, in the \"Royal Agricultural Journal,\" claims to have used\r\n_pipe_ tiles as early as 1795, made by hand, and formed on a round\r\nstick. No machine for making tiles is described, before that of Mr.\r\nBeart's, in 1840, by which \"common tile and sole (not pipes or tubes)\r\nwere made.\" This machine, however, was of simple structure, and not\r\nadapted to the varieties of tiles now used.\r\n\r\nAll tile machines seem to operate on the same general principle--that of\r\nforcing wet clay, of the consistency of that used in brick-making,\r\nthrough apertures of the desired shape and size. To make the mass thus\r\nforced through the aperture, _hollow_, the hole must have a piece of\r\nmetal in the centre of it, around which the clay forms, as it is pushed\r\nalong. This centre piece is kept in position by one or two thin pieces\r\nof iron, which of course divide the clay which passes over them, but it\r\nunites again as it is forced through the die, and comes out sound, and\r\nis then cut off, usually by hand, by means of a small wire, of the\r\nrequired length, about fourteen inches.\r\n\r\nTile machines work either vertically or horizontally. The most primitive\r\nmachine which came to the author's notice abroad, was one which we saw\r\non our way from London to Mr. Mechi's place. It was a mere upright\r\ncylinder, of some two feet height, and perhaps eight inches diameter, in\r\nwhich worked a piston. The clay was thrown into the cylinder, and the\r\npiston brought down by means of a brake, like an old-fashioned pump, and\r\na single round pipe-tile forced out at the bottom. The force employed\r\nwas one man and two boys. One boy screened the clay, by passing through\r\nit a wire in various directions, holding the wire by the ends, and\r\ncutting through the mass till he had found all the small stones\r\ncontained in it. The man threw the masses thus prepared, into the\r\ncylinder, and put on the brake, and the other boy received the tiles\r\nupon a round stick, as they came down through the die at the bottom, and\r\nlaid them away. The cylinder held clay enough to make several, perhaps\r\ntwenty, two-inch pipes. The work was going on in a shed without a floor,\r\nand upon a liberal estimate, the whole establishment, including shed and\r\nmachine, could not cost more than fifty dollars. Yet, on this simple\r\nplan, tiles were moulded much more rapidly than bricks were made in the\r\nsame yard, where they were moulded singly, as they usually are in\r\nEngland. It was said that this force could thus mould about 1,800 small\r\ntiles per day.\r\n\r\nThis little machine seems to be the same described by Mr. Parkes as in\r\ngeneral use in 1843, in Kent and Suffolk Counties.\r\n\r\nMost of the tile machines now in use in England and America, are so\r\nconstructed, as to force out the tiles upon a horizontal frame-work,\r\nabout five two-inch, or three three-inch pipes abreast. The box to\r\ncontain the clay may be upright or horizontal, and the power may be\r\napplied to a wheel, by a crank turned by a man, or by horse, steam, or\r\nwater power, according to the extent of the works.\r\n\r\nWe saw at the Exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society, at\r\nSalisbury, in England, in July, 1857, the \"pipe and tile machine,\" of W.\r\nWilliams, of Bedford. It was in operation, for exhibition, and was\r\nworked by one man, who said he was a tile maker, and that he and one boy\r\ncould make with the machine 7,000 two-inch tiles per day, after the clay\r\nwas prepared in the pug mill. Four tiles were formed at once, by clay\r\npassed through four dies, and the box holds clay enough for thirty-two\r\ntwo-inch tiles, so that thirty-two are formed as quickly as they can be\r\nremoved, and as many more, as soon as the box can be refilled.\r\n\r\nThe size, No. 3, of this machine, such as we then saw in operation, and\r\nwhich is suitable for common use, costs at Bedford $88.50, with one set\r\nof dies; and the extra dies, for making three, four, and six-inch pipes,\r\nand other forms, if desired, with the _horses_, as they are called, for\r\nremoving the tiles, cost about five dollars each.\r\n\r\nThis, like most other tile machines, is adapted to making tiles for\r\nroofs, much used in England instead of shingles or slates, as well as\r\nfor draining purposes.\r\n\r\nThere are several machines now in use in England namely: Etheridge's,\r\nClayton's, Scragg's, Whitehead's, and Garrett's--either of which would\r\nbe satisfactory, according to the amount of work desired.\r\n\r\nWe have in America several patented machines for making tiles, of the\r\ncomparative merits of which we are unable to give a satisfactory\r\njudgment. We will, however, allude to two or three, advising those who\r\nare desirous to purchase, to make personal examination for themselves.\r\nWe are obliged to rely chiefly on the statements of the manufacturers\r\nfor our opinions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAINES' DRAIN TILE MAKER]\r\n\r\nDaines' American Drain Tile Machine is manufactured at Birmingham,\r\nMichigan, by John Daines. This machine is in use in Exeter, N. H., close\r\nby the author's residence, and thus far proves satisfactory. The price\r\nof it is about $100, and the weight, about five hundred pounds. It\r\noccupies no more space than a common three-and-a-half foot table, and is\r\nworked by a man at a crank. It is capable of turning out, by man power,\r\nabout two hundred and fifty two-inch tiles in an hour, after the clay is\r\nprepared in a pug mill. Horse or water power can be readily attached to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe give a drawing of it, not because we are sure it is the best, but\r\nbecause we are sure it is a good machine, and to illustrate the\r\nprinciple upon which all these machines are constructed.\r\n\r\nPratt's Tile Machine is manufactured at Canandaigua, New York, by Pratt\r\n& Brothers, and is in use in various places in that State as well as\r\nelsewhere. This machine differs from Daines' in this essential matter,\r\nthat here the clay is _pugged_, or tempered, and formed into tiles at\r\none operation, while with Daines' machine, the clay is first passed\r\nthrough a pug mill, as it is for making bricks in the common process.\r\n\r\nPratt's machine is worked by one or two horses, or by steam or water\r\npower, as is convenient. The price of the smaller size, worked by one\r\nhorse, is $150, and the price of the larger size, worked by two horses,\r\n$200. Professor Mapes says he saw this machine in operation and\r\nconsiders it \"perfect in all its parts.\" The patentees claim that they\r\ncan make, with the one-horse machine, 5,000 large tiles a day. They\r\nstate also that \"two horses will make tiles about as cheap as bricks are\r\nusually made, and as fast, with the large-sized machine.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--PRATT'S TILE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThese somewhat indefinite statements are all that we can give, at\r\npresent, of the capacity of the machines. We should have no hesitation\r\nin ordering a Pratt machine were we desirous of entering into an\r\nextensive business of Tile-making, and we should feel quite safe with a\r\nDaines' machine for a more limited manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALISBURY'S TILE MACHINE.\r\n\r\nS. C. Salisbury, at the Novelty Works, in the city of New York, is\r\nmanufacturing a machine for making tiles and bricks, which exhibits some\r\nnew and peculiar features, worthy of attention by those who propose to\r\npurchase tile machines. Prof. Mapes expresses the confident opinion that\r\nthis machine excels all others, in its capacity to form tiles with\r\nrapidity and economy. We have examined only a working model. It is\r\nclaimed that the large size, with horse-power, will make 20,000 two-inch\r\ntiles per day, and the hand-power machine 3,000 per day. We advise tile\r\nmakers to examine all these machines in operation, before purchasing\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n     Draining no more expensive than Fencing.--Engineering.--Guessing\r\n     not accurate enough.--Slight Fall sufficient.--Instances.--Two\r\n     Inches to One Thousand Feet.--Cost of Excavation and\r\n     Filling.--Narrow Tools required.--Tables of Cubic contents of\r\n     Drains.--Cost of Drains on our own Farm.--Cost of Tiles.--Weight\r\n     and Freight of Tiles.--Cost of Outlets.--Cost of Collars.--Smaller\r\n     Tiles used with Collars.--Number of Tiles to the Acre, with\r\n     Tables.--Length of Tiles varies.--Number of Rods to the Acre at\r\n     different Distances.--Final Estimate of Cost.--Comparative Cost of\r\n     Tile-Drains and Stone-Drains.\r\n\r\n\r\nA prudent man, intending to execute a work, whether it be \"to build a\r\ntower,\" or drain a field, \"sitteth down first and counteth the cost,\r\nwhether he hath sufficient to finish it.\" There is good sense and\r\ndiscretion in the inquisitiveness which suggests so often the inquiry,\r\n\"How much does it cost to drain an acre?\" or, \"How much does it cost a\r\nrod to lay drains?\" These questions cannot be answered so briefly as\r\nthey are asked; yet much information can be given, which will aid one\r\nwho will investigate the subject.\r\n\r\nThe process of drainage is expensive, as compared with the price of land\r\nin our new settlements; but its cost will not alarm those who have been\r\naccustomed to see the improvements made in New England upon well\r\ncultivated farms. Compared with the labor and cost of building and\r\nmaintaining FENCES upon the highways, and in the subdivisions of lots,\r\ncommon in the Eastern States, the drainage of land is a small matter.\r\nWe see in many places long stretches of faced walls, on the line of our\r\nroads near towns and villages, which cost from two to five dollars per\r\nrod. Our common \"stone walls\" in these States cost about one dollar per\r\nrod to build originally; and almost any kind of wooden fence costs as\r\nmuch. Upon fences, there is occasion for annual repairs, while drains\r\nproperly laid, are permanent.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are thrown out, that farmers may not be alarmed\r\nwithout cause, at the high cash estimates of the cost of drainage\r\noperations. Money comes slowly to farmers, and a cash estimate looks\r\nlarger to them than an estimate in labor. The cost of fencing seems no\r\ngreat burden; though, estimated in cash, it would seem, as in fact it\r\nis, a severe charge.\r\n\r\nDrainage can be performed principally by the same kind of labor as\r\nfencing, the cost of the tiles being a small item in the whole expense.\r\nThe estimates of labor will be made at one dollar per day, in\r\ninvestigating this matter.\r\n\r\nThis would be the fair cash value of work by the day, perhaps; but it is\r\nfar more than farmers, who have work in hand on their own farms, which\r\nmay be executed in the leisure season after haying, and even into the\r\nWinter, when convenient, will really expend for such labor. Few farm\r\noperations would pay expenses, if every hour of superintendence, and\r\nevery hour of labor by man and boy and beast, were set down at this high\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the tiles will, ordinarily, be a cash item, and the labor\r\nmay be performed like that of planting, hoeing, haying, and harvesting,\r\nby such \"help\" hired by the mouth or day, or rendered by the family, as\r\nmay be found convenient.\r\n\r\nThe cost of drainage may be considered conveniently, to borrow a\r\nclerical phrase, \"under the following heads.\"\r\n\r\n1. _Laying out, or Engineering._--In arranging our Spring's work, we\r\ndevote time and attention to laying it out, though this hardly forms an\r\nitem in the expense of the crop. Most farmers may think themselves\r\ncompetent to lay out their drainage-works, without paying for the\r\nscientific skill of an engineer, or even of a surveyor.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that generally, it will be found true economy,\r\nto procure the aid of an experienced engineer, if convenient, to lay out\r\nthe work at the outset. Certainly, in most cases, some skill in the use\r\nof levelling instruments, at least, is absolutely essential to\r\nsystematic work. No man, however experienced, can, by the eye, form any\r\nsafe opinion of the fall of a given tract of land. Fields which appear\r\nperfectly level to the eye, will be found frequently to give fall enough\r\nfor the deepest drainage. The writer recently had occasion to note this\r\nfact on his own land.\r\n\r\nA low wet spot had many times been looked at, as a place which should be\r\ndrained, both to improve its soil, and the appearance of the land about\r\nit; but to the eye, it seemed doubtful whether it was not about as low\r\nas the stream some forty rods off, into which it must be drained. Upon\r\ntesting the matter carefully with levelling instruments, it was found\r\nthat from the lowest spot in this little swamp, there was a fall of\r\nseven and a half feet to the river, at its ordinary height! Again, there\r\nare cases where it will be found upon accurate surveys, that the fall is\r\nvery slight, so that great care will be requisite, to lay the drains in\r\nsuch a way that the descent may be continuous and uniform.\r\n\r\nWithout competent skill in laying out the work, land-owners will be\r\nliable not only to errors in the fall of the drains, but to very\r\nexpensive mistakes in the location of them. A very few rods of drains,\r\nmore than are necessary, would cost more than any charge of a competent\r\nperson for laying them out properly.\r\n\r\nAgain, experience gives great facility in judging of the underground\r\nflow of water, of the permeability of soil, of the probability of\r\nfinding ledges or other rock formation, and many other particulars which\r\nmight not suggest themselves to a novice in the business.\r\n\r\nThe laying out of drains is important, not only with reference to the\r\nwork in hand, but to additional work to be executed in future on\r\nadjoining land, so that the whole may be eventually brought into one\r\ncheap and efficient system with the smallest effective number of drains,\r\nboth minors and mains, and the fewest outlets possible; with such wells,\r\nor other facilities for inspection, as may be necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the English tables of the cost of drainage by the Drainage Companies,\r\nan estimate of $1.25 per acre is usually put down for \"superintendence,\"\r\nwhich includes the engineering and the supervision of the whole process\r\nof opening, laying and filling, securing outfalls, and every other\r\nprocess till the work is completed. The general estimate of the cost of\r\ndrainage is about $25.00 per acre, and this item of $1.25 is but a small\r\nper centage on that amount. The point has been dwelt upon here, more for\r\nthe purpose of impressing upon land-owners, the importance of employing\r\ncompetent skill in the laying out of their drainage works, than because\r\nthe expense thus incurred, forms any considerable item of the cost of\r\nthe whole work.\r\n\r\n2. _Excavation and Filling._ The principal expense of drainage is\r\nincurred in the excavation of the ditch, whether it be for tiles or for\r\nstones. The labor of excavation depends much upon the nature of the soil\r\nto be moved.\r\n\r\n     \"Draining on a sound clay,\" says the writer of a prize essay,\r\n     \"free from stones, may be executed at a cheaper rate per rod, in\r\n     length, than on almost any other kind of soil, as, from the\r\n     firmness of the clay, the work may be done with narrow spades, and\r\n     but a small quantity of soil requires to be removed. The draining\r\n     of wet sands or grounds, or clays in which veins of sand abound, is\r\n     more expensive than on sound clays, because a broader spade has to\r\n     be used, and consequently a larger amount of soil removed; and\r\n     draining stony or rocky soils is still more expensive, because the\r\n     pick has to be used. This adds considerably to the expense.\"\r\n\r\nGreat stress is laid, by all experienced persons, upon using narrow\r\nspades, and opening ditches as narrow as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat more convenient for unskillful laborers to work in a wide\r\nditch than in a narrow one, and although the laborers frequently protest\r\nthat they cannot work so rapidly in narrow ditches, yet it is found\r\nthat, in contract work, by the rod, they usually open the ditches very\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it will be found that, generally, the cost of excavation bears a\r\npretty constant proportion to the number of cubic feet of earth thrown\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt will surprise those unaccustomed to these estimates, to observe how\r\nrapidly the quantity excavated, increases with the increased width of\r\nthe ditch.\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader accurately to compute the measurement of drains of\r\nany dimensions likely to be adopted, a table and explanations, found in\r\nthe Report of the Board of Health, already quoted, are given below. The\r\ndimensions, or contents of any drain, are found by multiplying together\r\nthe length, depth, and _mean_ width of the drain.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus, if a drain is 300 yards long, and the cutting 3 feet deep,\r\n     20 inches wide at the top, and 4 inches wide at the bottom, the\r\n     mean width would be 12 inches (or the half of the sum of 20 and 4),\r\n     and if we multiply 300, the length, by 1, the depth in yards, and\r\n     by 1/3, the mean width in yards, and the product would be 100 cubic\r\n     yards. The following table will serve to facilitate such\r\n     calculations.\r\n\r\n     _Table showing the number of Cubic Yards of Earth in each Rod (5-1/2\r\n     Yards in length), in Drains or Ditches of various Dimensions._\r\n\r\n     =================================================\r\n     DEPTH. |            MEAN WIDTH.\r\n     -------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n     Inches.|7 In. |8 In. |9 In. |10 In.|11 In.|12 In.\r\n     -------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n       30   |0.89  |1.02  |1.146 |1.27  |1.40  |1.53\r\n       33   |0.98  |1.12  |1.26  |1.40  |1.54  |1.68\r\n       36   |1.07  |1.22  |1.375 |1.53  |1.68  |1.83\r\n       39   |1.16  |1.324 |1.49  |1.655 |1.82  |1.986\r\n       42   |1.25  |1.426 |1.604 |1.78  |1.96  |2.14\r\n       45   |1.34  |1.53  |1.72  |1.91  |2.10  |2.29\r\n       48   |1.426 |1.63  |1.833 |2.04  |2.24  |2.444\r\n       51   |1.515 |1.73  |1.95  |2.164 |2.38  |2.60\r\n       54   |1.604 |1.83  |2.06  |2.29  |2.52  |2.75\r\n       57   |1.69  |1.935 |2.18  |2.42  |2.66  |2.90\r\n       60   |1.78  |2.036 |2.29  |2.546 |2.80  |3.056\r\n     =================================================\r\n\r\n     =================================================\r\n     DEPTH. |              MEAN WIDTH.\r\n     -------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n     Inches.|13 In.|14 In.|15 In.|16 In.|17 In.|18 In.\r\n     -------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n       30   |1.655 |1.78  |1.91  |2.04  |2.164 |2.29\r\n       33   |1.82  |1.96  |2.10  |2.24  |2.38  |2.52\r\n       36   |1.986 |2.14  |2.29  |2.244 |2.60  |2.75\r\n       39   |2.15  |2.32  |2.48  |2.65  |2.81  |2.98\r\n       42   |2.32  |2.495 |2.674 |2.85  |3.03  |3.21\r\n       45   |2.48  |2.67  |2.865 |3.055 |3.246 |3.438\r\n       48   |2.65  |2.85  |3.056 |3.26  |3.46  |3.667\r\n       51   |2.81  |3.03  |3.25  |3.46  |3.68  |3.896\r\n       54   |2.98  |3.20  |3.44  |3.666 |3.895 |4.125\r\n       57   |3.14  |3.38  |3.63  |3.87  |4.11  |4.354\r\n       60   |3.31  |3.564 |3.82  |4.074 |4.33  |4.584\r\n     =================================================\r\n\r\n     \"Along the top of the table is placed the mean widths in inches,\r\n     and on the left-hand side the depths of the drains, extending from\r\n     30 inches to 5 feet. The numbers in the body of the table express\r\n     cubic yards, and decimals of a yard. In making use of the table, it\r\n     is necessary first to find the mean width of the drain, from the\r\n     widths at the top and bottom. Thus, if a drain 3 feet deep were 16\r\n     inches wide at the top, and 4 inches at the bottom, the mean width\r\n     would be half of 16 added to 4, or 10; then, by looking in the\r\n     table for the column under 10 (width), and opposite 36 (inches of\r\n     depth), we find the number of cubic yards in each rod of such a\r\n     drain to be 1.53, or somewhat more than one and a half. If we\r\n     compare this with another drain 20 inches wide at the top, 4 inches\r\n     at the bottom, and 4-1/2 feet deep, we have the mean width 12, and\r\n     looking at the table under 12 and opposite 54, we find 2.75 cubic\r\n     yards, or two and three-quarters to the rod. In this case, the\r\n     quantity of earth to be removed is nearly twice as much as in the\r\n     other, and hence, as far as regards the digging, the cost of the\r\n     labor will be nearly double. But in the case of deep drains, the\r\n     cost increases slightly for another reason, namely, the increased\r\n     labor of lifting the earth to the surface from a greater depth.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the title of the \"Depth of Drains,\" other reasons are suggested\r\nwhy shallow drains are more easily wrought than deeper drains. The\r\nwidths given in English treatises, and found perfectly practicable\r\nthere, with proper drainage-tools, will seem to us exceedingly narrow.\r\nMr. Parkes gives the width of the top of a four-foot drain 18 inches,\r\nof a three-and-a-half foot drain 16 inches, and of a three-foot drain 12\r\ninches. He gives the width of drains for tiles, three inches at bottom,\r\nand those for stones, eight inches. Of the cost of excavating a given\r\nnumber of cubic yards of earth from drains, it is difficult to give\r\nreliable estimates. In the writer's own field, where a pick was used to\r\nloosen the lower two feet of earth, the labor of opening and filling\r\ndrains 4 feet deep, and of the mean width of 14 inches, all by hand\r\nlabor, has been, in a mile of drains, being our first experiments, about\r\none day's labor to three rods in length. The excavated earth of such a\r\ndrain, measures not quite three cubic yards. (Exactly, 2.85.)\r\n\r\nIn work subsequently executed, we have opened our drains of 4 foot\r\ndepth, but 20 inches at top, and 4 inches at bottom, giving a mean width\r\nof 12 inches. In one instance, in the Summer of 1858, two men opened 14\r\nrods of such drain in one day. In six days, the same two men opened,\r\nlaid, and filled 947 feet, or about 57-1/2 rods of such drain. Their\r\nlabor was worth $12.00, or 21 cents per rod. The actual cost of this job\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n    847 two-inch tiles, at $13 per 1,000      $11.01\r\n    100 three-inch      \"      \"  for main      2.50\r\n    70 bushels of tan, to protect the joints     .70\r\n    Horse to haul tiles and tan                  .50\r\n    Labor, 12 days, at $1                      12.00\r\n                                             -------\r\n              Total                           $26.71\r\n\r\nThis is 46-1/2 cents per rod, besides our own time and skill in laying out\r\nand superintending the work. The work was principally done with Irish\r\nspades, and was in a sandy soil. In the same season, the same men\r\nopened, laid, and filled 70 rods of four-foot drain, of the same mean\r\nwidth of 12 inches, in the worst kind of clay soil, where the pick was\r\nconstantly used. It cost 35 days' labor to complete the job, being 50\r\ncents per rod for the labor alone. The least cost of the labor of\r\ndraining 4 feet deep, on our own land, is thus shown to be 21 cents per\r\nrod, and the greatest cost 50 cents per rod, all the labor being by\r\nhand. One-half these amounts would have completed the drains at 3 feet\r\ndepth, as has been already shown.\r\n\r\nBut the excavation here is much greater than is usual in England, Mr.\r\nParkes giving the mean width of a four-foot drain but 10-1/2 inches,\r\ninstead of 14 or 12, as just given. Mr. Denton gives estimates of the\r\ncost, in England, of cutting and filling four-foot drains, which vary\r\nfrom 12 cents per rod upwards, according to the prices of labor, and\r\nother circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn New England, where labor may be fairly rated at one dollar per day,\r\nthe cost of excavating and filling four-foot drains by hand labor, must\r\nvary from 20 to 50 cents per rod, according to the soil, and half those\r\namounts for drains of three-foot depth.\r\n\r\nOf the aid which may be derived from the use of draining plows, or of\r\nthe common plow, or subsoil plow, our views may be found expressed under\r\nthe appropriate heads. That drains will long continue to be opened in\r\nthis vast country by hand labor, is not to be supposed, but we give our\r\nestimates of the expenses, at this first stage of our education in\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n3. _Cost of the Tiles._ Under the title of \"The Cost of Tiles,\" we have\r\ngiven such information as can be at present procured, touching that\r\nmatter. It will be assumed, in these estimates, that no tiles of less\r\nthan 1-1/2 inch bore will be used for any purpose, and for mains, usually\r\nthose of three-inch bore are sufficient. The proportion of length of\r\nmains to that of minors is small, and, considering the probable\r\nreduction of prices, we will, for the present, assume $10 per 1,000 as\r\nthe prices of such mixed sizes as may be used.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, the freight of them to a reasonable distance, and we have\r\nthe cost of the tiles on the field. The weight of two-inch tiles is\r\nusually rated at about 3 lbs. each, though they fall short of this\r\nweight until wet.\r\n\r\n4. _Outlets._ A small per-centage should be added to the items already\r\nnoticed, for the cost of the general outfall, which should be secured\r\nwith great care; although, from such examination as the writer has made\r\nin this country, and in England also, in the large majority of cases,\r\ndrains are discharged with very little precaution to protect the\r\noutlets. Works completed under the charge of regular engineers, form an\r\nexception to this remark; and an item of 37 cents per acre, for iron\r\noutlets and masonry, is usually included in the estimated cost per acre\r\nof drainage.\r\n\r\n5. _Collars._ It is not known to the author that collars have been at\r\nall used in America, except at the New York Central Park, in 1858; round\r\npipes, upon which they are commonly used abroad, when used on any, not\r\nbeing yet much in use here.\r\n\r\nIn the estimates of Mr. Denton, in his tables, collars are set down at\r\nabout half the cost of the mixed tiles. The bore of them being large\r\nenough to receive the end of the tile, increases the price in proportion\r\nto the increase in size. It is believed, however, that a smaller size of\r\ntiles may prudently be used with collars than without, because the\r\ncollars keep the tiles perfectly in line, and freely admit water, while\r\nthey exclude roots, sand, and other obstructions. A drain laid with one\r\nand a half inch tiles with collars is, no doubt, better in any soil than\r\ntwo-inch tiles without collars. Some compensation for the cost of\r\ncollars may thus be found in the less price of the smaller tiles.\r\n\r\n6. _Laying._ The cost of laying tiles is so trifling as hardly to be\r\nworth estimating, except to show its insignificance. The estimate, by\r\nEnglish engineers, is two cents per rod for \"pipe laying and finishing.\"\r\nWhat is included in \"finishing,\" does not appear. From the personal\r\nobservations of the writer, it is believed that an active man may lay\r\nfrom 60 to 100 rods of tiles per day, in ditches well prepared. Indeed,\r\nwe have seen our man James, lay twelve rods of two-inch tiles, in a\r\nfour-foot ditch, in forty-five minutes, when he was not aware that he\r\nwas working against time. This is at the rate of sixteen rods an hour,\r\nwhich would give just 160 rods, or a half-mile, in a day of ten hours.\r\n\r\n7. _Number of Tiles to the Acre._ The number of tiles used depends, of\r\ncourse, upon the distances apart of the drains, and upon the length of\r\nthe tiles used.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the number of tiles of various length, per\r\nacre, required at different intervals:\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n  Intervals between |Twelve inch|Thirteen inch|Fourteen inch|Fifteen inch\r\n  the Drains,       |   Pipe.   |    Pipe.    |    Pipe.    |   Pipe.\r\n  in feet.          |           |             |             |\r\n  ------------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n          15        |   2904    |    2680     |     2489    |    2323\r\n          18        |   2420    |    2234     |     2074    |    1936\r\n          21        |   2074    |    1915     |     1778    |    1659\r\n          24        |   1815    |    1676     |     1555    |    1452\r\n          27        |   1613    |    1489     |     1383    |    1290\r\n          30        |   1452    |    1340     |     1244    |    1161\r\n          33        |   1320    |    1219     |     1131    |    1056\r\n          36        |   1210    |    1117     |     1037    |     968\r\n          39        |   1117    |    1031     |      957    |     893\r\n          42        |   1037    |     958     |      888    |     829\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the number of rods per acre of drains at\r\ndifferent distances:\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n    Intervals between the Drains, in feet.  |      Rods per acre.\r\n  ------------------------------------------+--------------------------\r\n                       15                   |           176\r\n                       18                   |           146-2/3\r\n                       21                   |           125-5/7\r\n                       24                   |           110\r\n                       27                   |            97-7/9\r\n                       30                   |            88\r\n                       33                   |            80\r\n                       36                   |            73-1/3\r\n                       39                   |            67-9/13\r\n                       42                   |            62-6/7\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked here, that tiles, moulded of the same length, vary\r\nnearly two inches when burned, according to the severity of the heat. It\r\nmay be suggested, too, that the length of the tile, in the use of any\r\nmachine, is entirely at the option of the maker. It is not, perhaps, an\r\ninsult to our common humanity, to suggest to buyers the propriety of\r\nmeasuring the length as well as calibre of tiles before purchasing. In\r\nthe estimates which will be made in this detail, it will be assumed that\r\ntiles will lay one foot each, with allowance for imperfections and\r\nbreakage. This is as near as possible to accuracy, according to our best\r\nobservation; and, besides, there is convenience in this simple estimate\r\nof one tile to one foot, which is important in practice.\r\n\r\nWe have now the data from which we may make some tolerably safe\r\nestimates of the cost of drainage. With labor at one dollar per day, and\r\ntiles at $10 per 1,000, or one cent each, or one cent a foot, and\r\nditches four feet deep, opened and filled at one-third of a day's labor\r\nto the rod, we may set down the principal items of the cost of drainage\r\nby the rod, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Cutting and filling per rod      33-1/3 cts.\r\n    Tiles                            16-2/3  \"\r\n                                     ----\r\n                                     50\r\n\r\nThis is putting the tiles at one cent a foot, and the labor at two cents\r\na foot, or just twice as much as the cost of tiles, and it brings a\r\ntotal of half a dollar a rod, all of them numbers easily remembered, and\r\nconvenient for calculation.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the table giving the number of rods to the acre, the\r\ncost of labor and tiles per acre may be at once found, by taking half\r\nthe number of rods in dollars. At 42 feet distance, the cost will be\r\n$31.42 per acre; at 30 feet distance, $44; and at 60 feet, half that\r\namount, or $22 per acre.\r\n\r\nOur views as to the frequency of drains, may be found under the\r\nappropriate head.\r\n\r\nOur estimate thus far, is of four-foot drains. We have shown, under the\r\nhead of the \"Depth of Drains,\" that the cost of cutting and filling a\r\nfour-foot drain is double that of cutting and filling a three-foot\r\ndrain. There is no doubt, that, after all the good advice we have given\r\non this subject, many, who \"grow wiser than their teachers are,\" will\r\nset aside the teachings of the best draining engineers in the world, and\r\ninsist that three feet deep is enough, and persist in so laying their\r\ntiles.\r\n\r\nThis _shallowness_ will reduce the cost of labor about one half, so that\r\nwe shall have the cost of labor and tiles equal--one cent a foot, making\r\n33? cents per rod, or one-third of a dollar, instead of one-half a\r\ndollar per rod. To the cost of labor and tiles, we should add a fair\r\nestimate of the cost of the other items of engineering and outlets.\r\nThese are trifling matters, which English tables, as has been shown,\r\nestimate together, at about $1.67 per acre.\r\n\r\nBriefly to recapitulate the elements of computation of the cost of\r\ndrainage, we find them to be these: the price of labor, the price of\r\ntiles, and freight of them; the character of the soil, the depth of the\r\ndrains, and their distance apart, with the incidental expense of\r\nengineering and of outfalls, and the large additional cost of _collars_,\r\nwhere they are deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE COST OF TILE AND STONE DRAINS.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to answer, with precision, the question so often\r\nasked, as to the comparative cost of drainage with tiles and stones.\r\n\r\nThe estimates given of the cost of tile drains, are based upon the\r\nwriter's own experience, upon his own farm mainly; and the mean width\r\nof four-foot tile drains, may be assumed to be 14 inches, instead of\r\n10-1/2 inches, as actually practiced in England.\r\n\r\nFor a stone drain of almost any form, certainly for any regular\r\nwater-course laid with stones, our ditch must be at least 21 inches wide\r\nfrom top to bottom. This is just 50 per cent, more than our own\r\nestimate, and 100 per cent., or double the English estimate for tile\r\ndrains.\r\n\r\nIt will require at least two ox-cart loads of stones to the rod, to\r\nconstruct any sort of a stone drain, costing, perhaps, 25 cents a load\r\nfor picking up and hauling. In most cases, where the stones are not on\r\nthe farm, it will cost twice that sum. We will say 25 cents per rod for\r\nlaying the stones, though this is a low estimate. We have, then, for\r\ncutting and filling the ditch, 50 cents per rod, 50 cents for hauling\r\nstone, and for laying, 25 cents per rod, making $1.25 a rod for a stone\r\ndrain, against 50 cents per rod for tile drains.\r\n\r\nThen we have a large surplus of earth, two cartloads to the rod,\r\ndisplaced by the two loads of stone, to be disposed of; and in case of\r\nthe tiles, we have just earth enough. There are many other\r\nconsiderations in favor of tiles: such as the cutting up of the ground\r\nby teaming heavy loads of stones; the greater permanency of tiles; and\r\nthe fact that they furnish no harbor for mice and other vermin, as the\r\nEnglish call such small beasts. In favor of stones, is the fact, that\r\noften they are on the land, and must be moved, and it is convenient to\r\ndispose of them in the ditches.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are many parts of the country where tiles are not to be\r\nprocured, without great cost of freight, and where labor is abundant at\r\ncertain seasons, and money scarce at all seasons, so that the question\r\nis really between stone drains and no drains.\r\n\r\nStone drains, if laid very deep, are far more secure than when shallow;\r\nbecause, if shallow, they are usually ruined by the breaking in of water\r\nat the top, in the Spring time, by the action of frost, and by the\r\nmining of mice and moles. If laid four feet deep, and the earth rammed\r\nhard above the stones, and rounded on the surface to throw off surface\r\nwater, they may be found efficient and permanent.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, however, is, that where it can be procured, at any\r\nreasonable cost, drainage with tiles will generally cost less than\r\none-half the expense of drainage with stones, and be incomparably more\r\nsatisfactory in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDRAINING IMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\n     Unreasonable Expectations about Draining Tools.--Levelling\r\n     Instruments; Guessing not Accurate.--Level by a Square.--Spirit\r\n     Level.--Span, or A Level.--Grading by\r\n     Lines.--Boning-rod.--Challoner's Drain Level.--Spades and\r\n     Shovels.--Long-handled Shovel.--Irish Spade, Description and\r\n     Cut.--Bottoming Tools.--Narrow Spades.--English Bottoming\r\n     Tools.--Pipe-layer.--Pipe-laying Illustrated.--Pick-axes.--Drain\r\n     Gauge.--Drain Plows, and Ditch-Diggers.--Fowler's Drain\r\n     Plow.--Pratt's Ditch-Digger.--McEwan's Drain Plow.--Routt's Drain\r\n     Plow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a characteristic of Americans, to be dissatisfied with\r\nevery recent improvement in art or science, and the greater the step in\r\nadvance of former times, the more captious and critical do we become.\r\nThere is many a good lady, who cannot tolerate a sewing-machine,\r\nalthough she knows it will do the work of ten seamstresses, because it\r\nwill not sew on buttons and work buttonholes! Most of us are very much\r\nout of temper with the magnetic telegraph, just now, because it does not\r\nbring us the Court news from England every morning before breakfast,\r\nthough we have hourly dispatches from Washington, New Orleans, and St.\r\nLouis; and, returning to our _moutons_, everybody is finding fault with\r\nus just now, because we cannot tell them of some universal,\r\nall-penetrating, cheap, strong, simple, enduring little implement, by\r\nmeans of which any kind of a laborer, Scotch, Irish, or Yankee, may\r\nconveniently open all kinds of drains in all kinds of land, whether\r\nsand, hard-pan, gravel, or clay.\r\n\r\nHaving personally inquired and examined, touching draining tools in\r\nEngland, and having been solicited by an extensive agricultural\r\nimplement house in Boston, to furnish them a list and description of a\r\ncomplete set of draining tools, and feeling the obligation which seemed\r\nto be imposed on us, to know all about this matter, we wrote to Mr.\r\nDenton, one of the first draining engineers in the world, to send us a\r\nlist, with drawings and descriptions of such implements as he finds most\r\nuseful, or, if more convenient the implements themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton kindly replied to our inquiry, and his answer may be taken as\r\nthe best evidence upon this point. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"As to tools, it is the same with them as it is with the art of\r\n     draining itself--too much rule and too much drawing upon paper; all\r\n     very right to begin with, but very prejudicial to progress. I\r\n     employ, as engineer to the General Land Drainage Company, and on my\r\n     private account, during the drainage season, as many as 2,000 men,\r\n     and it is an actual fact, that not one of them uses the set of\r\n     tools figured in print. I have frequently purchased a number of\r\n     sets of the Birmingham tools, and sent them down on extensive\r\n     works. The laborers would purchase a few of the smaller tools, such\r\n     as Nos. 290, 291, and 301, figured in Morton's excellent Cyclopædia\r\n     of Agriculture, and would try them, and then order others of the\r\n     country blacksmith, differing in several respects; less weighty and\r\n     much less costly, and, moreover, much better as working tools. All\r\n     I require of the cutters, is, that the bottom of the drain should\r\n     be evenly cut, to fit the size of the pipe. The rest of the work\r\n     takes care of itself; for a good workman will economize his labor\r\n     for his own sake, by moving as little earth as practicable; thus,\r\n     for instance, a first-class cutter, in clays, will get down four\r\n     feet with a twelve-inch opening, _ordinarily_; if he wishes to\r\n     _show off_, he will sacrifice his own comfort to appearance, and\r\n     will do it with a ten-inch opening.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus \"freed our mind\" by way of preliminary, we propose to take\r\nup our subject, and pursue it as practically and quietly as possible to\r\nthe end. It may be well, perhaps, first to suggest by way of explanation\r\nof Mr. Denton's letter, above quoted, that drains are usually opened in\r\nEngland by the yard, or rod, the laborer finding his own tools.\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated, the implements convenient for draining, depend on\r\nmany circumstances. They depend upon the character of the earth to be\r\nmoved. A sharp, light spade, which may work rapidly and well in a light\r\nloam or sand, may be entirely unfit to drive into a stiff clay; and the\r\nfancy bottoming tools which may cut out a soft clay or sand in\r\nnicely-measured slices, will be found quite too delicate for a hard-pan\r\nor gravel, where the pick-axe alone can open a passage.\r\n\r\nThe implements again must be suited to the workman who handles it. Henry\r\nWard Beecher, in speaking of creeds, which he, on another occasion, had\r\nsaid were \"the skins of religion set up and stuffed,\" remarked, that it\r\nwas of more importance that a man should know how to make a practical\r\nuse of his faith, than that he should subscribe to many articles; for,\r\nsaid he, \"I have seen many a man who could do more at carpenter's work\r\nwith one old jack-knife, than another could do with a whole chest of\r\ntools!\"\r\n\r\nWhat can an Irishman do with a chopping ax, and what cannot a Yankee do\r\nwith it? Who ever saw a Scotchman or an Irishman who could not cut a\r\nstraight ditch with a spade, and who ever saw a Yankee who could or\r\nwould cut a ditch straight with any tool? One man works best with a\r\nlong-handled spade, another prefers a short handle; one drives it into\r\nthe earth with his right foot, another with his left. A laboring man, in\r\ngeneral, works most easily with such tools as he is accustomed to\r\nhandle; while theorizing implement-makers, working out their pattern by\r\nthe light of reason, may produce such a tool as a man _ought_ to work\r\nwith, without adapting it at all to the capacity or taste of the\r\nlaborer. A man should be measured for his tools, as much as for his\r\ngarment, and not be expected to fit himself to another's notions more\r\nthan to another's coat.\r\n\r\nIf the land-owner proposes to act as his own engineer, the first\r\ninstrument he will want to use is a SPIRIT LEVEL, or some other\r\ncontrivance by which he may ascertain the variations of the surface of\r\nhis field. The natural way for a Yankee to get at the grades is to\r\n_guess_ at them, and this, practically, is what is usually done. Ditches\r\nare opened where there appears to be a descent, and if there is water\r\nrunning, the rise is estimated by its current; and if there is no water\r\nrising in the drain, a bucketfull is occasionally poured in to guide the\r\nlaborer in his work. No one who has not tested the accuracy, or, rather,\r\ninaccuracy, of his judgment, as to the levels of fields, can at all\r\nappreciate the deceitfulness of appearances on this point. The human eye\r\nwill see straight; but it will not see level without a guide. It forms\r\nconclusions by comparison; and the lines of upland, of forest tops and\r\nof distant hills, all conspire to confuse the judgment, so that it is\r\nquite common for a brook to appear to the eye to run up hill, even when\r\nit has a quick current. A few trials with a spirit-level will cure any\r\nman of his conceit on this subject.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is as to the regular inclination of the bottom of drains. It\r\nis desirable not only to have an inclination all the way, but a regular\r\ninclination, as nearly as possible, especially if the descent be small.\r\nWorkmen are very apt to work at a uniform depth from the surface, and so\r\ngive the bottom of the drain the same variations as the surface line;\r\nand thus at one point there may be a fall of one inch in a rod; at\r\nanother, twice that fall; and at another, a dead level, or even a\r\nhollow. On our own farm, we have found, in twelve rods, a variation of a\r\nfoot in the bottom line of a drain opened by skillful workmen on a\r\nnearly level field, where they had no water to guide them, and where\r\nthey had supposed their fall was regular throughout.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch shows the difference between lines of tiles laid\r\nwith and without instruments. Next to guessing at the fall in our field,\r\nmay be placed a little contrivance, of which we have made use\r\nsufficiently to become satisfied of its want of practical accuracy. It\r\nis thus figured and described in the excellent treatise of Thomas, on\r\nFarm Implements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\n     \"_A_ is a common square, placed in a slit in the top of the stake\r\n     _B_. By means of a plumb-line the square is brought to a level,\r\n     when a thumbscrew, at _C_, fixes it fast. If the square is two feet\r\n     long, and is so carefully adjusted as not to vary more than the\r\n     twentieth of an inch from a true level, which is easily\r\n     accomplished, then a twentieth of an inch in two feet will be one\r\n     inch in forty feet--a sufficient degree of accuracy for many\r\n     cases.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--SQUARE AND PLUMB-LEVEL.]\r\n\r\nWe do not so much object to the principle of the above level, as to its\r\npractical working. We find it difficult, without cross sights, to take\r\nan accurate level with any instrument. However, those who are used to\r\nrifle-shooting may hit tolerably near the mark with the square. Mr.\r\nThomas only claims that it is accurate enough \"for many cases.\"\r\n\r\nA proper spirit-level, such as is used by engineers of railroads and\r\ncanals, attached to a telescope, is the best of all instruments. \"So\r\ngreat is the perfection of this instrument,\" says the writer just\r\nquoted, \"that separate lines of levels have been run with it, for sixty\r\nmiles, without varying two-thirds of an inch for the whole distance.\" A\r\ncheap and convenient spirit-level, for our purpose, is thus constructed.\r\n\r\n     It is furnished with eye sights, _a b_, and, when in use, is placed\r\n     into a framing of brass which operates as a spring to adjust it to\r\n     the level position, _d_, by the action of the large-headed brass\r\n     screw, _c_. A stud is affixed to the framing, and pushed firmly\r\n     into a gimlet-hole in the top of the short rod, which is pushed or\r\n     driven into the ground at the spot from whence the level is desired\r\n     to be ascertained. It need scarcely be mentioned, that the height\r\n     of the eye sight, from the guard, is to be deducted from the height\r\n     of observation, which quantity is easily obtained by having the rod\r\n     marked off in inches and feet; but it may be mentioned, that this\r\n     instrument should be used in all cases of draining on level ground,\r\n     even when one is confident that he knows the fall of the ground;\r\n     for the eye is a very deceitful monitor for informing you of the\r\n     levelness of ground. It is so light as to admit of being carried in\r\n     the pocket, whilst its rod may be used as a staff or cane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--SPIRIT LEVEL.]\r\n\r\nA staff of ten feet in length, graduated in feet and inches, and held by\r\nan attendant at the various points of observation, is necessary in the\r\nuse of the spirit-level in the field. A painted target, arranged with a\r\nslide to be moved up and down on this staff, and held by a thumbscrew,\r\nwill be found useful.\r\n\r\nWe have made for our own use a level like the above, and find it\r\nsufficiently accurate for drainage purposes. Small spirit-levels set in\r\niron can be had at the hardware shops for twenty cents each, and can be\r\nreadily attached to wood by a screw, in constructing our implement; or a\r\nspirit-level set in mahogany, of suitable size, may be procured for a\r\nhalf dollar, and any person, handy with tools, can do the rest. The\r\nsights should be arranged both ways, with a slit cut with a chisel\r\nthrough the brass or tin, and an oblong opening at each end. The eye is\r\nplaced at the slit, and sight is taken by a hair or fine thread, drawn\r\nacross the opening at the other end. Then, by changing ends, and\r\nsighting through the other end at a given object, any error in the\r\ninstrument may be detected. The hair or thread may be held in place by a\r\nlittle wax, and moved up or down till it is carefully adjusted. The\r\ninstrument should turn upon the staff in all directions, so that the\r\nlevel of a whole field, so far as it is within range, may be taken from\r\none position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.\r\n\r\nSTAFF AND TARGET.]\r\n\r\nTo maintain a uniform grade in the bottom of a drain so as to economize\r\nthe fall, and distribute it equally through the whole length, several\r\ndifferent instruments and means may be adopted. The first which we will\r\nfigure, is what is called the Span, or A Level. Such a level may be\r\neasily constructed of common inch-board. If it be desired to note the\r\nfall in feet, the span may conveniently be ten feet. If a notation in\r\nrods be preferred, the span should be a rod, or half rod long.\r\n\r\nThe two feet being placed on a floor, and ascertained to be perfectly\r\nlevel by a spirit-level, the plumb-line will hang in the centre, where a\r\ndistinct mark should be made on the cross-bar. Then place a block of\r\nwood, exactly an inch thick, under one leg, and mark the place where the\r\nline crosses the bar. Put another block an inch thick under the same\r\nleg, and again mark where the line crosses the bar, and so on as far as\r\nis thought necessary. Then put the blocks under the other leg in the\r\nsame manner, and mark the cross-bar. If the span be ten feet, the\r\nplumb-line will indicate upon the bar, by the mark which it crosses, the\r\nrise or fall in inches, in ten feet. If the span be a rod, the line will\r\nindicate the number of inches per rod of the rise or fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--SPAN, OR A LEVEL.]\r\n\r\nThis instrument is used thus: The fall of the ditch from end to end\r\nbeing ascertained by the spirit-level, and the length also, the fall per\r\nrod, or per one hundred feet, may be computed. The span is then placed\r\nin the bottom of the drain, from time to time, to guide the workman, or\r\nfor accurate inspection of the finished cut. We have constructed and\r\nused this level, and found it very convenient to test the accuracy of\r\nthe workmen, who had opened drains in our absence. A ten-foot span will\r\nbe found as large as can be conveniently carried about the farm.\r\n\r\nFor the accurate grading of the bottom of drains, as the work proceeds,\r\nwe have in practice found nothing so convenient and accurate as the\r\narrangement which we are about to illustrate.\r\n\r\nThe object is simply to draw a line parallel with the proposed bottom of\r\nthe drain, for the laborers to work under, so that they, as they\r\nproceed, may measure down from it, as a guide to depth. Having with the\r\nspirit-level, ascertained the fall from end to end of the drain, a short\r\nstake is set at each end, and a line is drawn from one to the other at\r\nthe requisite height, and supported by the cross-pieces, at suitable\r\ndistances, to prevent the sagging of the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--GRADING TRENCHES BY LINES.]\r\n\r\nSuppose the drain to be ten rods long, and that it is intended to cut it\r\nfour feet deep, the natural fall being, from end to end, sufficient. We\r\ndrive a stake at each end of the drain, high enough to attach to it a\r\nline three feet above the surface, which will be seven feet above the\r\nbottom of the finished drain--high enough to be above the heads of the\r\ncutters, when standing near the bottom.\r\n\r\nBefore drawing the line, the drain may be nearly completed. Then drive\r\nthe intermediate stakes, with the projecting arms, which we will call\r\nsquares, on one side of the drain, carefully sighting from one end of\r\nthe stake to the other, at the point fixed for the line, and driving the\r\nsquares till they are exactly even. Then attach a strong small cord, not\r\nlarger than a chalk line, to one of the stakes, and draw it as tight as\r\nit will bear, and secure it at the other stake. The line is now\r\ndirectly over the middle of the drain, seven feet from the bottom. Give\r\nthe cutters, then, a rod seven feet long, and let them cut just deep\r\nenough for the rod to stand on the bottom and touch the line.\r\nPractically, this has been found by the author, the most accurate and\r\nsatisfactory method of bringing drains to a regular grade.\r\n\r\nInstead of a line, after the end stakes have been placed, a _boning\r\nrod_, as it is called, may be used thus: A staff is used, with a\r\ncross-piece at the top, and long enough, when resting on the proper\r\nbottom of the drain, to reach to the level of the marks on the stakes,\r\nthree feet above the surface. Cross-pieces nailed to the stakes are the\r\nmost conspicuous marks. A person stands at one stake sighting along to\r\nthe other; a second person then holds the rod upright in the ditch, just\r\ntouching the bottom, and carries it thus along. If, while it is moved\r\nalong, its top is always in a line with the cross-bars on the end\r\nstakes, the fall is uniform; if it rise above, the bottom of the drain\r\nmust be lowered; if it fall below, the bottom of the drain must be\r\nraised. This may be convenient enough for mere inspection of works, but\r\nit requires two persons besides the cutters, to finish the drain by this\r\nmode; whereas, with the lines and squares, any laborer can complete the\r\nwork with exactness.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of levelling, by means of a mammoth mason's level, with an\r\nimprovement, was invented by Colonel Challoner, and published in the\r\nJournal of the Royal Agricultural Society. It may appear to some persons\r\nmore simple than the span level. We give the cut and explanation.\r\n\r\n     \"I first ascertain what amount of fall I can obtain, from the head\r\n     of every drain to my outfall. Suppose the length of the drain to be\r\n     96 yards, and I find I have a fall of two feet, that gives me a\r\n     fall of a quarter of an inch in every yard. I take a common\r\n     bricklayer's level 12 feet long, to the bottom of which I attach,\r\n     with screws, a piece of wood the whole length, _one inch wider_ at\r\n     one end than at the other, thereby throwing the level one inch out\r\n     of the true horizontal line. When the drain has got to its proper\r\n     depth at the outfall, I apply the broadest end of the level to the\r\n     mouth; and when the plumb-bob indicates the level to be correct,\r\n     the one-inch fall has been gained in the four yards, and so on. I\r\n     keep testing the drain as it is dug, quite up to the head, when an\r\n     unbroken, even, and continuous fall of two feet in the whole 96\r\n     yards has been obtained.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--CHALLONER'S LEVEL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPADES AND SHOVELS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61, 62, 63.--DRAIN SPADES.]\r\n\r\nNo peculiar tool is essential in opening that part of the drain which is\r\nmore than a foot in width. Shovels and spades, of the forms usually\r\nfound upon well-furnished farms, and adapted to its soil, will be found\r\nsufficient. A Boston agricultural house, a year or two since, sent out\r\nan order to London for a complete set of draining tools. In due season,\r\nthey received, in compliance with their order, three spades of different\r\nwidth, like those represented in the cut.\r\n\r\nThese are understood to be the tools in common use in England and\r\nScotland, for sod-draining, and for any other drains, indeed, except\r\ntiles. The widest is 12 inches wide, and is used to remove the first\r\nspit, of about one foot depth. The second is 12 inches wide at top, and\r\n8 at the point, and the third, eight at top, and four at the point. The\r\nnarrowest spade is usually made with a spur in front, or what the Irish\r\ncall a _treader_, on which to place the foot in driving it into the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. SPADE WITH SPUR.]\r\n\r\nFor wedge drains, these spades are made narrower than those above\r\nrepresented, the finishing spade being but two and a half inches wide at\r\nthe point. It will be recollected that this kind of drainage is only\r\nadapted to clay land. The shovels and spades which have been heretofore\r\nin most common use in New England are made with short handles, thus--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 65, 66.--COMMON SHOVEL AND SPADE.]\r\n\r\nThey are of cast-steel, and combine great strength and lightness.\r\nLong-handled shovels and spades are much preferred, usually, by Irish\r\nlaborers, whose fancy is worth consulting in matters with which they\r\nhave so much to do. We believe their notion is correct, that the\r\nlong-handled tool is the easier to work with, at almost any job.\r\n\r\nIn our own draining, we find the common spade, with long or short\r\nhandle, to be best in marking out the lines in turf; and either the\r\nspade or common shovel, according to the nature of the soil, most\r\nconvenient in removing the first foot of earth.\r\n\r\nAfter this, if the pick is used, a long-handled round-pointed shovel,\r\nnow in common use on our farms, is found convenient, until the ditch is\r\ntoo narrow for its use. Then the same shovel, turned up at the sides so\r\nas to form a narrow scoop, will be found better than any tool we yet\r\nhave to remove this loosened earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 67, 68.--LONG-HANDLED ROUND SHOVEL. SCOOP SHOVEL.]\r\n\r\nOf all the tools that we have ever seen in the hands of an Irishman, in\r\nditching, nothing approximates to the true Irish spade. It is a very\r\nclumsy, ungainly-looking implement used in the old country both for\r\nditching, and for ridging for potatoes, being varied somewhat in width,\r\naccording to the intended use. For stony soil, it is made narrower and\r\nstronger, while for the bog it is broader and lighter. The Irish\r\nblacksmiths in this country usually know how to make them, and we have\r\ngot up a pattern of them, which are manufactured by Laighton and Lufkin,\r\nedge-tool makers, of Auburn, N. H., which have been tested, and found to\r\nsuit the ideas of the Irish workmen.\r\n\r\nThis is a correct portrait of an Irish spade of our own pattern, which\r\nhas done more in opening two miles of drains on our own farm, than any\r\nother implement.\r\n\r\nThe spade of the Laighton and Lufkin pattern weighs 5 lbs., without the\r\nhandle, and is eighteen inches long. It is of iron, except about eight\r\ninches of the blade, which is of cast steel, tempered and polished like\r\na chopping axe. It is considerably curved, and the workmen suit their\r\nown taste as to the degree of curvature, by putting the tool under a\r\nlog or rock, and bending it to suit themselves. It is a powerful, strong\r\nimplement, and will cut off a root of an inch or two diameter as readily\r\nas an axe. The handle is of tough ash, and held in place by a wedge\r\ndriven at the side of it, and can be knocked out readily when the spade\r\nneeds new steel, or any repair. The length of the handle is three feet\r\neight inches, and the diameter about one and one-fourth inches. The\r\nwedge projects, and forms a \"treader,\" broad and firm, on which the foot\r\ncomes down, to drive the spade into the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--IRISH SPADE.]\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored to have the market supplied with the Irish spades,\r\nbecause, in the hands of such Irishmen as have used them \"at home,\" we\r\nfind them a most effective tool. We are met with all sorts of reasonable\r\ntheoretical objections on the part of implement sellers, and of farmers,\r\nwho never saw an Irish spade in use. \"Would not the tool be better if it\r\nwere wider and lighter,\" asks one. \"I think it would be better if the\r\nspur, or \"treader,\" were movable and of iron, so as to be put on the\r\nother side or in front,\" suggests another. \"It seems as if it would work\r\nbetter, if it were straight,\" adds a third. \"Would it not hold the dirt\r\nbetter if it were a little hollowing on the front,\" queries a fourth.\r\n\"No doubt,\" we reply, \"there might be a very good implement made, wider\r\nand lighter, without a wooden treader, and turned up at the sides, to\r\nhold the earth better, but it would not be an Irish spade when finished.\r\nYour theories may be all correct and demonstrable by the purest\r\nmathematics, but the question is, with what tool will Patrick do the\r\nmost work? If he recognizes the Irish spade as an institution of his\r\ncountry, as a part of 'home,' you might as well attempt to reason him\r\nout of his faith in the Pope, as convince him that his spade is not\r\nperfect.\" Our man, James, believes in the infallibility of both. There\r\nis no digging on the farm that his spade is not adapted to. To mark out\r\na drain in the turf by a line, he mounts his spade with one foot, and\r\nhops backward on the other, with a celerity surprising to behold. Then\r\nhe cuts the sod in squares, and, with a sleight of hand, which does not\r\ncome by nature, as Dogberry says reading and writing come, throws out\r\nthe first spit. When he comes on to the gravel or hard clay, where\r\nanother man would use a pick-axe, his heavy boot comes down upon the\r\ntreader, and drives the spade a foot or more deep; and if a root is\r\nencountered, a blow or two easily severs it. The last foot at the bottom\r\nof the four-foot drain, is cut out for the sole-tile only four and a\r\nhalf inches wide, and the sides of the ditch are kept trimmed, even and\r\nstraight, with the sharp steel edge. And it is pleasant to hear James\r\nexpress his satisfaction with his national implement. \"And, sure, we\r\ncould do nothing at this job, sir, without the Irish spade!\" \"And, sure,\r\nI should like to see a man that will spade this hard clay with anything\r\nelse, sir!\" On the whole, though the Irish spade does wonders on our\r\nfarm, we recommend it only for Irishmen, who know how to handle it. In\r\nour own hands, it is as awkward a thing as we ever took hold of, and we\r\nnever saw any man but an Irishman, who could use it gracefully and\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n_Bottoming Tools._--The only tools which are wanted of peculiar form in\r\ndraining, are such as are used in forming the narrow part of the\r\ntrenches at the bottom. We can get down two feet, or even three, with\r\nthe common spade and pick-axe, and in most kinds of drainage, except\r\nwith tiles, it is necessary to have the bottom as wide, at least, as a\r\nspade. In tile-draining, the narrower the trench the better, and in\r\nlaying cylindrical pipes without collars, the bottom of the drain should\r\nexactly fit the pipes, to hold them in line.\r\n\r\nAlthough round pipes are generally used in England, we have known none\r\nused in America until the past season--the sole-pipe taking their place.\r\nAs the sole-pipe has a flat bottom, a different tool is required to\r\nfinish its resting-place, from that adapted to the round pipe. As we\r\nhave not, however, arrived quite at the bottom, we will return to the\r\ntools for removing the last foot of earth.\r\n\r\nAnd first, we give from Morton, the Birmingham spades referred to by Mr.\r\nDenton, in his letter, quoted in this chapter. They are the\r\ntheoretically perfect tools for removing the last eighteen or twenty\r\ninches of soil in a four or five-foot drain. Mr. Gisborne says of the\r\ndrain properly formed:\r\n\r\n     \"It is wrought in the shape of a wedge, brought in the bottom to\r\n     the narrowest limit which will admit the collar, by tools admirably\r\n     adapted to that purpose. The foot of the operator is never within\r\n     twenty inches of the floor of the drain; his tools are made of\r\n     iron, plated on steel, and never lose their sharpness, even when\r\n     worn to the stumps; because, as the softer material, the iron,\r\n     wears away, the sharp steel edge is always prominent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Fig. 71. Fig. 72. BIRMINGHAM SPADES.]\r\n\r\nThis poetical view of digging drains, meets us at every turn, and we are\r\nbeset with inquiries for these wonderful implements. We do not intimate\r\nthat Mr. Gisborne, and those who so often quote the above language, are\r\nnot reliable. Mr. Gisborne \"is an honorable man, so are they all\r\nhonorable men;\" but we must reform our tiles, and our land too, most of\r\nit, we fear, before we can open four-foot trenches, and lay pipes in\r\nthem, without putting a foot \"within twenty inches of the floor of the\r\ndrain.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have great doubt whether pipes can be laid close\r\nenough to make the joints secure without collars, unless carefully laid\r\nby hand, or unless they are round pipes, rolled in the making, when half\r\ndried, and so made straight and even at the ends. In laying such\r\nsole-pipes as we have laid, it requires some care to adjust them, so as\r\nto make the joints close. Most of them are warped in drying or burning,\r\nso that spaces of half an inch will often be left at the top or side,\r\nwhere two are laid end to end. Now, if the foot never goes to the bottom\r\nof the drain, the pipes must be laid with a hook or pipe-layer, such as\r\nwill be presently described, which may do well for pipes and collars,\r\nbecause the collar covers the joint, so that it is of no importance if\r\nit be somewhat open.\r\n\r\nAgain, we know of no method of working with a pick-axe, except by\r\nstanding as low as the bottom of the work. No man can pick twenty\r\ninches, or indeed any inches, lower than he stands, because he must move\r\nforward in this work, and not backward. Each land-owner may judge for\r\nhimself, whether his land requires the pick in its excavation.\r\n\r\nIn soft clays, no doubt, with suitable tools, the trench may be cut a\r\nfoot, or more, lower than the feet of the workman. We have seen it done\r\nin our land, in a sandy soil, with the Irish spade, though, as we used\r\nsole-pipes, our \"pipe-layer\" was a live Irishman, who walked in the\r\ntrench backwards, putting down the pipes with his hand.\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied, that the instances in which trenches may be opened a\r\nfoot or two below the feet of the workmen, are the exceptions, and not\r\nthe rule, and that in laying sole-tiles, the hand of a careful workman\r\nmust adjust each tile in its position.\r\n\r\nWe have found a narrow spade, four inches wide, with a long handle, a\r\nconvenient tool for finishing drains for sole-tiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Fig. 74. NARROW SPADES FOR TILES.]\r\n\r\nWe have thoroughly tested the matter; and in all kinds of soil, give a\r\ndecided preference to spades as broad at the point as at the heel. We\r\nhave used common long-handled spades, cut down with shears at a\r\nmachine-shop, into these shapes.\r\n\r\nThe spade of equal width, works much more easily in the bottom of a\r\ntrench, because its corners do not catch, as do those of the other. The\r\npointed spade is apparently nearer the shape of the sloping ditch, but\r\nsuch tools cannot be used vertically, and when the heel of the pointed\r\nspade is lowered, it catches in the side of the trench, before the point\r\nreaches the bottom.\r\n\r\nVery strong spades, of various width, from three to eight inches, and\r\nthick at the heel, to operate as a wedge, will be found most suitable\r\nfor common use. The narrowest spades should have the spur, as shown in\r\nFig. 64, because there is not room for the foot by the side of the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nThe various tools for finishing the bottoms of drains, as figured in\r\nMorton, are the following:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Fig. 76. Fig. 77. Fig. 78. Fig. 79.\r\n\r\nENGLISH BOTTOMING TOOLS.]\r\n\r\nThe last implement, which is a scoop for the bottom of trenches for\r\nround pipes, is one of the tools mentioned in Mr. Denton's letter, as\r\nnot being found to the taste of his workmen. For scooping out our\r\nflat-bottomed trenches, we use a tool like Fig. 77. For boggy land, soft\r\nclay, or, indeed, any land where water is running at the time of the\r\nexcavation, scoops like the following will be found convenient for flat\r\nbottoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Fig. 81. Fig. 82.\r\n\r\nDRAWING AND PUSHING SCOOP, AND PIPE-LAYER.]\r\n\r\nThe pushing scoop (Fig. 81), as it is called, may be made of a common\r\nlong-handled shovel, turned up at the sides by a blacksmith, leaving it\r\nof the desired width.\r\n\r\nThe _pipe-layer_, of which mention has so often been made, is a little\r\nimplement invented by Mr. Parkes, for placing round pipes and collars in\r\nnarrow trenches, without stepping into them.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch, by our friend Mr. Shedd, shows the pipe-layer in\r\nuse. The cross section of the land, shown in front, represents it as\r\nhaving had the advantage of draining, by which the water-table is\r\nbrought to a level with the bottom of the drain, as shown by the heavy\r\nshading. An \"Irish spade\" and a pipe-layer are shown lying on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--PIPE-LAYING.]\r\n\r\nThe _pick-axes_ commonly used in excavation of trenches, are in the\r\nfollowing forms:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84, 85.--PICK-AXES.]\r\n\r\nPick-axes may be light or heavy, according to the nature of the soil. A\r\nchisel at one end, and point at the other, is found best in most cases.\r\n\r\nA _Drain-gauge_ is usually mentioned in a list of draining tools. It is\r\nused when ditches are designed for stone or other material than tiles,\r\nand where the width is important. In tile-draining the width is entirely\r\nimmaterial. If opened by the rod, it is only important that they be of\r\nproper depth and inclination, with the bottom wide enough for the tile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--DRAIN-GAUGE.]\r\n\r\nThe above figure shows the usual form of the drain-gauge. Below, we give\r\nfrom Morton, drawings, and a description of Elkington's augers for\r\nboring in the bottoms of ditches.\r\n\r\n     \"The cut annexed represents the auger employed by Elkington, where\r\n     _a b_ and _c_ are different forms of the tool; _d_, a portion of\r\n     the shaft: _e_, with the wedges, _h h_, the cross handle; and _f_\r\n     and _g_ additional pieces for grasping the shaft, and so enabling\r\n     more than one person to work at it.\" The auger-hole ought to be a\r\n     little at one side of the drain, as in Fig. 3, at page 35, so that\r\n     the water may not rise at right angles to the flow of water in it,\r\n     and obstruct its current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--ELKINGTON'S DRAINING AUGER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     _a._ The plug, or point under ground, to which the string of pipes is\r\n          attached.\r\n     _bb._ The coulter from the point up through the beam, regulated by\r\n          wheel and screw midway.\r\n     _c._ The beam connecting the two pairs of wheels.\r\n     _e._ Drain opened by hand where pipes enter the ground.\r\n     _a to e._ Pipes under ground.\r\n     _e to f._ Pipes above ground.\r\n     _g._ Windlass or capstan, worked by horses.\r\n     _h._ Wire rope attached to plow, and wound round the windlass.\r\n     _i._ Pulley round which the rope runs to keep the plow in the line of\r\n          the ditch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINING-PLOWS AND DITCH-DIGGERS.\r\n\r\nThe man who can invent and construct a machine that shall be capable of\r\ncutting four-foot ditches for pipe-drains, with facility, will deserve\r\nwell of his country.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential that the drain be cut to its full depth at one\r\noperation. If worked by oxen or horses, it may go several times over the\r\nwork, taking out a few inches at each time. If moved by a capstan, or\r\nother slowly-operating power, it must work more thoroughly, so as not to\r\nconsume too much time.\r\n\r\nWith a lever, such as is used in Willis's Stump Puller, sufficient power\r\nfor any purpose may be applied. An implement like a subsoil plow,\r\nconstructed to run four feet deep, and merely doing the work of the\r\npick, would be of great assistance. Prof. Mapes says he has made use of\r\nsuch an implement with great advantage. For tile-drains, the narrower\r\nthe ditch the better, if it be only wide enough to receive the tiles. A\r\nmere slit, four inches wide, if straight and of even inclination at the\r\nbottom, would be the best kind of ditch, the pipes being laid in with a\r\npipe-layer. But if the ditch is to be finished by the machine, it is\r\nessential that it be so contrived that it will grade the bottom, and not\r\nleave it undulating like the surface. Fowler's Drain Plow is said to be\r\nso arranged, by improvements since its first trials, as to attain this\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly suggested some of the points to be kept in mind by\r\ninventors, we will proceed to give some account of such machines as come\r\nnearest to the wants of the community. Fowler's Draining-Plow would meet\r\nthe largest wants of the public, were it cheap enough, and really\r\nreliable to perform what it is said to perform. The author saw this\r\nimplement in England, but not in operation, and it seems impossible,\r\nfrom inspection of it, as well as from the theory of its operation,\r\nthat it can succeed, if at all, in any but soft homogeneous clay. The\r\nidea is, however, so bold, and so much is claimed for the implement,\r\nthat some description of it seems indispensable in a work like this.\r\n\r\nThe pipes, of common drain tiles, are strung on a rope, and this rope,\r\nwith the pipes, is drawn through the ground, following a plug like the\r\nfoot of a subsoil plow, leaving the pipes perfectly laid, and the drain\r\ncompleted at a single operation. (See Fig. 88.)\r\n\r\nThe work is commenced by opening a short piece of ditch by hand, and\r\nstrings of pipes, each about 50 feet long, are added as the work\r\nproceeds; and when the ditch is completed, the rope is withdrawn. When\r\nthe surface is uneven, the uniform slope is preserved by means of a\r\nwheel and screw, which governs the plug, or coulter, raising or lowering\r\nit at pleasure. A man upon the frame-work controls this wheel, guided by\r\na sight on the frame, and a cross-staff at the end of the field.\r\n\r\nDrains, 40 rods long, are finished at one operation. This plow has been\r\ncarefully tested in England. Its work has been uncovered when completed,\r\nand found perfect in every respect. The great expense of the machine,\r\nand the fact that it is only adapted to clay land free from\r\nobstructions, has prevented its general use. We cannot help believing\r\nthat, by the aid of steam, on our prairies, at least, some such machine\r\nmay be found practicable and economical.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRATT'S DITCH DIGGER,\r\n\r\nPatented by Pratt & Bro., of Canandaigua, is attracting much attention.\r\nWe have not seen it in operation, nor have we seen statements which\r\nsatisfy us that it is just what is demanded. It is stated, in the\r\n_Country Gentleman_, to be incapable of cutting a ditch more than two\r\nand a half feet deep. A machine that will do so much is not to be\r\ndespised; but more than one half the digging remains of a four-foot\r\nditch, after two and a half feet are opened, and we want an implement to\r\ndo the lowest and worst half. It is stated that, in one instance, a\r\nditch, 60 rods long, about two feet deep, in hard clay, was cut with\r\nthis machine, worked by two horses, in five hours.\r\n\r\nWe trust that the enterprising inventors will perfect their implement,\r\nso that it will open drains four feet deep, and thus meet the great want\r\nof the public. It is not to be expected that any such implement can be\r\nmade to operate in ground full of stones and roots; and inventors should\r\nnot be discouraged by the continual croakings of those sinister birds,\r\nwhich see nothing but obstacles, and prophecy only failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--PRATT'S DITCH DIGGER.]\r\n\r\nThe drain plow was first introduced into Scotland by M'Ewan. The soil in\r\nhis district was mostly a strong unctuous clay, free from stones. He\r\nconstructed an immense plow, worked by 12 or 16 horses, by means of\r\nwhich a furrow-slice, 16 inches in depth, was turned out; and, by a\r\nmodification of the plow, a second slice was removed, to the depth, in\r\nall, of two feet. This plow is expensive and heavy, and incapable of\r\nworking to sufficient depth.\r\n\r\nMr. Paul, of Norfolk Co., England, has lately invented an ingenious\r\nmachine for cutting drains, of which we give an elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--PAUL'S DITCHING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nIt is worked by a chain and capstan, by horses, and, of course, may be\r\noperated by steam or lever power. It is drawn forward, and, as it moves,\r\nit acts as a slotting machine on the land, the tools on the\r\ncircumference of the acting-wheel taking successive bites of the soil,\r\neach lifting a portion from the full depth to which it is desired that\r\nthe trench should be cut, and laying the earth thus removed on the\r\nsurface at either side. There is a lifting apparatus at the end of the\r\nmachine, by which the cutting-wheel may be raised or lowered, according\r\nto the unevenness of the surface, in order to secure a uniform fall in\r\nthe bottom of the drain. The whole process is carried on at the rate of\r\nabout four feet per minute, and it results, on suitable soils, in\r\ncutting a drain from three to five feet deep, leaving it in a finished\r\nstate, with a level bottom for the tiles to rest upon. We give the cut\r\nand statement from the Cyclopædia of Agriculture, and if the machine\r\nshall prove what it is represented to be, we see but little more to be\r\ndesired in a ditching machine. The principle of this implement appears\r\nto us to be the correct one, and we see no reason to doubt the\r\nstatement of its performance.\r\n\r\nRoutt's drain plow is designed for surface-draining merely. We give,\r\nfrom the _New England Farmer_, a statement of its merits, as detailed by\r\na correspondent who saw it at the exhibition of the U. S. Agricultural\r\nSociety at Richmond, in 1858:\r\n\r\n\"One of the most attractive implements on the Fair ground, to the\r\nfarmer, was A. P. Routt's patent drain plow. This implement makes a\r\nfurrow a foot deep, two feet and a half wide at the top, and four inches\r\nwide at the bottom, the sides sloping at such an angle as to insure the\r\ndrain from falling in by the frost, the whole being perfectly completed\r\nat one operation by this plow, or tool. Those who have tried it say it\r\nis the very thing for surface-draining, which, on wet lands, is\r\ncertainly very beneficial where under-draining has not been done. The\r\nmanufacturer resides in Somerset, Orange County, Va. The plow is so made\r\nthat it opens a deep furrow, turning both to the right and left, and is\r\nfollowed by a heavy iron roller that hardens the earth, both on the\r\nsides and the bottom of the surface-drain, thus doing very handsome\r\nwork. The price, as heretofore stated, is $25, and with it, a man can,\r\nwith a good pair of team horses, surface-drain 60 acres of land a day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING DRAINS AND LAYING TILES.\r\n\r\n     Begin at the Outlet.--Use of Plows.--Levelling the Bottom.--Where\r\n     to begin to lay Pipes.--Mode of Procedure.--Covering\r\n     Pipes.--Securing Joints.--Filling.--Securing Outlets.--Plans.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former chapters, we have spoken minutely of the arrangement, depth,\r\ndistance, and width of drains; and in treating of tools for drainage, we\r\nhave sufficiently described the use of levelling instruments and of the\r\nvarious digging tools.\r\n\r\nWe assume here, that the engineering has been already done, and that the\r\nwhole system has been carefully staked out, so that every main,\r\nsub-main, and minor is distinctly located, and the fall accurately\r\nascertained. Until so much has been accomplished, we are unprepared to\r\nput the first spade into the ground.\r\n\r\nWe propose to give our own experience as to the convenient method of\r\nprocedure, with such suggestions as occur to us, for those who are\r\ndifferently situated from ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe work of excavation must begin at the outlet, so that whatever water\r\nis met with, may pass readily away; and the outlet must be kept always\r\nlow enough for this purpose. If there is considerable fall, it may not\r\nbe best to deepen the lower end of the main to its full extent, at\r\nfirst, because the main, though first opened, must be the last in which\r\nthe pipes are laid, and may cave in, if unnecessarily deep at first. In\r\nmany cases there is fall enough, so that the upper minors may be laid\r\nand find sufficient fall, before the lower end of the main is half\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nWith a garden line drawn straight, mark out the drain, with a sharp\r\nspade, on both sides, and remove the turf. If it is desired to use the\r\nturf for covering the pipes, or to replace it over the drains, when\r\nfinished, it should at first be placed in heaps outside the line of the\r\nearth to be thrown out.\r\n\r\nA plow is used sometimes to turn out the sod and soil; but we have few\r\nplowmen who can go straight enough; and in plowing, the soil is left too\r\nnear to the ditch for convenience, and the turf is torn in pieces and\r\nburied, so as not to be fit for use. Usually, it will be found\r\nconvenient to remove the turf, if there be any, with a spade, by a line.\r\nThen, a plow may be used for turning out the next spit, and the drain\r\nmay be kept straight, which is indispensable to good work. A good\r\nditching-machine is, of course, the thing needful; but we are\r\nendeavoring in these directions to do our best without it. We have\r\nopened our own trenches entirely by hand labor, finding laborers more\r\nconvenient than oxen or horses, and no more expensive.\r\n\r\nMany have used the plow in the first foot or two of the cutting, but it\r\nis not here \"the first step which costs,\" but the later steps. After the\r\nfirst foot is removed, if the ground be hard, a pick or subsoil plow\r\nmust be used. A subsoil plow, properly constructed, may be made very\r\nuseful in breaking up the subsoil, though there is a difficulty in\r\nworking cattle astride of a deep ditch, encumbered with banks of earth.\r\nA friend of ours used, in opening drains, a large bull in single\r\nharness, trained to walk in the ditch; but the width of a big bull is a\r\nsomewhat larger pattern for a drain, than will be found economical.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of farmers in the use of a pair of heavy wheels, with a\r\nchain attached to the axle, so that the cattle may both walk on one side\r\nof the ditch, or by the use of long double-trees, so that horses may go\r\noutside the banks of earth, will generally be found sufficient to make\r\nthe most of their means.\r\n\r\nIt will be found convenient to place the soil at one side, and the\r\nsubsoil at the other, for convenience in returning both right side up to\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\nHaving worked down to the depth of two feet or more, the ditch should be\r\ntoo narrow for the use of common spades, and the narrow tools already\r\ndescribed will be found useful. The Irish spade, on our own fields, is\r\nin use from the first to the last of the excavation; and at three feet\r\ndepth, we have our trench but about six inches in width, and at the\r\nbottom, at four feet depth, it is but four inches--just wide enough for\r\nthe laborer to stand in it, with one foot before the other.\r\n\r\nHaving excavated to nearly our depth, we use the lines, as described in\r\nanother place, for levelling, and the men working under them, grade the\r\nbottom as accurately as possible. If flat-bottomed tiles are used, the\r\nditch is ready for them. If round pipes are used, a round bottoming tool\r\nmust be used to form a semi-circular groove in which the pipes are to\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nWe have not forgotten that English drainers tell us of tools and their\r\nuse, whereby drains may be open twenty inches lower than the feet of the\r\nworkman; but we have never chanced to see that operation, and are\r\nskeptical as to the fact that work can thus be performed economically,\r\nexcept in very peculiar soils. That such a _crack_ may be thus opened,\r\nis not doubted; but we conceive of no means by which earth, that\r\nrequires the pick, can be moved to advantage, without the workman\r\nstanding as low as his work.\r\n\r\nHaving opened the main, and finished, as we have described, the minor\r\nwhich enters the main at its highest point, we are ready to lay the\r\ntiles.\r\n\r\nBy first laying the upper drain, it will be seen that we may finish and\r\nsecure our work to the junction of the first minor with its main.\r\n\r\nConvey the pipes by wagon or otherwise, as is convenient, to the side of\r\nthe ditch where the soil lies, and where there is least earth, and lay\r\nthem close to the edge of the ditch, end to end the whole way,\r\ndiscarding all imperfect pieces. If it is designed to use gravel, turf,\r\nor other covering for the pipes, lay it also in heaps along the trench.\r\nThen place the first pipe at the upper end of the ditch, with a brick or\r\nstone against its upper end, to exclude earth. We have heretofore used\r\nsole-tiles, with flat bottoms, and have found that a thin chip of wood,\r\nnot an eighth of an inch thick, and four by two inches in size, such as\r\nmay be found at shoe shops in New England, assists very much in securing\r\nan even bearing for the tiles. It is placed so that the ends of two\r\ntiles rest on it, and serves to keep them in line till secured by the\r\nearth. A man walking backward in the ditch, takes the tiles from the\r\nbank, carefully adjusting them in line and so as to make good joints,\r\nand he can lay half a mile or more in a day, if the bottom is well\r\ngraded. Another should follow on the bank, throwing in a shovel full of\r\ngravel or tan, if either is used, upon the joint.\r\n\r\nIf turf is to be used to secure the joint, pieces should be cut thin and\r\nnarrow, and laid along the bank, and the man in the ditch must secure\r\neach joint as he proceeds. It will be found to cost twice the labor, at\r\nleast, to use turf, as it is to use gravel or tan, if they are at hand.\r\n\r\nIf the soil be clay, we do not believe it is best to return it directly\r\nupon the tiles, because it is liable to puddle and stop the joint, and\r\nthen to crack and admit silt at the joint, while gravel is not thus\r\naffected. We prefer to place the top soil of clay land, next the pipes,\r\nrather than the clay in the condition in which it is usually found.\r\n\r\nAs to small stones above the pipes, we should decidedly object to them.\r\nThey are unnecessary to the operation of the drain, and they allow the\r\nwater to come in, in currents, on to the top of the pipes, in heavy\r\nstorms or showers, and so endanger their security. The practice of\r\nplacing stones above the tiles is abandoned by all scientific drainers.\r\n\r\nWe have, in England, seen straw placed over the joints of pipes, but it\r\nseems an inconvenient and insecure practice. Long straw cannot be well\r\nplaced in such narrow openings, and it is likely to sustain the earth\r\nenough, so that when thrown in, it will not settle equally around the\r\npipes; whereas a shovelfull of gravel or other earth sifted in\r\ncarefully, will at once fasten them in place.\r\n\r\nHaving laid and partially covered the first or upper drain, proceed with\r\nthe next in the same way, laying and securing the main or sub-main, at\r\nthe same time, to each intersection, thus carrying the work from the\r\nhighest point down towards the outlet. After sufficient earth has been\r\nthrown in to make the work safe against accidents by rain, or caving in\r\nof earth, the filling may be completed at leisure. Mr. Johnston, of\r\nGeneva, uses for this purpose a plow, having a double-tree nine and a\r\nhalf feet long, to enable a horse to go on each side of the ditch.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that a side-hill plow might well enough be used with horses\r\n_tandem_, or with oxen and cart wheels and draughts.\r\n\r\nThe filling, however, will be found a small matter, compared with the\r\ndigging. In laying pipes in narrow trenches, a tool called a pipe-layer\r\nis sometimes used, a cut of which, showing its mode of use, may be\r\nfound in another place.\r\n\r\nIn filling drains where the soil is partly clay, and partly sand or\r\ngravel, we recommend that the clay be placed in the upper part of the\r\ndrain, so as to prevent water from passing directly down upon the pipes,\r\nby which they are frequently displaced as soon as laid.\r\n\r\nIf the work is completed in Autumn, it is well to turn two or three\r\nfurrows from each side on to the drains, so as to raise the surface\r\nthere, and prevent water from cutting out the ditch, or standing above\r\nit. If the land is plowed in Autumn, it is best to back-furrow on to the\r\ndrains, leaving dead furrows half way between them, the first season.\r\n\r\nAs to the importance of securing the outlets, and the manner of doing\r\nit, we have spoken particularly elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd here, again, we will remind the beginner, of the necessity of making\r\nand preserving accurate plans of the work, so that every drain may be at\r\nany time found by measurement. After a single rotation, it is frequently\r\nutterly impossible to perceive upon the surface any indication of the\r\nline of the drains.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it may be well perhaps to remind the reader, that\r\nwhatever arrangements are made as to silt-basins, or peep-holes, must be\r\nincluded in the general plan, and executed as the work proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF DRAINAGE UPON THE CONDITION OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n     Drainage deepens the Soil, and gives the roots a larger\r\n     pasture.--Cobbett's Lucerne 30 feet deep.--Mechi's Parsnips 13 feet\r\n     long!--Drainage promotes Pulverization.--Prevents\r\n     Surface-Washing.--Lengthens the Season.--Prevents Freezing\r\n     out.--Dispenses with Open Ditches.--Saves 25 per cent. of\r\n     Labor.--Promotes absorption of Fertilizing Substances from the\r\n     Air.--Supplies Air to the Roots.--Drains run before Rain; so do\r\n     some Springs.--Drainage warms the Soil.--Corn sprouts at 55°; Rye\r\n     on Ice.--Cold from Evaporation.--Heat will not pass downward in\r\n     Water.--Count Rumford's Experiments with Hot Water on\r\n     Ice.--Aeration of Soil by Drains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benefits which high-lands, as we ordinarily call them, in\r\ndistinction from swamp or flowed lands, derive from drainage, may be\r\narranged in two classes, _mechanical_ and _chemical_; though it is not\r\neasy, nor, indeed, is it important, to maintain this distinction in all\r\npoints. Among those which partake rather of the nature of mechanical\r\nchanges, are the following:\r\n\r\n_Drainage deepens the soil._ Every one who has attempted to raise\r\ndeep-rooted vegetables upon half-drained swamp-land, has observed the\r\nutter impossibility of inducing them to extend downward their usual\r\nlength. Parsnips and carrots, on such land, frequently grow large at the\r\ntop, but divide into numerous small fibres just below the surface, and\r\nspread in all directions. No root, except those of aquatic plants, will\r\ngrow in stagnant water. If, therefore, it is of any advantage to have a\r\ndeep, rather than a shallow soil, it is manifestly necessary, from this\r\nconsideration alone, to lower the line of standing water, at least, to\r\nthe extent to which the roots of our cultivated crops descend. A deep\r\nsoil is better than a shallow one, because it furnishes a more extensive\r\nfeeding-ground for the roots. The elements of nutrition, which the plant\r\nfinds in the soil, are not all upon the surface. Many of them are washed\r\ndown by the rains into the subsoil, and some are found in the\r\ndecomposing rocks themselves. These, the plants, by a sort of instinct,\r\nsearch out and find, as well in the depths of the earth as at its\r\nsurface, if no obstacle opposes. By striking deep roots again, the\r\nplants stand more firmly in the earth, so that they are not so readily\r\ndrawn out, or shaken by the winds. Indeed, every one knows that a soil\r\ntwo feet deep is better than one a foot deep; and market-gardeners and\r\nnursery-men show, by their practice, that they know, if others do not,\r\nthat a trenched soil three feet deep is better than one of any less\r\ndepth. We all know that Indian corn, in a dry soil, sends down its\r\nrootlets two feet or more, as well as most of the grasses. Cobbett says:\r\n\"The lucerne will send its roots thirty feet into a dry bottom!\" The\r\nChinese yam, recently introduced, grows downward two or three feet. The\r\ndigging of an acre of such a crop, by the way, on New England soil\r\ngenerally, would require a corps of sappers and miners, especially when\r\nwe consider that the yam grows largest end downward. However, the yam\r\nmay prove a valuable acquisition to the country. Every inch of\r\nadditional soil gives 100 tons of active soil per acre.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Denton:\r\n\r\n     \"I have evidence now before me, that the roots of the wheat plant,\r\n     the mangold wurzel, the cabbage, and the white turnip, frequently\r\n     descend into the soil to the depth of three feet. I have myself\r\n     traced the roots of wheat nine feet deep. I have discovered the\r\n     roots of perennial grasses in drains four feet deep; and I may\r\n     refer to Mr. Mercer, of Newton, in Lancashire, who has traced the\r\n     roots of rye grass running for many feet along a small pipe-drain,\r\n     after descending four feet through the soil. Mr. Hetley, of Orton,\r\n     assures me that he discovered the roots of the mangolds, in a\r\n     recently made drain, five feet deep; and the late Sir John Conroy\r\n     had many newly-made drains, four feet deep, stopped by the roots of\r\n     the same plants.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sheriff Mechi's parsnips, however, distance anything in the way of\r\ndeep rooting that has yet been recorded. The Sheriff is a very deep\r\ndrainer, and an enthusiast in agriculture, and Nature seems to delight\r\nto humor his tastes, by performing a great many experiments at his\r\nfamous place called Tiptree Hall. He stated, at a public meeting, that,\r\nin his neighborhood, where a crop of parsnips was growing on the edge of\r\na clay pit, the roots were observed to descend 13 feet 6 inches; in\r\nfact, the whole depth to which this pit had once been filled up!\r\n\r\n_Drainage assists pulverization._ It was Tull's theory that, by the\r\ncomminution, or minute division, of soils alone, without the application\r\nof any manures, their fertility might be permanently maintained; and he\r\nso far supported this theory as, by repeated plowings, to produce twelve\r\nsuccessive crops of wheat on the same land, without manure. The theory\r\nhas received support from the known fact, that most soils are benefitted\r\nby Summer fallowing. The experiments instituted for the purpose of\r\nestablishing this theory, although they disproved it, showed the great\r\nvalue of thorough pulverization. It is manifest that a wet soil can\r\nnever be pulverized. Plowing clayey, or even loamy soil, when wet, tends\r\nrather to press it together, and render it less pervious to air and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of under-draining is to dry the surface-soil, to draw\r\nout all the water that will run out of it, so that, in early Spring, or\r\nin Autumn, it may be worked with the plow as advantageously as undrained\r\nlands in mid-Summer.\r\n\r\nStriking illustrations of the benefits of thorough pulverization will be\r\nfound in the excellent remarks of Dr. Madden, given in a subsequent\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Drainage prevents surface-washing._ All land which is not level, and is\r\nnot in grass, is liable to great loss by heavy rains in Spring and\r\nAutumn. If the land is already filled with water, or has not sufficient\r\ndrainage, the rain cannot pass directly downward, but runs away upon the\r\nsurface, carrying with it much of the soil, and washing out of what\r\nremains, of the valuable elements of fertility which have been applied\r\nwith such expense. If the land be properly drained, the water falling\r\nfrom the clouds is at once absorbed, and passes downwards, saturating\r\nthe soil in its descent, and carrying the soluble substances with it to\r\nthe roots, and the surplus water runs away in the artificial channels\r\nprovided by the draining process. So great is the absorbent power of\r\ndrained land, that, after a protracted drought, all the water of a heavy\r\nrainstorm will be drunk up and held by the soil, so that, for a day or\r\ntwo, none will find its way to the drains, nor will it run upon the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n_Drainage lengthens the season for labor and vegetation._ In the colder\r\nlatitudes of our country, where a long Winter is succeeded by a torrid\r\nSummer, with very little ceremony by way of an intervening Spring,\r\nfarmers have need of all their energy to get their seed seasonably into\r\nthe ground. Snow often covers the fields in New England into April; and\r\nthe ground is so saturated with water, that the land designed for corn\r\nand potatoes, frequently cannot be plowed till late in May. The manure\r\nis to be hauled from the cellar or yard, over land lifted and softened\r\nby frost, and all the processes of preparing and planting, are\r\nnecessarily hurried and imperfect. In the Annual Report of the Secretary\r\nof the Board of Agriculture, of the State of Maine, for 1856, a good\r\nillustration of this idea is given: \"Mr. B. F. Nourse, of Orrington,\r\nplowed and planted with corn a piece of his drained and subsoiled land,\r\nin a drizzling rain, after a storm of two days. The corn came up and\r\ngrew well; yet this was a clayey loam, formerly as wet as the adjoining\r\ngrass-field, upon which oxen and carts could not pass, on the day of\r\nthis planting, without cutting through the turf and miring deeply. The\r\nnearest neighbor said, if he had planted that day, it must have been\r\nfrom a raft.\" Probably two weeks would be gained in New England, in\r\nSpring, in which to prepare for planting, by thorough-drainage, a gain,\r\nwhich no one can appreciate but a New England man, who has been obliged\r\noften to plow his land when too wet, to cut it up and overwork his team,\r\nin hauling on his manure over soft ground, and finally to plant as late\r\nas the 6th of June, or leave his manure to waste, and lose the use of\r\nhis field till another season; and all because of a surplus of cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeomans, of New York, in a published statement of his experience in\r\ndraining, says, that on his drained lands, \"the ground becomes almost as\r\ndry in two or three days after the frost comes out in Spring, or after a\r\nheavy rain, as it would do in as many weeks, before draining.\" But the\r\ngain of time for labor is not all. We gain time also for vegetation, by\r\nthorough-drainage. Ten days, frequently, in New England, may be the\r\nsecurity of our corn-crop against frost. In less than that time, a whole\r\nfield passes from the milky stage, when a slight frost would ruin it, to\r\nthe glazed stage, when it is safe from cold; and twice ten days of warm\r\nseason are added by this removal of surplus water.\r\n\r\n_Drainage prevents freezing out._ Mr. John Johnston, of Seneca County,\r\nNew York, in 1851, had already made sixteen miles of tile drains. He had\r\nbeen experimenting with tiles from 1835, and had, on four acres of his\r\ndrained clayey land, raised the largest crop of Indian corn ever\r\nproduced in that county--eighty-three bushels of shelled corn to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nHe states, that on this clayey soil, when laid down to grass, \"not one\r\nsquare foot of the clover froze out.\" Again he says, \"Heretofore, many\r\nacres of wheat were lost on the upland by freezing out, and none would\r\ngrow on the lowlands. Now there is no loss from that cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe growing of Winter wheat has been entirely abandoned in some\r\nlocalities on account of freezing out, or Winter-killing; and one of the\r\nworst obstacles in the way of getting our lands into grass, and keeping\r\nthem so, is this very difficulty of freezing out. The operation seems to\r\nbe merely this: The soil is pulverized only to the depth of the plow,\r\nsome six or eight inches. Below this is a stratum of clay, nearly\r\nimpervious to water. The Autumn rains saturate the surface soil, which\r\nabsorbs water like a sponge. The ground is suddenly frozen; the water\r\ncontained in it crystallizes into ice; and the soil is thrown up into\r\nspicules, or honey-combs; and the poor clover roots, or wheat plants,\r\nare drawn from their beds, and, by a few repetitions of the process,\r\nleft dead on the field in Spring. Draining, followed by subsoiling, lets\r\ndown the falling water at once through the soil, leaving the root bed of\r\nthe plants so free from moisture, that the earth is not \"heaved,\" as the\r\nterm is, and the plants retain their natural position, and awaken\r\nrefreshed in the Spring by their Winter's repose.\r\n\r\n_There are no open ditches on under-drained land._ An open ditch in a\r\ntillage or mowing-field, is an abomination. It compels us, in plowing,\r\nto stop, perhaps midway in our field; to make short lands; to leave\r\nheadlands inconvenient to cultivate; and so to waste our time and\r\nstrength in turning the team, and treading up the ground, instead of\r\nprofitably employing it in drawing a long and handsome furrow the whole\r\nlength of the field, as we might do were there no ditch. Open ditches,\r\nas usually made, obstruct the movement of our teams as much as fences,\r\nand a farm cut into squares by ditches, is nearly as objectionable as a\r\nfarm fenced off into half or quarter-acre fields.\r\n\r\nIn haying, we have the same inconvenience. We must turn the\r\nmowing-machine and horse-rake at the ditch, and finish by hand-labor,\r\nthe work on its banks; we must construct bridges at frequent intervals,\r\nand then go out of our way to cross them with loads, cutting up the\r\nsmooth fields with wheels and the feet of animals. Or, what is a\r\nfamiliar scene, when a shower is coming up, and the load is ready,\r\nPatrick concludes to drive straight to the barn, across the ditch, and\r\ngets his team mired, upsets his load, and perhaps breaks the leg of an\r\nanimal, besides swearing more than half a mile of hard ditching will\r\nexpiate. Such accidents are a great temptation to profanity, and\r\nunder-draining might properly be reckoned a moral agent, to counteract\r\nsuch traps and pitfalls of the great adversary.\r\n\r\nA moment's thought will satisfy any farmer who has the means, that true\r\neconomy dictates a liberal expenditure of labor, at once, to obviate\r\nthese difficulties, rather than be subject for a lifetime to the\r\nconstant petty annoyances which have been named.\r\n\r\nOpen ditches, even when formed so skillfully that they may be\r\nconveniently crossed, or water-furrows which remain where land is laid\r\ninto ridges by back-furrowing, as much of our flat land must be, if not\r\nunder-drained, are serious obstructions, at the best.\r\n\r\nThey render the soil unequal in depth, taking it from one point where it\r\nis wanted, and heaping it upon another where it is not wanted, thus\r\ngiving the crops an uneven growth. They render the soil also unequal in\r\nrespect to moisture, because the back or top of the ridge must always be\r\ndrier than the furrow.\r\n\r\nThorough-drained land may be laid perfectly flat, giving us, thus, the\r\ncontrol of the whole field, to divide and cultivate according to\r\nconvenience, and making it of uniform texture and temperature.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made, to estimate the saving in the number of horses\r\nand men by drainage, and it is thought to be a reasonable calculation to\r\nfix it at one in four, or twenty-five per cent. It probably will strike\r\nany farmer as a fair estimate, that, on land which needs drainage, it\r\nwill require four horses and four men to perform the same amount of\r\ncultivation, that three men and three horses may perform on the same\r\nland well drained.\r\n\r\n_Drained land will not require re-planting._ There is hardly a farmer in\r\nNew England, who does not, each Spring, find himself compelled to\r\nre-plant some portion of his crop. He is obliged to hurry his seed into\r\nthe ground, at the earliest day, because our season for planting is\r\nshort at the best. If, after this, a long cold storm comes, on wet land,\r\nthe seed rots in the ground, and he must plant again, often too late,\r\nincurring thus the loss of the seed, the labor of twice doing the same\r\nwork, the interruption of his regular plan of business, and often the\r\npartial failure of his crop.\r\n\r\nUpon thorough-drained land, this cost and labor could rarely be\r\nexperienced, because nothing short of a small deluge could saturate well\r\ndrained land, so as to cause the seed to fail, if sowed or planted with\r\nordinary care and prudence, as to the season.\r\n\r\n_Drained land is lighter to work._ It is often difficult to find a day\r\nin the year, when a wet piece of land is in suitable condition to plow.\r\nUsually, such tracts are unequal, some parts being much wetter than\r\nothers, because the water settles into the low places. In such fields,\r\nwe now drive our team knee deep into soft mud, and find a stream of\r\nwater following us in the furrow, and now we rise upon a knoll, baked\r\nhard, and sun-cracked; and one half the surface when finished is shining\r\nwith the plastered mud, ready to dry into the consistency of bricks,\r\nwhile the other is already in hard dry lumps, like paving stones, and\r\nabout as easily pulverized.\r\n\r\nThis is hard work for the team and men, hard in the plowing, and hard\r\nthrough the whole rotation. The same field, well drained, is friable and\r\nporous, and uniform in texture. It may be well plowed and readily\r\npulverized, if taken in hand at any reasonable season.\r\n\r\nLand which has been puddled by the tread of cattle, or by wheels,\r\nacquires a peculiar consistency, and a singular capacity to hold water.\r\nCertain clays are wet and beaten up into this consistency, to form the\r\nbottoms of ponds, and to tighten dams and reservoirs. A soil thus\r\npuddled, requires careful treatment to again render it permeable to\r\nwater, and fit for cultivation. This puddling process is constantly\r\ngoing on, under the feet of cattle, under the plow and the cart-wheels,\r\nwherever land containing clay is worked upon in a wet state. Thus, by\r\nperforming a day's work on wet land, we often render necessary as much\r\nadditional labor as we perform, to cure the evil we have done.\r\n\r\n_We may haul loads without injury on drained land._ On many farms, it is\r\ndifficult to select a season for hauling out manure, or carting stones\r\nfrom place to place, when great injury is not done to some part of the\r\nland by the operation. Many farmers haul out their manure in Winter, to\r\navoid cutting up their farms; admitting that the manure is wasted\r\nsomewhat by the exposure, but, on the whole, choosing this loss as the\r\nlesser evil. In spreading manure in Spring, we are often obliged to\r\ncarry half loads, because the land is soft, not only to spare our\r\nbeasts, but also to spare our land the injury by treading it. Drained\r\nland is comparatively solid, especially in Spring, and will bear up\r\nheavy loads with little injury.\r\n\r\n_Drained land is least injured by cattle in feeding._ Whether it is good\r\nhusbandry to feed our mowing fields at any time, is a question upon\r\nwhich farmers have a right to differ. Without discussing the question,\r\nit is enough for our purpose, that most farmers feed their fields late\r\nin the Autumn. Whether we approve it, or not, when the pastures are bare\r\nand burnt up, and the second crop in the home-field is so rich and\r\ntempting, and the women are complaining that the cows give no milk, we\r\nusually bow to the necessity of the time, and \"turn in\" the cows. The\r\ngreat injury of \"Fall-feeding\" is not usually so much the loss of the\r\ngrass-covering from the field, as the poaching of the soil and\r\ndestruction of the roots by treading. A hard upland field is much less\r\ninjured by feeding, than a low meadow, and the latter less in a dry than\r\na wet season. By drainage, the surplus water is taken from the field.\r\nNone can stand upon its surface for a day after the rain ceases. The\r\nsoil is compact, and the hoofs of cattle make little impression upon it,\r\nand the second or third crop may be fed off, with comparatively little\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n_Weeds are easily destroyed on drained land._ If a weed be dug or pulled\r\nup from land that is wet and sticky, it is likely to strike root and\r\ngrow again, because earth adheres to its roots; whereas, a stroke of the\r\nhoe entirely separates the weeds in friable soil from the earth, and\r\nthey die at once. Every farmer knows the different effect of hoeing, or\r\nof cultivating with the horse-hoe or harrow, in a rain storm and in dry\r\nweather. In one case, the weeds are rather refreshed by the stirring,\r\nand, in the other, they are destroyed. The difference between the\r\nsurface of drained land and water-soaked land is much the same as that\r\nbetween land in dry weather under good cultivation, and land just\r\nsaturated by rain.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are many noxious weeds, such as wild grasses, which thrive\r\nonly on wet land, and which are difficult to exterminate, and which\r\ngive us no trouble after the land is lightened and sweetened by\r\ndrainage. Among the effects of drainage, mainly of a chemical nature, on\r\nthe soil, are the following:\r\n\r\n_Drainage promotes absorption of fertilizing substances from the air._\r\nThe atmosphere bears upon its bosom, not only the oxygen essential to\r\nthe vitality of plants, not only water in the form of vapor, to quench\r\ntheir thirst in Summer droughts, but also various substances, which rise\r\nin exhalations from the sea, from decomposing animals and vegetables,\r\nfrom the breathing of all living creatures, from combustion, and a\r\nthousand other causes. These would be sufficient to corrupt the very\r\nair, and render it unfit for respiration, did not Nature, with her\r\nwondrous laws of compensation, provide for its purification. It has\r\nalready been stated, how the atmosphere returns to the hills, in clouds\r\nand vapor, condensed at last to rain, all the water which the rivers\r\ncarry to the sea; and how the well-drained soil derives moisture, in\r\nseverest time of need, from its contact with the vapor-loaded air. But\r\nthe rain and dew return not their waters to the earth without treasures\r\nof fertility. Ammonia, which is one of the most valuable substances\r\nfound in farm-yard manures, and which is a constant result of\r\ndecomposition, is absorbed in almost incredible quantities by water.\r\nAbout 780 times its own bulk of ammonia is readily absorbed by water at\r\nthe common temperature and pressure of the atmosphere; and, freighted\r\nthus with treasures for the fields, the moisture of the atmosphere\r\ndescends upon the earth. The rain cleanses the air of its impurities,\r\nand conveys them to the plants. The vapors of the marshes, and of the\r\nexposed manure heaps of the thriftless farmer, are gently wafted to the\r\nwell-drained fields of his neighbor, and there, amidst the roots of the\r\nwell-tilled crops, deposit, at the same time, their moisture and\r\nfertilizing wealth.\r\n\r\nOf the wonderful power of the soil to absorb moisture, both from the\r\nheavens above and the earth beneath--by the deposition of dew, as well\r\nas by attraction--we shall treat more fully in another chapter. It will\r\nbe found to be intimately connected with the present topic.\r\n\r\n_Thorough drainage supplies air to the roots._ Plants, if they do not\r\nbreathe like animals, require for their life almost the same constant\r\nsupply of air. \"All plants,\" says Liebig, \"die in soils and water\r\ndestitute of oxygen; absence of air acts exactly in the same manner as\r\nan excess of carbonic acid. Stagnant water on a marshy soil excludes\r\nair, but a renewal of water has the same effect as a renewal of air,\r\nbecause water contains it in solution. When the water is withdrawn from\r\na marsh, free access is given to the air, and the marsh is changed into\r\na fruitful meadow.\" Animal and vegetable matter do not decay, or\r\ndecompose, so as to furnish food for plants, unless freely supplied with\r\noxygen, which they must obtain from air. A slight quantity of air,\r\nhowever, is sufficient for putrefaction, which is a powerful deoxydizing\r\nprocess that extracts oxygen even from the roots of plants.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to think of the earth as a compact body of matter,\r\nvast and inert; subject, indeed, to be upheaved and rent by volcanoes\r\nand earthquakes, but as quite insensible to slight influences which\r\noperate upon living beings and upon vegetation. This, however, is a\r\ngreat mistake; and it may be interesting to refer to one or two facts,\r\nwhich illustrate the wonderful effect of changes of the atmosphere upon\r\nthe soil, and upon the subterranean currents of the earth. The following\r\nis from remarks by Mr. Denton, in a public address:\r\n\r\n     \"But, as a proof of the sensibility of a soil drained four feet\r\n     deep, to atmospheric changes, I may mention, that my attention has\r\n     been, on more than one occasion, called to the circumstance that\r\n     drains have been observed to run, after a discontinuance of that\r\n     duty, without any fall of rain on the surface of the drained land;\r\n     and, upon reference to the barometer, it has been found that the\r\n     quicksilver has fallen whenever this has occurred. Mr. George\r\n     Beaumont, jun., who first afforded tangible evidence of this\r\n     extraordinary circumstance, has permitted me to read the following\r\n     extracts of his letter:\r\n\r\n     \"'I can verify the case of the drains running without rain, during\r\n     a falling barometer, beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\n     \"'The case I named to you last year of the barometer falling four\r\n     days consecutively, and with rapidity, was a peculiarly favorable\r\n     time for noticing it, as it occurred in a dry time, and the drains\r\n     could be seen distinctly. My man, on being questioned and cautioned\r\n     by me not to exaggerate, has declared the actual stream of water\r\n     issuing from one particular drain to be as thick as a\r\n     three-eighth-inch wire. All the drains ran--they did more than\r\n     drop--and ditches, which were previously dry, became quite wet,\r\n     with a perceptible stream of water; this gradually ceased with the\r\n     change in the density of the atmosphere, as shown by the barometer.\r\n\r\n     \"'During last harvest, 1855, the men were cutting wheat, and on\r\n     getting near to a drain outlet, the ditch from the outlet downwards\r\n     was observed to be wet, and the drain was dripping. No rain fell in\r\n     sufficient quantity to enter the ground. The men drank of the water\r\n     while they were cutting the wheat. A few days after, it was dry\r\n     again. I have seen and noticed this phenomenon myself.'\r\n\r\n     \"A correspondent of the _Agricultural Gazette_ has stated, that\r\n     Professor Brocklesby, of Hartford, in America, had observed the\r\n     same phenomena, in the case of two springs in that country; and\r\n     explained, that the cause was 'the diminished atmospheric pressure\r\n     which exists before a rain.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lardner states many facts which support the ideas above suggested.\r\nIn his lectures on science, he says: \"When storms are breaking in the\r\nheavens, and sometimes long before their commencement, and when their\r\napproach has not yet been manifested by any appearances in the\r\nfirmament, phenomena are observed, apparently sympathetic, proceeding\r\nfrom the deep recesses of the earth, and exhibited under very various\r\nforms at its surface.\" Dr. Lardner cites many instances of fountains\r\nwhich, when a storm is approaching, burst forth with a violent flow of\r\nwater, before any rain has fallen.\r\n\r\nThe cases named by Prof. Brocklesby, referred to by Mr. Denton, are\r\nthose of a spring in Rutland, Vermont, and a brook in Concord,\r\nMassachusetts. Prof. Brocklesby states, as the result of his personal\r\nobservation, that the spring referred to, supplies an aqueduct; that, in\r\nseveral instances, when the spring had become so low, in a time of\r\ndrought, that no water ran in the aqueduct, it suddenly rose so as to\r\nfill the pipes, and furnish a supply of water, before any rain had\r\nfallen in the neighborhood. This occurrence, he says, was familiar to\r\nthe occupants of the premises, and they expected rain in a few days\r\nafter this mysterious flow of water; which expectations were usually, if\r\nnot always, realized.\r\n\r\nThe other instance is that of a brook in Concord, Mass., called Dodge's\r\nbrook, which Prof. B. says, he was informed, commenced frequently to\r\nrise very perceptibly before a drop of rain had fallen.\r\n\r\nWe have inquired of our friends in Concord about this matter, and find\r\nthat this opinion is entertained by many of the people who live near\r\nthis brook, and it is probably well founded, though we cannot ascertain\r\nthat accurate observations have been made, so as to afford any definite\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_Thorough drainage warms the soil._ It has been stated, on high\r\nauthority, that drainage raises the temperature of the soil, often as\r\nmuch as 15° F. Indian corn vegetates at about 55°. At 45°, the seed\r\nwould rot in the ground, without vegetating. The writer, however, has\r\nseen rye sprouted upon ice in an ice-house, with roots two inches long,\r\nso grown to the ice that they could only be separated by thawing. Winter\r\nrye, no doubt, makes considerable growth under snow. Cultivated plants,\r\nin general, however, do not grow at all, unless the soil be raised above\r\n45°. The sun has great power to warm dry soils, and, it is said, will\r\noften raise their temperature to 90° or 100°, when the air in the shade\r\nis only 60° or 70°. But the sun has no such power to warm a wet soil,\r\nand for several reasons, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _The soil is rendered cold by evaporation._ If water cannot pass\r\nthrough the land by drainage, either natural or artificial, it must\r\nescape, if at all, at the surface, by evaporation. Now, it is a fact\r\nwell known, that the heat disappears, or becomes latent, by the\r\nconversion of water into vapor. Every child knows this, practically, at\r\nleast, who, in Winter, has washed his hands and gone out without drying\r\nthem. The same evaporation which thus affects the hands, renders the\r\nland cold, when filled with water, every gallon of which thus carried\r\noff requires, and actually carries off, as much heat as would raise five\r\nand a half gallons of water from the freezing to the boiling point.\r\n\r\nMorton, in his \"Encyclopædia of Agriculture,\" estimates that it would\r\nrequire an expenditure of nearly 1,200 pounds of coal per day, to\r\nevaporate artificially one half the rain which falls on an acre during\r\nthe year. In other words, about 219 tons of coals annually, would be\r\nrequired for every acre of undrained land, so as to allow the free use\r\nof the sun's rays for the legitimate purpose of growing and maturing the\r\ncrops cultivated upon it. It will not then be surprising that undrained\r\nsoils are, in the language of the farmer, \"cold.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Heat will not pass downward in water._ If, therefore, your soil be\r\nsaturated with water, the heat of the sun, in Spring, cannot warm it,\r\nand your plowing and planting must be late, and your crop a failure.\r\nCount Rumford tried many experiments to illustrate the mode of the\r\npropagation of heat in fluids, and his conclusion, it is presumed, is\r\nnow held to be the true theory, that heat is transmitted in water only\r\nby the motion of the particles of water; so that, if you could stop the\r\nheated particles from rising, water could not be warmed except where it\r\ntouches the vessel containing it. Heat applied to the bottom of a vessel\r\nof water warms the particles in contact with the vessel, and colder\r\nparticles descend, and so the whole is warmed.\r\n\r\nHeat, applied to the surface of the water, can never warm it, except so\r\nfar as it is conducted downward by some other medium than the water\r\nitself. Count Rumford confined cakes of ice in the bottom of glass jars,\r\nand, covering it with one thickness of paper, poured boiling-hot water\r\non the top of it, and there it remained for hours without melting the\r\nice. The paper was placed over the ice, so that the hot water could not\r\nbe poured on it, which would have thawed it at once. Every man who has\r\npoured hot water into a frozen pump, hoping to thaw out the ice by this\r\nmeans, has arrived at the fact, if not at the theory, that ice will not\r\nmelt by hot water on the top of it. If, however, a piece of lead pipe be\r\nplaced in the pump, resting on the ice, and hot water be poured through\r\nit, the ice will melt at once. In the first instance, the hot water in\r\ncontact with the ice becomes cold; and there it remains, because cold\r\nwater is heavier than warm, and there it will remain, though the top be\r\nboiling. But when hot water is poured through the pipe, the downward\r\ncurrent drives away the cold water, and brings heated particles in\r\nsuccession to the ice.\r\n\r\nHeat is propagated in water, then, only by circulation; that is, by the\r\nupward movement of the heated particles, and the downward movement of\r\nthe colder ones to take their place. Anything which obstructs\r\ncirculation, prevents the passage of heat. Chocolate retains heat longer\r\nthan tea, because it is thicker, and the hot particles cannot so readily\r\nrise to be cooled at the surface. Count Rumford illustrated this fact\r\nsatisfactorily, by putting eider-down into water, which was found to\r\nobstruct the circulation, and to prevent the rapid heating and cooling\r\nof it. The same is true of all viscous substances, as starch and glue;\r\nand so of oil. They retain heat much longer than water or spirits.\r\n\r\nIn a soil saturated with water, or even in water thickened with mud,\r\nthere could then be but little circulation of the particles, even were\r\nthe heat applied at the bottom instead of the top. Probably the soil,\r\nthough saturated with water, does, to some extent, transmit heat from\r\none particle of earth to another, but it must be but very slowly.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter upon Temperature as affected by Drainage, farther\r\nillustrations of this point may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nAERATION BY DRAINS.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages of thorough-drainage, is reckoned by all, the\r\ncirculation of air through the soil. No drop of water can run from the\r\nsoil into a drain without its place being supplied by air, unless there\r\nis more water to supply it; so that drainage, in this way, manifestly\r\npromotes the permeation of air through the soil.\r\n\r\nBut it is claimed that drains may be made to promote circulation of air\r\nin another way, and in dry times, when no water is flowing through them,\r\nby connecting them together by means of a header at the upper ends, and\r\nleaving an opening so that the air may pass freely through the whole\r\nsystem. Our friend, Prof. Mapes, is an advocate for this practice, and\r\ncertainly the theory seems well supported. It is said that in dry, hot\r\nweather, when the air is most highly charged with moisture, currents\r\nthus passing constantly through the earth, must, by contact with the\r\ncooler subsoil, part with large quantities of moisture, and tend to\r\nmoisten the soil from the drains to the surface, giving off also with\r\nthe moisture whatever of fertilizing elements the air may bear with it.\r\n\r\nThis point has not escaped the notice of English drainers. Mr. J. H.\r\nCharnock, an assistant commissioner under the Drainage act, in 1843,\r\nread a paper in favor of this practice, but in 1849 he published a\r\nsecond article in which he suggests doubts of the advantages of such\r\narrangements, and says he has discontinued their application. He says\r\nthey add to the cost of the work, and tend to the decay of the pipes,\r\nand to promote the growth into the pipes, of any roots that may approach\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes, in a published article in 1846, speaks of this idea, but\r\npasses it by as of very little importance. Mr. Denton quotes the\r\nauthority of some of his correspondents strongly in favor of this\r\ntheory. After trying some experiments himself upon clay soil, he admits\r\nthe advantages of such an arrangement for such soil, in the following\r\nnot very enthusiastic terms:\r\n\r\n\"It will be readily understood that as clay will always contract rapidly\r\nunder the influence of a draught of air, in consequence of the rapid\r\nevaporation of moisture from its surface, one of the benefits of\r\ndraining is thus very cheaply acquired; and for the denser clays it may\r\npossibly be a desirable thing to do, but in the porous soils it would\r\nappear that no advantage is gained by it.\"\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding this summary disposition of the question in\r\nEngland, it is by no means clear, that in the tropical heat of American\r\nsummers, when the difference between the temperature of the air and the\r\nsubsoil is so much greater than it can ever be in England, and when we\r\nsuffer from severer droughts than are common there, we may not find\r\nsubstantial practical advantage from the passage of these air currents\r\nthrough the soil.\r\n\r\nWe are not aware of experiments in America, accurate enough to be quoted\r\nas authority on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE ADAPTS THE SOIL TO GERMINATION AND VEGETATION.\r\n\r\n     Process of Germination.--Two Classes of Pores in Soils, illustrated\r\n     by Cuts.--Too much Water excludes Air, reduces Temperature.--How\r\n     much Air the Soil Contains.--Drainage Improves the Quality of\r\n     Crops.--Drainage prevents Drought.--Drained Soils hold most\r\n     Water.--Allow Roots to go Deep.--Various Facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo apology will be necessary for the long extract which we are about to\r\ngive, to any person who will read it with attention. It is from a\r\nlecture on Agricultural Science, by Dr. Madden, and we confess ourselves\r\nincompetent to condense or improve the language of the learned author.\r\n\r\nWe think we are safe in saying that it has never been before published\r\nin America:\r\n\r\n     \"The first thing which occurs after the sowing of the seed is, of\r\n     course, _germination_; and before we examine how this process may\r\n     be influenced by the condition of the soil, we must necessarily\r\n     obtain some correct idea of the process itself. The most careful\r\n     examination has proved that the process of germination consists\r\n     essentially of various chemical changes, which require for their\r\n     development the presence of air, moisture, and a certain degree of\r\n     warmth. Now it is obviously unnecessary for our present purpose\r\n     that we should have the least idea of the nature of these\r\n     processes: all we require to do, is to ascertain the conditions\r\n     under which they take place; having detected these, we know at once\r\n     what is required to make a seed grow. These, we have seen, are air,\r\n     moisture, and a certain degree of warmth; and it consequently\r\n     results, that wherever a seed is placed in these circumstances,\r\n     germination will take place. Viewing matters in this light, it\r\n     appears that soil does not act _chemically_ in the process of\r\n     germination; that its sole action is confined to its being the\r\n     vehicle, by means of which a supply of air and moisture and warmth\r\n     can be continually kept up. With this simple statement in view, we\r\n     are quite prepared to consider the various conditions of soil, for\r\n     the purpose of determining how far these will influence the future\r\n     prospects of the crop, and we shall accordingly at once proceed to\r\n     examine carefully into the _mechanical relations of the soil_. This\r\n     we propose doing by the aid of figures. Soil examined mechanically,\r\n     is found to consist entirely of particles of all shapes and sizes,\r\n     from stones and pebbles, down to the finest powder; and, on account\r\n     of their extreme irregularity of shape, they cannot lie so close to\r\n     one another as to prevent there being passages between them, owing\r\n     to which circumstance soil in the mass is always more or less\r\n     _porous_. If, however, we proceed to examine one of the smallest\r\n     particles of which soil is made up, we shall find that even this is\r\n     not always solid, but is much more frequently porous, like soil in\r\n     the mass. A considerable proportion of this finely-divided part of\r\n     soil, _the impalpable matter_ as it is generally called, is found,\r\n     by the aid of the microscope, to consist of _broken-down vegetable\r\n     tissue_, so that when a small portion of the finest dust from a\r\n     garden or field is placed under the microscope, we have exhibited\r\n     to us particles of every variety of shape and structure, of which a\r\n     certain part is evidently of vegetable origin. In these figures I\r\n     have given a very rude representation of these particles; and I\r\n     must beg you particularly to remember that they are not meant to\r\n     represent by any means accurately what the microscope exhibits, but\r\n     are only designed to serve as a plan by which to illustrate the\r\n     mechanical properties of the soil. On referring to Fig. 91, we\r\n     perceive that there are two distinct classes of pores; first, the\r\n     large ones, which exist _between_ the particles of soil, and\r\n     second, the very minute ones, which occur in the particles\r\n     themselves; and you will at the same time notice, that whereas all\r\n     the larger pores--those between the particles of soil--communicate\r\n     most freely with each other, so that they form canals, the small\r\n     pores, however freely they may communicate with one another in the\r\n     interior of the particle in which they occur, have no direct\r\n     connection with the pores of the surrounding particles. Let us now,\r\n     therefore, trace the effect of this arrangement. In Fig. 91, we\r\n     perceive that these canals and pores are all empty, the soil being\r\n     _perfectly dry_; and the canals communicating freely at the surface\r\n     with the surrounding atmosphere, the whole will of course be filled\r\n     with air. If in this condition, a seed be placed in the soil, as at\r\n     _a_, you at once perceive that it is freely supplied with air, _but\r\n     there is no moisture_; therefore, when soil is _perfectly dry_, a\r\n     seed cannot grow.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\n     \"Let us turn our attention now to Fig. 92. Here we perceive that\r\n     both the pores and canals are no longer represented white, but\r\n     black, this color being used to indicate water; in this instance,\r\n     therefore, water has taken the place of air, or, in other words,\r\n     the soil is _very wet_. If we observe our seed _a_ now, we find it\r\n     abundantly supplied with water, but _no air_. Here again,\r\n     therefore, germination cannot take place. It may be well to state\r\n     here, that this can never occur _exactly_ in nature, because water\r\n     having the power of dissolving air to a certain extent, the seed\r\n     _a_ in Fig. 92 is, in fact, supplied with a _certain_ amount of\r\n     this necessary substance; and, owing to this, germination does take\r\n     place, although by no means under such advantageous circumstances\r\n     as it would were the soil in a better condition.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\n     \"We pass on now to Fig. 93. Here we find a different state of\r\n     matters. The canals are open and freely supplied with air, while\r\n     the pores are filled with water; and consequently you perceive\r\n     that, while the seed _a_ has quite enough of air from the canals,\r\n     it can never be without moisture, as every particle of soil which\r\n     touches it, is well supplied with this necessary ingredient. This,\r\n     then, is the proper condition of soil for germination, and in fact\r\n     for every period of the plant's development; and this condition\r\n     occurs when soil is _moist_ but not _wet_--that is to say, when it\r\n     has the color and appearance of being well watered, but when it is\r\n     still capable of being crumbled to pieces by the hands, without any\r\n     of its particles adhering together in the familiar form of mud.\r\n\r\n     \"Turning our eyes to Fig. 94, we observe still another condition of\r\n     soil. In this instance, as far as _water_ is concerned, the soil is\r\n     in its healthy condition--it is moist, but not wet, the pores alone\r\n     being filled with water. But where are the canals? We see them in a\r\n     few places, but in by far the greater part of the soil none are to\r\n     be perceived; this is owing to the particles of soil having adhered\r\n     together, and thus so far obliterated the interstitial canals, that\r\n     they appear only like pores. This is the state of matters in every\r\n     _clod of earth_, _b_; and you will at once perceive, on comparing\r\n     it with _c_, which represents a stone, that these two differ only\r\n     in possessing a few pores, which latter, while they may form a\r\n     reservoir for moisture, can never act as vehicles for the _food_ of\r\n     plants, as the roots are not capable of extending their fibres into\r\n     the interior of a clod, but are at all times confined to the\r\n     interstitial canals.\r\n\r\n     \"With these four conditions before us, let us endeavor to apply\r\n     them _practically_ to ascertain when they occur in our fields, and\r\n     how those which are injurious may be obviated.\r\n\r\n     \"The first of them, we perceive, is a state of too great dryness,\r\n     _a very rare_ condition, in this climate at least; in fact, the\r\n     only case in which it is likely to occur is in very coarse sands,\r\n     where the soil, being chiefly made up of pure sand and particles of\r\n     flinty matter, contains comparatively much fewer pores; and, from\r\n     the large size of the individual particles, assisted by their\r\n     irregularity, the canals are wider, the circulation of air freer,\r\n     and, consequently, the whole is much more easily dried. When this\r\n     state of matters exists, the best treatment is to leave all the\r\n     stones which occur on the surface of the field, as they cast\r\n     shades, and thereby prevent or retard the evaporation of water.\r\n\r\n     \"We will not, however, make any further observations on this very\r\n     rare case, but will rather proceed to Fig. 92, a much more\r\n     frequent, and, in every respect, more important condition of soil:\r\n     I refer to an _excess of water_.\r\n\r\n     \"When water is added to perfectly dry soil, it, of course, in the\r\n     first instance, fills the interstitial canals, and from these\r\n     enters the pores of each particle; and if the supply of water be\r\n     not too great, the canals speedily become empty, so that the whole\r\n     of the fluid is taken up by the pores: this, we have already seen,\r\n     is the _healthy_ condition of the soil. If, however, the supply of\r\n     water be too great, as is the case when a spring gains admission\r\n     into the soil, or when the sinking of the fluid through the canals\r\n     to a sufficient depth below the surface is prevented, it is clear\r\n     that these also must get filled with water so soon as the pores\r\n     have become saturated. This, then, is the condition of _undrained\r\n     soil_.\r\n\r\n     \"Not only are the pores filled, but the interstitial canals are\r\n     likewise full; and the consequence is, that the whole process of\r\n     the germination and growth of vegetables is materially interfered\r\n     with. We shall here, therefore briefly state the injurious effects\r\n     of an excess of water, for the purpose of impressing more strongly\r\n     on your minds the necessity of thorough-draining, as the first and\r\n     most essential step towards the improvement of your soil.\r\n\r\n     \"The _first_ great effect of an excess of water is, that it\r\n     produces a corresponding diminution of the amount of air beneath\r\n     the surface, which air is of the greatest possible consequence in\r\n     the nutrition of plants; in fact, if entirely excluded, germination\r\n     could not take place, and the seed sown would, of course, either\r\n     decay or lie dormant.\r\n\r\n     \"_Secondly_, an excess of water is most hurtful, by reducing\r\n     considerably the _temperature_ of the soil: this I find, by careful\r\n     experiment, to be to the extent of six and a-half degrees\r\n     Fahrenheit in Summer, which amount is equivalent to an elevation\r\n     above the level of the sea of 1,950 feet.\r\n\r\n     \"These are the two chief injuries of an excess of water in soil\r\n     which affect the soil itself. There are very many others affecting\r\n     the climate, &c.; but these not so connected with the subject in\r\n     hand as to call for an explanation here.\r\n\r\n     \"Of course, all these injurious effects are at once overcome by\r\n     thorough-draining, the result of which is, to establish a direct\r\n     communication between the interstitial canals and the drains, by\r\n     which means it follows, that no water can remain any length of time\r\n     in these canals without, by its gravitation, finding its way into\r\n     the drains.\r\n\r\n     \"The 4th Fig. indicates badly-cultivated soil, or soil in which\r\n     large unbroken clods exist; which clods, as we have already seen,\r\n     are very little better than stones, on account of their\r\n     impermeability to air and the roots of plants.\r\n\r\n     \"Too much cannot be said in favor of pulverizing the soil; even\r\n     thorough-draining itself will not supersede the necessity of\r\n     performing this most necessary operation. The whole valuable\r\n     effects of plowing, harrowing, grubbing, &c., may be reduced to\r\n     this: and almost the whole superiority of _garden_ over _field_\r\n     produce is referable to the greater perfection to which this\r\n     pulverizing of the soil can be carried.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole success of the drill husbandry is owing, in a great\r\n     measure, to its enabling you to stir up the soil well during the\r\n     progress of your crop; which stirring up is of no value beyond its\r\n     effects in more minutely pulverizing the soil, increasing, as far\r\n     as possible, the size and number of the interstitial canals.\r\n\r\n     \"Lest any one should suppose that the contents of these\r\n     interstitial canals must be so minute that their whole amount can\r\n     be of but little consequence, I may here notice the fact, that, in\r\n     moderately well pulverized soil, they amount to no less than\r\n     one-fourth of the whole bulk of the soil itself; for example, 100\r\n     cubic inches of _moist_ soil (that is, of soil in which the pores\r\n     are filled with water while the canals are filled with air),\r\n     contain no less than 25 cubic inches of air. According to this\r\n     calculation, in a field pulverized to the depth of eight inches, a\r\n     depth perfectly attainable on most soils by careful tillage, every\r\n     imperial acre will retain beneath its surface no less than\r\n     12,545,280 cubic inches of air. And, to take one more element into\r\n     the calculation, supposing the soil were not properly drained, the\r\n     sufficient pulverizing of an additional inch in depth would\r\n     increase the escape of water from the surface by upwards of one\r\n     hundred gallons a day.\"\r\n\r\n_Drainage improves the quality of crops._ In a dry season, we frequently\r\nhear the farmer boast of the quality of his products. His hay-crop, he\r\nsays, is light, but will \"spend\" much better than the crop of a wet\r\nseason; his potatoes are not large, but they are sound and mealy.\r\nIndeed, this topic need not be enlarged upon. Every farmer knows that\r\nhis wheat and corn are heavier and more sound when grown upon land\r\nsufficiently drained.\r\n\r\n_Drainage prevents drought._ This proposition is somewhat startling at\r\nfirst view. How can draining land make it more moist? One would as soon\r\nthink of watering land to make it dry. A drought is the enemy we all\r\ndread. Professor Espy has a plan for producing rain, by lighting\r\nextensive artificial fires. A great objection to his theory is, that he\r\ncannot limit his showers to his own land, and all the public would never\r\nbe ready for a shower on the same day. If we can really protect our land\r\nfrom drought, by under-draining it, everybody may at once engage in the\r\nwork without offence to his neighbor.\r\n\r\nIf we take up a handfull of rich soil of almost any kind, after a heavy\r\nrain, we can squeeze it hard enough with the hand to press out drops of\r\nwater. If we should take of the same soil a large quantity, after it was\r\nso dry that not a drop of water could be pressed out by hand, and\r\nsubject it to the pressure of machinery, we should force from it more\r\nwater. Any boy, who has watched the process of making cider with the\r\nold-fashioned press, has seen the pomace, after it had been once pressed\r\napparently dry and cut down, and the screw applied anew to the \"cheese,\"\r\ngive out quantities of juice. These facts illustrate, first, how much\r\nwater may be held in the soil by attraction. They show, again, that more\r\nwater is held by a pulverized and open soil, than by a compact and close\r\none. Water is held in the soil between the minute particles of earth. If\r\nthese particles be pressed together compactly, there is no space left\r\nbetween them for water. The same is true of soil naturally compact. This\r\ncompactness exists more or less in most subsoils, certainly in all\r\nthrough which water does not readily pass. Hence, all these subsoils are\r\nrendered more permeable to water by being broken up and divided; and\r\nmore retentive by having the particles of which they are composed\r\nseparated, one from another--in a word, by pulverization. This increased\r\ncapacity to contain moisture by attraction, is the greatest security\r\nagainst drought. The plants, in a dry time send their rootlets\r\nthroughout the soil, and flourish in the moisture thus stored up for\r\ntheir time of need. The pulverization of drained land may be produced,\r\npartly by deep, or subsoil plowing, which is always necessary to perfect\r\nthe object of thorough-draining; but it is much aided, in stiff clays,\r\nalso, by the shrinkage of the soil by drying.\r\n\r\nDrainage resists drought, again, by the very deepening of the soil of\r\nwhich we have already spoken. The roots of plants, we have seen, will\r\nnot extend into stagnant water. If, then, as is frequently the case,\r\neven on sandy plains, the water-line be, in early Spring, very near the\r\nsurface, the seed may be planted, may vegetate, and throw up a goodly\r\nshow of leaves and stalks, which may flourish as long as the early rains\r\ncontinue; but, suddenly, the rains cease; the sun comes out in his June\r\nbrightness; the water-line lowers at once in the soil; the roots have no\r\ndepth to draw moisture from below, and the whole field of clover, or of\r\ncorn, in a single week, is past recovery. Now, if this light, sandy soil\r\nbe drained, so that, at the first start of the crop, there is a deep\r\nseed-bed free from water, the roots strike downward, at once, and thus\r\nprepare for a drought. The writer has seen upon deep-trenched land in\r\nhis own garden, parsnips, which, before midsummer, had extended downward\r\nthree feet, before they were as large as a common whiplash; and yet,\r\nthrough the Summer drought, continued to thrive till they attained in\r\nAutumn a length, including tops, of about seven feet, and an\r\nextraordinary size. A moment's reflection will satisfy any one that, the\r\ndryer the soil in Spring, the deeper will the roots strike, and the\r\nbetter able will be the plant to endure the Summer's drought.\r\n\r\nAgain, drainage and consequent pulverization and deepening of the soils\r\nincrease their capacity to absorb moisture from the atmosphere, and thus\r\nafford protection against drought. Watery vapor is constantly, in all\r\ndry weather, rising from the surface of the earth; and plants, in the\r\nday-time, are also, from their leaves and bark, giving off moisture\r\nwhich they draw from the soil. But Nature has provided a wonderful law\r\nof compensation for this waste, which would, without such provision,\r\nparch the earth to barrenness in a single rainless month.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the atmosphere to take up and convey water, furnishes\r\none of the grandest illustrations of the perfect work of the Author of\r\nthe Universe. \"All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not\r\nfull;\" and the sea is not full, because the numerous great rivers and\r\ntheir millions of tributaries, ever flowing from age to age, convey to\r\nthe ocean only as much water as the atmosphere carries back in vapor,\r\nand discharges upon the hills. The warmer the atmosphere, the greater\r\nits capacity to hold moisture. The heated, thirsty air of the tropics\r\ndrinks up the water of the ocean, and bears it away to the colder\r\nregions, where, through condensation by cold, it becomes visible as a\r\ncloud; and as a huge sponge pressed by an invisible hand, the cloud,\r\ncondensed still further by cold, sends down its water to the earth in\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe heated air over our fields and streams, in Summer, is loaded with\r\nmoisture as the sun declines. The earth has been cooled by radiation of\r\nits heat, and by constant evaporation through the day. By contact with\r\nthe cooler soil, the air, borne by its thousand currents gently along\r\nits surface, is condensed, and yields its moisture to the thirsty earth\r\nagain, in the form of dew.\r\n\r\nAt a Legislative Agricultural Meeting, held in Albany, New York, January\r\n25th, 1855, \"the great drought of 1854\" being the subject, the secretary\r\nstated that \"the experience of the past season has abundantly proved\r\nthat thorough-drainage upon soils requiring it, has proved a very great\r\nrelief to the farmer;\" that \"the crops upon such lands have been far\r\nbetter, generally, than those upon undrained lands, in the same\r\nlocality;\" and that, \"in many instances, the increased crop has been\r\nsufficient to defray the expenses of the improvement in a single year.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Harris, at the same meeting, said: \"An underdrained soil will\r\nbe found damper in dry weather, than an undrained one, and the\r\nthermometer shows a drained soil warmer in cold weather, and cooler in\r\nhot weather, than one which is undrained.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the New York State Agricultural Society, in his Report\r\nfor 1855, says: \"The testimony of farmers, in different sections of the\r\nState, is almost unanimous, that drained lands have suffered far less\r\nfrom drought than undrained.\" Alleghany county reports that \"drained\r\nlands have been less affected by the drought than undrained;\" Chatauque\r\ncounty, that \"the drained lands have stood the drought better than the\r\nundrained.\" The report from Clinton county says: \"Drained lands have\r\nbeen less affected by the drought than undrained.\" Montgomery county\r\nreports: \"We find that drained lands have a better crop in either wet or\r\ndry seasons than undrained.\"\r\n\r\nB. F. Nourse, of Orrington, Maine, states that, on his drained land, in\r\nthat State, \"during the drought of 1854, there was at all times\r\nsufficient dampness apparent on scraping the surface of the ground with\r\nhis foot in passing, and a crop of beans was planted, grown and gathered\r\ntherefrom, without as much rain as will usually fall in a shower of\r\nfifteen minutes' duration, while vegetation on the next field was\r\nparching for lack of moisture.\"\r\n\r\nA committee of the New York Farmers' Club, which visited the farm of\r\nProf. Mapes, in New Jersey, in the time of a severe drought, in 1855,\r\nreported that the Professor's fences were the boundaries of the drought,\r\nall the lands outside being affected by it, while his remained free from\r\ninjury. This was attributed, both by the committee and by Prof. Mapes\r\nhimself, to thorough-drainage and deep tillage with the subsoil plow.\r\n\r\nMr. Shedd, in the _N. E. Farmer_, says:\r\n\r\n     \"A simple illustration will show the effect which stagnant water,\r\n     within a foot or two of the surface, has on the roots of plants.\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps it will aid the reader, who doubts the benefit of\r\n     thorough-draining in case of drought, to see why it is beneficial.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 95.

If the soil be saturated with\r\nthe cold snow-water, the water which falls must, of course, run away\r\nupon the surface. If the soil be drained, the rain-water finds ready\r\nadmission into it, carrying and imparting to it a portion of its heat.\r\nThe experiments of Count Rumford, showing that heat is not propagated\r\ndownward in fluids, may be found at page 273. This is a principle too\r\nimportant to be overlooked, especially in New England, where we need\r\nevery aid from Nature and Art, to contend successfully against the\r\nbrevity of the planting season. Soil saturated with cold water, cannot\r\nbe warmed by any amount of heat applied to the surface. Warm water is\r\nlighter than cold water, and stays at the surface. In boiling water in a\r\nkettle, we apply fire at the bottom, and no amount of heat at the\r\nsurface of the vessel would produce the desired effect. So rapid is the\r\npassage of heat upward in water, that the hand may without injury be\r\nheld upon the bottom of a kettle of boiling water one minute after it\r\nhas been removed from the fire.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments and illustrations, from the _Horticulturist_\r\nof Nov. 1856, beautifully illustrate this point:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"RATIONALE OF DRAINING LAND EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\n     \"The reason why drained land gains heat, and water-logged land is\r\n     always cold, consists in the well-known fact that heat cannot be\r\n     transmitted _downwards_ through water. This may readily be seen by\r\n     the following experiments:\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 97.]\r\n\r\n     \"_Experiment No. 1._--A square box was made, of the form\r\n     represented by the annexed diagram, eighteen inches deep, eleven\r\n     inches wide at top, and six inches wide at bottom. It was filled\r\n     with peat, saturated with water to _c_, forming to that depth\r\n     (twelve and a half inches) a sort of artificial bog. The box was\r\n     then filled with water to _d_. A thermometer _a_, was plunged, so\r\n     that its bulb was within one inch and a half of the bottom. The\r\n     temperature of the whole mass of peat and water was found to be\r\n     39-1/2° Fahr. A gallon of boiling water was then added; it raised\r\n     the surface of the water to _e_. In five minutes, the thermometer,\r\n     _a_, rose to 44°, owing to the conduction of heat by the\r\n     thermometer and its guard tube; at ten minutes from the\r\n     introduction of the hot water, the thermometer, _a_, rose to 46°,\r\n     and it subsequently rose no higher. Another thermometer, _b_,\r\n     dipping under the surface of the water at _e_, was then introduced,\r\n     and the following are the indications of the two thermometers at\r\n     the respective intervals, reckoning from the time the hot water was\r\n     supplied:\r\n\r\n                          _Thermometer b._   _Thermometer a._\r\n              20 minutes        150°               46°\r\n      1 hour  30    \"           101°               45°\r\n      2 hours 30    \"            80-1/2°           42°\r\n     12  \"    40    \"            45°               40°\r\n\r\n     \"The mean temperature of the external air to which the box was\r\n     exposed during the above period, was 42°, the maximum being 47°,\r\n     and the minimum 37°.\r\n\r\n     \"_Experiment No. 2._--With the same arrangement as in the preceding\r\n     case, a gallon of boiling water was introduced above the peat and\r\n     water, when the thermometer _a_, was at 36°; in ten minutes it rose\r\n     to 40°. The cock was then turned for the purpose of drainage, which\r\n     was but slowly effected; and, at the end of twenty minutes, the\r\n     thermometer _a_, indicated 40°; at twenty-five minutes, 42°, whilst\r\n     the thermometer _b_, was 142°. At thirty minutes, the cock was\r\n     withdrawn from the box, and more free egress of water being thus\r\n     afforded, at thirty-five minutes the flow was no longer continuous,\r\n     and the thermometer _b_, indicated 48°. The mass was drained, and\r\n     permeable to a fresh supply of water. Accordingly, another gallon\r\n     of boiling water was poured over it; and, in\r\n\r\n             3 minutes, the thermometer _a_, rose to      77°.\r\n             5           \"      \"            fell to      76-1/2°.\r\n            15           \"      \"              \"          70-1/2°.\r\n            20           \"      \"            remained at  71°.\r\n     1 hour 50           \"      \"              \"      \"   70-1/2°.\r\n\r\n     \"In these two experiments, the thermometer at the bottom of the box\r\n     suddenly rose a few degrees immediately after the hot water was\r\n     added; and it might be inferred that the heat was carried downwards\r\n     by the water. But, in reality, the rise was owing to the action of\r\n     the hot water on the thermometer, and not to its action upon the\r\n     cold water. To prove this, the perpendicular thermometers were\r\n     removed. The box was filled with peat and water to within three\r\n     inches of the top, a horizontal thermometer, _a f_, having been\r\n     previously secured through a hole made in the side of the box, by\r\n     means of a tight-fitting cork, in which the naked stem of the\r\n     thermometer was grooved. A gallon of boiling water was then added.\r\n     The thermometer, a very delicate one, was _not in the least\r\n     affected_ by the boiling water in the top of the box.\r\n\r\n     \"In this experiment, the wooden box may be supposed to be a field;\r\n     the peat and cold water represent the water-logged portion; rain\r\n     falls on the surface, and becomes warmed by contact with the soil,\r\n     and, thus heated, descends. But it is stopped by the cold water,\r\n     and the heat will go no further. But, if the soil is drained, and\r\n     not water-logged, the warm rain trickles through the crevices of\r\n     the earth, carrying to the drain-level the high temperature it had\r\n     gained on the surface, parts with it to the soil as it passes\r\n     down, and thus produces that bottom heat which is so essential to\r\n     plants, although so few suspect its existence.\"\r\n\r\nWater, although it will not conduct heat downwards, is a ready vehicle\r\nof cold from the surface towards the bottom. Water becomes heavier by\r\ncooling till it is reduced to about 39°, at which point it attains its\r\ngreatest density, and has a tendency to go to the bottom until the whole\r\nmass is reduced to this low temperature. Thus, the circulation of water\r\nin the saturated soil, in some conditions of the temperature of the\r\nsurface and subsoil, may have a chilling effect which could not be\r\nproduced on drained soil.\r\n\r\nAfter water is reduced to about 39°, instead of obeying the common law\r\nof becoming heavier by cooling, it forms a remarkable exception to it,\r\nand becomes lighter until it freezes. Were it not for this admirable\r\nprovision of Nature, all our ponds and rivers would, in the Winter,\r\nbecome solid ice from the surface to the bottom. Now as the surface\r\nwater is chilled it goes to the bottom, and is replaced by warmer water,\r\nwhich rises, until the whole is reduced to the point of greatest\r\ndensity. Then the circulation ceases, and the water colder than 39°\r\nremains at the surface, is converted into ice which becomes still\r\nlighter, by crystallization, and floats upon the surface.\r\n\r\nNo experiments, showing the temperature of undrained soils at various\r\ndepths, in the United States, have come to our knowledge. Mr. Gisborne\r\nsays: \"Many experiments have shown that, in retentive soils, the\r\ntemperature, at two or three feet below the surface of the water-table,\r\nis, at no period of the year, higher than from 46° to 48° in\r\nagricultural Britain.\" Prof. Henry states in the Patent Office Report\r\nfor 1857, that in the cellars of the observatory, at Paris, at the depth\r\nof sixty-seven and a half feet, in fifty years, the temperature has\r\nnever varied a tenth of a degree from 53° 28', in all that period,\r\nSummer or Winter.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkes gives the results of a valuable series of experiments, in\r\nwhich he compared the temperature of drained and undrained portions of a\r\nbog. He found the temperature of the undrained portion to remain\r\nsteadily at 46°, at all depths, from one to thirty feet; and at seven\r\ninches from the surface, the temperature remained at 47° during the\r\nexperiments. During the same period, the temperature of the drained\r\nportion was 48-1/4° at two feet seven inches below the surface, and at\r\nseven inches, reached as high as 66° during a thunder-storm; while, on a\r\nmean of thirty-five observations, the temperature at the latter\r\ndepth was 10° higher than at the same depth in the undrained portion of\r\nthe bog.\r\n\r\nWe find in the \"Agriculture of New York,\" the results of observations\r\nmade at Albany and at Scott, in that State, in the year 1848, upon\r\ntemperature at different depths. The condition of the soil is not\r\ndescribed, but it is presumed that it was soil naturally drained in both\r\ncases. A few of the results may give the reader some idea of the range\r\nof underground temperature, as compared with that of the air.\r\n\r\n    Temperature at Albany at two feet depth.\r\n        \"      \"     \"    highest August 17 and 18,          70°\r\n        \"      \"     \"    lowest February 28,                32-3/4°\r\n                                                             ----\r\n        \"      \"     \"      Range,                           37-1/4°\r\n                                                             ----\r\n        \"      \"     \"    at four feet depth.\r\n        \"      \"     \"    highest July 29,                   64-1/2°\r\n        \"      \"     \"    lowest February 25,                35-1/2°\r\n                                                             ----\r\n        \"      \"     \"      Range,                           29°\r\n                                                             ----\r\n        \"      \"     \"    of the air, February 12,           -3°\r\n        \"      \"     \"     \"     \"   August, 3, P.

The effects of rain on drained soil,\r\nin the heat of Summer, are, then, two-fold; to cool the burning surface,\r\nwhich is, as we have seen, much warmer than the rain, and, at the same\r\ntime, to warm the subsoil which is cooler than the rain itself, as it\r\nfalls, and very much cooler than the rain-water, as it is warmed by its\r\npassage through the hot surface soil. These are beautiful provisions of\r\nNature, by which the excesses of heat and cold are mitigated, and the\r\ntemperature of the soil rendered more uniform, upon land adapted, by\r\ndrainage, to her genial influences.\r\n\r\nUpon the saturated and water-logged bog, as we have seen, the effect of\r\nthe greatest heat is insufficient to raise the temperature of the\r\nsubsoil a single degree, while the surface may be burned up and\r\n\"shrivelled like a parched scroll.\"\r\n\r\nDrainage also raises the temperature of the soil by the admission of\r\nwarm air. This proposition is closely connected with that just\r\ndiscussed. When the air is warmer than the soil, as it always is in the\r\nSpring-time, the water from the melting snow, or from rain, upon drained\r\nland, passes downward, and runs off by its gravitation. As \"Nature\r\nabhors a vacuum,\" the little spaces in the soil, from which the water\r\npasses, must be filled with air, and this air can only be supplied from\r\nthe surface, and, being warmer than the ground, tends to raise its\r\ntemperature. No such effect can be produced in land not drained, because\r\nno water runs out of it, and there are, consequently, no such spaces\r\nopened for the warm air to enter.\r\n\r\nDrainage equalizes the temperature of the soil in Summer by increasing\r\nthe deposit of dew. Of this we shall speak further, in a future\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Drainage raises the temperature in Spring by diminishing evaporation._\r\nEvaporation may be defined to be the conversion of liquid and solid\r\nbodies into elastic fluids, by the influence of caloric.\r\n\r\nBy heating water over a fire, bubbles rise from the bottom of the\r\nvessel, adhere awhile to the sides of it, and then ascend to the\r\nsurface, and burst and go off in visible vapor, or, in other words, by\r\nevaporation. Water is evaporated by the heat of the sun merely, and even\r\nwithout this heat, in the open air. It is evaporated at very low\r\ntemperatures, when fully exposed to the air. Even ice evaporates in the\r\nopen air. We often observe in Winter, that a thin covering of ice or\r\nsnow disappears from our roads, although there has been no thawing\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter, we have considered the subject of \"Evaporation and\r\nFiltration,\" and endeavored to give some general idea of the proportion\r\nof the rain which escapes by evaporation. We have seen, that evaporation\r\nproceeds much more rapidly from a surface of water, as a pond or river,\r\nthan from a land surface, unless it be fully saturated, and that\r\nevaporation from the water exceeds the whole amount of rain, about as\r\nmuch as evaporation from the land falls short of the amount of rain.\r\nThus, by this simple agency of evaporation, the vast quantities of water\r\nthat are constantly flowing, in all the rivers of the earth, into the\r\nsea, are brought back again to the land, and so the great system of\r\ncirculation is maintained throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nAs evaporation is greatest from a water-surface, so it is greater, other\r\nthings being equal, according to the wetness of the surface of any given\r\nfield. If the field be covered with water, it becomes a water-surface\r\nfor the time, and the evaporation is like that from a pond. If, as is\r\noften the case, the water stands on it in spots, over half its surface,\r\nand the rest is saturated, the evaporation is scarcely less, and has\r\nbeen said to be even more; while, if the surface be comparatively dry,\r\nthe evaporation is very little.\r\n\r\nBut what harm does evaporation do? and what has all this scientific talk\r\nto do with drainage? These, my friend, are very practical questions, and\r\njust the ones which it is proposed to answer; but we must bear in mind\r\nthat, as Nature conducts her grand affairs by systematic laws, the small\r\nportion of her domain which for a brief space of time we occupy, is not\r\nexempted from their operation. Some of these laws we may comprehend, and\r\nturn our knowledge of them to practical account. Of others, we may note\r\nthe results, without apprehending the reasons of them; for it is true--\r\n\r\n    \"There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussions of this kind may seem dry, though the subject itself be\r\nmoisture. They belong, certainly, to the topic under consideration.\r\n\r\nEvaporation does harm in the Spring-time, because it produces cold, just\r\nwhen we most want heat. How it produces cold, is not so readily\r\nexplained. The fact may be made as evident as the existence of sin in\r\nthe world, and, possibly, the reason of it may be as unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe books say, that heat always disappears when a solid body becomes a\r\nliquid; and so it is, that the air always remains cool while the snow\r\nand ice are melting in Spring. Again, it is said that heat always\r\ndisappears, when a fluid becomes vapor. These are said to be laws or\r\nprinciples of nature, and are said to explain other phenomena. To a\r\npractical mind, it is perhaps just as satisfactory to say that\r\nevaporation produces cold, as to state the principle or law in the\r\nlanguage of science.\r\n\r\nThat the fact is so, may be proved by many illustrations. Stockhardt\r\ngives the following experiment, which is strikingly appropriate:\r\n\r\n     \"Fill a tube half full of water, and fasten securely round the bulb\r\n     of it, a piece of cloth. Saturate the cloth with cold water, and\r\n     then twirl the tube rapidly between the hands; presently the water\r\n     in the tube will become sensibly colder, and the degree of cold may\r\n     be accurately determined by the thermometer. Moisten the cloth with\r\n     ether, a very volatile liquid, and twirl it again in the same\r\n     manner as before; by which means, its contents, even in Summer, may\r\n     be converted into ice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate for us, that our Spring showers are not of ether;\r\nfor then, instead of thawing, our land would freeze the harder! The heat\r\nof the blood is about 98°; yet man can endure a heat of many degrees\r\nmore, and even labor under a Summer sun, which would raise the\r\nthermometer to 130°, without the temperature of his blood being\r\nmaterially affected, and it is because of perspiration, which absorbs\r\nthe surplus heat, or, in other words, creates cold. It is said, too,\r\nthat on the same principle, if two saucers, one filled with water warm\r\nenough to give off visible vapor, the other filled with water just from\r\nthe well, are exposed in a sharp frosty morning, that filled with the\r\nwarm water will exhibit ice soonest. Wine is cooled by evaporation, by\r\nwrapping the bottle in wet flannel, and exposing it to the air.\r\n\r\nIf, after all this, any one doubts the fact that evaporation tends to\r\nproduce cold, let him countenance his skepticism, by wetting his face\r\nwith warm water, and going into the air in a Winter's day, and his faith\r\nwill be greatly strengthened.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the northern part of America, most water in the soil in the\r\nSpring of the year, just at the time when we most need a genial warmth\r\nto promote germination. If land is well drained, this water sinks\r\ndownward, and runs away in the drains, instead of passing upward by\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nDrainage, therefore, diminishes evaporation simply by removing the\r\nsurplus snow and rain-water by filtration. It thus raises the\r\ntemperature of the soil in that part of the season, when water is\r\nflowing from the drains; but, in the heat of Summer, the influence of\r\nthe showers which refresh without saturating the soil, and are retained\r\nin it by attraction, is not lessened. As a good soil retains by\r\nattraction about one-half its weight of water that cannot be drained\r\nout, there can be no reasonable apprehension that the \"gentle Summer\r\nshowers\" will be wasted by filtration, even upon thorough-drained land,\r\nwhile an avenue is open, by the drains, for the escape of drowning\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nTo show the general effect of drainage, in raising the temperature of\r\nwet lands in Summer, the following statement of Mr. Parkes is valuable.\r\nAn elevation of the temperature of the subsoil ten degrees, will be seen\r\nto be very material, when we consider that Indian corn will not vegetate\r\nat all at 53°, but will start at once at 63°, 55° being its lowest point\r\nof germination:\r\n\r\n     \"As regards the temperature of the water derived from drainage at\r\n     different seasons of the year, I am unacquainted with any published\r\n     facts. This is a subject of the highest import, as thermometric\r\n     observations may be rendered demonstrative, in the truest manner,\r\n     of the effect of drainage on the climate of the soil. At present, I\r\n     must limit myself to saying, that I have never known the water of\r\n     drainage issue from land drained at Midsummer, to depths of four\r\n     and five feet, at a higher temperature than 52° or 53° Fahrenheit:\r\n     whereas, in the following year and subsequent years, the water\r\n     discharged from the same drains, at the same period, will issue at\r\n     a temperature of 60°, and even so high as 63°, thus exhibiting the\r\n     increase of heat conferred during the Summer months on the\r\n     terrestrial climate by drainage. This is the all-important fact\r\n     connected with the art and science of land-drainage.\"\r\n\r\nBesides affecting favorably the temperature of the particular field\r\nwhich is drained, the general effect of the drainage of wet lands upon\r\nthe climate of the neighborhood has often been noticed. In the paper\r\nalready cited, emanating from the Board of Health, we find the\r\nfollowing remarks, which are in accordance with all observation in\r\ndistricts where under-drainage has been generally practiced:\r\n\r\n     \"Every one must have remarked, on passing from a district with a\r\n     retentive soil to one of an open porous nature--respectively\r\n     characterized as cold and warm soils--that, often, whilst the air\r\n     on the retentive soil is cold and raw, that on the drier soil is\r\n     comparatively warm and genial. The same effect which is here caused\r\n     naturally, may be produced artificially, by providing for the\r\n     perfect escape of superfluous water by drainage, so as to leave\r\n     less to cool down the air by evaporation. The reason of this\r\n     difference is two-fold. In the first place, much heat is saved, as\r\n     much heat being required for the vaporization of water, as would\r\n     elevate the temperature of more than three million times its bulk\r\n     of air one degree. It follows, therefore, that for every inch in\r\n     depth of water carried off by drains, which must otherwise\r\n     evaporate, as much heat is saved per acre as would elevate eleven\r\n     thousand million cubic feet of air one degree in temperature. But\r\n     that is not all. Not only is the temperature of the air reduced,\r\n     but its dew point is raised, by water being evaporated which might\r\n     be drained off; consequently, the want of drainage renders the air\r\n     both colder and more liable to the formation of dew and mists, and\r\n     its dampness affects comfort even more than its temperature. It is\r\n     easy, then, to understand how local climate is so much affected by\r\n     surplus moisture, and so remarkably improved by drainage. A farmer\r\n     being asked the effect on temperature of some new drainage works;\r\n     replied, that all he knew was, that before the drainage he could\r\n     never go out at night without a great coat, and that now he could,\r\n     so that he considered it made the difference of a great coat to\r\n     him.\"\r\n\r\n_Drainage increases the coldness of the subsoil in Winter._ Whether this\r\nis a gain or loss to the agriculturist, is not for us to determine. The\r\nobject of our labor is, to lay the whole subject fairly before the\r\nreader, and not to extol drainage as the grand panacea of bad husbandry.\r\n\r\nAlthough water will not conduct heat downwards, yet it doubtless\r\nprevents the deep freezing of the ground. It has already been seen, that\r\nthe temperature of the earth, a few feet below the surface, is above the\r\nfreezing point, at all times. The fact that the ground does not freeze,\r\nusually, even in New England, where every Winter brings weather below\r\nZero, more than four or five feet deep, in the most exposed situations,\r\nshows conclusively the comparatively even temperature of the subsoil.\r\nThe water which flows underground is of this subsoil temperature, and,\r\nin Winter, warms the ground through which it flows. In land thoroughly\r\ndrained, this warm water cannot rise above the drains, and so cannot\r\ndefend the soil from frost.\r\n\r\nDrained land will, undoubtedly, freeze deeper than undrained land, and\r\nthis is a fact to be impressed upon all who lay tiles in a cold climate.\r\nIt is a strong argument for deep drainage. \"Drain deep, or drain not,\"\r\nis a convenient paraphrase of a familiar quotation. How often do we hear\r\nit said, \"My meadow never freezes more than a foot deep; there will\r\nnever be any trouble from frost in that place, if the tiles are no more\r\nthan two feet deep.\" Be assured, brother farmer, that the frost will\r\nfollow the water-table downward, and, unless the warm water move in\r\nsufficient quantity through your pipes to protect them in Winter, your\r\nwork may be ruined by frost. So long as much water is flowing in pipes,\r\nespecially if it be from deep springs, they will be safe from frost,\r\neven at a slight depth.\r\n\r\nDr. Madden says, that it has been proved that one great source of health\r\nand vigor in vegetation, is the great difference which exists between\r\nthe temperature of Summer and Winter, which, he says, in dry soils,\r\noften amounts to between 30° and 40°; while, in very wet soils, it\r\nseldom exceeds 10°. This idea may have value in a mild climate; but,\r\nprobably, in New England, we get cold enough for our good, without\r\nartificial aids. In another view, drainage is known to be essential,\r\neven in Winter.\r\n\r\nFruit trees are almost as surely destroyed by standing with their feet\r\nin cold water all Winter, as any of us \"unfeathered bipeds\" would be;\r\nwhile the solid freezing of the earth around their roots does not harm\r\nthem. Perhaps the same is true of most other vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe deep freezing of the ground is often mentioned as a mode of\r\npulverization--as a sort of natural subsoiling thrown in by a kind\r\nProvidence, by way of compensation for some of the evils of a cold\r\nclimate. Most of those, however, who have wielded the pick-axe in laying\r\nfour-foot drains, in clay or hard-pan, will have doubts whether Jack\r\nFrost, though he can pull up our fence-posts, and throw out our Winter\r\ngrain, has much softened the earth two feet below its surface.\r\n\r\nThat the frost comes out of drained land earlier than undrained, in\r\nSpring, we are satisfied, both by personal observation, and by the\r\nstatements of the few individuals who have practiced thorough-drainage\r\nin our cold climate.\r\n\r\nB. F. Nourse, Esq., whose valuable statement will be found in a later\r\nchapter, says, that, in 1858, the frost came out a week, at least,\r\nearlier from his drained land, in Maine, than from contiguous undrained\r\nland; and that, usually, the drained land is in condition to be worked\r\nas soon as the frost is out, quite two weeks earlier than any other land\r\nin the vicinity. Our observations on our own land, fully corroborate the\r\nopinion of Mr. Nourse.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why the frost should come out of drained land soonest, are,\r\nthat land that is dry does not freeze so solid as land that is wet, and\r\nso spaces are left for the permeation of warm air. Again, ice, like\r\nwater, is almost a nonconductor of heat, and earth saturated with water\r\nand frozen, is like unto it, so that neither the warmth of the subsoil\r\nor surface-soil can be readily imparted to it. Dry earth, on the other\r\nhand, although frozen, is still a good conductor, and readily dissolves\r\nat the first warm breath of Spring above, or the pulsations of the great\r\nheart of Nature beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPOWER OF SOILS TO ABSORB AND RETAIN MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n     Why does not Drainage make the Land too Dry?--Adhesive\r\n     Attraction.--The Finest Soils exert most Attraction.--How much\r\n     Water different Soils hold by Attraction.--Capillary Attraction,\r\n     Illustrated.--Power to Imbibe Moisture from the Air.--Weight\r\n     Absorbed by 1,000 lbs. in 12 Hours.--Dew, Cause of.--Dew\r\n     Point.--Cause of Frost.--Why Covering Plants Protects from\r\n     Frost.--Dew Imparts Warmth.--Idea that the Moon Promotes\r\n     Putrefaction.--Quantity of Dew.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first and most natural objection made, by those not practically\r\nfamiliar with drainage operations, to the whole system is, that the\r\ndrains will draw out so much of the water from the soil, as to leave it\r\ntoo dry for the crops.\r\n\r\nIf a cask be filled with round stones, or with musket balls, or with\r\nlarge shot, and with water to the surface, and then an opening be made\r\nat the bottom of the cask, all the water, except a thin film adhering to\r\nthe surface of the vessel and its contents, will immediately run out.\r\n\r\nIf now, the same cask be filled with the dried soil of any cultivated\r\nfield, and this soil be saturated with water, a part only of the water\r\ncan be drawn out at the bottom. The soil in the cask will remain moist,\r\nretaining more or less of the water, according to the character of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWhy does not the water all run out of the soil, and leave it dry? An\r\nanswer may be found in the books, which is, in reality, but a\r\nre-statement of the fact, by reference to a principle of nature, by no\r\nmeans intelligible to finite minds, called attraction. If two substances\r\nare placed in close contact with each other, they cannot be separated\r\nwithout a certain amount of force.\r\n\r\n     \"If we wet the surfaces of two pieces of glass, and place them in\r\n     contact, we shall find that they adhere to each other, and that,\r\n     independently of the effect of the pressure of the air, they oppose\r\n     considerable resistance to any attempt to separate them. Again, if\r\n     we bring any substance, as the blade of a knife, in contact with\r\n     water, the water adheres to the blade in a thin film, and remains,\r\n     by what is termed _adhesive attraction_. This property resides in\r\n     the surface of bodies, and is in proportion to the extent of its\r\n     surface.\r\n\r\n     \"Soils possess this property, in common with all other bodies, and\r\n     possess it, in a greater or less degree, according to the aggregate\r\n     surface which the particles of a given bulk present. Thus, clay\r\n     may, by means of kneading, be made to contain so large a quantity\r\n     of water, as that, at last, it may almost be supposed to be divided\r\n     into infinitesimally thin layers, having each a film of water\r\n     adhering to it on either side. Such soils, again, as sand or chalk,\r\n     the particles of which are coarser exert a less degree of adhesive\r\n     attraction for water.\"--_Cyc. of Ag._, 695.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schübler, of Tubingen, gives the results of experiments upon\r\nthis point. By dropping water upon dried soils of different kinds, until\r\nit began to drop from the bottom, he found that 100 lbs. of soil held by\r\nattraction, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Sand          25 lbs. of water.\r\n     Loamy Soil    40       \"\r\n     Clay Loam     50       \"\r\n     Pure Clay     70       \"\r\n\r\nMr. Shedd, of Boston, gives the result of a recent experiment of his own\r\non this point. He writes thus:\r\n\r\n     \"I have made an experiment with a soil of ordinary tenacity, to\r\n     ascertain how much water it would hold in suspension, with the\r\n     following result: One cubic foot of earth held 0.4826434 cubic feet\r\n     of water; three feet of dry soil of that character will receive\r\n     1.44793 ft. vertical depth of water before any drains off, or\r\n     seventeen and three-quarter inches, equal to nearly six month's\r\n     rain-fall. One cubic foot of earth held 3.53713 gallons of water,\r\n     or if drains are three feet deep, one square foot of surface would\r\n     receive 10.61 gallons of water, before saturation. Other soils\r\n     would sustain a greater or less quantity, according to their\r\n     character.\"\r\n\r\nBesides this power of retaining water, when brought into contact with\r\nit, the soil has, in common with other porous bodies, the power of\r\ndrawing up moisture, or of absorbing it, independent of gravitation, or\r\nof the weight of the water which aids to carry it down into the soil.\r\nThis power is called _capillary attraction_, from the hair-like tubes\r\nused in early experiments. If very minute tubes, open at both ends, are\r\nplaced upright, partly immersed in a vessel of water, the water rises in\r\nthe tubes perceptibly higher than its general surface in the vessel. A\r\nsponge, from which water has been pressed out, held over a basin of\r\nwater, so that its lower part touches the surface, draws up the water\r\ntill it is saturated. A common flower-pot, with a perforated bottom, and\r\nfilled with dry earth, placed in a saucer of water, best illustrates\r\nthis point. The water rises at once to a common level in the pot and\r\noutside. This represents the water-table in the soil of our fields. But,\r\nfrom this level, water will continue to rise in the earth in the pot,\r\ntill it is moistened to the surface, and this, too, is by capillary\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of water to ascend, however, is not the same in all soils.\r\nIn coarse gravelly soils, the principle may not operate perfectly,\r\nbecause the interstices are too large, the weight of the water\r\novercoming the power of attraction, as in the cask of stones or shot. In\r\nvery fine clay, on the other hand, although it be absorptive and\r\nretentive of water, yet the particles are so fine, and the spaces\r\nbetween them so small, that this attraction, though sure, would be slow\r\nin operation. A loamy, light, well pulverized soil, again, would perhaps\r\nfurnish the best medium for the diffusion of water in this way.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to set limits to so uncertain a power as this of\r\ncapillary attraction. We see that in minute glass tubes, it has power\r\nto raise water a small fraction of an inch only. We see that, in the\r\nsponge or flower-pot, it has power to raise water many inches; and we\r\nknow that, in the soil, moisture is thus attracted upwards several feet.\r\nBy observing a saturated sponge in a saucer, we shall see that, although\r\nmoist at the top, it holds more and more water to the bottom. So, in the\r\nsaturated earth in a flower-pot, the earth, merely moist at the surface,\r\nis wet mud just above the water-table. So, in drained land, the\r\ncapillary force which retained the water in the soil to the height of a\r\nfew inches, is no longer able to sustain it, when the height is\r\nincreased to feet, and a portion descends into the drain, leaving the\r\nsurface comparatively dry.\r\n\r\nThus, it would seem, that draining may modify the force of capillary\r\nattraction, while it cannot affect that of adhesive attraction. It may\r\ndrain off surplus water, but, unaided, can never render any arable land\r\ntoo dry. If, however, the surplus water be speedily taken off by\r\ndrainage, and the capillary attraction be greatly impaired, so that\r\nlittle water is drawn upwards by its force, will not the soil soon\r\nbecome parched by the heat of the sun, or, in other words, by\r\nevaporation?\r\n\r\nWithout stopping in this place, to speak of evaporation, we may answer,\r\nthat, in our burning Summer heat, the earth would be burnt up too dry\r\nfor any vegetation, were it not for a beneficent arrangement of\r\nProvidence, which counteracts the effect of the sun's rays, and of which\r\nwe will now make mention.\r\n\r\n_Power to imbibe moisture from the air._--We have spoken, in another\r\nplace, of the absorption, by drained land, of fertilizing substances\r\nfrom the atmosphere. Dry soil has, too, a wonderful power of deriving\r\nmoisture from the same source.\r\n\r\n     \"When a portion of soil,\" says Johnston, \"is dried carefully over\r\n     boiling water, or in an oven, and is then spread out upon a sheet\r\n     of paper in the open air, it will gradually drink in watery vapor\r\n     from the atmosphere, and will thus increase in weight.\r\n\r\n     \"In hot climates and in dry seasons, this property is of great\r\n     importance, restoring as it does, to the thirsty soil, and bringing\r\n     within the reach of plants, a portion of the moisture, which,\r\n     during the day, they had so copiously exhaled.\"\r\n\r\nDifferent soils possess this power in unequal degrees. During a night of\r\n12 hours, and when the air is moist, according to Schübler, 1000 lbs. of\r\nperfectly dry\r\n\r\n     Quartz sand will gain     0 lbs.\r\n     Calcareous sand           2  \"\r\n     Loamy soil               21  \"\r\n     Clay loam                25  \"\r\n     Pure agricultural clay   27  \"\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Davy found, that the power of attraction for water,\r\ngenerally proved an index to the agricultural value of soils. It is,\r\nhowever, but one means of judging of their value. Peaty soils and strong\r\nclays are very absorbent of water, although not always the best for\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy gives the following results of his experiments. When made\r\nperfectly dry, 1000 lbs. of a\r\n\r\n     Very fertile soil from East Lothian, gained in an hour   18 lbs.\r\n     Very fertile soil from Somersetshire                     16  \"\r\n     Soil, worth 45s., (rent) from Essex                      13  \"\r\n     Sandy soil, worth 28s., from Essex                       11  \"\r\n     Coarse sand, worth 15s.                                   8  \"\r\n     Soil of Bagshot Heath                                     3  \"\r\n\r\n     \"This sort of attraction, however,\" suggests a writer in the\r\n     Cyclopedia of Agriculture, \"it may be believed, depends upon other\r\n     causes besides the attraction of adhesion. The power of attraction,\r\n     which certain substances exhibit for the _vapor_ of water, is more\r\n     akin to the force which enables certain porous bodies to absorb and\r\n     retain many times their volume of the different gases; as charcoal,\r\n     of ammonia, of which it is said to absorb ninety times its own\r\n     bulk.\"\r\n\r\nHere again, we find in the soil, an inexplicable but beneficent power,\r\nby which it supplies itself with moisture when it most needs it.\r\n\r\nWarm air is capable of holding more vapor than cooler air, and the very\r\nheat of Summer supplies it with moisture by evaporation from land and\r\nwater. As the air is cooled, at nightfall, it must somewhere deposit the\r\nwater, which the hand of the Unseen presses out of it by condensation.\r\n\r\nThe sun-dried surface of fertile, well drained soil, is in precisely the\r\ncondition best adapted to receive the refreshing draught, and convey it\r\nto the thirsting plants.\r\n\r\nWe may form some estimate of the vast amount absorbed by an acre of land\r\nin a dry season, by considering that the clay loam, in the above\r\nstatement, absorbed in 12 hours a fortieth part of its own weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF DEW.\r\n\r\nDew is one of the most ordinary forms in which moisture is deposited in\r\nand upon the soil, in its natural conditions. The absorbent power of\r\nartificially-dried soils, as has been seen, seems to depend much upon\r\ntheir chemical constitution; and that topic has been considered, without\r\nspecial reference to the comparative temperature of the soil and\r\natmosphere. The soil, as we have seen, absorbs moisture from the air,\r\nwhen both are of the same temperature, the amount absorbed depending\r\nalso upon the physical condition of the soil, and upon the comparative\r\nmoisture of the soil and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of dew results from a different law. All bodies throw\r\noff, at all times, heat, by radiation, as it is termed. In the day-time,\r\nthe sun's rays warm the earth, and the air is heated by it, and that\r\nnearest the surface is heated most. Evaporation is constantly going on\r\nfrom the earth and water, and loads the air with vapor, and the warmer\r\nthe air, the more vapor it will hold.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun goes down, the earth still continues to throw off heat by\r\nradiation, and soon becomes cooler than the air, unless the same amount\r\nof heat be returned, by radiation from other surfaces. Becoming cooler\r\nthan the air, the soil or plants cool the air which comes in contact\r\nwith them; and thus cooled to a certain point, the air cannot hold all\r\nthe vapor which it absorbed while warmer, and part of it is deposited\r\nupon the soil, plant, or other cool surface. This is dew; and the\r\ntemperature at which the air is saturated with vapor, is called the\r\ndew-point. If saturated at a given temperature with vapor, the air, when\r\ncooled below this point, must part with a portion of the vapor, in some\r\nway; in the form of rain or mist, if in the air; in the form of dew, if\r\non the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf, however, other surfaces, at night, radiate as much heat back to the\r\nearth as it throws off, the surface of the earth is not thus cooled, and\r\nthere is no dew. Clouds radiate heat to the earth, and, therefore, there\r\nis less dew in cloudy than in clear nights. If the temperature of the\r\nearth sinks below the freezing-point, the aqueous vapor is frozen, and\r\nis then called _frost_.\r\n\r\nTo radiate back a portion of the heat thus thrown off by the soil and\r\nplants, gardeners cover their tender plants and vines with mats or\r\nboards, or even with thin cloth, and thus protect them from frost. If\r\nthe covering touch the plants, they are often frozen, the heat being\r\nconducted off, by contact, to the covering, and thence radiated. Dew\r\nthen is an effect, but not a cause, of cold. It imparts warmth, because\r\nit can be deposited only on objects cooler than itself.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by many that the light of the moon promotes\r\nputrefaction. Pliny and Plutarch both affirm this to be true. Dew, by\r\nsupplying moisture in the warm season, aids this process of decay. We\r\nhave seen that dew is most abundant in clear nights; and although all\r\nclear nights are not moonlight nights, yet all moonlight nights are\r\nclear nights; and this, perhaps, furnishes sufficient grounds for this\r\nbelief, as to the influence of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of dew deposited is not easily measured. It has, however,\r\nbeen estimated by Dr. Dalton, to amount, in England, to five inches of\r\nwater in a year, or 500 tons to the acre, equal to about one quarter of\r\nour rain-fall during the six summer months!\r\n\r\nDeep and well-pulverized soils attract much more moisture, in every\r\nform, from the atmosphere, than shallow and compact soils. They, in\r\nfact, expose a much larger surface to the air. This is the reason why\r\nstirring the ground, even in the Summer drought, refreshes our fields of\r\nIndian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nINJURY OF LAND BY DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n     Most Land cannot be Over-drained.--Nature a Deep\r\n     drainer.--Over-draining of Peaty Soils.--Lincolnshire Fens; Visit\r\n     to them in 1857.--56 Bushels of Wheat to the Acre.--Wet Meadows\r\n     subside by Drainage.--Conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there no danger of draining land too much? May not land be\r\nover-drained? These are questions often and very naturally asked, and\r\nwhich deserve careful consideration. The general answer would be that\r\nthere is no danger to be apprehended from over-draining; that no water\r\nwill run out of land that would be of advantage to our cultivated crops\r\nby being retained. In other words, soils _generally_ hold, by capillary\r\nattraction, all the moisture that is of any advantage to the crops\r\ncultivated on them; and the water of drainage would, if retained for\r\nwant of outlets, be stagnant, and produce more evil than good.\r\n\r\nWe say this is generally true; but there are said to be exceptional\r\ncases, which it is proposed to consider. If we bear in mind the\r\ncondition of most soils in Summer, we shall see that this apprehension\r\nof over-draining is groundless. The fear is, that crops will suffer in\r\ntime of drought, if thoroughly drained. Now, we know that, in almost all\r\nNew England, the water-table is many feet below the surface. Our wells\r\nindicate pretty accurately where the water-table is, and drains, unless\r\ncut as low as the surface of the water in the wells, would not run a\r\ndrop of water in Summer.\r\n\r\nOur farmers dig their wells twenty, and even fifty, feet deep, and\r\nexpect that, every Summer, the water will sink to nearly that depth; but\r\nthey have no apprehension that their crops will become dry, because the\r\nwater is not kept up to within three feet of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that Nature drains thoroughly the greater portion of all\r\nour lands; so that artificial drainage, though it may remove surplus\r\nwater from them more speedily in Spring, cannot make them more dry in\r\nSummer. And what thus happens naturally, on most of the land, without\r\ninjury, cannot be a dangerous result to effect by drainage on lands of\r\nsimilar character. By thorough-drainage, we endeavor to make lands which\r\nhave an impervious or very retentive subsoil near the surface,\r\nsufficiently open to allow the surplus water to pass off, as it does\r\nnaturally on our most productive upland.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVER-DRAINING OF PEATY SOILS.\r\n\r\nNo instance has yet been made public in America, of the injury of peat\r\nlands by over-drainage; but there is a general impression among English\r\nwriters, that peat soils are often injured in this way. The Lincolnshire\r\nFens are cited by them, as illustrations of the fact, that these lands\r\ndo not require deep drainage.\r\n\r\nMr. Pusey says, \"Every one who is practically acquainted with moory\r\nland, knows that such land may be easily over-drained, so that the soil\r\nbecomes dusty or _husky_, as it is called--that is, like a dry\r\nsponge--the white crops flag, and the turnip leaves turn yellow in a\r\nlong drought.\"\r\n\r\nThese Fens contain an immense extent of land. The Great Level of the\r\nFens, it is said, contains 600,000 acres. Much of this was formerly\r\ncovered by the tides, and all of it, as the name indicates, was of a\r\nmarshy character. The water being excluded by embankments against the\r\nsea and rivers, and pumped out by steam engines, and the land\r\nunder-drained generally with tiles, so that the height of the water is\r\nunder the control of the proprietors, grave disputes have arisen as to\r\nthe proper amount of drainage.\r\n\r\nAn impression has heretofore prevailed, that these lands would be too\r\ndry if the water were pumped out, so as to reduce the water-table more\r\nthan a foot or two below the surface, but this idea is now controverted.\r\n\r\nIn July 1857, in company with three of the best farmers in Lincolnshire,\r\nthe writer visited the Fens, and carefully examined the crops and\r\ndrainage. We passed a day with one of the proprietors, who gave us some\r\ninformation upon the point in question. He stated, that in general, the\r\noccupants of this land entertain the opinion, that the crops would be\r\nruined by draining to the depth of four feet. So strongly was he\r\nimpressed with the belief that a deeper drainage was desirable, that he\r\nhad enclosed his own estate with separate embankments, and put up a\r\nsteam-engine, and pumped out the water to the depth of four feet, while\r\nfrom the land all around him, it is pumped out only a foot and a half\r\nbelow the surface, though in Summer it may sometimes fall somewhat\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nThe crops on this land were astonishing. Our friends estimated that the\r\nwheat then growing and nearly ripe, would yield fifty-six bushels to the\r\nacre. Although this was considered a very dry season, the crops on the\r\nland of our host were fully equal to the best upon the Fens.\r\n\r\nThe soil upon that part of the Fens is now a fine black loam of twelve\r\nor eighteen inches depth, resting upon clay. Upon other portions, the\r\nsoil is of various depth and character, resting sometimes upon gravel.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to these facts here, to show that the common\r\nimpression that these lands will not bear deep drainage, is controverted\r\namong the occupants themselves, and may prove to be one of those errors\r\nwhich becomes traditional, we hardly know how.\r\n\r\nMost peat meadows, in New England, when first relieved of stagnant\r\nwater, are very light and spongy. The soil is filled with acids which\r\nrequire to be neutralized by an application of lime, or what is cheaper\r\nand equally effectual, by exposure to the atmosphere. These soils, when\r\nthe water is suddenly drawn out of them, retain their bulk for a time,\r\nand are too porous and unsubstantial for cultivation. A season or two\r\nwill cure this evil, in many cases. The soil will become more compact,\r\nand will often settle down many inches. It is necessary to bear this in\r\nmind in adjusting the drains, because a four-foot drain, when laid, may,\r\nby the mere subsidence of the land, become a three-foot drain.\r\n\r\nA hasty judgment, in any case, that the land is over-drained, should be\r\nsuspended until the soil has acquired compactness by its own weight, and\r\nby the ameliorating effect of culture and the elements.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton, alluding to the opinion of \"many intelligent men, that low\r\nmeadow-land should be treated differently to upland pasture, and upland\r\npasture differently to arable land,\" says, \"My own observations bring me\r\nto the conclusion, that it is not possible to lay pasture-land too dry;\r\nfor I have invariably remarked, during the recent dry Summer and Autumn\r\nparticularly, that both in lowland meadows, and upland pastures, those\r\nlands which have been most thoroughly drained by deep and frequent\r\ndrains, are those that have preserved the freshest and most profitable\r\nherbage.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, we have much doubt whether any land, high or low, can\r\nbe over-drained for general cultivation, it is probable that a less\r\nexpensive mode of drainage may be sometimes expedient for grass alone.\r\n\r\nWhile we believe that, in general, even peat soils may be safely drained\r\nto the same depth with other soil, there seems to be a well-founded\r\nopinion that they may frequently be rendered productive by a less\r\nthorough system.\r\n\r\nThe only safety for us, is in careful experiment with our own lands,\r\nwhich vary so much in character and location, that no precise rules can\r\nbe prescribed for their treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION OF DRAINS.\r\n\r\n     Tiles will fill up, unless well laid.--Obstruction by Sand or\r\n     Silt.--Obstructions at the Outlet from Frogs, Moles, Action of\r\n     Frost, and Cattle.--Obstruction by Roots.--Willow, Ash, &c., Trees\r\n     capricious.--Roots enter Perennial Streams.--Obstruction by Mangold\r\n     Wurtzel.--Obstruction by Per-Oxide of Iron.--How\r\n     Prevented--Obstruction by the Joints Filling.--No Danger with\r\n     Two-Inch Pipes.--Water through the Pores.--Collars.--How to Detect\r\n     Obstructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut won't these tiles get filled up and stopped? asks almost every\r\ninquirer on the subject of tile draining.\r\n\r\nCertainly, they will, if not laid with great care, and with all proper\r\nprecautions against obstructions. It cannot be too often repeated, that\r\ntile-drainage requires science, and knowledge, and skill, as well as\r\nmoney; and no man should go into it blindfold, or with faith in his\r\ninnate perceptions of right. If he does, his education will be\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to mention all the various modes by which tiles have been\r\nknown to be obstructed, and to suggest how the danger of failure, by\r\nmeans of them, may be obviated.\r\n\r\nLet not enterprising readers be alarmed at such an array of\r\ndifficulties, for the more conspicuous they become, the less is the\r\ndanger from them.\r\n\r\n_Obstruction by Sand or Silt._ Probably, more drains are rendered\r\nworthless, by being filled up with earthy matter, which passes with\r\nwater through the joints of the tiles, than by every other cause.\r\n\r\nFine sand will pass through the smallest aperture, if there is a current\r\nof water sufficient to move it, and silt, or the fine deposit of mud or\r\nother earth, which is held almost in solution in running water, is even\r\nmore insinuating in its ways than sand.\r\n\r\nVery often, drains are filled up and ruined by these deposits; and,\r\nunless the fall be considerable, and the drain be laid with even\r\ndescent, if earth of any kind find entrance, it must endanger the\r\npermanency of the work. To guard against the admission of everything but\r\nwater, lay drains deep enough to be beyond the danger of water bursting\r\nin, in streamlets. Water should enter the drain at the bottom, by rising\r\nto the level of the tiles, and not by sinking from the surface directly\r\nto them. If the land is sandy, great care must be used. In draining\r\nthrough flowing sand, especially if there be a quick descent, the\r\nprecaution of sheathing tiles is resorted to. That is done by putting\r\nsmall tiles inside of larger ones, breaking joints inside, and thus\r\nlaying a double drain. This is only necessary, however, in spots of sand\r\nfull of spring-water. Next best to this mode, is the use of collars over\r\nthe joints, but these are not often used, though recommended for sandy\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAt least, in all land not perfectly sound, be careful to secure the\r\njoints in some way. An inverted turf, carefully laid over the joint, is\r\noftenest used. Good, clean, fine gravel is, perhaps, best of all. Spent\r\ntan bark, when it is to be conveniently procured, is excellent, because\r\nit strains out the earth, while it freely admits water; and any\r\nparticles of tan that find entrance, are floated out upon the water. The\r\nsame may be said of sawdust.\r\n\r\nTo secure the exit of earth that may enter at the joints, there should\r\nbe care that the tiles be smooth inside, that they be laid exactly in\r\nline, and that there be a continuous descent. If there be any place\r\nwhere the water rises in the tiles, in that place, every particle of\r\nsand, or other matter heavier than water, will be likely to stop, until\r\na barrier is formed, and the drain stopped.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the forms of tiles, the superiority of rounded openings\r\nover those with flat bottom has been shown. The greater head of water in\r\na round pipe, gives it force to drive before it all obstructions, and so\r\ntends to keep the drain clear.\r\n\r\n_Obstructions at the Outlet._ The water from deep drains is usually very\r\nclear, and cattle find the outlet a convenient place to drink at, and\r\nconstantly tread up the soft ground there, and obstruct the flow of\r\nwater. All earthy matter, and chemical solutions of iron, and the like,\r\ntend to accumulate by deposit at the outlet. Frogs and mice, and insects\r\nof many kinds, collect about such places, and creep into the drains. The\r\naction of frost in cold regions displaces the earth, and even masonry,\r\nif not well laid; and back-water, by flowing into the drains, hinders\r\nthe free passage of water.\r\n\r\nAll these causes tend to obstruct drains at the outlet. If once stopped\r\nthere, the whole pipe becomes filled with stagnant water, which deposits\r\nall its earthy matter, and soon becomes obstructed at other points, and\r\nso becomes useless. The outlet must be rendered secure from all these\r\ndangers, at all seasons, by some such means as are suggested in the\r\nchapter on the Arrangement of Drains.\r\n\r\n_Obstruction by roots._ On the author's farm in Exeter, a wooden drain,\r\nto carry off waste water from a watering place, was laid, with a\r\ntriangular opening of about four inches. This was found to be obstructed\r\nthe second year after it was laid; and upon taking it up, it proved to\r\nbe entirely filled for several feet, with willow roots, which grew like\r\nlong, fine grass, thickly matted together, so as entirely to close the\r\ndrain. There was a row of large willows about thirty feet distant, and\r\nas the drain was but about two feet deep, they found their way easily\r\nto it, and entering between the rough joints of the boards, not very\r\ncarefully fitted, fattened on the spring water till they outgrew their\r\nnew house.\r\n\r\nA neighbor says, he never wants a tree within ten rods of any land he\r\ndesires to plow; and it would be unsafe to undertake to set limits to\r\nthe extent of the roots of trees. \"No crevice, however small,\" says a\r\nwriter, \"is proof against the entrance of the roots of water-loving\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\nThe behavior of roots is, however, very capricious in this matter; for,\r\nwhile occasional instances occur of drains being obstructed by them, it\r\nis a very common thing for drains to operate perfectly for indefinite\r\nperiods, where they run through forests and orchards for long distances.\r\nThey, however, who lay drains near to willows and ashes, and the like\r\ncold-water drinkers, must do it at the peril of which they are warned.\r\n\r\nLaying the tiles deep and with collars will afford the best security\r\nfrom all danger of this kind.\r\n\r\nThos. Gisborne, Esq., in a note to the edition of his Essay on Drainage\r\npublished in 1852, says:\r\n\r\n     My own experience as to roots, in connection with deep pipe\r\n     draining, is as follows:--I have never known roots to obstruct a\r\n     pipe through which there was not a perennial stream. The flow of\r\n     water in Summer and early Autumn appears to furnish the attraction.\r\n     I have never discovered that the roots of any esculent vegetable\r\n     have obstructed a pipe. The trees which, by my own personal\r\n     observation, I have found to be most dangerous, have been red\r\n     willow, black Italian poplar, alder, ash, and broad-leaved elm. I\r\n     have many alders in close contiguity with important drains; and,\r\n     though I have never convicted one, I can not doubt that they are\r\n     dangerous. Oak, and black and white thorns, I have not detected,\r\n     nor do I suspect them. The guilty trees have, in every instance,\r\n     been young and free growing; I have never convicted an adult.\r\n\r\nMangold-wurzel, it is said by several writers, will sometimes grow down\r\ninto tile drains, even to the depth of four feet, and entirely obstruct\r\nthem; but those are cases of very rare occurrence. In thousands of\r\ninstances, mangolds have been cultivated on drained land, even where\r\ntiles were but 2-1/2 feet deep, without causing any obstruction of the\r\ndrains. Any reader who is curious in such matters, may find in the\r\nappendix to the 10th Vol. of the Journal of the Royal Ag. Soc., a\r\nsingular instance of obstruction of drains by the roots of the mangold,\r\nas well as instances of obstructions by the roots of trees.\r\n\r\n_Obstruction by Per-oxide of Iron._ In the author's barn-cellar is a\r\nwatering place, supplied by a half-inch lead pipe, from a spring some\r\neight rods distant. This pipe several times in a year, sometimes once a\r\nweek, in cold weather, is entirely stopped. The stream of water is never\r\nmuch larger than a lead pencil. We usually start it with a sort of\r\nsyringe, by forcing into the outlet a quantity of water. It then runs\r\nvery thick, and of the color of iron rust, sometimes several pails full,\r\nand will then run clear for weeks or months, perhaps. In the tub which\r\nreceives the water, there is always a large deposit of this same colored\r\nsubstance; and along the street near by, where the water oozes out of\r\nthe bank, there is this same appearance of iron. This deposit is, in\r\ncommon language, called per-oxide of iron, though this term is not, by\r\nchemists of the present day, deemed sufficiently accurate, and the word\r\nsesqui-oxide is preferred in scientific works.\r\n\r\nIron exists in all animal and vegetable matter, and in all soils, to\r\nsome extent. It exists as protoxide of iron, in which one atom of iron\r\nalways combines with one atom of oxygen, and it exists as sesqui-oxide\r\nof iron, from the Latin _sesqui_, which means one and a half, in which\r\none and a half atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of iron. The less\r\naccurate term, per-oxide, has been adopted here, because it is found in\r\ngeneral use by writers on drainage.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that the iron exists in the soil, and is held in solution\r\nin water as a protoxide, and is converted into per-oxide by contact with\r\nthe air, either in the drains or at their outlets, and is then deposited\r\nat the bottom of the water.\r\n\r\nIn a pipe running full there would be, upon this theory, no exposure to\r\nthe air, which should form the per-oxide. In the case stated, it is\r\nprobable that the per-oxide is formed at the exposed surface of a large\r\ncask, at the spring, and is carried into the pipe, as it is\r\nprecipitated. Common drain pipes would be full of air, which might,\r\nperhaps, in a feeble current, be sufficient to cause this deposit.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, cases have occurred of obstruction from this cause, and\r\nwhenever the signs of this deposit are visible about the field to be\r\ndrained, care must be used to guard against it in draining.\r\n\r\nTo guard against obstruction from per-oxide of iron, tiles should be\r\nlaid deep, closely jointed or collared, with great care that the fall be\r\ncontinuous, and especially that there be a quick fall at the junctions\r\nof minor drains with mains, and a clear outlet.\r\n\r\nMr. Beattie, of Aberdeen, says: Before adopting 4 feet drains, I had\r\nmuch difficulty in dealing with the iron ore which generally appeared at\r\ntwo to three feet from the surface, but by the extra depth the water\r\nfilters off to the pipes free of ore. Occasionally, iron ore is found at\r\na greater depth, but the floating substance is then in most cases\r\nlighter, and does not adhere to the pipes in the same way as that found\r\nnear the surface. Arrangements should also be made for examining the\r\ndrains by means of wells, and for flushing them by holding back the\r\nwater until the drains are filled, and then letting it suddenly off, or,\r\nby occasionally admitting a stream of water at the upper end, when\r\npracticable, and thus washing out the pipes. Mr. Denton says: \"It is\r\nfound that the use of this contrivance for flushing, will get rid of\r\nthe per-oxide of iron, about which so much complaint is made.\"\r\n\r\n_Obstruction by Filling at the Joints._ One would suppose that tiles\r\nmight frequently be prevented from receiving water, by the filling up of\r\nthe crevices between them. If water poured on to tiles in a stream, it\r\nwould be likely to carry into these openings enough earthy matter to\r\nfill them; but the whole theory of thorough-drainage rests upon the idea\r\nof slow percolation--of the passage of water in the form of fine dew, as\r\nit were--through the motionless particles which compose the soil; and,\r\nif drains are properly laid, there can be no motion of particles of\r\nearth, either into or towards the tiles. The water should soak through\r\nthe ground precisely as it does through a wet cloth.\r\n\r\nIn an article in the Journal of the Society of Arts, published in 1855,\r\nMr. Thomas Arkell states that in 1846 he had drained a few acres with\r\n1-1/4 inch pipes, about three feet deep, and 21 to 25 feet apart. The\r\ndrains acted well, and the land was tolerably dry and healthy for the\r\nfirst few years; but afterwards, in wet seasons, it was very wet, and\r\nappeared full of water, like undrained land, although at the time all\r\nthe drains were running, but very slowly. His conclusion was that mud\r\nhad entered the crevices, and stopped the water out. He says he has\r\nknown other persons, who had used small pipes, who had suffered in the\r\nsame way. There are many persons still in England, who are so\r\napprehensive on this point, that they continue to use horse-shoe tiles,\r\nor, as they are sometimes called, \"tops and bottoms,\" which admit water\r\nmore freely along the joints.\r\n\r\nThe most skillful engineers, however, decidedly prefer round pipes, but\r\nrecommend that none smaller than one-and-a-half-inch be used, and prefer\r\ntwo-inch to any smaller size. The circumference of a two-inch pipe is\r\nnot far from nine inches, while that of a one-inch pipe, of common\r\nthickness, is about half that, so that the opening is twice as extensive\r\nin the two-inch, pipes as in the one-inch pipe.\r\n\r\nThe ascertained instances of the obstruction of pipes, by excluding the\r\nwater from the joints, are very few. No doubt that clay, puddled in upon\r\nthe tiles when laid, might have this effect; but they who have\r\nexperience in tile-drainage, will bear witness that there is far more\r\ndifficulty in excluding sand and mud, than there is in admitting water.\r\n\r\nIt is thought, by some persons, that sufficient water to drain land may\r\nbe admitted through the pores of the tiles. We have no such faith. The\r\nopinion of Mr. Parkes, that about 500 times as much water enters at the\r\ncrevices between each pair of tiles, as is absorbed through the tiles\r\nthemselves, we think to be far nearer the truth.\r\n\r\nCollars have a great tendency to prevent the closing up of the crevices\r\nbetween tiles; but injuries to drains laid at proper depths, with\r\ntwo-inch pipes, even without collars, must be very rare. Indeed, no\r\nsingle case of a drain obstructed in this way, when laid four feet deep,\r\nhas yet come within our reading or observation, and it is rather as a\r\npossible, than even a probable, cause of failure, that it has been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETECT OBSTRUCTIONS IN DRAINS.\r\n\r\nWhen a drain is entirely obstructed, if there is a considerable flow of\r\nwater, and the ground is much descending, the water will at once press\r\nthrough the joints of the pipes, and show itself at the surface. By\r\nthrusting down a bar along the course of the drain, the place of the\r\nobstruction will be readily determined; for the water will, at the point\r\nof greatest pressure, burst up in the hole made by the bar, like a\r\nspring, while below the point of obstruction, there will be no upward\r\npressure of the water, and above it, the pressure will be less the\r\nfarther we go.\r\n\r\nThe point being determined, it is the work of but few minutes to dig\r\ndown upon the drain, remove carefully a few pipes, and take out the\r\nfrog, or mouse, or the broken tile, if such be the cause of the\r\ndifficulty. If silt or earth has caused the obstruction, it is probably\r\nbecause of a depression in the line of the drain, or a defect in some\r\njunction with other drains, and this may require the taking up of more\r\nor less of the pipes.\r\n\r\nIf there be but little fall in the drains, the obstruction will not be\r\nso readily found; but the effect of the water will soon be observed at\r\nthe surface, both in keeping the soil wet, and in chilling the\r\nvegetation upon it. If proper peep-holes have been provided, the place\r\nof any obstruction may readily be determined, at a glance into them.\r\n\r\nUpon our own land, we have had two or three instances of obstruction by\r\nsand, very soon after the tiles were laid, and always at the junction of\r\ndrains imperfectly secured with bricks, before we had procured proper\r\nbranch-pipes for the purpose.\r\n\r\nA little experience will enable the proprietor at once to detect any\r\nfailure of his drains, and to apply the proper remedy. Obstructions from\r\nsilt and sand are much more likely to occur during the first season\r\nafter the drains are laid, than afterwards, because the earth is loose\r\nabout the pipes, and more liable to be washed into the joints, than\r\nafter it has become compact.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we believe the danger to tile-drains, of obstruction, is\r\nvery little, provided good tiles are used, and proper care is exercised\r\nin laying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF STIFF CLAYS.\r\n\r\n     Clay not impervious, or it could not be wet and dried.--Puddling,\r\n     what is.--Water will stand over Drains on Puddled Soil.--Cracking\r\n     of Clays by Drying.--Drained Clays improve by time.--Passage of\r\n     Water through Clay makes it permeable.--Experiment by Mr.\r\n     Pettibone, of Vermont.--Pressure of Water in saturated Soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common impression that clay is impervious to water, and that,\r\ntherefore, a clay soil cannot be drained, especially by deep\r\nunder-drains. A moment's reflection will satisfy any one that such land\r\nis not absolutely impervious. We find such land is wet in Spring, at any\r\ndepth; and, in the latter part of Summer, we find it comparatively dry.\r\nHow comes it wet, at any time, if water does not go into it? And how\r\ncomes it dry, at any time, if water does not come out of it?\r\n\r\nIn treating of the power of the soil to absorb moisture, we have shown\r\nthat a clay soil will absorb more than half its weight and bulk of\r\nwater, and that it holds more water than any other soil, with, perhaps,\r\nthe single exception of peat.\r\n\r\nThe facts, however, that clay may be wet, and may be dried, and that it\r\nreadily absorbs large quantities of water, though they prove\r\nconclusively that it is not impervious to water, yet do not prove that\r\nwater will pass through it with sufficient rapidity to answer the\r\npractical purposes of drainage for agriculture. This point can only be\r\nsatisfactorily determined by experiment. It is not necessary, however,\r\nthat each farmer should try the experiment for himself; because,\r\nalthough we are very apt to think our own case an exception to all\r\ngeneral rules, it is not really probable that any new kind of clay will\r\nbe discovered hereafter, that is so different from all other clay that\r\nis known, that established principles will not apply to it. So far as\r\nour own observation extends, owners of clay farms always over-estimate\r\nthe difficulty of draining their land. There are certain notorious facts\r\nwith regard to clay, which mislead the judgment of men on this point.\r\nOne of these facts is, that clay is used for stopping water, by the\r\nprocess called _puddling_. Puddled clay is used for the bottom of ponds,\r\nand of canals, and of reservoirs, and, for such purposes, is regarded as\r\nnearly, or quite impervious.\r\n\r\nWe see that, on our clay fields, water stands upon the surface,\r\nespecially in the ruts of wheels, and on headlands much trodden, late in\r\nthe season, and when, in other places, it has disappeared. This is due,\r\nalso, to puddling.\r\n\r\nPuddling is merely the working of wet clay, or other soil, by beating,\r\nor treading, or stirring, until its particles are so finely divided that\r\nwater has an exceedingly slow passage between them, with ordinary\r\npressure. We see the effect of this operation on common highways, where\r\nwater often stands for many days in puddles, because the surface has\r\nbeen ground so fine, and rendered so compact, by wheels and horses, that\r\nthe water cannot find passage. This, however, is not the natural\r\ncondition of any clay; nor can any clay be kept in this condition,\r\nexcept by being constantly wet. If once dried, or subjected to the\r\naction of frost, the soil resumes its natural condition of porosity, as\r\nwill be presently explained. They who object to deep drainage, or to the\r\npossibility of draining stiff clays, point to the fact that water may be\r\nseen standing directly over the drains, on thorough-drained fields. We\r\nhave seen this on our own fields. In one instance, we had, after laying\r\ntiles through a field, at 50 feet intervals, in the same Autumn, when\r\nthe land was wet, teamed across it a large quantity of soil for compost,\r\nwith a heavy ox-team. The next Spring, the water stood for many days in\r\nthat track which passed across tile-drains, after it had disappeared\r\nelsewhere in the field. A fine crop of Indian corn grew on the field\r\nthat year, but the effect of the puddling was visible the whole season.\r\n\"One inch of wet and worked clay,\" says a scientific writer, \"will\r\nprevent water from passing through, so long as it is kept wet, as\r\neffectually as a yard will do.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If,\" says Gisborne, \"you eat off turnips with sheep, if you plow\r\n     the land, or cart on it, or in any way puddle it, when it is wet,\r\n     of course the water will lie on the surface, and will not go to\r\n     your drains. A four-foot drain may go very near a pit, or a\r\n     water-course, without attracting water from either, because\r\n     water-courses almost invariably puddle their beds; and the same\r\n     effect is produced in pits by the treading of cattle, and even by\r\n     the motion of the water produced by wind. A very thin film of\r\n     puddle, always wet on one side, is impervious, _because it cannot\r\n     crack_.\"\r\n\r\nIn those four words, we find an allusion to the whole mystery of the\r\ndrainage of clays--a key which unlocks the secret by which the toughest\r\nof these soils may be converted, as by a fairy charm, to fields of\r\nwaving grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKING OF CLAYS BY DRYING.\r\n\r\n\"In drying under the influence of the sun,\" says Prof. Johnston, \"soils\r\nshrink in, and thus diminish in bulk, in proportion to the quantity of\r\nclay, or of peaty matter, they contain. Sand scarcely diminishes at all\r\nin bulk by drying; but peat shrinks one-fifth in bulk, and strong\r\nagricultural clay nearly as much.\" By laying drains in land, we take\r\nfrom it that portion of the water that will run out at the bottom. The\r\nsun, by evaporation, then takes out a portion at the top. The soil is\r\nthus contracted, and, as the ends of the field cannot approach each\r\nother, both soil and subsoil are torn apart, and divided by a network\r\nof cracks and fissures. Every one who is familiar with clay land, or who\r\nhas observed the bottom of a ditch or frog pond by the roadside, must\r\nhave observed these cracks, thus caused by the contraction of the soil\r\nin drying. The same contraction occurs in drier land, by cold, in\r\nWinter; by which, in cold regions, deep rents are made in the earth, and\r\nreports, like those of cannon, are often heard. The cracking by drying,\r\nhowever, is more quiet in its effects, merely dividing the ground,\r\nnoiselessly, into smaller and smaller masses, as the process proceeds.\r\nWere it not for this process, it may well be doubted whether clay lands\r\ncould be effectually drained at all. Nature, however, seems to second\r\nour efforts here, for we have seen that the stiffer the clay, the\r\ngreater the contraction, and the more the soil is split up and rendered\r\npermeable by this operation.\r\n\r\nThese cracks are found, by observation, to commence at the drains, and\r\nextend further and further, in almost straight lines, into the subsoil,\r\nforming so many minor drains, or feeders, all leading to the tiles.\r\nThese main fissures have numerous smaller ones diverging from them, so\r\nthat the whole mass is divided and subdivided into the most minute\r\nportions. The main fissures gradually enlarge, as the dryness increases,\r\nand, at the same time, lengthen out; so that, in a very dry season, they\r\nmay be traced the whole way between the drains. The following cut will\r\ngive some idea of these cracks, or fissures, as they exist in a dry\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Cracking of Clays by Drainage.]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gisborne says: \"Clay lands always shrink and crack with\r\n     drought; and the stiffer the clay, the greater the shrinking, as\r\n     brick-makers well know. In the great drought thirty-six years ago,\r\n     we saw, in a very retentive soil in the Vale of Belvoir, cracks\r\n     which it was not very pleasant to ride among. This very Summer, on\r\n     land, which, with reference to this very subject, the owner stated\r\n     to be impervious, we put a walking-stick three feet into a\r\n     sun-crack without finding a bottom, and the whole surface was a\r\n     network of cracks. In the drained soil, the roots follow the\r\n     threads of vegetable mould which have been washed into the cracks,\r\n     and get an abiding tenure. Earth-worms follow either the roots or\r\n     the mould. Permanent schisms are established in the clay, and its\r\n     whole character is changed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the supply of rain is far less uniform than in\r\nEngland, and much severer droughts are experienced. Thus the\r\ncontraction, and consequent cracking of the soil, must be greater here\r\nthan in that country.\r\n\r\nIn laying drains more than four feet deep, in the stiffest clay which\r\nthe author has seen, in a neighborhood furnishing abundance of brick and\r\npotter's clay, these cracks were seen to extend to the very bottoms of\r\nthe drains, not in single fissures from top to bottom, but in\r\ninnumerable seams running in all directions, so that the earth, moved\r\nwith the pick-axe, came up in little cubes and flakes, and could be\r\nseparated into pieces of an inch or less diameter. This was on a ridge\r\nwhich received no water except from the clouds, having no springs in or\r\nupon it, yet so nearly impervious to water, that it remained soft and\r\nmuddy till late in June. In Midsummer, however, under our burning sun,\r\nit had, by evaporation, been so much dried as to produce the effect\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n     In England, we learn, that these cracks extend to the depth of four\r\n     feet or more. Mr. Hewitt Davis stated in a public discussion, with\r\n     reference to draining strong soils, that, \"he gave four feet as the\r\n     minimum depth of the drains in these soils, because he had always\r\n     found that the cracks and fissures formed by the drought and\r\n     changes of temperature, on the strongest clay, and which made these\r\n     soils permeable, extended below this depth, and the water from the\r\n     surface might be made to reach the drains at this distance.\"\r\n\r\nIn clay that has never been dried, as for instance, that found under wet\r\nmeadows from which the water has but recently been drawn, we should not,\r\nof course, expect to find these cracks. Accordingly, we find sometimes\r\nin clay pits, excavated below the permanent water-line, and in wells,\r\nthat the clay is in a compact mass, and tears apart without exhibiting\r\nanything like these divisions.\r\n\r\nWe should not expect that, on such a clay, the full effect of drainage\r\nwould be at once apparent. The water falling on the surface would very\r\nslowly find its way downward, at first. But after the heat of Summer,\r\naided by the drains underneath, had contracted and cracked the soil,\r\npassages for the water would soon be found, and, after a few years, the\r\nwhole mass, to the depth of the drains, would become open and permeable.\r\nAs an old English farmer said of his drains, \"They do better year by\r\nyear; the water gets a habit of coming to them.\" Although this be not\r\nphilosophical language, yet the fact is correctly stated. Water tends\r\ntowards the lowest openings. A deep well often diverts the underground\r\nstream from a shallower well, and lays it dry. A single railroad cut\r\nsometimes draws off the supply of water from a whole neighborhood.\r\nPassages thus formed are enlarged by the pressure of the water, and new\r\nones are opened by the causes already suggested, till the drainage\r\nbecomes perfect for all practical purposes. So much is this cracking\r\nprocess relied on to facilitate drainage, that skillful drainers\r\nfrequently leave their ditches partly open, after laying the tiles, that\r\nthe heat may produce the more effect during the first season.\r\n\r\nAs to the depth of drains in stiff clays, enough has already been said,\r\nunder the appropriate title. In England, the weight of authority is in\r\nfavor of four-foot drains. In this country, a less depth has thus far,\r\nin general, been adopted in practice, but it is believed that this has\r\nbeen because a greater depth has not been tried. It is understood, that\r\nthe most successful drainers in the State of New York, have been\r\nsatisfied with three-foot drains, not, as it is believed, because there\r\nis any instance on record, in this country, of the failure of four-foot\r\ndrains, but because the effect of more shallow drains has been so\r\nsatisfactory, that it has been thought a useless expense to go deeper.\r\nTo Mr. Johnston and to Mr. Delafield, of Seneca County, the country is\r\ngreatly indebted for their enterprise and leadership in the matter of\r\ndrainage. Mr. Johnston gives it as his opinion, that \"three feet is deep\r\nenough, if the bottom is hard enough to lay tiles on; if not, go\r\ndeeper.\"\r\n\r\nWithout intimating that any different mode of drainage than that\r\nadopted, would have been better on Mr. Johnston's farm, we should be\r\nunwilling to surrender, even to the opinion of Mr. Johnston and his\r\nfriends, our conviction that, in general, three-foot drains are too\r\nshallow. Mr. Johnston expressly disclaims any experience in draining a\r\nproper clay soil. In the _Country Gentleman_, of June 10th, 1848, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"In a subsoil that is impervious to water, either by being a red\r\n     clay, blue clay, or hard-pan, within a foot of the surface, I would\r\n     recommend farmers to feel their way very cautiously in draining. If\r\n     tiles and labor were as low here as in Great Britain, we could\r\n     afford to make drains sixteen feet apart in such land, and then, by\r\n     loosening the soil, say twenty inches deep, by the subsoil plow, I\r\n     think such land might be made perfectly dry; but I don't think the\r\n     time is yet come, considering the cost of tiles and labor, to\r\n     undertake such an outlay; but still it might pay _in the end_. I\r\n     have found only a little of red clay subsoil in draining my farm. I\r\n     never had any blue clay on my farm, or hard-pan, to trouble me; but\r\n     I can readily perceive that it must be equally bad to drain as the\r\n     tenacious red clay. If I were going to purchase another farm, I\r\n     would look a great deal more to the subsoil than the surface soil.\r\n     If the subsoil is right, the surface soil, I think, cannot be\r\n     wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same paper, under date of July 8th, Mr. Johnston says, \"The only\r\nexperience I have had in digging into soils, to judge of draining out of\r\nthis county (Seneca), was in Niagara.\" He states the result of his\r\nobservations thus:\r\n\r\n     \"A few inches below the surface I found a stiff blue clay for about\r\n     ten inches deep, and as impervious to water as so much iron.\r\n     Underneath that blue clay, I found a red clay, apparently\r\n     impervious to water; but, as water could not get through the blue,\r\n     I could only guess at that; and, after spending the greater part of\r\n     the day, with five men digging holes from four to five feet deep, I\r\n     found I knew no more how such land could be drained, than a man who\r\n     had never seen a drain dug. I advised the gentleman to try a few\r\n     experiments, by digging a few ditches, as I laid them out, and\r\n     plowing as deep as possible with a subsoil plow, but to get no tile\r\n     until he saw if he could get a run of water. He paid my traveling\r\n     expenses, treated me very kindly and I have heard nothing from him\r\n     since.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, if your correspondent's soil and subsoil is similar to that\r\n     soil I would advise him to feel his way cautiously in draining.\r\n     Certainly, no man would be fool enough to dig ditches and lay tile,\r\n     if there is no water to carry off.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Country Gentleman_ of Nov. 18th, 1858, we find an interesting\r\nstatement, by John S. Pettibone, of Manchester, Vermont, partly in reply\r\nto the statement of Mr. Johnston.\r\n\r\nThe experiment by Mr. Pettibone, showing the increased permeability of\r\nclay, merely by the passage of water through it, is very interesting. He\r\nsays, in his letter to the editor:\r\n\r\n     \"When so experienced a drainer as Mr. Johnston expresses an opinion\r\n     that some soils cannot be drained, it is important we should know\r\n     what the soil is which cannot be drained. He uses the word _stiff\r\n     blue_ clay, as descriptive of the soil which cannot be drained. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"I had taken a specimen of what I thought to be _stiff blue clay_.\r\n     That clay, when wet, as taken out, would hold water about as well\r\n     as iron: yet, from experiments I have made, I am confident that\r\n     such clay soil can be drained, and at much less expense than a\r\n     hard-pan soil. Water will pass through such clay, and the clay\r\n     become dry; and after it becomes once dry, water will, I am\r\n     convinced, readily pass down through such stiff blue clay. The\r\n     specimen was taken about three feet below the surface, and on a\r\n     level with a brook which runs through this clay soil. I filled a\r\n     one hundred-pound nail-keg with clay taken from the same place. It\r\n     was so wet, that by shaking, it came to a level, and water rose to\r\n     the top of the clay. I had made holes in the bottom of the keg, and\r\n     set it up on blocks. After twenty-four hours I came almost to the\r\n     conclusion Mr. Johnston did, that water would not pass through this\r\n     clay. This trial was during the hot, dry weather last Summer. After\r\n     some ten or twelve days the clay appeared to be dry. I then made a\r\n     basin-like excavation in the top of the clay, and put water in, and\r\n     the water disappeared rather slowly. I filled the basin with water\r\n     frequently, and the oftener I filled it, the more readily it passed\r\n     off. I left it for more than a week, when we had a heavy shower.\r\n     After the shower I examined the keg, and not a drop of water was to\r\n     be seen. I then took a chisel and cut a hole six inches down. I\r\n     took out a piece like the one I dried in the house, and laid that\r\n     up till it was perfectly dry. There was a plain difference between\r\n     the appearance of the two pieces. The texture, I should say, was\r\n     quite different. That through which the water had passed, after it\r\n     had been dried, was more open and porous. It did not possess so\r\n     much of the blue cast. In less than one hour after the rain fell,\r\n     the clay taken six inches from the top of the keg would crumble by\r\n     rubbing in the hand.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we observe the effect of heat in opening clays to water by\r\ncracking, and the effect of the water itself, aided, as it doubtless is,\r\nby the action of the air, in rendering the soil permeable, we hardly\r\nneed feel discouraged if the question rested entirely on this evidence;\r\nbut when we consider that thousands upon thousands of acres of the\r\nstiffest clays have been, in England and Scotland, rescued from utter\r\nbarrenness by drainage, and made to yield the largest crops, we should\r\nregard the question of practicability as settled. The only question left\r\nfor decision is whether, under all the circumstances of each\r\nparticular case, the operation of draining our clay lands will be\r\nexpedient--whether their increased value will pay the expense. It is\r\noften objected to deep drains in clays, that it is so far down to the\r\ndrains that the water cannot readily pass through so large a mass. If\r\nwe think merely of a drop of rain falling on the surface, and obliged to\r\nfind its devious way through the mazes of cracks and particles till it\r\ngains an outlet at the bottom of four feet of clay, it does seem a\r\ndiscouraging journey for the poor little solitary thing; but there is a\r\nmore correct view of the matter, which somewhat relieves the difficulty.\r\n\r\nAll the water that will run out of the soil has departed; but the soil\r\nholds a vast amount still, by attraction. The rain begins to fall; and\r\nwhen the soil is saturated, a portion passes into the drain; but it is,\r\nby no means, the water which last fell upon the surface, but that which\r\nwas next the drain before the rain fell. If you pour water into a tube\r\nthat is nearly full, the water which will first run from the other end\r\nis manifestly not that which you pour in. So the ground is full of\r\nlittle tubes, open at both ends, in which the water is held by\r\nattraction. A drop upon the surface drives out a drop at the lower end,\r\ninto to the drain, and so the process goes on--the drains beginning to\r\nrun as soon as the rain commences, and ceasing to flow only when the\r\nprinciple of attraction balances the power of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE OF WATER IN THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the passage of water through clay soil, it may be\r\nappropriate to advert to the question sometimes mooted, whether in a\r\nsoil filled with water, at four feet depth, there is the same pressure\r\nas there would be, at the same depth, in a river or pond. The pressure\r\nof fluids on a given area, is, ordinarily, in proportion to their\r\nvertical height; and the pressure of a column of water, four feet high,\r\nwould be sufficient to drive the lower particles into an opening like a\r\ndrain, with considerable force, and the upper part of such a column\r\nwould essentially aid the lower part in its downward passage. Does this\r\npressure exist? Mr. Gisborne speaks undoubtingly on this point, thus:\r\n\r\n     \"We will assume the drain to be four feet deep, and the water-table\r\n     to be at one foot below the surface of the earth. Every particle of\r\n     water which lies at three feet below the water-table, has on it the\r\n     pressure of a column of water three feet high. This pressure will\r\n     drive the particle in any direction in which it finds no\r\n     resistance, with a rapidity varying inversely to the friction of\r\n     the medium through which the column acts. The bottom of our drains\r\n     will offer no resistance, and into it particles of water will be\r\n     pushed, in conformity with the rule we have stated; rapidly, if the\r\n     medium opposes little friction; slowly, if it opposes much. The\r\n     water so pushed in runs off by the drain, the column of pressure\r\n     being diminished in proportion to the water which runs off.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Arkell, in a paper read before the Society of Arts, in 1855,\r\nsays, on this point:\r\n\r\n     \"The pressure due to a head of water of four or five feet, may be\r\n     imagined from the force with which water will come through the\r\n     crevices of a hatch, with that depth of water above it. Now, there\r\n     is the same pressure of water to enter the vacuum in the\r\n     pipe-drain, as there is against the hatches, supposing the land to\r\n     be full to the surface.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not find any intimation that there is any error in the view\r\nadvanced by the learned gentleman quoted; and if there is none, we have\r\nan explanation of the faculty which water seems to have, of finding its\r\nway into drainpipes. Yet, we feel bound to confess, that, aside from\r\nauthority, we should have supposed that the pressure due to a column of\r\npure water, would be essentially lessened, by the interposition of solid\r\nmatter between its particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF DRAINAGE ON STREAMS AND RIVERS.\r\n\r\n     Drainage Hastens the Supply to the Streams, and thus Creates\r\n     Freshets.--Effect of Drainage on Meadows below; on Water\r\n     Privileges.--Conflict of Manufacturing and Agricultural\r\n     Interests.--English Opinions and Facts.--Uses of Drainage\r\n     Water.--Irrigation.--Drainage Water for Stock.--How used by Mr.\r\n     Mechi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of drainage upon streams and rivers, has, perhaps, little to\r\ninterest merely practical men, in this country, at present; but the time\r\nwill soon arrive, when mill-owners and land-owners will be compelled to\r\ninvestigate the subject. Men unaccustomed to minute investigation, are\r\nslow to appreciate the great effects produced by apparently small\r\ncauses; and it may seem to many, that the operations of drainage for\r\nagriculture, are too insignificant in their details, perceptibly to\r\naffect the flow of mill-streams and rivers. A moment's thought will\r\nconvince the most skeptical, that the thorough-drainage of the wet\r\nlands, even of a New England township, must produce sensible effects\r\nupon the streams which convey its surplus water toward the sea.\r\n\r\nIn making investigations to ascertain what quantity of water may be\r\nrelied upon to supply a reservoir, whether natural or artificial, for\r\nthe use of a town or city, a survey is first taken of the district of\r\nterritory which naturally is drained into the reservoir, and thus the\r\nnumber of square miles of surface is ascertained. Then the rain-tables\r\nare consulted, and the fall of rain upon the surveyed district is\r\ncomputed. The ascertained proportion of rain-fall, which usually goes\r\noff by evaporation, is then deducted, which leaves with sufficient\r\naccuracy, the amount of water which flows both upon the surface, and\r\nthrough the soil, to the reservoir. With proper deductions for waste by\r\nfreshets, when the water will overflow the reservoir, and for other\r\nknown losses, a reliable estimate is readily made, in advance, of the\r\nquantity of water supplied to the reservoir.\r\n\r\nNow, these reservoirs Nature has placed in all our valleys, in the form\r\nof lakes and ponds, and the drainage into them is by natural springs and\r\nstreams; and the annual amount of the water thus naturally flowing into\r\nthem may be readily computed, if the area within their head-waters be\r\nknown. If the earth's surface were, like iron, impervious to water, the\r\nrain-water would come in torrents down the hill-sides, and along the\r\ngentle declivities, into the streams, creating freshets and inundations\r\nin a few hours. But instead of that, the soft showers fall, often on the\r\nopen, thirsty soil, and so are gradually absorbed. A part of the\r\nrain-water is there held, until it returns by evaporation, to the\r\nclouds, while a part slowly percolates downward, finding its way into\r\nswamps and springy plains, and finally, after days or weeks of\r\nwandering, slowly, but surely, finds its outlet in the stream or pond.\r\n\r\nIf now, this surplus of water, this part which cannot be evaporated, and\r\nmust therefore, sooner or later, enter the stream or pond, be, by\r\nartificial channels, carried directly to its destination, without the\r\ndelay of filtration through swamps and clay-banks; the effect of rain to\r\nraise the streams and ponds, must be more sudden and immediate.\r\nAgricultural drains furnish those artificial channels. The flat and\r\nmossy swamp, which before retained the water until the Midsummer\r\ndrought, and then slowly parted with it, by evaporation or gradual\r\nfiltration, now, by thorough-drainage, in two or three days at most,\r\nsends all its surplus water onward to the natural stream. The stagnant\r\nclay-beds, which formerly, by slow degrees, allowed the water to filter\r\nthrough them to the wayside ditch, and then to the river, now, by\r\ndrainage, contribute their proportion, in a few hours, to swell the\r\nstream. Thus, evaporation is lessened, and the amount of water which\r\nenters the natural channels largely increased; and, what is of more\r\nimportance, the water which flows from the land is sent at once, after\r\nits fall from the heavens, into the streams. This produces upon the\r\nmill-streams a two-fold effect; first, to raise sudden freshets to\r\noverflow the dams, and sweep away the mills; and, secondly, to dry up\r\ntheir supply in dry seasons, and to diminish their water-power.\r\n\r\nUpon the low meadows which border the streams, the effects of the\r\ndrainage of lands above them are various, according to their position.\r\nIn many cases, it must subject them to inundation by Summer freshets,\r\nand must require for their protection, catch-waters and embankments, and\r\nlarge facilities for drainage.\r\n\r\nThe effect of drainage upon \"water privileges,\" must inevitably be, to\r\nlessen their value, by giving them a sudden surplus, followed by\r\ndrought, instead of a regular supply of water. Water-power companies and\r\nmill-owners are never careless of their interests. Through the patriotic\r\ndesire to foster home-manufactures, our State legislatures have granted\r\nmany peculiar privileges to manufacturing corporations. Indeed, all the\r\nstreams and rivers of New England are chained to labor at their wheels.\r\n\r\nAgriculture has thus far taken care of herself, but is destined soon to\r\ncome in collision with the chartered privileges of manufactures. Many\r\nquestions, touching the right of land-owners to change the natural flow\r\nof the water, to the injury of mill-owners; many questions touching the\r\nright of mill-owners to obstruct the natural course of streams, to the\r\ninjury of the farmer, will inevitably arise in our Courts. Slowly, and\r\nstep by step, must the lesser interest of manufactures, recede before\r\nthe advance of the great fundamental interest of agriculture, until, in\r\nprocess of time, steam, or some yet undiscovered giant power, shall put\r\nits hand to the great wheel of the factory and the mill, and the pent-up\r\nwaters shall subside to their natural banks.\r\n\r\nThat these are not mere speculations of our own, may be seen from\r\nextracts which will be given from answers returned by distinguished\r\nobservers of these matters in England and Scotland, to a question\r\nproposed to them as to the actual effects produced by extensive\r\ndrainage. Some diversity of opinion is observable in the different\r\nreplies, which were made, independently in writing, and so are more\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Smith._--\"During dry periods, more particularly in Summer, the\r\n     water in the streams is greatly lessened by thorough-draining; for\r\n     there is so great a mass of comparatively dry and absorbent soil to\r\n     receive the rain, that Summer showers, unless very heavy and\r\n     continuous, will be entirely absorbed.\"\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Parkes._--\"The intention and effect of a complete and\r\n     systematic under-drainage is the liberation of the water of rain\r\n     more quickly from the land than if it were not drained; and\r\n     therefore the natural vents, or rivers, very generally require\r\n     enlargement or deepening, in order to pass off the drainage water\r\n     in sufficiently quick time, and so as to avoid flooding lower\r\n     lands.\r\n\r\n     \"The sluggish rivers of the midland and southern counties of\r\n     England especially, oppose great obstacles to land-drainage, being\r\n     usually full to the banks, or nearly so, and converted into a\r\n     series of ponds, by mill-dams erected at a few miles distance below\r\n     each other; so that, frequently, no effectual drainage of the\r\n     richest alluvial soil composing the meadows, can be made, without\r\n     forming embankments, or by pumping, or by resort to other\r\n     artificial and expensive means.\r\n\r\n     \"The greater number of the corn and other water-mills throughout\r\n     England ought to be demolished, for the advantage of agriculture,\r\n     and steam-power should to be provided for the millers. I believe\r\n     that such an arrangement would, in most cases, prove to be\r\n     economical both to the landholder and the miller.\r\n\r\n     \"Every old authority, and all modern writers on land drainage in\r\n     England, have condemned water-mills and mill-dams: and if all the\r\n     rivers of England were surveyed from the sea to their source, the\r\n     mills upon them valued, the extent of land injured or benefitted by\r\n     such mill-dams ascertained, and the whole question of advantage or\r\n     injury done to the land-owner appreciated and appraised, I have\r\n     little doubt but that the injury done, would be found so greatly to\r\n     exceed the rental of the mills, deduction being made of the cost of\r\n     maintaining them, that it would be a measure of national economy,\r\n     to buy up the mills, and give the millers steam-power.\"\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Spooner._--\"The effect which extensive drainage produces on\r\n     the main water-courses of districts, is that of increasing the\r\n     height of their rise at flood times, and rendering the flow and\r\n     subsidence more rapid than before. I have repeatedly heard the\r\n     River Tweed adduced as a striking instance of this fact, and that\r\n     the change has taken place within the observation of the present\r\n     generation.\"\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Maccaw._--\"It has been observed that, after extensive\r\n     surface-drainage on the sheepwalks in the higher parts of the\r\n     country, and when the lower lands were enclosed by ditches, and\r\n     partially drained for the purposes of cultivation, all rivers\r\n     flowing therefrom, rise more rapidly after heavy rains or falls of\r\n     snow, and discharge their surplus waters more quickly, than under\r\n     former circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Beattie._--\"It renders them more speedily flooded, and to a\r\n     greater height, and they fall sooner. Rivers are lower in Summer\r\n     and higher in Winter.\"\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Nielson._--\"The immediate effect of the drainage of higher\r\n     lands has often been to inundate the lower levels.\"\r\n\r\nIn a prize essay of John Algernon Clarke, speaking of the effect of\r\ndrainage along the course of the River Nene, in England, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"The upland farms are delivering their drain-water in much larger\r\n     quantities, and more immediately after the downfall, than formerly,\r\n     and swelling to the depth of three to six feet over the 20,000\r\n     acres of open ground, which form one vast reservoir for it above\r\n     and below Peterborough. The Nene used to overflow its banks, to the\r\n     extreme height, about the third day after rain: the floods now\r\n     reach the same height in about half that time. Twelve hours' rain\r\n     will generally cause an overflow of the land, which all lies\r\n     unembanked from the stream; and where it is already saturated,\r\n     this takes place in six or even in two hours. Such a quick rise\r\n     will cause one body of flood-water to extend for forty or fifty\r\n     miles in succession, with a width varying from a quarter of a mile\r\n     to a mile; but it stays sometimes for six weeks, or even two\r\n     months, upon the ground. And those floods come down with an\r\n     alarming power and velocity--bridges which have stood for a century\r\n     are washed away, and districts where floods were previously unknown\r\n     have became liable to their sudden periodical inundations. The land\r\n     being wholly in meadow, suffers very heavily from the destruction\r\n     of its hay. So sudden are the inundations, that it frequently\r\n     happens that hay made in the day has, in the night been found\r\n     swimming and gone. A public-house sign at Wansford commemorates the\r\n     locally-famed circumstance of a man who, having fallen asleep on a\r\n     hay-cock, was carried down the stream by a sudden flood: awakening\r\n     just under the bridge of that town, and being informed where he\r\n     was, he demanded, in astonishment, if this were 'Wansford in\r\n     England.'\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the floods in that neighborhood now reach their height in\r\nhalf their former time, in consequence of the drainage of the \"upland\r\nfarms,\" is very significant.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton thus speaks upon the same point, though his immediate subject\r\nwas that of compulsory outfalls.\r\n\r\n     \"Although the quantity of land drained was small, in comparison to\r\n     that which remained to be drained, the water which was discharged\r\n     by the drainage already effected found its way so rapidly to the\r\n     outfalls, that the consequences were becoming more and more\r\n     injurious every day. The millers were now suffering from two\r\n     causes. At times of excess, after a considerable fall of rain, and\r\n     when the miller was injuriously overloaded, the excess was\r\n     increased by the rapidity with which the under-drains discharged\r\n     themselves; and as the quantity of water thus discharged, must\r\n     necessarily lessen the subsequent supply, the period of drought was\r\n     advanced in a corresponding degree. As the millers already saw\r\n     this, and were anticipating increasing losses, they would join in\r\n     finding a substitute for water-power upon fair terms.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not supposed, that any considerable practical effects of drainage,\r\nupon the streams of this country, have been observed. A treatise,\r\nhowever, upon the general subject of Drainage, which should omit a point\r\nlike this, which must, before many years, attract serious attention,\r\nwould be quite incomplete. Whether the effect of a system of\r\nthorough-drainage make for or against the interest of mill and meadow\r\nowners on the lower parts of streams, should have no influence over\r\nthose who design only to present the truth, in all its varied aspects.\r\n\r\nAs some compensation for the evils which may fall upon lands at a lower\r\nlevel, by drainage of uplands, it may be interesting to notice briefly\r\nin this place, some of the uses to which drainage-water has been\r\napplied, for the advantage of lower lands. In many cases, in Great\r\nBritain, the water of drainage has been preserved in reservoirs, or\r\nartificial ponds, and applied for the irrigation of water meadows; and\r\nas is suggested by Lieut. Maury, in a letter quoted in our introductory\r\nchapter, the same may, in many localities, be done in this country, and\r\nthus our crops of grass be often tripled, on our low meadows. In many\r\ncases, water from deep drains, will furnish the most convenient supply\r\nfor barn yards and pastures. It is usually sufficiently pure and cool in\r\nSummer, and is preferred by cattle to the water of running streams.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Mechi's farm at Tiptree Hall, in England, we observed a large\r\ncistern, in which all the manure necessary for the highest culture of\r\n170 acres of land, is liquified, and from which it is pumped out by a\r\nsteam engine, over the farm. All the water, which supplies the cistern,\r\nis collected from tile drains on the farm, where there had before been\r\nno running water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION--DRAINAGE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\n     England protects her Farmers.--Meadows ruined by Corporation\r\n     dams.--Old Mills often Nuisances.--Factory Reservoirs.--Flowage\r\n     extends above level of Dam.--Rye and Derwent Drainage.--Give Steam\r\n     for Water-Power.--Right to Drain through land of others.--Right to\r\n     natural flow of Water.--Laws of Mass.--Right to Flow; why not to\r\n     Drain?--Land-drainage Companies in England.--Lincolnshire\r\n     Fens.--Government Loans for Drainage.\r\n\r\nNothing more clearly shows the universal interest and confidence of the\r\npeople of Great Britain, in the operation of land-drainage, than the\r\nacts of Parliament in relation to the subject. The conservatism of\r\nEngland, in the view of an American, is striking. She never takes a step\r\ntill she is sure she is right. Justly proud of her position among the\r\nnations, she deems change an unsafe experiment, and what has been, much\r\nsafer than what might be. Vested rights are sacred in England, and\r\nespecially rights in lands, which are emphatically real estate there.\r\n\r\nSuch are the sentiments of the people, and such the sentiments of their\r\nrepresentatives and exponents, the Lords and Commons.\r\n\r\nYet England has been so impressed with the importance of improving the\r\ncondition of the people, of increasing the wealth of the nation, of\r\nenriching both tenant and landlord, by draining the land, that the\r\nhistory of her legislation, in aid of such operations, affords a lesson\r\nof progress even to fast Young America. Powers have been granted, by\r\nwhich encumbered estates may be charged with the expenses of drainage,\r\nso that remainder-men and reversioners, without their consent, shall be\r\ncompelled to contribute to present improvements; so that careless or\r\nobstinate adjacent proprietors shall be compelled to keep open their\r\nditches for outfalls to their neighbor's drains; so that mill-dams, and\r\nother obstructions to the natural flow of the water, may be removed for\r\nthe benefit of agriculture; and, finally, the Government has itself\r\nfurnished funds, by way of loans, of millions of pounds, in aid of\r\nimprovements of this character.\r\n\r\nIn America, where private individual right is usually compelled to yield\r\nto the good of the whole, and where selfishness and obstinacy do not\r\nlong stand in the pathway of progress, obstructing manifest improvement\r\nin the condition of the people; we are yet far behind England in legal\r\nfacilities for promoting the improvement of land culture. This is\r\nbecause the attention of the public has not been particularly called to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nManufacturing corporations are created by special acts of legislation.\r\nIn many States, rights to flow, and ruin, by inundation, most valuable\r\nlands along the course of rivers, and by the banks of ponds and lakes,\r\nto aid the water-power of mills, are granted to companies, and the\r\nland-owner is compelled to part with his meadows for such compensation\r\nas a committee or jury shall assess.\r\n\r\nIn almost every town in New England there are hundreds, and often\r\nthousands, of acres of lands, that might be most productive to the\r\nfarmer; overflowed half the year with water, to drive some old saw-mill,\r\nor grist-mill, or cotton-mill, which has not made a dividend, or paid\r\nexpenses, for a quarter of a century. The whole water-power, which,\r\nperhaps, ruins for cultivation a thousand acres of fertile land, and\r\ndivides and breaks up farms, by creating little creeks and swamps\r\nthroughout all the neighboring valleys, is not worth, and would not be\r\nassessed, by impartial men, at one thousand dollars. Yet, though there\r\nis power to take the farmer's land for the benefit of manufacturers,\r\nthere is no power to take down the company's dam for the benefit of\r\nagriculture. An old saw-mill, which can only run a few days in a Spring\r\nfreshet, often swamps a half-township of land, because somebody's\r\ngreat-grandfather had a prescriptive right to flow, when lands were of\r\nno value, and saw-mills were a public blessing.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous cases, within our own knowledge, where the very land\r\noverflowed and ruined by some incorporated company, would, if allowed to\r\nproduce its natural growth of timber and wood, furnish ten times the\r\nfuel necessary to supply steam-engines, to propel the machinery carried\r\nby the water-power.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with obstructing the streams in their course, the larger\r\ncompanies are, of late, making use of the interior lakes, fifty or a\r\nhundred miles inland, as reservoirs, to keep back water for the use of\r\nthe mills in the summer droughts. Thus are thousands of acres of land\r\ndrowned, and rendered worse than useless; for the water is kept up till\r\nMidsummer, and drawn off when a dog-day climate is just ready to\r\nconvert the rich and slimy sediment of the pond into pestilential\r\nvapors. These waters, too, controlled by the mill-owners, are thus let\r\ndown in floods, in Midsummer, to overflow the meadows and corn-fields of\r\nthe farmer, or the intervals and bottom-lands below.\r\n\r\nNow, while we would never advocate any attack upon the rights of\r\nmill-owners, or ask them to sacrifice their interests to those of\r\nagriculture, it surely is proper to call attention to the injury which\r\nthe productive capacity of the soil is suffering, by the flooding of our\r\nbest tracts, in sections of country where land is most valuable. Could\r\nnot mill-owners, in many instances, adopt steam instead of water-power,\r\nand becoming land-_draining_ companies, instead of land-_drowning_\r\ncompanies; at least, let Nature have free course with her gently-flowing\r\nrivers, and allow the promise to be fulfilled, that the earth shall be\r\nno more cursed with a flood.\r\n\r\nWe would ask for the land-owner, simply equality of rights with the\r\nmill-owner. If a legislature may grant the right to flow lands, against\r\nthe will of the owner, to promote manufactures, the same legislature may\r\nsurely grant the right, upon proper occasion, to remove dams, and other\r\nobstructions to our streams, to promote agriculture. The rights of\r\nmill-owners are no more sacred than those of land-owners; and the\r\ninterests of manufactures are, surely, no more important than those of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nWe would not advocate much interference with private rights. In some of\r\nthe States, no special privileges have been conferred upon water-power\r\ncompanies. They have been left to procure their rights of flowage, by\r\nprivate contract with the land-owners; and in such States, probably, the\r\nlegislatures would be as slow to interfere with rights of flowage, as\r\nwith other rights. Yet, there are cases where, for the preservation of\r\nthe health of the community, and for the general convenience,\r\ngovernments have everywhere exercised the power of interfering with\r\nprivate property, and limiting the control of the owners. To preserve\r\nthe public health, we abate as nuisances, by process of law,\r\nslaughter-houses, and other establishments offensive to health and\r\ncomfort, and we provide, by compulsory assessments upon land-owners, for\r\nsewerage, for side-walks, and the like, in our cities.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, for the public good, we take private property for highways,\r\nupon just compensation, and the property of corporations is thus taken,\r\nlike that of individuals.\r\n\r\nAgain, we compel adjacent owners to fence their lands, and maintain\r\ntheir proportion of division fences of the legal height, and we elect\r\nfence viewers, with power to adjust equitably, the expenses of such\r\nfences. We assess bachelors and maidens, in most States, for the\r\nconstruction of schoolhouses, and the education of the children of\r\nothers, and, in various ways, compel each member of society to\r\ncontribute to the common welfare.\r\n\r\nHow far it may be competent, for a State legislature to provide for, or\r\nassist in, the drainage of extensive and unhealthy marshes; or how far\r\nindividual owners should be compelled to contribute to a common\r\nimprovement of their lands; or how far, and in what cases, one\r\nland-owner should be authorized to enter upon land of another, to secure\r\nor maintain the best use of his own land--these are questions which it\r\nis unnecessary for us to attempt to determine. It is well that they\r\nshould be suggested, because they will, at no distant day, engage much\r\nattention. It is well, too, that the steps which conservative England\r\nhas thought it proper to take in this direction, should be understood,\r\nthat we may the better determine whether any, and if any, what course\r\nour States may safely take, to aid the great and leading interest of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe swamps and stagnant meadows along our small streams and our rivers,\r\nwhich are taken from the farmer, by flowage, for the benefit of mills,\r\nare often, in New England, the most fertile part of the townships--equal\r\nto the bottom lands of the West; and they are right by the doors of\r\nyoung men, who leave their homes with regret, because the rich land of\r\nfar-off new States offers temptations, which their native soil cannot\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly of great importance to the old States, to inquire into\r\nthese matters, and set proper bounds to the use of streams for\r\nwater-powers. The associated wealth and influence of manufacturers, is\r\nalways more powerful than the individual efforts of the land-owners.\r\n\r\nReservoirs are always growing larger, and dams continually grow higher\r\nand tighter. The water, by little and little, creeps insidiously on to,\r\nand into, the meadows far above the obstruction, and the land-owner must\r\noften elect between submission to this aggression, and a tedious\r\nlaw-suit with a powerful adversary. The evil of obstructions to streams\r\nand rivers, is by no means limited to the land visibly flowed, nor to\r\nland at the level of the dam. Running water is never level, or it could\r\nnot flow; and in crooked streams, which flow through meadows, obstructed\r\nby grass and bushes, the water raised by a dam, often stands many feet\r\nhigher, at a mile or two back, than at the dam. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to set limits to the effect of such a flowage. Water is flowed\r\ninto the subsoil, or rather is prevented from running out; the natural\r\ndrainage of the country is prevented; and land which might well be\r\ndrained artificially, were the stream not obstructed, is found to lie so\r\nnear the level, as to be deprived of the requisite fall by back water,\r\nor the sluggish current occasioned by the dam.\r\n\r\nThese obstructions to drainage have become subjects of much attention,\r\nand of legislative intervention in various forms in England, and some of\r\nthe facts elicited in their investigations are very instructive.\r\n\r\nIn a discussion before the Society of Arts, in 1855, in which many\r\ngentlemen, experienced in drainage, took a part, this subject of\r\nobstruction by mill-dams came up.\r\n\r\nMr. G. Donaldson said he had been much engaged in works of\r\nland-drainage, and that, in many instances, great difficulties were\r\nexperienced in obtaining outfalls, owing to the water rights, on the\r\ncourse of rivers for mill-power, &c.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Grantham spoke of the necessity of further legislation, \"so as to\r\ngive power to lower bridges and culverts, under public roads, and\r\nstraighten and deepen rivers and streams.\" But, he said, authority was\r\nwanting, above all, \"for the removal of mills, dams, and other\r\nobstructions in rivers, which, in many cases, did incalculable injury,\r\nmany times exceeding the value of the mills, by keeping up the level of\r\nrivers, and rendering it totally impossible to drain the adjoining\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nMr. R. F. Davis said, \"If they were to go into the midland districts,\r\nthey would see great injury done, from damming the water for mills.\"\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the same difficulty has arisen. \"In many parts of this\r\ncountry,\" says a Scottish writer, \"small lochs (lakes) and dams are kept\r\nup, for the sake of mills, under old tenures, which, if drained, the\r\nland gained by that operation, would, in many instances, be worth ten\r\ntimes the rent of such mills.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Rye and Derwent Drainage, an account of which is\r\nfound in the 14th Vol. of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society,\r\na plan of compensation was adopted, where it became necessary to remove\r\ndams and other obstructions, which is worthy of attention. The\r\nCommissioners under the Act of 1846, removed the mill-wheels, and\r\nsubstituted steam-engines corresponding to the power actually used by\r\nthe mills, compensating, also, the proprietors for inconvenience, and\r\nthe future additional expensiveness of the new power.\r\n\r\n\"The claims of a short canal navigation, two fisheries, and tenants'\r\ndamages through derangement of business during the alterations, were\r\ndisposed of without much outlay; and the pecuniary advantages of the\r\nwork are apparent from the fact, that a single flood, such as\r\nfrequently overflowed the land, has been known to do more damage, if\r\nfairly valued in money, than the whole sum expended under the act.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this act, it became necessary for the Commissioners to estimate\r\nthe comparative cost of steam and water-power, in order to carry out\r\ntheir idea of giving to the mill-owners a steam-power equivalent to\r\ntheir water-power.\r\n\r\n\"As the greater part of their water-power was employed on corn and\r\nflour-mills, upon these the calculations were chiefly based. It was\r\ngenerally admitted to be very near the truth, that to turn a pair of\r\nflour-mill stones properly, requires a power equal to that of\r\ntwo-and-a-half horses, or on an average, twenty horses' power, to turn\r\nand work a mill of eight-pairs of stones, and that the total cost of a\r\ntwenty-horse steam-engine, with all its appliances, would be $5,000, or\r\n$250 per horse power.\"\r\n\r\nCalculations for the maintenance of the steam-power are also given; but\r\nthis depends so much on local circumstances, that English estimates\r\nwould be of little value to us.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements in this case with the mill-owners, were made by\r\ncontract, and not by force of any arbitrary power, and the success of\r\nthe enterprise, in the drainage of the lands, the prevention of damage\r\nby floods, especially in hay and harvest-time, and in the improvement of\r\nthe health of vegetation, as well as of man and animals, is said to be\r\nstrikingly manifest.\r\n\r\nThis act provides for a \"water-bailiff,\" whose duty it is to inspect the\r\nrivers, streams, water-courses, &c., and enforce the due maintenance of\r\nthe banks, and the uninterrupted discharge of the waters at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPULSORY OUTFALLS.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, especially in New England, where farms are small, and\r\nthe country is broken, that an owner of valuable lands overcharged with\r\nwater, perhaps a swamp or low meadow, or perhaps a field of upland,\r\nlying nearly level, desires to drain his tract, but cannot find\r\nsufficient fall, without going upon the land of owners below. These\r\nadjacent owners may not appreciate the advantages of drainage; or their\r\nlands may not require it; or, what is not unusual, they may from various\r\nmotives, good and evil, refuse to allow their lands to be meddled with.\r\n\r\nNow, without desiring to be understood as speaking judicially, we know\r\nof no authority of law by which a land-owner may enter upon the\r\nterritory of his neighbor for the purpose of draining his own land, and\r\nperhaps no such power should ever be conferred. All owners upon streams,\r\ngreat and small, have however, the right to the natural flow of the\r\nwater, both above and below. Their neighbors below cannot obstruct a\r\nstream so as to flow back the water upon, or into, the land above; and\r\nwhere artificial water-courses, as ditches and drains have long been\r\nopened, the presumption would be that all persons benefitted by them,\r\nhave the right to have them kept open.\r\n\r\nParliament is held to be omnipotent, and in the act of 1847, known as\r\nLord Lincoln's Act, its power is well illustrated, as is also the\r\ndetermination of the British nation that no trifling impediments shall\r\nhinder the progress of the great work of draining lands for agriculture.\r\nThe act, in effect, authorizes any person interested in draining his\r\nlands, to clear a passage through all obstructions, wherever it would be\r\nworth the expense of works and compensation.\r\n\r\nIts general provisions may be found in the 15th Vol. of the Journal of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of the author, to decide what may properly be\r\ndone within the authority of different States, in aid of public or\r\nprivate drainage enterprises. The State Legislatures are not, like\r\nParliament, omnipotent. They are limited by their written constitutions.\r\nPerhaps no better criterion of power, with respect to compelling\r\ncontribution, by persons benefitted, to the cost of drainage, and with\r\ninterfering with individual rights, for public or private advantage, can\r\nbe found, than the exercise of power in the cases of fences and of\r\nflowage.\r\n\r\nIf we may lawfully compel a person to fence his land, to exclude the\r\ncattle of other persons, or, if he neglect to fence, subject him to\r\ntheir depredations, without indemnity, as is done in many States; or if\r\nwe may compel him to contribute to the erection of division fences, of a\r\ngiven height, though he has no animal in the world to be shut in or out\r\nof his field, there would seem to be equal reason, in compelling him to\r\ndig half a division ditch for the benefit of himself and neighbor.\r\n\r\nIf, again, as we have already hinted, the Legislature may authorize a\r\ncorporation to flow and inundate the land of an unwilling citizen, to\r\nraise a water-power for a cotton-mill, it must be a nice discrimination\r\nof powers, that prohibits the same Legislature from authorizing the\r\nentry into lands of a protesting mill-owner, or of an unknown or\r\ncross-grained proprietor, to open an outlet for a valuable,\r\nhealth-giving system of drainage.\r\n\r\nIn the valuable treatise of Dr. Warder, of Cincinnati, recently\r\npublished in New York, upon Hedges and Evergreens, an abstract is given\r\nof the statutes of most of our States, upon the subject of fences, and\r\nwe know of no other book, in which so good an idea of the legislation on\r\nthis subject, can be so readily obtained.\r\n\r\nBy the statutes of Massachusetts, any person may erect and maintain a\r\nwater-mill, and dam to raise water for working it, upon and across any\r\nstream that is not navigable, provided he does not interfere with\r\nexisting mills. Any person whose land is overflowed, may, on complaint,\r\nhave a trial and a verdict of a jury; which may fix the height of the\r\ndam, decide whether it shall be left open any part of the year, and fix\r\ncompensation, either annual or in gross, for the injury. All other\r\nremedies for such flowage are taken away, and thus the land of the owner\r\nmay be converted into a mill-pond against his consent.\r\n\r\nWe find nothing in the Massachusetts statutes which gives to\r\nland-owners, desirous of improving their wet lands, any power to\r\ninterfere in any way with the rights of mill-owners, for the drainage of\r\nlands. The statutes of the Commonwealth, however, make liberal and\r\nstringent provisions, for compelling unwilling owners to contribute to\r\nthe drainage of wet lands.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of those who may be desirous of procuring\r\nlegislation on this subject, we will give a brief abstract of the\r\nleading statute of Massachusetts regulating this matter. It may be found\r\nin Chapter 115 of the Revised Statutes, of 1836. The first Section\r\nexplains the general object.\r\n\r\nWhen any meadow, swamp, marsh, beach, or other low land, shall be held\r\nby several proprietors, and it shall be necessary or useful to drain or\r\nflow the same, or to remove obstructions in rivers or streams leading\r\ntherefrom, such improvements may be effected, under the direction of\r\nCommissioners, in the manner provided in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe statute provides that the proprietors, or a greater part of them in\r\ninterest, may apply, by petition, to the Court of Common Pleas, setting\r\nforth the proposed improvements, and for notice to the proprietors who\r\ndo not join in the petition, and for a hearing. The court may then\r\nappoint three, five, or seven commissioners to cause the improvements to\r\nbe effected. The commissioners are authorized to cause dams or dikes to\r\nbe erected on the premises, at such places, and in such manner as they\r\nshall direct; and may order the land to be flowed thereby, for such\r\nperiods of each year as they shall think most beneficial, and also cause\r\nditches to be opened on the premises, and obstructions in any rivers or\r\nstreams leading therefrom to be removed.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for assessment of the expenses of the improvements,\r\nupon all the proprietors, according to the benefit each will derive from\r\nit, and for the collection of the amount assessed.\r\n\r\n\"When the commissioners shall find it necessary or expedient to reduce\r\nor raise the waters, for the purpose of obtaining a view of the\r\npremises, or for the more convenient or expeditious removal of\r\nobstructions therein, they may open the flood-gates of any mill, or\r\nmake other needful passages through or round the dam thereof or erect a\r\ntemporary dam on the land of any person, who is not a party to the\r\nproceedings, and may maintain such dam, or such passages for the water,\r\nas long as shall be necessary for the purposes aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nProvision is made for previous notice to persons who are not parties,\r\nand for compensation to them for injuries occasioned by the\r\ninterference, and for appeal to the courts.\r\n\r\nThis statute gives, by no means, the powers necessary to compel\r\ncontribution to all necessary drainage, because, first, it is limited in\r\nits application to \"meadow, swamp, marsh, beach, or other low land.\" The\r\nword _meadow_, in New England, is used in its original sense of flat and\r\nwet land. Secondly, the statute seems to give no authority to open\r\npermanent ditches on the land of others than the owners of such low\r\nland, although it provides for temporary passages for the purposes of\r\n\"obtaining a view of the premises, or for the more convenient or\r\nexpeditious removal of obstructions _therein_\"--the word \"therein\"\r\nreferring to the \"premises\" under improvement, so that there is no\r\nprovision for outfalls, under this statute, except through natural\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nBy a statute of March 28, 1855, the Legislature of Massachusetts has\r\nexercised a _power_ as extensive as is desirable for all purposes of\r\ndrainage, although the provisions of the act referred to are not,\r\nperhaps, so broad as may be found necessary, in order to open outfalls\r\nand remove all obstructions to drainage. As this act is believed to be\r\npeculiar, we give its substance:\r\n\r\n\"An Act to authorize the making of Roads and Drains in certain cases.\r\n\r\n\"SECT. 1. Any town or city, person or persons, company or body\r\ncorporate, having the ownership of low lands, lakes, swamps, quarries,\r\nmines, or mineral deposits, that, by means of adjacent lands belonging\r\nto other persons, or occupied as a highway, cannot be approached,\r\nworked, drained, or used in the ordinary manner without crossing said\r\nlands or highway, may be authorized to establish roads, drains, ditches,\r\ntunnels, and railways to said places in the manner herein provided.\r\n\r\n\"SECT. 2. The party desiring to make such improvements shall file a\r\npetition therefor with the commissioners of the county in which the\r\npremises are situated, setting forth the names of the persons\r\ninterested, if known to the petitioner, and also, in detail, the nature\r\nof the proposed improvement, and the situation of the adjoining lands.\"\r\n\r\nSECT. 3 provides for notice to owners and town authorities.\r\n\r\nSECT. 4 provides for a hearing, and laying out the improvement, and\r\nassessment of damages upon the respective parties, \"having strict regard\r\nto the benefits which they will receive.\"\r\n\r\nSECT. 5 provides for repairs by a majority of those benefitted; and\r\nSect. 6 for appeals, as in the case of highways.\r\n\r\nBy an act of 1857, this act was so far amended as to authorize the\r\napplication for the desired improvement, to be made to the Select-men of\r\nthe town, or the Mayor and Aldermen of the city, in case the lands over\r\nwhich the improvement is desired are all situated in one town or city.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest certainly, that the State assumes power sufficient to\r\nauthorize any interference with private property that may be necessary\r\nfor the most extended and thorough drainage operations. The power which\r\nmay compel a man to improve his portion of a swamp, may apply as well to\r\nhis wet hill-sides; and the power which may open temporary passages\r\nthrough lands or dams, without consent of the owner, may keep them open\r\npermanently, if expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND DRAINAGE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\nBesides the charters which have at various times, for many centuries,\r\nbeen granted to companies, for the drainage of fens and marshes, and\r\nother lowlands, in modern times, great encouragement has been given by\r\nthe British Government for the drainage and other improvement of\r\nhigh-lands. Not only have extensive powers been granted to companies, to\r\nproceed with their own means, to effect the objects in view, but the\r\nGovernment itself has advanced money, by way of loan, in aid of drainage\r\nand like improvements.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of two acts of Parliament, no less than $20,000,000\r\nhave been loaned in aid of such improvements. These acts are generally\r\nknown as PUBLIC MONEYS DRAINAGE ACTS. There are already four chartered\r\ncompanies for the same general objects, doing an immense amount of\r\nbusiness, on _private_ funds.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient, perhaps, to state, in general terms, the mode of\r\noperation under these several acts.\r\n\r\nMost lands in England are held under incumbrances of some kind. Many are\r\nentailed, as it is termed: that is to say, vested for life in certain\r\npersons, and then to go to others, the tenant for life having no power\r\nto sell the property. Often, the life estate is owned by one person, and\r\nthe remainder by a stranger, or remote branch of the family, whom the\r\nlife-tenant has no desire to benefit. In such cases, the tenant, or\r\noccupant, would be unwilling to make expensive improvements at his own\r\ncost, which might benefit himself but a few years, and then go into\r\nother hands.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the remainder-man would have no right to meddle with\r\nthe property while the tenant-for-life was in possession; and it would\r\nbe rare, that all those interested could agree to unite in efforts to\r\nincrease the general value of the estate, by such improvements.\r\n\r\nThe great object in view was, then, to devise means, by which such\r\nestates, suffering for want of systematic, and often expensive, drainage\r\noperations, might be improved, and the cost of improvement be charged on\r\nthe estate, so as to do no injustice to any party interested.\r\n\r\nThe plan finally adopted, is, to allow the tenant or occupant to have\r\nthe improvement made, either by expending his private funds, or by\r\nborrowing of the Government or the private companies, and having the\r\namount expended, made a charge on the land, to be paid, in annual\r\npayments, by the person who shall be in occupation each year. Under one\r\nof these acts, the term of payment is fixed at 22 years, and under a\r\nlater act, at 50 years.\r\n\r\nThus, if A own a life-estate in lands, and B the remainder, and the\r\nestate needs draining, A may take such steps as to have the improvement\r\nmade, by borrowing the money, and repaying it by yearly payments, in\r\nsuch sums as will pay the whole expenditure, with interest, in\r\ntwenty-two or fifty years: and if A die before the expiration of the\r\nterm, the succeeding occupants continue the payments until the whole is\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nA borrows, for instance, $1,000, and expends it in draining the lands.\r\nIt is made a charge, like a mortgage, on the land, to be paid in equal\r\nannual payments for fifty years. At six per cent., the annual payment\r\nwill be but about $63.33, to pay the whole amount of debt and the\r\ninterest, in fifty years. A pays this sum annually as long as he lives,\r\nand B then takes possession, and pays the annual installment.\r\n\r\nIf the tenant expend his own money, and die before the whole term\r\nexpire, he may leave the unpaid balance as a legacy, or part of his own\r\nestate, to his heirs.\r\n\r\nThe whole proceeding is based upon the idea, that the rent or income of\r\nthe property is sufficiently increased, to make the operation\r\nadvantageous to all parties. It is assumed, that the operation of\r\ndrainage, under one of these statutes, will be effectual to increase the\r\nrent of the land, to the amount of this annual payment, for at least\r\nfifty years. The fact, that the British Government, after the most\r\nthorough investigation, has thus pronounced the opinion, that drainage\r\nworks, properly conducted, will thus increase the rent of land, and\r\nremain in full operation a half century at least, affords the best\r\nevidence possible, both of the utility and the durability of tile\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF CELLARS.\r\n\r\n     Wet Cellars Unhealthful.--Importance of Cellars in New England.--A\r\n     Glance at the Garret, by way of Contrast.--Necessity of\r\n     Drains.--Sketch of an Inundated Cellar.--Tiles best for\r\n     Drains.--Best Plan of Cellar Drain; Illustration.--Cementing will\r\n     not do.--Drainage of Barn Cellars.--Uses of them.--Actual Drainage\r\n     of a very Bad Cellar described.--Drains Outside and Inside;\r\n     Illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo person needs to be informed that it is unhealthful, as well as\r\ninconvenient, to have water, at any time of the year, in the cellar. In\r\nNew England, the cellar is an essential part of the house. All sorts of\r\nvegetables, roots, and fruit, that can be injured by frost, are stored\r\nin cellars; and milk, and wine, and cider, and a thousand \"vessels of\r\nhonor,\" like tubs and buckets, churns and washing-machines, that are\r\nliable to injury from heat or cold, or other vicissitude of climate,\r\nfind a safe retreat in the cellar. Excepting the garret, which is, as\r\nAriosto represents the moon to be, the receptacle of all things useless\r\non earth, the cellar is the greatest \"curiosity shop\" of the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe poet finds in the moon,\r\n\r\n    \"Whate'er was wasted in our earthly state,\r\n    Here safely treasured--each neglected good,\r\n    Time squandered, and occasion ill-bestowed;\r\n    There sparkling chains he found, and knots of gold,\r\n    The specious ties that ill-paired lovers hold;\r\n    Each toil, each loss, each chance that men sustain,\r\n    Save Folly, which alone pervades them all,\r\n    For Folly never quits this earthly ball.\"\r\n\r\nIn the garret, are the old spinning wheel, the clock reel, the linen\r\nwheel with its distaff, your grandfather's knapsack and cartridge-box\r\nand Continental coat, your great-aunt's Leghorn bonnet and side-saddle,\r\nor pillion, great files of the village newspapers--the \"_Morning Cry_\"\r\nand \"_Midnight Yell_,\" besides worn out trunks and boxes without number.\r\nIn the cellar, are the substantiate--barrels of beef, and pork, and\r\napples, \"taters\" and turnips; in short, the Winter stores of the family.\r\n\r\nMany, perhaps most, of the cellars in New England are in some way\r\ndrained, usually by a stone culvert, laid a little lower than the bottom\r\nof the cellar, into which the water is conducted, in the Spring, when it\r\nbursts through the walls, or rises at the bottom, by means of little\r\nditches scooped out in the surface.\r\n\r\nIn some districts, people seem to have little idea of drains, even for\r\ncellars; and on flat land, endeavor to set their houses high enough to\r\nhave their cellars above ground. This, besides being extremely\r\ninconvenient for passage out of, and into the house, often fails to make\r\na dry cellar, for the water from the roof runs in, and causes a flood.\r\nAnd such accidents, as they are mildly termed by the improvident\r\nbuilders, often occur by the failure of drains imperfectly laid.\r\n\r\nNo child, who ever saw a cellar afloat, during one of these inundations,\r\nwill ever outgrow the impression. You stand on the cellar stairs, and\r\nbelow is a dark waste of waters, of illimitable extent. By the dim\r\nglimmer of the dip-candle, a scene is presented which furnishes a\r\ntolerable picture of \"chaos and old night,\" but defies all description.\r\nEmpty dry casks, with cider barrels, wash-tubs, and boxes, ride\r\ntriumphantly on the surface, while half filled vinegar and molasses\r\nkegs, like water-logged ships, roll heavily below. Broken boards and\r\nplanks, old hoops, and staves, and barrel-heads innumerable, are\r\nbuoyant with this change of the elements; while floating turnips and\r\napples, with, here and there, a brilliant cabbage head, gleam in this\r\nsubterranean firmament, like twinkling stars, dimmed by the effulgence\r\nof the moon at her full. Magnificent among the lesser vessels of the\r\nfleet, \"like some tall admiral,\" rides the enormous \"mash-tub,\" while\r\nthe astonished rats and mice are splashing about at its base in the dark\r\nwaters, like sailors just washed, at midnight, from the deck, by a heavy\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe lookers-on are filled with various emotions. The farmer sees his\r\nthousand bushels of potatoes submerged, and devoted to speedy\r\ndecay; the good wife mourns for her diluted pickles, and apple sauce,\r\nand her drowned firkins of butter; while the boys are anxious to embark\r\non a raft or in the tubs, on an excursion of pleasure and discovery.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such scenes as the above, every cellar which is not upon a dry\r\nsandbank, should be provided with a drain of some kind, which will be at\r\nall times, secure.\r\n\r\nFor a main drain from the cellar, four or six-inch tiles are abundantly\r\nsufficient, and where they can be reasonably obtained, much cheaper than\r\nstone. The expense of excavation, of hauling stone, and of laying them,\r\nwill make the expense of a stone drain far exceed that of a tile drain,\r\nwith tiles at fair prices. The tiles, if well secured at the inlet and\r\noutlet of the drain, will entirely exclude rats and mice, which always\r\ninfest stone drains to cellars. Care must be taken, if the water is\r\nconducted on the surface of the cellar into the drain, that nothing but\r\npure water be admitted. This may be effected by a fine strainer of wire\r\nor plate; or by a cess-pool, which is better, because it will also\r\nprevent any draft of air through the drain.\r\n\r\nThe very best method of draining a cellar is that adopted by the writer,\r\non his own premises. It is, in fact, a mere application of the ordinary\r\nprinciples of field drainage. The cellar was dug in sand, which rests on\r\nclay, a foot or two below the usual water-line in winter, and a drain of\r\nchestnut plank laid from the cellar to low land, some 20 rods off. Tiles\r\nwere not then in use in the neighborhood, and were not thought of, when\r\nthe house was built.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring, water came up in the bottom of the cellar, and ran out in\r\nlittle hollows made for the purpose, on the surface.\r\n\r\nNot liking this inconvenient wetness, we next dug trenches a few inches\r\ndeep, put boards at the sides to exclude the sand, and packed the\r\ntrenches with small stones. This operated better, but the mice found\r\npleasant accommodations among the stones, and sand got in and choked the\r\npassage. Lastly, tiles came to our relief, and a perfect preventive of\r\nall inconvenient moisture was found, by adopting the following plan:\r\n\r\nThe drain from the cellar was taken up, and relaid 18 inches below the\r\ncellar-bottom, at the outlet. Then a trench was cut in the\r\ncellar-bottom, two feet from the wall, a foot deep at the farthest\r\ncorner from the outlet, and deepening towards it, round the whole\r\ncellar, following the course of the walls. In this trench, two-inch pipe\r\ntiles were laid, and carefully covered with tan-bark, and the trenches\r\nfilled with the earth. This tile drain was connected with the outlet\r\ndrain 18 inches under ground, and the earth levelled over the whole.\r\nThis was done two years ago, and no drop of water has ever been visible\r\nin the cellar since it was completed. The water is caught by the drain\r\nbefore it rises to the surface, and conducted away.\r\n\r\nVegetables of all kinds are now laid in heaps on the cellar-bottom,\r\nwhich is just damp enough to pack solid, and preserves vegetables\r\nbetter, in a dry cellar, than casks, or bins with floors.\r\n\r\nA little sketch of this mode of draining cellars, representing the\r\ncellar referred to, will, perhaps, present the matter more clearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99--DRAINAGE OF CELLAR.]\r\n\r\nMany persons have attempted to exclude water from their cellars by\r\ncementing them on the bottom, and part way up on the sides. This might\r\nsucceed, if the cellar wall were laid very close, and in cement, and a\r\nheavy coating of cement applied to the bottom. A moment's attention to\r\nthe subject will show that it is not likely to succeed, as experience\r\nshows that it seldom, if ever, does.\r\n\r\nThe water which enters cellars, frequently runs from the surface behind\r\nthe cellar wall, where rats always keep open passages, and fills the\r\nground and these passages; especially when the earth is frozen, to the\r\nsurface, thus giving a column of water behind the wall six or eight feet\r\nin height. The pressure of water is always in proportion to its height\r\nor head, without reference to the extent of surface. The pressure, then,\r\nof the water against the cemented wall, would be equal to the pressure\r\nof a full mill-pond against its perpendicular dam of six or eight feet\r\nheight! No sane man would think of tightening a dam, with seven feet\r\nhead of water, by plastering a little cement on the down-stream side of\r\nit, which might as well be done, as to exclude water from a cellar by\r\nthe process, and under the conditions, stated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF BARN CELLARS.\r\n\r\nMost barns in New England are constructed with good substantial cellars,\r\nfrom six to nine feet deep, with solid walls of stone. They serve a\r\nthree-fold purpose; of keeping manure, thrown down from the cattle and\r\nhorse stalls above; of preserving turnips, mangolds, and other\r\nvegetables for the stock; and of storing carts, wagons, and other farm\r\nimplements. Usually, the cellar is divided by stone, brick, or wood\r\npartitions, into apartments, devoted to each of the purposes named. The\r\ncellar for manure should not be wet enough to have water flow away from\r\nit, nor dry enough to have it leach. For the other purposes, a dry\r\ncellar is desirable.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the details of the drainage of a barn cellar on our own\r\npremises, may give our views of the best mode of drainage, both for a\r\nmanure cellar, and for a root and implement cellar. The barn was built\r\nin 1849, on a site sloping slightly to the south. In excavating for the\r\nwall, at about seven feet below the height fixed for the sills, we came\r\nupon a soft, blue clay, so nearly fluid that a ten-foot pole was easily\r\nthrust down out of sight, perpendicularly, into it! Here was a dilemma!\r\nHow could a heavy wall and building stand on that foundation? A skillful\r\nengineer was consulted, who had seen heavy brick blocks built in just\r\nsuch places, and who pronounced this a very simple case to manage. \"If,\"\r\nsaid he, \"the mud cannot get up, the wall resting on it cannot settle\r\ndown.\" Upon this idea, by his advice, we laid our wall, on thick plank,\r\non the clay, so as to get an even bearing, and drove down, against the\r\nface of the wall, edge to edge, two-inch plank to the depth of about\r\nthree feet, leaving them a foot above the bottom of the wall. Against\r\nthis, we rammed coarse gravel very hard, and left the bottom of the\r\ncellar one foot above the bottom of the wall, so that the weight might\r\ncounterbalance the pressure of the wall and building. The building has\r\nbeen in constant use, and appears not to have settled a single inch.\r\n\r\nThe cellar was first used only for manure, and for keeping swine. It was\r\nquite wet, and grew more and more so every year, as the water found\r\npassages into it, till it was found that its use must be abandoned, or\r\nan amphibious race of pigs procured. It was known, that the most of the\r\nwater entered at the north corner of the building, borne up by the clay\r\nwhich comes to within three feet of the natural surface; and, as it\r\nwould be ruinous to the manure to leach it, by drawing a large quantity\r\nof water through it into drains, in the usual mode of draining, it was\r\nconcluded to cut off the water on the outside of the building, and\r\nbefore it reached the cellar. Accordingly, a drain was started at the\r\nriver, some twenty rods below, and carried up to the barn, and then\r\neight feet deep around two sides of it, by the north corner, where most\r\nwater came in.\r\n\r\nWe cut through the sand, and four or five feet into the clay, and laid\r\none course only of two-inch pipe-tiles at the bottom. As this was\r\ndesigned for a catch-water, and not merely to take in water at the\r\nbottom, in the usual way, we filled the trench, after covering the tiles\r\nwith tan, with coarse sand above the level of the clay, and put clay\r\nupon the top. We believe no water has ever crossed this drain, which\r\noperates as perfectly as an open ditch, to catch all that flows upon it.\r\nThe manure cellar was then dry enough, but the other cellar was wanted\r\nfor roots and implements, and the water was constantly working up\r\nthrough the soft clay bottom, keeping it of the consistency of mortar,\r\nand making it difficult to haul out the manure, and everyway\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nOne more effort was made to dry this part. A drain was opened from the\r\nhighway, which passes the barn, to the south corner; and about two and a\r\nhalf feet below the bottom of the cellar, along inside the wall, at\r\nabout three feet distance from it, on two of the sides; and another in\r\nthe same way, across the middle of the cellar. These, laid with two-inch\r\ntiles, and filled with gravel, were connected together, and led off to\r\nthe wayside. The waste water of two watering places, one in the cellar,\r\nand another outside, supplied by an aqueduct, was conducted into the\r\ntiles, and thus quietly disposed of. The reason why the drains are\r\nfilled with gravel is, that as the soft clay, in which the tiles were\r\nlaid, could never have the heat of the direct rays of the sun on its\r\nsurface, there might be no cracking of it, sufficient to afford passage\r\nfor the water, and so this was made a catch-water to stop any water that\r\nmight attempt to cross it.\r\n\r\nThe work was finished last Autumn, and we have had but the experience of\r\na single season with it; but we are satisfied that the object is\r\nattained. The surface of the implement cellar, which before, had been\r\nalways soft and muddy, has ever since been as dry and solid as a highway\r\nin Summer; and the root cellar, which has a cemented bottom, is as dry\r\nas the barn floor. The manure can now be teamed out, without leaving a\r\nrut, and we are free to confess, that the effect is greater than we had\r\ndeemed possible.\r\n\r\nThe following cut will show at a glance, how all the drains are laid,\r\nthe dotted lines representing the tile drains:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\nThe drain outside the barn, on the right, leads from a spring, some two\r\nhundred feet off, into the cellar and into the yard, and supplies water\r\nto the cattle, at the points indicated. The waste water is then\r\nconducted into the drains, and passes off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF SWAMPS.\r\n\r\n     Vast Extent of Swamp Lands in the United States.--Their\r\n     Soil.--Sources of their Moisture.--How to Drain them.--The Soil\r\n     Subsides by Draining.--Catch-water Drains.--Springs.--Mr. Ruffin's\r\n     Drainage in Virginia.--Is there Danger of Over-draining?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost, if not quite every State, extensive tracts of swamp lands are\r\nfound, not only unfit, in their natural condition, for cultivation, but,\r\nin many instances, by reason of obnoxious effluvia, arising from\r\nstagnant water, dangerous to health.\r\n\r\nOf the vast extent of such lands, some idea may be formed, by adverting\r\nto the fact, that under the grants by Congress, of the public lands\r\ngiven away to the States in which they lie, as of no value to the\r\nGovernment and as nuisances to their neighborhood, in their natural\r\ncondition; sixty millions of acres, it is estimated, will be included.\r\n\r\nThese are only the public lands, and in the new States. In every\r\ntownship in New England, there are hundreds of acres of swamp land, just\r\nbeginning to be brought to the notice of their owners, as of sufficient\r\nvalue to authorize the expense of drainage.\r\n\r\nTo say that these swamps are the most fertile and the most valuable\r\nlands in New England, is but to repeat the assertion of all who have\r\nsuccessfully tried the experiment of reclaiming them.\r\n\r\nIn their natural state, these swamps are usually covered with a heavy\r\ngrowth of timber; but the greater portion of them have been partially\r\ncleared, and many of them are mowed, producing a coarse, wild, and\r\nnearly worthless grass.\r\n\r\nThe soil of these tracts is usually a black mud or peat, partly the\r\nproduct of vegetable growth and decay on the spot, and partly the\r\ndeposit of the lighter portion of the upland soil, brought down by the\r\nwashing of showers, and by spring freshets. The leaves of the\r\nsurrounding forest, too, are naturally dropped by the Autumn winds into\r\nthe lowest places, and these swamps have received them, for ages.\r\nUsually, these lands lie in basins among the hills, sometimes along the\r\nbanks of streams and rivers, always at the lowest level of the country,\r\nand not, like Irish bogs, upon hill-tops, as well as elsewhere. Their\r\nsurface is, usually, level and even, as compared with other lands in the\r\nold States. Their soil, or deposit, is of various depth, from one foot\r\nto twenty, and is often almost afloat with water, so as to shake under\r\nthe feet, in walking over it.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil corresponds, in general, with that of the surrounding\r\ncountry, but is oftener of sand than clay, and not unfrequently, is of\r\nvarious thin strata, indicating an alluvial formation. Frogs and snakes\r\nfind in these swamps an agreeable residence, and wild beasts a safe\r\nretreat from their common foe. Notoriously, such lands are unhealthful,\r\nproducing fevers and agues in their neighborhood, often traceable to\r\ntracts no larger than a very few acres.\r\n\r\nIn considering how to drain such tracts, the first inquiry is as to the\r\nsource of the water. What makes the land too wet? Is it the direct fall\r\nof rain upon it; the influx of water by visible streams, which have no\r\nsufficient outlet; the downflow of rain and snow water from the\r\nneighboring hills; or the bursting up of springs from below?\r\n\r\nExamine and decide, which and how many, of these four sources of\r\nmoisture, contribute to flood the tract in question. We assume, that the\r\nswamp is in a basin, or, at least, is the lowest land of the\r\nneighborhood. The three or four feet of rain water annually falling upon\r\nit, unless it have an outlet, must make it a swamp, for there can\r\nusually be no natural drainage downward, because the swamp itself is the\r\nlowest spot, and no adjacent land can draw off water from its bottom. Of\r\ncourse, there is lower land towards the natural outlet, but usually this\r\nis narrow, and quite insufficient to allow of drainage by lateral\r\npercolation. Then, always, more or less water must run upon the surface,\r\nor just below it, from the hills, and usually, a stream is found in the\r\nswamp, if none pours into it from above.\r\n\r\nThe first step is a survey, to ascertain the fall over the whole, and\r\nthe next, to provide a deep and sufficient outlet. Here, we must bear in\r\nmind a peculiarity of such lands. All land subsides, more or less, by\r\ndrainage, but the soils of which we are speaking, far more than any\r\nother. Marsh and swamp lands often subside, or _settle_, one or two\r\nfeet, or even more. Their soil, of fibrous roots, decayed leaves, and\r\nthe like, almost floats; or, at least, expands like a sponge; and when\r\nit is compacted, by removing the water, it occupies far less space than\r\nbefore. This fact must be kept in mind in all the process. The outlet\r\nmust be made low enough, and the drains must be made deep enough, to\r\ndraw the water, after the subsidence of the soil to its lowest point.\r\n\r\nIf a natural stream flow through, or from, the tract, it will usually\r\nindicate the lowest level; and the straightening and clearing out of\r\nthis natural drain, may usually be the first operation, after opening a\r\nproper outlet. Then a catch-water open drain, just at the junction of\r\nthe high and low land, entirely round the swamp, will be necessary to\r\nintercept the water flowing into the swamp. This water will usually be\r\nfound to flow in, both on the surface, and beneath it, and in greater or\r\nless quantities, according to the formation of the adjacent land. This\r\ncatch-water is essential to success. The wettest spot in a swamp is\r\nfrequently, just at its edge, because there the surface-water is\r\nreceived, and because there too, the water that has come down on an\r\nimpervious subsoil stratum, finds vent. It is in vain to attempt to lay\r\ndry a swamp, by drains, however deep, through its centre. The water has\r\ndone its mischief, before it reaches the centre. It should be\r\nintercepted, before it has entered the tract, to be reclaimed.\r\n\r\nThis drain must be deep, and therefore, must be wide and sloping, so\r\nthat it may be kept open; and it should be curved round, following the\r\nline of the upland to the outlet. Often it has been found, in England,\r\nthat a single drain, six or eight feet deep, has completely drained a\r\ntract of twenty or thirty acres, by cutting off all the sources of the\r\nsupply of water, except that from the clouds. This kind of land is very\r\nporous and permeable, and readily parts with its water, and is easily\r\ndrained; so that the frequent drains necessary on uplands, are often\r\nquite unnecessary. Many instances are given, of the effect of single\r\ndeep drains through such tracts, in lowering the water in wells, or\r\nentirely drying them, at considerable distances from the field of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface-water and shallow springs have thus been cut off, the\r\ndrainer will soon be able to determine, whether he has effected a cure\r\nof his dropsical patient. Often it will be found, that deep seated\r\nsprings burst up in the middle of these low tracts, furnishing good and\r\npure water for use. These, being supplied by high and distant fountains,\r\nrun under our deepest drains, and find vent through some fracture of the\r\nsubsoil. They diffuse their ice-cold water through the soil, and prevent\r\nthe growth of all valuable vegetation. To these, we must apply\r\nElkington's system, and hit them _right in the eye_! by running a deep\r\ndrain from some side or central drain, straight to them, and drawing off\r\nthe water low enough beneath the surface to prevent injury. A small\r\ncovered drain with two-inch pipes, will usually be sufficient to afford\r\nan outlet to any such spring.\r\n\r\nWhen we have thus disposed of the water from the surface-flow, the\r\nshallow springs and the deep springs, and given vent to the water\r\naccumulated and ponded in the low places, we have then accomplished all\r\nthat is peculiar to this kind of drainage. We have still the water from\r\nthe clouds, which is twice as much as will evaporate from a\r\nland-surface, to provide for. We assume that this cannot pass directly\r\ndown by percolation, because the subsoil is already saturated; and\r\ntherefore, even if all the other sources of wetness are cut off, we\r\nshall still have a tract of land too wet for wheat and corn. If the\r\nswamp be very small, these main ditches may sufficiently drain it; but\r\nif it be extensive, they probably will not. We have seen that we have\r\nsome eighteen or twenty inches of water to be disposed of by drainage;\r\nso much that evaporation cannot remove consistently with good\r\ncultivation; and, although this amount might, in a very deep peaty soil,\r\npercolate to a great distance laterally, to find a drain, yet in shallow\r\nsoil resting on a retentive subsoil, drains might be necessary at\r\ndistances similar to those adopted on wet upland fields. To this part of\r\nthe operation, we should, therefore, apply the ordinary principles of\r\ndrainage, putting in covered drains with tiles, if possible, at four\r\nfeet depth or more, ordinarily, and at distances of from forty to sixty\r\nfeet, although four-foot drains at even one hundred feet distance, in\r\npeat and black mud, might often be found sufficient.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Edmund Ruffin, Esq., of Virginia, we have been\r\nfurnished with three elaborate and valuable essays, on the drainage and\r\ntreatment of flat and wet lands in lower Virginia and North Carolina,\r\npublished in the Transactions of the Virginia State Agricultural\r\nSociety, for 1857. The principal feature of his system is based upon his\r\ncorrect knowledge of the geological formation of that district; of the\r\nfact in particular, that, underlying the whole of that low country,\r\nthere is a bed of pure sand lying nearly level, and filled with water,\r\nwhich may be drawn down by a few large deep drains, thus relieving the\r\nsurface-soil of surplus water, by comprehensive but simple means.\r\n\r\nWe have before referred to Mr. Ruffin as the publisher, more than twenty\r\nyears ago, of \"Elkington's Theory and Practice of Draining, &c., by\r\nJohnstone;\" and we find in his recent essays, evidence of how thoroughly\r\npractical he has made the system of Elkington in his own State. Indeed,\r\nwe know of no other American writer who records any instance of marked\r\nsuccess in the use of Elkington's peculiar idea of releasing pent up\r\nwaters by boring. Mr. Ruffin, however, has applied, with great success,\r\nthis principle of operation, to the saturated sand-beds which underlie\r\nthe tracts of low land in his district of country. These water-beds in\r\nthe sand lie at depths varying usually from four to eight feet below the\r\nsurface. This surface stratum is comparatively compact, and very slowly\r\npervious to water before it is drained. The water from below, is\r\nconstantly pressing slowly up through it, of course preventing any\r\ndownward percolation of the rain-water. By running deep drains at wide\r\nintervals, and boring down through this surface stratum with an auger,\r\nthe pent up water below finds vent and gushes up in copious springs\r\nthrough the holes, and flows off without coming nearer to the surface\r\nthan the bottom of the drains; thus relieving the pressure upward, and\r\nlowering the water-line in proportion to the depth of the drains.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruffin gives an instance of the drying up of a well half a mile\r\ndistant, by cutting a deep drain into this sand-bed, and thus lowering\r\nits water-line.\r\n\r\nNo doubt in many localities in our country, a competent geological\r\nknowledge may detect formations where this principle of drainage may be\r\napplied with perfect success, and with great economy.\r\n\r\n_Is there danger of over-draining swamp lands?_ In speaking of the\r\ninjury by drainage, we have treated of this question.\r\n\r\nOur conclusions may be briefly stated here. There is an impression among\r\nEnglish writers, that light peaty soils may be too much drained; but\r\nmany distinguished drainers doubt the proposition. No doubt there are\r\nsoils too porous and light to be productive, when first drained. They\r\nmay require a season or two to become compact, and may require sand, or\r\nclay, or gravel, to give them the requisite density; but these soils\r\nwould, we believe, be usually unproductive if shallow drained.\r\n\r\nIn short, our idea is, that, in general, a soil so constituted as to be\r\nproductive under any circumstances, will retain, by attraction, moisture\r\nenough for the crops, though intersected by four-foot drains at usual\r\ndistances; and that cold water pumped up to the roots from a stagnant\r\npool at the bottom, is not, either in nature or art, a successful method\r\nof irrigation.\r\n\r\nStill we believe that peaty soils may be usually drained at greater\r\ndistances, or by shallower drains, than most uplands, because of their\r\nmore porous nature; and we should advise inexperienced persons not to\r\nproceed with a lavish expenditure of labor to put in parallel drains at\r\nshort distances, till they have watched, for a season, the operation of\r\na cheaper system. They may thus attain the desired object, with the\r\nsmallest expense. If the first drains are judiciously placed, and are\r\nfound insufficient, others may be laid between the first, until the\r\ndrainage is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN EXPERIMENTS IN DRAINAGE--DRAINAGE IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n     Statement of B. F. Nourse, of Maine.--Statement of Shedd and Edson,\r\n     of Mass.--Statement of H. F. French, of New Hampshire.--Letter of\r\n     Wm. Boyle, Albert Model Farm, Glasnevin, Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was part of the original plan of this work, to give a large number of\r\nstatements from American farmers of their success in drainage; but,\r\nalthough the instances are abundant, want of space limits us to a few.\r\nThese are given with such diagrams as will not only make them\r\nintelligible, but, it is hoped, will also furnish good examples of the\r\narrangement and modes of executing drains, and of laying them down upon\r\nplans for future reference. The mode adopted by Shedd and Edson, of\r\nindicating the size of the pipes used, by the number of dots in the\r\nlines of drains, is original and convenient. It will be seen by close\r\nattention, that a two-inch pipe is denoted by dots in pairs, a\r\nthree-inch pipe by dots in threes, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that Mr. Nourse's experiment is one of the most thorough\r\nand successful works of drainage yet executed in America. His plan is\r\nupon page 195.\r\n\r\n     STATEMENT OF B. F. NOURSE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                       GOODALES CORNER, ORRINGTON, ME.,\r\n                                              Sept. 1st, 1858.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--So much depends upon the preliminary surveys and\r\n     \"levels\" for conducting works of thorough-draining and irrigation\r\n     cheaply, yet to obtain the most beneficial results, that a\r\n     competent person, such as an engineer or practiced land-drainer,\r\n     should be employed to make them, if one can be obtained.\r\n     Unfortunately for me, when I began this operation, some years ago,\r\n     there were no such skilled persons in the country, or I could learn\r\n     of none professionally such, and was forced to do my own\r\n     engineering. Having thus practically acquired some knowledge of it,\r\n     I use and enjoy a Summer vacation from other pursuits, in the\r\n     prosecution of this; and this employment, for the last few weeks,\r\n     has delayed my answer to your inquiries. Nor could I sooner arrive\r\n     at the figures of cost, extent, &c., of this season's work.\r\n\r\n     This is expected to be completed in ten days, and then I shall have\r\n     laid, of\r\n\r\n     Stone drains, including mains          702 rods\r\n     Tile drains (two inches, or larger)   1043  \"\r\n                                           ----\r\n     In all                                1745  \"\r\n\r\n     or, about five and one-half miles, laying dry, _satisfactorily_,\r\n     about thirty-five acres. The character and extent of the work will\r\n     better appear by reference to the plan of the farm which I send\r\n     with this for your inspection.\r\n\r\n     The earlier portion was fairly described by the Committee of the\r\n     Bangor Hort. Soc.--(See Report, for 1856, of the Maine Board of\r\n     Agriculture.) It was far too costly, as usual in works of a novel\r\n     character conducted without practical knowledge. No part of my\r\n     draining, even that of this season, has been done so cheaply as it\r\n     ought to be done in Maine, and will be done when tiles can be\r\n     bought at fair prices near at hand. I call your attention\r\n     particularly to this, because the magnitude of the cost, as I\r\n     represent it, ought not to be taken as a necessary average, or\r\n     standard outlay per acre, by any one contemplating similar\r\n     improvement, when almost any farmer can accomplish it equally well\r\n     at far less cost. My unnecessary expenditures will not have been in\r\n     vain, if they serve as a finger-post to point others in a\r\n     profitable way.\r\n\r\n     My land had upon its surface, and mingled in its super soil, a\r\n     large quantity of stones, various in size, from the huge boulders,\r\n     requiring several blasts of powder to reduce them to movable size,\r\n     to the rubble stones which were shoveled from the cart into the\r\n     drains. To make clean fields all these had to be removed, besides\r\n     the many \"heaps\" which had been accumulated by the industry of my\r\n     predecessors. A tile-drain needs no addition of stone above the\r\n     pipe; indeed, the stone may be a positive injury, as harboring\r\n     field vermin, or, if allowed to come within two feet of the\r\n     surface, as obstructing deep tillage, and favoring the access of\r\n     particles of soil upon or into the tile with the rapid access of\r\n     water which they promote. Carefully placed to the depth of six or\r\n     eight inches in a four-foot drain, quite small stones are, perhaps,\r\n     useful, and they certainly facilitate the drawing of water from the\r\n     surface. Such was, and still is, with many, the prescribed method\r\n     of best drainage in Scotland, and some parts of England. The\r\n     increased cost of adding the stone above the tile is obvious; and\r\n     when the width of that drain is enlarged to receive them, the cost\r\n     is materially enhanced. Yet such has been my practice, at first,\r\n     under the impression of its necessity, and all the time from a\r\n     desire to put to use, and out of sight, the small stones with which\r\n     I was favored in such abundance. The entire cost of moving, and\r\n     bringing more than 2,500 heavy loads of stone, is included in the\r\n     cost of drains, as set down for the 1,745 rods.\r\n\r\n     Including this part of expense, which is never _necessary_ with\r\n     tile, and cannot be incurred in plain clay soils, or clay loams\r\n     free of stones, the last 700 rods cost an average of 97 cents per\r\n     rod completed. This includes the largest mains; of which, one of 73\r\n     rods was opened four feet wide at bottom of the trench, of which\r\n     the channel capacity is 18 × 18 = 324 square inches, and others 110\r\n     rods of three and one-half and three feet width at bottom, all\r\n     these mains being laid entirely with stone. The remainder of the\r\n     700 rods was laid with two-inch tile, which cost at the farm\r\n     eighteen dollars per 1,000. These last were opened four rods apart,\r\n     and lay dry about seventeen acres, at a cost, including the mains,\r\n     of $678, or $40 per acre. In this is included every day's labor of\r\n     man and beast, and all the incidental expenses, nothing being\r\n     contributed by the farm, which is under lease.\r\n\r\n     I infer that an intelligent farmer, beginning aright, and availing\r\n     himself of the use of team and farm labor, when they can best be\r\n     spared from other work--as in the dry season, after haying--or\r\n     paying fair prices for digging his ditches only, and doing the rest\r\n     of the work from the farm, can drain thoroughly at a cost of $20\r\n     per acre, drains four rods apart, and four feet deep; or at $25 per\r\n     acre, forty feet apart, and three feet nine inches deep.\r\n\r\n     My subsoil is very hard, requiring constant use of the pick, and\r\n     sharpening of the picks every day, so that the labor of loosening\r\n     the earth was one-third or one-half more than the throwing out with\r\n     a shovel. The price paid per rod, for opening only, to the depth of\r\n     three and a half feet (or, perhaps, three and three-quarters\r\n     average,) of a width for laying tile, was 25 cents per rod. At this\r\n     price, the industrious men, skillful with tools, earned $1.12 to\r\n     $1.25 per day, besides board; and they threw out one-third more\r\n     earth than was really necessary, for \"room to work\" as they said.\r\n     _But they labored hard, 14 hours per day._ The same men, working in\r\n     a soil free from stones, and an easier subsoil, would, in the same\r\n     time, open from 50 to 100 per cent. more length of ditch.\r\n\r\n     The greater part of these drains were laid four rods apart. When\r\n     first trying this distance upon a field, of which the soil was\r\n     called \"springy and cold,\" and was always too wet in the Spring and\r\n     early Summer for plowing, a partial, rather than \"thorough\"\r\n     drainage was attempted, with the design, at some future day, to lay\r\n     intermediate drains. The execution of that design may yet appear\r\n     expedient, although the condition of soil already obtained, is\r\n     satisfactory beyond expectation.\r\n\r\n     Owing to the excess of water that saturated the soil in Spring and\r\n     Fall, the former proprietors of the farm had not attempted the\r\n     cultivation of the field alluded to, for many years. Originally\r\n     producing heavy crops of hay, it had been mowed for thirty years or\r\n     more, and was a good specimen of \"exhausted land,\" yielding\r\n     one-half or three-fourths of a ton of hay per acre. This field is\r\n     designated in the plan, as the \"barley field, 1858,\" lies\r\n     south-west of the dwelling-house, and contains nearly six acres.\r\n     Its northerly half, being the lower end of the field, was drained\r\n     in 1855, having been Summer-plowed, and sowed with buckwheat, which\r\n     was turned under, when in flower, as a fallow crop. The other half\r\n     was drained in 1856; plowed and subsoiled the same Fall. In 1857,\r\n     nearly the whole field was planted with roots--potatoes, rutabagas,\r\n     mangolds, carrots, English turnips, &c.--and one acre in corn. For\r\n     these crops, fair dressings of manure were applied--say ten or\r\n     twelve cartloads of barn-manure plowed in, and one hundred pounds\r\n     of either guano or bone-dust harrowed in, or strewed in the drill,\r\n     for each acre; about fifteen loads per acre of seasoned muck or\r\n     peat were also plowed in. There was a good yield of all the roots;\r\n     for the corn, the season was unfavorable. Last Spring, a light\r\n     dressing of manure, but all that we could afford, was applied, the\r\n     whole well ploughed, harrowed, seeded to grass with barley,\r\n     harrowed, and rolled. The barley was taken off last week; and, from\r\n     the five and three-quarter acres, seventeen heavy loads were hauled\r\n     into the barn, each estimated to exceed a ton in weight. The grain\r\n     from a measured acre was put apart to be separately threshed, and I\r\n     will advise of its yield when ascertained.[A] This was said, by the\r\n     many farmers who saw it, including some from the Western States,\r\n     to be the \"handsomest field of grain\" they had ever seen. The young\r\n     grass looks well; and I hope, next Summer, to report a good cut of\r\n     \"hay from drained land.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote A: This was threshed about the middle of November, and\r\n     yielded \"51 bushels, round measure.\" The entire field averaged 45\r\n     bushels per acre.]\r\n\r\n     Last Winter, there were no snows to cover the ground for sleighing\r\n     until March; and, lying uncovered, our fields were all frozen to an\r\n     unusual depth. But, _our drains did not cease to run through the\r\n     Winter_. And Mr. O. W. Straw, who works the farm, and was requested\r\n     to note the facts accurately, wrote to me this Spring, \"the frost\r\n     came out of the drained land about one week first\" (that is,\r\n     earlier than from the undrained land adjacent); and, \"in regard to\r\n     working condition, the drained land was in advance of the\r\n     undrained, ten days, at least.\" The absence of snow permitting this\r\n     unusual depth of frost, had caused a rare equality of condition the\r\n     last Spring, because, until the frost was out, the drains would not\r\n     draw surface-water. Usually, when early snows have fallen to\r\n     protect the ground, and it remains covered through the Winter, the\r\n     frost goes off with the snow, _or earlier_, and, within a few days,\r\n     the land becomes in good condition for plowing--quite two weeks\r\n     earlier than the driest of my undrained fields, or any others in\r\n     the vicinity.\r\n\r\n     These remarks apply to land in which the drains are four rods\r\n     apart. The farm lies with an inclination northerly and easterly,\r\n     the fall varying from 1 in 33 to 1 in 8; that in most of the drains\r\n     laid four rods apart, being about 1 in 25. The drains in the\r\n     \"barley field\" fall 1 in 27, average, all affording a rapid run of\r\n     water, which, from the mode of construction, and subsequent\r\n     subsoiling, finds ready access to the drain-channels. Hence, we\r\n     never observe running water upon the surface of any of our drained\r\n     lands, either during the heaviest rains, or when snows are melting,\r\n     and the wasteful \"washing\" from the surface that formerly injured\r\n     our plowed grounds, has ceased.\r\n\r\n     It is fair to suppose that it is the considerable descent which\r\n     renders the drains so effectual at four rods apart; and that where\r\n     there is but slight fall, other circumstances being the same, it\r\n     would be necessary to lay drains much nearer, for equal service.\r\n\r\n     The results of one man's experiments, or practice, whether of\r\n     success or failure, should not be conclusive to another, unless all\r\n     the circumstances are identical. These are ever varying from one\r\n     farm to another; and only a right understanding of the natural laws\r\n     or principles brought into use, can determine what is best in each\r\n     case. Therefore, a description of the methods I have used, or any\r\n     detailed suggestions I may give, as the result of experience, would\r\n     not be worth much, unless tested by the well-ascertained rules\r\n     applicable to them, which men of science and skill have adopted\r\n     and proved, by the immensely extended draining operations in Great\r\n     Britain, and those begun in this country. These are now given in\r\n     elaborate treatises, and quoted in agricultural journals. But they\r\n     should be made familiar to every farmer, in all their practical\r\n     details, and with methods suited to our country, where labor is\r\n     dear and land cheap, as contrasted with the reversed conditions in\r\n     England, where the practice of \"thorough-draining\" has so generally\r\n     obtained, and has so largely improved the conditions of both\r\n     landlord and tenant. Your book will do this, and thus do a great\r\n     good; for draining will greatly enlarge the productive capacity of\r\n     our land, and, consequently, its value, while it will render labor\r\n     more effective and more remunerative to the employer and the\r\n     employed.\r\n\r\n     The fact of increased production from a given quantity of land, by\r\n     draining, being ascertained beyond question, and the measure of\r\n     that increase, at its minimum, being more than the interest at six\r\n     per cent. upon the sum required to effect it--even at $50 per\r\n     acre--the question of expediency is answered. To the owner of\r\n     tillage lands there is no other such safe, sure, and profitable\r\n     investment for his money. He lodges it in a bank that will never\r\n     suspend payments, and from which better than six per cent. dividend\r\n     can be received annually.\r\n\r\n                         Very truly, yours,                B.

P. Rand, of\r\n     Roxbury.\r\n\r\n     An outfall was obtained, at the expense of considerable labor, by\r\n     deepening the Roxbury and Dorchester Brook for a distance of nearly\r\n     a quarter of a mile, about four hundred feet of which was through a\r\n     rocky bottom, which required some blasting. The fall thus obtained\r\n     was only about two inches in the whole distance.\r\n\r\n     The fall which can be obtained for the main drain is less than two\r\n     inches per hundred feet, but the lateral drains entering into the\r\n     main, will have a fall varying from two inches to a foot per\r\n     hundred.\r\n\r\n     The contour lines, or lines traced along the ground, intersecting\r\n     points on an equal level, are drawn on this plan, showing a fall of\r\n     four-tenths of a foot, each line being in every part four-tenths of\r\n     a foot lower than the line above it. Where the lines are near\r\n     together, the fall is greater, as a less horizontal distance is\r\n     passed over before reaching a point which is four-tenths lower than\r\n     the line above.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Thorough Drainage BY SHEDD & EDSON. AGR'L ENG'S\r\n     BOSTON, 1859]\r\n\r\n     It will be seen by the plan, that the fall in the line occupied by\r\n     the main drain is very slight, while the side drains have a fall\r\n     much greater.\r\n\r\n     The lateral drains are run in the line of steepest descent, which\r\n     is, of course, at right angles to the general direction of the\r\n     contour lines.\r\n\r\n     The water from the entire system is collected, and escapes at one\r\n     outlet into the brook.\r\n\r\n     A peep hole is placed at the intersection of the sub-main drain\r\n     with the main, which commands about one-half the entire area--the\r\n     other, half is commanded by the outlet.\r\n\r\n     Two-inch tile will be laid in the lateral drains, and three, four,\r\n     and five-inch in the sub-main and main.\r\n\r\n     It is quite indispensable, to the successful execution of a plan of\r\n     drainage on land so level as this, that careful measurements be\r\n     made on the ground with an engineer's level, and such a\r\n     representation of its surface projected as will show to the eye at\r\n     a glance what all the natural inclinations are. The work can then\r\n     be laid out with ease in the best position, and executed in a\r\n     systematic manner. The time and labor which is devoted to such an\r\n     examination of the ground is well spent, and, with the knowledge\r\n     gained by it, the work can be carried on with such economy as to\r\n     save the original cost of the examination many times over.\r\n\r\n     Very truly, yours,\r\n                                                        SHEDD & EDSON\r\n     Hon. H. F. FRENCH, Exeter, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n     STATEMENT OF HENRY F. FRENCH, OF EXETER, N. H.\r\n\r\n     The drained field represented in the plan (Fig. 102), contains\r\n     about eight acres. I purchased it in 1846. The upper part of it is\r\n     sand, with underlying clay at depths of from four to ten feet. The\r\n     field slopes towards the river, and, on the slope, the clay strata\r\n     coming out to the surface, naturally bring out the water, so that\r\n     the side hill was so wet as to produce cranberries--quite too wet\r\n     for any hoed crop. At the foot of the hill the soil is a stiff\r\n     clay, with veins of sand and gravel. Through the centre was a wet\r\n     ravine, which served as a natural outlet for the springs, and which\r\n     was so full of black alders as to make an excellent cover for\r\n     woodcock. Until the land was drained, this ravine was impassable in\r\n     the hay season even, except by a bridge which I built across it.\r\n     Now it may be crossed at any season and at any point.\r\n\r\n     I first attempted to drain the wettest parts with brush drains,\r\n     running them into the wet places merely, and succeeded in drying\r\n     the land sufficiently to afford good crops of hay. I laid one\r\n     brush-drain across the brow of the hill, five feet deep, hoping to\r\n     cut off all the water, which I supposed ran along upon the surface\r\n     of the clay. This dried the land for a few rods, but the water\r\n     still ruined the lower parts of the field, and the drain produced\r\n     very little effect upon the land above it. In 1856, finding my\r\n     brush drains quite insufficient, I thorough-drained the side-hill\r\n     on the lower part of the plan at the reader's left hand, at fifty\r\n     feet distances, up and down the slope, at an average of about four\r\n     feet depth, going five feet deep on the brow of the hill, to cut\r\n     through the brush-drain. I used two-inch sole-tiles for minors, and\r\n     three-inch for the main.\r\n\r\n     The effect was instantaneous. The land which, in the Spring of\r\n     1856, had been so wet that it could not, even though partially\r\n     drained with brush-drains, be planted till the 5th of June, was, in\r\n     1857, ready to work as soon as the snow was off. My farm journal\r\n     says, under date of April 6th, \"plowed drained land with double\r\n     plow two days after a heavy storm--dry enough.\" I spent that Summer\r\n     in Europe. The land was planted with corn, which produced a heavy\r\n     crop. I find an entry in my journal, on my return, \"My drained land\r\n     has been in good condition--neither too wet nor too dry--all\r\n     Summer.\"\r\n\r\n     In the Fall of 1857, I laid about 170 rods in other parts of the\r\n     field, at similar depths and distances, and in 1858 completed the\r\n     upper part, on which is an orchard of apple trees. A part of this\r\n     orchard was originally so wet as to kill the trees the first year,\r\n     but by brush-drains I dried it enough to keep the next set alive.\r\n     There was no water visible at the surface, and the land was dry\r\n     enough for corn and potatoes; still the trees looked badly, and\r\n     many were winter-killed. I had learned the formation of the earth\r\n     about my premises, of which I had at first no adequate conception,\r\n     and was satisfied that no fruit tree could flourish with its feet\r\n     in cold water, even in Winter. All nursery-men and fruit-growers\r\n     agree, that land must be well drained for fruit. I therefore laid\r\n     four-foot tile drains between the rows of trees, in this apparently\r\n     dry sand. We found abundance of water, in the driest season, at\r\n     four feet, and it has never ceased to flow copiously.\r\n\r\n     I measured accurately the discharge of water from the main which\r\n     receives the drainage of about one and a half acres of the orchard,\r\n     at a time when it gave, what seemed to me an average quantity for\r\n     the Winter months, when the earth was frozen solid, and found it to\r\n     be about 480 barrels per day! The estimate was made by holding a\r\n     bucket, which contained ten quarts, under the outlet, when it was\r\n     found that it would fill in fifteen seconds, equal to ten gallons\r\n     per minute; and six hundred gallons, or twenty barrels per hour,\r\n     and four hundred and eighty barrels per day.\r\n\r\n     I have seen the same drain discharge at least four times that\r\n     quantity, at some times! The peep-holes give opportunity for\r\n     inspection, and I find the result to be, that the water-table is\r\n     kept down four feet below the surface at all times, except for a\r\n     day or two after severe rain-storms.\r\n\r\n     There is an apparent want of system in this plan, partly to be\r\n     attributed to my desire to conform somewhat to the line of the\r\n     fences, and partly to the conformation of the land, which is quite\r\n     uneven. At several points near the ravine, springs broke out,\r\n     apparently from deep fountains, and short drains were run into\r\n     them, to keep them below the surface.\r\n\r\n     The general result has been, to convert wet land into early warm\r\n     soil, fit for a garden, to render my place more dry and healthful,\r\n     and to illustrate for the good of the community the entire\r\n     efficiency of tile-drainage. The cost of this work throughout, I\r\n     estimate at fifty cents per rod, reckoning labor at $1 per day, and\r\n     tiles at $12 per thousand, and all the work by hand-tools. I think\r\n     in a few years, we may do the same work at one-half this cost.\r\n     Further views on this point are given in the chapter on the \"Cost\r\n     of Drainage.\"\r\n\r\nAfter our work was in press, we received from Mr. William Boyle, Farmer\r\nat the Albert Model Farm in Ireland, the paper which is given below,\r\nkindly sent in reply to a series of questions proposed by the author.\r\nThe Albert Model Farm is one of the Government institutions for the\r\npromotion of agriculture, by the education of young men in the science\r\nand the practice of farming; and from what was apparent, by a single\r\nday's examination of the establishment in our visit to it in August,\r\n1857, we are satisfied of its entire success. The crops then growing\r\nwere equal, if not superior, to any we have seen in any country. Much of\r\nthe land covered by those crops is drained land; and having confidence\r\nthat the true principles of drainage for that country must be taught and\r\npracticed at this institution, we thought it might be instructive, as\r\nwell as interesting to the farmers of America, to give them the means of\r\ncomparison between the system there approved, and those others which we\r\nhave described.\r\n\r\nHad the paper been sooner received, we should have referred to it\r\nearlier in our book; yet coming as it does, after our work was mostly in\r\ntype, we confess to some feeling of satisfaction, at the substantial\r\ncoincidence of views entertained at the Albert Model Farm, with our own\r\nhumble teachings. With many thanks to Mr. Boyle for his valuable letter,\r\nwhich we commend to our readers as a reliable exposition of the most\r\napproved principles of land-draining for Ireland, we give the paper\r\nentire:\r\n\r\n                                 ALBERT MODEL FARM, Glasnevin, Dublin,\r\n                                                        January 31, 1859.\r\n\r\n     To the Hon. HENRY F. FRENCH, Exeter, N. H.:\r\n\r\n     SIR:--Your queries on land-drainage have been too long unanswered.\r\n     I have now great pleasure in sending you, herewith, my views on the\r\n     points noted. * * *\r\n\r\n     Pray excuse me for the delay in writing. I am, sir,\r\n\r\n                Your obliged and obedient servant,         WILLIAM BOYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LAND DRAINAGE--REPLIES TO QUERIES, ETC.\r\n\r\n     _Introductory observations._ Ireland contains close on to\r\n     twenty-one millions of acres, thirteen and a half millions of which\r\n     were returned as \"arable land,\" in 1841. By \"Arterial\" and\r\n     thorough-drainage, &c., effected through loans granted by\r\n     government, the extent of arable land has been increased to fifteen\r\n     and a half millions of acres. The \"Board of Works\" has the\r\n     management of the funds granted for drainage and land improvements\r\n     generally, and competent inspectors are appointed to see that the\r\n     works are properly executed. The proprietor, or farmer, who obtains\r\n     a loan may, if competent, claim and obtain the appointment of\r\n     overseer on his own property, and thus have an opportunity of\r\n     economically expending the sum which he will have to repay\r\n     (principal and interest) by twenty-two installments. The average\r\n     cost of thorough-drainage, under the Board of Works, has been about\r\n     £5 per statute acre. In 1847, when government granted the first\r\n     loan for land-drainage, tiles were not so easily obtained as at\r\n     present, nor was tile-drainage well understood in this country; and\r\n     the greater part of the drains then made--and for some years\r\n     after--were either sewered with stones, formed into a conduit of\r\n     various dimensions, and covered over with finely-broken stones, or\r\n     the latter were filled into the bottom of the drain, to about one\r\n     foot in depth, as recommended by Smith, of Deanston. The\r\n     dimensions for minor drains, sewered with stones, were, usually,\r\n     three and a half feet deep, fifteen inches wide at top, and three\r\n     to four inches wide at bottom (distance apart being twenty-one\r\n     feet); and the overseer carried about with him a wooden gauge, of a\r\n     size to correspond, so that the workmen could see at a glance what\r\n     they had to do. These drains are reported to have given general\r\n     satisfaction; and they were cheaply made, as the stones were to be\r\n     had in great abundance in almost every field. On _new_ land,\r\n     trenching was sometimes carried on simultaneously with the\r\n     drainage; and it very often happened that the removal of the stones\r\n     thus brought to the surface, was very expensive; but they were\r\n     turned to profitable account in sewering drains and building\r\n     substantial fences. In almost every case the drains were made in\r\n     the direction of the greatest inclination, or fall of the land; and\r\n     this is the practice followed throughout the country. Some\r\n     exceptions occur on _hill-sides_, where I have seen the drains laid\r\n     off at an acute angle with the line of inclination. It is not\r\n     necessary that I should explain the scientific reasons for draining\r\n     in the direction of the fall of the land, as that point has been\r\n     fully treated of, and well illustrated, in your article already\r\n     referred to. I shall now pass on to the Queries.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Thorough Drainage BY HENRY F. FRENCH. EXETER N.H.]\r\n\r\n     _Depth of drains, and distance apart._ There is still a great\r\n     diversity of opinion on these points, and particularly in reference\r\n     to the drainage of stiff clay soils; some of the most intelligent\r\n     and practical farmers in this country hold to the opinion that, on\r\n     such soils, the maximum depth should not exceed three feet, and the\r\n     distance apart sixteen to twenty feet. On clay loams, having a\r\n     subsoil more or less free, the general practice is, to make the\r\n     drains three and a half to four feet deep, and at twenty-one to\r\n     thirty feet apart. On lighter soils, having a free subsoil, four\r\n     feet deep and forty feet apart are the usual limitations. This farm\r\n     may be taken as a fair average of the land in Ireland, as a test\r\n     for drainage; the soil is a deep clay loam; the subsoil a compact\r\n     mixture of strong clay and calcareous gravel, almost free from\r\n     stones. Thirty miles of drains have been made on the farm, the\r\n     least distance apart being twenty-one feet, and the greatest\r\n     distance thirty feet; the depth in every case, three and a half to\r\n     four feet for minor drains. This drainage has given the greatest\r\n     satisfaction; for although the greatest part of the work was\r\n     performed by the Agricultural pupils, in training here, we have not\r\n     had occasion to re-make a single drain, except in one instance,\r\n     where the tiles got choked, and which I shall explain hereafter.\r\n\r\n     _Tiles: Size, Shape, Draining, Capacity, &c._ We use circular pipe\r\n     tiles, of inch and a half bore, for all parallel drains whose\r\n     length does not exceed one hundred yards, and two-inch pipes for\r\n     any additional length up to one hundred and fifty yards, the\r\n     greatest length, in my opinion, a parallel drain should reach\r\n     before discharging into a main or sub-main drain. We do not find it\r\n     necessary to use collars on this farm, as we have _firm_ ground to\r\n     place the tiles on, and we can cut the drain to fit the tiles\r\n     exactly. As regards the size of tiles for main and sub-main drains,\r\n     _that_ can only be regulated by the person in charge of the\r\n     drainage at any particular place, after seeing the land opened up\r\n     and the minor drains discharging. As a general rule, a circular\r\n     pipe of three inches internal diameter will discharge the\r\n     _ordinary_ drainage of five or six statute acres, and give\r\n     sufficient space for the circulation of air. It should be observed,\r\n     however, that this applies to a district where the annual rain-fall\r\n     is from twenty-six to thirty inches, that of all Ireland being\r\n     about thirty-five inches; besides, we have not the immense falls of\r\n     rain in a _few hours_ that occur in other countries. All these\r\n     points should be carefully considered in estimating the water-way\r\n     for drainage. I have said that collars are not used with the tiles\r\n     on this farm, as the bottom of the drains is quite firm and even;\r\n     but, where the bed for the tile is soft, and the subsoil is of a\r\n     _shifting_ nature, then collars should be used in every case.\r\n     Collars cost about half the price of tiles, which they are made to\r\n     connect, so that the use of them adds one-third to the expense of\r\n     the sewering material; and, as I have already pointed out, I think\r\n     it quite unnecessary to use them where the subsoil is _firm_, and\r\n     where the drain can be bottomed to _fit the tile_. Where large\r\n     pipes are not to be had conveniently for sewering main or\r\n     sub-drains, I find a proportional number of pipes of lesser\r\n     diameter to answer perfectly. It is very desirable to provide\r\n     _branch pipes_ for connecting the minor with the main drains. The\r\n     branch should be socketed to receive the end of the last tile in\r\n     the minor drain, and the point of attachment to the main pipe may\r\n     be on the top or on the side of the latter. If the branch be made\r\n     to lead the water into the side of the main pipe, then it should\r\n     join the latter at an acute angle, that both streams may meet with\r\n     the least possible opposition of forces.\r\n\r\n     _Fall necessary in Tile Drainage._ I consider one foot in one\r\n     hundred yards the _least_ fall to work upon with safety.\r\n\r\n     _Securing Outlets._ All the outlets from main-drains should be well\r\n     secured against the intrusion of vermin, by a wrought-iron grating,\r\n     built in mason-work. The water may flow into a stone trough\r\n     provided with an overflow-pipe, by which the quantity discharged\r\n     may be ascertained at any time, so as to compare the drainage\r\n     before and after rain, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Traps, or Silt Ponds._ Where extensive drainage is carried on in\r\n     low-lying districts, and the principal outlet at a considerable\r\n     distance, it may be found necessary to have traps at several points\r\n     where the silt from the tiles will be kept. These traps may be of\r\n     cast-iron, or mason-work, cemented; and provision should be made,\r\n     by which they can be cleaned out and examined regularly--the\r\n     drainage at these periods also undergoing inspection at the\r\n     different traps.\r\n\r\n     _Plow-Draining._ We have no draining-plows in use in Ireland, that\r\n     I know of; the common plow is sometimes used for marking off the\r\n     drains, cutting the sides, and throwing out the earth to a\r\n     considerable depth, thereby lessening the manual labor\r\n     considerably. Efforts have been made in England to produce an\r\n     efficient implement of this description; but it would appear there\r\n     is ample room for an inventive Jonathan to walk in for a profitable\r\n     patent in this department, and thus add another to the many\r\n     valuable ones brought out in your great country.\r\n\r\n     _Case of Obstruction in Tiles._ Some years since, one of the\r\n     principal main-drains on this farm was observed not discharging the\r\n     water freely, as it hitherto had done, after a heavy fall of rain;\r\n     and the land adjoining it showed unmistakable signs of wetness. The\r\n     drain was opened, and traced to the point of obstruction, which was\r\n     found to be convenient to a _small poplar tree_, the rootlets of\r\n     which made their way into the tiles, at the depth of five and a\r\n     half feet, and completely filled them, in the direction of the\r\n     stream, for several yards. We have some of the tiles (horse-shoe)\r\n     in our museum here, as they were then lifted from the drain,\r\n     showing clearly the formidable nature of the obstruction. Another\r\n     serious case of obstruction has come to my knowledge, occasioned by\r\n     frogs or toads getting into the tiles of the main-drain in large\r\n     numbers, on account of the outlet being insufficiently protected.\r\n     In this case, a large expenditure had to be incurred, to repair the\r\n     damage done.\r\n\r\n     I have not observed any case of obstruction from the roots of our\r\n     cultivated plants. It has been said by some that the rootlets of\r\n     mangold will reach the drains under them; and, particularly, where\r\n     the drains contain most water in rapid motion. I took up the tiles\r\n     from a drain on this farm, in '54, which had been laid down (by a\r\n     former occupier), about the year '44, at a depth not exceeding\r\n     two-and-a-half feet, and not one of these was obstructed in the\r\n     least degree, although parsnips, carrots, cabbages, mangolds, &c.,\r\n     had been grown on this field. Obstructions may occur through the\r\n     agency of _mineral_ springs; but very few cases of this nature are\r\n     met with, at least in this country. I would anticipate this class\r\n     of obstruction, if from the nature of the land there was reason to\r\n     expect it, by increasing the fall in the drains and having _traps_\r\n     more frequent, where the main outlets are at a distance to render\r\n     them necessary. In my opinion, the roots of trees are the great\r\n     intruders to be guarded against, and more particularly the\r\n     _soft_-wooded sorts, such as poplars, willows, alders, &c. The\r\n     distance of a drain from a tree ought always to be equal to the\r\n     height of the latter.\r\n\r\n     _Tiles flattening in the drying process._ With this subject, I am\r\n     not practically familiar. In most tile-works, the tiles, after\r\n     passing through the moulding-machine, are placed horizontally on\r\n     shelves, which rise one above another to any convenient height, on\r\n     which the tiles are dried by means of heated flues which traverse\r\n     the sheds where the work is carried on; or they are allowed to dry\r\n     without artificial heat. I prefer the tiles prepared by the latter\r\n     method, as, if sufficient time be given them to be well dried, they\r\n     will burn more equally, and be more durable. The tiles will flatten\r\n     more or less for the first day or two on the shelves, after which\r\n     they are _rolled_. This is done by boys (who are provided with\r\n     pieces of wood of a diameter equal to the bore of the tile when\r\n     made), who very soon learn to get over a large number daily. The\r\n     \"roller\" should have a shouldered handle attached, the whole\r\n     thickness of which should not be greater than that of the tile. The\r\n     _shoulder_ is necessary to make the _ends_ of the tiles even, that\r\n     there may be no _very open_ joints when they are placed in a drain.\r\n     Once rolled, the tiles are not likely to flatten again, if the\r\n     operation be performed at the proper time.\r\n\r\n     As good tiles as I ever saw were dried in a different way, and not\r\n     rolled at all. As they were taken from the machine--six at a\r\n     time--each carrier passed off with his tray, and placed them _on\r\n     end_ carefully, upon an _even floor_. When five or six rows of\r\n     tiles were thus placed, the whole length of the drying-house, a\r\n     board was set on edge to keep them from falling to one side; then\r\n     followed five or six other rows of tiles, and so on, till the\r\n     drying-ground was filled.\r\n\r\n     This was the plan adopted in a tilery near Dublin, some years ago.\r\n     It is only a few days since I examined some of the tiles made at\r\n     these works, which had been taken from a drain, where they had been\r\n     in use for nine years; and the _clear ringing sound_ produced by\r\n     striking them against each other, showed what little effect that\r\n     length of time produced upon them, and how well they had been\r\n     manufactured.\r\n\r\n     _Cost of Tiles._ We have recently paid at the works--\r\n\r\n     For 1-1/2 inch pipes   17s. 6d. per thousand.\r\n      \"  2         \"        25s.           \"\r\n      \"  3         \"        45s.           \"\r\n\r\n     Each tile one foot in length, and the one and one-half-inch pipes\r\n     weighing 16 cwt. per thousand.\r\n\r\n     One of the great difficulties in connection with tile-making is, in\r\n     many districts, to procure clay sufficiently free from lime. Tiles\r\n     are very often sold by sample, sent a considerable distance, and it\r\n     becomes necessary to test them, which we do (for\r\n     lime) by placing them in water for a night; and, if lime is present\r\n     in the tile, it will, of course, swell out, and break the latter,\r\n     or leave it in a riddled state.\r\n\r\n     I have now endeavored to answer the queries in your postscript, and\r\n     I have carefully avoided enlarging on some points in them with\r\n     which your readers are already familiar. If I shall have thrown a\r\n     single ray of additional light on this subject across the Atlantic,\r\n     I shall be amply repaid for any attention I have given to\r\n     thorough-drainage during the past twelve years.\r\n\r\n     I should here observe that I mislaid amongst my papers the portion\r\n     of your letter containing the queries (it was a separate sheet),\r\n     and it has not as yet turned up, so that I had to depend on a\r\n     rather treacherous memory to keep the queries in my mind's eye. It\r\n     is highly probable, therefore, that I have overlooked some of them.\r\n     This circumstance was the chief cause of the delay in writing.\r\n\r\n     You are quite at liberty to make any use you please of this\r\n     communication.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM BOYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsorption of moisture; 303, 304, 322\r\n   \"    Fertilizing substances; 268\r\n\r\nAeration; 269, 276\r\n\r\nAlbert Model Farm; 375\r\n\r\nAmerican experiments; 367\r\n\r\nAnderson, J.
