For our own part we accept that assurance, and we do not think\r\nthat the Commissioner of Air Police for the British Government will be\r\ncaught napping again.\r\n\r\n\"In saying this we do not in the least mean to imply that Sir John\r\nCustance could either have foreseen or prevented the astounding\r\nmid-Atlantic tragedies. Sir John, though barely thirty years of age, is\r\nan official in every way worthy of his high position, an organizer of\r\nexceptional ability and a pilot of practical experience. Press and\r\npublic are perfectly well aware that it is owing to his personal\r\nexertions that our magnificent Transatlantic air-liners are no longer\r\nstricken down by the Night Terror of the immediate past. And in saying\r\nthis much, we have both a suggestion and a request to make.\r\n\r\n\"The inner history of the piracies is only fully known to one man. It is\r\na story, we understand, that puts the imagination of the boldest writer\r\nof fiction to shame. Such parts of it as have been made public hint at a\r\nstory of absorbing interest behind. The bad old days of censorship and\r\nsecrecy have vanished with the occasions that made them necessary. We\r\nsuggest that a full and detailed 'story' of the first--and we trust the\r\nlast--Air Pirate should be written, and given to the world. And we call\r\nupon that most popular public man, Sir John Custance, to do this for us.\r\nHe alone knows everything.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time that it appeared I read the above to Charles Thumbwood, my\r\nlittle valet, as I finished breakfast, in my Half Moon Street chambers.\r\n\r\n\"Not _quite_ correct, Charles. You know almost as much about it as I do.\r\nTo say nothing of a certain friend ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't say that, Sir John,\" said Charles, brushing my light\r\novercoat. \"Though I rode part of the course alongside of you; to say\r\nnothing of Mr. Danjuro.\" Thumbwood was a jockey before I took him into\r\nmy service. \"Are you going to write it all down, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends on several things, and on one person especially. I must\r\nthink it all over.\"\r\n\r\nThink it over I did as I drove to my offices in Whitehall--the Scotland\r\nYard of the Air--and I discussed it afterwards with a certain lady....\r\n\r\nWhich is how the following narrative came to be written, though I did\r\nnot complete it until the best part of two years had elapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI never did any flying during the Great War. I was too young, being only\r\nfifteen and at Eton when Peace was signed. But from the very earliest\r\ndays that I can remember aviation fascinated me as nothing else could.\r\nMy father, the first baronet, left me a moderate fortune. He died when I\r\nwas eighteen, and instead of going to Oxford, I entered as a cadet in\r\nthe R.F.C. It is not necessary to detail how, when I had earned my\r\nwings, I joined the civil side of flying and became a pilot-commander in\r\nthe Transatlantic Service. I had a good deal of influence behind me,\r\nand, to cut a long story short, at twenty-eight I was Assistant, and at\r\nthirty Chief Commissioner of the British Air Police. I was answerable\r\nto Government alone, and, within its limits, my powers were absolute.\r\n\r\nIt was on a morning in late June, the 25th to be exact, when the wheels\r\nbegan to move. I date the start of everything from that morning. About\r\none o'clock on the preceding night Thumbwood had waked me from\r\nrefreshing sleep. A wireless message, in code, had been received at\r\nWhitehall. It was addressed to me personally, and was from the\r\nController of the White Star Air Line at Plymouth. My people at\r\nWhitehall, on night duty, thought it of sufficient importance to send on\r\neven at this hour.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was thoroughly awake, and had done cursing Thumbwood, I\r\nread the message. It only said that a matter of the gravest importance\r\nrequired my personal presence at Plymouth, and would I come down at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nNow considerable experience of the fussy great men who controlled the\r\nair-liner companies, which linked up England with all parts of the\r\nworld, had made me somewhat sceptical of these urgent demands for my\r\npresence. More than once I had to explain that I was not at the beck and\r\ncall of any commercial magnate, and if I had made myself disliked in\r\ncertain quarters I had, at least, made my office respected.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I scribbled instructions to the chief inspector on duty that\r\nhe should send a wireless to Plymouth requesting further details. Then\r\nI went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I _was_ going to Plymouth the next morning in any\r\ncase, though on private business. Sir Joshua Johnson, Controller of the\r\nWhite Star Line, did not, of course, know that. His midnight message was\r\na coincidence.\r\n\r\nI could have flown down from Whitehall in my fast police yacht in an\r\nhour, but, as it happened, I was going to train from Paddington. Sir\r\nJoshua could wait until I turned up some time after lunch.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the morning of my departure from town. The long\r\ndeparture platform at Paddington was crowded with well-dressed,\r\nhappy-looking people, as I stood by the door of my reserved carriage in\r\nthe Riviera Express--that superb train, with its curved roof, which runs\r\nto Plymouth without a stop.\r\n\r\nThumbwood, invaluable little man, filled the carriage with flowers,\r\ngreat bunches of white lilac and June roses, and the station-master, who\r\ncame up for a chat, looked curiously at the bower my valet had made. The\r\nChief Commissioner of Air Police was not wont to travel like that!\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was wildly exhilarated, and at the same time, as nervous\r\nas a boy making his first flight. To-day might prove one of the happiest\r\nor quite the most miserable of my life. I was going to put it to the\r\ntest. Confound it, why didn't Connie come?\r\n\r\nOn this morning Miss Constance Shepherd, the young light-comedy actress,\r\nadored of London, and to me the rose of all the roses, was travelling\r\ndown to Plymouth to catch the air-liner starting from that port to New\r\nYork at eight-thirty this evening. And she had promised to travel with\r\nme!\r\n\r\nWould she have done so, I kept on asking myself, if she didn't know\r\nquite well what I meant to say to her? Or was it just friendliness? I\r\nknew she liked me.\r\n\r\n... Why didn't she come? Here it was, only eight minutes before the\r\ntrain started. As I searched the platform, with an eye that strove to\r\nappear calm and unconcerned, I saw faces that I knew--faces of\r\ntheatrical celebrities, two or three of the prettiest girls in England,\r\na handsome, hook-nosed young man, who was, perhaps, the best known\r\ntheatrical manager in London, two eminent comedians carrying bouquets.\r\nAnd the Press photographers were beginning to arrange their cameras....\r\n\r\nI had completely forgotten what a tremendous celebrity dear little\r\nConnie was. I might have known they'd have given her a send-off on her\r\nway to the States. All the same, it annoyed me, as it seemed to be\r\nannoying a tall, hatchet-faced man in Donegal tweeds, who scowled at\r\nthe little crowd. Was he a friend, too, I wondered?\r\n\r\nShe came at last, very late of course, and after a brief smile at me,\r\nunderwent the public ceremonies of the occasion, while I--I own\r\nit--retired into the carriage for a minute or two. But I saw the cameras\r\nclick, and the girls embrace, and the crowd of sightseers trying to push\r\ninto the charmed circle, and then Connie was in the corridor, leaning\r\nout of the window, waving and smiling as the train began to move to an\r\naccompaniment of loud cheers.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Connie, royalty isn't in it!\" I said, as she stepped laughingly\r\ninto the carriage, and I pushed the sliding door home.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're dears!\" she said, \"and they do really mean well, despite\r\nthe fact that we shall all be in the picture papers to-morrow morning,\r\nand that's good for business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were never coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an impression I convey,\" she answered; \"but I'm very careful,\r\nreally. My maid was here with the luggage half an hour ago. What lovely\r\nflowers you have got for me, John!\"\r\n\r\nShe lay back in her seat as the train gathered speed and Ealing flashed\r\nby with a roar, and I feasted my eyes on the fairest picture in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nShe wore a simple travelling coat and skirt of white piqué, and the\r\nwhite lilac was all about her, framing her face as she held up a branch\r\nto inhale its fragrance. All England knew that face in the days when\r\nlittle Connie sang and danced herself into the heart of the public, but\r\nnone knew it as well as I.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe that marvellous hair of dark chestnut, those deep\r\namethyst eyes, and the perfect bow of lips which were truer to the exact\r\ncolour of coral than any I have ever seen? It only makes a catalogue\r\nafter all. It's the expression--the soul, if you like--that makes the\r\ntrue face; and here was one so frank and kind and sweet that when one\r\nlooked it seemed as if hands were placed beneath the heart, lifting it\r\nup!\r\n\r\nOn one other day only did I see her more lovely than she was now.\r\n\r\nWell, it was too early to say what I wanted to say, and, besides, I was\r\nnervous as yet. We hadn't settled down. As I expected, her breakfast had\r\nconsisted of tea and a macaroon, so I produced a basket--lunch was to\r\ncome later--in which a silver box of caviare sandwiches was surrounded\r\nby crushed ice in a larger box of zinc. There was also iced hock and\r\nseltzer water. We both felt more at home in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWe had lit our cigarettes, and I was thinking hard, when someone passing\r\nalong the corridor looked in upon us for a moment. I had an impression\r\nof a brown face and a scowl. It was the man in tweeds that I had noticed\r\nat Paddington.\r\n\r\n\"That _beast_!\" said Connie suddenly.\r\n\r\nI turned and looked at her. She was frowning adorably, and I thought she\r\nlooked rather pale.\r\n\r\n\"D'you know him, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, and I simply hate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect you've heard his name, John. Most people have in town. He is\r\nHenry Helzephron, a big man in your way once.\"\r\n\r\nI _did_ know the name as that of a pilot of extraordinary courage and\r\nability during the Great War. He had gained the Victoria Cross when a\r\nlad of twenty, and his exploits during two wonderful years formed part\r\nof the history of aviation. He had not flown for years now, and divided\r\nhis time between the more dissipated haunts of the West End and an\r\nestate he had somewhere in Devon or Cornwall, a \"has-been\" with a\r\nsinister reputation, a lounger of thirty-six.\r\n\r\n\"I know. 'Hawk Helzephron' he used to be called. Gone all to pieces, I\r\nunderstand. But how do _you_ know him, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did me the honour to ask me to marry him about two months ago,\" she\r\nanswered, \"and since then he is always putting himself in my way. He\r\ndoes not speak, but he comes to the theatre and glares. I am always\r\nmeeting him, and I hate the sight of him. He makes me afraid....\"\r\n\r\nHere was my chance and I took it like a shot. She should never be\r\nunprotected from Helzephrons and all the tribe who haunt the stage door\r\nany more!\r\n\r\nA successful aviator takes instantaneous decisions. He must. If he\r\nhesitates he's lost.\r\n\r\nWhat I said, as the Riviera Express hurled itself through the summer\r\nnoon, is not part of this narrative. I daresay I was no more original\r\nthan most men, but the results were eminently satisfactory for, as we\r\nran past the towers and winding river of Exeter, Connie and I were\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nI remember that I lugged the ring out of my waistcoat pocket--sapphires\r\nand diamonds, a top-shelf ring!--precisely as we glided through Exeter\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\"O-oh!\" said Connie, as the thing winked and shone in the sunlight; and\r\nthen: \"You _wretch_! I'll never forgive you--never!\"\r\n\r\nI wondered what was the matter. In fact, I asked her.\r\n\r\n\"You made so sure of me that you actually bought this beforehand!\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't do to leave anything to chance,\" I said, and I made her put\r\nit on, and gave her several other things of no particular importance\r\nwhile she was doing it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the journey, past the red cliffs and blue seas of\r\nTeignmouth and Paignton, we had a long and happy talk, finding out--of\r\ncourse--all sorts of delightful things about each other which we had\r\nonly suspected before.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is nothing fresher and more delightful in life than those\r\nfirst few hours of revelation, when a man and a girl who love each other\r\nhave, at last, become engaged. It is like coming into harbour after an\r\nanxious voyage, and yet, all the time there is the splendid knowledge\r\nthat there are new and marvellous seas waiting to be explored, this\r\ntime--together!\r\n\r\nConnie was to act in New York for a month and in Boston for a fortnight.\r\nIt was a 'star' engagement, and six weeks would soon pass. Besides, now\r\nthat Plymouth was barely thirty hours from New York, there was nothing\r\nto prevent me from popping over once or twice to see her. I was\r\nresponsible to no one for my time, and half a dozen quite real matters\r\nin connection with my job would provide a valid excuse. After the six\r\nweeks were over, why, then, we would be married!\r\n\r\n\"There is absolutely no reason on earth why we should wait,\" I told her,\r\nin sublime ignorance of what the Fates had in store for both of us.\r\n\"I'll have a special licence ready, and the day you land again on this\r\nside you shall be Lady Custance, darling!\"\r\n\r\nSo it was settled, lightly and happily enough, and when we left the\r\ntrain at Plymouth Station there was not a cloud in the sky or in our\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nI found that Mr. Thumbwood had been making excellent use of his time,\r\neven as his master had, for the little man was assisting a demure and\r\nwell-looking maiden to collect luggage, who turned out to be Connie's\r\nmaid, Wilson.\r\n\r\nWe left them to it and drove to the Royal Hotel, not before I had seen\r\nthe train start again on its journey to Cornwall, with Mr.\r\nHelzephron--whom I had quite forgotten--standing in the corridor and\r\nregarding us with a malignant scowl upon his hawk-like, dissipated\r\ncountenance. But Mr. Helzephron, and all other men alive, were about six\r\na penny to me just then.\r\n\r\nConnie was to leave the sea-drome at eight-thirty in that fine\r\nflying-liner _Atlantis_. She was a Royal Mail ship, and about the\r\nfastest and finest flyer in the Transatlantic service, with a carrying\r\ncapacity of three hundred and fifty passengers, and a thousand tons dead\r\nweight of cargo. Her crew numbered forty, and she was commanded by\r\nCaptain Swainson, one of the most reliable pilot commanders in the air.\r\nHe was a man I both knew and liked.\r\n\r\nConnie wanted a rest and a sleep. \"At least, I want to be alone to think\r\nit all over!\" she said, so she went up to her room in the hotel at\r\nonce. I arranged to call for her at five, when we would go for a stroll\r\nand afterwards have an early dinner. Then I washed my hands and strolled\r\ninto the famous long bar of the hotel for a sandwich and a whisky and\r\nsoda, before proceeding to the offices of the White Star Line on the\r\nHoe.\r\n\r\nAs I munched my sandwich, I wondered what the affair was that had made\r\nSir Joshua Johnson send me a wireless message in the middle of the\r\nnight--a time when obese old gentlemen should be fast asleep in bed. I\r\nhad told my people at Whitehall to ask for further particulars, but I\r\nhad not the least intention of being bothered with them--or any police\r\nbusiness whatever--until I had settled my own personal affairs with\r\nConnie. Accordingly, when I left my chambers in the morning to go to\r\nPaddington, I sent a message to Whitehall to say that I was proceeding\r\nto Plymouth during the day, and would wait till my arrival to hear what\r\nthe business was. Muir Lockhart, my assistant, would perfectly\r\nunderstand, and was quite capable of dealing with anything that might\r\ncome along.\r\n\r\nThe long bar was, as usual, full of naval officers, with a sprinkling of\r\nAir Merchant Service men in their uniform of grey, silver and light\r\nblue. I saw no one that I knew, until the swing-doors leading into the\r\nhotel were flung open, and a wiry little man in the black and silver\r\nuniform of my own corps came hurriedly in. His peaked cap, with the\r\nsilver wings and sword badge, was pushed back on his head, and he was in\r\na state of unenviable heat and perspiration. He was Pilot Superintendent\r\nLashmar, chief of the Ocean Patrol stationed at Plymouth, with equal\r\nrank to a lieutenant-commander in the Navy, and one of my most trusted\r\nofficers in the West.\r\n\r\nHe went up to the bar and ordered a \"long glass of iced ginger-beer,\r\nwith a dash of gin in it,\" and then I clapped him on the shoulder. He\r\nwheeled round in a second, and when he saw who it was his face changed\r\nfrom anxiety to relief.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven you're come, sir,\" he said, as he saluted. \"We've been\r\nsignalling to Whitehall all the morning, and all we could get was that\r\nyou were on your way. I've been backwards and forwards from the A.P.\r\nHeadquarters to the White Star Office a dozen times.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came down by train, Mr. Lashmar,\" I said, realizing in an instant\r\nthat there really _was_ something important afoot, and that by bad luck\r\nI was behind time. Sir Joshua Johnson was all very well, but when my own\r\npeople began to send out signals--that was quite another matter.\r\n\r\n\"We thought you'd fly down in the yacht, sir, and we've been sending\r\nwireless trying to pick you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't. I have had some most important business to attend to.\r\nAnyhow, I'm here now. What's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't heard _anything_, sir?\" he asked in amazement.\r\n\r\nAgain I cursed my luck, but I wasn't going to give it away. \"We'll go\r\nround to Sir Joshua Johnson at once,\" was all I said.\r\n\r\n\"That will be best, sir, and then every detail can be put before you in\r\nsequence. I have my report with me, written up to date. I think I've\r\ntaken all possible measures up to the present, but, of course, we've\r\nbeen waiting for you. Sir Joshua, as you may imagine, is half out of his\r\nwits.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not had very far to travel, then,\" I said to gain time. All this\r\nwas so much Greek to me, and I had to walk warily.\r\n\r\nIn a minute more Lashmar and I were on the Hoe and approaching the\r\nstately offices of the Line, which stood in the very centre of that\r\nfamous promenade above the blue waters of the Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFATE OF THE TRANS-ATLANTIC AIR-LINER \"ALBATROS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a good many people in both the ante-room and the secretaries'\r\nroom as I was led to Sir Joshua. I was immediately aware of an unusual\r\nstir and excitement, and people nodded and whispered as I\r\npassed--\"That's Sir John Custance, the Police Commissioner.\" \"I expect\r\nthere's some news,\" were two of the _sotto voce_ remarks I heard.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua sat in his own magnificent apartment, with the great window\r\nlooking out over Drake's Island and Mount Edgcombe to the horizon. A\r\ntray and a decanter showed that he had lunched there, and there was a\r\ngood deal of cigar smoke in the air.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua was a tall and corpulent man of nearly seventy, with a red\r\nface with little purple veins in the cheeks, a thatch of snow-white hair\r\nand close whiskers. He had been an early pioneer of commercial flying,\r\nand had reaped his reward in the control of the finest air fleet in the\r\nworld and the Lord knows how many millions of money. He was distinctly\r\nan able and upright man, and his only faults were a slight pomposity and\r\na mistaken idea that the Commissioner of A.P. for Great Britain was a\r\nsort of unpaid official of The White Star Line! A good many of the great\r\nair-shipping magnates had tried to take that line in the past--and been\r\nsnubbed for their pains!\r\n\r\nSir Joshua was not pompous this afternoon, and his face was twitching as\r\nhe shook hands.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God you're come, Sir John,\" he said, \"I am almost out of my mind\r\nwith worry and anxiety. You will agree with me that this affair is as\r\ngrave as it well can be?\"\r\n\r\nTo that I was diplomatically silent. What I said was: \"I have seen\r\nSuperintendent Pilot Lashmar. What I want now, Sir Joshua, as a\r\npreliminary, is a brief and exact account from your own lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said, pushing a padded chair towards me and handing a box\r\nof cigars. \"You shall have it in a nutshell.\" He sat down opposite to\r\nme, pulled some papers towards him with a hand that shook a little, and\r\nbegan to read.\r\n\r\n... \"Our liner _Albatros_, carrying the mails, left New York yesterday\r\nmorning about seven a.m., American time. She was consequently due here\r\nat Plymouth about six-thirty this afternoon--Greenwich. The weather\r\nconditions at the ten thousand feet mail-ship level were perfect. In\r\naddition to the mails there were about two hundred passengers, and she\r\ncarried, though this was known only to a few officials, a parcel of\r\nparticularly fine Brazilian diamonds, consigned from Tiffany's of New\r\nYork to Aaron and Harris, the dealers in precious stones, of Hatton\r\nGarden. The jewels were in the ship's safe, in charge of the purser.\r\nVarious ships--I have the full list--sighted the _Albatros_ during the\r\nday and exchanged signals, while she duly reported herself by wireless\r\nas she passed each lightship, as soon as dusk fell. The lightships, as\r\nyou know, are a hundred miles apart from the Fastnet to Long Island, and\r\nare connected by cable with our telegraph room here. The indicating\r\ndials register, degree by geographical degree, the exact position of any\r\nof our ships when in the air. This record is printed on a tape beneath\r\neach dial, and each record is examined every hour or two by a clerk.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, I knew all this. The minutest detail of the system was\r\nfamiliar. I wished that Sir Joshua would \"cut the cackle and come to the\r\n'osses.\" No doubt my face showed something of what I felt, for Sir\r\nJoshua half apologized.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Sir John,\" he said, \"I thought it best to prepare some sort of\r\nshort and coherent statement for the Press. As yet they have got hold\r\nof nothing, but we can't possibly keep it much longer. Even you\r\ncouldn't, with all your powers. And what I am reading is this statement.\r\nI particularly want you to hear it, as, of course, it rests with you if\r\nit shall be published in this form or not.\"\r\n\r\nI bowed, and Sir Joshua continued:\r\n\r\n\"At ten o'clock last night the clerk on duty examined the tapes. When he\r\ncame to the one recording the progress of the _Albatros_, he found that\r\nfor two hours there was no record of her at all. The last record was\r\nthat she had passed and signalled to Lightship A. 70 that all was well.\r\nA two hours' gap is so unusual, owing to the--er--perfection of our\r\norganization, that the clerk was alarmed, and reported the matter to a\r\nsuperior upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"A general call to all our ships in the air at that moment was at once\r\nsent out, and in a few minutes responses were received from several of\r\nthem to the effect that the _Albatros_ had not been sighted. Nor was\r\nthere any answer from the ship herself. A signal to Lightship A. 71, the\r\nnext guide-boat the _Albatros_ should have passed, elicited the\r\ninformation that she had never done so. By eleven o'clock all these\r\nfacts were known in this office. The night staff here became seriously\r\nalarmed. By a fortunate coincidence I was attending a performance at the\r\nTheatre Royal close by, with Lady Johnson and my daughters. This was\r\nknown, and a messenger caught me at the close of the play, and I came\r\nround at once. I had not been in the offices for five minutes, when news\r\nof the most extraordinary and sensational character began to come in\r\nfrom our receiving station by the Citadel.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Pring, one of our most reliable pilot commanders, was in charge\r\nof the _Albatros_. The message was from him, and this is the gist of it.\r\nAt sundown the _Albatros_ was flying on the ten-thousand-foot level. The\r\nLightship A. 70 was some twenty miles astern. No other airships were in\r\nsight, when the look-out man reported a boat coming up at great speed\r\nfrom the east. The _Albatros_ was doing her steady ninety knots, but as\r\nthe two ships approached, it was seen that the stranger, a much smaller\r\nboat, was flying at an almost incredible rate. Pring reports that she\r\nwas doing a sixteen to eighteen second mile, but there is doubtless a\r\nmistake in the message.\r\n\r\n\"The boat showed no distinguishing lights, and failed to signal, as she\r\nflashed past the liner at the distance of half a mile. There were\r\nseveral curious features about her which attracted attention, though\r\nwhat these were we do not yet know. This strange ship turned and came up\r\nwith the _Albatros_, actually flying round her in spirals with the\r\ngreatest ease. Then, without the slightest warning, she opened fire on\r\nour vessel, and the first shell, obviously by design, blew away our\r\nwireless.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart simply bounded within me. This was news with a vengeance! I had\r\nto exercise all my self-control not to pour out a stream of frantic\r\nquestions. It was beyond thinking! Such a thing had not happened since\r\nthe League of Nations came into being. It might mean hideous war once\r\nmore--anything!\r\n\r\nSir Joshua had paused to drink a glass of water. He understood the\r\nimmense gravity of this news as well as I did, and his voice was\r\nunsteady as he went on in answer to my nod!\r\n\r\n\"The _Albatros_ was helpless. Since the international agreement that\r\nonly naval, military and police ships may fly armed, she had no possible\r\nmeans of defence. Flight, even, was impossible, and the loss of her\r\nwireless forbade her to summon help. Then the anonymous ship turned a\r\nmachine gun on her rudder and shot it out of gear. There was nothing for\r\nit but to descend to the water and rest on her floats. Pring was forced\r\nto give the order, and she planed down. The other ship followed and took\r\nthe water not two hundred yards away.\r\n\r\n\"She then signalled in Morse code, with a Klaxon horn, that she was\r\nsending men aboard the _Albatros_, and that if the captain or crew\r\noffered the slightest resistance she'd blow her to pieces. They launched\r\na Berthon collapsible boat from a door in the stern fusilage. There were\r\nfour men in her, all armed with large-calibre automatic pistols, and\r\nwearing pilot's hoods and masks with talc eye-pieces, so that it was\r\nimpossible to identify them. Pring could do nothing at all. He had the\r\npassengers to consider. These ruffians cleared out the safe and the\r\nwomen's jewel-cases--they left the mails alone--and in ten minutes they\r\nwere back again with the loot. The ship lifted and went off in the dark\r\nat two hundred miles an hour, leaving the _Albatros_, helpless upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"It was a business of several hours to rig up a makeshift rudder, but,\r\nfortunately, her searchlights were all right, and she kept on signalling\r\nwith these until she was sighted by a big cargo steamer, a Baltimore to\r\nCadiz boat, coming up from the south, the _Sant Iago_. She took off the\r\npassengers and is bringing them home; she's only a fifteen-knot boat,\r\nbut I have already dispatched one of our smaller liners to pick her up\r\nand take the passengers aboard. They ought to be here some time\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"The _Sant Iago_ has wireless, and was able to communicate, not only\r\nwith us, but also with the air-yacht _May Flower_, which she sighted on\r\nthe four-thousand-foot level at dawn. The _May Flower_ belongs to Mr.\r\nVan Adams, the Philadelphia millionaire, who is crossing to England with\r\na party of friends. She came down to the water and took up Commander\r\nPring and the second officer, and should be here by tea-time this\r\nafternoon. Then we shall know more of this unprecedented, this\r\ndeplorable business.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the _Albatros_, Sir Joshua?\"\r\n\r\n\"A small crew was left on her, and an emergency tender and workmen\r\nstarted at dawn. She ought to be flying again to-night.\"\r\n\r\nI had all the available facts at last, and long before Sir Joshua had\r\nfinished my mind was busy as a mill. There was going to be the very\r\nbiggest sort of commotion over this. England and America would be in a\r\nblaze of fury within twenty-four hours, and every flying man, from the\r\nskippers of the lordly London-Brindisi-Bombay boats, or the\r\nTransatlantic Line, to the sporting commercial traveller in a secondhand\r\n50 h.p. trussed-girder blow-fly, would be wagging the admonishing finger\r\nat ME.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Sir Joshua. Most lucid, if I may say so. As a clear\r\nstatement of fact, combined with a sense of vivid narrative, your\r\naccount could hardly be improved on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, Sir John ...\"\r\n\r\n\"When the time comes to make a statement for the newspapers I would not\r\nalter a word.\"\r\n\r\nThus did the tongue of the flatterer evade a situation that might have\r\nbeen a trifle awkward for me. I rose at that. \"I must leave you now, Sir\r\nJoshua,\" I said, \"as I have a great deal to see to and must rejoin Mr.\r\nLashmar. Steps have already been taken, and later on in the day I shall\r\nbe able to tell you more. Meanwhile I shall see Captain Pring directly\r\nthe _May Flower_ arrives, and before anyone else. Our future action must\r\ndepend a great deal on his statement.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in my curtest official manner, and then I got out of the\r\nroom as quickly as I possibly could. Lashmar was waiting, and I took him\r\nby the arm and hurried him out of the office.\r\n\r\n\"I've only just heard full details, Lashmar, and pretty bad they are.\r\nNow has anything been done--by us, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had two of our patrol ships out at two-thirty this morning cruising\r\nover a wide area, sir. They are out still, and reporting every hour. No\r\nresults, no strange airship seen anywhere. I've been out myself up and\r\ndown the Irish coast and round the Scillies this morning, more for\r\nform's sake than anything else. And I've cabled the whole story, as far\r\nas we know it, to the States.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Any reply from them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their police ships are out from Cape Breton to the Bermudas, but they\r\ndon't seem to have sighted anything out of the ordinary as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack along\r\nthat huge stretch, eight hundred miles if it's an inch. But, as far as I\r\ncan see, it's up to them; not us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. It's a case of sheer rank and daring piracy. It's been\r\norganized with great skill, and the pirates, whoever they are, have\r\ncommand of something quite out-size in the way of a ship. There isn't a\r\nworks in England where such a boat could be built without our knowing\r\nabout it before it was launched. And it's dead certain that there's\r\nnowhere in these little islands to hide her. Every single bit of spruce\r\nand piano wire with a motor-bicycle engine that can fly ten yards has to\r\nbe registered and licensed by me. No, this is an American stunt.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been crossing the Hoe as we talked, in the direction of the\r\nCitadel, and we now came to the long, low building of Dartmoor stone,\r\nwhich is the Plymouth Headquarters of the A.P. It is perched on the edge\r\nof the cliff, and within five yards of the spot where Sir Francis Drake\r\nis said to have finished his game of bowls when the Armada was coming up\r\nChannel.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the gates, where the police sentry presented arms, and\r\nbegan to walk up and down the terrace.\r\n\r\n\"Signal to Southampton,\" I ordered, \"and get a couple of their fastest\r\nboats here at once. They may be useful in an emergency, and it will look\r\nas if we are doing something. Ready for action, of course, and with full\r\nservice ammunition and bombs. Sir Joshua may have a fit if he likes, but\r\nthere is nothing to be done until we know more--unless you can suggest\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\nThe little man shook his head. He was keen as a terrier, of course, and\r\nhe had already acted with great promptitude and wisdom.\r\n\r\nJust then an orderly came out on to the terrace and handed me a signal.\r\n\r\nI read it out to Lashmar: \"Air-yacht _May Flower_ just passed St. Mary's\r\ndoing ninety knots.\" It was from our most westerly A.P. station on\r\nTresco in the Scillies. Lashmar made a rough calculation: \"Twenty-five\r\nmiles west-sou'-west of Land's End, add another seventy--she'll be here\r\njust under the hour, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I tell you what, Mr. Lashmar, go and meet her and escort her home.\r\nNot a living soul must speak to Captain Pring before I do--not even Sir\r\nJoshua or any of the White Star people. Give that as my orders when you\r\nmeet the yacht. But put it very politely to Mr. Van Adams--my\r\ncompliments and that sort of thing. He's the sort of person who could\r\nbuy the goodwill of the universe for ready money. Make your escort\r\nappear a compliment from the Government!\"\r\n\r\nLashmar never wasted words. He understood exactly, saluted, and hurried\r\nto the electric railway, which ran down like a chute into the sea-drome\r\nfar below. I lit a cigarette and watched, and it was a sight worth\r\nwatching.\r\n\r\nBeyond, stretched the largest sea-drome in Great Britain, a harbour\r\nwithin a harbour, surrounded by massive concrete walls. In the roughest\r\nweather, when even within the distant breakwater the Sound is turbulent,\r\nthe sea-drome is calm as a duck-pond. Now it was like a sheet of\r\npolished silver, and resting on their great floats at their moorings\r\nwere three gigantic air-liners, with electric launches and motor-boats\r\nplying between them and the landing-stages.\r\n\r\nRight in the centre was the splendid _Atlantis_, graceful as a swan, by\r\nwhich Connie was to leave for the States in a few hours. She was\r\nsurrounded by a swarm of boats no bigger than water-beetles from where I\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nA bell rang, there was a rumbling sound, and from a tunnel just beneath\r\nme the car, with Lashmar in it, shot down to the water like a stone\r\nrunning down a house roof. As the car dwindled to a punt, a match-box,\r\nand finally a postage stamp, I heard the creak and swish of the\r\nsemaphore behind me on the roof of the station. On the far side of the\r\nsea-drome was our Patrol Ship No. 1, stream-line fusilage, with the\r\nfamiliar red, white and blue line, snow-white planes, guns fore and\r\naft, and twin propellers of phosphor bronze winking white-hot in the\r\nafternoon sun.\r\n\r\nThe semaphore was sighted in five seconds. I got a pair of glasses, and\r\nsaw that the engines were already \"ticking over\" as Lashmar jumped into\r\na launch and went over the pool, with a cream-white wake behind him and\r\ntwo ostrich plumes of spray six feet high at the bows. He was on board\r\nin less time than it takes to write it. I heard the faint throbbing of\r\nthe four high-compression engines change to the drone of a hornet. No. 1\r\nPatrol slid over the water until her floats lifted--lifted until they\r\nbarely touched the surface, and she was clear. One clean spiral over\r\nPinklecombe way, and then, as she mounted, she turned and was off over\r\nRams Head like an arrow from a bow. Though I say it that shouldn't, my\r\nofficers and men of the A.P. were just about as good as they're made!\r\n\r\nThere was a good three-quarters of an hour to spare, and the Royal Hotel\r\nwas not four minutes away. After the recent excitements a cup of tea\r\nwith Connie seemed just the thing. As I legged it over the Hoe, I\r\nrealized that I might be very busy for some time, and, in consequence,\r\nlate for dinner. I must tell my girl that something of great importance\r\nhad happened, though, in any case, I was determined to see her off, come\r\nwhat might.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered something. As Chief Commissioner I had absolute\r\ncontrol over the airports of England in a time of crisis. In any case,\r\nit would be as well to, close the sea-drome in preparation for the _May\r\nFlower's_ arrival. I should then be certain that no one could possibly\r\nget at Captain Pring before I could. And if I chose to detain even the\r\nRoyal Mail for half an hour later on in the evening--under the\r\ncircumstances!--no one would say me nay.\r\n\r\nThere is a telephone box in the hall of the Royal Hotel. In thirty\r\nseconds my orders were given, and not a living soul would enter or leave\r\nPlymouth sea-drome without my permission. Then I strolled into the\r\nwinter gardens, where I found Connie sitting at a little table among\r\ntubs of azaleas and listening to the strains of a ladies' orchestra.\r\n\r\n\"I've half an hour and ten minutes exactly, darling,\" I said, putting my\r\nwatch on the table and helping her to early strawberries. \"Tell me when\r\nthe time's up, and then I must rush away for an hour before we dine.\"\r\n\r\nStraightway I forgot all about the _Albatros_, Captain Pring, and the\r\nmysterious armed ship in mid-Atlantic.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I know now, I wonder how I could have taken it so lightly,\r\neven then. But grave and serious as the affair was, amazing, too, in\r\nits boldness, an elaborate and unexpected masterpiece of crime, it\r\nseemed remote and very far away, like something one reads of in a\r\nforeign newspaper, never conceiving that it can have anything to do with\r\none's own _personal_ life.\r\n\r\nIf only I could have peeped but a little way into the future!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\"COLD-BLOODED PIRACY IN THE HIGH AIR\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPilot-commander Pring was a tall, lean, lantern-jawed officer, who,\r\nthough of English nationality, had spent most of his life in America.\r\nHis face was still pale and grim with passion and mortification as I\r\nclosed the door of my private room at the A.P. Station on him, Mr. Van\r\nAdams, the multi-millionaire, and Mr. Rickaby, second officer of the\r\n_Albatros_.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, sit down, please,\" I said. \"And I will ask Captain\r\nPring a few questions. Sir Joshua Johnson has given me the main facts,\r\nbut I want details. I won't detain you long, but I felt I ought to see\r\nyou before anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite!\" said Mr. Van Adams, a fleshy man, with a watchful eye and a\r\njaw like a pike.\r\n\r\n\"This is an extraordinary affair, Captain Pring,\" I went on. \"But, thank\r\ngoodness, you haven't lost your ship, or any lives. I know what you feel\r\nabout the _Albatros_.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is father, mother, brother, sister, hired girl and dog under the\r\nwaggon to me!\" said Pring, and then he blazed up into fury. I\r\ndisentangle the few words I can. The majority were too overdressed for\r\nrespectable society.\r\n\r\n\"... His Majesty's Mails! First time in history of flying, and it's\r\nhappened to ME! Cold-blooded piracy in the High Air! They'd have blown\r\nus to pieces as soon as look at us! When I get hold of that\r\nslime-lapping leper, the pirate skipper, I won't leave him hide or hair\r\nto cover the wart he calls his heart! ...\" and so on, for a good two\r\nminutes by the office chronometer.\r\n\r\nI let him rip. It was the quickest way. It's dangerous to throttle down\r\na man like Pring.\r\n\r\n\"The Captain is, naturally, furious,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite!\" answered Mr. Van Adams.\r\n\r\nThen we got to business. \"The strange airship, Captain Pring. Let's\r\nbegin with that. She approached you flying _West_, I understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did, Sir John. Does that put you wise to anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear that she was coming from Europe. But that was probably\r\na trick. She might have been waiting about for hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curious thing, then, that all the ships in the air during the last\r\nthirty hours that were within fifteen hundred miles of the American and\r\nCanadian coast never saw anything of her. The Air Police of the U.S.A.\r\nhave questioned every registered boat, Transatlantic and coastal trade,\r\nand not one of them sighted her. And, as you know, Sir John, from Cape\r\nRace to Charleston in summer weather the air's as thick with craft as\r\ngnats over a pond. Ain't that so, Mr. Van Adams, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite, Captain Pring.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see your inference. Well, we'll leave that for a moment. I understand\r\nthat there were some peculiar features about this ship. What were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's the fastest thing in the air, bar none. That I can swear to. A\r\npilot of my experience can't well be deceived, and if that ship--she's\r\none of the very few I've seen with four propellers--can't do two hundred\r\nand forty miles an hour, _without a following wind, mind_, then I'm a\r\nparetic!\"\r\n\r\nI whistled. Such speeds had been dreamed of but never known. \"Nearly\r\nthree times hurricane velocity!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"She'd race the dawn, Sir John! and that's my honest belief. There's\r\nnever been such a flying boat before. And she don't carry a crew of more\r\nthan twelve or fifteen men, in my opinion. The rest's all engines and\r\npetrol. She ain't more than twice the size of one of your patrol ships,\r\nall over.\"\r\n\r\nThis was talking! Each moment the affair grew more tense and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n\"That narrows our field of search no end,\" I remarked. \"A boat like that\r\ncan't be built anywhere in the world without leaving traces.\"\r\n\r\n\"It colours the cat different, sure,\" said Captain Pring. \"Now, here's\r\nanother point. Gum! I'm going to startle you some more, Sir John, but,\r\nas God sees me, I'm speaking truth. Here's Mr. Rickaby here as'll swear\r\nto all I say....\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the second officer, a good-looking, brown-faced lad. \"It's\r\nall gospel, Sir John,\" he broke in.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I said impatiently, \"I know you couldn't be mistaken,\r\nPring, and I won't insult you by thinking you'd pull a Chief\r\nCommissioner's leg over an affair of this importance. What's number two?\r\nLet's have it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The man who runs her, or the man who built her, has solved another\r\nproblem. He's produced silent engines at last! That ship's motors don't\r\nmake more noise than a June bug! On a dark night she could pass within\r\ntwo hundred yards of you, and you'd never guess that she was near.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that moment I saw the thing in its true proportions. From that\r\nmoment the air became unsafe. A man-eating tiger let loose upon a quiet\r\ncountry-side was not a tithe as dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe three other men saw that I understood.\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrels who came aboard the _Albatros_ and looted the ship.\r\nWhat of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were masked so's their mothers wouldn't, have known 'em. Armed to\r\nthe teeth, too. We'd have downed them quick enough, even at the cost of\r\na life or two, but there was the pirate with a four-inch gun trained on\r\nus. And she meant business. I did right, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow's voice shook, and his face was corrugated with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I should have done exactly the same myself under the circumstances,\r\nPring. Your first duty was to the women and children under your care.\r\nThat view, I am certain, will be accepted by the company and the\r\nGovernment, to say nothing of the public, when it gets out. About these\r\nmen, again, did you judge them to be American or foreigners?\"\r\n\r\n\"They didn't speak much, except, to give a few orders. But what they\r\n_did_ say I heard, every word. I was with them all the time, and so was\r\nMr. Rickaby here. I'll spring another surprise on you, Sir John, and\r\nthen I've done. _Those chaps were English, every one of them._ And,\r\nwhat's more, they weren't any plug-ugly crowd neither! They were\r\neducated men of some social position, club men at some time or other, or\r\nI'm a short sport!\"\r\n\r\nThe second officer spoke. \"Captain Pring is perfectly right, sir,\" he\r\nsaid modestly. \"I'll swear that they had been public school or 'Varsity\r\nmen at some time or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you?\" I asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Harrow, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. Here was another astounding fact for consideration when I was\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"And then, after a time,\" Pring continued, \"the _Sant Iago_ tramp\r\nsteamer freighter came up from way down South and rescued us. After that\r\nwe sighted the lights of Mr. Van Adams' air yacht, the _May Flower_, and\r\nin answer to our signal he came down and took me and Rickaby aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said the laconic millionaire.\r\n\r\n\"To-night, Captain Pring, I shall want a long talk with you. Now I must\r\nsurrender you to Sir Joshua. For the present, I want you all three to\r\ngive me your words of honour that you will tell no one at all anything\r\nabout the appearance or speed of the ship, that her engines were silent,\r\nor you suspect the ruffians on her to be English. That is most\r\nimportant. In fact, I must make it an order, under the powers with which\r\nI am invested by the Secretary of State. As an order, it cannot apply,\r\nto you, Mr. Van Adams, but you have been so kind and helpful hitherto\r\nthat I feel sure you'll give me your promise? You must see how necessary\r\nit is.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Adams was going to use his word-of-all-work, I saw it coming,\r\nwhen he changed his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I'm on,\" he said instead.\r\n\r\nThe two pilots gave me their assurances, and we walked out of the office\r\ntogether. As we went along the terrace Pring pointed down to the\r\nsea-drome, where the millionaire's air yacht, a beautiful boat, painted\r\ncream colour and black, was now resting at her moorings.\r\n\r\n\"The _Atlantis_ starts to-night,\" he said significantly.\r\n\r\n\"She will be escorted by an armed patrol,\" I said, \"until she meets one\r\nof the American A.P. ships in mid-ocean. Surely, you don't think there's\r\nany danger?\"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I had been so concentrated upon the matter in hand\r\nthat I had hardly given a thought to the outgoing liner. Can you blame\r\nme? Anyway, duty came before any private considerations. Now, Pring's\r\nremark started a new set of thoughts. I looked at him with great\r\nanxiety. He did not know the whole of my reason, but he saw that I was\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir John,\" he answered, \"I don't think the danger worth the waggle\r\nof a mule's ear. It was only a passing remark. It stands to reason that\r\nCaptain Kidd'll know that the police boats of two hemispheres are out\r\nlooking for him in swarms by now. He'll figure that out, sure. If he\r\nwas to start any of his stunts within the next few days, he'd have about\r\nas much chance as a fat man in Fiji.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may make your mind easy about the _Atlantis_, sir. Besides, as you\r\nsay, to put the lid on, she'll be escorted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" I said involuntarily, and then we both laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Royal Hotel at ten-thirty,\" I said. \"I shall be staying there\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that dinner with Connie. One of her greatest charms\r\nis her serene light-heartedness. It is not silliness or frivolity, don't\r\nthink that, but the bloom upon the fruit of a clear and happy nature\r\nwhose conscience is at rest. My girl wasn't a fool. She was not ignorant\r\nof evil and the grey sides of life. But they left her untouched. Perhaps\r\nher very simplicity, the gay and stainless courage that she wore like a\r\nflag through life, had helped her to her great success. The British\r\npublic might admire and enjoy the work of other artists, but they had\r\ntaken little Connie Shepherd to their hearts.\r\n\r\nShe was gay at our dinner, bubbling over with joy and fun. I did my best\r\nto respond, but it was rather difficult. There was a shadow on my mind,\r\nand it would not go away.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest old John!\" she said once, \"what is it? You're sad, inside of\r\nyou, and you're pretending you're not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling, in an hour or two you'll be gone. How can I be very happy?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"It's not that. You can't deceive me. I don't want\r\nto part, either, especially on this day of days. But we are both of us\r\nsensible, and we both know it's only for six weeks. You aren't in the\r\nleast sentimental--horrid word!--nor am I. We go deeper than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to tell you the truth\"--and it _was_ the truth--\"I am a bit\r\nunder the weather, and I can't quite say why. Perhaps it's reaction. But\r\nmost probably, it's because I have been hearing some news, a matter in\r\nconnection with my work which has excited me. It's a problem of\r\norganization I must solve at once. Forgive me, sweetheart!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, if you were not what you are, I should never have said 'yes.'\r\nNo one has ever had such a position as you at your age, and I know how\r\nyou've fought for it. I _love_ you to be preoccupied about your work.\"\r\n\r\nWe finished dinner, however, in a happier mood, and then walked down to\r\nthe sea-drome together. Connie's heavy luggage had gone to New York by\r\nsteamer a week ago. The two small trunks she had brought with her from\r\nLondon were already on board the _Atlantis_, and Wilson and Thumbwood\r\ncarried a couple of dressing-bags.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect evening. The sun, in going to rest, had hung the sky\r\nwith banners, golden and glorious. The music of a band upon the pier\r\ncame softly up to the terrace of the A.P. Station. Young men and maidens\r\nin summer clothes strolled up and down over the greens, and a\r\nsickle-shaped new moon was rising over Devonport and the Hamoaze.\r\n\r\nWe went down in the electric car, and boarded the _Atlantis_ from one of\r\nmy launches. She was lit up in all her triple decks, as we climbed\r\naboard by the saloon accommodation ladder, and a steward took Connie and\r\nher maid to her cabin, while I went to find my old friend, Captain\r\nSwainson.\r\n\r\nThe big, bearded man was sitting alone in his little room. There was a\r\ncup of black coffee by his side, and he was chewing an unlighted cigar.\r\nI saw at once that he had heard something.\r\n\r\n\"The very man!\" he cried, jumping up from his basket chair and gripping\r\nme warmly by the hand. \"I heard you were here, Sir John, and I made sure\r\nof seeing you before I started. Now what's all this? Sir Joshua's half\r\nout of his mind with worry, the offices are turned upside down, and Seth\r\nPring--confound him!--is as close as an oyster!\"\r\n\r\nI found out that he knew just what Sir Joshua knew, and no more. He was\r\nindignant but quite cool, inclined to minimize the whole affair.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that to tell him the whole truth would serve no good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nPilot Superintendent Lashmar, whom I was going to send in command of the\r\nescort, would, of course, know everything.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sending an escort with you half-way across,\" I said. \"Lashmar\r\nwill go--you know him?--in No. 1 Patrol Boat. It's heavily armed, and he\r\ncan shoot straighter than any man in the service. Got his experience in\r\nthe Great War.\"\r\n\r\n\"Escort be blowed!\" said hearty Captain Swainson. \"I can't think what\r\nold Pring was about to let himself be held up like that--though, of\r\ncourse, it's just as you wish, Sir John.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose there's the least need of it, Swainson. But this\r\nbusiness'll make a bit of a noise, and it looks well. Now I'll tell you\r\na secret. I'm engaged to be married! Settled it coming down in the train\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"The deuce you are! A thousand congratulations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. What's more, the lady is aboard your ship, and flies to New\r\nYork with you to-night. I want you to look after her for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can a duck swim? Well, this _is_ news! Now I understand about that\r\nescort! But do introduce me, Sir John. It will be more than a pleasure\r\nto make the young lady comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nWe went off to seek Connie, and found her sitting behind one of the\r\nmultiplex wind-screens on the saloon deck, listening to the music of a\r\npiano and violin that came through the open hatch of the palm-court\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nI remember that the musicians were playing a selection of old English\r\nairs, sweet, plaintive music, and had just got to \"The Last Rose of\r\nSummer.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not emotional, but when I hear that tune to-day--thank goodness, it\r\nisn't often!--I go out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to nine I stood on the Hoe and watched the _Atlantis_ start\r\nfor America. Her navigation lights were all turned on; the innumerable\r\nport-holes of the huge fusilage made an amber necklace below the immense\r\ngrey planes.\r\n\r\nThen, from the towers on the sea-drome wall the \"flare-path\" shot\r\nout--an avenue of white and steady light to guide the liner outwards.\r\nFrom the roof of the A.P. Station the compressed air-horn sent out three\r\nlong, brazen calls. I had arranged it so. It was my Godspeed to\r\nConstance. Old Swainson answered on his Klaxon, and then the liner began\r\nto move slowly over the glittering water. Every second she increased her\r\nspeed and lifted until she rose clear and slanted upwards. I had a\r\nvision of the mysterious silvery thing like a moth in the centre of the\r\nlight-beam, and then the flare-path shifted out to sea, and rose till it\r\nwas almost at a right angle with the water. The _Atlantis_ was\r\nspiralling up to her ten-thousand-foot level, and in a moment or two she\r\nwas nothing more than a speck.\r\n\r\nJust as I lost sight of her, Patrol Ship No. 1 lifted and followed like\r\na hawk after a heron, and then both ships were lost in the night.\r\n\r\nThe band on Plymouth Pier was still playing. The young men and maidens\r\nwere still strolling round the lawns in the moonlight. The air was sweet\r\nand pure, full of laughter and the voices of girls. But I went back to\r\nthe station with a heavy heart.\r\n\r\nTwo shorthand clerks and two telegraphists were waiting for me, and in\r\nthe next hour I got through an infinity of work. There was a mass of\r\ntelegrams to answer from America. They had been re-wired from Whitehall.\r\nI had to send out fifty or sixty signals to organize a complete patrol\r\nof the Atlantic air-lanes. There was a long and confidential \"wireless\"\r\nto my assistant, Muir Lockhart, in London, and last, though by no means\r\nleast, a condensed report of everything for the Home Secretary. It was\r\nafter ten when I had finished, and I walked slowly back to the \"Royal,\"\r\ndead tired in mind and body. When I came to think of it, I realized that\r\nthis had been one of the most eventful and exciting days of my life.\r\n\r\nThumbwood--you will hear a great deal about him before this narrative is\r\nover--was waiting in the hall. He hurried me upstairs to where a tepid\r\nbath dashed with ammonia was waiting. Five minutes in this, a brisk rub\r\ndown, a complete change into evening kit, a tea-cup of Bovril with a\r\ntablespoon of brandy and a pinch of celery salt in it--what Thumbwood\r\ncalled my \"bran-mash\"--and I was a new man again.\r\n\r\nFor a perfect valet commend me a man who has had charge of racehorses in\r\nhis time!\r\n\r\nThen I went down to meet Captain Pring. I saw at once, as I came into\r\nthe public rooms of the hotel, that the news was out. Groups of people\r\nwere standing together and talking earnestly. There was a buzz of\r\nsuppressed excitement, natural anywhere, but particularly so in the\r\nprincipal air-port of England.\r\n\r\nAnd there were special editions of the evening papers....\r\n\r\nThese--I got one and looked--had made the most of very scanty material.\r\nNothing like the whole truth had leaked out, but there was,\r\nnevertheless, a sensation of the first magnitude. I was recognized and\r\npointed to; a naval captain even spoke, and tried to pump me!--though\r\nhe soon found that there was nothing doing--and when Captain Pring came\r\ninto the lounge some idiot started to cheer, and there was what the\r\npapers describe as a \"scene.\"\r\n\r\nPring and I supped alone in a private room and had a long confidential\r\ntalk, in the course of which I learnt many things. I am not going to\r\ngive any details of that talk at present. It was momentous--it is enough\r\nto say that now--and has its proper place further on in the story.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Captain went at twelve, and I retired to bed. Thumbwood slept\r\nin a dressing-room opening out of my bedroom. By his couch was a\r\ntelephone, which I arranged was to be connected with the A.P. Station\r\nall night long. If any signal came Thumbwood was to take it, and, if\r\nimportant, wake me at once.\r\n\r\n... I am going to conclude this first portion of the narrative in as few\r\nlines as possible. Even to-day I shirk the writing of them.\r\n\r\nI was awakened suddenly to find my room blazing with light; I afterwards\r\nfound that the exact time was 2.30 a.m.\r\n\r\nThumbwood was standing by the bed. \"Sir John,\" he said hoarsely,\r\n\"there's a signal!\"\r\n\r\nOne glance at the lad's face was enough, and I set my teeth--hard.\r\n\r\n\"Bad news?\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible news, Sir John!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Atlantis_ attacked two hundred miles west of Cork. Captain Swainson\r\nand four other men shot dead. Patrol Boat No. 1 disabled. Commander\r\nLashmar and most of the crew killed. Signal got through by two survivors\r\nof crew, who managed to repair wireless.\"\r\n\r\nTwice I swallowed with a dry mouth. Thumbwood knew what I wanted to ask.\r\n\r\n\"The young lady, Sir John, and her maid ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir John. They were taken from among all the other passengers and\r\nput aboard the pirate ship, which then flew away with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE NEWSPAPERS IN FULL CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are to imagine, if you please, the private room of the Chief\r\nCommissioner of Air Police at Whitehall.\r\n\r\nA soft Turkey carpet of dull brick-reds and blues covers the parquet\r\nfloor. The walls are hung with pictures of famous airmen of the past,\r\ninventors, fighters, pioneers of the great commercial service of\r\nair-liners which now fills the skies and has shrunk the planet--for all\r\npractical purposes--to a fifth of its former size. There are two or\r\nthree huge writing-tables covered with crimson morocco; the chairs are\r\nthickly padded and luxurious. A range of tall windows looks down upon\r\nthe endless stir and movement of the wide street, where the nerves of\r\nEmpire meet in one central ganglion.\r\n\r\nStanding by one of these windows is a light-haired young man of thirty\r\nin a lounge suit of dark blue. He wears a rather heavy,\r\ncarefully-trimmed moustache, and his face is seamed and furrowed with\r\nanxiety and grey from want of rest.\r\n\r\nThus you see me in London, two days after Thumbwood brought the\r\nterrible news to my bedroom in the hotel at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Hercules Nichelson, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Flying\r\nCorps, had been with me for half an hour, and was just taking his leave.\r\n\r\n\"Then all that is satisfactorily arranged, Sir John,\" he said. \"We shall\r\nsupplement your patrol ships with three war-ships at Plymouth and three\r\nat the Scillies. They will, of course, be air cruisers, both faster and\r\nbetter armed than your boats, and between us both we shall put an end to\r\nthis pest before many days are over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely trust so,\" I said. \"And I do not see how it is possible\r\nthat there should be any further outrages. The net will be too close.\r\nAmerica, with its much greater coastal area, is taking extraordinary\r\nprecautions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be impossible for these devilish scoundrels to escape,\" the\r\nGeneral repeated with confidence--the onus of it all was not falling\r\nupon _him!_--\"and now, we quite understand one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, I think, Sir Hercules.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your chief station officer is to be in full command, under you, at each\r\nair-port.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was your suggestion, Sir Hercules, and since it came from you, I do\r\nthink it would be best. My men are always patrolling the air-lines. The\r\norganization is complete already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. And as for my fellows, they will be proud to serve under such\r\ngallant and experienced officers as those of the A.P.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's kind of you to say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. It is the truth. And now, as an older man, let me give you\r\na little advice, if I am not taking a liberty. Don't let this affect you\r\ntoo much, Sir John. Every sane man knows that neither you nor anyone\r\nelse could have avoided what has happened, or have provided against it.\r\nIt is a great thing to have an acute sense of responsibility; I honour\r\nyou for it. But don't overdo it. I know the strain you are enduring.\r\nDon't let it go too far. If you were to break down now, that would be a\r\nfinal disaster....\"\r\n\r\nThe kind, white-haired old man shook me warmly by the hand, and left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately young Bickenhall, my private secretary, came in.\r\n\"Here is the morning's Press, sir,\" he said, and upon my table he put\r\ndown various columns cut from the journals of that morning--all dealing\r\nwith the sensational and terrible events on the Atlantic that were now\r\nthe common knowledge of the world.\r\n\r\nI sat down to glance through them--I was keeping an iron grip upon\r\nmyself these times--in order to gauge public opinion. It occurs to me\r\nthat, in order to acquaint you with the progress of events from my\r\nawakening at Plymouth till the morning of which I speak, I cannot do\r\nbetter than quote a paragraph here and there from the daily papers. It\r\nwill bring us up to date more quickly and concisely than in any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThis, then, from one of the leading London journals, a weighty, somewhat\r\nponderous sheet, with considerable influence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... We have given an account of the first attack upon the air-liner\r\n_Albatros_, under command of Captain Pring, whose conduct in such a\r\ntrying situation did not deviate from the best traditions of our British\r\naviators. Most people would have thought that after such a dastardly\r\noutrage, the unknown pirate would have been content to rest upon his\r\ninfamous laurels and retire to his lair, with the valuable booty he had\r\nsecured. But it was not so. With an audacity unparalleled in the annals\r\nof crime, this vulture, on the very next night, commits an outrage\r\nwhich, for ferocity and daring, makes the first one seem like a mere\r\nfrolic.\r\n\r\n\"It is now possible to disentangle something of the truth from the\r\nvarious conflicting stories that have reached us, and it is, moreover,\r\nconfirmed in its essential details by the authorities of the Air Police\r\nat Whitehall, who have issued a guarded statement.\r\n\r\n\"It appears that two nights ago the famous air-liner _Atlantis_ left\r\nthe Plymouth sea-drome about nine in the evening. The Captain, Commander\r\nPilot Swainson, was one of the best known and trusted officers in the\r\nTransatlantic service. He did not anticipate the slightest danger. Sir\r\nJohn Custance, Chief Commissioner of the Air Police of Great Britain,\r\nwas himself at Plymouth, having hurried down from London upon receiving\r\nnews of the first piracy. Sir John insisted that the _Atlantis_ should\r\nbe escorted, for half of her journey to America, by the armed Patrol\r\nShip '1,' under command of Superintendent Pilot-Commander Lashmar,\r\nD.S.O., himself an officer of great distinction. Half-way across the\r\nAtlantic the liner was to be met by a similar escort of the United\r\nStates A.P., and let us here say that it is difficult to tell what other\r\nprecautions Sir John Custance could have devised.\r\n\r\n\"The _Atlantis_ carried the Royal Mail and a full complement of\r\npassengers, among whom were some distinguished names. Mr. Bootfeller, of\r\nthe United States Senate, Mr. Greenwell, the well-known publisher, the\r\nDuke of Perth, and 'Walty Priest,' the cinema 'star,' were among the\r\nmen, while in the list of ladies was Miss Constance Shepherd, a young\r\nactress, of whom it is not too much to say that she has endeared herself\r\nto the British public.\r\n\r\n\"About two o'clock in the morning disastrous and terrible news began to\r\nfilter through to the Plymouth wireless stations. It can be summarized\r\nas follows: When not more than two hundred and fifty miles west of\r\nIreland, the patrol ship, which was flying three miles or so behind the\r\n_Atlantis_, was suddenly attacked by an unknown airship. The moon had\r\nset, the ten-thousand-feet level was dark, and the attack was delivered\r\nwithout the slightest warning. Patrol Ship No. 1 was instantly disabled\r\nby a rain of shells. Captain Lashmar was shot dead, and with him\r\nperished all of the crew except three men, one of whom was so seriously\r\nwounded that his life is despaired of, the other two being only slightly\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n\"An utter wreck, the patrol ship was just able to descend to the water,\r\nwhere she rested like a wounded and dying bird.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile the unknown ship caught up with the _Atlantis_ and\r\ncommenced--as in the case of the _Albatros_--with shooting away her\r\nwireless aerials. The rudder and stern propeller were then destroyed,\r\nand the great liner forced to plane to the surface of the water. Six\r\nmasked and armed ruffians went aboard of her, and a systematic looting\r\nof the ship commenced. Captain Swainson could not bear this. He drew a\r\nrevolver and shot one of the pirates dead. Then, calling on his crew to\r\nassist him, he made a determined rush, regardless of consequences. The\r\nfight was unequal. Captain Swainson was the only defender who carried\r\nfire-arms, while the robbers were provided with heavy automatic pistols.\r\n\r\n\"Five men of the _Atlantis_ were killed almost instantly, and the rest\r\ncowed, while the systematic robbery continued. And now, alas! 'horrors\r\nupon horror's head accumulate.' Their evil work completed, the ruffians\r\nsought out Miss Constance Shepherd and her maid, Miss Wilson, from among\r\nthe passengers. These unfortunate ladies were forced at the pistol's\r\nmouth to embark upon the pirates' small boat, in which they were rowed\r\nrapidly to the pirate ship and taken on board. The ship then rose from\r\nthe water and was lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile two heroes were at work. On board the broken patrol ship two\r\nable navigators, Paget and Fowles, were wounded, indeed, but not\r\nentirely disabled. Both men had some knowledge of wireless, and with\r\nsuperhuman toil, as the hours went on, they contrived to rig up a\r\ntemporary apparatus which, at last, served to send out a brief account\r\nof the disaster and a call for help.\r\n\r\n\"When rescue ships arrived at early dawn, they found that the patrol\r\nship had drifted close to the _Atlantis_, and that Dr. Weatherall, the\r\nsurgeon of the liner, had swum aboard the No. 1 and rendered what help\r\nhe could to the wounded men.\r\n\r\n\"Press representatives are at Plymouth, but, so far, few of the\r\npassengers of the _Atlantis_ have been able, and none have been allowed\r\nby the authorities, to make personal statements for publication. This\r\nembargo, we are assured, will be removed by this evening.\r\n\r\n\"This is a precise account of what has happened. We must now turn to the\r\nconsideration of the situation....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother journal, a weekly one this time, headed its remarks with a\r\nportrait of my unhappy self. Underneath was written: \"The Man the\r\nAtlantic Pirates tricked!\" The rag had an immense circulation in all the\r\ntap rooms of England.\r\n\r\nWell, I would see what the blackguards of the country were reading about\r\nme. Shrewd young Bickenhall wouldn't have brought the unclean thing in\r\nif he hadn't thought it worth while. I give it for what it's worth:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Poor Johnny Custance! You're up against it good and thick to-day, and\r\nno mistake, and Paul Pry\"--this was the signature of the tout who wrote\r\nthe article--\"can't say he's very sorry for you. For some time past a\r\nlittle bird has been whispering in the clubs that all is not well in the\r\nState of Denmark--to wit, the office of the Commissioner of Air Police\r\nat Whitehall. The aristocratic young gentlemen who daily condescend to\r\ndrop into this palatial edifice for an hour or two have long held the\r\nreputation of being the best dressed of all our minor Government\r\nofficials, and, considering the salaries they draw from the public\r\npurse, this is not surprising. But I have never yet heard that they did\r\nany work worth mentioning, or, indeed, anything to justify their\r\nprecious and beautiful existence.\r\n\r\n\"Flying Police we must have, and never has the necessity for them been\r\ngreater than at this moment; but there is a vast deal of difference from\r\nthe handy pilot of a patrol ship at Plymouth or Portland and the\r\nbureaucratic popinjays of Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Custance, Bart., is the typical Government official of the\r\nmusical comedy or the comic paper. He is an aristocrat who, after a\r\nshort experience in the air, is shoved into the highly-paid and\r\nresponsible position he holds without any reason that the man in the\r\nstreet can understand. A baronet, and, if report speaks truly, a man of\r\nconsiderable private means, I have--in common with many other\r\npeople--often asked myself what possible qualification this young\r\ngentleman can have for his job. Johnny is a most estimable person, no\r\ndoubt, in private life. I have heard it remarked that his moustache is\r\none of the most perfect things in the West End of London, and he is\r\nfrequently to be seen adorning a stall or box at the Parthenon Theatre.\r\nBut few people have ever taken him seriously as the head of our Air\r\nPolice, and now nobody will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a row of stars here, as if Mr. Paul Pry paused for breath, or\r\nwas stopping to pick up another handful of mud, and then he went on\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If the nation is called upon to pay thousands and thousands a year for\r\nthe upkeep of an efficient service of Air Police, it is entitled to see\r\nthat it gets it, and that the man in charge is able to provide it. What\r\nhas happened? A crew of murdering ruffians in an airship have looted two\r\nof our greatest air-liners, slaughtered several people, kidnapped one of\r\nour most popular actresses, and escaped scot-free. Vanished into the\r\nwide! While Sir John Custance twiddles his thumbs in Whitehall and calls\r\nupon the air forces of the Admiralty and War Office to supplement his\r\nown miserably inefficient organization.\r\n\r\n\"As usual, we are not without some very special and exclusive\r\ninformation in this office. My readers know from past experience that\r\ntheir Paul is not easily caught napping. I believe that I shall have\r\nsomething to say that will startle everyone in next week's number,\r\nthough, for certain reasons, I cannot be more explicit at present.\r\nBefore concluding these remarks, however, I must say a word or two about\r\nthe extraordinary and sinister disappearance of delightful Constance\r\nShepherd. Sad as it is to hear of brave men shot down while doing their\r\nduty, there is something peculiarly terrible in the carrying off of the\r\nlittle lady to whom London owes so much. Dear little Connie! We of\r\nBohemia knew and loved you well! Many is the happy hour that Paul Pry\r\nhas spent in your company, many the bumper of bubbly water he has\r\nquaffed to your success!\r\n\r\n\"No one could possibly have foreseen such a tragic ending to the\r\nAmerican journey which Miss Shepherd set out upon with such high hopes.\r\nAnd yet, there was not wanting a slight shadow of premonition. Only a\r\nweek ago she said to me: 'Paul, I'm not so sure, after all, that\r\neverything will go well. There are certain things. I can't tell you of\r\nthem----' But I must refrain from betraying a confidence. Let it be\r\nenough to say that my little friend had her moments of dejection, when\r\nshe was not entirely happy about the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI put down the paper and rang for Bickenhall. \"You've read this, I\r\nsuppose?\" I asked, pointing to it.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Lies, of course,\" he said; \"mere words to fill up the\r\ncolumn.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. Still, the man hints all sorts of things, damn him! And one\r\ncan't neglect any possible clue.\" I was in a raging fury, and Bickenhall\r\nsaw it, though he was far from suspecting the true cause.\r\n\r\n\"The office is in the Strand,\" he said, \"three minutes by taxi. I'll go\r\nand interview this Paul Pry and put the fear of God into him.\"\r\n\r\nI knew my Bickenhall. He is an energetic and hefty young man, and though\r\nI had little hopes that he would discover anything of value, I had a\r\nshrewd suspicion that Mr. Paul Pry was about to experience a peculiarly\r\nunpleasant ten minutes.\r\n\r\nI was right in both my conjectures.\r\n\r\nThe secretary returned in half an hour. \"Just a ramp,\" he said. \"I found\r\na greasy ruffian smelling of gin in a back room, and frightened him out\r\nof his life. He's never met Miss Shepherd, and has no private\r\ninformation whatever. Will apologize in any manner you like.\"\r\n\r\nI am not going to bother you with what the journalists wrote. There were\r\nhundreds of columns of suggestions, conjecture, reproof, alarm, and so\r\nforth. On the whole my department was let down fairly lightly, and I was\r\nglad. Please don't think that I cared twopence for myself. I did not.\r\nBut I should have bitterly resented any serious reflections on my staff,\r\nofficers and men, who were, and are, as able and loyal a body as can be\r\nfound anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILIAR SPIRIT OF MR. VAN ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt mid-day I had an appointment with the Home Secretary. He received me\r\nwith the utmost kindness, and we had half an hour of highly confidential\r\ntalk. The purport of it will appear later. This is not the place for it.\r\n\r\nTowards the end I informed him that I had a request to make.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" he answered at once, \"and let me repeat that the Government\r\nhas every confidence in you, Sir John. Don't take this too hardly, I beg\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\nI had a sudden impulse. \"I trust,\" I said, \"that my anxiety for the\r\npublic welfare is in no degree overshadowed by a private sorrow. Indeed,\r\nI am sure that it isn't. But, if I may speak in confidence, I should\r\nlike you to know, sir, that I was engaged to be married to Miss\r\nConstance Shepherd.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a perceptible silence. I heard the great man take a long\r\ninward breath, and murmur to himself, \"Poor fellow!\" Then he did the\r\nright, the quite perfect thing: he stretched out his hand, and took mine\r\nin a firm, warm grasp.\r\n\r\nWhen I could speak, I returned to business.\r\n\r\n\"My request, sir, is this. I want to disappear for a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disappear, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what it amounts to. Practically, I am going to ask for four\r\nweeks' leave of absence. It must be private, though. If the news were\r\npublished the public would misunderstand, and think I was deserting my\r\npost in a time of difficulty and danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas I want to investigate this affair in my own way. I believe that\r\nthe theories of the Press and public, and also those of Scotland\r\nYard--with whom I have been in consultation--are quite wrong. Nor do my\r\ncommunications with America give me any reason to change my opinion.\r\nThis is a matter of life and death to me. I owe the Government, who have\r\npromoted me so rapidly to the high position I occupy, a solution of this\r\nmystery. I owe them and the public that the fiends who have committed\r\nthese outrages should be brought to justice. And, if God allows me, I\r\nwill do it. My honour and that of my department are at stake. Those two\r\nthings come before anything else. In addition, I have the private\r\nreasons of which I have told you. And, in order to succeed, I am\r\npersuaded that my way is the only way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have certainly the strongest motives a man well could have to urge\r\nyou on. But can you be a little more explicit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to leave Mr. Muir Lockhart in charge at the office. He is\r\nperfectly capable of taking charge. He has everything at his fingers'\r\nends. And I shall arrange that he can always communicate with me at any\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary thought for a moment, and drummed with his fingers on\r\nthe arm of his chair. He had been a famous barrister, and renowned for\r\nthe perfection of his turn-out. His finger-nails were pink and polished\r\nas the light fell upon them, and I wondered if he had them manicured.\r\n\r\nThen he looked up. \"Very well, do as you like,\" he said suddenly. \"I\r\ntake it that you know what you're about. And heartfelt good wishes for\r\nyour success.\"\r\n\r\n... This is how I plunged into a series of dangerous adventures, a dark\r\nunderworld of crime and almost superhuman cunning, probably without\r\nparallel in modern times.\r\n\r\nArrangements were soon made at Whitehall. Muir Lockhart was an\r\nunderstanding man, and by three o'clock in the afternoon I walked out\r\ninto the sunshine free from all official cares for a month. I took a\r\nlong, deep breath as I crossed the Horse Guards Parade and made my way\r\nto the long, green vista of the Mall. \"The first act is over,\" I\r\nthought. \"The curtain is rising on the real drama. Somewhere in this\r\nworld there is a man whose discovery and death I owe to Society and to\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I was a man who never failed to pay a debt.\r\n\r\nI have given you but little indication of my mental state during the\r\nlast few days. It won't bear much writing about even now. A cold fury,\r\ninstead of blood, came and went in my veins, and my heart was ice. Every\r\nnow and again, especially when I was alone, agony for which there is,\r\nthere can be, no name got hold of me, and sported with me as the wind\r\nsports with a leaf. I suppose I had a tiny foretaste of what is felt by\r\na soul that is eternally damned. I _dared_ not think too much of\r\nConstance and her fate. If I had let myself go that way the running\r\nwaters would have risen and overwhelmed me utterly. But, thank God, my\r\nintellect held. The streak of hardness which had served me so well in my\r\ncareer, and had enabled me to push to the top at an early age, came to\r\nthe rescue now. Every faculty was sharpened; the will concentrated to a\r\nsingle purpose. I was alone, and I walked in darkness, but I was\r\nconscious of Power--charged to the brim as a battery is charged with the\r\nelectric fluid. As I walked calmly up St. James', on the way to my\r\nchambers, I doubt if a more single-minded and dangerous man than I\r\nwalked the streets of London.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew, by some mysterious intuition, that I should succeed in the\r\ntask before me. I had not, as yet, more than the most rudimentary idea\r\nhow I was going to set about it, but I should succeed. Don't\r\nmisunderstand me. I had hardly any hope of seeing my dear love alive\r\nagain. I believed that all the joy of life was finally extinguished. But\r\njustice--call it vengeance rather--remained, and I was as sure that I\r\nwas the chosen instrument of that as I was that I had just passed\r\nbetween Marlborough House and the Palace of St. James.\r\n\r\nMy expensive but delightful chambers in Half Moon Street were on the\r\nsecond floor--sitting-room, dining-room, bed and dressing rooms and\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room was panelled in cedar-wood, which had been stained a\r\ndelicate olive-green, with the mouldings of the panels picked out in\r\ndull gold. Connie and her gay young friends, when they came to have tea\r\nwith me, or supper after the theatre, used to say that it was one of the\r\nmost charming rooms in London.\r\n\r\nI had spent an infinity of time and money on it, determined that it\r\nshould be \"just so.\" For instance, the carpet was from Kairowan in\r\nTunisia, and had taken a whole family of Arab weavers five years to\r\nmake. Never was there a more perfect blue--not the crude peacock colour\r\nof the cheaper Oriental rugs, but a blue infused with a silver-ash\r\nshade, contrasting marvellously with the warm brick-reds and tawny\r\nyellows. It was a bargain at four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nI had hung only half a dozen pictures in this room, all modern and all\r\ngood. My \"Boys Bathing,\" by Charles Conder--better known as the painter\r\nof marvellous fans--was a masterpiece of sunlight and sea foam which\r\nmade me the envy of half the collectors in town. Then I had a William\r\nNicholson--\"Chelsea Ware\"--that was extraordinarily fascinating. It was\r\njust some old Chelsea plates and a jug standing on a table. It doesn't\r\nsound fascinating, I know, but the painting was so brilliant, there was\r\nsuch vision in the way it was seen, that one could look at it for hours.\r\n\r\nThere was an open hearth of rough red brick in the room, deep and\r\nsquare, and when there was a fire it burned in a gipsy brazier of iron.\r\nI had a lot of trouble to get this last of the right shape, and finally\r\nit had to be made for me, from the design of an artist in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nSuch a room, with its perfect colour harmonies and severe lines,\r\nrequired no knick-knacks. Nothing small or petty, however beautiful in\r\nitself, could be allowed there. I had two cabinets of magnificent china\r\nin my dining-room, but china would have been quite out of place here.\r\nAlong one wall, about four feet from the floor, was a single shelf of\r\nold pewter--cups and flagons of the Tudor period with the double-rose\r\nhall-mark--and that was all.\r\n\r\nAs I entered and flung myself wearily into a chair, the afternoon\r\nsunlight poured in through the half-drawn curtains of sea-green silk. In\r\nthe ceiling a hidden electric fan was whirring, and the room was\r\ndeliciously cool. And as I looked round, the place seemed hateful beyond\r\nall expression. I was sick of it, loathed its beauty and comfort; an\r\ninsane desire came to take a hammer and wreak havoc there as my eyes\r\nfell on the only photograph in the room. It was one of Constance, in a\r\nframe of dull silver, studded with turquoises, and she had given it to\r\nme no longer than a fortnight ago.\r\n\r\nThumbwood slept at the top of the house. He came in, after I had been\r\nresting for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"I've made the necessary arrangements, Charles,\" I said, \"and we shall\r\nstart operations at once.\" I had no secrets from this devoted friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to hear it, Sir John. I've been round the town this morning, and\r\nthere's a lot of talk.\"\r\n\r\nHe followed me into the sitting-room and brought me cigars.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he went on confidentially, \"a gentleman's servant, especially\r\nif he belongs to the club just off Jermyn Street, and more specially\r\nstill if he's been a racing man, hears all that's going on quicker than\r\nanyone. This morning I've been talking to the porters and valets of two\r\nof the best clubs, Sir John. Then I 'ad a crack with Meggit, the\r\nbookmaker, what does all the St. James' smaller commissions, and after\r\nthat I strolled to the Parthenon Theatre, and took out the stage\r\ndoor-keeper and filled him up and made 'im talk a bit. 'Im and me is\r\ngreat friends consequent of my taking so many messages and flowers for\r\nyou, sir, when Miss Shepherd was acting there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I see you haven't wasted your time.\" I smiled inwardly at\r\nThumbwood's idea of helping me.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir John. I've learned a lot of funny little things, just trifles,\r\nso to say, but they may prove useful later on. There's one thing you\r\nought to know at once. Them theatricals have been talking, and it's all\r\nover town that Miss Shepherd travelled down to Plymouth with you. It's\r\ncertain to be in the papers this afternoon, if it ain't already. There's\r\nbeen half a dozen reporters buzzing round the theatre this morning.\"\r\n\r\nI ground my teeth with anger, but only for a moment. Of course, the\r\nthing was inevitable. There was only one thing to do.\r\n\r\nI took up the telephone on the writing-table and got put on to the\r\n_Evening Wire_. \"I am Sir John Custance,\" I said to the editor. \"I hear\r\nthat there is a good deal of talk going about London in respect of Miss\r\nConstance Shepherd and myself. To avoid the least misconception, I\r\nauthorize you to state, in your next edition, that Miss Shepherd and I\r\nwere engaged to be married. I'll send my servant down to your office at\r\nonce, with a note confirming this conversation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the only way, much as I hated it, to stop malicious gossip, and I\r\nscribbled a chit to the editor.\r\n\r\n\"Get into a taxi and take that at once,\" I said to Thumbwood. As I gave\r\nhim the letter, there was a ring at the front-door bell.\r\n\r\nThe little man went out and I heard voices, one harsh and deep, that\r\nseemed familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" I asked as Charles returned. \"I can't see anyone....\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't take any denial, sir. It's the American gentleman who picked\r\nup Captain Pring after the attack on the _Albatros_. Says he must see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Van Adams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir John.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show him in.\"\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards I was shaking hands with the thickset man whose jaw\r\nwas like a pike's and whose eyes resembled animated steel. Thumbwood\r\nwent off with the letter. I heard the front door close after him.\r\n\r\nNow I don't suppose at that moment I would have seen any other man in\r\nLondon unconnected with my office at Whitehall. I didn't want to see the\r\nmillionaire, but directly he was inside the room my irritation vanished.\r\nHe had meant to see me. He had now accomplished his end, and I had a\r\nfirm conviction that sentries with fixed bayonets wouldn't have kept him\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe sat down quietly in the chair I indicated, and took a cigar with\r\ngreat deliberation. I was not in the least impatient. I knew now that I\r\nwas glad that he had come, and waited for him to begin. When he did\r\nspeak the harsh voice was considerably modified, and no one whatever\r\ncould have said that he was an American.\r\n\r\n\"Any success I may have made in life,\" he said without preliminary, \"has\r\ncome from the faculty of judging men. I started, as a youth, with this\r\npower in a more than ordinary degree. I've been developing it ever\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\nHe puffed thoughtfully at his cigar. He had said this with calm\r\ndetermination, not in the least as if he were speaking of himself, but\r\nmerely as a man stating a fact which would be useful a little later on.\r\n\r\nFor my part I said nothing. I felt as though I was playing a sort of\r\ndecorous game with rigid rules. To speak then would be to revoke!\r\n\r\n\"... And, though the ordinary man does not like to hear such a\r\nstatement, I have a pretty good idea of you, Sir John. You're not an\r\nordinary man. That's why I'm here. I'll put it in two words. I want to\r\nhelp you. I _can_ help you. It is for you to say if you want me.\"\r\n\r\nNow there could only be one answer to a question like that. The man in\r\nmy arm-chair was one of the most powerful men on earth. Moreover, his\r\nreputation stood high. He was no financial pirate. The whole world\r\ntrusted him.\r\n\r\n\"I answer that, Mr. Van Adams, with a single word: Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded as if pleased. \"Quite!\" he said, and then, half turning in his\r\nchair, \"of course I don't ask you to tell me any official secrets....\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at that. The Government would have let this man know all there\r\nwas to be known upon his simple request.\r\n\r\nHe saw that I understood. \"There are none for one thing,\" I told him.\r\n\"You know exactly as much as my department knows, as I told the Home\r\nSecretary this morning. There are no developments, except, of course,\r\nthe protective measures we and the States are taking. The one thing I\r\n_can_ tell you, and which is in strict confidence, is that I have\r\narranged for my official duties to be carried on by my assistant for a\r\nmonth. From this afternoon I am absolutely free to do what I like and go\r\nwhere I like. No one will know of this but my confidential servant. I\r\nintend to devote this evening to mapping out a plan of campaign.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good, Sir John. That is just what I wanted to hear. Let me\r\nexplain my motives. They are not complicated. One is that, as one of the\r\nchief money-brokers of the world, I naturally want to prevent any\r\nfinancial panic. Next, I am a bit of a sportsman in my way. I like\r\nhunting things down. This pursuit appeals to me a good deal. And,\r\nlast--when I was five-and-thirty, a desperate gang of crooks in San\r\nFrancisco kidnapped my little daughter Pearl--she that is Duchess of\r\nShropshire now--and held her up to ransom. It was before you took\r\nnotice, for I'm close on seventy, but the episode created some\r\nconsiderable stir at the time. I can pretty well guess what you are\r\ngoing through now.\"\r\n\r\nAs he looked at me his eyes were no longer like living steel, nor his\r\njaw like a pike's.\r\n\r\nSo he also knew! I mumbled something or other.\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" he answered quickly, and then went on: \"In thinking over\r\nvarious ways in which I could be of use I have come to a certain\r\nconclusion. Money, I suppose, won't help you--though, of course, any sum\r\nis available?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the Government behind me, and I myself am not poor, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as I thought. In England I myself can do nothing _personally_\r\nthat others cannot do as well. In America I have every sort of\r\ninfluence....\"\r\n\r\nI looked him in the face. \"I am not going to trouble about America in\r\nthe very least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite! I see what you mean. And I am absolutely of your opinion. Now\r\nI'll come to what I _can_ do for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose slowly from his chair and came up to me. When he spoke he had\r\ndropped his voice a full tone.\r\n\r\n\"I must let you into one or two little secrets about myself,\" he said.\r\n\"In the first place, a man so rich as I am does not become so without\r\nmaking powerful and unscrupulous enemies. Also, American methods are\r\ndirect. It will probably surprise you to hear that my life has been\r\nattempted twelve or fifteen times, but that is the case. Some of the\r\nmethods were diabolically ingenious, too! However, I stand here to-day,\r\nquite unharmed and quite safe. Why? I'll tell you.\r\n\r\n\"Quite early in my successful career I saw what would happen. I watched\r\nother men assassinated, and was determined that it shouldn't happen to\r\nme. How was it to be avoided? I thought that point out very carefully,\r\nand came to a conclusion. I must find, and then attach to my person,\r\nsomeone of extraordinary intelligence, cunning, skill and personal\r\nprowess. My ambitions ran high. I wanted someone who would devote his\r\nwhole life to my service, a familiar spirit, no less! It took me three\r\nyears of steady work to find that familiar spirit--to discover the exact\r\ncombination of qualities I required. But a multi-millionaire is the\r\nMagician of to-day, and I have a Genie as clever and infallible as any\r\nout of the old 'Arabian Nights.' I pay him the salary of a cinema star,\r\nand I say, meaning every word of it, that there isn't another like him\r\nin the world. Do you think this tall talk, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly amazing, but I could not but believe him.\r\n\r\n\"You startle and you interest me deeply,\" I replied. \"You are to be\r\ncongratulated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am--on a unique human possession. Well, you can't have failed to see\r\nwhat I'm driving at. I will lend you this man, place his services\r\nentirely at your disposal, for a month!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two I was silent. I believed every word that Van Adams\r\nsaid, and I was not hesitating--only just letting the offer, and what it\r\nmeant, sink into my mind. It became plain. It was like the offer of a\r\nrope-ladder to a man in prison, a light and a pickaxe to an entombed\r\nminer.\r\n\r\n\"It is the most generous offer I've ever heard of, Mr. Van Adams. I\r\ncan't express my thanks. You really mean this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. And as an ounce of proof is worth a ton of talk--allow me to\r\nintroduce you to Mr. Danjuro!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned round as he spoke and I with him. Then I gave a cry of\r\nastonishment, which I could not have kept back to save my life.\r\n\r\nStanding some yard or so away was a little Japanese gentleman, not much\r\nmore than five feet high. He wore gold pince-nez, a neat blue lounge\r\nsuit and brown boots. There was nothing noticeable about him in any way,\r\nexcept an unusually fine cranial development--a massive forehead and a\r\ngreat space between the corners of the dark eyes and the ears.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, how did he get here?\" I said.\r\n\r\nVan Adams laughed. \"I daresay he'll tell you; I don't know,\" he\r\nanswered. \"I just told him to be here. I wanted to give you an object\r\nlesson, in fact. Now, Mr. Danjuro knows all that I know. You can trust\r\nhim absolutely. He knows what is in front of him, and he knows where to\r\nfind me when I'm wanted. Now I'll leave you together and say\r\ngood-afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone almost before I could thank him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMR. DANJURO, THINKING MACHINE, EXPLAINS HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Won't you sit down?\" I said foolishly. The little Japanese bowed\r\npolitely and did so.\r\n\r\nI was at a loss what to say. My mind was in a whirl. I wanted to laugh,\r\nto call Van Adams back, but my dominating sensation was one of supreme\r\nannoyance. So this natty, commonplace little Asiatic was the\r\nmillionaire's \"familiar spirit\"! He was unique, was he! I cursed myself\r\nfor several kinds of fool to have saddled myself with this amazing\r\nstranger at the beginning of my work. At any rate, I reflected\r\nirritably, as I sat down opposite, I could easily send him off on some\r\nwild-goose chase or another....\r\n\r\nYes! I was never more annoyed in my life, and my annoyance lasted for\r\nexactly sixty seconds. Without the slightest embarrassment of any sort,\r\nand with no preliminaries at all, Mr. Danjuro plunged into business. His\r\nvoice was clear and low. He had no accent of any kind, though his\r\nEnglish was a trifle pedantic and scholarly. He spoke as impersonally as\r\na gramophone.\r\n\r\n\"... I am entirely with you, Sir John, in your opinion that it is not in\r\nthe United States of America, but here--in England--that we shall solve\r\nthe mystery surrounding this dark business.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I never said ...\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled faintly, almost wearily. \"And since I have the great honour to\r\nbe associated with you, I trust you will allow me to suggest a plan of\r\ncampaign.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to try and think one out to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a privilege to assist. I have come in contact with many crafty\r\nand malignant criminals during the last thirty years, but here one\r\ndetects a master. It will be a pleasure indeed to hunt him down. Have I\r\nyour honourable permission to smoke?\"\r\n\r\nWith one hand he produced a square of rice paper and a pinch of tobacco\r\nfrom his pocket, and rolled a cigarette on his knee like a conjuring\r\ntrick. He had not raised his voice, but a sudden gleam came into the\r\noblique black eyes which suggested the deep but hidden ferocity of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nHe resumed. \"From all I have gathered, and I have talked much with\r\nCaptain Pring, Mr. Rickaby and the passengers of the _Albatros_, we\r\nhave to look for a man who is (1) an aviator in the first rank; (2) an\r\ninventor and mechanical genius, or able to command the services of such;\r\n(3) a person of some wealth or able to procure money.\"\r\n\r\nI followed him completely and said so. From what we already knew these\r\ndeductions were perfectly fair ones.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you. Now we come to the man himself. I believe him to be a\r\nperson of education, and one who has held a good social position. He is\r\nalso desperate in his circumstances, and a person to whom material\r\npleasure is the highest good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rickaby said that the men who came aboard the _Albatros_ spoke like\r\neducated people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Our field of search already begins to grow narrower. Am I right in\r\nsaying that every aviator in this country must pass an examination and\r\nbe licensed before he is allowed to fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so. All aviators, professional or amateur, must have a licence\r\nfrom the Air Police. This is registered. I have already had the records\r\nfor the past ten years searched at Whitehall. But this has yielded no\r\nresult. There is no one who could possibly be our man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was well thought of, Sir John, if I may say so. But in my opinion we\r\nshall have to go back a good deal further than ten years. We now come\r\nto the question of the pirate airship itself and its peculiar qualities.\r\nLet us fix upon one--the silence of its engines. I am aware that the\r\nconstructors of motor engines have been busy upon this problem for\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with little result. The problem has not been solved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except by our unknown friends. I have already examined all the recent\r\npatents of silencing devices at your patent office here. I spent\r\nyesterday morning there, and found nothing. The significance of that is\r\nobvious. Any ordinary inventor who had discovered something of such\r\nimportance would protect it at once. We can therefore make up our minds\r\nthat in no regular motor-engineering works throughout this country has\r\nthe complete silencer been evolved. It would be impossible for the most\r\nbrilliant inventor to keep such a thing entirely to himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again the field shrinks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir John. We now have a man of the character already indicated,\r\nwho, as he has undoubtedly constructed silent engines, must have done so\r\nin secret. He must have had private engineering works in order to make\r\nan important part of his machines. The point is, where? On the\r\nContinent? I think not. He would be watched far more carefully than in\r\nthis country. America is still more unlikely. Let us assume England.\r\nHaving done so, we can, I think, safely deduce that for obvious reasons\r\nthis man and his confederates--for we know he has them--would endeavour\r\nto build his pirate ship as near as possible to the place he intended to\r\nuse as the base of his operations. And that base--if your experience\r\nbears me out--is certainly somewhere or other on the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, one would say that it must be so, Mr. Danjuro. And yet it\r\nseems impossible. The whole coast of England is patrolled by the\r\ncoastguards. For all practical purposes England is no bigger than a\r\npocket-handkerchief. I thought of Scotland and the Northern Isles. I\r\nthought of wild places on the Irish coast. I have had a fleet of\r\nairships surveying and photographing these places for the last two days.\r\nNo hangar bigger than a motor-shed could have escaped their notice. All\r\nthe land police of the villages round the coasts have been interrogated\r\nby Scotland Yard. Nothing, nothing whatever has been seen.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke with some passion, for I felt it. The sense of impotence was\r\nmaddening.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese rolled another cigarette. As he did so the door opened and\r\nThumbwood came in.\r\n\r\n\"I delivered your note, Sir John, and the editor's compliments and\r\nthanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charles,\" I said, \"this gentleman here is Mr. Danjuro. He is going to\r\nhelp us. Mr. Danjuro is \"--I hesitated for a moment, really it was\r\ndifficult to describe him!--\"is one of the foremost detectives in the\r\nworld!\"\r\n\r\nThumbwood's hand went up to his forehead in the stable boy's salute.\r\nThen, as he saw my guest full-face, he started. \"I saw you this morning,\r\nsir,\" he said. \"You were talking to old Mrs. Jessop, the dresser at the\r\nParthenon Theatre. It was in the 'Blue Dragon,' just round the corner by\r\nthe stage-door.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were with the stage-door keeper. A curious coincidence,\" Mr.\r\nDanjuro replied, with his weary smile, and at a look from me Thumbwood,\r\nvery puzzled indeed, left the room.\r\n\r\n\"I spent part of this morning at the Parthenon Theatre, Sir John. Your\r\nservant apparently thought of doing the same thing. A man of\r\nconsiderable acumen?--I imagined so. To proceed. Now that we have\r\ncleared away a few preliminary obstructions, we arrive at a point which\r\nI regard as of great significance. You are engaged--I speak of intimate\r\nmatters, but purely in my character of a consultant--to Miss Constance\r\nShepherd, a young lady of beauty and celebrity.\"\r\n\r\n... Confound the fellow, he spoke of Connie as if she were a fish!\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" I told him.\r\n\r\n\"That young lady was kidnapped by the unknown airman. From among all\r\nthe passengers she and her maid were singled out. Now that fact--upon\r\nwhich you must have already pondered considerably--is a key fact. Was it\r\ndone for the purpose of holding this lady up to ransom? I see the\r\nsuggestion has been made in the Press. I answer no. In the first place,\r\nit would be altogether too dangerous a game, and the attempt would\r\ncertainly lead to discovery. Secondly, there were other people on board\r\nwho would have been more profitable prey. The Duke of Perth, for\r\ninstance, or the cinema actor who receives sixty thousand pounds a year.\r\nNow it is extremely improbable that in the rush and excitement of the\r\nattack and robbery of the _Atlantis_, the pirate leader was suddenly\r\nstruck by a pretty face. Indeed, we know from accounts of the passengers\r\nthat Miss Shepherd was deliberately searched for. That indicates with\r\ncertainty that the pirate knew she was on board, and had a design of\r\ncapturing her. In its turn, this predicates a former acquaintance, and,\r\nundoubtedly, a repulse in the past. Hence my inquiries and my interview\r\nwith the theatre dresser this morning.\"\r\n\r\nI astonished that little man. It was the first and last time. Leaping up\r\nin my chair, I believe I shouted like a madman. At any rate, Thumbwood\r\nwas inside the room before I could find words to speak.\r\n\r\nSomething had flashed upon me, white-hot and sudden, as an electric\r\nadvertisement flashes out upon one at night. It was something that I had\r\nentirely and utterly forgotten until now.\r\n\r\n\"There was a man,\" I gasped, \"a scoundrel who had been annoying Miss\r\nShepherd for a long time. He wanted to marry her. She told me of it.\r\n_And he was once a celebrated flying man!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Long ago, in the Great War,\" said Danjuro calmly. \"Major Helzephron,\r\nV.C. I was aware of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And one of the boys if ever there was one, sir!\" Thumbwood broke in.\r\n\"Warned off the course everywhere. I've got a bit of information too!\"\r\n\r\nI stared at them, trembling with excitement. And then reality, like a\r\ncold douche of water, brought me to my senses. Of course, it was\r\nimpossible. The thing was a mere coincidence. Why, while the first\r\nship--the _Albatros_--had been attacked, this man, Helzephron, was in\r\nLondon! He had travelled west in the same train with me and Connie.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask exactly what you know, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n... I told Danjuro precisely what had happened at Paddington and how\r\nConnie herself had explained it.\r\n\r\nHe listened to me in attentive silence. When I had finished, I saw that\r\na small leather pocket-book had appeared in his hands--everything that\r\nthe fellow did had the uncanny effect of a clever trick--and he was\r\nturning over the leaves.\r\n\r\n\"So far,\" he began, \"in the consideration of this problem we have been\r\neliminating impossibilities, or improbabilities so strong that they\r\namount to that. This has left us with a small residuum of fact, unproved\r\nfact, but sufficient to work from. One thing emerges clearly. It is the\r\nnature and personality of our unknown friend. It is not too much to say\r\nthat he MUST be very like what we have imagined him to be. A certain\r\nperson appears dimly on the scene--this Major Helzephron. Let us see how\r\nhis personality squares with the personality we have been deducing. Mr.\r\nThumbwood has apparently collected some information. I have done so,\r\ntoo. Let us pool results!\" He looked at Charles, who blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Out with it, Charles; you've done splendidly,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir John, I found out that this gentleman is a pretty bad\r\nwrong-'un, judging by the company he keeps. And he used to annoy Miss\r\nShepherd something chronic. He'd wait at the stage-door and try and\r\nspeak to her when she got into the car after the performance, and he was\r\nalways leaving notes and flowers with the stage-door keeper. Miss\r\nShepherd would never take them. She always sent them back from her room.\r\nIt got so bad at last that she complained to the stage manager, and he\r\nhad a plain clothes man from Vine Street there one night. Major\r\nHelzephron was told off pretty plainly, I hear. He used to come very\r\nnasty sometimes, and once or twice he was fair blotto! And Mr. Meggit,\r\nthe commission agent, knows him well. He's done a lot of racing in his\r\ntime, and no open scandal. But he knows how to work the market, and the\r\nbest men won't lay him the odds no more.\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. It was only what one expected. The man was one\r\nof the fast blackguards who infest the West End of London; that was all.\r\nThere were dozens like him. The facts only seemed to prove that he could\r\nnot possibly be connected with the Atlantic outrages.\r\n\r\n\"You see?\" I said to the Japanese, sure that he would follow my thought.\r\nThen I thanked good little Charles and he left the room.\r\n\r\n\"That is the surface,\" Danjuro replied. \"I cross-examined a _woman_ who\r\nwas in constant attendance on Miss Shepherd. From her I learnt just what\r\nyour servant has discovered. But I went a little deeper. It is a case of\r\ngenuine overmastering passion on the part of this man. Nothing less. He\r\nis of a dangerous age for that to come to him, certainly over forty-five\r\nyears. A woman knows. But that is not all.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far we have learnt nothing of importance.\" I was getting restive, I\r\nwanted to be _doing_ something. And yet, what was there to do? If I had\r\nthought all night by myself I could not have mapped out the situation\r\nmore clearly. And as I looked at the little man, half lost in a big\r\nsaddlebag chair, I felt ashamed of my irritation. A brain packed in ice\r\nwas there, a logical machine of the first order. I could not expect\r\nhumanity, sympathy, from such a one. Still, it would have helped! Hadn't\r\nI lost the one thing that made life worth living? What might not be\r\nhappening to Connie even now?\r\n\r\n... He read my thoughts like a book, confound him!\r\n\r\n\"I understand your feelings, believe me, Sir John,\" he said, \"but I must\r\ngo my own way. We have not been talking for an hour yet! And if it is\r\nany consolation for you to know, let me say that it is imperative that\r\nwe leave London to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"My nerves are strained. Please go on,\" I answered. \"I can hardly tell\r\nyou what a godsend your appearance on the scene really is to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my business as agent and guard to my patron, Mr. Van Adams, it is\r\nalways necessary that I keep more or less in touch with a certain circle\r\nof what I may describe as the aristocracy, the brains of International\r\nCrime. It has proved useful. After my visit to the Parthenon this\r\nmorning I called upon an old acquaintance, the Honourable James\r\nBrookfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Slidon's son? The man who got five years ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Of course, everyone knows his name. He made one little slip. Mr.\r\nBrookfield is very acute, and a great student of character. Entirely\r\nincapable of understanding a man or woman of decent morals and normal\r\ninstincts, he is infallible in his judgment of the criminal type. Mr.\r\nBrookfield owes me any little service he can render, and I supplemented\r\nmy request for information with a note for fifty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you learnt ...?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Major Helzephron is all we have just heard, but a far more\r\nsinister and formidable person than anyone suspects. He is a man of\r\nmarked intellectual powers. Below the veneer of coarse pleasures and\r\nfast life in London and Paris, there is something that glows like a hot\r\ncoal. His appearances in town are irregular and fitful. His real life,\r\nBrookfield is certain of this, is lived far away from cities. And it is\r\n_a life with a purpose_.\"\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly and unexpectedly Mr. Danjuro began to reveal himself.\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken in a changed voice. The flatness and monotony\r\nhad vanished. The words vibrated in the room, and I felt the thrill of\r\nthem. It was the power of personality, and from then onwards I was hand\r\nin glove with this bizarre thinking machine that Fate had sent me.\r\n\r\nI tried to emulate Danjuro's dispassionate and scientific method.\r\n\r\n\"It is curious,\" I said, \"that a real intellect should care to spend\r\npart of its time in rake-helling round the low clubs, the gambling-rooms\r\nand stage-doors of London. Such a thing is known, but it is rare.\"\r\n\r\n\"You put your finger instantly upon what seems a weak spot in my\r\ncharacter sketch. But let us assume that it has been done with a deep\r\nmotive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" He knew, or suspected, something more. He referred to his\r\nnotebook.\r\n\r\n\"Two years ago a certain Mr. Herbert Gascoigne was expelled from Christ\r\nChurch College, Oxford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent down, we call it; but go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"The case was a bad one. The young man had established a sort of\r\ngambling club and ruined several of his contemporaries. It was\r\ndiscovered that he was using a roulette wheel that had been tampered\r\nwith. He came to London and drifted into the worst gang of swindlers.\r\nMajor Helzephron met him. They became very friendly. The younger man was\r\nobviously under the influence of the elder. Finally Gascoigne deserted\r\nhis old haunts and has disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nI began to see light.\r\n\r\n\"On several occasions my astute friend, Mr. Brookfield, has witnessed\r\nprecisely the same phenomenon. Some young man of the upper classes has\r\nbeen ruined socially, and our enigmatic friend has taken him up, been\r\nseen about with him, and so forth. Finally the young man vanishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not philanthropy, Mr. Danjuro.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not, and it gives rise to curious speculations. Where could a\r\nNapoleonic criminal, patiently planning and meditating a stupendous\r\ncoup, find a better recruiting ground than among the desperate and\r\nruined young men of his own class? The plan is in itself evidence of\r\ngenius. They speak his language, he understands their way of thought;\r\nthere are a thousand bonds between them. I can conceive no more solid\r\nand formidable combination than just this. The one last virtue remaining\r\nto these desperate and outcast young men will be loyalty to their\r\nleader. Society has cast them out, therefore they will make war on\r\nSociety. Given that attitude of mind, a leader like Major Helzephron,\r\nand a plan so daring, and the thing becomes plain as daylight. And if\r\nthis man had not fallen into an overmastering passion for Miss Shepherd\r\nthere would have been no means of getting on his trail at all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only with great difficulty that I could control my thoughts. We\r\nseemed miles nearer the truth than I had been an hour ago. Then one idea\r\nemerged clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. And isn't it all in our favour that we, and we alone, are in\r\na position to connect Helzephron with the piracy? He will think himself\r\nperfectly secure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not for a moment believe,\" Danjuro replied with emphasis, \"that a\r\nsingle soul besides ourselves has the least suspicion. The man will have\r\ntaken supreme care to cover his tracks. My inquiries could have\r\nsuggested nothing to the people I interviewed. Mr. Brookfield thinks I\r\nrequired my information for quite another reason. Yes, Sir John, we have\r\na task of immense difficulty and danger before us. You must recognize\r\nthat to the full. My sincere belief is that it would be somewhat safer\r\nto venture into a cage of cobras than where we have to go. But\"--he took\r\nout his watch--\"it is five o'clock. Let us say that the game begins at\r\nthis moment! Very well. We, and not the enemy, have scored the first\r\npoint!\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly glided from his chair with a single sinuous movement. As he\r\nstood up he was transformed. The bland modern look faded from his face.\r\nIt grew terrible. The eyes narrowed to slits of light, the square jaw\r\nprotruded, the grey lips were caught up in a tiger-grin, and the slim\r\nbody seemed to swell out with iron muscle like a wrestler stripped in\r\nthe arena.\r\n\r\nYou have seen some of the real old Japanese colour-prints, pictures of\r\nthe ancient Samurai or the frightful Akudogi shouting at you--yes? The\r\nflat, awful stolidity, the incarnate hate....\r\n\r\nThen you have seen something of what I saw then.\r\n\r\nWow! Millionaire Van Adams was well served!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CURIOUS FIGHT IN THE RESTAURANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a good deal to ask, Sir John,\" said Danjuro briskly, \"but, for\r\nthe moment, will you place yourself entirely in my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly content to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then permit me to press the bell.\" He did so.\r\n\r\n\"I left a black bag in the hall,\" Danjuro said politely when Thumbwood\r\ncame in. \"Would you please let me have it?\"\r\n\r\nThe bag was brought. Danjuro placed it on the table and opened it.\r\n\r\n\"You are very well known, Sir John,\" he remarked. \"Major Helzephron and\r\nhis friends have either seen you at some time or other, or have\r\ncertainly seen the numerous pictures of you that have appeared in the\r\nnewspapers during the last few days. It is imperative that you change\r\nyour appearance at once. I foresaw that and have brought materials.\"\r\n\r\nI am afraid I whistled with dismay. The idea didn't please me in the\r\nvery least. \"Is it really necessary?...\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. But it will not inconvenience you. Will you go into your\r\nbedroom and clip off your moustache with scissors, afterwards shaving\r\nthe upper lip clean? You see, the man who leaves London to-night must\r\nnot in the least resemble the Chief Commissioner of Air Police.\"\r\n\r\nI went and did it. I had to. When the operation was over I shouldn't\r\nhave known myself, it made such a difference. I never knew that I had\r\nsuch a grim and forbidding mouth!\r\n\r\nI returned to the sitting-room. Mr. Danjuro did not make the least\r\ncomment, but he removed my collar and tie with the deftness of a barber\r\nand fastened a towel round my neck. Then he sponged my skin all over\r\nwith some faintly pink stuff out of a bottle. When he had done that, he\r\nbegan on my hair with something else, and finally my eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what you are doing?\" I said after a time.\r\n\r\n\"I am dyeing your hair black, Sir John. The dye can be removed at any\r\ntime. The appearance is absolutely natural. The drug I am using is not\r\ngenerally known. I procure it from a friend in the Honcho Dori at\r\nYokohama, and also the liquid which has already changed your skin from\r\nblond to swarthy. I will treat your hands in a minute.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose I was three-quarters of an hour under his ministrations\r\nbefore he stepped back and looked at me critically. \"Part your hair in\r\nthe centre, instead of at the side, wear a low collar instead of a high\r\none, and spectacles--they can be of plain glass--and you need not have\r\nthe slightest fear of recognition. In fact, Sir John, as far as outward\r\nappearance goes, you have already ceased to exist!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a mirror over the mantel-shelf. I stood up and looked. It was\r\nmarvellous! It was uncanny, too. A dark-haired, dark-skinned stranger\r\nleered out of the glass at me, and I turned away with mingled feelings\r\nof amazement and disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Do you drive an automobile?\" the Japanese asked.\r\n\r\nI jumped at the suddenness of the question, for my thoughts were far\r\naway. \"Yes, I have a touring car of my own in a neighbouring garage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be better not to use it. We shall take one of Mr. Van Adams'\r\ncars. It is ready.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed. \"I've a lot to hear yet, you know, Mr. Danjuro, though I have\r\nplaced myself in your hands without reserve. But you made very sure of\r\nme beforehand, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Mr. Van Adams' command,\" he answered simply, and I reflected that\r\nhere, indeed, was a man with a single soul.\r\n\r\n\"We shall leave London at midnight,\" he went on, \"and drive through the\r\nwhole of the night. I, also, am an expert chauffeur, and we can relieve\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thumbwood can drive, too. Of course we take him with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be of the greatest assistance. Now, Sir John, if you want to\r\ntake a little sleep, now is the time. I should like to consult with your\r\nservant, if I may, and have a chat with him. We shall have a good deal\r\nto do with one another.\"\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, I did feel drowsy, despite my excitement. A couple of\r\nhours' sleep would refresh me wonderfully, and I knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; I think it is a good suggestion. Say for two hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means. I will carry out some other arrangements meanwhile. You\r\nshall have full explanations later on, and I thank you sincerely for the\r\nconfidence you have reposed in me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking we had left the room and crossed the hall.\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant sleep,\" he said, politely opening the door for me. \"We will\r\ngo and have a look at Major Helzephron later on.\"\r\n\r\n\"_What?_\" I shouted.\r\n\r\n\"He is in London. I have never seen him and I must certainly do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"In London?\" I cried, a dozen conflicting thoughts crowding and\r\ncrushing into my mind.\r\n\r\n\"... It is the reason that we leave London to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThen he had shut the door on me and was gone. I had known him less than\r\ntwo hours. I was a man accustomed to rule, whose whole life was spent in\r\ngiving orders, and I lay down on my bed like a lamb without a further\r\nquestion. And, what is more, I did exactly as Mr. Danjuro had said. I\r\nfell into a deep, dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nAt a little after eight Mr. Danjuro and myself sat at dinner at the\r\nRestaurant Mille Colonnes. Most people know that expensive and luxurious\r\nhome of epicures, with Nicholas, its stout and arrogant proprietor, and\r\nM. Dulac, its famous chef.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the south gallery, at the extreme end, against the wall. The\r\nelectric lights in the roof above us had been extinguished, and our\r\ntable was lighted by candles in red shades. Indeed, we sat in a sort of\r\ndarkness which must have made us almost invisible to the other diners,\r\nmost of whom sat in the longer arm of the gallery at right angles to our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWe, on the contrary, could see everything. We could look over the gilded\r\nrail into the hall of the restaurant below, and every detail of the\r\ngallery on our own level was clear and distinct, though there was such\r\na towering erection of flowers and ferns in the centre of our table that\r\nit obscured what would otherwise have been a perfect view.\r\n\r\nI wore a low, turned-down collar and a dark flannel suit. Danjuro, also,\r\nhad changed his clothes, and, in some real but indefinite way, his\r\nappearance. He wore a flannel suit and a straw hat, and also a necktie\r\nwhich I suddenly spotted as that of my old college, Christ Church,\r\nOxford. But the extraordinary thing about him was that he seemed fifteen\r\nyears younger.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to explain at the \"Mille Colonnes.\" As we began upon the\r\nsalted prawns and the stuffed olives he did so.\r\n\r\n\"You are now Mr. Johns, an Oxford tutor, Sir John. I am a young Japanese\r\ngentleman, my own name will serve, whom you are coaching. We are going\r\ninto the country with this disguise. It is one which will easily account\r\nfor your being in the company of an Asiatic gentleman, and which you\r\nwill have no difficulty in sustaining.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a simple and excellent plan for avoiding undue\r\ncuriosity. I said so, and then: \"Now perhaps you will tell me where we\r\nare going. I have my ideas....\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going west,\" he answered gravely. \"To Cornwall.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart beat fast. It was what I wanted him to say. \"To the home of\r\nHelzephron?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. For it is there we shall be in the very centre of the web. In\r\nthose far western solitudes, despite the recent opening up of the Duchy\r\nto tourists, there are still vast spaces of lonely moorland and\r\nunvisited coast where one may walk for half a day and meet no living\r\nsoul. There is a great Hinterland between the little town of St. Ives\r\nand the Land's End that for all practical purposes is unknown and\r\nunexplored. Later on, I will show you certain maps.... It is in one of\r\nthe remotest spots of all that Major Helzephron has his house. I tell\r\nyou, Sir John,\" he continued, with a sort of passion, \"that in those\r\nlost and forgotten solitudes, where England stretches out her granite\r\nfoot to spurn the Atlantic, strange secrets lie hid to-day! On those\r\ngrey and lonely moors, where the last Druids practised their mysterious\r\nrites, and which are still covered with sinister memorials of the past,\r\nlies the explanation of the terror which is troubling the world! There,\r\nand there only, shall we discover the secrets of the air, and--if human\r\nskill and determination are of any avail--Miss Constance Shepherd!\"\r\n\r\nAn obsequious waiter came with iced _consommé_. He was followed by the\r\ngreat Nicholas himself, bulging out of his buttoned frock-coat--Nicholas\r\nnever wore evening dress--who bowed low and had a whispered\r\nconfabulation with Danjuro.\r\n\r\nI remarked on this unusual honour. \"I do what I wish here,\" the\r\nJapanese replied. \"It is, of course, through Mr. Van Adams. I hold this\r\nplace in the hollow of my hand--as you will presently see!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave one of his rare and weary smiles, and then said quietly: \"Please\r\ndo not get up or move. Major Helzephron has just come into the gallery!\"\r\n\r\nI could not have moved. His words turned me to stone.\r\n\r\n\"I felt sure,\" he went on, \"that for a day or two Helzephron would show\r\nhimself in London. Knowing what we know--or at least suspect--such a\r\nmove was a certainty. He is in the habit of coming here. He booked his\r\nusual seat at this restaurant, and his usual box at the Parthenon\r\nTheatre--and for reasons obvious to you and me, if to no one else in the\r\nworld! I confess to an anxiety to look upon this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have had this corner darkened?\" I said quickly. \"No one can see\r\n_us_ here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not clearly. And Helzephron would not know who we are if he did see us.\r\nBut, as he is sure to come upon us in Cornwall, it is better to take no\r\nrisks. To that end I have had a little device arranged for us which\r\nproved of great service to me once in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nHe bent forward to the mass of ferns and flowers in the centre of the\r\ntable, disarranging the greenery at its base. At once a green-painted\r\ntube became visible, and then a slanting mirror, the size of a postcard.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is that?\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"An adaptation of the periscope!\" he replied, taking a magnifying glass\r\nfrom his pocket, adjusting it, and bending over the mirror. \"The lens is\r\nfocussed upon Helzephron's table. With this magnifier I enlarge the\r\nimage in the mirror. Ah! So that is the honourable gentleman!\"\r\n\r\nA faint hissing noise came from him. His face stiffened into fixed and\r\nhorrible intentness as he stared through his magnifier at the little\r\noblong of mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Shi-ban, Go-ban, hei!\" he muttered. \"There are two, then. I expect the\r\nyounger man is the Honourable Herbert Gascoigne, of whom we have heard!\"\r\n\r\nThe hissing noise continued, the ecstasy of attention did not relax for\r\ntwo or three minutes.\r\n\r\nAt last Danjuro looked up. His face, which had seemed carved out of\r\njade, relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"Will you take my seat?\" he said politely, handing me his reading-glass.\r\n\"A little drama will commence in a few minutes. It will interest you!\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a glance of interrogation as we exchanged chairs.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be in Cornwall to-morrow, and in advance of our friends,\" he\r\nwhispered. \"But, in order that we may carry out our preliminary\r\ninquiries quite undisturbed, I have thought out a little plan by which,\r\nif all goes well, Major Helzephron will be detained in London for a day\r\nor two--you will see.\"\r\n\r\nTrembling with eagerness I stared down at the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe periscope was perfectly focussed. The addition of the reading-glass\r\nmade everything perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nTwo men in evening clothes were seated at a table. Their heads were\r\nclose together, and they were talking earnestly. One was a tall,\r\nhandsome boy of two-and-twenty, with a fair complexion and a reckless,\r\ndissipated cast of face. Young as he was, evil experience had marked\r\nhim, and his smile was that of a much older man.\r\n\r\nBut I scarcely cast a glance on him as I stared at the coloured, moving\r\nminiature of \"Hawk Helzephron.\" The man's face was deeply tanned; above\r\nthe brows a magnificent dome of white forehead went up to a thatch of\r\ndark red hair--the forehead of a thinker if ever I saw one. The face\r\nbelow was seamed and lined everywhere. The thin nose curved out and down\r\nlike that of a bird of prey. The mouth was large, well-shaped, but\r\ncompressed, the chin a wedge of resolution. And, as he talked, I saw a\r\npair of slightly protruding eyes, cold and fierce. The whole aspect of\r\nthe man was ferocious and formidable to a degree.\r\n\r\n\"Watch!\" whispered Danjuro.\r\n\r\nI watched, and this is what I saw.\r\n\r\nInto the picture came a thick-set, brutal-looking man, with a blazing\r\ndiamond in his shirt-front. He was passing Helzephron's table when his\r\ndinner jacket caught a wine-glass and swept it to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe hawk-faced man looked up with a scowl and said something just as the\r\nportly Nicholas and a waiter appeared in the background, as if passing\r\ncasually by.\r\n\r\nThe thick-set man bent down till his face was close to Helzephron's. He\r\nsaid something also, with an unpleasant smile.\r\n\r\nInstantly Helzephron leapt up and drove his fist full into the other's\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe fight that followed ended very speedily. The thick-set man took the\r\nblow calmly. Then, without heat, and in a fashion which instantly told\r\nme the truth of the matter, he set about Helzephron, hitting him where\r\nand when he chose, until a shouting crowd of guests and waiters\r\nseparated the combatants and a policeman and commissionaire hurried them\r\naway from the gallery.\r\n\r\nDuring all the tumult Mr. Danjuro sat quietly smoking a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"That was Mr. Wag Ashton, the pugilist,\" he remarked. \"Honourable\r\nNicholas and the waiter saw that the honourable Helzephron struck him\r\nfirst. I think the Major will be resting for a day or two before Mr.\r\nAshton summonses him for assault.\"\r\n\r\nI felt faint with surprise and amazement.\r\n\r\n\"So you, you arranged ...\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me. \"Now let us finish our dinner in peace,\" he said.\r\n\"Some river trout, _meunier_, are coming.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards, with myself at the wheel, a huge sixty horse-power\r\nlimousine, loaded with luggage and with Messrs. Danjuro and Thumbwood\r\ninside, was rolling down the Piccadilly slope.\r\n\r\nTo Penzance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HUNTING INSTINCT IS STIMULATED BY A PROCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big car rolled down Piccadilly. She was a beauty to handle, as I\r\ndiscovered in the first two minutes. The very latest type of electric\r\nstarter, a magnificent lighting installation--every convenience was\r\nready to my hand. I was in an extraordinary state of mind as I steered\r\nthe car through the late theatre and restaurant traffic, purely\r\nmechanically and without conscious thought about it.\r\n\r\nThe predominant sensation was one of immense overwhelming relief at the\r\nprospect of _action_. Mere office activities, the planning of guard and\r\npatrol ships, conferences with pilots and officials, had been quite\r\npowerless to calm the terrible fever of unrest within me. It was\r\ncommanding other people to do things, not doing them myself. I knew all\r\nthe time that I should have been happier piloting one of the war-planes\r\nover the Atlantic. Now, at any rate, I was doing something real. I was\r\nactually setting out, in my own person, upon a definite quest. It might\r\nbe all moonshine. I was well aware that many hard-headed people would\r\nhave laughed at this expedition, considering the slender evidence I had.\r\nThey would have talked about \"circumstantial evidence,\" the folly of\r\npure assumption, and so forth. \"Behold this dreamer cometh!\" would have\r\nbeen their attitude.\r\n\r\nAnd although I was driving the big car up Park Lane for Oxford Street\r\nand the road to the West, I did feel as if I were in a dream. My whole\r\nlife had been altered by the events of the past few days, ruined for\r\never it might be. To-night its stream was violently diverted from its\r\ncourse. Everything with which I was familiar had flashed away, and I was\r\non the brink of the fantastic and unknown. There was not a man in London\r\nsetting out upon so strange an errand, under circumstances so\r\nunprecedented, as I was this night. We slid by a huge white house, set\r\nback from the railings, and with all its windows looking out over the\r\nPark. It was the London palace that Mr. Van Adams had built for himself\r\nduring the last five years, and the strangeness of my affair was\r\nintensified at the sight.\r\n\r\nOnly a few hours ago the great man had been sitting in my chambers, and\r\nintroducing the enigmatic figure that sat behind me in the car. Here\r\nwas a dream figure indeed! It was impossible to think of Danjuro as a\r\nhuman being. He was just a brain, a specialized force, devoted to one\r\nobject, and probably, as Van Adams had hinted, the supreme force of its\r\nkind in existence. Already I had placed myself in his hands, and not\r\nonly my personal interests, dear as those were to me, but my\r\nresponsibilities to the State as well, and that was no small thing for\r\nhim to have achieved in so short a space of time. The unique detachment\r\nand concentration that was sitting behind me had an almost magical\r\neffect upon one's mind and will. With such help, surely, I could not\r\nfail?\r\n\r\nI fell to thinking of what the Japanese had already achieved, the quiet\r\nand masterly skill of his analysis, the cold audacity of his plot to\r\nkeep Helzephron in London, the neatness and finish of his operations as\r\nwitnessed by the periscope upon the dinner-table at the \"Mille\r\nColonnes.\" Surely, Helzephron, or whoever was the master-criminal, was a\r\ndoomed man with Danjuro on his track?\r\n\r\nWe were running out of Ealing now, and traffic was almost gone in the\r\nlong, straight westward road among the acres of market gardens and\r\nglass-houses that fringe the western approach to the metropolis. I let\r\nout the powerful engines, and as the car leapt like a spurred horse, my\r\nheart leapt up into anger at the name Helzephron.\r\n\r\nConnie--poor, lost Connie--had told me herself how the man had pestered\r\nher, and I had seen him at Paddington with my own eyes. The\r\ninvestigations at the Parthenon Theatre by Thumbwood and Danjuro had put\r\nthe details in the picture, and an ugly one it was. The man, V.C. as he\r\nwas, had a bad reputation enough. I had watched him that very evening,\r\nmarked every line upon the hawk-like, cruel face, and thrilled when the\r\nvulgar pugilist attacked him. It was the next best thing to thrashing\r\nhim myself! Yet--I record this as an interesting point of my psychology\r\nat the beginning of the enterprise--I was disgusted with and loathed the\r\nman only. I did not hate him, for I found it, even now, impossible to\r\nbelieve that he was the abductor of my girl.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me if you can. Danjuro had convinced my intellect, but not my\r\nheart. My state was the reverse of the ordinary state in such a\r\nsituation. Plenty of people believe in anything--a religion for\r\nexample--by faith, and cannot justify their faith intellectually. Their\r\nbelief is always confident and strong. I believed intellectually, but\r\nhad no faith, which was why this quest seemed shadow-like and a thing in\r\na dream. No doubt, the long night drive and my curious companion--I was\r\nalways conscious of him--intensified the impression of unreality.\r\n\r\nAbout three in the morning Danjuro spoke through the tube and insisted\r\non relieving me. I stopped the huge car in a dark, tree-bordered road,\r\nwhere the moonlight lay in pools and patches of silver, and exchanged\r\nseats with the little man. As I stood on the road and stamped with my\r\nfeet to restore the circulation, the night-breeze rustled in the leaves,\r\nand far away I heard the nightjar spinning. Never was such a still and\r\nsolitary place. Danjuro's face in the moonlight seemed as immobile and\r\nlifeless as one of those Japanese masks of wax with eyes of opalescent\r\nglass that you can buy in the Oriental shops.\r\n\r\nI got inside and, suddenly weary, sank back in the luxuriously cushioned\r\nseat. The car started again, and Thumbwood switched on a light in the\r\nroof. He produced a Thermos flask of hot soup, which I found delicious\r\nand refreshing.\r\n\r\n\"How have you been getting on with Mr. Danjuro?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, thank you, Sir John. He knows everything, I do believe. If\r\nthere's one thing where I should detect a man who was talking through\r\n'is 'at, it's 'osses. Stands to reason. But this gentleman knows 'osses\r\nlike a blooming trainer, sir. And as for the games of the crooks in the\r\nring and on the course, he's wide to every one of 'em. I generally\r\ncarries a pack of cards in my pocket, sir, and I've got one with me now.\r\nThe things 'e showed me passes belief. I've seen a good deal of that\r\nsort of work, but Mr. Danjuro's an easy winner. I wouldn't play poker\r\nwith 'im, no, nor 'alfpenny nap, for a fistful o' thick 'uns!\"\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at Exeter, and I had the opportunity of a shave and a\r\nbath. I remember that when I was half-way up the hotel stairs a horrid\r\nthought struck me, and I hurried down again to consult Danjuro.\r\n\r\nHow would the stuff he had put on my skin stand hot water and soap?\r\n\r\nHe reassured me, however. Nothing would remove the beastly stuff but a\r\npreparation he carried with him, and I bathed in peace.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning when we started again, and for many miles our\r\nroute lay close to the smiling Devon sea. The waves were sapphire blue,\r\nframed in the red sandstone rocks, and the sky resembled a great hollow\r\nturquoise. It was a bright morning, and one side of me rejoiced in it;\r\nbut the thought of my girl was always there, a constant sullen pain, for\r\nwhich the morning held no anodyne.\r\n\r\nThumbwood drove on this stretch of the journey, and Danjuro sat inside\r\nstudying innumerable maps, and now and then making notes in a\r\npocket-book. I wondered what thoughts were seething and bubbling behind\r\nthat massive dome of skull.\r\n\r\nApart from the scenery, there was plenty to interest a Commissioner of\r\nAir Police. The sky was speckled with small private planes, converging\r\nupon Plymouth or Exeter from many a pleasant country residence. There\r\nwas no longer any need for the professional man or the prosperous\r\ntradesman to live within a very few miles of his place of business. Men\r\nflew to their day's work, and from considerable distances, and as a\r\nmatter of course. A mile or two out at sea one distinguished the large\r\nsteady-going passenger airships by which England was now ringed, and\r\noccasionally the Royal Mail boats cut the sky like javelins. More than\r\nonce I spotted one of my police patrols. It was curious to remember that\r\nI, who sat here with a stained face and shaven lip, bowling along the\r\nDevon roads at a miserable forty miles an hour, had supreme control of\r\nall those aerial argosies.\r\n\r\nThere were few cars upon the roads at this early hour. Contrary to\r\ngeneral opinion fifteen years ago, the popularity of flying had by no\r\nmeans killed the automobile. It had lessened their numbers in an\r\nappreciable degree, and made the roads more pleasant. I should, of\r\ncourse, have preferred to reach our destination, or, at any rate, to\r\nhave travelled the greater part of the way towards it by airship. The\r\nsystem of registration and the police regulations--framed by\r\nmyself--would have given too much away. My actual identity and purpose\r\nmight not have been discovered, but we should have been easily traced,\r\nand Helzephron--if he was what we suspected--would be the first to hear\r\nof a private aeroplane making its appearance in the solitudes where he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nTowards midday we were approaching Plymouth, when I began to feel\r\nuneasy. The agony I had endured there a day or two ago, when Thumbwood\r\nburst into my bedroom with news of the _Atlantis_ disaster, clouded my\r\nmemory. I felt that I never wished to see the pride of Devon again.\r\nThis, though, was merely weakness which I crushed down. More practical\r\nconsiderations occurred to me. I made Charles stop the car and got\r\ninside with Danjuro.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" I said, \"hadn't we better run straight through the town and\r\nget on into Cornwall? We can lunch at St. Germans or somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have some special reason for avoiding Plymouth, Sir John?\" Danjuro\r\nasked politely.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's the air-port for America. One of my largest stations is\r\nthere. Dozens and dozens of people know me. I've always been a familiar\r\nfigure in Plymouth, and never more so than lately, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese gave his little weary smile. \"I do not think you realize\r\nthe alteration in your appearance,\" he said. \"I assure you, and I am an\r\nexpert in these matters, that no one at all would ever recognize you. I\r\nhad proposed to stop in Plymouth for at least a couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"For several reasons. One is that I shall be able to purchase some local\r\nCornish maps and a directory or two, which I need, and found no\r\nopportunity of procuring in London. But that is not all. Here we are in\r\nthe very centre of air matters, as far as the Atlantic is concerned. The\r\nplace is still seething with excitement. Nothing else but the piracies\r\nis spoken of. The town is packed with correspondents of the principal\r\nEuropean newspapers. It is in a ferment. I much wish to go about with my\r\nears open for an hour or two. I do think, Sir John, that it would be\r\nunwise to neglect this opportunity, for you as well as myself. There is\r\nno knowing what we may pick up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're certain about my disguise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly certain. You will not, of course, enter into long\r\nconversations with anyone who knows you well, as your voice would betray\r\nyou. Otherwise you may rest secure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the weak point,\" I replied. \"I've always heard that,\r\nhowever perfectly a man may be disguised, you cannot disguise his\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled a cigarette with the quick snatching movement of his fingers\r\nthat always struck me as a miracle of dexterity.\r\n\r\n\"It is not true,\" he remarked. \"I have invented five methods, three\r\nmechanical and two medical or chemical, whichever you like to call\r\nthem. When we have leisure I will show you. But there is no need for\r\nanything of the sort in your case. It will give you confidence, Sir\r\nJohn, to test the completeness of your new appearance. If you will go to\r\nthe Royal Hotel and lunch there--keeping awake to hear the general\r\ntalk--I will join you about three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I replied, though with some reluctance, \"and the car?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thumbwood has been with you at the 'Royal,' and he is not\r\ndisguised. It would be better that he should not approach the hotel. We\r\nwill put you down a short distance away. I will remain in the car and\r\ndirect Thumbwood where to go.\"\r\n\r\nNothing escaped this little man! He seemed to foresee and provide for\r\neverything, and when I alighted five minutes afterwards, some two\r\nhundred yards from the hotel, I felt fairly secure in my new character\r\nas Mr. Johns, the don of Christ Church, Oxford.\r\n\r\nImmediately I was in the street I became aware--you know how one\r\ndoes?--that the Japanese was right, and Plymouth was in a ferment.\r\nLondon is too vast for anything but a national calamity to make any\r\nalteration in the outward appearance of things, and even then it takes a\r\nsharp eye and a man well versed in the psychology of crowds to detect\r\nanything unusual. Not so a big provincial town.\r\n\r\nAs I walked along the classic façade of the theatre and turned the\r\ncorner to the main entrance of the hotel, I saw one thought on every\r\nface and heard one single topic of discussion. The streets, always so\r\ngay and cheerful with military and naval uniforms, seemed more crowded\r\nthan their wont, and there was a definite electricity in the air. I know\r\nthat I felt stimulated, encouraged to persist, and as I ascended the\r\nmassive steps of the hotel, my clean-shaven lips smiled to think with\r\nwhat interest I should be regarded if anyone had but an inkling of whom\r\nI was and upon what mission.\r\n\r\nAnd then I had a shock.\r\n\r\nStanding in the big lounge-hall, and talking to a man in a black\r\nmorning-coat and a silk hat, was my second in command--Muir Lockhart,\r\nAssistant Commissioner of Air Police! He was in uniform, a special\r\nuniform that we both wore upon ceremonial occasions only.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he was saying, \"I'm down here representing the Chief.\"\r\n\r\nI dared not stay to listen, but I walked towards them as slowly as I\r\ncould. Muir Lockhart has a somewhat high, penetrating voice.\r\n\r\n\"When did you come down?\" asked the other man.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived half an hour ago, flew down from Whitehall this morning,\" said\r\nMuir Lockhart.\r\n\r\n\"Then Sir John Custance isn't coming?\"\r\n\r\nMy assistant shook his head. \"Utterly impossible,\" he said. \"Sir John\r\ncannot leave town just now. He must be at the head of things; can't\r\npossibly be spared. I saw him this morning before I left; he had been\r\nworking all night and was nearly dead. 'Explain my position to them,' he\r\nsaid; 'nothing but strict duty would keep me away from Plymouth to-day.'\r\nSo, you see how it is, Mr. Mayor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite, quite! Well, I must be getting round to the Guildhall. You\r\nwill march up your men at half-past one? Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in the silk hat, who I realized must be the Mayor of Plymouth,\r\nhurried away. I was left face to face with Muir Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHe stared at me, not offensively, but in such a way that he could not\r\nhave missed a detail of my appearance; he always was an observant\r\nbeggar. Then he passed by without a sign of recognition. Good! I\r\nreflected, if my own colleague, who saw me for several hours each day,\r\ndid not know me, no one else would. It seemed a good omen, and I blessed\r\nDanjuro in my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd what a splendid liar Muir Lockhart was! He knew that I had gone away\r\non my own, and he hadn't the least idea in the world where I was! It\r\nwas a temptation to discover myself, but I refrained.\r\n\r\nI was very puzzled. What on earth was he doing here in uniform, and\r\ntalking to the Mayor about? I hadn't a suspicion of the truth even then,\r\nand I had a curious sense of being out of things, forgotten and on the\r\nscrap-heap! The long drive had made me hungry and I thought about lunch.\r\nBefore going into the coffee-room I wished to remove the stains of\r\ntravel, so I went down the corridor to the lavatory.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered a man in his shirt-sleeves was bending over one of the\r\nbasins and sluicing himself with many splashes. As I was washing my own\r\nswarthy hands he emerged from a towel and gave me a casual glance.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Van Adams!\r\n\r\nI could not repress a violent start, the thing was so sudden. What did\r\nthis gathering of the clans mean? He noticed my movement at once, and\r\nlooked at me with inquiry in his eyes. The lavatory was quite empty save\r\nfor our two selves, and my decision was taken at once.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Van Adams?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" he replied. \"You have the floor--shoot!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from the great Lum-tum, though your voice is kind of homey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Sir John Custance. Danjuro's been faking me up. He's down here\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" said Mr. Van Adams. \"Aren't you the fresh thing now, Sir John? So\r\nyou're down for the obsequies incog.? That's what I've come for--matter\r\nof respect. Flew down from Park Lane after breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on my way west. We only stopped here for an hour or two, as Danjuro\r\nhad some business.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've ordered lunch in a private room overlooking the square. Come right\r\nup, Sir John, you'll be able to see everything from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. But I'm still in the dark. I'm right away from the office\r\nnow, as you know. I saw Commander Muir Lockhart here just now, but I\r\ncouldn't speak to him....\"\r\n\r\nHe took me by the arm and led me along the corridor to the lift.\r\n\"Captain Lashmar, of your force and the five men of the patrol boat are\r\nbeing buried to-day,\" he said; \"also Captain Swainson, of the\r\n_Atlantis_, and the boys murdered on _his_ ship.\"\r\n\r\nI flushed under my dye. I had never heard a word of it. I felt an\r\nabsolute beast as we entered the private room, and I tried to explain to\r\nthe millionaire.\r\n\r\n\"Think you callous and unfeeling?\" he said in answer. \"Guess I know\r\nbetter than that, my friend. You're out to prevent just such a\r\nspectacle as we're going to witness from ever happening again. You're\r\nplaying a better game than prancing along at the head of a procession.\r\nYou're getting busy at the heart of things. Now sit down and share the\r\npork bosom and beans, or whatever they've given us. And tell me all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat down to lunch, and after a glass of Burgundy, I told Van Adams of\r\nall that had occurred, and also expressed my complete confidence in\r\nDanjuro.\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"There isn't an investigator on the globe\r\nthat'd carry a tune to him. He has his orders to stick to you right\r\nthrough and he'll carry them out. That little man's got a brain like the\r\nMammoth Cave, and he's without human passions, save only one--he'd go to\r\nhell in a paper suit for me! See here----\" and the millionaire told me a\r\nstring of anecdotes about the uncanny little Jap that would make the\r\nfortunes of a writer of Romance.\r\n\r\nHe was still on the same subject when he stopped in the middle of a\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe noise in the square outside was suddenly hushed, and we heard a\r\nmuffled chord of music. Rising from our chairs we went to the windows.\r\nEverywhere, as far as eye could reach, was a black sea of heads, from\r\namong which the slender clocktower on its island in the centre rose\r\nlike a sentinel.\r\n\r\nThe pavements were lined by troops, soldiers and sailors in equal\r\nproportions, and there was a flutter as of falling leaves as every head\r\nwas bared and the piercing sweetness of Chopin's \"Funeral March\" filled\r\nall the air.\r\n\r\nThen they came, following the band: thirteen coffins covered with\r\nflowers, thirteen brave heroes, who would never slant down the long\r\nreaches of the upper air again.\r\n\r\nAfter the hearses walked Paget and Fowles, the two heroic airmen who had\r\ncalled the rescuing ship by wireless, and then came the chaplains and\r\nMuir Lockhart.\r\n\r\nFor my part I saw the whole procession in a dream. The head of the\r\nTransatlantic Air Line, the Mayor and Corporation in their robes--the\r\nstately funereal pomp of it all seemed unsubstantial and unreal.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Adams was kneeling a yard or two away from the window. His head\r\nwas bent, he had a crucifix and a string of golden beads in his hands,\r\nand was saying prayers. Who would have thought it of this master of\r\nmillions with the pike-like jaw? I suppose he was a Catholic.\r\n\r\nBut my mind was far away, above the heaving wastes of the Atlantic, and\r\nI saw an unnamed, unknown ship rushing through the air, at a speed\r\nundreamed of hitherto in the history of flight. And in the pilot's seat\r\nI had a vision of a hawk-faced man with cruel eyes and a smile upon his\r\nhard, thin lips....\r\n\r\nI stood there for so long that the very tail of the procession was\r\npassing by, and Mr. Van Adams rose from his prayers with the sign of the\r\nCross, and touched me on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he said, pointing down into the street.\r\n\r\nI followed his finger and saw Danjuro standing on the opposite kerb. He\r\nwas looking after the cortège, and his face, with the expression on it,\r\nwas quite clear to see....\r\n\r\nIn an instant I came out of my dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE WICKED FACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning after our arrival I stepped out of my bedroom window at\r\nPenzance and stood upon the balcony.\r\n\r\nMany times had I flown over Cornwall; never had I set foot in the Duchy\r\nuntil now. Plymouth had always been my furthest west.\r\n\r\nThe sea was blue as the Mediterranean, the sky a huge hollow turquoise,\r\nthe air all Arabia. Away in the bay St. Michael's Mount, crowned with\r\ntowers, gleamed like a vision of the New Jerusalem in some old monkish\r\nmissal--and the heart within me was so hard, stern, and full of deadly\r\npurpose that no summer seas nor balmy western winds could touch the\r\nrigour of my mood.\r\n\r\nFor we were on the battlefield now. There was no more vagueness nor\r\nspeculation. I, in the place I occupied, owed a debt to society, and to\r\nmyself a personal and bitter revenge. And those debts should be paid.\r\n\r\nDanjuro knocked and entered the bedroom. Yesterday afternoon, within\r\nhalf an hour of our arrival at Penzance, he had disappeared, telling me\r\nnot to wait up for him, as he could not say what time he would return. I\r\naccordingly went to bed early, for I was tired out, and had not seen him\r\nuntil now.\r\n\r\n\"I have been very busy, Sir John,\" he said. \"In the characters of a\r\nmining engineer at one place and agent for a foreign shipping firm at\r\nanother, I have been making some very necessary inquiries. I engaged a\r\nlocal motor--our own would hardly have suited the part--and I have\r\ncovered a great deal of country.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your exact object?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have two. One is to discover any private engineering works where\r\nspecial engines could have been made in secret. You will remember that\r\nwe both came to the conclusion that the Air Pirate could have obtained\r\nsilent engines in no other way. The other is--petrol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Petrol! I never thought of that! I see what you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, Sir John. An airship such as the one we are after must have\r\na constant supply of petrol, and, of course, consumes enormous\r\nquantities. When I can connect a certain private individual with the\r\nreceipt of such quantities, we are another step forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"How have you got on?\" I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing definite. But there are certain indications--slight,\r\noh, very slight!--which I am following up. I will go into everything\r\nwith you this evening. Meanwhile you have your own day mapped out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I have studied the local maps and asked a good many questions.\r\nAfter breakfast I shall walk over the moors to this little lonely\r\nvillage of Zerran. It is about eight miles away from here, and, I\r\nunderstand, not more than one and a half from Tregeraint Sea House,\r\nwhich is the home of Major Helzephron. There is a fair-sized\r\nold-fashioned inn on the cliffs where we shall probably be able to get\r\nrooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"And settle down to our reading party,\" he replied, with a sudden gleam\r\nin his narrow eyes. \"I have the Greek texts of Plato's 'Republic' and\r\nthe 'Meno' in my portmanteau; it is wise to pay attention to details! We\r\nshall, then, meet at dinner this evening, and I expect that your news\r\nwill be of great importance. With your permission, I shall take\r\nhonourable Thumbwood with me. He will be useful.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, with some sandwiches and a flask, I set out, passing\r\ndown the main street of the far western town, and by the last station in\r\nEngland, till I found myself mounting a winding road which led upwards\r\nthrough a suburb towards the moorlands.\r\n\r\nThe air was heavy with the perfume of innumerable flowers. Tall\r\npalm-trees grew in the gardens of old granite houses, a sub-tropical\r\nflora flourished everywhere, and it was difficult to believe that one\r\nwas in England. The hedges were luxuriant with ferns that grow in\r\nhot-houses elsewhere, Royal Osmunda and Maidenhair, and every moment the\r\nroad grew steeper.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the map of Cornwall you will see that the extremity of\r\nthe county forms a sort of peninsula. Penzance is on the south, and\r\nfaces the English Channel on the south. My back was now turned to this,\r\nand I was walking due north, towards my objective, the vast and little\r\nknown \"Hinterland\" of mountainous moor and savage coast which lies\r\nbetween the Channel and the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAs I went, the warmth and colour, the riot of Nature all round, seemed\r\nas unreal as a dream. It brought no ease or healing to my soul. Deep,\r\ndeep down, though controlled and prisoned by the will, an unending agony\r\nwas lying. I'm not going to insist upon this, or often obtrude it in my\r\nstory. But you must not think that, until the very end, I knew a\r\nmoment's peace. My dear love and her awful fate were ever before me, and\r\nall the sights and sounds of Nature in this western paradise breathed\r\nnothing but her name.\r\n\r\n... At last the habitations of man grew fewer. Gardens gave place to\r\nsloping fields enclosed by \"hedges\" of stone, and at length a long,\r\nlevel sky-line above and in front showed me that the moors were close.\r\n\r\nI reached the top at last, and took in a great breath of the sweetest,\r\nmost exhilarating air that I have ever known. The unfenced road\r\nstretched away ahead of me for miles, a long, white ribbon laid upon the\r\nheath and yellow gorse. I was on a vast plateau of gold and brown and\r\npurple. To the left great hills crowned with rock granite tors cut into\r\nthe sky, and to the right was the jagged summit of Carne Zerran, three\r\nmiles away as the crow flies. At its foot, on the edge of mighty cliffs\r\nthat fell away a sheer three hundred feet to the ocean, I knew lay the\r\nlittle village that I sought.\r\n\r\nI looked at my map for a moment, took out my pocket compass, and then\r\nplunged into the heather. Already I had a good idea of the lie of the\r\ncountry--it is an instinct with your flying man--and I realized that an\r\naccurate knowledge of it would prove invaluable in the task before me.\r\n\r\nI met no living soul during that first walk over the moor. Larks were\r\nsinging high above in the blue; a pair of the rare Cornish choughs, with\r\ntheir scarlet bills, flew screeching from the summit of a lichen-covered\r\nrock as big as a house; but until I got to Carne Zerran, and looked down\r\nto the narrow strip of pasture lands and cornfields that lie along the\r\ncliffs, there was no sign of human habitation.\r\n\r\nFar down below I saw a church tower and a little cluster of grey houses.\r\nBeyond was the coast-line, with a creamy froth of breakers at the foot\r\nof the jagged cliffs, and the Atlantic, \"Mother of Oceans,\" beyond.\r\nThere was no land between me and New York! I suppose that in all the\r\nglory of sun and colour, superb spaces of sea and sky, I stood alone,\r\nand looked upon a scene as fair as any on this earth. But as I focussed\r\nmy binoculars, and swept the coast, my only thought was that here--if\r\nanywhere at all--was the heart of the mystery I had come to solve.\r\n\r\nWell! It was a fitting setting, in its lonely vastness. Anything might\r\nhappen here among these Druid-haunted hills. A crafty fiend, a man with\r\na great intellect and Satan in his soul, might well find this his proper\r\ntheatre!\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from the village, and just below me, I saw the cliffs bent\r\ninwards between two projecting headlands. This must be the Zerran Cove\r\nof the map, and--yes, seemingly upon the very edge of the precipice was\r\na long, grey building, which could be none other than \"The Miners'\r\nArms.\"\r\n\r\nI began the descent, leaping from rock to rock, where the adders lay\r\nbasking in the sun. After a few hundred yards, I struck a gorge,\r\nthrough which a stream fell towards the sea. Here I found a well-defined\r\npath, which looped downwards to the ruins of a deserted tin-mine. I saw,\r\nas I passed it, the windowless engine-house, and the gaunt timbers of\r\nthe winding gear still in place. The gibbet-like erection and the dumps\r\nof useless stuff covered with rank dock leaves made a forlorn and ugly\r\npicture in that narrow gorge where the sun hardly penetrated.\r\n\r\nI passed it soon, and came out upon the main coach road from St. Ives to\r\nLand's End, and, crossing this, found a side lane, which took me direct\r\nto the remote hostelry I had seen from the heights above.\r\n\r\nIt was a large place, covered with ivy, and no doubt did a considerable\r\ntrade eighty years before, when the innumerable tin-mines on the moor\r\nwere all at work. Now it seemed forgotten by the world, and all asleep\r\nin the sun. \"An ideal base for our operations!\" I thought, as I strode\r\nthrough an open door into a long, low room, with a stone floor and\r\nheavily timbered roof.\r\n\r\nIt was cool, and so dark after the blazing sunshine that, for a moment,\r\nI could see nothing, though I heard a sound of stertorous breathing.\r\nWhen my eyes became accustomed to the gloom I saw that there was a man\r\nasleep by the little counter. He sat on a bench which ran along the\r\nwall, and his head was buried in his arms, which rested on a\r\nbeer-stained table. By his side stood a bottle half full of whisky.\r\n\r\nSupposing him to be the landlord--and no engaging figure at that--I\r\ntouched him on the shoulder. It was like springing a trap! Instantly he\r\nsnatched away his arms and sat up. For a second sleep held him. Then it\r\npassed away like a breath on glass, and if ever I saw fear on a man's\r\nface I saw it then.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a blue jersey and an alpaca coat, oil-stained and\r\ndirty. His hands were the hands of a mechanic, with grimy nails. But it\r\nwas his face that held me. It was sleek and cunning. There was a curious\r\nmixture of refinement and wickedness. He seemed like a naturally\r\nsensitive man, whom circumstances, indulgence, or some special\r\ntemptation, had led very deeply astray.\r\n\r\nI noted all this while he stared at me with a drooping jaw and bloodshot\r\neyes. His skin had turned dead-white, like the belly of a fish, and\r\nwhatever he was thinking I felt that I would not have that man's\r\nconscience for a million.\r\n\r\n\"I want you,\" I said--they were the first words that came.\r\n\r\nHe made an inarticulate noise.\r\n\r\n\"You are the landlord, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nAt that he gave a long breath and his rigidity relaxed. He snatched at\r\nthe whisky bottle, poured some into a glass and drank it off neat.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, how you startled me!\" he said glibly. \"I was far\r\naway--dreaming--and you frightened me out of my life!\"\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to be amazed, though I showed nothing. The fellow spoke\r\nwith a cultivated voice and accent which were impossible to mistake. He\r\nwas not what I had thought him.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" I said; \"you must please excuse me. But I naturally\r\nthought ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you did!\" he said, and a civil but ugly smile came on his\r\nclever, unpleasant face. \"As a matter of fact, Trewhella, the landlord,\r\nhas just gone to the village for a few minutes. He asked me to keep\r\nhouse for him. He's almost due back now.\"\r\n\r\nThanking him urbanely, I sat down, my mind working very quickly. He\r\noffered me some whisky, and though it was the last thing I wanted, I\r\naccepted after a show of reluctance. He was watching me out of the\r\ncorners of his eyes the whole time.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me,\" I said, with great openness of manner, \"if I can get\r\nrooms here, or in Zerran village?\"\r\n\r\nHe became alert at once. \"Rooms, to stay in, do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I am an Oxford tutor, and I have a young foreign gentleman in my\r\ncharge whom I am coaching. I want a quiet place for three or four weeks,\r\nand this seems ideal for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHis face cleared. \"I should imagine so,\" he replied. \"I know Trewhella\r\ndoes let sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You live here?\" I remarked, with polite indifference.\r\n\r\n\"I have been here for a year,\" he answered. \"I am, as a matter of fact,\r\na mining engineer--hence these clothes! I belong to a little private\r\nsyndicate of friends who are opening up a disused tin-mine, on the moor\r\nnot far away. Ah, here is the landlord! Trewhella, this gentleman wishes\r\nto speak to you.\" And then to me: \"Good-morning, sir. No doubt, if you\r\ncome here, I and my friends will see something of you. We are mostly\r\npublic-school and University men ourselves, and we often look in here of\r\nan evening after our day's work.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand and went out into the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN CUSTANCE COMES UPON THE HOUSE OF HELZEPHRON\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Trewhella was an elderly Cornishman, with welcoming manners, the\r\nnative shrewdness of his race, but without guile. We got on famously\r\nfrom the word \"go.\" He had three bedrooms and a large sitting-room to\r\nlet. His wife, who had driven into St. Ives, was, he asserted, a good\r\ncook. As for Thumbwood, he could wait on us and live with the landlord\r\nand his wife. Finally, there was an empty barn which would hold our car\r\nvery comfortably.\r\n\r\n\"And what would you be thinking of paying, zur?\" asked Mr. Trewhella.\r\n\r\n\"I shall leave that to you. I may tell you that the gentleman I am\r\npreparing for his Oxford examination is wealthy. He is a Japanese\r\nnobleman, and as long as you make us comfortable ...\"\r\n\r\nThis had the desired effect. The landlord became expansive in his slow\r\nway, and showed me all over the premises of his quaint and rambling\r\ndwelling. It was a wild and fantastic spot, an ancient haunt of\r\nsmugglers and wreckers, I learnt. The back-yard opened straight into the\r\nshort pneumatic turf above the cliffs, the brink of which was not more\r\nthan two hundred yards away. Here the stream, which flowed past the inn,\r\ndescended in a series of miniature cataracts to a tiny cove of\r\ndeep-green water, almost enclosed by two towering precipices, crowned\r\nwith jagged spires and pinnacles of rock. There was a little scimitar of\r\ngolden sand far down at the water's edge, and the scene was one of\r\nsavage grandeur that I have rarely known surpassed in all my travels.\r\n\r\nAs he stood on the height and looked down, I saw something which seemed\r\nstrangely out of place. A line of street rails, with wooden rollers at\r\nintervals between them, fell at a dizzy angle from a spot some ten yards\r\naway on the turf, ending abruptly on the level, and in front of a\r\nsmallish hut of corrugated iron.\r\n\r\n\"What is the rail for?\" I asked. \"Surely you don't haul the\r\nboats\"--there were two of them lying on the beach--\"right up to the top\r\nof the cliff! It must be two hundred and fifty feet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nigher three hundred, zur. No. Them rails belong to bring up machinery\r\nand stores for Tregeraint Mine by Carne Zerran. They do come by sea in a\r\nlil' steamboat. 'Tes more convenient so. There be a lil' oil engine in\r\nthat shed to haul 'em up in trucks. I let the land, for 'tes all mine\r\ndown-along, and they do pay me ten pound a year.\"\r\n\r\nWe strolled back to the house, Mr. Trewhella proposing a Cornish pasty\r\nand beer for lunch.\r\n\r\n\"Now you mention it, that gentleman who was keeping house for you just\r\nnow said that he was a mining engineer.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord's big, weather-beaten face wrinkled like a stained window.\r\nHe began to heave and chuckle, finally exploding in a bellow of\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Vargus!\" he spluttered, \"Mr. Vargus! He _thinks_ he be a mining\r\nengineer, but a knows no more about it than my pig! He be a clever\r\ngentleman, sure 'nuf. He do have some braäve knowledge to machinery,\r\nI'll allow. But mining, and tin-mining!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trewhella could find no further words to express his contempt for\r\nthe mining attainments of my friend with the refined and evil face.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" the landlord continued, as we ate our pasties, \"I'm an old\r\nmine-captain myself, bred and born to it. 'Tedn't likely as I could be\r\ndeceived. When I heered that a gentleman had come into Tregeraint Manor\r\nand the old mine, and proposed to work it, I laughed, I did. I know\r\nevery inch of Wheal Tregeraint, and fifty years ago it was a fine\r\nproperty. To-day them amatoors up along'll never get enough tin out to\r\noxidize, let alone smelt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they, then, Mr. Trewhella?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what lots of folk asked when they first come here in twos and\r\nthrees. They're gentlemen, zur, like yourself, that's what they are.\r\nNever was such a thing known in these parts, though folk are used to 'em\r\nnow. There's Mr. Helzephron, a Cornishman himself, and should know\r\nbetter, Mr. Vargus, you seed, Mr. Gascoigne, a mad young devil if you\r\nlike, and near a dozen more. They all live together in the greät house\r\non the cliff and work the mine theyselves. Never no one else allowed.\r\nThey cooks and does for themselves, just as if they was in a mining camp\r\nin California.\"\r\n\r\n\"No women, servants or anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never an apron. My missus belong to say they lives like Popish monks,\r\nwhich she see when travelling with a lady among the Eyetalians. 'Not so,\r\nmy tender dear,' says I. 'I never heered that Popish monks spent most of\r\ntheir evenings in the village inn with a bottle of Scotch whisky afore\r\neach man, and precious little left by closing time!'\"\r\n\r\n\"A hard-drinking lot then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful at their liquor. I tell you, zur, it's good for me! Now I've\r\ngot used to them and their funny ways, I wish they'd stay for ever.\r\nSpeaking from a strictly business point of view, that is. But soon\r\nthey'll find out they've lost their money and they'll jack it up. 'Tes\r\nnot in reason as they can go on, though they do seem so full of hope and\r\ncertainty, as you mind to up! But I _know_.\"\r\n\r\nHe was obviously pleased with my interest in his talk. I wondered what\r\nhe would have said if he had known who I was and why I was there? Under\r\na calm exterior, a professor munching potato pasty! I was filled with a\r\nfurious excitement. The man's gossip was worth a sovereign a word. Here\r\nwas, moment by moment, what looked like complete confirmation of our\r\nsuspicions. And yet, even as I realized this, I realized also how\r\ninfernally clever the scheme was. Without the clue which Danjuro and\r\nmyself alone possessed, there was nothing in the world to connect\r\nHelzephron and Tregeraint with the business that was ruffling the calm\r\nof two continents.\r\n\r\nIt was not my game to ask more direct questions than I could help. It\r\nwas better to let the racy stream flow on, with a word of comment now\r\nand then. I ventured a calculated one now.\r\n\r\n\"Fools and their money are soon parted,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"You may say that, zur! And they've poured out money like water.\r\nElectric light, oal sorts o' cases full of new-fangled machinery, and\r\nthat mystery made about the silly old mine you'd think it was a seam of\r\ndiamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good, Mr. Trewhella!\" I rose\r\nfrom the table as I spoke. \"But what you say about a dozen or more\r\ngentlemen drinking nearly a bottle of whisky each rather surprises me.\r\nI'm no foe to honest enjoyment, but ...\"\r\n\r\nI put on a slight primness of manner, as became the character I\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nThe landlord nodded vigorously. \"'Tes so!\" he agreed, \"and most onusual.\r\nThey be gentlefolk, sure 'nuff, but shall I tell 'ee what I think?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think as most of 'em's dropped out, so to speak. I shouldn't be\r\nfrightened if as their families didn't have anything to say to 'em, and\r\nthey've nowhere much else to go. Mr. Helzephron knows what he's about,\r\nhe do. I judge by a kind o' reckless way they have, 'specially the\r\nyounger gentlemen. They don't seem to mind about ordinary things same as\r\nmost. Well, I suppose this fool tin-mining keeps 'em out of mischief.\"\r\n\r\nI wondered.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I set out upon the return journey I took another route. I found\r\nfrom the landlord that by skirting the coast for a mile in the direction\r\nof St. Ives I could come upon a moorland path that would take me to the\r\nlittle railway-station of St. Erth. I could then catch a train for\r\nPenzance. My ostensible reason was to vary my walk, my real one that by\r\nthis change of plan I should pass by and have a view of Tregeraint Mine\r\nand the Manor House.\r\n\r\n\"Not that you'll see much or get close,\" said Mr. Trewhella.\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that Mr. Helzephron\"--apparently the hawk-faced man had\r\ndropped his military title in Cornwall--\"do make a mystery of his\r\npeddling mine. He goes further than that. The mine buildings and the\r\nhouse are surrounded by two fences of barbed-wire and the Manor by a\r\nhigh wall. 'Trespassers,' notice boards belong to say, 'will be\r\nprosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shan't attempt to trespass, Mr. Trewhella!\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord laughed. \"Mine prospectin's not in the way of a larned\r\ngentleman like yourself. Maybe it's as well. Mr. Helzephron has got two\r\ndogs he turns out at night, and terrible ugly customers they be. Mr.\r\nVargus do tell me that they be Tibetan mastiffs, which am the largest\r\ndogs in the world. They look like a sour-faced Newfoundland with heavy\r\nears, only bigger.\"\r\n\r\nI tramped away from \"The Miners' Arms.\" Although I recognized the fact\r\nthat we were only at the fringe of discovery, my mind was made up. Thick\r\ndarkness surrounded me, but I was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt\r\nthat Major Helzephron, and no other, was the man for whom the whole\r\nworld was hunting.\r\n\r\nAnd as I thought of him and the crew of lost and reckless men who did\r\nhis will, the fair landscape seemed to darken, the sweet airs to be\r\ntainted....\r\n\r\nThe path I traversed was the coastguard's path, as I could see by the\r\nwhite-washed boulders to serve as a guide by night. It was never more\r\nthan two or three yards away from the brink of the savage precipices\r\nthat fell for two hundred and fifty feet sheer to the water. The ocean\r\nwas on my left; on the right the great hill, known as Carne Zerran,\r\ntowered up, and the edge of the high moors cut the sky. On that side it\r\nwas as though one were walking at the bottom of a cup.\r\n\r\nAfter about half a mile of the path, it suddenly left the cliff edge,\r\nand turned inland. For several hundred yards the brink was guarded by a\r\nsemicircle of barbed-wire fence, which made it impossible to approach. A\r\nnotice board informed the wayfarer that here, owing to old mining\r\noperations, the cliff was extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt looked so, indeed. The edge was broken and irregular. I saw that it\r\nran out in a curious headland for a considerable way, a mere wall of\r\nrock with a razor-back path on the top, which curved round again and ran\r\nparallel to the cliff on which I was, making a mighty chasm from which\r\nrose the cries of innumerable sea-birds. There was a narrow mouth\r\nseawards, and another headland jutted out to make a cove like the one at\r\nthe inn, though that, of course, had no winding cañon at the end.\r\n\r\nI crept up to the brink, where the wire fence began, and, lying down,\r\nwith one arm round the first post, peered over.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible place. The rock overhung so for hundreds of yards that\r\nI could not see the bottom. But the other side of the cañon was clear to\r\nview, a great wall of black rock, where sea-hawks nested, and\r\ninaccessible to the boldest climber. To the right the cove seemed to be\r\nof fair size from horn to horn, but it was no tranquil spot like the one\r\nat the back of the inn. Even on a calm day like the present, the\r\nAtlantic ground swell poured in with tremendous force, and was broken\r\nwith ferocious whirlpools and spray-fountains by toothed rock-ledges a\r\nfoot or two below the surface. The smallest boat could not have entered\r\nTregeraint Cove and lived there for a moment.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other the place affected me most unpleasantly, and\r\nit was with a little shudder that I retreated and skirted the fence\r\nwhich guarded the dangerous part of the cliff. When I had passed by\r\nthis, the path turned at right angles and went inland.\r\n\r\nAs I turned I saw, perhaps a furlong away, the house of Helzephron.\r\n\r\nIt lay upon the eastern slope of Carne Zerran, an ancient, grim-looking\r\nhouse of granite, long, low, and of considerable size. A few stunted\r\ntrees grew round about, and a fairly extensive domain of gardens, as I\r\nsupposed, surrounded by a high wall. Using my prism glasses, I could see\r\nthat this wall was topped by iron spikes. Of course, I was considerably\r\nbelow Tregeraint as on the sloping hill-side, and it lay quite open to\r\nview. Higher up, and beyond the house, was the derrick, engine-house and\r\nsheds of the mine, with here and there dumps of débris and various\r\nsheds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wire fences, which I soon made out, went round the whole\r\nproperty, it lay quite open to the view. And when I had passed it, and\r\nclimbed to the table-land of the moor beyond, I saw that it would be\r\neven more open to the eyes--spread out like a map, in short.\r\n\r\nOne thing was already certain. There was nothing whatever in the nature\r\nof a hangar, no building that could possibly shelter even an ordinary\r\nfour or five seater biplane, to say nothing of an air cruiser.\r\n\r\nI was not disappointed, because I had hardly expected to meet with\r\nanything of the kind. The pirate ship, you will remember, was--like all\r\nthe big long-distance airships--a cross between what used to be known in\r\nthe old days as the \"seaplane\" and the \"flying-boat.\" True, some of our\r\nwar aeroplanes of quite large size were fitted with floats that could be\r\nraised, and wheels for land work in addition.\r\n\r\nThis might be the case with the pirate. But it was not to be thought of\r\nfor a moment that a man of Helzephron's intelligence would dare to house\r\nhis extraordinary ship where any one of my police could have\r\ninvestigated simply by showing his badge of office. The land policeman\r\nand the coastguards of the whole English coastline had already reported\r\non every hangar and aerodrome in the kingdom. If Helzephron was the man\r\nI believed him, I was well aware that we were only at the beginning of\r\nthe duel.\r\n\r\nI mounted up past the wire fences and the mine. I did not dare to use my\r\nglasses in passing, for I saw in the distance one or two figures of men\r\nstrolling about by the engine-house and derrick. But when I was at last\r\namong the heather at the top, I lay down, and took a long survey of the\r\nbuildings, drawing a careful map in my pocket-book, which might prove\r\nof great use later on.\r\n\r\nI waited half an hour at the little station of St. Erth, and then caught\r\na train to Penzance, arriving at the hotel about tea-time. As I came\r\ninto the lounge, after a wash and brush up, I saw Danjuro sitting in one\r\ncorner. He had a pile of newspapers round him, and I saw that the London\r\njournals had arrived.\r\n\r\nHe handed me one of them as I sat down. A paragraph among the police\r\nnews was marked in pencil.\r\n\r\nMajor Helzephron had been taken to Vine Street Police Station, and\r\nlocked up for the night, charged with an aggravated assault on Mr. Wag\r\nAshton at the Mille Colonnes Restaurant, on the evidence of M. Nicholas\r\nand the head-waiter.\r\n\r\nA medical man had attended the Court on behalf of the prosecutor, to say\r\nthat Mr. Ashton was too unwell to appear until the morrow. Upon his\r\npromising to attend the Court the next day, Major Helzephron was\r\nadmitted to bail.\r\n\r\n\"That gives us nearly two clear days,\" said Danjuro. \"When Ashton does\r\nappear, he will not press the case, and will own that he gave\r\nprovocation; Helzephron will be fined, perhaps let off. I see that\r\nHonourable Ashton battered him a good deal! And now, your news, Sir\r\nJohn, if you please.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\"THE AIR WOLVES ARE HUNTING TO-NIGHT!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made no comment, and did not interrupt me until I had completely\r\nfinished, nor did his inscrutable face give any indication of what he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"My own investigations,\" he said, \"can be told in a few words. The small\r\nsteamship which brings supplies to the cove behind the inn is the\r\nprivate property of Helzephron, and she is a great deal faster and much\r\nbetter engined than most people are aware. She lies at the little port\r\nof Hayle, which is on the main line from Plymouth to Penzance, in St.\r\nIves Bay. At certain times _large quantities of petrol arrive in\r\nseparate consignments from different parts of the country_. The _Sea\r\nGull_ is loaded to her capacity, and then makes the short voyage to\r\nZerran Cove.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the last link!\" I said. \"No one could doubt now!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another, still more interesting fact. Hayle was once a place\r\nof much greater importance than it is at present. There were large\r\nfoundries and engineering works there in the past. These have been\r\nabandoned, owing to the silting up of the harbour, for many years, as\r\nonly vessels of small draught can enter easily to-day. But the foundry\r\nbuildings remain. From time to time a portion of them has been let for\r\nthis or that small enterprise. Three years ago Helzephron rented a part\r\nof the works and installed machinery. He had about twenty labourers, but\r\nthe real work, whatever it was, took place in a large experimental shed,\r\nto which no one was admitted but he and his friends. They were already\r\nat Zerran, and used to drive over in motors every day. It was locally\r\nknown that some new machinery for Wheal Tregeraint was being made. Many\r\nshippings took place from Hayle to Zerran Cove.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the ship, the Pirate Ship itself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who can tell? We go step by step in the dark. Many theories have\r\ncrossed my mind. I have dismissed them all. I want to approach this, the\r\nmost sinister problem of all, with a blank mind. We can do nothing till\r\nwe are on the spot. Our preliminary work is over, but the real labour\r\nbegins.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sinister problem enough,\" I answered bitterly. \"But not the most\r\ntrouble to me. I tell you, Danjuro, that as I lay among the heather and\r\nlooked down upon that lonely house, as I thought of the devilish crew\r\nthat live there, for a moment my heart turned to water, and the agony\r\nwas more than I could endure. _She_ may be there, at this moment,\r\ndefenceless and in the power ...\"\r\n\r\nI could not go on. I covered my face with my hands, and was nearer\r\nbreaking down than ever before. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"It\r\nhas never left my mind, either. Do not give way, for the moment of\r\naction has come. We go to the inn at Zerran to-night--within the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We cannot afford to waste a moment. Helzephron is kept in London.\r\nOne great danger is removed from our path. We shall never have a better\r\nopportunity than now. In dealing with enemies such as ours, we must\r\nstrike quickly and strongly when they think themselves most secure.\r\nBefore dawn we must have penetrated the inmost secrets of Tregeraint.\"\r\n\r\nI had by now grown accustomed to regard Danjuro as the leader of our\r\nenterprise. His decision was like cool water to a man dying of thirst in\r\na desert. I stood up, absolutely myself. \"There is, of course, no reason\r\nwhy we should not install ourselves at Zerran to-night instead of\r\nto-morrow morning. Trewhella won't mind,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I will order the car in an hour. Meanwhile, I have one or two things to\r\ndo. Perhaps you will settle the hotel bill, Sir John, and tell the\r\npeople that we are leaving?...\"\r\n\r\nIt was a stiflingly hot night as the car climbed up to the moors, and in\r\nthe glare of our headlights the gorse and heather by the roadside\r\nstreamed swiftly like some golden cinema, leaving a more sable dark\r\nbefore and behind them. Danjuro, by my side, was lost in thought. The\r\nmassive head hung upon his chest. About half-way on our journey he said\r\na curious thing. \"This would be an ideal night for another raid in the\r\nair-lanes of the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nI did not answer, for I, also, was thinking deeply. So it was for\r\nto-night! We crossed swords, fired the first shot, what you will, with\r\nour cunning enemy in a few hours. What would they bring forth?\r\n\r\nI felt no fear, only a deep resolution not to fail in rescue and the\r\nexecution of Justice. I was happier than I had been for days, for it is\r\nthought that turns the bones to pith and thins the blood, not action.\r\nAnd, as we flashed down the dark moor road to where the lights of the\r\nsolitary inn showed yellow, I sent a wordless prayer to the Throne of\r\nJustice and Mercy. And, as if an answer was truly and instantly\r\nvouchsafed, there came into my mind these words from the ninety-first\r\nPsalm: \"I will deliver thee from the snare of the hunter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after that I put mere abstract thought away from me.\r\n\r\nAs we rolled up silently to the inn, we heard a great noise of singing\r\nfrom the long room. A tall woman came out of a side door, and I\r\nexplained that we had decided to come earlier than we had planned. She\r\nwas a comely, good-humoured dame, who made no trouble about our arrival.\r\nBoth bedrooms and sitting-rooms were prepared, and when Thumbwood had\r\ntaken the car round to the barn, he went upstairs to unpack the baggage.\r\nMr. Trewhella appeared from the bar. I introduced Danjuro, and we\r\narranged to have some supper at half-past ten.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the singing continued in great volume, mingled with the\r\ntwanging chords of a banjo.\r\n\r\n\"Your guests are merry to-night,\" said Danjuro.\r\n\r\n\"It's the gentlemen from the mine, sir,\" said the landlord. \"It's one of\r\ntheir nights off, so to speak. Would you like to join 'em for half an\r\nhour?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not on our first night. But they sing very well. As a foreigner\r\nI am interested in all English customs; may I take a peep?...\"\r\n\r\nHe had gone to the communicating door as he spoke, and pulling aside a\r\nred curtain which covered the upper half of glass, he looked through. I\r\ndid the same.\r\n\r\nThe long room was full of people and tobacco smoke. With a single\r\nexception, that of Mr. Vargus, they were all quite young men, ranging,\r\nI should say, from three-and-twenty to thirty. Most of them were dressed\r\nin old tweed suits, but the material and cut told their own tale, and\r\nspoke of the \"right\" kind of tailor. At first glance they might have\r\nbeen a collection of naval officers or senior undergraduates, but only\r\nat first glance. My eyes roved from face to face, and on each I saw the\r\nloss of innocence and honour. Some were cunning; others had a brutality\r\nin ill accord with their youth, and there was a hard bravado in the eyes\r\nof all. It was sickening. One felt that one had suddenly looked upon\r\nsomething that should remain hidden. In that haze of smoke lurked all\r\nthat was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and evil in the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nI almost wanted to spit upon the floor, in an uncontrollable gesture of\r\nrepudiation. As I turned, I saw the landlord looking at me.\r\n\r\n\"A promising lot of young devils,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"You do see it too, zur?\" he replied, and then Danjuro touched my arm,\r\nand I turned to look again. A man, without a hat, had just entered the\r\nroom from the outside. He sat in a chair which he had obviously occupied\r\nbefore, for he was in naval uniform, and his cap was lying there. He was\r\na big, foolish-looking fellow, far gone in drink, but despite that his\r\nface was the only wholesome one there.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\" I whispered to Trewhella, as Mr. Vargus poured a\r\ngenerous allowance of rum into the new-comer's glass.\r\n\r\n\"That's Billy Pengelly, our coastguard. The gentlemen do make a lot of\r\nhim, and he's none the better for't, for Billy's one as likes his drop.\r\nStill, he goes and sleeps it off, and he belong to be strong as a bull.\r\nAnd in these lone parts there's not often anyone to see if he's on the\r\nwatch or not.\"\r\n\r\nA tall boy with a banjo took up his instrument and twanged the chords.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen!\" he shouted in a clear fresh tenor, \"a chorus!\" And\r\nwithout further preliminary he dashed into nothing less than the\r\n\"Pirate's Chanty\" from \"Treasure Island\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Fifteen men on the dead man's chest!\r\n          Yo, ho! and a bottle of rum!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inn rocked with the volume of sound. I stood there fascinated, with\r\na sort of horror. The thing--knowing what I knew--was so daring and grim\r\nthat, more than anything else, it showed me with whom we had to deal.\r\n\r\nThe application was lost upon Danjuro, but I told him what it meant in\r\nFrench, and he nodded with contracted eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Drink, and the devil had done for the rest,\r\n       Yo, ho! and a bottle of rum!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that the room could not contain the noise, and\r\nthat the very windows must be shattered, and in the very middle of it I\r\nheard something else--the urgent, throbbing sound of an engine.\r\n\r\nDanjuro heard it as soon as I did. \"Motor-bicycle,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nThe sound grew insistent. Whoever was coming rode hell for leather and\r\nwith the exhaust open. Then there was a succession of reports, a\r\ngrinding noise, and the door of the bar was flung suddenly open.\r\n\r\nA tall man in goggles and overalls covered with dust walked in. As he\r\ndid so, the pirate chant stopped with dramatic suddenness, and the\r\nsingers jumped to their feet. Then he removed his glasses and his cap.\r\n\r\nIt was Major Helzephron.\r\n\r\nThey clustered round him thickly, and to each one he said a quiet word.\r\nIn every case, when this happened, the man spoken to nodded and vanished\r\ninto the night. I could hear them running outside the inn. Lastly,\r\nHelzephron took Vargus by the arm, and they also passed out. I could see\r\nthe man more plainly than ever before. There was a great bruise round\r\nabout the left eye, and the face was pale. But it blazed with will and\r\npurpose, and the cruel mouth was set in a malicious and abominable\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"_The wolves are hunting to-night!_\" Danjuro said to me two minutes\r\nlater in my bedroom, and once again his face was like a demon of Old\r\nJapan. \"Helzephron will not appear at the police court to-morrow. He has\r\narranged it somehow, and, after all, it is a trivial affair. He has\r\nridden down from London during the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that there is going to be a raid to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel sure of it. Why else should Helzephron rush from London? And you\r\nobserved the manner of his confederates. Don't you see this--with all\r\nhis cunning precautions the pirate is far too clever not to know that\r\nhis career must be a short one. He cannot hope to remain concealed for\r\nany great length of time. His object is to obtain an immense fortune\r\n_quickly_. Already I calculate he has stolen jewels and money to the\r\nvalue of two hundred thousand pounds. A few more such coups and he can\r\ndisband his crew and disappear for ever. Speed is the essence of his\r\nplan.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must do something, we must stop it....\"\r\n\r\n\"Our opportunity for action is improved, Sir John. In the first place,\r\nyou must take steps to concentrate a fleet of patrol ships in this\r\nneighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"The car is here. I can write official telegrams in code to Plymouth\r\nand London. Within an hour the hinterland and the sea from here to\r\nScilly can be covered with a swarm of ships. St. Ives is only six miles\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Write the dispatches at once. I will call Thumbwood, who must take them\r\nin, together with an official note from you to the postmaster.\"\r\n\r\nI unlocked my portfolio and wrote the wires. There should be such an\r\ninvasion of the air to-night as Far West Cornwall had never known!\r\n\r\nThumbwood appeared, I gave him full instructions, and heard the\r\nRolls-Royce start below.\r\n\r\n\"And now, our part!\" I said to Danjuro.\r\n\r\n\"If we are right in our conjecture, the pirates will shortly leave\r\nTregeraint on their expedition. How they will join the airship or where\r\nwe don't know. But we may safely assume that the house will be left in\r\ncharge of one or at most two men. The others will all be wanted to man\r\nthe ship; it is a simple calculation. Here is your chance. You must get\r\ninside Tregeraint, obtain conclusive evidence, and if the poor lady is\r\nthere alive, bring her away in safety. Perhaps to-night the Pirate Ship\r\nwill make its last cruise! Our presence here, our identity, is quite\r\nunsuspected. A concentration of hostile airships in this neighbourhood\r\nis the last thing Helzephron will expect to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would that I could come with you, for you go in danger of your life,\r\nbut, as I see it, my work should be different. Someone, in view of its\r\nescape, _must_ solve the mystery of the Pirate Ship itself. I have a\r\ntheory already; I must put it to proof. There are boats in the cove\r\nbelow--I see that the moon is rising, I know what I must do. But, even\r\nso, I will come with you, Sir John, if you say so.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"No, I will go alone. It is my job.\"\r\n\r\nThen Danjuro did a strange thing. He took my hand, bowed over it and\r\nkissed it! \"You also are of the Samurai!\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn a minute more he carried in a heavy bag from his own bedroom, and\r\nproduced from it a miscellany of objects.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a twelve-shot automatic, with a dozen cartridge clips,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You know all about the working of it? I thought so. This pair of\r\nwire-cutters you will need for the barbed fence. These two keys with\r\nadjustable wards--you turn the milled screw at the end to adjust\r\nthem--will open any ordinary lock. Here also is an extremely powerful\r\nsteel lever, with a wedge end. In the hands of a strong man like\r\nyourself it will wrench open most windows or doors.\"\r\n\r\nGod knows there was no lightness in my heart, but in the usual English\r\nway at serious moments, I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"The Complete Burglar!\" I said.\r\n\r\nDanjuro looked at me with a glance as cold as ice.\r\n\r\n\"I am in most deadly earnest, Sir John. You know what my experience has\r\nbeen. Well, I say deliberately that I have never been in such peril as\r\nyou are going into.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant nothing. And what is this?\" I had taken up a little leather\r\ntube with a lens at one end.\r\n\r\n\"A powerful electric torch. But it is more than that. You can instantly\r\nreverse it in your hand, and if you press this stud, the plated bottom\r\nflies open, and by means of a spring an ounce of cayenne pepper is\r\nprojected for several yards. It will stop anyone and operates\r\ninstantaneously. A little thing I invented and have found most useful.\r\nThese handcuffs are of papier mâché and weigh practically nothing. They\r\nare from Japan and tough as the hardest steel. You may require them. And\r\nI never go on an expedition without this tiny bottle of chloroform and\r\npad. You can stow everything about you with ease, and the combined\r\nweight is as nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and it was as he said. Then a thought struck me.\r\n\r\n\"Armed and prepared like this, I feel certain that I shall get in. But\r\nthere are two Tibetan mastiffs let loose in the grounds at night. I can\r\nshoot them, but the noise of the report ...\"\r\n\r\n\"That is provided for, Sir John. You see this gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks like a short-barrelled rook-rifle, except for the great\r\nthickness at the breech.\"\r\n\r\n\"It holds ten conical bullets. They are hollow-nosed and expand on\r\nimpact. The point is that the gun is perfectly noiseless. Powder is not\r\nused at all. The propelling power is liquefied carbonic-acid gas, and\r\nall that is heard at the moment of firing is a sharp snap. With this you\r\ncan stalk the dogs and kill them easily enough. Do not forget your\r\nhunting flask and brandy and water. And for concentrated food, should\r\nyou be detained in hiding, though I and Thumbwood will be coming to look\r\nafter you if you don't appear by morning, these solid chocolate cakes\r\nare invaluable.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was done quickly, and with the most business-like precision.\r\nAlthough my sense of humour told me that I was like the White Knight in\r\n\"Alice in Wonderland,\" I did realize that I should be a terribly nasty\r\ncustomer to tackle, and I was grateful.\r\n\r\nWhile we had been talking there came sounds from below of the closing of\r\nthe inn, and shortly after we were called to supper.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you stay up any longer, Mr. Trewhella,\" I said. \"You must want\r\nyour rest. As for us, we are late birds. Both I and my friend sometimes\r\ntake a five minutes' stroll last thing before we turn in. That won't\r\ninconvenience you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless your life, no, zur. You do as you're a mind here. 'Tesn't like a\r\ntown. The key of the front door hangs on a nail by the side. And if you\r\n_should_ be going out later, Billy Pengelly's in the empty pigsty, a\r\nsleeping off what he's had, and there's a bucket of cold water on the\r\nwall. In half an hour's time or so I know as he'd be grateful for having\r\nit poured over 'en!\"\r\n\r\nWe promised to perform what was evidently one of the amenities of this\r\nprimitive place and Mr. Trewhella withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"That coastguard may be useful to me,\" Danjuro said. \"And now, Sir John,\r\nI don't want to hurry you, but my advice is that you start. I don't\r\nsuppose that the band has left Tregeraint yet. But there are a hundred\r\nhiding-places on the moor all round the domain, and you may be able to\r\nsee which way they go before you make your own attempt. I shall be on\r\nthe trail in a very few minutes after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Charles? He will be back shortly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall need him. I know he would wish to be with you, Sir John, but I\r\nbelieve your chances are better alone. I shall not leave until he\r\nreturns, provided he is not unduly detained.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and pulled aside the curtain. \"A waning moon,\" he\r\nsaid, \"which will be at full power about midnight, when there may be\r\nsuch a battle in the air as the world will hear with wonder!\"\r\n\r\nI saw to my gear. It fitted about me very comfortably.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night,\" I said, and without further words I went quietly out\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nWhen I got a hundred yards away I turned and looked at it, all silvered\r\nin the moon. The air was sweet with the perfume of shy moorland flowers\r\nthat give up all their treasure to the night. The Atlantic, far below,\r\nmade a sound like fairy dreams, and on the distant slopes of Carne\r\nZerran an owl sounded his melancholy oboe note.\r\n\r\nA lovely night, gentlemen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE KILLING OF MICHAEL FEDDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon was in its last quarter, and shed a faint spectral light over\r\nthe moor as I came quietly up to the first of the barbed-wire fences\r\nthat surrounded Tregeraint. I lay down in the heath, certain that I was\r\nquite invisible, and waited.\r\n\r\nAn hour had hardly elapsed since the band had left \"The Miners' Arms.\"\r\nWere they still here, or had they set out for their unknown destination?\r\nI could not hear a sound of any kind. From where I lay the high wall hid\r\nthe house, and among the mine buildings higher up there was neither\r\nlight nor movement. Tregeraint might have been deserted for a hundred\r\nyears, and the roaring company of the inn had vanished into thin air.\r\nAnd strain my eyes as I would, there was no sign of the great Tibetan\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nI remained motionless for a quarter of an hour by the illuminated dial\r\nof my watch. Then, as nothing happened, I began operations. The wire\r\nwas tough and intricate, but ten minutes' work with Danjuro's powerful\r\ncutters disposed of it sufficiently for me to crawl through both the\r\nfirst and second fence without a scratch. I stood now in the lower\r\nportion of a large, oblong paddock of short grass, all grey in the moon.\r\nThe surrounding wall of the Manor was about a hundred yards up the\r\nslope, and with the gas rifle on my arm I glided over the intervening\r\nspace like a ghost. My boots were soled with india-rubber and I made no\r\nsound at all.\r\n\r\nI found the wall to be ten or eleven feet high. It was crowned with a\r\n_cheval de frise_ of iron spikes, and, owing to its height and smooth\r\nsurface, quite insurmountable. But I knew there must be an entrance\r\nsomewhere, and never expected to climb the barrier, and I began a\r\ncautious circuit. About half-way round the extent I came to a wooden\r\ndoor set in the wall. It was a mere postern, not more than five feet\r\nhigh, and had a barred _grille_ in the centre of about a foot square. I\r\nreflected that this must be a side or garden exit, and that the main\r\ngate was probably on the other side, facing the mine-head. But it was\r\nall the better for my purpose if this was so, and I took out my steel\r\n\"jemmy\" and prepared to tackle it.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to prise it open with my tool, for I am a very powerful\r\nman, but suddenly another idea occurred to me. The bars of the _grille_\r\nwere old and rusted. As there was no key-hole in the door, it was\r\nobviously secured by bolts. I inserted my lever, and without putting out\r\nmy full strength, and with little more sound than is made by the\r\nstriking of a match, soon had three of the bars out of the wood and\r\nlying on the grass.\r\n\r\nMy arms are long. I pushed my right through and my fingers, after a\r\nlittle groping, caught the handle of the bolt, which slid back easily\r\nenough. It had been oiled and showed that the door, which swung back at\r\nonce, was in constant use.\r\n\r\nI stepped within, treading like a cat, and closed the door behind me. I\r\nstood in a large and neglected garden, where shrubs and flowers grew as\r\nthey would and formed a miniature jungle, through which I could see the\r\ndark façade of the house, now quite close. Everything was as still as\r\ndeath, and I listened with strained attention for several minutes. So\r\nfar the work had been ridiculously easy, but as I crept up a moss-grown\r\npath towards the building every nerve was on the alert. I was not\r\nafraid, I think I can truly say so, but there was a chill on my soul.\r\nThis old house, with its atmosphere of robbery and murder, its singular\r\nand formidable inhabitants, the unknown dangers of the approach, and,\r\nabove all, the thought that Connie might be within it, all combined to\r\nwrap me in a terrible gloom of the spirit. Yet, looking back, I see\r\nthat this was well. It hardened all my resolution and made me terrible.\r\n\r\nI had no thought of it then, but now I can see the grim horror of such a\r\nbeing as I had become approaching the house step by step....\r\n\r\nAll the lower windows were shuttered. There was not a gleam of light\r\nanywhere as I followed the path and came to the front, where there was a\r\ngrass-grown gravel sweep and iron gates in the wall. This part of the\r\nhouse was plain and unadorned, save for a pillared porch and steps\r\nleading down to the drive. A thick growth of ivy covered it from the\r\nground to the first-floor windows, and after I had gently tried the\r\nheavy front door, which, as I expected, was locked, this suggested a\r\nmode of entrance. If I could climb up and get on to the roof of the\r\nporch, it might be possible to force the central bedroom window, which I\r\ncould see was unshuttered.\r\n\r\nThe ivy was of ancient growth, the stems thick and tough. Any schoolboy\r\ncould have mounted to the top of the porch. And any boy could have\r\npushed back the catch of the window with the blade of his pocket-knife,\r\nopened it and stepped inside.\r\n\r\nI stood in a bedroom, dark, except for a little pool of moonlight by the\r\nwindow. I felt curtains, and I drew them before I switched on my torch.\r\nIt was an ordinary bedroom, very untidy, furnished with a suite of\r\npainted deal. There was, however, a great saucer-bath full of water, and\r\na pair of Indian clubs. The wall was hung with photographs of football\r\nteams, and in an open drawer of the little dressing-table was a pile of\r\ngold and notes.\r\n\r\nCommonplace enough, like an undergraduate's room at Oxford, but,\r\nnevertheless, it affected me unpleasantly. It was like a sudden intimacy\r\nwith something abominable, as I opened the door inch by inch, and felt\r\nfor the powerful pistol in my pocket. My heart hung poised for an\r\ninstant as I stepped out into a dark corridor, and then I gave a gasp,\r\nand my heart almost stopped beating.\r\n\r\nI stood at the head of broad, shallow stairs. Below was a large hall,\r\ndimly lit, and pouring up to me in a volume of sound came the melodious\r\nthunder of a piano played by a master hand!\r\n\r\nAt first my knees grew weak, and I clutched the shadowy banisters to\r\nsave me from falling. Constance! Who could be playing in this evil house\r\nbut she! I can never forget the agonized pang of mingled joy and horror\r\nthat I felt. But as I crouched and listened, the fierce emotion passed\r\naway. Whoever was playing, it was not my girl. A lost soul made that\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nI glided down the stairs. Certainly the wolves had left their lair,\r\nthough in what manner I could not divine. The house was inhabited by\r\nbut one or two people at most. All the doors along the corridor stood\r\nopen, as if the rooms had been left in a hurry. The building _felt_\r\ndeserted, empty of its usual inhabitants....\r\n\r\nA dim light came from an open door at the right of the hall. I peeped in\r\nand saw a long shadowy room of great size. The walls were panelled and\r\nhung here and there with pictures, the floor carpeted. Two immense oak\r\ntables, with their complement of chairs, went up and down the centre,\r\nand it hardly needed a butler's hatch in the wall, doubtless\r\ncommunicating with the kitchen, to tell me that this was the dining-room\r\nof Helzephron and his buccaneers.\r\n\r\nAt the far end, and opposite the entrance door, was a wide and lofty\r\narchway, half covered by a curtain. It led to another room beyond, and\r\nit was from this that a bright light streamed, and the sound of music\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nI placed my gas rifle on the floor by the wall, took out my automatic,\r\nunlocking the safety catch, and went to the curtain on tiptoe. There was\r\nan alcove at the side, where some shelves had been, and this was\r\nperfectly dark. I marked it as a possible hiding-place, and then pulled\r\nthe curtain aside for half an inch. Just as I did so there was a clash\r\nof prelude, and the pianist began the enchanted Third Ballade of Chopin.\r\n\r\nIt was the man known to me as Vargus, the man with the smooth voice,\r\nthe face that was evil and refined. He sat at a magnificent grand piano,\r\nswaying a little on his stool....\r\n\r\nDo you know that marvellous composition of Chopin's? Most people have\r\nheard it at least once or twice in their lives, played by some\r\n_maestro_. I have heard the renderings of the great pianists of the\r\nworld, but none played as this man played.\r\n\r\nA terrible remorse informed the unearthly music. It was as though the\r\nplayer strained with every power of his being to recapture something\r\nirrevocably lost. When he came to that strange passage which has been so\r\noften compared to the soft cantering of a horse, the pain in the lovely\r\nchords was unbearable. The artist, Aubrey Beardsley, made a wonderful\r\ndrawing of this passage--a spectral white charger ambling through a dark\r\nwood of pines, bearing a lady in a cloak of black velvet. The picture\r\nrose before my eyes as I stood, but it flashed away, and words of awful\r\nsignificance took its place in my mind and fitted themselves to the\r\nclosing chords....\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Night and day he was among the tombs, and on the hills, crying\r\n     out and beating himself with stones._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you may know, the piece ends in a furious welter of sound. It had\r\njust concluded, and the player sat motionless as a wax doll, when\r\nanother figure heaved itself into my line of vision, a burly giant,\r\nwith red hair and a heavy, sullen face.\r\n\r\n\"Now you've finished that ---- row,\" he growled, \"we'd better be moving.\r\nWe may get signals coming through soon. And I suppose I must feed the\r\ncanaries!\"\r\n\r\nI knew the man at once. There was no possibility of mistake. It was\r\nMichael Feddon, the famous Rugby international, and six years ago the\r\nidol of the public. It was said that he was the finest back that England\r\nhad ever seen. In the height of his career he had been mixed up in a\r\nhorrible, criminal scandal, and received five years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nI swallowed in my throat with loathing, but the next words drove all\r\nthought of Feddon's career from my mind.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is ready on a tray in the kitchen, and the soup is on the\r\nelectric stove. It will be hot by now,\" said Vargus, in his soft, creamy\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it, and I wish the damned business was over. I said from the\r\nfirst that when the Chief brought those two women here we ran more risk\r\nthan ever before. It'll turn out badly yet. Mark my words, Vargus.\"\r\n\r\nVargus took up a bottle which stood on a table by the piano. It was\r\nbrandy, and he poured out two glasses half full, adding soda from a\r\nsiphon.\r\n\r\n\"Here's luck; not a bit of it,\" he said. \"If all goes well to-night, a\r\ncouple more expeditions will see us finished, with a hundred thousand\r\neach, and scattered all over the globe. We all have our fancies. The\r\nChief's is this Shepherd girl. Well, in another fortnight he'll\r\ndisappear with her. Every man to his taste.\"\r\n\r\nFeddon swallowed his brandy at a gulp. \"She'll lead him a dance yet!\" he\r\nsaid. \"I never saw such a spitfire. I hate going near her, and I wish it\r\nwasn't my turn to stay at home. I'd tame her, though, if she were mine.\r\nI wouldn't stand her pretty ways and the things she says, like the Chief\r\ndoes. He's mad about the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would you do, my beefy friend?\" said Vargus, with his\r\nabominable smile.\r\n\r\nFeddon touched his middle. He was wearing a leather belt. \"Take this to\r\nher,\" he said, \"and beat her black and blue.\"\r\n\r\nVargus rose, grinning. \"Well, get the food,\" he said. \"I'll go down at\r\nonce. You'll find me in the wireless cabin.\"\r\n\r\nFeddon lurched forward. I had just time to press myself into the alcove,\r\nwhen he came through the curtain and strode heavily through the room\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\nVargus went to a tall mirror by the piano, as I watched him\r\nbreathlessly. He did something that I could not see, and it swung open\r\nlike a door. There was the snap of an electric switch, and I saw him\r\nstep into a lift, pull a rope, and sink out of sight, leaving the door\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nHe could not have sunk ten feet when I was in the room. It was large and\r\nsquare, furnished with something like luxury, and brilliantly lit with\r\nelectric globes.\r\n\r\nThere was an arm-chair in full view of the archway. I sat down, and it\r\nwas still warm from its last occupant. That seemed to me amusing, and I\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nSomething clanked, a soft swishing noise changed to a distant rumble,\r\nand the lift came into sight. I had it covered, but it was\r\nempty--waiting for the man who was going to \"feed the canaries.\"\r\n\r\nI waited for him, too. There was a box of cigarettes close by. I lit one\r\nand smoked quietly. Then I heard him coming through the dining-room, his\r\nfootsteps and the rattle of a tray.\r\n\r\nThe half-drawn curtain bellied out and was pushed aside. Feddon stood\r\nthere with the tray in his hands and the light shining on his ugly red\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nHe saw me. His mouth opened and his eyes started out. He seemed\r\nunutterably foolish, like a great cod, and I laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nBut he was quick, oh, quick and clever! Like the famous footballer that\r\nhe was! In a second he had ducked, and the loaded tray was skimming\r\nacross the room straight at my head, as he hurled himself after it,\r\nquick as a snake strikes.\r\n\r\nI was ready, though. He was not. My first shot broke his shoulder and\r\nstopped him for an instant. Then, with a roar of pain and fury, he came\r\non again, and I shot him through the heart when he was three feet away.\r\n\r\nMr. Feddon would feed no more canaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET THAT PUZZLED TWO CONTINENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI stood looking down at Michael Feddon's body. I was stunned. For the\r\nman I had just killed I cared nothing, felt no emotion. I had saved him\r\nfrom the drop; that was all. But, though I had been convinced that\r\nDanjuro's and my own suspicions were absolute fact, the full realization\r\nhad come so suddenly that it clouded the mind.\r\n\r\nConstance _was_ here, and she was unharmed!\r\n\r\nI had, indeed, penetrated into the very centre of this lair of the\r\nair-wolves, and already had enough evidence to hang the lot. For a\r\nminute the mingled joy and relief was so great that I could not grasp\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe brandy bottle of Mr. Vargus was still on the side table. I stepped\r\nover the body--the leather belt which he had proposed as an instrument\r\nof correction for Constance was in full view--and helped myself\r\nsparingly. Almost immediately my brain cleared.\r\n\r\nI listened intently. The two shots from my automatic had alarmed no\r\none. The sinister house was as silent as before. It seemed quite certain\r\nthat Feddon and Vargus alone remained to guard it. Even the two Tibetan\r\nmastiffs of which I had heard so much had disappeared.\r\n\r\nTo my right, the tall mirror swung on its hinges, and the lift beyond\r\nwas lit by a globe in the roof. To what it led I did not know, probably\r\nsome cellar where poor Constance and her maid were imprisoned, though a\r\nlift seemed superfluous. At any rate, Vargus--the next person to\r\ntackle--was down there, and it was long odds that I could not get the\r\nbetter of him. Moreover, and this was in my favour, he was expecting\r\nFeddon, and the arrival of the lift would not startle him at first, if\r\nhe were close by.\r\n\r\nI examined the lift. It was electrically operated, and of a type\r\nperfectly familiar to me, fitted with an automatic magnetic brake. I saw\r\nthat it travelled from its secret recess behind the mirror to one other\r\nspot only, stopping nowhere on the way. A touch of the rope started it,\r\nand it would stop itself when its journey was done.\r\n\r\nWell, there was no use waiting. Again I must plunge into the unknown.\r\nConnie was waiting! I wondered how honourable Danjuro was getting on,\r\nand laid myself long odds that he wasn't having such an exciting time as\r\nI was! How he would stare if he came back to \"The Miners' Arms\" in a\r\nfew hours and found me there with Connie, and the artistic Mr. Vargus\r\ncooling down in the patent _papier mâché_ handcuffs from Japan! Mr.\r\nTrewhella of the inn had shown me a large pig, which he called \"Gladys,\"\r\nand of which he was fond. There was a vacant and stoutly-built sty next\r\ndoor, which would be an excellent place of confinement for the\r\ninterpreter of Chopin!\r\n\r\n... Yes, I thought these thoughts, even at that moment. I was madly\r\nexhilarated. Everything had gone so easily and well. I stepped into the\r\nlift humming a song. It was the old chanty that the pirates had roared\r\nin the inn two short hours ago:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Fifteen men on the dead man's chest._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a looking-glass on one side of the lift--probably the thing\r\nhad been bought entire at some sale--and I saw myself in it. The song\r\ndied away. Whose was this grim and terrible face, gashed with deep\r\nlines, with eyes that smouldered with a red light? Mine? I have told you\r\nhow Danjuro looked when the bloodhound that he was emerged for an\r\ninstant from behind the bland Oriental mask. There was not a pin to\r\nchoose between us.\r\n\r\nThe lift sank slowly. Every second I expected the soft jerk of its\r\nstopping. But the seconds went on. Down and down, what cellar was it\r\nthat lay so low? Were we dropping to the centre of the earth? It seemed\r\nan age before the motion slowed, and I had already obtained an inkling\r\nof the truth when a dim archway rose up before me, and the machine came\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\nThis was no cellar. I was deep down in Tregeraint Mine, which must run\r\nunder the house itself! In the necessity for fox-like caution, I did not\r\nfollow out the thought--not yet. But I believe that the subconscious\r\nbrain had already seen far into the mystery....\r\n\r\nI stepped out into a mine cutting. The walls were cut in the rock, and\r\nthe roof here and there shored up with heavy timber props. It was wide\r\nenough for two men to walk abreast, and quite eight feet high. Every\r\nfifteen yards or so hung a roughly-wired electric lamp, and the floor\r\nwas beaten hard by the passage of many feet. The air was hot and\r\nstagnant.\r\n\r\nI prowled down this passage without a sound, my pistol in my hand, ready\r\nto shoot at sight, but for what seemed an interminable time I met no\r\none, and saw nothing but the damp walls, here and there sparkling with\r\nyellow pyrites and the green of copper.\r\n\r\nThere came at length a rough wooden door, which swung easily open, and\r\nbeyond a much narrower and higher passage than before, a more natural\r\ncleft in the immemorial rock, it seemed, owing nothing to the agency of\r\nhuman hands. It dripped with water. Hitherto I had been walking on a\r\nlevel, now I trod a fairly steep descent, while the path was no longer\r\nstraight, but full of fantastic twistings. Each moment the air grew\r\ncooler, and each moment a deep, murmurous noise, like very faint and\r\nmuffled drums, grew louder.\r\n\r\nThe lights, now suspended from a thick and tarry cable, were less\r\nfrequent than at first, and the place was full of shadows. But as for\r\nthe noise, that could only be one thing, the Atlantic ground-swell. I\r\nwas approaching the sea, doubtless by one of the old mine \"adits,\" made\r\nfor ventilation many years ago and long before the invention of the\r\nelectric fan.\r\n\r\nThe narrow way ended in a door. It was latched but not locked, and I\r\npushed it slowly open. Immediately there was a sense of vast and gloomy\r\nspace. I say \"gloomy,\" for it was not absolutely dark. Here and there\r\nhung dim, yellow lights....\r\n\r\nAdvancing a step or two upon a floor of hard earth on sand, I found\r\nmyself in a vast cavern. It seemed as large as the shell of a cathedral,\r\nand for organ there was the plangent, echoing sound of sea waves. The\r\nsound came from my right, and was carried on a current of sweet,\r\nbrine-laden air. Peering through the darkness, I seemed to be aware of\r\na faint, ghostly radiance, a considerable distance away.\r\n\r\nI had lost the capacity for amazement, but not of quick thinking. In a\r\nlightning flash of realization I knew that I had penetrated to the heart\r\nof Helzephron's secret, even before my thoughts arranged themselves in\r\nsequence. And then, as near as possible coincident with my stepping\r\nthrough the door, I heard a shout.\r\n\r\nSomeone had seen me....\r\n\r\nThe shout came from the other side of the long, aisle-shaped cave.\r\nSimultaneously, half-way up the side, at a height of thirty feet from\r\nthe floor, there was a sudden illumination. I saw a broad ledge in the\r\nwall, railed round, with a ladder staircase descending from it. A little\r\nblack figure was leaning over the rail, and it was from this that the\r\nshouting came. It did not need his words to tell me that here was a\r\nwireless station. I could see the drum and the battery shelf quite\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n\"A signal!\" he shouted, and I knew that he took me for the dead man\r\nabove. \"They're coming back! The sky swarms with armed patrols and\r\nwarships. They've had to run for it, but the Chief thinks he's shaken\r\nthem off. I must switch on the guides!\"\r\n\r\nI gave an answering shout, keying my voice down to something like\r\nFeddon's bass growl.\r\n\r\n\"It's C.Q.D.!--C.Q.D.!\" came in a shrill voice of alarm, and Mr. Vargus\r\nran down the ladder like an ape.\r\n\r\nC.Q.D.! The signal of \"extreme danger.\" Well, I rather thought it was!\r\n\r\nWhere I stood I was in deep shadow, and my face could not possibly be\r\nseen. I was much the same height and build as the dead man, and Vargus\r\nran down the cave without the least suspicion. He had gone to his left,\r\nmy right, to where I had already seen a pale light, and I followed him,\r\nmore slowly, at a distance of some ten yards. It was a natural instinct\r\nenough. My only idea was to silence him, find Constance, and fly from\r\nthe horrible place. I could not know that I was making a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nI was running forward into complete understanding. The great cave turned\r\na little to the right. It opened out every second until at length I saw\r\nthe mouth, wide as that of the largest-sized hangar on an aerodrome,\r\nflooded with moonlight!\r\n\r\nOpposite, sixty yards away, was a precipitous wall of black rock;\r\nbetween it and the mouth of the cave a terrible chasm, which fell sheer\r\nto the water. It was all clear now. Far above, on the top of the cliffs,\r\nwas that fenced-in part with the \"dangerous\" notice boards. You will\r\nremember that I had lain down by the side of this fence and peered\r\ndownwards. I had looked into the same gulf that I was now looking into\r\nfrom a much lower altitude. And the rock there overhung so greatly that\r\nthere was no possible indication of the cave mouth where I now stood.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the cave itself turned _inward_ from the sea, running parallel\r\nto the cliff. _From the sea, as from the land, the opening of the cave\r\nwas entirely hidden._\r\n\r\nVargus was fumbling at a switch-board. He pulled down a vulcanite\r\nhandle; there was a green spark, and lights at the top, bottom and sides\r\nof the entrance glowed out brightly.\r\n\r\nImagine an illuminated rabbit-hole in the side of a railway embankment,\r\nand you have an exact miniature of what this vast secret cave had now\r\nbecome. Go a little further and think of a bat whose lair was in this\r\nhole, and was guided to it by the lights....\r\n\r\nVargus snapped another and smaller switch. I watched him with a sense of\r\ncomplete detachment. I knew, as well as if I had been told, that he was\r\nlighting guiding lamps somewhere on the two headlands that guarded the\r\nentrance to the cave outside. No thought of danger came to me; I think\r\njoy at this complete discovery, and wonder at the stupendous cunning and\r\nachievement of it all were my only emotions.\r\n\r\n\"They may be here at any moment, Feddon. I tell you I don't like it at\r\nall. I told the Chief that it was madness not to lie low for a bit. But\r\nyou know what he is. The Government has got the tip somehow, the Cornish\r\nseas are _humming_ with enemies. That fellow, Custance, is smart as they\r\nmake them....\"\r\n\r\nHe was moving towards me as these words came from him in a nervous,\r\ndisjointed stream of words. Then he saw me, and stopped bang in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence.\r\n\r\nIt was my moment.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Vargus,\" I said. \"You mentioned my name. Indeed, you\r\npaid me a compliment for which I thank you. I thought I'd drop in for a\r\nchat. Sorry to find Major Helzephron out.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw a man in such deadly fear. His face went the colour of\r\ncheese, and a horrible choking noise began in his throat. He staggered\r\nto within a yard of the brink; another step and he would have plunged\r\ninto the abyss.\r\n\r\n\"You, you, _you_!\" he said, the last word in a dreadful whisper.\r\n\r\n\"The Oxford professor--yes. Mr. Vargus, I am a lover of music, and you\r\nhave entertained me royally to-night. But you have played Chopin for the\r\nlast time in this world.\"\r\n\r\nI lifted the pistol and covered his heart. His yellow mask quivered and\r\nwas still. \"Quickly, please,\" he said, and there was even a faint smile\r\nof relief about his pallid lips.\r\n\r\nHe could face death gladly, and I knew why. To have shot him there and\r\ncast his body to the void would have been a mercy. I had other uses for\r\nMr. Vargus.\r\n\r\nMy pistol hand was steady as a rock. With the left I took out Danjuro's\r\nhandcuffs and walked up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" I said, when I was within a foot.\r\n\r\nHe saw what I meant. As comprehension leapt into his eyes he tried to\r\nstep back. He nearly did it, but I was just too quick for him. I caught\r\nhis ankle with the crook of my right foot, and he crashed on his back\r\nwith his head and shoulders actually over the chasm. Before he could\r\nmove again I had jerked him backwards by the legs, and had him\r\nhandcuffed.\r\n\r\nI pulled him to his feet by his collar, and half marched, half carried\r\nhim back into the cave. He was nothing more than a bundle of clothes in\r\nmy hands.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" I said, \"take me _at once_ to the place where Miss Shepherd is\r\nconfined, and, though I make no promises, it may go less hardly with you\r\nthan the rest.\"\r\n\r\nHe twisted his head and tried to look me in the face. \"If I do, will you\r\nshoot me?\" he whispered, fawning on me like a beaten dog. \"For God's\r\nsake shoot me, or give me an opportunity to shoot myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hangman will save you the trouble,\" I answered brutally. \"Now then,\r\nmarch!\" He gave a great wail of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you don't know what I was once!\" he cried, and there was such a\r\nhorror of remorse, a damnation so profound in that cry of agony, that a\r\nfiend would have been moved.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you play the Third Ballade,\" I answered, and my voice was no\r\nlonger firm.\r\n\r\n\"Death, please, Death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take me quickly to Miss Shepherd. Then perhaps--I can't kill you\r\nmyself, but ...\"\r\n\r\nIt was as though my words poured a new life into his veins. His knees\r\nstill knocked together in a loathsome paralysis, but he made effort to\r\nshamble forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE AIR PIRATE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nVargus was silent now. Our feet made no noise upon the sandy floor of\r\nthe cave. It was then that I heard something like a cat purring.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously I stopped to listen. No, it wasn't a cat, it was the faint\r\ndrone of some night beetle; it was ...\r\n\r\nOn the right wall of the cavern, remember that my back was turned to its\r\nmouth and the sea--there was a sudden flash of white light.\r\n\r\nThe rest happened in five seconds.\r\n\r\nThe light leapt out from the wall, and instantaneously the vast vaulted\r\nplace was brilliantly illuminated. I had a fleeting vision of wooden\r\ngalleries, a workshop and smithy, piles of stores, and then I wheeled\r\nround with a shout of terror. The drone had leapt up to a deep, menacing\r\nnote, like the E string of a double bass. A circular furnace of white\r\nlight in the centre of a gigantic shadow rushed at me with incredible\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nA blast of wind struck me like the shell from a six-inch gun; the drone\r\nrose to the echoing shout of an army as the Pirate Airship entered the\r\ncave that was its home.\r\n\r\nI had just the millionth part of a second in which to realize the truth\r\nbefore my head struck; the wind seemed to tear out my very vitals, and I\r\nknew nothing more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce, when I was a boy at the seaside in Wales, I dived into a deep rock\r\npool, and, deceived by the clearness of the water, hit my head against a\r\nsubmerged ledge, and for several seconds was stunned. There was no one\r\nwith me, but, fortunately, I recovered in time, and with bursting lungs\r\nregained the surface.\r\n\r\nThe experience was repeated now, or so it seemed, with a curious\r\nsubconscious memory. I thought that I was rushing violently upwards\r\ntowards the light out of a well of darkness. Each moment the radiance\r\nincreased and my speed grew greater. There was a sound as of many waters\r\nin my ears.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes. The light was brilliant, painful. Also, it moved and\r\nflashed, and so it was not the sun of twenty years before beating\r\ndown....\r\n\r\nSomeone spoke: \"Yes, it's the man himself. He's shaved off his\r\nmoustache, and his hair and skin are dyed. He's a fair chap really.\r\nLook at his lower neck and chest. It's Sir John Custance right enough!\"\r\n\r\nI lay and listened. Although I heard every word, and perceived that an\r\nelectric torch was dancing about, the conversation hardly seemed to\r\nconcern me.\r\n\r\nThere was another voice: \"Vargus said he admitted it, but Vargus has\r\nfainted again.\"\r\n\r\nHands felt me all over. Things were taken from my pockets, and there\r\nwere sharp exclamations of surprise. Somebody gave a long, low whistle.\r\n\r\n\"No bones broken. His eyes are opening. Give me that flash, Gascoigne.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone poured brandy down my throat--I knew it was brandy--and I moved\r\nmy limbs and groaned.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a shout as a door that I could not see was burst open.\r\n\"Feddon's killed!\" came in a high, excited voice. \"Poor old Feddy's shot\r\nthrough the heart.\"\r\n\r\nI think it was at this precise moment that I regained full\r\nconsciousness, and realized that I was not badly hurt. My whole body\r\nfelt as if it had been severely beaten, but instinct told me that there\r\nwas no real damage. As for the shock, it was not until several hours\r\nafterwards that I felt its effect, though then it meant collapse.\r\n\r\nI lay perfectly still, this time by design, and closed my eyes.\r\nEverything had come back to me; I remembered every incident from the\r\nmoment I had cut the barbed wire to that when I had escaped, by a\r\nmiracle, death from the returning Pirate Ship.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was one of bitter disappointment. So they had run the\r\ngauntlet, after all! The mystery ship had escaped the swarm of cruisers\r\nand patrol boats that were looking for her. I believe I ground my teeth\r\nwith rage. A second afterwards I groaned out loud. The sound was wrung\r\nfrom my very heart. I was too late to rescue Constance now....\r\n\r\nAll round me there was a buzz of low-pitched voices. Without any trouble\r\nat all, I could detect the note of fear and consternation. And it was\r\ntonic. My plight seemed desperate enough, but there was a chance yet.\r\nThey had taken my weapons from me, but others might prove as valuable.\r\nThe pirates were disorganized, alarmed. Well, craft should meet craft!\r\nSurely, the moment was favourable?\r\n\r\nI was in a dimly-lit place, surrounded by dark figures. How long I lay\r\nthus I do not know, probably for no great space of time. At any rate, I\r\nhad not been in full possession of my faculties for many minutes when a\r\ndoor opened, and a voice spoke in accents of authority.\r\n\r\nIt was a voice that I had never heard before, but I knew whose it was.\r\n\r\n\"I have made a careful examination of the house,\" came in clear,\r\nwell-bred tones, \"and there is no one there. It is the same outside and\r\nall round the fence. I let the dogs loose and they discovered nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did this\"--I was kicked brutally in the side--\"get in, Chief?\"\r\nasked a voice.\r\n\r\n\"Cut the fence wire, and managed to open the door in the east wall. Then\r\nclimbed the porch and entered through Feddon's bedroom. The dogs\r\nfollowed the scent and showed. That doesn't matter much now. The point\r\nis that he's here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we know what to deduce from that!\" I heard, and pricked up my ears.\r\nMy friend Mr. Vargus had revived then! There was a soft malignancy in\r\nhis voice that made me shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Vargus is right. It is fairly certain that the game's up as far as this\r\nplace is concerned. They've marked us down, sure enough. In a few\r\nminutes I shall take steps to find out exactly how much they _do_ know.\r\nMeanwhile we appear to have some time before us, and we must carry out\r\nthe emergency plan that we've so often rehearsed. Gascoigne, Jones and\r\nSutton, Pointz, fill all the petrol tanks to full capacity, load\r\nemergency stores, examine and reverse ship. When finished, report to me\r\nin my room.\"\r\n\r\nThe men hurried away.\r\n\r\n\"Philips and Minver get on to the moor and report any man or body of men\r\nadvancing on the house. You will take rifles and act as outposts. At any\r\nsign of approach, don't hesitate to fire. Then fall back on the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we take the dogs, Chief? They would be useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall need them. The rest of you will hold the house till the\r\nlast moment. Then get into the lift and come down. It will take them\r\nsome time to find out the way and follow, while one man can hold the\r\npassages for any length of time. We shall all be fifty miles out at sea\r\nbefore anyone can break in down here, and all the swag is packed ready\r\nto go on board. Vargus, you will stay down here and help me in what I've\r\ngot to do.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other men left the room.\r\n\r\nIn a lower voice, though I heard every word, Helzephron went on talking\r\nto his lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"... Mind you, I don't actually expect an attack in force, but we must\r\nbe prepared. For all we know, there may be a hundred men waiting on the\r\nmoor. One thing is certain. They know where, or whereabouts we are, or\r\nthat gentleman on the floor would not have got in, nor all those ships\r\nbe cruising about outside. So we must be off with all we can take to our\r\nemergency base in the Hebrides. Once outside, nothing can touch us, of\r\ncourse, and we'd get up to sixteen thousand feet at once. Barometer\r\nreadings make it pretty certain that it will be cloudy at dawn, and it's\r\na million chances to one against our even being seen.\"\r\n\r\nI lay not three yards away. I had not noticed it until now, but my\r\nankles were tied together, and, weak as I was, any physical effort was\r\nimpossible. Helzephron had talked over his plans with an absolute\r\ndisregard of my presence. He may or may not have known that I was\r\nconscious; quite obviously he didn't care twopence one way or the other.\r\nAnd that meant one thing and one thing only.\r\n\r\nBefore the Pirate Ship fled from its lair for the last time John\r\nCustance would have ceased to exist in the body.\r\n\r\n\"... Now for Sir John. How do you feel, Vargus? You took a nasty toss,\r\nand it's damned lucky for you we turned up when we did! Do you feel\r\nstrong enough to drag Sir John into my room? If so, I'll go ahead and\r\nturn on the lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm quite strong enough for _that_,\" said Mr. Vargus, with a nasty\r\nlaugh, and in a few seconds he had me by the heels, and was towing me\r\nlike a log over an uneven floor. It was only by stiffening the muscles\r\nof my neck till they cracked that I could keep my head from bruising\r\nbadly. Then a cloth of some sort was dropped on my face and tied round\r\nmy head. I felt myself carried for a yard or two, put into a chair with\r\nan upright back, and then lashed securely to it by strong cords.\r\n\r\n\"I'll call you when I want you again,\" said the voice of Helzephron. \"Go\r\nand help the others load the ship. And remember that we must take every\r\nround of ammunition we can stow in her. Twenty-four hours' rations will\r\nbe ample. We can renew those at any time. Shells are quite another\r\nmatter. Sacrifice everything to them.\"\r\n\r\nA door closed. I heard the creak of a chair as Helzephron sat down.\r\nThere was a long silence, and through the cloth I could feel that he was\r\nwatching me.\r\n\r\nThe duel to the death began. I was as a naked man before another with a\r\nsword. I braced every nerve and stiffened my will!\r\n\r\n\"You are in a very unpleasant predicament, Sir John Custance.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was passionless, even a little weary.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's mutual, Mr. Helzephron,\" was my answer, and I put an\r\naccent on the \"_Mister_.\" He should have no honourable military title\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is possible. Indeed, I admit that you have seriously\r\nderanged my plans. But the trumps are mine, after all. With your\r\nintelligence you must be aware that you have a very short time to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt that, but I dispute your estimate of your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask why?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure. I don't care twopence about my own life in comparison\r\nwith my duty to society. You care a good deal for yours, and you also\r\nhave a short time in front of you. If it is any satisfaction to you to\r\nknow, you're in a net from which even the particular minor devils that\r\npreside over thieves can't free you.\"\r\n\r\nThus I lied bravely. A good deal, I thought, might depend on my ability\r\nto get the scoundrel into a furious rage, and, anyway, it was a delight\r\nto insult him.\r\n\r\nA sharp breath told me that I had drawn blood.\r\n\r\n\"You use dangerous language, Sir John. You'll be sorry if you go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here,\" I rapped out, in the tone I should have used to an\r\nimpudent office boy, \"please understand that you can't frighten me. I\r\nknow that bounders of your type don't understand a gentleman and how he\r\nfeels about things. I only assure you that you will waste your time. And\r\ntime _ought_\"--I said it with meaning--\"to be worth more to you now than\r\nall the valuables you picked from the pockets of the _Atlantis_\r\npassengers.\"\r\n\r\nHe came up to me, and I thought that this was the moment. But he only\r\ntore the cloth from my head and returned to his chair.\r\n\r\nI looked round with interest. The room, no doubt part of the cavern\r\nsystem into which the mine had penetrated, was matchboarded all round.\r\nThe boarding was painted white, and a cluster of electrics hung from the\r\nceiling. There was a carpet on the floor, a couple of arm-chairs, a\r\nwriting-table, and a big steel safe. In one corner was another door than\r\nthe entrance one, partly concealed by a green curtain hanging from a\r\nbrass rod.\r\n\r\nHelzephron himself sat opposite. The handsome, hawk-like face was badly\r\nbruised. He stared at me with concentrated malignancy. Then he smiled,\r\nwith a flash of large white teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I should hardly have known you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I should have recognized you anywhere, even with the bruises!\" I\r\nreplied. \"Mr. Ashton left you your teeth, I see.\"\r\n\r\nHis face grew dark. He nodded twice. \"I thought that,\" he said, half to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the whole thing, and it was most amusing, Mr. Helzephron. I was\r\nsitting in the smaller arm of the gallery at the 'Mille Colonnes,'\r\nbehind a centre-piece of flowers. I, _and my companion_, had concealed a\r\nperiscope in the flowers, and got the whole thing framed, as it were. It\r\ngave a zest to the Burgundy. But I thought you'd have made a better\r\nfight of it!\"\r\n\r\nThe man leapt from his chair with a savage curse and took two steps\r\ntowards me, with clenched fist and lifted arm.\r\n\r\nI looked up in that convulsed and purple face.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so!\" I said quietly. \"I'm tied up. It's quite safe to hit me.\"\r\n\r\nIf he was going to torture me, and I had few illusions on the matter, I\r\nwas having my innings now. He _had_ been a gentleman once, he had been a\r\nbrave soldier. It was because I knew this that I could stab him.\r\n\r\nHe didn't strike. He began to walk up and down the room, swallowing his\r\nrage with an almost superhuman effort--being what he was. Perhaps shame\r\nhelped him, perhaps it was cunning, but he sat down again, and though he\r\ntrembled, his voice was calm.\r\n\r\n\"So you think me a coward, do you?\" he said. \"I'll do you the justice to\r\nsay that you're none.\"\r\n\r\nMy mind was working with an insight that it has never possessed before\r\nor since. The key to the man's psychology was in my hand at last.\r\n\r\nAll criminals are vain. In great criminals vanity assumes colossal\r\nproportions until it becomes a real madness. Criminologists call it\r\nmegalomania. It is egotism fostered and indulged to the point of\r\nmonstrosity, when all moral considerations are swept away, and the\r\nsubject thinks himself superior to all law, and glories in his\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n_Lord of himself, that heritage of woe!_ I think Byron said that.\r\n\r\n\"You've correctly expressed me,\" I told him.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps your detective work has not gone so far as to inform you that I\r\nhold the Victoria Cross?\" Yes! he was mad! No sane man of his extraction\r\nwould have said that.\r\n\r\n\"It is a distinction above all others, Mr. Helzephron. And you'll have\r\nanother very soon. Indeed, you'll never be forgotten. You'll be historic\r\nas the one V.C. who was degraded. They'll do it the day before they hang\r\nyou at Pentonville, and it will be in the _Gazette_.\"\r\n\r\nHe grew quite white, whether from anger or shame I do not know. But I\r\nwent on. Something inside me that was not myself seemed to be speaking.\r\n\r\n\"You've been living quite an artificial life, you see, surrounded by\r\nyour amicable young friends and the artistic Mr. Vargus. You, no doubt,\r\nthink of yourself as of a very glorious order. Making war on society,\r\nAjax defying the thunder, King of the air, and all that sort of thing.\r\nI'll bet anything you've compared yourself to Napoleon a thousand\r\ntimes! It's the way the late Kaiser of Germany fell. It's called\r\nmegalomania. But you aren't anything of the sort, you know. You are a\r\ncowardly thief, who steals and murders for the sake of his pocket. You\r\nasked me a question and I've answered it.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard each word. His eyes became glassy and his jaw dropped. For all\r\nthe world he was like an evil child who hears the truth about itself,\r\nand all the power was wiped out of his face as chalk marks are wiped off\r\na blackboard.\r\n\r\nHe got up abruptly, and left the room by the curtained door. He was away\r\nfor ten minutes. When he returned he was his old self, but with an\r\naddition--he had been drinking back his devilishness. There was a strong\r\nodour of brandy as he entered. His eyes were full and liquid, and he was\r\namazingly vital. I knew that I could hurt him no longer. He wore\r\nimpenetrable armour. He sat down and lit a cigarette. He smiled with an\r\nevil good-humour. It was his hour now.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've got acquainted at last,\" he began in an easy conversational\r\ntone. \"You've been excessively clever in hunting me down, and your\r\npowers of insult are exceptional. I admit again that you have smoked me\r\nout here, but as to putting an end to my activities, that's a very\r\ndifferent story. Your people can't get at me once I'm out of this snug\r\nretreat, and they can't force an entry here until I'm gone. So much as\r\nbetween the Commissioner of Police and the Pirate. You've had your say\r\nand I've had mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is nothing more to be said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, as man to man, there's a good deal. I purchased an evening\r\npaper on the afternoon of the evening when I was attacked by your hired\r\nbully.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the conversation was growing interesting.\r\n\r\n\"With stolen money?\" I asked impudently. But it fell dead flat. I don't\r\nthink he even heard me.\r\n\r\n\"The paper made public some news that I had already gathered from\r\nanother source. The news of your engagement, Sir John Custance.\"\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other in dead silence for half a minute.\r\n\r\n\"To Miss Constance Shepherd,\" he went on.\r\n\r\nI said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"... Who at this moment is not twenty yards away from you, and who will\r\nfly with me to-night to where all your police boats will never find us.\"\r\n\r\n\"By force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, up to the present I admit that I have had to take the law into my\r\nown hands. I am a man who believes in getting what he wants. Your\r\narrival, the fact that you're my guest for a short time, has given my\r\nthoughts quite a new direction.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that there was a deep and sinister meaning in what he said, but\r\nnot an inkling of the abominable truth came to me. He understood that\r\nfrom my face, and he laughed out loud.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is going to be enormously refreshing!\" he cried. \"This is\r\ngoing to make everything worth while!\"\r\n\r\nMy heart turned to stone as I watched that unholy merriment.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished laughing, he said: \"Miss Shepherd does not know as\r\nyet that I have the honour of entertaining you. I am about to inform\r\nher. And then, if she wishes it, as no doubt she will, you must really\r\nmeet. Journeys end in lovers' meetings, they say.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to add something when there was a knock at the door. Mr.\r\nVargus came in.\r\n\r\n\"All loaded,\" he said, looking nervously at me, as if wondering what had\r\npassed during his absence. \"All loaded and everything ready for a start.\r\nThe others have gone up to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's nothing to report, or they would have telephoned down.\r\nThere is no hurry for an hour yet....\"\r\n\r\nHelzephron took the short man by the arm and drew him into a corner of\r\nthe room. They whispered together for nearly ten minutes. I could not\r\ncatch a word.\r\n\r\nThen Vargus nodded with an air of triumphant comprehension, and left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"On second thoughts,\" said Helzephron, \"I am not going to prepare Miss\r\nShepherd. We will let it be in the nature of a pleasant surprise.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared through the green-curtained door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLED OUT TO DIE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn relating what is immediately to follow I shall do so with as plain\r\nand unvarnished a narrative as my pen can command. You will read of what\r\nConstance and I endured, but do not ask me to do more than hint at the\r\nanger of my soul. It is impossible to describe, at least it would\r\nrequire the pen of a Dante or a Milton, nor would I describe it if I\r\ncould. It is bad enough to live that hour again even faintly and in\r\nimagination. To call it up into full memory--soul memory--is a task for\r\nwhich I have not the least inclination. You shall, therefore, have the\r\nfacts with very little comment upon them.\r\n\r\nI think it's about all you'll need.\r\n\r\nHelzephron was away for a considerable time. During his absence Vargus\r\npeeped in once and looked at me. I won't describe his face.\r\n\r\nWhen the hawk-faced man returned, he dragged my chair to the far end of\r\nthe room, and pushed the writing-table in front of it to form a\r\nbarrier. There was a deliberation in all he did that was inexpressibly\r\nalarming. His lips were drawn in a tight smile, so that I could see the\r\nteeth....\r\n\r\nHe set a chair over against the wall opposite, and then he went again\r\nthrough the curtained door. A moment afterwards he entered, followed by\r\nConnie.\r\n\r\nThe room grew whirlingly dark and cleared. I could not speak, for my\r\nthroat seemed to be closing up, but I saw my girl very distinctly.\r\n\r\nShe was, as I had never seen her, deadly pale, with large, dark rings\r\nunder her eyes and all the joy of life ironed out of her sweet face. Yet\r\nshe was not thinner and there were no lines. The colour had gone from\r\nher cheeks and the lustre from her hair, but I somehow thought that her\r\nphysical health had not suffered alarmingly.\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke I knew that this was true, and I knew why. Her\r\nindomitable spirit remained. The sunny courage of the past had condensed\r\nwithin her soul and turned to unconquerable purpose. Her voice was so\r\nfull of scorn that it cut even me like the lash of a whip. It was a\r\nmarvel that the tall man could have borne it for a moment.\r\n\r\nBut his eyes had a red light in them, like the eyes of a hound--mad.\r\n\r\n\"What new devilry is this?\" the girl said, as her eyes fell upon me,\r\ntrussed up there behind the table. \"Do you suppose that I want any\r\nfurther evidence to tell me from where you come and whom you serve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at this gentleman; look at him well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another of your unhappy prisoners! So you add torture to your crimes.\r\nAnd you dare to make me witness it!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned in a fury of disgust and loathing, and made a step towards\r\nthe door. But before she moved further--God bless her!--she said: \"You\r\nhave fallen into the hands of a very horrid scoundrel, sir, but ...\"\r\n\r\nAt that I managed to cry out: \"Connie, dearest, don't you know me?\"\r\n\r\nI ought not to have been so sudden. I cursed myself for it. It was just\r\nas if I had struck her down, for she reeled, and fell into the chair in\r\na swoon.\r\n\r\nI myself was near to it. There was a rush as of cataracts, a sensation\r\nof drowning. When I recovered, the maid, Wilson, was ministering to her\r\nmistress; there was a sound of pouring liquid, though I could see\r\nnothing, for Helzephron stood directly in front of me, watching what\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Helzephron,\" I said hoarsely. \"This _can't_ go on. For God's\r\nsake stop it! Get her away before she recovers and do what you like to\r\nme.\" I thought desperately for something that would move him.\r\n\r\nHe turned round slowly. \"Too late now,\" he said slowly. \"You've got to\r\ngo through with it, both of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe malice had faded out of his eyes. He spoke dreamily: \"There is no\r\nother way....\"\r\n\r\nHe moved away and leant against the wall at the side, looking down\r\nmoodily at Constance, who was coming to herself. Her eyes opened, and\r\nHelzephron made an impatient gesture with his arm. The maid, Wilson,\r\nvanished like a ghost. I could see that she, poor thing, went in\r\nterrible fear.\r\n\r\nI spoke out directly I thought Connie could understand. I was\r\ndesperately determined to have my say. It might be the last chance. To\r\nmy surprise, though I soon understood the reason, Helzephron did not\r\ninterrupt.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I, Constance. I'm disguised; that is why you didn't know me.\r\nDarling, it's going to be all right. Be brave a little longer!\"\r\n\r\nI saw comprehension dawn in her eyes, and then they blazed out into\r\nlove. \"John! You've come at last. It's been weary waiting. But you are\r\ntied up.\" Her voice changed. \"You're in the power of this man, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"For this moment I may be; but that is nothing. He is tracked down and\r\nhis hour has come. He knows it. I made a mistake and he captured me, but\r\noutside the forces are converging, and for him the whole world is now\r\nno wider than this little room.\"\r\n\r\nHelzephron made no sign. From his great height he stared down at us like\r\na stone figure. I doubt if he either saw or heard.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me quickly--he has not ill-used you, he has not laid hands on you,\r\nhurt you....\"\r\n\r\nA bitter laugh burst from her. \"He has stolen me away from life and kept\r\nme here a prisoner. But there has been food to eat, and the cage is\r\ngilded with the proceeds of his thefts. He knows well enough that if he\r\ndared to touch me I should kill myself. No power on earth and none of\r\nhis cunning precautions could prevent it, and that also he knows. Thank\r\nGod his time has come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me everything, quickly. A lot depends on it.\" How could I explain\r\nthat he was going to kill me, that he could and would do so long before\r\nthere was any chance of help arriving?\r\n\r\n\"He has dared,\" she said, and I never knew that a woman's voice could be\r\nso hard, \"dared to offer me what he calls love. The word is hideous in\r\nsuch a mouth. He has raved, threatened and implored me to--to marry\r\nhim--to fly away with him and be his wife.\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered terribly and sank back in the chair, as if exhausted. I\r\nracked my brains for words. What could I say or do? That she would kill\r\nherself rather than yield an inch I was certain. But he could still\r\nprolong her torture. The chances were that he would get away in his\r\nmarvellous ship for a time. On the other hand, it might well be that the\r\nsearching airships were in such force by now that even the Pirate Ship\r\ncould not escape. There would be a battle in the air. She would be shot\r\nto pieces by our cruisers' heavy guns. And Connie would be on board....\r\n\r\nWhat could I say?\r\n\r\nHelzephron stood up from the wall. With slow movements he lit a\r\ncigarette, but his hand was trembling as if in a palsy. He spoke to\r\nConstance.\r\n\r\n\"You have already told me that you love Sir John Custance,\" he said. \"I\r\nheard that from your own lips two days ago. But 'love' means many\r\nthings. And you may well have said it to keep me at arm's length. Sir\r\nJohn Custance is here now, and in my power. What of him and you?\"\r\n\r\nConnie looked at him for a moment without a word. There was not a trace\r\nof fear in her eyes. \"I will tell you,\" she said at length. \"That man is\r\nmy man, and I am his woman from now until the end of time and for all\r\neternity. You cannot understand, I know. But if words have meaning, mine\r\nare plain enough.\"\r\n\r\nHelzephron suddenly threw away his cigarette and gave what seemed to be\r\na sigh of relief. The sound, the gesture, were startling. I could not\r\nunderstand....\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"that is another, and the last, illusion gone. My life\r\nhas been a succession of lost illusions, I think. I loved you, and I\r\nlove you still, with all the force and power of a nature which, whatever\r\nelse it may be, is stronger than that of most men in this feeble world.\r\nI would have given you a love so rich, abundant and wonderful that you\r\nwould have forgotten your passion for this man. Mine would have consumed\r\nit utterly. And you would have responded. You think not, but I know\r\nbetter. It would have been flame and flame, LOVE. Now I see that it is\r\nindeed too late.\"\r\n\r\nHis tones were not raised; there was nothing particularly eloquent in\r\nthe actual words he spoke. But to me they tolled like a great bell--a\r\nbell that tolls while the iron gates of hell are opening slowly....\r\n\r\n\"Yes, too late!\" Connie said quickly. \"And you see it now! It could\r\nnever have been. And now you will let us go! Oh, be quick! Untie John,\r\nplease do; it must be hurting him so!\"\r\n\r\nFor the first and last time that night two tears rolled down my cheeks.\r\n\r\nI suppose that for a brief space there had been some lingering nobility\r\nin Helzephron's mind, some flicker of life in that dark soul. The man\r\nhad not always been under the dominion of evil.\r\n\r\nBut now I saw, without possibility of mistake, the final eclipse of\r\ngood. It was a visible thing, the last awful act in the terrible drama\r\nof his life, and it took place before one's eyes like crystals\r\ndissolving in a glass.\r\n\r\nHe looked steadfastly at Constance.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John can go,\" he said, \"for all the debt of ill-will I owe him, he\r\ncan go from here unharmed. My dear girl, it rests entirely with you!\"\r\n\r\nShe did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then let him go now, at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"That man,\" he answered, \"lives, or dies a peculiarly unpleasant death;\r\ngoes free, or is nothing but a heap of clothes in half an hour, as you\r\nshall decide, Constance.\"\r\n\r\nBy the slow dilation of her eyes, I think she knew what he would say.\r\n\r\n\"It is like this,\" he went on. \"If I cannot have Love, the real thing,\r\nat least Fate has put it in my power to demand--and have!--the second\r\nbest, the semblance of it. The moment that you give me your solemn\r\npromise to marry me, Sir John walks out on to the moor.\"\r\n\r\nI gave Constance one swift, warning look. Would the man believe that\r\nanother was as base as he himself? Everything depended on that.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot do it, Constance,\" I said, with a careful tremor in my\r\nvoice, trying to suggest a slight dawn of hope, and again I sent her a\r\nsignal of caution.\r\n\r\nHelzephron gave an almost imperceptible start, and a faint smile began\r\nto play about his cruel lips.\r\n\r\nThe fish was rising.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a martyrdom,\" I went on. \"What is my life worth--even to\r\nthe State\"--I thought that was a clever touch--\"in exchange for such a\r\nsacrifice?\"\r\n\r\nPraise God for her quick wits! She saw that I was acting, and fell into\r\nher part with supreme naturalness. A wail of pain came from her, and she\r\ncovered her face with her hands. \"I cannot let you die,\" she cried. \"Do\r\nI not love you? Is not your life of supreme value?\"\r\n\r\nI spoke in a tone of hardly veiled eagerness: \"But your own happiness,\r\nwhat of that?\"\r\n\r\nConnie made a passionate gesture of renunciation. She turned to our\r\ntorturer. \"Sir,\" she said, \"have you no mercy, no compassion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing but one overmastering need.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then leave us. Let me be alone with Sir John for a few minutes.\" She\r\nbeckoned to him and he came, leaning his head low.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" she whispered. \"I cannot persuade him while you are here. Leave us\r\nalone and I will do my best.\"\r\n\r\nThe fool was wax in her hands. That one confidential whisper seemed to\r\nhave transformed him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll go,\" he said, but I heard every word. \"I don't think our\r\nfriend will take much persuading! You may be glad to marry a _man_,\r\nafter all!\"\r\n\r\nHe was half-way to the door when suspicion took hold of him. \"How do I\r\nknow that you won't be up to some trick?\" he snarled; \"try to loose him\r\nor something? Not that there would be any chance of escape if you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word of honour,\" Connie answered, \"or you can tie me up,\r\ntoo. That would be the best way. Fasten me in this chair so that I can't\r\nmove.\"\r\n\r\nHelzephron shook his head impatiently. Then the door banged and we were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI began to speak at once. There was no time to waste.\r\n\r\n\"Dearest love of my heart, it is good-bye. We have managed to snatch\r\nthese few moments for farewell.\"\r\n\r\nHer face shone with love and courage as she smiled at me. \"Is there no\r\nway, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. This is the end. We have fooled that devil for a minute. When he\r\nreturns and finds out the end will come quickly. Now, listen....\"\r\n\r\nIn a few sentences I told her exactly how matters stood, and of my\r\ncertainty that Helzephron's course was almost run. Nor did I disguise\r\nfrom her that in any attack upon the Pirate Ship her own fate was sure.\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter? I should kill myself, anyhow, rather than submit\r\nto one touch from him. I have the means ready. Oh, my love, I am prouder\r\nof you at this moment than I ever was!\"\r\n\r\nHow I rejoiced in her! Never for a single instant had she believed that\r\nI would let her do this thing. It was not even spoken of between us. It\r\nwas worth while dying for love and trust like this!\r\n\r\n\"And you see, dear love,\" she went on, \"it will not be long. We shall be\r\ntogether again in a few hours, never to part any more....\"\r\n\r\nVery solemnly and quietly we said farewell. Neither of us was unhappy. A\r\ngreat exaltation and peace consoled us, but the moment is too sacred for\r\ndescription here.\r\n\r\nI gave one last look at her serene and radiant face, striving to image\r\nit upon my brain, so that it should be the last thing I saw, and then I\r\ncalled for Helzephron with a strong voice.\r\n\r\nFrom the first instant that he stepped into the room and saw our faces,\r\nhe knew the truth.\r\n\r\nHe was very quiet, but his eyes shone again with the dull red light that\r\nyou may sometimes see in a dog's eyes. One could almost have pitied him,\r\nfor he was as one who desired even one drop of living water to cool his\r\ntongue and was tormented in a flame.\r\n\r\nI was praying hard for one boon--that Constance should not see me die.\r\nIt seemed that my prayer was answered, for he led her roughly to the\r\ncurtained door and pushed her through.\r\n\r\nHe whistled, and Vargus came in through the other door. The movements of\r\nboth men were detached and business-like. I had the odd fancy that this\r\nwas exactly how the paid executioner goes about his work in the prisons.\r\n\r\nOnce more the cloth was tied over my head, the chair was lifted, and I\r\nwas carried away. The swinging motion lasted a long time. I must have\r\nbeen taken a considerable distance from the room of my agony when the\r\nchair was finally set down. I heard the plangent beating of waves and\r\nfelt cool airs. I was in the central cavern once more, and near to the\r\nmouth of it. So that was it! They were going to throw me to the\r\nwhirlpools and the rocks below!...\r\n\r\nI felt strong and slender fingers about my neck--Vargus the\r\npianist!--and shuddered at the contact. The cloth was removed. It was as\r\nI thought: all round was the cathedral-like cave, but now dozens of\r\nlights were turned on, including a great blue arc-lamp suspended from\r\nthe roof, and all the shadows and mystery were gone.\r\n\r\nNot far away, resting upon rubber-covered wheels, which were dropped\r\nbelow the floats by an adaptation of the Raynor-Wallis patent, was the\r\ngreat Pirate Ship, towering up under the domed roof, spreading her great\r\nplanes from side to side, lovely in her lines, an awful instrument of\r\npower. Even at that supreme moment I longed to examine her, to go aboard\r\nand make acquaintance with the wonders she held.\r\n\r\nThe ruling passion of a man's life dies hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE HOUNDS FROM THIBET AND MR. VARGUS; WITH A DISCOVERY ON BOARD THE\r\nPIRATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThey turned my chair so that I faced the mouth of the cave, which was\r\nsome thirty yards away. The moon had set. The short summer night was\r\nover, and the first grey hint of the dawn, that I should never see, was\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nHelzephron sat down on a stool a few yards away from me. His back was to\r\nthe cavern mouth. He spoke a word to Vargus, who padded away behind me.\r\n\r\n\"Why are we waiting?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Because you had the misfortune to hear my friend Vargus pouring his\r\nsoul out at the piano, Sir John.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am still rather in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection to satisfying a curiosity which is legitimate under\r\nthe circumstances. I was going to put a pistol to your ear and throw you\r\ninto the cove. But Mr. Vargus has fantastic tastes, and you have put his\r\nback up. He asked me a favour, and as I owe him a good deal, I could\r\nnot refuse it. But I see he is returning. You shall have a concrete\r\nexplanation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom, somewhere behind me I heard the padding of footsteps, accompanied\r\nby a curious scuffling noise and the sound of heavy breathing. Then\r\nHelzephron gave a short bark of laughter, and Vargus came round the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nThen I knew.\r\n\r\nOn leather leashes Vargus held two monstrous dogs. Each one was as big\r\nas a newly-born calf. They were like Newfoundlands, and yet unlike, for\r\nthere was a great bull-dog jowl to each....\r\n\r\n\"My Tibetan mastiffs,\" said Helzephron. \"Death by dogs for a dog!\"\r\n\r\nVargus brought the brutes within two yards of me. Their teeth were\r\nbared, their hackles rose, there was the dull red light in their eyes,\r\ntoo, but not a sound came from either.\r\n\r\nBoth men watched me intently, but they got none of the satisfaction that\r\nthey hoped. It was simply that the bitterness of death was over. That\r\nwas all. Fear was something that I was no longer capable of feeling. To\r\nbe worried to death by mastiffs was just like any other death, then. I\r\nunderstood how it was that martyrs for religion, or any cause in which\r\nthey believed, died so quietly.\r\n\r\nHelzephron cursed deeply. \"Get it over,\" he said. \"Take the dogs to the\r\nfar end of the cave. When I blow this whistle let them go. You'll hear\r\nthem running up behind you, Sir John,\" he said, with an insane chuckle.\r\n\r\nVargus disappeared.\r\n\r\nI stared out at the cave mouth. Each moment it grew lighter. I thought\r\nthat I should have liked to have seen one more summer dawn. But\r\nHelzephron was lifting his whistle; and then the mouth of the cave\r\nseemed to recede and shrink to the size of a mere window.\r\n\r\nA mere window. With idle curiosity I saw how a fat spider was slowly\r\ndescending his swinging thread, and I was a child again, seated at the\r\nnursery window....\r\n\r\nThe whistle blew a shrill, echoing blast.\r\n\r\nAt once my mind awoke to full consciousness, and I braced myself to die\r\nwithout a cry. The cave mouth became itself again, and the spider ...\r\n\r\n_Hanging by one arm and a leg, half-way down a stout rope, was a short,\r\nthick-set figure...._\r\n\r\nAs the rapid thud of the racing dogs grew loud the figure's right arm\r\nraised itself.\r\n\r\n_Bang! Crash! Bang! Crash!_ a wild howl of pain, thunderous echoes\r\nrolling down the cavern, and Helzephron on his feet in time to see\r\nsomething bounding towards him like an india-rubber ball.\r\n\r\nI knew who that was. I had one glimpse of a terrible grinning face as\r\nDanjuro leapt at the hawk-faced man; heard a strangled scream and a\r\nlong, crunching crack, and saw two whirling figures crash to the floor.\r\n\r\nI can't express the suddenness of it all. Before my brain could register\r\nthe impression, another person was sprinting by me, yelling like a\r\nfiend. Then Danjuro rose from the floor--alone--and my ropes were being\r\ndivided, my stiff limbs rubbed, and a calm, exultant voice remarked:\r\n\"Exit Honourable Helzephron.\"\r\n\r\nI began to laugh weakly.\r\n\r\n\"You were just in time, Danjuro. Have you killed him?\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to reply when there was a diversion.\r\n\r\nCharles Thumbwood appeared. He had Mr. Vargus by the collar, and was\r\nkicking him along to the accompaniment of flowers of language that I\r\nshall not attempt to reproduce.\r\n\r\n\"Caught 'im at the telephone,\" gasped Charles. \"Gr-r-r, you little\r\nswine\"--a furious kick--\"Gr-r-r, you slime-lapping leper you! 'E was\r\ntelephoning to 'is friends, Sir John. Thank Gawd we come in time, Sir\r\nJohn! Gr-r-r, there's one as you won't forget in an 'urry!\" and lifting\r\nMr. Vargus several inches from the floor with a final kick, Little\r\nThumbwood flung him away, began to feel me all over with trembling\r\nhands, and burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nBut I had caught his words. The telephone! We should have all the band\r\nupon us in two minutes, desperate and fighting for their lives.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" I shouted, \"follow me. We must get Miss Shepherd safe. There\r\nisn't a moment to lose.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know how I did it, and the first few yards were like running on\r\nred-hot ploughshares; but I got going, and raced down the great cave,\r\npast the Pirate Ship, to the door at the end.\r\n\r\nI noticed a door on the left as I ran. It was the one by which I had\r\nfirst entered, the one that marked the passage leading to the lift.\r\n\r\n\"Block that somehow!\" I called to Thumbwood. \"It may keep them back for\r\na minute or two. Shoot anyone who breaks through.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood and stopped at once. I saw him dragging up some cases to\r\nmake cover and lying down behind them, as I turned just outside the door\r\nwhich led to the ante-room to Helzephron's private sanctum.\r\n\r\n... We found Constance upon her knees in a richly furnished room. Her\r\nmaid, Wilson, was weeping and trembling in a corner. As we burst in she\r\nshrieked with terror.\r\n\r\nBut Constance fainted dead away.\r\n\r\nI took that unfortunate woman, Wilson, and shook her into sanity. There\r\nwas nothing else to be done, and I remember that it seemed quite\r\nnatural and obvious at the time. I knew that we hadn't a moment to lose,\r\nand I was in a state of abnormal excitement.\r\n\r\nWhen she had regained some sort of control, which was in less than a\r\nminute, I ordered her to attend to Constance, and, when she came to\r\nherself, to tell her that we were all saved and Helzephron as powerless.\r\nThen I hurried out into the cave.\r\n\r\nDanjuro and Thumbwood were working like demons. Piles of boxes and other\r\nimpedimenta had been erected in two strategic positions commanding the\r\ndoor. Behind each pile were two or three automatic rifles and many clips\r\nof ammunition. Just as I came up Danjuro went to the door and opened it\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nI grasped his idea at once. As you may remember from my former\r\ndescription, the passage was a mere cleft in the rock. Certainly not\r\nmore than one man could walk abreast, and he could be shot down the\r\nmoment he turned the corner. A child who could shoot straight would have\r\nbeen able to hold the passage, and behind the barrier on the floor of\r\nthe cave would have been safe enough.\r\n\r\n\"I trust honourable lady quite safe?\" said Danjuro in his quiet, silky\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the maid's attending to her. Thank God that unutterable scoundrel\r\nhas not harmed her.\"\r\n\r\nThen I remembered something. Danjuro's face was perfectly placid and\r\nordinary. The grinning devil-mask had vanished as if it had never been.\r\nTo look at him no one would have guessed that he was anything but a\r\npeaceable little Eastern student, such as you may see by the dozen any\r\nday round about the Law Courts in town. He rolled a cigarette in his\r\nconjuring way as I spoke, and yet, a few moments ago those slender hands\r\nhad just broken the neck of the Master Criminal of Europe!\r\n\r\n\"Look here, old chap,\" I said. \"I haven't had a moment to thank you. You\r\nand Charles arrived in the very nick of time. A few seconds more and I\r\nshould have been done for; and as for Miss Shepherd ...\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't go on. I just held out my hand.\r\n\r\nHe didn't take it--cold-blooded little beggar! He just bowed politely\r\nand murmured something that sounded like \"Glad to be of any help!\" Then\r\nhe brightened up. \"I think, Sir John,\" he said, \"that we can reckon\r\nourselves as quite safe from any intrusion now!\" and he waved his hand\r\ntowards the open door.\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em all come!\" remarked Thumbwood.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, the floor of the cave seemed to heave up and down.\r\nThe great arc lights which made it as bright as day began to wheel round\r\nlike fireworks, and I fainted for the second time.\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered it was to find myself in the late Helzephron's own\r\nroom. Something cold was on my forehead and something chilly and scented\r\ntrickled down my face. I opened my eyes, and Constance was kneeling by\r\nmy side.\r\n\r\n\"My love, my dear love!\" she whispered. \"I never thought that I should\r\nsee you alive again. Oh, thank God, thank God!\"\r\n\r\nThen her arms were round me, and for a long time we spoke no word. I\r\nthink I know what the man who was called back from death in Palestine\r\nlong ago must have felt....\r\n\r\nShe gave me food and wine, and at last, though I felt physically weak\r\nand shaken, my mind worked again, and I stood up. We were alone in the\r\nroom, and no sound came from outside, so I concluded that all was safe\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\n\"A little Japanese carried you in here,\" Connie said, \"as easily as if\r\nyou were a child. I had just come to myself, and I thought, oh, John, I\r\nthought that you had been killed, and that he was one of those awful\r\npeople. But he shouted out at once that what Wilson said was true and we\r\nwere saved. I believed him, in spite of the shock his appearance gave me\r\nat first, and when he had put you down gently in this chair he hurried\r\naway. John, who is he, and how are we saved?\"\r\n\r\n\"We owe everything to him,\" I answered gravely. \"He killed Helzephron\r\nwith his own hands\"--I did not tell her about the dogs just then--\"and\r\nin a few hours we shall be back in the world. We can never, as long as\r\nwe live, pay our debt to Danjuro.\"\r\n\r\nIn as short a time as I could, I explained everything to her, from the\r\nfirst moment when I had heard of her capture until now. I walked about\r\nthe room as I did so, and new life flowed into my cramped limbs. When I\r\nhad smoked a cigarette, I felt almost normal again.\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear,\" I said, when my story was over, \"we aren't exactly out of\r\nthe wood yet, though there's nothing whatever to be alarmed at. Go into\r\nyour own room and collect your things together; whatever you want to\r\ntake away with you. Stay here with Wilson till I come again. I may be\r\nsome time. There are a good many things to straighten out.\"\r\n\r\nOne more embrace and I left her, sobbing with great happiness, and,\r\npassing through the ante-room, hurried out into the great cave.\r\n\r\nMy first glance was towards the door of the rock passage leading to the\r\nlift. It was still open. Sitting on the barrier twelve yards or so away\r\nwas Thumbwood. A rifle lay across his knees and he was placidly smoking\r\nhis pipe.\r\n\r\n\"All right?\" I shouted.\r\n\r\n\"All O.K., Sir John,\" he answered, standing up.\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign of anyone. As a matter of fact, Mr. Danjuro and me have\r\nascertained that this 'ere dog-fancier 'adn't time to get through to his\r\nfriends upstairs. I got 'old of 'im just as he was topping the fence.\"\r\n\r\nI followed his glance, and I saw Mr. Vargus, trussed like a fowl, on the\r\nfloor a yard or two away.\r\n\r\nI had quite forgotten that ingenious and artistic person, and I started.\r\nHe was a sorry sight enough, dirty, blood-stained and horrible, as his\r\npale, wicked face stared up at me. He said nothing, and I shuddered as I\r\nlooked at him--shuddered as I had never done at Helzephron.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Mr. Danjuro?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Up at the mouth of the cave, Sir John. I was to send you to him\r\ndirectly you came.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, turned, and began to walk up the great cave. The Pirate\r\nAirship lay there, gleaming and wonderful. There was a light steel\r\nladder at her side as I passed, leading up into the fuselage, and it was\r\nonly by a strong effort of will that I could keep myself from mounting\r\nit and exploring the mechanical marvels that I knew she contained.\r\nHowever, I resisted the temptation and hurried on. The lights depending\r\nfrom the roof grew dimmer each moment as I drew near the curving\r\nentrance. \"It must be full day outside,\" I thought, as the fresh sea-air\r\ncame to meet me, and then, as I turned round the bend, I saw the squat,\r\nblack figure of the Japanese silhouetted against the rosy fires of\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nDanjuro was standing motionless. He was looking down at some humped\r\nobjects upon the ground. The rope, like a wisp of spider's web, swung\r\ngently to and fro. There was not a sound save the soft murmur of the sea\r\nfar down below.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right now,\" I said, and he turned to me without a start, though\r\nhe could not have heard me coming.\r\n\r\nHis face was calm, but wrinkled up in every direction. He looked like a\r\nman of immense age, and his narrow eyes were full of brooding, sombre\r\nlight. Almost at his feet lay the body of Helzephron. It had been\r\ndecently disposed with the hands upon the breast, and the morning light\r\nplayed over the hawk-like, bronzed face and open eyes in which there was\r\nnow no cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe dead man was august as he lay there. There was a certain nobility\r\nabout the features. He did not look like a scoundrel, and all resentment\r\nand hate passed away from me for ever as I looked at him.\r\n\r\nThe two huge dogs, one with a bullet through its brain, the other shot\r\nin the chest and through the heart as it was in the act of leaping, were\r\nhideous objects....\r\n\r\nWhen I looked up again the wrinkles had gone from Danjuro's face, the\r\nsombre expression from his eyes. It was a magical change, but I was long\r\npast wonder at anything in connection with him.\r\n\r\n\"We will have those dogs skinned,\" he remarked in his ordinary voice.\r\n\"They will make a fine rug for your house, Sir John.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt; but we've got to get out of this first. Remember that there\r\nare a dozen desperate scoundrels not far away. And I don't see either\r\nMiss Shepherd or myself returning to the world up that rope! By the way,\r\nI haven't heard how you managed to get here in time.\"\r\n\r\nHe told me the story shortly enough. There was not an unnecessary detail\r\nand no comment whatever. Thumbwood supplied the lacking picturesqueness\r\nsome days later. But even as Danjuro told it, I realized the marvellous\r\nsagacity and contempt of danger that had saved us.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that when he had arrived at Zerran, the idea of a cave, either\r\nnatural or enlarged by pretended mining operations, was already in his\r\nmind. As soon as I had left the inn on my expedition, Danjuro and\r\nThumbwood had taken one of Trewhella's boats and set out eastwards along\r\nthe coast. The Japanese had already taken his bearings, and knew that\r\nTregeraint House would be a little to the left of the jagged peak of\r\nCarne Zerran. They cruised along into the moonlight until they picked up\r\ntheir mark, and not two hundred yards further on struck the entrance to\r\nthe S-shaped cove. Then Danjuro had no longer any doubts. No boat could\r\nlive in that cauldron of the waves, but it seemed a man could, for our\r\nrescuers proved it!\r\n\r\nHe stripped and went in--I learnt afterwards that he was as much at home\r\nin the water as a seal, and, of course, like so many of his countrymen,\r\nhe was simply a mass of steel muscles. In twenty minutes the secret was\r\na secret no longer.\r\n\r\nDanjuro's next move was to row back to Zerran Cove at top speed, and\r\nhasten up the cliff path to the inn. Here he disinterred the coastguard\r\nfrom the pigsty and roused him to immediate action.\r\n\r\nRopes and crowbars were procured, the fenced-off \"dangerous\" area on the\r\ncliff-top invaded, and Danjuro, with Charles, descended in the nick of\r\ntime. But there was more than this. The coastguard had his orders.\r\nDirectly the two men disappeared over the brink he was instructed to\r\nmake all haste to the watch-house, some two miles away in the direction\r\nof St. Ives. From there the Chief Boatswain was to telephone all along\r\nthe coast to the various stations, and also to the police at St. Ives,\r\nCamborne and Penzance.\r\n\r\n\"In three or four hours, perhaps sooner,\" Danjuro concluded, \"an armed\r\nforce should be concentrating on the moors upon the house above. The\r\npirates will be desperate, and will put up a fight--at least, I think\r\nso, but the end is certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meantime, all we can do is to wait here until something happens?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as you please, Sir John,\" he answered, looking at me curiously.\r\n\r\nFor a minute I did not see what he meant, but then a great idea dawned\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\n\"The Pirate Ship!\" I burst out.\r\n\r\n\"I have always heard that Sir John Custance is a skilled pilot,\" he said\r\nwith a bow.\r\n\r\nI saw it all clearly. There was a gorgeous, dramatic end to it all well\r\nwithin my grasp! It would be something to make the whole world gasp! The\r\nPirate Ship was, I knew, already loaded with the proceeds of the\r\npirates' robberies. It was not only full of loot, but prepared in every\r\nway for a long cruise. Helzephron and his ruffians had planned an almost\r\nimmediate escape from the cave to some new refuge of which I had heard\r\nthem speak. Doubtless, if things had gone right with them, they would\r\nhave been off by now, with my mangled body tossed in the whirlpools\r\nbelow and Constance still a prisoner. Helzephron would have mounted to a\r\ngreat height, and trusted to his immense superiority in speed over all\r\nthe airships in existence for escape. I have little doubt that, had\r\nthings fallen out as he planned, he would have been able to carry out\r\nhis scheme. But God disposes....\r\n\r\nThere was nothing, so I thought at the moment, to prevent _me_ from\r\npiloting the airship out of its lair. Once in the sky I could make a\r\nbee-line for Plymouth, and get there in a little more than half an\r\nhour--if it was indeed true that the mysterious ship could do her two\r\nhundred and forty M.P.H. To swoop down to Plymouth sea-drome with\r\nConstance, the Pirate Ship and the recovered treasure! That would,\r\nindeed, be a triumph such as is given to few men to experience. I have a\r\nfairly vivid imagination, and I saw it all in one radiant picture.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and have a look at the ship at once,\" I said, and almost ran\r\nback into the cavern, where she towered up and threw black velvet\r\nshadows in the fierce blue light that streamed down from the suspended\r\narcs. Danjuro followed.\r\n\r\nAs I swung myself over the side and descended a short ladder, I found\r\nmyself in a roomy main cabin. A switch to my hand illuminated it, and\r\neven then I saw that the ship had been designed by a master hand. Below\r\nthe port-holes, filled with toughened glass and provided with shutters\r\nof a design that was new to me, ran a continuous seat of woven camels'\r\nhair cord, easily convertible into sleeping bunks for half a dozen\r\npeople. There was an electric stove of polished aluminium for cooking,\r\nand an electric radiator for warming the cabin, clustering round a\r\ncentral supporting column. I saw also that there was a very complete\r\ntelephone installation connecting this main cabin with the pilot's room\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nUnder the seats was a collection of wooden cases and a box of japanned\r\nsteel, which I judged, and rightly, contained the treasure taken from\r\nthe _Albatros_ and the _Atlantis_. A sliding door aft led into a\r\nstore-room, which seemed to contain everything necessary for a cruise of\r\nseveral days. I noticed boxes of expensive cigars, bottles of whisky and\r\nliqueurs, tinned oysters, larks, asparagus, such as wealthy yachtsmen\r\nprovide themselves with. The dogs did themselves well!\r\n\r\nLeading out of this was a final cabin fitted with tools of every sort, a\r\nrack of automatic rifles and pistols, and several thousand rounds of\r\nsmall-arms ammunition. Here also, with a padded door, was a little\r\ncompartment for the wireless operator, and I pictured one of the\r\nblack-hearted scoundrels sitting there and picking up the messages from\r\nairships of the trade routes with a grin upon his face.\r\n\r\nDanjuro came with me and looked about him quickly, but with no change of\r\nexpression. \"So far, so good,\" I said to him; \"but all this is\r\nunimportant, really, though it is very complete. What really matters is\r\nthe pilot's cabin, the engines, controlling gear, petrol supply, and so\r\non. Let's go forward. Do you understand anything about airships?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very little, Sir John,\" he replied, and--so petty are we all at\r\ntimes--I felt a perceptible thrill of pleasure at hearing there was at\r\nleast something of which this paragon was ignorant.\r\n\r\n\"Never had occasion to study them?\" I asked, as we passed again through\r\nthe main cabin.\r\n\r\n\"I have watched the pilot in Honourable Van Adams' yacht the _May\r\nFlower_, but that is all....\"\r\n\r\nI hardly heard him, for I was in the pilot's room at last.\r\n\r\nI saw at a glance that here were a number of things absolutely new to\r\nme, and so to all the aviators of the world. I am not going to be\r\ntechnical. This narrative is written for the general reader, and my\r\nexpert conclusions have been published elsewhere. I can but indicate\r\nsome of the wonders of mechanical skill with which I was confronted.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the designer of the ship was the first man to solve the\r\nproblem of easy control. Up to the present all pilots had controlled\r\ntheir ships--the movements of planes and rudders, etc.--with a certain\r\namount of manual labour. It is true that recent inventions had minimized\r\nthis; ball-bearings, the rack and pinion, had made the main control\r\nlevers and wheels much easier to move than they were in the old days of\r\nthe Great War--when flying first began to come into its own. But there\r\nwas still a great deal of physical strain, which greatly lessened\r\nefficiency upon a long cruise. Moreover, the instant decision necessary\r\nto be taken by an aviator--when a fraction of a second may spell safety\r\nor ruin--had been always hampered by the comparative mechanical slowness\r\nof control.\r\n\r\nIn the Pirate Ship this disability did not exist. Just as the largest\r\nocean-going liner--sea-ship, not airship, I mean--can be steered by a\r\nwheel not more than two feet in diameter by the invention of the steam\r\nsteering gear, so the Pirate Ship was controlled by a series of little\r\nwheels and levers, covered with leather, that looked like toys.\r\n\r\nElectricity had been brought into play, and a touch of the pilot's hand\r\nwas magnified into power that in an instant would deflect a mighty\r\nlifting plane or vast rudder.\r\n\r\nThe fuel capacity of the ship was immense. She carried as much petrol,\r\nin the huge and ingeniously contrived tanks below the fuselage, as one\r\nof the great air-liners, though she was not a fifth of the size. I saw\r\nat once that she could keep the air for days.\r\n\r\nExamining the cockpit, in which two quick-firing guns were placed, I\r\nfound them both of the very latest pattern, and mounted with a swivel\r\ndevice that was far in advance of anything attempted hitherto. Only the\r\ngreat battle-planes of the world's air navies could mount guns of such\r\npower, and she could circle round them with ease while in full flight.\r\n\r\nBut it was when I mounted to the little deck above, and began to examine\r\nthe two huge six-cylinder engines, that my admiration and interest grew\r\nbeyond all bounds. The chief triumph of all, the silencing mechanism\r\nthat reduced the ordinary roar of air engines to no more than the hum of\r\na dynamo, did not at once become clear. It would have been necessary to\r\ntake the machines to pieces to have discovered everything; but an\r\nexamination of the exhausts put me on the track, and I marvelled at the\r\ncreation of a master-mind.\r\n\r\nI was looking at the twin propellers, which had a curve that was new to\r\nme, and even material that I could not immediately define, when Danjuro\r\nhailed me from the pilot's room.\r\n\r\nI tumbled down to find the little man bending over the various controls\r\nranged in front of the pilot's seat.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, Sir John,\" he said, \"pray correct me if I am wrong,\r\nthat there is something wanting here. I know little about airships, but\r\nsomething of electricity, and can quite understand this system. But it\r\nseems to me that a key-part of the mechanism has been removed.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled over a lever a few inches long. Its movement should have been\r\nregistered upon a dial above, but the needle never moved.\r\n\r\n\"Do that again!\" I cried, and, mounting a step, put my head into the\r\nlittle dome of glass in the cabin roof which commanded the whole length\r\nof the ship. One of the tilting planes by the rudder should have moved\r\nwhen the lever was pulled over.\r\n\r\nIt remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\"One of the honourable gentlemen upstairs has got a small but very\r\nessential piece of linking apparatus in his pocket,\" said Danjuro.\r\n\r\nIt was only too true. A moment's reflection satisfied me of that, and I\r\nstared blankly at my companion.\r\n\r\nMy gorgeous, if somewhat vainglorious, plan was knocked on the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE MOMENT OF TRIUMPH\r\n\r\n\r\nI descended from the airship in silence. Danjuro followed me. Thumbwood\r\nwas still on guard. The bundle that was Mr. Vargus lay upon the ground,\r\nand a face like a white wedge of venom stared up at us. There was no\r\nsign of the enemy, but I felt that we should not be left in peace much\r\nlonger, and my disappointment at the discovery on board the pirate was\r\nkeen.\r\n\r\n\"There is still a chance,\" Danjuro whispered in my ear. \"And with your\r\npermission, Sir John, I am going to try it.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, and he stepped up to Vargus and pulled him up into a sitting\r\nposture, propping him against the barrier.\r\n\r\n\"There is a part of the control mechanism of the airship missing,\"\r\nDanjuro said, with silky politeness.\r\n\r\nVargus grinned suddenly, a momentary rictus that came and went, utterly\r\nhorrible.\r\n\r\n\"And we want that piece of the machine,\" the Japanese went on.\r\n\r\nVargus spoke, in his peculiar oily voice. \"Then you may go on wanting,\r\nyou putty-faced little spawn of a monkey.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot hope to describe the depth of poisonous hate the man put into\r\nthe words. His accent was cultured and refined; the great dome of the\r\nblood-stained forehead spoke loudly of intellect, yet the voice somehow\r\nreeked of the pit. I know that it struck me cold, and I saw the rifle in\r\nThumbwood's hands was shaking. Although this was the man who had devised\r\nan abominable death for me, I can honestly say that I felt no personal\r\nresentment. I can't account for it, but it was so.\r\n\r\nI should have welcomed that, rather than the inward loathing, like a\r\nshudder of the soul, at something inhuman and unclean.\r\n\r\nWhat Danjuro felt I don't know, but he didn't turn a hair.\r\n\r\n\"I think you will assist us,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor answer the thing below spat in his face.\r\n\r\nI expected to see Danjuro leap upon him and strangle him where he sat. I\r\nshouldn't have raised a finger to stop it. But it was not so. The little\r\nman stepped aside and carefully wiped his face with a silk handkerchief\r\nthat seemed to come from nowhere. Then he went behind Mr. Vargus and\r\nbegan to feel his head all over, with quick, delicate movements of his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"How can you touch him?\" I cried, hardly knowing what I said, for the\r\nthing was ugly and uncanny beyond belief. Danjuro was like some sinister\r\nphrenologist in a nightmare, feeling the bumps of a devil.\r\n\r\n\"I know now what I wanted to know about him,\" Danjuro purred after a\r\nmoment. \"I never doubted the intelligence, Sir John. It is very marked.\r\nAnd there is great energy and courage of a sort. But our friend who\r\nspits has one little failing. He is afraid of physical pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to ...?\"\r\n\r\nDanjuro looked me full in the eyes, and in his I saw a stony resolution\r\nthat I was in no state to combat.\r\n\r\n\"I will go and see Miss Shepherd,\" I said, and turning on my heel,\r\nwalked quickly to the inner end of the cavern. As I went I heard Danjuro\r\nask Thumbwood for a box of matches....\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that there are lots of softhearted people who will say\r\nI ought never to have allowed Danjuro to do what he did. Well, they must\r\nhave their own opinion, that's all. I believe it was nothing like so bad\r\nas the cat-o'-nine-tails which is constantly administered in our\r\nprisons, and under the circumstances I think it was justifiable. Call me\r\nwhat names you like as you read this--you have not seen Mr. Vargus and\r\nhis dogs, nor spent a small eternity in the pirates' cave.\r\n\r\n... Constance was wonderfully recovered. I spent a minute or two with\r\nher, and then returned to the scene of action.\r\n\r\nMr. Vargus was speaking in a quick, panting voice, and these were the\r\nwords I heard:\r\n\r\n\"Gascoigne, Mr. Gascoigne; he has it. He was our second pilot. It was\r\nalways in his charge.\"\r\n\r\nDanjuro gave his little weary smile. Then he put his hand gently upon my\r\narm and drew me away to the other side of the cave.\r\n\r\n\"We will now summon honourable Gascoigne,\" he said. \"He is the young\r\ngentleman we saw with late honourable Helzephron at the 'Mille\r\nColonnes.' The little necessary piece of the mechanism in his possession\r\nis, I have just learnt, generally referred to as 'the link.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But how ...?\" I was beginning, when he pointed to a telephone\r\ninstrument upon a screen of tongue-and-groove boarding. \"This\r\ncommunicates with the house,\" he whispered. \"Mr. Vargus nearly got\r\nthrough recently, you will remember, just before the good Thumbwood\r\ncaught him.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised the instrument to his mouth and ear.\r\n\r\nIn a second or two a bell rang and Danjuro began to speak. I nearly\r\njumped out of my boots. The words were simple enough, but the voice\r\nwith its oily refinement was the voice of Mr. Vargus!\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Gascoigne? Yes, Vargus speaking. The Chief says you are to\r\ncome down at once and bring the control link with you. What? No, the\r\nothers are to wait till they're sent for. What? Oh, yes, quite dead. I\r\nwish you could have seen it!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a triumph of mimicry that I shall never forget, the more so as it\r\nwas the only occasion on which I heard this marvellous man attempt\r\nanything of the sort. Heaven knows what other talents he must have\r\npossessed!\r\n\r\n\"The young gentleman was asking about you, Sir John. He seemed quite\r\ncurious about your end!\"\r\n\r\nI smiled grimly. \"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nIn answer he hurried back to the open door and crouched down in the\r\nshadow by its side. I motioned to Thumbwood to lie down behind the\r\nbarrier which was exactly facing the passage, and drawing my automatic\r\npistol, which I had regained from Helzephron's room, I retired to the\r\nopposite side of the door and outside the line of direct vision.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a minute or so, and then, far away in the rock, I\r\nheard a hollow rumble and the clank of a gate. The lift had descended\r\nand Gascoigne was on his way. A few seconds afterwards I heard a merry\r\nwhistle, fresh and sweet, as if the performer had not a care in the\r\nworld. He was whistling the lilting tune of a popular song which all the\r\nstreet boys were singing at that time:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Merry Maudie met her fate at Margate!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCallous young dog! In a moment he would not be so cheerful....\r\n\r\nI had left it to that concentrated muscle, Danjuro, though I stood ready\r\nto help if necessary. But I knew that he was a supreme exponent of\r\njiu-jitsu--_teste_ the hideous death Helzephron died--and I had little\r\nfear. Indeed, I found myself looking on with a detached and interested\r\ncuriosity as one might at a prize-fight. I wondered if Danjuro would\r\nkill him or not. And if you had supped so full of horrors as I had in\r\nthat awful cave, you'd have felt like that, too!\r\n\r\n... For a second I saw Gascoigne in the full light from the roof and\r\nframed by the archway, like a picture. It was the same young fellow,\r\nwith the dissipated face, that I had seen at the restaurant, though he\r\nhad not been among the singing pirates at the inn. He was extremely\r\nhandsome still, with the face of a lost angel. As a boy at school he\r\nmust have been beautiful.\r\n\r\nThen the squat shadow that crouched by the lintel of the door, like a\r\nmonstrous toad, expanded swiftly. Danjuro caught Gascoigne by the right\r\nhand with the speed of lightning, and pulled the arm out straight with a\r\njerk. Then, as the young man was falling forward, the left arm of the\r\nJapanese shot out _under_ his captive's rigid right and the hand seized\r\nthe lapel of Gascoigne's coat. He was powerless. If he made the\r\nslightest movement Danjuro would have broken his arm like a pipe-stem.\r\nHe could not swing round and hit with his left, and I saw his mouth open\r\nwith foolish amazement like the mouth of a fish, as his legs were kicked\r\nfrom under him, and he fell back with his assailant on the top of him.\r\n\r\nI tied his ankles together with neatness and dispatch, while I listened\r\nto a sickening flood of blasphemous profanity that flowed from the\r\nclear-cut lips of this _ci-devant_ gentleman in a ceaseless stream. More\r\nand more I realized what a crew of utter devils Helzephron had got round\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt last he was bound, and Danjuro took from him a leather box, which he\r\nwore suspended round his shoulders by a strap. He handed it to me, and,\r\nopening it, I found it was the control link that we sought.\r\n\r\n\"You can fit that in all right, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I don't think it presents any difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, in a few minutes we will start; that is, if you think\r\nyou can take the ship out of this place?\"\r\n\r\nI had already considered that and decided that I could. It was a\r\nticklish job enough, and would require the most delicate care,\r\nespecially with an untried ship. But in the past I had landed on the\r\ndeck of a moving battleship, and there were few stunts that were not\r\nfamiliar to me. I felt I could do it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I shall let you down,\" I said, and hurried to the ship.\r\n\r\nFive minutes showed me that I had got the hang of the apparatus and that\r\nelectrical connection was restored, and I spent a further ten in\r\nthoroughly examining and getting accustomed to the controls. Moreover, I\r\nmade one new and startling discovery.\r\n\r\nThere was no need, in this marvellous ship, for mechanics to swing the\r\npropeller at the start. Again electricity from the ship's dynamo was\r\nemployed, and the starting device was a miracle of ingenuity, worked\r\nfrom the pilot's cabin.\r\n\r\nMr. Vargus, though I offered to loosen his bonds at the feet, absolutely\r\nrefused to walk, and Danjuro carried him up the ladder and threw him\r\nupon the floor of the cabin like a sack of corn. Gascoigne, now very\r\nwhite and silent, was more amenable. It seems that Vargus had\r\nacquainted him with everything that had passed as they lay together on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go all right, sir,\" he said to me, as I helped him to his feet.\r\n\r\nAs I had the muzzle of my pistol in the small of his back, he couldn't\r\nwell do anything else, but he lost nothing by being civil.\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe that the Chief's dead and everything's finished,\" he\r\nsaid, with a curious sort of sob. I realized that all sense of right and\r\nwrong had left this youth early. He was the true stuff of which\r\ncriminals are made, incapable of putting himself in the place of his\r\nvictims, and while bitterly conscious of defeat and punishment to come,\r\nincapable of remorse.\r\n\r\nWithout a trace of pose this man behaved just as if he were an officer\r\ncaptured by the enemy in war-time, and I dare swear he felt just like\r\nthat. There is only one thing to do with these abnormals that get\r\nthemselves born now and then--destroy them.\r\n\r\nMorally I felt sure that Gascoigne was not a hundredth part so\r\nresponsible as Vargus. But one was born a criminal, and, from that point\r\nof view, insane. The other had had the capabilities of sainthood, but\r\nhad opened his soul to the Dweller on the Threshold and was doubly lost.\r\n\r\nWe went slowly towards the ship. \"Good old bird!\" he said, as any public\r\nschoolboy might have said it. \"I expect this'll be the last cruise I\r\never take in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in any ship at all,\" I answered. \"I suppose you've no illusions as\r\nto what's in store for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose it's a hanging job,\" he replied, and I assented, though,\r\nas you will learn, both his anticipations were to prove wrong.\r\n\r\nDanjuro and I shifted Vargus out of the main cabin into the small one\r\nwhere the tools and spare parts were stored. We didn't want Constance to\r\nsee him, and he was so well secured that he couldn't possibly do any\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nGascoigne we left for the present on one of the seats, and I hurried to\r\nfetch the two women, passing Thumbwood, still at his post.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is arranged,\" I called out, as I ran through Helzephron's\r\nroom. \"We are going to fly to Plymouth at once in the Pirate Ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid Wilson shrieked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sir John, that awful ship! I couldn't go in 'er again, not for my\r\nlife. Let's go in a taxi, Miss, please 'ave a taxi; I couldn't face the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll lose your life quickly enough if you stay,\" I said to the\r\nyelping fool, though, Heaven knows, the poor soul had gone through\r\nenough to turn her mind entirely. Her mouth grew like a round O, and I\r\nwas preparing for another shriek when I suddenly thought of something.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Connie will be quite safe with me,\" I said quickly, \"and I shall\r\nput you in charge of Charles Thumbwood. You remember him? He'll look\r\nafter you all right, Wilson.\"\r\n\r\nIt acted like a charm. I had remembered Charles's attention to the\r\npretty maid in the train.\r\n\r\n\"Ow!\" said Wilson. \"Is Mr. Thumbwood here, then, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so. You will be his especial charge, and the journey won't\r\ntake more than three-quarters of an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl picked up the dressing-bag, which she had dropped upon the\r\nfloor. \"Then that will be all right,\" she said with a flush, and I\r\nwondered if she thought Charles was going to pilot the ship himself. How\r\ntrue it is that Faith can move mountains! No doubt Constance felt just\r\nthe same about me as Mary Wilson did about Charles.\r\n\r\n... We had come out into the cave, and had walked a few yards towards\r\nthe looming bulk of the ship, when the telephone bell on the cave-side\r\nahead of us rang furiously. It kept on like an alarm-clock, and telling\r\nthe girls to remain still for a moment, I ran up and unhooked the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nA voice was bawling at the other end, so loud that the words rang and\r\nbuzzed one into the other, and I could only distinguish one or two. I\r\nheard enough to know what had happened, though.\r\n\r\n\"Chief ... coastguard police ... rifles ... all round the house on the\r\nmoor were coming down ... two of us stay ... hold till last moment....\"\r\n\r\nSo that was it! Billy Pengelly, the coastguard, had made good. The wires\r\nhad been at work while we had been about our mole-like warfare\r\nunderground. The avengers were among the gorse and heather, and the\r\nremainder of the pirates were doomed....\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" I shouted to Connie, realizing that there was literally not a\r\nmoment to lose, and, alarmed by the excitement in my voice, they started\r\nto run.\r\n\r\nWhen they had come up to me, and I started to run with them towards the\r\nship, there was a sudden thunderous report. Looking to the right, I saw\r\nthat Thumbwood had taken cover, and was lying on his stomach behind the\r\nbarrier. The open door was but a dim oblong of yellow light at that\r\ndistance, and I could not see a yard down the passage in the rocks.\r\n\r\nThumbwood fired again, and the echoing roar had not died away when\r\nsomething went by my ear with a vicious _zipp_, and I heard the splash\r\nof a bullet upon the granite.\r\n\r\nThe pirates were coming down in force, and, finding themselves between\r\nScylla and Charybdis, had turned at bay.\r\n\r\nI knew Thumbwood would keep them where they were for a minute or two,\r\nand I raced to the ship with Connie at my side. Wilson had fainted, and\r\nwe had to drag her between us.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the light, steep accommodation ladder Danjuro was waiting,\r\nperfectly calm and unconcerned. We handed up the unconscious maid, and\r\nhe disappeared with her in a second. Then Connie was helped up the\r\nladder, while the whole cavern began to thunder with a fusillade of\r\nrapid firing.\r\n\r\n\"The police and coastguards are surrounding the house,\" I shouted, \"and\r\nthe rest of the crew have come down, and are trying to fight their way\r\ninto the cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is what I thought, Sir John. Those gentlemen must be considerably\r\nsurprised at their reception! We can shoot them all down before they get\r\nout of the passage. Perhaps, now that rescue is at hand, we had better\r\nwait and do so?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were glistening; I saw the light of slaughter in them. For an\r\ninstant I hesitated. What he said was sane enough. The risk was\r\ncomparatively small; it would only be postponing the triumphal flight.\r\n\r\nThen I took a decision--it rested with me, and I was alone responsible.\r\n\"We mustn't shoot them all down,\" I shouted through the din, for bullets\r\nwere streaming into the cave behind as though they were pumped from a\r\nhose. \"Some of them must be brought to justice. We had better be off\r\nand leave the coastguards and police to deal with them.\"\r\n\r\nThus I spoke. I said what I honestly thought was best at the moment,\r\nthough perhaps my mind was a little influenced by the natural and\r\nterrible anxiety to get my girl away from further horrors.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I decided, and all my life long I shall never cease to\r\nregret it.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Danjuro. \"Up into the pilot's cabin, quick, Sir John.\r\nYou are indispensable there. Prepare for an instant start. I will run\r\nand fetch Thumbwood. We shall have to fire thirty or forty rounds\r\nquickly into the passage to keep them back. Of course, they are firing\r\nautomatic pistols round the bend now, and not exposing themselves any\r\nmore. After we have fired we shall run for the ship. You will hear me\r\nshout and then start like lightning!\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped past me, and, crouching almost to the ground, ran back\r\ntowards Thumbwood like some great cat.\r\n\r\nI flung myself aboard. Constance was attending to Wilson in the main\r\ncabin. Gascoigne was lying bound where he had been thrown, but his eyes\r\nwere blazing with excitement.\r\n\r\nI put a stop to that at once. \"The remainder of your friends are being\r\nshot down,\" I said curtly. \"Lucky for you to be here.\"\r\n\r\nAll the animation died out of his face. And, as I didn't want to leave\r\nhim alone with Connie--it seemed a desecration that he should be in the\r\nsame place with her even for a moment--I whipped out my knife, cut the\r\nbonds at his feet, and pushed him into the pilot's cabin, making him lie\r\nupon the floor at my side as I got into the swivel chair. I could shoot\r\nhim dead in an instant if he moved.\r\n\r\nThen I sat rigid, with my hand upon the switch which started the\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nIn reality, I know now that the time of waiting was very short, but it\r\nseemed an eternity to me. For the first time my nerves felt upon the\r\npoint of giving way. My hand trembled. I began to think of the narrow\r\nS-shaped passage between high walls of rock to the sea, and realized the\r\nappalling nature of the task before me. A mere touch of the planes upon\r\nthose iron barriers, and all the long struggle would prove unavailing,\r\nthe triumph turn to a defeat in which my girl and I, the superman\r\nDanjuro, and faithful Thumbwood would lose our hard-won lives.\r\n\r\nOne touch and the ship would crumple up like paper and fall like a stone\r\ninto the cruel cauldron of jagged rock and furious waves far below.\r\n\r\nThere came a voice from the floor. Had the prisoner divined something of\r\nmy thoughts?\r\n\r\n\"... Look here, Sir John, you're up against a nasty job. It's the very\r\ndevil getting out of here if you don't know the way and haven't\r\npractised it.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in the young fellow's voice told me that this was not mockery.\r\nHe was, moreover, the second pilot of the Pirate Ship, trained by\r\nHelzephron himself.\r\n\r\n\"I did not ask you to speak,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"No, but really it's no end of a stunt. The controls are ten times as\r\nsensitive as in an ordinary machine. If you were the best pilot living,\r\nyou'd find it hard to manage in a ship that's quite new to you, and has\r\nall sorts of habits and tricks that no other has.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly enough, and I knew it, but it was none the less\r\nunpleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you're afraid for your damned skin,\" I sneered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, draw it mild,\" he replied. \"I only spoke to try and help you.\r\nI know when I'm beaten, and I don't bear any malice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I do take you safely out, it will only mean the gallows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, it won't!\" he said. \"I shall turn King's evidence. There are\r\nlots of things I know that no one else except Vargus knows now. I shall\r\nget let off with fifteen years. Bet you a fiver, if you like. It's to my\r\ninterest to help you out.\"\r\n\r\nI can generally tell when a man is sincere, and I realized that this\r\nyoung scoundrel was, despite--and perhaps because of--the baseness of\r\nhis motive.\r\n\r\n\"Help me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, out of the passage. Once you get in clear air you'll fly her\r\neasily enough--and you'll be astonished, by Jove! But you'd better let\r\nme pilot you. It's the lift and the sharp right bank that are so\r\ndifficult....\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Stand there!\" He leaned against the wall at my side, his hands tied\r\nbehind him and his arms tightly bound.\r\n\r\nHe was about to speak, when suddenly we both started. Something had\r\nhappened. For a moment I did not realize what it was. Then I knew. The\r\ncontinuous thunder of rifle fire had stopped. Everything was dead\r\nsilent. I'd hardly become conscious of the fact when there was a loud\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n\"Let her go, Sir John! Let her go!\"\r\n\r\nDanjuro stumbled into the cabin, panting like a whippet.\r\n\r\nI pulled over the switch and then the lever of the starting mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strangely-shaped propellers bit the air at once, the walls of the\r\ncavern, flooded with spectral light, slid backwards, and as the ship\r\nswerved round the curve towards the entrance, the day leapt at us.\r\n\r\nWow! but it was touch and go during the next ten seconds. If it had not\r\nbeen for Gascoigne I am sure that I should never have gone through. The\r\ngreat ship shot out of its lair like a dart; a touch upon the little\r\nsteering-wheel and she was banking in the terrible right-hand turn; the\r\ngranite walls seemed rushing to meet and crush her, and only the quick,\r\nsteady words of command from the prisoner, which like an automaton I\r\nobeyed, got her finally into the straight....\r\n\r\nAnd then--oh, then--I opened out the marvellous engines; she seemed to\r\nshake herself for an instant like a bird poised for a long flight, and,\r\nhumming like a wasp, she shot up and out to sea....\r\n\r\nThe needle upon the speed indicator quivered round its dial, moving\r\never upwards. Eighty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty--and thirty\r\nmore--we were doing nearly two hundred miles an hour, straight out over\r\nthe Atlantic before I had a thought of our destination, or of anything\r\nbut the supreme glory of that rush up the dawn wind.\r\n\r\nThe whole morning world was blue and gold, new-built and beautiful. Far\r\nbelow, the Mother of Oceans lay in an unwrinkled sheet of sapphire, \"as\r\nit were a sea of glass mingled with fire.\" A tiny purple cloud upon the\r\nhorizon was the Isles of Scilly, sleeping under the sun.\r\n\r\nConnie stole in and stood by my side, her hand upon my shoulder, and I\r\nknew that her heart also was full to overflowing, as memory flared up\r\nand down in us like the flame of a lamp in a draught. It was a moment so\r\nexquisite, so full of gratitude to God, that no words of mine can do\r\nmore than hint at it. For we had escaped from hell and the snare of\r\ndevils, and knew it in one lightning flash of gratitude and joy.\r\n\r\nAs she stared out at the sea and sky, which glowed like the pavements of\r\nthe New Jerusalem, Connie quoted some words from Milton--the song of the\r\nreleased spirit in his epilogue of \"Comus\":\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"To the Ocean now I fly,\r\n     And those happy climes which lie\r\n     Where Day never shuts his eye\r\n     Up in the broad fields of the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, as I glanced at the compass card and made a great sweep\r\nround, so that we faced the jagged coasts of Cornwall once again, she\r\nwhispered, with a proud note in her voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"For still the Lord is Lord of Might\r\n     In deeds, in deeds, he takes delight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, with a tiny pressure of my arm, she went back to the other cabin.\r\n\r\nI had not noticed Danjuro for the last few minutes. He had led Gascoigne\r\nbehind me as soon as we had made the passage. Now he reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Danjuro!\" I cried, \"this ship is wonderful beyond all imagining! There\r\nisn't her equal in the whole world. She'll revolutionize flying. It's a\r\nperfect joy to pilot her!\"\r\n\r\nDanjuro nodded calmly; he was not given to enthusiasms, this man with a\r\npanther in his soul. \"I have been speaking with the prisoner,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"With Vargus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, though I have been to look at him, and he is quite safe. With\r\nGascoigne, and he has suggested something that has not occurred to\r\neither of us, Sir John.\"\r\n\r\n\"His help will all tell in his favour when it comes to the trial. What\r\nis it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something eminently sensible and pressing! As you see, this ship is\r\nquite unmistakable. Any pilot would recognize her from the descriptions\r\nwhich have been circulated. We are now approaching the coast again and\r\nabout to fly to Plymouth. The air must be full of armed patrol ships,\r\nand, whatever our speed, if we escape being shot down _en route_, we\r\nshould certainly be blown to pieces on approaching the sea-drome!\"\r\n\r\nI flushed up. I had been an incredible ass never to have thought of that\r\nbefore. It was only too true. Nobody could possibly know that we had\r\ncaptured the Pirate Ship....\r\n\r\nI reduced our speed to half of what it had been. \"What are we to do?\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"There is a complete wireless installation on board the ship. Can you\r\noperate it, Sir John?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Even if I could leave the controls, that would be impossible. I\r\nknow nothing about it, unfortunately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, Sir John. It is a gap in my knowledge that I propose to remedy\r\nshortly. But this Gascoigne is an operator, and offers to send any\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we can trust him? He certainly saved us from disaster coming\r\nout of the cavern.\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered; I did not want to think of that blood-stained hole of\r\nhorror any more.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think he can he trusted. He has everything to gain, and can do\r\nno harm that I can see. I cannot operate the keys of the apparatus, but\r\nI know the Morse code, and if I stand by him I can check each letter as\r\nhe sends it out.\"\r\n\r\nThen I had an inspiration too. \"Good! And now I think I can make it\r\nquite sure. I can remember the private code of the Air Police with\r\nhardly a gap. We will call up Plymouth, and all the police boats now\r\nflying, in that private code. Meanwhile, we had better run out to sea\r\nagain while you are taking it down.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I turned the ship, and as we spiralled up and out again, I formed\r\nthe message in my mind and translated it, word for word, into the\r\nletters of the code, which Danjuro took down in pencil upon a sheet of\r\nhis pocket-book.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, and as the message was necessarily rather a long\r\none it took some time, Danjuro marched Gascoigne away to the rear cabin,\r\nwhere Vargus was lying. It was there, you may remember, that the\r\nwireless apparatus was installed.\r\n\r\nWe were now reaching a great height, far above any of the regular\r\nair-lanes, and I felt quite secure from any attack. Land, sea, every\r\nreminder of the world below, had vanished utterly. With hardly a sound\r\nfrom the magic engines we floated in a haze of gold chrysophrase. It was\r\nlike a happy dream, though never was dream so beautiful.\r\n\r\nConnie stole in again. \"I thought I would leave Thumbwood and Wilson\r\nalone,\" she said. \"They have been sitting side by side and whispering\r\nto each other ever since we started. Neither of them seems to have the\r\nleast curiosity as to where we are or where we're going.\"\r\n\r\n\"How thoughtful of you, dearest! Was that the only reason you came in\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the conversation is not a part of this story. It lasted a\r\nlong time as we droned round great five-mile circles of the upper air.\r\nAnd then a telephone rang at my ear.\r\n\r\nDanjuro was speaking. The message had been received at Plymouth, and an\r\nanswer had been coming through for the last ten minutes. He was writing\r\nit down, letter by letter, from Gascoigne's dictation. Shortly\r\nafterwards he brought it in to me, and as I read it off the world closed\r\nround me again and fairyland vanished.\r\n\r\nTriumph filled my veins and reddened my blood. The message came from\r\nMuir Lockhart, who was at Plymouth again, and was one shout of wonder\r\nand congratulation. \"The whole world will thank you,\" it concluded.\r\n\r\nFor a little time I was intoxicated by that message. I saw myself a\r\nhero, vindicated a thousand times in the eyes of all men, the Chief of\r\nAir Police whose name would be historical. I think there are few men of\r\nmy age who would not have had their moment of vainglory; we are made so.\r\nBut as I read the message to the man who had brought it, I realized\r\nthat I had done nothing, after all, and that everything was due to his\r\nmarvellous brilliancy and courage.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven that I realized it without a pang of envy, and I told him\r\nwhat I thought of him in no unstinted way.\r\n\r\nHe heard me to the end with no change of countenance. When I had done,\r\nhe said: \"You have been very kind, Sir John, and I greatly appreciate\r\nwhat you have said. If, indeed, you are indebted to me in any way for\r\nthe help I have been able to give, you can repay me, if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the half of my kingdom!\" I said, with a laugh, though I was in dead\r\nearnest all the same.\r\n\r\n\"That is a promise, Sir John?\" He looked down at me with magnetic eyes.\r\n\r\n\"A promise, Danjuro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, while I live, I ask you to say nothing whatever of my part in\r\nthis affair. I wish it kept as secret as possible; some little part must\r\nleak out; there will be investigations, public trials, and so forth. But\r\nmuch can be kept secret, and it rests with you and Thumbwood. And as I\r\nhave your promise, my mind is at rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is madness, Danjuro! You are owed the thanks of two\r\ncontinents. You ...\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\"I want nothing of the sort. I have had your thanks, and that is\r\nsufficient. The work itself is enough. My usefulness to Mr. Van Adams,\r\nthe endeavour of my whole life, would be destroyed if anything were\r\nknown.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly I promised. \"But Mr. Van Adams, I shall tell _him_\r\neverything!\" I said.\r\n\r\nDanjuro bowed his head. A faint flush came into his yellow face. \"If you\r\nthink I have done anything worth it,\" he replied, with a curious and\r\ntouching silence.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the man with the panther in his soul! For the American\r\nmillionaire he had supreme love, with devotion--worship--and for no one\r\nand nothing else on earth above or below it.\r\n\r\nA man with a single obsession, a man of one idea. Well, most of the\r\ngreat men in life have been that....\r\n\r\nI steered for Plymouth at full speed, coming down to three thousand\r\nfeet. In a flash the jagged coast, fringed with a thin line of white,\r\ncame clear to view. We sped from the Atlantic, over the narrow peninsula\r\nof land which divides it from the Channel, and then turned east. The\r\nBay, with St. Michael's Mount looking like a tiny white pebble, gave\r\nplace to the long, menacing snout of the Lizard, and, as a few minutes\r\nlater we neared Falmouth, a flight of airships rose from the water of\r\nthat mighty harbour and came up to join us like a flock of gulls, the\r\nbig Klaxon electric horns blaring a welcome. Dead Man's Rock and Gall\r\nIsland, Looe, Mevagissey, Fowey--all slipped away astern, and the bluff\r\noutlines of Rame Head, from which the Devon watchers first signalled the\r\nArmada, came rushing into view. I had been speeding far ahead, turning\r\nback, flying all round the escorting patrol boats, which were doing all\r\nthey knew, letting them see what a wonder had come into our hands, and\r\nrejoicing more and more in the powers of the ship, as I found them one\r\nby one. Now I slowed down, and signalled by horn to the leading vessel\r\nof the flotilla.\r\n\r\nAs we turned and entered Plymouth Sound, the others spread themselves\r\nout in a great wedge, of which I was leader, like a skein of wild geese\r\nupon the wing. A salute of guns boomed out as we flew high on the\r\nBreakwater, and all the bells of Plymouth were ringing as I swooped down\r\ninto the sea-drome.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time, for three-quarters of an hour or more, our two\r\nprisoners had been alone together in the aft cabin, where the tools and\r\nspare parts were stored. Neither I nor Danjuro had given them a further\r\nthought, and it was the one fatal mistake we made upon that morning of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThumbwood had, however, been in to look at them once or twice, and had\r\nseen nothing disturbing. Certainly, when some of my men came to take\r\nthem to the station, they were lying sullen in their bonds, and not\r\nsaying a word to each other of any kind.\r\n\r\nBut by that time the mischief was doubtless done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpace begins to press upon me. There are still two strange and\r\nunforgettable scenes to add to this narrative, further tragedies to set\r\ndown. The last scene of all, which I have called \"The Epilogue,\" was not\r\nwritten for a year after the earlier part of this story, which is now\r\npublished as a whole for the first time. Why this is so will become\r\nclear as you read on, if you care to follow me to the very end.\r\n\r\nBut as I would not weary you, I will only indicate the happenings during\r\nthe rest of that day at Plymouth in the briefest possible fashion. I am\r\nimpatient to bring the story up to the hour of eleven-thirty of the same\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nImmediately we were at rest on the placid waters of the sea-drome, Muir\r\nLockhart, with a strong force of Air Police, came aboard. Constance and\r\nher maid were taken in a motor-boat to one of my patrol ships, which\r\nstarted with them for the Hounslow Aerodrome within half an hour of our\r\narrival. We both of us thought it best that she should proceed to London\r\nimmediately, and going by air in a Government ship, she would escape\r\nall annoyance and publicity.\r\n\r\nAll approach to the sea-drome was barred, and though the Hoe was crowded\r\nwith spectators, none of them could approach anywhere near to us. When I\r\nhad given Lockhart an outline of what had occurred, the two prisoners\r\nwere taken over the pool with a strong guard, and run up in the private\r\nlift to the A.P. station, where there was a strong cell ready to receive\r\nthem. Then I was free to show my colleague, himself an expert airman,\r\nthe wonders of our capture.\r\n\r\nI was doing this--we were in the pilot's cabin--when one of my men came\r\nin and said that a motor-launch had come alongside from the private\r\nair-yacht _May Flower_, which was moored not a hundred yards away. I had\r\nnoticed, when descending, that a magnificent yacht was close by, but I\r\ndid not identify it as Mr. Van Adams' ship. It appeared that he had been\r\nsleeping aboard for the last two or three nights, since he had flown\r\ndown from London for the funeral, and was now alongside.\r\n\r\nVan Adams, of course, was an exception to all ordinary rules, and in a\r\nminute he was shaking hands in the private saloon and betraying a most\r\nlively curiosity as to our adventures. I put Danjuro to satisfy him, and\r\nwhen we had discussed a bottle of Helzephron's champagne, I left a\r\ncouple of trusted men to guard the ship, and went ashore. Danjuro\r\nreturned to the _May Flower_ with his patron.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a whirl of business and excitement, though I\r\nmanaged to get three hours much needed sleep in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWires from the Government, from America, from Royalty, poured in, in a\r\nnever-ceasing stream. There were innumerable officials to see, the\r\ncorrespondents of the great newspapers to satisfy with some sort of\r\nstory--a hundred things to do and arrange for. The whole of England was\r\nin a ferment, and the stone building of the Air Police on the Hoe was,\r\nfor a few hours, the centre of it all. The air was thick with patrol\r\nships, warning off aviators of all kinds from approaching the Pirate\r\nShip, which lay at rest and harmless by the north wall of the pool.\r\n\r\nJust before I retired to rest the news of what was called \"The Battle of\r\nthe Moor\" began to come through. The pirates, seeing their ship gone,\r\nhad rushed up again into the house, and had held it with the courage of\r\ndesperation. Only three of them had survived, and were now locked up in\r\nthe police-station at Penzance.\r\n\r\n... It would take many pages to detail the events of that crowded day,\r\nwhich did not end for me until ten o'clock at night, for I was forced to\r\nattend a congratulatory dinner at the \"Royal.\" Previous to that I had\r\nfound it necessary to summon Danjuro from the _May Flower_, where he had\r\nremained quietly with Mr. Van Adams during the day. It was necessary\r\nthat I should be restored to something like my former self, and only\r\nDanjuro could make me blond again! My moustache, alas! he could not\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\nI had arranged to sleep at the station, where there were several\r\nbedrooms, and about ten-thirty I passed the sentry and entered the\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nPlymouth was now quiet. It was a hot, dark night, with neither moon nor\r\nstars. During the day the weather had changed, and now thunder muttered\r\nfar away at sea and amethyst sheet-lightning flickered upon the horizon.\r\n\r\nNow and again a drop of hot rain fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLAST FLIGHT OF THE PIRATE AIRSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe station superintendent met me in the office, which was brilliantly\r\nlit and cooled by an electric fan.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you're feeling pretty well done, Sir John,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I feel pretty tired, Johnson, I own.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a big thunderstorm coming up, not a doubt of it. The air'll be\r\ncooler afterwards. All the arrangements about the prisoners are made,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nThe staff had been in communication with London all day upon this\r\nmatter, but I had not heard the result. I inquired from the\r\nsuperintendent now.\r\n\r\n\"Our two birds, Sir John, and the three they've got at Penzance are to\r\ntravel to London to-night. They'll be brought up at Bow Street for a\r\nminute or two, and remanded for a week to suit your convenience. The\r\nHome Office will communicate with you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. How are they going?\"\r\n\r\n\"The night mail train leaves Penzance at twelve, and gets here at two.\r\nThe other three will be on board and well guarded. Our prisoners will\r\njoin the train at Mill Bay Station. I've detailed Prosser and Moore to\r\nescort them.\"\r\n\r\n\"See that the men are well armed. How are the prisoners?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very quiet, sir. They seem to realize that it's all up with them.\r\nThey've taken their food all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are both together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir John. You see, we've only the one cell that is absolutely\r\nsafe. But that can't make any difference. A man looks in every\r\nhalf-hour. They can't hear him coming, and he reports that they don't\r\neven talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're not handcuffed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't think it necessary, sir. They will be, and chained\r\ntogether, too, when they leave for the train. We searched them\r\nthoroughly, and took everything they had on them away half an hour after\r\nthey were brought in. Would you like to see them, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, Johnson. I've been a good deal too much in their\r\nsociety during the last day or two. I don't want to look at that Vargus\r\nagain until he's in the dock, and I'm giving evidence against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a wicked-looking customer, if ever I saw one,\" said the\r\ninspector, with a face of disgust. \"Well, good-night, sir, and I hope\r\nyou'll sleep well. I've told the station attendant to have your bath\r\nready at eight. He'll call you then.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Johnson went away, and I was left alone. My head ached, and I\r\nfelt disinclined for sleep at once. I undressed, however, and sat in\r\npyjamas as I smoked a final pipe. There was whisky, soda and a bowl of\r\nice, and I took a peg. I felt singularly low and dispirited. It was, I\r\nsupposed, the inevitable reaction of the nerves after all I had endured,\r\ncombined with the heavy pressure of the atmosphere and the electric\r\ntension of the storm. At any rate, I remember feeling--as everyone does\r\nat times--that the greatest triumphs and successes were worth very\r\nlittle, after all, when once they were achieved. There is bitterness at\r\nthe bottom of every cup--_surgit amari aliquid_--and life was a poor\r\nthing at best. And I fell to reflecting on the evil and misery that can\r\nbe wrought by one man.\r\n\r\nThe gaunt spectre of Hawk Helzephron haunted my mind, and the long row\r\nof dead men that must be laid to his account, the brave fellows of my\r\nown service, the Transatlantic people--to say nothing of the black\r\nscoundrels that he had made and tempted, who had been hurried into\r\neternity with their crimes unrepented....\r\n\r\nIt was a morbid train of thought, but I was worn out, and the dark hour\r\nhad its way with me, until I thought of Connie and her merciful\r\npreservation from harm, my own rescue. Then, rather ashamed of myself, I\r\nmade an effort to banish these gloomy imaginings, said my prayers, and\r\ngot into bed.\r\n\r\nAll the same, as I fell asleep, the stammer of the approaching thunder\r\nand the white glare of lightning, which now and then flashed into the\r\ndarkened room, seemed like the growling of those awful dogs and the\r\nglare of the advancing airship in the cave....\r\n\r\nI think now that I must have had some unconscious premonition of the\r\ntragedy which was racing towards me all the time.\r\n\r\n... I was awakened sharply and suddenly, at first I thought by a flash\r\nof lightning. But it was not so. The electrics had been suddenly turned\r\non, and there were men in uniform round my bed. The wind had risen and\r\nwas whistling outside. A deluge of thunder rain was in progress, and\r\ngreat sheets of water were flung against the window.\r\n\r\nI saw Superintendent Johnson. His face was white as linen.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" I shouted.\r\n\r\nHe shouted in answer, and I heard his voice above the tumult of the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"The prisoners, Sir John,\" he wailed. \"They've got away. They picked\r\nthe lock of the cell somehow, got into the passage, and broke the bars\r\nof the window at the end. We none of us heard a sound!\"\r\n\r\nI leapt out of bed and began to bellow orders for pursuit--until I saw\r\nJohnson's terrified face again, and knew that I had not heard all.\r\n\r\n\"... They got down to the water somehow, sir. They must have climbed\r\ndown the lift rails. _And they swam to the ship...._\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God! _What_ ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their own ship, Sir John. Somehow or other they managed to get on\r\nboard; we've just heard....\"\r\n\r\n\"_Where are they?_\"\r\n\r\n\"They did for the two men on board, and must have managed to start the\r\nengines--_the ship's gone_. The searchlights are all over the pool, and\r\nthere's no trace of her. They were seen, Sir John, I ...\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off short, the words drying up in his mouth. All the other men\r\nshrank together in a frightened group as Danjuro came slowly into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nI have never seen a figure so awe-inspiring, or terrible.\r\n\r\nIn moments of supreme emotion a European grows chalk-white, an Asiatic\r\ngrey.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese was livid grey now, and his face seemed carved with\r\nfantastic gashes--grey rubber slashed with a knife. He was like a man\r\nwho had slept a thousand years and wakened to find himself old, and in\r\nhell.\r\n\r\nHe came slowly up to me, moving like a thing on wheels drawn by a cord,\r\nand when he was close, he spoke.\r\n\r\nI can never recall his voice without an almost physical state of fear.\r\nSuppose that you could go with Dante to that gate over which is written,\r\n\"_Abandon hope all ye who enter here._\" And suppose, as you stood there\r\nand listened, you heard a well-known voice far down, saying, \"I am\r\ntormented in this flame....\"\r\n\r\nWell, Danjuro's voice was like that.\r\n\r\n\"During a lull in the storm,\" he said, as if repeating a lesson, \"I went\r\nup on the deck of the _May Flower_ for a breath of air. Mr. Van Adams\r\naccompanied me. We were looking over the water to the Pirate Ship, when\r\nI saw lights flashing up and down through the portholes of the fuselage.\r\nIt struck me as strange. We wondered what the two men in charge could be\r\ndoing. As we watched, we were just able to distinguish two men coming up\r\non deck. Then there came a vivid flash of lightning, and I saw\r\neverything plainly. The two men were Vargus and Gascoigne, and they were\r\ncarrying the body of a man in uniform, which they lowered into the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nInspector Johnson gave a quick gasp. Danjuro continued:\r\n\r\n\"Without a moment's delay I got a couple of pistols, and Mr. Van Adams\r\nand I jumped into the electric launch, which was moored alongside the\r\n_May Flower_, though on the other side to that which faced the Pirate.\r\nThere was no time to summon help. We shot out into the pool just as the\r\nstorm began again with thunder-claps and a deluge of water. We were\r\nwithin a few yards of the ship and making ready to board her, when Mr.\r\nVan Adams flashed a powerful electric torch, and I saw Vargus with a\r\nknife in his hand hacking at the mooring ropes. At the same time I\r\nnoticed that the lights in the pilot's cabin had been turned on.\r\n\r\n\"I took a snap-shot at Vargus and missed him. Almost simultaneously he\r\nfired directly at the light of the torch which Mr. Van Adams held. The\r\nbullet went through Mr. Van Adams' heart, and he fell back dead in my\r\narms--I was steering the launch. I fired off all the cartridges in my\r\npistol, but the thunder drowned the noise. The Pirate Ship began to\r\nmove. I saw the lights in her side moving along--and then she lifted and\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\nThe awful voice ceased, and all of us in that room stood like waxen\r\nfigures in a show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor three days the Press and public were kept in entire ignorance of\r\nwhat had happened during the storm.\r\n\r\nUpon the fourth, just as I was beginning to think that all my measures\r\nwere in vain and that the Pirate Ship had vanished utterly, the Head\r\nOffice in Whitehall received two long telegrams from the Prefect of\r\nFinistère in France and the Chief of Police of Quimper, the old\r\ncathedral city in Brittany.\r\n\r\nOn one of the wild and lonely Breton moors a goat-herd had discovered\r\nthe wreckage of a large airship. By it was the body of a young man, but\r\nonly one body. The telegrams urgently asked me to come over at once.\r\n\r\nI did so, in my fastest patrol boat. Lying in a wild wilderness of gorse\r\nand heather were the remains of the Pirate Ship. It had been destroyed\r\nbeyond possibility of reconstruction, and destroyed methodically and\r\ndeliberately while at rest upon the ground. There was no doubt about\r\nthat. The body I afterwards saw in the Morgue at Quimper was that of\r\nGascoigne. He had not met his death by any accidental means, but had\r\nbeen stabbed in the back.\r\n\r\nHe must have been dead for quite two days before the goat-herd made his\r\ndiscovery, and of Vargus, living or dead, there was not a trace.\r\n\r\nI was back in London again that night, and just as I was going to bed\r\nin Half Moon Street the bell of the flat rang. Thumbwood went to the\r\ndoor and announced that Mr. Danjuro wished to see me.\r\n\r\nHe was in evening dress, and quite his old self again to outward\r\nappearances, except that his black hair had turned an iron grey.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two we discussed details of the inquest that had been\r\nheld _in camera_ upon poor Van Adams, arrangements made for the trial of\r\nthe three surviving pirates, and so on. Then I told him what I had seen\r\nat Quimper.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Muir Lockhart told me of the telegrams from France,\" he said. \"I\r\ncalled at Whitehall, but you had already started for Quimper, Sir John.\r\nI must apologize for such a late call, but I was anxious to hear your\r\nnews. Now I see my way clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, after your great loss, you will go back to America, or\r\nperhaps Japan, and settle down?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" I continued, \"that if you cared for it, there is a\r\nhighly-paid and important position open to you with the Air Police?\r\nNothing would give me greater pleasure, as you know, than to have you as\r\na colleague.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, Sir John, but I have other work to do. I am a rich man,\r\nbut that only interests me, inasmuch as it is a means to an end. When\r\nthat end is reached ...\"\r\n\r\nHe made a curious gesture with his arm, which I did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what your work is?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Vargus is still alive,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\n\"He will be caught soon. The police of the world are looking for him, if\r\nhe is alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be a long pursuit, Sir John. He has got off with the\r\ntreasure, and I know one or two things about him which are not generally\r\nknown. I do not think that Mr. Vargus will fall into the hands of the\r\npolice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you ...?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my work. I owe the spirit of my patron this man's blood, and I\r\nshall pay the debt. Were he to hide in the depths of the sea, sooner or\r\nlater I shall find him. There is no power strong enough in life to keep\r\nus two apart.\"\r\n\r\nHe had dropped his voice. The words hissed like a knife upon a strop.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you good luck,\" I said at length, and was about to say more, to\r\nexpress my gratitude again, when he cut me short.\r\n\r\n\"I am leaving for Paris in half an hour,\" he said, \"and must bid you\r\nfarewell, Sir John. Convey my humble compliments to Miss Shepherd,\" and\r\nwith a low bow and a frigid handshake he was gone.\r\n\r\nSix weeks afterwards, on the day before my wedding, I received a\r\nmagnificent Japanese vase of the old Satsuma enamel, but the card\r\nenclosed bore no address.\r\n\r\nI did not see this extraordinary being again for nearly two years. Of\r\nthat meeting I shall write in the following short epilogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 19-- I was at Monte Carlo for three weeks, taking a\r\nshort holiday alone, and also looking out for a villa at Roquebrune or\r\nMentone for my wife, who was to come out with the baby as soon as the\r\nhouse had been secured.\r\n\r\nNow and again I went into the \"Rooms\" and staked a louis or two upon an\r\neven chance or a _transversale_ at roulette; but, speaking generally,\r\nthe Casino bored me. The cosmopolitan crowd of smart people--like\r\nchampagne corks floating on a cesspool--the professional gamblers, with\r\ntheir veil of decorous indifference concealing a fierce greed for money\r\nwhich they have not earned--a sprinkling of wood-ash over a glowing\r\nfire--presented little interest, and I much preferred long walks and\r\ndrives in the earthly paradise of Les Alpes Maritimes.\r\n\r\nI stayed at the Métropole Hotel, making it the base of my excursions,\r\nand one evening, after dinner, I paid one of my rare visits to the\r\nCasino. I wandered about the gilded, stuffy saloons, with their\r\nilluminations of oil-lamps--so that no enterprising gentleman may cut\r\nthe electric wires and make off with the money on the tables!--the low\r\nvoices and almost sanctimonious manner of the players, the over-dressed\r\ndemi-mondaines who glide about with their hard, evil eyes. The place was\r\nvery full. All the chairs round the roulette tables were occupied, and\r\npeople were standing behind the chairs as well. As I am tall, I was able\r\nto reach over and place my stakes, and I did so several times. When I\r\nhad lost four louis with monotonous regularity, I decided that it was\r\nnot worth while, and thought I would go and smoke, for, contrary to the\r\nusual pictures in the magazines, smoking is _not_ allowed in the\r\nroulette or trente-et-quarante rooms.\r\n\r\nSo I went out into the Atrium, the great pillared entrance hall, which\r\nlooks like an important provincial corn exchange, and lit a cigarette.\r\nThe place was fairly full of people, walking up and down, or reading the\r\nlatest telegrams, which are fixed up upon a green-baize screen, and I\r\nwas watching them idly when, coming round the corner from the\r\ncloak-room, I saw--Danjuro!\r\n\r\nMy heart gave a sudden leap, the sight of him was so utterly unexpected\r\nand recalled so much. To tell the truth, he seemed to belong to a long\r\npast and forgotten dream, for Connie and I, by mutual consent, hardly\r\never spoke of the days of the pirates.\r\n\r\nDanjuro was about fifteen yards away. I saw his face distinctly, and was\r\ncertain that I was not mistaken. Then he looked up, and I could swear\r\nthat he saw and recognized me.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, he turned and slipped round the corner like a weasel,\r\nand when I got there he had vanished. I made a search, of course, though\r\nI knew how futile it would be if he wished to avoid me, and the result\r\nwas as I expected. There wasn't a trace of him anywhere, and none of the\r\nattendants or door-keepers had seen a Japanese gentleman anywhere.\r\n\r\nI went for a walk on the terrace in the moonlight, and then returned to\r\nthe hotel and sought my bed. For a long time I could not sleep. The\r\nsight of Danjuro had made me restless. A legion of memories trooped\r\nthrough the brain, and curiosity marshalled the procession. What was\r\nthat enigmatic and sinister being doing here? Was he still upon his\r\nruthless quest, moving through the panorama of European life like some\r\nwandering Jew of vengeance? Nothing had ever been heard of Vargus again.\r\nFor my part, I shared the opinion of the police bureaux of the\r\nContinent, that the soft-voiced and malignant scoundrel was dead.\r\n\r\nIt was pathetic to think of Danjuro prowling through life to avenge his\r\npatron, wasting his magnificent powers upon a hopeless quest. Pathetic,\r\nyes--so ran my thoughts--but one can't think of Danjuro as an ordinary\r\nhuman being. He was simply a single idea, clothed in flesh, a marvellous\r\nmachine designed for one operation only, a specialist so perfect that he\r\nbecame a monomaniac.\r\n\r\nPoor Van Adams, to protect and serve him had been Danjuro's whole life.\r\nEvery faculty of mind and body had been devoted to that one end. And yet\r\nhe must have loved the American to have served him so? And if he could\r\nlove he was human!\r\n\r\nI wrestled with the problem till dawn, and got no nearer a solution. I\r\nknew that, despite our companionship in peril and the extraordinary\r\nadventures we had gone through together, if Van Adams had lived and for\r\nany reason had told Danjuro to put me out of the way, the little man\r\nwould have executed the job with neatness, dispatch, and an entire\r\nabsence of compunction.\r\n\r\nI decided that Danjuro, as a subject of psychological analysis, was\r\nquite beyond me, and did my best to forget the incident. With an effort\r\nI managed to do so, and got a few hours' sleep before Thumbwood called\r\nme. I said nothing to him of having seen Danjuro, for he also is\r\nunwilling to talk much of the days of terror--perhaps because his wife,\r\nWilson, that was, and is still, Connie's handmaid--so strenuously\r\nobjects to it.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past eleven I left the hotel and strolled to the foot of the\r\nfunicular railway which hauls one up from the narrow ledge of land on\r\nwhich Monte Carlo stands to the heights of La Turbie. I designed to\r\nlunch at the excellent hotel at the top in the clear mountain air, and\r\nthen to walk along the Upper Corniche towards Roquebrune, Eze, and the\r\nmountains above Mentone. There is much to explore in these high\r\nregions--ruins of Roman and medieval forts, built as a defence against\r\nthe raiding Moors of the Mediterranean, and here and there delightful\r\nvillas among pine-woods and olive groves, far from the haunts of men.\r\n\r\nIt was a house of this description, a mountain hermitage, that I wished\r\nto find and take for six months. I knew that they were occasionally to\r\nbe let, but somewhat difficult to come across upon the books of the\r\nagents. In Monte Carlo I had been assured that personal exploration was\r\nthe best and quickest way.\r\n\r\nI lunched at La Turbie on a magnificent _bouillabaisse_ and\r\n_riz-de-veau_, and after an interval set out upon my walk. It was a\r\nmagnificent afternoon, the air golden clear. Far away out to sea Corsica\r\nlay like a dim cloud. The mountain side fell in terrace after terrace\r\nof olives to groups of painted houses looking like toys. Away to the\r\nright were the red roofs and gleaming white buildings of the Monte Carlo\r\npalaces, and the promontory of the Tête du Chien was perfectly outlined\r\nin the azure of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I thought, \"upon this great height is the place to live when one\r\ncomes to the Côte d'Azur, and I won't go home to-night until I have\r\nfound something....\" And I began to climb by a by-path.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was hot. After a mile or two I rested in the shade of a\r\ngreat rock and fell asleep. When I awoke the sun, which sets early in\r\nwinter, even on the Riviera, was declining. I was not quite sure of my\r\ndirection, but thought that I could make Roquebrune by an oblique path\r\nover the spur of the mountain, and from there easily descend to Cap\r\nMartin and get a carriage, and take the tram which crawls along the\r\ncliff to Monte Carlo. So I set out.\r\n\r\nThe path, however, did not prove to be the right one, and it was\r\ntwilight, or that extremely short interval which does duty for it in the\r\nsouth, before I came to three or four stone huts fronting a plateau with\r\nan enclosure full of goats. I explained my predicament to a swarthy\r\nwoman who sat knitting at a door, and she gave me directions. She also\r\nsaid, in mingled French and Italian, for the frontier was not five\r\nmiles away, that there would be a small empty villa to be let a mile\r\nonwards--at least, she believed so.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me the name of the owner, madame?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"But, no, m'sieu. It is a new gentleman. He has bought the villa and the\r\nlarger one, which is close to it but higher up the hill. He is a scholar\r\nof some sort, and lives quite alone, so he cannot want the smaller house\r\non the road. It was, moreover, always let in the time of the last owner,\r\nM. Visguis, of Nice.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked the good dame, refused a cup of goats' milk, gave her a\r\nfive-franc piece and started on my way again rejoicing. My luck was in.\r\nThis mountain châlet would be just the thing, and I made up my mind to\r\ninterview the recluse on my way home.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank, and night came up with a rush out of the Mediterranean.\r\nEverything was dead still. There are no birds in these solitudes, and\r\nthe hum of day insects was over. Although the moon rose almost at once\r\nand gave sufficient light to steer by, the place was eerie. Immense\r\nrocks threw ashen shadows. The stone pines stood like silent sentinels,\r\nand the huge coronet of jewels--topaz against black velvet--that was\r\nMonte Carlo seemed a hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nFollowing my directions, I came at length to the garden wall of a\r\nfairly large villa, painted all along the sides, with gigantic and\r\nmelancholy trees, and the moonlight shed a ghostly radiance upon it.\r\nThis, I knew, was the house in occupation. The one that might be let was\r\nlower down the slope and on the other side of the road--to my right. I\r\ncould just see the roof of it as I peered over the parapet.\r\n\r\nPushing open a wooden gate, I went up the garden path towards the Villa\r\nTurquoise--that I had discovered was its name. Tree frogs were croaking\r\nround the house, but as it was winter, there were no friendly fireflies;\r\nonce or twice the fans of a palm clicked with a dry, rustling noise.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to find the door as I came up to the villa, but after a\r\nmoment, I saw a broad band of yellow light coming from the side, and\r\nturned towards it. I walked upon the turf of a little lawn, and threaded\r\nmy way between orange and pepper trees, with here and there a bush of\r\nCape gooseberries.\r\n\r\nAnd up to that moment I never had a suspicion or a qualm. Indeed, I felt\r\nat peace with myself and all the world, washed and purified by the sweet\r\nAlpine air and all the loveliness my eyes had looked upon that day. Then\r\nI heard, clear, strong and sudden, a chord of music on a piano.\r\n\r\nI stopped dead still.\r\n\r\nAgain that crash of sound, and then a smooth and mellow arpeggio, as\r\nmasterly fingers ran up and down the keys of a magnificent instrument.\r\n\r\nI grew cold, suddenly and horribly cold.\r\n\r\nI could see nothing but a long French window glowing orange with light\r\nin the dark side of the house. I had heard nothing but some chords upon\r\na grand piano.\r\n\r\nBut in that moment, though subconsciously, I _knew_.\r\n\r\nI moved forward in little automatic jerks, listening with a dreadful\r\nfear, a sick certainty. The second before I came to the window and\r\nlooked inside, it began.\r\n\r\nPlayed by a master hand, I heard the opening notes of the Third Ballade\r\nof Chopin....\r\n\r\nAnother step, and, in the darkness myself, I could see into the room.\r\n\r\nThe musician was Mr. Vargus.\r\n\r\nHe had grown a little moustache, which was waxed at the ends, and a\r\nsmall black imperial on his chin. He was also much fatter than when I\r\nhad seen him last, and he wore a smoking jacket of purple velvet. On one\r\nfinger was a diamond ring, which flashed in the lamplight as the firm,\r\npowerful hands rose and fell.\r\n\r\nThere was a soft smile in the sly eyes as he interpreted the beautiful,\r\nfantastic music.\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you what happened without comment or any reference\r\nwhatever to my own feelings.\r\n\r\nThe melody progressed to that marvellous passage which Beardsley saw in\r\nline as a white horse ambling through a dark wood of pines, ridden by a\r\nlady in a dress of black velvet.\r\n\r\nAt the opening chords of the theme a door behind the player opened\r\nquietly. He heard nothing.\r\n\r\nAn awful and august figure entered.\r\n\r\nIt was Danjuro, but not the Danjuro I had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe wore a robe of yellow silk with wide kimono sleeves, and a sash of\r\npurple round his waist. Into the sash was thrust the long scabbard of an\r\nancient Japanese sword--a scabbard of tortoise-shell and silver. His\r\nhair was differently arranged, his lips compressed into a single line.\r\nThe eyes, which seemed curiously elongated, glittered like black lacquer\r\nin a high light.\r\n\r\nHe crept forward and touched Vargus on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe man in the velvet coat leapt up with a short, sharp cry. Then he\r\nwhipped round and came face to face with Danjuro.\r\n\r\nThey remained, staring into each other's eyes for several seconds.\r\n\r\nI saw a ghostly change beginning in the pirate's face. Inch by inch\r\nsomething crept over it like a veil as life ebbed away. Then he fell in\r\na crumpled heap upon the carpet.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese looked down at him without a change in his dreadful stony\r\nglare. Then he bent down and pulled the limp form out straight, turning\r\nit with its face downwards. He drew the sword and lifted it high above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nAs it gleamed I shut my eyes....\r\n\r\nWhen I looked again, sick with the sickness of death itself, the figure\r\nin the yellow robe had raised both arms above its head. The sleeves had\r\nslipped away and the coils of muscle stood out upon the brown flesh.\r\n\r\nDanjuro's lips were parted. He seemed to be speaking rapidly to\r\nsomething above him. His whole face was irradiated with joy, and the\r\nsword in his right hand shone like a tall flame.\r\n\r\nHe remained there for some little time. Then he lowered his arms, and\r\ntaking a square of purple silk from his breast, he cleansed the sword,\r\nand I knew what he was going to do.\r\n\r\nHe placed the jewelled hilt upon the carpet and adjusted the point at\r\nhis waist, steadying the blade with his left hand. Then, with a loud\r\ncry, as if of exaltation, he fell heavily forward....\r\n\r\nHe had gone to his own place in the way appointed to the Heroes of Old\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED AT\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEL RIVER PRESS\r\n\r\nKINGSTON, SURREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATERNOSTER HOUSE,\r\nPATERNOSTER ROW,\r\nLONDON, E.C.\r\n_July, 1919_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs.

He knew Bohemia from the\r\ninside, and was closely associated with many of the interesting people\r\nwho are introduced into his book. He carries his humour into his\r\nwriting, and there are numbers of good stories to help him. The book not\r\nonly makes enjoyable reading, but it also throws a good deal of light on\r\na number of well-known characters in the world of Bohemia and the\r\natmosphere in which they lived. The many drawings by the author which\r\nillustrate the book are a special feature, and greatly add to its\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A New Volume of the famous_\r\n\r\nMemoirs of William Hickey\r\n\r\nEdited by ALFRED SPENCER\r\n\r\n_In demy 8vo, cloth gilt_, +15s.+ _net_.\r\n\r\nThis third volume continues the memoirs from 1782, and will be found as\r\nfascinating as those which have already been published.

Like many other ladies\r\nof position she threw herself heart and soul into the every-day drudgery\r\nof hospital work and the numerous duties of those who undertook the\r\nresponsibilities of large country estates in the absence of their\r\nowners; and she gives us in a most delightful story a very true insight\r\ninto the activities, thoughts and feelings of a class which did a great\r\ndeal of war work, and said very little about it.\r\n\r\nHer previous books have already established her as a close observer of\r\nhuman nature and a writer with a wide, tolerant outlook and a style of\r\nunusual distinction.\r\n\r\nSome Press opinions on the Author's work:\r\n\r\n     \"The book, fresh and alive, reads as if it were an actual record of\r\n     her life.\"--_Times._\r\n\r\n     \"It is the real thing that interests this pleasant author, the real\r\n     aspect of nature, the real romance of the countryside, the real\r\n     meaning of life.\"--_Daily Telegraph._\r\n\r\n     \"All those who have read and liked her previous books will find the\r\n     same fragrance the same chatty friendliness, the same easy\r\n     niceness.\"--_Observer._\r\n\r\n     \"All that she writes she invests with an air of delicate\r\n     distinction.\"--_Spectator._\r\n\r\n\r\nJust Ready\r\n\r\n_A TIMELY AND IMPORTANT BOOK_\r\n\r\nThe New Traffic (Aircraft)\r\n\r\nBy W. H. BERRY\r\n\r\nEditor of _The Car_ and _Aviation_ and Author of \"Aircraft in War and\r\nCommerce,\" \"Fighting Aeroplanes,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_In cr. 8vo, bound with frontispiece and a wrapper in colours, +3s.+ +6d.+\r\nnet._\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest problems of the day is to determine how aircraft can\r\nbe turned to the best advantage in the service of the country. The war\r\nis over, but the days for the use of aircraft in the carrying of\r\npassengers, goods, and mails, and for the convenience and pleasure of\r\nthe private user have only just begun. Mr. Berry's book deals with the\r\nlast year or two of aviation, the present position and what may be\r\nexpected in the future. Already passenger and mail services are being\r\nestablished, and it will probably not be long before many men will be\r\nusing aeroplanes in the way they now use cars, only they will be able to\r\ngo where cars cannot, and at a much quicker pace. Mr. Berry's book is\r\nfor the general reader. He tells him what he will want to know, takes\r\nhim through actual flights, explains engines, controls, construction,\r\ncross country and overseas flying, laws, rules and traffic regulations,\r\nwhat cost of services will be, and how mail services already established\r\nare working. Everything that a man wants to know who expects to fly on\r\nhis own account or who hopes to be taken up as a passenger will be found\r\nhere. The book is particularly timely in view of the enormous interest\r\nnow being taken by the press in the subject of the future uses of\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just Published_\r\n\r\nElizabethan Ulster\r\n\r\nBy LORD ERNEST HAMILTON\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The First Seven Divisions\" (21st Edition), \"The Soul of\r\nUlster,\" etc.\r\n\r\n_In demy 8vo, cloth, +16s.+ net._\r\n\r\n     \"A very full and detailed story of the beginnings of Ulster he has\r\n     made a history, very lively and entertaining without sacrificing\r\n     anything of the seriousness with which it deserves to be\r\n     treated.\"--_Westminster Gazette._\r\n\r\n     \"A detailed account of the amazingly complex affairs of Ulster\r\n     during Elizabeth's reign....

It is a live\r\nbook, and Sanity is a very real girl. The book is distinctive, and a\r\nmost intriguing situation is created when the man Sanity loves believes\r\nher to be the woman--a stranger to him--who is to provide the\r\ncompromising circumstances necessary for his wife to obtain, \"by\r\narrangement,\" her divorce. The author, in taking Sanity through her very\r\ninteresting career, deals in her characteristic manner with life and\r\npeople as one finds them to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death Drum\r\n\r\nBy MARGARET PETERSON\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"To Love,\" \"Butterfly Wings,\" \"The Lure of the Little Drum,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAs in her last novel, \"The Sword Points of Love,\" Miss Peterson has\r\nchosen East Africa as the background for her new story. It is based on a\r\nnative superstition that very few white people know anything about, but\r\nwhich may in time cause trouble. It has, at any rate, provided the\r\nauthor with a fine idea for her novel, and she has made the best\r\npossible use of it. The book is absorbingly interesting, full of\r\nthrilling incident and adventure, and with many touches of native life\r\nthat are particularly effective, coming as they do from one who is\r\nliving among them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPanther\r\n\r\nA Comedy of Morals\r\n\r\nBy R. A. FOSTER-MELLIAR\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Blindstone,\" \"And Betty Too,\" etc.\r\n\r\nA novel of country life, in which there is a good mixture of\r\nlove-making, hunting, intrigue, and almost murder. Two well-contrasted\r\nand charming girls divide the honours as heroines, and uncertainty as to\r\nwhat will happen to them is well kept up. There are some very\r\ninteresting characters capitally portrayed, and, above all, there is a\r\nreally good story well told in uncommonly good writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air Pirate\r\n\r\nBy C. RANGER-GULL\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The Snare of the Fowler,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe author dates his story forward, when rapid transit and transport\r\nwill be carried on by air. One of the great points about it is that the\r\nauthor is the first in the field with his idea. The Air Pirate, a\r\nmysterious figure, who had been a daring airman in the Great War, has\r\nhis lair in Cornwall, and raids the Atlantic with a wonderful airship.\r\nThere is a love story, in which a young English baronet of the\r\nGovernment Air Police is the hero and a beautiful young actress the\r\nheroine. She is carried off to Cornwall by the pirate, who is in love\r\nwith her, in his airship, and then follow many thrilling adventures in\r\nthe efforts of her young lover to discover her. One sensation follows\r\nanother rapidly, and the reader is kept in breathless suspense all\r\nthrough. It is the best thing the author has yet done.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove and the Cardinal\r\n\r\nBy J. H. SYMONS\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The Supreme Mystery\"\r\n\r\nA story of the days of Cardinal Wolsey and the Court of Henry VIII. It\r\nwill appeal to all who like a good historical romance. The hero, a young\r\nesquire, finds Wolsey, when he was but a poor parish priest, in the\r\nvillage pillory and sets him free. When next they meet, Wolsey is the\r\npowerful Cardinal, and the hero has been condemned to torture for trying\r\nto save the Duke of Buckingham, whose daughter he worships. Wolsey helps\r\nthe hero and brings him to Court. There are plottings and jealousies and\r\nnarrow escapes, but in the end Love is triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpade Work\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Candlelight,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Author's stories of Sussex\r\n\r\nCaroline Beech and her mother, with the airs of a duchess who has had to\r\ndo the work of a cook, and Enoch Wood, the musician who demands fame\r\nabove all things, and Juniper Sadgrove, with her glorious voice, are the\r\ncharacters whose interplay form the plot of Mrs. Dudeney's latest novel.\r\nShe has set the scene in her loved Sussex, and her description of the\r\nold-world village and its inhabitants is most delightful. Enoch's career\r\nis the rock on which the ship of his love may be wrecked, but the\r\ndevelopment of the story will hold the reader's attention to the last\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Green Shoes of April\r\n\r\nBy RACHEL SWETE MACNAMARA\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Morning Joy,\" \"Lark's Gate,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAn Irish love story out of the common, and with many ups and downs, but\r\nwith a happy ending. It is, as one expects from Miss Macnamara,\r\nunusually well written with excellent character drawing. Jasper Lysaght\r\nmade a mistaken marriage with an actress when he was very young. They\r\nhold together but a little while, when he meets his true mate, but a\r\nmaliciously interfering grandmother and wounded pride separate them.\r\nThey come together again and marry, Jasper believing himself free, but\r\nhis first wife reappears. All, however, comes right in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nShooting Stars\r\n\r\nBy SOPHIE KERR\r\n\r\nAn intensely dramatic novel of married life--the story of Harleth\r\nCrossey (\"as self-willed as a shooting star and about as uncomfortable\r\naround the house\"), and his wife Marcia--she made all the concessions,\r\nall the adjustments and all the compromises until--something happened.\r\n\r\nYou might have called it a rebellion; it was a startling, if cruel\r\nawakening as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Master Mind\r\n\r\nBy FERGUS HUME\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The Mystery of A Hansom Cab,\" \"Heart of Ice.\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the working out of the plot and the discovery of the master mind of a\r\ngang of thieves the author keeps the reader's attention firmly fixed.\r\nThe book is written carefully; there are no great improbabilities; the\r\ncharacters are human, not too good and not impossibly wicked; the\r\nheroine is a charming natural girl, the hero a nice boy. There is a\r\nmystery surrounding a murder and theft, and it might all have happened.\r\nA good readable story.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Whirlwind of Passion\r\n\r\nBy EDNA WORTHLEY UNDERWOOD\r\n\r\nThe publishers have pleasure in introducing the author with this novel.\r\nIt is perhaps not too much to say that since \"Quo Vadis,\" no more\r\npowerful historical romance has been produced. The story is most\r\ndramatic, and the central figure is the great Catherine. The reader is\r\ngiven a clear insight into the Russian Court and its intrigues. The time\r\nof the story is the dramatic moment when the reign of the Empress\r\nElizabeth was drawing to a close, and the throne was hanging in the\r\nbalance. The author has seized on this tense situation, and told a\r\nwonderful story of love, of passion, of plotting and ruthless power, of\r\nmurder and sudden death. It is a brilliant book, full of life, movement\r\nand colour, and it is of particular interest at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Ladies\r\n\r\nBy DOUGLAS NEWTON\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"The War Caché,\" etc.\r\n\r\nA charming story told in a delightful manner, recalling the work of\r\nHenry Harland. The scene is in Hampshire, where some mystery attaches to\r\nthe lady owner of a house occupied temporarily by a much-travelled man,\r\nwho is recovering his health. How he becomes interested in the lady, how\r\nhe gradually discovers her story, how he labours to free her from the\r\ncloud that oppresses her, and finally is made happy by her, is so\r\ndaintily and beautifully related, that one wishes to read many of the\r\npages over again. Mr. Douglas Newton goes a long step forward with this\r\nnovel, which reveals him in a new capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbers\r\n\r\nBy JULES DEPREND\r\n\r\n_A novel that won a $10,000 prize in America._\r\n\r\nThis story of life among the French Canadians on the American border is\r\nrefreshingly outside the common run of novels. It is remarkable for its\r\nterseness of expression and as a convincing piece of realism. It is as\r\nstrong and virile as Balzac, and its story so absorbing with its many\r\ndramatic situations, that it holds the attention from beginning to end.\r\nAgainst his father's wishes, the hero takes up a course of study with a\r\nview to becoming a priest. During his holidays he sees much of a\r\nneighbour's daughter, who had been a companion of his childhood. How he\r\nsuccumbs, then decides to continue his studies abroad, and eventually\r\nreturns to his sweetheart and child is told in this powerful book, of\r\nwhich it may be said that it is not only a fine piece of work, but one\r\nof genius.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirecracker Jane\r\n\r\nBy ALICE CALHOUN HAINES\r\n\r\nA breathless romance of the Mexican border, with a spirited heroine, a\r\ngood sportswoman with a high sense of honour. How she is, under stress,\r\nmarried by her Mexican cousin and plunged into the Mexican turmoil,\r\ncaptured by a brutal revolutionist, and effects her escape, and how the\r\nlove tangle is unravelled, and she is left with her real love mate,\r\nmakes thrilling reading. The story is full of adventure, vivacious and\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cabin (La Barraca)\r\n\r\nBy V. BLASCO IBANEZ\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"+The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse+,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOver a Quarter of a Million copies of this author's work have already\r\nbeen sold in English speaking countries.\r\n\r\nThis may be said to be the masterpiece of a novelist who has established\r\nhimself as a great master. \"The Cabin\" was the book which first made\r\nIbanez's reputation outside Spain, and very large numbers of it have\r\nbeen sold on the Continent and in America since its first appearance. It\r\nis a vivid presentation of one side of Spanish life, and tells how a\r\nhard-working farmer and his family are oppressed and wronged by his\r\nneighbours, who had determined that the farm should not be tilled.\r\nDisaster overtakes the family at the end of the conflict, and the\r\nelemental theme of a blind communal hatred is thus worked out to its\r\nlogical conclusion. The story seems to write itself, so simply, and\r\nperfectly is it done. It is a remarkable work of art.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Terrible Island\r\n\r\nBy BEATRICE GRIMSHAW\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"In the Strange South Seas,\" \"Red Bob of the Islands,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis story has all the charm and glamour of the South Seas and a\r\nbackground of grim mystery, which make a plot full of thrills as well as\r\nof delightful romance. \"The Lady of Sea,\" who appears in such strange\r\nfashion and so charms the hearts of Flower and Owen Ireland, is a\r\ndelicious heroine, whose romance will appeal to every reader, while\r\n\"Rocky Jim\" is a remarkable character creation. A novel that will well\r\nsupport the author's great reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Messrs.
