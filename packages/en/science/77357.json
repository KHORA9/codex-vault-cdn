But only\r\n  the wisdom of the very old could prevent a terrible war.\r\n\r\n  _The ebullient author of_ NIGHTMARE TOWER _and_ WHEN THE WHITE RAIN\r\n  CAME _has done it again--achieved a near-miracle of reporting in the\r\n  wondrous bright purlieus of tomorrow. We’ve often wondered whether\r\n  Jacques Jean Ferrat actually travels into the future to observe its\r\n  liveliest attributes or simply peers through one of those remarkable\r\n  “peepholes in Time” which open up occasionally. Whatever his\r\n  technique, the results are delightful_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA terrestrial journalist once described the plight of a space pilot on\r\na solo interstellar trip as being similar to that of a flea on one of\r\nthe great stone dogs of Planet VI, Betelgeuse. All that vast expanse to\r\nplunder and no way of getting at it.\r\n\r\nTo Echelon Leader Hannibal Pryor, the simile was apt. It was aggravated\r\nby the fact that he was an unwilling flea. If his chief and sponsor,\r\nStar Marshal Stefan Lopez, had not backed the losing side in the last\r\nSirius IX plebescite, Pryor would have been piloting the immense\r\nstar-battleship _Erebus_, from which the planet-buster was to be\r\ndropped. Instead, he had been assigned this miserable chore of checking\r\nRigel IV, the planet scheduled for blasting.\r\n\r\nIt was a job that should have gone to a mere ensign, not a veteran\r\nechelon leader with three comets on his breast. There was nothing to\r\ndo. His survey route had been plotted in advance by the calculators\r\nthat crammed the deck below and precision instruments did all the\r\nchecking. If Rigel IV were habitable or inhabited, it would not have\r\nbeen selected for the test.\r\n\r\nThe flying laboratory in which he sat would circle it twice, then\r\nreturn under automatic control to the dot in space, 3,000,000\r\nkilometers away, five o’clock vector, where ships of half the\r\ninhabited planets were gathering to watch the test.\r\n\r\nWellington Smith, the new chief star marshal, had his own pet pilot for\r\nthe big job. Hannibal Pryor, as one of Lopez’ top men, was out of the\r\nbig picture.\r\n\r\nFlying the preliminary milk run! It made acid flow in his veins. And\r\nhe was getting fat from punching out weird gastronomic combinations\r\non the food-board. There was nothing to do but eat--and swill up the\r\nnon-intoxicating drinks available through the dispenser.\r\n\r\nThe way things stood, Pryor knew he’d be lucky if he made wing chief in\r\nten years Earth-time. Once you were out of the big picture, it took a\r\nmiracle to pull you back into focus.\r\n\r\nIdly, Pryor lowered his long dark-skinned body into the observer’s\r\nbucket, and watched the small golden dot that was Rigel IV swiftly\r\nenlarge itself on the screen. It took on a bluish tinge and acquired\r\nthe fuzzy halo that denoted an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe scientists, prodded by the political leaders of Sirius Sector, had\r\nselected for the sake of thoroughness a planet known to be habitable,\r\nthough uninhabited, at least by human beings. The planet-buster had\r\nalready been tested on the airless satellites of one of the dark stars.\r\n\r\nWithout much interest, Pryor watched Rigel IV fill the screen,\r\ngradually become convex. He had landed on far too many worlds to\r\nbe frightened by the effect of its falling upon him as he neared\r\nit. Half-subconsciously, he noted that the star-brakes were working\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nHe felt the faint jar as the atmosphere engines took over from the\r\nstar-drive. The little lights on the panel flared and flickered in\r\nproper sequence as the flying laboratory began its first circuit of a\r\nworld that was soon to be blasted to stardust.\r\n\r\nLater, he realized that he must have dozed off. At any rate, he missed\r\nthe flicker of green light at the left of the panel and it took the\r\nrasping electronic voice that unexpectedly called, “Pilot control,\r\npilot control, pilot control,” to awaken him.\r\n\r\nHe muttered, “_Diamede!_” in sheer disbelief, as he pushed the button\r\nthat turned off the voice and took over the controls. It couldn’t\r\npossibly have happened and yet--the instruments were never wrong.\r\n\r\nRigel IV was inhabited--by humans!\r\n\r\nAs he brought the ship in along an ever-slowing parabola, Pryor pulled\r\nthe outspeaker over in front of his mouth and said, “Lab Able calling\r\n_Erebus_, Lab Able calling _Erebus_. Locator shows humanity on Rigel\r\nFour, locator shows humanity on Rigel Four. Over.”\r\n\r\nHe held course and watched the seconds tick by on the call chronometer.\r\nEleven, twelve, thirteen ... thirty-five, thirty-six ... A burst of\r\ngibberish emerged from the inspeaker until he tuned the unscrambler\r\nand heard, “I hear you, Lab Able. Check for inhabitants and arrange\r\nimmediate evacuation, check for inhabitants and arrange immediate\r\nevacuation. Report when assignment complete, report when assignment\r\ncomplete. Time is of the essence, time is of the essence. Over and out,\r\nover and out.”\r\n\r\nPryor wrestled with temptation. If he put another message through,\r\nunscrambled, stating the situation, Interstellar Control monitors\r\nwould inevitably pick it up. Interstellar Control was death on any\r\ninterference with inhabited planets. Interstellar Control was already\r\non record as being against the planet-buster test on a usable world.\r\nAnd not even the new chief star marshal was strong enough to buck IC.\r\n\r\nPryor smiled and hummed a little Antarean tune as he slowed Lab Able to\r\nhovering speed. If he handled the situation adroitly, he should be able\r\nto get Marshal Lopez out of the doghouse--and, quite as important, one\r\nEchelon Leader Hannibal Pryor back in the big picture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the instruments, the humans on Rigel IV lived in a\r\nsingle small settlement in the south temperate zone of the planet,\r\nsurprisingly close to the forbidding antarctic ice-cap.\r\n\r\nPryor cut in distance-detail vision and blinked unbelievingly at a\r\ncluster of thatched roofs about a strangely familiar structure with\r\na tall white pointed spire. The fields about the settlement, where\r\nthey did not show cultivation, bore an odd pale purple hue. Beyond the\r\nvillage lay a long, narrow, twisting body of pale blue water.\r\n\r\nPryor spotted a level spot that looked suitable for landing, clear of\r\nthe tilled fields. His mocha colored fingers played the panel-buttons\r\nlike the fingers of an organist ringing in stops, as he prepared Lab\r\nAble for its descent.\r\n\r\nEmerging from his ship, Pryor discovered that the pale purple fields\r\nwere actually covered with a sort of low, tough shrubbery. It covered\r\nthe sparsely-treed hills beyond the lake and seemed to fade into the\r\ndeep misty blue of the afternoon sky.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had never seen a landscape like it, in all his roving over\r\nscores of planets, Pryor found it pleasant. A strong, cool wind whipped\r\nhis weatherproof coverall against the backs of his legs. After the\r\nartificial atmosphere of Lab Able, the fresh air stung his nostrils\r\npleasantly. And the smell of the pale purple shrubbery was sweet.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled over a low barrier of uncut gray stone that marked the\r\nboundary of the field in which he had landed and found himself on\r\na narrow road of ochre-hued dirt. He trudged along it, toward the\r\nvillage, and around a dipping bend met two men riding in a surface\r\ncar of fantastically ancient vintage. If Pryor had not seen similar\r\nvehicles in his histofilm course at the academy, he would scarcely have\r\nknown what it was. It actually ran on wheels with plastic rims.\r\n\r\nIt pulled to a halt alongside him and the red-bearded patriarch sitting\r\nnext to the young man at the controls, leapt spryly out and said in odd\r\nthick accents, “Welcome to Leith on Nevis, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe older man had to repeat the greeting before Pryor found words.\r\nThere was so much that was astonishing about him. First, his clothing.\r\nIt consisted of stout shoes of what looked like real leather, long\r\nwoven socks in brilliant diamond checks, a brief black jacket and a\r\nsort of skirt woven in a complex pattern of blue-and-green checks and\r\nkept from flaring in the wind by a heavy pouch of some sort of fur.\r\n\r\nA sort of blanket that matched the skirt was slung over his left\r\nshoulder and an odd-looking flat black bonnet, turned up on one side by\r\nan elaborate metal clip, had a headband of the same bright material.\r\n\r\nSecond, his beard. For centuries, all male human children were given\r\nfacial depilation shortly after birth, and as a result, the old man’s\r\nluxurious red growth looked both alarming and unsanitary. Third, his\r\nskin. It was like that of the young man engaged in turning the vehicle\r\nawkwardly about, a pale reddish pink that made Pryor conscious of his\r\nown dark normality.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered from his surprise at encountering such a strange\r\nspecimen, Pryor returned his greeting and asked to be taken to the\r\nchief or leader of the community.\r\n\r\nThe younger man, who had pulled up alongside again but facing the other\r\nway, said, “You’re speaking to the Dominie now, sir.” His accent was as\r\nalien and thick as that of the man with the beard. And his costume was\r\nsimilar save for minor details.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the village, they had to halt while a flock of _baaa_ing\r\ngray sheep, tended by a husky-looking youngster and a long-haired\r\nblack-and-white dog, crossed the dirt road. Pryor, who had never seen\r\nanything like them before, asked what they were, what they were for.\r\n\r\nThe older man smiled and said, “Their wool supplies us with the\r\nclothing we wear. Their hides provide us with light leather. Their\r\nflesh provides us with meat for the table.”\r\n\r\nPryor nodded, wishing he hadn’t asked. The idea of eating the flesh of\r\nliving creatures--or recently living creatures--appalled him. He had an\r\nidea he wasn’t going to enjoy his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe village, with its stone houses and thatched roofs reminded Pryor of\r\na village in a fairy tale vidarfilm. He noted with growing amazement\r\nthat all the inhabitants seemed to be fair of hair and skin, all wore\r\nthe gay skirts and bonnets, regardless of sex. He was asked to alight\r\nin front of the largest house, one close by the stone church with its\r\nwhite wooden spire.\r\n\r\nThe Dominie led him into a room of wholly unexpected comfort and\r\napplied flame to a pile of cut logs in a wide stone fireplace.\r\n\r\nThis done, he produced two earthenware mugs and a stone bottle\r\nand said, “I doubt not but that your mission to Leith on Nevis is\r\nimportant. It is only fitting we indulge in a drop before we come to\r\nsuch matters.”\r\n\r\nThe Dominie drained his mug without changing expression, but the\r\ninnocent looking amber liquid made Pryor gasp. It seemed to burn his\r\ngullet and, seconds later, start a warming fire in his veins. When he\r\ncould talk, he gasped, “What was that, Dominie?”\r\n\r\n“That,” said the older man, smiling through his beard, “is uisquebaugh,\r\nthe water of life, known to the less ancient as whiskey.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of it,” Pryor managed. He wondered if he weren’t dreaming\r\nthe whole business, and shook himself mentally in an effort to awaken\r\nin the prosaic surroundings of Lab Able. But nothing changed.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” he said, “I’ve brought you a problem, Dominie.” He\r\nwondered what the word meant. “I’ve got orders from headquarters,\r\nSirius Sector to have this planet evacuated at once.”\r\n\r\nCourteously, the older man refilled Pryor’s mug, then poured more\r\nliquid fire into his own. He said, “And what is the alternative?”\r\n\r\n“There is no alternative,” Pryor replied bluntly. “In a matter of\r\nthirty-six hours, Earth-time, this little world is going to be blown to\r\nsmithereens.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say one thing for you, young man,” said the Dominie. “You don’t\r\nbelieve in beating about the bush.” He drained his mug once more, and\r\nadded over its rim, “Is the universe at war?”\r\n\r\n“Not at present, I’m happy to say,” said Pryor.\r\n\r\n“Then I fear your errand is wasted,” said the other. “If there is no\r\nwar, then we shall not evacuate. Even if there were, I should hesitate\r\nto uproot my people. They would have to leave so much of what they have\r\nwrought and love behind them.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you,” said Pryor, wondering just how stupid the patriarch\r\nwas, “that you will receive ample compensation.”\r\n\r\n“Can you then arrange ample compensation for human hearts?” the old man\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nPryor braced himself and drained his mug. To his surprise, the whiskey\r\nor whatever it was, went down smoothly. He said, “I’m afraid you don’t\r\nunderstand the situation, sir. This planet, Rigel Four, is the subject\r\nfor testing of the deadliest new bomb ever made. The experiment is\r\nalready under way. You and your people must evacuate. Of course, if our\r\nplotters had known of your existence--”\r\n\r\n“They’d have selected another world to blow up,” the Dominie finished\r\nfor him. “I fear they’ll have to make the change anyway. Our title to\r\nthis planet is quite clear and above-board. Allow me to show you.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, crossed to a lovingly carved and polished cabinet, and\r\nwithdrew not a vidiroll but some actual ancient documents, handed them\r\nto Pryor.\r\n\r\nPryor looked at them with growing excitement. It was a planet charter,\r\nbeyond question, granted some two centuries before by Interplanetary\r\nControl, the predecessor of Interstellar Control. It stated that Arnold\r\nMacRae, Ian Stephenson and Alexandra Hamilton had purchased, in goods,\r\ncash and services, the full rights to Rigel IV, hereafter to be known\r\nas Nevis. It added that the rights were to run in perpetuity, save only\r\nin the case of interstellar war and then only during the existence of a\r\nstate of war.\r\n\r\nSomebody had slipped when Marshal Wellington Smith selected Rigel IV\r\nfor his planet-busting test. Pryor suspected the listing of this world\r\nunder Nevis, among the titled planets, rather than as Rigel IV among\r\nthe untitled, plus the antiquity of the deal and the small size and\r\nisolation of the settlement, had caused the error.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, noting that the floor seemed to slant where it had been\r\nlevel when he entered. He said, “There’s been a serious error, I fear.\r\nCan you have me driven to my ship at once? I must report it while there\r\nis still time.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, young man,” said the Dominie, rising.\r\n\r\nBack in Lab Able, Pryor ran his hands over his face, which felt\r\nunreasonably hot. He punched in the outspeaker, called the _Erebus_ and\r\nexplained the situation. At its conclusion, he added innocently, “Shall\r\nI call in Interstellar for checking and aid? Over.”\r\n\r\nHe had to wait almost half an hour, Earth-time, for the reply to come\r\nthrough. In the meantime, he could picture the consternation among the\r\nsmug brass hats on the flagship. He hummed the Antarean ditty again,\r\nfeeling strangely relaxed and comfortable.\r\n\r\nFinally it came through. When he got it unscrambled, it was orders to\r\nsit tight while higher authority dealt with the situation. He signed\r\noff, chuckling, and went back outside to the ancient surface-car, where\r\nthe young man and a young woman were waiting for him. He had left\r\nthe message recorder on, resolved to return in two hours for further\r\norders. If there were none, he was going to call in IC. Come what\r\nmight, he was back in the big picture with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Dominie’s house, the girl said, “When you’re\r\nthrough eating, perhaps you’ll come to the kirk vestry. We’ll be having\r\na small dance.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her more closely and, in spite of the rosy and unnatural\r\nwhiteness of her skin, noted that she was comely. He resolved to visit\r\nthe kirk vestry as soon as politeness would permit, whatever a kirk\r\nvestry might be.\r\n\r\nHe drank more of the Dominie’s uisquebaugh before dinner and found\r\nhimself asking, “Pardon me, sir, but would you answer one question?”\r\nAnd, at the older man’s nod, “Why are you so few?”\r\n\r\n“We are few by choice,” was the reply. “Our forefathers long ago left\r\nEarth for Proxima Centauri Seven, in one of the earliest migrations, to\r\nescape overcrowding. My people and I like room to breathe in, room to\r\nroam and work without restriction. When PC Seven grew too crowded, we\r\npooled our resources and purchased this world. In those days, planets\r\nsuch as this were cheap enough. The Control was glad to have them\r\nsettled. Since then, we have limited our numbers to avoid a repetition\r\nof what went before.”\r\n\r\nThinking of a life spent in the crowded cities of crowded planets or\r\nin the cramped quarters of starships, Pryor understood. It had been in\r\nsearch of space and freedom that he had joined the service--only to\r\nexchange urban jamming for the prisons of strict discipline and limited\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n“You’ve created a dream,” Pryor said.\r\n\r\nThe Dominie put down his empty mug and said gravely, “Don’t think\r\nit’s been easy. Adapting to the most hospitable alien world is a\r\nbackbreaking job. But we’ve never been afraid of work.”\r\n\r\n“I can see that,” said Pryor, feeling oddly useless. He wondered how he\r\nwould fare without buttons to push, circuits to serve him.\r\n\r\nThe Dominie’s wife, a tall, handsome woman with the frame of a\r\npercheron, appeared and announced that dinner was ready. Thanks to\r\nthe whiskey, or perhaps to his absorption in his exotic surroundings,\r\nPryor found himself actually eating meat--and actually enjoying it.\r\nThe mutton was crisp and black on the outside, tender and pink in the\r\ncenter, and the vegetables and fruits served with it constituted a rich\r\nnew experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal, the Dominie’s wife said, “Tell me, Mr. Pryor, if the\r\nuniverse is not at war, why do they wish to blow up our planet?”\r\n\r\nPryor explained as best he could--and, unexpectedly, he seemed to be\r\nthinking and expressing himself more clearly than ever before. He told\r\nthem about the rise of the aggressive elements in Sirius Sector, about\r\nthe plebescite that had put Wellington Smith in power.\r\n\r\n“They’re fretting under the restrictions of IC,” he said, “and they’re\r\nseeking to gather sufficient strength to obtain concessions. As long as\r\nthey remain within IC limits, they can’t be touched.”\r\n\r\nThe Dominie said quietly, “It’s the same dreadful story, Mary. Too many\r\npeople, too many unhappy people, restlessness, conspiracy, war. This\r\ntime the whole universe will suffer.” Then, to Pryor, “But if your Star\r\nMarshal obliterates an inhabited IC planet, he’ll be in trouble, will\r\nhe not?”\r\n\r\n“If he should dare do such a thing--and I feel sure he won’t,” said\r\nPryor, “he’ll be as good as ruined.” For some reason he added, as an\r\nafterthought, “That is, if IC hears of it.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the patriarch, nodding thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nHis wife said, “There’s a dance in the kirk vestry this evening, Mr.\r\nPryor. I hope you’ll be in attendance. Naturally, you’ll honor us by\r\nbeing our guest overnight.”\r\n\r\nPryor found the kirk vestry without trouble. It was an extension of the\r\nbig building with the white spire and less than fifty meters from the\r\nDominie’s house. He intended merely to get someone to drive him to his\r\nship and get his message out. But when he heard the shrill, rhythmic\r\ncombination of bagpipes and fiddle, something stirred deep in his\r\nancestral memory and he forgot about all else.\r\n\r\nHe danced with the girl of the surface-car and she showed him the steps\r\nof the strange dances and his feet had magic in them. He laughed with\r\nthe men and drank more of the whiskey and the night became a golden\r\nwhirl of primitive excitement such as he had never known. He needed the\r\nhelp of two of the young men to get him back to the Dominie’s house,\r\nwhere he was undressed and put into a soft warm object they called a\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHe knew no more until the concussion of the explosion brought him\r\nsharply out of his drunken slumber. Although his tongue was thick with\r\nfur and his head rattled as if it were filled with dried pebbles, he\r\nwoke up sober.\r\n\r\nThrough the bedroom window, he saw the flickering brilliance of the\r\nexploded bomb mounting slowly toward the stars. He turned and, with a\r\nstrange sickness in his stomach, scrambled into his clothing. Outside,\r\nhe could hear the little community coming to life.\r\n\r\nHe hadn’t believed they would do it. When he got out of the vehicle,\r\nhe saw an odd little mound of molten metal where Lab Able had stood in\r\nsilver serenity a few minutes earlier. Silently, he cursed the ruthless\r\nmilitarists who were going to blast Rigel IV to dust, and cursed his\r\nown irresponsibility for not sending the message that would have put a\r\nhalt to their plans.\r\n\r\nSomebody said in the odd accent that was already becoming familiar,\r\n“What happened, Mr. Pryor?”\r\n\r\nPryor thought fast though his head ached badly. He said, “I fear the\r\ndrive fuel reached critical mass. It happens once in a hundred thousand\r\ntimes.” It hadn’t, it couldn’t, but how could he tell them they were as\r\ngood as dead?\r\n\r\nAnd himself with them, of course. But he didn’t waste time thinking\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the Dominie’s house, the wife greeted him gravely.\r\nShe wore a soft wool robe, and her hair was in odd wisps of paper, and\r\nhe could tell by the way she looked at him that she knew.\r\n\r\n“Where can I find the Dominie?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He’s in the basement of the kirk,” she said in her soft untroubled\r\nvoice. “He asked me to ask you to join him there.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, ma’am,” Pryor replied. There was nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nThe light was dim in the basement. The place smelled of age and\r\ndampness. But there was machinery there, a vast pile of it, and the\r\nDominie was fussing around it, wearing a frown.\r\n\r\n“Ho, there, Pryor,” he said. “So they blew up your ship?”\r\n\r\n“They blew her up,” said Pryor grimly. “I never thought they’d dare. If\r\nonly I hadn’t made an idiot of myself at the dance, I’d--”\r\n\r\nThe Dominie cut him off with, “It’s a bit late for regrets, young man.\r\nCome see if we can get this blasted communicator working.”\r\n\r\nPryor’s heart leapt. For a moment, he thought he was gaining a\r\nreprieve. Then he saw the age and condition of the old set--it was at\r\nleast a century old--and realized they’d be lucky to get a message out\r\nat all before the big one blew them to nothingness.\r\n\r\n“Come on, Dominie,” he said, “let’s have that wrench.”\r\n\r\nThey worked through the short night and into the morning that followed.\r\nThe Dominie’s wife brought them a strange herb brew she called tea,\r\nthat reinvigorated them. She said, to Pryor, “Sheila and the other\r\ngirls are very excited. They believe you’ll be staying a while now.\r\nYou’ll be the first stranger in many years.”\r\n\r\nPryor wiped his brow grimly and said, “Well, I’ll be here as long as\r\nany of them, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“Then there’s no hope?” the Dominie asked quietly over his tea.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we’ll get a message out to the IC,” said Pryor. “We’re almost\r\nready to send. But it will be too late. The bomb is already on its\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Come on then,” said the Dominie, handing his tea back to his wife.\r\n“Let’s waste no time.”\r\n\r\nThey got the message out, before the reddish sun reached the Meridian.\r\nAnd Pryor said grimly, “That makes their second mistake. They should\r\nhave blasted the town last night, not just my ship. Their first mistake\r\nwas in selecting this planet.” He looked about him at the placid, happy\r\nscene, and suppressed a heaving sob.\r\n\r\nThe Dominie put a firm hand on his shoulder and said, “Perhaps it’s\r\nbest this way. Perhaps this is why we are here, to prevent the most\r\nterrible war of all. After all, there aren’t many of us against those\r\nwho would die if your marshal got his way.”\r\n\r\nPryor said, his eyes shining with admiration, “You’re a great man,\r\nDominie--and a brave one.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s just say an old one,” said the patriarch. “And now, since we\r\nhave so little time, let’s you and I walk to the edge of the loch and\r\nlook at the hills on the other side. It’s a lovely view.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, March 1956 (Vol. 5,\r\n  No. 2.).
