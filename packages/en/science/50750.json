C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n“After refreshing my memory by looking over again ‘The Officer’s\r\nManual,’ or ‘Maxims of Napoleon,’ I think I may safely recommend the\r\nrepublication, in America, of the work in English, as likely to be\r\ncalled for by many officers, regular and volunteer. It contains a\r\ncircle of maxims, deduced from the highest source of military science\r\nand experience, with practical illustrations of the principles taken\r\nfrom the most celebrated campaigns of modern times. The study of the\r\nbook cannot fail to set all young officers on a course of inquiry and\r\nreflection greatly to their improvement.\r\n\r\n            “WINFIELD SCOTT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publisher has reissued this little volume as a publication timely\r\nfor the occasion. A collection of maxims which directed the military\r\noperations of the greatest captain of modern times, cannot fail to\r\nprove of great use to such young officers as really desire a knowledge\r\nof the art of war. The maxims are illustrated by instances drawn from\r\nthe campaigns of Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Frederick, and Napoleon.\r\nThese great men were all governed by the same principles, and it is by\r\napplying these principles to the perusal of their respective campaigns,\r\nthat every military man will recognize their wisdom, and make such use\r\nof them hereafter as his own particular genius shall point out.\r\n\r\n“And here, perhaps,” says the translator, Col. D’Aguilar, “my task\r\nmight have been considered finished; but perceiving how incomplete\r\nthe collection was alone, I have endeavored to supply the deficiency\r\nby having recourse for further illustration to the memoirs of\r\nMontécuculli, and the instructions of Frederick to his generals. The\r\nanalogy of their principles with those of Napoleon, has convinced me\r\nthat the art of war is susceptible of two points of view: one, which\r\nrelates entirely to the acquirements and genius of the general; the\r\nother, which refers to matters of detail.\r\n\r\n“The first is the same in all ages, and with all nations, whatever be\r\nthe arms with which they fight. Hence it follows that, in every age,\r\ngreat commanders have been governed by the same principles.\r\n\r\n“The business of detail, on the contrary, is controlled by existing\r\ncircumstances. It varies with the character of a people, and the\r\nquality of their arms.\r\n\r\n“It is with a view to impress the justice of this remark, that I have\r\nsought for facts in different periods of history, to illustrate these\r\nmaxims, and to prove that nothing is _problematical_ in war; but that\r\nfailure and success in military operations depend almost always on the\r\nnatural genius and science of the chief.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S\r\n\r\nMAXIMS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frontiers of states are either large rivers, or chains of\r\nmountains, or deserts. Of all these obstacles to the march of an army,\r\nthe most difficult to overcome is the desert; mountains come next, and\r\nbroad rivers occupy the third place.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in his military career, appears to have been called upon to\r\nsurmount every difficulty which can occur in wars of invasion.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt he traversed deserts, and vanquished and destroyed the\r\nMamelukes, so celebrated for their address and courage. His genius\r\nknew how to accommodate itself to all the dangers of this distant\r\nenterprise, in a country ill adapted to supply the wants of his troops.\r\n\r\nIn the conquest of Italy, he twice crossed the Alps by the most\r\ndifficult passes, and at a season, too, which rendered this undertaking\r\nstill more formidable. In three months he passed the Pyrenees, defeated\r\nand dispersed four Spanish armies. In short, from the Rhine to the\r\nBorysthenes, no natural obstacle could be found to arrest the rapid\r\nmarch of his victorious army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn forming the plan of a campaign, it is requisite to foresee\r\neverything the enemy may do, and to be prepared with the necessary\r\nmeans to counteract it.\r\n\r\nPlans of campaign may be modified _ad infinitum_ according to\r\ncircumstances--the genius of the general, the character of the troops,\r\nand the topography of the theatre of action.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSometimes we see a hazardous campaign succeed, the plan of which is\r\ndirectly at variance with the principles of the art of war. But this\r\nsuccess depends generally on the caprice of fortune, or upon faults\r\ncommitted by the enemy--two things upon which a general must never\r\ncount. Sometimes the plan of a campaign, although based on sound\r\nprinciples of war, runs the risk of failing at the outset if opposed\r\nby an adversary who acts at first on the defensive, and then, suddenly\r\nseizing the initiative, surprises by the skilfulness of his manœuvres.\r\nSuch was the fate of the plan laid down by the Aulic council for the\r\ncampaign of 1796, under the command of Marshal Wurmser. From his\r\ngreat numerical superiority, the marshal had calculated on the entire\r\ndestruction of the French army, by cutting off its retreat. He founded\r\nhis operations on the defensive attitude of his adversary, who was\r\nposted on the line of the Adige, and had to cover the siege of Mantua,\r\nas well as central and lower Italy.\r\n\r\nWurmser, supposing the French army fixed in the neighborhood of\r\nMantua, divided his forces into three corps, which marched separately,\r\nintending to unite at that place. Napoleon, having penetrated the\r\ndesign of the Austrian general, perceived the advantage to be derived\r\nfrom striking the first blow against an army divided into three corps,\r\nwith no communication between them. He hastened, therefore, to raise\r\nthe siege of Mantua, assembled the whole of his forces, and by this\r\nmeans became superior to the imperialists, whose divisions he attacked\r\nand beat in detail. Thus Wurmser, who fancied he had only to march\r\nto certain victory, saw himself compelled, after ten days campaign,\r\nto retire with the remains of his army into the Tyrol, after a loss\r\nof twenty-five thousand men in killed and wounded, fifteen thousand\r\nprisoners, nine stand of colors, and seventy pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nHence, nothing is so difficult as to prescribe beforehand to a general\r\nthe line of conduct he shall pursue during the course of a campaign.\r\nSuccess must often depend on circumstances that cannot be foreseen;\r\nand it should be remembered, likewise, that nothing cramps so much the\r\nefforts of genius as compelling the head of an army to be governed by\r\nany will but his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn army which undertakes the conquest of a country, has its two\r\nwings resting either upon neutral territories, or upon great natural\r\nobstacles, such as rivers or chains of mountains. It happens in some\r\ncases that only one wing is so supported; and in others that both are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance cited, viz., where both wings are protected,\r\na general has only to protect his front from being penetrated. In\r\nthe second, where one wing only is supported, he should rest upon\r\nthe supported wing. In the third, where both wings are exposed, he\r\nshould depend upon a central formation, and never allow the different\r\ncorps under his command to depart from this: for if it be difficult\r\nto contend with the disadvantage of having _two_ flanks exposed,\r\nthe inconvenience is doubled by having _four_, trebled if there be\r\n_six_--that is to say, if the army is divided into two or three\r\ndifferent corps. In the first instance, then, as above quoted, the line\r\nof operation may rest indifferently on the right or on the left. In\r\nthe second, it should be directed toward the wing in support. In the\r\nthird, it should be perpendicular to the centre of the army’s line of\r\nmarch. But in all these cases it is necessary, at a distance of every\r\nfive or six days march, to have a strong post or an entrenched position\r\nupon the line of operation, in order to collect military stores and\r\nprovisions, to organize convoys, to form of it a centre of movement,\r\nand establish a point of defence to shorten the line of operation of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThese general principles in the art of war were entirely unknown, or\r\nlost sight of, in the middle ages. The crusaders in their incursions\r\ninto Palestine appear to have had no object but to fight and to\r\nconquer, so little pains did they take to profit by their victories.\r\nHence, innumerable armies perished in Syria, without any other\r\nadvantage than that derived from the momentary success obtained by\r\nsuperior numbers.\r\n\r\nIt was by the neglect of these principles, also, that Charles XII,\r\nabandoning his line of operation and all communication with Sweden,\r\nthrew himself into the Ukraine, and lost the greater part of his army\r\nby the fatigue of a winter campaign in a barren country destitute of\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nDefeated at Pultawa, he was obliged to seek refuge in Turkey, after\r\ncrossing the Nieper with the remains of his army, diminished to little\r\nmore than one thousand men.\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus was the first who brought back the art of war to its\r\ntrue principles. His operations in Germany were bold, rapid, and well\r\nexecuted. He made success at all times conducive to future security,\r\nand established his line of operation so as to prevent the possibility\r\nof any interruption in his communications with Sweden. His campaigns\r\nform a new era in the art of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the conquest of a country is undertaken by two or three armies,\r\nwhich have each their separate line of operation, until they arrive at\r\na point fixed upon for their concentration, it should be laid down as a\r\nprinciple, that the union of these different corps should never take\r\nplace near the enemy; because the enemy, in uniting his forces, may not\r\nonly prevent this junction, but may beat the armies in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1757, Frederick, marching to the conquest of Bohemia\r\nwith two armies, which had each their separate line of operation,\r\nsucceeded, notwithstanding, in uniting them in sight of the Duke of\r\nLorraine, who covered Prague with the imperial army; but his example\r\nshould not be followed. The success of this march depended entirely on\r\nthe inaction of the duke, who, at the head of seventy thousand men, did\r\nnothing to prevent the junction of the two Prussian armies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll wars should be governed by certain principles, for every war should\r\nhave a definite object, and be conducted according to the rules of\r\nart. (A war should only be undertaken with forces proportioned to the\r\nobstacles to be overcome.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt was a saying of Marshal Villars, that when war is decided on, it is\r\nnecessary to have exact information of the number of troops the enemy\r\ncan bring into the field, since it is impossible to lay down any solid\r\nplan of offensive or defensive operation without an accurate knowledge\r\nof what you have to expect and fear. “When the first shot is fired,”\r\nobserves Marshal Villars, “no one can calculate what will be the issue\r\nof the war. It is, therefore, of vast importance to reflect maturely\r\nbefore we begin it.” When once, however, this is decided, the marshal\r\nobserves that the boldest and most extended plans are generally the\r\nwisest and the most successful. “When we are determined upon war,” he\r\nadds, “we should carry it on vigorously and without trifling.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of a campaign, to _advance_ or _not to advance_,\r\nis a matter for grave consideration; but when once the offensive has\r\nbeen assumed, it must be sustained to the last extremity. However\r\nskilful the manœuvres in a retreat, it will always weaken the _morale_\r\nof an army, because, in losing the chances of success, these last are\r\ntransferred to the enemy. Besides, retreats always cost more men and\r\n_materiel_ than the most bloody engagements; with this difference, that\r\nin a battle the enemy’s loss is nearly equal to your own--whereas in a\r\nretreat the loss is on your side only.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nMarshal Saxe remarks, that no retreats are so favorable as those which\r\nare made before a languid and unenterprising enemy, for when he pursues\r\nwith vigor, the retreat soon degenerates into a rout. “Upon this\r\nprinciple it is a great error,” says the marshal, “to adhere to the\r\nproverb which recommends us to build a bridge of gold for a retreating\r\nenemy. No; follow him up with spirit, and he is destroyed!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn army should be ready every day, every night, and at all times of the\r\nday and night, to oppose all the resistance of which it is capable.\r\nWith this view, the soldier should always be furnished completely\r\nwith arms and ammunition; the infantry should never be without its\r\nartillery, its cavalry, and its generals; and the different divisions\r\nof the army should be constantly in a state to support, to be\r\nsupported, and to protect itself.\r\n\r\nThe troops, whether halted, or encamped, or on the march, should be\r\nalways in favorable positions, possessing the essentials required for\r\na field of battle; for example, the flanks should be well covered, and\r\nall the artillery so placed as to have free range, and to play with the\r\ngreatest advantage. When an army is in column of march, it should have\r\nadvanced guards and flanking parties, to examine well the country in\r\nfront, to the right, and to the left, and always at such distance as\r\nto enable the main body to deploy into position.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe following maxims, taken from the memoirs of Montécuculli, appear\r\nto me well suited to this place, and calculated to form a useful\r\ncommentary on the general principles laid down in the preceding maxim:\r\n\r\n1. When war has been once decided on, the moment is past for doubts and\r\nscruples. On the contrary, we are bound to hope that all the evil which\r\nmay ensue, will not; that Providence, or our own wisdom, may avert it;\r\nor that the want of talent on the part of the enemy may prevent him\r\nfrom benefiting by it. The first security for success is to confer the\r\ncommand on one individual. When the authority is divided, the opinions\r\nof the commanders often vary, and the operations are deprived of that\r\n_ensemble_ which is the first essential to victory. Besides, when an\r\nenterprise is common to many, and not confined to a single person, it\r\nis conducted without vigor, and less interest is attached to the result.\r\n\r\nAfter having strictly conformed to all the rules of war, and satisfied\r\nourselves that nothing has been omitted to ensure eventual success,\r\nwe must then leave the issue in the hands of Providence, and repose\r\nourselves tranquilly in the decision of a higher power.\r\n\r\nLet what will arrive, it is the part of a general-in-chief to remain\r\nfirm and constant in his purposes; he must not allow himself to be\r\nelated by prosperity, nor to be depressed by adversity: for in war good\r\nand bad and fortune succeed each other by turns, form the ebb and flow\r\nof military operations.\r\n\r\n2. When your own army is strong and inured to service, and that of the\r\nenemy is weak and consists of new levies, or of troops enervated by\r\nlong inaction, then you should exert every means to bring him to battle.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, your adversary has the advantage in troops, a\r\ndecisive combat is to be avoided, and you must be content to impede\r\nhis progress, by encamping advantageously, and fortifying favorable\r\npasses. When armies are nearly equal in force, it is desirable _not_ to\r\navoid a battle, but only to attempt to fight one to advantage. For this\r\npurpose, care should be taken to encamp always in front of the enemy;\r\nto move when he moves, and occupy the heights and advantageous grounds\r\nthat lie upon his line of march; to seize upon all the buildings and\r\nroads adjoining to his camp, and post yourself advantageously in the\r\nplaces by which he must pass. It is always something gained to make\r\n_him_ lose time, to thwart his designs, or to retard their progress\r\nand execution. If, however, an army is altogether inferior to that\r\nof the enemy, and there is no possibility of manœuvring against him\r\nwith success, then the campaign must be abandoned, and the troops must\r\nretire into the fortresses.\r\n\r\n3. The principal object of a general-in-chief, in the moment of battle,\r\nshould be to secure the flanks of his army. It is true that natural\r\npositions may be found to effect this object, but these positions being\r\nfixed and immovable in themselves, they are only advantageous to a\r\ngeneral who wishes to wait the shock of the enemy, and not to one who\r\nmarches to the attack.\r\n\r\nA general can, therefore, rely only on the proper arrangement of his\r\ntroops, to enable him to repel any attempt the adversary may make upon\r\nthe front, or flanks, or rear of his army.\r\n\r\nIf one flank of an army rests upon a river, or an impassable ravine,\r\nthe whole of the cavalry may be posted with the other wing, in order to\r\nenvelop the enemy more easily by its superiority in numbers.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy has his flanks supported by woods, light cavalry or\r\ninfantry should be despatched to attack him in flank or in rear during\r\nthe heat of the battle. If practicable, also, an attack should be made\r\nupon the baggage, to add to his confusion.\r\n\r\nIf you desire to beat the enemy’s left with your right wing, or his\r\nright with your left wing, the wing with which you attack should be\r\nreinforced by the _élite_ of your army. At the same moment, the other\r\nwing should avoid battle, and the attacking wing brought rapidly\r\nforward, so as to overwhelm the enemy. If the nature of the ground\r\nadmits, he should be approached by stealth, and attacked before he\r\nis on his guard. If any signs of fear are discoverable in the enemy,\r\nand which are always to be detected by confusion or disorder in his\r\nmovements, he should be pursued immediately, without allowing him\r\ntime to recover himself. It is now the cavalry should be brought into\r\naction, and manœuvre so as to surprise and cut off his artillery and\r\nbaggage.\r\n\r\n4. The order of march should always be subservient to the order of\r\nbattle, which last should be arranged beforehand. The march of an army\r\nis always well regulated when it is governed by the distance to be\r\naccomplished, and by the time required for its performance. The front\r\nof the column of march should be diminished or increased according\r\nto the nature of the country, taking care that the artillery always\r\nproceeds by the main road.\r\n\r\nWhen a river is to be passed, the artillery should be placed in battery\r\nupon the bank opposite the point of crossing.\r\n\r\nIt is a great advantage, when a river forms a sweep or angle, and\r\nwhen a ford is to be found near the place where you wish to effect a\r\npassage. As the construction of the bridge proceeds, infantry should\r\nbe advanced to cover the workmen, by keeping up a fire on the opposite\r\nbank; but the moment it is finished, a corps of infantry and cavalry,\r\nand some field-pieces, should be pushed across. The infantry should\r\nentrench itself immediately at the head of the bridge, and it is\r\nprudent, moreover, to fortify on the same side of the river, in order\r\nto protect the bridge in case the enemy should venture an offensive\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guard of an army should be always provided with trusty\r\nguides, and with a corps of pioneers: the first to point out the best\r\nroads, the second to render these roads more practicable.\r\n\r\nIf the army marches in detachments, the commander of each detachment\r\nshould be furnished with the name of the place in writing, where the\r\nwhole are to be reassembled; the place should be sufficiently removed\r\nfrom the enemy to prevent him from occupying it before the junction of\r\nall the detachments. To this end, it is of importance to keep the name\r\na secret.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment an army approaches the enemy, it should march in\r\nthe order in which it is intended to fight. If anything is to be\r\napprehended, precautions are necessary in proportion to the degree of\r\nthe danger. When a defile is to be passed, the troops should be halted\r\nbeyond the extremity, until the whole army has quitted the defile.\r\n\r\nIn order to conceal the movements of an army, it is necessary to march\r\nby night through woods and valleys, by the most retired roads, and out\r\nof reach of all inhabited places. No fires should be allowed; and, to\r\nfavor the design still more, the troops should move by verbal order.\r\nWhen the object of the march is to carry a post, or to relieve a place\r\nthat is besieged, the advanced guard should march within musket shot of\r\nthe main body, because then you are prepared for an immediate attack,\r\nand ready to overthrow all before you.\r\n\r\nWhen a march is made to force a pass guarded by the enemy, it is\r\ndesirable to make a feint upon one point, while, by a rapid movement,\r\nyou bring your real attack to bear upon another.\r\n\r\nSometimes success is obtained by pretending to fall back upon the\r\noriginal line of march, and, by a sudden countermarch, seizing upon\r\nthe pass, before the enemy is able to reoccupy it. Some generals have\r\ngained their point by manœuvring so as to deceive the enemy, while a\r\ndetachment under the cover of high grounds has surprised the passage by\r\na stolen march. The enemy being engaged in watching the movements of\r\nthe main body, the detachment has an opportunity of entrenching itself\r\nin its new position.\r\n\r\n5. An army regulates its mode of encampment according to the greater or\r\nless degree of precaution, when circumstances require. In a friendly\r\ncountry the troops are divided, to afford better accommodation and\r\nsupplies. But with the enemy in front, an army should always encamp in\r\norder of battle. With this view, it is of the highest importance to\r\ncover one part of the camp, as far as practicable, by natural defences,\r\nsuch as a river, a chain of rocks, or a ravine. Care should be taken\r\nalso that the camp is not commanded, and that there is no obstacle to a\r\nfree communication between the different corps, and which can prevent\r\nthe troops from mutually succoring each other.\r\n\r\nWhen an army occupies a fixed camp, it is necessary to be well supplied\r\nwith provisions and ammunition, or at least that these should be\r\nwithin certain reach and easily obtained. To insure this, the line of\r\ncommunication must be well established, and care taken not to leave an\r\nenemy’s fortress in your rear.\r\n\r\nWhen an army is established in winter quarters, its safety is best\r\nsecured either by fortifying a camp (for which purpose a spot should be\r\nselected near a large commercial town, or a river affording facility\r\nof transport), or by distributing it in close cantonments, so that the\r\ntroops should be near together, and capable of affording each other\r\nmutual support.\r\n\r\nThe winter quarters of an army should be protected, likewise, by\r\nconstructing small covered works on all the lines of approach to the\r\ncantonments, and by posting advanced guards of cavalry to observe the\r\nmotions of the enemy.\r\n\r\n6. A battle is to be sought, when there is reason to hope for victory,\r\nor when an army runs the risk of being ruined without fighting; also\r\nwhen a besieged place is to be relieved, or when you desire to prevent\r\na reinforcement from reaching the enemy. Battles are useful, likewise,\r\nwhen we wish to profit by a favorable opportunity which offers, to\r\nsecure a certain advantage, such as seizing upon an undefended point or\r\npass, attacking the enemy when he has committed a fault, or when some\r\nmisunderstanding among his generals favors the undertaking.\r\n\r\nIf an enemy declines an engagement, he may be compelled to it, either\r\nby besieging a place of importance, or by falling upon him unawares,\r\nand when he cannot easily effect his retreat. Or (after pretending to\r\nretire), by making a rapid countermarch, attacking him vigorously and\r\nforcing him to action.\r\n\r\nThe different circumstances under which a battle should be avoided\r\nor declined, are, when there is greater danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom defeat than advantage to be derived from victory; when you\r\nare very inferior to your adversary in numbers, and are expecting\r\nreinforcements; above all, when the enemy is advantageously posted, or\r\nwhen he is contributing to his own ruin by some inherent defect in his\r\nposition, or by the errors and divisions of his generals.\r\n\r\nTo gain a battle, each arm must be advantageously posted, and have the\r\nmeans of engaging its front and in flank. The wings must be protected\r\nby natural obstacles, where these present themselves, or by having\r\nrecourse when necessary to the aid of art.\r\n\r\nThe troops must be able to assist each other without confusion, and\r\ncare must be taken that the broken corps do not fall back upon, and\r\nthrow the rest into disorder. Above all, the intervals between the\r\ndifferent corps must be sufficiently small to prevent the enemy from\r\npenetrating between them, for in that case you would be obliged to\r\nemploy your reserves, and run the risk of being entirely overwhelmed.\r\nSometimes victory is obtained by creating a diversion in the middle of\r\na battle, or even by depriving the soldier of all hope of retreat, and\r\nplacing him in a situation where he is reduced to the necessity either\r\nto conquer or die.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of a battle, if the ground is level, you should\r\nadvance to meet the enemy, in order to inspire the soldier with\r\ncourage; but if you are well posted, and your artillery advantageously\r\nplaced, then wait for him with determination: remembering always to\r\nfight resolutely, to succor opportunely those who require it, and never\r\nto bring your reserves into action except in the last extremity; and\r\neven then to preserve some support, behind which the broken corps may\r\nrally.\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to attack with your whole force, the battle\r\nshould commence toward evening; because then, whatever be the issue,\r\nnight will arrive to separate the combatants before your troops are\r\nexhausted. By this means, an opportunity is afforded of affecting an\r\norderly retreat if the result of the battle requires it.\r\n\r\nDuring an action, the general-in-chief should occupy some spot whence\r\nhe can, as far as possible, overlook his whole army. He should be\r\ninformed, immediately, of everything that passes in the different\r\ndivisions. He should be ready, in order to render success more\r\ncomplete, to operate with fresh troops upon those points where the\r\nenemy is giving way, and also to reinforce his own corps wherever they\r\nare inclined to yield. When the enemy is beaten, he must pursue him\r\ninstantly, without giving him a moment to rally; on the other hand, if\r\nhe is himself defeated, or despairs of victory, he must retreat in the\r\nbest possible order.\r\n\r\n7. It shows great talent in a general to bring troops, who are prepared\r\nfor action, into collision with those who are not: for example, fresh\r\ntroops against those which are exhausted--brave and disciplined men\r\nagainst recruits. He must likewise be ready always to fall with his\r\narmy upon a weak or detached corps, to follow the track of the enemy,\r\nand charge him among defiles before he can face about and get into\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n8. A position is good when the different corps are so placed as to be\r\nengaged with advantage, and without any remaining unemployed. If you\r\nare superior in cavalry, positions are to be taken in plains and open\r\nground; if in infantry, in an enclosed and covered country. If inferior\r\nin numbers, in confined and narrow places; if superior, in a spacious\r\nand extensive field. With a very inferior army, a difficult pass must\r\nbe selected to occupy and fortify.\r\n\r\n9. In order to obtain every possible advantage from a diversion, we\r\nshould ascertain first, that the country in which it is to be created\r\nis easily penetrated. A diversion should be made vigorously, and on\r\nthose points where it is calculated to do the greatest mischief to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n10. To make war with success, the following principles should never be\r\ndeparted from:\r\n\r\nTo be superior to your enemy in numbers, as well as in _morale_; to\r\nfight battles in order to spread terror in the country; to divide your\r\narmy into as many corps as may be effected without risk, in order to\r\nundertake several objects at the same time; to treat WELL those who\r\nyield, to ILL treat those who resist; to secure your rear, and occupy\r\nand strengthen yourself at the outset in some post which shall serve\r\nas a central point for the support of your future movements; to\r\nguard against desertion; to make yourself master of the great rivers\r\nand principal passes, and to establish your line of communication by\r\ngetting possession of the fortresses, by laying siege to them, and\r\nof the open country, by giving battle; for it is vain to expect that\r\nconquests are to be achieved without combats; although when a victory\r\nis won, they will be best maintained by uniting mildness with valor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA general-in-chief should ask himself frequently in the day: “What\r\nshould I do if the enemy’s army appeared now in my front, or on my\r\nright, or my left?” If he have any difficulty in answering these\r\nquestions, his position is bad, and he should seek to remedy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1758, the position of the Prussian army at Hohen\r\nKirk, being commanded by the batteries of the enemy, who occupied all\r\nthe heights, was eminently defective; notwithstanding, Frederick,\r\nwho saw his rear menaced by the corps of Laudon, remained six days\r\nin his camp without seeking to correct his position. It would seem,\r\nindeed, that he was ignorant of his real danger: for Marshal Daun,\r\nhaving manœuvred during the night in order to attack by daybreak,\r\nsurprised the Prussians in their lines before they were able to defend\r\nthemselves, and by this means surrounded them completely.\r\n\r\nFrederick succeeded, however, in effecting his retreat with regularity,\r\nbut not without the loss of ten thousand men, many general officers,\r\nand almost all of his artillery. If Marshal Daun had followed up his\r\nvictory with greater boldness, the king of Prussia would never have\r\nbeen able to rally his army. On this occasion, Frederick’s good fortune\r\nbalanced his imprudence.\r\n\r\nMarshal Saxe remarks, that there is more talent than is dreamt of in\r\nbad dispositions, if we possess the art of converting them into good\r\nones when the favorable moment arrives. Nothing astonishes the enemy\r\nso much as this manœuvre; he has counted upon _something_; all his\r\narrangements have been founded upon it accordingly--and at the moment\r\nof attack it escapes him! “I must repeat,” says the marshal, “there\r\nis nothing that so completely disconcerts an enemy as this, or leads\r\nhim to commit so many errors; for it follows, that if he does _not_\r\nchange his arrangements, he is beaten; and if he _does_ change them, in\r\npresence of his adversary, he is equally undone.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, however, that a general who should rest the success of\r\na battle upon such a principle, would be more likely to lose than to\r\ngain by it; for if he had to deal with a skilful adversary and an alert\r\ntactician, the latter would find time to take advantage of the previous\r\nbad arrangements, before he would be able to remedy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength of an army, like the power in mechanics, is estimated\r\nby multiplying the mass by the rapidity; a rapid march augments the\r\n_morale_ of an army, and increases its means of victory. Press on!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“Rapidity,” says Montécuculli, “is of importance in concealing the\r\nmovements of an army, because it leaves no time to divulge the\r\nintention of its chief. It is, therefore, an advantage to attack the\r\nenemy unexpectedly, to take him off his guard, to surprise him, and\r\nlet him feel the thunder before he sees the flash; but if too great\r\ncelerity exhausts your troops, while, on the other hand, delay deprives\r\nyou of the favorable moment, you must weigh the advantage against the\r\ndisadvantage, and choose between.”\r\n\r\nMarshal Villars observes, that “in war everything depends upon being\r\nable to deceive the enemy; and having once gained this point, in never\r\nallowing him time to recover himself.” Villars has united practice to\r\nprecept. His bold and rapid marches were almost always crowned with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Frederick that all wars should be short and\r\nrapid; because a long war insensibly relaxes discipline, depopulates\r\nthe state, and exhausts its resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an army is inferior in number, inferior in cavalry, and in\r\nartillery, it is essential to avoid a general action. The first\r\ndeficiency should be supplied by rapidity of movement; the want of\r\nartillery, by the nature of the manœuvres; and the inferiority in\r\ncavalry, by the choice of positions. In such circumstances, the\r\n_morale_ of the soldier does much.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1814 in France was skilfully executed upon these\r\nprinciples. Napoleon, with an army inferior in number, an army\r\ndiscouraged by the disastrous retreats of Moscow and of Leipzig, and\r\nstill more by the presence of the enemy in the French territory,\r\ncontrived, notwithstanding, to supply his vast inequality of force by\r\nthe rapidity and combination of his movements. By the success obtained\r\nat Champ-Aubert, Montmirail, Montereau, and Rheims, he began to restore\r\nthe _morale_ of the French army. The numerous recruits of which it\r\nwas composed, had already acquired that steadiness of which the old\r\nregiments afforded them an example, when the capture of Paris, and the\r\nastonishing revolution it produced, compelled Napoleon to lay down his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nBut this consequence resulted rather from the force of circumstances\r\nthan from any absolute necessity; for Napoleon, by carrying his army to\r\nthe other side of the Loire, might easily have formed a junction with\r\nthe armies of the Alps and Pyrenees, and have reappeared on the field\r\nof battle at the head of a hundred thousand men. Such a force would\r\nhave amply sufficed to re-establish the chances of war in his favor;\r\nmore especially as the armies of the allied sovereigns were obliged to\r\nmanœuvre upon the French territory with all the strong places of Italy\r\nand France in their rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo direct operations with lines far removed from each other, and\r\nwithout communications, is to commit a fault which always gives birth\r\nto a second. The detached column has only its orders for the first\r\nday. Its operations on the following day depend upon what may have\r\nhappened to the main body. Thus, this column either loses time upon\r\nemergency, in waiting for orders, or it will act without them, and at\r\nhazard. Let it therefore be held as a principle, that an army should\r\nalways keep its columns so united as to prevent the enemy from passing\r\nbetween them with impunity. Whenever, for particular reasons, this\r\nprinciple is departed from, the detached corps should be independent in\r\ntheir operations. They should move toward a point fixed upon for their\r\nfuture junction. They should advance without hesitating, and without\r\nwaiting for fresh orders; and every precaution should be taken to\r\nprevent an attack upon them in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian army, commanded by Field-marshal Alvinzi, was divided into\r\ntwo corps, destined to act independently, until they should accomplish\r\ntheir junction before Mantua. The first of these corps, consisting\r\nof forty-five thousand men, was under the orders of Alvinzi. It was\r\nto debouch by Monte Baldo, upon the positions occupied by the French\r\narmy on the Adige. The second corps, commanded by General Provéra,\r\nwas destined to act upon the lower Adige, and to raise the blockade\r\nof Mantua. Napoleon, informed of the enemy’s movements, but not\r\nentirely comprehending his projects, confined himself to concentrating\r\nhis masses, and giving orders to the troops to hold themselves in\r\nreadiness to manœuvre. In the meantime, fresh information satisfied the\r\ngeneral-in-chief of the French army that the corps which had debouched\r\nby La Coronna, over Monte Baldo, was endeavoring to form a junction\r\nwith its cavalry and artillery--both which, having crossed the Adige at\r\nDolce, were directing their march upon the plateau of Rivoli, by the\r\ngreat road leading by Incanole.\r\n\r\nNapoleon immediately foresaw that, by having possession of the plateau,\r\nhe should be able to prevent this junction, and obtain all the\r\nadvantages of the initiative. He accordingly put his troops in motion,\r\nand at two o’clock in the morning occupied that important position.\r\nOnce master of the point fixed upon for the junction of the Austrian\r\ncolumns, success followed all his dispositions. He repulsed every\r\nattack, made seven thousand prisoners, and took several standards and\r\ntwelve pieces of cannon. At two o’clock in the afternoon, the battle of\r\nRivoli was already gained, when Napoleon, learning that General Provéra\r\nhad passed the Adige at Anghiari, and was directing his march upon\r\nMantua, left to his generals the charge of following up the retreat of\r\nAlvinzi, and placed himself at the head of a division for the purpose\r\nof defeating the designs of Provéra.\r\n\r\nBy a rapid march, he again succeeded in the initiatory movement, and\r\nin preventing the garrison of Mantua from uniting its force with\r\nthe relieving army. The corps intrusted with the blockade, eager to\r\ndistinguish itself under the eyes of the conqueror of Rivoli, compelled\r\nthe garrison to retire into the place, while the division of Victor,\r\nforgetting the fatigues of a forced march, rushed with impetuosity on\r\nthe relieving army in front. At this moment a sortie from the lines\r\nof St. George took him in flank, while the corps of Augereau, which\r\nhad followed the march of the Austrian general, attacked him in rear.\r\nProvéra, surrounded on all sides, capitulated. The result of these two\r\nbattles cost the Austrians three thousand men in killed and wounded,\r\ntwenty-two thousand prisoners, twenty-four standards, and forty-six\r\npieces of cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn army ought to have only one line of operation. This should be\r\npreserved with care, and never abandoned but in the last extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“The line of communication of an army,” says Montécuculli, “must be\r\ncertain and well established, for every army that acts from a distant\r\nbase, and is not careful to keep this line perfectly open, marches upon\r\na precipice. It moves to certain ruin, as may be seen by an infinity\r\nof examples. In fact, if the road by which provisions, ammunition and\r\nreinforcements are to be brought up, is not entirely secured--if the\r\nmagazines, the hospitals, the depôts of arms, and the places of supply\r\nare not fixed and commodiously situated--not only the army cannot keep\r\nthe field, but it will be exposed to the greatest dangers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distances permitted between corps of an army upon the march must be\r\ngoverned by the localities, by circumstances, and by the object in view.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nWhen an army moves at a distance from the enemy, the columns may be\r\ndisposed along the road so as to favor the artillery and baggage. But\r\nwhen it is marching into action, the different corps must be formed in\r\nclose columns in order of battle. The generals must take care that the\r\nheads of the columns, which are to attack together, do not outstep each\r\nother, and that in approaching the field of action they preserve the\r\nrelative intervals required for deployment.\r\n\r\n“The marches that are made preparatory to a battle require,” says\r\nFrederick, “the greatest precaution.” With this view, he recommends\r\nhis generals to be particularly on their guard, and to reconnoitre\r\nthe ground at successive distances, in order to secure the initiative\r\nby occupying those positions most calculated to favor an attack. On\r\na retreat, it is the opinion of many generals that an army should\r\nconcentrate its forces, and march in close columns if it is still\r\nstrong enough to resume the offensive; for by this means it is easy\r\nto form the line when a favorable opportunity presents itself, either\r\nfor holding the enemy in check or for attacking him if he is not in a\r\nsituation to accept battle.\r\n\r\nSuch was Moreau’s retreat after the passage of the Adda by the\r\nAustro-Russian army. The French general, after having covered the\r\nevacuation of Milan, took up a position between the Po and the Tanaro.\r\n\r\nHis camp rested upon Alexandria and Valentia, two capital fortresses,\r\nand had the advantage of covering the roads to Turin and Savona, by\r\nwhich he could effect his retreat in case he was unable to accomplish a\r\njunction with the _corps d’armee_ of Macdonald, who had been ordered to\r\nquit the kingdom of Naples, and hasten his march into Tuscany.\r\n\r\nForced to abandon his position in consequence of the insurrection in\r\nPiedmont and Tuscany, Moreau retired upon Asti, where he learned that\r\nhis communication with the river of Genoa had just been cut off by the\r\ncapture of Ceva. After several ineffectual attempts to retake this\r\nplace, he saw that his only safety depended upon throwing himself into\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nTo effect this object, he directed the whole of his battering train\r\nand heavy baggage by the Col de Fenestrelle upon France; then opening\r\nhimself a way over the St. Bernard, he gained Loano with his light\r\nartillery and the small proportion of field equipment he had been able\r\nto preserve.\r\n\r\nBy this skilful movement, he not only retained his communications with\r\nFrance, but was enabled to observe the motions of the army from Naples,\r\nand to facilitate his junction with it by directing the whole of his\r\nforce upon the points necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, in the meantime, whose only chance of success depended on\r\nconcentrating his little army, neglected this precaution, and was\r\nbeaten in three successive actions at the Trebia.\r\n\r\nBy this retardment of his march, he rendered all Moreau’s measures to\r\nunite the two armies in the plains of the Po useless, and his retreat,\r\nafter his brilliant but fruitless efforts at the Trebia, defeated the\r\nother arrangements, also, which the former had made to come to his\r\nsupport. The inactivity of Marshal Suwarrow, however, finally enabled\r\nthe French general to accomplish his junction with the remains of the\r\narmy from Naples. Moreau then concentrated his whole force upon the\r\nAppenines, and placed himself in a situation to defend the important\r\npositions of Liguria, until the chances of war should afford him an\r\nopportunity of resuming the offensive.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a decisive battle, an army has lost its artillery and\r\nequipments, and is consequently no longer in a state to assume the\r\noffensive, or even to arrest the pursuit of the enemy, it would\r\nseem most desirable to divide what remains into several corps, and\r\norder them to march by separate and distant routes upon the base of\r\noperation, and throw themselves into the fortresses. This is the only\r\nmeans of safety: for the enemy, uncertain as to the precise direction\r\ntaken by the vanquished army, is ignorant in the first instance which\r\ncorps to pursue, and it is in this moment of indecision that a march is\r\ngained upon him. Besides, the movements of a small body being so much\r\neasier than those of a larger one, these separate lines of march are\r\nall in favor of a retreating army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong mountains, a great number of positions are always to be found\r\nvery strong in themselves, and which it is dangerous to attack. The\r\ncharacter of this mode of warfare consists in occupying camps on the\r\nflanks or in the rear of the enemy, leaving him only the alternative\r\nof abandoning his position without fighting, to take up another in\r\nthe rear, or to descend from it in order to attack you. In mountain\r\nwarfare, the assailant has always the disadvantage; even in offensive\r\nwarfare in the open field, the great secret consists in defensive\r\ncombats, and in obliging the enemy to attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1793, in the Maritime Alps, the French army,\r\nunder the orders of General Brunet, did all in its power to get\r\npossession of the camps at Raus and at Fourches, by an attack in front.\r\nBut these useless efforts served only to increase the courage of the\r\nPiedmontese, and to destroy the _élite_ of the grenadiers of the\r\nrepublican army. The manœuvres by which Napoleon, without fighting,\r\ncompelled the enemy to evacuate these positions in 1796, suffice to\r\nestablish the truth of these principles, and to prove how much success\r\nin war depends upon the genius of the general as well as on the courage\r\nof the soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first consideration with a general who offers battle, should be the\r\nglory and honor of his arms; the safety and preservation of his men is\r\nonly the second; but it is in the enterprise and courage resulting\r\nfrom the former, that the latter will most assuredly be found. In a\r\nretreat, besides the honor of the army, the loss of life is often\r\ngreater than in two battles. For this reason, we should never despair\r\nwhile brave men are to be found with their colors. It is by this means\r\nthat we obtain victory, and deserve to obtain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn 1645, the French army, under the orders of the Prince of Condé, was\r\non the march to lay siege to Nordlingen, when it was discovered that\r\nCount Merci, who commanded the Bavarians, had foreseen this intention,\r\nand had entrenched himself in a strong position which defended\r\nNordlingen at the same time that it covered Donawerth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the favorable position of the enemy, Condé ordered the\r\nattack. The combat was terrible. All the infantry in the centre and on\r\nthe right, after being successively engaged, was routed and dispersed,\r\nin spite of the efforts of the cavalry and the reserve, which were\r\nlikewise carried away with the fugitives. The battle was lost. Condé,\r\nin despair, having no longer either centre or right to depend upon,\r\ncollected the remnants of his battalions, and directed his march to the\r\nleft, where Turenne was still engaged. This perseverance reanimated\r\nthe ardor of the troops. They broke the right wing of the enemy,\r\nand Turenne, by a change of front, returned to the attack upon his\r\ncentre. Night, too, favored the boldness of Condé. An entire corps of\r\nBavarians, fancying themselves cut off, laid down their arms; and the\r\nobstinacy of the French general in this struggle for victory was repaid\r\nby possession of the field of battle, together with a great number of\r\nprisoners, and almost all the enemy’s artillery. The Bavarian army beat\r\na retreat, and the next day Nordlingen capitulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an approved maxim in war, never to do what the enemy wishes you\r\nto do, for this reason alone, that he desires it. A field of battle,\r\ntherefore, which he has previously studied and reconnoitred, should\r\nbe avoided, and double care should be taken where he has had time to\r\nfortify and entrench. One consequence deducible from this principle is,\r\nnever to attack a position in front which you can gain by turning.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt was without due regard to this principle, that Marshal Villeroi, on\r\nassuming the command of the army of Italy, during the campaign of 1701,\r\nattacked, with unwarrantable presumption, Prince Eugene, of Savoy, in\r\nhis entrenched position of Chiavi, on the Oglio. The French generals,\r\nCatinat among the rest, considered the post unassailable, but Villeroi\r\ninsisted, and the result of this otherwise unimportant battle was the\r\nloss of the _élite_ of the French army. It would have been greater\r\nstill, but for Catinat’s exertions.\r\n\r\nIt was by neglecting the same principle, that the Prince of Condé, in\r\nthe campaign of 1644, failed in all his attacks upon the entrenched\r\nposition of the Bavarian army. The Count Merci, who commanded the\r\nlatter, had drawn up his cavalry skilfully upon the plain, resting\r\nupon Freyberg, while his infantry occupied the mountain. After many\r\nfruitless attempts, the Prince of Condé, seeing the impossibility of\r\ndislodging the enemy, began to menace his communications--but the\r\nmoment Merci perceived this, he broke up his camp and retired beyond\r\nthe Black mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a war of march and manœuvre, if you would avoid a battle with a\r\nsuperior army, it is necessary to entrench every night, and occupy a\r\ngood defensive position. Those natural positions which are ordinarily\r\nmet with, are not sufficient to protect an army against superior\r\nnumbers without recourse to art.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the French and Spanish army, commanded by the Duke\r\nof Berwick, against the Portuguese, in the year 1706, affords a good\r\nlesson on this subject. The two armies made almost the tour of Spain.\r\nThey began the campaign near Badajoz, and after manœuvring across both\r\nCastiles, finished it in the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. The\r\nDuke of Berwick encamped his army eighty-five times, and although the\r\ncampaign passed without a general action, he took about ten thousand\r\nprisoners from the enemy. Marshal Turenne also made a fine campaign of\r\nmanœuvre against the Count Montécuculli, in 1675.\r\n\r\nThe imperial army having made its arrangements to pass the Rhine at\r\nStrasburg, Turenne used all diligence, and, throwing a bridge over the\r\nriver near the village of Ottenheim, three leagues below Strasburg, he\r\ncrossed with the French army, and encamped close to the little town\r\nof Vilstet, which he occupied. This position covered the bridge of\r\nStrasburg, so that, by this manœuvre, Turenne deprived the enemy of all\r\napproach to that city.\r\n\r\nUpon this, Montécuculli made a movement with his whole army,\r\nthreatening the bridge at Ottenheim, by which the French received their\r\nprovisions from upper Alsace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Turenne discovered the design of the enemy, he left a\r\ndetachment at Vilstet, and made a rapid march with his whole force\r\nupon the village of Altenheim. This intermediate position between\r\nthe two bridges, which he wished to preserve, gave him the advantage\r\nof being able to succor either of these posts before the enemy had\r\ntime to carry them. Montécuculli seeing that any successful attack\r\nupon the bridges was not to be expected, resolved to pass the Rhine\r\nbelow Strasburg, and with this view returned to his first position\r\nat Offenburg. Marshal Turenne, who followed all the movements of the\r\nAustrian army, brought back his army also to Vilstet.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, this attempt of the enemy having convinced the French\r\ngeneral of the danger to which his bridge had exposed him, removed it\r\nnearer to that of Strasburg, in order to diminish the extent of ground\r\nhe had to defend.\r\n\r\nMontécuculli, having commanded the magistrates of Strasburg to collect\r\nmaterials for a bridge, moved to Scherzheim to receive them; but\r\nTurenne again defeated his projects by taking a position at Freistett,\r\nwhere he occupied the islands of the Rhine, and immediately constructed\r\na stockade.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, during the whole of this campaign, Turenne succeeded\r\nin gaining the initiative of the enemy, and obliging him to follow\r\nhis movements. He succeeded, also, by a rapid march, in cutting off\r\nMontécuculli from the Town of Offenburg, whence he drew his supplies,\r\nand would no doubt have prevented the Austrian general from effecting\r\nhis junction with the corps of Caprara, had not a cannon-shot\r\nterminated this great man’s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA general of ordinary talent occupying a bad position, and surprised\r\nby a superior force, seeks his safety in retreat; but a great captain\r\nsupplies all deficiencies by his courage, and marches boldly to meet\r\nthe attack. By this means he disconcerts his adversary; and if the\r\nlatter shows any irresolution in his movements, a skilful leader,\r\nprofiting by his indecision, may even hope for victory, or at least\r\nemploy the day in manœuvring--at night he entrenches himself, or falls\r\nback to a better position. By this determined conduct he maintains the\r\nhonor of his arms, the first essential to all military superiority.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn 1653, Marshal Turenne was surprised by the Prince of Condé, in a\r\nposition where his army was completely compromised. He had the power,\r\nindeed, by an immediate retreat, of covering himself by the Somme,\r\nwhich he possessed the means of crossing at Peronne, and whence he\r\nwas distant only half a league; but, fearing the influence of this\r\nretrograde movement on the _morale_ of his army, Turenne balanced all\r\ndisadvantages by his courage, and marched boldly to meet the enemy with\r\nvery inferior forces. After marching a league, he found an advantageous\r\nposition, where he made every disposition for a battle. It was three\r\no’clock in the afternoon; but the Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue,\r\nhesitated to attack him, and Turenne having covered himself with\r\nentrenchments during the night, the enemy no longer dared to risk a\r\ngeneral action, and broke up his camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transition from the defensive to the offensive is one of the most\r\ndelicate operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nBy studying the first campaign of Napoleon in Italy, we can learn\r\nwhat genius and boldness may effect in passing with an army from the\r\n_defensive_ to the _offensive_. The army of the allies, commanded by\r\nGeneral Beaulieu, was provided with every means that could render it\r\nformidable. Its force amounted to eighty thousand men, and two hundred\r\npieces of cannon. The French army, on the contrary, could number\r\nscarcely thirty thousand men under arms, and thirty pieces of cannon.\r\nFor some time there had been no issue of meat, and even the bread\r\nwas irregularly supplied. The infantry was ill clothed, the cavalry\r\nwretchedly mounted. All the draught-horses had perished from want, so\r\nthat the service of the artillery was performed by mules. To remedy\r\nthese evils, large disbursements were necessary; and such was the state\r\nof the finances, that the government had only been able to furnish two\r\nthousand louis in specie for the opening of the campaign. The French\r\narmy could not possibly exist in this state. To advance or retreat was\r\nabsolutely necessary. Aware of the advantage of surprising the enemy\r\nat the very outset of the campaign by some decisive blow, Napoleon\r\nprepared for it by recasting the _morale_ of his army.\r\n\r\nIn a proclamation full of energy, he reminded them that an ignoble\r\ndeath alone remained for them, if they continued on the defensive;\r\nthat they had nothing to expect from France, but everything to hope\r\nfrom victory. “Abundance courts you in the fertile plains of Italy,”\r\nsaid he; “are you deficient, soldiers, in constancy or in courage?”\r\nProfiting by the moment of enthusiasm which he had inspired, Napoleon\r\nconcentrated his forces in order to fall with his whole weight on the\r\ndifferent corps of the enemy. Immediately afterward, the battles of\r\nMontenotte, Milesimo, and Mondovi, added fresh confidence to the high\r\nopinion already entertained by the soldier for his chief; and that army\r\nwhich only a few days ago was encamped amid barren rocks, and consumed\r\nby famine, already aspired to the conquest of Italy. In one month\r\nafter the opening of the campaign, Napoleon had terminated the war with\r\nthe King of Sardinia, and conquered the Milanese. Rich cantonments soon\r\ndispelled from the recollection of the French soldier the misery and\r\nfatigue attendant on this rapid march, while a vigilant administration\r\nof the resources of the country reorganized the _materiel_ of the\r\nFrench army, and created the means necessary for the attainment of\r\nfuture success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a principle, that the line of operation should\r\nnot be abandoned; but it is one of the most skilful manœuvres in war,\r\nto know how to change it, when circumstances authorize or render this\r\nnecessary. An army which changes skilfully its line of operation\r\ndeceives the enemy, who becomes ignorant where to look for its rear, or\r\nupon what weak points it is assailable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFrederick sometimes changed his line of operation in the middle of a\r\ncampaign; but he was enabled to do this, because he was manœuvring at\r\nthat time in the centre of Germany--an abundant country, capable of\r\nsupplying all the wants of his army in case his communications with\r\nPrussia were intercepted.\r\n\r\nMarshal Turenne, in the campaign of 1746, gave up his line of\r\ncommunication to the allies in the same manner; but, like Frederick,\r\nhe was carrying on the war at this time in the centre of Germany, and\r\nhaving fallen with his whole forces upon Rain, he took the precaution\r\nof securing to himself a depôt upon which to establish his base of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nBy a series of manœuvres, marked alike by audacity and genius, he\r\nsubsequently compelled the imperial army to abandon its magazines, and\r\nretire into Austria for winter quarters.\r\n\r\nBut these are examples which it appears to me should only be imitated\r\nwhen we have taken full measure of the capacity of our adversary, and\r\nabove all, when we see no reason to apprehend an insurrection in the\r\ncountry to which we transfer the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an army carries with it a battering train, or large convoys of\r\nsick and wounded, it cannot march by too short a line upon its depôts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt is above all in mountainous countries, and in those interspersed\r\nwith woods and marshes, that it is of importance to observe this maxim;\r\nfor, the convoys and means of transport being frequently embarrassed\r\nin defiles, an enemy by manœuvring may easily disperse the escorts, or\r\nmake even a successful attack upon the whole army, when it is obliged,\r\nfrom the nature of the country, to march in an extended column.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of encamping in position is the same as taking up the line in\r\norder of battle in this position. To this end, the artillery should be\r\nadvantageously placed, ground should be selected which is not commanded\r\nor liable to be turned, and, as far as possible, the guns should cover\r\nand command the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFrederick has remarked that, in order to be assured that your camp is\r\nwell placed, you should see if, by making a small movement, you can\r\noblige the enemy to make a greater; or, if after having forced him to\r\nretrograde one march you can compel him to fall back another.\r\n\r\nIn defensive war, all camps should be entrenched in the front and\r\nwings of the position they occupy, and care should be taken that the\r\nrear is left perfectly open. If you are threatened with being turned,\r\narrangements should be made beforehand for taking up a more distant\r\nposition; and you should profit by any disorder in the enemy’s line of\r\nmarch, to make an attempt upon his artillery or baggage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you are occupying a position which the enemy threatens to\r\nsurround, collect all your force immediately, and menace _him_ with\r\nan offensive movement. By this manœuvre, you will prevent him from\r\ndetaching and annoying your flanks in case you should judge it\r\nnecessary to retire.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis was the manœuvre practised by General Desaix, in 1798, near\r\nRadstadt. He made up for inferiority in numbers by audacity, and\r\nmaintained himself the whole day in position in spite of the vigorous\r\nattacks of the Archduke Charles. At night he effected his retreat in\r\ngood order, and took up a position in the rear.\r\n\r\nIt was in accordance, also, with this principle, in the same campaign,\r\nthat General Moreau gave battle at Biberach, to secure his retreat\r\nby the passes of the Black mountains. A few days after, he fought at\r\nSchliengen with the same object. Placed in a good defensive position,\r\nhe menaced the Archduke Charles by a sudden return to the offensive,\r\nwhile his artillery and baggage were passing the Rhine by the bridge of\r\nHuningen, and he was making all the necessary arrangements for retiring\r\nbehind that river himself.\r\n\r\nHere, however, I would observe, that the execution of such offensive\r\ndemonstrations should be deferred always till toward the evening, in\r\norder that you may not be compromised by engaging too early in a combat\r\nwhich you cannot long maintain with success.\r\n\r\nNight, and the uncertainty of the enemy after an affair of this kind,\r\nwill always favor your retreat, if it is judged necessary; but,\r\nwith a view to mask the operation more effectually, fires should be\r\nlighted all along the lines, to deceive the enemy and prevent him from\r\ndiscovering this retrograde movement, for in a retreat it is a great\r\nadvantage to gain a march upon your adversary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever lose sight of this maxim: that you should establish your\r\ncantonments at the most distant and best-protected point from the\r\nenemy, especially where a surprise is possible. By this means you will\r\nhave time to unite all your forces before he can attack you.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1745, Marshal Turenne lost the battle of Marienthal,\r\nby neglecting this principle; for if, instead of reassembling his\r\ndivisions at Erbsthausen, he had rallied his troops at Mergentheim,\r\nbehind the Tauber, his army would have been much sooner reunited; and\r\nCount Merci, in place of finding only three thousand men to fight at\r\nErbsthausen (of which he was well informed), would have had the whole\r\nFrench army to attack in a position covered by a river.\r\n\r\nSome one having indiscreetly asked Viscount Turenne how he had lost the\r\nbattle of Marienthal: “By my own fault,” replied the marshal; “but,”\r\nadded he, “when a man has committed no faults in war, he can only have\r\nbeen engaged in it but a short time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen two armies are in order of battle, and one has to retire over a\r\nbridge, while the other has the circumference of the circle open, all\r\nthe advantages are in favor of the latter. It is then a general should\r\nshow boldness, strike a decided blow, and manœuvre upon the flank of\r\nhis enemy. The victory is in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis was the position of the French army at the famous battle of\r\nLeipzig, which terminated the campaign of 1813 so fatally for Napoleon;\r\nfor the battle of Hanau was of no consequence, comparatively, in the\r\ndesperate situation of that army.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that, in a situation like that of the French army\r\nprevious to the battle of Leipzig, a general should never calculate\r\nupon any of those lucky chances which may arise out of a return to the\r\noffensive, but that he should rather adopt every possible means to\r\nsecure his retreat. With this view, he should immediately cover himself\r\nwith good entrenchments, to enable him to repel with inferior numbers\r\nthe attack of the enemy, while his own equipments are crossing the\r\nriver. As fast as the troops reach the other side, they should occupy\r\npositions to protect the passage of the rear guard, and this last\r\nshould be covered by a _tête de pont_ as soon as the army breaks up its\r\ncamp. During the wars of the Revolution, too little regard was paid\r\nto entrenchments; and it is for this reason we have seen large armies\r\ndispersed after a single reverse, and the fate of nations compromised\r\nby the issue of one battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is contrary to all true principle, to make corps, which have no\r\ncommunication with each other, act separately against a central force\r\nwhose communications are cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians lost the battle of Hohenlinden by neglecting this\r\nprinciple. The imperial army, under the orders of the archduke John,\r\nwas divided into four columns, which had to march through an immense\r\nforest, previous to their junction in the plain of Anzing, where they\r\nintended to surprise the French. But these different corps, having no\r\ndirect communication, found themselves compelled to engage separately\r\nwith an enemy who had taken the precaution of concentrating his masses,\r\nand who could move them with facility in a country with which he had\r\nbeen long previously acquainted.\r\n\r\nThus the Austrian army, enclosed in the defiles of the forest with its\r\nwhole train of artillery and baggage, was attacked in its flanks and\r\nrear, and the archduke John was only enabled to rally his dispersed and\r\nshattered divisions under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nThe trophies obtained by the French army on this day were immense. They\r\nconsisted of eleven thousand prisoners, one hundred pieces of cannon,\r\nseveral stand of colors, and all the baggage of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Hohenlinden decided the fate of the campaign of 1800, and\r\nMoreau’s brilliant and well-merited success placed him in the rank of\r\nthe first general of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an army is driven from a first position, the retreating columns\r\nshould rally always sufficiently in the rear, to prevent any\r\ninterruption from the enemy. The greatest disaster that can happen, is\r\nwhen the columns are attacked in detail, and before their junction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage which results from rallying your columns on a point\r\nfar removed from the field of battle, or from the position previously\r\noccupied, is, that the enemy is uncertain as to the direction you mean\r\nto take.\r\n\r\nIf he divides his force to pursue you, he exposes himself to see his\r\ndetachments beaten in detail, especially if you have exerted all due\r\ndiligence, and have effected the junction of your troops in sufficient\r\ntime to get between his columns and disperse them one after the other.\r\n\r\nIt was by a manœuvre of this kind in the campaign of Italy, in 1799,\r\nthat General Melas gained the battle of Genola.\r\n\r\nGeneral Championet commanded the French army, and endeavored to cut off\r\nthe communication of the Austrians with Turin, by employing corps which\r\nmanœuvred separately to get into their rear. Melas, who divined his\r\nproject, made a retrograde march, by which he persuaded his adversary\r\nhe was in full retreat, although the real object of his movement was\r\nto concentrate his forces at the point fixed for the junction of\r\nthe different detachments of the French army, and which he beat and\r\ndispersed, one after another, by his great superiority in numbers. The\r\nresult of this manœuvre, in which the Austrian general displayed vigor,\r\ndecision, and foresight, secured to him the peaceable possession of\r\nPiedmont.\r\n\r\nIt was also by the neglect of this principle that General Beaulieu, who\r\ncommanded the Austro-Sardinian army in the campaign of 1796, lost the\r\nbattle of Milesimo after that of Montenotte.\r\n\r\nHis object, in endeavoring to rally his different corps upon Milesimo,\r\nwas, to cover the high roads of Turin and Milan; but Napoleon, aware of\r\nthe advantages arising from the ardor of troops emboldened by recent\r\nsuccess, attacked him before he could assemble his divisions, and, by\r\na series of skilful manœuvres, succeeded in separating the combined\r\narmies. They retired in the greatest disorder--the one by the road of\r\nMilan, the other by that of Turin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo force should be detached on the eve of a battle, because affairs may\r\nchange during the night, either by the retreat of the enemy, or by the\r\narrival of large reinforcements to enable him to resume the offensive,\r\nand counteract your previous arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the army of the Sambre and Meuse, commanded by General\r\nJourdan, effected a retreat, which was rendered still more difficult\r\nby the loss of his line of communication. Seeing, however, that the\r\nforces of the archduke Charles were scattered, Jourdan, in order to\r\naccomplish his retreat upon Frankfort, resolved to open himself a way\r\nby Wurtzburg, where there were at that moment only two divisions of\r\nthe Austrian army. This movement would have been attended with success,\r\nif the French general, believing he had simply these two divisions to\r\ncontend with, had not committed the error of separating himself from\r\nthe corps of Lefevre--which he left at Schweinfurt to cover the only\r\ndirect communication of the army with its base of operation.\r\n\r\nThe commission of this fault at the outset, added to some slowness in\r\nthe march of the French general, secured the victory to the archduke,\r\nwho hastened to concentrate his forces.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the two divisions, also, of Kray and Wartesleben, during\r\nthe battle, enabled him to oppose fifty thousand men to the French\r\narmy, which scarcely numbered thirty thousand combatants. This last\r\nwas consequently beaten, and obliged to continue its retreat by the\r\nmountains of Fuldes, where the badness of the roads could be equalled\r\nonly by the difficulty of the country.\r\n\r\nThe division of Lefevre, amounting to fourteen thousand men, would,\r\nin all probability, have turned the scale in favor of Jourdan, had\r\nthe latter not unfortunately conceived that two divisions only were\r\nopposing his passage to Wurtzburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you have resolved to fight a battle, collect your whole force.\r\nDispense with nothing. A single battalion sometimes decides the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nI think it here desirable to observe, that it is prudent before a\r\nbattle to fix upon some point in rear of the reserve for the junction\r\nof the different detachments; for if, from unforeseen circumstances,\r\nthese detachments should be prevented from joining before the action\r\nhas commenced, they might be exposed, in case a retrograde movement\r\nshould be found necessary, to the masses of the enemy. It is desirable\r\nalso to keep the enemy in ignorance of these reinforcements, in order\r\nto employ them with greater effect. “A seasonable reinforcement,” says\r\nFrederick, “renders the success of a battle certain, because the enemy\r\nwill always imagine it stronger than it really is, and lose courage\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is so rash or so contrary to principle, as to make a flank\r\nmarch before an army in position, especially when this army occupies\r\nheights at the foot of which you are forced to defile.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt was by a neglect of this principle that Frederick was beaten at\r\nKollin in the first campaign of 1757. Notwithstanding prodigies of\r\nvalor, the Prussians lost fifteen thousand men and a great portion of\r\ntheir artillery, while the loss of the Austrians did not exceed five\r\nthousand men. The consequence of this battle was more unfortunate\r\nstill, since it obliged the King of Prussia to raise the siege of\r\nPrague, and to evacuate Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIt was also by making a flank march before the Prussian army, that the\r\nFrench lost the disgraceful battle of Rosbach.\r\n\r\nThis imprudent movement was still more to be reprehended, because the\r\nPrince de Soubise, who commanded the French army, was so negligent as\r\nto manœuvre, without either advanced guards or flanking corps, in\r\npresence of the enemy. The result was, that his army, consisting of\r\nfifty thousand men, was beaten by six battalions and thirty squadrons.\r\nThe French lost seven thousand men, twenty-seven standards, and a great\r\nnumber of cannon. The Prussians had only three hundred men disabled.\r\n\r\nThus, by having forgotten this principle, _that a flank march is never\r\nto be made before an enemy in line of battle_, Frederick lost his army\r\nat Kollin; and Soubise, at Rosbach, lost both his army and his honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you determine to risk a battle, reserve to yourself every possible\r\nchance of success, more particularly if you have to deal with an\r\nadversary of superior talent; for if you are beaten, even in the midst\r\nof your magazines and your communications, wo to the vanquished!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“We should make war,” says Marshal Saxe, “without leaving anything\r\nto hazard, and in this especially consists the talent of a general.\r\nBut when we have incurred the risk of a battle, we should know how to\r\nprofit by the victory, and not merely content ourselves, according to\r\ncustom, with possession of the field.”\r\n\r\nIt was by neglecting to follow up the first success, that the Austrian\r\narmy, after gaining the field of Marengo, saw itself compelled on the\r\nfollowing day to evacuate the whole of Italy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Melas, observing the French in retreat, left the direction\r\nof the movements of his army to the chief of his staff, and retired\r\nto Alexandria to repose from the fatigues of the day. Colonel Zach,\r\nequally convinced with his general that the French army was completely\r\nbroken, and consisted only of fugitives, formed the divisions in column\r\nof route.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement, the imperial army prepared to enter upon its\r\nvictorious march in a formation not less than three miles in depth.\r\n\r\nIt was near four o’clock when General Desaix rejoined the French army\r\nwith his division. His presence restored in some degree an equality\r\nbetween the contending forces; and yet Napoleon hesitated for a moment\r\nwhether to resume the offensive, or to make use of this corps to secure\r\nhis retreat. The ardor of the troops to return to the charge, decided\r\nhis irresolution. He rode rapidly along the front of his divisions, and\r\naddressing the soldiers--“We have retired far enough for to-day,” said\r\nhe; “you know I always sleep upon the field of battle!”\r\n\r\nThe army, with unanimous shout, proclaimed to him a promise of\r\nvictory. Napoleon resumed the offensive. The Austrian advance guard,\r\npanic-struck at the sight of a formidable and unbroken body presenting\r\nitself suddenly at a point where, a few moments before, only fugitives\r\nwere to be seen, went to the right about, and carried disorder into the\r\nmass of its columns. Attacked immediately afterward, with impetuosity,\r\nin its front and flanks, the Austrian army was completely routed.\r\n\r\nMarshal Daun experienced nearly the same fate as General Melas, at the\r\nbattle of Torgau, in the campaign of 1760.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Austrian army was excellent. It had its left upon\r\nTorgau, its right on the plateau of Siptitz, and its front covered by a\r\nlarge sheet of water.\r\n\r\nFrederick proposed to turn its right in order to make an attack upon\r\nthe rear. For this purpose he divided his army into two corps, the one\r\nunder the orders of Ziethen, with instructions to attack in front,\r\nfollowing the edge of the water; the other under his own immediate\r\ncommand, with which he set out to turn the right of the Austrians.\r\nBut Marshal Daun having had intimation of the movements of the enemy,\r\nchanged his front by countermarching, and was thus enabled to repel\r\nthe attacks of Frederick, whom he obliged to retreat. The two corps\r\nof the Prussian army had been acting without communication. Ziethen,\r\nin the meantime, hearing the fire recede, concluded that the king had\r\nbeen beaten, and commenced a movement by his left in order to rejoin\r\nhim; but falling in with two battalions of the reserve, the Prussian\r\ngeneral profited by this reinforcement to resume the offensive.\r\nAccordingly he renewed the attack with vigor, got possession of the\r\nplateau of Siptitz, and soon after of the whole field of battle. The\r\nsun had already set when the King of Prussia received the news of this\r\nunexpected good fortune. He returned in all haste, took advantage of\r\nthe night to restore order in his disorganized army, and the day after\r\nthe battle occupied Torgau.\r\n\r\nMarshal Daun was receiving congratulations upon his victory, when he\r\nheard that the Prussians had resumed the offensive. He immediately\r\ncommanded a retreat, and at daybreak the Austrians repassed the Elbe\r\nwith the loss of twelve thousand men, eight thousand prisoners, and\r\nforty-five pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Marengo, General Melas, although in the midst\r\nof his fortresses and magazines, saw himself compelled to abandon\r\neverything, in order to save the wreck of his army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mack capitulated after the battle of Ulm, although in the\r\ncentre of his own country.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians, in spite of their depôts and reserves, were obliged,\r\nafter the battle of Jena, and the French after that of Waterloo, to lay\r\ndown their arms.\r\n\r\nHence, we may conclude that the misfortune that results from the loss\r\nof a battle, does not consist so much in the destruction of men and of\r\n_materiel_ as in the discouragement which follows this disaster. The\r\ncourage and confidence of the victors augment in proportion as those\r\nof the vanquished diminish; and whatever may be the resources of an\r\narmy, it will be found that a retreat will degenerate rapidly into a\r\nrout unless the general-in-chief shall succeed, by combining boldness\r\nwith skill, and perseverance with firmness, in restoring the _morale_\r\nof his army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duty of an advanced guard does not consist in advancing or\r\nretiring, but in manœuvring. An advanced guard should be composed\r\nof light cavalry, supported by a reserve of heavy cavalry, and by\r\nbattalions of infantry, supported also by artillery. An advanced guard\r\nshould consist of picked troops, and the general officers, officers\r\nand men, should be selected for their respective capabilities and\r\nknowledge. A corps deficient in instruction is only an embarrassment to\r\nan advanced guard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Frederick that an advanced guard should be\r\ncomposed of detachments of troops of all arms. The commander should\r\npossess skill in the choice of ground, and he should take care to be\r\ninstantly informed, by means of numerous patrols, of everything passing\r\nin the enemy’s camp.\r\n\r\nIn war, it is not the business of an advanced guard to fight, but to\r\nobserve the enemy, in order to cover the movements of the army. When in\r\npursuit, the advanced guard should charge with vigor, and cut off the\r\nbaggage and insulated corps of the retiring enemy. For this purpose, it\r\nshould be reinforced with all the disposable light cavalry of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is contrary to the usages of war to allow parks or batteries of\r\nartillery to enter a defile, unless you hold the other extremity. In\r\ncase of retreat, the guns will embarrass your movements and be lost.\r\nThey should be left in position, under a sufficient escort, until you\r\nare master of the opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nNothing encumbers the march of an army so much as a quantity of\r\nbaggage. In the campaign of 1796, Napoleon abandoned his battering\r\ntrain under the walls of Mantua, after spiking the guns and destroying\r\nthe carriages. By this sacrifice, he acquired a facility of manœuvring\r\nrapidly his little army, and obtained the initiative as well as a\r\ngeneral superiority over the numerous but divided forces of Marshal\r\nWurmser.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, during his retreat in Italy, General Moreau being compelled\r\nto manœuvre among the mountains, preferred separating himself entirely\r\nfrom his reserve artillery, which he directed upon France by the Col\r\nde Fenestrelle, rather than embarrass his march with this part of his\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nThese are the examples we should follow; for if, by a rapidity of\r\nmarch, and a facility of concentration upon decisive points, the\r\nvictory is gained, the _materiel_ of an army is soon re-established.\r\nBut if, on the other hand, we are beaten and compelled to retreat, it\r\nwill be difficult to save our equipments, and we may have reason to\r\ncongratulate ourselves that we abandoned them in time to prevent them\r\nfrom augmenting the trophies of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be laid down as a principle, never to leave intervals by\r\nwhich the enemy can penetrate between corps formed in order of battle,\r\nunless it be to draw him into a snare.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1757, the Prince of Lorraine, who was covering\r\nPrague with the Austrian army, perceived the Prussians threatening, by\r\na flank movement, to turn his right. He immediately ordered a partial\r\nchange of front by throwing back the infantry of that wing, so as to\r\nform a right angle with the rest of the line. But this manœuvre being\r\nexecuted in presence of the enemy, was not effected without some\r\ndisorder. The heads of the columns having marched too quick, caused\r\nthe rear to lengthen out, and when the line was formed to the right,\r\na large interval appeared at the salient angle. Frederick, observing\r\nthis error, hastened to take advantage of it. He directed his centre\r\ncorps, commanded by the Duke of Bevern, to throw itself into this\r\nopening, and by this manœuvre decided the fate of the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Lorraine returned to Prague, beaten and pursued, with the\r\nloss of sixteen thousand men and two hundred pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed at the same time, that this operation of throwing\r\na corps into the intervals made by an army in time of battle, should\r\nnever be attempted unless you are at least equal in force, and have\r\nan opportunity of outflanking the enemy on the one side or the other;\r\nfor it is then only you can hope to divide his army in the centre, and\r\ninsulate the wings entirely. If you are inferior in number, you run the\r\nrisk of being stopped by the reverses, and overpowered by the enemy’s\r\nwings, which may deploy upon your flanks and surround you.\r\n\r\nIt was by this manœuvre that the Duke of Berwick gained the battle of\r\nAlmanza, in the year 1707, in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Portuguese army, under the command of Lord Galloway, came to\r\ninvest Villena. Marshal Berwick, who commanded the French and Spanish\r\narmy, quitted his camp at Montalegre, and moved upon this town to\r\nraise the siege. At his approach, the English general, eager to fight\r\na battle, advanced to meet him in the plains of Almanza. The issue was\r\nlong doubtful. The first line, commanded by the Duke of Popoli, having\r\nbeen broken, the Chevalier d’Asfeldt, who had charge of the second,\r\ndrew up his masses with large intervals between them; and when the\r\nEnglish, who were in pursuit of the first line, reached these reserves,\r\nhe took advantage of their disorder to attack them in flank and\r\ndefeated them entirely.\r\n\r\nMarshal Berwick, perceiving the success of this manœuvre, threw open\r\nhis front, and deploying upon the enemy’s flanks, while the reserve\r\nsustained the attack in front, and the cavalry manœuvred in their rear,\r\nobtained a complete victory.\r\n\r\nLord Galloway, wounded and pursued, collected with difficulty the\r\nremains of his army, and took shelter with them in Tortosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEncampments of the same army should always be formed so as to protect\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Dresden, in the campaign of 1813, the camp of the\r\nallies, although advantageously placed upon the heights on the left\r\nbank of the Elbe, was nevertheless extremely defective, from being\r\ntraversed longitudinally by a deep ravine, which separated the left\r\nwing completely from the centre and the right. This vicious arrangement\r\ndid not escape the penetrating eye of Napoleon. He instantly directed\r\nthe whole of his cavalry and two corps of infantry against the\r\ninsulated wing, attacked it with superior numbers, overthrew it, and\r\ntook ten thousand prisoners, before it was possible to come to its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy’s army is covered by a river, upon which he holds\r\nseveral _têtes de pont_, do not attack in front. This would divide\r\nyour force and expose you to be turned. Approach the river in echelon\r\nof columns, in such a manner that the leading column shall be the\r\nonly one the enemy can attack, without offering you his flank. In\r\nthe meantime, let your light troops occupy the bank, and when you\r\nhave decided on the point of passage, rush upon it and fling across\r\nyour bridge. Observe that the point of passage should be always at a\r\ndistance from the leading echelon, in order to deceive the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIf you occupy a town or a village on the bank of a river, opposite\r\nto that held by the enemy, it is an advantage to make this spot the\r\ncrossing point, because it is easier to cover your carriages and\r\nreserve artillery, as well as to mask the construction of your bridge,\r\nin a town, than in the open country. It is also a great advantage\r\nto pass a river opposite a village, when the latter is only weakly\r\noccupied by the enemy; because as soon as the advanced guard reaches\r\nthe other side, it carries this post, makes a lodgment, and by\r\nthrowing up a few defensive works, converts it easily into a _tête de\r\npont_. By this means, the rest of the army is enabled to effect the\r\npassage with facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you are master of a position which commands the\r\nopposite bank, facilities are acquired for effecting the passage of\r\nthe river; above all, if this position is sufficiently extensive to\r\nplace upon it artillery in force. This advantage is diminished, if\r\nthe river is more than three hundred toises (or six hundred yards)\r\nin breadth, because the distance being out of the range of grape, it\r\nis easy for the troops which defend the passage to line the bank and\r\nget under cover. Hence it follows that if the grenadiers, ordered to\r\npass the river for the protection of the bridge, should reach the\r\nother side, they would be destroyed by the fire of the enemy; because\r\nhis batteries, placed at the distance of two hundred toises from the\r\nlanding, are capable of a most destructive effect, although removed\r\nabove five hundred toises from the batteries of the crossing force.\r\nThus the advantage of the artillery would be exclusively his. For\r\nthe same reason, the passage is impracticable, unless you succeed in\r\nsurprising the enemy, and are protected by an intermediate island, or,\r\nunless you are able to take advantage of an angle in the river, to\r\nestablish a crossfire upon his works. In this case, the island or angle\r\nforms a natural _tête de pont_, and gives the advantage in artillery to\r\nthe attacking army.\r\n\r\nWhen a river is less than sixty toises (or one hundred and twenty\r\nyards) in breadth, and you have a post upon the other side, the troops\r\nwhich are thrown across derive such advantages from the protection of\r\nyour artillery, that, however small the angle may be, it is impossible\r\nfor the enemy to prevent the establishment of a bridge. In this case,\r\nthe most skilful generals, when they have discovered the project of\r\ntheir adversary, and brought their own army to the point of crossing,\r\nusually content themselves with opposing the passage of the bridge, by\r\nforming a semicircle round its extremity, as round the opening of a\r\ndefile, and removing to the distance of three or four hundred toises\r\nfrom the fire of the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFrederick observes, that “the passage of great rivers in the presence\r\nof the enemy is one of the most delicate operations in war.” Success on\r\nthese occasions depends on secrecy, on the rapidity of the manœuvres,\r\nand the punctual execution of the orders given for the movements of\r\neach division. To pass such an obstacle in presence of an enemy, and\r\nwithout his knowledge, it is necessary not only that the previous\r\ndispositions should be well conceived, but that they should be executed\r\nwithout confusion.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1705, Prince Eugene, of Savoy, wishing to come to\r\nthe assistance of the Prince of Piedmont, sought for a favorable point\r\nat which to force the passage of the Adda, defended at that time by\r\nthe French army, under the command of the Duke de Vendome.\r\n\r\nAfter having selected an advantageous situation, Prince Eugene erected\r\na battery of twenty pieces of cannon on a position which commanded the\r\nentire of the opposite bank, and covered his infantry by a line of\r\nentrenched parallels constructed on the slope of the declivity.\r\n\r\nThey were working vigorously at the bridge, when the Duke de Vendome\r\nappeared with his whole army. At first he seemed determined to oppose\r\nits construction, but after having examined the position of Prince\r\nEugene, he judged this to be impracticable.\r\n\r\nHe therefore placed his army out of reach of the prince’s batteries,\r\nresting both his wings upon the river, so as to form a bow, of which\r\nthe Adda was the cord. He then covered himself with entrenchments and\r\nabattis, and was thus enabled to charge the enemy’s columns whenever\r\nthey debouched from the bridge, and to beat them in detail.\r\n\r\nEugene, having reconnoitred the position of the French, considered the\r\npassage impossible. He therefore withdrew the bridge, and broke up his\r\ncamp during the night.\r\n\r\nIt was by this manœuvre, also, that, in the campaign of 1809, the\r\nArchduke Charles compelled the French to reoccupy the isle of Lobau,\r\nafter having debouched on the left bank of the Danube. The march of the\r\nArchduke Charles was wholly concentric. He menaced Grosaspern with his\r\nright, Esling with his centre, and Enzersdorf with his left.\r\n\r\nHis army, with both wings resting on the Danube, formed a semicircle\r\naround Esling. Napoleon immediately attacked and broke the centre of\r\nthe Austrians; but after having forced their first line, he found\r\nhimself arrested by the reserves. In the meantime, the bridges upon\r\nthe Danube had been destroyed, and several of his corps, with their\r\nparks of artillery, were still on the right bank. This disappointment,\r\njoined to the favorable position of the Austrians, decided Napoleon\r\nto re-enter the isle of Lobau, where he had previously constructed a\r\nline of field-works, so as to give it all the advantages of a well\r\nentrenched camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to prevent an enemy, supplied with pontoons, from\r\ncrossing a river. When the object of an army, which defends the\r\npassage, is to cover a siege, the moment the general has ascertained\r\nhis inability to oppose the passage, he should take measures to arrive\r\nbefore the enemy, at an intermediate position between the river he\r\ndefends and the place he desires to cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nHere we may observe, that this intermediate position should be\r\nreconnoitred, or rather, well entrenched beforehand; for the enemy will\r\nbe unable to make an offensive movement against the corps employed in\r\nthe siege, until he has beaten the army of observation; and the latter,\r\nunder cover of its camp, may always await a favorable opportunity to\r\nattack him in flank or in rear.\r\n\r\nBesides, the army which is once entrenched in this manner, has the\r\nadvantage of being concentrated; while that of the enemy must act in\r\ndetachments, if he wishes to cover his bridge, and watch the movements\r\nof the army of observation, so as to enable him to attack the besieging\r\ncorps in its lines, without being exposed to an attempt on his rear, or\r\nbeing menaced with the loss of his bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1645, Turenne was attacked with his army before\r\nPhilipsburg by a very superior force. There was no bridge here over\r\nthe Rhine, but he took advantage of the ground between the river and\r\nthe place to establish his camp. This should serve as a lesson to\r\nengineer officers, not merely in the construction of fortresses, but\r\nof _têtes de pont_. A space should always be left between the fortress\r\nand the river, where an army may form and rally without being obliged\r\nto throw itself into the place, and thereby compromise its security.\r\nAn army retiring upon Mayence before a pursuing enemy, is necessarily\r\ncompromised; for this reason, because it requires more than a day to\r\npass the bridge, and because the lines of Cassel are too confined to\r\nadmit an army to remain there without being blocked up. Two hundred\r\ntoises should have been left between that place and the Rhine. It\r\nis essential that all _têtes de pont_ before great rivers should be\r\nconstructed upon this principle, otherwise they will prove a very\r\ninefficient assistance to protect the passage of a retreating army.\r\n_Têtes de pont_, as laid down in our schools, are of use only for small\r\nrivers, the passage of which is comparatively short.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nMarshal Saxe, in the campaign of 1741, having passed the Moldau in\r\nquest of a detached corps of fourteen thousand men, which was about to\r\nthrow itself into Prague, left a thousand infantry upon that river,\r\nwith orders to entrench themselves upon a height directly opposite the\r\n_tête de pont_. By this precaution, the marshal secured his retreat,\r\nand also the facility of repassing the bridge without disorder, by\r\nrallying his divisions between the entrenched height and the _tête de\r\npont_.\r\n\r\nWere these examples unknown to the generals of modern times, or are\r\nthey disposed to think such precautions superfluous?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortresses are equally useful in offensive and defensive warfare. It\r\nis true, they will not in themselves arrest an army, but they are an\r\nexcellent means of retarding, embarrassing, weakening and annoying a\r\nvictorious enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant success of the allied armies in the campaign of 1814, has\r\ngiven to many military men a false idea of the real value of fortresses.\r\n\r\nThe formidable bodies which crossed the Rhine and the Alps at this\r\nperiod, were enabled to spare large detachments to blockade the strong\r\nplaces that covered the frontiers of France, without materially\r\naffecting the numerical superiority of the army which marched upon the\r\ncapital. This army was in a condition, therefore, to act, without the\r\nfear of being menaced in its line of retreat.\r\n\r\nBut at no period of military history were the armies of Europe so\r\ncombined before, or governed so entirely by one common mind in the\r\nattainment of a single object. Under these circumstances, the line of\r\nfortresses which surround France was rendered unavailable during the\r\ncampaign; but it would be very imprudent, therefore, to conclude that\r\na frontier guarded by numerous fortresses may be passed with impunity;\r\nor that battles may be fought with these places in your rear, without\r\npreviously besieging, or at least investing them with sufficient forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only two ways of insuring the success of a siege. The first,\r\nto begin by beating the enemy’s army employed to cover the place,\r\nforcing it out of the field, and throwing its remains beyond some great\r\nnatural obstacle, such as a chain of mountains, or large river. Having\r\naccomplished this object, an army of observation should be placed\r\nbehind the natural obstacle, until the trenches are finished and the\r\nplace taken.\r\n\r\nBut if it be desired to take the place in presence of a relieving army,\r\nwithout risking a battle, then the whole _materiel_ and equipment for\r\na siege are necessary to begin with, together with ammunition and\r\nprovisions for the presumed period of its duration, and also lines of\r\ncontravallation and circumvallation, aided by all the localities of\r\nheights, woods, marshes and inundations.\r\n\r\nHaving no longer occasion to keep up communications with your depôts,\r\nit is now only requisite to hold in check the relieving army. For\r\nthis purpose, an army of observation should be formed, whose business\r\nit is never to lose sight of that of the enemy, and which, while it\r\neffectually bars all access to the place, has always time enough to\r\narrive upon his flanks or rear in case he should attempt to steal a\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered, too, that by profiting judiciously by the\r\nlines of contravallation, a portion of the besieging army will always\r\nbe available in giving battle to the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nUpon the same general principle, when a place is to be besieged in\r\npresence of an enemy’s army, it is necessary to cover the siege by\r\nlines of _circumvallation_.\r\n\r\nIf the besieging force is of numerical strength enough (after leaving\r\na corps before the place four times the amount of the garrison) to\r\ncope with the relieving army, it may remove more than one day’s march\r\nfrom the place; but if it be inferior in numbers after providing for\r\nthe siege, as above stated, it should remain only a short day’s march\r\nfrom the spot, in order to fall back upon its lines, if necessary, or\r\nreceive succor in case of attack.\r\n\r\nIf the investing corps and army of observation are only equal when\r\nunited to the relieving force, the besieging army should remain entire\r\nwithin, or near its lines, and push the works and the siege with the\r\ngreatest activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“When we undertake a siege,” says Montécuculli, “we should not seek to\r\nplace ourselves opposite the weakest part of the fortress, but at the\r\npoint most favorable for establishing a camp and executing the designs\r\nwe have in view.”\r\n\r\nThis maxim was well understood by the Duke of Berwick. Sent to form\r\nthe siege of Nice in 1706, he determined to attack on the side of\r\nMontalban, contrary to the advice of Vauban, and even to the orders\r\nof the king. Having a very small army at his disposal, he began by\r\nsecuring his camp. This he did by constructing redoubts upon the\r\nheights that shut in the space between the Var and the Paillon,\r\ntwo rivers which supported his flanks. By this means, he protected\r\nhimself against a surprise; for the Duke of Savoy, having the power\r\nof debouching suddenly by the Col de Tende, it was necessary that\r\nthe marshal should be enabled to assemble his forces, so as to move\r\nrapidly upon his adversary, and fight him before he got into position;\r\notherwise his inferiority in numbers would have obliged him to raise\r\nthe siege.\r\n\r\nWhen Marshal Saxe was besieging Brussels, with only twenty-eight\r\nthousand men, opposed to a garrison of twelve thousand, he received\r\nintelligence that the Prince of Waldeck was assembling his forces\r\nto raise the siege. Not being strong enough to form an army of\r\nobservation, the marshal reconnoitred a field of battle on the little\r\nriver Voluve, and made all the necessary dispositions for moving\r\nrapidly to the spot, in case of the approach of the enemy. By this\r\nmeans he was prepared to receive his adversary without discontinuing\r\nthe operations of the siege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeuquière says that “we should never wait for the enemy in the lines\r\nof circumvallation, but we should go out and attack him.” He is in\r\nerror. There is no authority in war without exception; and it would be\r\ndangerous to proscribe the principle of awaiting the enemy within the\r\nlines of circumvallation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Mons, in 1691, the Prince of Orange assembled\r\nhis army, and advanced as far as Notre Dame de Halle, making a\r\ndemonstration to succor the place. Louis XIV, who commanded the siege\r\nin person, called a council of war to deliberate on what was to be\r\ndone in case the Prince of Orange approached. The opinion of Marshal\r\nLuxembourg was to remain within the lines of circumvallation, and that\r\nopinion prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe marshal laid it down as a principle that, when the besieging army\r\nis not strong enough to defend the whole extent of circumvallation, it\r\nshould quit the lines and advance to meet the enemy; but when it is\r\nstrong enough to encamp in two lines around a place, that it is better\r\nto profit by a good entrenchment--more especially as by this means the\r\nsiege is not interrupted.\r\n\r\nIn 1658, Marshal Turenne was besieging Dunkirk. He had already opened\r\nthe trenches, when the Spanish army, under the orders of the Prince Don\r\nJuan, Condé, and D’Hocquincourt, appeared in sight, and took post upon\r\nthe Downs, at a distance of a league from his lines. Turenne had the\r\nsuperiority in numbers, and he determined to quit his entrenchments.\r\nHe had other advantages also. The enemy was without artillery, and\r\ntheir superiority in cavalry was rendered useless by the unfavorable\r\nnature of the ground. It was, therefore, of great importance to beat\r\nthe Spanish army before it had time to entrench itself and bring up its\r\nartillery. The victory gained by the French on this occasion justified\r\nall the combinations of Marshal Turenne.\r\n\r\nWhen Marshal Berwick was laying siege to Philipsburg, in 1733, he had\r\nreason to apprehend that the Prince of Savoy would attack him with\r\nall the forces of the empire before its termination. The marshal,\r\ntherefore, after having made his disposition of the troops intended for\r\nthe siege, formed, with the rest of his army, a corps of observation to\r\nmake head against Prince Eugene, in case the latter should choose to\r\nattack him in his lines, or attempt a diversion on the Moselle or Upper\r\nRhine. Prince Eugene, having arrived in front of the besieging army,\r\nsome general officers were of opinion that it was better not to await\r\nthe enemy in the lines, but to move forward and attack him. But Marshal\r\nBerwick, who agreed with the Duke of Luxembourg, that an army which\r\ncan occupy, completely, good entrenchments is not liable to be forced,\r\npersisted in remaining within his works. The result proved that this\r\nwas also the opinion of Prince Eugene, for he did not dare to attack\r\nthe entrenchments, which he would not have failed to do if he had any\r\nhopes of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who proscribe lines of circumvallation, and all the assistance\r\nwhich the science of the engineer can afford, deprive themselves\r\ngratuitously of an auxiliary which is never injurious, almost always\r\nuseful, and often indispensable. It must be admitted, at the same time,\r\nthat the principles of field-fortification require improvement. This\r\nimportant branch of the art of war has made no progress since the time\r\nof the ancients. It is even inferior at this day to what it was two\r\nthousand years ago. Engineer officers should be encouraged in bringing\r\nthis branch of their art to perfection, and in placing it upon a level\r\nwith the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“If we are inferior in numbers,” says Marshal Saxe, “entrenchments\r\nare of no use, for the enemy will bring all his forces to bear upon\r\nparticular points. If we are of equal strength they are unnecessary\r\nalso. If we are superior, we do not want them. Then why give ourselves\r\nthe trouble to entrench?” Notwithstanding this opinion of the inutility\r\nof entrenchments, Marshal Saxe often had recourse to them.\r\n\r\nIn 1797, Generals Provéra and Hohenzollern having presented themselves\r\nbefore Mantua (where Marshal Wurmser was shut up), for the purpose of\r\nraising the siege, they were stopped by the lines of contravallation of\r\nSt. George. This slight obstacle sufficed to afford Napoleon time to\r\narrive from Rivoli and defeat their enterprise. It was in consequence\r\nof neglecting to entrench themselves that the French had been obliged\r\nto raise the siege in the preceding campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf circumstances prevent a sufficient garrison being left to defend\r\na fortified town, which contains an hospital and magazines, at least\r\nevery means should be employed to secure the citadel against a _coup\r\nde main_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nA few battalions dispersed about a town, inspire no terror; but shut\r\nup in the more narrow outline of a citadel, they assume an imposing\r\nattitude. For this reason it appears to me that such a precaution\r\nis always necessary, not only in fortresses, but wherever there are\r\nhospitals or depôts of any kind. Where there is no citadel, some\r\nquarter of the town should be fixed upon most favorable for defence,\r\nand entrenched in such a manner as to oppose the greatest resistance\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortified place can only protect the garrison and detain the enemy\r\nfor a certain time. When this time has elapsed, and the defences of\r\nthe place are destroyed, the garrison should lay down its arms. All\r\ncivilized nations are agreed on this point, and there never has been\r\nan argument except with reference to the greater or less degree of\r\ndefence which a governor is bound to make before he capitulates. At the\r\nsame time, there are generals--Villars among the number--who are of\r\nopinion that a governor should never surrender, but that in the last\r\nextremity he should blow up the fortifications, and take advantage of\r\nthe night to cut his way through the besieging army. Where he is unable\r\nto blow up the fortifications, he may always retire, they say, with his\r\ngarrison, and save the men.\r\n\r\nOfficers who have adopted this line of conduct, have often brought off\r\nthree-fourths of their garrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn 1705, the French, who were besieged in Haguenau by Count Thungen,\r\nfound themselves incapable of sustaining an assault. Péri, the\r\ngovernor, who had already distinguished himself by a vigorous defence,\r\ndespairing of being allowed to capitulate on any terms short of\r\nbecoming prisoner of war, resolved to abandon the place and cut his way\r\nthrough the besiegers.\r\n\r\nIn order to conceal his intention more effectually, and while he\r\ndeceived the enemy, to sound at the same time the disposition of his\r\nofficers, he assembled a council of war and declared his resolution to\r\ndie in the breach. Then, under pretext of the extremity to which he was\r\nreduced, he commanded the whole garrison under arms; and leaving only a\r\nfew sharpshooters in the breach, gave the order to march, and set out\r\nin silence, under cover of the night, from Haguenau. This audacious\r\nenterprise was crowned with success, and Péri reached Saverne without\r\nhaving suffered the smallest loss.\r\n\r\nTwo fine instances of defence in later times are those of Massena at\r\nGenoa, and of Palafox at Saragossa.\r\n\r\nThe first marched out with arms and baggage, and all the honors of\r\nwar, after rejecting every summons, and defending himself until hunger\r\nalone compelled him to capitulate. The second only yielded after having\r\nburied his garrison amid the ruins of the city, which he defended from\r\nhouse to house, until famine and death left him no alternative but to\r\nsurrender. This siege, which was equally honorable to the French as\r\nto the Spaniards, is one of the most memorable in the history of war.\r\nIn the course of it, Palafox displayed every possible resource which\r\ncourage and obstinacy can supply in the defence of a fortress.\r\n\r\nAll real strength is founded in the mind; and on this account I am of\r\nopinion that we should be directed in the choice of a governor, less by\r\nhis genius than his personal character. His most essential qualities\r\nshould be courage, perseverance, and soldierlike devotedness. Above\r\nall, he should possess the talent not only of infusing courage into\r\nthe garrison, but of kindling a spirit of resistance in the whole\r\npopulation. Where the latter is wanting, however art may multiply the\r\ndefences of a place, the garrison will be compelled to capitulate after\r\nhaving sustained the first, or at most, the second assault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe keys of a fortress are well worth the retirement of the garrison,\r\nwhen it is resolved to yield only on those conditions. On this\r\nprinciple it is always wiser to grant an honorable capitulation to a\r\ngarrison which has made a vigorous resistance, than to risk an assault.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nMarshal Villars has justly observed, that “no governor of a place\r\nshould be permitted to excuse himself for surrendering, on the ground\r\nof wishing to preserve the king’s troops. Every garrison that displays\r\ncourage will escape being prisoners of war. For there is no general\r\nwho, however well assured of carrying a place by assault, will not\r\nprefer granting terms of capitulation rather than risk the loss of a\r\nthousand men in forcing determined troops to surrender.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfantry, cavalry, and artillery, are nothing without each other;\r\ntherefore, they should always be so disposed in cantonments as to\r\nassist each other in case of surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“A general,” says Frederick, “should direct his whole attention to\r\nthe tranquility of his cantonments, in order that the soldier may be\r\nrelieved from all anxiety, and repose in security from his fatigues.\r\nWith this view, care should be taken that the troops are able to form\r\nrapidly upon ground which has been previously reconnoitered; that the\r\ngenerals remain always with their divisions or brigades, and that the\r\nservice is carried on throughout with exactness.”\r\n\r\nMarshal Saxe is of opinion that an army should not be in a hurry to\r\nquit its cantonments, but that it should wait till the enemy has\r\nexhausted himself with marching, and be ready to fall upon him with\r\nfresh troops when he is overcome with fatigue.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that it would be dangerous to trust implicitly\r\nto this high authority, for there are many occasions where all the\r\nadvantage lies in the initiative, more especially when the enemy has\r\nbeen compelled to extend his cantonments, from scarcity of subsistence,\r\nand can be attacked before he has time to concentrate his forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formation of infantry in line should be always in two ranks,\r\nbecause the length of the musket only admits of an effective fire in\r\nthis formation. The discharge of the third rank is not only uncertain,\r\nbut frequently dangerous to the ranks in its front. In drawing up\r\ninfantry in two ranks, there should be a supernumerary behind every\r\nfourth or fifth file. A reserve should likewise be placed twenty-five\r\npaces in rear of each flank.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion, if circumstances require a line of infantry to resort\r\nto a square, that two-deep is too light a formation to resist the\r\nshock of cavalry. However useless the third rank may appear for the\r\npurpose of file-firing, it is, notwithstanding necessary, in order to\r\nreplace the men who fall in the ranks in front; otherwise you would\r\nbe obliged to close in the files, and by this means leave intervals\r\nbetween the companies, which the cavalry would not fail to penetrate.\r\nIt appears to me, also, that when infantry is formed in two ranks, the\r\ncolumns will be found to open out in marching to a flank. If it should\r\nbe considered advantageous behind entrenchments to keep the infantry\r\nin two ranks, the third rank should be placed in reserve, and brought\r\nforward to relieve the front rank when fatigued, or when the fire is\r\nobserved to slacken. I am induced to make these remarks, because I have\r\nseen an excellent pamphlet which proposes the two-deep formation for\r\ninfantry as the best. The author supports his opinion by a variety of\r\nplausible reasons, but not sufficient, as it appears to me, to answer\r\nall the objections that may be offered to this practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM XLIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of mixing small bodies of infantry and cavalry together is\r\na bad one, and attended with many inconveniences. The cavalry loses its\r\npower of action. It becomes fettered in all its movements. Its energy\r\nis destroyed; even the infantry itself is compromised, for on the\r\nfirst movement of the cavalry it is left without support. The best mode\r\nof protecting cavalry is to cover its flank.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis also was the opinion of Marshal Saxe. “The weakness of the above\r\nformation,” says he, “is sufficient in itself to intimidate the\r\nplatoons of infantry, because they must be lost if the cavalry is\r\nbeaten.”\r\n\r\nThe cavalry, also, which depends on the infantry for succor, is\r\ndisconcerted the moment a brisk forward movement carries them out of\r\nsight of their supports. Marshal Turenne, and the generals of his time,\r\nsometimes employed this order of formation; but that does not, in my\r\nopinion, justify a modern author for recommending it in an essay,\r\nentitled “_Considerations sur l’Art de la Guerre_.” In fact, this\r\nformation has long been abandoned; and, since the introduction of light\r\nartillery, it appears to me almost ridiculous to propose it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM L.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharges of cavalry are equally useful at the beginning, the middle, and\r\nthe end of a battle. They should be made always, if possible, on the\r\nflanks of the infantry, especially when the latter is engaged in front.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Charles, in speaking of cavalry, recommends that it should\r\nbe brought in mass upon a decisive point, when the moment for employing\r\nit arrives; that is to say, when it can attack with a certainty of\r\nsuccess. As the rapidity of its movement enables cavalry to act along\r\nthe whole line in the same day, the general who commands it should\r\nkeep it together as much as possible, and avoid dividing it into many\r\ndetachments. When the nature of the ground admits of cavalry being\r\nemployed on all points of the line, it is desirable to form it in\r\ncolumn behind the infantry, and in a position whence it may be easily\r\ndirected wherever it is required. If cavalry is intended to cover a\r\nposition, it should be placed sufficiently in the rear to meet at full\r\nspeed any advance of troops coming to attack that position. If it is\r\ndestined to cover the flank of the infantry, it should, for the same\r\nreason, be placed directly behind it. As the object of cavalry is\r\npurely offensive, it should be a rule to form it at such a distance\r\nonly from the point of collision as to enable it to acquire its utmost\r\nimpulse, and arrive at the top of its speed into action. With respect\r\nto the cavalry reserve, this should only be employed at the end of a\r\nbattle, either to render the success more decisive, or to cover the\r\nretreat. Napoleon remarks that, at the battle of Waterloo, the cavalry\r\nof the guard which composed the reserve, was engaged against his\r\norders. He complains of having been deprived from five o’clock of the\r\nuse of this reserve, which, when well employed, had so often insured\r\nhim the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the business of cavalry to follow up the victory, and to prevent\r\nthe beaten enemy from rallying.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nVictor or vanquished, it is of the greatest importance to have a body\r\nof cavalry in reserve, either to take advantage of victory, or to\r\nsecure a retreat. The most decisive battles lose half their value to\r\nthe conqueror, when the want of cavalry prevents him from following up\r\nhis success, and depriving the enemy of the power of rallying.\r\n\r\nWhen a retiring army is pursued, it is more especially upon the flanks\r\nthat the weight of cavalry should fall, if you are strong enough in\r\nthat arm to cut off his retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtillery is more essential to cavalry than to infantry, because\r\ncavalry has no fire for its defence, but depends upon the sabre.\r\nIt is to remedy this deficiency that recourse has been had to\r\nhorse-artillery. Cavalry, therefore, should never be without cannon,\r\nwhether when attacking, rallying, or in position.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nHorse-artillery is an invention of Frederick. Austria lost no time in\r\nintroducing it into her armies, although in an imperfect degree. It was\r\nonly in 1792 that this arm was adopted in France, where it was brought\r\nrapidly to its present perfection.\r\n\r\nThe services of this arm during the wars of the Revolution were\r\nimmense. It may be said to have changed to a certain extent the\r\ncharacter of tactics, because its facility of movement enables it to\r\nbear with rapidity on every point where artillery can be employed\r\nwith success. Napoleon has remarked in his memoirs that a flanking\r\nbattery which strikes and rakes the enemy obliquely, is capable of\r\ndeciding a victory in itself. To this we may add that, independent of\r\nthe advantages which cavalry derives from horse-artillery in securing\r\nits flanks, and in opening the way for a successful charge by the\r\ndestructiveness of its fire, it is desirable that these two arms\r\nshould never be separated, but ready at all times to seize upon points\r\nwhere it may be necessary to employ cannon. On these occasions, the\r\ncavalry masks the march of the artillery, protects its establishment in\r\nposition, and covers it from the attack of the enemy, until it is ready\r\nto open its fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn march, or in position, the greater part of the artillery should\r\nbe with the divisions of infantry and cavalry. The rest should be in\r\nreserve. Each gun should have with it three hundred rounds, without\r\nincluding the limber. This is about the complement for two battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe better infantry is, the more important it is to support it by\r\nartillery, with a view to its preservation.\r\n\r\nIt is essential, also, that the batteries attached to divisions should\r\nmarch in the front, because this has a strong influence on the _morale_\r\nof the soldier. He attacks always with confidence when he sees the\r\nflanks of the column well covered with cannon.\r\n\r\nThe artillery reserve should be kept for a decisive moment, and then\r\nemployed in full force, for it will be difficult for the enemy at such\r\na time to presume to attack it.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an instance of a battery of sixty pieces of cannon\r\nhaving been carried by a charge of infantry or cavalry, unless where\r\nit was entirely without support, or in a position to be easily turned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtillery should always be placed in the most advantageous positions,\r\nand as far in front of the line of cavalry and infantry as possible,\r\nwithout compromising the safety of the guns.\r\n\r\nField batteries should command the whole country round from the level\r\nof the platform. They should on no account be masked on the right and\r\nleft, but have free range in every direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe battery of eighteen pieces of cannon, which covered the centre of\r\nthe Russian army at the battle of La Moskwa (Borodino), may be cited as\r\nan example.\r\n\r\nIts position, upon a circular height which commanded the field in every\r\ndirection, added so powerfully to its effect, that its fire alone\r\nsufficed, for a considerable time, to paralyze the vigorous attack\r\nmade by the French with their right. Although twice broken, the left\r\nof the Russian army closed to this battery, as to a pivot, and twice\r\nrecovered its former position. After repeated attacks, conducted with\r\na rare intrepidity, the battery was at length carried by the French,\r\nbut not till they had lost the _élite_ of their army, and with it the\r\nGenerals Caulincourt and Montbrun. Its capture decided the retreat of\r\nthe Russian left.\r\n\r\nI might advert likewise to another instance, in the campaign of 1809,\r\nand to the terrible effect produced by the hundred pieces of cannon of\r\nthe Guard which General Lauriston directed, at the battle of Wagram,\r\nagainst the right of the Austrian army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA General should never put his army into cantonments, when he has the\r\nmeans of collecting supplies of forage and provisions, and of thus\r\nproviding for the wants of the soldier in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage which results from having an army in camp is,\r\nthat it is easier to direct its spirit and maintain its discipline\r\nthere. The soldier in cantonments abandons himself to repose; he ends\r\nby finding a pleasure in idleness, and in fearing to return to the\r\nfield. The reverse takes place in a camp. There, a feeling of _ennui_,\r\nand a severer discipline, make him anxious for the opening of the\r\ncampaign, to interrupt the monotony of the service and relieve it with\r\nthe chances and variety of war. Besides, an army in camp is much more\r\nsecure from a surprise than in cantonments--the defect of which usually\r\nconsists in their occupying too great an extent of ground. When an army\r\nis obliged to go into quarters, the Marquis de Feuquière recommends\r\na camp to be selected in front of the line, where the troops can be\r\nfrequently assembled--sometimes suddenly, in order to exercise their\r\nvigilance, or for the sole purpose of bringing the different corps\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good general, a well-organized system, good instructions, and severe\r\ndiscipline, aided by effective establishments, will always make good\r\ntroops, independently of the cause for which they fight.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a love of country, a spirit of enthusiasm, a sense of\r\nnational honor, and fanaticism, will operate upon young soldiers with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis remark appears to me less applicable to officers than to soldiers,\r\nfor as war is not a state of things natural to man, it follows\r\nthat those who maintain its cause must be governed by some strong\r\nexcitement. Much enthusiasm and devotedness are required on the part\r\nof the troops for the general who commands, to induce an army to\r\nperform great actions in a war in which it takes no interest. This is\r\nsufficiently proved by the apathy of auxiliaries, unless when inspired\r\nby the conduct of their chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a nation is without establishments and a military system, it is\r\nvery difficult to organize an army.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis is an unanswerable truth, more particularly with reference to an\r\narmy intended to act upon the system of modern war, and in which order,\r\nprecision, and rapidity of movement, are the principal essentials to\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first qualification of a soldier is fortitude under fatigue and\r\nprivation. Courage is only the second; hardship, poverty and want, are\r\nthe best school for a soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nValor belongs to the young soldier as well as to the veteran; but in\r\nthe former it is more evanescent. It is only by habits of service, and\r\nafter several campaigns, that the soldier acquires that moral courage\r\nwhich makes him support the fatigues and privations of war without a\r\nmurmur. Experience by this time has instructed him to supply his own\r\nwants. He is satisfied with what he can procure, because he knows that\r\nsuccess is only to be obtained by fortitude and perseverance. Well\r\nmight Napoleon say that misery and want were the best school for a\r\nsoldier; for as nothing could be compared with the total destitution\r\nof the army of the Alps, when he assumed the command, so nothing\r\ncould equal the brilliant success which he obtained with this army\r\nin the first campaign in Italy. The conquerors of Montenotte, Lodi,\r\nCastiglione, Bassano, Arcole and Rivoli had beheld, only a few months\r\nbefore, whole battalions covered with rags, and deserting for the want\r\nof subsistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are five things the soldier should never be without--his musket,\r\nhis ammunition, his knapsack, his provisions (for at least four days),\r\nand his entrenching-tool. The knapsack may be reduced to the smallest\r\nsize possible, if it be thought proper, but the soldier should always\r\nhave it with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that Napoleon has recognized the advantage of giving\r\nto every soldier an entrenching-tool. His authority is the best answer\r\nto the ridicule which has been thrown upon those who proposed it. An\r\naxe will be found to inconvenience the foot-soldier as little as the\r\nsword he wears at his side, and it will be infinitely more useful. When\r\naxes are given out to companies, or are carried by fatigue-men during\r\na campaign, they are soon lost; and it often happens, when a camp is\r\nto be formed, that a difficulty arises in cutting wood and building\r\nhuts for the soldier; whereas, by making the axe a part of every man’s\r\nappointments, he is obliged to have it always with him; and whether\r\nthe object be to entrench himself in a village, or to erect huts in a\r\ncamp, the commander of a corps will speedily see the advantage of this\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nWhen once the axe has been generally adopted, we shall, perhaps,\r\nsee the desirability of issuing pickaxes and shovels to particular\r\ncompanies, and also the benefit of more frequent entrenchments. It is\r\nmore particularly during retreats that it is important to entrench when\r\nthe army has reached a good position; for an entrenched camp not only\r\nfurnishes the means of rallying troops which are pursued, but if it be\r\nfortified in such a manner as to render the issue of an attack doubtful\r\nto the enemy, it will not only sustain the _morale_ of the soldier in\r\nthe retreat, but afford the general-in-chief opportunities for resuming\r\nthe offensive, and profiting by the first false movement on the part of\r\nhis adversary. It will be recollected how Frederick, in the campaign of\r\n1761, when surrounded by two Russian and Austrian armies, whose united\r\nforce was quadruple his own, saved his army by entrenching himself in\r\nthe camp of Buntzalvitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery means should be taken to attach the soldier to his colors. This\r\nis best accomplished by showing consideration and respect to the old\r\nsoldier. His pay likewise should increase with his length of service.\r\nIt is the height of injustice not to pay a veteran more than a recruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSome modern writers have recommended, on the other hand, to limit the\r\nperiod of service, in order to bring the whole youth of a country\r\nsuccessively under arms. By this means they purpose to have the levies,\r\n_en masse_, all ready trained and capable of resisting successfully\r\na war of invasion. But however advantageous at first sight such a\r\nmilitary system may appear, I believe it will be found to have many\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the soldier fatigued with the minutiæ of discipline\r\nin a garrison, will not feel much inclined to re-enlist after he has\r\nreceived his discharge, more especially since, having served the\r\nprescribed time, he will consider himself to have fulfilled all the\r\nduties of a citizen to his country. Returning to his friends, he will\r\nprobably marry, or establish himself in a trade. From that moment his\r\nmilitary spirit declines, and he soon becomes ill adapted to the\r\nbusiness of war. On the contrary, the soldier who serves long, becomes\r\nattached to his regiment as to a new family. He submits to the yoke of\r\ndiscipline, accustoms himself to the privations his situation imposes,\r\nand ends by finding his condition agreeable. There are few officers\r\nthat have seen service who have not discovered the difference between\r\nold and young soldiers, with reference to their power of supporting\r\nthe fatigues of a long campaign, to the determined courage that\r\ncharacterizes the attack, or to the ease with which they rally after\r\nbeing broken.\r\n\r\nMontécuculli observes, that “it takes time to discipline an army; more\r\nto inure it to war; and still more to constitute veterans.” For this\r\nreason, he recommends that great consideration should be shown to old\r\nsoldiers; that they should be carefully provided for, and a large\r\nbody of them kept always on foot. It seems to me, also, that it is\r\nnot enough to increase the pay of the soldier according to his period\r\nof service, but that it is highly essential to confer on him some\r\nmark of distinction that shall secure to him privileges calculated to\r\nencourage him to grow gray under arms, and, above all, to do so with\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not set speeches at the moment of battle that render soldiers\r\nbrave. The veteran scarcely listens to them, and the recruit forgets\r\nthem at the first discharge. If discourses and harangues are useful, it\r\nis during the campaign: to do away unfavorable impressions, to correct\r\nfalse reports, to keep alive a proper spirit in the camp, and to\r\nfurnish materials and amusement for the bivouac. All printed orders of\r\nthe day should keep in view these objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the general-in-chief, energetically expressed, is,\r\nnotwithstanding, productive of great effect on the _morale_ of the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nIn 1703, at the attack of Hornbec, Marshal Villars, seeing the troops\r\nadvancing without spirit, threw himself at their head: “What!” said\r\nhe, “is it expected that I, a marshal of France, should be the first to\r\nescalade, when I order YOU to attack?”\r\n\r\nThese few words rekindled their ardor; officers and soldiers rushed\r\nupon the works, and the town was taken almost without loss.\r\n\r\n“We have retired far enough for to-day; you know I always sleep upon\r\nthe field of battle!” said Napoleon, as he flew through the ranks\r\nat the moment of resuming the offensive at Marengo. These few words\r\nsufficed to revive the courage of the soldiers, and to make them forget\r\nthe fatigues of the day, during which almost every man had been engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTents are unfavorable to health. The soldier is best when he bivouacs,\r\nbecause he sleeps with his feet to the fire, which speedily dries the\r\nground on which he lies. A few planks, or a little straw, shelter him\r\nfrom the wind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, tents are necessary for the superior officers, who\r\nhave to write and to consult their maps. Tents should, therefore,\r\nbe issued to these, with directions to them never to sleep in a\r\nhouse. Tents are always objects of observation to the enemy’s staff.\r\nThey afford information in regard to your numbers and the ground you\r\noccupy; while an army bivouacking in two or three lines, is only\r\ndistinguishable from afar by the smoke which mingles with the clouds.\r\nIt is impossible to count the number of the fires.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged advantage of bivouacking is another reason for\r\nadding an entrenching-tool to the equipment of the soldier; for, with\r\nthe assistance of the axe and shovel, he can hut himself without\r\ndifficulty. I have seen huts erected with the branches of trees,\r\ncovered with turf, where the soldier was perfectly sheltered from the\r\ncold and wet, even in the worst season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll information obtained from prisoners should be received with\r\ncaution, and estimated at its real value. A soldier seldom sees\r\nanything beyond his company; and an officer can afford intelligence of\r\nlittle more than the position and movements of the division to which\r\nhis regiment belongs. On this account, the general of an army should\r\nnever depend upon the information derived from prisoners, unless it\r\nagrees with the reports received from the advanced guards, in reference\r\nto the position, etc., of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nMontécuculli wisely observes that “prisoners should be interrogated\r\nseparately, in order to ascertain, by the agreement in their answers,\r\nhow far they may be endeavoring to mislead you.” Generally speaking,\r\nthe information required from officers who are prisoners, should have\r\nreference to the strength and resources of the enemy, and sometimes to\r\nhis localities and position. Frederick recommends that prisoners should\r\nbe menaced with instant death if they are found attempting to deceive\r\nby false reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is so important in war as an undivided command; for this\r\nreason, when war is carried on against a single power, there should be\r\nonly one army, acting upon one base, and conducted by one chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“Success,” says the Archduke Charles, “is only to be obtained by\r\nsimultaneous efforts, directed upon a given point, sustained with\r\nconstancy, and executed with decision.” It rarely happens that any\r\nnumber of men who desire the same object are perfectly agreed as to the\r\nmeans of attaining it; and if the will of one individual is not allowed\r\nto predominate, there can be no _ensemble_ in the execution of their\r\noperations; neither will they attain the end proposed. It is useless to\r\nconfirm this maxim by examples. History abounds in them.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene and Marlborough would never have been so successful in\r\nthe campaigns which they directed in concert, if a spirit of intrigue\r\nand difference of opinion had not constantly disorganized the armies\r\nopposed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same consequences which have uniformly attended long discussions\r\nand councils of war, will follow at all times. They will terminate\r\nin the adoption of the worst course, which in war is always the most\r\ntimid, or, if you will, the most prudent. The only true wisdom in a\r\ngeneral is determined courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene used to say that councils of war “are only useful when\r\nyou want an excuse for attempting _nothing_.” This was also the opinion\r\nof Villars. A general-in-chief should avoid, therefore, assembling\r\na council on occasions of difficulty, and should confine himself to\r\nconsulting separately his most experienced generals in order to benefit\r\nby their advice, while he is governed at the same time in his decision\r\nby his own judgment. By this means, he becomes responsible, it is true,\r\nfor the measures he pursues; but he has the advantage also of acting\r\nupon his own conviction, and of being certain that the secret of his\r\noperations will not be divulged, as is usually the case where it is\r\ndiscussed by a council of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn war, the general alone can judge of certain arrangements. It depends\r\non him alone to conquer difficulties by his own superior talents and\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe officer who obeys, whatever may be the nature or extent of his\r\ncommand, will always stand excused for executing implicitly the\r\norders which have been given to him. This is not the case with the\r\ngeneral-in-chief, on whom the safety of the army and the success of the\r\ncampaign depend. Occupied, without intermission, in the whole process\r\nof observation and reflection, it is easy to conceive that he will\r\nacquire by degrees a solidity of judgment which will enable him to see\r\nthings in a clearer and more enlarged point of view than his inferior\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\nMarshal Villars, in his campaigns, acted almost always in opposition\r\nto the advice of his generals, and he was almost always fortunate.\r\nSo true it is, that a general, who feels confident in his talent for\r\ncommand, must follow the dictates of his own genius if he wishes to\r\nachieve success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo authorize generals or other officers to lay down their arms in\r\nvirtue of a particular capitulation, under any other circumstances\r\nthan when they are composing the garrison of a fortress, affords a\r\ndangerous latitude. It is destructive of all military character in a\r\nnation to open such a door to the cowardly, the weak, or even to the\r\nmisdirected brave. Great extremities require extraordinary resolution.\r\nThe more obstinate the resistance of an army, the greater the chances\r\nof assistance or of success.\r\n\r\nHow many seeming impossibilities have been accomplished by men whose\r\nonly resource was death!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1759, Frederick directed General Fink, with eighteen\r\nthousand men, upon Maxen, for the purpose of cutting off the Austrian\r\narmy from the defiles of Bohemia. Surrounded by twice his numbers, Fink\r\ncapitulated after a sharp action, and fourteen thousand men laid down\r\ntheir arms. This conduct was the more disgraceful, because General\r\nWinch, who commanded the cavalry, cut his way through the enemy. The\r\nwhole blame of the surrender fell, therefore, upon Fink, who was\r\ntried afterward by a court-martial, and sentenced to be cashiered and\r\nimprisoned for two years.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of Italy in 1796, the Austrian General Provéra\r\ncapitulated with two thousand men in the castle of Cossaria.\r\nSubsequently, at the battle of La Favorite, the same general\r\ncapitulated with a corps of six thousand men. I scarcely dare to revert\r\nto the shameful defection of General Mack in the capitulation of Ulm\r\nin 1805, where thirty thousand Austrians laid down their arms--when we\r\nhave seen, during the wars of the Revolution, so many generals open\r\nthemselves a way by a vigorous effort through the enemy, supported only\r\nby a few battalions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no security for any sovereign, for any nation, or for any\r\ngeneral, if officers are permitted to capitulate in the open field,\r\nand to lay down their arms in virtue of conditions favorable to the\r\ncontracting party, but contrary to the interests of the army at large.\r\nTo withdraw from danger, and thereby to involve their comrades in\r\ngreater peril, is the height of cowardice. Such conduct should be\r\nproscribed, declared infamous, and made punishable with death. All\r\ngenerals, officers and soldiers, who capitulate in battle to save their\r\nown lives, should be decimated.\r\n\r\nHe who gives the order, and those who obey, are alike traitors, and\r\ndeserve capital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nSoldiers, who are almost always ignorant of the designs of their\r\nchief, cannot be responsible for his conduct. If he orders them to\r\nlay down their arms, they must do so; otherwise they fail in that law\r\nof discipline which is more essential to an army than thousands of\r\nmen. It appears to me, therefore, under these circumstances, that the\r\nchiefs alone are responsible, and liable to the punishment due to their\r\ncowardice. We have no example of soldiers being wanting in their duty\r\nin the most desperate situations, where they are commanded by officers\r\nof approved resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is but one honorable mode of becoming prisoner of war. That\r\nis, by being taken separately; by which is meant, by being cut off\r\nentirely, and when we can no longer make use of our arms. In this case,\r\nthere can be no conditions, for honor can impose none. We yield to an\r\nirresistible necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThere is always time enough to surrender prisoner of war. This should\r\nbe deferred, therefore, till the last extremity. And here I may be\r\npermitted to cite an example of rare obstinacy in defence, which has\r\nbeen related to me by ocular witnesses. The captain of grenadiers,\r\nDubrenil, of the thirty-seventh regiment of the line, having been\r\nsent on detachment with his company, was stopped on the march by a\r\nlarge party of Cossacks, who surrounded him on every side. Dubrenil\r\nformed his little force into square, and endeavored to gain the skirts\r\nof a wood (within a few muskets’ shot of the spot where he had been\r\nattacked), and reached it with very little loss. But as soon as the\r\ngrenadiers saw this refuge secured to them, they broke and fled,\r\nleaving their captain and a few brave men, who were resolved not to\r\nabandon him, at the mercy of the enemy. In the meantime, the fugitives,\r\nwho had rallied in the depth of the wood, ashamed of having forsaken\r\ntheir leader, came to the resolution of rescuing him from the enemy,\r\nif a prisoner, or of carrying off his body if he had fallen. With this\r\nview, they formed once more upon the outskirts, and opening a passage\r\nwith their bayonets through the cavalry, penetrated to their captain,\r\nwho, notwithstanding seventeen wounds, was defending himself still.\r\nThey immediately surrounded him, and regained the wood with little\r\nloss. Such examples are not rare in the wars of the Revolution, and\r\nit were desirable to see them collected by some contemporary, that\r\nsoldiers might learn how much is to be achieved in war by determined\r\nenergy and sustained resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conduct of a general in a conquered country is full of\r\ndifficulties. If severe, he irritates and increases the number of his\r\nenemies. If lenient, he gives birth to expectations which only render\r\nthe abuses and vexations, inseparable from war, the more intolerable.\r\nA victorious general must know how to employ severity, justice and\r\nmildness by turns, if he would allay sedition or prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, generals were only permitted to arrive at the command\r\nof armies after having exercised the different functions of the\r\nmagistracy. Thus by a previous knowledge of administration, they were\r\nprepared to govern the conquered provinces with all that discretion\r\nwhich a newly-acquired power, supported by arbitrary force, demands.\r\n\r\nIn the military institutions of modern times, the generals, instructed\r\nonly in what concerns the operation of strategy and tactics, are\r\nobliged to intrust the civil departments of the war to inferior agents,\r\nwho, without belonging to the army, render all those abuses and\r\nvexations, inseparable from its operations, still more intolerable.\r\n\r\nThis observation, which I do little more than repeat, seems to me,\r\nnotwithstanding, deserving of particular attention; for if the leisure\r\nof general officers was directed in time of peace to the study of\r\ndiplomacy--if they were employed in the different embassies which\r\nsovereigns send to foreign courts--they would acquire a knowledge of\r\nthe laws and of the government of these countries, in which they may\r\nbe called hereafter to carry on the war. They would learn also to\r\ndistinguish those points of interest on which all treaties must be\r\nbased, which have for their object the advantageous termination of a\r\ncampaign. By the aid of this information they would obtain certain\r\nand positive results, since all the springs of action, as well as the\r\nmachinery of war, would be in their hands. We have seen Prince Eugene,\r\nand Marshal Villars, each fulfilling with equal ability the duties of a\r\ngeneral and a negotiator.\r\n\r\nWhen an army which occupies a conquered province observes strict\r\ndiscipline, there are few examples of insurrection among the people,\r\nunless indeed resistance is provoked (as but too often happens), by the\r\nexactions of inferior agents employed in the civil administration.\r\n\r\nIt is to this point, therefore, that the general-in-chief should\r\nprincipally direct his attention, in order that the contributions\r\nimposed by the wants of the army may be levied with impartiality; and\r\nabove all, that they may be applied to their true object, instead of\r\nserving to enrich the collectors, as is ordinarily the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can excuse a general who takes advantage of the knowledge\r\nacquired in the service of his country, to deliver up her frontier and\r\nher towns to foreigners. This is a crime reprobated by every principle\r\nof religion, morality and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAmbitious men who, listening only to their passions, arm natives of\r\nthe same land against each other (under the deceitful pretext of\r\nthe public good), are still more criminal. For however arbitrary a\r\ngovernment, the institutions which have been consolidated by time, are\r\nalways preferable to civil war, and to that anarchy which the latter is\r\nobliged to create for the justification of its crimes.\r\n\r\nTo be faithful to his sovereign, and to respect the established\r\ngovernment, are the first principles which ought to distinguish a\r\nsoldier and a man of honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA general-in-chief has no right to shelter his mistakes in war under\r\ncover of his sovereign, or of a minister, when these are both distant\r\nfrom the scene of operation, and must consequently be either ill\r\ninformed or wholly ignorant of the actual state of things.\r\n\r\nHence, it follows, that every general is culpable who undertakes the\r\nexecution of a plan which he considers faulty. It is his duty to\r\nrepresent his reasons, to insist upon a change of plan, in short, to\r\ngive in his resignation, rather than allow himself to be made the\r\ninstrument of his army’s ruin. Every general-in-chief who fights a\r\nbattle in consequence of superior orders, with the certainty of losing\r\nit, is equally blamable.\r\n\r\nIn this last-mentioned case, the general ought to refuse obedience;\r\nbecause a blind obedience is due only to a military command given\r\nby a superior present on the spot at the moment of action. Being in\r\npossession of the real state of things, the superior has it then in his\r\npower to afford the necessary explanations to the person who executes\r\nhis orders.\r\n\r\nBut supposing a general-in-chief to receive positive order from\r\nhis sovereign, directing him to fight a battle, with the further\r\ninjunction, to yield to his adversary, and allow himself to be\r\ndefeated--ought he to obey it? No. If the general should be able to\r\ncomprehend the meaning or utility of such an order, he should execute\r\nit; otherwise he should refuse to obey it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1697, Prince Eugene caused the courier to be\r\nintercepted, who was bringing him orders from the emperor forbidding\r\nhim to hazard a battle, for which everything had been prepared, and\r\nwhich he foresaw would prove decisive. He considered, therefore,\r\nthat he did his duty in evading the orders of his sovereign; and the\r\nvictory of Zanta, in which the Turks lost about thirty thousand men,\r\nand four thousand prisoners, rewarded his audacity. In the meantime,\r\nnotwithstanding the immense advantages which accrued from this victory\r\nto the imperial arms, Eugene was disgraced on his arrival at Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, General Hoche, having received orders to move upon Treves with\r\nan army harassed by constant marches in a mountainous and difficult\r\ncountry, refused to obey. He observed, with reason, that in order to\r\nobtain possession of an unimportant fortress, they were exposing his\r\narmy to inevitable ruin. He caused, therefore, his troops to return\r\ninto winter quarters, and preferred the preservation of his army, upon\r\nwhich the success of the future campaign depended, to his own safety.\r\nRecalled to Paris, he was thrown into a dungeon, which he only quitted\r\non the downfall of Robespierre.\r\n\r\nI dare not decide if such examples are to be imitated; but it seems to\r\nme highly desirable that a question so new and so important, should be\r\ndiscussed by men who are capable of determining its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first qualification in a general-in-chief is a cool head--that\r\nis, a head which receives just impressions, and estimates things and\r\nobjects at their real value. He must not allow himself to be elated by\r\ngood news, or depressed by bad.\r\n\r\nThe impressions he receives either successively or simultaneously in\r\nthe course of the day, should be so classed as to take up only the\r\nexact place in his mind which they deserve to occupy; since it is upon\r\na just comparison and consideration of the weight due to different\r\nimpressions, that the power of reasoning and of right judgment depends.\r\n\r\nSome men are so physically and morally constituted as to see everything\r\nthrough a highly-colored medium. They raise up a picture in the mind on\r\nevery slight occasion, and give to every trivial occurrence a dramatic\r\ninterest. But whatever knowledge, or talent, or courage, or other good\r\nqualities such men may possess, nature has not formed them for the\r\ncommand of armies, or the direction of great military operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“The first quality in a general-in-chief,” says Montécuculli, “is a\r\ngreat knowledge of the art of war. This is not intuitive, but the\r\nresult of experience. A man is not born a commander. He must become\r\none. Not to be anxious; to be always cool; to avoid confusion in his\r\ncommands; never to change countenance; to give his orders in the midst\r\nof battle with as much composure as if he were perfectly at ease. These\r\nare the proofs of valor in a general.\r\n\r\n“To encourage the timid; to increase the number of the truly brave; to\r\nrevive the drooping ardor of the troops in battle; to rally those who\r\nare broken; to bring back to the charge those who are repulsed; to find\r\nresources in difficulty, and success even amid disaster; to be ready at\r\na moment to devote himself, if necessary, for the welfare of the state.\r\nThese are the actions which acquire for a general distinction and\r\nrenown.”\r\n\r\nTo this enumeration may be added, the talent of discriminating\r\ncharacter, and of employing every man in the particular post which\r\nnature has qualified him to fill. “My principal attention,” said\r\nMarshal Villars, “was always directed to the study of the younger\r\ngenerals. Such a one I found, by the boldness of his character, fit\r\nto lead a column of attack; another, from a disposition naturally\r\ncautious, but without being deficient in courage, more perfectly to\r\nbe relied on for the defence of a country.” It is only by a just\r\napplication of these personal qualities to their respective objects,\r\nthat it is possible to command success in war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading qualifications which should distinguish an officer selected\r\nfor the head of the staff, are, to know the country thoroughly; to\r\nbe able to conduct a _reconnoissance_ with skill; to superintend the\r\ntransmission of orders promptly; to lay down the most complicated\r\nmovements intelligibly, but in a few words, and with simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the duties of the chiefs of the staff were confined to the\r\nnecessary preparations for carrying the plan of the campaign, and\r\nthe operations resolved on by the general-in-chief, into effect.\r\nIn a battle, they were only employed in directing movements and\r\nsuperintending their execution. But in the late wars, the officers\r\nof the staff were frequently intrusted with the command of a column\r\nof attack, or of large detachments, when the general-in-chief feared\r\nto disclose the secret of his plans by the transmission of orders or\r\ninstructions. Great advantages have resulted from this innovation,\r\nalthough it was long resisted. By this means, the staff have been\r\nenabled to perfect their theory by practice, and they have acquired,\r\nmoreover, the esteem of the soldiers and junior officers of the\r\nline, who are easily led to think lightly of their superiors, whom\r\nthey do not see fighting in the ranks. The generals who have held\r\nthe arduous situation of chief of the staff during the wars of the\r\nRevolution, have almost always been employed in the different branches\r\nof the profession. Marshal Berthier, who filled so conspicuously this\r\nappointment to Napoleon, was distinguished by all the essentials of a\r\ngeneral. He possessed calm, and at the same time brilliant courage,\r\nexcellent judgment, and approved experience. He bore arms during half\r\na century, made war in the four quarters of the globe, opened and\r\nterminated thirty-two campaigns. In his youth he acquired, under the\r\neye of his father, who was an engineer officer, the talent of tracing\r\nplans and finishing them with exactness, as well as the preliminary\r\nqualifications necessary to form a staff-officer. Admitted by the\r\nPrince de Lambesq into his regiment of dragoons, he was taught the\r\nskilful management of his horse and his sword--accomplishments so\r\nimportant to a soldier. Attached afterward to the staff of Count\r\nRochambeau, he made his first campaign in America, where he soon began\r\nto distinguish himself by his valor, activity and talents. Having at\r\nlength attained superior rank in the staff-corps formed by Marshal de\r\nSegur, he visited the camps of the King of Prussia, and discharged the\r\nduties of chief of the staff under the Baron de Bezenval.\r\n\r\nDuring nineteen years, consumed in sixteen campaigns, the history\r\nof Marshal Berthier’s life was little else but that of the wars of\r\nNapoleon, all the details of which he directed, both in the cabinet\r\nand the field. A stranger to the intrigues of politics, he labored\r\nwith indefatigable activity; seized with promptitude and sagacity\r\nupon general views, and gave the necessary orders for attaining them\r\nwith prudence, perspicuity, and conciseness. Discreet, impenetrable,\r\nmodest; he was just, exact, and even severe, in everything that\r\nregarded the service; but he always set an example of vigilance and\r\nzeal in his own person, and knew how to maintain discipline, and to\r\ncause his authority to be respected by every rank under his orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA commandant of artillery should understand well the general principles\r\nof each branch of the service, since he is called upon to supply\r\narms and ammunition to the different corps of which it is composed.\r\nHis correspondence with the commanding officers of artillery at the\r\nadvanced posts, should put him in possession of all the movements of\r\nthe army, and the disposition and management of the great park of\r\nartillery should depend upon this information.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAfter having recognized the advantage of intrusting the supply of\r\narms and ammunition for an army to a military body, it appears to\r\nme extraordinary that the same regulation does not extend to that of\r\nprovisions and forage, instead of leaving it in the hands of a separate\r\nadministration, as is the practice at present.\r\n\r\nThe civil establishments attached to armies are formed almost always at\r\nthe commencement of a war, and composed of persons strangers to those\r\nlaws of discipline which they are but too much inclined to disregard.\r\nThese men are little esteemed by the military, because they serve only\r\nto enrich themselves, without respect to the means. They consider only\r\ntheir private interest in a service whose glory they cannot share,\r\nalthough some portion of its success depends upon their zeal. The\r\ndisorders and defalcations incident to these establishments would\r\nassuredly cease, if they were confided to men who had been employed\r\nin the army, and who, in return for their labors, were permitted to\r\npartake with their fellow-soldiers the triumph of their success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualities which distinguish a good general of advanced posts, are,\r\nto reconnoitre accurately defiles and fords of every description; to\r\nprovide guides that may be depended on; to interrogate the _curé_\r\nand postmaster; to establish rapidly a good understanding with the\r\ninhabitants; to send out spies; to intercept public and private\r\nletters; to translate and analyze their contents; in a word, to be able\r\nto answer every question of the general-in-chief, when he arrives with\r\nthe whole army.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nForaging parties, composed of small detachments, and which were usually\r\nintrusted to young officers, served formerly to make good officers\r\nof advanced posts; but now the army is supplied with provisions by\r\nregular contributions: it is only in a course of partisan warfare that\r\nthe necessary experience can be acquired to fill these situations with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nA chief of partisans is, to a certain extent, independent of the army.\r\nHe receives neither pay nor provisions from it, and rarely succor, and\r\nis abandoned during the whole campaign to his own resources.\r\n\r\nAn officer so circumstanced must unite address with courage, and\r\nboldness with discretion, if he wishes to collect plunder without\r\nmeasuring the strength of his little corps with superior forces. Always\r\nharassed, always surrounded by dangers, which it is his business to\r\nforesee and surmount, a leader of partisans acquires in a short time an\r\nexperience in the details of war rarely to be obtained by an officer\r\nof the line; because the latter is almost always under the guidance of\r\nsuperior authority, which directs the whole of his movements, while\r\nthe talent and genius of the partisan are developed and sustained by a\r\ndependence on his own resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerals-in-chief must be guided by their own experience, or their\r\ngenius. Tactics, evolutions, the duties and knowledge of an engineer\r\nor artillery officer, may be learned in treatises, but the science\r\nof strategy is only to be acquired by experience, and by studying the\r\ncampaigns of all the great captains.\r\n\r\nGustavus Adolphus, Turenne, and Frederick, as well as Alexander,\r\nHannibal, and Cæsar, have all acted upon the same principles. These\r\nhave been: to keep their forces united; to leave no weak part\r\nunguarded; to seize with rapidity on important points.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principles which lead to victory, and which, by inspiring\r\nterror at the reputation of your arms, will at once maintain fidelity\r\nand secure subjection.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n“A great captain can only be formed,” says the Archduke Charles, “by\r\nlong experience and intense study: neither is his own experience\r\nenough--for whose life is there sufficiently fruitful of events to\r\nrender his knowledge universal?” It is, therefore, by augmenting his\r\ninformation from the stock of others, by appreciating justly the\r\ndiscoveries of his predecessors, and by taking for his standard of\r\ncomparison those great military exploits, in connection with their\r\npolitical results, in which the history of war abounds, that he can\r\nalone become a great commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeruse again and again the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Cæsar,\r\nGustavus Adolphus, Turenne, Eugene, and Frederick. Model yourself\r\nupon them. This is the only means of becoming a great captain, and\r\nof acquiring the secret of the art of war. Your own genius will be\r\nenlightened and improved by this study, and you will learn to reject\r\nall maxims foreign to the principles of these great commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIt is in order to facilitate this object that I have formed the present\r\ncollection. It is after reading and meditating upon the history of\r\nmodern war that I have endeavored to illustrate, by examples, how the\r\nmaxims of a great captain may be most successfully applied to this\r\nstudy. May the end I have had in view be accomplished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nCover created by Transcriber and placed in the Public Domain.\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged, except as noted below.\r\n\r\nUnusual and archaic spellings were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nPage 32: “spacious and extensive” was printed as “entensive” but\r\nchanged here.\r\n\r\nPage 60: “1746” is a misprint; the correct date must be in the 1600's,\r\nperhaps “1646”.\r\n\r\nPage 63: “1798” may be a misprint for “1796”.\r\n\r\nPage 65: “1745” is a misprint; the correct year is “1645”.\r\n\r\nPage 75: “wo to the vanquished” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 100: “Vauban” was printed as “Vanban” but changed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Officer's Manual, by Napoleon Bonaparte",
