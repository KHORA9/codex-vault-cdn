The paragraphs are not adjusted as is customary for text in\r\ne-books, nor are words split by hyphens rejoined, so that the lines shown\r\nbelow have the same words as the lines in the original book.]\r\n\r\nA certain apothegm of a Talmudical philosopher [1]\r\nsuits my sense of doing good. It reads thus: “The\r\nnoblest charity is to prevent a man from accepting\r\ncharity; and the best alms are to show and to enable a\r\nman to dispense with alms.” [5]\r\n\r\nIn the early history of Christian Science, among my\r\nthousands of students few were wealthy. Now, Christian\r\nScientists are not indigent; and their comfortable fortunes\r\nare acquired by healing mankind morally, physically,\r\nspiritually. The easel of time presents pictures—once [10]\r\nfragmentary and faint—now rejuvenated by the touch\r\nof God’s right hand. Where joy, sorrow, hope, disap-\r\npointment, sigh, and smile commingled, now hope sits\r\ndove-like.\r\n\r\nTo preserve a long course of years still and uniform, [15]\r\namid the uniform darkness of storm and cloud and\r\ntempest, requires strength from above,—deep draughts\r\nfrom the fount of divine Love. Truly may it be said:\r\nThere is an old age of the heart, and a youth that never\r\ngrows old; a Love that is a boy, and a Psyche who is [20]\r\never a girl. The fleeting freshness of youth, however,\r\nis not the evergreen of Soul; the coloring glory of\r\n\r\n[Page x.]\r\n\r\nperpetual bloom; the spiritual glow and grandeur of [1]\r\na consecrated life wherein dwelleth peace, sacred and\r\nsincere in trial or in triumph.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity has at length offered itself for me to\r\ncomply with an oft-repeated request; namely, to collect [5]\r\nmy miscellaneous writings published in _The Christian_\r\n_Science Journal_, since April, 1883, and republish them\r\nin book form,—accessible as reference, and reliable as\r\nold landmarks. Owing to the manifold demands on my\r\ntime in the early pioneer days, most of these articles [10]\r\nwere originally written in haste, without due preparation.\r\nTo those heretofore in print, a few articles are herein\r\nappended. To some articles are affixed data, where these\r\nare most requisite, to serve as mile-stones measuring the\r\ndistance,—or the difference between then and now,— [15]\r\nin the opinions of men and the progress of our Cause.\r\n\r\nMy signature has been slightly changed from my\r\nChristian name, Mary Morse Baker. Timidity in early\r\nyears caused me, as an author, to assume various _noms_\r\n_de plume_. After my first marriage, to Colonel Glover [20]\r\nof Charleston, South Carolina, I dropped the name of\r\nMorse to retain my maiden name,—thinking that other-\r\nwise the name would be too long.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, I received from the Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution a certificate of membership made out to Mary [25]\r\nBaker Eddy, and thereafter adopted that form of signature,\r\nexcept in connection with my published works.\r\n\r\n[Page xi.]\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Science and Health having been [1]\r\ncopyrighted at the date of its issue, 1875, in my name\r\nof Glover, caused me to retain the initial “G” on my\r\nsubsequent books.\r\n\r\nThese pages, although a reproduction of what has [5]\r\nbeen written, are still in advance of their time; and are\r\nrichly rewarded by what they have hitherto achieved for\r\nthe race. While no offering can liquidate one’s debt of\r\ngratitude to God, the fervent heart and willing hand are\r\nnot unknown to nor unrewarded by Him. [10]\r\n\r\nMay this volume be to the reader a graphic guide-\r\nbook, pointing the path, dating the unseen, and enabling\r\nhim to walk the untrodden in the hitherto unexplored\r\nfields of Science. At each recurring holiday the Christian\r\nScientist will find herein a “canny” crumb; and thus [15]\r\nmay time’s pastimes become footsteps to joys eternal.\r\n\r\nRealism will at length be found to surpass imagination,\r\nand to suit and savor all literature. The shuttlecock of\r\nreligious intolerance will fall to the ground, if there be\r\nno battledores to fling it back and forth. It is reason for [20]\r\nrejoicing that the _vox populi_ is inclined to grant us peace,\r\ntogether with pardon for the preliminary battles that\r\npurchased it.\r\n\r\nWith tender tread, thought sometimes walks in memory,\r\nthrough the dim corridors of years, on to old battle- [25]\r\ngrounds, there sadly to survey the fields of the slain and\r\nthe enemy’s losses. In compiling this work, I have tried\r\n\r\n[Page xii.]\r\n\r\nto remove the pioneer signs and ensigns of war, and to [1]\r\nretain at this date the privileged armaments of peace.\r\n\r\nWith armor on, I continue the march, command and\r\ncountermand; meantime interluding with loving thought\r\nthis afterpiece of battle. Supported, cheered, I take my [5]\r\npen and pruning-hook, to “learn war no more,” and with\r\nstrong wing to lift my readers above the smoke of conflict\r\ninto light and liberty.\r\n\r\nMary Baker Eddy\r\n\r\nCONCORD, N.H.\r\nJanuary, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProspectus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 1.]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek looked longingly for the Olym- [1]\r\npiad. The Chaldee watched the appearing of a\r\nstar; to him, no higher destiny dawned on the dome\r\nof being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heav- [5]\r\nens. The meek Nazarene, the scoffed of all scoffers,\r\nsaid, “Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye\r\nnot discern the signs of the times?”—for he forefelt\r\nand foresaw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated\r\nby sinners. [10]\r\n\r\nTo kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude, the\r\nnew idea that comes welling up from infinite Truth needs\r\nto be understood. The seer of this age should be a\r\nsage.\r\n\r\nHumility is the stepping-stone to a higher recognition [15]\r\nof Deity. The mounting sense gathers fresh forms and\r\nstrange fire from the ashes of dissolving self, and drops\r\nthe world. Meekness heightens immortal attributes\r\nonly by removing the dust that dims them. Goodness\r\nreveals another scene and another self seemingly rolled [20]\r\nup in shades, but brought to light by the evolutions of\r\n\r\n[Page 2.]\r\n\r\nadvancing thought, whereby we discern the power of [1]\r\nTruth and Love to heal the sick.\r\n\r\nPride is ignorance; those assume most who have the\r\nleast wisdom or experience; and they steal from their\r\nneighbor, because they have so little of their own. [5]\r\n\r\nThe signs of these times portend a long and strong\r\ndetermination of mankind to cleave to the world, the\r\nflesh, and evil, causing great obscuration of Spirit.\r\nWhen we remember that God is just, and admit the\r\ntotal depravity of mortals, _alias_ mortal mind,—and that [10]\r\nthis Adam legacy must first be seen, and then must be\r\nsubdued and recompensed by justice, the eternal attri-\r\nbute of Truth,—the outlook demands labor, and the\r\nlaborers seem few. To-day we behold but the first\r\nfaint view of a more spiritual Christianity, that embraces [15]\r\na deeper and broader philosophy and a more rational and\r\ndivine healing. The time approaches when divine Life,\r\nTruth, and Love will be found alone the remedy for sin,\r\nsickness, and death; when God, man’s saving Principle,\r\nand Christ, the spiritual idea of God, will be revealed. [20]\r\n\r\nMan’s probation after death is the necessity of his\r\nimmortality; for good dies not and evil is self-destruc-\r\ntive, therefore evil must be mortal and self-destroyed.\r\nIf man should not progress after death, but should re-\r\nmain in error, he would be inevitably self-annihilated. [25]\r\nThose upon whom “the second death hath no power”\r\nare those who progress here and hereafter out of evil,\r\ntheir mortal element, and into good that is immortal;\r\nthus laying off the material beliefs that war against\r\nSpirit, and putting on the spiritual elements in divine [30]\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nWhile we entertain decided views as to the best method\r\n\r\n[Page 3.]\r\n\r\nfor elevating the race physically, morally, and spiritually, [1]\r\nand shall express these views as duty demands, we\r\nshall claim no especial gift from our divine origin, no\r\nsupernatural power. If we regard good as more natural\r\nthan evil, and spiritual understanding—the true knowl- [5]\r\nedge of God—as imparting the only power to heal the\r\nsick and the sinner, we shall demonstrate in our lives the\r\npower of Truth and Love.\r\n\r\nThe lessons we learn in divine Science are applica-\r\nble to all the needs of man. Jesus taught them for this [10]\r\nvery purpose; and his demonstration hath taught us\r\nthat “through his stripes”—his life-experience—and\r\ndivine Science, brought to the understanding through\r\nChrist, the Spirit-revelator, is man healed and saved.\r\nNo opinions of mortals nor human hypotheses enter this [15]\r\nline of thought or action. Drugs, inert matter, never are\r\nneeded to aid spiritual power. Hygiene, manipulation,\r\nand mesmerism are not Mind’s medicine. The Principle\r\nof all cure is God, unerring and immortal Mind.\r\nWe have learned that the erring or mortal thought holds [20]\r\nin itself all sin, sickness, and death, and imparts these\r\nstates to the body; while the supreme and perfect Mind,\r\nas seen in the truth of being, antidotes and destroys these\r\nmaterial elements of sin and death.\r\n\r\nBecause God is supreme and omnipotent, _materia_ [25]\r\n_medica_, hygiene, and animal magnetism are impotent;\r\nand their only supposed efficacy is in apparently delud-\r\ning reason, denying revelation, and dethroning Deity.\r\nThe tendency of mental healing is to uplift mankind; but\r\nthis method perverted, is “Satan let loose.” Hence the [30]\r\ndeep demand for the Science of psychology to meet sin,\r\nand uncover it; thus to annihilate hallucination.\r\n\r\n[Page 4.]\r\n\r\nThought imbued with purity, Truth, and Love, in- [1]\r\nstructed in the Science of metaphysical healing, is the\r\nmost potent and desirable remedial agent on the earth.\r\nAt this period there is a marked tendency of mortal\r\nmind to plant mental healing on the basis of hypnotism, [5]\r\ncalling this method “mental science.” All _Science_ is\r\n_Christian_ Science; the Science of the Mind that is God,\r\nand of the universe as His idea, and their relation to each\r\nother. Its only power to heal is its power to do good,\r\nnot evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Timely Issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this date, 1883, a newspaper edited and published\r\nby the Christian Scientists has become a necessity. Many\r\nquestions important to be disposed of come to the Col-\r\nlege and to the practising students, yet but little time [15]\r\nhas been devoted to their answer. Further enlight-\r\nenment is necessary for the age, and a periodical de-\r\nvoted to this work seems alone adequate to meet the\r\nrequirement. Much interest is awakened and expressed\r\non the subject of metaphysical healing, but in many [20]\r\nminds it is confounded with isms, and even infidelity, so\r\nthat its religious specialty and the vastness of its worth\r\nare not understood.\r\n\r\nIt is often said, “You must have a very strong will-\r\npower to heal,” or, “It must require a great deal of faith [25]\r\nto make your demonstrations.” When it is answered\r\nthat there is no will-power required, and that something\r\nmore than faith is necessary, we meet with an expression\r\nof incredulity. It is not alone the mission of Christian\r\nScience to heal the sick, but to destroy sin in mortal [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 5.]\r\n\r\nthought. This work well done will elevate and purify [1]\r\nthe race. It cannot fail to do this if we devote our best\r\nenergies to the work.\r\n\r\nScience reveals man as spiritual, harmonious, and eter-\r\nnal. This should be understood. Our College should [5]\r\nbe crowded with students who are willing to consecrate\r\nthemselves to this Christian work. Mothers should be\r\nable to produce perfect health and perfect morals in their\r\nchildren—and ministers, to heal the sick—by study-\r\ning this scientific method of practising Christianity. [10]\r\nMany say, “I should like to study, but have not suffi-\r\ncient faith that I have the power to heal.” The healing\r\npower is Truth and Love, and these do not fail in the\r\ngreatest emergencies.\r\n\r\n_Materia medica_ says, “I can do no more. I have [15]\r\ndone all that can be done. There is nothing to build\r\nupon. There is no longer any reason for hope.” Then\r\nmetaphysics comes in, armed with the power of Spirit,\r\nnot matter, takes up the case hopefully and builds on\r\nthe stone that the builders have rejected, and is suc- [20]\r\ncessful.\r\n\r\nMetaphysical therapeutics can seem a miracle and a\r\nmystery to those only who do not understand the grand\r\nreality that Mind controls the body. They acknowledge\r\nan erring or mortal mind, but believe it to be brain mat- [25]\r\nter. That man is the idea of infinite Mind, always perfect\r\nin God, in Truth, Life, and Love, is something not easily\r\naccepted, weighed down as is mortal thought with mate-\r\nrial beliefs. That which never existed, can seem solid\r\nsubstance to this thought. It is much easier for people [30]\r\nto believe that the body affects the mind, than that the\r\nmind affects the body.\r\n\r\n[Page 6.]\r\n\r\nWe hear from the pulpits that sickness is sent as a [1]\r\ndiscipline to bring man nearer to God,—even though\r\nsickness often leaves mortals but little time free from\r\ncomplaints and fretfulness, and Jesus cast out disease as\r\nevil. [5]\r\n\r\nThe most of our Christian Science practitioners have\r\nplenty to do, and many more are needed for the ad-\r\nvancement of the age. At present the majority of the\r\nacute cases are given to the M. D.’s, and only those\r\ncases that are pronounced incurable are passed over to [10]\r\nthe Scientist. The healing of such cases should cer-\r\ntainly prove to all minds the power of metaphysics over\r\nphysics; and it surely does, to many thinkers, as the\r\nrapid growth of the work shows. At no distant day,\r\nChristian healing will rank far in advance of allopathy [15]\r\nand homœopathy; for Truth must ultimately succeed\r\nwhere error fails.\r\n\r\nMind governs all. That we exist in God, perfect,\r\nthere is no doubt, for the conceptions of Life, Truth, and\r\nLove must be perfect; and with that basic truth we con- [20]\r\nquer sickness, sin, and death. Frequently it requires\r\ntime to overcome the patient’s faith in drugs and mate-\r\nrial hygiene; but when once convinced of the uselessness\r\nof such material methods, the gain is rapid.\r\n\r\nIt is a noticeable fact, that in families where laws [25]\r\nof health are strictly enforced, great caution is observed\r\nin regard to diet, and the conversation chiefly confined\r\nto the ailments of the body, there is the most sickness.\r\nTake a large family of children where the mother has\r\nall that she can attend to in keeping them clothed and\r\nfed, and health is generally the rule; whereas, in small\r\nfamilies of one or two children, sickness is by no means\r\n\r\n[Page 7.]\r\n\r\nthe exception. These children must not be allowed to [1]\r\neat certain food, nor to breathe the cold air, because\r\nthere is danger in it; when they perspire, they must be\r\nloaded down with coverings until their bodies become\r\ndry,—and the mother of one child is often busier than [5]\r\nthe mother of eight.\r\n\r\nGreat charity and humility is necessary in this work\r\nof healing. The loving patience of Jesus, we must\r\nstrive to emulate. “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as\r\nthyself” has daily to be exemplified; and, although [10]\r\nskepticism and incredulity prevail in places where\r\none would least expect it, it harms not; for if serving\r\nChrist, Truth, of what can mortal opinion avail? Cast\r\nnot your pearls before swine; but if you cannot bring\r\npeace to all, you can to many, if faithful laborers in His [15]\r\nvineyard.\r\n\r\nLooking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally\r\nreflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease\r\nseems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to\r\nmany minds, to be depicted in some future time upon [20]\r\nthe body. A periodical of our own will counteract to\r\nsome extent this public nuisance; for through our paper,\r\nat the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able\r\nto reach many homes with healing, purifying thought.\r\nA great work already has been done, and a greater work [25]\r\nyet remains to be done. Oftentimes we are denied the\r\nresults of our labors because people do not understand\r\nthe nature and power of metaphysics, and they think\r\nthat health and strength would have returned natu-\r\nrally without any assistance. This is not so much from [30]\r\na lack of justice, as it is that the _mens populi_ is not suffi-\r\nciently enlightened on this great subject. More thought\r\n\r\n[Page 8.]\r\n\r\nis given to material illusions than to spiritual facts. If [1]\r\nwe can aid in abating suffering and diminishing sin,\r\nwe shall have accomplished much; but if we can bring\r\nto the general thought this great fact that drugs do not,\r\ncannot, produce health and harmony, since “in Him [5]\r\n[Mind] we live, and move, and have our being,” we shall\r\nhave done more.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Your Enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is thine enemy that thou shouldst love him? Is\r\nit a creature or a thing outside thine own creation? [10]\r\n\r\nCan you see an enemy, except you first formulate this\r\nenemy and then look upon the object of your own conception?\r\nWhat is it that harms you? Can height, or\r\ndepth, or any other creature separate you from the\r\nLove that is omnipresent good,—that blesses infinitely [15]\r\none and all?\r\n\r\nSimply count your enemy to be that which defiles,\r\ndefaces, and dethrones the Christ-image that you should\r\nreflect. Whatever purifies, sanctifies, and consecrates\r\nhuman life, is not an enemy, however much we suffer in [20]\r\nthe process. Shakespeare writes: “Sweet are the uses\r\nof adversity.” Jesus said: “Blessed are ye, when men\r\nshall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all\r\nmanner of evil against you _falsely_, for my sake; ... for\r\nso persecuted they the prophets which were before [25]\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew law with its “Thou shalt not,” its de-\r\nmand and sentence, can only be fulfilled through the\r\ngospel’s benediction. Then, “Blessed are ye,” inso-\r\n\r\n[Page 9.]\r\n\r\nmuch as the consciousness of good, grace, and peace, [1]\r\ncomes through affliction rightly understood, as sanctified\r\nby the purification it brings to the flesh,—to pride, self-\r\nignorance, self-will, self-love, self-justification. Sweet,\r\nindeed, are these uses of His rod! Well is it that the [5]\r\nShepherd of Israel passes all His flock under His rod\r\ninto His fold; thereby numbering them, and giving them\r\nrefuge at last from the elements of earth.\r\n\r\n“Love thine enemies” is identical with “Thou hast\r\nno enemies.” Wherein is this conclusion relative to [10]\r\nthose who have hated thee without a cause? Simply, in\r\nthat those unfortunate individuals are virtually thy best\r\nfriends. Primarily and ultimately, they are doing thee\r\ngood far beyond the present sense which thou canst entertain\r\nof good. [15]\r\n\r\nWhom we call friends seem to sweeten life’s cup and\r\nto fill it with the nectar of the gods. We lift this cup\r\nto our lips; but it slips from our grasp, to fall in frag-\r\nments before our eyes. Perchance, having tasted its\r\ntempting wine, we become intoxicated; become lethar- [20]\r\ngic, dreamy objects of self-satisfaction; else, the con-\r\ntents of this cup of selfish human enjoyment having lost\r\nits flavor, we voluntarily set it aside as tasteless and\r\nunworthy of human aims.\r\n\r\nAnd wherefore our failure longer to relish this fleet- [25]\r\ning sense, with its delicious forms of friendship,\r\nwherewith mortals become educated to gratification in\r\npersonal pleasure and trained in treacherous peace?\r\nBecause it is the great and only danger in the path\r\nthat winds upward. A false sense of what consti- [30]\r\ntutes happiness is more disastrous to human progress\r\nthan all that an enemy or enmity can obtrude upon\r\n\r\n[Page 10.]\r\n\r\nthe mind or engraft upon its purposes and achievements [1]\r\nwherewith to obstruct life’s joys and enhance its sor-\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nWe have no enemies. Whatever envy, hatred, revenge\r\n—the most remorseless motives that govern mortal mind [5]\r\n—whatever these try to do, shall “work together for good\r\nto them that love God.”\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause He has called His own, armed them, equipped\r\nthem, and furnished them defenses impregnable. Their [10]\r\nGod will not let them be lost; and if they fall they shall\r\nrise again, stronger than before the stumble. The good\r\ncannot lose their God, their help in times of trouble.\r\nIf they mistake the divine command, they will recover\r\nit, countermand their order, retrace their steps, and [15]\r\nreinstate His orders, more assured to press on safely.\r\nThe best lesson of their lives is gained by crossing\r\nswords with temptation, with fear and the besetments\r\nof evil; insomuch as they thereby have tried their\r\nstrength and proven it; insomuch as they have found [20]\r\ntheir strength made perfect in weakness, and their fear\r\nis self-immolated.\r\n\r\nThis destruction is a moral chemicalization, wherein\r\nold things pass away and all things become new. The\r\nworldly or material tendencies of human affections and [25]\r\npursuits are thus annihilated; and this is the advent of\r\nspiritualization. Heaven comes down to earth, and\r\nmortals learn at last the lesson, “I have no enemies.”\r\n\r\nEven in belief you have but one (that, not in reality),\r\nand this one enemy is yourself—your erroneous belief [30]\r\nthat you have enemies; that evil is real; that aught but\r\ngood exists in Science. Soon or late, your enemy will\r\n\r\n[Page 11.]\r\n\r\nwake from his delusion to suffer for his evil intent; to [1]\r\nfind that, though thwarted, its punishment is tenfold.\r\n\r\nLove is the fulfilling of the law: it is grace, mercy,\r\nand justice. I used to think it sufficiently just to abide\r\nby our State statutes; that if a man should aim a ball at [5]\r\nmy heart, and I by firing first could kill him and save\r\nmy own life, that this was right. I thought, also, that\r\nif I taught indigent students gratuitously, afterwards\r\nassisting them pecuniarily, and did not cease teachi\r\ning the wayward ones at close of the class term, but [10]\r\nfollowed them with precept upon precept; that if my\r\ninstructions had healed them and shown them the sure way\r\nof salvation,—I had done my whole duty to students.\r\n\r\nLove metes not out human justice, but divine mercy.\r\nIf one’s life were attacked, and one could save it only [15]\r\nin accordance with common law, by taking another’s,\r\nwould one sooner give up his own? We must love our\r\nenemies in all the manifestations wherein and whereby\r\nwe love our friends; must even try not to expose their\r\nfaults, but to do them good whenever opportunity [20]\r\noccurs. To mete out human justice to those who per-\r\nsecure and despitefully use one, is not leaving all retribu-\r\ntion to God and returning blessing for cursing. If special\r\nopportunity for doing good to one’s enemies occur not,\r\none can include them in his general effort to benefit the [25]\r\nrace. Because I can do much general good to such as\r\nhate me, I do it with earnest, special care—since they\r\npermit me no other way, though with tears have I striven\r\nfor it. When smitten on one cheek, I have turned the\r\nother: I have but two to present. [30]\r\n\r\nI would enjoy taking by the hand all who love me not,\r\nand saying to them, “_I_ love _you_, and would not know-\r\n\r\n[Page 12.]\r\n\r\ningly harm you.” _Because_ I thus feel, I say to others: [1]\r\nHate no one; for hatred is a plague-spot that spreads\r\nits virus and kills at last. If indulged, it masters us;\r\nbrings suffering upon suffering to its possessor, through-\r\nout time and beyond the grave. If you have been badly [5]\r\nwronged, forgive and forget: God will recompense this\r\nwrong, and punish, more severely than you could, him\r\nwho has striven to injure you. Never return evil for evil;\r\nand, above all, do not fancy that you have been wronged\r\nwhen you have not been. [10]\r\n\r\nThe present is ours; the future, big with events.\r\nEvery man and woman should be to-day a law to him-\r\nself, herself,—a law of loyalty to Jesus’ Sermon on the\r\nMount. The means for sinning unseen and unpunished\r\nhave so increased that, unless one be watchful and stead- [15]\r\nfast in Love, one’s temptations to sin are increased a\r\nhundredfold. Mortal mind at this period mutely works\r\nin the interest of both good and evil in a manner least\r\nunderstood; hence the need of watching, and the danger\r\nof yielding to temptation from causes that at former [20]\r\nperiods in human history were not existent. The action\r\nand effects of this so-called human mind in its silent argu-\r\nments, are yet to be uncovered and summarily dealt with\r\nby divine justice.\r\n\r\nIn Christian Science, the law of Love rejoices the heart; [25]\r\nand Love is Life and Truth. Whatever manifests aught\r\nelse in its effects upon mankind, demonstrably is not Love.\r\nWe should measure our love for God by our love for man;\r\nand our sense of Science will be measured by our obedience\r\nto God,—fulfilling the law of Love, doing good to all; [30]\r\nimparting, so far as we reflect them, Truth, Life, and Love\r\nto all within the radius of our atmosphere of thought.\r\n\r\n[Page 13.]\r\n\r\nThe only justice of which I feel at present capable, [1]\r\nis mercy and charity toward every one,—just so far as\r\none and all permit me to exercise these sentiments toward\r\nthem,—taking special care to mind my own business.\r\n\r\nThe falsehood, ingratitude, misjudgment, and sharp [5]\r\nreturn of evil for good—yea, the real wrongs (if wrong\r\ncan be real) which I have long endured at the hands of\r\nothers—have most happily wrought out for me the law\r\nof loving mine enemies. This law I now urge upon the\r\nsolemn consideration of all Christian Scientists. Jesus [10]\r\nsaid, “If ye love them which love you, what thank have\r\nye? for sinners also love those that love them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Theism.\r\n\r\n\r\nScholastic theology elaborates the proposition that\r\nevil is a factor of good, and that to believe in the reality [15]\r\nof evil is essential to a rounded sense of the existence of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThis frail hypothesis is founded upon the basis of mate-\r\nrial and mortal evidence—only upon what the shifting\r\nmortal senses confirm and frail human reason accepts. [20]\r\nThe Science of Soul reverses this proposition, overturns\r\nthe testimony of the five erring senses, and reveals in\r\nclearer divinity the existence of good only; that is, of\r\nGod and His idea.\r\n\r\nThis postulate of divine Science only needs to be con- [25]\r\nceded, to afford opportunity for proof of its correctness\r\nand the clearer discernment of good.\r\n\r\nSeek the Anglo-Saxon term for God, and you will\r\nfind it to be good; then define good as God, and you\r\nwill find that good is omnipotence, has all power; it fills [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 14.]\r\n\r\nall space, being omnipresent; hence, there is neither place [1]\r\nnor power left for evil. Divest your thought, then, of\r\nthe mortal and material view which contradicts the ever-\r\npresence and all-power of good; take in only the immor-\r\ntal facts which include these, and where will you see or [5]\r\nfeel evil, or find its existence necessary either to the origin\r\nor ultimate of good?\r\n\r\nIt is urged that, from his original state of perfec-\r\ntion, man has fallen into the imperfection that requires\r\nevil through which to develop good. Were we to [10]\r\nadmit this vague proposition, the Science of man could\r\nnever be learned; for in order to learn Science, we\r\nbegin with the correct statement, with harmony and\r\nits Principle; and if man has lost his Principle and\r\nits harmony, from evidences before him he is inca- [15]\r\npable of knowing the facts of existence and its con-\r\ncomitants: therefore to him evil is as real and eternal\r\nas good, God! This awful deception is evil’s umpire\r\nand empire, that good, God, understood, forcibly\r\ndestroys. [20]\r\n\r\nWhat appears to mortals from their standpoint to be\r\nthe necessity for evil, is proven by the law of opposites\r\nto be without necessity. Good is the primitive Princi-\r\nple of man; and evil, good’s opposite, has no Principle,\r\nand is not, and cannot be, the derivative of good. [25]\r\nThus evil is neither a primitive nor a derivative, but\r\nis suppositional; in other words, a lie that is incapable\r\nof proof—therefore, wholly problematical.\r\n\r\nThe Science of Truth annihilates error, deprives evil\r\nof all power, and thereby destroys all error, sin, sickness, [30]\r\ndisease, and death. But the sinner is not sheltered from\r\nsuffering from sin: he makes a great reality of evil, iden-\r\n\r\n[Page 15.]\r\n\r\ntifies himself with it, fancies he finds pleasure in it, and [1]\r\nwill reap what he sows; hence the sinner must endure\r\nthe effects of his delusion until he awakes from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Paul speaks of the new birth as “waiting for the [5]\r\nadoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.” The\r\ngreat Nazarene Prophet said, “Blessed are the pure in\r\nheart: for they shall see God.” Nothing aside from the\r\nspiritualization—yea, the highest Christianization—of\r\nthought and desire, can give the true perception of God [10]\r\nand divine Science, that results in health, happiness, and\r\nholiness.\r\n\r\nThe new birth is not the work of a moment. It begins\r\nwith moments, and goes on with years; moments of sur-\r\nrender to God, of childlike trust and joyful adoption [15]\r\nof good; moments of self-abnegation, self-consecration,\r\nheaven-born hope, and spiritual love.\r\n\r\nTime may commence, but it cannot complete, the\r\nnew birth: eternity does this; for progress is the law\r\nof infinity. Only through the sore travail of mortal mind [20]\r\nshall soul as sense be satisfied, and man awake in His\r\nlikeness. What a faith-lighted thought is this! that\r\nmortals can lay off the “old man,” until man is found\r\nto be the image of the infinite good that we name God,\r\nand the fulness of the stature of man in Christ appears. [25]\r\n\r\nIn mortal and material man, goodness seems in em-\r\nbryo. By suffering for sin, and the gradual fading out\r\nof the mortal and material sense of man, thought is de-\r\nveloped into an infant Christianity; and, feeding at first\r\non the milk of the Word, it drinks in the sweet revealings [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 16.]\r\n\r\nof a new and more spiritual Life and Love. These nourish [1]\r\nthe hungry hope, satisfy more the cravings for immor-\r\ntality, and so comfort, cheer, and bless one, that he saith:\r\nIn mine infancy, this is enough of heaven to come down\r\nto earth. [5]\r\n\r\nBut, as one grows into the manhood or womanhood\r\nof Christianity, one finds so much lacking, and so very\r\nmuch requisite to become wholly Christlike, that one\r\nsaith: The Principle of Christianity is infinite: it is\r\nindeed God; and this infinite Principle hath infinite [10]\r\nclaims on man, and these claims are divine, not human;\r\nand man’s ability to meet them is from God; for, being\r\nHis likeness and image, man must reflect the full\r\ndominion of Spirit—even its supremacy over sin, sick-\r\nness, and death. [15]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the awakening from the dream of life\r\nin matter, to the great fact that _God is the only Life_;\r\nthat, therefore, we must entertain a higher sense of both\r\nGod and man. We must learn that God is infinitely\r\nmore than a person, or finite form, can contain; that [20]\r\nGod is a divine _Whole_, and _All_, an all-pervading in-\r\ntelligence and Love, a divine, infinite Principle; and\r\nthat Christianity is a divine Science. This newly\r\nawakened consciousness is wholly spiritual; it emanates\r\nfrom Soul instead of body, and is the new birth begun [25]\r\nin Christian Science.\r\n\r\nNow, dear reader, pause for a moment with me, earn-\r\nestly to contemplate this new-born spiritual altitude; for\r\nthis statement demands demonstration.\r\n\r\nHere you stand face to face with the laws of infinite [30]\r\nSpirit, and behold for the first time the irresistible con-\r\nflict between the flesh and Spirit. You stand before the\r\n\r\n[Page 17.]\r\n\r\nawful detonations of Sinai. You hear and record the [1]\r\nthunderings of the spiritual law of Life, as opposed to\r\nthe material law of death; the spiritual law of Love, as\r\nopposed to the material sense of love; the law of om-\r\nnipotent harmony and good, as opposed to any supposi- [5]\r\ntitious law of sin, sickness, or death. And, before the\r\nflames have died away on this mount of revelation, like\r\nthe patriarch of old, you take off your shoes—lay aside\r\nyour material appendages, human opinions and doc-\r\ntrines, give up your more material religion with its rites [10]\r\nand ceremonies, put off your _materia medica_ and hygiene\r\nas worse than useless—to sit at the feet of Jesus. Then,\r\nyou meekly bow before the Christ, the spiritual idea\r\nthat our great Master gave of the power of God to heal\r\nand to save. Then it is that you behold for the first [15]\r\ntime the divine Principle that redeems man from under\r\nthe curse of materialism,—sin, disease, and death.\r\nThis spiritual birth opens to the enraptured understand-\r\ning a much higher and holier conception of the supremacy\r\nof Spirit, and of man as His likeness, whereby man reflects [20]\r\nthe divine power to heal the sick.\r\n\r\nA material or human birth is the appearing of a mor-\r\ntal, not the immortal man. This birth is more or less\r\nprolonged and painful, according to the timely or un-\r\ntimely circumstances, the normal or abnormal material [25]\r\nconditions attending it.\r\n\r\nWith the spiritual birth, man’s primitive, sinless,\r\nspiritual existence dawns on human thought,—through\r\nthe travail of mortal mind, hope deferred, the perishing\r\npleasure and accumulating pains of sense,—by which [30]\r\none loses himself as matter, and gains a truer sense of\r\nSpirit and spiritual man.\r\n\r\n[Page 18.]\r\n\r\nThe purification or baptismals that come from Spirit, [1]\r\ndevelop, step by step, the original likeness of perfect man,\r\nand efface the mark of the beast. “Whom the Lord\r\nloveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom\r\nHe receiveth;” therefore rejoice in tribulation, and wel- [5]\r\ncome these spiritual signs of the new birth under the law\r\nand gospel of Christ, Truth.\r\n\r\nThe prominent laws which forward birth in the divine\r\norder of Science, are these: “Thou shalt have no other\r\ngods before me;” “Love thy neighbor as thyself,” [10]\r\nThese commands of infinite wisdom, translated into\r\nthe new tongue, their spiritual meaning, signify: Thou\r\nshalt love Spirit only, not its opposite, in every God-\r\nquality, even in substance; thou shalt recognize thy-\r\nself as God’s spiritual child only, and the true man [15]\r\nand true woman, the all-harmonious “male and female,”\r\nas of spiritual origin, God’s reflection,—thus as chil-\r\ndren of one common Parent,—wherein and whereby\r\nFather, Mother, and child are the divine Principle and\r\ndivine idea, even the divine “Us”—one in good, and [20]\r\ngood in One.\r\n\r\nWith this recognition man could never separate him-\r\nself from good, God; and he would necessarily entertain\r\nhabitual love for his fellow-man. Only by admitting\r\nevil as a reality, and entering into a state of evil [25]\r\nthoughts, can we in belief separate one man’s interests\r\nfrom those of the whole human family, or thus attempt\r\nto separate Life from God. This is the mistake that\r\ncauses much that must be repented of and overcome.\r\nNot to know what is blessing you, but to believe that [30]\r\naught that God sends is unjust,—or that those whom\r\nHe commissions bring to you at His demand that which\r\n\r\n[Page 19.]\r\n\r\nis unjust,—is wrong and cruel. Envy, evil thinking, [1]\r\nevil speaking, covetousness, lust, hatred, malice, are\r\nalways wrong, and will break the rule of Christian\r\nScience and prevent its demonstration; but the rod of\r\nGod, and the obedience demanded of His servants in [5]\r\ncarrying out what He teaches them,—these are never\r\nunmerciful, never unwise.\r\n\r\nThe task of healing the sick is far lighter than that\r\nof so teaching the divine Principle and rules of Chris-\r\ntian Science as to lift the affections and motives of men [10]\r\nto adopt them and bring them out in human lives. He\r\nwho has named the name of Christ, who has virtually\r\naccepted the divine claims of Truth and Love in divine\r\nScience, is daily departing from evil; and all the wicked\r\nendeavors of suppositional demons can never change the [15]\r\ncurrent of that life from steadfastly flowing on to God,\r\nits divine source.\r\n\r\nBut, taking the livery of heaven wherewith to cover\r\niniquity, is the most fearful sin that mortals can commit.\r\nI should have more faith in an honest drugging-doctor, [20]\r\none who abides by his statements and works upon as\r\nhigh a basis as he understands, healing me, than I could\r\nor would have in a smooth-tongued hypocrite or mental\r\nmalpractitioner.\r\n\r\nBetween the centripetal and centrifugal mental forces [25]\r\nof material and spiritual gravitations, we go into or we\r\ngo out of materialism or sin, and choose our course and\r\nits results. Which, then, shall be our choice,—the sin-\r\nful, material, and perishable, or the spiritual, joy-giving,\r\nand eternal? [30]\r\n\r\nThe spiritual sense of Life and its grand pursuits is\r\nof itself a bliss, health-giving and joy-inspiring. This\r\n\r\n[Page 20.]\r\n\r\nsense of Life illumes our pathway with the radiance of [1]\r\ndivine Love; heals man spontaneously, morally and\r\nphysically,—exhaling the aroma of Jesus’ own words,\r\n“Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,\r\nand I will give you rest.” [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. ONE CAUSE AND EFFECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 21.]\r\n\r\nChristian Science begins with the First Com- [1]\r\nmandment of the Hebrew Decalogue, “Thou\r\nshalt have no other gods before me.” It goes on in\r\nperfect unity with Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, and\r\nin that age culminates in the Revelation of St. John, [5]\r\nwho, while on earth and in the flesh, like ourselves,\r\nbeheld “a new heaven and a new earth,”—the spiritual\r\nuniverse, whereof Christian Science now bears testimony.\r\n\r\nOur Master said, “The works that I do shall ye do\r\nalso;” and, “The kingdom of God is within you.” This [10]\r\nmakes practical all his words and works. As the ages\r\nadvance in spirituality, Christian Science will be seen\r\nto depart from the trend of other Christian denomina-\r\ntions in no wise except by increase of spirituality.\r\n\r\nMy first plank in the platform of Christian Science [15]\r\nis as follows: “There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor\r\nsubstance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite\r\nmanifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal\r\nTruth; matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and\r\neternal; matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is [20]\r\nGod, and man is His image and likeness. Therefore man\r\nis not material; he is spiritual.”(1)\r\n\r\n[Page 22.]\r\n\r\nI am strictly a theist—believe in one God, one Christ [1]\r\nor Messiah.\r\n\r\nScience is neither a law of matter nor of man. It is\r\nthe unerring manifesto of Mind, the law of God, its\r\ndivine Principle. Who dare say that matter or [5]\r\nmortals can evolve Science? Whence, then, is it, if not\r\nfrom the divine source, and what, but the contempor-\r\nary of Christianity, so far in advance of human knowl-\r\nedge that mortals must work for the discovery of even a\r\nportion of it? Christian Science translates Mind, God, [10]\r\nto mortals. It is the infinite calculus defining the line,\r\nplane, space, and fourth dimension of Spirit. It abso-\r\nlutely refutes the amalgamation, transmigration, absorp-\r\ntion, or annihilation of individuality. It shows the\r\nimpossibility of transmitting human ills, or evil, from one [15]\r\nindividual to another; that all true thoughts revolve\r\nin God’s orbits: they come from God and return to\r\nHim,—and untruths belong not to His creation, there-\r\nfore these are null and void. It hath no peer, no comp-\r\npetitor, for it dwelleth in Him besides whom “there is [20]\r\nnone other.”\r\n\r\nThat Christian Science is Christian, those who have\r\ndemonstrated it, according to the rules of its divine\r\nPrinciple,—together with the sick, the lame, the deaf, and\r\nthe blind, healed by it,—have proven to a waiting world. [25]\r\nHe who has not tested it, is incompetent to condemn it;\r\nand he who is a willing sinner, cannot demonstrate it.\r\n\r\nA falling apple suggested to Newton more than the\r\nsimple fact cognized by the senses, to which it seemed\r\nto fall by reason of its own ponderosity; but the primal [30]\r\ncause, or Mind-force, invisible to material sense, lay\r\nconcealed in the treasure-troves of Science. True,\r\n\r\n[Page 23.]\r\n\r\nNewton named it gravitation, having learned so much; [1]\r\nbut Science, demanding more, pushes the question:\r\nWhence or what is the power back of gravitation,—the\r\nintelligence that manifests power? Is pantheism true?\r\nDoes mind “sleep in the mineral, or dream in the [5]\r\nanimal, and wake in man”? Christianity answers this\r\nquestion. The prophets, Jesus, and the apostles, demon-\r\nstrated a divine intelligence that subordinates so-called\r\nmaterial laws; and disease, death, winds, and waves,\r\nobey this intelligence. Was it Mind or matter that spake [10]\r\nin creation, “and it was done”? The answer is self-\r\nevident, and the command remains, “Thou shalt have\r\nno other gods before me.”\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the Me spoken of in the First Com-\r\nmandment, must be Mind; for matter is not the Chris- [15]\r\ntian’s God, and is not intelligent. Matter cannot even\r\ntalk; and the serpent, Satan, the first talker in its behalf,\r\nlied. Reason and revelation declare that God is both\r\nnoumenon and phenomena,—the first and only cause.\r\nThe universe, including man, is not a result of atomic [20]\r\naction, material force or energy; it is not organized dust.\r\nGod, Spirit, Mind, are terms synonymous for the one\r\nGod, whose reflection is creation, and man is His image\r\nand likeness. Few there are who comprehend what Chris-\r\ntian Science means by the word _reflection_. God is seen [25]\r\nonly in that which reflects good, Life, Truth, Love—\r\nyea, which manifests all His attributes and power, even\r\nas the human likeness thrown upon the mirror repeats\r\nprecisely the looks and actions of the object in front of it.\r\nAll must be Mind and Mind’s ideas; since, according to [30]\r\nnatural science, God, Spirit, could not change its species\r\nand evolve matter.\r\n\r\n[Page 24.]\r\n\r\nThese facts enjoin the First Commandment; and [1]\r\nknowledge of them makes man spiritually minded. St.\r\nPaul writes: “For to be carnally minded is death; but to\r\nbe spiritually minded is life and peace.” This knowl-\r\nedge came to me in an hour of great need; and I give it [5]\r\nto you as death-bed testimony to the daystar that dawned\r\non the night of material sense. This knowledge is\r\npractical, for it wrought my immediate recovery from\r\nan injury caused by an accident, and pronounced fatal\r\nby the physicians. On the third day thereafter, I called [10]\r\nfor my Bible, and opened it at Matthew ix. 2. As I\r\nread, the healing Truth dawned upon my sense; and\r\nthe result was that I rose, dressed myself, and ever after\r\nwas in better health than I had before enjoyed. That\r\nshort experience included a glimpse of the great fact [15]\r\nthat I have since tried to make plain to others, namely,\r\nLife in and of Spirit; this Life being the sole reality of\r\nexistence. I learned that mortal thought evolves a sub-\r\njective state which it names matter, thereby shutting\r\nout the true sense of Spirit. _Per contra_, Mind and man [20]\r\nare immortal; and knowledge gained from mortal sense\r\nis illusion, error, the opposite of Truth; therefore it\r\ncannot be true. A knowledge of both good and evil\r\n(when good is God, and God is All) is impossible. Speak-\r\ning of the origin of evil, the Master said: “When he [25]\r\nspeaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,\r\nand the father of it.” God warned man not to believe\r\nthe talking serpent, or rather the allegory describing\r\nit. The Nazarene Prophet declared that his followers\r\nshould handle serpents; that is, put down all subtle falsi- [30]\r\nties or illusions, and thus destroy any supposed effect\r\narising from false claims exercising their supposed power\r\n\r\n[Page 25.]\r\n\r\non the mind and body of man against his holiness and [1]\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThat there is but one God or Life, one cause and\r\none effect, is the _multum in parvo_ of Christian Science;\r\nand to my understanding it is the heart of Christianity, [5]\r\nthe religion that Jesus taught and demonstrated. In\r\ndivine Science it is found that matter is a phase of\r\nerror, and that neither one really exists, since God is\r\nTruth, and All-in-all. Christ’s Sermon on the Mount,\r\nin its direct application to human needs, confirms this [10]\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nScience, understood, translates matter into Mind,\r\nrejects all other theories of causation, restores the spir-\r\nitual and original meaning of the Scriptures, and ex-\r\nplains the teachings and life of our Lord. It is religion’s [15]\r\n“new tongue,” with “signs following,” spoken of by\r\nSt. Mark. It gives God’s infinite meaning to mankind,\r\nhealing the sick, casting out evil, and raising the spirit-\r\nually dead. Christianity is Christlike only as it re-\r\niterates the word, repeats the works, and manifests the [20]\r\nspirit of Christ.\r\n\r\nJesus’ only medicine was omnipotent and omniscient\r\nMind. As _omni_ is from the Latin word meaning _all_,\r\nthis medicine is all-power; and omniscience means as\r\nwell, all-science. The sick are more deplorably situated [25]\r\nthan the sinful, if the sick cannot trust God for help and\r\nthe sinful can. If God created drugs good, they cannot be\r\nharmful; if He could create them otherwise, then they\r\nare bad and unfit for man; and if He created drugs for\r\nhealing the sick, why did not Jesus employ them and [30]\r\nrecommend them for that purpose?\r\n\r\nNo human hypotheses, whether in philosophy, medi-\r\n\r\n[Page 26.]\r\n\r\ncine, or religion, can survive the wreck of time; but [1]\r\nwhatever is of God, hath life abiding in it, and ulti-\r\nmately will be known as self-evident truth, as demonstra-\r\nble as mathematics. Each successive period of progress\r\nis a period more humane and spiritual. The only logical [5]\r\nconclusion is that all is Mind and its manifestation, from\r\nthe rolling of worlds, in the most subtle ether, to a potato-\r\npatch.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist ponders the history of a seed, and\r\nbelieves that his crops come from the seedling and the [10]\r\nloam; even while the Scripture declares He made “every\r\nplant of the field before it was in the earth.” The Scien-\r\ntist asks, Whence came the first seed, and what made\r\nthe soil? Was it molecules, or material atoms? Whence\r\ncame the infinitesimals,—from infinite Mind, or from [15]\r\nmatter? If from matter, how did matter originate? Was\r\nit self-existent? Matter is not intelligent, and thus able\r\nto evolve or create itself: it is the very opposite of Spirit,\r\nintelligent, self-creative, and infinite Mind. The belief\r\nof mind in matter is pantheism. Natural history shows [20]\r\nthat neither a genus nor a species produces its opposite.\r\nGod is All, in all. What can be more than All? Noth-\r\ning: and this is just what I call matter, _nothing_. Spirit,\r\nGod, has no antecedent; and God’s consequent is the\r\nspiritual cosmos. The phrase, “express image,” in the [25]\r\ncommon version of Hebrews i. 3, is, in the Greek Tes-\r\ntament, _character_.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures name God as good, and the Saxon\r\nterm for God is also good. From this premise comes\r\nthe logical conclusion that God is naturally and divinely [30]\r\ninfinite good. How, then, can this conclusion change,\r\nor be changed, to mean that good is evil, or the creator\r\n\r\n[Page 27.]\r\n\r\nof evil? What can there be besides infinity? Nothing! [1]\r\nTherefore the Science of good calls evil _nothing_. In\r\ndivine Science the terms God and good, as Spirit, are\r\nsynonymous. That God, good, creates evil, or aught\r\nthat can result in evil,—or that Spirit creates its oppo- [5]\r\nsite, named matter,—are conclusions that destroy their\r\npremise and prove themselves invalid. Here is where\r\nChristian Science sticks to its text, and other systems\r\nof religion abandon their own logic. Here also is found\r\nthe pith of the basal statement, the cardinal point in [10]\r\nChristian Science, that matter and evil (including all\r\ninharmony, sin, disease, death) are _unreal_. Mortals\r\naccept natural science, wherein no species ever pro-\r\nduces its opposite. Then why not accept divine Sci-\r\nence on this ground? since the Scriptures maintain [15]\r\nthis fact by parable and proof, asking, “Do men\r\ngather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?” “Doth a\r\nfountain send forth at the same place sweet water and\r\nbitter?”\r\n\r\nAccording to reason and revelation, evil and matter [20]\r\nare negation: for evil signifies the absence of good, God,\r\nthough God is ever present; and matter claims some-\r\nthing besides God, when God is really _All_. Creation,\r\nevolution, or manifestation,—being in and of Spirit,\r\nMind, and all that really is,—must be spiritual and [25]\r\nmental. This is Science, and is susceptible of proof.\r\n\r\nBut, say you, is a stone spiritual?\r\n\r\nTo erring material sense, No! but to unerring spiritual\r\nsense, it is a small manifestation of Mind, a type of spirit-\r\nual substance, “the substance of things hoped for.” [30]\r\nMortals can know a stone as substance, only by first ad-\r\nmitting that it is substantial. Take away the mortal sense\r\n\r\n[Page 28.]\r\n\r\nof substance, and the stone itself would disappear, only [1]\r\nto reappear in the spiritual sense thereof. Matter can\r\nneither see, hear, feel, taste, nor smell; having no sen-\r\nsation of its own. Perception by the five personal senses\r\nis mental, and dependent on the beliefs that mortals [5]\r\nentertain. Destroy the belief that you can walk, and\r\nvolition ceases; for muscles cannot move without mind.\r\nMatter takes no cognizance of matter. In dreams, things\r\nare only what mortal mind makes them; and the phe-\r\nnomena of mortal life are as dreams; and this so-called [10]\r\nlife is a dream soon told. In proportion as mortals turn\r\nfrom this mortal and material dream, to the true sense\r\nof reality, everlasting Life will be found to be the only\r\nLife. That death does not destroy the beliefs of the flesh,\r\nour Master proved to his doubting disciple, Thomas. Also, [15]\r\nhe demonstrated that divine Science alone can overbear\r\nmateriality and mortality; and this great truth was shown\r\nis by his ascension after death, whereby he arose above\r\nthe illusion of matter.\r\n\r\nThe First Commandment, “Thou shalt have no other [20]\r\ngods before me,” suggests the inquiry, What meaneth\r\nthis Me,—Spirit, or matter? It certainly does not\r\nsignify a graven idol, and must mean Spirit. Then\r\nthe commandment means, Thou shalt recognize no\r\nintelligence nor life in matter; and find neither pleasure [25]\r\nnor pain therein. The Master’s practical knowledge\r\nof this grand verity, together with his divine Love,\r\nhealed the sick and raised the dead. He literally\r\nannulled the claims of physique and of physical law,\r\nby the superiority of the higher law; hence his decla- [30]\r\nration, “These signs shall follow them that believe;...\r\nif they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;\r\n\r\n[Page 29.]\r\n\r\nthey shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” [1]\r\n\r\nDo you believe his words? I do, and that his prom-\r\nise is perpetual. Had it been applicable only to his\r\nimmediate disciples, the pronoun would be _you_, not _them_. [5]\r\nThe purpose of his life-work touches universal human-\r\nity. At another time he prayed, not for the twelve\r\nonly, but “for them also which shall believe on me through\r\ntheir word.”\r\n\r\nThe Christ-healing was practised even before the Christ- [10]\r\nian era; “the Word was with God, and the Word was\r\nGod.” There is, however, no analogy between Christian\r\nScience and spiritualism, or between it and any specu-\r\nlative theory.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, I taught the first student in Christian Science. [15]\r\nSince that date I have known of but fourteen deaths\r\nin the ranks of my about five thousand students. The\r\ncensus since 1875 (the date of the first publication of\r\nmy work, “Science and Health with Key to the Scrip-\r\ntures”) shows that longevity has _increased_. Daily letters [20]\r\ninform me that a perusal of my volume is healing the\r\nwriters of chronic and acute diseases that had defied medi-\r\ncal skill.\r\n\r\nSurely the people of the Occident know that esoteric\r\nmagic and Oriental barbarisms will neither flavor Chris- [25]\r\ntianity nor advance health and length of days.\r\n\r\nMiracles are no infraction of God’s laws; on the\r\ncontrary, they fulfil His laws; for they are the signs fol-\r\nlowing Christianity, whereby matter is proven power-\r\nless and subordinate to Mind. Christians, like students [30]\r\nin mathematics, should be working up to those higher\r\nrules of Life which Jesus taught and proved. Do we\r\n\r\n[Page 30.]\r\n\r\nreally understand the divine Principle of Christianity [1]\r\nbefore we prove it, in at least some feeble demonstra-\r\ntion thereof, according to Jesus’ example in healing the\r\nsick? Should we adopt the “simple addition” in Chris-\r\ntian Science and doubt its higher rules, or despair of [5]\r\nultimately reaching them, even though failing at first to\r\ndemonstrate all the possibilities of Christianity?\r\n\r\nSt. John spiritually discerned and revealed the sum\r\ntotal of transcendentalism. He saw the real earth and\r\nheaven. They were spiritual, not material; and they [10]\r\nwere without pain, sin, or death. Death was not the\r\ndoor to this heaven. The gates thereof he declared were\r\ninlaid with pearl,—likening them to the priceless under-\r\nstanding of man’s real existence, to be recognized here\r\nand now. [15]\r\n\r\nThe great Way-shower illustrated Life unconfined, un-\r\ncontaminated, untrammelled, by matter. He proved the\r\nsuperiority of Mind over the flesh, opened the door to\r\nthe captive, and enabled man to demonstrate the law of\r\nLife, which St. Paul declares “hath made me free from [20]\r\nthe law of sin and death.”\r\n\r\nThe stale saying that Christian Science “is neither\r\nChristian nor science!” is to-day the fossil of wisdom-\r\nless wit, weakness, and superstition. “The fool hath\r\nsaid in his heart, There is no God.” [25]\r\n\r\nTake courage, dear reader, for any seeming mysti-\r\ncism surrounding realism is explained in the Scripture,\r\n“There went up a mist from the earth [matter];” and\r\nthe mist of materialism will vanish as we approach spirit-\r\nuality, the realm of reality; cleanse our lives in Christ’s [30]\r\nrighteousness; bathe in the baptism of Spirit, and awake\r\nin His likeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 31.]\r\n\r\n_What do you consider to be mental malpractice? [1]_\r\n\r\nMental malpractice is a bland denial of Truth,\r\nand is the antipode of Christian Science. To\r\nmentally argue in a manner that can disastrously\r\naffect the happiness of a fellow-being—harm him [5]\r\nmorally, physically, or spiritually—breaks the Golden\r\nRule and subverts the scientific laws of being. This,\r\ntherefore, is not the use but the abuse of mental treat-\r\nment, and is mental malpractice. It is needless to\r\nsay that such a subversion of right is not scientific. Its [10]\r\nclaim to power is in proportion to the faith in evil, and\r\nconsequently to the lack of faith in good. Such false\r\nfaith finds no place in, and receives no aid from, the\r\nPrinciple or the rules of Christian Science; for it denies\r\nthe grand verity of this Science, namely, that God, good, [15]\r\nhas _all_ power.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the individual no alternative but to re-\r\nlinquish his faith in evil, or to argue against his own\r\nconvictions of good and so destroy his power to be or\r\nto do good, because he has no faith in the _omnipotence_ [20]\r\nof God, good. He parts with his understanding of good,\r\nin order to retain his faith in evil and so succeed with his\r\n\r\n[Page 32.]\r\n\r\nwrong argument,—if indeed he desires success in this [1]\r\nbroad road to destruction.\r\n\r\n_How shall we demean ourselves towards the students_\r\n_of disloyal students? And what about that clergyman’s_\r\n_remarks on __“__Christ and Christmas__”__?_ [5]\r\n\r\nFrom this question, I infer that some of my students\r\nseem not to know in what manner they should act towards\r\nthe students of false teachers, or such as have strayed\r\nfrom the rules and divine Principle of Christian Science.\r\nThe query is abnormal, when “precept upon precept; [10]\r\nline upon line” are to be found in the Scriptures, and in\r\nmy books, on this very subject.\r\n\r\nIn Mark, ninth chapter, commencing at the thirty-\r\nthird verse, you will find my views on this subject; love\r\nalone is admissible towards friend and foe. My sym- [15]\r\npathies extend to the above-named class of students more\r\nthan to many others. If I had the time to talk with all\r\nstudents of Christian Science, and correspond with them,\r\nI would gladly do my best towards helping those un-\r\nfortunate seekers after Truth whose teacher is straying [20]\r\nfrom the straight and narrow path. But I have not mo-\r\nments enough in which to give to my own flock all the\r\ntime and attention that they need,—and charity must\r\nbegin at home.\r\n\r\nDistinct denominational and social organizations and [25]\r\nsocieties are at present necessary for the individual,\r\nand for our Cause. But all people can and should be\r\njust, merciful; they should never envy, elbow, slander,\r\nhate, or try to injure, but always should try to bless their\r\nfellow-mortals. [30]\r\n\r\nTo the query in regard to some clergyman’s com-\r\n\r\n[Page 33.]\r\n\r\nments on my illustrated poem, I will say: It is the righteous [1]\r\nprayer that avails with God. Whatever is wrong will\r\nreceive its own reward. The high priests of old caused\r\nthe crucifixion of even the great Master; and thereby\r\nthey lost, and he won, heaven. I love all ministers and [5]\r\nministries of Christ, Truth.\r\n\r\nAll clergymen may not understand the illustrations\r\nin “Christ and Christmas;” or that these refer not to\r\npersonality, but present the type and shadow of Truth’s\r\nappearing in the womanhood as well as in the manhood [10]\r\nof God, our divine Father and Mother.\r\n\r\n_Must I have faith in Christian Science in order to be_\r\n_healed by it?_\r\n\r\nThis is a question that is being asked every day. It\r\nhas not proved impossible to heal those who, when they [15]\r\nbegan treatment, had no faith whatever in the Science,\r\n—other than to place themselves under my care, and\r\nfollow the directions given. Patients naturally gain con-\r\nfidence in Christian Science as they recognize the help\r\nthey derive therefrom. [20]\r\n\r\n_What are the advantages of your system of healing, over_\r\n_the ordinary methods of healing disease?_\r\n\r\nHealing by Christian Science has the following advantages:—\r\n\r\n_First_: It does away with all material medicines, and [25]\r\nrecognizes the fact that, as mortal mind is the cause of\r\nall “the ills that flesh is heir to,” the antidote for sickness,\r\nas well as for sin, may and must be found in mortal mind’s\r\nopposite,—the divine Mind.\r\n\r\n_Second_: It is more effectual than drugs; curing where [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 34.]\r\n\r\nthese fail, and leaving none of the harmful “after effects” [1]\r\nof these in the system; thus proving that metaphysics\r\nis above physics.\r\n\r\n_Third:_ One who has been healed by Christian Sci-\r\nence is not only healed of the disease, but is improved [5]\r\nmorally. The body is governed by mind; and mortal\r\nmind must be improved, before the body is renewed\r\nand harmonious,—since the physique is simply thought\r\nmade manifest.\r\n\r\n_Is spiritualism or mesmerism included in Christian_ [10]\r\n_Science?_\r\n\r\nThey are wholly apart from it. Christian Science is\r\nbased on divine Principle; whereas spiritualism, so far\r\nas I understand it, is a mere speculative opinion and\r\nhuman belief. If the departed were to communicate [15]\r\nwith us, we should see them as they were before death,\r\nand have them with us; after death, they can no more\r\ncome to those they have left, than we, in our present state\r\nof existence, can go to the departed or the adult can re-\r\nturn to his boyhood. We may pass on to their state [20]\r\nof existence, but they cannot return to ours. Man is\r\n_im_-mortal, and there is not a moment when he ceases to\r\nexist. All that are called “communications from spirits,”\r\nlie within the realm of mortal thought on this present plane\r\nof existence, and are the antipodes of Christian Science; [25]\r\nthe immortal and mortal are as direct opposites as light\r\nand darkness.\r\n\r\n_Who is the Founder of mental healing?_\r\n\r\nThe author of “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” who discovered the Science of healing em- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 35.]\r\n\r\nbodied in her works. Years of practical proof, through [1]\r\nhomœopathy, revealed to her the fact that Mind, in-\r\nstead of matter, is the Principle of pathology; and\r\nsubsequently her recovery, through the supremacy of\r\nMind over matter, from a severe casualty pronounced [5]\r\nby the physicians incurable, sealed that proof with the\r\nsignet of Christian Science. In 1883, a million of peo-\r\nple acknowledge and attest the blessings of this mental\r\nsystem of treating disease. Perhaps the following\r\nwords of her husband, the late Dr. Asa G. Eddy, [10]\r\nafford the most concise, yet complete, summary of the\r\nmatter:—\r\n\r\n“Mrs, Eddy’s works are the outgrowths of her life.\r\nI never knew so unselfish an individual.”\r\n\r\n_Will the book Science and Health, that you offer for sale_ [15]\r\n_at three dollars, teach its readers to heal the sick,—or is_\r\n_one obliged to become a student under your personal in-_\r\n_struction? And if one is obliged to study under you, of_\r\n_what benefit is your book?_\r\n\r\nWhy do we read the Bible, and then go to church to [20]\r\nhear it expounded? Only because both are important.\r\nWhy do we read moral science, and then study it at\r\ncollege?\r\n\r\nYou are benefited by reading Science and Health, but\r\nit is greatly to your advantage to be taught its Science [25]\r\nby the author of that work, who explains it in detail.\r\n\r\n_What is immortal Mind?_\r\n\r\nIn reply, we refer you to “Science and Health with\r\nKey to the Scriptures,”(2) Vol. I. page 14: “That which\r\n\r\n[Page 36.]\r\n\r\nis erring, sinful, sick, and dying, termed material or [1]\r\nmortal man, is neither God’s man nor Mind; but to be\r\nunderstood, we shall classify evil and error as mortal\r\nmind, in contradistinction to good and Truth, or the\r\nMind which is immortal.” [5]\r\n\r\n_Do animals and beasts have a mind?_\r\n\r\nBeasts, as well as men, express Mind as their origin;\r\nbut they manifest less of Mind. The first and only\r\ncause is the eternal Mind, which is God, and there is\r\nbut one God. The ferocious mind seen in the beast is [10]\r\nmortal mind, which is harmful and proceeds not from\r\nGod; for His beast is the lion that lieth down with\r\nthe lamb. Appetites, passions, anger, revenge, subtlety,\r\nare the animal qualities of sinning mortals; and the\r\nbeasts that have these propensities express the lower [15]\r\nqualities of the so-called animal man; in other words,\r\nthe nature and quality of mortal mind,—not immortal\r\nMind.\r\n\r\n_What is the distinction between mortal mind and immortal_\r\n_Mind?_ [20]\r\n\r\nMortal mind includes all evil, disease, and death;\r\nalso, all beliefs relative to the so-called material laws,\r\nand all material objects, and the law of sin and death.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture says, “The carnal mind [in other words,\r\nmortal mind] is enmity against God; for it is not sub- [25]\r\nject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” Mortal\r\nmind is an illusion; as much in our waking moments\r\nas in the dreams of sleep. The belief that intelligence,\r\nTruth, and Love, are in matter and separate from God,\r\nis an error; for there is no intelligent evil, and no power [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 37.]\r\n\r\nbesides God, good. God would not be omnipotent if [1]\r\nthere were in reality another mind creating or governing\r\nman or the universe.\r\n\r\nImmortal Mind is God; and this Mind is made\r\nmanifest in all thoughts and desires that draw man- [5]\r\nkind toward purity, health, holiness, and the spiritual\r\nfacts of being.\r\n\r\nJesus recognized this relation so clearly that he said,\r\n“I and my Father are one.” In proportion as we oppose\r\nthe belief in material sense, in sickness, sin, and death, [10]\r\nand recognize ourselves under the control of God,\r\nspiritual and immortal Mind, shall we go on to leave the\r\nanimal for the spiritual, and learn the meaning of those\r\nwords of Jesus, “Go ye into all the world ... heal the\r\nsick.” [15]\r\n\r\n_Can your Science cure intemperance?_\r\n\r\nChristian Science lays the axe at the root of the tree.\r\nIts antidote for all ills is God, the perfect Mind, which\r\ncorrects mortal thought, whence cometh all evil. God\r\ncan and does destroy the thought that leads to moral [20]\r\nor physical death. Intemperance, impurity, sin of every\r\nsort, is destroyed by Truth. The appetite for alcohol\r\nyields to Science as directly and surely as do sickness\r\nand sin.\r\n\r\n_Does Mrs. Eddy take patients?_ [25]\r\n\r\nShe now does not. Her time is wholly devoted to in-\r\nstruction, leaving to her students the work of healing;\r\nwhich, at this hour, is in reality the least difficult of the\r\nlabor that Christian Science demands.\r\n\r\n[Page 38.]\r\n\r\n_Why do you charge for teaching Christian Science, when_ [1]\r\n_all the good we can do must be done freely?_\r\n\r\nWhen teaching imparts the ability to gain and main-\r\ntain health, to heal and elevate man in every line of\r\nlife,—as this teaching certainly does,—is it un- [5]\r\nreasonable to expect in return something to support\r\none’s self and a Cause? If so, our whole system\r\nof education, secular and religious, is at fault, and the\r\ninstructors and philanthropists in our land should ex-\r\npect no compensation. “If we have sown unto you [10]\r\nspiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your\r\ncarnal things?”\r\n\r\n_How happened you to establish a college to instruct in_\r\n_metaphysics, when other institutions find little interest in_\r\n_such a dry and abstract subject?_ [15]\r\n\r\nMetaphysics, as taught by me at the Massachusetts\r\nMetaphysical College, is far from dry and abstract. It\r\nis a Science that has the animus of Truth. Its practical\r\napplication to benefit the race, heal the sick, enlighten\r\nand reform the sinner, makes divine metaphysics need- [20]\r\nful, indispensable. Teaching metaphysics at other col-\r\nleges means, mainly, elaborating a man-made theory,\r\nor some speculative view too vapory and hypothetical\r\nfor questions of practical import.\r\n\r\n_Is it necessary to study your Science in order to be healed_ [25]\r\n_by it and keep well?_\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to make each patient a student\r\nin order to cure his present disease, if this is what\r\nyou mean. Were it so, the Science would be of less\r\n\r\n[Page 39.]\r\n\r\npractical value. Many who apply for help are not [1]\r\nprepared to take a course of instruction in Christian\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nTo avoid being _subject_ to disease, would require the\r\nunderstanding of how you are healed. In 1885, this [5]\r\nknowledge can be obtained in its genuineness at the\r\nMassachusetts Metaphysical College. There are abroad\r\nat this early date some grossly incorrect and false\r\nteachers of what they term Christian Science; of such\r\nbeware. They have risen up in a day to make this claim; [10]\r\nwhereas the Founder of genuine Christian Science has\r\nbeen all her years in giving it birth.\r\n\r\n_Can you take care of yourself?_\r\n\r\nGod giveth to every one this _puissance_; and I have\r\nfaith in His promise, “Lo, I am with you alway”— [15]\r\n_all the way_. Unlike the M. D.’s, Christian Scientists\r\nare not afraid to take their own medicine, for this\r\nmedicine is divine Mind; and from this saving, ex-\r\nhaustless source they intend to fill the human mind with\r\nenough of the leaven of Truth to leaven the whole lump. [20]\r\nThere may be exceptional cases, where one Christian\r\nScientist who has more to meet than others needs support\r\nat times; then, it is right to bear “one another’s burdens,\r\nand so fulfil the law of Christ.”\r\n\r\n_In what way is a Christian Scientist an instrument by_ [25]\r\n_which God reaches others to heal them, and what most_\r\n_obstructs the way?_\r\n\r\nA Christian, or a Christian Scientist, assumes no more\r\nwhen claiming to work with God in healing the sick,\r\nthan in converting the sinner. Divine help is as neces-\r\n\r\n[Page 40.]\r\n\r\nsary in the one case as in the other. The scientific Prin- [1]\r\nciple of healing demands such cooperation; but this\r\nunison and its power would be arrested if one were to\r\nmix material methods with the spiritual,—were to min-\r\ngle hygienic rules, drugs, and prayers in the same pro- [5]\r\ncess,—and thus serve “other gods.” Truth is as\r\neffectual in destroying sickness as in the destruction\r\nof sin.\r\n\r\nIt is often asked, “If Christian Science is the same\r\nmethod of healing that Jesus and the apostles used, [10]\r\nwhy do not its students perform as instantaneous cures\r\nas did those in the first century of the Christian era?”\r\n\r\nIn some instances the students of Christian Science\r\nequal the ancient prophets as healers. All true healing\r\nis governed by, and demonstrated on, the same Princi- [15]\r\nple as theirs; namely, the action of the divine Spirit,\r\nthrough the power of Truth to destroy error, discord\r\nof whatever sort. The reason that the same results fol-\r\nlow not in every ease, is that the student does not in\r\nevery case possess sufficiently the Christ-spirit and its [20]\r\npower to cast out the disease. The Founder of Chris-\r\ntian Science teaches her students that they must possess\r\nthe spirit of Truth and Love, must gain the power\r\nover sin in themselves, or they cannot be instantaneous\r\nhealers. [25]\r\n\r\nIn this Christian warfare the student or practitioner\r\nhas to master those elements of evil too common to other\r\nminds. If it is hate that is holding the purpose to kill\r\nhis patient by mental means, it requires more divine\r\nunderstanding to conquer this sin than to nullify either [30]\r\nthe disease itself or the ignorance by which one unin-\r\ntentionally harms himself or another. An element of\r\n\r\n[Page 41.]\r\n\r\nbrute-force that only the cruel and evil can send forth, is [1]\r\ngiven vent in the diabolical practice of one who, having\r\nlearned the power of liberated thought to do good, per-\r\nverts it, and uses it to accomplish an evil purpose. This\r\nmental malpractice would disgrace Mind-healing, were it [5]\r\nnot that God overrules it, and causes “the wrath of man”\r\nto praise Him. It deprives those who practise it of the\r\npower to heal, and destroys their own possibility of\r\nprogressing.\r\n\r\nThe honest student of Christian Science is purged [10]\r\nthrough Christ, Truth, and thus is ready for victory in\r\nthe ennobling strife. The good fight must be fought by\r\nthose who keep the faith and finish their course. Mental\r\npurgation must go on: it promotes spiritual growth,\r\nscales the mountain of human endeavor, and gains the [15]\r\nsummit in Science that otherwise could not be reached,\r\n—where the struggle with sin is forever done.\r\n\r\n_Can all classes of disease be healed by your method?_\r\n\r\nWe answer, Yes. Mind is the architect that builds\r\nits own idea, and produces all harmony that appears. [20]\r\nThere is no other healer in the case. If mortal mind,\r\nthrough the action of fear, manifests inflammation and a\r\nbelief of chronic or acute disease, by removing the cause\r\nin that so-called mind the effect or disease will disappear\r\nand health will be restored; for health, _alias_ harmony, [25]\r\nis the normal manifestation of man in Science. The\r\ndivine Principle which governs the universe, including\r\nman, if demonstrated, is sufficient for all emergencies.\r\nBut the practitioner may not always prove equal to\r\nbringing out the result of the Principle that he knows to [30]\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\n[Page 42.]\r\n\r\n_After the change called death takes place, do we meet_ [1]\r\n_those gone before?—or does life continue in thought only_\r\n_as in a dream?_\r\n\r\nMan is not annihilated, nor does he lose his identity,\r\nby passing through the belief called death. After the [5]\r\nmomentary belief of dying passes from mortal mind, this\r\nmind is still in a conscious state of existence; and the in-\r\ndividual has but passed through a moment of extreme\r\nmortal fear, to awaken with thoughts, and being, as\r\nmaterial as before. Science and Health clearly states [10]\r\nthat spiritualization of thought is not attained by the death\r\nof the body, but by a conscious union with God. When\r\nwe shall have passed the ordeal called death, or destroyed\r\nthis last enemy, and shall have come upon the same plane\r\nof conscious existence with those gone before, then we [15]\r\nshall be able to communicate with and to recognize them.\r\n\r\nIf, before the change whereby we meet the dear de-\r\nparted, our life-work proves to have been well done, we\r\nshall not have to repeat it; but our joys and means of ad-\r\nvancing will be proportionately increased. [20]\r\n\r\nThe difference between a belief of material existence\r\nand the spiritual fact of Life is, that the former is a dream\r\nand unreal, while the latter is real and eternal. Only\r\nas we understand God, and learn that good, not evil,\r\nlives and is immortal, that immortality exists only in [25]\r\nspiritual perfection, shall we drop our false sense of Life\r\nin sin or sense material, and recognize a better state of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n_Can I be treated without being present during treatment?_\r\n\r\nMind is not confined to limits; and nothing but our [30]\r\nown false admissions prevent us from demonstrating this\r\n\r\n[Page 43.]\r\n\r\ngreat fact. Christian Science, recognizing the capabili- [1]\r\nties of Mind to act of itself, and independent of matter,\r\nenables one to heal cases without even having seen the\r\nindividual,—or simply after having been made ac-\r\nquainted with the mental condition of the patient. [5]\r\n\r\n_Do all who at present claim to be teaching Christian_\r\n_Science, teach it correctly?_\r\n\r\nBy no means: Christian Science is not sufficiently un-\r\nderstood for that. The student of this Science who under-\r\nstands it best, is the one least likely to pour into other [10]\r\nminds a trifling sense of it as being adequate to make safe\r\nand successful practitioners. The simple sense one gains\r\nof this Science through careful, unbiased, contemplative\r\nreading of my books, is far more advantageous to the\r\nsick and to the learner than is or can be the spurious [15]\r\nteaching of those who are spiritually unqualified. The\r\nsad fact at this early writing is, that the letter is gained\r\nsooner than the spirit of Christian Science: time is re-\r\nquired thoroughly to qualify students for the great ordeal\r\nof this century. [20]\r\n\r\nIf one student tries to undermine another, such sinister\r\nrivalry does a vast amount of injury to the Cause. To\r\nfill one’s pocket at the expense of his conscience, or to\r\nbuild on the downfall of others, incapacitates one to\r\npractise or teach Christian Science. The occasional tem- [25]\r\nporary success of such an one is owing, in part, to the im-\r\npossibility for those unacquainted with the mighty Truth\r\nof _Christian_ Science to recognize, as such, the barefaced\r\nerrors that are taught—and the damaging effects these\r\nleave on the practice of the learner, on the Cause, and [30]\r\non the health of the community.\r\n\r\n[Page 44.]\r\n\r\nHonest students speak the truth “according to the [1]\r\npattern showed to thee in the mount,” and live it: these\r\nare not working for emoluments, and may profitably\r\nteach people, who are ready to investigate this subject,\r\nthe rudiments of Christian Science. [5]\r\n\r\n_Can Christian Science cure acute cases where there is_\r\n_necessity for immediate relief, as in membranous croup?_\r\n\r\nThe remedial power of Christian Science is positive,\r\nand its application direct. It cannot fail to heal in\r\nevery case of disease, when conducted by one who un- [10]\r\nderstands this Science sufficiently to demonstrate its\r\nhighest possibilities.\r\n\r\n_If I have the toothache, and nothing stops it until I_\r\n_have the tooth extracted, and then the pain ceases, has_\r\n_the mind, or extracting, or both, caused the pain to_ [15]\r\n_cease?_\r\n\r\nWhat you thought was pain in the bone or nerve, could\r\nonly have been a belief of pain in matter; for matter\r\nhas no sensation. It was a state of mortal thought made\r\nmanifest in the flesh. You call this body matter, when [20]\r\nawake, or when asleep in a dream. That matter can re-\r\nreport pain, or that mind is _in_ matter, reporting sensa-\r\ntions, is but a dream at all times. You believed that if\r\nthe tooth were extracted, the pain would cease: this de-\r\nmand of mortal thought once met, your belief assumed [25]\r\na new form, and said, There is no more pain. When\r\nyour belief in pain ceases, the pain stops; for matter\r\nhas no intelligence of its own. By applying this men-\r\ntal remedy or antidote directly to your belief, you scien-\r\n\r\n[Page 45.]\r\n\r\ntifically prove the fact that Mind is supreme. This is not [1]\r\ndone by will-power, for that is not Science but mesmerism.\r\nThe full understanding that God is Mind, and that mat-\r\nter is but a belief, enables you to control pain. Chris-\r\ntian Science, by means of its Principle of metaphysical [5]\r\nhealing, is able to do more than to heal a toothache;\r\nalthough its power to allay fear, prevent inflammation,\r\nand destroy the necessity for ether—thereby avoiding\r\nthe fatal results that frequently follow the use of that\r\ndrug—render this Science invaluable in the practice [10]\r\nof dentistry.\r\n\r\n_Can an atheist or a profane man be cured by metaphysics,_\r\n_or Christian Science?_\r\n\r\nThe moral status of the man demands the remedy of\r\nTruth more in this than in most cases; therefore, under [15]\r\nthe deific law that supply invariably meets demand, this\r\nScience is effectual in treating moral ailments. Sin is\r\nnot the master of divine Science, but _vice versa_; and\r\nwhen Science in a single instance decides the conflict,\r\nthe patient is better both morally and physically. [20]\r\n\r\n_If God made all that was made, and it was good, where_\r\n_did evil originate?_\r\n\r\nIt never originated or existed as an entity. It is but a\r\nfalse belief; even the belief that God is not what the\r\nScriptures imply Him to be, All-in-all, but that there [25]\r\nis an opposite intelligence or mind termed evil. This\r\nerror of belief is idolatry, having “other gods before me.”\r\nIn John i. 3 we read, “All things were made by Him;\r\nand without Him was not anything made that was made.”\r\n\r\n[Page 46.]\r\n\r\nThe admission of the reality of evil perpetuates the belief [1]\r\nor faith in evil. The Scriptures declare, “To whom ye\r\nyield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are.”\r\nThe leading self-evident proposition of Christian Science\r\nis: good being real, evil, good’s opposite, is unreal. This [5]\r\ntruism needs only to be tested scientifically to be found\r\ntrue, and adapted to destroy the appearance of evil to an\r\nextent beyond the power of any doctrine previously\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\n_Do you teach that you are equal with God?_ [10]\r\n\r\nA reader of my writings would not present this ques-\r\ntion. There are no such indications in the premises or\r\nconclusions of Christian Science, and such a misconcep-\r\ntion of Truth is not scientific. Man is not equal with\r\nhis Maker; that which is formed is not cause, but effect, [15]\r\nand has no power underived from its creator. It is pos-\r\nsible, and it is man’s duty, so to throw the weight of his\r\nthoughts and acts on the side of Truth, that he be ever\r\nfound in the scale _with_ his creator; not weighing\r\nequally with Him, but comprehending at every point, in [20]\r\ndivine Science, the full significance of what the apostle\r\nmeant by the declaration, “The Spirit itself beareth wit-\r\nness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and\r\nif children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with\r\nChrist.” In Science, man represents his divine Prin- [25]\r\nciple,—the Life and Love that are God,—even as the\r\nidea of sound, in tones, represents harmony; but thought\r\nhas not yet wholly attained unto the Science of being,\r\nwherein man is perfect even as the Father, his divine\r\nPrinciple, is perfect. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 47.]\r\n\r\n_How can I believe that there is no such thing as matter,_ [1]\r\n_when I weigh over two hundred pounds and carry about_\r\n_this weight daily?_\r\n\r\nBy learning that matter is but manifest mortal mind.\r\nYou entertain an adipose belief of yourself as substance; [5]\r\nwhereas, substance means more than matter: it is the\r\nglory and permanence of Spirit: it is that which is\r\nhoped for but unseen, that which the material senses\r\ncannot take in. Have you never been so preoccupied in\r\nthought when moving your body, that you did this with- [10]\r\nout consciousness of its weight? If never in your waking\r\nhours, you have been in your night-dreams; and these\r\ntend to elucidate your day-dream, or the mythical nature\r\nof matter, and the possibilities of mind when let loose\r\nfrom its own beliefs. In sleep, a sense of the body ac- [15]\r\ncompanies thought with less impediment than when\r\nawake, which is the truer sense of being. In Science,\r\nbody is the servant of Mind, not its master: Mind is\r\nsupreme. Science reverses the evidence of material\r\nsense with the spiritual sense that God, Spirit, is the only [20]\r\nsubstance; and that man, His image and likeness, is\r\nspiritual, not material. This great Truth does not de-\r\nstroy but substantiates man’s identity,—together with\r\nhis immortality and preexistence, or his spiritual co-\r\nexistence with his Maker. That which has a beginning [25]\r\nmust have an ending.\r\n\r\n_What should one conclude as to Professor Carpenter’s_\r\n_exhibitions of mesmerism?_\r\n\r\nThat largely depends upon what one accepts as either\r\nuseful or true. I have no knowledge of mesmerism, [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 48.]\r\n\r\npractically or theoretically, save as I measure its demon- [1]\r\nstrations as a false belief, and avoid all that works ill. If\r\nmesmerism has the power attributed to it by the gentle-\r\nman referred to, it should neither be taught nor practised,\r\nbut should be conscientiously condemned. One thing [5]\r\nis quite apparent; namely, that its so-called power is\r\ndespotic, and Mr. Carpenter deserves praise for his public\r\nexposure of it. If such be its power, I am opposed to it,\r\nas to every form of error,—whether of ignorance or\r\nfanaticism, prompted by money-making or malice. It [10]\r\nis enough for me to know that animal magnetism is neither\r\nof God nor Science.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged that at one of his recent lectures in Bos-\r\nton Mr. Carpenter made a man drunk on water, and\r\nthen informed his audience that he could produce the [15]\r\neffect of alcohol, or of any drug, on the human system,\r\nthrough the action of mind alone. This honest declara-\r\ntion as to the animus of animal magnetism and the pos-\r\nsible purpose to which it can be devoted, has, we trust,\r\nbeen made in season to open the eyes of the people to the [20]\r\nhidden nature of some tragic events and sudden deaths\r\nat this period.\r\n\r\n_Was ever a person made insane by studying meta-_\r\n_physics?_\r\n\r\nSuch an occurrence would be impossible, for the [25]\r\nproper study of Mind-healing would cure the insane.\r\nThat persons have gone away from the Massachusetts\r\nMetaphysical College “made insane by Mrs. Eddy’s\r\nteachings,” like a hundred other stories, is a baseless\r\nfabrication offered solely to injure her or her school. [30]\r\nThe enemy is trying to make capital out of the follow-\r\n\r\n[Page 49.]\r\n\r\ning case. A young lady entered the College class who, [1]\r\nI quickly saw, had a tendency to monomania, and re-\r\nquested her to withdraw before its close. We are cred-\r\nibly informed that, before entering the College, this\r\nyoung lady had manifested some mental unsoundness, [5]\r\nand have no doubt she could have been restored by\r\nChristian Science treatment. Her friends employed a\r\nhomœopathist, who had the skill and honor to state, as his\r\nopinion given to her friends, that “Mrs. Eddy’s teach-\r\nings had not produced insanity.” This is the only case [10]\r\nthat could be distorted into the claim of insanity ever\r\nhaving occurred in a class of Mrs. Eddy’s; while ac-\r\nknowledged and notable cases of insanity have been\r\ncured in her class.\r\n\r\n_If all that is mortal is a dream or error, is not_ [15]\r\n_our capacity for formulating a dream, real; is it not_\r\n_God-made; and if God-made, can it be wrong, sinful, or_\r\n_an error?_\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Truth leads into all truth, and enables\r\nman to discern between the real and the unreal. Enter- [20]\r\ntaining the common belief in the opposite of goodness,\r\nand that evil is as real as good, opposes the leadings of\r\nthe divine Spirit that are helping man Godward: it pre-\r\nvents a recognition of the nothingness of the dream, or\r\nbelief, that Mind is in matter, intelligence in non-intel- [25]\r\nligence, sin, and death. This belief presupposes not\r\nonly a power opposed to God, and that God is not All-\r\nin-all, as the Scriptures imply Him to be, but that the\r\ncapacity to err proceeds from God.\r\n\r\nThat God is Truth, the Scriptures aver; that Truth [30]\r\nnever created error, or such a capacity, is self-evident;\r\n\r\n[Page 50.]\r\n\r\nthat God made all that was made, is again Scriptural; [1]\r\ntherefore your answer is, that error is an illusion of\r\nmortals; that God is not its author, and it cannot be\r\nreal.\r\n\r\n_Does __“__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures__”_ [5]\r\n_explain the entire method of metaphysical healing, or is_\r\n_there a secret back of what is contained in that book, as_\r\n_some say?_\r\n\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures”\r\nis a complete textbook of Christian Science; and its [10]\r\nmetaphysical method of healing is as lucid in presenta-\r\ntion as can be possible, under the necessity to express\r\nthe metaphysical in physical terms. There is absolutely\r\nno additional secret outside of its teachings, or that gives\r\none the power to heal; but it is essential that the student [15]\r\ngain the spiritual understanding of the contents of this\r\nbook, in order to heal.\r\n\r\n_Do you believe in change of heart?_\r\n\r\nWe do believe, and understand—which is more—\r\nthat there must be a change from human affections, de- [20]\r\nsires, and aims, to the divine standard, “Be ye therefore\r\nperfect;” also, that there must be a change from the be-\r\nlief that the heart is matter and sustains life, to the\r\nunderstanding that God is our Life, that we exist in\r\nMind, live thereby, and have being. This change of [25]\r\nheart would deliver man from heart-disease, and ad-\r\nvance Christianity a hundredfold. The human affections\r\nneed to be changed from self to benevolence and love\r\nfor God and man; changed to having but _one_ God and\r\nloving Him supremely, and helping our brother man. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 51.]\r\n\r\nThis change of heart is essential to Christianity, and [1]\r\nwill have its effect physically as well as spiritually,\r\nhealing disease. Burnt offerings and drugs, God does\r\nnot require.\r\n\r\n_Is a belief of nervousness, accompanied by great mental_ [5]\r\n_depression, mesmerism?_\r\n\r\nAll mesmerism is of one of three kinds; namely, the\r\nignorant, the fraudulent, or the malicious workings of\r\nerror or mortal mind. We have not the particulars of\r\nthe case to which you may refer, and for this reason can- [10]\r\nnot answer your question professionally.\r\n\r\n_How can I govern a child metaphysically? Doesn’t the_\r\n_use of the rod teach him life in matter?_\r\n\r\nThe use of the rod is virtually a declaration to the\r\nchild’s mind that sensation belongs to matter. Motives [15]\r\ngovern acts, and Mind governs man. If you make clear\r\nto the child’s thought the right motives for action, and\r\ncause him to love them, they will lead him aright: if you\r\neducate him to love God, good, and obey the Golden\r\nRule, he will love and obey you without your having to [20]\r\nresort to corporeal punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “\"When from the lips of Truth one mighty breath\r\n    Shall, like a whirlwind, scatter in its breeze\r\n    The whole dark pile of human mockeries;\r\n    Then shall the reign of Mind commence on earth, [25]\r\n    And starting fresh, as from a second birth,\r\n    Man in the sunshine of the world’s new spring,\r\n    Shall walk transparent like some holy thing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Are both prayer and drugs necessary to heal?_\r\n\r\nThe apostle James said, “Ye ask, and receive not, [30]\r\nbecause ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your\r\n\r\n[Page 52.]\r\n\r\nlusts.” This text may refer to such as seek the material [1]\r\nto aid the spiritual, and take drugs to support God’s\r\npower to heal them. It is difficult to say how much\r\none can do for himself, whose faith is divided be-\r\ntween catnip and Christ; but not so difficult to know [5]\r\nthat if he were to serve one master, he could do vastly\r\nmore. Whosoever understands the power of Spirit, has\r\nno doubt of God’s power,—even the might of Truth,—\r\nto heal, through divine Science, beyond all human means\r\nand methods. [10]\r\n\r\n_What do you think of marriage?_\r\n\r\nThat it is often convenient, sometimes pleasant, and\r\noccasionally a love affair. Marriage is susceptible of\r\nmany definitions. It sometimes presents the most\r\nwretched condition of human existence. To be normal, [15]\r\nit must be a union of the affections that tends to lift\r\nmortals higher.\r\n\r\n_If this life is a dream not dispelled, but only changed,_\r\n_by death,—if one gets tired of it, why not commit_\r\n_suicide?_ [20]\r\n\r\nMan’s existence is a problem to be wrought in divine\r\nScience. What progress would a student of science\r\nmake, if, when tired of mathematics or failing to dem-\r\nonstrate one rule readily, he should attempt to work\r\nout a rule farther on and more difficult—and this, [25]\r\nbecause the first rule was not easily demonstrated? In\r\nthat case he would be obliged to turn back and work\r\nout the previous example, before solving the advanced\r\nproblem. Mortals have the sum of being to work out,\r\nand up, to its spiritual standpoint. They must work [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 53.]\r\n\r\nout of this dream or false claim of sensation and life [1]\r\nin matter, and up to the spiritual realities of existence,\r\nbefore this false claim can be wholly dispelled. Com-\r\nmitting suicide to dodge the question is not working\r\nit out. The error of supposed life and intelligence in [5]\r\nmatter, is dissolved only as we master error with Truth.\r\nNot through sin or suicide, but by _overcoming_ tempta-\r\ntion and sin, shall we escape the weariness and wicked-\r\nness of mortal existence, and gain heaven, the harmony\r\nof being. [10]\r\n\r\n_Do you sometimes find it advisable to use medicine to_\r\n_assist in producing a cure, when it is difficult to start the_\r\n_patient’s recovery?_\r\n\r\nYou only weaken your power to heal through Mind,\r\nby any compromise with matter; which is virtually ac- [15]\r\nknowledging that under difficulties the former is not equal\r\nto the latter. He that resorts to physics, seeks what is\r\nbelow instead of above the standard of metaphysics;\r\nshowing his ignorance of the meaning of the term and\r\nof Christian Science. [20]\r\n\r\n_If Christian Science is the same as Jesus taught, why is_\r\n_it not more simple, so that all can readily understand it?_\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Jesus were simple; and yet he found\r\nit difficult to make the rulers understand, because of\r\ntheir great lack of spirituality. Christian Science is [25]\r\nsimple, and readily understood by the children; only\r\nthe thought educated away from it finds it abstract or\r\ndifficult to perceive. Its seeming abstraction is the\r\nmystery of godliness; and godliness is simple to the\r\ngodly; but to the unspiritual, the ungodly, it is dark [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 54.]\r\n\r\nand difficult. The carnal mind cannot discern spiritual [1]\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n_Has Mrs. Eddy lost her power to heal?_\r\n\r\nHas the sun forgotten to shine, and the planets to\r\nrevolve around it? Who is it that discovered, dem- [5]\r\nonstrated, and teaches Christian Science? That one,\r\nwhoever it be, does understand something of what can-\r\nnot be lost. Thousands in the field of metaphysical\r\nhealing, whose lives are worthy testimonials, are her\r\nstudents, and they bear witness to this fact. Instead [10]\r\nof losing her power to heal, she is demonstrating the\r\npower of Christian Science over all obstacles that envy\r\nand malice would fling in her path. The reading of her\r\nbook, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,”\r\nis curing hundreds at this very time; and the sick, un- [15]\r\nasked, are testifying thereto.\r\n\r\n_Must I study your Science in order to keep well all my_\r\n_life? I was healed of a chronic trouble after one month’s_\r\n_treatment by one of your students._\r\n\r\nWhen once you are healed by Science, there is no rea- [20]\r\nson why you should be liable to a return of the disease\r\nthat you were healed of. But not to be subject again to\r\nany disease whatsoever, would require an understanding\r\nof the Science by which you were healed.\r\n\r\n_Because none of your students have been able to perform_ [25]\r\n_as great miracles in healing as Jesus and his disciples did,_\r\n_does it not suggest the possibility that they do not heal on_\r\n_the same basis?_\r\n\r\nYou would not ask the pupil in simple equations to\r\nsolve a problem involving logarithms; and then, because [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 55.]\r\n\r\nhe failed to get the right answer, condemn the pupil [1]\r\nand the science of numbers. The simplest problem\r\nin Christian Science is healing the sick, and the least\r\nunderstanding and demonstration thereof prove all its\r\npossibilities. The ability to demonstrate to the extent [5]\r\nthat Jesus did, will come when the student possesses as\r\nmuch of the divine Spirit as he shared, and utilizes its\r\npower to overcome sin.\r\n\r\nOpposite to good, is the universal claim of evil that\r\nseeks the proportions of good. There may be those [10]\r\nwho, having learned the power of the unspoken thought,\r\nuse it to harm rather than to heal, and who are using\r\nthat power against Christian Scientists. This giant sin\r\nis the sin against the Holy Ghost spoken of in Matt.\r\nxii. 31, 32. [15]\r\n\r\n_Is Christian Science based on the facts of both Spirit_\r\n_and matter?_\r\n\r\nChristian Science is based on the facts of Spirit and\r\nits forms and representations, but these facts are the\r\ndirect antipodes of the so-called facts of matter; and [20]\r\nthe eternal verities of Spirit assert themselves over their\r\nopposite, or matter, in the final destruction of all that\r\nis unlike Spirit.\r\n\r\nMan knows that he can have one God only, when\r\nhe regards God as the only Mind, Life, and substance. [25]\r\nIf God is Spirit, as the Scriptures declare, and All-in-\r\nall, matter is mythology, and its laws are mortal\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nIf Mind is in matter and beneath a skull bone, it is\r\nin something unlike Him; hence it is either a godless and [30]\r\nmaterial Mind, or it is God in matter,—which are theo-\r\n\r\n[Page 56.]\r\n\r\nries of agnosticism and pantheism, the very antipodes [1]\r\nof Christian Science\r\n\r\n_What is organic life?_\r\n\r\nLife is inorganic, infinite Spirit; if Life, or Spirit,\r\nwere organic, disorganization would destroy Spirit and [5]\r\nannihilate man.\r\n\r\nIf Mind is not substance, form, and tangibility, God\r\nis substanceless; for the substance of Spirit is divine\r\nMind. Life is God, the only creator, and Life is im-\r\nmortal Mind, not matter. [10]\r\n\r\nEvery indication of matter’s constituting life is mortal,\r\nthe direct opposite of immortal Life, and infringes the\r\nrights of Spirit. Then, to conclude that Spirit consti-\r\ntutes or ever has constituted laws to that effect, is a mor-\r\ntal error, a human conception opposed to the divine [15]\r\ngovernment. Mind and matter mingling in perpetual\r\nwarfare is a kingdom divided against itself, that shall be\r\nbrought to desolation. The final destruction of this\r\nfalse belief in matter will appear at the full revelation\r\nof Spirit,—one God, and the brotherhood of man. [20]\r\nOrganic life is an error of statement that Truth destroys.\r\nThe Science of Life needs only to be understood; its dem-\r\nonstration proves the correctness of my statements, and\r\nbrings blessings infinite.\r\n\r\n_Why did God command, __“__Be fruitful, and multiply,_ [25]\r\n_and replenish the earth,__”__ if all minds (men) have existed_\r\n_from the beginning, and have had successive stages of_\r\n_existence to the present time?_\r\n\r\nYour question implies that Spirit, which first spirit-\r\nually created the universe, including man, created man [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 57.]\r\n\r\nover again materially; and, by the aid of mankind, all [1]\r\nwas later made which _He had made_. If the first record\r\nis true, what evidence have you—apart from the evi-\r\ndence of that which you admit cannot discern spiritual\r\nthings—of any other creation? The creative “Us” [5]\r\nmade all, and Mind was the creator. Man originated\r\nnot from dust, materially, but from Spirit, spiritually.\r\nThis work had been done; the true creation was finished,\r\nand its spiritual Science is alluded to in the first chapter\r\nof Genesis. [10]\r\n\r\nJesus said of error, “That thou doest, do quickly.”\r\nBy the law of opposites, after the truth of man had been\r\ndemonstrated, the postulate of error must appear. That\r\nthis addendum was untrue, is seen when Truth, God,\r\ndenounced it, and said: “I will greatly multiply thy [15]\r\nsorrow.” “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt\r\nsurely die.” The opposite error said, “I am true,” and\r\ndeclared, “God doth know ... that your eyes shall be\r\nopened, and ye shall be as gods,” creators. This was false;\r\nand the Lord God never said it. This history of a falsity [20]\r\nmust be told in the name of Truth, or it would have no\r\nseeming. The Science of creation is the universe with man\r\ncreated spiritually. The false sense and error of creation\r\nis the sense of man and the universe created materially.\r\n\r\n_Why does the record make man a creation of the sixth_ [25]\r\n_and last day, if he was coexistent with God?_\r\n\r\nIn its genesis, the Science of creation is stated in mathe-\r\nmatical order, beginning with the lowest form and ascend-\r\ning the scale of being up to man. But all that really is,\r\nalways was and forever is; for it existed in and of the Mind [30]\r\nthat is God, wherein man is foremost.\r\n\r\n[Page 58.]\r\n\r\n_If one has died of consumption, and he has no remem-_ [1]\r\n_brance of that disease or dream, does that disease have any_\r\n_more power over him?_\r\n\r\nWaking from a dream, one learns its _unreality_; then\r\nit has no power over one. Waking from the dream of [5]\r\ndeath, proves to him who thought he died that it was a\r\ndream, and that he did not die; then he learns that con-\r\nsumption did not kill him. When the belief in the power\r\nof disease is destroyed, disease cannot return.\r\n\r\n_How does Mrs. Eddy know that she has read and studied_ [10]\r\n_correctly, if one must deny the evidences of the senses?_\r\n_She had to use her eyes to read._\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Having eyes, see ye not?” I read the in-\r\nspired page through a higher than mortal sense. As\r\nmatter, the eye cannot see; and as mortal mind, it is a [15]\r\nbelief that sees. I may read the Scriptures through a\r\nbelief of eyesight; but I must spiritually understand\r\nthem to interpret their Science.\r\n\r\n_Does the theology of Christian Science aid its heal-_\r\n_ing?_ [20]\r\n\r\nWithout its theology there is no mental science, no\r\norder that proceeds from God. All Science is divine,\r\nnot human, in origin and demonstration. If God does\r\nnot govern the action of man, it is inharmonious: if He\r\ndoes govern it, the action is Science. Take away the [25]\r\ntheology of mental healing and you take away its science,\r\nleaving it a human “mind-cure,” nothing more nor less,\r\n—even one human mind governing another; by which,\r\nif you agree that God is Mind, you admit that there is\r\n\r\n[Page 59.]\r\n\r\nmore than one government and God. Having no true [1]\r\nsense of the healing theology of Mind, you can neither\r\nunderstand nor demonstrate its Science, and will prac-\r\ntise your belief of it in the name of Truth. This is the\r\nmortal “mind-cure” that produces the effect of mes- [5]\r\nmerism. It is using the power of human will, instead\r\nof the divine power understood, as in Christian Science;\r\nand without this Science there had better be no “mind-\r\ncure,”—in which the last state of patients is worse than\r\nthe first. [10]\r\n\r\n_Is it wrong to pray for the recovery of the sick?_\r\n\r\nNot if we pray Scripturally, with the understanding\r\nthat God _has_ given all things to those who love Him;\r\nbut pleading with infinite Love to love us, or to restore\r\nhealth and harmony, and then to admit that it has been [15]\r\nlost under His government, is the prayer of doubt and\r\nmortal belief that is unavailing in divine Science.\r\n\r\n_Is not all argument mind over mind?_\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures refer to God as saying, “Come now, and\r\nlet us reason together.” There is but one right Mind, and [20]\r\nthat one should and does govern man. Any copartnership\r\nwith that Mind is impossible; and the only benefit in\r\nspeaking often one to another, arises from the success that\r\none individual has with another in leading his thoughts\r\naway from the human mind or body, and guiding them [25]\r\nwith Truth. That individual is the best healer who as-\r\nserts himself the least, and thus becomes a transparency\r\nfor the divine Mind, who is the only physician; the divine\r\nMind is the scientific healer.\r\n\r\n[Page 60.]\r\n\r\n_How can you believe there is no sin, and that God does_ [1]\r\n_not recognize any, when He sent His Son to save from_\r\n_sin, and the Bible is addressed to sinners? How can you_\r\n_believe there is no sickness, when Jesus came healing the_\r\n_sick? [5]_\r\n\r\nTo regard sin, disease, and death with less deference,\r\nand only as the woeful unrealities of being, is the only\r\nway to destroy them; Christian Science is proving this by\r\nhealing cases of disease and sin after all other means have\r\nfailed. The Nazarene Prophet could make the unreality [10]\r\nof both apparent in a moment.\r\n\r\n_Does it not limit the power of Mind to deny the possi-_\r\n_bility of communion with departed friends—dead only in_\r\n_belief?_\r\n\r\nDoes it limit the power of Mind to say that addition [15]\r\nis not subtraction in mathematics? The Science of Mind\r\nreveals the impossibility of two individual sleepers, in\r\ndifferent phases of thought, communicating, even if touch-\r\ning each other corporeally; or for one who sleeps to\r\ncommunicate with another who is awake. Mind’s possi- [20]\r\nbilities are not lessened by being confined and conformed\r\nto the Science of being.\r\n\r\n_If mortal mind and body are myths, what is the con-_\r\n_nection between them and real identity, and why are there_\r\n_as many identities as mortal bodies?_ [25]\r\n\r\nEvil in the beginning claimed the power, wisdom, and\r\nutility of good; and every creation or idea of Spirit has\r\nits counterfeit in some matter belief. Every material be-\r\nlief hints the existence of spiritual reality; and if mortals\r\nare instructed in spiritual things, it will be seen that ma- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 61.]\r\n\r\nterial belief, in all its manifestations, reversed, will be [1]\r\nfound the type and representative of verities priceless,\r\neternal, and just at hand.\r\n\r\nThe education of the future will be instruction, in spir-\r\nitual Science, against the material symbolic counterfeit [5]\r\nsciences. All the knowledge and vain strivings of mortal\r\nmind, that lead to death,—even when aping the wisdom\r\nand magnitude of immortal Mind,—will be swallowed\r\nup by the reality and omnipotence of Truth over error,\r\nand of Life over death. [10]\r\n\r\n“_Dear Mrs. Eddy_:—In the October _Journal_ I read\r\nthe following: “But the real man, who was created in the\r\nimage of God, does not commit sin.” _What then does sin?_\r\n_What commits theft? Or who does murder?_ For instance,\r\nthe man is held responsible for the crime; for I went once [15]\r\nto a place where a man was said to be “hanged for mur-\r\nder”—and certainly I saw him, or his effigy, dangling\r\nat the end of a rope. This “man” was held responsible\r\nfor the ‘sin.’ ”\r\n\r\n_What sins?_ [20]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Word, man is the image and likeness\r\nof God. Does God’s essential likeness sin, or dangle at\r\nthe end of a rope? If not, what does? A culprit, a sinner,\r\n—anything but a man! Then, what is a sinner? A\r\nmortal; but man is _immortal_. [25]\r\n\r\nAgain: mortals are the embodiments (or bodies, if\r\nyou please) of error, not of Truth; of sickness, sin, and\r\ndeath. Naming these His embodiment, can neither make\r\nthem so nor overthrow the logic that man is God’s like-\r\nness. Mortals seem very material; man in the likeness [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 62.]\r\n\r\nof Spirit is spiritual. Holding the _right_ idea of man in my [1]\r\nmind, I can improve my own, and other people’s individ-\r\nuality, health, and morals; whereas, the opposite image\r\nof man, a sinner, kept constantly in mind, can no more\r\nimprove health or morals, than holding in thought the [5]\r\nform of a boa-constrictor can aid an artist in painting a\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nMan is seen only in the true likeness of his Maker.\r\nBelieving a lie veils the truth from our vision; even as\r\nin mathematics, in summing up positive and negative [10]\r\nquantities, the negative quantity offsets an equal positive\r\nquantity, making the aggregate positive, or true quantity,\r\nby that much, less available.\r\n\r\n_Why do Christian Scientists hold that their theology is_\r\n_essential to heal the sick, when the mind-cure claims to heal_ [15]\r\n_without it?_\r\n\r\nThe theology of Christian Science is Truth; opposed\r\nto which is the error of sickness, sin, and death, that\r\nTruth destroys.\r\n\r\nA “mind-cure” is a matter-cure. An adherent to this [20]\r\nmethod honestly acknowledges this fact in her work\r\nentitled “Mind-cure on a Material Basis.” In that\r\nwork the author grapples with Christian Science, attempts\r\nto solve its divine Principle by the rule of human mind,\r\nfails, and ends in a parody on this Science which is amus- [25]\r\ning to astute readers,—especially when she tells them\r\nthat she is practising this Science.\r\n\r\nThe theology of Christian Science is based on the action\r\nof the divine Mind over the human mind and body;\r\nwhereas, “mind-cure” rests on the notion that the human [30]\r\nmind can cure its own disease, or that which it causes,\r\n\r\n[Page 63.]\r\n\r\nand the _sickness of matter_,—which is infidel in the one [1]\r\ncase, and anomalous in the other. It was said of old by\r\nTruth-traducers, that Jesus healed through Beelzebub;\r\nbut the claim that one erring mind cures another one was\r\nat first gotten up to hinder his benign influence and to hide [5]\r\nhis divine power.\r\n\r\nOur Master understood that Life, Truth, Love are the\r\ntriune Principle of all pure theology; also, that this divine\r\ntrinity is one infinite remedy for the opposite triad, sick-\r\nness, sin, and death. [10]\r\n\r\n_If there is no sin, why did Jesus come to save sinners?_\r\n\r\nIf there is no reality in sickness, why does a Chris-\r\ntian Scientist go to the bedside and address himself to\r\nthe healing of disease, on the basis of its unreality?\r\nJesus came to seek and to save such as believe in the [15]\r\nreality of the unreal; to save them from _this false belief_;\r\nthat they might lay hold of eternal Life, the great reality\r\nthat concerns man, and understand the final fact,—that\r\nGod is omnipotent and omnipresent; yea, “that the Lord\r\nHe is God; there is none else beside Him,” as the Scrip- [20]\r\ntures declare.\r\n\r\n_If Christ was God, why did Jesus cry out, __“__My God,_\r\n_why hast Thou forsaken me?__”_\r\n\r\nEven as the struggling heart, reaching toward a higher\r\ngoal, appeals to its hope and faith, Why failest thou [25]\r\nme? Jesus as the son of man was human: Christ as\r\nthe Son of God was divine. This divinity was reaching\r\nhumanity through the crucifixion of the human,—that\r\nmomentous demonstration of God, in which Spirit proved\r\nits supremacy over matter. Jesus assumed for mortals the [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 64.]\r\n\r\nweakness of flesh, that Spirit might be found “All-in-all.” [1]\r\nHence, the human cry which voiced that struggle;\r\nthence, the way he made for mortals’ escape. Our\r\nMaster bore the cross to show his power over death;\r\nthen relinquished his earth-task of teaching and dem- [5]\r\nonstrating the nothingness of sickness, sin, and death,\r\nand rose to his native estate, man’s indestructible eternal\r\nlife in God.\r\n\r\n_What can prospective students of the College take for_\r\n_preliminary studies? Do you regard the study of litera-_ [10]\r\n_ture and languages as objectionable?_\r\n\r\nPersons contemplating a course at the Massachusetts\r\nMetaphysical College, can prepare for it through no\r\nbooks except the Bible, and “Science and Health with\r\nKey to the Scriptures.” Man-made theories are nar- [15]\r\nrow, else extravagant, and are always materialistic.\r\nThe ethics which guide thought spiritually must bene-\r\nfit every one; for the only philosophy and religion that\r\nafford instruction are those which deal with facts and\r\nresist speculative opinions and fables. [20]\r\n\r\nWorks on science are profitable; for science is not\r\nhuman. It is spiritual, and not material. Literature\r\nand languages, to a limited extent, are aids to a student\r\nof the Bible and of Christian Science.\r\n\r\n_Is it possible to know why we are put into this condition_ [25]\r\n_of mortality?_\r\n\r\nIt is quite as possible to know wherefore man is thus\r\nconditioned, as to be certain that he _is_ in a state of\r\nmortality. The only evidence of the existence of a mor-\r\ntal man, or of a material state and universe, is gathered [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 65.]\r\n\r\nfrom the five personal senses. This delusive evidence, [1]\r\nScience has dethroned by repeated proofs of its falsity.\r\n\r\nWe have no more proof of human discord,—sin,\r\nsickness, disease, or death,—than we have that the\r\nearth’s surface is flat, and her motions imaginary. If [5]\r\nman’s _ipse dixit_ as to the stellar system is correct, this\r\nis because Science is true, and the evidence of the senses\r\nis false. Then why not submit to the affirmations of\r\nScience concerning the greater subject of human weal\r\nand woe? Every question between Truth and error, [10]\r\nScience must and will decide. Left to the decision of\r\nScience, your query concerns a negative which the posi-\r\ntive Truth destroys; for God’s universe and man are\r\nimmortal. We must not consider the false side of exist-\r\nence in order to gain the true solution of Life and its [15]\r\ngreat realities.\r\n\r\n_Have you changed your instructions as to the right way_\r\n_of treating disease?_\r\n\r\nI have not; and this important fact must be, and al-\r\nready is, apprehended by those who understand my in- [20]\r\nstructions on this question. Christian Science demands\r\nboth law and gospel, in order to demonstrate healing,\r\nand I have taught them both in its demonstration, and\r\nwith signs following. They are a unit in restoring the\r\nequipoise of mind and body, and balancing man’s ac- [25]\r\ncount with his Maker. The sequence proves that strict\r\nadherence to one is inadequate to compensate for the\r\nabsence of the other, since both constitute the divine law\r\nof healing.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish religion demands that “whoso sheddeth [30]\r\nman’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.” But this\r\n\r\n[Page 66.]\r\n\r\nlaw is not infallible in wisdom; and obedience thereto [1]\r\nmay be found faulty, since false testimony or mistaken\r\nevidence may cause the innocent to suffer for the guilty.\r\nHence the gospel that fulfils the law in righteousness,\r\nthe genius whereof is displayed in the surprising wisdom [5]\r\nof these words of the New Testament: “Whatsoever\r\na man soweth, that shall he also reap.” No possible\r\ninjustice lurks in this mandate, and no human mis-\r\njudgment can pervert it; for the offender alone suffers,\r\nand always according to divine decree. This sacred, [10]\r\nsolid precept is verified in all directions in Mind-\r\nhealing, and is supported in the Scripture by parallel\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThe law and gospel of Truth and Love teach, through\r\ndivine Science, that sin is identical with suffering, and [15]\r\nthat suffering is the lighter affliction. To reach the sum-\r\nmit of Science, whence to discern God’s perfect ways\r\nand means, the material sense must be controlled by\r\nthe higher spiritual sense, and Truth be enthroned,\r\nwhile “we look not at the things which are seen, but at [20]\r\nthe things which are not seen.”\r\n\r\nCynical critics misjudge my meaning as to the sci-\r\nentific treatment of the sick. Disease that is superin-\r\nduced by sin is not healed like the more physical\r\nailment. The beginner in sin-healing must know this, or [25]\r\nhe never can reach the Science of Mind-healing, and\r\nso “overcome evil with good.” Error in premise is met\r\nwith error in practice; yea, it is “the blind leading the\r\nblind.” Ignorance of the cause of disease can neither\r\nremove that cause nor its effect. [30]\r\n\r\nI endeavor to accommodate my instructions to the\r\npresent capability of the learner, and to support the\r\n\r\n[Page 67.]\r\n\r\nliberated thought until its altitude reaches beyond the [1]\r\nmere alphabet of Mind-healing. Above physical wants,\r\nlie the higher claims of the law and gospel of healing.\r\nFirst is the law, which saith:—\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not commit adultery;” in other words, [5]\r\nthou shalt not adulterate Life, Truth, or Love,—men-\r\ntally, morally, or physically. “Thou shalt not steal;”\r\nthat is, thou shalt not rob man of money, which is but\r\ntrash, compared with his rights of mind and character.\r\n“Thou shalt not kill;” that is, thou shalt not strike at the [10]\r\neternal sense of Life with a malicious aim, but shalt\r\nknow that by doing thus thine own sense of Life shall be\r\nforfeited. “Thou shalt not bear false witness;” that is,\r\nthou shalt not utter a lie, either mentally or audibly, nor\r\ncause it to be thought. Obedience to these command- [15]\r\nments is indispensable to health, happiness, and length\r\nof days.\r\n\r\nThe gospel of healing demonstrates the law of Love.\r\nJustice uncovers sin of every sort; and mercy demands\r\nthat if you see the danger menacing others, you shall, [20]\r\n_Deo volente_, inform them thereof. Only thus is the right\r\npractice of Mind-healing achieved, and the wrong prac-\r\ntice discerned, disarmed, and destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Do you believe in translation?_\r\n\r\nIf your question refers to language, whereby one ex- [25]\r\npresses the sense of words in one language by equiva-\r\nlent words in another, I do. If you refer to the removal\r\nof a person to heaven, without his subjection to death,\r\nI modify my affirmative answer. I believe in this\r\nremoval being possible after all the footsteps requisite [30]\r\nhave been taken up to the very throne, up to the\r\n\r\n[Page 68.]\r\n\r\nspiritual sense and fact of divine substance, intelligence, [1]\r\nLife, and Love. This translation is not the work of mo-\r\nments; it requires both time and eternity. It means more\r\nthan mere disappearance to the human sense; it must\r\ninclude also man’s changed appearance and diviner form [5]\r\nvisible to those beholding him here.\r\n\r\n_The Rev. —— said in a sermon: A true Christian_\r\n_would protest against metaphysical healing being called_\r\n_Christian Science. He also maintained that pain and_\r\n_disease are not illusions but realities; and that it is not_ [10]\r\n_Christian to believe they are illusions. Is this so?_\r\n\r\nIt is unchristian to believe that pain and sickness are\r\nanything _but_ illusions. My proof of this is, that the\r\npenalty for believing in their reality is the very pain and\r\ndisease. Jesus cast out a devil, and the dumb spake; [15]\r\nhence it is right to know that the works of Satan are the\r\nillusion and error which Truth casts out.\r\n\r\nDoes the gentleman above mentioned know the\r\nmeaning of divine metaphysics, or of metaphysical\r\ntheology? [20]\r\n\r\nAccording to Webster, metaphysics is defined thus:\r\n“The science of the conceptions and relations which are\r\nnecessary to thought and knowledge; science of the\r\nmind.” Worcester defines it as “the philosophy of mind,\r\nas distinguished from that of matter; a science of which [25]\r\nthe object is to explain the principles and causes of\r\nall things existing,” Brande calls metaphysics “the\r\nscience which regards the ultimate grounds of being, as\r\ndistinguished from its phenomenal modifications.” “A\r\nspeculative science, which soars beyond the bounds of [30]\r\nexperience,” is a further definition.\r\n\r\n[Page 69.]\r\n\r\nDivine metaphysics is that which treats of the exist- [1]\r\nence of God, His essence, relations, and attributes. A\r\nsneer at metaphysics is a scoff at Deity; at His goodness,\r\nmercy, and might.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is the unfolding of true metaphysics; [5]\r\nthat is, of Mind, or God, and His attributes. Science rests\r\non Principle and demonstration. The Principle of Chris-\r\ntian Science is divine. Its rule is, that man shall utilize\r\nthe divine power.\r\n\r\nIn Genesis i. 26, we read: “Let us make man in [10]\r\nour image, after our likeness: and let them have\r\ndominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of\r\nthe air.”\r\n\r\nI was once called to visit a sick man to whom the\r\nregular physicians had given three doses of Croton [15]\r\noil, and then had left him to die. Upon my arrival I\r\nfound him barely alive, and in terrible agony. In one\r\nhour he was well, and the next day he attended to his\r\nbusiness. I removed the stoppage, healed him of en-\r\nteritis, and neutralized the bad effects of the poison- [20]\r\nous oil. His physicians had failed even to move his\r\nbowels,—though the wonder was, with the means\r\nused in their effort to accomplish this result, that\r\nthey had not quite killed him. According to their\r\ndiagnosis, the exciting cause of the inflammation and [25]\r\nstoppage was—eating smoked herring. The man is\r\nliving yet; and I will send his address to any one\r\nwho may wish to apply to him for information about\r\nhis case.\r\n\r\nNow comes the question: Had that sick man dominion [30]\r\nover the fish in his stomach?\r\n\r\nHis want of control over “the fish of the sea” must\r\n\r\n[Page 70.]\r\n\r\nhave been an illusion, or else the Scriptures misstate [1]\r\nman’s power. That the Bible is true I believe, not\r\nonly, but I _demonstrated_ its truth when I exercised\r\nmy power over the fish, cast out the sick man’s illu-\r\nsion, and healed him. Thus it was shown that the [5]\r\nhealing action of Mind upon the body has its only ex-\r\nplanation in divine metaphysics. As a man “thinketh\r\nin his heart, so is he.” When the mortal thought, or be-\r\nlief, was removed, the man was well.\r\n\r\n_What did Jesus mean when he said to the dying thief,_ [10]\r\n_“__To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise__”__?_\r\n\r\nParadisaical rest from physical agony would come to\r\nthe criminal, if the dream of dying should startle him\r\nfrom the dream of suffering. The paradise of Spirit\r\nwould come to Jesus, in a spiritual sense of Life and [15]\r\npower. Christ Jesus lived and reappeared. He was too\r\ngood to die; for goodness is immortal. The thief was\r\nnot equal to the demands of the hour; but sin was de-\r\nstroying itself, and had already begun to die,—as\r\nthe poor thief’s prayer for help indicated. The dy- [20]\r\ning malefactor and our Lord were inevitably sepa-\r\nrated through Mind. The thief’s body, as matter,\r\nmust dissolve into its native nothingness; whereas the\r\nbody of the holy Spirit of Jesus was eternal. That\r\nday the thief would be with Jesus only in a finite [25]\r\nand material sense of relief; while our Lord would\r\nsoon be rising to the supremacy of Spirit, working\r\nout, even in the silent tomb, those wonderful demon-\r\nstrations of divine power, in which none could equal his\r\nglory. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 71.]\r\n\r\n_Is it right for me to treat others, when I am not entirely_ [1]\r\n_well myself?_\r\n\r\nThe late John B. Gough is said to have suffered from\r\nan appetite for alcoholic drink until his death; yet he\r\nsaved many a drunkard from this fatal appetite. Paul [5]\r\nhad a thorn in the flesh: one writer thinks that he was\r\ntroubled with rheumatism, and another that he had sore\r\neyes; but this is certain, that he healed others who were\r\nsick. It is unquestionably right to do right; and heal-\r\ning the sick is a very right thing to do. [10]\r\n\r\n_Does Christian Science set aside the law of transmission,_\r\n_prenatal desires, and good or bad influences on the unborn_\r\n_child?_\r\n\r\nScience never averts law, but supports it. All actual\r\ncausation must interpret omnipotence, the all-knowing [15]\r\nMind. Law brings out Truth, not error; unfolds divine\r\nPrinciple,—but neither human hypothesis nor matter.\r\nErrors are based on a mortal or material formation; they\r\nare suppositional modes, not the factors of divine presence\r\nand power. [20]\r\n\r\nWhatever is humanly conceived is a departure from\r\ndivine law; hence its mythical origin and certain end.\r\nAccording to the Scriptures,—St. Paul declares astutely,\r\n“For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all\r\nthings,”—man is incapable of originating; nothing can [25]\r\nbe formed apart from God, good, the all-knowing Mind.\r\nWhat seems to be of human origin is the counterfeit\r\nof the divine,—even human concepts, mortal shadows\r\nflitting across the dial of time.\r\n\r\nWhatever is real is right and eternal; hence the im- [30]\r\nmutable and just law of Science, that God is good only,\r\n\r\n[Page 72.]\r\n\r\nand can transmit to man and the universe nothing evil, [1]\r\nor unlike Himself. For the innocent babe to be born a\r\nlifelong sufferer because of his parents’ mistakes or sins,\r\nwere sore injustice. Science sets aside man as a creator,\r\nand unfolds the eternal harmonies of the only living and [5]\r\ntrue origin, God.\r\n\r\nAccording to the beliefs of the flesh, both good and\r\nbad traits of the parents are transmitted to their help-\r\nless offspring, and God is supposed to impart to man\r\nthis fatal power. It is cause for rejoicing that this belief [10]\r\nis as false as it is remorseless. The immutable Word\r\nsaith, through the prophet Ezekiel, “What mean ye, that\r\nye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,\r\nThe fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s\r\nteeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, [15]\r\nye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb\r\nin Israel.”\r\n\r\n_Are material things real when they are harmonious, and_\r\n_do they disappear only to the natural sense? Does this_\r\n_Scripture, __“__Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have_ [20]\r\n_need of all these things__”__ imply that Spirit takes note of_\r\n_matter?_\r\n\r\nThe Science of Mind, as well as the material unii\r\nverse, shows that nothing which is material is in\r\nperpetual harmony. Matter is manifest mortal mind, [35]\r\nand it exists only to material sense. Real sensation\r\nis not material; it is, and must be, mental: and Mind\r\nis not mortal, it is immortal. Being is God, infinite\r\nSpirit; therefore it cannot cognize aught material, or\r\noutside of infinity. [30]\r\n\r\nThe Scriptural passage quoted affords no evidence of\r\n\r\n[Page 73.]\r\n\r\nthe reality of matter, or that God is conscious of it. [1]\r\nThe so-called material body is said to suffer, but this\r\nsupposition is proven erroneous when Mind casts out\r\nthe suffering. The Scripture saith, “Whom the Lord\r\nloveth He chasteneth;” and again, “He doth not [5]\r\nafflict willingly.” Interpreted materially, these pas-\r\nsages conflict; they mingle the testimony of immor-\r\ntal Science with mortal sense; but once discern their\r\nspiritual meaning, and it separates the false sense from\r\nthe true, and establishes the reality of what is spiritual, [10]\r\nand the unreality of materiality.\r\n\r\nLaw is never material: it is always mental and moral,\r\nand a commandment to the wise. The foolish disobey\r\nmoral law, and are punished. Human wisdom therefore\r\ncan get no farther than to say, He knoweth that we have [15]\r\nneed of experience. Belief fulfils the conditions of a be-\r\nlief, and these conditions destroy the belief. Hence the\r\nverdict of experience: We have need of _these_ things; we\r\nhave need to know that the so-called pleasures and pains\r\nof matter—yea, that all subjective states of false sensa- [20]\r\ntion—are _unreal_.\r\n\r\n_“__And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you,_\r\n_That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when_\r\n_the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory,_\r\n_ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the_ [25]\r\n_twelve tribes of Israel.__”_ (Matt. xix. 28.) _What is meant_\r\n_by regeneration?_\r\n\r\nIt is the appearing of divine law to human under-\r\nstanding; the spiritualization that comes from spiritual\r\nsense in contradistinction to the testimony of the so- [30]\r\ncalled material senses. The phenomena of Spirit in\r\n\r\n[Page 74.]\r\n\r\nChristian Science, and the divine correspondence of [1]\r\nnoumenon and phenomenon understood, are here signi-\r\nfied. This new-born sense subdues not only the false\r\nsense of generation, but the human will, and the un-\r\nnatural enmity of mortal man toward God. It quickly [5]\r\nimparts a new apprehension of the true basis of being,\r\nand the spiritual foundation for the affections which en-\r\nthrone the Son of man in the glory of his Father; and\r\njudges, through the stern mandate of Science, all human\r\nsystems of etiology and teleology. [10]\r\n\r\n_If God does not recognize matter, how did Jesus, who was_\r\n_“__the way, the truth, and the life,__”__ cognize it?_\r\n\r\nChrist Jesus’ sense of matter was the opposite of that\r\nwhich mortals entertain: his nativity was a spiritual and\r\nimmortal sense of the ideal world. His earthly mission [15]\r\nwas to translate substance into its original meaning,\r\nMind. He walked upon the waves; he turned the water\r\ninto wine; he healed the sick and the sinner; he raised\r\nthe dead, and rolled away the stone from the door of his\r\nown tomb. His demonstration of Spirit virtually van- [20]\r\nquished matter and its supposed laws. Walking the\r\nwave, he proved the fallacy of the theory that matter is\r\nsubstance; healing through Mind, he removed any sup-\r\nposition that matter is intelligent, or can recognize or\r\nexpress pain and pleasure. His triumph over the grave [25]\r\nwas an everlasting victory for Life; it demonstrated the\r\nlifelessness of matter, and the power and permanence\r\nof Spirit. He met and conquered the resistance of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf you will admit, with me, that matter is neither [30]\r\nsubstance, intelligence, nor Life, you may have all that\r\n\r\n[Page 75.]\r\n\r\nis left of it; and you will have touched the hem of the [1]\r\ngarment of Jesus’ idea of matter, Christ was “the way;”\r\nsince Life and Truth were the way that gave us, through\r\na human person, a spiritual revelation of man’s possible\r\nearthly development. [5]\r\n\r\n_Why do you insist that there is but one Soul, and that_\r\n_Soul is not in the body?_\r\n\r\n_First:_ I urge this fundamental fact and grand verity\r\nof Christian Science, because it includes a rule that must\r\nbe understood, or it is impossible to demonstrate the Sci- [10]\r\nence. Soul is a synonym of Spirit, and God is Spirit.\r\nThere is but one God, and the infinite is not within the\r\nfinite; hence Soul is one, and is God; and God is not in\r\nmatter or the mortal body.\r\n\r\n_Second:_ Because Soul is a term for Deity, and this [15]\r\nterm should seldom be employed except where the word\r\n_God_ can be used and make complete sense. The word\r\n_Soul_ may sometimes be used metaphorically; but if this\r\nterm is warped to signify human quality, a substitution\r\nof _sense_ for _soul_ clears the meaning, and assists one to [20]\r\nunderstand Christian Science. Mary’s exclamation,\r\n“\"My _soul_ doth magnify the Lord,” is rendered in Sci-\r\nence, “My _spiritual sense_ doth magnify the Lord;”\r\nfor the name of Deity used in that place does not bring\r\nout the meaning of the passage. It was evidently an [25]\r\nilluminated sense through which she discovered the\r\nspiritual origin of man. “The soul that sinneth, it shall\r\ndie,” means, that mortal man (_alias_ material sense) that\r\nsinneth, shall die; and the commonly accepted view is\r\nthat _soul_ is deathless. Soul is the divine Mind,—for [30]\r\nSoul cannot be formed or brought forth by human\r\n\r\n[Page 76.]\r\n\r\nthought,—and must proceed from God; hence it must [1]\r\nbe sinless, and destitute of self-created or derived capacity\r\nto sin.\r\n\r\n_Third:_ Jesus said, “If a man keep my saying, he\r\nshall never see death.” This statement of our Master [5]\r\nis true, and remains to be demonstrated; for it is the\r\nultimatum of Christian Science; but this immortal saying\r\ncan never be tested or proven true upon a false premise,\r\nsuch as the mortal belief that soul is in body, and life\r\nand intelligence are in matter. That doctrine is not [10]\r\ntheism, but pantheism. According to human belief the\r\nbodies of mortals are mortal, but they contain immortal\r\nsouls! hence these bodies must die for these souls to\r\nescape and be immortal. The theory that death must\r\noccur, to set a human soul free from its environments, [15]\r\nis rendered void by Jesus’ divine declaration, who spake\r\nas never man spake,—and no man can rationally reject\r\nhis authority on this subject and accept it on other topics\r\nless important.\r\n\r\nNow, exchange the term _soul_ for _sense_ whenever this [20]\r\nword means the so-called soul in the body, and you will\r\nfind the right meaning indicated. The misnamed human\r\nsoul is material sense, which sinneth and shall die; for\r\nit is an error or false sense of mentality in matter, and\r\nmatter has no sense. You will admit that Soul is the [25]\r\nLife of man. Now if Soul sinned, it would die; for “the\r\nwages of sin is death.” The Scripture saith, “When\r\nChrist, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also\r\nappear with him in glory.” The Science of Soul, Spirit,\r\ninvolves this appearing, and is essential to the fulfilment [30]\r\nof this glorious prophecy of the master Metaphysician,\r\nwho overcame the last enemy, death.\r\n\r\n[Page 77.]\r\n\r\n_Did the salvation of the eunuch depend merely on his_ [1]\r\n_believing that Jesus Christ was the Son of God?_\r\n\r\nIt did; but this believing was more than faith in the\r\nfact that Jesus was the Messiah. Here the verb _believe_\r\ntook its original meaning, namely, to be _firm_,—yea, to [5]\r\n_understand_ those great truths asserted of the Messiah:\r\nit meant to discern and consent to that infinite demand\r\nmade upon the eunuch in those few words of the apostle.\r\nPhilip’s requirement was, that he should not only ac-\r\nknowledge the incarnation,—God made manifest through [10]\r\nman,—but even the eternal unity of man and God, as\r\nthe divine Principle and spiritual idea; which is the in-\r\ndissoluble bond of union, the power and presence, in\r\ndivine Science, of Life, Truth, and Love, to support their\r\nideal man. This is the Father’s great Love that He [15]\r\nhath bestowed upon us, and it holds man in endless\r\nLife and one eternal round of harmonious being. It\r\nguides him by Truth that knows no error, and with\r\nsupersensual, impartial, and unquenchable Love. To\r\n_believe_ is to _be firm_. In adopting all this vast idea of [20]\r\nChrist Jesus, the eunuch was to _know_ in whom he be-\r\nlieved. To _believe_ thus was to enter the spiritual sanctuary\r\nof Truth, and there learn, in divine Science, somewhat\r\nof the All-Father-Mother God. It was to understand\r\nGod and man: it was sternly to rebuke the mortal [25]\r\nbelief that man has fallen away from his first estate; that\r\nman, made in God’s own likeness, and reflecting Truth,\r\ncould fall into mortal error; or, that man is the father\r\nof man. It was to enter unshod the Holy of Holies, where\r\nthe miracle of grace appears, and where the miracles of [30]\r\nJesus had their birth,—healing the sick, casting out\r\nevils, and resurrecting the human _sense_ to the belief\r\n\r\n[Page 78.]\r\n\r\nthat Life, God, is not buried in matter. This is the spirit- [1]\r\nual dawn of the Messiah, and the overture of the\r\nangels. This is when God is made manifest in the\r\nflesh, and thus it destroys all sense of sin, sickness, and\r\ndeath,—when the brightness of His glory encompasseth [5]\r\nall being.\r\n\r\n_Can Christian Science Mind-healing be taught to those_\r\n_who are absent?_\r\n\r\nThe Science of Mind-healing can no more be taught\r\nthus, than can science in any other direction. I know [10]\r\nnot how to teach either Euclid or the Science of Mind\r\nsilently; and never dreamed that either of these partook\r\nof the nature of occultism, magic, alchemy, or necro-\r\nmancy. These “ways that are vain” are the inventions\r\nof animal magnetism, which would deceive, if possible, [15]\r\nthe very elect. We will charitably hope, however, that\r\nsome people employ the _et cetera_ of ignorance and self-\r\nconceit unconsciously, in their witless ventilation of false\r\nstatements and claims. Misguiding the public mind and\r\ntaking its money in exchange for this abuse, has become [20]\r\ntoo common: we will hope it is the froth of error passing\r\noff; and that Christian Science will some time appear all\r\nthe clearer for the purification of the public thought con-\r\ncerning it.\r\n\r\n_Has man fallen from a state of perfection?_ [25]\r\n\r\nIf God is the Principle of man (and He is), man is the\r\nidea of God; and this idea cannot fail to express the ex-\r\nact nature of its Principle,—any more than goodness,\r\nto present the quality of good. Human hypotheses are\r\nalways human vagaries, formulated views antagonistic [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 79.]\r\n\r\nto the divine order and the nature of Deity. All these [1]\r\nmortal beliefs will be purged and dissolved in the cru-\r\ncible of Truth, and the places once knowing them will\r\nknow them no more forever, having been swept clean\r\nby the winds of history. The grand verities of Science [5]\r\nwill sift the chaff from the wheat, until it is clear to hu-\r\nman comprehension that man was, and is, God’s perfect\r\nlikeness, that reflects all whereby we can know God. In\r\nHim we live, move, and have being. Man’s origin and\r\nexistence being in Him, man is the ultimatum of per- [10]\r\nfection, and by no means the medium of imperfection.\r\nImmortal man is the eternal idea of Truth, that cannot\r\nlapse into a mortal belief or error concerning himself\r\nand his origin: he cannot get out of the focal distance of\r\ninfinity. If God is upright and eternal, man as His like- [15]\r\nness is erect in goodness and perpetual in Life, Truth,\r\nand Love. If the great cause is perfect, its effect is per-\r\nfect also; and cause and effect in Science are immutable\r\nand immortal. A mortal who is sinning, sick, and dying,\r\nis not immortal man; and never was, and never can be, [20]\r\nGod’s image and likeness, the true ideal of immortal\r\nman’s divine Principle. The spiritual man is that per-\r\nfect and unfallen likeness, coexistent and coeternal with\r\nGod. “As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be\r\nmade alive.” [25]\r\n\r\n_What course should Christian Scientists take in regard_\r\n_to aiding persons brought before the courts for violation of_\r\n_medical statutes?_\r\n\r\nBeware of joining any medical league which in any\r\nway obligates you to assist—because they chance to be [30]\r\nunder arrest—vendors of patent pills, mesmerists,\r\n\r\n[Page 80.]\r\n\r\noccultists, sellers of impure literature, and authors of [1]\r\nspurious works on mental healing. By rendering error\r\nsuch a service, you lose much more than can be gained\r\nby mere unity on the single issue of opposition to unjust\r\nmedical laws. [5]\r\n\r\nA league which obligates its members to give money\r\nand influence in support and defense of medical char-\r\nlatans in general, and possibly to aid individual rights\r\nin a wrong direction—which Christian Science eschews\r\n—should be avoided. Anybody and everybody, who [10]\r\nwill fight the medical faculty, can join this league. It is\r\nbetter to be friendly with cultured and conscientious\r\nmedical men, who leave Christian Science to rise or fall\r\non its own merit or demerit, than to affiliate with a wrong\r\nclass of people. [15]\r\n\r\nUnconstitutional and unjust coercive legislation and\r\nlaws, infringing individual rights, must be “of few days,\r\nand full of trouble.” The _vox populi_, through the provi-\r\ndence of God, promotes and impels all true reform; and,\r\nat the best time, will redress wrongs and rectify injus- [20]\r\ntice. Tyranny can thrive but feebly under our Govern-\r\nment. God reigns, and will “turn and overturn” until\r\nright is found supreme.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, we should commiserate the lot of\r\nregular doctors, who, in successive generations for cen- [25]\r\nturies, have planted and sown and reaped in the fields\r\nof what they deem pathology, hygiene, and therapeutics,\r\nbut are now elbowed by a new school of practitioners,\r\noutdoing the healing of the old. The old will not patronize\r\nthe new school, at least not until it shall come to understand [30]\r\nthe medical system of the new.\r\n\r\nChristian Science Mind-healing rests demonstrably on\r\n\r\n[Page 81.]\r\n\r\nthe broad and sure foundation of Science; and this is [1]\r\nnot the basis of _materia medica_, as some of the most skil-\r\nful and scholarly physicians openly admit.\r\n\r\nTo prevent all unpleasant and unchristian action—as\r\nwe drift, by right of God’s dear love, into more spiritual [5]\r\nlines of life—let each society of practitioners, the matter-\r\nphysicians and the metaphysicians, agree to disagree, and\r\nthen patiently wait on God to decide, as surely He will,\r\nwhich is the true system of medicine.\r\n\r\n_Do we not see in the commonly accepted teachings of the_ [10]\r\n_day, the Christ-idea mingled with the teachings of John_\r\n_the Baptist? or, rather, Are not the last eighteen centuries_\r\n_but the footsteps of Truth being baptized of John, and com-_\r\n_ing up straightway out of the ceremonial (or ritualistic)_\r\n_waters to receive the benediction of an honored Father, and_ [15]\r\n_afterwards to go up into the wilderness, in order to over-_\r\n_come mortal sense, before it shall go forth into all the cities_\r\n_and towns of Judea, or see many of the people from beyond_\r\n_Jordan? Now, if all this be a fair or correct view of this_\r\n_question, why does not John hear this voice, or see the_ [20]\r\n_dove,—or has not Truth yet reached the shore?_\r\n\r\nEvery individual character, like the individual John\r\nthe Baptist, at some date must cry in the desert of\r\nearthly joy; and his voice be heard divinely and\r\nhumanly. In the desolation of human understanding, [25]\r\ndivine Love hears and answers the human call for help;\r\nand the voice of Truth utters the divine verities of being\r\nwhich deliver mortals out of the depths of ignorance\r\nand vice. This _is_ the Father’s benediction. It gives\r\nlessons to human life, guides the understanding, peoples [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 82.]\r\n\r\nthe mind with spiritual ideas, reconstructs the Judean [1]\r\nreligion, and reveals God and man as the Principle and\r\nidea of all good.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this fact in Christian Science, brings\r\nthe peace symbolized by a dove; and this peace floweth [5]\r\nas a river into a shoreless eternity. He who knew the\r\nforetelling Truth, beheld the forthcoming Truth, as it\r\ncame up out of the baptism of Spirit, to enlighten and\r\nredeem mortals. Such Christians as John cognize the\r\nsymbols of God, reach the sure foundations of time, stand [10]\r\nupon the shore of eternity, and grasp and gather—in all\r\nglory—what eye hath not seen.\r\n\r\n_Is there infinite progression with man after the destruc-_\r\n_tion of mortal mind?_\r\n\r\nMan is the offspring and idea of the Supreme Being, [15]\r\nwhose law is perfect and infinite. In obedience to this\r\nlaw, man is forever unfolding the endless beatitudes of\r\nBeing; for he is the image and likeness of infinite Life,\r\nTruth, and Love.\r\n\r\nInfinite progression is concrete being, which finite [20]\r\nmortals see and comprehend only as abstract glory. As\r\nmortal mind, or the material sense of life, is put off,\r\nthe spiritual sense and Science of being is brought to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nMortal mind is a myth; the one Mind is immortal. [25]\r\nA mythical or mortal sense of existence is consumed\r\nas a moth, in the treacherous glare of its own flame—\r\nthe errors which devour it. Immortal Mind is God,\r\nimmortal good; in whom the Scripture saith “we live,\r\nand move, and have our being.” This Mind, then, is not [30]\r\nsubject to growth, change, or diminution, but is the divine\r\n\r\n[Page 83.]\r\n\r\nintelligence, or Principle, of all real being; holding [1]\r\nman forever in the rhythmic round of unfolding bliss,\r\nas a living witness to and perpetual idea of inexhaustible\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n_In your book, Science and Health,_(_3_)_ page 181, you_ [5]\r\n_say: __“__Every sin is the author of itself, and every_\r\n_invalid the cause of his own sufferings.__”__ On page_\r\n_182 you say: __“__Sickness is a growth of illusion, spring-_\r\n_ing from a seed of thought,—either your own thought_\r\n_or another’s.__”__ Will you please explain this seeming_ [10]\r\n_contradiction?_\r\n\r\nNo person can accept another’s belief, except it be\r\nwith the consent of his own belief. If the error which\r\nknocks at the door of your own thought originated in\r\nanother’s mind, you are a free moral agent to reject or [15]\r\nto accept this error; hence, you are the arbiter of your\r\nown fate, and sin is the author of sin. In the words\r\nof our Master, you are “a liar, and the father of it\r\n[the lie].”\r\n\r\n_Why did Jesus call himself __“__the Son of man__”__?_ [20]\r\n\r\nIn the life of our Lord, meekness was as conspicuous\r\nas might. In John xvii. he declared his sonship with\r\nGod: “These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his\r\neyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come;\r\nglorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.” [25]\r\nThe hour had come for the avowal of this great truth,\r\nand for the proof of his eternal Life and sonship. Jesus’\r\n\r\n[Page 84.]\r\n\r\nwisdom ofttimes was shown by his forbearing to speak, [1]\r\nas well as by speaking, the whole truth. Haply he waited\r\nfor a preparation of the human heart to receive start-\r\nling announcements. This wisdom, which character-\r\nized his sayings, did not prophesy his death, and thereby [5]\r\nhasten or permit it.\r\n\r\nThe disciples and prophets thrust disputed points on\r\nminds unprepared for them. This cost them their lives,\r\nand the world’s temporary esteem; but the prophecies\r\nwere fulfilled, and their motives were rewarded by [10]\r\ngrowth and more spiritual understanding, which dawns\r\nby degrees on mortals. The spiritual Christ was infal-\r\nlible; Jesus, as material manhood, was not Christ. The\r\n“man of sorrows” knew that the man of joys, his spiritual\r\nself, or Christ, was the Son of God; and that the mor- [15]\r\ntal mind, not the immortal Mind, suffered. The human\r\nmanifestation of the Son of God was called the Son of\r\nman, or Mary’s son.\r\n\r\n_Please explain Paul’s meaning in the text, __“__For to me_\r\n_to live is Christ, and to die is gain.__”_ [20]\r\n\r\nThe Science of Life, overshadowing Paul’s sense of\r\nlife in matter, so far extinguished the latter as forever\r\nto quench his love for it. The discipline of the flesh is\r\ndesigned to turn one, like a weary traveller, to the home\r\nof Love. To lose error thus, is to live in Christ, Truth. [25]\r\nA true sense of the falsity of material joys and sorrows,\r\npleasures and pains, takes them away, and teaches Life’s\r\nlessons aright. The transition from our lower sense of\r\nLife to a new and higher sense thereof, even though it be\r\nthrough the door named death, yields a clearer and [30]\r\nnearer sense of Life to those who have utilized the present,\r\n\r\n[Page 85.]\r\n\r\nand are ripe for the harvest-home. To the battle- [1]\r\nworn and weary Christian hero, Life eternal brings\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\n_Is a Christian Scientist ever sick, and has he who is_\r\n_sick been regenerated?_ [5]\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist learns spiritually all that he\r\nknows of Life, and demonstrates what he understands.\r\nGod is recognized as the divine Principle of his being,\r\nand of every thought and act leading to good. His pur-\r\npose must be right, though his power is temporarily lim- [10]\r\nited. Perfection, the goal of existence, is not won in a\r\nmoment; and regeneration leading thereto is gradual,\r\nfor it culminates in the fulfilment of this divine rule in\r\nScience: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father\r\nwhich is in heaven is perfect.” [15]\r\n\r\nThe last degree of regeneration rises into the rest of\r\nperpetual, spiritual, individual existence. The first\r\nfeeble fluttering of mortals Christward are infantile\r\nand more or less imperfect. The new-born Christian\r\nScientist must mature, and work out his own salvation. [20]\r\nSpirit and flesh antagonize. Temptation, that mist of\r\nmortal mind which seems to be matter and the environ-\r\nment of mortals, suggests pleasure and pain in matter;\r\nand, so long as this temptation lasts, the warfare is not\r\nended and the mortal is not regenerated. The pleas- [25]\r\nures—more than the pains—of sense, retard regenera-\r\ntion; for pain compels human consciousness to escape\r\nfrom sense into the immortality and harmony of Soul.\r\nDisease in error, more than ease in it, tends to destroy\r\nerror: the sick often are thereby led to Christ, Truth, [30]\r\nand to learn their way out of both sickness and sin.\r\n\r\n[Page 86.]\r\n\r\nThe material and physical are imperfect. The in- [1]\r\ndividual and spiritual are perfect; these have no fleshly\r\nnature. This final degree of regeneration is saving, and\r\nthe Christian will, must, attain it; but it doth not yet\r\nappear. Until this be attained, the Christian Scientist [5]\r\nmust continue to strive with sickness, sin, and death—\r\nthough in lessening degrees—and manifest growth at\r\nevery experience.\r\n\r\n_Is it correct to say of material objects, that they are noth-_\r\n_ing and exist only in imagination?_ [10]\r\n\r\n_Nothing_ and _something_ are words which need correct\r\ndefinition. They either mean formations of indefinite\r\nand vague human opinions, or scientific classifications\r\nof the unreal and the real. My sense of the beauty of\r\nthe universe is, that beauty typifies holiness, and is some- [15]\r\nthing to be desired. Earth is more spiritually beautiful\r\nto my gaze now than when it was more earthly to the\r\neyes of Eve. The pleasant sensations of human belief,\r\nof form and color, must be spiritualized, until we gain the\r\nglorified sense of substance as in the new heaven and [20]\r\nearth, the harmony of body and Mind.\r\n\r\nEven the human conception of beauty, grandeur, and\r\nutility is something that defies a sneer. It is more than\r\nimagination. It is next to divine beauty and the gran-\r\ndeur of Spirit. It lives with our earth-life, and is [25]\r\nthe subjective state of high thoughts. The atmos-\r\nphere of mortal mind constitutes our mortal envi-\r\nronment. What mortals hear, see, feel, taste, smell,\r\nconstitutes their present earth and heaven: but we must\r\ngrow out of even this pleasing thraldom, and find wings [30]\r\nto reach the glory of supersensible Life; then we shall\r\n\r\n[Page 87.]\r\n\r\nsoar above, as the bird in the clear ether of the blue tem- [1]\r\nporal sky.\r\n\r\nTo take all earth’s beauty into one gulp of vacuity\r\nand label beauty nothing, is ignorantly to caricature\r\nGod’s creation, which is unjust to human sense and [5]\r\nto the divine realism. In our immature sense of spirit-\r\nual things, let us say of the beauties of the sensuous\r\nuniverse: “I love your promise; and shall know, some\r\ntime, the spiritual reality and substance of form, light,\r\nand color, of what I now through you discern dimly; and [10]\r\nknowing this, I shall be satisfied. Matter is a frail con-\r\nception of mortal mind; and mortal mind is a poorer\r\nrepresentative of the beauty, grandeur, and glory of the\r\nimmortal Mind.”\r\n\r\n_Please inform us through your Journal; if you sent_ [15]\r\n_Mrs. —— to ——. She said that you sent her there to look_\r\n_after the students; and also, that no one there was working_\r\n_in Science,—which is certainly a mistake._\r\n\r\nI never commission any one to teach students of mine.\r\nAfter class teaching, he does best in the investigation of [20]\r\nChristian Science who is most reliant on himself and\r\nGod. My students are taught the divine Principle and\r\nrules of the Science of Mind-healing. What they need\r\nthereafter is to study thoroughly the Scriptures and\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.” To [25]\r\nwatch and pray, to be honest, earnest, loving, and truth-\r\nful, is indispensable to the demonstration of the truth\r\nthey have been taught.\r\n\r\nIf they are haunted by obsequious helpers, who, un-\r\ncalled for, imagine they can help anybody and steady [30]\r\nGod’s altar—this interference prolongs the struggle\r\n\r\n[Page 88.]\r\n\r\nand tends to blight the fruits of my students. A faith- [1]\r\nful student may even sometimes feel the need of\r\nphysical help, and occasionally receive it from others;\r\nbut the less this is required, the better it is for that\r\nstudent. [5]\r\n\r\n_Please give us, through your Journal, the name of_\r\n_the author of that genuine critique in the September_\r\n_number, __“__What Quibus Thinks.__”_\r\n\r\nI am pleased to inform this inquirer, that the author\r\nof the article in question is a Boston gentleman whose [10]\r\nthought is appreciated by many liberals. Patience, ob-\r\nservation, intellectual culture, reading, writing, exten-\r\nsive travel, and twenty years in the pulpit, have equipped\r\nhim as a critic who knows whereof he speaks. His allu-\r\nsion to Christian Science in the following paragraph, [15]\r\nglows in the shadow of darkling criticism like a mid-\r\nnight sun. Its manly honesty follows like a benediction\r\nafter prayer, and closes the task of talking to deaf ears\r\nand dull debaters.\r\n\r\n“We have always insisted that this Science is natural, [20]\r\nspiritually natural; that Jesus was the highest type of\r\nreal nature; that Christian healing is supernatural, or\r\nextra-natural, only to those who do not enter into its\r\nsublimity or understand its modes—as imported ice\r\nwas miraculous to the equatorial African, who had never [25]\r\nseen water freeze.”\r\n\r\n_Is it right for a Scientist to treat with a doctor?_\r\n\r\nThis depends upon what kind of a doctor it is. Mind-\r\nhealing, and healing with drugs, are opposite modes of\r\nmedicine. As a rule, drop one of these doctors when you [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 89.]\r\n\r\nemploy the other. The Scripture saith, “No man can [1]\r\nserve two masters;” and, “Every kingdom divided\r\nagainst itself is brought to desolation.”\r\n\r\n_If Scientists are called upon to care for a member of_\r\n_the family, or a friend in sickness, who is employing a_ [5]\r\n_regular physician, would it be right to treat this patient_\r\n_at all; and ought the patient to follow the doctor’s_\r\n_directions?_\r\n\r\nWhen patients are under material medical treatment,\r\nit is advisable in most cases that Scientists do not treat [10]\r\nthem, or interfere with _materia medica_. If the patient\r\nis in peril, and you save him or alleviate his sufferings,\r\nalthough the medical attendant and friends have no\r\nfaith in your method, it is humane, and not unchristian,\r\nto do him all the good you can; but your good will gen- [15]\r\nerally “be evil spoken of.” The hazard of casting “pearls\r\nbefore swine” caused our Master to refuse help to some\r\nwho sought his aid; and he left this precaution for\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n_If mortal man is unreal, how can he be saved, and why_ [20]\r\n_does he need to be saved? I ask for information, not for_\r\n_controversy, for I am a seeker after Truth._\r\n\r\nYou will find the proper answer to this question in\r\nmy published works. Man is immortal. Mortal man\r\nis a false concept that is not spared or prolonged by being [25]\r\nsaved from itself, from whatever is false. This salva-\r\ntion means: saved from error, or error overcome. Im-\r\nmortal man, in God’s likeness, is safe in divine Science.\r\nMortal man is saved on this divine Principle, if he will\r\nonly avail himself of the efficacy of Truth, and recog- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 90.]\r\n\r\nnize his Saviour. He must know that God is omnipo- [1]\r\ntent; hence, that sin is impotent. He must know that\r\nthe power of sin is the pleasure in sin. Take away this\r\npleasure, and you remove all reality from its power. Jesus\r\ndemonstrated sin and death to be powerless. This [5]\r\npractical Truth saves from sin, and will save all who\r\nunderstand it.\r\n\r\n_Is it wrong for a wife to have a husband treated for_\r\n_sin, when she knows he is sinning, or for drinking and_\r\n_smoking?_ [10]\r\n\r\nIt is always right to act rightly; but sometimes, under\r\ncircumstances exceptional, it is inexpedient to attack\r\nevil. This rule is forever golden: “As ye would that\r\nmen should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Do you\r\ndesire to be freed from sin? Then help others to be free; [15]\r\nbut in your measures, obey the Scriptures, “Be ye wise\r\nas serpents.” Break the yoke of bondage in every wise\r\nway. First, be sure that your means for doing good\r\nare equal to your motives; then judge them by their\r\nfruits. [20]\r\n\r\n_If not ordained, shall the pastor of the Church of_\r\n_Christ, Scientist, administer the communion,—and_\r\n_shall members of a church not organized receive the_\r\n_communion?_\r\n\r\nOur great Master administered to his disciples the [25]\r\nPassover, or last supper, without this prerogative being\r\nconferred by a visible organization and ordained priest-\r\nhood. His spiritually prepared breakfast, after his\r\nresurrection, and after his disciples had left their nets\r\nto follow him, is the spiritual communion which Chris- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 91.]\r\n\r\ntian Scientists celebrate in commemoration of the Christ. [1]\r\nThis ordinance is significant as a type of the true worship,\r\nand it should be observed at present in our churches.\r\n\r\nIt is not indispensable to organize materially Christ’s\r\nchurch. It is not absolutely necessary to ordain pas- [5]\r\ntors and to dedicate churches; but if this be done,\r\nlet it be in concession to the period, and not as a per-\r\npetual or indispensable ceremonial of the church. If\r\nour church is organized, it is to meet the demand,\r\n“Suffer it to be so now.” The real Christian compact [10]\r\nis love for one another. This bond is wholly spiritual\r\nand inviolate.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative, at all times and under every cir-\r\ncumstance, to perpetuate no ceremonials except as\r\ntypes of these mental conditions,—remembrance and [15]\r\nlove; a real affection for Jesus’ character and example.\r\nBe it remembered, that all types employed in the ser-\r\nvice of Christian Science should represent the most spir-\r\nitual forms of thought and worship that can be made\r\nvisible. [20]\r\n\r\n_Should not the teacher of Christian Science have our_\r\n_textbook, __“__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,__”_\r\n_in his schoolroom and teach from it?_\r\n\r\nI never dreamed, until informed thereof, that a loyal\r\nstudent did not take his textbook with him into the class- [25]\r\nroom, ask questions from it, answer them according to\r\nit, and, as occasion required, read from the book as au-\r\nthority for what he taught. I supposed that students\r\nhad followed my example, and that of other teachers,\r\nsufficiently to do this, and also to require their pupils to [30]\r\nstudy the lessons before recitations.\r\n\r\n[Page 92.]\r\n\r\nTo omit these important points is anomalous, con- [1]\r\nsidering the necessity for understanding Science, and\r\nthe present liability of deviating from Christian Science.\r\nCenturies will intervene before the statement of the inex-\r\nhaustible topics of that book become sufficiently under- [5]\r\nstood to be absolutely demonstrated. The teacher of\r\nChristian Science needs continually to study this textbook.\r\nHis work is to replenish thought, and to spiritualize human\r\nlife, from this open fount of Truth and Love.\r\n\r\nHe who sees most clearly and enlightens other minds [10]\r\nmost readily, keeps his own lamp trimmed and burning.\r\nHe will take the textbook of Christian Science into his\r\nclass, repeat the questions in the chapter on Recapitula-\r\ntion, and his students will answer them from the same\r\nsource. Throughout his entire explanations, the teacher [15]\r\nshould strictly adhere to the questions and answers con-\r\ntained in that chapter of “Science and Health with Key\r\nto the Scriptures.” It is important to point out the\r\nlesson to the class, and to require the students thor-\r\noughly to study it before the recitations; for this spirit- [20]\r\nualizes their thoughts. When closing his class, the\r\nteacher should require each member to own a copy of\r\nthe above-named book and to continue the study of this\r\ntextbook.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of men cannot be substituted for God’s [25]\r\nrevelation. It must not be forgotten that in times past,\r\narrogant ignorance and pride, in attempting to steady\r\nthe ark of Truth, have dimmed the power and glory of\r\nthe Scriptures, to which this Christian Science textbook\r\nis the Key. [30]\r\n\r\nThat teacher does most for his students who most\r\ndivests himself of pride and self, spiritualizes his own\r\n\r\n[Page 93.]\r\n\r\nthought, and by reason thereof is able to empty his stu- [1]\r\ndents’ minds, that they may be filled with Truth.\r\n\r\nBeloved students, _so_ teach that posterity shall call\r\nyou blessed, and the heart of history shall be made\r\nglad! [5]\r\n\r\n_Can fear or sin bring back old beliefs of disease that have_\r\n_been healed by Christian Science?_\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures plainly declare the allness and oneness\r\nof God to be the premises of Truth, and that God is\r\ngood: in Him dwelleth no evil. Christian Science au- [10]\r\nthorizes the logical conclusion drawn from the Scriptures,\r\nthat there is in reality none besides the eternal, infinite\r\nGod, good. Evil is temporal: it is the illusion of time\r\nand mortality.\r\n\r\nThis being true, sin has no power; and fear, its coeval, [15]\r\nis without divine authority. Science sanctions only what\r\nis supported by the unerring Principle of being. Sin can\r\ndo nothing: all cause and effect are in God. Fear is a\r\nbelief of sensation in matter: this belief is neither main-\r\ntained by Science nor supported by facts, and exists only [20]\r\nas fable. Your answer is, that neither fear nor sin can\r\nbring on disease or bring back disease, since there is in\r\nreality no disease.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, however, that human consciousness does\r\nnot test sin and the fact of its nothingness, by believing [25]\r\nthat sin is pardoned without repentance and reforma-\r\ntion. Sin punishes itself, because it cannot go unpun-\r\nished either here or hereafter. Nothing is more fatal than\r\nto indulge a sinning sense or consciousness for even one\r\nmoment. Knowing this, obey Christ’s Sermon on the [30]\r\nMount, even if you suffer for it in the first instance,—\r\n\r\n[Page 94.]\r\n\r\nare misjudged and maligned; in the second, you will [1]\r\nreign with him.\r\n\r\nI never knew a person who knowingly indulged evil,\r\nto be grateful; to understand me, or himself. He must\r\nfirst see himself and the hallucination of sin; then he [5]\r\nmust repent, and love good in order to understand God.\r\nThe sinner and the sin are the twain that are one flesh,—\r\nbut which God hath not joined together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 95.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Science In Tremont Temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the platform of the Monday lectureship in [2]\r\nTremont Temple, on Monday, March 16, 1885, as\r\nwill be seen by what follows. Reverend Mary Baker G.\r\nEddy was presented to Mr. Cook’s audience, and allowed [5]\r\nten minutes in which to reply to his public letter con-\r\ndemning her doctrines; which reply was taken in full by\r\na shorthand reporter who was present, and is transcribed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy responding, said:— [10]\r\n\r\nAs the time so kindly allotted me is insufficient for\r\neven a synopsis of Christian Science, I shall confine my-\r\nself to questions and answers.\r\n\r\nAm I a spiritualist?\r\n\r\nI am not, and never was. I understand the impossi- [15]\r\nbility of intercommunion between the so-called dead and\r\nliving. There have always attended my life phenomena\r\nof an uncommon order, which spiritualists have mis-\r\ncalled mediumship; but I clearly understand that no\r\nhuman agencies were employed,—that the divine Mind [20]\r\nreveals itself to humanity through spiritual law. And\r\nto such as are “waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption\r\nof our body,” Christian Science reveals the in-\r\n\r\n[Page 96.]\r\n\r\nfinitude of divinity and the way of man’s salvation from [1]\r\nsickness and death, as wrought out by Jesus, who robbed\r\nthe grave of victory and death of its sting. I understand\r\nthat God is an ever-present help in all times of trouble,—\r\nhave found Him so; and would have no other gods, no [5]\r\nremedies in drugs, no material medicine.\r\n\r\nDo I believe in a personal God?\r\n\r\nI believe in God as the Supreme Being. I know not\r\nwhat the person of omnipotence and omnipresence is,\r\nor what the infinite includes; therefore, I worship that [10]\r\nof which I can conceive, first, as a loving Father and\r\nMother; then, as thought ascends the scale of being to\r\ndiviner consciousness, God becomes to me, as to the\r\napostle who declared it, “God is Love,”—divine Prin-\r\nciple,—which I worship; and “after the manner of my [15]\r\nfathers, so worship I God.”\r\n\r\nDo I believe in the atonement of Christ?\r\n\r\nI do; and this atonement becomes more to me since\r\nit includes man’s redemption from sickness as well as\r\nfrom sin. I reverence and adore Christ as never before. [20]\r\n\r\nIt brings to my sense, and to the sense of all who enter-\r\ntain this understanding of the Science of God, a _whole_\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nHow is the healing done in Christian Science?\r\n\r\nThis answer includes too much to give you any con- [25]\r\nclusive idea in a brief explanation. I can name some\r\nmeans by which it is not done.\r\n\r\nIt is not one mind acting upon another mind; it is\r\nnot the transference of human images of thought to\r\nother minds; it is not supported by the evidence before [30]\r\nthe personal senses,—Science contradicts this evidence;\r\nit is not of the flesh, but of the Spirit. It is Christ come\r\n\r\n[Page 97.]\r\n\r\nto destroy the power of the flesh; it is Truth over error; [1]\r\nthat understood, gives man ability to rise above the evi-\r\ndence of the senses, take hold of the eternal energies of\r\nTruth, and destroy mortal discord with immortal har-\r\nmony,—the grand verities of being. It is not one mortal [5]\r\nthought transmitted to another’s thought from the human\r\nmind that holds within itself all evil.\r\n\r\nOur Master said of one of his students, “He is a devil,”\r\nand repudiated the idea of casting out devils through\r\nBeelzebub. Erring human mind is by no means a de- [10]\r\nsirable or efficacious healer. Such suppositional healing\r\nI deprecate. It is in no way allied to divine power. All\r\nhuman control is animal magnetism, more despicable\r\nthan all other methods of treating disease.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is not a remedy of faith alone, but [15]\r\ncombines faith with understanding, through which we\r\nmay touch the hem of His garment; and know that om-\r\nnipotence has all power. “I am the Lord, and there is\r\nnone else, there is no God beside me.”\r\n\r\nIs there a personal man? [20]\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures inform us that man was made in the\r\nimage and likeness of God. I commend the Icelandic\r\ntranslation: “He created man in the image and likeness\r\nof Mind, in the image and likeness of Mind created\r\nHe him.” To my sense, we have not seen all of man; [25]\r\nhe is more than personal sense can cognize, who is the\r\nimage and likeness of the infinite. I have not seen a\r\nperfect man in mind or body,—and such must be the\r\npersonality of him who is the true likeness: the lost\r\nimage is not this personality, and corporeal man is this [30]\r\nlost image; hence, it doth not appear what is the real\r\npersonality of man. The only cause for making this\r\n\r\n[Page 98.]\r\n\r\nquestion of personality a point, or of any importance, is [1]\r\nthat man’s perfect model should be held in mind, whereby\r\nto improve his present condition; that his contemplation\r\nregarding himself should turn away from inharmony, sick-\r\nness, and sin, to that which is the image of his Maker. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScience And The Senses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstance of my Address at the National Convention in Chicago,\r\nJune 13, 1888\r\n\r\nThe National Christian Scientist Association has\r\nbrought us together to minister and to be ministered [10]\r\nunto; mutually to aid one another in finding ways and\r\nmeans for helping the whole human family; to quicken\r\nand extend the interest already felt in a higher mode of\r\nmedicine; to watch with eager joy the individual growth\r\nof Christian Scientists, and the progress of our common [15]\r\nCause in Chicago,—the miracle of the Occident. We\r\ncome to strengthen and perpetuate our organizations\r\nand institutions; and to find strength in union,—strength\r\nto build up, through God’s right hand, that pure and\r\nundefiled religion whose Science demonstrates God and [20]\r\nthe perfectibility of man. This purpose is immense,\r\nand it must begin with individual growth, a “consum-\r\nmation devoutly to be wished.” The lives of all re-\r\nformers attest the authenticity of their mission, and call\r\nthe world to acknowledge its divine Principle. Truly [25]\r\nis it written:—\r\n\r\n“Thou must be true thyself, if thou the truth would’st teach;\r\nThy heart must overflow, if thou another’s heart would’st reach.”\r\n\r\n[Page 99.]\r\n\r\nScience is absolute and final. It is revolutionary in [1]\r\nits very nature; for it upsets all that is not upright.\r\nIt annuls false evidence, and saith to the five material\r\nsenses, “Having eyes ye see not, and ears ye hear not;\r\nneither can you understand.” To weave one thread of [5]\r\nScience through the looms of time, is a miracle in itself.\r\nThe risk is stupendous. It cost Galileo, what? This\r\nawful price: the temporary loss of his self-respect. His\r\nfear overcame his loyalty; the courage of his convictions\r\nfell before it. Fear is the weapon in the hands of [10]\r\ntyrants.\r\n\r\nMen and women of the nineteenth century, are you\r\ncalled to voice a higher order of Science? Then obey\r\nthis call. Go, if you must, to the dungeon or the scaf-\r\nfold, but take not back the words of Truth. How many [15]\r\nare there ready to suffer for a righteous cause, to stand\r\na long siege, take the front rank, face the foe, and be\r\nin the battle every day?\r\n\r\nIn no other one thing seemed Jesus of Nazareth more\r\ndivine than in his faith in the immortality of his words. [20]\r\nHe said, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my\r\nwords shall not pass away;” and they have not. The\r\nwinds of time sweep clean the centuries, but they can\r\nnever bear into oblivion his words. They still live, and\r\nto-morrow speak louder than to-day. They are to-day [25]\r\nas the voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make\r\nstraight God’s paths; make way for health, holiness,\r\nuniversal harmony, and come up hither.” The gran-\r\ndeur of the word, the power of Truth, is again casting\r\nout evils and healing the sick; and it is whispered, “This [30]\r\nis Science.”\r\n\r\nJesus taught by the wayside, in humble homes. He\r\n\r\n[Page 100.]\r\n\r\nspake of Truth and Love to artless listeners and dull [1]\r\ndisciples. His immortal words were articulated in a\r\ndecaying language, and then left to the providence of\r\nGod. Christian Science was to interpret them; and\r\nwoman, “last at the cross,” was to awaken the dull senses, [5]\r\nintoxicated with pleasure or pain, to the infinite meaning\r\nof those words.\r\n\r\nPast, present, future, will show the word and might of\r\nTruth—healing the sick and reclaiming the sinner—\r\nso long as there remains a claim of error for Truth to [10]\r\ndeny or to destroy. Love’s labors are not lost. The\r\nfive personal senses, that grasp neither the meaning nor\r\nthe magnitude of self-abnegation, may lose sight thereof;\r\nbut Science voices unselfish love, unfolds infinite good,\r\nleads on irresistible forces, and will finally show the fruits [15]\r\nof Love. Human reason is inaccurate; and the scope\r\nof the senses is inadequate to grasp the word of Truth,\r\nand teach the eternal.\r\n\r\nScience speaks when the senses are silent, and then\r\nthe evermore of Truth is triumphant. The spiritual mon- [20]\r\nitor understood is coincidence of the divine with the\r\nhuman, the acme of Christian Science. Pure humanity,\r\nfriendship, home, the interchange of love, bring to earth\r\na foretaste of heaven. They unite terrestrial and celes-\r\ntial joys, and crown them with blessings infinite. [25]\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist loves man more because he\r\nloves God most. He understands this Principle,—Love.\r\nWho is sufficient for these things? Who remembers that\r\npatience, forgiveness, abiding faith, and affection, are\r\nthe symptoms by which our Father indicates the dif- [30]\r\nferent stages of man’s recovery from sin and his en-\r\ntrance into Science? Who knows how the feeble lips\r\n\r\n[Page 101.]\r\n\r\nare made eloquent, how hearts are inspired, how heal- [1]\r\ning becomes spontaneous, and how the divine Mind is\r\nunderstood and demonstrated? He alone knows these\r\nwonders who is departing from the thraldom of the\r\nsenses and accepting spiritual truth,—that which blesses [5]\r\nits adoption by the refinement of joy and the dismissal of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nChristian Science and the senses are at war. It is a\r\nrevolutionary struggle. We already have had two in\r\nthis nation; and they began and ended in a contest for [10]\r\nthe true idea, for human liberty and rights. Now cometh\r\na third struggle; for the freedom of health, holiness, and\r\nthe attainment of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe scientific sense of being which establishes har-\r\nmony, enters into no compromise with finiteness and [15]\r\nfeebleness. It undermines the foundations of mortality,\r\nof physical law, breaks their chains, and sets the captive\r\nfree, opening the doors for them that are bound.\r\n\r\nHe who turns to the body for evidence, bases his con-\r\nclusions on mortality, on imperfection; but Science saith\r\nto man, “God hath all-power.” [20]\r\n\r\nThe Science of omnipotence demonstrates but one\r\npower, and this power is good, not evil; not matter,\r\nbut Mind. This virtually destroys matter and evil, in-\r\ncluding sin and disease. [25]\r\n\r\nIf God is All, and God is good, it follows that all\r\nmust be good; and no other power, law, or intelligence\r\ncan exist. On this proof rest premise and conclusion in\r\nScience, and the facts that disprove the evidence of the\r\nsenses. [30]\r\n\r\nGod is individual Mind. This one Mind and His\r\nindividuality comprise the elements of all forms and\r\n\r\n[Page 102.]\r\n\r\nindividualities, and prophesy the nature and stature of [1]\r\nChrist, the ideal man.\r\n\r\nA corporeal God, as often defined by lexicographers\r\nand scholastic theologians, is only an infinite finite being,\r\nan unlimited man,—a theory to me inconceivable. If [5]\r\nthe unlimited and immortal Mind could originate in a\r\nlimited body, Mind would be chained to finity, and the\r\ninfinite forever finite.\r\n\r\nIn this limited and lower sense God is not personal.\r\nHis infinity precludes the possibility of corporeal person- [10]\r\nality. His being is individual, but not physical.\r\n\r\nGod is like Himself and like nothing else. He is uni-\r\nversal and primitive. His character admits of no degrees\r\nof comparison. God is not part, but the whole. In His\r\nindividuality I recognize the loving, divine Father-Mother [15]\r\nGod. Infinite personality must be incorporeal.\r\n\r\nGod’s ways are not ours. His pity is expressed in\r\nmodes above the human. His chastisements are the\r\nmanifestations of Love. The sympathy of His eternal\r\nMind is fully expressed in divine Science, which blots [20]\r\nout all our iniquities and heals all our diseases. Human\r\npity often brings pain.\r\n\r\nScience supports harmony, denies suffering, and de-\r\nstroys it with the divinity of Truth. Whatever seems mate-\r\nrial, seems thus only to the material senses, and is but the [25]\r\nsubjective state of mortal and material thought.\r\n\r\nScience has inaugurated the irrepressible conflict be-\r\ntween sense and Soul. Mortal thought wars with this\r\nsense as one that beateth the air, but Science outmasters\r\nit, and ends the warfare. This proves daily that “one [30]\r\non God’s side is a majority.”\r\n\r\nScience defines _omnipresence_ as universality, that which\r\n\r\n[Page 103.]\r\n\r\nprecludes the presence of evil. This verity annuls the tes- [1]\r\ntimony of the senses, which say that sin is an evil power,\r\nand substance is perishable. Intelligent Spirit, Soul, is\r\nsubstance, far more impregnable and solid than matter; for\r\none is temporal, while the other is eternal, the ultimate [5]\r\nand predicate of being.\r\n\r\nMortality, materiality, and destructive forces, such as\r\nsin, disease, and death, mortals virtually name _substance_;\r\nbut these are the substance of things _not_ hoped for. For\r\nlack of knowing what substance is, the senses say vaguely: [10]\r\n“The substance of life is sorrow and mortality; for who\r\nknoweth the substance of good?” In Science, form and\r\nindividuality are never lost, thoughts are outlined, indi-\r\nvidualized ideas, which dwell forever in the divine Mind\r\nas tangible, true substance, because eternally conscious. [15]\r\nUnlike mortal mind, which must be ever in bondage,\r\nthe eternal Mind is free, unlimited, and knows not the\r\ntemporal.\r\n\r\nNeither does the temporal know the eternal. Mortal\r\nman, as mind or matter, is neither the pattern nor Maker [20]\r\nof immortal man. Any inference of the divine derived\r\nfrom the human, either as mind or body, hides the actual\r\npower, presence, and individuality of God.\r\n\r\nJesus’ personality in the flesh, so far as material sense\r\ncould discern it, was like that of other men; but Science [25]\r\nexchanges this human concept of Jesus for the divine\r\nideal, his spiritual individuality that reflected the Im-\r\nmanuel, or “God with us.” This God was not outlined.\r\nHe was too mighty for that. He was eternal Life, infinite\r\nTruth and Love. The individuality is embraced in Mind, [30]\r\ntherefore is forever with the Father. Hence the Scrip-\r\nture, “I am a God at hand, saith the Lord.” Even while\r\n\r\n[Page 104.]\r\n\r\nhis personality was on earth and in anguish, his individual [1]\r\nbeing, the Christ, was at rest in the eternal harmony.\r\nHis unseen individuality, so superior to that which was\r\nseen, was not subject to the temptations of the flesh, to\r\nlaws material, to death, or the grave. Formed and gov- [5]\r\nerned by God, this individuality was safe in the substance\r\nof Soul, the substance of Spirit,—yea, the substance of\r\nGod, the one inclusive good.\r\n\r\nIn Science all being is individual; for individuality is\r\nendless in the calculus of forms and numbers. Herein [10]\r\nsin is miraculous and supernatural; for it is not in the\r\nnature of God, and good is forever good. Accord-\r\ning to Christian Science, perfection is normal,—not\r\nmiraculous. Clothed, and in its right Mind, man’s\r\nindividuality is sinless, deathless, harmonious, eternal. [15]\r\nHis materiality, clad in a false mentality, wages feeble\r\nfight with his individuality,—his physical senses with\r\nhis spiritual senses. The latter move in God’s grooves\r\nof Science: the former revolve in their own orbits, and\r\nmust stand the friction of false selfhood until self- [20]\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the divine nature, man’s individuality\r\nreflects the divine law and order of being. How shall\r\nwe reach our true selves? Through Love. The Prin-\r\nciple of Christian Science is Love, and its idea represents [25]\r\nLove. This divine Principle and idea are demonstrated,\r\nin healing, to be God and the real man.\r\n\r\nWho wants to be mortal, or would not gain the true\r\nideal of Life and recover his own individuality? I will\r\nlove, if another hates. I will gain a balance on the side of [30]\r\ngood, my true being. This alone gives me the forces of\r\nGod wherewith to overcome all error. On this rests the\r\n\r\n[Page 105.]\r\n\r\nimplicit faith engendered by Christian Science, which [1]\r\nappeals intelligently to the facts of man’s spirituality, in-\r\ndividuality, to disdain the fears and destroy the discords\r\nof this material personality.\r\n\r\nOn our Master’s individual demonstrations over sin, [5]\r\nsickness, and death, rested the anathema of priesthood\r\nand the senses; yet this demonstration is the foundation\r\nof Christian Science. His physical sufferings, which\r\ncame from the testimony of the senses, were over when\r\nhe resumed his individual spiritual being, after showing [10]\r\nus the way to escape from the material body.\r\n\r\nScience would have no conflict with Life or common\r\nsense, if this sense were consistently sensible. Man’s real\r\nlife or existence is in harmony with Life and its glorious\r\nphenomena. It upholds being, and destroys the too [15]\r\ncommon sense of its opposites—death, disease, and sin.\r\nChristian Science is an everlasting victor, and vanquish-\r\nment is unknown to the omnipresent Truth. I must ever\r\nfollow this line of light and battle.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is my only ideal; and the individual [20]\r\nand his ideal can never be severed. If either is misunder-\r\nstood or maligned, it eclipses the other with the shadow\r\ncast by this error.\r\n\r\nTruth destroys error. Nothing appears to the physi-\r\ncal senses but their own subjective state of thought. The [25]\r\nsenses join issue with error, and pity what has no right\r\neither to be pitied or to exist, and what does not exist in\r\nScience. Destroy the thought of sin, sickness, death, and\r\nyou destroy their existence. “Whatsoever a man soweth,\r\nthat shall he also reap.” [30]\r\n\r\nBecause God is Mind, and this Mind is good, all\r\nis good and all is Mind. God is the sum total of the\r\n\r\n[Page 106.]\r\n\r\nuniverse. Then what and where are sin, sickness, and [1]\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nChristian Science and Christian Scientists will, _must_,\r\nhave a history; and if I could write the history in poor\r\nparody on Tennyson’s grand verse, it would read [5]\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    Traitors to right of them,\r\n    M. D.’s to left of them,\r\n    Priestcraft in front of them,\r\n      Volleyed and thundered! [10]\r\n    Into the jaws of hate,\r\n    Out through the door of Love,\r\n    On to the blest above,\r\n      Marched the one hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract From My First Address In The Mother Church, May 26, 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends and Brethren_:—Your Sunday Lesson, com-\r\nposed of Scripture and its correlative in “Science and\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures,” has fed you. In addi- [20]\r\ntion, I can only bring crumbs fallen from this table of\r\nTruth, and gather up the fragments.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a question of earnest import, How\r\nshall mankind worship the most adorable, but most\r\nunadored,—and where shall begin that praise that shall\r\nnever end? Beneath, above, beyond, methinks I hear [25]\r\nthe soft, sweet sigh of angels answering, “So live, that\r\nyour lives attest your sincerity and resound His praise.”\r\n\r\nMusic is the harmony of being; but the music of Soul\r\naffords the only strains that thrill the chords of feeling\r\nand awaken the heart’s harpstrings. Moved by mind, [30]\r\nyour many-throated organ, in imitative tones of many\r\n\r\n[Page 107.]\r\n\r\ninstruments, praises Him; but even the sweetness and [1]\r\nbeauty in and of this temple that praise Him, are earth’s\r\naccents, and must not be mistaken for the oracles of God.\r\nArt must not prevail over Science. Christianity is not\r\nsuperfluous. Its redemptive power is seen in sore trials, [5]\r\nself-denials, and crucifixions of the flesh. But these come\r\nto the rescue of mortals, to admonish them, and plant\r\nthe feet steadfastly in Christ. As we rise above the seem-\r\ning mists of sense, we behold more clearly that all the\r\nheart’s homage belongs to God. [10]\r\n\r\nMore love is the great need of mankind. A pure af-\r\nfection, concentric, forgetting self, forgiving wrongs and\r\nforestalling them, should swell the lyre of human love.\r\n\r\nThree cardinal points must be gained before poor\r\nhumanity is regenerated and Christian Science is dem- [15]\r\nonstrated: (1) A proper sense of sin; (2) repentance;\r\n(3) the understanding of good. Evil is a negation: it\r\nnever started with time, and it cannot keep pace with\r\neternity. Mortals’ false senses pass through three states\r\nand stages of human consciousness before yielding error. [20]\r\nThe deluded sense must first be shown its falsity through\r\na knowledge of evil as evil, so-called. Without a sense\r\nof one’s oft-repeated violations of divine law, the in-\r\ndividual may become morally blind, and this deplorable\r\nmental state is moral idiocy. The lack of seeing one’s [25]\r\ndeformed mentality, and of _repentance_ therefor, deep,\r\nnever to be repented of, is retarding, and in certain mor-\r\nbid instances stopping, the growth of Christian Scientists.\r\nWithout a knowledge of his sins, and repentance so severe\r\nthat it destroys them, no person is or can be a Christian [30]\r\nScientist.\r\n\r\nMankind thinks either too much or too little of sin.\r\n\r\n[Page 108.]\r\n\r\nThe sensitive, sorrowing saint thinks too much of it: the [1]\r\nsordid sinner, or the so-called Christian asleep, thinks too\r\nlittle of sin.\r\n\r\nTo allow sin of any sort is anomalous in Christian\r\nScientists, claiming, as they do, that good is infinite, All. [5]\r\nOur Master, in his definition of Satan as a liar from the\r\nbeginning, attested the absolute powerlessness—yea,\r\nnothingness—of evil: since a lie, being without founda-\r\ntion in fact, is merely a falsity; spiritually, literally, it\r\n_is nothing_. [10]\r\n\r\nNot to know that a false claim is false, is to be in danger\r\nof believing it; hence the utility of knowing evil aright,\r\nthen reducing its claim to its proper denominator,—\r\nnobody and nothing. Sin should be conceived of only\r\nas a delusion. This true conception would remove mortals’ [15]\r\nignorance and its consequences, and advance the second\r\nstage of human consciousness, repentance. The first\r\nstate, namely, the knowledge of one’s self, the proper\r\nknowledge of evil and its subtle workings wherein evil\r\nseems as real as good, is indispensable; since that which [20]\r\nis truly conceived of, we can handle; but the misconcep-\r\ntion of what we need to know of evil,—or the concep-\r\ntion of it at all as something real,—costs much. Sin\r\nneeds only to be known for what it is not; then we are\r\nits master, not servant. Remember, and act on, Jesus’ [25]\r\ndefinition of sin as a _lie_. This cognomen makes it less\r\ndangerous; for most of us would not be seen believing\r\nin, or adhering to, that which we know to be untrue.\r\nWhat would be thought of a Christian Scientist who be-\r\nlieved in the use of drugs, while declaring that they have [30]\r\nno intrinsic quality and that there is no matter? What\r\nshould be thought of an individual believing in that\r\n\r\n[Page 109.]\r\n\r\nwhich is untrue, and at the same time declaring the unity [1]\r\nof Truth, and its allness? Beware of those who mis-\r\nrepresent facts; or tacitly assent where they should dis-\r\nsent; or who take me as authority for what I disapprove,\r\nor mayhap never have thought of, and try to reverse, in- [5]\r\nvert, or controvert, Truth; for this is a sure pretext of\r\nmoral defilement.\r\n\r\nExamine yourselves, and see what, and how much, sin\r\nclaims of you; and how much of this claim you admit\r\nas valid, or comply with. The knowledge of evil that [10]\r\nbrings on repentance is the most hopeful stage of mortal\r\nmentality. Even a mild mistake must be seen as a mis-\r\ntake, in order to be corrected; how much more, then,\r\nshould one’s sins be seen and repented of, before they\r\ncan be reduced to their native nothingness! [15]\r\n\r\nIgnorance is only blest by reason of its nothingness;\r\nfor seeing the need of somethingness in its stead, blesses\r\nmortals. Ignorance was the first condition of sin in the\r\nallegory of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. Their\r\nmental state is not desirable, neither is a knowledge of [20]\r\nsin and its consequences, repentance, _per se_; but, ad-\r\nmitting the existence of both, mortals must hasten through\r\nthe second to the third stage,—the knowledge of good;\r\nfor without this the valuable sequence of knowledge\r\nwould be lacking,—even the power to escape from the [25]\r\nfalse claims of sin. To understand good, one must discern\r\nthe nothingness of evil, and consecrate one’s life anew.\r\n\r\nBeloved brethren, Christ, Truth, saith unto you, “Be\r\nnot afraid!”—fear not sin, lest thereby it master you;\r\nbut only _fear to sin_. Watch and pray for self-knowledge; [30]\r\nsince then, and thus, cometh repentance,—and your\r\nsuperiority to a delusion is won.\r\n\r\n[Page 110.]\r\n\r\nRepentance is better than sacrifice. The costly balm [1]\r\nof Araby, poured on our Master’s feet, had not the value\r\nof a single _tear_.\r\n\r\nBeloved children, the world has need of you,—and\r\nmore as children than as men and women: it needs your [5]\r\ninnocence, unselfishness, faithful affection, uncontami-\r\nnated lives. You need also to watch, and pray that you\r\npreserve these virtues unstained, and lose them not through\r\ncontact with the world. What grander ambition is there\r\nthan to maintain in yourselves what Jesus loved, and to [10]\r\nknow that your example, more than words, makes morals\r\nfor mankind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before The Alumni Of The Massachusetts Metaphysical College, 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Students_:—Weeks have passed into [15]\r\nmonths, and months into years, since last we met; but\r\ntime and space, when encompassed by divine presence,\r\ndo not separate us. Our hearts have kept time together,\r\nand our hands have wrought steadfastly at the same\r\nobject-lesson, while leagues have lain between us. [20]\r\n\r\nWe may well unite in thanksgiving for the continued\r\nprogress and unprecedented prosperity of our Cause. It\r\nis already obvious that the world’s acceptance and the\r\nmomentum of Christian Science, increase rapidly as\r\nyears glide on. [25]\r\n\r\nAs Christian Scientists, you have dared the perilous de-\r\nfense of Truth, and have succeeded. You have learned\r\nhow fleeting is that which men call great; and how per-\r\nmanent that which God calls good.\r\n\r\n[Page 111.]\r\n\r\nYou have proven that the greatest piety is scarcely [1]\r\nsufficient to demonstrate what you have adopted and\r\ntaught; that your work, well done, would dignify angels.\r\n\r\nFaithfully, as meekly, you have toiled all night; and\r\nat break of day caught much. At times, your net has [5]\r\nbeen so full that it broke: human pride, creeping into\r\nits meshes, extended it beyond safe expansion; then,\r\nlosing hold of divine Love, you lost your fishes, and pos-\r\nsibly blamed others more than yourself. But those whom\r\nGod makes “fishers of men” will not pull for the shore; [10]\r\nlike Peter, they launch into the depths, cast their nets\r\non the right side, compensate loss, and gain a higher sense\r\nof the true idea. Nothing is lost that God gives: had He\r\nfilled the net, it would not have broken.\r\n\r\nLeaving the seed of Truth to its own vitality, it propa- [15]\r\ngates: the tares cannot hinder it. Our Master said,\r\n“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall\r\nnot pass away;” and Jesus’ faith in Truth must not ex-\r\nceed that of Christian Scientists who prove its power to\r\nbe immortal. [20]\r\n\r\nThe Christianity that is merely of sects, the pulpit, and\r\nfashionable society, is brief; but the Word of God abideth.\r\nPlato was a pagan; but no greater difference existed be-\r\ntween his doctrines and those of Jesus, than to-day exists\r\nbetween the Catholic and Protestant sects. I love the [25]\r\northodox church; and, in time, that church will love\r\nChristian Science. Let me specially call the attention of\r\nthis Association to the following false beliefs inclining\r\nmortal mind more deviously:—\r\n\r\nThe belief in anti-Christ: that somebody in the flesh [30]\r\nis the son of God, or is another Christ, or is a spiritually\r\nadopted child, or is an incarnated babe, is the evil one—\r\n\r\n[Page 112.]\r\n\r\nin other words, the one evil—disporting itself with the [1]\r\nsubtleties of sin!\r\n\r\nEven honest thinkers, not knowing whence they come,\r\nmay deem these delusions verities, before they know it,\r\nor really look the illusions in the face. The ages are bur- [5]\r\ndened with material modes. Hypnotism, microbes, X-rays,\r\nand ex-common sense, occupy time and thought; and\r\nerror, given new opportunities, will improve them. The\r\nmost just man can neither defend the innocent nor detect\r\nthe guilty, unless he knows _how_ to be just; and this knowl- [10]\r\nedge demands our time and attention.\r\n\r\nThe mental stages of crime, which seem to belong to\r\nthe latter days, are strictly classified in metaphysics as\r\nsome of the many features and forms of what is properly\r\ndenominated, in extreme cases, moral idiocy. I visited [15]\r\nin his cell the assassin of President Garfield, and found\r\nhim in the mental state called moral idiocy. He had no\r\nsense of his crime; but regarded his act as one of simple\r\njustice, and himself as the victim. My few words touched\r\nhim; he sank back in his chair, limp and pale; his flip- [20]\r\npancy had fled. The jailer thanked me, and said, “Other\r\nvisitors have brought to him bouquets, but you have\r\nbrought what will do him good.”\r\n\r\nThis mental disease at first shows itself in extreme\r\nsensitiveness; then, in a loss of self-knowledge and of [25]\r\nself-condemnation,—a shocking inability to see one’s\r\nown faults, but an exaggerating sense of other people’s.\r\nUnless this mental condition be overcome, it ends in a\r\ntotal loss of moral, intellectual, and spiritual discernment,\r\nand is characterized in this Scripture: “The fool hath [30]\r\nsaid in his heart, There is no God.” This state of mind\r\nis the exemplification of total depravity, and the result\r\n\r\n[Page 113.]\r\n\r\nof sensuous mind in matter. Mind that is God is not in [1]\r\nmatter; and God’s presence gives spiritual light, wherein\r\nis no darkness.\r\n\r\nIf, as is indisputably true, “God is Spirit,” and Spirit\r\nis our Father and Mother, and that which it includes is [5]\r\nall that is real and eternal, when evil seems to predomi-\r\nnate and divine light to be obscured, free moral agency\r\nis lost; and the Revelator’s vision, that “no man might\r\nbuy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the\r\nbeast, or the number of his name,” is imminent. [10]\r\n\r\nWhoever is mentally manipulating human mind, and\r\nis not gaining a higher sense of Truth by it, is losing in\r\nthe scale of moral and spiritual being, and may be car-\r\nried to the depths of perdition by his own consent. He\r\nwho refuses to be influenced by any but the divine Mind, [15]\r\ncommits his way to God, and rises superior to sugges-\r\ntions from an evil source. Christian Science shows that\r\nthere is a way of escape from the latter-day ultimatum\r\nof evil, through scientific truth; so that all are without\r\nexcuse. [20]\r\n\r\nAlready I clearly recognize that mental malpractice,\r\nif persisted in, will end in insanity, dementia, or moral\r\nidiocy. Thank God! this evil can be resisted by true\r\nChristianity. Divine Love is our hope, strength, and\r\nshield. We have nothing to fear when Love is at the [25]\r\nhelm of thought, but everything to enjoy on earth and\r\nin heaven.\r\n\r\nThe systematized centres of Christian Science are life-\r\ngiving fountains of truth. Our churches, _The Christian_\r\n_Science Journal_, and the _Christian Science Quarterly_, [30]\r\nare prolific sources of spiritual power whose intellectual,\r\nmoral, and spiritual animus is felt throughout the land.\r\n\r\n[Page 114.]\r\n\r\nOur Publishing Society, and our Sunday Lessons, are [1]\r\nof inestimable value to all seekers after Truth. The Com-\r\nmittee on Sunday School Lessons cannot give too much\r\ntime and attention to their task, and should spare no\r\nresearch in the preparation of the _Quarterly_ as an educa- [5]\r\ntional branch.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of Christian Science need to watch inces-\r\nsantly the trend of their own thoughts; watch that these\r\nbe not secretly robbed, and themselves misguided, and\r\nso made to misteach others. Teachers must conform [10]\r\nstrictly to the rules of divine Science announced in the\r\nBible and their textbook, “Science and Health with Key\r\nto the Scriptures.” They must themselves practise, and\r\nteach others to practise, the Hebrew Decalogue, the Ser-\r\nmon on the Mount, and the understanding and enuncia- [15]\r\ntion of these according to Christ.\r\n\r\nThey must always have on armor, and resist the foe\r\nwithin and without. They cannot arm too thoroughly\r\nagainst original sin, appearing in its myriad forms: pass-\r\nsion, appetites, hatred, revenge, and all the _et cetera_ of [20]\r\nevil. Christian Scientists cannot watch too sedulously,\r\nor bar their doors too closely, or pray to God too fer-\r\nvently, for deliverance from the claims of evil. Thus\r\ndoing, Scientists will silence evil suggestions, uncover\r\ntheir methods, and stop their hidden influence upon the [25]\r\nlives of mortals. Rest assured that God in His wisdom\r\nwill test all mankind on all questions; and then, if found\r\nfaithful, He will deliver us from temptation and show us\r\nthe powerlessness of evil,—even its utter nothingness.\r\n\r\nThe teacher in Christian Science who does not spe- [30]\r\ncially instruct his pupils how to guard against evil and\r\nits silent modes, and to be able, through Christ, the liv-\r\n\r\n[Page 115.]\r\n\r\ning Truth, to protect themselves therefrom, is commit- [1]\r\nting an offense against God and humanity. With Science\r\nand Health for their textbook, I am astounded at the\r\napathy of some students on the subject of sin and mental\r\nmalpractice, and their culpable ignorance of the work- [5]\r\ning of these—and even the teacher’s own deficiency in\r\nthis department. I can account for this state of mind in\r\nthe teacher only as the result of sin; otherwise, his own\r\nguilt as a mental malpractitioner, and fear of being found\r\nout. [10]\r\n\r\nThe helpless ignorance of the community on this sub-\r\nject is pitiable, and plain to be seen. May God enable\r\nmy students to take up the cross as I have done, and meet\r\nthe pressing need of a proper preparation of heart to prac-\r\ntise, teach, and live Christian Science! Your means of [15]\r\nprotection and defense from sin are, constant watchful-\r\nness and prayer that you enter not into temptation and\r\nare delivered from every claim of evil, till you intelligently\r\nknow and demonstrate, in Science, that evil has neither\r\nprestige, power, nor existence, since God, good, is All- [20]\r\nin-all.\r\n\r\nThe increasing necessity for relying on God to de-\r\nfend us against the subtler forms of evil, turns us more\r\nunreservedly to Him for help, and thus becomes a means\r\nof grace. If one lives rightly, every effort to hurt one [25]\r\nwill only help that one; for God will give the ability to\r\novercome whatever tends to impede progress. Know\r\nthis: that you cannot overcome the baneful effects of\r\nsin on yourself, if you in any way indulge in sin; for,\r\nsooner or later, you will fall the victim of your own as [30]\r\nwell as of others’ sins. Using mental power in the right\r\ndirection only, doing to others as you would have them\r\n\r\n[Page 116.]\r\n\r\ndo to you, will overcome evil with good, and destroy [1]\r\nyour own sensitiveness to the power of evil.\r\n\r\nThe God of all grace be with you, and save you from\r\n“spiritual wickedness in high places.”\r\n\r\nPLEASANT VIEW, CONCORD, N. H., [5]\r\nJune 3, 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress Before The Christian Scientist Association Of The Massachusetts\r\nMetaphysical College, In 1893\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: _Obedience_ [10]\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Students_:—This question, ever nearest\r\nto my heart, is to-day uppermost: Are we filling the\r\nmeasures of life’s music aright, emphasizing its grand\r\nstrains, swelling the harmony of being with tones whence\r\ncome glad echoes? As _crescendo_ and _diminuendo_ accent [15]\r\nmusic, so the varied strains of human chords express\r\nlife’s loss or gain,—loss of the pleasures and pains and\r\npride of life: gain of its sweet concord, the courage of\r\nhonest convictions, and final obedience to spiritual law.\r\nThe ultimate of scientific research and attainment in [20]\r\ndivine Science is not an argument: it is not merely say-\r\ning, but doing, the Word—demonstrating Truth—even\r\nas the fruits of watchfulness, prayer, struggles, tears, and\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nObeying the divine Principle which you profess to un- [25]\r\nderstand and love, demonstrates Truth. Never absent\r\nfrom your post, never off guard, never ill-humored, never\r\nunready to work for God,—is obedience; being “faith-\r\nful over a few things.” If in one instance obedience be\r\nlacking, you lose the scientific rule and its reward: namely, [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 117.]\r\n\r\nto be made “ruler over many things.” A progressive [1]\r\nlife is the reality of Life that unfolds its immortal Prin-\r\nciple.\r\n\r\nThe student of Christian Science must first separate the\r\ntares from the wheat; discern between the thought, [5]\r\nmotive, and act superinduced by the wrong motive or\r\nthe true—the God-given intent and volition—arrest\r\nthe former, and obey the latter. This will place him on\r\nthe safe side of practice. We always know where to look\r\nfor the real Scientist, and always find him there. I agree [10]\r\nwith Rev. Dr. Talmage, that “there are wit, humor, and\r\nenduring vivacity among God’s people.”\r\n\r\nObedience is the offspring of Love; and Love is the\r\nPrinciple of unity, the basis of all right thinking and\r\nacting; it fulfils the law. We see eye to eye and know as we [15]\r\nare known, reciprocate kindness and work wisely, in\r\nproportion as we love.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to carry out a divine commission\r\nwhile participating in the movements, or _modus operandi_,\r\nof other folks. To point out every step to a student and [20]\r\nthen watch that each step be taken, consumes time,—\r\nand experiments ofttimes are costly. According to my\r\ncalendar, God’s time and mortals’ differ. The neo-\r\nphyte is inclined to be too fast or too slow: he works\r\nsomewhat in the dark; and, sometimes out of season, [25]\r\nhe would replenish his lamp at the midnight hour and\r\nborrow oil of the more provident watcher. God is the\r\nfountain of light, and He illumines one’s way when one\r\nis obedient. The disobedient make their moves before\r\nGod makes His, or make them too late to follow Him. [30]\r\nBe sure that God _directs_ your way; then, hasten to follow\r\nunder every circumstance.\r\n\r\n[Page 118.]\r\n\r\nHuman will must be subjugated. We cannot obey [1]\r\nboth God, good, and evil,—in other words, the ma-\r\nterial senses, false suggestions, self-will, selfish motives,\r\nand human policy. We shall have no faith in evil\r\nwhen faith finds a resting-place and scientific under- [5]\r\nstanding guides man. Honesty in every condition,\r\nunder every circumstance, is the indispensable rule of\r\nobedience. To obey the principle of mathematics ninety-\r\nnine times in one hundred and then allow one numeral\r\nto make incorrect your entire problem, is neither Science [10]\r\nnor obedience.\r\n\r\nHowever keenly the human affections yearn to for-\r\ngive a mistake, and pass a friend over it smoothly, one’s\r\nsympathy can neither atone for error, advance individual\r\ngrowth, nor change this immutable decree of Love: “Keep [15]\r\nMy commandments.” The guerdon of meritorious\r\nfaith or trustworthiness rests on being willing to work\r\nalone with God and for Him,—willing to suffer patiently\r\nfor error until all error is destroyed and His rod and His\r\nstaff comfort you. [20]\r\n\r\nSelf-ignorance, self-will, self-righteousness, lust, covet-\r\nousness, envy, revenge, are foes to grace, peace, and\r\nprogress; they must be met manfully and overcome,\r\nor they will uproot all happiness. Be of good cheer;\r\nthe warfare with one’s self is grand; it gives one plenty [25]\r\nof employment, and the divine Principle worketh with\r\nyou,—and obedience crowns persistent effort with\r\neverlasting victory. Every attempt of evil to harm good\r\nis futile, and ends in the fiery punishment of the\r\nevil-doer. [30]\r\n\r\nJesus said, “Not that which goeth into the mouth\r\ndefileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth,\r\n\r\n[Page 119.]\r\n\r\nthis defileth a man.” If malicious suggestions whisper [1]\r\nevil through the mind’s tympanum, this were no apology\r\nfor acting evilly. We are responsible for our thoughts and\r\nacts; and instead of aiding other people’s devices by\r\nobeying them,—and then whining over misfortune,— [5]\r\nrise and overthrow both. If a criminal coax the unwary\r\nman to commit a crime, our laws punish the dupe as ac-\r\ncessory to the fact. Each individual is responsible for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nEvil is impotent to turn the righteous man from his [10]\r\nuprightness. The nature of the individual, more stub-\r\nborn than the circumstance, will always be found argu-\r\ning for itself,—its habits, tastes, and indulgences. This\r\nmaterial nature strives to tip the beam against the spir-\r\nitual nature; for the flesh strives against Spirit,—against [15]\r\nwhatever or whoever opposes evil,—and weighs mightily\r\nin the scale against man’s high destiny. This conclusion\r\nis not an argument either for pessimism or for optimism,\r\nbut is a plea for free moral agency,—full exemption\r\nfrom all necessity to obey a power that should be and is [20]\r\nfound powerless in Christian Science.\r\n\r\nInsubordination to the law of Love even in the least,\r\nor strict obedience thereto, tests and discriminates be-\r\ntween the real and the unreal Scientist. Justice, a\r\nprominent statute in the divine law, demands of all [25]\r\ntrespassers upon the sparse individual rights which one\r\njustly reserves to one’s self,—Would you consent that\r\nothers should tear up your landmarks, manipulate your\r\nstudents, nullify or reverse your rules, countermand\r\nyour orders, steal your possessions, and escape the [30]\r\npenalty therefor? No! “Therefore all things what-\r\nsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even\r\n\r\n[Page 120.]\r\n\r\nso to them.” The professors of Christian Science must [1]\r\ntake off their shoes at our altars; they must unclasp\r\nthe material sense of things at the very threshold of\r\nChristian Science: they must obey implicitly each and\r\nevery injunction of the divine Principle of life’s long [5]\r\nproblem, or repeat their work in tears. In the words\r\nof St. Paul, “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your-\r\nselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye\r\nobey; whether of sin unto death, or of _obedience_ unto\r\nrighteousness?” [10]\r\n\r\nBeloved students, loyal laborers are ye that have wrought\r\nvaliantly, and achieved great guerdons in the vineyard\r\nof our Lord; but a mighty victory is yet to be won, a\r\ngreat freedom for the race; and Christian success is\r\nunder arms,—with armor on, not laid down. Let us [15]\r\nrejoice, however, that the clarion call of peace will at\r\nlength be heard above the din of battle, and come more\r\nsweetly to our ear than sound of vintage bells to villagers\r\non the Rhine.\r\n\r\nI recommend that this Association hereafter meet tri- [20]\r\nennially; many of its members reside a long distance from\r\nMassachusetts, and they are members of The Mother\r\nChurch who would love to be with you on Sunday, and\r\nonce in three years is perhaps as often as they can afford\r\nto be away from their own fields of labor. [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunion Address, January, 1896\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends and Brethren:_—The Biblical record of the\r\ngreat Nazarene, whose character we to-day commemorate,\r\nis scanty; but what is given, puts to flight every doubt as\r\nto the immortality of his words and works. Though [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 121.]\r\n\r\nwritten in a decaying language, his words can never pass [1]\r\naway: they are inscribed upon the hearts of men: they\r\nare engraved upon eternity’s tablets.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly our Master partook of the Jews’ feast\r\nof the Passover, and drank from their festal wine-cup. [5]\r\nThis, however, is not the cup to which I call your at-\r\ntention,—even the cup of martyrdom: wherein Spirit\r\nand matter, good and evil, seem to grapple, and the\r\nhuman struggles against the divine, up to a point of\r\ndiscovery; namely, the impotence of evil, and the om- [10]\r\nnipotence of good, as divinely attested. Anciently, the\r\nblood of martyrs was believed to be the seed of the Church.\r\nStalled theocracy would make this fatal doctrine just\r\nand sovereign, even a divine decree, a law of Love! That\r\nthe innocent shall suffer for the guilty, is inhuman. The [15]\r\nprophet declared, “Thou shalt put away the guilt of\r\ninnocent blood from Israel.” This is plain: that what-\r\never belittles, befogs, or belies the nature and essence of\r\nDeity, is not divine. Who, then, shall father or favor\r\nthis sentence passed upon innocence? thereby giving the [20]\r\nsignet of God to the arrest, trial, and crucifixion of His\r\nbeloved Son, the righteous Nazarene,—christened by\r\nJohn the Baptist, “the Lamb of God.”\r\n\r\nOh! shameless insult to divine royalty, that drew\r\nfrom the great Master this answer to the questions of the [25]\r\nrabbinical rabble: “If I tell you, ye will not believe; and\r\nif I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.”\r\n\r\nInfinitely greater than human pity, is divine Love,—\r\nthat cannot be unmerciful. Human tribunals, if just,\r\nborrow their sense of justice from the divine Principle [30]\r\nthereof, which punishes the guilty, not the innocent. The\r\nTeacher of both law and gospel construed the substitution\r\n\r\n[Page 122.]\r\n\r\nof a good man to suffer for evil-doers—a _crime_! When [1]\r\nforetelling his own crucifixion, he said, “Woe unto the\r\nworld because of offenses! for it must needs be that\r\noffenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense\r\ncometh!” [5]\r\n\r\nWould Jesus thus have spoken of what was indis-\r\npensable for the salvation of a world of sinners, or of the\r\nindividual instrument in this holy (?) alliance for accom-\r\nplishing such a monstrous work? or have said of him\r\nwhom God foreordained and predestined to fulfil a divine [10]\r\ndecree, “It were better for him that a millstone were\r\nhanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the\r\ndepth of the sea”?\r\n\r\nThe divine order is the acme of mercy: it is neither\r\nquestionable nor assailable: it is not evil producing good, [15]\r\nnor good ultimating in evil. Such an inference were\r\nimpious. Holy Writ denounces him that declares, “Let\r\nus do evil, that good may come! whose damnation is\r\njust.”\r\n\r\nGood is not educed from its opposite: and Love divine [20]\r\nspurned, lessens not the hater’s hatred nor the criminal’s\r\ncrime; nor reconciles justice to injustice; nor substitutes\r\nthe suffering of the Godlike for the suffering due to sin.\r\nNeither spiritual bankruptcy nor a religious chancery can\r\nwin high heaven, or the “Well done, good and faithful [25]\r\nservant,... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.”\r\n\r\nDivine Love knows no hate; for hate, or the hater, is\r\nnothing: God never made it, and He made all that was\r\nmade. The hater’s pleasures are unreal; his sufferings,\r\nself-imposed; his existence is a parody, and he ends— [30]\r\nwith suicide.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the just Nazarite was incited by the\r\n\r\n[Page 123.]\r\n\r\nsame spirit that in our time massacres our missionaries, [1]\r\nbutchers the helpless Armenians, slaughters innocents.\r\nEvil was, and is, the illusion of breaking the First Com-\r\nmandment, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me:”\r\nit is either idolizing something and somebody, or hating [5]\r\nthem: it is the spirit of idolatry, envy, jealousy, covet-\r\nousness, superstition, lust, hypocrisy, _witchcraft_.\r\n\r\nThat man can break the forever-law of infinite Love,\r\nwas, and is, the serpent’s biggest lie! and ultimates in\r\na religion of pagan priests bloated with crime; a religion [10]\r\nthat demands human victims to be sacrificed to human\r\npassions and human gods, or tortured to appease the\r\nanger of a so-called god or a miscalled man or woman!\r\nThe Assyrian Merodach, or the god of sin, was the “lucky\r\ngod;” and the Babylonian Yawa, or Jehovah, was the [15]\r\nJewish tribal deity. The _Christian’s_ God is neither, and\r\nis too pure to behold iniquity.\r\n\r\nDivine Science has rolled away the stone from the sepul-\r\nchre of our Lord; and there has risen to the awakened\r\nthought the majestic atonement of divine Love. The [20]\r\nat-one-ment with Christ has appeared—not through\r\nvicarious suffering, whereby the just obtain a pardon for\r\nthe unjust,—but through the eternal law of justice;\r\nwherein sinners suffer for their own sins, repent, forsake\r\nsin, love God, and keep His commandments, thence to [25]\r\nreceive the reward of righteousness: salvation from sin,\r\nnot through the _death_ of a man, but through a divine _Life_,\r\nwhich is our Redeemer.\r\n\r\nHoly Writ declares that God is Love, is Spirit; hence\r\nit follows that those who worship Him, must worship [30]\r\nHim spiritually,—far apart from physical sensation\r\nsuch as attends eating and drinking corporeally. It is\r\n\r\n[Page 124.]\r\n\r\nplain that aught unspiritual, intervening between God [1]\r\nand man, would tend to disturb the divine order, and\r\ncountermand the Scripture that those who worship the\r\nFather must worship Him in spirit. It is also plain,\r\nthat we should not seek and cannot find God in mat- [5]\r\nter, or through material methods; neither do we love\r\nand obey Him by means of matter, or the flesh,—which\r\nwarreth against Spirit, and will not be reconciled\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nWe turn, with sickened sense, from a pagan Jew’s [10]\r\nor Moslem’s misconception of Deity, for peace; and find\r\nrest in the spiritual ideal, or Christ. For “who is so\r\ngreat a God as our God!” unchangeable, all-wise, all-\r\njust, all-merciful; the ever-loving, ever-living Life, Truth,\r\nLove: comforting such as mourn, opening the prison [15]\r\ndoors to the captive, marking the unwinged bird, pitying\r\nwith more than a father’s pity; healing the sick, cleansing\r\nthe leper, raising the dead, saving sinners. As we think\r\nthereon, man’s true sense is filled with peace, and power;\r\nand we say, It is well that Christian Science has taken [20]\r\nexpressive silence wherein to muse His praise, to kiss the\r\nfeet of Jesus, adore the white Christ, and stretch out our\r\narms to God.\r\n\r\nThe last act of the tragedy on Calvary rent the veil\r\nof matter, and unveiled Love’s great legacy to mortals: [25]\r\n_Love forgiving its enemies_. This grand act crowned\r\nand still crowns Christianity: it manumits mortals; it\r\ntranslates love; it gives to suffering, inspiration; to\r\npatience, experience; to experience, hope; to hope, faith;\r\nto faith, understanding; and to understanding, Love tri- [30]\r\numphant!\r\n\r\nIn proportion to a man’s spiritual progress, he will\r\n\r\n[Page 125.]\r\n\r\nindeed drink of our Master’s cup, and be baptized with [1]\r\nhis baptism! be purified as by fire,—the fires of suffering;\r\nthen hath he part in Love’s atonement, for “whom the\r\nLord loveth He chasteneth.” Then shall he also reign\r\nwith him: he shall rise to know that there is no sin, [5]\r\nthat there is no suffering; since all that is _real_ is _right_.\r\nThis knowledge enables him to overcome the world, the\r\nflesh, and all evil, to have dominion over his own sinful\r\nsense and self. Then shall he drink anew Christ’s cup,\r\nin the kingdom of God—the reign of righteousness— [10]\r\nwithin him; he shall sit down at the Father’s right hand:\r\n_sit down_; not stand waiting and weary; but rest on the\r\nbosom of God; rest, in the understanding of divine Love\r\nthat passeth all understanding; rest, in that which “to\r\nknow aright is Life eternal,” and whom, not having seen, [15]\r\nwe love.\r\n\r\nThen shall he press on to Life’s long lesson, the eternal\r\nlore of Love; and learn forever the infinite meanings of\r\nthese short sentences: “God is Love;” and, All that is\r\nreal is divine, for God is All-in-all. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessage To The Annual Meeting Of The Mother Church, Boston, 1896\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Brethren, Children, and Grandchildren_:—\r\nApart from the common walks of mankind, revolving\r\noft the hitherto untouched problems of being, and [25]\r\noftener, perhaps, the controversies which baffle it,\r\nMother, thought-tired, turns to-day to you; turns to\r\nher dear church, to tell the towers thereof the remarkable\r\nachievements that have been ours within the past few\r\nyears: the rapid transit from halls to churches, from un- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 126.]\r\n\r\nsettled questions to permanence, from danger to escape, [1]\r\nfrom fragmentary discourses to one eternal sermon; yea,\r\nfrom darkness to daylight, in physics and metaphysics.\r\n\r\nTruly, I half wish for society again; for once, at least,\r\nto hear the soft music of our Sabbath chimes saluting the [5]\r\near in tones that leap for joy, with love for God and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWho hath not learned that when alone he has his\r\nown thoughts to guard, and when struggling with man-\r\nkind his temper, and in society his tongue? We also [10]\r\nhave gained higher heights; have learned that trials lift\r\nus to that dignity of Soul which sustains us, and finally\r\nconquers them; and that the ordeal refines while it\r\nchastens.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our church is not yet quite sensible of what [15]\r\nwe owe to the strength, meekness, honesty, and obedi-\r\nence of the Christian Science Board of Directors; to\r\nthe able editors of _The Christian Science Journal_, and\r\nto our efficient Publishing Society.\r\n\r\nNo reproof is so potent as the silent lesson of a good [20]\r\nexample. Works, more than words, should characterize\r\nChristian Scientists. Most people condemn evil-doing,\r\nevil-speaking; yet nothing circulates so rapidly: even gold\r\nis less current. Christian Scientists have a strong race to\r\nrun, and foes in ambush; but bear in mind that, in the [25]\r\nlong race, honesty always defeats dishonesty.\r\n\r\nGod hath indeed smiled on my church,—this\r\ndaughter of Zion: she sitteth in high places; and to de-\r\nride her is to incur the penalty of which the Hebrew\r\nbard spake after this manner: “He that sitteth in the [30]\r\nheavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in\r\nderision.”\r\n\r\n[Page 127.]\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have observed that in proportion as this [1]\r\nchurch has smiled on His “little ones,” He has blessed\r\nher. Throughout my entire connection with The Mother\r\nChurch, I have seen, that in the ratio of her love for\r\nothers, hath His love been bestowed upon her; watering [5]\r\nher waste places, and enlarging her borders.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have greatly desired, and again earnestly\r\nrequest, namely, that Christian Scientists, here and\r\nelsewhere, pray daily for themselves; not verbally, nor\r\non bended knee, but mentally, meekly, and importu- [10]\r\nnately. When a hungry heart petitions the divine Father-\r\nMother God for bread, it is not given a stone,—but\r\nmore grace, obedience, and love. If this heart, humble\r\nand trustful, faithfully asks divine Love to feed it with the\r\nbread of heaven, health, holiness, it will be conformed to [15]\r\na fitness to receive the answer to its desire; then will flow\r\ninto it the “river of His pleasure,” the tributary of divine\r\nLove, and great growth in Christian Science will follow,—\r\neven that joy which finds one’s own in another’s good.\r\n\r\nTo love, and to be loved, one must do good to others. [20]\r\nThe inevitable condition whereby to become blessed, is to\r\nbless others: but here, you must so know yourself, under\r\nGod’s direction, that you will do His will even though\r\nyour pearls be downtrodden. Ofttimes the rod is His\r\nmeans of grace; then it must be ours,—we cannot avoid [25]\r\nwielding it if we reflect Him.\r\n\r\nWise sayings and garrulous talk may fall to the ground,\r\nrather than on the ear or heart of the hearer; but a tender\r\nsentiment felt, or a kind word spoken, at the right moment,\r\nis never wasted. Mortal mind presents phases of charac- [30]\r\nter which need close attention and examination. The\r\nhuman heart, like a feather bed, needs often to be _stirred_,\r\n\r\n[Page 128.]\r\n\r\nsometimes roughly, and given a variety of _turns_, else it [1]\r\ngrows hard and uncomfortable whereon to repose.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of this so-called life in matter are too vast\r\nand varied to learn or to teach briefly; and especially\r\nwithin the limits of a letter. Therefore I close here, [5]\r\nwith the apostle’s injunction: “Finally, brethren, what-\r\nsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,\r\nwhatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,\r\nwhatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of\r\ngood report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any [10]\r\npraise, think on these things. Those things, which ye\r\nhave both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in\r\nme, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.”\r\n\r\nWith love, Mother,\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 129.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Mother Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Beloved Brethren:—If a member of the church\r\nis inclined to be uncharitable, or to condemn his\r\nbrother without cause, let him put his finger to his lips,\r\nand forgive others as he would _be_ forgiven. One’s first [5]\r\nlesson is to learn one’s self; having done this, one will\r\nnaturally, through grace from God, forgive his brother and\r\nlove his enemies. To avenge an imaginary or an actual\r\nwrong, is suicidal. The law of our God and the rule of\r\nour church is to tell thy brother his fault and thereby help [10]\r\nhim. If this rule fails in effect, then take the next Scrip-\r\ntural step: drop this member’s name from the church, and\r\nthereafter “let the dead bury their dead,”—let silence\r\nprevail over his remains.\r\n\r\nIf a man is jealous, envious, or revengeful, he will seek [15]\r\noccasion to balloon an atom of another man’s indis-\r\ncretion, inflate it, and send it into the atmosphere of mortal\r\nmind—for other green eyes to gaze on: he will always\r\nfind somebody in his way, and try to push him aside;\r\nwill see somebody’s faults to magnify under the lens that [20]\r\nhe never turns on himself.\r\n\r\nWhat have been your Leader’s precepts and example!\r\nWere they to save the sinner, and to spare his exposure\r\n\r\n[Page 130.]\r\n\r\nso long as a hope remained of thereby benefiting him? [1]\r\n\r\nHas her life exemplified long-suffering, meekness, charity,\r\npurity?\r\n\r\nShe readily leaves the answer to those who know\r\nher. [5]\r\n\r\nDo we yet understand how much better it is to be\r\nwronged, than to commit wrong? What do we find in\r\nthe Bible, and in the Christian Science textbook, on this\r\nsubject? Does not the latter instruct you that looking\r\ncontinually for a fault in somebody else, talking about it, [10]\r\nthinking it over, and how to meet it,—“rolling sin as a\r\nsweet morsel under your tongue,”—has the same power\r\nto make you a sinner that acting thus regarding disease\r\nhas to make a man sick? Note the Scripture on this\r\nsubject: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the [15]\r\nLord.”\r\n\r\nThe Christian Science Board of Directors has borne\r\nthe burden in the heat of the day, and it ought not to\r\nbe expected that they could have accomplished, without\r\none single mistake, such Herculean tasks as they have [20]\r\naccomplished. He who judges others should know well\r\nwhereof he speaks. Where the motive to do right exists,\r\nand the majority of one’s acts are right, we should avoid\r\nreferring to past mistakes. The greatest sin that one can\r\ncommit against himself is to wrong one of God’s “little [25]\r\nones.”\r\n\r\nKnow ye not that he who exercises the largest charity,\r\nand waits on God, renews his strength, and is exalted?\r\nLove is not puffed up; and the meek and loving, God\r\nanoints and appoints to lead the line of mankind’s tri- [30]\r\numphal march out of the wilderness, out of darkness\r\ninto light.\r\n\r\n[Page 131.]\r\n\r\nWhoever challenges the errors of others and cherishes [1]\r\nhis own, can neither help himself nor others; he will be\r\ncalled a moral nuisance, a fungus, a microbe, a mouse\r\ngnawing at the vitals of humanity. The darkness in\r\none’s self must first be cast out, in order rightly to discern [5]\r\ndarkness or to reflect light.\r\n\r\nIf the man of more than average avoirdupois kneels on\r\na stool in church, let the leaner sort console this brother’s\r\nnecessity by doing likewise. Christian Scientists preserve\r\nunity, and so shadow forth the substance of our sublime [10]\r\nfaith, and the evidence of its being built upon the rock of\r\ndivine oneness,—one faith, one God, one baptism.\r\n\r\nIf our Board of Directors is prepared to itemize a report\r\nof the first financial year since the erection of the edifice of\r\nThe First Church of Christ, Scientist, let it do so; other- [15]\r\nwise, I recommend that you waive the church By-law\r\nrelating to finances this year of your firstfruits. This\r\nBoard did not act under that By-law; it was not in ex-\r\nistence all of the year. It is but just to consider the great\r\nstruggles with perplexities and difficulties which the [20]\r\nDirectors encountered in Anno Domini 1894, and which\r\nthey have overcome. May God give unto us all that loving\r\nsense of gratitude which delights in the opportunity to\r\ncancel accounts. I, for one, would be pleased to have the\r\nChristian Science Board of Directors itemize a bill of this [25]\r\nchurch’s gifts to Mother; and then to have them let her\r\nstate the value thereof, if, indeed, it could be estimated.\r\n\r\nAfter this financial year, when you call on the members\r\nof the Christian Science Board of Directors to itemize or\r\naudit their accounts, these will be found already itemized, [30]\r\nand last year’s records immortalized, with perils past and\r\nvictories won.\r\n\r\n[Page 132.]\r\n\r\nA motion was made, and a vote passed, at your last [1]\r\nmeeting, on a subject the substance whereof you had al-\r\nready accepted as a By-law. But, I shall take this as a\r\nfavorable omen, a fair token that heavy lids are opening,\r\neven wider than before, to the light of Love—and By-laws. [5]\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ——, On Prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE,\r\n571 COLUMBUS AVENUE, [10]\r\nBOSTON, March 21, 1885\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_:—In your communication to _Zion’s Herald_,\r\nMarch 18, under the heading, “Prayer and Healing; sup-\r\nplemental,” you state that you would “like to hear from\r\nDr. Cullis; and, by the way, from Mrs. Eddy, also.” [15]\r\n\r\nBecause of the great demand upon my time, consisting\r\nin part of dictating answers through my secretary, or an-\r\nswering personally manifold letters and inquiries from all\r\nquarters,—having charge of a church, editing a maga-\r\nzine, teaching Christian Science, receiving calls, etc.,—I [20]\r\nfind it inconvenient to accept your invitation to answer\r\nyou through the medium of a newspaper; but, for infor-\r\nmation as to what I believe and teach, would refer you to\r\nthe Holy Scriptures, to my various publications, and to my\r\nChristian students. [25]\r\n\r\nIt was with a thrill of pleasure that I read in your arti-\r\ncle these words: “If we have in any way misrepresented\r\neither Dr. Cullis or Mrs. Eddy, we are sorry.” Even the\r\ndesire to be just is a vital spark of Christianity. And those\r\nwords inspire me with the hope that you wish to be just. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 133.]\r\n\r\nIf this is so, you will not delay corrections of the statement [1]\r\nyou make at the close of your article, when referring to\r\nme, “the pantheistic and prayerless Mrs. Eddy, of Boston.”\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to build a sentence of so few words\r\nconveying ideas more opposite to the fact. [5]\r\n\r\nIn refutation of your statement that I am a pantheist,\r\nI request you to read my sermons and publications.\r\n\r\nAs to being “prayerless,” I call your attention and\r\ndeep consideration to the following Scripture, that voices\r\nmy impressions of prayer:— [10]\r\n\r\n“When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites\r\nare: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and\r\nin the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men....\r\nBut thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,\r\nand when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father [15]\r\nwhich is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret\r\nshall reward thee openly.”\r\n\r\nI hope I am not wrong in literally following the dictum\r\nof Jesus; and, were it not because of my desire to set\r\nyou right on this question, I should feel a delicacy in mak- [20]\r\ning the following statement:—\r\n\r\nThree times a day, I retire to seek the divine blessing\r\non the sick and sorrowing, with my face toward the Jeru-\r\nsalem of Love and Truth, in silent prayer to the Father\r\nwhich “seeth in secret,” and with childlike confidence that [25]\r\nHe will reward “openly.” In the midst of depressing care\r\nand labor I turn constantly to divine Love for guidance,\r\nand find rest. It affords me great joy to be able to attest to\r\nthe truth of Jesus’ words. Love makes all burdens light,\r\nit giveth a peace that passeth understanding, and with [30]\r\n“signs following.” As to the peace, it is unutterable; as\r\nto “signs,” behold the sick who are healed, the sorrowful\r\n\r\n[Page 134.]\r\n\r\nwho are made hopeful, and the sinful and ignorant who [1]\r\nhave become “wise unto salvation”!\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear sir, as you have expressed contrition for\r\nan act which you have immediately repeated, you are\r\nplaced in this dilemma: To reiterate such words of [5]\r\napology as characterize justice and Christianity.\r\n\r\nVery truly,\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The National Christian Scientist Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Students_:—Meet together and meet _en masse_, [10]\r\nin 1888, at the annual session of the National Christian\r\nScientist Association. Be “of one mind,” “in one place,”\r\nand God will pour you out a blessing such as you never\r\nbefore received. He who dwelleth in eternal light is\r\nbigger than the shadow, and will guard and guide His [15]\r\nown.\r\n\r\nLet no consideration bend or outweigh your purpose\r\nto be in Chicago on June 13. Firm in your allegiance to\r\nthe reign of universal harmony, go to its rescue. In God’s\r\nhour, the powers of earth and hell are proven powerless. [20]\r\nThe reeling ranks of _materia medica_, with poisons, nos-\r\ntrums, and knives, are impotent when at war with the\r\nomnipotent! Like Elisha, look up, and behold: “They\r\nthat be with us, are more than they that be with them.”\r\n\r\nError is only fermenting, and its heat hissing at the [25]\r\n“still, small voice” of Truth; but it can neither silence\r\nnor disarm God’s voice. Spiritual wickedness is stand-\r\ning in high places; but, blind to its own fate, it will tumble\r\ninto the bottomless.\r\n\r\n[Page 135.]\r\n\r\nChristians, and all _true_ Scientists, marching under what- [1]\r\nsoever ensign, come into the ranks! Again I repeat, per-\r\nson is not in the question of Christian Science. Principle,\r\ninstead of person, is next to our hearts, on our lips, and\r\nin our lives. Our watchwords are Truth and Love; and [5]\r\nif we abide in these, they will abound in us, and we shall\r\nbe one in heart,—one in motive, purpose, pursuit. Abid-\r\ning in Love, not one of you can be separated from me; and\r\nthe sweet sense of journeying on together, doing unto\r\nothers as ye would they should do unto you, conquers all [10]\r\nopposition, surmounts all obstacles, and secures success.\r\nIf you falter, or fail to fulfil this Golden Rule, though you\r\nshould build to the heavens, you would build on sand.\r\n\r\nIs it a cross to give one week’s time and expense to the\r\njubilee of Spirit? Then take this cross, and the crown [15]\r\nwith it. Sending forth currents of Truth, God’s methods\r\nand means of healing, and so spreading the gospel of\r\nLove, is in itself an eternity of joy that outweighs an\r\nhour. Add one more noble offering to the unity of good,\r\nand so cement the bonds of Love. [20]\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The College Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter read at the meeting of the Massachusetts Metaphysical\r\nCollege Association, June 3, 1891. [25]\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS’ ASSOCIATION OF\r\nTHE MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Students_:—You may be looking to see me\r\nin my accustomed place with you, but this you must no\r\n\r\n[Page 136.]\r\n\r\nlonger expect. When I retired from the field of labor, [1]\r\nit was a departure, socially, publicly, and finally, from\r\nthe routine of such material modes as society and our\r\nsocieties demand. Rumors are rumors,—nothing more.\r\nI am still with you on the field of battle, taking forward [5]\r\nmarches, broader and higher views, and with the hope\r\nthat you will follow.\r\n\r\nThe eternal and infinite, already brought to your\r\nearnest consideration, so grow upon my vision that I\r\ncannot feel justified in turning aside for one hour from [10]\r\ncontemplation of them and of the faith unfeigned.\r\nWhen the verities of being seem to you as to me,—as\r\nthey must some time,—you will understand the neces-\r\nsity for my seclusion, and its fulfilment of divine order.\r\n“Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye sepa- [15]\r\nrate, saith the Lord.”\r\n\r\nAll our thoughts should be given to the absolute\r\ndemonstration of Christian Science. You can well\r\nafford to give me up, since you have in my last re-\r\nvised edition of Science and Health your teacher and [20]\r\nguide.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the June session of this honorable\r\nbody shall close your meetings for the summer; also, that\r\nhereafter you hold three sessions annually, convening\r\nonce in four months; oftener is not requisite, and the [25]\r\nmembers coming from a distance will be accommodated\r\nby this arrangement.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nMARY B. G. EDDY\r\n\r\n[Page 137.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The National Christian Scientist Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Dear Students and Friends_:—Accept my thanks\r\nfor your card of invitation, your badge, and order of exer-\r\ncise, all of which are complete.\r\n\r\nWhen I gave you a meagre reception in Boston at the [5]\r\nclose of the first convention of the National Christian\r\nScientist Association, it was simply to give you the privi-\r\nlege, poor as it was, of speaking a few words aside to your\r\nteacher. I remember my regret, when, having asked in\r\ngeneral assembly if you had any questions to propose, I [10]\r\nreceived no reply. Since then you have doubtless realized\r\nthat such opportunity might have been improved; but\r\nthat time has passed.\r\n\r\nI greatly rejoice over the growth of my students within\r\nthe last few years. It was kind of you to part so gently [15]\r\nwith the protecting wings of the mother-bird, and to spread\r\nyour own so bravely. Now, dear ones, if you take my\r\nadvice again, you will do—what?\r\n\r\nEven this: Disorganize the National Christian Scientist\r\nAssociation! and each one return to his place of [20]\r\nlabor, to work out individually and alone, for himself and\r\nfor others, the sublime ends of human life.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, you must give much time to self-\r\nexamination and correction; you must control appetite,\r\npassion, pride, envy, evil-speaking, resentment, and each [25]\r\none of the innumerable errors that worketh or maketh\r\na lie. Then you can give to the world the benefit of all\r\nthis, and heal and teach with increased confidence. My\r\nstudents can _now_ organize their students into associa-\r\ntions, form churches, and hold these organizations of their [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 138.]\r\n\r\nown,—until, in turn, their students will sustain them- [1]\r\nselves and work for others.\r\n\r\nThe time it takes yearly to prepare for this national\r\nconvention is worse than wasted, if it causes thought to\r\nwander in the wilderness or ways of the world. The de- [5]\r\ntail of conforming to society, in any way, costs you what\r\nit would to give time and attention to hygiene in your\r\nministry and healing.\r\n\r\nFor students to work together is not always to co-\r\noperate, but sometimes to coelbow! Each student should [10]\r\nseek alone the guidance of our common Father—even\r\nthe divine Principle which he claims to demonstrate,—\r\nand especially should he prove his faith by works, ethi-\r\ncally, physically, and spiritually. Remember that the\r\nfirst and last lesson of Christian Science is love, perfect [15]\r\nlove, and love made perfect through the cross.\r\n\r\nI once thought that in unity was human strength; but\r\nhave grown to know that human strength is weakness,—\r\nthat unity is divine might, giving to human power, peace.\r\n\r\nMy counsel is applicable to the state of general growth [20]\r\nin the members of the National Christian Scientist Asso-\r\nciation, but it is not so adapted to the members of\r\nstudents’ organizations. And wherefore? Because the\r\ngrowth of these at first is more gradual; but whenever\r\nthey are equal to the march triumphant, God will give [25]\r\nto all His soldiers of the cross the proper command, and\r\nunder the banner of His love, and with the “still, small\r\nvoice” for the music of our march, we all shall take step\r\nand march on in spiritual organization.\r\n\r\nYour loving teacher, [30]\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\nCONCORD, N. H., May 23, 1890\r\n\r\n[Page 139.]\r\n\r\nN. B. I recommend this honorable body to adjourn, [1]\r\nif it does not disorganize, to three years from this date;\r\nor, if it does disorganize, to meet again in three years.\r\nThen bring your tithes into the storehouse, and God will\r\npour you out a blessing such as you even yet have not [5]\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nM. B. G. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The First Church Of Christ, Scientist, Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty_ [10]\r\n_through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) casting down_\r\n_imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the_\r\n_knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the_\r\n_obedience of Christ._—2 COR. X. 4, 5.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1883, I started the _Journal_ of Christian [15]\r\nScience, with a portion of the above Scripture for its\r\nmotto.\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 1889, I gave a lot of land—in\r\nBoston, situated near the beautiful Back Bay Park, now\r\nvalued at $20,000 and rising in value—for the purpose [20]\r\nof having erected thereon a church edifice to be called The\r\nChurch of Christ, Scientist.\r\n\r\nI had this desirable site transferred in a circuitous,\r\nnovel way, at the wisdom whereof a few persons have\r\nsince scrupled; but to my spiritual perception, like all [25]\r\ntrue wisdom, this transaction will in future be regarded\r\nas greatly wise, and it will be found that this act was in\r\nadvance of the erring mind’s apprehension.\r\n\r\nAs with all former efforts in the interest of Christian\r\nScience, I took care that the provisions for the land and [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 140.]\r\n\r\nbuilding were such as error could not control. I knew [1]\r\nthat to God’s gift, foundation and superstructure, no one\r\ncould hold a wholly material title. The land, and the\r\nchurch standing on it, must be conveyed through a type\r\nrepresenting the true nature of the gift; a type morally [5]\r\nand spiritually inalienable, but materially questionable\r\n—even after the manner that all spiritual good comes\r\nto Christian Scientists, to the end of taxing their faith\r\nin God, and their adherence to the superiority of the\r\nclaims of Spirit over matter or merely legal titles. [10]\r\n\r\nNo one could buy, sell, or mortgage my gift as I had\r\nit conveyed. Thus the case rested, and I supposed the\r\ntrustee-deed was legal; but this was God’s business, not\r\nmine. Our church was prospered by the right hand of\r\nHis righteousness, and contributions to the Building Fund [15]\r\ngenerously poured into the treasury. Unity prevailed,—\r\ntill mortal man sought to know who owned God’s temple,\r\nand adopted and urged only the material side of this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe lot of land which I donated I redeemed from under [20]\r\nmortgage. The foundation on which our church was to\r\nbe built had to be rescued from the grasp of legal power,\r\nand now it must be put back into the arms of Love, if we\r\nwould not be found fighting against God.\r\n\r\nThe diviner claim and means for upbuilding the Church [25]\r\nof Christ were prospered. Our title to God’s acres will\r\nbe safe and sound—when we can “read our title clear”\r\nto heavenly mansions. Built on the rock, our church\r\nwill stand the storms of ages: though the material super-\r\nstructure should crumble into dust, the fittest would sur- [30]\r\nvive,—the spiritual idea would live, a perpetual type of\r\nthe divine Principle it reflects.\r\n\r\n[Page 141.]\r\n\r\nThe First Church of Christ, Scientist, our prayer in [1]\r\nstone, will be the prophecy fulfilled, the monument up-\r\nreared, of Christian Science. It will speak to you of the\r\nMother, and of your hearts’ offering to her through whom\r\nwas revealed to you God’s all-power, all-presence, and [5]\r\nall-science. This building begun, will go up, and no one\r\ncan suffer from it, for no one can resist the power that\r\nis behind it; and against this church temple “the gates\r\nof hell” cannot prevail.\r\n\r\nAll loyal Christian Scientists hail with joy this pro- [10]\r\nposed type of universal Love; not so, however, with\r\nerror, which hates the bonds and methods of Truth, and\r\nshudders at the freedom, might, and majesty of Spirit,\r\n—even the annihilating law of Love.\r\n\r\nI vindicate both the law of God and the laws of our [15]\r\nland. I believe,—yea, I understand,—that with the\r\nspirit of Christ actuating all the parties concerned about\r\nthe legal quibble, it can easily be corrected to the satis-\r\nfaction of all. Let this be speedily done. Do not, I im-\r\nplore you, stain the early history of Christian Science by [20]\r\nthe impulses of human will and pride; but let the divine\r\nwill and the nobility of human meekness rule this busi-\r\nness transaction, in obedience to the law of Love and the\r\nlaws of our land.\r\n\r\nAs the ambassador of Christ’s teachings, I admonish [25]\r\nyou: Delay not longer to commence building our church\r\nin Boston; or else return every dollar that you yourselves\r\ndeclare you have had no legal authority for obtaining, to\r\nthe several contributors,—and let them, not you, say\r\nwhat shall be done with their money. [30]\r\n\r\nOf our first church in Boston, O recording angel!\r\nwrite: God is in the midst of her: how beautiful are her\r\n\r\n[Page 142.]\r\n\r\nfeet! how beautiful are her garments! how hath He en- [1]\r\nlarged her borders! how hath He made her wildernesses\r\nto bud and blossom as the rose!\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Donors Of Boat, From Toronto, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten on receipt of a beautiful boat presented by Christian\r\nScientists in Toronto, for the little pond at Pleasant View. The\r\nboat displays, among other beautiful decorations, a number of\r\nmasonic symbols. [10]\r\n\r\n_Beloved Students and Friends_:—Accept my thanks\r\nfor the beautiful boat and presentation poem. Each day\r\nsince they arrived I have said, Let me write to the donors,\r\n—and what?\r\n\r\nMy first impression was to indite a poem; my second, [15]\r\na psalm; my third, a letter. Why the letter alone? Be-\r\ncause your dear hearts expressed in their lovely gift such\r\nvarying types of true affection, shaded as autumn leaves\r\nwith bright hues of the spiritual, that my Muse lost her\r\nlightsome lyre, and imagery of thought gave place to [20]\r\nchords of feeling too deep for words.\r\n\r\nA boat song seemed more Olympian than the psalm in\r\nspiritual strains of the Hebrew bard. So I send my\r\nanswer in a commonplace letter. Poor return, is it\r\nnot? [25]\r\n\r\nThe symbols of freemasonry depicted on the boat\r\nwakened memory, touched tender fibres of thought, and\r\nI longed to say to the masonic brothers: If as a woman\r\nI may not unite with you in freemasonry, nor you with\r\nme in Christian Science, yet as friends we can feel the [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 143.]\r\n\r\ntouch of heart to heart and hand to hand, on the broad [1]\r\nbasis and sure foundation of true friendship’s “level”\r\nand the “square” of moral sentiments.\r\n\r\nMy dear students may have explained to the kind par-\r\nticipants in beautifying this boat our spiritual points, [5]\r\nabove the plane of matter. If so, I may hope that a\r\ncloser link hath bound us. Across lakes, into a kingdom,\r\nI reach out my hand to clasp yours, with this silent bene-\r\ndiction: May the kingdom of heaven come in each of\r\nyour hearts! [10]\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress,—Laying The Corner-Stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Students_:—On the 21st day of May, A.D.\r\n1894, with quiet, imposing ceremony, is laid the corner- [15]\r\nstone of “The First Church of Christ, Scientist,” in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to say that you, principally\r\nthe Normal class graduates of my College, well known\r\nphysicians, teachers, editors, and pastors of churches, [20]\r\nby contributions of one thousand dollars each, husband\r\nand wife reckoned as one, have, within about three\r\nmonths, donated the munificent sum of forty-two thou-\r\nsand dollars toward building The Mother Church. A\r\nquiet call from me for this extra contribution, in aid of [25]\r\nour Church Building Fund, found you all “with one\r\naccord in one place.” Each donation came promptly;\r\nsometimes at much self-sacrifice, but always accompanied\r\nwith a touching letter breathing the donor’s privileged joy.\r\n\r\n[Page 144.]\r\n\r\nThe granite for this church was taken from the quar- [1]\r\nries in New Hampshire, my native State. The money\r\nfor building “Mother’s Room,” situated in the second\r\nstory of the tower on the northeast corner of this build-\r\ning, and the name thereof, came from the dear children [5]\r\nof Christian Scientists; a little band called Busy Bees,\r\norganized by Miss Maurine R. Campbell.\r\n\r\nOn this memorable day there are laid away a copy of\r\nthis address, the subscription list on which appear your\r\nseveral names in your own handwriting, your textbook, [10]\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and\r\nother works written by the same author, your teacher,\r\nthe Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science;(4) without\r\npomp or pride, laid away as a sacred secret in the\r\nheart of a rock, there to typify the prophecy, “And a man [15]\r\nshall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert\r\nfrom the tempest; ... as the shadow of a great rock in\r\na weary land:” henceforth to whisper our Master’s\r\npromise, “Upon this rock I will build my church; and\r\nthe gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” [20]\r\n\r\nTo-day, be this hope in each of our hearts,—precious\r\nin God’s sight as shall be the assembling of His people\r\nin this temple, sweet as the rest that remaineth for the\r\nrighteous, and fresh as a summer morn,—that, from\r\nearth’s pillows of stone, our visible lives are rising to [25]\r\nGod. As in the history of a seed, so may our earthly\r\nsowing bear fruit that exudes the inspiration of the wine\r\npoured into the cup of Christ.\r\n\r\nTo-day I pray that divine Love, the life-giving Prin-\r\nciple of Christianity, shall speedily wake the long night [30]\r\nof materialism, and the universal dawn shall break upon\r\nthe spire of this temple. The Church, more than any\r\n\r\n[Page 145.]\r\n\r\nother institution, at present is the cement of society, and [1]\r\nit should be the bulwark of civil and religious liberty.\r\nBut the time cometh when the religious element, or Church\r\nof Christ, shall exist alone in the affections, and need no\r\norganization to express it. Till then, this form of godli- [5]\r\nness seems as requisite to manifest its spirit, as individ-\r\nuality to express Soul and substance.\r\n\r\nDoes a single bosom burn for fame and power? Then\r\nwhen that person shall possess these, let him ask him-\r\nself, and answer to his name in this corner-stone of our [10]\r\ntemple: Am I greater for them? And if he thinks that\r\nhe is, then is he less than man to whom God gave “do-\r\nminion over all the earth,” less than the meek who “in-\r\nherit the earth.” Even vanity forbids man to be vain;\r\nand pride is a hooded hawk which flies in darkness. Over [15]\r\na wounded sense of its own error, let not mortal thought\r\nresuscitate too soon.\r\n\r\nIn our rock-bound friendship, delicate as dear, our\r\nnames may melt into one, and common dust, and their\r\nmodest sign be nothingness. Be this as it may, the visible [20]\r\nunity of spirit remains, to quicken even dust into sweet\r\nmemorial such as Isaiah prophesied: “The wolf also shall\r\ndwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with\r\nthe kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling\r\ntogether; and a little child shall lead them.” [25]\r\n\r\nWhen the _hearts_ of Christian Scientists are woven to-\r\ngether as are their names in the web of history, earth will\r\nfloat majestically heaven’s heraldry, and echo the song\r\nof angels: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth\r\npeace, good will toward men.” [30]\r\n\r\nTo The Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, and to\r\nthe dear children that my heart folds within it, let me\r\n\r\n[Page 146.]\r\n\r\nsay, ’Tis sweet to remember thee, and God’s Zion, with [1]\r\nhealing on her wings. May her walls be vocal with sal-\r\nvation; and her gates with praise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The First Church Of Christ, Scientist, Boston\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Students_:—I cannot conscientiously lend\r\nmy counsel to direct your action on receiving or dismiss-\r\ning candidates. To do this, I should need to be with\r\nyou. I cannot accept hearsay, and would need to know\r\nthe circumstances and facts regarding both sides of the [10]\r\nsubject, to form a proper judgment. This is not my\r\npresent province; hence I have hitherto declined to be\r\nconsulted on these subjects, and still maintain this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThese are matters of grave import; and you cannot [15]\r\nbe indifferent to this, but will give them immediate at-\r\ntention, and be governed therein by the spirit and the\r\nletter of this Scripture: “Whatsoever ye would that men\r\nshould do unto you, do ye even so to them.”\r\n\r\nI cannot be the conscience for this church; but if I [20]\r\nwere, I would gather every reformed mortal that desired\r\nto come, into its fold, and counsel and help him to walk\r\nin the footsteps of His flock. I feel sure that as Chris-\r\ntian Scientists you will act, relative to this matter, up to\r\nyour highest understanding of justice and mercy. [25]\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\nFeb. 12, 1895\r\n\r\n[Page 147.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Members Of The First Church Of Christ, Scientist, Boston,\r\nMassachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Students_:—Another year has rolled on, [3]\r\nanother annual meeting has convened, another space of\r\ntime has been given us, and has another duty been done [5]\r\nand another victory won for time and eternity? Do you\r\nmeet in unity, preferring one another, and demonstrating\r\nthe divine Principle of Christian Science? Have you\r\nimproved past hours, and ladened them with records\r\nworthy to be borne heavenward? Have you learned [10]\r\nthat sin is inadmissible, and indicates a small mind?\r\nDo you manifest love for those that hate you and de-\r\nspitefully use you?\r\n\r\nThe man of integrity is one who makes it his constant\r\nrule to follow the road of duty, according as Truth and [15]\r\nthe voice of his conscience point it out to him. He is not\r\nguided merely by affections which may some time give\r\nthe color of virtue to a loose and unstable character.\r\n\r\nThe upright man is guided by a fixed Principle, which\r\ndestines him to do nothing but what is honorable, and to [20]\r\nabhor whatever is base or unworthy; hence we find him\r\never the same,—at all times the trusty friend, the affec-\r\ntionate relative, the conscientious man of business, the\r\npious worker, the public-spirited citizen.\r\n\r\nHe assumes no borrowed appearance. He seeks no [25]\r\nmask to cover him, for he acts no studied part; but he\r\nis indeed what he appears to be,—full of truth, candor,\r\nand humanity. In all his pursuits, he knows no path\r\nbut the fair, open, and direct one, and would much rather\r\nfail of success than attain it by reproachable means. He [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 148.]\r\n\r\nnever shows us a smiling countenance while he meditates [1]\r\nevil against us in his heart. We shall never find one part\r\nof his character at variance with another.\r\n\r\nLovingly yours,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY [5]\r\n\r\nSept. 30, 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract From A Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rules and By-laws in the Manual of The First\r\nChurch of Christ, Scientist, Boston, originated not in\r\nsolemn conclave as in ancient Sanhedrim. They were [10]\r\nnot arbitrary opinions nor dictatorial demands, such as\r\none person might impose on another. They were im-\r\npelled by a power not one’s own, were written at differ-\r\nent dates, and as the occasion required. They sprang\r\nfrom necessity, the logic of events,—from the immedi- [15]\r\nate demand for them as a help that must be supplied to\r\nmaintain the dignity and defense of our Cause; hence\r\ntheir simple, scientific basis, and detail so requisite to\r\ndemonstrate genuine Christian Science, and which will\r\ndo for the race what absolute doctrines destined for future [20]\r\ngenerations might not accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo The Mother Church\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Brethren_:—Until recently, I was not aware\r\nthat the contribution box was presented at your Friday\r\nevening meetings. I specially desire that you collect no\r\nmoneyed contributions from the people present on these\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nLet the invitation to this sweet converse be in the words\r\nof the prophet Isaiah: “Ho, every one that thirsteth,\r\n\r\n[Page 149.]\r\n\r\ncome ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come [1]\r\nye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without\r\nmoney and without price.”\r\n\r\nInvite all cordially and freely to this banquet of Chris-\r\ntian Science, this feast and flow of Soul. Ask them to [5]\r\nbring what they possess of love and light to help leaven\r\nyour loaf and replenish your scanty store. Then, after\r\npresenting the various offerings, and one after another\r\nhas opened his lips to discourse and distribute what God\r\nhas given him of experience, hope, faith, and under- [10]\r\nstanding, gather up the fragments, and count the baskets\r\nfull of accessions to your love, and see that nothing has\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY [15]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo First Church Of Christ, Scientist, In Oconto\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Brethren_:—Lips nor pen can ever ex-\r\npress the joy you give me in parting so promptly with\r\nyour beloved pastor, Rev. Mr. Norcross, to send him to [20]\r\naid me. It is a refreshing demonstration of Christianity,\r\nbrotherly love, and all the rich graces of the Spirit. May\r\nthis sacrifice bring to your beloved church a vision of the\r\nnew church, that cometh down from heaven, whose altar\r\nis a loving heart, whose communion is fellowship with [25]\r\nsaints and angels. This example of yours is a light that\r\ncannot be hid.\r\n\r\nGuided by the pillar and the cloud, this little church\r\nthat built the first temple for Christian Science worship\r\nshall abide steadfastly in the faith of Jesus’ words: “Fear [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 150.]\r\n\r\nnot, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to [1]\r\ngive you the kingdom.” May He soon give you a pastor;\r\nalready you have the great Shepherd of Israel watch-\r\ning over you. Give my forever-love to your dear church.\r\n\r\nYours in bonds of Christ,\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY [5]\r\n\r\nBOSTON, MASS., 1889\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo First Church Of Christ, Scientist, In Scranton\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Brethren_:—Space is no separator of hearts. [10]\r\nSpiritually, I am with all who are with Truth, and whose\r\nhearts today are repeating their joy that God dwelleth\r\nin the congregation of the faithful, and loveth the gates\r\nof Zion.\r\n\r\nThe outlook is cheering. We have already seen the [15]\r\nsalvation of many people by means of Christian Science.\r\nChapels and churches are dotting the entire land. Con-\r\nvenient houses and halls can now be obtained wherein, as\r\nwhereout, Christian Scientists may worship the Father\r\n“in spirit and in truth,” as taught by our great Master. [20]\r\n\r\n“If God be for us, who can be against us?” If He\r\nbe with us, the wayside is a sanctuary, and the desert a\r\nresting-place peopled with living witnesses of the fact\r\nthat “God is Love.”\r\n\r\nGod is universal; confined to no spot, defined by no [25]\r\ndogma, appropriated by no sect. Not more to one than\r\nto all, is God demonstrable as divine Life, Truth, and\r\nLove; and His people are they that reflect Him—that\r\nreflect Love. Again, this infinite Principle, with its uni-\r\nversal manifestation, is all that really is or can be; [30]\r\nhence God is our Shepherd. He guards, guides, feeds,\r\n\r\n[Page 151.]\r\n\r\nand folds the sheep of His pasture; and their ears are [1]\r\nattuned to His call. In the words of the loving disciple,\r\n“My sheep hear my voice,... and they follow me;\r\n...neither shall any man pluck them out of my\r\nhand.” [5]\r\n\r\nGod is a consuming fire. He separates the dross from\r\nthe gold, purifies the human character, through the\r\nfurnace of affliction. Those who bear fruit He purgeth,\r\nthat they may bear more fruit. Through the sacred law,\r\nHe speaketh to the unfruitful in tones of Sinai: and, in [10]\r\nthe gospel, He saith of the barren fig-tree, “Cut it down;\r\nwhy cumbereth it the ground?”\r\n\r\nGod is our Father and our Mother, our Minister and\r\nthe great Physician: He is man’s only real relative on\r\nearth and in heaven. David sang, “Whom have I in [15]\r\nheaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I\r\ndesire beside thee.”\r\n\r\nBrother, sister, beloved in the Lord, knowest thou\r\nthyself, and art thou acquainted with God? If not, I\r\npray thee as a Christian Scientist, delay not to make Him [20]\r\nthy first acquaintance.\r\n\r\nGlorious things are spoken of you in His Word. Ye\r\nare a chosen people, whose God is—what? Even _All_.\r\nMay mercy and truth go before you: may the lamp of\r\nyour life continually be full of oil, and you be wedded\r\nto the spiritual idea, Christ; then will you heal, and\r\nteach, and preach, on the ascending scale of everlasting\r\nLife and Love.\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours in Christ,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 152.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo First Church Of Christ, Scientist, In Denver\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Pastor and Brethren_:—“As in water face\r\nanswereth to face,” and in love continents clasp hands, so\r\nthe oneness of God includes also His presence with those [5]\r\nwhose hearts unite in the purposes of goodness. Of this\r\nwe may be sure: that thoughts winged with peace and\r\nlove breathe a silent benediction over all the earth, co-\r\noperate with the divine power, and brood unconsciously\r\no’er the work of His hand. [10]\r\n\r\nI, as a corporeal person, am not in your midst: I, as a\r\ndictator, arbiter, or ruler, am not present; but I, as a\r\nmother whose heart pulsates with every throb of theirs\r\nfor the welfare of her children, am present, and rejoice\r\nwith them that rejoice. [15]\r\n\r\nMay meekness, mercy, and love dwell forever in the\r\nhearts of those who worship in this tabernacle: then\r\nwill they receive the heritage that God has prepared for\r\nHis people,—made ready for the pure in affection, the\r\nmeek in spirit, the worshipper in truth, the follower of [20]\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThus founded upon the rock of Christ, when storm\r\nand tempest beat against this sure foundation, you,\r\nsafely sheltered in the strong tower of hope, faith, and\r\nLove, are God’s nestlings; and He will hide you in His [25]\r\nfeathers till the storm has passed. Into His haven of\r\nSoul there enters no element of earth to cast out angels,\r\nto silence the right intuition which guides you safely\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nExercise more faith in God and His spiritual means [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 153.]\r\n\r\nand methods, than in man and his material ways and [1]\r\nmeans, of establishing the Cause of Christian Science.\r\nIf right yourself, God will confirm His inheritance. “Be\r\nnot weary in well doing.” Truth is restful, and Love is\r\ntriumphant. [5]\r\n\r\nWhen God went forth before His people, they were\r\nfed with manna: they marched through the wilderness:\r\nthey passed through the Red Sea, untouched by the bil-\r\nlows. At His command, the rock became a fountain;\r\nand the land of promise, green isles of refreshment. In [10]\r\nthe words of the Psalmist, when “the Lord gave the word:\r\ngreat was the company of those that published it.”\r\n\r\nGod is good to Israel,—washed in the waters of\r\nMeribah, cleansed of the flesh,—good to His Israel\r\nencompassed not with pride, hatred, self-will, and self- [15]\r\njustification; wherein violence covereth men as a gar-\r\nment, and as captives are they enchained.\r\n\r\nChristian Scientists bring forth the fruits of Spirit,\r\nnot flesh; and God giveth this “new name” to no man\r\nwho honors Him not by positive proof of trustworthiness. [20]\r\nMay you be able to say, “I have not cleansed my heart\r\nin vain.”\r\n\r\nSir Edwin Arnold, to whom I presented a copy of\r\nmy first edition of “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” writes:— [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Peace on earth and Good-will!\r\n    Souls that are gentle and still\r\n    Hear the first music of this\r\n    Far-off, infinite, Bliss!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo may the God of peace be and abide with this church. [30]\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n[Page 154.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo First Church Of Christ, Scientist, In Lawrence\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Brethren_:—The spreading branches of The\r\nChurch of Christ, Scientist, are fast reaching out their\r\nbroad shelter to the entire world. Your faith has not [5]\r\nbeen without works,—and God’s love for His flock is\r\nmanifest in His care. He will dig about this little church,\r\nprune its encumbering branches, water it with the dews\r\nof heaven, enrich its roots, and enlarge its borders with\r\ndivine Love. God only waits for man’s worthiness to [10]\r\nenhance the means and measure of His grace. You\r\nhave already proof of the prosperity of His Zion. You\r\nsit beneath your own vine and fig-tree as the growth\r\nof spirituality—even that vine whereof our Father is\r\nhusbandman. [15]\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of divine Love to resurrect the under-\r\nstanding, and the kingdom of God, the reign of har-\r\nmony already within us. Through the word that is\r\nspoken unto you, are you made free. Abide in His word,\r\nand it shall abide in you; and the healing Christ will [20]\r\nagain be made manifest in the flesh—understood and\r\nglorified.\r\n\r\nHonor thy Father and Mother, God. Continue in\r\nHis love. Bring forth fruit—“signs following”—that\r\nyour prayers be not hindered. Pray without ceasing. [25]\r\nWatch diligently; never desert the post of spiritual ob-\r\nservation and self-examination. Strive for self-abnega-\r\ntion, justice, meekness, mercy, purity, love. Let your\r\nlight reflect Light. Have no ambition, affection, nor\r\naim apart from holiness. Forget not for a moment, that [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 155.]\r\n\r\nGod is All-in-all—therefore, that in reality there is but [1]\r\none cause and effect.\r\n\r\nThe pride of circumstance or power is the prince of\r\nthis world that has nothing in Christ. All power and\r\nhappiness are spiritual, and proceed from goodness. [5]\r\nSacrifice self to bless one another, even as God has\r\nblessed you. Forget self in laboring for mankind; then\r\nwill you woo the weary wanderer to your door, win the\r\npilgrim and stranger to your church, and find access to\r\nthe heart of humanity. While pressing meekly on, be [10]\r\nfaithful, be valiant in the Christian’s warfare, and peace\r\nwill crown your joy.\r\n\r\nLovingly yours,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Correspondents\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Students_:—Because Mother has not the time\r\neven to read all of her interesting correspondence, and\r\nless wherein to answer it (however much she desires\r\nthus to do), she hereby requests: First, that you, her\r\nstudents’ students, who write such excellent letters to [20]\r\nher, will hereafter, as a general rule, send them to the\r\neditors of _The Christian Science Journal_ for publication,\r\nand thereby give to us all the pleasure of hearing from you.\r\n\r\nIf my own students cannot spare time to write to God,\r\n—when they address me I shall be apt to forward their [25]\r\nletters to Him as our common Parent, and by way of\r\n_The Christian Science Journal_; thus fulfilling their moral\r\nobligation to furnish some reading-matter for our denomi-\r\nnational organ. Methinks, were they to contemplate the\r\nuniversal charge wherewith divine Love has entrusted us, [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 156.]\r\n\r\nin behalf of a suffering race, they would contribute oftener [1]\r\nto the pages of this swift vehicle of scientific thought;\r\nfor it reaches a vast number of earnest readers, and seek-\r\ners after Truth.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Students\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Christian Scientists_:—Please send in your\r\ncontributions as usual to our _Journal_. All is well at head-\r\nquarters, and when the mist shall melt away you will see\r\nclearly the signs of Truth and the heaven of Love within [10]\r\nyour hearts. Let the reign of peace and harmony be\r\nsupreme and forever yours.\r\n\r\nI proposed to merge the adjourned meeting in the one\r\nheld at Chicago, because I saw no advantage, but great\r\ndisadvantage, in one student’s opinions or _modus oper-_ [15]\r\n_andi_ becoming the basis for others: read “Retrospection”\r\non this subject. Science is absolute, and best under-\r\nstood through the study of my works and the daily Chris-\r\ntian demonstration thereof. It is their _materiality_ that\r\nclogs the progress of students, and “this kind goeth not [20]\r\nforth but by prayer and fasting.” It is materialism through\r\nwhich the animal magnetizer preys, and in turn becomes\r\na prey. Spirituality is the basis of all true thought and\r\nvolition. Assembling themselves together, and listening\r\nto each other amicably, or contentiously, is no aid to [25]\r\nstudents in acquiring solid Christian Science. Experi-\r\nence and, above all, _obedience_, are the aids and tests of\r\ngrowth and understanding in this direction.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY B. G. EDDY [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 157.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo A Student\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Dear Student_:—It is a great thing to be found\r\nworthy to suffer for Christ, Truth. Paul said, “If we\r\nsuffer, we shall also reign with him.” Reign then, my\r\nbeloved in the Lord. He that marketh the sparrow’s fall [5]\r\nwill direct thy way.\r\n\r\nI have written, or caused my secretary to write, to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Stewart, of Toronto, Canada (you will find their\r\ncard in _The C. S. Journal_,) that you or your lawyer will\r\nask them all questions important for your case, and re- [10]\r\nquested that they furnish all information possible. They\r\nwill be glad to help you. Every true Christian Scientist\r\nwill feel “as bound with you,” but as free in Truth and\r\nLove, safe under the shadow of His wing.\r\n\r\nYes, my student, my Father is your Father; and He [15]\r\nhelps us most when help is most needed, for He is the\r\never-present help.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you are in good cheer. I enclose you\r\nthe name of Mr. E. A. Kimball, C. S. D., of Chicago,—\r\n5020 Woodlawn Ave.,—for items relative to Mrs. Steb- [20]\r\nbin’s case.\r\n\r\n“Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him;\r\nand He shall bring it to pass. And He shall bring forth\r\nthy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the\r\nnoonday.” This I know, for God is for us. [25]\r\n\r\nWrite me when you need me. Error has no power\r\nbut to destroy itself. It _cannot harm you_; it cannot stop\r\nthe eternal currents of Truth.\r\n\r\nEver with love,\r\nMARY B. G. EDDY\r\n\r\n[Page 158.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo A Student\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Beloved Student:_—In reply to your letter I will\r\nsay: God’s ways are not as our ways; but higher far\r\nthan the heavens above the earth is His wisdom above\r\nours. When I requested you to be ordained, I little [5]\r\nthought of the changes about to be made. When I insisted\r\non your speaking without notes, I little knew that\r\nso soon another change in your pulpit would be demanded.\r\nBut now, after His messenger has obeyed the message\r\nof divine Love, comes the interpretation thereof. But you [10]\r\nsee we both had first to obey, and to do this through faith,\r\nnot sight.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of it all, as now shown, is this: when\r\nyou were bidden to be ordained, it was in reward for your\r\nfaithful service, thus to honor it. The second command, [15]\r\nto drop the use of notes, was to rebuke a lack of faith in\r\ndivine help, and to test your humility and obedience in\r\nbearing this cross.\r\n\r\nAll God’s servants are minute men and women. As\r\nof old, I stand with sandals on and staff in hand, wait- [20]\r\ning for the watchword and the revelation of what, how,\r\nwhither. Let us be faithful and obedient, and God will\r\ndo the rest.\r\n\r\nIn the April number of _The Christian Science Journal_\r\nyou will find the forthcoming completion (as I now think) [25]\r\nof the divine directions sent out to the churches. It is\r\nsatisfactory to note, however, that the order therein given\r\ncorresponds to the example of our Master. Jesus was\r\nnot ordained as our churches ordain ministers. We\r\nhave no record that he used notes when preaching. He\r\n\r\n[Page 159.]\r\n\r\nspake in their synagogues, reading the Scriptures and [1]\r\nexpounding them; and God has given to this age “Science\r\nand Health with Key to the Scriptures,” to elucidate\r\nHis Word.\r\n\r\nYou may read this letter to your church, and then [5]\r\nsend it to Rev. Mr. Norcross, and he will understand.\r\nMay the God of all grace give you peace.\r\n\r\nWith love,\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract From A Christmas Letter\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Students_:—My heart has many rooms: one\r\nof these is sacred to the memory of my students. Into\r\nthis upper chamber, where all things are pure and of\r\ngood report,—into this sanctuary of love,—I often\r\nretreat, sit silently, and ponder. In this chamber is [15]\r\nmemory’s wardrobe, where I deposit certain recollec-\r\ntions and rare grand collections once in each year. This\r\nis my Christmas storehouse. Its goods commemorate,\r\n—not so much the Bethlehem babe, as the man of God,\r\nthe risen Christ, and the adult Jesus. Here I deposit [20]\r\nthe gifts that my dear students offer at the shrine of\r\nChristian Science, and to their lone Leader. Here I talk\r\nonce a year,—and this is a bit of what I said in 1890:\r\n“O glorious Truth! O Mother Love! how has the sense\r\nof Thy children grown to behold _Thee_! and how have [25]\r\nmany weary wings sprung upward! and how has our\r\nModel, Christ, been unveiled to us, and to the age!”\r\n\r\nI look at the rich devices in embroidery, silver, gold,\r\nand jewels,—all gifts of Christian Scientists from all\r\nparts of our nation, and some from abroad,—then al- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 160.]\r\n\r\nmost marvel at the power and permanence of affection [1]\r\nunder the _régime_ of Christian Science! Never did grati-\r\ntude and love unite more honestly in uttering the word\r\n_thanks_, than ours at this season. But a mother’s love\r\nbehind words has no language; it may give no material [5]\r\ntoken, but lives steadily on, through time and circum-\r\nstance, as part and paramount portion of her being.\r\n\r\nThus may our lives flow on in the same sweet rhythm\r\nof head and heart, till they meet and mingle in bliss super-\r\nnal. There is a special joy in knowing that one is gaining [10]\r\nconstantly in the knowledge of Truth and divine Love.\r\nYour progress, the past year, has been marked. It satis-\r\nfies my present hope. Of this we rest assured, that every\r\ntrial of our faith in God makes us stronger and firmer in\r\nunderstanding and obedience. [15]\r\n\r\nLovingly yours,\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. SERMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 161.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Christmas Sermon\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivered in Chickering Hall, Boston, Mass., on the\r\nSunday Before Christmas, 1888\r\n\r\nSUBJECT: _The Corporeal and Incorporeal Saviour_\r\n\r\nTEXT: _For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the_ [5]\r\n_government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called_\r\n_Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The_\r\n_Prince of Peace._—ISAIAH ix. 6.\r\n\r\nTo the senses, Jesus was the son of man: in Science,\r\nman is the son of God. The material senses could [10]\r\nnot cognize the Christ, or Son of God: it was Jesus’\r\napproximation to this state of being that made him the\r\nChrist-Jesus, the Godlike, the anointed.\r\n\r\nThe prophet whose words we have chosen for our\r\ntext, prophesied the appearing of this dual nature, as [15]\r\nboth human and divinely endowed, the personal and the\r\nimpersonal Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe only record of our Master as a public benefactor,\r\nor personal Saviour, opens when he was thirty years of\r\nage; owing in part, perhaps, to the Jewish law that none [20]\r\nshould teach or preach in public under that age. Also,\r\nit is natural to conclude that at this juncture he was\r\nspecially endowed with the Holy Spirit; for he was given\r\nthe new name, Messiah, or Jesus Christ,—the God-\r\n\r\n[Page 162.]\r\n\r\nanointed; even as, at times of special enlightenment, [1]\r\nJacob was called Israel; and Saul, Paul.\r\n\r\nThe third event of this eventful period,—a period of\r\nsuch wonderful spiritual import to mankind!—was the\r\nadvent of a higher Christianity. [5]\r\n\r\nFrom this dazzling, God-crowned summit, the Naza-\r\nrene stepped suddenly before the people and their schools\r\nof philosophy; Gnostic, Epicurean, and Stoic. He must\r\nstem these rising angry elements, and walk serenely over\r\ntheir fretted, foaming billows. [10]\r\n\r\nHere the cross became the emblem of Jesus’ history;\r\nwhile the central point of his Messianic mission was peace,\r\ngood will, love, teaching, and healing.\r\n\r\nClad with divine might, he was ready to stem the tide\r\nof Judaism, and prove his power, derived from Spirit, to [15]\r\nbe supreme; lay himself as a lamb upon the altar of\r\nmaterialism, and therefrom rise to his nativity in Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe corporeal Jesus bore our infirmities, and through\r\nhis stripes we are healed. He was the Way-shower, and\r\nsuffered in the flesh, showing mortals how to escape from [20]\r\nthe sins of the flesh.\r\n\r\nThere was no incorporeal Jesus of Nazareth. The\r\nspiritual man, or Christ, was after the similitude of the\r\nFather, without corporeality or finite mind.\r\n\r\nMateriality, worldliness, human pride, or self-will, by [25]\r\ndemoralizing his motives and Christlikeness, would have\r\ndethroned his power as the Christ.\r\n\r\nTo carry out his holy purpose, he must be oblivious of\r\nhuman self.\r\n\r\nOf the lineage of David, like him he went forth, simple [30]\r\nas the shepherd boy, to disarm the Goliath. Panoplied\r\nin the strength of an exalted hope, faith, and understand-\r\n\r\n[Page 163.]\r\n\r\ning, he sought to conquer the three-in-one of error: the [1]\r\nworld, the flesh, and the devil.\r\n\r\nThree years he went about doing good. He had for\r\nthirty years been preparing to heal and teach divinely;\r\nbut his three-years mission was a marvel of glory: its [5]\r\nchaplet, a grave to mortal sense dishonored—from which\r\nsprang a sublime and everlasting victory!\r\n\r\nHe who dated time, the Christian era, and spanned\r\neternity, was the meekest man on earth. He healed\r\nand taught by the wayside, in humble homes: to arrant [10]\r\nhypocrite and to dull disciples he explained the Word\r\nof God, which has since ripened into interpretation\r\nthrough Science.\r\n\r\nHis words were articulated in the language of a de-\r\nclining race, and committed to the providence of God. [15]\r\nIn no one thing seemed he less human and more divine\r\nthan in his unfaltering faith in the immortality of Truth.\r\nReferring to this, he said, “Heaven and earth shall\r\npass away, but my words shall not pass away!” and\r\nthey have not: they still live; and are the basis of divine [20]\r\nliberty, the medium of Mind, the hope of the race.\r\n\r\nOnly three years a personal Saviour! yet the founda-\r\ntions he laid are as eternal as Truth, the chief corner-stone.\r\n\r\nAfter his brief brave struggle, and the crucifixion of [25]\r\nthe corporeal man, the incorporeal Saviour—the Christ\r\nor spiritual idea which leadeth into all Truth—must\r\nneeds come in Christian Science, demonstrating the spir-\r\nitual healing of body and mind.\r\n\r\nThis idea or divine essence was, and is, forever about [30]\r\nthe Father’s business; heralding the Principle of health,\r\nholiness, and immortality.\r\n\r\n[Page 164.]\r\n\r\nIts divine Principle interprets the incorporeal idea, or [1]\r\nSon of God; hence the incorporeal and corporeal are\r\ndistinguished thus: the former is the spiritual idea that\r\nrepresents divine good, and the latter is the human\r\npresentation of goodness in man. The Science of Chris- [5]\r\ntianity, that has appeared in the ripeness of time, re-\r\nveals the incorporeal Christ; and this will continue\r\nto be seen more clearly until it be acknowledged, under-\r\nstood,—and the Saviour, which is Truth, be compre-\r\nhended. [10]\r\n\r\nTo the vision of the Wisemen, this spiritual idea of the\r\nPrinciple of man or the universe, appeared as a star. At\r\nfirst, the babe Jesus seemed small to mortals; but from\r\nthe mount of revelation, the prophet beheld it from the\r\nbeginning as the Redeemer, who would present a wonder- [15]\r\nful manifestation of Truth and Love.\r\n\r\nIn our text Isaiah foretold, “His name shall be called\r\nWonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting\r\nFather, The Prince of Peace.”\r\n\r\nAs the Wisemen grew in the understanding of Christ, [20]\r\nthe spiritual idea, it grew in favor with them. Thus it\r\nwill continue, as it shall become understood, until man\r\nbe found in the actual likeness of his Maker. Their\r\nhighest human concept of the man Jesus, that portrayed\r\nhim as the only Son of God, the only begotten of the [25]\r\nFather, full of grace and Truth, will become so magnified\r\nto human sense, by means of the lens of Science, as to\r\nreveal man collectively, as individually, to be the son of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThe limited view of God’s ideas arose from the testimony [30]\r\nof the senses. Science affords the evidence that God is the\r\nFather of man, of all that is real and eternal. This spir-\r\n\r\n[Page 165.]\r\n\r\nitual idea that the personal Jesus demonstrated, casting [1]\r\nout evils and healing, more than eighteen centuries ago,\r\ndisappeared by degrees; both because of the ascension\r\nof Jesus, in which it was seen that he had grown beyond\r\nthe human sense of him, and because of the corruption of [5]\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nThe last appearing of Truth will be a wholly spiritual\r\nidea of God and of man, without the fetters of the flesh, or\r\ncorporeality. This infinite idea of infinity will be, is, as\r\neternal as its divine Principle. The daystar of this appear- [10]\r\ning is the light of Christian Science—the Science which\r\nrends the veil of the flesh from top to bottom. The light\r\nof this revelation leaves nothing that is material; neither\r\ndarkness, doubt, disease, nor death. The material cor-\r\nporeality disappears; and individual spirituality, perfect [15]\r\nand eternal, appears—never to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe truth uttered and lived by Jesus, who passed on\r\nand left to mortals the rich legacy of what he said and\r\ndid, makes his followers the heirs to his example; but\r\nthey can neither appreciate nor appropriate his treasures [20]\r\nof Truth and Love, until lifted to these by their own\r\ngrowth and experiences. His goodness and grace pur-\r\nchased the means of mortals’ redemption from sin; but,\r\nthey never paid the price of sin. This cost, none but the\r\nsinner can pay; and accordingly as this account is settled [25]\r\nwith divine Love, is the sinner ready to avail himself of\r\nthe rich blessings flowing from the teaching, example,\r\nand suffering of our Master.\r\n\r\nThe secret stores of wisdom must be discovered, their\r\ntreasures reproduced and given to the world, before man [30]\r\ncan truthfully conclude that he has been found in the\r\norder, mode, and virgin origin of man according to divine\r\n\r\n[Page 166.]\r\n\r\nScience, which alone demonstrates the divine Principle [1]\r\nand spiritual idea of being.\r\n\r\nThe monument whose finger points upward, commemorates\r\nthe earthly life of a martyr; but this is not all of\r\nthe philanthropist, hero, and Christian. The Truth he [5]\r\nhas taught and spoken lives, and moves in our midst a\r\ndivine afflatus. Thus it is that the ideal Christ—or\r\nimpersonal infancy, manhood, and womanhood of Truth\r\nand Love—is still with us.\r\n\r\nAnd what of _this_ child?—“For unto us a child _is_ [10]\r\nborn, unto us a son _is_ given: and the government shall\r\nbe upon his shoulder.”\r\n\r\nThis child, or spiritual idea, has evolved a more ready\r\near for the overture of angels and the scientific under-\r\nstanding of Truth and Love. When Christ, the incor- [15]\r\nporeal idea of God, was nameless, and a Mary knew not\r\nhow to declare its spiritual origin, the idea of man was\r\nnot understood. The Judæan religion even required the\r\nVirgin-mother to go to the temple and be purified, for\r\nhaving given birth to the corporeal child Jesus, whose [20]\r\norigin was more spiritual than the senses could inter-\r\npret. Like the leaven that a certain woman hid in three\r\nmeasures of meal, the Science of God and the spiritual\r\nidea, named in this century Christian Science, is leaven-\r\ning the lump of human thought, until the whole shall [25]\r\nbe leavened and all materialism disappear. This action\r\nof the divine energy, even if not acknowledged, has\r\ncome to be seen as diffusing richest blessings. This\r\nspiritual idea, or Christ, entered into the minutiæ of the\r\nlife of the personal Jesus. It made him an honest man, [30]\r\na good carpenter, and a good man, before it could make\r\nhim the glorified.\r\n\r\n[Page 167.]\r\n\r\nThe material questions at this age on the reappearing [1]\r\nof the infantile thought of God’s man, are after the man-\r\nner of a mother in the flesh, though their answers per-\r\ntain to the spiritual idea, as in Christian Science:—\r\n\r\nIs he deformed? [5]\r\n\r\nHe is wholly symmetrical; the one altogether lovely.\r\n\r\nIs the babe a son, or daughter?\r\n\r\nBoth son and daughter: even the compound idea of\r\nall that resembles God.\r\n\r\nHow much does he weigh? [10]\r\n\r\nHis substance outweighs the material world.\r\n\r\nHow old is he?\r\n\r\nOf his days there is no beginning and no ending.\r\n\r\nWhat is his name?\r\n\r\nChrist Science. [15]\r\n\r\nWho are his parents, brothers, and sisters?\r\n\r\nHis Father and Mother are divine Life, Truth, and\r\nLove; and they who do the will of his Father are his is\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nIs he heir to an estate? [20]\r\n\r\n“The government shall be upon his shoulder!” He\r\nhas dominion over the whole earth; and in admiration\r\nof his origin, he exclaims, “I thank Thee, O Father, Lord\r\nof heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things\r\nfrom the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto [25]\r\nbabes!”\r\n\r\nIs he wonderful?\r\n\r\nHis works thus prove him. He giveth power, peace,\r\nand holiness; he exalteth the lowly; he giveth liberty\r\n\r\n[Page 168.]\r\n\r\nto the captive, health to the sick, salvation from sin to [1]\r\nthe sinner—and overcometh the world!\r\n\r\nGo, and tell what things ye shall see and hear: how\r\nthe blind, spiritually and physically, receive sight; how\r\nthe lame, those halting between two opinions or hob- [5]\r\nbling on crutches, walk; how the physical and moral\r\nlepers are cleansed; how the deaf—those who, having\r\nears, hear not, and are afflicted with “tympanum on the\r\nbrain”—hear; how the dead, those buried in dogmas\r\nand physical ailments, are raised; that to the poor— [10]\r\nthe lowly in Christ, not the man-made rabbi—the\r\ngospel is preached. Note this: only such as are pure\r\nin spirit, emptied of vainglory and vain knowledge, re-\r\nceive Truth.\r\n\r\nHere ends the colloquy; and a voice from heaven seems [15]\r\nto say, “Come and see.”\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth-century prophets repeat, “Unto us a\r\nson is given.”\r\n\r\nThe shepherds shout, “We behold the appearing of\r\nthe star!”—and the pure in heart clap their hands. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor’s Extracts From Sermon\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXT: _Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of_\r\n_God._—MATT. xxii. 29.\r\n\r\n_The Christian Science Journal_ reported as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe announcement that the Rev. Mary B. G. Eddy [25]\r\nwould speak before the Scientist denomination on the\r\nafternoon of October 26, drew a large audience. Haw-\r\nthorne Hall was densely packed, and many had to go\r\naway unable to obtain seats. The distinguished speaker\r\nbegan by saying:— [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 169.]\r\n\r\nWithin Bible pages she had found all the divine Science [1]\r\nshe preaches; noticing, all along the way of her researches\r\ntherein, that whenever her thoughts had wandered into\r\nthe bypaths of ancient philosophies or pagan literatures,\r\nher spiritual insight had been darkened thereby, till [5]\r\nshe was God-driven back to the inspired pages. Early\r\ntraining, through the misinterpretation of the Word,\r\nhad been the underlying cause of the long years of in-\r\nvalidism she endured before Truth dawned upon her\r\nunderstanding, through right interpretation. With the [10]\r\nunderstanding of Scripture-meanings, had come physical\r\nrejuvenation. The uplifting of spirit was the upbuild-\r\ning of the body.\r\n\r\nShe affirmed that the Scriptures cannot properly be\r\ninterpreted in a literal way. The truths they teach must [15]\r\nbe spiritually discerned, before their message can be\r\nborne fully to our minds and hearts. That there is a\r\ndual meaning to every Biblical passage, the most eminent\r\ndivines of the world have concluded; and to get at the\r\nhighest, or metaphysical, it is necessary rightly to read [20]\r\nwhat the inspired writers left for our spiritual instruction.\r\nThe literal rendering of the Scriptures makes them noth-\r\ning valuable, but often is the foundation of unbelief and\r\nhopelessness. The metaphysical rendering is health and\r\npeace and hope for all. The literal or material reading is [25]\r\nthe reading of the carnal mind, which is enmity toward\r\nGod, Spirit.\r\n\r\nTaking several Bible passages, Mrs. Eddy showed how\r\nbeautiful and inspiring are the thoughts when rightly\r\nunderstood. “Let the dead bury their dead; follow [30]\r\nthou me,” was one of the passages explained metaphysi-\r\ncally. In their fullest meaning, those words are salvation\r\n\r\n[Page 170.]\r\n\r\nfrom the belief of death, the last enemy to be overthrown; [1]\r\nfor by following Christ truly, resurrection and life im-\r\nmortal are brought to us. If we follow him, to us there\r\ncan be no dead. Those who know not this, may still\r\nbelieve in death and weep over the graves of their beloved; [5]\r\nbut with him is Life eternal, which never changes to\r\ndeath. The eating of bread and drinking of wine at the\r\nLord’s supper, merely symbolize the spiritual refresh-\r\nment of God’s children having rightly read His Word,\r\nwhose entrance into their understanding is healthful life. [10]\r\nThis is the reality behind the symbol.\r\n\r\nSo, also, she spoke of the hades, or hell of Scripture,\r\nsaying, that we make our own heavens and our own hells,\r\nby right and wise, or wrong and foolish, conceptions of\r\nGod and our fellow-men. Jesus interpreted all spirit- [15]\r\nually: “I have bread to eat that ye know not of,” he\r\nsaid. The bread he ate, which was refreshment of divine\r\nstrength, we also may all partake of.\r\n\r\nThe material record of the Bible, she said, is no more\r\nimportant to our well-being than the history of Europe [20]\r\nand America; but the spiritual application bears upon\r\nour eternal life. The method of Jesus was purely meta-\r\nphysical; and no other method is Christian Science. In\r\nthe passage recording Jesus’ proceedings with the blind\r\nman (Mark viii.) he is said to have spat upon the dust. [25]\r\nSpitting was the Hebrew method of expressing the utmost\r\ncontempt. So Jesus is recorded as having expressed\r\ncontempt for the belief of material eyes as having any\r\npower to see. Having eyes, ye see not; and ears, ye hear\r\nnot, he had just told them. The putting on of hands [30]\r\nmentioned, she explained as the putting forth of power.\r\n“Hand,” in Bible usage, often means spiritual power.\r\n\r\n[Page 171.]\r\n\r\n“His hand is not shortened that it cannot save,” can [1]\r\nnever be wrested from its true meaning to signify human\r\nhands. Jesus’ first effort to realize Truth was not wholly\r\nsuccessful; but he rose to the occasion with the second\r\nattempt, and the blind saw clearly. To suppose that [5]\r\nJesus did actually anoint the blind man’s eyes with his\r\nspittle, is as absurd as to think, according to the report\r\nof some, that Christian Scientists sit in back-to-back\r\nseances with their patients, for the divine power to filter\r\nfrom vertebræ to vertebræ. When one comes to the age [10]\r\nwith spiritual translations of God’s messages, expressed\r\nin literal or physical terms, our right action is not to con-\r\ndemn and deny, but to “try the spirits” and see what\r\nmanner they are of. This does not mean communing\r\nwith spirits supposed to have departed from the earth, [15]\r\nbut the seeking out of the basis upon which are accom-\r\nplished the works by which the new teacher would prove\r\nhis right to be heard. By these signs are the true disciples\r\nof the Master known: the sick are healed; to the poor\r\nthe gospel is preached. [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract From A Sermon Delivered In Boston, January 18, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXT: _The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman_\r\n_took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was\r\n            leavened._—MATT.\r\nxiii. 33.\r\n\r\nFew people at present know aught of the Science of\r\nmental healing; and so many are obtruding upon the\r\npublic attention their ignorance or false knowledge in\r\nthe name of Science, that it behooves all clad in the shin-\r\ning mail to keep bright their invincible armor; to keep [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 172.]\r\n\r\ntheir demonstrations modest, and their claims and lives [1]\r\nsteadfast in Truth.\r\n\r\nDispensing the Word charitably, but separating the\r\ntares from the wheat, let us declare the positive and\r\nthe negative of metaphysical Science; what it is, and [5]\r\nwhat it is not. Intrepid, self-oblivious Protestants in\r\na higher sense than ever before, let us meet and defeat\r\nthe claims of sense and sin, regardless of the bans or\r\nclans pouring in their fire upon us; and white-winged\r\ncharity, brooding over all, shall cover with her feathers [10]\r\nthe veriest sinner.\r\n\r\nDivine and unerring Mind measures man, until the\r\nthree measures be accomplished, and he arrives at\r\nfulness of stature; for “the Lord God omnipotent\r\nreigneth.” [15]\r\n\r\nScience is divine: it is neither of human origin nor of\r\nhuman direction. That which is termed “natural science,”\r\nthe evidences whereof are taken in by the five personal\r\nsenses, presents but a finite, feeble sense of the infinite\r\nlaw of God; which law is written on the heart, received [20]\r\nthrough the affections, spiritually understood, and dem-\r\nonstrated in our lives.\r\n\r\nThis law of God is the Science of mental healing,\r\nspiritually discerned, understood, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nMental Science, and the five personal senses, are at [25]\r\nwar; and peace can only be declared on the side of im-\r\nmutable right,—the health, holiness, and immortality\r\nof man. To gain this scientific result, the first and funda-\r\nmental rule of Science must be understood and adhered\r\nto; namely, the oft-repeated declaration in Scripture [30]\r\nthat God is good; hence, good is omnipotent and\r\nomnipresent.\r\n\r\n[Page 173.]\r\n\r\nAncient and modern philosophy, human reason, or [1]\r\nman’s theorems, misstate mental Science, its Principle\r\nand practice. The most enlightened sense herein sees\r\nnothing but a law of matter.\r\n\r\nWho has ever learned of the schools that there is but [5]\r\none Mind, and that this is God, who healeth all our sick-\r\nness and sins?\r\n\r\nWho has ever learned from the schools, pagan phi-\r\nlosophy, or scholastic theology, that Science is the law of\r\nMind and not of matter, and that this law has no relation [10]\r\nto, or recognition of, matter?\r\n\r\nMind is its own great cause and effect. Mind is God,\r\nomnipotent and omnipresent. What, then, of an oppo-\r\nsite so-called science, which says that man is both matter\r\nand mind, that Mind is in matter? Can the infinite [15]\r\nbe within the finite? And must not man have preexisted\r\nin the All and Only? Does an evil mind exist without\r\nspace to occupy, power to act, or vanity to pretend that\r\nit is man?\r\n\r\nIf God is Mind and fills all space, is everywhere, matter [20]\r\nis nowhere and sin is obsolete. If Mind, God, is all-power\r\nand all-presence, man is not met by another power\r\nand presence, that—obstructing his intelligence—\r\npains, fetters, and befools him. The perfection of man\r\nis intact; whence, then, is something besides Him that [25]\r\nis not the counterpart but the counterfeit of man’s creator?\r\nSurely not from God, for He made man in His own\r\nlikeness. Whence, then, is the atom or molecule called\r\nmatter? Have attraction and cohesion formed it?\r\nBut are these forces laws of matter, or laws of [30]\r\nMind?\r\n\r\nFor matter to be matter, it must have been self-created.\r\n\r\n[Page 174.]\r\n\r\nMind has no more power to evolve or to create matter [1]\r\nthan has good to produce evil. Matter is a misstatement\r\nof Mind; it is a lie, claiming to talk and disclaim against\r\nTruth; idolatry, having other gods; evil, having presence\r\nand power over omnipotence! [5]\r\n\r\nLet us have a clearing up of abstractions. Let us\r\ncome into the presence of Him who removeth all iniqui-\r\nties, and healeth all our diseases. Let us attach our sense\r\nof Science to what touches the religious sentiment within\r\nman. Let us open our affections to the Principle that [10]\r\nmoves all in harmony,—from the falling of a sparrow\r\nto the rolling of a world. Above Arcturus and his sons,\r\nbroader than the solar system and higher than the at-\r\nmosphere of our planet, is the Science of mental\r\nhealing. [15]\r\n\r\nWhat is the kingdom of heaven? The abode of Spirit,\r\nthe realm of the real. No matter is there, no night is\r\nthere—nothing that maketh or worketh a lie. Is this\r\nkingdom afar off? No: it is ever-present here. The\r\nfirst to declare against this kingdom is matter. Shall [20]\r\nthat be called heresy which pleads for Spirit—the All of\r\nGod, and His omnipresence?\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of heaven is the reign of divine Science:\r\nit is a mental state. Jesus said it is within you, and\r\ntaught us to pray, “Thy kingdom come;” but he did [25]\r\nnot teach us to pray for death whereby to gain heaven.\r\nWe do not look into darkness for light. Death can never\r\nusher in the dawn of Science that reveals the spiritual\r\nfacts of man’s Life here and now.\r\n\r\nThe leaven which a woman took and hid in three [30]\r\nmeasures of meal, is Divine Science; the Comforter;\r\nthe Holy Ghost that leadeth into all Truth; the “still,\r\n\r\n[Page 175.]\r\n\r\nsmall voice” that breathes His presence and power, cast- [1]\r\ning out error and healing the sick. And woman, the\r\nspiritual idea, takes of the things of God and showeth\r\nthem unto the creature, until the whole sense of being\r\nis leavened with Spirit. The three measures of meal [5]\r\nmay well be likened to the false sense of life, substance,\r\nand intelligence, which says, I am sustained by bread,\r\nmatter, instead of Mind. The spiritual leaven of divine\r\nScience changes this false sense, giving better views of\r\nLife; saying, Man’s Life is God; and when this shall [10]\r\nappear, it shall be “the substance of things hoped for.”\r\n\r\nThe measure of Life shall increase by every spiritual\r\ntouch, even as the leaven expands the loaf. Man shall\r\nkeep the feast of Life, not with the old leaven of the\r\nscribes and Pharisees, neither with “the leaven of malice [15]\r\nand wickedness; but the unleavened bread of sincerity\r\nand truth.”\r\n\r\nThus it can be seen that the Science of mental healing\r\nmust be understood. There are false Christs that would\r\n“deceive, if it were possible, the very elect,” by institut- [20]\r\ning matter and its methods in place of God, Mind. Their\r\nsupposition is, that there are other minds than His; that\r\none mind controls another; that one belief takes the\r\nplace of another. But this ism of to-day has nothing\r\nto do with the Science of mental healing which acquaints [25]\r\nus with God and reveals the one perfect Mind and His\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to mix matter and Mind, to work by\r\nmeans of both animal magnetism and divine power, is\r\nliterally saying, Have we not in thy name cast out devils, [30]\r\nand done many wonderful works?\r\n\r\nBut remember God in all thy ways, and thou shalt\r\n\r\n[Page 176.]\r\n\r\nfind the truth that breaks the dream of sense, letting the [1]\r\nharmony of Science that declares _Him_, come in with\r\nhealing, and peace, and perfect love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday Services on July Fourth\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTEMPORE REMARKS\r\n\r\nThe great theme so deeply and solemnly expounded\r\nby the preacher, has been exemplified in all ages, but\r\nchiefly in the great crises of nations or of the human race.\r\nIt is then that supreme devotion to Principle has espe-\r\ncially been called for and manifested. It is then that we [10]\r\nlearn a little more of the nothingness of evil, and more\r\nof the divine energies of good, and strive valiantly for the\r\nliberty of the sons of God.\r\n\r\nThe day we celebrate reminds us of the heroes and\r\nheroines who counted not their own lives dear to them, [15]\r\nwhen they sought the New England shores, not as the\r\nflying nor as conquerors, but, steadfast in faith and love,\r\nto build upon the rock of Christ, the true idea of God—\r\nthe supremacy of Spirit and the nothingness of matter.\r\nWhen first the Pilgrims planted their feet on Plymouth [20]\r\nRock, frozen ritual and creed should forever have melted\r\naway in the fire of love which came down from heaven.\r\nThe Pilgrims came to establish a nation in true freedom,\r\nin the rights of conscience.\r\n\r\nBut what of ourselves, and our times and obligations? [25]\r\nAre we duly aware of our own great opportunities and\r\nresponsibilities? Are we prepared to meet and improve\r\nthem, to act up to the acme of divine energy wherewith\r\nwe are armored?\r\n\r\n[Page 177.]\r\n\r\nNever was there a more solemn and imperious call [1]\r\nthan God makes to us all, right here, for fervent de-\r\nvotion and an absolute consecration to the greatest and\r\nholiest of all causes. The hour is come. The great\r\nbattle of Armageddon is upon us. The powers of evil [5]\r\nare leagued together in secret conspiracy against the\r\nLord and against His Christ, as expressed and opera-\r\ntive in Christian Science. Large numbers, in desperate\r\nmalice, are engaged day and night in organizing action\r\nagainst us. Their feeling and purpose are deadly, and [10]\r\nthey have sworn enmity against the lives of our standard-\r\nbearers.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do about it? Will you be equally in\r\nearnest for the truth? Will you doff your lavender-kid\r\nzeal, and become real and consecrated warriors? Will [15]\r\nyou give yourselves wholly and irrevocably to the great\r\nwork of establishing the truth, the gospel, and the Science\r\nwhich are necessary to the salvation of the world from\r\nerror, sin, disease, and death? Answer at once and practi-\r\ncally, and answer aright! [20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster Services\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of _The Christian Science Journal_ said that\r\nat three o’clock, the hour for the church service proper,\r\nthe pastor, Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy, accompanied\r\nby Rev. D. A. Easton, who was announced to preach [25]\r\nthe sermon, came on the platform. The pastor introduced\r\nMr. Easton as follows:—\r\n\r\n_Friends_:—The homesick traveller in foreign lands\r\ngreets with joy a familiar face. I am constantly home-\r\nsick for heaven. In my long journeyings I have met [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 178.]\r\n\r\none who comes from the place of my own sojourning [1]\r\nfor many years,—the Congregational Church. He is\r\na graduate of Bowdoin College and of Andover The-\r\nological School. He has left his old church, as I did,\r\nfrom a yearning of the heart; because he was not sat- [5]\r\nisfied with a manlike God, but wanted to become a God-\r\nlike man. He found that the new wine could not be\r\nput into old bottles without bursting them, and he came\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nMr. Easton then delivered an interesting discourse [10]\r\nfrom the text, “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek\r\nthose things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the\r\nright hand of God” (Col. iii. 1), which he prefaced by\r\nsaying:—\r\n\r\n“I think it was about a year ago that I strayed into [15]\r\nthis hall, a stranger, and wondered what sort of people\r\nyou were, and of what you were worshippers. If any\r\none had said to me that to-day I should stand before\r\nyou to preach a sermon on Christian Science, I should\r\nhave replied, “Much learning”—or something else— [20]\r\n“hath made thee mad.” If I had not found Christian\r\nScience a new gospel, I should not be standing before you:\r\nif I had not found it truth, I could not have stood up\r\nagain _to_ preach, here or elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the sermon, the pastor again came [25]\r\nforward, and added the following:—\r\n\r\nMy friends, I wished to be excused from speaking\r\nto-day, but will yield to circumstances. In the flesh, we\r\nare as a partition wall between the old and the new;\r\nbetween the old religion in which we have been educated, [30]\r\nand the new, living, impersonal Christ-thought that has\r\nbeen given to the world to-day.\r\n\r\n[Page 179.]\r\n\r\nThe old churches are saying, “He is not here;” and, [1]\r\n“Who shall roll away the stone?”\r\n\r\nThe stone has been rolled away by human suffer-\r\ning. The first rightful desire in the hour of loss, when\r\nbelieving we have lost sight of Truth, is to know where [5]\r\nHe is laid. This appeal resolves itself into these\r\nquestions:—\r\n\r\nIs our consciousness in matter or in God? Have we\r\nany other consciousness than that of good? If we have,\r\nHe is saying to us to-day, “Adam, where art thou?” We [10]\r\nare wrong if our consciousness is in sin, sickness, and\r\ndeath. This is the old consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn the new religion the teaching is, “He is not here;\r\nTruth is not in matter; he is risen; Truth has become\r\nmore to us,—more true, more spiritual.” [15]\r\n\r\nCan we say this to-day? Have we left the conscious-\r\nness of sickness and sin for that of health and\r\nholiness?\r\n\r\nWhat is it that seems a stone between us and the\r\nresurrection morning? [20]\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of mind in matter. We can only come\r\ninto the spiritual resurrection by quitting the old con-\r\nsciousness of Soul in sense.\r\n\r\nThese flowers are floral apostles. God does all this\r\nthrough His followers; and He made every flower in [25]\r\nMind before it sprang from the earth: yet we look into\r\nmatter and the earth to give us these smiles of God!\r\n\r\nWe must lay aside material consciousness, and then\r\nwe can perceive Truth, and say with Mary, “Rabboni!”\r\n—Master! [30]\r\n\r\nIn 1866, when God revealed to me this risen Christ,\r\nthis Life that knows no death, that saith, “Because he\r\n\r\n[Page 180.]\r\n\r\nlives, I live,” I awoke from the dream of Spirit in the [1]\r\nflesh so far as to take the side of Spirit, and strive to cease\r\nmy warfare.\r\n\r\nWhen, through this consciousness, I was delivered from\r\nthe dark shadow and portal of death, my friends were [5]\r\nfrightened at beholding me restored to health.\r\n\r\nA dear old lady asked me, “How is it that you are\r\nrestored to us? Has Christ come again on earth?”\r\n\r\n“Christ never left,” I replied; “Christ is Truth, and\r\nTruth is always here,—the impersonal Saviour.” [10]\r\n\r\nThen another person, more material, met me, and I\r\nsaid, in the words of my Master, “Touch me not.” I\r\nshuddered at her material approach; then my heart went\r\nout to God, and I found the open door from this sepulchre\r\nof matter. [15]\r\n\r\nI _love_ the Easter service: it speaks to me of Life, and\r\nnot of death.\r\n\r\nLet us do our work; then we shall have part in his\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBible Lessons\r\n\r\n\r\n_But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the_\r\n_sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born,_\r\n_not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but\r\n            of_\r\n_God._—JOHN i. 12, 13.\r\n\r\nHere, the apostle assures us that man has power to [25]\r\nbecome the son of God. In the Hebrew text, the word\r\n“son” is defined variously; a month is called the son\r\nof a year. This term, as applied to man, is used in both\r\na material and a spiritual sense. The Scriptures speak\r\nof Jesus as the Son of God and the Son of man; but [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 181.]\r\n\r\nJesus said to call no man father; “for one is your Father,” [1]\r\neven God.\r\n\r\nIs man’s spiritual sonship a personal gift to man, or\r\nis it the reality of his being, in divine Science? Man’s\r\nknowledge of this grand verity gives him power to dem- [5]\r\nonstrate his divine Principle, which in turn is requisite\r\nin order to understand his sonship, or unity with God,\r\ngood. A personal requirement of blind obedience to\r\nthe law of being, would tend to obscure the order of\r\nScience, unless that requirement should express the claims [10]\r\nof the divine Principle. Infinite Principle and infinite\r\nSpirit must be one. What avail, then, to quarrel over\r\nwhat is the person of Spirit,—if we recognize infinitude\r\nas personality,—for who can tell what is the form of\r\ninfinity? When we understand man’s true birthright, that [15]\r\nhe is “born, not ... of the will of the flesh, nor of the\r\nwill of man, but of God,” we shall understand that man\r\nis the offspring of Spirit, and not of the flesh; recognize\r\nhim through spiritual, and not material laws; and regard\r\nhim as spiritual, and not material. His sonship, referred [20]\r\nto in the text, is his spiritual relation to Deity: it is not,\r\nthen, a personal gift, but is the order of divine Science.\r\nThe apostle urges upon our acceptance this great fact:\r\n“But as many as received him, to them gave he power\r\nto become the sons of God.” Mortals will lose their sense [25]\r\nof mortality—disease, sickness, sin, and death—in\r\nthe proportion that they gain the sense of man’s spirit-\r\nual preexistence as God’s child; as the offspring of\r\ngood, and not of God’s opposite,—evil, or a fallen\r\nman. [30]\r\n\r\nJohn the Baptist had a clear discernment of divine\r\nScience: being born not of the human will or flesh, he\r\n\r\n[Page 182.]\r\n\r\nantedated his own existence, began spiritually instead [1]\r\nof materially to reckon himself logically; hence the im-\r\npossibility of putting him to death, only in belief, through\r\nviolent means or material methods.\r\n\r\n“As many as received him;” that is, as many as per-\r\nceive man’s actual existence in and of his divine Princi- [5]\r\nple, receive the Truth of existence; and these have no\r\nother God, no other Mind, no other origin; therefore, in\r\ntime they lose their false sense of existence, and find\r\ntheir adoption with the Father; to wit, the redemption [10]\r\nof the body. Through divine Science man gains the\r\npower to become the son of God, to recognize his perfect\r\nand eternal estate.\r\n\r\n“Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of\r\nthe flesh.” This passage refers to man’s primal, spirit- [15]\r\nual existence, created neither from dust nor carnal desire.\r\n“Nor of the will of man.” Born of no doctrine,\r\nno human faith, but beholding the truth of being; even\r\nthe understanding that man was never lost in Adam,\r\nsince he is and ever was the image and likeness of God, [20]\r\ngood. But no mortal hath seen the spiritual man, more\r\nthan he hath seen the Father. The apostle indicates\r\nno personal plan of a personal Jehovah, partial and finite;\r\nbut the possibility of all finding their place in God’s great\r\nlove, the eternal heritage of the Elohim, His sons and [25]\r\ndaughters. The text is a metaphysical statement of existence\r\nas Principle and idea, wherein man and his Maker\r\nare inseparable and eternal.\r\n\r\nWhen the Word is made flesh,—that is, rendered\r\npractical,—this eternal Truth will be understood; and [30]\r\nsickness, sin, and death will yield to it, even as they did\r\nmore than eighteen centuries ago. The lusts of the flesh\r\n\r\n[Page 183.]\r\n\r\nand the pride of life will then be quenched in the divine [1]\r\nScience of being; in the ever-present good, omnipotent\r\nLove, and eternal Life, that know no death, In the great\r\nforever, the verities of being exist, and must be acknowl-\r\nedged and demonstrated. Man must love his neighbor [5]\r\nas himself, and the power of Truth must be seen and\r\nfelt in health, happiness, and holiness: then it will be\r\nfound that Mind is All-in-all, and there is no matter to\r\ncope with.\r\n\r\nMan is free born: he is neither the slave of sense, nor a [10]\r\nsilly ambler to the so-called pleasures and pains of self-\r\nconscious matter. Man is God’s image and likeness;\r\nwhatever is possible to God, is possible to man _as God’s_\r\n_reflection_. Through the transparency of Science we learn\r\nthis, and receive it: learn that man can fulfil the Scrip- [15]\r\ntures in every instance; that if he open his mouth it shall\r\nbe filled—not by reason of the schools, or learning, but\r\nby the natural ability, that reflection already has bestowed\r\non him, to give utterance to Truth.\r\n\r\n“Who hath believed our report?” Who understands [20]\r\nthese sayings? He to whom the arm of the Lord is re-\r\nvealed; to whom divine Science unfolds omnipotence,\r\nthat equips man with divine power while it shames human\r\npride. Asserting a selfhood apart from God, is a denial\r\nof man’s spiritual sonship; for it claims another father. [25]\r\nAs many as do receive a knowledge of God through\r\nScience, will have power to reflect His power, in proof of\r\nman’s “dominion over all the earth.” He is bravely\r\nbrave who dares at this date refute the evidence of material\r\nsense with the facts of Science, and will arrive at the true [30]\r\nstatus of man because of it. The material senses would\r\nmake man, that the Scriptures declare reflects his Maker,\r\n\r\n[Page 184.]\r\n\r\nthe very opposite of that Maker, by claiming that God is [1]\r\nSpirit, while man is matter; that God is good, but man is\r\nevil; that Deity is deathless, but man dies. Science and\r\nsense conflict, from the revolving of worlds to the death\r\nof a sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe Word will be made flesh and dwell among mortals,\r\nonly when man reflects God in body as well as in mind.\r\nThe child born of a woman has the formation of his\r\nparents; the man born of Spirit is spiritual, not material.\r\nPaul refers to this when speaking of presenting our bodies [10]\r\nholy and acceptable, which is our reasonable service;\r\nand this brings to remembrance the Hebrew strain,\r\n“Who healeth all thy diseases.”\r\n\r\nIf man should say of the power to be perfect which he\r\npossesses, “I am the power,” he would trespass upon [15]\r\ndivine Science, yield to material sense, and lose his power;\r\neven as when saying, “I have the power to sin and be\r\nsick,” and persisting in believing that he is sick and a\r\nsinner. If he says, “I am of God, therefore good,” yet\r\npersists in evil, he has denied the power of Truth, and [20]\r\nmust suffer for this error until he learns that all power is\r\ngood because it is of God, and so destroys his self-de-\r\nceived sense of power in evil. The Science of being gives\r\nback the lost likeness and power of God as the seal of\r\nman’s adoption. Oh, for that light and love ineffable, [25]\r\nwhich casteth out all fear, all sin, sickness, and death;\r\nthat seeketh not her own, but another’s good; that saith\r\nAbba, Father, and _is_ born of God!\r\n\r\nJohn came baptizing with water. He employed a type\r\nof physical cleanliness to foreshadow metaphysical purity, [30]\r\neven mortal mind purged of the animal and human, and\r\nsubmerged in the humane and divine, giving back the\r\n\r\n[Page 185.]\r\n\r\nlost sense of man in unity with, and reflecting, his Maker. [1]\r\nNone but the pure in heart shall see God,—shall be able\r\nto discern fully and demonstrate fairly the divine Principle\r\nof Christian Science. The will of God, or power of Spirit,\r\nis made manifest as Truth, and through righteousness,— [5]\r\nnot as or through matter,—and it strips matter of all\r\nclaims, abilities or disabilities, pains or pleasures. Self-\r\nrenunciation of all that constitutes a so-called material\r\nman, and the acknowledgment and achievement of his\r\nspiritual identity as the child of God, is Science that [10]\r\nopens the very flood-gates of heaven; whence good\r\nflows into every avenue of being, cleansing mortals of\r\nall uncleanness, destroying all suffering, and demon-\r\nstrating the true image and likeness. There is no other\r\nway under heaven whereby we can be saved, and man [15]\r\nbe clothed with might, majesty, and immortality.\r\n\r\n“As many as received him,”—as accept the truth\r\nof being,—“to them gave he power to become the sons\r\nof God.” The spiritualization of our sense of man opens\r\nthe gates of paradise that the so-called material senses [20]\r\nwould close, and reveals man infinitely blessed, upright,\r\npure, and free; having no need of statistics by which to\r\nlearn his origin and age, or to measure his manhood, or to\r\nknow how much of a man he ever has been: for, “as\r\nmany as received him, to them gave he power to become [25]\r\nthe sons of God.”\r\n\r\n_And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;_\r\n_the last Adam was made a quickening spirit._—1 COR. xv. 45.\r\n\r\nWhen reasoning on this subject of man with the Corin-\r\nthian brethren, the apostle first spake from their stand- [30]\r\npoint of thought; namely, that creation is material:\r\n\r\n[Page 186.]\r\n\r\nhe was not at this point giving the history of the spiritual [1]\r\nman who originates in God, Love, who created man\r\nin His own image and likeness. In the creation of Adam\r\nfrom dust,—in which Soul is supposed to enter the\r\nembryo-man after his birth,—we see the material self- [5]\r\nconstituted belief of the Jews as referred to by St. Paul.\r\nTheir material belief has fallen far below man’s original\r\nstandard, the spiritual man made in the image and like-\r\nness of God; for this erring belief even separates its\r\nconception of man from God, and ultimates in the opposite [10]\r\nof _im_mortal man, namely, in a sick and sinning\r\nmortal.\r\n\r\nWe learn in the Scriptures, as in divine Science, that\r\nGod made all; that He is the universal Father and Mother\r\nof man; that God is divine Love: therefore divine Love [15]\r\nis the divine Principle of the divine idea named man;\r\nin other words, the spiritual Principle of spiritual man.\r\nNow let us not lose this Science of man, but gain it clearly;\r\nthen we shall see that man cannot be separated from\r\nhis perfect Principle, God, inasmuch as an idea cannot [20]\r\nbe torn apart from its fundamental basis. This scien-\r\ntific knowledge affords self-evident proof of immortality;\r\nproof, also, that the Principle of man cannot produce a\r\nless perfect man than it produced in the beginning. A\r\nmaterial sense of existence is not the scientific fact of [25]\r\nbeing; whereas, the spiritual sense of God and His universe\r\nis the immortal and true sense of being.\r\n\r\nAs the apostle proceeds in this line of thought, he\r\nundoubtedly refers to the last Adam represented by the\r\nMessias, whose demonstration of God restored to mortals [30]\r\nthe lost sense of man’s perfection, even the sense of the\r\nreal man in God’s likeness, who restored this sense by\r\n\r\n[Page 187.]\r\n\r\nthe spiritual regeneration of both mind and body,— [1]\r\ncasting out evils, _healing the sick_, and raising the dead.\r\nThe man Jesus demonstrated over sin, sickness, disease,\r\nand death. The great Metaphysician wrought, over and\r\nabove every sense of matter, into the proper sense of the [5]\r\npossibilities of Spirit. He established health and har-\r\nmony, the perfection of mind and body, as the reality of\r\nman; while discord, as seen in disease and death, was to\r\nhim the opposite of man, hence the unreality; even as in\r\nScience a chord is manifestly the reality of music, and [10]\r\ndiscord the unreality. This rule of harmony must be ac-\r\ncepted as true relative to man.\r\n\r\nThe translators of the older Scriptures presuppose a\r\nmaterial man to be the first man, solely because their\r\ntranscribing thoughts were not lifted to the inspired sense [15]\r\nof the spiritual man, as set forth in original Holy Writ.\r\nHad both writers and translators in that age fully com-\r\nprehended the later teachings and demonstrations of\r\nour human and divine Master, the Old Testament might\r\nhave been as spiritual as the New. [20]\r\n\r\nThe origin, substance, and life of man are one, and\r\nthat one is God,—Life, Truth, Love. The self-existent,\r\nperfect, and eternal are God; and man is their reflection\r\nand glory. Did the substance of God, Spirit, become a\r\nclod, in order to create a sick, sinning, dying man? The [25]\r\nprimal facts of being are eternal; they are never extin-\r\nguished in a night of discord.\r\n\r\nThat man must be evil before he can be good; dying,\r\nbefore deathless; material, before spiritual; sick and a\r\nsinner in order to be healed and saved, is but the declara- [30]\r\ntion of the material senses transcribed by pagan religion-\r\nists, by wicked mortals such as crucified our Master,—\r\n\r\n[Page 188.]\r\n\r\nwhose teachings opposed the doctrines of Christ that [1]\r\ndemonstrated the opposite, Truth.\r\n\r\nMan is as perfect now, and henceforth, and forever,\r\nas when the stars first sang together, and creation joined\r\nin the grand chorus of harmonious being. It is the trans-\r\nlator, not the original Word, who presents as being first [5]\r\nthat which appears second, material, and mortal; and\r\nas last, that which is primal, spiritual, and eternal. Be-\r\ncause of human misstatement and misconception of God\r\nand man, of the divine Principle and idea of being, there [10]\r\nseems to be a war between the flesh and Spirit, a contest\r\nbetween Truth and error; but the apostle says, “There\r\nis therefore now no condemnation to them which are in\r\nChrist Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the\r\nSpirit.” [15]\r\n\r\nOn our subject, St. Paul first reasons upon the basis\r\nof what is seen, the effects of Truth on the material senses;\r\nthence, up to the unseen, the testimony of spiritual sense;\r\nand right there he leaves the subject.\r\n\r\nJust there, in the intermediate line of thought, is where [20]\r\nthe present writer found it, when she discovered Christian\r\nScience. And she has _not_ left it, but continues the ex-\r\nplanation of the power of Spirit up to its infinite meaning,\r\nits allness. The recognition of this power came to her\r\nthrough a spiritual sense of the real, and of the unreal [25]\r\nor mortal sense of things; not that there is, or can\r\nbe, an actual change in the realities of being, but\r\nthat we can discern more of them. At the moment\r\nof her discovery, she knew that the last Adam, namely,\r\nthe true likeness of God, was the first, the only man. [30]\r\nThis knowledge did become to her “a quickening\r\nspirit;” for she beheld the meaning of those words\r\n\r\n[Page 189.]\r\n\r\nof our Master, “The last shall be first, and the first [1]\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\nWhen, as little children, we are receptive, become\r\nwilling to accept the divine Principle and rule of being,\r\nas unfolded in divine Science, the interpretation therein\r\nwill be found to be the Comforter that leadeth into all\r\ntruth. [5]\r\n\r\nThe meek Nazarene’s steadfast and true knowledge of\r\npreexistence, of the nature and the inseparability of God\r\nand man,—made him mighty. Spiritual insight of [10]\r\nTruth and Love antidotes and destroys the errors of flesh,\r\nand brings to light the true reflection: man as God’s\r\nimage, or “the first man,” for Christ plainly declared,\r\nthrough Jesus, “Before Abraham was, I am.”\r\n\r\nThe supposition that Soul, or Mind, is breathed into [15]\r\nmatter, is a pantheistic doctrine that presents a false\r\nsense of existence, and the quickening spirit takes it\r\naway: revealing, in place thereof, the power and per-\r\nfection of a released sense of Life in God and Life _as_\r\nGod. The Scriptures declare Life to be the infinite I [20]\r\nAM,—not a dweller in matter. For man to know Life\r\nas it is, namely God, the eternal good, gives him not\r\nmerely a sense of existence, but an accompanying con-\r\nsciousness of spiritual power that subordinates matter\r\nand destroys sin, disease, and death. This, Jesus demon- [25]\r\nstrated; insomuch that St. Matthew wrote, “The people\r\nwere astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them\r\nas one having authority, and not as the scribes.” This\r\nspiritual power, healing sin and sickness, was not con-\r\nfined to the first century; it extends to all time, inhabits [30]\r\neternity, and demonstrates Life without beginning or\r\nend.\r\n\r\n[Page 190.]\r\n\r\nAtomic action is Mind, not matter. It is neither the [1]\r\nenergy of matter, the result of organization, nor the out-\r\ncome of life infused into matter: it is infinite Spirit, Truth,\r\nLife, defiant of error or matter. Divine Science demon-\r\nstrates Mind as dispelling a false sense and giving the [5]\r\ntrue sense of itself, God, and the universe; wherein the\r\nmortal evolves not the immortal, nor does the material\r\nultimate in the spiritual; wherein man is coexistent with\r\nMind, and is the recognized reflection of infinite Life and\r\nLove. [10]\r\n\r\n_And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to_\r\n_pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake._—LUKE xi. 14.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the term “devil” needs yet to be\r\nlearned. Its definition as an individual is too limited\r\nand contradictory. When the Scripture is understood, [15]\r\nthe spiritual signification of its terms will be understood,\r\nand will contradict the interpretations that the senses\r\ngive them; and these terms will be found to include the\r\ninspired meaning.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been a person that our great Master [20]\r\ncast out of another person; therefore the devil herein\r\nreferred to was an impersonal evil, or whatever worketh\r\nill. In this case it was the evil of dumbness, an error of\r\nmaterial sense, cast out by the spiritual truth of being;\r\nnamely, that speech belongs to Mind instead of matter, [25]\r\nand the wrong power, or the lost sense, must yield to the\r\nright sense, and exist in Mind.\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrew, “devil” is denominated Abaddon; in\r\nthe Greek, Apollyon, serpent, liar, the god of this world,\r\netc. The apostle Paul refers to this personality of evil [30]\r\nas “the god of this world;” and then defines this god\r\n\r\n[Page 191.]\r\n\r\nas “dishonesty, craftiness, handling the word of God [1]\r\ndeceitfully.” The Hebrew embodies the term “devil”\r\nin another term, serpent,—which the senses are supposed\r\nto take in,—and then defines this serpent as “more\r\nsubtle than all the beasts of the field.” Subsequently, [5]\r\nthe ancients changed the meaning of the term, to their\r\nsense, and then the serpent became a symbol of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe Scripture in John, sixth chapter and seventieth\r\nverse, refers to a wicked man as the devil: “Have not\r\nI chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?” Accord- [10]\r\ning to the Scripture, if devil is an individuality, there is\r\nmore than one devil. In Mark, ninth chapter and thirty-\r\neighth verse, it reads: “Master, we saw one casting out\r\ndevils in thy name.” Here is an assertion indicating\r\nthe existence of more than one devil; and by omitting the [15]\r\nfirst letter, the name of his satanic majesty is found\r\nto be evils, apparent wrong traits, that Christ, Truth,\r\ncasts out. By no possible interpretation can this passage\r\nmean several individuals cast out of another individual\r\nno bigger than themselves. The term, being here em- [20]\r\nployed in its plural number, destroys all consistent sup-\r\nposition of the existence of one personal devil. Again,\r\nour text refers to the devil as dumb; but the original\r\ndevil was a great talker, and was supposed to have out-\r\ntalked even Truth, and carried the question with Eve. [25]\r\nAlso, the original texts define him as an “accuser,” a\r\n“calumniator,” which would be impossible if he were\r\nspeechless. These two opposite characters ascribed to\r\nhim could only be possible as evil beliefs, as different\r\nphases of sin or disease made manifest. [30]\r\n\r\nLet us obey St. Paul’s injunction to reject fables, and\r\naccept the Scriptures in their broader, more spiritual\r\n\r\n[Page 192.]\r\n\r\nand practical sense. When we speak of a good man, we [1]\r\ndo not mean that man is God because the Hebrew term\r\nfor Deity was “good,” and _vice versa_; so, when referring\r\nto a liar, we mean not that he is a personal devil, because\r\nthe original text defines devil as a “liar.” [5]\r\n\r\nIt is of infinite importance to man’s spiritual progress,\r\nand to his demonstration of Truth in casting out error,\r\n—sickness, sin, disease, and death, in all their forms,—\r\nthat the terms and nature of Deity and devil be understood.\r\n\r\n_He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and_\r\n_greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father._—\r\nJOHN xiv. 12.\r\n\r\nSuch are the words of him who spake divinely, well\r\nknowing the omnipotence of Truth. The Hebrew bard\r\nsaith, “His name shall endure forever: His name shall [15]\r\nbe continued as long as the sun.” Luminous with the\r\nlight of divine Science, his words reveal the great Principle\r\nof a full salvation. Neither can we question the practi-\r\ncability of the divine Word, who have learned its adapta-\r\nbility to human needs, and man’s ability to prove the [20]\r\ntruth of prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilment of the grand verities of Christian healing\r\nbelongs to every period; as the above Scripture plainly\r\ndeclares, and as primitive Christianity confirms. Also,\r\nthe last chapter of Mark is emphatic on this subject; [25]\r\nmaking healing a condition of salvation, that extends to\r\nall ages and throughout all Christendom. Nothing can\r\nbe more conclusive than this: “And these signs shall\r\nfollow them that believe; ... they shall lay hands on\r\nthe sick, and they shall recover.” This declaration of [30]\r\nour Master settles the question; else we are entertaining\r\n\r\n[Page 193.]\r\n\r\nthe startling inquiries, Are the Scriptures inspired? Are [1]\r\nthey true? Did Jesus mean what he said?\r\n\r\nIf this be the cavil, we reply in the affirmative that the\r\nScripture is true; that Jesus did mean all, and even more\r\nthan he said or deemed it safe to say at that time. His [5]\r\nwords are unmistakable, for they form propositions of\r\nself-evident demonstrable truth. Doctrines that deny\r\nthe substance and practicality of all Christ’s teachings\r\ncannot be evangelical; and evangelical religion can be\r\nestablished on no other claim than the authenticity of [10]\r\nthe Gospels, which support unequivocally the proof that\r\nChristian Science, as defined and practised by Jesus,\r\nheals the sick, casts out error, and will destroy death.\r\n\r\nReferring to The Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston,\r\nof which I am pastor, a certain clergyman charitably [15]\r\nexpressed it, “the so-called Christian Scientists.”\r\n\r\nI am thankful even for his allusion to truth; it being\r\na modification of silence on this subject, and also of what\r\nhad been said when critics attacked me for supplying the\r\nword Science to Christianity,—a word which the people [20]\r\nare now adopting.\r\n\r\nThe next step for ecclesiasticism to take, is to admit\r\nthat all Christians are properly called Scientists who\r\nfollow the commands of our Lord and His Christ, Truth;\r\nand that no one is following his full command without [25]\r\nthis enlarged sense of the spirit and power of Christianity.\r\n“He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do,”\r\nis a radical and unmistakable declaration of the right and\r\npower of Christianity to heal; for this is Christlike,\r\nand includes the understanding of man’s capabilities and [30]\r\nspiritual power. The condition insisted upon is, first,\r\n“belief;” the Hebrew of which implies understanding.\r\n\r\n[Page 194.]\r\n\r\nHow many to-day believe that the power of God equals [1]\r\neven the power of a drug to heal the sick! Divine Science\r\nreveals the Principle of this power, and the rule whereby\r\nsin, sickness, disease, and death are destroyed; and God\r\nis this Principle. Let us, then, seek this Science; that we [5]\r\nmay know Him better, and love Him more.\r\n\r\nThough a man were begirt with the Urim and Thum-\r\nmim of priestly office, yet should deny the validity or\r\npermanence of Christ’s command to heal in all ages,\r\nthis denial would dishonor that office and misinterpret [10]\r\nevangelical religion. Divine Science is not an interpo-\r\nlation of the Scriptures, but is redolent with love, health,\r\nand holiness, for the whole human race. It only needs\r\nthe prism of this Science to divide the rays of Truth, and\r\nbring out the entire hues of Deity, which scholastic theol- [15]\r\nogy has hidden. The lens of Science magnifies the divine\r\npower to human sight; and we then see the supremacy\r\nof Spirit and the nothingness of matter.\r\n\r\nThe context of the foregoing Scriptural text explains\r\nJesus’ words, “because I go unto my Father.” “Because” [20]\r\nin following him, you understand God and _how_ to turn\r\nfrom matter to Spirit for healing; _how_ to leave self, the\r\nsense material, for the sense spiritual; _how_ to accept\r\nGod’s power and guidance, and become imbued with\r\ndivine Love that casts out all fear. Then are you bap- [25]\r\ntized in the Truth that destroys all error, and you receive\r\nthe sense of Life that knows no death, and you _know_ that\r\nGod is the only Life.\r\n\r\nTo reach the consummate naturalness of the Life that\r\nis God, good, we must comply with the first condition [30]\r\nset forth in the text, namely, believe; in other words,\r\nunderstand God sufficiently to exclude all faith in any\r\n\r\n[Page 195.]\r\n\r\nother remedy than Christ, the Truth that antidotes all [1]\r\nerror. Thence will follow the absorption of all action,\r\nmotive, and mind, into the rules and divine Principle of\r\nmetaphysical healing.\r\n\r\nWhosoever learns the letter of Christian Science but [5]\r\npossesses not its spirit, is unable to demonstrate this\r\nScience; or whosoever hath the spirit without the letter,\r\nis held back by reason of the lack of understanding. Both\r\nthe spirit and the letter are requisite; and having these,\r\nevery one can prove, in some degree, the validity of those [10]\r\nwords of the great Master, “For the Son of man is come\r\nto save that which was lost.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the New Testament does not au-\r\nthorize us to expect the ministry of healing at this period.\r\n\r\nWe ask what is the authority for such a conclusion, [15]\r\nthe premises whereof are not to be found in the Scriptures.\r\nThe Master’s divine logic, as seen in our text, contradicts\r\nthis inference,—these are his words: “He that believeth\r\non me, the works that I do shall he do also.” That per-\r\nfect syllogism of Jesus has but one correct premise and [20]\r\nconclusion, and it cannot fall to the ground beneath the\r\nstroke of unskilled swordsmen. He who never unsheathed\r\nhis blade to try the edge of truth in Christian Science, is\r\nunequal to the conflict, and unfit to judge in the case;\r\nthe shepherd’s sling would slay this Goliath. I once be- [25]\r\nlieved that the practice and teachings of Jesus relative to\r\nhealing the sick, were spiritual abstractions, impractical\r\nand impossible to us; but deed, not creed, and practice\r\nmore than theory, have given me a higher sense of\r\nChristianity. [30]\r\n\r\nThe “I” will go to the Father when meekness, purity,\r\nand love, informed by divine Science, the Comforter,\r\n\r\n[Page 196.]\r\n\r\nlead to the one God: then the ego is found not in [1]\r\nmatter but in Mind, for there is but one God, one\r\nMind; and man will then claim no mind apart from God.\r\nIdolatry, the supposition of the existence of many minds\r\nand more than one God, has repeated itself in all manner [5]\r\nof subtleties through the entire centuries, saying as in\r\nthe beginning, “Believe in me, and I will make you as\r\ngods;” that is, I will give you a separate mind from God\r\n(good), named evil; and this so-called mind shall open\r\nyour eyes and make you know evil, and thus become [10]\r\nmaterial, sensual, evil. But bear in mind that a serpent\r\nsaid that; therefore that saying came not from Mind,\r\ngood, or Truth. God was not the author of it; hence the\r\nwords of our Master: “He is a liar, and the father of it;”\r\nalso, the character of the votaries to “other gods” which [15]\r\nsprung from it.\r\n\r\nThe sweet, sacred sense and permanence of man’s\r\nunity with his Maker, in Science, illumines our present\r\nexistence with the ever-presence and power of God, good.\r\nIt opens wide the portals of salvation from sin, sickness, [20]\r\nand death. When the Life that is God, good, shall ap-\r\npear, “we shall be like Him;” we shall do the works of\r\nChrist, and, in the words of David, “the stone which the\r\nbuilders refused is become the head stone of the corner,”\r\nbecause the “I” does go unto the Father, the ego does [25]\r\narise to spiritual recognition of being, and is exalted,—\r\nnot through death, but Life, God understood.\r\n\r\n_Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved._—ACTS\r\nxvi. 31.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures require more than a simple admission [30]\r\nand feeble acceptance of the truths they present; they\r\n\r\n[Page 197.]\r\n\r\nrequire a living faith, that so incorporates their lessons [1]\r\ninto our lives that these truths become the motive-power\r\nof every act.\r\n\r\nur chosen text is one more frequently used than\r\nmany others, perhaps, to exhort people to turn from sin [5]\r\nand to strive after holiness; but we fear the full import\r\nof this text is not yet recognized. It means a _full_ salva-\r\ntion,—man saved from sin, sickness, and death; for,\r\nunless this be so, no man can be wholly fitted for heaven\r\nin the way which Jesus marked out and bade his followers [10]\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the meaning of the text, let\r\nus see what it is to believe. It means more than an opinion\r\nentertained concerning Jesus as a man, as the Son of God,\r\nor as God; such an action of mind would be of no more [15]\r\nhelp to save from sin, than would a belief in any historical\r\nevent or person. But it does mean so to understand the\r\nbeauty of holiness, the character and divinity which Jesus\r\npresented in his power to heal and to save, that it will\r\ncompel us to pattern after both; in other words, to “let [20]\r\nthis Mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”\r\n(Phil. ii. 5.)\r\n\r\nMortal man believes in, but does not understand life\r\nin, Christ. He believes there is another power or intelli-\r\ngence that rules over a kingdom of its own, that is both [25]\r\ngood and evil; yea, that is divided against itself, and there-\r\nfore cannot stand. This belief breaks the First Command-\r\nment of God.\r\n\r\nLet man abjure a theory that is in opposition to God,\r\nrecognize God as omnipotent, having all-power; and, [30]\r\nplacing his trust in this grand Truth, and working from\r\nno other Principle, he can neither be sick nor forever a\r\n\r\n[Page 198.]\r\n\r\nsinner. When wholly governed by the one perfect Mind, [1]\r\nman has no sinful thoughts and will have no desire\r\nto sin.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at this point of unity of Spirit, God, one must\r\ncommence by turning away from material gods; denying [5]\r\nmaterial so-called laws and material sensation,—or mind\r\nin matter, in its varied forms of pleasure and pain. This\r\nmust be done with the understanding that matter has no\r\nsense; thus it is that consciousness silences the mortal\r\nclaim to life, substance, or mind in matter, with the words [10]\r\nof Jesus: “When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his\r\nown.” (John viii. 44.)\r\n\r\nWhen tempted to sin, we should know that evil pro-\r\nceedeth not from God, good, but is a false belief of the\r\npersonal senses; and if we deny the claims of these senses [15]\r\nand recognize man as governed by God, Spirit, not by\r\nmaterial laws, the temptation will disappear.\r\n\r\nOn this Principle, disease also is treated and healed.\r\nWe know that man’s body, as matter, has no power to\r\ngovern itself; and a belief of disease is as much the prod- [20]\r\nuct of mortal thought as sin is. All suffering is the fruit\r\nof the tree of the knowledge of _both_ good and evil; of\r\nadherence to the “doubleminded” senses, to some belief,\r\nfear, theory, or bad deed, based on physical material law,\r\nso-called as opposed to good,—all of which is corrected [25]\r\nalone by Science, divine Principle, and its spiritual laws.\r\nSuffering is the supposition of another intelligence than\r\nGod; a belief in self-existent evil, opposed to good; and\r\nin whatever seems to punish man for doing good,—\r\nby saying he has overworked, suffered from inclement [30]\r\nweather, or violated a law of matter in doing good, there-\r\nfore he must suffer for it.\r\n\r\n[Page 199.]\r\n\r\nGod does not reward benevolence and love with pen- [1]\r\nalties; and because of this, we have the right to deny the\r\nsupposed power of matter to do it, and to allege that only\r\nmortal, erring mind can claim to do thus, and dignify the\r\nresult with the name of law: thence comes man’s ability [5]\r\nto annul his own erring mental law, and to hold himself\r\namenable only to moral and spiritual law,—God’s gov-\r\nernment. By so doing, male and female come into their\r\nrightful heritage, “into the glorious liberty of the children\r\nof God.” [10]\r\n\r\n_Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities,_\r\n_in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake._—2 COR.\r\nxii. 10.\r\n\r\nThe miracles recorded in the Scriptures illustrate the\r\nlife of Jesus as nothing else can; but they cost him the [15]\r\nhatred of the rabbis. The rulers sought the life of Jesus;\r\nthey would extinguish whatever denied and defied their\r\nsuperstition. We learn somewhat of the qualities of the\r\ndivine Mind through the human Jesus. The power of\r\nhis transcendent goodness is manifest in the control it [20]\r\ngave him over the qualities opposed to Spirit which mor-\r\ntals name matter.\r\n\r\nThe Principle of these marvellous works is divine; but\r\nthe actor was human. This divine Principle is discerned\r\nin Christian Science, as we advance in the spiritual under- [25]\r\nstanding that all substance, Life, and intelligence are\r\nGod. The so-called miracles contained in Holy Writ are\r\nneither supernatural nor preternatural; for God is good,\r\nand goodness is more natural than evil. The marvellous\r\nhealing-power of goodness is the outflowing life of Chris- [30]\r\ntianity, and it characterized and dated the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[Page 200.]\r\n\r\nIt was the consummate naturalness of Truth in the [1]\r\nmind of Jesus, that made his healing easy and instan-\r\ntaneous. Jesus regarded good as the normal state of man,\r\nand evil as the abnormal; holiness, life, and health as\r\nthe better representatives of God than sin, disease, and [5]\r\ndeath. The master Metaphysician understood omnipo-\r\ntence to be All-power: because Spirit was to him All-\r\nin-all, matter was palpably an error of premise and\r\nconclusion, while God was the only substance, Life,\r\nand intelligence of man. [10]\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul insists on the rare rule in Christian\r\nScience that we have chosen for a text; a rule that is sus-\r\nceptible of proof, and is applicable to every stage and\r\nstate of human existence. The divine Science of this rule\r\nis quite as remote from the general comprehension of man- [15]\r\nkind as are the so-called miracles of our Master, and for\r\nthe sole reason that it is their basis. The foundational\r\nfacts of Christian Science are gathered from the supremacy\r\nof spiritual law and its antagonism to every supposed ma-\r\nterial law. Christians to-day should be able to say, with [20]\r\nthe sweet sincerity of the apostle, “I take pleasure in\r\ninfirmities,”—I enjoy the touch of weakness, pain, and\r\nall suffering of the flesh, _because_ it compels me to seek the\r\nremedy for it, and to find happiness, apart from the per-\r\nsonal senses. The holy calm of Paul’s well-tried hope [25]\r\nmet no obstacle or circumstances paramount to the tri-\r\numph of a reasonable faith in the omnipotence of good,\r\ninvolved in its divine Principle, God: the so-called pains\r\nand pleasures of matter were alike unreal to Jesus; for he\r\nregarded matter as only a vagary of mortal belief, and sub- [30]\r\ndued it with this understanding.\r\n\r\nThe abstract statement that all is Mind, supports the\r\n\r\n[Page 201.]\r\n\r\nentire wisdom of the text; and this statement receives [1]\r\nthe mortal scoff only because it meets the immortal de-\r\nmands of Truth. The Science of Paul’s declaration re-\r\nsolves the element misnamed matter into its original sin,\r\nor human will; that will which would oppose bringing the [5]\r\nqualities of Spirit into subjection to Spirit. Sin brought\r\ndeath; and death is an element of matter, or material\r\nfalsity, never of Spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus reproduced his body after its burial, he\r\nrevealed the myth or material falsity of evil; its power- [10]\r\nlessness to destroy good, and the omnipotence of the\r\nMind that knows this: he also showed forth the error\r\nand nothingness of supposed life in matter, and the great\r\nsomethingness of the good we possess, which is of Spirit,\r\nand immortal. [15]\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this, Paul took pleasure in infirmities,\r\nfor it enabled him to triumph over them,—he declared\r\nthat “the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath\r\nmade me free from the law of sin and death;” he took\r\npleasure in “reproaches” and “persecutions,” because [20]\r\nthey were so many proofs that he had wrought the prob-\r\nlem of being beyond the common apprehension of sinners;\r\nhe took pleasure in “necessities,” for they tested and de-\r\nveloped latent power.\r\n\r\nWe protect our dwellings more securely after a robbery, [25]\r\nand our jewels have been stolen; so, after losing those\r\njewels of character,—temperance, virtue, and truth,—\r\nthe young man is awakened to bar his door against further\r\nrobberies.\r\n\r\nGo to the bedside of pain, and there you can demon- [30]\r\nstrate the triumph of good that has pleasure in infirmities;\r\nbecause it illustrates through the flesh the divine power\r\n\r\n[Page 202.]\r\n\r\nof Spirit, and reaches the basis of all supposed miracles; [1]\r\nwhereby the sweet harmonies of Christian Science are\r\nfound to correct the discords of sense, and to lift man’s\r\nbeing into the sunlight of Soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The chamber where the good man meets his fate [5]\r\n    Is privileged beyond the walks of common life,\r\n      Quite on the verge of heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. POND AND PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 203.]\r\n\r\nBeloved Students:—In thanking you for your [1]\r\ngift of the pretty pond contributed to Pleasant View,\r\nin Concord, New Hampshire, I make no distinction be-\r\ntween my students and your students; for here, thine\r\nbecomes mine through gratitude and affection. [5]\r\n\r\nFrom my tower window, as I look on this smile of\r\nChristian Science, this gift from my students and their\r\nstudents, it will always mirror their love, loyalty, and\r\ngood works. Solomon saith, “As in water face answereth\r\nto face, so the heart of man to man.” [10]\r\n\r\nThe waters that run among the valleys, and that\r\nyou have coaxed in their course to call on me, have\r\nserved the imagination for centuries. Theology religiously\r\nbathes in water, medicine applies it physically, hydrology\r\nhandles it with so-called science, and metaphysics appro- [15]\r\npriates it topically as type and shadow. Metaphysically,\r\nbaptism serves to rebuke the senses and illustrate Christian\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n_First:_ The baptism of repentance is indeed a stricken\r\nstate of human consciousness, wherein mortals gain [20]\r\nsevere views of themselves; a state of mind which rends\r\nthe veil that hides mental deformity. Tears flood the eyes,\r\n\r\n[Page 204.]\r\n\r\nagony struggles, pride rebels, and a mortal seems a [1]\r\nmonster, a dark, impenetrable cloud of error; and falling\r\non the bended knee of prayer, humble before God, he\r\ncries, “Save, or I perish.” Thus Truth, searching the\r\nheart, neutralizes and destroys error. [5]\r\n\r\nThis mental period is sometimes chronic, but oftener\r\nacute. It is attended throughout with doubt, hope, sorrow,\r\njoy, defeat, and triumph. When the good fight is fought,\r\nerror yields up its weapons and kisses the feet of Love,\r\nwhile white-winged peace sings to the heart a song of [10]\r\nangels.\r\n\r\n_Second:_ The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the spirit\r\nof Truth cleansing from all sin; giving mortals new\r\nmotives, new purposes, new affections, all pointing up-\r\nward. This mental condition settles into strength, free- [15]\r\ndom, deep-toned faith in God; and a marked loss of faith\r\nin evil, in human wisdom, human policy, ways, and means.\r\nIt develops individual capacity, increases the intellectual\r\nactivities, and so quickens moral sensibility that the\r\ngreat demands of spiritual sense are recognized, and they [20]\r\nrebuke the material senses, holding sway over human\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nBy purifying human thought, this state of mind per-\r\nmeates with increased harmony all the minutiae of human\r\naffairs. It brings with it wonderful foresight, wisdom, [25]\r\nand power; it unselfs the mortal purpose, gives steadi-\r\nness to resolve, and success to endeavor. Through the\r\naccession of spirituality, God, the divine Principle of\r\nChristian Science, literally governs the aims, ambition,\r\nand acts of the Scientist. The divine ruling gives prudence [30]\r\nand energy; it banishes forever all envy, rivalry,\r\nevil thinking, evil speaking and acting; and mortal\r\n\r\n[Page 205.]\r\n\r\nmind, thus purged, obtains peace and power outside of [1]\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThis practical Christian Science is the divine Mind,\r\nthe incorporeal Truth and Love, shining through the mists\r\nof materiality and melting away the shadows called sin, [5]\r\ndisease, and death.\r\n\r\nIn mortal experience, the fire of repentance first sepa-\r\nrates the dross from the gold, and reformation brings\r\nthe light which dispels darkness. Thus the operation\r\nof the spirit of Truth and Love on the human thought, [10]\r\nin the words of St. John, “shall take of mine and show it\r\nunto you.”\r\n\r\n_Third:_ The baptism of Spirit, or final immersion of\r\nhuman consciousness in the infinite ocean of Love, is the\r\nlast scene in corporeal sense. This omnipotent act drops [15]\r\nthe curtain on material man and mortality. After this,\r\nman’s identity or consciousness reflects only Spirit, good,\r\nwhose visible being is invisible to the physical senses: eye\r\nhath not seen it, inasmuch as it is the disembodied in-\r\ndividual Spirit-substance and consciousness termed in [20]\r\nChristian metaphysics the ideal man—forever permeated\r\nwith eternal life, holiness, heaven. This order of Science\r\nis the chain of ages, which maintain their obvious corre-\r\nspondence, and unites all periods in the divine design.\r\nMortal man’s repentance and absolute abandonment of [25]\r\nsin finally dissolves all supposed material life or physical\r\nsensation, and the corporeal or mortal man disappears\r\nforever. The encumbering mortal molecules, called man,\r\nvanish as a dream; but man born of the great Forever,\r\nlives on, God-crowned and blest. [30]\r\n\r\nMortals who on the shores of time learn Christian\r\nScience, and live what they learn, take rapid transit to\r\n\r\n[Page 206.]\r\n\r\nheaven,—the hinge on which have turned all revolu- [1]\r\ntions, natural, civil, or religious, the former being servant\r\nto the latter,—from flux to permanence, from foul to\r\npure, from torpid to serene, from extremes to intermediate.\r\nAbove the waves of Jordan, dashing against the receding [5]\r\nshore, is heard the Father and Mother’s welcome, saying\r\nforever to the baptized of Spirit: “This is my beloved\r\nSon.” What but divine Science can interpret man’s\r\neternal existence, God’s allness, and the scientific inde-\r\nstructibility of the universe? [10]\r\n\r\nThe advancing stages of Christian Science are gained\r\nthrough growth, not accretion; idleness is the foe of\r\nprogress. And scientific growth manifests no weakness,\r\nno emasculation, no illusive vision, no dreamy absentness,\r\nno insubordination to the laws that be, no loss nor lack [15]\r\nof what constitutes true manhood.\r\n\r\nGrowth is governed by intelligence; by the active,\r\nall-wise, law-creating, law-disciplining, law-abiding Prin-\r\nciple, God. The real Christian Scientist is constantly\r\naccentuating harmony in word and deed, mentally and [20]\r\norally, perpetually repeating this diapason of heaven:\r\n“Good is my God, and my God is good. Love is my God,\r\nand my God is Love.”\r\n\r\nBeloved students, you have entered the path. Press\r\npatiently on; God is good, and good is the reward of all [25]\r\nwho diligently seek God. Your growth will be rapid, if\r\nyou love good supremely, and understand and obey the\r\nWay-shower, who, going before you, has scaled the steep\r\nascent of Christian Science, stands upon the mount of\r\nholiness, the dwelling-place of our God, and bathes in the [30]\r\nbaptismal font of eternal Love.\r\n\r\nAs you journey, and betimes sigh for rest “beside the\r\n\r\n[Page 207.]\r\n\r\nstill waters,” ponder this lesson of love. Learn its pur- [1]\r\npose;and in hope and faith, where heart meets heart\r\nreciprocally blest, drink with me the living waters of the\r\nspirit of my life-purpose,—to impress humanity with\r\nthe genuine recognition of practical, operative Christian [5]\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. PRECEPT UPON PRECEPT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 208.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thy Will Be Done”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the law of Truth to error, “Thou shalt surely\r\ndie.” This law is a divine energy. Mortals cannot\r\nprevent the fulfilment of this law; it covers all sin and\r\nits effects. God is All, and by virtue of this nature and [5]\r\nallness He is cognizant only of good. Like a legislative\r\nbill that governs millions of mortals whom the legislators\r\nknow not, the universal law of God has no knowledge\r\nof evil, and enters unconsciously the human heart and\r\ngoverns it. [10]\r\n\r\nMortals have only to submit to the law of God, come\r\ninto sympathy with it, and to let His will be done. This\r\nunbroken motion of the law of divine Love gives, to the\r\nweary and heavy-laden, rest. But who is willing to do\r\nHis will or to let it be done? Mortals obey their own [15]\r\nwills, and so disobey the divine order.\r\n\r\nAll states and stages of human error are met and\r\nmastered by divine Truth’s negativing error in the way\r\nof God’s appointing. Those “whom the Lord loveth He\r\nchasteneth.” His rod brings to view His love, and inter- [20]\r\nprets to mortals the gospel of healing. David said, “Be-\r\nfore I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I\r\nkept Thy word.” He who knows the end from the be-\r\n\r\n[Page 209.]\r\n\r\nginning, attaches to sin due penalties as its antidotes and [1]\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nWho art thou, vain mortal, that usurpest the preroga-\r\ntive of divine wisdom, and wouldst teach God not to punish\r\nsin? that wouldst shut the mouth of His prophets, [5]\r\nand cry, “Peace, peace; when there is no peace,”—yea,\r\nthat healest the wounds of my people slightly?\r\n\r\nThe Principle of divine Science being Love, the divine\r\nrule of this Principle demonstrates Love, and proves that\r\nhuman belief fulfils the law of belief, and dies of its own [10]\r\nphysics. Metaphysics also demonstrates this Principle of\r\ncure when sin is self-destroyed. Short-sighted physics\r\nadmits the so-called pains of matter that destroy its more\r\ndangerous pleasures.\r\n\r\nInsomnia compels mortals to learn that neither obliv- [15]\r\nion nor dreams can recuperate the life of man, whose\r\nLife is God, for God neither slumbers nor sleeps. The\r\nloss of gustatory enjoyment and the ills of indigestion\r\ntend to rebuke appetite and destroy the peace of a false\r\nsense. False pleasure will be, is, chastened; it has no [20]\r\nright to be at peace. To suffer for having “other gods\r\nbefore me,” is divinely wise. Evil passions die in their\r\nown flames, but are punished before extinguished. Peace\r\nhas no foothold on the false basis that evil should be\r\nconcealed and that life and happiness should still attend [25]\r\nit. Joy is self-sustained; goodness and blessedness are\r\none: suffering is self-inflicted, and good is the master of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nTo this scientific logic and the logic of events, egotism\r\nand false charity say, “ ‘Not so, Lord;’ it is wise to [30]\r\ncover iniquity and punish it not, then shall mortals have\r\npeace.” Divine Love, as unconscious as incapable of\r\n\r\n[Page 210.]\r\n\r\nerror, pursues the evil that hideth itself, strips off its [1]\r\ndisguises, and—behold the result: evil, uncovered, is\r\nself-destroyed.\r\n\r\nChristian Science never healed a patient without prov-\r\ning with mathematical certainty that error, when found [5]\r\nout, is two-thirds destroyed, and the remaining third\r\nkills itself. Do men whine over a nest of serpents, and\r\npost around it placards warning people not to stir up\r\nthese reptiles because they have stings? Christ said,\r\n“They shall take up serpents;” and, “Be ye therefore [10]\r\nwise as serpents and harmless as doves.” The wisdom\r\nof a serpent is to hide itself. The wisdom of God, as\r\nrevealed in Christian Science, brings the serpent out of\r\nits hole, handles it, and takes away its sting. Good deeds\r\nare harmless. He who has faith in woman’s special adapt- [15]\r\nability to lead on Christian Science, will not be shocked\r\nwhen she puts her foot on the head of the serpent, as it\r\nbiteth at the heel.\r\n\r\nIntemperance begets a belief of disordered brains,\r\nmembranes, stomach, and nerves; and this belief serves [20]\r\nto uncover and kill this lurking serpent, intemperance,\r\nthat hides itself under the false pretense of human need,\r\ninnocent enjoyment, and a medical prescription. The\r\nbelief in venereal diseases tears the black mask from the\r\nshameless brow of licentiousness, torments its victim, and [25]\r\nthus may save him from his destroyer.\r\n\r\nCharity has the courage of conviction; it may suffer\r\nlong, but has neither the cowardice nor the foolhardiness\r\nto cover iniquity. Charity is Love; and Love opens\r\nthe eyes of the blind, rebukes error, and casts it out. [30]\r\nCharity never flees before error, lest it should suffer\r\nfrom an encounter. Love your enemies, or you will not\r\n\r\n[Page 211.]\r\n\r\nlose them; and if you love them, you will help to reform [1]\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nChrist points the way of salvation. His mode is not\r\ncowardly, uncharitable, nor unwise, but it teaches mor-\r\ntals to handle serpents and cast out evil. Our own vision [5]\r\nmust be clear to open the eyes of others, else the blind\r\nwill lead the blind and both shall fall. The sickly charity\r\nthat supplies criminals with bouquets has been dealt\r\nwith summarily by the good judgment of people in\r\nthe old Bay State. Inhuman medical bills, class legisla- [10]\r\ntion, and Salem witchcraft, are not indigenous to her\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n“Out of the depths have I delivered thee.” The\r\ndrowning man just rescued from the merciless wave is\r\nunconscious of suffering. Why, then, do you break his [15]\r\npeace and cause him to suffer in coming to life? Because\r\nyou wish to save him from death. Then, if a criminal\r\nis at peace, is he not to be pitied and brought back to\r\nlife? Or, are you afraid to do this lest he suffer, trample\r\non your pearls of thought, and turn on you and rend you? [20]\r\nCowardice is selfishness. When one protects himself at\r\nhis neighbor’s cost, let him remember, “Whosoever will\r\nsave his life shall lose it.” He risks nothing who obeys\r\nthe law of God, and shall find the Life that cannot be\r\nlost. [25]\r\n\r\nOur Master said, “Ye shall drink indeed of my cup.”\r\nJesus stormed sin in its citadels and kept peace with\r\nGod. He drank this cup giving thanks, and he said to\r\nhis followers, “Drink ye all of it,”—drink it all, and let\r\nall drink of it. He lived the spirit of his prayer,—“Thy [30]\r\nkingdom come.” Shall we repeat our Lord’s Prayer\r\nwhen the heart denies it, refuses to bear the cross and\r\n\r\n[Page 212.]\r\n\r\nto fulfil the conditions of our petition? Human policy [1]\r\nis a fool that saith in his heart, “No God”—a caressing\r\nJudas that betrays you, and commits suicide. This god-\r\nless policy never knows what happiness is, and how it is\r\nobtained. [5]\r\n\r\nJesus did his work, and left his glorious career for our\r\nexample. On the shore of Gennesaret he tersely re-\r\nminded his students of their worldly policy. They had\r\nsuffered, and seen their error. This experience caused\r\nthem to remember the reiterated warning of their Mas- [10]\r\nter and cast their nets on the right side. When they\r\nwere fit to be blest, they received the blessing. The\r\nultimatum of their human sense of ways and means\r\nought to silence ours. One step away from the direct\r\nline of divine Science cost them—what? A speedy re- [15]\r\nturn under the reign of difficulties, darkness, and unre-\r\nquited toil.\r\n\r\nThe currents of human nature rush in against the right\r\ncourse; health, happiness, and life flow not into one of\r\ntheir channels. The law of Love saith, “Not my will, [20]\r\nbut Thine, be done,” and Christian Science proves that\r\nhuman will is lost in the divine; and Love, the white\r\nChrist, is the remunerator.\r\n\r\nIf, consciously or unconsciously, one is at work in a\r\nwrong direction, who will step forward and open his [25]\r\neyes to see this error? He who _is_ a Christian Scientist,\r\nwho has cast the beam out of his own eye, speaks plainly\r\nto the offender and tries to show his errors to him before\r\nletting another know it.\r\n\r\nPitying friends took down from the cross the fainting [30]\r\nform of Jesus, and buried it out of their sight. His dis-\r\nciples, who had not yet drunk of his cup, lost sight of\r\n\r\n[Page 213.]\r\n\r\nhim; they could not behold his immortal being in the [1]\r\nform of Godlikeness.\r\n\r\nAll that I have written, taught, or lived, that is good,\r\nflowed through cross-bearing, self-forgetfulness, and my\r\nfaith in the right. Suffering or Science, or both, in the [5]\r\nproportion that their instructions are assimilated, will\r\npoint the way, shorten the process, and consummate the\r\njoys of acquiescence in the methods of divine Love. The\r\nScripture saith, “He that covereth his sins shall not pros-\r\nper.” No risk is so stupendous as to neglect opportuni- [10]\r\nties which God giveth, and not to forewarn and forearm\r\nour fellow-mortals against the evil which, if seen, can\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\nMay my friends and my enemies so profit by these\r\nwaymarks, that what has chastened and illumined [15]\r\nanother’s way may perfect their own lives by gentle\r\nbenedictions. In every age, the pioneer reformer must\r\npass through a baptism of fire. But the faithful adher-\r\nents of Truth have gone on rejoicing. Christian Science\r\ngives a fearless wing and firm foundation. These are [20]\r\nits inspiring tones from the lips of our Master, “My\r\nsheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow\r\nme: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall\r\nnever perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of\r\nmy hand.” He is but “an hireling” who fleeth when he [25]\r\nseeth the wolf coming.\r\n\r\nLoyal Christian Scientists, be of good cheer: the night\r\nis far spent, the day dawns; God’s universal kingdom\r\nwill appear, Love will reign in every heart, and _His_ will\r\nbe done on earth as in heaven. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 214.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Put Up Thy Sword”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Jesus’ life was full of Love, and a demonstra-\r\ntion of Love, it appeared hate to the carnal mind, or\r\nmortal thought, of his time. He said, “Think not that\r\nI am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send [5]\r\npeace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at\r\nvariance against his father, and the daughter against her\r\nmother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-\r\nlaw. And a man’s foes shall be they of his own house-\r\nhold.” [10]\r\n\r\nThis action of Jesus was stimulated by the same Love\r\nthat closed—to the senses—that wondrous life, and\r\nthat summed up its demonstration in the command,\r\n“Put up thy sword.” The very conflict his Truth brought,\r\nin accomplishing its purpose of Love, meant, all [15]\r\nthe way through, “Put up thy sword;” but the sword\r\nmust have been drawn before it could be returned into\r\nthe scabbard.\r\n\r\nMy students need to search the Scriptures and “Science\r\nand Health with Key to the Scriptures,” to understand [20]\r\nthe personal Jesus’ labor in the flesh for their salvation:\r\nthey need to do this even to understand my works, their\r\nmotives, aims, and tendency.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of mortal mind in being healed morally,\r\nis the same as its attitude physically. The Christian [25]\r\nScientist cannot heal the sick, and take error along with\r\nTruth, either in the recognition or approbation of it.\r\nThis would prevent the possibility of destroying the\r\ntares: they must be separated from the wheat before\r\nthey can be burned, and Jesus foretold the harvest hour [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 215.]\r\n\r\nand the final destruction of error through this very pro- [1]\r\ncess,—the sifting and the fire. The tendency of mortal\r\nmind is to go from one extreme to another: Truth comes\r\ninto the intermediate space, saying, “I wound to heal;\r\nI punish to reform; I do it all in love; my peace I leave [5]\r\nwith thee: not as the world giveth, give I unto thee.\r\nArise, let us go hence; let us depart from the material\r\nsense of God’s ways and means, and gain a spiritual\r\nunderstanding of them.”\r\n\r\nBut let us not seek to climb up some other way, as we [10]\r\nshall do if we take the end for the beginning or start\r\nfrom wrong motives. Christian Science demands order\r\nand truth. To abide by these we must first understand\r\nthe Principle and object of our work, and be clear that\r\nit is Love, peace, and good will toward men. Then we [15]\r\nshall demonstrate the Principle in the way of His ap-\r\npointment, and not according to the infantile concep-\r\ntion of our way; as when a child in sleep walks on the\r\nsummit of the roof of the house because he is a som-\r\nnambulist, and thinks he is where he is not, and would [20]\r\nfall immediately if he knew where he was and what he\r\nwas doing.\r\n\r\nMy students are at the beginning of their demonstra-\r\ntion; they have a long warfare with error in themselves\r\nand in others to finish, and they must at this stage use [25]\r\nthe sword of Spirit.\r\n\r\nThey cannot in the beginning take the attitude, nor\r\nadopt the words, that Jesus used at the _end_ of his\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nIf you would follow in his footsteps, you must not try [30]\r\nto gather the harvest while the corn is in the blade, nor\r\nyet when it is in the ear; a wise spiritual discernment\r\n\r\n[Page 216.]\r\n\r\nmust be used in your application of his words and infer- [1]\r\nence from his acts, to guide your own state of combat\r\nwith error. There _remaineth_, it is true, a Sabbath rest\r\nfor the people of God; but we must first have done our\r\nwork, and entered into our rest, as the Scriptures give [5]\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Theism\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the May number of our _Journal_, there appeared a\r\nreview of, and some extracts from, “Scientific Theism,”\r\nby Phare Pleigh. [10]\r\n\r\nNow, Phare Pleigh evidently means more than “hands\r\noff.” A live lexicographer, given to the Anglo-Saxon\r\ntongue, might add to the above definition the “laying\r\non of hands,” as well. Whatever his _nom de plume_\r\nmeans, an acquaintance with the author justifies one [15]\r\nin the conclusion that he is a power in criticism, a\r\nbig protest against injustice; but, the best may be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nOne of these extracts is the story of the Cheshire Cat,\r\nwhich “vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end [20]\r\nof the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained\r\nsome time after the rest of it had gone.” Was this a witty\r\nor a happy hit at idealism, to illustrate the author’s fol-\r\nlowing point?—\r\n\r\n“When philosophy becomes fairy-land, in which neither [25]\r\nlaws of nature nor the laws of reason hold good, the\r\nattempt of phenomenism to conceive the universe as a\r\n_phenomenon without a noumenon_ may succeed, but not\r\nbefore; for it is an attempt to conceive a grin without\r\na cat.” [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 217.]\r\n\r\nTrue idealism is a divine Science, which combines in [1]\r\nlogical sequence, nature, reason, and revelation. An\r\neffect without a cause is inconceivable; neither philoso-\r\nphy nor reason attempts to find one; but all should con-\r\nceive and understand that Spirit cannot become less than [5]\r\nSpirit; hence that the universe of God is spiritual,—even\r\nthe ideal world whose cause is the self-created Principle,\r\nwith which its ideal or phenomenon must correspond in\r\nquality and quantity.\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of an unscientific statement is this: that [10]\r\nmatter and Spirit are one and eternal; or, that the phe-\r\nnomenon of Spirit is the antipode of Spirit, namely, mat-\r\nter. Nature declares, throughout the mineral, vegetable,\r\nand animal kingdoms, that the specific nature of all things\r\nis unchanged, and that nature is constituted of and by [15]\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nSensuous and material realistic views presuppose that\r\nnature is matter, and that Deity is a finite person con-\r\ntaining infinite Mind; and that these opposites, in sup-\r\npositional unity and personality, produce matter,—a [20]\r\nthird quality unlike God. Again, that matter is both\r\ncause and effect, but that the effect is antagonistic to its\r\ncause; that death is at war with Life, evil with good,—\r\nand man a rebel against his Maker. This is neither\r\nScience nor theism. According to Holy Writ, it is a [25]\r\nkingdom divided against itself, that shall be brought\r\nto desolation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of God must change in order to become\r\nmatter, or to become both finite and infinite; and matter\r\nmust _dis_appear, for Spirit to appear. To the material [30]\r\nsense, everything is matter; but spiritualize human\r\nthought, and our convictions change: for spiritual sense\r\n\r\n[Page 218.]\r\n\r\ntakes in new views, in which nature becomes Spirit; and [1]\r\nSpirit is God, and God is good. Science unfolds the fact\r\nthat Deity was forever Mind, Spirit; that matter never\r\nproduced Mind, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe visible universe declares the invisible only by re- [5]\r\nversion, as error declares Truth. The testimony of mate-\r\nrial sense in relation to existence is false; for matter can\r\nneither see, hear, nor feel, and mortal mind must change\r\nall its conceptions of life, substance, and intelligence,\r\nbefore it can reach the immortality of Mind and its ideas. [10]\r\nIt is erroneous to accept the evidence of the material\r\nsenses whence to reason out God, when it is conceded\r\nthat the five personal senses can take no cognizance of\r\nSpirit or of its phenomena. False realistic views sap the\r\nScience of Principle and idea; they make Deity unreal [15]\r\nand inconceivable, either as mind or matter; but Truth\r\ncomes to the rescue of reason and immortality, and unfolds\r\nthe real nature of God and the universe to the spiri-\r\nual sense, which beareth witness of things spiritual, and\r\nnot material. [20]\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the notion of Spirit as cause and end,\r\nwith matter as its effect, is more ridiculous than the “grin\r\nwithout a cat;” for a grin expresses the nature of a cat,\r\nand this nature may linger in memory: but matter does\r\nnot express the nature of Spirit, and matter’s graven [25]\r\ngrins are neither eliminated nor retained by Spirit. What\r\ncan illustrate Dr. ——’s views better than Pat’s echo,\r\nwhen he said “How do you do?” and echo answered,\r\n“Pretty well, I thank you!”\r\n\r\nDr. —— says: “The recognition of teleology in nature [30]\r\nis necessarily the recognition of purely spiritual personality\r\nin God.”\r\n\r\n[Page 219.]\r\n\r\nAccording to lexicography, teleology is the science of [1]\r\nthe final cause of things; and divine Science (and all\r\nScience is divine) neither reveals God in matter, cause\r\nin effect, nor teaches that nature and her laws are the\r\n_material_ universe, or that the personality of infinite Spirit [5]\r\nis finite or material. Jesus said, “Ye do err, not know-\r\ning the Scriptures, nor the power of God.” Now, what\r\nsaith the Scripture? “God is a Spirit: and they that\r\nworship Him must worship Him in spirit and in\r\ntruth.” [10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Practice\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that mortals think wickedly and act\r\nwickedly: it is beginning to be seen by thinkers, that\r\nmortals think also after a sickly fashion. In common\r\nparlance, one person feels sick, another feels wicked. A [15]\r\nthird person knows that if he would remove this feeling\r\nin either case, in the one he must change his patient’s\r\nconsciousness of dis-ease and suffering to a consciousness\r\nof ease and loss of suffering; while in the other he must\r\nchange the patient’s sense of sinning at ease to a sense of [20]\r\ndiscomfort in sin and peace in goodness.\r\n\r\nThis is Christian Science: that mortal mind makes\r\nsick, and immortal Mind makes well; that mortal mind\r\nmakes sinners, while immortal Mind makes saints; that\r\na state of health is but a state of consciousness made mani- [25]\r\nfest on the body, and _vice versa_; that while one person\r\nfeels wickedly and acts wickedly, another knows that if\r\nhe can change this evil sense and consciousness to a good\r\nsense, or conscious goodness, the fruits of goodness will\r\nfollow, and he has reformed the sinner. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 220.]\r\n\r\nNow, demonstrate this rule, which obtains in every [1]\r\nline of mental healing, and you will find that a good rule\r\nworks one way, and a false rule the opposite way.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that there is a sick person whom an-\r\nother would heal mentally. The healer begins by mental [5]\r\nargument. He mentally says, “You are well, and you\r\nknow it;” and he supports this silent mental force by\r\naudible explanation, attestation, and precedent. His\r\nmental and oral arguments aim to refute the sick man’s\r\nthoughts, words, and actions, in certain directions, and [10]\r\nturn them into channels of Truth. He persists in this\r\ncourse until the patient’s mind yields, and the harmonious\r\nthought has the full control over this mind on the point\r\nat issue. The end is attained, and the patient says and\r\nfeels, “I am well, and I know it.” [15]\r\n\r\nThis mental practitioner has changed his patient’s\r\nconsciousness from sickness to health. The patient’s\r\nmental state is now the diametrical opposite of what it\r\nwas when the mental practitioner undertook to transform\r\nit, and he is improved morally and physically. [20]\r\n\r\nThat this mental method has power and bears fruit,\r\nis patent both to the conscientious Christian Scientist and\r\nthe observer. Both should understand with equal clear-\r\nness, that if this mental process and power be reversed,\r\nand people believe that a man is sick and knows it, and [25]\r\nspeak of him as being sick, put it into the minds of others\r\nthat he is sick, publish it in the newspapers that he is\r\nfailing, and persist in this action of mind over mind, it\r\nfollows that he will believe that he is sick,—and Jesus\r\nsaid it would be according to the woman’s belief; but if [30]\r\nwith the certainty of Science he knows that an error of\r\nbelief has not the power of Truth, and cannot, does\r\n\r\n[Page 221.]\r\n\r\nnot, produce the slightest effect, it has no power over [1]\r\nhim. Thus a mental malpractitioner may lose his\r\npower to harm by a false mental argument; for it\r\ngives one opportunity to handle the error, and when\r\nmastering it one gains in the rules of metaphysics, and [5]\r\nthereby learns more of its divine Principle. Error pro-\r\nduces physical sufferings, and these sufferings show\r\nthe fundamental Principle of Christian Science; namely,\r\nthat error and sickness are one, and Truth is their\r\nremedy. [10]\r\n\r\nThe evil-doer can do little at removing the effect of sin\r\non himself, unless he believes that sin has produced the\r\neffect and knows he is a sinner: or, knowing that he is a\r\nsinner, if he denies it, the good effect is lost. Either of\r\nthese states of mind will stultify the power to heal men- [15]\r\ntally. This accounts for many helpless mental practi-\r\ntioners and mysterious diseases.\r\n\r\nAgain: If error is the cause of disease, Truth being\r\nthe cure, denial of this fact in one instance and\r\nacknowledgment of it in another saps one’s under- [20]\r\nstanding of the Science of Mind-healing, Such denial\r\ndethrones demonstration, baffles the student of Mind-\r\nhealing, and divorces his work from Science. Such de-\r\nnial also contradicts the doctrine that we must mentally\r\nstruggle against both evil and disease, and is like saying [25]\r\nthat five times ten are fifty while ten times five are not\r\nfifty; as if the multiplication of the same two numbers\r\nwould not yield the same product whichever might serve\r\nas the multiplicand.\r\n\r\nWho would tell another of a crime that he himself is [30]\r\ncommitting, or call public attention to that crime? The\r\nbelief in evil and in the process of evil, holds the issues\r\n\r\n[Page 222.]\r\n\r\nof death to the evil-doer. It takes away a man’s proper [1]\r\nsense of good, and gives him a false sense of both evil\r\nand good. It inflames envy, passion, evil-speaking, and\r\nstrife. It reverses Christian Science in all things. It\r\ncauses the victim to believe that he is advancing while [5]\r\ninjuring himself and others. This state of false conscious-\r\nness in many cases causes the victim great physical suffering;\r\nand conviction of his wrong state of feeling reforms\r\nhim, and so heals him: or, failing of conviction and re-\r\nform, he becomes morally paralyzed—in other words, [10]\r\na moral idiot.\r\n\r\nIn this state of misled consciousness, one is ready to\r\nlisten complacently to audible falsehoods that once he\r\nwould have resisted and loathed; and this, because the\r\nfalse seems true. The malicious mental argument and [15]\r\nits action on the mind of the perpetrator, is fatal, morally\r\nand physically. From the effects of mental malpractice\r\nthe subject scarcely awakes in time, and must suffer its\r\nfull penalty after death. This sin against divine Science\r\nis cancelled only through human agony: the measure it [20]\r\nhas meted must be remeasured to it.\r\n\r\nThe crimes committed under this new _régime_ of mind-\r\npower, when brought to light, will make stout hearts quail.\r\nIts mystery protects it now, for it is not yet known. Error\r\nis more abstract than Truth. Even the healing Principle, [25]\r\nwhose power seems inexplicable, is not so obscure; for\r\nthis is the power of God, and good should seem more\r\nnatural than evil.\r\n\r\nI shall not forget the cost of investigating, for this age,\r\nthe methods and power of error. While the ways, means, [30]\r\nand potency of Truth had flowed into my consciousness\r\nas easily as dawns the morning light and shadows flee,\r\n\r\n[Page 223.]\r\n\r\nthe metaphysical mystery of error—its hidden paths, [1]\r\npurpose, and fruits—at first defied me. I was say-\r\ning all the time, “Come not thou into the secret”—\r\nbut at length took up the research according to God’s\r\ncommand. [5]\r\n\r\nStreams which purify, necessarily have pure fountains;\r\nwhile impure streams flow from corrupt sources. Here,\r\ndivine light, logic, and revelation coincide.\r\n\r\nScience proves, beyond cavil, that the tree is known\r\nby its fruit; that mind reaches its own ideal, and cannot [10]\r\nbe separated from it. I respect that moral sense which\r\nis sufficiently strong to discern what it believes, and to say,\r\nif it must, “I discredit Mind with having the power to\r\nheal.” This individual disbelieves in Mind-healing, and\r\nis consistent. But, alas! for the mistake of believing in [15]\r\nmental healing, claiming full faith in the divine Principle,\r\nand saying, “I am a Christian Scientist,” while doing\r\nunto others what we would resist to the hilt if done unto\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nMay divine Love so permeate the affections of all those [20]\r\nwho have named the name of Christ in its fullest sense,\r\nthat no counteracting influence can hinder their growth\r\nor taint their examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking Offense\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is immense wisdom in the old proverb, “He [25]\r\nthat is slow to anger is better than the mighty.” Hannah\r\nMore said, “If I wished to punish my enemy, I should\r\nmake him hate somebody.”\r\n\r\nTo punish ourselves for others’ faults, is superlative\r\nfolly. The mental arrow shot from another’s bow is [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 224.]\r\n\r\npractically harmless, unless our own thought barbs it. [1]\r\nIt is our pride that makes another’s criticism rankle, our\r\nself-will that makes another’s deed offensive, our egotism\r\nthat feels hurt by another’s self-assertion. Well may we\r\nfeel wounded by our own faults; but we can hardly afford [5]\r\nto be miserable for the faults of others.\r\n\r\nA courtier told Constantine that a mob had broken\r\nthe head of his statue with stones. The emperor lifted\r\nhis hands to his head, saying: “It is very surprising, but\r\nI don’t feel hurt in the least.” [10]\r\n\r\nWe should remember that the world is wide; that there\r\nare a thousand million different human wills, opinions,\r\nambitions, tastes, and loves; that each person has a differ-\r\nent history, constitution, culture, character, from all the\r\nrest; that human life is the work, the play, the ceaseless [15]\r\naction and reaction upon each other of these different\r\natoms. Then, we should go forth into life with the smallest\r\nexpectations, but with the largest patience; with a keen\r\nrelish for and appreciation of everything beautiful, great,\r\nand good, but with a temper so genial that the friction [20]\r\nof the world shall not wear upon our sensibilities; with\r\nan equanimity so settled that no passing breath nor\r\naccidental disturbance shall agitate or ruffle it; with a\r\ncharity broad enough to cover the whole world’s evil, and\r\nsweet enough to neutralize what is bitter in it,—de- [25]\r\ntermined not to be offended when no wrong is meant, nor\r\neven when it is, unless the offense be against God.\r\n\r\nNothing short of our own errors should offend us. He\r\nwho can wilfully attempt to injure another, is an object\r\nof pity rather than of resentment; while it is a question [30]\r\nin my mind, whether there is enough of a flatterer, a fool,\r\nor a liar, _to_ offend a whole-souled woman.\r\n\r\n[Page 225.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHints To The Clergy\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the residence of Mr. Rawson, of Arlington, Massa-\r\nchusetts, a happy concourse of friends had gathered to\r\ncelebrate the eighty-second birthday of his mother—a\r\nfriend of mine, and a Christian Scientist. [5]\r\n\r\nAmong the guests, were an orthodox clergyman, his\r\nwife and child.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening, conversation drifted to\r\nthe seventh modern wonder, Christian Science; where-\r\nupon the mother, Mrs. Rawson, who had drunk at its [10]\r\nfount, firmly bore testimony to the power of Christ, Truth,\r\nto heal the sick.\r\n\r\nSoon after this conversation, the clergyman’s son\r\nwas taken violently ill. Then was the clergyman’s\r\nopportunity to demand a proof of what the Christian [15]\r\nScientist had declared; and he said to this venerable\r\nChristian:—\r\n\r\n“If you heal my son, when seeing, I may be led to\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rawson then rose from her seat, and sat down [20]\r\nbeside the sofa whereon lay the lad with burning brow,\r\nmoaning in pain.\r\n\r\nLooking away from all material aid, to the spiritual\r\nsource and ever-present help, silently, through the divine\r\npower, she healed him. [25]\r\n\r\nThe deep flush faded from the face, a cool perspiration\r\nspread over it, and he slept.\r\n\r\nIn about one hour he awoke, and was hungry.\r\n\r\nThe parents said:—\r\n\r\n“Wait until we get home, and you shall have some [30]\r\ngruel.”\r\n\r\n[Page 226.]\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Rawson said:—[1]\r\n\r\n“Give the child what he relishes, and doubt not that\r\nthe Father of all will care for him.”\r\n\r\nThus, the unbiased youth and the aged Christian\r\ncarried the case on the side of God; and, after eating [5]\r\nseveral ice-creams, the clergyman’s son returned home\r\n—_well_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfidy And Slander\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has an individual gained by losing his own self-\r\nrespect? or what has he lost when, retaining his own, [10]\r\nhe loses the homage of fools, or the pretentious praise of\r\nhypocrites, false to themselves as to others?\r\n\r\nShakespeare, the immortal lexicographer of mortals,\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                   To thine own self be true, [15]\r\n    And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n    Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Aristotle was asked what a person could gain\r\nby uttering a falsehood, he replied, “Not to be credited\r\nwhen he shall tell the truth.” [20]\r\n\r\nThe character of a liar and hypocrite is so contempti-\r\nble, that even of those who have lost their honor it might\r\nbe expected that from the violation of truth they should\r\nbe restrained by their pride.\r\n\r\nPerfidy of an inferior quality, such as manages to evade [25]\r\nthe law, and which dignified natures cannot stoop to\r\nnotice, except legally, disgraces human nature more than\r\ndo most vices.\r\n\r\nSlander is a midnight robber; the red-tongued assas-\r\nsin of radical worth; the conservative swindler, who [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 227.]\r\n\r\nsells himself in a traffic by which he can gain nothing [1].\r\nIt can retire for forgiveness to no fraternity where its\r\ncrime may stand in the place of a virtue; but must at\r\nlength be given up to the hisses of the multitude, with-\r\nout friend and without apologist. [5]\r\n\r\nLaw has found it necessary to offer to the innocent,\r\nsecurity from slanderers—those pests of society—when\r\ntheir crime comes within its jurisdiction. Thus, to evade\r\nthe penalty of law, and yet with malice aforethought to\r\nextend their evil intent, is the nice distinction by which [10]\r\nthey endeavor to get their weighty stuff into the hands\r\nof gossip! Some uncharitable one may give it a forward\r\nmove, and, ere that one himself become aware, find\r\nhimself responsible for kind (?) endeavors.\r\n\r\nWould that my pen or pity could raise these weak, [15]\r\npitifully poor objects from their choice of self-degrada-\r\ntion to the nobler purposes and wider aims of a life made\r\nhonest: a life in which the fresh flowers of feeling blos-\r\nsom, and, like the camomile, the more trampled upon,\r\nthe sweeter the odor they send forth to benefit mankind; [20]\r\na life wherein calm, self-respected thoughts abide in\r\ntabernacles of their own, dwelling upon a holy hill, speak-\r\ning the truth in the heart; a life wherein the mind can\r\nrest in green pastures, beside the still waters, on isles\r\nof sweet refreshment. The sublime summary of an [25]\r\nhonest life satisfies the mind craving a higher good, and\r\nbathes it in the cool waters of peace on earth; till it\r\ngrows into the full stature of wisdom, reckoning its\r\nown by the amount of happiness it has bestowed upon\r\nothers. [30]\r\n\r\nNot to avenge one’s self upon one’s enemies, is the\r\ncommand of almighty wisdom; and we take this to be\r\n\r\n[Page 228.]\r\n\r\na safer guide than the promptings of human nature. [1]\r\nTo know that a deception dark as it is base has been\r\npractised upon thee,—by those deemed at least indebted\r\nfriends whose welfare thou hast promoted,—and yet\r\nnot to avenge thyself, is to do good to thyself; is to take [5]\r\na new standpoint whence to look upward; is to be calm\r\namid excitement, just amid lawlessness, and pure amid\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nTo be a great man or woman, to have a name whose\r\nodor fills the world with its fragrance, is to bear with [10]\r\npatience the buffetings of envy or malice—even while\r\nseeking to raise those barren natures to a capacity for a\r\nhigher life. We should look with pitying eye on the\r\nmomentary success of all villainies, on mad ambition\r\nand low revenge. This will bring us also to look on a [15]\r\nkind, true, and just person, faithful to conscience and\r\nhonest beyond reproach, as the only suitable fabric out\r\nof which to weave an existence fit for earth and\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContagion\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever man sees, feels, or in any way takes cog-\r\nnizance of, must be caught through mind; inasmuch\r\nas perception, sensation, and consciousness belong to\r\nmind and not to matter. Floating with the popular\r\ncurrent of mortal thought without questioning the re- [25]\r\nliability of its conclusions, we do what others do,\r\nbelieve what others believe, and say what others say.\r\nCommon consent is contagious, and it makes disease\r\ncatching.\r\n\r\nPeople believe in infectious and contagious diseases, [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 229.]\r\n\r\nand that any one is liable to have them under certain [1]\r\npredisposing or exciting causes. This mental state pre-\r\npares one to have any disease whenever there appear the\r\ncircumstances which he believes produce it. If he believed\r\nas sincerely that health is catching when exposed to con- [5]\r\ntact with healthy people, he would catch their state of\r\nfeeling quite as surely and with better effect than he does\r\nthe sick man’s.\r\n\r\nIf only the people would believe that good is more\r\ncontagious than evil, since God is omnipresence, how [10]\r\nmuch more certain would be the doctor’s success, and\r\nthe clergyman’s conversion of sinners. And if only the\r\npulpit would encourage faith in God in this direction,\r\nand faith in Mind over all other influences governing\r\nthe receptivity of the body, theology would teach man [15]\r\nas David taught: “Because thou hast made the Lord,\r\nwhich is my refuge, even the most High thy habitation;\r\nthere shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague\r\ncome nigh thy dwelling.”\r\n\r\nThe confidence of mankind in contagious disease would [20]\r\nthus become beautifully less; and in the same propor-\r\ntion would faith in the power of God to heal and to save\r\nmankind increase, until the whole human race would\r\nbecome healthier, holier, happier, and longer lived. A\r\ncalm, Christian state of mind is a better preventive of [25]\r\ncontagion than a drug, or than any other possible sana-\r\ntive method; and the “perfect Love” that “casteth out\r\nfear” is a sure defense.\r\n\r\n[Page 230.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove Your Time\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess in life depends upon persistent effort, upon [1]\r\nthe improvement of moments more than upon any other\r\none thing. A great amount of time is consumed in talking\r\nnothing, doing nothing, and indecision as to what one\r\nshould do. If one would be successful in the future, let [5]\r\nhim make the most of the present.\r\n\r\nThree ways of wasting time, one of which is con-\r\ntemptible, are gossiping mischief, making lingering calls,\r\nand mere motion when at work, thinking of nothing or [10]\r\nplanning for some amusement,—travel of limb more\r\nthan mind. Rushing around smartly is no proof of ac-\r\ncomplishing much.\r\n\r\nAll successful individuals have become such by hard\r\nwork; by improving moments before they pass into hours, [15]\r\nand hours that other people may occupy in the pursuit\r\nof pleasure. They spend no time in sheer idleness, in\r\ntalking when they have nothing to say, in building air-\r\ncastles or floating off on the wings of sense: all of which\r\ndrop human life into the ditch of nonsense, and worse [20]\r\nthan waste its years.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Let us, then, be up and doing,\r\n      With a heart for any fate;\r\n    Still achieving, still pursuing,\r\n      Learn to labor and to wait.” [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanksgiving Dinner\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful group! needing but canvas and the\r\ntouch of an artist to render it pathetic, tender, gorgeous.\r\n\r\n[Page 231.]\r\n\r\nAge, on whose hoary head the almond-blossom formed a [1]\r\ncrown of glory; middle age, in smiles and the full fruition\r\nof happiness; infancy, exuberant with joy,—ranged side\r\nby side. The sober-suited grandmother, rich in ex-\r\nperience, had seen sunshine and shadow fall upon ninety- [5]\r\nsix years. Four generations sat at that dinner-table.\r\nThe rich viands made busy many appetites; but, what\r\nof the poor! Willingly—though I take no stock in\r\nspirit-rappings—would I have had the table give a\r\nspiritual groan for the unfeasted ones. [10]\r\n\r\nUnder the skilful carving of the generous host, the\r\nmammoth turkey grew beautifully less. His was the\r\nglory to vie with guests in the dexterous use of knife and\r\nfork, until delicious pie, pudding, and fruit caused un-\r\nconditional surrender. [15]\r\n\r\nAnd the baby! Why, he made a big hole, with two\r\nincisors, in a big pippin, and bit the finger presump-\r\ntuously poked into the little mouth to arrest the peel!\r\nThen he was caught walking! one, two, three steps,—\r\nand papa knew that he could walk, but grandpa was [20]\r\ntaken napping. Now! baby has tumbled, soft as thistle-\r\ndown, on the floor; and instead of a real set-to at crying,\r\na look of cheer and a toy from mamma bring the soft\r\nlittle palms patting together, and pucker the rosebud\r\nmouth into saying, “Oh, pretty!” That was a scientific [25]\r\nbaby; and his first sitting-at-table on Thanksgiving Day—\r\nyes, and his little rainbowy life—brought sunshine\r\nto every heart. How many homes echo such tones of\r\nheartfelt joy on Thanksgiving Day! But, alas! for the\r\ndesolate home; for the tear-filled eyes looking longingly [30]\r\nat the portal through which the loved one comes not, or\r\ngazing silently on the vacant seat at fireside and board—\r\n\r\n[Page 232.]\r\n\r\nGod comfort them all! we inwardly prayed—but the [1]\r\nmemory was too much; and, turning from it, in a bumper\r\nof pudding-sauce we drank to peace, and plenty, and\r\nhappy households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian Science\r\n\r\n\r\nThis age is reaching out towards the perfect Principle\r\nof things; is pushing towards perfection in art, inven-\r\ntion, and manufacture. Why, then, should religion be\r\nstereotyped, and we not obtain a more perfect and prac-\r\ntical Christianity? It will never do to be behind the [10]\r\ntimes in things most essential, which proceed from the\r\nstandard of right that regulates human destiny. Human\r\nskill but foreshadows what is next to appear as its divine\r\norigin. Proportionately as we part with material systems\r\nand theories, personal doctrines and dogmas, meekly to [15]\r\nascend the hill of Science, shall we reach the maximum\r\nof perfection in all things.\r\n\r\nSpirit is omnipotent; hence a more spiritual Chris-\r\ntianity will be one having more power, having perfected\r\nin Science that most important of all arts,—healing. [20]\r\n\r\nMetaphysical healing, or Christian Science, is a de-\r\nmand of the times. Every man and every woman would\r\ndesire and demand it, if he and she knew its infinite\r\nvalue and firm basis. The unerring and fixed Principle\r\nof all healing is God; and this Principle should be [25]\r\nsought from the love of good, from the most spiritual\r\nand unselfish motives. Then will it be understood to be\r\nof God, and not of man; and this will prevent mankind\r\nfrom striking out promiscuously, teaching and practising\r\n\r\n[Page 233.]\r\n\r\nin the _name_ of Science without knowing its fundamental [1]\r\nPrinciple.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know that a malpractice of the best\r\nsystem will result in the worst form of medicine. More-\r\nover, the feverish, disgusting pride of those who call [5]\r\nthemselves metaphysicians or Scientists,—but are such\r\nin name only,—fanned by the breath of mental mal-\r\npractice, is the death’s-head at the feast of Truth; the\r\nmonkey in harlequin jacket that will retard the onward\r\nmarch of life-giving Science, if not understood and with- [10]\r\nstood, and so strangled in its attempts.\r\n\r\nThe standard of metaphysical healing is traduced by\r\nthinking to put into the old garment of drugging the new\r\ncloth of metaphysics; or by trying to twist the fatal\r\nmagnetic force of mortal mind, termed hypnotism, into [15]\r\na more fashionable cut and naming that “mind-cure,”\r\nor—which is still worse in the eyes of Truth—terming\r\nit metaphysics! Substituting good words for a good life,\r\nfair-seeming for straightforward character, mental mal-\r\npractice for the practice of true medicine, is a poor shift [20]\r\nfor the weak and worldly who think the standard of\r\nChristian Science too high for them.\r\n\r\nWhat think you of a scientist in mathematics who finds\r\nfault with the exactness of the rule because unwilling to\r\nwork hard enough to practise it? The perfection of the [25]\r\nrule of Christian Science is what constitutes its utility:\r\nhaving a true standard, if some fall short, others will\r\napproach it; and these are they only who adhere to that\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nMatter must be understood as a false belief or product so [30]\r\nof mortal mind: whence we learn that sensation is not\r\nin matter, but in this so-called mind; that we see and\r\n\r\n[Page 234.]\r\n\r\nfeel disease only by reason of our belief in it: then shall [1]\r\nmatter remain no longer to blind us to Spirit, and clog\r\nthe wheels of progress. We spread our wings in vain when\r\nwe attempt to mount above error by speculative views\r\nof Truth. [5]\r\n\r\nLove is the Principle of divine Science; and Love is\r\nnot learned of the material senses, nor gained by a culpa-\r\nble attempt to seem what we have not lifted ourselves\r\nto _be_, namely, a Christian. In love for man, we gain a\r\ntrue sense of Love as God; and in no other way can we [10]\r\nreach this spiritual sense, and rise—and still rise—to\r\nthings most essential and divine. What hinders man’s\r\nprogress is his vain conceit, the Phariseeism of the times,\r\nalso his effort to steal from others and avoid hard work;\r\nerrors which can never find a place in Science. Empiri- [15]\r\ncal knowledge is worse than useless: it never has advanced\r\nman a single step in the scale of being.\r\n\r\nThat one should have ventured on such unfamiliar\r\nground, and, self-forgetful, should have gone on to estab-\r\nlish this mighty system of metaphysical healing, called [20]\r\nChristian Science, against such odds,—even the entire\r\ncurrent of mortality,—is matter of grave wonderment to\r\nprofound thinkers. That, in addition to this, she has made\r\nsome progress, has seen far into the spiritual facts of be-\r\ning which constitute physical and mental perfection, in [25]\r\nthe midst of an age so sunken in sin and sensuality, seems\r\nto them still more inconceivable.\r\n\r\nIn this new departure of metaphysics, God is regarded\r\nmore as absolute, supreme; and Christ is clad with a\r\nricher illumination as our Saviour from sickness, sin, [30]\r\nand death. God’s fatherliness as Life, Truth, and Love,\r\nmakes His sovereignty glorious.\r\n\r\n[Page 235.]\r\n\r\nBy this system, too, man has a changed recognition [1]\r\nof his relation to God. He is no longer obliged to sin,\r\nbe sick, and die to reach heaven, but is required and em-\r\npowered to conquer sin, sickness, and death; thus, as\r\nimage and likeness, to reflect Him who destroys death [5]\r\nand hell. By this reflection, man becomes the partaker\r\nof that Mind whence sprang the universe.\r\n\r\nIn Christian Science, progress is demonstration, not\r\ndoctrine. This Science is ameliorative and regenerative,\r\ndelivering mankind from all error through the light and [10]\r\nlove of Truth. It gives to the race loftier desires and new\r\npossibilities. It lays the axe at the root of the tree of\r\nknowledge, to cut down all that bringeth not forth good\r\nfruit; “and blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended\r\nin me.” It touches mind to more spiritual issues, sys- [15]\r\ntematizes action, gives a keener sense of Truth and a\r\nstronger desire for it.\r\n\r\nHungering and thirsting after a better life, we shall\r\nhave it, and become Christian Scientists; learn God\r\naright, and know something of the ideal man, the real [20]\r\nman, harmonious and eternal. This movement of thought\r\nmust push on the ages: it must start the wheels of reason\r\naright, educate the affections to higher resources, and\r\nleave Christianity unbiased by the superstitions of a\r\nsenior period. [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInjustice\r\n\r\n\r\nWho that has tried to follow the divine precept, “All\r\nthings whatsoever ye would that men should do unto\r\nyou, do ye even so to them,” has not suffered from the\r\n\r\n[Page 236.]\r\n\r\nsituation?—has not found that human passions in their [1]\r\nreaction have misjudged motives?\r\n\r\nThroughout our experience since undertaking the\r\nlabor of uplifting the race, we have been made the re-\r\npository of little else than the troubles, indiscretions, [5]\r\nand errors of others; until thought has shrunk from\r\ncontact with family difficulties, and become weary with\r\nstudy to counsel wisely whenever giving advice on per-\r\nsonal topics.\r\n\r\nTo the child complaining of his parents we have said, [10]\r\n“Love and honor thy parents, and yield obedience to\r\nthem in all that is right; but you have the rights of con-\r\nscience, as we all have, and must follow God in all your\r\nways.”\r\n\r\nWhen yielding to constant solicitations of husband or [15]\r\nwife to give, to one or the other, advice concerning diffi-\r\nculties and the best way to overcome them, we have done\r\nthis to the best of our ability,—and always with the pur-\r\npose to restore harmony and prevent dishonor. In such\r\ncases we have said, “Take no counsel of a mortal, even [20]\r\nthough it be your best friend; but be guided by God\r\nalone;” meaning by this, Be not estranged from each\r\nother by anything that is said to you, but seek in divine\r\nLove the remedy for all human discord.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding one’s good intentions, in some [25]\r\nway or at some step in one’s efforts to help another, as\r\na general rule, one will be blamed for all that is not right:\r\nbut this must not deter us from doing our duty, whatever\r\nelse may appear, and at whatever cost.\r\n\r\n[Page 237.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReformers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe olden opinion that hell is fire and brimstone, has\r\nyielded somewhat to the metaphysical fact that suffering\r\nis a thing of mortal mind instead of body: so, in place\r\nof material flames and odor, mental anguish is generally [5]\r\naccepted as the penalty for sin. This changed belief\r\nhas wrought a change in the actions of men. Not a few\r\nindividuals serve God (or try to) from fear; but remove\r\nthat fear, and the worst of human passions belch forth\r\ntheir latent fires. Some people never repent until earth [10]\r\ngives them such a cup of gall that conscience strikes home;\r\nthen they are brought to realize how impossible it is to\r\nsin and not suffer. All the different phases of error in\r\nhuman nature the reformer must encounter and help to\r\neradicate. [15]\r\n\r\nThis period is not essentially one of conscience: few\r\nfeel and live now as when this nation began, and our\r\nforefathers’ prayers blended with the murmuring winds\r\nof their forest home. This is a period of doubt, inquiry,\r\nspeculation, selfishness; of divided interests, marvellous [20]\r\ngood, and mysterious evil. But sin can only work out\r\nits own destruction; and reform does and must push on\r\nthe growth of mankind.\r\n\r\nHonor to faithful merit is delayed, and always has\r\nbeen; but it is sure to follow. The very streets through [25]\r\nwhich Garrison was dragged were draped in honor of\r\nthe dead hero who did the hard work, the immortal work,\r\nof loosing the fetters of one form of human slavery. I\r\nremember, when a girl, and he visited my father, how a\r\nchildish fear clustered round his coming. I had heard [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 238.]\r\n\r\nthe awful story that “he helped ‘niggers’ kill the white [1]\r\nfolks!” Even the loving children are sometimes made\r\nto believe a lie, and to hate reformers. It is pleasant,\r\nnow, to contrast with that childhood’s wrong the reverence\r\nof my riper years for all who dare to be true, honest to [5]\r\ntheir convictions, and strong of purpose.\r\n\r\nThe reformer has no time to give in defense of his\r\nown life’s incentive, since no sacrifice is too great for the\r\nsilent endurance of his love. What has not unselfed love\r\nachieved for the race? All that ever was accomplished, [10]\r\nand more than history has yet recorded. The reformer\r\nworks on unmentioned, save when he is abused or his\r\nwork is utilized in the interest of somebody. He may\r\nlabor for the establishment of a cause which is fraught\r\nwith infinite blessings,—health, virtue, and heaven; [15]\r\nbut what of all that? Who should care for everybody?\r\nIt is enough, say they, to care for a few. Yet the good\r\nis done, and the love that foresees more to do, stimulate\r\nphilanthropy and are an ever-present reward. Let one’s\r\nlife answer well these questions, and it already hath a [20]\r\nbenediction:\r\n\r\nHave you renounced self? Are you faithful? Do\r\nyou love?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy Sick\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequent public allegement that I am “sick, unable [25]\r\nto speak a loud word,” or that I died of palsy, and am\r\ndead,—is but another evidence of the falsehoods kept\r\nconstantly before the public.\r\n\r\nWhile I accord these evil-mongers due credit for their\r\n\r\n[Page 239.]\r\n\r\ndesire, let me say to you, dear reader: Call at the [1]\r\nMassachusetts Metaphysical College, in 1889, and judge\r\nfor yourself whether I can talk—and laugh too! I\r\nnever was in better health. I have had but four\r\ndays’ vacation for the past year, and am about to com- [5]\r\nmence a large class in Christian Science. Lecturing,\r\nwriting, preaching, teaching, etc., give fair proof that\r\nmy shadow is not growing less; and substance is taking\r\nlarger proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’ve Got Cold”\r\n\r\n\r\nOut upon the sidewalk one winter morning, I observed\r\na carriage draw up before a stately mansion; a portly\r\ngentleman alight, and take from his carriage the ominous\r\nhand-trunk.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” thought I, “somebody has to take it; and what [15]\r\nmay the potion be?”\r\n\r\nJust then a tiny, sweet face appeared in the vestibule,\r\nand red nose, suffused eyes, cough, and tired look, told\r\nthe story; but, looking up quaintly, the poor child said,—\r\n\r\n“I’ve got cold, doctor.” [20]\r\n\r\nHer apparent pride at sharing in a popular influenza\r\nwas comical. However, her dividend, when compared\r\nwith that of the household stockholders, was new; and\r\ndoubtless their familiarity with what the stock paid, made\r\nthem more serious over it. [25]\r\n\r\nWhat if that sweet child, so bravely confessing that\r\nshe had something that she ought not to have, and which\r\nmamma thought must be gotten rid of, had been taught\r\nthe value of saying even more bravely, and believing\r\nit,— [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 240.]\r\n\r\n“I have _not_ got cold.” [1]\r\n\r\nWhy, the doctor’s squills and bills would have been\r\navoided; and through the cold air the little one would\r\nhave been bounding with sparkling eyes, and ruby cheeks\r\npainted and fattened by metaphysical hygiene. [5]\r\n\r\nParents and doctors must not take the sweet freshness\r\nout of the children’s lives by that flippant caution, “You\r\nwill get cold.”\r\n\r\nPredicting danger does not dignify life, whereas fore-\r\ncasting liberty and joy does; for these are strong pro- [10]\r\nmoters of health and happiness. All education should\r\ncontribute to moral and physical strength and freedom.\r\nIf a cold could get into the body without the assent of\r\nmind, nature would take it out as gently, or let it remain\r\nas harmlessly, as it takes the frost out of the ground or [15]\r\nputs it into the ice-cream to the satisfaction of all.\r\n\r\nThe sapling bends to the breeze, while the sturdy oak,\r\nwith form and inclination fixed, breasts the tornado. It\r\nis easier to incline the early thought rightly, than the\r\nbiased mind. Children not mistaught, naturally love [20]\r\nGod; for they are pure-minded, affectionate, and gen-\r\nerally brave. Passions, appetites, pride, selfishness, have\r\nslight sway over the fresh, unbiased thought.\r\n\r\nTeach the children early self-government, and teach\r\nthem nothing that is wrong. If they see their father with [25]\r\na cigarette in his mouth—suggest to them that the habit\r\nof smoking is not nice, and that nothing but a loathsome\r\nworm _naturally_ chews tobacco. Likewise soberly inform\r\nthem that “Battle-Axe Plug” takes off men’s heads; or,\r\nleaving these on, that it takes from their bodies a sweet [30]\r\nsomething which belongs to nature,—namely, pure\r\nodors.\r\n\r\n[Page 241.]\r\n\r\nFrom a religious point of view, the faith of both youth [1]\r\nand adult should centre as steadfastly in God to benefit\r\nthe body, as to benefit the mind. Body and mind are\r\ncorrelated in man’s salvation; for man will no more\r\nenter heaven sick than as a sinner, and Christ’s Christi- [5]\r\nanity casts out sickness as well as sin of every sort.\r\n\r\nTest, if you will, metaphysical healing on two patients:\r\none having morals to be healed, the other having a physi-\r\ncal ailment. Use as your medicine the great alterative,\r\nTruth: give to the immoralist a mental dose that says, [10]\r\n“You have no pleasure in sin,” and witness the effects.\r\n\r\nEither he will hate you, and try to make others do like-\r\nwise, so taking a dose of error big enough apparently to\r\nneutralize your Truth, else he will doubtingly await the\r\nresult; during which interim, by constant combat and [15]\r\ndireful struggles, you get the victory and Truth heals him\r\nof the moral malady.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to the bedridden sufferer admin-\r\nister this alternative Truth: “God never made you sick:\r\nthere is no necessity for pain; and Truth destroys the [20]\r\nerror that insists on the necessity of any man’s bondage\r\nto sin and sickness. “Ye shall know the truth, and the\r\ntruth shall make you free.’ ”\r\n\r\nThen, like blind Bartimeus, the doubting heart looks\r\nup through faith, and your patient rejoices in the gospel [25]\r\nof health.\r\n\r\nThus, you see, it is easier to heal the physical than the\r\nmoral ailment. When divine Truth and Love heal, of\r\nsin, the sinner who is at ease in sin, how much more should\r\nthese heal, of sickness, the sick who are dis-eased, dis- [30]\r\ncomforted, and who long for relief!\r\n\r\n[Page 242.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Prayer And Healing”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe article of Professor T——, having the above cap- [1]\r\ntion, published in _Zion’s Herald_, December third, came\r\nnot to my notice until January ninth. In it the Professor\r\noffered me, as President of the Metaphysical College in\r\nBoston, or one of my students, the liberal sum of one [5]\r\nthousand dollars if either would reset certain dislocations\r\nwithout the use of hands, and two thousand dollars if\r\neither would give sight to one born blind.\r\n\r\nWill the gentleman accept my thanks due to his gener- [10]\r\nosity; for, if I should accept his bid on Christianity, he\r\nwould lose his money.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause I performed more difficult tasks fifteen years\r\nago. At present, I am in another department of Christian [15]\r\nwork, “where there shall no signs be given them,” for\r\nthey shall be instructed in the Principle of Christian\r\nScience that furnishes its own proof.\r\n\r\nBut, to reward his liberality, I offer him three thou-\r\nsand dollars if he will heal one single case of opium-eating [20]\r\nwhere the patient is very low and taking morphine powder\r\nin its most concentrated form, at the rate of one ounce in\r\ntwo weeks,—having taken it twenty years; and he is to\r\ncure that habit in three days, leaving the patient well. I\r\ncured precisely such a case in 1869. [25]\r\n\r\nAlso, Mr. C. M. H——, of Boston, formerly partner\r\nof George T. Brown, pharmacist, No. 5 Beacon St., will\r\ntell you that he was my student in December, 1884; and\r\nthat before leaving the class he took a patient thoroughly\r\naddicted to the use of opium—if she went without it [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 243.]\r\n\r\ntwenty-four hours she would have delirium—and in [1]\r\nforty-eight hours cured her perfectly of this habit,\r\nwith no bad results, but with decided improvement in\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nI have not yet made surgery one of the mental branches [5]\r\ntaught in my college; although students treat sprains,\r\ncontusions, etc., successfully. In the case of sprain of the\r\nwrist-joint, where the regular doctor had put on splints\r\nand bandages to remain six weeks, a student of mine\r\nremoved these appliances the same day and effected the [10]\r\ncure in less than one week. Reference, Mrs. M. A. F——,\r\n107 Eutaw Street, East Boston.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Professor, that every system of medi-\r\ncine claims more than it practises. If the system is Science,\r\nit includes of necessity the Principle, which the learner [15]\r\ncan demonstrate only in proportion as he understands it.\r\nBoasting is unbecoming a mortal’s poor performances.\r\nMy Christian students are proverbially modest: their\r\nworks alone should declare them, since my system of medi-\r\ncine is not generally understood. There are charlatans [20]\r\nin “mind-cure,” who practise on the basis of matter, or\r\nhuman will, not Mind.\r\n\r\nThe Professor alludes to Paul’s advice to Timothy.\r\nDid he refer to that questionable counsel, “Take a little\r\nwine for thy stomach’s sake”? Even doctors disagree [25]\r\non that prescription: some of the medical faculty will\r\ntell you that alcoholic drinks cause the coats of the stomach\r\nto thicken and the organ to contract; will prevent the\r\nsecretions of the gastric juice, and induce ulceration,\r\nbleeding, vomiting, death. [30]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Professor quotes, in justification of material\r\nmethods, and as veritable: “He took a bone from the\r\n\r\n[Page 244.]\r\n\r\nside of Adam, closed up the wound thereof, and builded [1]\r\nup the woman.” (Gen. ii. 21.)\r\n\r\nHere we have the Professor on the platform of Christian\r\nScience! even a “surgical operation” that he says was\r\nperformed by divine power,—Mind alone constructing [5]\r\nthe human system, before surgical instruments were\r\ninvented, and closing the incisions of the flesh.\r\n\r\nHe further states that God cannot save the soul without\r\ncompliance to ordained conditions. But, we ask, have\r\nthose conditions named in Genesis been perpetuated in [10]\r\nthe multiplication of mankind? And, are the conditions\r\nof salvation mental, or physical; are they bodily penance\r\nand torture, or repentance and reform, which are the\r\naction of mind?\r\n\r\nHe asks, “Has the law been abrogated that demands [15]\r\nthe employment of visible agencies for specific ends?”\r\n\r\nWill he accept my reply as derived from the life and\r\nteachings of Jesus?—who annulled the so-called laws of\r\nmatter by the higher law of Spirit, causing him to walk\r\nthe wave, turn the water into wine, make the blind to see, [20]\r\nthe deaf to hear, the lame to walk, and the dead to be\r\nraised without matter-agencies. And he did this for man’s\r\nexample; not to teach himself, but others, the way of\r\nhealing and salvation. He said, “And other sheep I have,\r\nwhich are not of this fold.” [25]\r\n\r\nThe teachings and demonstration of Jesus were for\r\nall peoples and for all time; not for a privileged class or\r\na restricted period, but for as many as should believe in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAre the discoverers of quinine, cocaine, etc., espe- [30]\r\ncially the children of our Lord because of their medical\r\ndiscoveries?\r\n\r\n[Page 245.]\r\n\r\nWe have no record showing that our Master ever used, [1]\r\nor recommended others to use, drugs; but we have his\r\nwords, and the prophet’s, as follows: “Take no thought,\r\nsaying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?”\r\n“And Asa ... sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians. [5]\r\nAnd Asa slept with his fathers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeritas Odium Parit\r\n\r\n\r\nThe combined efforts of the materialistic portion of\r\nthe pulpit and press in 1885, to retard by misrepresen-\r\ntation the stately goings of Christian Science, are giving [10]\r\nit new impetus and energy; calling forth the _vox populi_\r\nand directing more critical observation to its uplifting\r\ninfluence upon the health, morals, and spirituality of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nTheir movements indicate fear and weakness, a physi- [15]\r\ncal and spiritual need that Christian Science should re-\r\nmove with glorious results. The conclusion cannot now\r\nbe pushed, that women have no rights that man is bound\r\nto respect. This is woman’s hour, in all the good tend-\r\nencies, charities, and reforms of to-day. It is difficult [20]\r\nto say which may be most mischievous to the human\r\nheart, the praise or the dispraise of men.\r\n\r\nI have loved the Church and followed it, thinking that\r\nit was following Christ; but, if the pulpit allows the people\r\nto go no further in the direction of Christlikeness, and [25]\r\nrejects apostolic Christianity, seeking to stereotype infinite\r\nTruth, it is a thing to be thankful for that one can walk\r\nalone the straight and narrow way; that, in the words of\r\nWendell Phillips, “one with God is a majority.”\r\n\r\n[Page 246.]\r\n\r\nIt is the pulpit and press, clerical robes and the pro- [1]\r\nhibiting of free speech, that cradles and covers the sins of\r\nthe world,—all unmitigated systems of crime; and it\r\nrequires the enlightenment of these worthies, through\r\ncivil and religious reform, to blot out all inhuman codes. [5]\r\nIt was the Southern pulpit and press that influenced the\r\npeople to wrench from man both human and divine rights,\r\nin order to subserve the interests of wealth, religious caste,\r\ncivil and political power. And the pulpit had to be\r\npurged of that sin by human gore,—when the love of [10]\r\nChrist would have washed it divinely away in Christian\r\nScience!\r\n\r\nThe cry of the colored slave has scarcely been heard\r\nand hushed, when from another direction there comes\r\nanother sharp cry of oppression. Another form of inhumanity [15]\r\nlifts its hydra head to forge anew the old fetters;\r\nto shackle conscience, stop free speech, slander, vilify;\r\nto invite its prey, then turn and refuse the victim a solitary\r\nvindication in this most unprecedented warfare.\r\n\r\nA conflict more terrible than the battle of Gettysburg [20]\r\nawaits the crouching wrong that refused to yield its\r\nprey the peace of a desert, when a voice was heard\r\ncrying in the wilderness,—the spiritual famine of 1866,\r\n—“Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths\r\nstraight.” [25]\r\n\r\nShall religious intolerance, arrayed against the rights\r\nof man, again deluge the earth in blood? The question\r\nat issue with mankind is: Shall we have a spiritual Chris-\r\ntianity and a spiritual healing, or a materialistic religion\r\nand a _materia medica_? [30]\r\n\r\nThe advancing faith and hope of Christianity, the\r\nearnest seeking after practical truth that shall cast out\r\n\r\n[Page 247.]\r\n\r\nerror and heal the sick, wisely demand for man his God- [1]\r\ngiven heritage, both human and divine rights; namely,\r\nthat his honest convictions and _proofs_ of advancing truth\r\nbe allowed due consideration, and treated not as pearls\r\ntrampled upon. [5]\r\n\r\nThose familiar with my history are more tolerant; those\r\nwho know me, know that I found health in just what I\r\nteach. I have professed Christianity a half-century; and\r\nnow I calmly challenge the world, upon fair investigation,\r\nto furnish a single instance of departure in one of my [10]\r\nworks from the highest possible ethics.\r\n\r\nThe charges against my views are false, but natural,\r\nsince those bringing them do not understand my state-\r\nment of the Science I introduce, and are unwilling to be\r\ntaught it, even gratuitously. If they did understand it, they [15]\r\ncould demonstrate this Science by healing the sick; hence\r\nthe injustice of their interpretations.\r\n\r\nTo many, the healing force developed by Christian\r\nScience seems a mystery, because they do not understand\r\nthat Spirit controls body. They acknowledge the exist- [20]\r\nence of mortal mind, but believe it to reside in matter\r\nof the brain; but that man is the idea of infinite Mind,\r\nis not so easily accepted. That which is temporary\r\nseems, to the common estimate, solid and substantial.\r\nIt is much easier for people to believe that the body [25]\r\naffects mind, than that the body is an expression of\r\nmind, and reflects harmony or discord according to\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nEverything that God created, He pronounced good.\r\nHe never made sickness. Hence _that_ is only an evil belief [30]\r\nof mortal mind, which must be met, in every instance,\r\nwith a denial by Truth.\r\n\r\n[Page 248.]\r\n\r\nThis is the “new tongue,” the language of them that [1]\r\n“lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover,” whose\r\nspiritual interpretation they refuse to hear. For instance:\r\nthe literal meaning of the passage “lay hands on the sick”\r\nwould be manipulation; its moral meaning, found in the [5]\r\n“new tongue,” is spiritual power,—as, in another Scripture,\r\n“I will triumph in the works of Thy hands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalsehood\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks showed a just estimate of the person they\r\ncalled slanderer, when they made the word synonymous [10]\r\nwith devil. If the simple falsehoods uttered about me\r\nwere compounded, the mixture would be labelled thus:\r\n“Religionists’ mistaken views of Mrs. Eddy’s book, ‘Sci-\r\nence and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and the\r\nmalice aforethought of sinners.” [15]\r\n\r\nThat I take opium; that I am an infidel, a mesmerist,\r\na medium, a “pantheist;” or that my hourly life is prayerless,\r\nor not in strict obedience to the Mosaic Decalogue,—\r\nis not more true than that I am dead, as is oft reported.\r\nThe _St. Louis Democrat_ is alleged to have reported my [20]\r\ndemise, and to have said that I died of poison, and bequeathed\r\nmy property to Susan Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe opium falsehood has only this to it: Many years\r\nago my regular physician prescribed morphine, which I\r\ntook, when he could do no more for me. Afterwards, [25]\r\nthe glorious revelations of Christian Science saved me\r\nfrom that necessity and made me well, since which time\r\nI have not taken drugs, with the following exception:\r\nWhen the mental malpractice of poisoning people was\r\n\r\n[Page 249.]\r\n\r\nfirst undertaken by a mesmerist, to test that malprac- [1]\r\ntice I experimented by taking some large doses of mor-\r\nphine, to see if Christian Science could not obviate its\r\neffect; and I say with tearful thanks, “The drug had\r\nno effect upon me whatever.” The hour has struck, [5]\r\n—“If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThe false report that I have appropriated other people’s\r\nmanuscripts in my works, has been met and answered\r\n_legally_. Both in private and public life, and especially [10]\r\nthrough my teachings, it is well known that I am not a\r\nspiritualist, a pantheist, or prayerless. The most devout\r\nmembers of evangelical churches will say this, as well as\r\nmy intimate acquaintances. None are permitted to re-\r\nmain in my College building whose morals are not un- [15]\r\nquestionable. I have neither purchased nor ordered a\r\ndrug since my residence in Boston; and to my knowledge,\r\nnot one has been sent to my house, unless it was something\r\nto remove stains or vermin.\r\n\r\nThe report that I was dead arose no doubt from the [20]\r\ncombined efforts of some malignant students, expelled\r\nfrom my College for immorality, to kill me: of their mental\r\ndesign to do this I have proof, but no fear. My heavenly\r\nFather will never leave me comfortless, in the amplitude\r\nof His love; coming nearer in my need, more tenderly to [25]\r\nsave and bless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a word! I am in awe before it. Over what\r\nworlds on worlds it hath range and is sovereign! the un-\r\n\r\n[Page 250.]\r\n\r\nderived, the incomparable, the infinite All of good, the [1]\r\n_alone_ God, is Love.\r\n\r\nBy what strange perversity is the best become the most\r\nabused,—either as a quality or as an entity? Mortals\r\nmisrepresent and miscall affection; they make it what [5]\r\nit is not, and doubt what it is. The so-called affection\r\npursuing its victim is a butcher fattening the lamb to\r\nslay it. What the lower propensities express, should be\r\nrepressed by the sentiments. No word is more mis-\r\nconstrued; no sentiment less understood. The divine [10]\r\nsignificance of Love is distorted into human qualities,\r\nwhich in their human abandon become jealousy and\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nLove is not something put upon a shelf, to be taken\r\ndown on rare occasions with sugar-tongs and laid on a [15]\r\nrose-leaf. I make strong demands on love, call for active\r\nwitnesses to prove it, and noble sacrifices and grand\r\nachievements as its results. Unless these appear, I cast\r\naside the word as a sham and counterfeit, having no ring\r\nof the true metal. Love cannot be a mere abstraction, or [20]\r\ngoodness without activity and power. As a human quality,\r\nthe glorious significance of affection is more than words:\r\nit is the tender, unselfish deed done in secret; the silent,\r\nceaseless prayer; the self-forgetful heart that overflows;\r\nthe veiled form stealing on an errand of mercy, out of a [25]\r\nside door; the little feet tripping along the sidewalk; the\r\ngentle hand opening the door that turns toward want and\r\nwoe, sickness and sorrow, and thus lighting the dark\r\nplaces of earth.\r\n\r\n[Page 251.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress On The Fourth Of July At Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., Before\r\n2,500 Members Of The Mother Church, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\nMy beloved brethren, who have come all the way from\r\nthe Pacific to the Atlantic shore, from the Palmetto to the [5]\r\nPine Tree State, I greet you; my hand may not touch\r\nyours to-day, but my heart will with tenderness untalkable.\r\n\r\nHis Honor, Mayor Woodworth, has welcomed you to\r\nConcord most graciously, voicing the friendship of this\r\ncity and of my native State—loyal to the heart’s core to [10]\r\nreligion, home, friends, and country.\r\n\r\nTo-day we commemorate not only our nation’s civil\r\nand religious freedom, but a greater even, the liberty of\r\nthe sons of God, the inalienable rights and radiant reality\r\nof Christianity, whereof our Master said: “The works [15]\r\nthat I do shall he do;” and, “The kingdom of God cometh\r\nnot with observation” (with knowledge obtained from\r\nthe senses), but “the kingdom of God is within you,”—\r\nwithin the present possibilities of mankind.\r\n\r\nThink of this inheritance! Heaven right here, where [20]\r\nangels are as men, clothed more lightly, and men as angels\r\nwho, burdened for an hour, spring into liberty, and the\r\ngood they would do, that they do, and the evil they would\r\nnot do, that they do not.\r\n\r\nFrom the falling leaves of old-time faiths men learn a [25]\r\nparable of the period, that all error, physical, moral, or\r\nreligious, will fall before Truth demonstrated, even as\r\ndry leaves fall to enrich the soil for fruitage.\r\n\r\nSin, sickness, and disease flee before the evangel of\r\nTruth as the mountain mists before the sun. Truth is [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 252.]\r\n\r\nthe tonic for the sick, and this medicine of Mind is not [1]\r\nnecessarily infinitesimal but infinite. Herein the mental\r\nmedicine of divine metaphysics and the medical systems\r\nof allopathy and homœopathy differ. Mental medi-\r\ncine gains no potency by attenuation, and its largest [5]\r\ndose is never dangerous, but the more the better in every\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nChristian Science classifies thought thus: Right thoughts\r\nare reality and power; wrong thoughts are unreality and\r\npowerless, possessing the nature of dreams. Good thoughts [10]\r\nare potent; evil thoughts are impotent, and they should\r\nappear thus. Continuing this category, we learn that\r\nsick thoughts are unreality and weakness; while healthy\r\nthoughts are reality and strength. My proof of these\r\nnovel propositions is demonstration, whereby any man [15]\r\ncan satisfy himself of their verity.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is not only the acme of Science\r\nbut the crown of Christianity. It is universal. It ap-\r\npeals to man as man; to the whole and not to a por-\r\ntion; to man physically, as well as spiritually, and to all [20]\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nIt has one God. It demonstrates the divine Principle,\r\nrules and practice of the great healer and master of meta-\r\nphysics, Jesus of Nazareth. It spiritualizes religion and\r\nrestores its lost element, namely, healing the sick. It [25]\r\nconsecrates and inspires the teacher and preacher; it\r\nequips the doctor with safe and sure medicine; it en-\r\ncourages and empowers the business man and secures\r\nthe success of honesty. It is the dear children’s toy and\r\nstrong tower; the wise man’s spiritual dictionary; the [30]\r\npoor man’s money; yea, it is the pearl priceless whereof\r\nour Master said, if a man findeth, he goeth and selleth\r\n\r\n[Page 253.]\r\n\r\nall that he hath and buyeth it. Buyeth it! Note the [1]\r\nscope of that saying, even that Christianity is not merely\r\na gift, as St. Paul avers, but is bought with a price, a great\r\nprice; and what man knoweth as did our Master its\r\nvalue, and the price that he paid for it? [5]\r\n\r\nFriends, I am not enough the new woman of the period\r\nfor outdoor speaking, and the incidental platform is not\r\nbroad enough for me, but the speakers that will now ad-\r\ndress you—one a congressman—may improve our\r\nplatforms; and make amends for the nothingness of [10]\r\nmatter with the allness of Mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell Doinge Is The Fruite Of Doinge Well\r\n\r\n\r\nHERRICK\r\n\r\nThis period is big with events. Fraught with history,\r\nit repeats the past and portends much for the future. [15]\r\n\r\nThe Scriptural metaphors,—of the woman in travail,\r\nthe great red dragon that stood ready to devour the child\r\nas soon as it was born, and the husbandmen that said,\r\n“This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the in-\r\nheritance may be ours,”—are type and shadow of this [20]\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nA mother’s love touches the heart of God, and should\r\nit not appeal to human sympathy? Can a mother tell\r\nher child one tithe of the agonies that gave that child\r\nbirth? Can that child conceive of the anguish, until she [25]\r\nherself is become a mother?\r\n\r\nDo the children of this period dream of the spiritual\r\nMother’s sore travail, through the long night, that has\r\nopened their eyes to the light of Christian Science? Cherish\r\n\r\n[Page 254.]\r\n\r\nthese new-born children that filial obedience to which the [1]\r\nDecalogue points with promise of prosperity? Should not\r\nthe loving warning, the far-seeing wisdom, the gentle entreaty,\r\nthe stern rebuke have been heeded, in return for\r\nall that love which brooded tireless over their tender [5]\r\nyears? for all that love that hath fed them with Truth,—\r\neven the bread that cometh down from heaven,—as the\r\nmother-bird tendeth her young in the rock-ribbed nest of\r\nthe raven’s callow brood!\r\n\r\nAnd what of the hope of that parent whose children [10]\r\nrise up against her; when brother slays brother, and\r\nthe strength of union grows weak with wickedness?\r\nThe victim of mad ambition that saith, “This is\r\nthe heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance\r\nmay be ours,” goes on to learn that he must at last [15]\r\nkill this evil in “self” in order to gain the kingdom\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nEnvy, the great red dragon of this hour, would obscure\r\nthe light of Science, take away a third part of the stars\r\nfrom the spiritual heavens, and cast them to the earth. [20]\r\nThis is not Science. _Per contra_, it is the mortal mind\r\nsense—mental healing on a material basis—hurling\r\nits so-called healing at random, filling with hate its\r\ndeluded victims, or resting in silly peace upon the\r\nlaurels of headlong human will. “What shall, therefore, [25]\r\nthe Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy\r\nthe husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n[Page 255.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Gods\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said, cynically, that Christian Scien-\r\ntists set themselves on pedestals, as so many petty deities;\r\nbut there is no fairness or propriety in the aspersion.\r\n\r\nMan is not equal to his Maker. That which is formed [5]\r\nis not cause, but effect; and has no underived power.\r\nBut it is possible, and dutiful, to throw the weight of\r\nthought and action on the side of right, and to be thus\r\nlifted up.\r\n\r\nMan should be found not claiming equality with, but [10]\r\ngrowing into, that altitude of Mind which was in Christ\r\nJesus. He should comprehend, in divine Science, a\r\nrecognition of what the apostle meant when he said:\r\n“The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that\r\nwe are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; [15]\r\nheirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantage Of Mind-Healing\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asked, What are the advantages of your\r\nsystem of healing?\r\n\r\nI claim for healing by Christian Science the following [20]\r\nadvantages:—\r\n\r\n_First:_ It does away with material medicine, and rec-\r\nognizes the fact that the antidote for sickness, as well\r\nas for sin, may be found in God, the divine Mind.\r\n\r\n_Second:_ It is more effectual than drugs, and cures [25]\r\nwhere they fail, because it is this divine antidote, and\r\nmetaphysics is above physics.\r\n\r\n[Page 256.]\r\n\r\n_Third:_ Persons who have been healed by Christian [1]\r\nScience are not only cured of their belief in disease, but\r\nthey are at the same time improved morally. The body\r\nis governed by Mind, and mortal mind must be corrected\r\nin order to make the body harmonious. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Card\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile gratefully acknowledging the public confidence\r\nmanifested in daily letters that protest against receiving\r\ninstruction in the Massachusetts Metaphysical College\r\nfrom any other than Mrs. Eddy, I feel, deeply, that of [10]\r\nnecessity this imposes on me the severe task of remaining\r\nat present a public servant: also, that this must prevent\r\nmy classes from forming as frequently as was an-\r\nnounced in the October number of the _Journal_, and\r\nnecessitates receiving but a select number of students. [15]\r\nTo meet the old impediment, lack of time, that has oc-\r\ncasioned the irregular intervals between my class terms,\r\nI shall continue to send to each applicant a notice from\r\none to two weeks previous to the opening term.\r\n\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpirit And Law\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to think and to speak of gravitation\r\nas a law of matter; while every quality of matter,\r\nin and of itself, is inert, inanimate, and non-intelligent.\r\nThe assertion that matter is a law, or a lawgiver, is [25]\r\nanomalous. Wherever law is, Mind is; and the notion\r\n\r\n[Page 257.]\r\n\r\nthat Mind can be in matter is rank infidelity, which either [1]\r\nexcludes God from the universe, or includes Him in every\r\nmode and form of evil. Pantheism presupposes that\r\nGod sleeps in the mineral, dreams in the animal, and\r\nwakes in a wicked man. [5]\r\n\r\nThe distinction between that which is and that which\r\nis not law, must be made by Mind and as Mind. Law is\r\neither a moral or an immoral force. The law of God is\r\nthe law of Spirit, a moral and spiritual force of immor-\r\ntal and divine Mind. The so-called law of matter is an [10]\r\nimmoral force of erring mortal mind, _alias_ the minds of\r\nmortals. This so-called force, or law, at work in nature\r\nas a power, prohibition, or license, is cruel and merciless.\r\nIt punishes the innocent, and repays our best deeds\r\nwith sacrifice and suffering. It is a code whose modes [15]\r\ntrifle with joy, and lead to immediate or ultimate death.\r\nIt fosters suspicion where confidence is due, fear where\r\ncourage is requisite, reliance where there should be\r\navoidance, a belief in safety where there is most\r\ndanger. Our Master called it “a murderer from the [20]\r\nbeginning.”\r\n\r\nElectricity, governed by this so-called law, sparkles\r\non the cloud, and strikes down the hoary saint. Floods\r\nswallow up homes and households; and childhood, age,\r\nand manhood go down in the death-dealing wave. Earth- [25]\r\nquakes engulf cities, churches, schools, and mortals.\r\nCyclones kill and destroy, desolating the green earth.\r\nThis pitiless power smites with disease the good Samari-\r\ntan ministering to his neighbor’s need. Even the chamber\r\nwhere the good man surrenders to death is not exempt [30]\r\nfrom this law. Smoothing the pillow of pain may infect\r\nyou with smallpox, according to this lawless law which\r\n\r\n[Page 258.]\r\n\r\ndooms man to die for loving his neighbor as himself,— [1]\r\nwhen Christ has said that love is the fulfilling of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nOur great Ensample, Jesus of Nazareth, met and abol-\r\nished this unrelenting false claim of matter with the [5]\r\nrighteous scorn and power of Spirit. When, through\r\nMind, he restored sight to the blind, he figuratively and\r\nliterally spat upon matter; and, anointing the wounded\r\nspirit with the great truth that God is All, he demon-\r\nstrated the healing power and supremacy of the law of [10]\r\nLife and Love.\r\n\r\nIn the spiritual Genesis of creation, all law was vested\r\nin the Lawgiver, who was a law to Himself. In divine\r\nScience, God is One and All; and, governing Himself,\r\nHe governs the universe. This is the law of creation: [15]\r\n“My defense is of God, which saveth the upright in\r\nheart.” And that infinite Mind governs all things. On\r\nthis infinite Principle of freedom, God named Him-\r\nself, I AM. Error, or Adam, might give names to itself,\r\nand call Mind by the name of matter, but error could [20]\r\nneither name nor demonstrate Spirit. The name, I\r\nAM, indicated no personality that could be paralleled\r\nwith it; but it did declare a mighty individuality,\r\neven the everlasting Father, as infinite consciousness,\r\never-presence, omnipotence; as all law, Life, Truth, and [25]\r\nLove.\r\n\r\nGod’s interpretation of Himself furnishes man with\r\nthe only suitable or true idea of Him; and the divine\r\ndefinition of Deity differs essentially from the human.\r\nIt interprets the law of Spirit, not of matter. It explains [30]\r\nthe eternal dynamics of being, and shows that nature\r\nand man are as harmonious to-day as in the beginning,\r\n\r\n[Page 259.]\r\n\r\nwhen “all things were made by Him; and without Him [1]\r\nwas not any thing made.”\r\n\r\nWhatever appears to be law, but partakes not of the\r\nnature of God, is not law, but is what Jesus declared\r\nit, “a liar, and the father of it.” God is the law of Life, [5]\r\nnot of death; of health, not of sickness; of good, not\r\nof evil. It is this infinitude and oneness of good that\r\nsilences the supposition that evil is a claimant or a claim.\r\nThe consciousness of good has no consciousness or knowl-\r\nedge of evil; and evil is not a quality to be known or [10]\r\neliminated by good: while iniquity, too evil to conceive\r\nof good as being unlike itself, declares that God knows\r\niniquity!\r\n\r\nWhen the Lawgiver was the only law of creation, free-\r\ndom reigned, and was the heritage of man; but this [15]\r\nfreedom was the moral power of good, not of evil: it\r\nwas divine Science, in which God is supreme, and the\r\nonly law of being. In this eternal harmony of Science,\r\nman is not fallen: he is governed in the same rhythm\r\nthat the Scripture describes, when “the morning stars [20]\r\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruth-Healing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spiritual elevator of the human race, physically,\r\nmorally, and Christianly, is the truism that Truth dem-\r\nonstrates good, and is natural; while error, or evil, [25]\r\nis really non-existent, and must have produced its own\r\nillusion,—for it belongs not to nature nor to God. Truth\r\nis the power of God which heals the sick and the sinner,\r\nand is applicable to all the needs of man. It is the uni-\r\n\r\n[Page 260.]\r\n\r\nversal, intelligent Christ-idea illustrated by the life of [1]\r\nJesus, through whose “stripes we are healed.” By con-\r\nflicts, defeats, and triumphs, Christian Science has been\r\nreduced to the understanding of mortals, and found able\r\nto heal them. [5]\r\n\r\nPagan mysticism, Grecian philosophy, or Jewish reli-\r\ngion, never entered into the line of Jesus’ thought or\r\naction. His faith partook not of drugs, matter, nor of\r\nthe travesties of mortal mind. The divine Mind was\r\nhis only instrumentality and potency, in religion or medi- [10]\r\ncine. The Principle of his cure was God, in the laws\r\nof Spirit, not of matter; and these laws annulled all other\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nJesus knew that erring mortal thought holds only in\r\nitself the supposition of evil, and that sin, sickness, and [15]\r\ndeath are its subjective states; also, that pure Mind is\r\nthe truth of being that subjugates and destroys any sup-\r\npositional or elementary opposite to Him who is All.\r\n\r\nTruth is supreme and omnipotent. Then, whatever\r\nelse seemeth to be intelligence or power is false, delud- [20]\r\ning reason and denying revelation, and seeking to dethrone\r\nDeity. The truth of Mind-healing uplifts mankind, by\r\nacknowledging pure Mind as absolute and entire, and\r\nthat evil is naught, although it seems to be.\r\n\r\nPure Mind gives out an atmosphere that heals and [25]\r\nsaves. Words are not always the auxiliaries of Truth.\r\nThe spirit, and not the letter, performs the vital func-\r\ntions of Truth and Love. Mind, imbued with this Science\r\nof healing, is a law unto itself, needing neither license\r\nnor prohibition; but lawless mind, with unseen motives, [30]\r\nand silent mental methods whereby it may injure the\r\nrace, is the highest attenuation of evil.\r\n\r\n[Page 261.]\r\n\r\nAgain: evil, as _mind_, is doomed, already sentenced, [1]\r\npunished; for suffering is commensurate with evil, and\r\nlasts as long as the evil. As _mind_, evil finds no escape\r\nfrom itself; and the sin and suffering it occasions can\r\nonly be removed by reformation. [5]\r\n\r\nAccording to divine law, sin and suffering are not\r\ncancelled by repentance or pardon. Christian Science\r\nnot only elucidates but demonstrates this verity of be-\r\ning; namely, that mortals suffer from the wrong they\r\ncommit, whether intentionally or ignorantly; that every [10]\r\neffect and amplification of wrong will revert to the wrong-\r\ndoer, until he pays his full debt to divine law, and the\r\nmeasure he has meted is measured to him again, full,\r\npressed down, and running over. Surely “the way of\r\nthe transgressor is hard.” [15]\r\n\r\nIn this law of justice, the atonement of Christ loses\r\nno efficacy. Justice is the handmaid of mercy, and show-\r\neth mercy by punishing sin. Jesus said, “I came not to\r\ndestroy the law,”—the divine requirements typified in\r\nthe law of Moses,—“but to fulfil it” in righteousness, [20]\r\nby Truth’s destroying error. No greater type of divine\r\nLove can be presented than effecting so glorious a purpose.\r\nThis spirit of sacrifice always has saved, and still saves\r\nmankind; but by mankind I mean mortals, or a kind\r\nof men after man’s own making. Man as God’s idea [25]\r\nis already saved with an everlasting salvation. It is impossible\r\nto be a Christian Scientist without apprehend-\r\ning the moral law so clearly that, for conscience’ sake,\r\none will either abandon his claim to even a knowledge\r\nof this Science, or else make the claim valid. All Science [30]\r\nis divine. Then, to be Science, it must produce physical\r\nand moral harmony.\r\n\r\n[Page 262.]\r\n\r\nDear readers, our _Journal_ is designed to bring health [1]\r\nand happiness to all households wherein it is permitted\r\nto enter, and to confer increased power to be good and\r\nto do good. If you wish to brighten so pure a purpose,\r\nyou will aid our prospect of fulfilling it by your kind [5]\r\npatronage of _The Christian Science Journal_, now enter-\r\ning upon its fifth volume, clad in Truth-healing’s new\r\nand costly spring dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeart To Heart\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the heart speaks, however simple the words, [10]\r\nits language is always acceptable to those who have\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nI just want to say, I thank you, my dear students, who\r\nare at work conscientiously and assiduously, for the good\r\nyou are doing. I am grateful to you for giving to the [15]\r\nsick relief from pain; for giving joy to the suffering and\r\nhope to the disconsolate; for lifting the fallen and strength-\r\nening the weak, and encouraging the heart grown faint\r\nwith hope deferred. We are made glad by the divine\r\nLove which looseth the chains of sickness and sin, open- [20]\r\ning the prison doors to such as are bound; and we should\r\nbe more grateful than words can express, even through\r\nthis white-winged messenger, our _Journal_.\r\n\r\nWith all the homage beneath the skies, yet were our\r\nburdens heavy but for the Christ-love that makes them [25]\r\nlight and renders the yoke easy. Having his word, you\r\nhave little need of words of approval and encouragement\r\nfrom me. Perhaps it is even selfish in me sometimes to\r\nrelieve my heart of its secrets, because I take so much\r\n\r\n[Page 263.]\r\n\r\npleasure in thus doing; but if my motives are sinister, [1]\r\nthey will harm myself only, and I shall have the unself-\r\nish joy of knowing that the wrong motives are not yours,\r\nto react on yourselves.\r\n\r\nThese two words in Scripture suggest the sweetest [5]\r\nsimiles to be found in any language—_rock_ and _feathers_:\r\n“Upon this rock I will build my church;” “He shall\r\ncover thee with His feathers.” How blessed it is to\r\nthink of you as “beneath the shadow of a great rock in\r\na weary land,” safe in His strength, building on His [10]\r\nfoundation, and covered from the devourer by divine\r\nprotection and affection. Always bear in mind that His\r\npresence, power, and peace meet all human needs and\r\nreflect all bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings To Be Thought Of\r\n\r\n\r\nThe need of their teacher’s counsel, felt by students, [16]\r\nespecially by those at a distance, working assiduously for\r\nour common Cause,—and their constant petitions for\r\nthe same, should be met in the most effectual way.\r\n\r\nTo be responsible for supplying this want, and poise [20]\r\nthe wavering balance on the right side, is impracticable\r\nwithout a full knowledge of the environments. The\r\neducational system of Christian Science lacks the aid\r\nand protection of State laws. The Science is hampered\r\nby immature demonstrations, by the infancy of its dis- [25]\r\ncovery, by incorrect teaching; and especially by unprin-\r\ncipled claimants, whose mad ambition drives them to\r\nappropriate my ideas and discovery, without credit, ap-\r\npreciation, or a single original conception, while they\r\n\r\n[Page 264.]\r\n\r\nquote from other authors and give them credit for every [1]\r\nrandom thought in line with mine.\r\n\r\nMy noble students, who are loyal to Christ, Truth, and\r\nhuman obligations, will not be disheartened in the midst\r\nof this seething sea of sin. They build for time and eter- [5]\r\nnity. The others stumble over misdeeds, and their own\r\nunsubstantiality, without the groundwork of right, till,\r\nlike camera shadows thrown upon the mists of time, they\r\nmelt into darkness.\r\n\r\nUnity is the essential nature of Christian Science. Its [10]\r\nPrinciple is One, and to demonstrate the divine One,\r\ndemands oneness of thought and action.\r\n\r\nMany students enter the Normal class of my College\r\nwhom I have not fitted for it by the Primary course.\r\nThey are taught their first lessons by my students; hence [15]\r\nthe aptness to assimilate pure and abstract Science is\r\nsomewhat untested.\r\n\r\n“As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.” As mortal\r\nmind is directed, it acts for a season. Some students\r\nleave my instructions before they are quite free from [20]\r\nthe bias of their first impressions, whether those be cor-\r\nrect or incorrect. Such students are more or less subject\r\nto the future mental influence of their former teacher.\r\nTheir knowledge of Mind-healing may be right theo-\r\nretically, but the moral and spiritual status of thought [25]\r\nmust be right also. The tone of the teacher’s mind must\r\nbe pure, grand, true, to aid the mental development of\r\nthe student; for the tint of the instructor’s mind must\r\ntake its hue from the divine Mind. A single mistake in\r\nmetaphysics, or in ethics, is more fatal than a mistake in [30]\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nIf a teacher of Christian Science unwittingly or inten-\r\n\r\n[Page 265.]\r\n\r\ntionally offers his own thought, and gives me as authority [1]\r\nfor it; if he diverges from Science and knows it not, or,\r\nknowing it, makes the venture from vanity, in order to\r\nbe thought original, or wiser than somebody else,—this\r\ndivergence widens. He grows dark, and cannot regain, [5]\r\nat will, an upright understanding. This error in the\r\nteacher also predisposes his students to make mistakes\r\nand lose their way. Diverse opinions in Science are\r\nstultifying. All must have _one_ Principle and the same\r\nrule; and all _who follow the Principle and rule_ have but [10]\r\none opinion of it.\r\n\r\nWhosoever understands a single rule in Science, and\r\ndemonstrates its Principle according to rule, is master\r\nof the situation. Nobody can gainsay this. The ego-\r\ntistical theorist or shallow moralist may presume to [15]\r\nmake innovations upon simple proof; but his mistake\r\nis visited upon himself and his students, whose minds\r\nare, must be, disturbed by this discord, which extends\r\nalong the whole line of reciprocal thought. An error\r\nin premise can never bring forth the real fruits of Truth. [20]\r\nAfter thoroughly explaining spiritual Truth and its ethics\r\nto a student, I am not morally responsible for the mis-\r\nstatements or misconduct of this student. My teachings\r\nare uniform. Those who abide by them do well. If\r\nothers, who receive the same instruction, do ill, the fault [25]\r\nis not in the culture but the soil.\r\n\r\nI am constantly called to settle questions and disaf-\r\nfections toward Christian Science growing out of the\r\ndepartures from Science of self-satisfied, unprincipled\r\nstudents. If impatient of the loving rebuke, the stu- [30]\r\ndent must stop at the foot of the grand ascent, and there\r\nremain until suffering compels the downfall of his self-\r\n\r\n[Page 266.]\r\n\r\nconceit. Then that student must struggle up, with bleed- [1]\r\ning footprints, to the God-crowned summit of unselfish\r\nand pure aims and affections.\r\n\r\nTo be two-sided, when these sides are moral oppo-\r\nsites, is neither politic nor scientific; and to abridge a [5]\r\nsingle human right or privilege is an error. Whoever\r\ndoes this may represent me as doing it; but he mistakes\r\nme, and the subjective state of his own mind for mine.\r\n\r\nThe true leader of a true cause is the unacknowledged\r\nservant of mankind. Stationary in the background, this [10]\r\nindividual is doing the work that nobody else can or will\r\ndo. An erratic career is like the comet’s course, dash-\r\ning through space, headlong and alone. A clear-headed\r\nand honest Christian Scientist will demonstrate the Prin-\r\nciple of Christian Science, and hold justice and mercy as [15]\r\ninseparable from the unity of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnchristian Rumor\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assertion that I have said hard things about my\r\nloyal students in Chicago, New York, or any other place,\r\nis utterly false and groundless. I speak of them as I feel, [20]\r\nand I cannot find it in my heart not to love them. They\r\nare essentially dear to me, who are toiling and achieving\r\nsuccess in unison with my own endeavors and prayers.\r\nIf I correct mistakes which may be made in teaching or\r\nlecturing on Christian Science, this is in accordance with [25]\r\nmy students’ desires, and thus we mutually aid each other,\r\nand obey the Golden Rule.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of lies is abroad. Because Truth has spoken\r\naloud, error, running to and fro in the earth, is scream-\r\n\r\n[Page 267.]\r\n\r\ning, to make itself heard above Truth’s voice. The [1]\r\naudible and inaudible wail of evil never harms Scientists,\r\nsteadfast in their consciousness of the nothingness of\r\nwrong and the supremacy of right.\r\n\r\nOur worst enemies are the best friends to our growth. [5]\r\nCharity students, for whom I have sacrificed the most\r\ntime,—those whose chief aim is to injure me,—have\r\ncaused me to exercise most patience. When they report\r\nme as “_hating_ those whom I do not love,” let them re-\r\nmember that there never was a time when I saw an op- [10]\r\nportunity really to help them and failed to improve it;\r\nand this, too, when I knew they were secretly striving\r\nto injure me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVainglory\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparisons are odorous._—SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nThrough all human history, the vital outcomes of [16]\r\nTruth have suffered temporary shame and loss from\r\nindividual conceit, cowardice, or dishonesty. The bird\r\nwhose right wing flutters to soar, while the left beats its\r\nway downward, falls to the earth. Both wings must be [20]\r\nplumed for rarefied atmospheres and upward flight.\r\n\r\nMankind must gravitate from sense to Soul, and human\r\naffairs should be governed by Spirit, intelligent good.\r\nThe antipode of Spirit, which we name _matter_, or _non-_\r\n_intelligent evil_, is no real aid to being. The predisposing [25]\r\nand exciting cause of all defeat and victory under the\r\nsun, rests on this scientific basis: that action, in obedi-\r\nence to God, spiritualizes man’s motives and methods,\r\nand crowns them with success; while disobedience to\r\n\r\n[Page 268.]\r\n\r\nthis divine Principle materializes human modes and con- [1]\r\nsciousness, and defeats them.\r\n\r\nTwo personal queries give point to human action: Who\r\nshall be greatest? and, Who shall be best? Earthly\r\nglory is vain; but not vain enough to attempt pointing [5]\r\nthe way to heaven, the harmony of being. The imaginary\r\nvictories of rivalry and hypocrisy are defeats. The Holy\r\nOne saith, “O that thou hadst hearkened to My com-\r\nmandments! then had thy peace been as a river.” He\r\nis unfit for Truth, and the demonstration of divine power, [10]\r\nwho departs from Mind to matter, and from Truth to\r\nerror, in pursuit of better means for healing the sick and\r\ncasting out error.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientist keeps straight to the course.\r\nHis whole inquiry and demonstration lie in the line of [15]\r\nTruth; hence he suffers no shipwreck in a starless night\r\non the shoals of vainglory. His medicine is Mind—\r\nthe omnipotent and ever-present good. His “help is\r\nfrom the Lord,” who heals body and mind, head and\r\nheart; changing the affections, enlightening the mis- [20]\r\nguided senses, and curing alike the sin and the mortal\r\nsinner. God’s preparations for the sick are potions of\r\nHis own qualities. His therapeutics are antidotes for\r\nthe ailments of mortal mind and body. Then let us not\r\nadulterate His preparations for the sick with material [25]\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nFrom lack of moral strength empires fall. Right alone\r\nis irresistible, permanent, eternal. Remember that hu-\r\nman pride forfeits spiritual power, and either vacillating\r\ngood or self-assertive error dies of its own elements. [30]\r\nThrough patience we must possess the sense of Truth;\r\nand Truth is used to waiting. “Commit thy way unto\r\n\r\n[Page 269.]\r\n\r\nthe Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to [1]\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nBy using falsehood to regain his liberty, Galileo vir-\r\ntually lost it. He cannot escape from barriers who commits\r\nhis moral sense to a dungeon. Hear the Master [5]\r\non this subject: “No man can serve two masters: for\r\neither he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he\r\nwill hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot\r\nserve God and mammon.”\r\n\r\nLives there a man who can better define ethics, better [10]\r\nelucidate the Principle of being, than he who “spake as\r\nnever man spake,” and whose precepts and example have\r\na perpetual freshness in relation to human events?\r\n\r\nWho is it that understands, unmistakably, a fraction\r\nof the actual Science of Mind-healing? [15]\r\n\r\nIt is he who has fairly proven his knowledge on a Chris-\r\ntian, mental, scientific basis; who has made his choice\r\nbetween matter and Mind, and proven the divine Mind\r\nto be the only physician. These are self-evident proposi-\r\ntions: That man can only be Christianized through Mind; [20]\r\nthat without Mind the body is without action; that Science\r\nis a law of divine Mind. The conclusion follows that the\r\ncorrect Mind-healing is the proper means of Christianity,\r\nand is Science.\r\n\r\nChristian Science may be sold in the shambles. Many [25]\r\nare bidding for it,—but are not willing to pay the price.\r\nError is vending itself on trust, well knowing the will-\r\ningness of mortals to buy error at par value. The Reve-\r\nlator beheld the opening of this silent mental seal, and\r\nheard the great Red Dragon _whispering_ that “no man [30]\r\nmight buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name\r\nof the beast, or the number of his name.”\r\n\r\n[Page 270.]\r\n\r\nWe are in the Valley of Decision. Then, let us take [1]\r\nthe side of him who “overthrew the tables of the money-\r\nchangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,”—of\r\nsuch as barter integrity and peace for money and fame.\r\nWhat artist would question the skill of the masters in [5]\r\nsculpture, music, or painting? Shall we depart from the\r\nexample of the Master in Christian Science, Jesus of\r\nNazareth,—than whom mankind hath no higher ideal?\r\nHe who demonstrated his power over sin, disease, and\r\ndeath, is the master Metaphysician. [10]\r\n\r\nTo seek or employ other means than those the Master\r\nused in demonstrating Life scientifically, is to lose the\r\npriceless knowledge of his Principle and practice. He\r\nsaid, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His right-\r\neousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” [15]\r\nGain a pure Christianity; for that is requisite for heal-\r\ning the sick. Then you will need no other aid, and will\r\nhave full faith in his prophecy, “And there shall be one\r\nfold, and one shepherd;” but, the Word must abide in\r\nus, if we would obtain that promise. We cannot depart [20]\r\nfrom his holy example,—we cannot leave Christ for the\r\nschools which crucify him, and yet follow him in heal-\r\ning. Fidelity to his precepts and practice is the only pass-\r\nport to his power; and the pathway of goodness and\r\ngreatness runs through the modes and methods of God. [25]\r\n\r\n“He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompounds\r\n\r\n\r\nHomœopathy is the last link in material medicine.\r\nThe next step is Mind-medicine. Among the foremost\r\n\r\n[Page 271.]\r\n\r\nvirtues of homœopathy is the exclusion of compounds [1]\r\nfrom its pharmacy, and the attenuation of a drug up to\r\nthe point of its disappearance as matter and its manifesta-\r\ntion in effect as a thought, instead of a thing.\r\n\r\nStudents of Christian Science (and many who are not [1]\r\nstudents) understand enough of this to keep out of their\r\nheads the notion that compounded metaphysics (so-called)\r\nis, or can be, Christian Science,—that rests on oneness;\r\none cause and one effect.\r\n\r\nThey should take our magazine, work for it, write for [10]\r\nit, and read it. They should eschew all magazines and\r\nbooks which are less than the best.\r\n\r\n“Choose you this day whom ye will serve.” Cleanse\r\nyour mind of the cobwebs which spurious “compounds”\r\nengender. Before considering a subject that is unworthy [15]\r\nof thought, take in this axiomatic truism: “Trust her\r\nnot, she’s fooling thee;” and Longfellow is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClose Of The Massachusetts Metaphysical College\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch is said at this date, 1889, about Mrs. Eddy’s [20]\r\nMassachusetts Metaphysical College being the only\r\nchartered College of Metaphysics. To make this plain,\r\nthe Publishing Committee of the Christian Scientist\r\nAssociation has published in the _Boston Traveler_ the\r\nfollowing:— [25]\r\n\r\n“To benefit the community, and more strongly mark\r\nthe difference between true and false teachers of mental\r\nhealing, the following history and statistics are officially\r\nsubmitted:—\r\n\r\n[Page 272.]\r\n\r\n“Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy obtained a college charter [1]\r\nin January, 1881, with all the rights and privileges per-\r\ntaining thereunto (_including the right to grant degrees_)\r\nunder Act of 1874, Chapter 375, Section 4.\r\n\r\n“This Act was _repealed_ from and after January 31, [5]\r\n1882. Mrs. Eddy’s grant for a college, for metaphysical\r\npurposes _only_, is the first on record in history, and no\r\ncharters were granted for similar colleges, except hers,\r\nfrom January, 1881, till the repealing of said Act in\r\nJanuary, 1882. [10]\r\n\r\n“The substance of this Act is at present incorporated\r\nin Public Statutes, Chapter 115, Section 2, with the fol-\r\nlowing important restrictions: In accordance with Statutes\r\nof 1883, Chapter 268, any officer, agent, or servant of any\r\ncorporation or association, who confers, or authorizes [15]\r\nto be conferred, any diploma or degree, shall be pun-\r\nished by a fine not less than five hundred dollars and\r\nnot more than one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n“All the mind-healing colleges (except Rev. Mrs.\r\nEddy’s) have simply an incorporated grant, which may [20]\r\nbe called a charter, such as any stock company may ob-\r\ntain for any secular purposes; but these so-called char-\r\nters bestow no rights to _confer degrees_. Hence to name\r\nthese institutions, under such charters, _colleges_, is a fraud-\r\nulent claim. There is but one legally chartered college [25]\r\nof metaphysics, with powers to confer diplomas and de-\r\ngrees, and that is the Massachusetts Metaphysical College,\r\nof which Rev. Mrs. Eddy is founder and president.”\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to act toward all students of Chris-\r\ntian Science with the intuition and impulse of love. If [30]\r\ncertain natures have not profited by my rebukes,—\r\n\r\n[Page 273.]\r\n\r\nsome time, as Christian Scientists, they will know the [1]\r\nvalue of these rebukes. I am thankful that the neo-\r\nphyte will be benefited by experience, although it will\r\ncost him much, and in proportion to its worth.\r\n\r\nI close my College in order to work in other directions, [5]\r\nwhere I now seem to be most needed, and where none\r\nother can do the work. I withdraw from an overwhelm-\r\ning prosperity. My students have never expressed so\r\ngrateful a sense of my labors with them as now, and\r\nnever have been so capable of relieving my tasks as at [10]\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nGod bless my enemies, as well as the better part of\r\nmankind, and gather all my students, in the bonds of\r\nlove and perfectness, into one grand family of Christ’s\r\nfollowers. [15]\r\n\r\nLoyal Christian Scientists should go on in their pres-\r\nent line of labor for a good and holy cause. Their insti-\r\ntutes have not yet accomplished all the good they are\r\ncapable of accomplishing; therefore they should con-\r\ntinue, as at present, to send out students from these [20]\r\nsources of education, to promote the growing interest in\r\nChristian Science Mind-healing.\r\n\r\nThere are one hundred and sixty applications lying on\r\nthe desk before me, for the Primary class in the Massa-\r\nchusetts Metaphysical College, and I cannot do my best [25]\r\nwork for a class which contains that number. When\r\nthese were taught, another and a larger number would\r\nbe in waiting for the same class instruction; and if I\r\nshould teach that Primary class, the other three classes—\r\none Primary and two Normal—would be delayed. [30]\r\nThe work is more than one person can well accomplish,\r\nand the imperative call is for my exclusive teaching.\r\n\r\n[Page 274.]\r\n\r\nFrom the scant history of Jesus and of his disciples, [1]\r\nwe have no Biblical authority for a public institution.\r\nThis point, however, had not impressed me when I opened\r\nmy College. I desire to revise my book “Science and\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures,” and in order to do [5]\r\nthis I must stop teaching at present. The work that\r\nneeds to be done, and which God calls me to outside\r\nof College work, if left undone might hinder the progress\r\nof our Cause more than my teaching would advance it:\r\ntherefore I leave all for Christ. [10]\r\n\r\nDeeply regretting the disappointment this will occa-\r\nsion, and with grateful acknowledgments to the public\r\nfor its liberal patronage, I close my College.\r\n\r\nMARY BAKER G. EDDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalicious Reports\r\n\r\n\r\n_Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter._—ISAIAH lix. 14.\r\n\r\nWhen the press is gagged, liberty is besieged; but\r\nwhen the press assumes the liberty to lie, it discounts\r\nclemency, mocks morality, outrages humanity, breaks\r\ncommon law, gives impulse to violence, envy, and hate, [20]\r\nand prolongs the reign of inordinate, unprincipled clans.\r\nAt this period, 1888, those quill-drivers whose consciences\r\nare in their pockets hold high carnival. When news-\r\ndealers shout for class legislation, and decapitated reputa-\r\ntions, headless trunks, and quivering hearts are held up [25]\r\nbefore the rabble in exchange for money, place, and\r\npower, the _vox populi_ is suffocated, individual rights\r\nare trodden under foot, and the car of the modern In-\r\nquisition rolls along the streets besmeared with blood.\r\n\r\n[Page 275.]\r\n\r\nWould not our Master say to the chief actors in scenes [1]\r\nlike these, “Ye fools and blind!” Oh, tardy human\r\njustice! would you take away even woman’s trembling,\r\nclinging faith in divine power? Who can roll away the\r\nstone from the door of this sepulchre? Who—but God’s [5]\r\navenging angel!\r\n\r\nIn times like these it were well to lift the veil on the\r\nsackcloth of home, where weepeth the faithful, stricken\r\nmother, and the bruised father bendeth his aching head;\r\nwhere the bereft wife or husband, silent and alone, looks [10]\r\nin dull despair at the vacant seat, and the motherless\r\nlittle ones, wondering, huddle together, and repeat with\r\nquivering lips words of strange import. May the great\r\nShepherd that “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,”\r\nand binds up the wounds of bleeding hearts, just comfort, [15]\r\nencourage, and bless all who mourn.\r\n\r\nFather, we thank Thee that Thy light and Thy love\r\nreach earth, open the prison to them that are bound, con-\r\nsole the innocent, and throw wide the gates of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoyal Christian Scientists\r\n\r\n\r\nPen can never portray the satisfaction that you afforded\r\nme at the grand meeting in Chicago of the National Chris-\r\ntian Scientist Association in 1888. Your public and\r\nprivate expressions of love and loyalty were very touch-\r\ning. They moved me to speechless thanks. [25]\r\n\r\nChicago is the wonder of the western hemisphere. The\r\nPalmer House, where we stopped, is magnificent and\r\norderly. The servants are well-mannered, and the fare\r\nis appetizing. The floral offerings sent to my apartments\r\n\r\n[Page 276.]\r\n\r\nwere superb, especially the large book of rare flowers, and [1]\r\nthe crescent with a star.\r\n\r\nThe reception in the spacious rooms of the Palmer\r\nHouse, like all else, was purely Western in its cordiality\r\nand largeness. I did not hold interviews with all with [5]\r\nwhom I desired to, solely because so many people and\r\ncircumstances demanded my attention that my person-\r\nality was not big enough to fill the order; but rest as-\r\nsured my heart’s desire met the demand.\r\n\r\nMy students, our delegates, about one thousand Chris- [10]\r\ntian Scientists, active, earnest, and loyal, formed a goodly\r\nassemblage for the third convention of our National As-\r\nsociation,—an assemblage found waiting and watching\r\nfor the full coming of our Lord and Christ.\r\n\r\nIn Christian Science the midnight hour will always be [15]\r\nthe bridal hour, until “no night is there.” The wise\r\nwill have their lamps aglow, and light will illumine the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nOut of the gloom comes the glory of our Lord, and\r\nHis divine Love is found in affliction. When a false [20]\r\nsense suffers, the true sense comes out, and the bride-\r\ngroom appears. We are then wedded to a purer, higher\r\naffection and ideal.\r\n\r\nI pray that all my students shall have their lamps\r\ntrimmed and burning at the noon of night, that not one [25]\r\nof them be found borrowing oil, and seeking light from\r\nmatter instead of Spirit, or at work erroneously, thus\r\nshutting out spiritual light. Such an error and loss will\r\nbe quickly learned when the door is shut. Error giveth\r\nno light, and it closes the door on itself. [30]\r\n\r\nIn the dark hours, wise Christian Scientists stand\r\nfirmer than ever in their allegiance to God. Wisdom\r\n\r\n[Page 277.]\r\n\r\nis wedded to their love, and their hearts are not [1]\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\nFalsehood is on the wings of the winds, but Truth\r\nwill soar above it. Truth is speaking louder, clearer,\r\nand more imperatively than ever. Error is walking to [5]\r\nand fro in the earth, trying to be heard above Truth,\r\nbut its voice dies out in the distance. Whosoever pro-\r\nclaims Truth loudest, becomes the mark for error’s shafts.\r\nThe archers aim at Truth’s mouthpiece; but a heart\r\nloyal to God is patient and strong. Justice waits, and [10]\r\nis used to waiting; and right wins the everlasting\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe stake and scaffold have never silenced the mes-\r\nsages of the Most High. Then can the present mode of\r\nattempting this—namely, by slanderous falsehoods, and [15]\r\na secret mind-method, through which to effect the pur-\r\nposes of envy and malice—silence Truth? Never. They\r\nbut open the eyes to the truth of Benjamin Franklin’s\r\nreport before the French Commissioners on Mesmerism:\r\n“It is one more fact to be recorded in the history of the [20]\r\nerrors of the human mind.”\r\n\r\n“The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice.”\r\n\r\nNo evidence before the material senses can close my\r\neyes to the scientific proof that God, good, is supreme.\r\nThough clouds are round about Him, the divine justice [25]\r\nand judgment are enthroned. Love is especially near\r\nin times of hate, and never so near as when one can be\r\njust amid lawlessness, and render good for evil.\r\n\r\nI thunder His law to the sinner, and sharply lighten\r\non the cloud of the intoxicated senses. I cannot help [30]\r\nloathing the phenomena of drunkenness produced by\r\nanimality. I rebuke it wherever I see it. The vision\r\n\r\n[Page 278.]\r\n\r\nof the Revelator is before me. The wines of fornica- [1]\r\ntion, envy, and hatred are the distilled spirits of evil,\r\nand are the signs of these times; but I am not dismayed,\r\nand my peace returns unto me.\r\n\r\nError will hate more as it realizes more the presence [5]\r\nof its tormentor. I shall fulfil my mission, fight the good\r\nfight, and keep the faith.\r\n\r\nThere is great joy in this consciousness, that through-\r\nout my labors, and in my history as connected with the\r\nCause of Christian Science, it can be proven that I have [10]\r\nnever given occasion for a single censure, when my mo-\r\ntives and acts are understood and seen as my Father\r\nseeth them. I once wondered at the Scriptural declara-\r\ntion that Job sinned not in all he said, even when he cursed\r\nthe hour of his birth; but I have learned that a curse on [15]\r\nsin is always a blessing to the human race.\r\n\r\nThose only who are tried in the furnace reflect the\r\nimage of their Father. You, my beloved students, who\r\nare absent from me, and have shared less of my labors\r\nthan many others, seem stronger to resist temptation [20]\r\nthan some of those who have had line upon line and\r\nprecept upon precept. This may be a serviceable hint,\r\nsince necessities and God’s providence are foreshadowed.\r\nI have felt for some time that perpetual instruction of\r\nmy students might substitute my own for their growth, [25]\r\nand so dwarf their experience. If they must learn by\r\nthe things they suffer, the sooner this lesson is gained\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nFor two years I have been gradually withdrawing from\r\nactive membership in the Christian Scientist Association. [30]\r\nThis has developed higher energies on the part of true\r\nfollowers, and led to some startling departures on the\r\n\r\n[Page 279.]\r\n\r\nother hand. “Offenses will come: but woe unto him, [1]\r\nthrough whom they come.”\r\n\r\nWhy does not the certainty of individual punishment\r\nfor sin prevent the wrong action? It is the love of God,\r\nand not the fear of evil, that is the incentive in Science. [5]\r\nI rejoice with those who rejoice, and am too apt to weep\r\nwith those who weep, but over and above it all are eter-\r\nnal sunshine and joy unspeakable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe March Primary Class\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRIMARY CLASS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL\r\nCOLLEGE, 571 COLUMBUS AVENUE, THAT ASSEMBLED FEB. 25,\r\n1889, WITH AN ATTENDANCE OF SIXTY-FIVE STUDENTS\r\n\r\nMy students, three picture-stories from the Bible pre-\r\nsent themselves to my thought; three of those pictures\r\nfrom which we learn without study. The first is that of [15]\r\nJoshua and his band before the walls of Jericho. They\r\nwent seven times around these walls, the seven times\r\ncorresponding to the seven days of creation: the six days\r\nare to find out the nothingness of matter; the seventh\r\nis the day of rest, when it is found that evil is naught [20]\r\nand good is all.\r\n\r\nThe second picture is of the disciples met together in\r\nan upper chamber; and they were of one mind. Mark,\r\nthat in the case of Joshua and his band they had all to\r\nshout _together_ in order that the walls might fall; and the [25]\r\ndisciples, too, were of one mind.\r\n\r\nWe, to-day, in this class-room, are enough to con-\r\nvert the world if we are of one Mind; for then the whole\r\nworld will feel the influence of this Mind; as when\r\n\r\n[Page 280.]\r\n\r\nearth was without form, and Mind spake and form [1]\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe third picture-lesson is from Revelation, where, at\r\nthe opening of the seals, one of the angels presented him-\r\nself with balances to weigh the thoughts and actions of [5]\r\nmen; not angels with wings, but messengers of pure and\r\nholy thoughts that say, See thou hurt not the holy things\r\nof Truth.\r\n\r\nYou have come to be weighed; and yet, I would not\r\nweigh you, nor have you weighed. How is this? Be- [10]\r\ncause God does all, and there is nothing in the opposite\r\nscale. There are not two,—Mind _and_ matter. We\r\nmust get rid of that notion. As we commonly think, we\r\nimagine all is well if we cast something into the scale of\r\nMind, but we must realize that Mind is not put into the [15]\r\nscales with matter; then only are we working on one side\r\nand in Science.\r\n\r\nThe students of this Primary class, dismissed the fifth\r\nof March, at close of the lecture on the fourth presented\r\ntheir teacher with an elegant album costing fifty dollars, [20]\r\nand containing beautiful hand-painted flowers on each\r\npage, with their autographs. The presentation was made\r\nin a brief address by Mr. D.A. Easton, who in appro-\r\npriate language and metaphor expressed his fellow-students’\r\nthanks to their teacher. [25]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifth, I met the class to answer\r\nsome questions before their dismissal, and allude briefly\r\nto a topic of great import to the student of Christian\r\nScience,—the rocks and sirens in their course, on and\r\nby which so many wrecks are made. The doors of animal [30]\r\nmagnetism open wide for the entrance of error, some-\r\ntimes just at the moment when you are ready to enter on\r\n\r\n[Page 281.]\r\n\r\nthe fruition of your labors, and with laudable ambition [1]\r\nare about to chant hymns of victory for triumphs.\r\n\r\nThe doors that this animal element flings open are\r\nthose of rivalry, jealousy, envy, revenge. It is the self-\r\nasserting mortal will-power that you must guard against. [5]\r\nBut I find also another mental condition of yours that\r\nfills me with joy. I learned long ago that the world could\r\nneither deprive me of something nor give me anything,\r\nand I have now one ambition and one joy. But if\r\none cherishes ambition unwisely, one will be chastened [10]\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Coligny, in the time of the French Huguenots,\r\nwas converted to Protestantism through a stray copy of\r\nthe Scriptures that fell into his hands. He replied to his\r\nwife, who urged him to come out and confess his faith, [15]\r\n“It is wise to count the cost of becoming a true Chris-\r\ntian.” She answered him, “It is wiser to count the cost\r\nof _not_ becoming a true Christian.” So, whatever we meet\r\nthat is hard in the Christian warfare we must count as\r\nnothing, and must think instead, of our poverty and help- [20]\r\nlessness without this understanding, and count ourselves\r\nalways as debtors to Christ, Truth.\r\n\r\nAmong the gifts of my students, this of yours is one\r\nof the most beautiful and the most costly, because you\r\nhave signed your names. I felt the weight of this yes- [25]\r\nterday, but it came to me more clearly this morning when\r\nI realized what a responsibility you assume when sub-\r\nscribing to Christian Science. But, whatever may come\r\nto you, remember the words of Solomon, “Though hand\r\njoin in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished: but [30]\r\nthe seed of the righteous shall be delivered.”\r\n\r\nYou will need, in future, _practice_ more than theory.\r\n\r\n[Page 282.]\r\n\r\nYou are going out to demonstrate a living faith, a true [1]\r\nsense of the infinite good, a sense that does not limit God,\r\nbut brings to human view an enlarged sense of Deity.\r\nRemember, it is personality, and the sense of personality\r\nin God or in man, that limits man. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObtrusive Mental Healing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question will present itself: Shall people be treated\r\nmentally without their knowledge or consent? The\r\ndirect rule for practice of Christian Science is the Golden\r\nRule, “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye,” [10]\r\nWho of us would have our houses broken open or our\r\nlocks picked? and much less would we have our minds\r\ntampered with.\r\n\r\nOur Master said, “When ye enter a house, salute it.”\r\nProlonging the metaphysical tone of his command, I say, [15]\r\nWhen you enter mentally the personal precincts of human\r\nthought, you should know that the person with whom\r\nyou hold communion desires it. There are solitary ex-\r\nceptions to most given rules: the following is an exception\r\nto the above rule of mental practice. [20]\r\n\r\nIf the friends of a patient desire you to treat him with-\r\nout his knowing it, and they believe in the efficacy of\r\nMind-healing, it is sometimes wise to do so, and the end\r\njustifies the means; for he is restored through Christian\r\nScience when other means have failed. One other oc- [25]\r\ncasion which may call for aid unsought, is a case from\r\naccident, when there is no time for ceremony and no other\r\naid is near.\r\n\r\nThe abuse which I call attention to, is promiscuous\r\n\r\n[Page 283.]\r\n\r\nand unannounced mental practice where there is no neces- [1]\r\nsity for it, or the motive is mercenary, or one can to ad-\r\nvantage speak the truth audibly; then the case is not\r\nexceptional. As a rule, one has no more right to enter\r\nthe mind of a person, stir, upset, and adjust his thoughts [5]\r\nwithout his knowledge or consent, than one has to enter\r\na house, unlock the desk, displace the furniture, and suit\r\none’s self in the arrangement and management of another\r\nman’s property.\r\n\r\nIt would be right to break into a burning building and [10]\r\nrouse the slumbering inmates, but wrong to burst open\r\ndoors and break through windows if no emergency de-\r\nmanded this. Any exception to the old wholesome rule,\r\n“Mind your own business,” is rare. For a student of\r\nmine to treat another student without his knowledge, is [15]\r\na breach of good manners and morals; it is nothing less\r\nthan a mistaken kindness, a culpable ignorance, or a\r\nconscious trespass on the rights of mortals.\r\n\r\nI insist on the etiquette of Christian Science, as well\r\nas its morals and Christianity. The Scriptural rule of [20]\r\nthis Science may momentarily be forgotten; but this is\r\nseldom the case with loyal students, or done without\r\nincriminating the person who did it.\r\n\r\nEach student should, must, work out his own problem\r\nof being; conscious, meanwhile, that God worketh with [25]\r\nhim, and that he needs no personal aid. It is the genius\r\nof Christian Science to demonstrate good, not evil,—\r\nharmony, not discord; for Science is the mandate of\r\nTruth which destroys all error.\r\n\r\nWhoever is honestly laboring to learn the principle of [30]\r\nmusic and practise it, seldom calls on his teacher or mu-\r\nsician to practise for him. The only personal help re-\r\n\r\n[Page 284.]\r\n\r\nquired in this Science is for each one to do his own work [1]\r\nwell, and never try to hinder others from doing theirs\r\nthus.\r\n\r\nChristian Science, more than any other system of\r\nreligion, morals, or medicine, is subject to abuses. Its [5]\r\ninfinite nature and uses occasion this. Even the human-\r\nitarian at work in this field of limitless power and good\r\nmay possess a zeal without knowledge, and thus mistake\r\nthe sphere of his present usefulness.\r\n\r\nStudents who strictly adhere to the right, and make the [10]\r\nBible and Science and Health a study, are in no danger\r\nof mistaking their way.\r\n\r\nThis question is often proposed, How shall I treat\r\nmalicious animal magnetism? The hour has passed for\r\nthis evil to be treated personally, but it should have been [15]\r\nso dealt with at the outset. Christian Scientists should\r\nhave gone personally to the malpractitioner and told\r\nhim his fault, and vindicated divine Truth and Love\r\nagainst human error and hate. This growing sin must\r\nnow be dealt with as evil, and not as an evil-doer or per- [20]\r\nsonality It must also be remembered that neither an evil\r\nclaim nor an evil person is _real_, hence is neither to be\r\n_feared_ nor honored.\r\n\r\nEvil is not something to fear and flee before, or that\r\nbecomes more real when it is grappled with. Evil let [25]\r\nalone grows more real, aggressive, and enlarges its claims;\r\nbut, met with Science, it can and will be mastered by\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nI deprecate personal animosities and quarrels. But if\r\none is intrusted with the rules of church government, to [30]\r\nfulfil that trust those rules must be carried out; thus it\r\nis with all moral obligations. I am opposed to all personal\r\n\r\n[Page 285.]\r\n\r\nattacks, and in favor of combating evil only, rather than [1]\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nAn edition of one thousand pamphlets I ordered to\r\nbe laid away and not one of them circulated, because I\r\nhad been personal in condemnation. Afterwards, by a [5]\r\nblunder of the gentleman who fills orders for my books,\r\nsome of these pamphlets were mistaken for the corrected\r\nedition, and sold.\r\n\r\nLove is the fulfilling of the law. Human life is too\r\nshort for foibles or failures. _The Christian Science Jour-_ [10]\r\n_nal_ will hold high the banner of Truth and Love, and be\r\nimpartial and impersonal in its tenor and tenets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWedlock\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about the year 1875 that Science and Health\r\nfirst crossed swords with free-love, and the latter fell _hors_ [15]\r\n_de combat_; but the whole warfare of sensuality was not\r\nthen ended. Science and Health, the book that cast the\r\nfirst stone, is still at work, deep down in human conscious-\r\nness, laying the axe at the root of error.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the precaution to write briefly on mar- [20]\r\nriage, showing its relation to Christian Science. In the\r\npresent or future, some extra throe of error may conjure\r\nup a new-style conjugality, which, _ad libitum_, severs the\r\nmarriage covenant, puts virtue in the shambles, and\r\ncoolly notifies the public of broken vows. Springing [25]\r\nup from the ashes of free-love, this nondescript phoenix,\r\nin the face and eyes of common law, common sense, and\r\ncommon honesty, may appear in the _rôle_ of a superfine\r\nconjugality; but, having no Truth, it will have no past,\r\npresent, or future. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 286.]\r\n\r\nThe above prophecy, written years ago, has already [1]\r\nbeen fulfilled. It is seen in Christian Science that the\r\ngospel of marriage is not without the law, and the solemn\r\nvow of fidelity, “until death do us part;” this verity in\r\nhuman economy can neither be obscured nor throttled. [5]\r\nUntil time matures human growth, marriage and progeny\r\nwill continue unprohibited in Christian Science. We look\r\nto future generations for ability to comply with absolute\r\nScience, when marriage shall be found to be man’s one-\r\nness with God,—the unity of eternal Love. At present, [10]\r\nmore spiritual conception and education of children will\r\nserve to illustrate the superiority of spiritual power over\r\nsensuous, and usher in the dawn of God’s creation,\r\nwherein they neither marry nor are given in marriage,\r\nbut are as the angels. To abolish marriage at this period, [15]\r\nand maintain morality and generation, would put inge-\r\nnuity to ludicrous shifts; yet this is possible in _Science_,\r\nalthough it is to-day problematic.\r\n\r\nThe time cometh, and now is, for spiritual and eternal\r\nexistence to be recognized and understood in Science. [20]\r\nAll is Mind. Human procreation, birth, life, and death\r\nare subjective states of the human erring mind; they\r\nare the phenomena of mortality, nothingness, that illus-\r\ntrate mortal mind and body as _one_, and neither real nor\r\neternal. [25]\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that Spirit, God, is the only\r\ncreator: we should recognize this verity of being, and\r\nshut out all sense of other claims. Until this absolute\r\nScience of being is seen, understood, and demonstrated\r\nin the offspring of divine Mind, and man is perfect even [30]\r\nas the Father is perfect, human speculation will go on,\r\nand stop at length at the spiritual ultimate: creation\r\n\r\n[Page 287.]\r\n\r\nunderstood as the most exalted divine conception. The [1]\r\noffspring of an improved generation, however, will go out\r\nbefore the forever fact that man is eternal and has no\r\nhuman origin. Hence the Scripture: “It is He that hath\r\nmade us, and not we ourselves;” and the Master’s de- [5]\r\nmand, “Call no man your father upon the earth: for one\r\nis your Father, which is in heaven.”\r\n\r\nTo an ill-attuned ear, discord is harmony; so personal\r\nsense, discerning not the legitimate affection of Soul,\r\nmay place love on a false basis and thereby lose it. Science [10]\r\ncorrects this error with the truth of Love, and restores\r\nlost Eden. Soul is the infinite source of bliss: only high\r\nand holy joy can satisfy immortal cravings. The good\r\nin human affections should preponderate over the evil,\r\nand the spiritual over the animal,—until progress lifts [15]\r\nmortals to discern the Science of mental formation and\r\nfind the highway of holiness.\r\n\r\nIn the order of wisdom, the higher nature of man\r\ngoverns the lower. This lays the foundations of human\r\naffection in line with progress, giving them strength and [20]\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by a wife or a husband important ques-\r\ntions concerning their happiness, the substance of my reply\r\nis: God will guide you. Be faithful over home rela-\r\ntions; they lead to higher joys: obey the Golden Rule [25]\r\nfor human life, and it will spare you much bitterness.\r\nIt is pleasanter to do right than wrong; it makes one\r\nruler over one’s self and hallows home,—which is woman’s\r\nworld. Please your husband, and he will be apt to please\r\nyou; preserve affection on both sides. [30]\r\n\r\nGreat mischief comes from attempts to steady other\r\npeople’s altars, venturing on valor without discretion,\r\n\r\n[Page 288.]\r\n\r\nwhich is virtually meddlesomeness. Even your sincere [1]\r\nand courageous convictions regarding what is best for\r\nothers may be mistaken; you must be demonstratively\r\nright yourself, and work out the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number, before you are sure of being a fit coun- [5]\r\nsellor. Positive and imperative thoughts should be dropped\r\ninto the balances of God and weighed by spiritual Love,\r\nand not be found wanting, before being put into action.\r\nA rash conclusion that regards only one side of a ques-\r\ntion, is weak and wicked; this error works out the results [10]\r\nof error. If the premise of mortal existence is wrong,\r\nany conclusion drawn therefrom is not absolutely right.\r\nWisdom in human action begins with what is nearest\r\nright under the circumstances, and thence achieves the\r\nabsolute. [15]\r\n\r\nIs marriage nearer right than celibacy?\r\n\r\nHuman knowledge inculcates that it is, while Science\r\nindicates that it _is not_. But to force the consciousness\r\nof scientific being before it is understood is impossible,\r\nand believing otherwise would prevent scientific demon- [20]\r\nstration. To reckon the universal cost and gain, as well\r\nas thine own, is right in every state and stage of being.\r\nThe selfish _rôle_ of a martyr is the shift of a dishonest\r\nmind, nothing short of self-seeking; and real suffering\r\nwould stop the farce. [25]\r\n\r\nThe cause of temperance receives a strong impulse\r\nfrom the cause of Christian Science: temperance and\r\ntruth are allies, and their cause prospers in proportion\r\nto the spirit of Love that nerves the struggle. People\r\nwill differ in their opinions as to means to promote the [30]\r\nends of temperance; that is, abstinence from intoxicat-\r\ning beverages. Whatever intoxicates a man, stultifies,\r\n\r\n[Page 289.]\r\n\r\nand causes him to degenerate physically and morally. [1]\r\nStrong drink is unquestionably an evil, and evil cannot\r\nbe used temperately: its slightest use is abuse; hence\r\nthe only temperance is total abstinence. Drunkenness\r\nis sensuality let loose, in whatever form it is made [5]\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nWhat is evil? It is suppositional absence of good.\r\nFrom a human standpoint of good, mortals must first\r\nchoose between evils, and of two evils choose the less;\r\nand at present the application of scientific rules to hu- [10]\r\nman life seems to rest on this basis.\r\n\r\nAll partnerships are formed on agreements to certain\r\ncompacts: each party voluntarily surrenders independ-\r\nent action to act as a whole and per agreement. This\r\nfact should be duly considered when by the marriage [15]\r\ncontract two are made one, and, according to the divine\r\nprecept, “they twain shall be one flesh.” Oneness in\r\nspirit is Science, compatible with home and heaven.\r\nNeither divine justice nor human equity has _divorced_\r\ntwo minds in one. [20]\r\n\r\nRights that are bargained away must not be retaken\r\nby the contractors, except by mutual consent. Human\r\nnature has bestowed on a wife the right to become a\r\nmother; but if the wife esteems not this privilege, by\r\nmutual consent, exalted and increased affections, she [25]\r\nmay win a higher. Science touches the conjugal ques-\r\ntion on the basis of a bill of rights. Can the bill of con-\r\njugal rights be fairly stated by a magistrate, or by a\r\nminister? Mutual interests and affections are the spirit\r\nof these rights, and they should be consulted, augmented, [30]\r\nand allowed to rise to the spiritual altitude whence they\r\ncan choose only good.\r\n\r\n[Page 290.]\r\n\r\nA third person is not a party to the compact of two [1]\r\nhearts. Let other people’s marriage relations _alone_: two\r\npersons only, should be found within their precincts.\r\nThe nuptial vow is never annulled so long as the animus\r\nof the contract is preserved intact. Science lifts humanity [5]\r\nhigher in the scale of harmony, and must ultimately break\r\nall bonds that hinder progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Not\r\n\r\n\r\nMistaken views ought to be dissolving views, since\r\nwhatever is false should disappear. To suppose that hu- [10]\r\nman love, guided by the divine Principle, which is Love,\r\nis partial, unmerciful, or unjust, indicates misapprehen-\r\nsion of the divine Principle and its workings in the human\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nA person wrote to me, naming the time of the occur- [15]\r\nrence, “I felt the influence of your thought on my mind,\r\nand it produced a wonderful illumination, peace, and\r\nunderstanding;” but, I had not thought of the writer\r\nat that time. I knew that this person was doing well,\r\nand my affections involuntarily flow out towards all. [20]\r\n\r\nWhen will the world cease to judge of causes from a\r\npersonal sense of things, conjectural and misapprehen-\r\nsive! When thought dwells in God,—and it should not,\r\nto our consciousness, dwell elsewhere,—one must bene-\r\nfit those who hold a place in one’s memory, whether it [25]\r\nbe friend or foe, and each share the benefit of that radia-\r\ntion. This individual blessedness and blessing comes\r\nnot so much from individual as from universal love: it\r\nemits light because it reflects; and all who are receptive\r\nshare this equally. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 291.]\r\n\r\nMistaken or transient views are human: they are not [1]\r\ngoverned by the Principle of divine Science: but the\r\nnotion that a mind governed by Principle can be forced\r\ninto personal channels, affinities, self-interests, or obliga-\r\ntions, is a grave mistake; it dims the true sense of God’s [5]\r\nreflection, and darkens the understanding that demon-\r\nstrates above personal motives, unworthy aims and\r\nambitions.\r\n\r\nToo much and too little is attached to me as authority\r\nfor other people’s thoughts and actions. A tacit acqui- [10]\r\nescence with others’ views is often construed as direct\r\norders,—or at least it so appears in results. I desire\r\nthe equal growth and prosperity of all Christian Scien-\r\ntists, and the world in general; each and every one has\r\nequal opportunity to be benefited by my thoughts and [15]\r\nwritings. If any are not partakers thereof, this is not\r\nmy fault, and is far from my desire; the possible per-\r\nversion of Christian Science is the irony of fate, if the\r\nspirit thereof be lacking. I would part with a blessing\r\nmyself to bestow it upon others, but could not deprive [20]\r\nthem of it. False views, however engendered, relative\r\nto the true and unswerving course of a Christian Scientist,\r\nwill at length dissolve into thin air. The dew of heaven\r\nwill fall gently on the hearts and lives of all who are found\r\nworthy to suffer for righteousness,—and have taught [25]\r\nthe truth which is energizing, refreshing, and consecrat-\r\ning mankind.\r\n\r\nTo station justice and gratitude as sentinels along the\r\nlines of thought, would aid the solution of this problem,\r\nand counteract the influence of envious minds or the mis- [30]\r\nguided individual who keeps not watch over his emotions\r\nand conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Page 292.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Commandment\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divinity of St. John’s Gospel brings to view over- [1]\r\nwhelming tides of revelation, and its spirit is baptismal;\r\nhe chronicles this teaching, “A new commandment I\r\ngive unto you, That ye love one another.” [5]\r\n\r\nJesus, who so loved the world that he gave his life\r\n(in the flesh) for it, saw that Love had a new command-\r\nment even for him. What was it?\r\n\r\nIt must have been a rare revelation of infinite Love, a\r\nnew tone on the scale ascending, such as eternity is ever [10]\r\nsounding. Could I impart to the student the higher\r\nsense I entertain of Love, it would partly illustrate the\r\ndivine energy that brings to human weakness might and\r\nmajesty. Divine Love eventually causes mortals to turn\r\naway from the open sepulchres of sin, and look no more [15]\r\ninto them as realities. It calls loudly on them to bury\r\nthe dead out of sight; to forgive and forget whatever is\r\nunlike the risen, immortal Love; and to shut out all op-\r\nposite sense. Christ enjoins it upon man to help those\r\nwho know not what he is doing in their behalf, and there- [20]\r\nfore curse him; enjoins taking them by the hand and\r\nleading them, if _possible_, to Christ, by loving words and\r\ndeeds. Charity thus serves as admonition and instruc-\r\ntion, and works out the purposes of Love.\r\n\r\nChristian Science, full of grace and truth, is accom- [25]\r\nplishing great good, both seen and unseen; but have\r\nmortals, with the penetration of Soul, searched the secret\r\nchambers of sense? I never knew a student who fully\r\nunderstood my instructions on this point of handling\r\nevil,—as to just how this should be done,—and carried [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 293.]\r\n\r\nout my ideal. It is safe not to teach prematurely the [1]\r\ninfant thought in Christian Science—just breathing new\r\nLife and Love—all the claims and modes of evil; there-\r\nfore it is best to leave the righteous unfolding of error\r\n(as a general rule) alone, and to the special care of the [5]\r\nunerring modes of divine wisdom. This uncovering and\r\npunishing of sin must, will come, at some date, to the\r\nrescue of humanity. The teacher of divine metaphysics\r\nshould impart to his students the general knowledge that\r\nhe has gained from instruction, observation, and mental [10]\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nExperience weighs in the scales of God the sense and\r\npower of Truth against the opposite claims of error.\r\nIf spiritual sense is not dominant in a student, he will\r\nnot understand all your instructions; and if evil domi- [15]\r\nnates his character, he will pervert the rules of Christian\r\nScience, and the last error will be worse than the first—\r\ninasmuch as wilful transgression brings greater torment\r\nthan ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cruce Salus\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sum total of Love reflected is exemplified, and [21]\r\nincludes the whole duty of man: Truth perverted, in\r\nbelief, becomes the creator of the claim of error. To\r\naffirm mentally and audibly that God is All and there is\r\nno sickness and no sin, makes mortals either saints or [25]\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\nTruth talked and not lived, rolls on the human heart\r\na stone; consigns sensibility to the charnel-house of sen-\r\nsuality, ease, self-love, self-justification, there to moulder\r\nand rot. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 294.]\r\n\r\nThe noblest work of God is man in the image of his [1]\r\nMaker; the last infirmity of evil is so-called man, swayed\r\nby the maëlstrom of human passions, elbowing the con-\r\ncepts of his own creating, making place for himself and\r\ndisplacing his fellows. [5]\r\n\r\nA real Christian Scientist is a marvel, a miracle in the\r\nuniverse of mortal mind. With selfless love, he inscribes\r\non the heart of humanity and transcribes on the page\r\nof reality the living, palpable presence—the might and\r\nmajesty!—of goodness. He lives for all mankind, and [10]\r\nhonors his creator.\r\n\r\nThe _vice versa_ of this man is sometimes called a\r\nman, but he is a small animal: a hived bee, with sting\r\nready for each kind touch, he makes honey out of\r\nthe flowers of human hearts and hides it in his cell of [15]\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nO friendly hand! keep back thy offerings from asps\r\nand apes, from wolves in sheep’s clothing and all raven-\r\ning beasts. Love such specimens of mortality just enough\r\nto reform and transform them,—if it be possible,— [20]\r\nand then, look out for their stings, and jaws, and claws;\r\nbut thank God and take courage,—that you desire to\r\nhelp even such as these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison to English Barmaids\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my residence in Concord, N. H., I have read [25]\r\nthe daily paper, and had become an admirer of Edgar\r\nL. Wakeman’s terse, graphic, and poetic style in his\r\n“Wanderings,” richly flavored with the true ideas of\r\nhumanity and equality. In an issue of January 17, how-\r\n\r\n[Page 295.]\r\n\r\never, were certain references to American women which [1]\r\ndeserve and elicit brief comment.\r\n\r\nMr. Wakeman writes from London, that a noted Eng-\r\nlish leader, whom he quotes without naming, avers that\r\nthe “cursed barmaid system” in England is evolved by [5]\r\nthe same power which in America leads women “along\r\na gamut of isms and ists, from female suffrage, past a\r\nscore of reforms, to Christian Science.” This anony-\r\nmous talker further declares, that the central cause of\r\nthis “same original evil” is “a female passion for some [10]\r\nmanner of notoriety.”\r\n\r\nIs Mr. Wakeman _awake_, and caught napping? While\r\npraising the Scotchman’s national pride and affection,\r\nhas our American correspondent lost these sentiments\r\nfrom his own breast? Has he forgotten how to honor [15]\r\nhis native land and defend the dignity of her daughters\r\nwith his ready pen and pathos?\r\n\r\nThe flaunting and floundering statements of the great\r\nunknown for whose ability and popularity Mr. Wakeman\r\nstrongly vouches, should not only be queried, but flatly [20]\r\ncontradicted, as both untrue and uncivil. English senti-\r\nment is not wholly represented by one man. Nor is the\r\nworld ignorant of the fact that high and pure ethical\r\ntones do resound from Albion’s shores. The most ad-\r\nvanced ideas are inscribed on tablets of such an organi- [25]\r\nzation as the Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society\r\nof Great Britain, an institution which names itself after\r\nher who is unquestionably the best queen on earth; who\r\nfor a half century has with such dignity, clemency, and\r\nvirtue worn the English crown and borne the English [30]\r\nsceptre.\r\n\r\nNow, I am a Christian Scientist,—the Founder of\r\n\r\n[Page 296.]\r\n\r\nthis system of religion,—widely known; and, by special [1]\r\ninvitation, have allowed myself to be elected an associate\r\nlife-member of the Victoria Institute, which numbers\r\namong its constituents and managers—not barmaids,\r\nbut bishops—profound philosophers, brilliant scholars. [5]\r\n\r\nWas it ignorance of American society and history,\r\ntogether with unfamiliarity with the work and career\r\nof American women, which led the unknown author\r\ncited by Mr. Wakeman to overflow in shallow sarcasm,\r\nand place the barmaids of English alehouses and rail- [10]\r\nways in the same category with noble women who min-\r\nister in the sick-room, give their time and strength to\r\nbinding up the wounds of the broken-hearted, and live\r\non the plan of heaven?\r\n\r\nThis writer classes Christian Science with theosophy [15]\r\nand spiritualism; whereas, they are by no means iden-\r\ntical—nor even similar. Christian Science, antagonis-\r\ntic to intemperance, as to all immorality, is by no means\r\nassociated therewith. Do manly Britons patronize tap-\r\nrooms and lazar-houses, and thus note or foster a fem- [20]\r\ninine ambition which, in this unknown gentleman’s\r\nlanguage, “poises and poses, higgles and wriggles” it-\r\nself into publicity? Why fall into such patronage, unless\r\nfrom their affinity for the worst forms of vice?\r\n\r\nAnd the barmaids! Do they enter this line of occu- [25]\r\npation from a desire for notoriety and a wish to promote\r\nfemale suffrage? or are they incited thereto by their\r\nown poverty and the bad appetites of men? What man-\r\nner of man _is_ this unknown individual who utters bar-\r\nmaid and Christian Scientist in the same breath? If he [30]\r\nbut knew whereof he speaks, _his_ shame would not lose\r\nits blush!\r\n\r\n[Page 297.]\r\n\r\nTaking into account the short time that has elapsed [1]\r\nsince the discovery of Christian Science, one readily sees\r\nthat this Science has distanced all other religious and\r\npathological systems for physical and moral reforma-\r\ntion. In the direction of temperance it has achieved far [5]\r\nmore than has been accomplished by legally coercive\r\nmeasures,—and because this Science bases its work on\r\nethical conditions and mentally destroys the appetite for\r\nalcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nSmart journalism is allowable, nay, it is commend- [10]\r\nable; but the public cannot swallow reports of American\r\naffairs from a surly censor ventilating his lofty scorn of\r\nthe sects, or societies, of a nation that perhaps he has\r\nnever visited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Christian Science Statute\r\n\r\n\r\nI hereby state, in unmistakable language, the follow- [16]\r\ning statute in the _morale_ of Christian Science:—\r\n\r\nA man or woman, having voluntarily entered into\r\nwedlock, and accepted the claims of the marriage cove-\r\nnant, is held in Christian Science as morally bound to [20]\r\nfulfil all the claims growing out of this contract, unless\r\nsuch claims are relinquished by mutual consent of both\r\nparties, or this contract is legally dissolved. If the man\r\nis dominant over the animal, he will count the conse-\r\nquences of his own conduct; will consider the effects, [25]\r\non himself and his progeny, of selfishness, unmerciful-\r\nness, tyranny, or lust.\r\n\r\nTrust Truth, not error; and Truth will give you all\r\nthat belongs to the rights of freedom. The Hebrew bard\r\n\r\n[Page 298.]\r\n\r\nwrote, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean [1]\r\nnot unto thine own understanding.” Nothing is gained\r\nby wrong-doing. St. Paul’s words take in the situation:\r\n“Not ... (as we be slanderously reported, and as some\r\naffirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? [5]\r\nwhose damnation is just.”\r\n\r\nWhen causing others to go astray, we also are wan-\r\nderers. “With what measure ye mete, it shall be meas-\r\nured to you again.” Ask yourself: Under the same\r\ncircumstances, in the same spiritual ignorance and power [10]\r\nof passion, would I be strengthened by having my best\r\nfriend break troth with me? These words of St. Matthew\r\nhave special application to Christian Scientists; namely,\r\n“It is not good to marry.”\r\n\r\nTo build on selfishness is to build on sand. When [15]\r\nJesus received the material rite of water baptism, he did\r\nnot say that it was God’s command; but implied that\r\nthe period demanded it. Trials purify mortals and deliver\r\nthem from themselves,—all the claims of sensuality.\r\nAbide by the _morale_ of absolute Christian Science,— [20]\r\nself-abnegation and purity; then Truth delivers you from\r\nthe seeming power of error, and faith vested in righteous-\r\nness triumphs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvice To Students\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true consciousness is the true health. One says, [25]\r\n“I find relief from pain in unconscious sleep.” I say,\r\nYou mistake; through unconsciousness one no more\r\ngains freedom from pain than immunity from evil. When\r\nunconscious of a mistake, one thinks he is not mistaken;\r\nbut this false consciousness does not change the fact, or [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 299.]\r\n\r\nits results; suffering and mistakes recur until one is awake [1]\r\nto their cause and character. To know the what, when,\r\nand how of error, destroys error. The error that is seen\r\naright as error, has received its death-blow; but never\r\nuntil then. [5]\r\n\r\nLet us look through the lens of Christian Science,\r\nnot of “self,” at the following mistake, which demands\r\nour present attention. I have no time for detailed report\r\nof this matter, but simply answer the following question\r\nsent to me; glad, indeed, that this query has finally come [10]\r\nwith the courage of conviction to the minds of many\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n“Is it right to copy your works and read them for our\r\npublic services?”\r\n\r\nThe good which the material senses see not is the only [15]\r\nabsolute good; the evil which these senses see not is the\r\nonly absolute evil.\r\n\r\nIf I enter Mr. Smith’s store and take from it his gar-\r\nments that are on sale, array myself in them, and put\r\nmyself and them on exhibition, can I make this right [20]\r\nby saying, These garments are Mr. Smith’s; he manu-\r\nfactured them and owns them, but you must pay me,\r\nnot him, for this exhibit?\r\n\r\nThe spectators may ask, Did he give you permission\r\nto do this, did he sell them or loan them to you? No. [25]\r\nThen have you asked yourself this question on the sub-\r\nject, namely, What right have I to do this? True, it\r\nsaves your purchasing these garments, and gives to the\r\npublic new patterns which are useful to them; but does\r\nthis silence your conscience? or, because you have con- [30]\r\nfessed that they are the property of a noted firm, and\r\nyou wished to handle them, does it justify you in appro-\r\n\r\n[Page 300.]\r\n\r\npriating them, and so avoiding the cost of hiring or [1]\r\npurchasing?\r\n\r\nCopying my published works _verbatim_, compiling them\r\nin connection with the Scriptures, taking this copy into\r\nthe pulpit, announcing the author’s name, then reading [5]\r\nit publicly as your own compilation, is—what?\r\n\r\nWe answer, It is a mistake; in common parlance, it\r\nis an _ignorant_ wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you should print and publish your copy of my works,\r\nyou would be liable to arrest for infringement of copy- [10]\r\nright, which the law defines and punishes as theft. Read-\r\ning in the pulpit from copies of my publications gives\r\nyou the clergyman’s salary and spares you the printer’s\r\nbill, but does it spare you our Master’s condemnation?\r\nYou literally publish my works through the pulpit, instead [15]\r\nof the press, and thus evade the law, _but not the gospel_.\r\nWhen I consent to this act, you will then be justified\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nYour manuscript copy is liable, in some way, to be\r\nprinted as your original writings, thus incurring the pen- [20]\r\nalty of the law, and increasing the record of theft in the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court.\r\n\r\nTo The Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, which I\r\nhad organized and of which I had for many years been\r\npastor, I gave permission to cite, in the _Christian Science_ [25]\r\n_Quarterly_, from my work Science and Health, passages\r\ngiving the spiritual meaning of Bible texts; but this was\r\na special privilege, and the author’s gift.\r\n\r\nChristian Science demonstrates that the patient who\r\npays whatever he is able to pay for being healed, is more [30]\r\napt to recover than he who withholds a slight equiva-\r\nlent for health. Healing morally and physically are one.\r\n\r\n[Page 301.]\r\n\r\nThen, is compiling and delivering that sermon for which [1]\r\nyou pay nothing, and which you deliver without the\r\nauthor’s consent, and receive pay therefor, the _precedent_\r\nfor preaching Christian Science,—and are you doing\r\nto the author of the above-named book as you would [5]\r\nhave others do unto you?\r\n\r\nThose authors and editors of pamphlets and periodi-\r\ncals whose substance is made up of my publications, are\r\nmorally responsible for what the law construes as crime.\r\nThere are startling instances of the above-named law- [10]\r\nbreaking and gospel-opposing system of authorship, which\r\ncharacterize the writings of a few professed Christian\r\nScientists. My Christian students who have read copies\r\nof my works in the pulpit require only a word to be wise;\r\ntoo sincere and morally statuesque are they to be long [15]\r\nled into temptation; but I must not leave persistent\r\nplagiarists without this word of warning in public, since\r\nmy private counsel they disregard.\r\n\r\nTo the question of my true-hearted students, “Is it\r\nright to copy your works and read them for our public [20]\r\nservices?” I answer: It is not right to copy my book\r\nand read it publicly _without my consent_. My reasons are\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n_First:_ This method is an unseen form of injustice\r\nstanding in a holy place. [25]\r\n\r\n_Second:_ It breaks the Golden Rule,—a divine rule\r\nfor human conduct.\r\n\r\n_Third:_ All error tends to harden the heart, blind\r\nthe eyes, stop the ears of understanding, and inflate\r\nself; counter to the commands of our hillside Priest, to [30]\r\nwhom Isaiah alluded thus: “I have trodden the wine-\r\npress alone; and of the people there was none with me.”\r\n\r\n[Page 302.]\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes lurks an evil which you can prevent: [1]\r\nit is a purpose to kill the reformation begun and increas-\r\ning through the instructions of “Science and Health with\r\nKey to the Scriptures;” it encourages infringement of my\r\ncopyright, and seeks again to “cast lots for his vesture,”—while [5]\r\nthe perverter preserves in his own consciousness\r\nand teaching the name without the Spirit, the skeleton\r\nwithout the heart, the form without the comeliness, the\r\nsense without the Science, of Christ’s healing. My stu-\r\ndents are expected to know the teaching of Christian Sci- [10]\r\nence sufficiently to discriminate between error and Truth,\r\nthus sparing their teacher a task and themselves the\r\ntemptation to be misled.\r\n\r\nMuch good has been accomplished through Christian\r\nScience Sunday services. If Christian Scientists occasion- [15]\r\nally mistake in interpreting revealed Truth, of two evils\r\nthe less would be _not_ to leave the Word unspoken and\r\nuntaught. I allowed, till this permission was _withdrawn_,\r\nstudents working faithfully for Christ’s cause on earth,\r\nthe privilege of copying and reading my works for Sunday [20]\r\nservice; _provided_, they each and all destroyed the copies\r\nat once after said service. When I should so elect and\r\ngive suitable notice, they were to desist from further copy-\r\ning of my writings as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThis injunction did not curtail the benefit which the [25]\r\nstudent derived from making his copy, nor detract from\r\nthe good that his hearers received from his reading thereof;\r\nbut it was intended to forestall the possible evil of putting\r\nthe divine teachings contained in “Science and Health\r\nwith Key to the Scriptures” into human hands, to sub- [30]\r\nvert or to liquidate.\r\n\r\nI recommend that students stay within their own fields\r\n\r\n[Page 303.]\r\n\r\nof labor, to work for the race; they are lights that can- [1]\r\nnot be hid, and need only to shine from their home sum-\r\nmits to be sought and found as healers physical and\r\nmoral.\r\n\r\nThe kindly shepherd has his own fold and tends his [5]\r\nown flock. Christian students should have their own\r\ninstitutes and, _unmolested_, be governed by divine Love\r\nalone in teaching and guiding their students. When\r\nwisdom garrisons these strongholds of Christian Science,\r\npeace and joy, the fruits of Spirit, will rest upon us all. [10]\r\nWe are brethren in the fullest sense of that word; there-\r\nfore no queries should arise as to “who shall be great-\r\nest.” Let us serve instead of rule, knock instead of\r\npush at the door of human hearts, and allow to each\r\nand every one the same rights and privileges that we [15]\r\nclaim for ourselves. If ever I wear out from serving\r\nstudents, it shall be in the effort to help them to obey\r\nthe Ten Commandments and imbibe the spirit of Christ’s\r\nBeatitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editor of Christian Science Journal_:—You will oblige\r\nme by giving place in your _Journal_ to the following notice.\r\nThe idea and purpose of a Liberty Bell is pleasing, and\r\ncan be made profitable to the heart of our country. I feel\r\nassured that many Christian Scientists will respond to this [25]\r\nletter by contributions.\r\n\r\nMARY BAKER EDDY\r\n\r\n[Page 304.]\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIAN LIBERTY BELL COMMITTEE, [1]\r\n  1505 Penna. Ave., Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nTO THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION:—\r\n\r\nIt has been determined to create a Columbian Liberty\r\nBell, to be placed by the lovers of liberty and peace in [5]\r\nthe most appropriate place in the coming World’s Expo-\r\nsition at Chicago. After the close of the Exhibition this\r\nbell will pass from place to place throughout the world\r\nas a missionary of freedom, coming first to the capital\r\nof the nation under the care of our society. [10]\r\n\r\nThen it will go to Bunker Hill or Liberty Island, to\r\nthe battle-field of New Orleans (1812), to San Francisco,\r\nto the place where any great patriotic celebration is being\r\nheld, until 1900, when it will be sent to the next World’s\r\nExhibition, which takes place at Paris, France. There it [15]\r\nwill continue until that Exhibition closes.\r\n\r\nWhen not in use in other places, it will return to Wash-\r\nington under the care of the Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution. Washington will be its home, and from there\r\nit will journey from place to place, fulfilling its mission [20]\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe following is the proposed use of the bell: It shall\r\nring at sunrise and sunset; at nine o’clock in the morn-\r\ning on the anniversaries of the days on which great events\r\nhave occurred marking the world’s progress toward liberty; [25]\r\nat twelve o’clock on the birthdays of the “creators of\r\nliberty;” and at four o’clock it will toll on the anniver-\r\nsaries of their death. (It will always ring at nine o’clock\r\non October 11th, in recognition of the organization on\r\nthat day of the Daughters of the American Revolution.) [30]\r\n... The responsibility of its production, and the direc-\r\ntion of its use, have been placed in the hands of a\r\n\r\n[Page 305.]\r\n\r\ncommittee of women representing each State and Ter- [1]\r\nritory, one representative from each Republic in the\r\nworld, and a representative from the patriotic societies,\r\n—Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution,\r\nthe Lyceum League of America, the Society of Ger- [5]\r\nman Patriots, the Human Freedom League, and kindred\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe National Board of Management has placed upon\r\nme the responsibility of representing the National Society\r\nof the Daughters of the American Revolution upon the [10]\r\nGeneral Committee, and this circular is sent to every\r\nmember of the society, asking for her personal coopera-\r\ntion in making the undertaking successful. In creating\r\nthe bell it is particularly desired that the largest number\r\nof persons possible shall have a part in it. For this reason [15]\r\nsmall contributions from many persons are to be asked\r\nfor, rather than large contributions from a few. They\r\nare to be of two kinds:—\r\n\r\n_First:_ Material that can be made a part of the bell;\r\narticles of historic interest will be particularly appre- [20]\r\nciated—gold, silver, bronze, copper, and nickel can be\r\nfused.\r\n\r\n_Second:_ Of money with which to pay for the bell.\r\nEach member of the society is asked to contribute one\r\ncent to be fused into the bell, and twenty-five cents to [25]\r\npay for it. She is also asked to collect two dollars from\r\nothers, in pennies, if possible, and send with the amount\r\nthe name of each contributor. In order that the bell\r\nshall be cast April 30th, the anniversary of the inaugu-\r\nration of George Washington as the first President of [30]\r\nthe United States, we ask every one receiving this cir-\r\ncular _to act at once_.\r\n\r\n[Page 306.]\r\n\r\nIn forwarding material to be melted into the bell, please [1]\r\nsend fullest historical description. This will be entered\r\ncarefully in a book which will accompany the bell wherever\r\nit goes.\r\n\r\n... As the motto has not yet been decided upon, any [5]\r\nideas on that subject will be gratefully received; we will\r\nalso welcome suggestions of events to be celebrated and\r\nnames to be commemorated.\r\n\r\n  Very cordially yours,\r\n    MARY DESHA,\r\n_ex-Vice-President General, D. A. R._\r\n\r\nContributions should be sent to the Liberty National\r\nBank, corner Liberty and West Streets, New York, and\r\na duplicate letter written, as a notification of the same,\r\nto Miss Mary Desha, 1505 Penna. Ave., Washington, [15]\r\nD. C., or to Miss Minnie F. Mickley, Mickleys, Pa.\r\n\r\nWe would add, as being of interest, that Mrs. Eddy is\r\na member of the above organization, having been made\r\nsuch by the special request of the late Mrs. Harrison,\r\nwife of the ex-President, who was at that time the Presi- [20]\r\ndent thereof.—ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngels\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen angels visit us, we do not hear the rustle of wings, [1]\r\nnor feel the feathery touch of the breast of a dove; but\r\nwe know their presence by the love they create in our [25]\r\nhearts. Oh, may you feel _this_ touch,—it is not the\r\nclasping of hands, nor a loved person present; it is more\r\nthan this: it is a spiritual idea that lights your path!\r\nThe Psalmist saith: “He shall give His angels charge\r\n\r\n[Page 307.]\r\n\r\nover thee.” God gives you His spiritual ideas, and in [1]\r\nturn, they give you daily supplies. Never ask for to-\r\nmorrow: it is enough that divine Love is an ever-present\r\nhelp; and if you wait, never doubting, you will have\r\nall you need every moment. What a glorious inheritance [5]\r\nis given to us through the understanding of omnipresent\r\nLove! More we cannot ask: more we do not want:\r\nmore we cannot have. This sweet assurance is the\r\n“Peace, be still” to all human fears, to suffering of every\r\nsort. [10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeification Of Personality\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rapid sale already of two editions\r\nof “Christ and Christmas,” and many orders on hand, I\r\nhave thought best to stop its publication.\r\n\r\nIn this revolutionary religious period, the increasing [15]\r\ninquiry of mankind as to Christianity and its unity—\r\nand above all, God’s love opening the eyes of the blind—is\r\nfast fitting all minds for the proper reception of\r\nChristian Science healing.\r\n\r\nBut I must stand on this absolute basis of Christian [20]\r\nScience; namely, Cast not pearls before the unprepared\r\nthought. Idolatry is an easily-besetting sin of all peoples.\r\nThe apostle saith, “Little children, keep yourselves from\r\nidols.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrations were not intended for a golden calf, [25]\r\nat which the sick may look and be healed. Christian\r\nScientists should beware of unseen snares, and adhere\r\nto the divine Principle and rules for demonstration.\r\nThey must guard against the deification of finite personality.\r\nEvery human thought must turn instinctively to [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 308.]\r\n\r\nthe divine Mind as its sole centre and intelligence. Until [1]\r\nthis be done, man will never be found harmonious and\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nWhosoever looks to me personally for his health or\r\nholiness, mistakes. He that by reason of human love or [5]\r\nhatred or any other cause clings to my material per-\r\nsonality, greatly errs, stops his own progress, and loses\r\nthe path to health, happiness, and heaven. The Scrip-\r\ntures and Christian Science reveal “the way,” and per-\r\nsonal revelators will take their proper place in history, [10]\r\nbut will not be deified.\r\n\r\nAdvanced scientific students are ready for “Christ\r\nand Christmas;” but those are a minority of its readers,\r\nand even they know its practicality only by healing\r\nthe sick on its divine Principle. In the words of the [15]\r\nprophet, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one\r\nLord.”\r\n\r\nFriends, strangers, and Christian Scientists, I thank\r\nyou, each and all, for your liberal patronage and scholarly,\r\nartistic, and scientific notices of my book. This little [20]\r\nmessenger has done its work, fulfilled its mission, retired\r\nwith honor (and mayhap taught me more than it has\r\nothers), only to reappear in due season. The knowledge\r\nthat I have gleaned from its fruitage is, that intensely\r\ncontemplating personality impedes spiritual growth; even [25]\r\nas holding in mind the consciousness of disease prevents\r\nthe recovery of the sick.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is taught through its divine Prin-\r\nciple, which is invisible to corporeal sense. A material\r\nhuman likeness is the antipode of man in the image and [30]\r\nlikeness of God. Hence, a finite person is not the model\r\nfor a metaphysician. I earnestly advise all Christian\r\nScientists to remove from their observation or study\r\n\r\n[Page 309.]\r\n\r\nthe personal sense of any one, and not to dwell in thought [1]\r\nupon their own or others’ corporeality, either as good or\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nAccording to Christian Science, material personality is\r\nan error in premise, and must result in erroneous con- [5]\r\nclusions. All will agree with me that material portraiture\r\noften fails to express even mortal man, and this declares\r\nits unfitness for fable or fact to build upon.\r\n\r\nThe face of Jesus has uniformly been so unnaturally\r\ndelineated that it has turned many from the true con- [10]\r\ntemplation of his character. He advances most in divine\r\nScience who meditates most on infinite spiritual sub-\r\nstance and intelligence. Experience proves this true.\r\nPondering on the finite personality of Jesus, the son of\r\nman, is not the channel through which we reach the [15]\r\nChrist, or Son of God, the true idea of man’s divine\r\nPrinciple.\r\n\r\nI warn students against falling into the error of anti-\r\nChrist. The consciousness of corporeality, and what-\r\never is connected therewith, must be outgrown. Corporeal [20]\r\nfalsities include all obstacles to health, holiness, and\r\nheaven. Man’s individual life is infinitely above a\r\nbodily form of existence, and the human concept an-\r\ntagonizes the divine. “Science and Health with Key\r\nto the Scriptures,” on page 229, third and fourth para- [25]\r\ngraphs, elucidates this topic.(5)\r\n\r\nMy Christmas poem and its illustrations are not a text-\r\nbook. Scientists sometimes take things too intensely.\r\nLet them soberly adhere to the Bible and Science and\r\nHealth, which contain all and much more than they [30]\r\nhave yet learned. We should prohibit ourselves the\r\n\r\n[Page 310.]\r\n\r\nchildish pleasure of studying Truth through the senses, [1]\r\nfor this is neither the intent of my works nor possible\r\nin Science.\r\n\r\nEven the teachings of Jesus would be misused by sub-\r\nstituting personality for the Christ, or the impersonal [5]\r\nform of Truth, amplified in this age by the discovery of\r\nChristian Science. To impersonalize scientifically the\r\nmaterial sense of existence—rather than cling to per-\r\nsonality—is the lesson of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Card\r\n\r\n\r\nMy answer to manifold letters relative to the return\r\nof members that have gone out of The First Church of\r\nChrist, Scientist, in Boston, is this: While my affec-\r\ntions plead for all and every one, and my desire is that\r\nall shall be redeemed, I am not unmindful that the Scrip- [15]\r\ntures enjoin, “Let all things be done decently and in\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nTo continue one’s connection with this church, or to\r\nregain it, one must comply with the church rules. All\r\nwho desire its fellowship, and to become members of it, [20]\r\nmust send in their petitions to this effect to the Clerk\r\nof the church; and upon a meeting being called, the\r\nFirst Members will determine the action of the church\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverflowing Thoughts\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this receding year of religious jubilee, 1894, I as [26]\r\nan individual would cordially invite all persons who\r\nhave left our fold, together with those who never have\r\n\r\n[Page 311.]\r\n\r\nbeen in it,—all who love God and keep His command- [1]\r\nments,—to come and unite with The Mother Church in\r\nBoston. The true Christian Scientists will be welcomed,\r\ngreeted as brethren endeavoring to walk with us hand\r\nin hand, as we journey to the celestial city. [5]\r\n\r\nAlso, I would extend a tender invitation to Christian\r\nScientists’ students, those who are ready for the table of\r\nour Lord: so, should we follow Christ’s teachings; so,\r\nbury the dead past; so, loving one another, go forth to\r\nthe full vintage-time, exemplifying what we profess. But [10]\r\nsome of the older members are not quite ready to take\r\nthis advanced step in the full spirit of that charity which\r\nthinketh no evil; and if it be not taken thus, it is impracti-\r\ncal, unfruitful, Soul-less.\r\n\r\nMy deepest desires and daily labors go to prove that [15]\r\nI love my enemies and would help all to gain the abiding\r\nconsciousness of health, happiness, and heaven.\r\n\r\nI hate no one; and love others more than they can\r\nlove me. As I now understand Christian Science, I would\r\nas soon harm myself as another; since by breaking [20]\r\nChrist’s command, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as\r\nthyself,” I should lose my hope of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe works I have written on Christian Science con-\r\ntain absolute Truth, and my necessity was to tell it;\r\ntherefore I did this even as a surgeon who wounds [25]\r\nto heal. I was a scribe under orders; and who can\r\nrefrain from transcribing what God indites, and ought\r\nnot that one to take the cup, drink all of it, and give\r\nthanks?\r\n\r\nBeing often reported as saying what never escaped [30]\r\nfrom my lips, when rehearsing facts concerning others\r\nwho were reporting false charges, I have been sorry that\r\n\r\n[Page 312.]\r\n\r\nI spoke at all, and wished I were wise enough to guard [1]\r\nagainst that temptation. Oh, may the love that is talked,\r\nbe _felt_! and so _lived_, that when weighed in the scale of\r\nGod we be not found wanting. Love is consistent, uni-\r\nform, sympathetic, self-sacrificing, unutterably kind; even [5]\r\nthat which lays all upon the altar, and, speechless and\r\nalone, bears all burdens, suffers all inflictions, endures\r\nall piercing for the sake of others, and for the kingdom\r\nof heaven’s sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Great Man And His Saying\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. Charles Carrol Bonney, President of the World’s [11]\r\nCongress Auxiliary, in his remarks before that body,\r\nsaid, “No more striking manifestation of the interposi-\r\ntion of divine Providence in human affairs has come in\r\nrecent years, than that shown in the raising up of the [15]\r\nbody of people known as Christian Scientists, who are\r\ncalled to declare the real harmony between religion and\r\nScience, and to restore the waning faith of many in the\r\nverities of the sacred Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nIn honest utterance of veritable history, and his own [20]\r\nspiritual discernment, this man must have risen above\r\nworldly schemes, human theorems or hypotheses, to\r\nconclusions which reason too supine or misemployed\r\ncannot fasten upon. He spake inspired; he touched a\r\ntone of Truth that will continue to reverberate and renew [25]\r\nits emphasis throughout the entire centuries, into the vast\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n[Page 313.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWords Of Commendation\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editor of The Christian Science Journal_:—Permit me\r\nto say that your editorial in the August number is _par_\r\n_excellence_.\r\n\r\nIt is a digest of good manners, morals, methods, and [5]\r\nmeans. It points to the scientific spiritual molecule,\r\npearl, and pinnacle, that everybody needs. May the\r\nChristlikeness it reflects rest on the dear readers, and\r\nthrow the light of penetration on the page; even as the\r\ndawn, kindling its glories in the east, lightens earth’s [10]\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nI thank the contributors to _The Christian Science_\r\n_Journal_ for their jewels of thought, so adapted to the\r\nhour, and without ill-humor or hyperbolic tumor. I\r\nwas impressed by the articles entitled “The New Pas- [15]\r\ntor,” by Rev. Lanson P. Norcross, “The Lamp,” by\r\nWalter Church, “The Temptation,” a poem by J. J.\r\nRome, etc.\r\n\r\nThe field waves its white ensign, the reapers are strong,\r\nthe rich sheaves are ripe, the storehouse is ready: pray [20]\r\nye therefore the God of harvest to send forth more\r\nlaborers of the excellent sort, and garner the supplies\r\nfor a world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChurch And School\r\n\r\n\r\nHumbly, and, as I believe, divinely directed, I hereby [25]\r\nordain the Bible, and “Science and Health with Key\r\nto the Scriptures,” to be hereafter the only pastor of\r\n\r\n[Page 314.]\r\n\r\nThe Church of Christ, Scientist, throughout our land [1]\r\nand in other lands.\r\n\r\nFrom this date the Sunday services of our denomina-\r\ntion shall be conducted by Readers in lieu of pastors.\r\nEach church, or society formed for Sunday worship, [5]\r\nshall elect two Readers: a male, and a female. One of\r\nthese individuals shall open the meeting by reading the\r\nhymns, and chapter (or portion of the chapter) in the\r\nBible, lead in silent prayer, and repeat in concert with\r\nthe congregation the Lord’s Prayer. Also, this First [10]\r\nReader shall give out any notices from the pulpit, shall\r\nread the Scriptures indicated in the Sunday School Les-\r\nson of the _Christian Science Quarterly_, and shall pro-\r\nnounce the benediction.\r\n\r\nThe First Reader shall read from my book, “Science [15]\r\nand Health with Key to the Scriptures,” alternately in\r\nresponse to the congregation, the spiritual interpreta-\r\ntion of the Lord’s Prayer; also, shall read all the selec-\r\ntions from Science and Health referred to in the Sunday\r\nLessons. [20]\r\n\r\nThe Reader of the Scriptures shall name, at each\r\nreading, the book, chapter, and verses. The Reader of\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” shall\r\ncommence by announcing the full title of this book, with\r\nthe name of its author, and add to this announcement, [25]\r\n“the Christian Science textbook.” It is unnecessary to\r\nrepeat the title or page. This form shall also be observed\r\nat the Communion service; the selections from both the\r\nBible and the Christian Science textbook shall be taken\r\nfrom the _Quarterly_, as heretofore, and this Lesson shall [30]\r\nbe such as is adapted to that service. On the first Sunday\r\nof each month, except Communion Sunday, a sermon\r\n\r\n[Page 315.]\r\n\r\nshall be preached to the children, from selections taken [1]\r\nfrom the Scriptures and Science and Health, especially\r\nadapted to the occasion, and read after the manner of\r\nthe Sunday service. The children’s service shall be\r\nheld on the Sunday following Communion Day. [5]\r\n\r\nNo copies from my books are allowed to be written,\r\nand read from manuscripts, either in private or in pub-\r\nlic assemblies, except by their author.\r\n\r\nChristian Scientists, all over the world, who are let-\r\nterly fit and specially spiritually fitted for teachers, can [10]\r\nteach annually three classes only. They shall teach\r\nfrom the Christian Science textbook. Each class shall\r\nconsist of not over thirty-three students, carefully selected,\r\nand only of such as have promising proclivities toward\r\nChristian Science. The teacher shall hold himself mor- [15]\r\nally obligated to look after the welfare of his students,\r\nnot only through class term, but after it; and to watch\r\nwell that they prove sound in sentiment, health, and\r\npractical Christian Science.\r\n\r\nTeaching Christian Science shall be no question of [20]\r\nmoney, but of morals and of uplifting the race. Teachers\r\nshall form associations for this purpose; and for the\r\nfirst few years, convene as often as once in three months.\r\nTeachers shall not silently mentally address the thought,\r\nto handle it, nor allow their students to do thus, except [25]\r\nthe individual needing it asks for mental treatment.\r\nThey shall steadily and patiently strive to educate their\r\nstudents in conformity to the unerring wisdom and law\r\nof God, and shall enjoin upon them habitually to study\r\nHis revealed Word, the Scriptures, and “Science and [30]\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nThey shall teach their students how to defend them-\r\n\r\n[Page 316.]\r\n\r\nselves against mental malpractice, but never to return [1]\r\nevil for evil; never to attack the malpractitioner, but\r\nto know the truth that makes free,—and so to be a law\r\nnot unto others, but themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass, Pulpit, Students’ Students\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen will you take a class in Christian Science or [6]\r\nspeak to your church in Boston? is often asked.\r\n\r\nI shall speak to my dear church at Boston very seldom.\r\nThe Mother Church must be self-sustained by God.\r\nThe date of a class in Christian Science should depend [10]\r\non the fitness of things, the tide which flows heavenward,\r\nthe hour best for the student. Until minds become less\r\nworldly-minded, and depart farther from the primitives\r\nof the race, and have profited up to their present capac-\r\nity from the written word, they are not ready for the [15]\r\nword spoken at this date.\r\n\r\nMy juniors can tell others what they know, and turn\r\nthem slowly toward the haven. Imperative, accumula-\r\ntive, sweet demands rest on my retirement from life’s\r\nbustle. What, then, of continual recapitulation of tired [20]\r\naphorisms and disappointed ethics; of patching breaches\r\nwidened the next hour; of pounding wisdom and love\r\ninto sounding brass; of warming marble and quench-\r\ning volcanoes! Before entering the Massachusetts Meta-\r\nphysical College, had my students achieved the point [25]\r\nwhence they could have derived most benefit from their\r\npupilage, to-day there would be on earth paragons of\r\nChristianity, patterns of humility, wisdom, and might\r\nfor the world.\r\n\r\n[Page 317.]\r\n\r\nTo the students whom I have not seen that ask, “May [1]\r\nI call you mother?” my heart replies, _Yes_, if you are\r\ndoing God’s work. When born of Truth and Love, we\r\nare all of one kindred.\r\n\r\nThe hour has struck for Christian Scientists to do their [5]\r\nown work; to appreciate the signs of the times; to dem-\r\nonstrate self-knowledge and self-government; and to\r\ndemonstrate, as this period demands, over all sin, disease,\r\nand death. The dear ones whom I would have great\r\npleasure in instructing, know that the door to my teaching [10]\r\nwas shut when my College closed.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not absolutely requisite for some people\r\nto be taught in a class, for they can learn by spiritual\r\ngrowth and by the study of what is written. Scarcely a\r\nmoiety, compared with the whole of the Scriptures and [15]\r\nthe Christian Science textbook, is yet assimilated spirit-\r\nually by the most faithful seekers; yet this assimilation is\r\nindispensable to the progress of every Christian Scientist.\r\nThese considerations prompt my answers to the above\r\nquestions. Human desire is inadequate to adjust the [20]\r\nbalance on subjects of such earnest import. These\r\nwords of our Master explain this hour: “What I do\r\nthou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.”\r\n\r\nMy sympathies are deeply enlisted for the students\r\nof students; having already seen in many instances their [25]\r\ntalents, culture, and singleness of purpose to uplift the\r\nrace. Such students should not pay the penalty for\r\nother people’s faults; and divine Love will open the\r\nway for them. My soul abhors injustice, and loves\r\nmercy. St. John writes: “Whom God hath sent speaketh [30]\r\nthe words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meas-\r\nure unto him.”\r\n\r\n[Page 318.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Students And Thy Students\r\n\r\n\r\nMine and thine are obsolete terms in absolute Christian [2]\r\nScience, wherein and whereby the universal brotherhood\r\nof man is stated and demands to be demonstrated. I have\r\na large affection, not alone for my students, but for thy [5]\r\nstudents,—for students of the second generation. I can-\r\nnot but love some of those devoted students better than\r\nsome of mine who are less lovable or Christly. This\r\nnatural affection for goodness must go on _ad libitum_ unto\r\nthe third and fourth and final generation of those who [10]\r\nlove God and keep His commandments. Hence the\r\nfollowing is an amendment of the paragraph on page 47(6)\r\nof “Retrospection and Introspection”:—\r\n\r\nAny student, having received instructions in a Primary\r\nclass from me, or from a loyal student of Christian Science, [15]\r\nand afterwards studied thoroughly “Science and Health\r\nwith Key to the Scriptures,” can enter upon the gospel\r\nwork of teaching Christian Science, and so fulfil the command\r\nof Christ. Before entering this sacred field of labor,\r\nthe student must have studied faithfully the latest edi- [20]\r\ntions of my works, and be a good Bible scholar and a\r\ndevout, consecrated Christian.\r\n\r\nThese are the indispensable demands on all those who\r\nbecome teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnseen Sin\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo points of danger beset mankind; namely, making [26]\r\nsin seem either too large or too little: if too large, we\r\n\r\n[Page 319.]\r\n\r\nare in the darkness of all the ages, wherein the true sense [1]\r\nof the unity of good and the unreality of evil is lost.\r\n\r\nIf good is God, even as God is good, then good and\r\nevil can neither be coeval nor coequal, for God is All-in-\r\nall. This closes the argument of aught besides Him, aught [5]\r\nelse than good.\r\n\r\nIf the sense of sin is too little, mortals are in danger\r\nof not seeing their own belief in sin, but of seeing too\r\nkeenly their neighbor’s. Then they are beset with\r\negotism and hypocrisy. Here Christian Scientists must [10]\r\nbe most watchful. Their habit of mental and audible\r\nprotest against the reality of sin, tends to make sin less\r\nor more to them than to other people. They must either\r\nbe overcoming sin in themselves, or they must not lose\r\nsight of sin; else they are self-deceived sinners of the [15]\r\nworst sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Word To The Wise\r\n\r\n\r\nWill all the dear Christian Scientists accept my tender\r\ngreetings for the forthcoming holidays, and grant me\r\nthis request,—let the present season pass without one [20]\r\ngift to me.\r\n\r\nOur church edifice must be built in 1894. Take thither\r\nthy saintly offerings, and lay them in the outstretched\r\nhand of God. The object to be won affords ample oppor-\r\ntunity for the grandest achievement to which Christian [25]\r\nScientists can direct attention, and feel themselves alone\r\namong the stars.\r\n\r\nNo doubt must intervene between the promise and\r\nevent; faith and resolve are friends to Truth; seize them,\r\n\r\n[Page 320.]\r\n\r\ntrust the divine Providence, push upward our prayer in [1]\r\nstone,—and God will give the benediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interesting day, crowned with the history of\r\nTruth’s idea,—its earthly advent and nativity,—is [5]\r\nespecially dear to the heart of Christian Scientists; to\r\nwhom Christ’s appearing in a fuller sense is so precious,\r\nand fraught with divine benedictions for mankind.\r\n\r\nThe star that looked lovingly down on the manger of\r\nour Lord, lends its resplendent light to this hour: the [10]\r\nlight of Truth, to cheer, guide, and bless man as he\r\nreaches forth for the infant idea of divine perfection\r\ndawning upon human imperfection,—that calms man’s\r\nfears, bears his burdens, beckons him on to Truth and\r\nLove and the sweet immunity these bring from sin, sick- [15]\r\nness, and death.\r\n\r\nThis polar star, fixed in the heavens of divine Science,\r\nshall be the sign of his appearing who “healeth all our\r\ndiseases;” it hath traversed night, wading through\r\ndarkness and gloom, on to glory. It doth meet the [20]\r\nantagonism of error; addressing to dull ears and undis-\r\nciplined beliefs words of Truth and Life.\r\n\r\nThe star of Bethlehem is the star of Boston, high in\r\nthe zenith of Truth’s domain, that looketh down on the\r\nlong night of human beliefs, to pierce the darkness and [25]\r\nmelt into dawn.\r\n\r\nThe star of Bethlehem is the light of all ages; is the\r\nlight of Love, to-day christening religion undefiled, divine\r\nScience; giving to it a new name, and the white stone in\r\ntoken of purity and permanence. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 321.]\r\n\r\nThe wise men follow this guiding star; the watchful [1]\r\nshepherd chants his welcome over the cradle of a great\r\ntruth, and saith, “Unto us a child is born,” whose birth\r\nis less of a miracle than eighteen centuries ago; and “his\r\nname shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty [5]\r\nGod, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.”\r\n\r\nMy heart is filled with joy, that each receding year sees\r\nthe steady gain of Truth’s idea in Christian Science; that\r\neach recurring year witnesses the balance adjusted more\r\non the side of God, the supremacy of Spirit; as shown [10]\r\nby the triumphs of Truth over error, of health over sick-\r\nness, of Life over death, and of Soul over sense.\r\n\r\n“The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor-\r\nshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.”\r\n“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made [15]\r\nme free from the law of sin and death.” “Fear not, little\r\nflock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you\r\nthe kingdom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    Press on, press on! ye sons of light,\r\n    Untiring in your holy fight, [20]\r\n    Still treading each temptation down,\r\n    And battling for a brighter crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCard\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply to all invitations from Chicago to share the\r\nhospitality of their beautiful homes at any time during [25]\r\nthe great wonder of the world, the World’s Fair, I say,\r\nDo not expect me. I have no desire to see or to hear\r\nwhat is to be offered upon this approaching occasion.\r\n\r\nI have a world of wisdom and Love to contemplate,\r\nthat concerns me, and you, infinitely beyond all earthly [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 322.]\r\n\r\nexpositions or exhibitions. In return for your kindness, [1]\r\nI earnestly invite you to its contemplation with me, and\r\nto preparation to behold it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessage To The Mother Church\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Brethren_:—People coming from a distance [5]\r\nexpecting to hear me speak in The Mother Church,\r\nare frequently disappointed. To avoid this, I may here-\r\nafter notify the Directors when I shall be present to\r\naddress this congregation, and the Clerk of the church\r\ncan inform correspondents. Your dual and impersonal [10]\r\npastor, the Bible, and “Science and Health with Key to\r\nthe Scriptures,” is with you; and the Life these give, the\r\nTruth they illustrate, the Love they demonstrate, is\r\nthe great Shepherd that feedeth my flock, and leadeth\r\nthem “beside the still waters.” By any personal pres- [15]\r\nence, or word of mine, your thought must not be diverted\r\nor diverged, your senses satisfied, or self be justified.\r\n\r\nTherefore, beloved, my often-coming is unnecessary;\r\nfor, though I be present or absent, it is God that feed-\r\neth the hungry heart, that giveth grace for grace, that [20]\r\nhealeth the sick and cleanseth the sinner. For this\r\nconsummation He hath given you Christian Science,\r\nand my past poor labors and love. He hath shown you\r\nthe amplitude of His mercy, the justice of His judgment,\r\nthe omnipotence of His love; and this, to compensate [25]\r\nyour zealous affection for seeking good, and for labor-\r\ning in its widening grooves from the infinitesimal to the\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE FRUIT OF SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 323.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Allegory\r\n\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself “a city set upon a hill,” a [2]\r\ncelestial city above all clouds, in serene azure and\r\nunfathomable glory: having no temple therein, for God is\r\nthe temple thereof; nor need of the sun, neither of the [5]\r\nmoon, for God doth lighten it. Then from this sacred\r\nsummit behold a Stranger wending his way downward,\r\nto where a few laborers in a valley at the foot of the moun-\r\ntain are working and watching for his coming.\r\n\r\nThe descent and ascent are beset with peril, priva- [10]\r\ntion, temptation, toil, suffering. Venomous serpents hide\r\namong the rocks, beasts of prey prowl in the path, wolves\r\nin sheep’s clothing are ready to devour; but the Stranger\r\nmeets and masters their secret and open attacks with\r\nserene confidence. [15]\r\n\r\nThe Stranger eventually stands in the valley at the\r\nfoot of the mountain. He saith unto the patient toilers\r\ntherein: “What do ye here? Would ye ascend the moun-\r\ntain,—climbing its rough cliffs, hushing the hissing\r\nserpents, taming the beasts of prey,—and bathe in its [20]\r\nstreams, rest in its cool grottos, and drink from its living\r\nfountains? The way winds and widens in the valley;\r\nup the hill it is straight and narrow, and few there be that\r\nfind it.”\r\n\r\n[Page 324.]\r\n\r\nHis converse with the watchers and workers in the [1]\r\nvalley closes, and he makes his way into the streets of a\r\ncity made with hands.\r\n\r\nPausing at the threshold of a palatial dwelling, he\r\nknocks and waits. The door is shut. He hears the [5]\r\nsounds of festivity and mirth; youth, manhood, and age\r\ngayly tread the gorgeously tapestried parlors, dancing-\r\nhalls, and banquet-rooms. But a little while, and the\r\nmusic is dull, the wine is unsipped, the footfalls abate,\r\nthe laughter ceases. Then from the window of this dwel- [10]\r\nling a face looks out, anxiously surveying him who waiteth\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nWithin this mortal mansion are adulterers, fornicators,\r\nidolaters; drunkenness, witchcraft, variance, envy, emu-\r\nlation, hatred, wrath, murder. Appetites and passions [15]\r\nhave so dimmed their sight that he alone who looks from\r\nthat dwelling, through the clearer pane of his own heart\r\ntired of sin, can see the Stranger.\r\n\r\nStartled beyond measure at beholding him, this mortal\r\ninmate withdraws; but growing more and more troubled, [20]\r\nhe seeks to leave the odious company and the cruel walls,\r\nand to find the Stranger. Stealing cautiously away from\r\nhis comrades, he departs; then turns back,—he is afraid\r\nto go on and to meet the Stranger. So he returns to the\r\nhouse, only to find the lights all wasted and the music [25]\r\nfled. Finding no happiness within, he rushes again\r\ninto the lonely streets, seeking peace but finding none.\r\nNaked, hungry, athirst, this time he struggles on, and\r\nat length reaches the pleasant path of the valley at the\r\nfoot of the mountain, whence he may hopefully look for [30]\r\nthe reappearance of the Stranger, and receive his heavenly\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n[Page 325.]\r\n\r\nThe Stranger enters a massive carved stone mansion, [1]\r\nand saith unto the dwellers therein, “Blessed are the\r\npoor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” But\r\nthey understand not his saying.\r\n\r\nThese are believers of different sects, and of no sect; [5]\r\nsome, so-called Christian Scientists in sheep’s clothing;\r\nand all “drunken without wine.” They have small con-\r\nceptions of spiritual riches, few cravings for the immortal,\r\nbut are puffed up with the applause of the world: they\r\nhave plenty of pelf, and fear not to fall upon the Stranger, [10]\r\nseize his pearls, throw them away, and afterwards try to\r\nkill him.\r\n\r\nSomewhat disheartened, he patiently seeks another\r\ndwelling,—only to find its inmates asleep at noontide!\r\nRobust forms, with manly brow nodding on cushioned [15]\r\nchairs, their feet resting on footstools, or, flat on their\r\nbacks, lie stretched on the floor, dreaming away the\r\nhours. Balancing on one foot, with eyes half open,\r\nthe porter starts up in blank amazement and looks at\r\nthe Stranger, calls out, rubs his eyes,—amazed beyond [20]\r\nmeasure that anybody is animated with a purpose, and\r\nseen working for it!\r\n\r\nThey in this house are those that “provoke Him in\r\nthe wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert.” Away\r\nfrom this charnel-house of the so-called living, the Stranger [25]\r\nturns quickly, and wipes off the dust from his feet as a\r\ntestimony against sensualism in its myriad forms. As\r\nhe departs, he sees robbers finding ready ingress to that\r\ndwelling of sleepers in the midst of murderous hordes,\r\nwithout watchers and the doors unbarred! [30]\r\n\r\nNext he enters a place of worship, and saith unto them,\r\n“Go ye into all the world; preach the gospel, heal the\r\n\r\n[Page 326.]\r\n\r\nsick, cast out devils, raise the dead; for the Scripture [1]\r\nsaith the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath\r\nmade you free from the law of sin and death.” And _they_\r\n_cast him out_.\r\n\r\nOnce more he seeks the dwelling-place of mortals and [5]\r\nknocks loudly. The door is burst open, and sufferers\r\nshriek for help: that house is on fire! The flames caught\r\nin the dwelling of luxury, where the blind saw them not,\r\nbut the flesh at length did feel them; thence they spread\r\nto the house of slumberers who heeded them not, until [10]\r\nthey became unmanageable; fed by the fat of hypocrisy\r\nand vainglory, they consumed the next dwelling; then\r\ncrept unseen into the synagogue, licking up the blood\r\nof martyrs and wrapping their altars in ruins. “God is a\r\nconsuming fire.” [15]\r\n\r\nThus are all mortals, under every hue of circumstances,\r\ndriven out of their houses of clay and, homeless wan-\r\nderers in a beleaguered city, forced to seek the Father’s\r\nhouse, if they would be led to the valley and up the\r\nmount. [20]\r\n\r\nSeeing the wisdom of withdrawing from those who\r\npersistently rejected him, the Stranger returned to the\r\nvalley; first, to meet with joy his own, to wash their\r\nfeet, and take them up the mountain. Well might this\r\nheavenly messenger exclaim, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [25]\r\nthou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which\r\nare sent unto thee,... Behold, your house is left unto\r\nyou desolate.”\r\n\r\nDiscerning in his path the penitent one who had groped\r\nhis way from the dwelling of luxury, the Stranger saith [30]\r\nunto him, “Wherefore comest thou hither?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “The sight of thee unveiled my sins, and\r\n\r\n[Page 327.]\r\n\r\nturned my misnamed joys to sorrow. When I went back [1]\r\ninto the house to take something out of it, my misery\r\nincreased; so I came hither, hoping that I might follow\r\nthee whithersoever thou goest.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Stranger saith unto him, “Wilt thou climb [5]\r\nthe mountain, and take nothing of thine own with thee?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I will.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” saith the Stranger, “thou hast chosen the\r\ngood part; follow me.”\r\n\r\nMany there were who had entered the valley to specu- [10]\r\nlate in worldly policy, religion, politics, finance, and to\r\nsearch for wealth and fame. These had heavy baggage\r\nof their own, and insisted upon taking all of it with them,\r\nwhich must greatly hinder their ascent.\r\n\r\nThe journey commences. The encumbered travellers [15]\r\nhalt and disagree. They stoutly belay those who, hav-\r\ning less baggage, ascend faster than themselves, and\r\nbetimes burden them with their own. Despairing of\r\ngaining the summit, loaded as they are, they conclude to\r\nstop and lay down a few of the heavy weights,—but [20]\r\nonly to take them up again, more than ever determined\r\nnot to part with their baggage.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Stranger is pointing the way, show-\r\ning them their folly, rebuking their pride, consoling their\r\nafflictions, and helping them on, saying, “He that loseth [25]\r\nhis life for my sake, shall find it.”\r\n\r\nObstinately holding themselves back, and sore-footed,\r\nthey fall behind and lose sight of their guide; when,\r\nstumbling and grumbling, and fighting each other, they\r\nplunge headlong over the jagged rocks. [30]\r\n\r\nThen he who has no baggage goes back and kindly\r\nbinds up their wounds, wipes away the blood stains, and\r\n\r\n[Page 328.]\r\n\r\nwould help them on; but suddenly the Stranger shouts, [1]\r\n“Let them alone; they must learn from the things they\r\nsuffer. Make thine own way; and if thou strayest, listen\r\nfor the mountain-horn, and it will call thee back to the\r\npath that goeth upward.” [5]\r\n\r\nDear reader, dost thou suspect that the valley is hu-\r\nmility, that the mountain is heaven-crowned Christianity,\r\nand the Stranger the ever-present Christ, the spiritual\r\nidea which from the summit of bliss surveys the vale of\r\nthe flesh, to burst the bubbles of earth with a breath of [10]\r\nheaven, and acquaint sensual mortals with the mystery\r\nof godliness,—unchanging, unquenchable Love? Hast\r\nnot thou heard this Christ knock at the door of thine own\r\nheart, and closed it against Truth, to “eat and drink\r\nwith the drunken”? Hast thou been driven by suffer- [15]\r\ning to the foot of the mount, but earth-bound, burdened\r\nby pride, sin, and self, hast thou turned back, stumbled,\r\nand wandered away? Or hast thou tarried in the habita-\r\ntion of the senses, pleased and stupefied, until wakened\r\nthrough the baptism of fire? [20]\r\n\r\nHe alone ascends the hill of Christian Science who\r\nfollows the Way-shower, the spiritual presence and idea\r\nof God. Whatever obstructs the way,—causing to\r\nstumble, fall, or faint, those mortals who are striving\r\nto enter the path,—divine Love will remove; and up- [25]\r\nlift the fallen and strengthen the weak. Therefore, give\r\nup thy earth-weights; and observe the apostle’s admoni-\r\ntion, “Forgetting those things which are behind, and\r\nreaching forth unto those which are before.” Then,\r\nloving God supremely and thy neighbor as thyself, thou [30]\r\nwilt safely bear thy cross up to the throne of everlasting\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n[Page 329.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVoices Of Spring\r\n\r\n\r\nMine is an obstinate _penchant_ for nature in all her [2]\r\nmoods and forms, a satisfaction with whatever is hers.\r\nAnd what shall this be named, a weakness, or a—\r\nvirtue? [5]\r\n\r\nIn spring, nature like a thrifty housewife sets the earth\r\nin order; and between taking up the white carpets and\r\nputting down the green ones, her various apartments are\r\ndismally dirty.\r\n\r\nSpring is my sweetheart, whose voices are sad or glad, [10]\r\neven as the heart may be; restoring in memory the sweet\r\nrhythm of unforgotten harmonies, or touching tenderly\r\nits tearful tones.\r\n\r\nSpring passes over mountain and meadow, waking up\r\nthe world; weaving the wavy grass, nursing the timid [15]\r\nspray, stirring the soft breeze; rippling all nature in\r\nceaseless flow, with “breath all odor and cheek all bloom.”\r\nWhatever else droops, spring is gay: her little feet trip\r\nlightly on, turning up the daisies, paddling the water-\r\ncresses, rocking the oriole’s cradle; challenging the sed- [20]\r\nentary shadows to activity, and the streams to race for the\r\nsea. Her dainty fingers put the fur cap on pussy-willow,\r\npaint in pink the petals of arbutus, and sweep in soft\r\nstrains her Orphean lyre. “The voice of the turtle is\r\nheard in our land.” The snow-bird that tarried through [25]\r\nthe storm, now chirps to the breeze; the cuckoo sounds\r\nher invisible lute, calling the feathered tribe back to their\r\nsummer homes. Old robin, though stricken to the heart\r\nwith winter’s snow, prophesies of fair earth and sunny\r\nskies. The brooklet sings melting murmurs to merry [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 330.]\r\n\r\nmeadows; the leaves clap their hands, and the winds [1]\r\nmake melody through dark pine groves.\r\n\r\nWhat is the anthem of human life?\r\n\r\nHas love ceased to moan over the new-made grave,\r\nand, looking upward, does it patiently pray for the per- [5]\r\npetual springtide wherein no arrow wounds the dove?\r\nHuman hope and faith should join in nature’s grand har-\r\nmony, and, if on minor key, make music in the heart.\r\nAnd man, more friendly, should call his race as gently\r\nto the springtide of Christ’s dear love. St. Paul wrote, [10]\r\n“Rejoice in the Lord always.” And why not, since man’s\r\npossibilities are infinite, bliss is eternal, and the conscious-\r\nness thereof is here and now?\r\n\r\nThe alders bend over the streams to shake out their\r\ntresses in the water-mirrors; let mortals bow before the [15]\r\ncreator, and, looking through Love’s transparency, behold\r\nman in God’s own image and likeness, arranging in the\r\nbeauty of holiness each budding thought. It is good to\r\ntalk with our past hours, and learn what report they\r\nbear, and how they might have reported more spirit- [20]\r\nual growth. With each returning year, higher joys,\r\nholier aims, a purer peace and diviner energy, should\r\nfreshen the fragrance of being. Nature’s first and last\r\nlessons teach man to be kind, and even pride should\r\nsanction what our natures need. Popularity,—what is [25]\r\nit? A mere mendicant that boasts and begs, and God\r\ndenies charity.\r\n\r\nWhen gentle violet lifts its blue eye to heaven, and\r\ncrown imperial unveils its regal splendor to the sun;\r\nwhen the modest grass, inhabiting the whole earth, stoops [30]\r\nmeekly before the blast; when the patient corn waits\r\non the elements to put forth its slender blade, construct\r\n\r\n[Page 331.]\r\n\r\nthe stalk, instruct the ear, and crown the full corn in the [1]\r\near,—then, are mortals looking up, waiting on God,\r\nand committing their way unto Him who tosses earth’s\r\nmass of wonders into their hands? When downtrodden\r\nlike the grass, did it make them humble, loving, obedi- [5]\r\nent, full of good odor, and cause them to wait patiently\r\non God for man’s rich heritage,—“dominion over all\r\nthe earth”? Thus abiding in Truth, the warmth and\r\nsunlight of prayer and praise and understanding will\r\nripen the fruits of Spirit, and goodness will have its spring- [10]\r\ntide of freedom and greatness.\r\n\r\nWhen the white-winged dove feeds her callow brood,\r\nnestles them under her wings, and, in tones tremulous\r\nwith tenderness, calls them to her breast, do mortals\r\nremember _their_ cradle hymns, and thank God for those [15]\r\nredemptive words from a mother’s lips which taught\r\nthem the Lord’s Prayer?\r\n\r\n\r\n    O gentle presence, peace and joy and power;\r\n    O Life divine, that owns each waiting hour;\r\n    Thou Love that guards the nestling’s faltering flight! [20]\r\n    Keep Thou my child on upward wing to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidst the falling leaves of old-time faiths, above the\r\nfrozen crust of creed and dogma, the divine Mind-force,\r\nfilling all space and having all power, upheaves the earth.\r\nIn sacred solitude divine Science evolved nature as thought, [25]\r\nand thought as things. This supreme potential Principle\r\nreigns in the realm of the real, and is “God with us,”\r\nthe I AM.\r\n\r\nAs mortals awake from their dream of material sen-\r\nsation, this adorable, all-inclusive God, and all earth’s [30]\r\nhieroglyphics of Love, are understood; and infinite Mind\r\n\r\n[Page 332.]\r\n\r\nis seen kindling the stars, rolling the worlds, reflecting [1]\r\nall space and Life,—but not life in matter. Wisely\r\ngoverning, informing the universe, this Mind is Truth,—\r\nnot laws of matter. Infinitely just, merciful, and wise,\r\nthis Mind is Love,—but not fallible love. [5]\r\n\r\nSpring is here! and doors that closed on Christian\r\nScience in “the long winter of our discontent,” are open\r\nflung. Its seedtime has come to enrich earth and en-\r\nrobe man in righteousness; may its sober-suited autumn\r\nfollow with hues of heaven, ripened sheaves, and harvest [10]\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Where Art Thou?”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the allegory of Genesis, third chapter and ninth\r\nverse, two mortals, walking in the cool of the day midst\r\nthe stately palms, many-hued blossoms, perfume-laden [15]\r\nbreezes, and crystal streams of the Orient, pondered the\r\nthings of man and God.\r\n\r\nA sense of evil is supposed to have spoken, been listened\r\nto, and afterwards to have formed an evil sense that\r\nblinded the eyes of reason, masked with deformity the [20]\r\nglories of revelation, and shamed the face of mortals.\r\n\r\nWhat was this sense? Error versus Truth: first, a\r\nsupposition; second, a false belief; third, suffering;\r\nfourth, death.\r\n\r\nIs man the supposer, false believer, sufferer? [25]\r\n\r\nNot man, but a mortal—the antipode of immortal\r\nman. Supposing, false believing, suffering are not fac-\r\nulties of Mind, but are qualities of error.\r\n\r\nThe supposition is, that God and His idea are not all-\r\npower; that there is something besides Him; that this [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 333.]\r\n\r\nsomething is intelligent matter; that sin—yea, self- [1]\r\nhood—is apart from God, where pleasure and pain,\r\ngood and evil, life and death, commingle, and are for-\r\never at strife; even that every ray of Truth, of infinity,\r\nomnipotence, omnipresence, goodness, could be absorbed [5]\r\nin error! God cannot be obscured, and this renders error\r\na palpable falsity, yea, nothingness; on the basis that\r\nblack is not a color because it absorbs all the rays of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe “Alpha and Omega” of Christian Science voices [10]\r\nthis question: Where do we hold intelligence to be? Is\r\nit in both evil and good, in matter as well as Spirit?\r\nIf so, we are literally and practically denying that God,\r\ngood, is supreme, _all_ power and presence, and are turn-\r\ning away from the only living and true God, to “lords [15]\r\nmany and gods many.”\r\n\r\nWhere art thou, O mortal! who turnest away from\r\nthe divine source of being,—calling on matter to work\r\nout the problem of Mind, to aid in understanding and\r\nsecuring the sweet harmonies of Spirit that relate to the [20]\r\nuniverse, including man?\r\n\r\nPaul asked: “What communion hath light with dark-\r\nness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial?” The\r\nworshippers of Baal worshipped the sun. They believed\r\nthat something besides God had authority and power, [25]\r\ncould heal and bless; that God wrought through matter\r\n—by means of that which does not reflect Him in a single\r\nquality or quantity!—the grand realities of Mind, thus\r\nto exemplify the power of Truth and Love.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Chaldee hung his destiny out upon the [30]\r\nheavens; but ancient or modern Christians, instructed in\r\ndivine Science, know that the prophet better understood\r\n\r\n[Page 334.]\r\n\r\nHim who said: “He doeth according to His will in the [1]\r\narmy of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth;\r\nand none can stay His hand, or say unto Him, What doest\r\nThou?”\r\n\r\nAstrology is well in its place, but this place is second- [5]\r\nary. Necromancy has no foundation,—in fact, no\r\nintelligence; and the belief that it has, deceives itself.\r\nWhatever simulates power and Truth in matter, does this\r\nas a lie declaring itself, that mortals’ faith in matter may\r\nhave the effect of power; but when the whole fabrication [10]\r\nis found to be a lie, away goes all its supposed power and\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nWhy do Christian Scientists treat disease _as_ disease,\r\nsince there is no disease?\r\n\r\nThis is done only as one gives the lie to a lie; because [15]\r\nit is a lie, without one word of Truth in it. You must\r\nfind error to be _nothing_: then, and _only_ then, do you\r\nhandle it in Science. The diabolism of suppositional\r\nevil at work in the name of good, is a lie of the highest\r\ndegree of nothingness: just reduce this falsity to its proper [20]\r\ndenomination, and you have done with it.\r\n\r\nHow shall we treat a negation, or error—by means\r\nof matter, or Mind? Is matter Truth? No! Then it\r\ncannot antidote error.\r\n\r\nCan belief destroy belief? No: understanding is re- [25]\r\nquired to do this. By the substitution of Truth demon-\r\nstrated, Science remedies the ills of material beliefs.\r\n\r\nBecause I have uncovered evil, and dis-covered for\r\nyou divine Science, which saith, “Be not overcome of\r\nevil, but overcome evil with good,” and you have not\r\nloved sufficiently to understand this Golden Rule and\r\ndemonstrate the might of perfect Love that casteth out\r\n\r\n[Page 335.]\r\n\r\nall fear, shall you turn away from this divine Principle [1]\r\nto graven images? Remember the Scripture:—\r\n\r\n“But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart,\r\nMy lord delayeth his coming;”\r\n\r\n“And shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to [5]\r\neat and drink with the drunken;\r\n\r\n“The lord of that servant shall come in a day when\r\nhe looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not\r\naware of,\r\n\r\n“And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his por- [10]\r\ntion with the hypocrites.”\r\n\r\nOne mercilessly assails me for opposing the subtle lie,\r\nothers charge upon me with full-fledged invective for, as\r\nthey say, having too much charity; but neither moves\r\nme from the path made luminous by divine Love. [15]\r\n\r\nIn my public works I lay bare the ability, in belief, of\r\nevil to break the Decalogue,—to murder, steal, commit\r\nadultery, and so on. Those who deny my wisdom or\r\nright to expose error, are either willing participants in\r\nwrong, afraid of its supposed power, or ignorant of it. [20]\r\n\r\nThe notion that one is covering iniquity by asserting\r\nits nothingness, is a fault of zealots, who, like Peter,\r\nsleep when the Watcher bids them watch, and when the\r\nhour of trial comes would cut off somebody’s ears. Such\r\npeople say, “Would you have me get out of a burning [25]\r\nhouse, or stay in it?”\r\n\r\nI would have you already out, and _know_ that you are\r\nout; also, to remember the Scripture concerning those\r\nwho do evil that good may come,—“whose damnation\r\nis just;” and that whoso departeth from divine Science, [30]\r\nseeking power or good aside from God, has done himself\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n[Page 336.]\r\n\r\nMind is supreme: Love is the master of hate; Truth, [1]\r\nthe victor over a lie. Hath not Science voiced this les-\r\nson to you,—that evil is powerless, that a lie is never\r\ntrue? It is your province to wrestle with error, to handle\r\nthe serpent and bruise its head; but you cannot, as a [5]\r\nChristian Scientist, resort to stones and clubs,—yea, to\r\nmatter,—to kill the serpent of a material mind.\r\n\r\nDo you love that which represents God most, His highest\r\nidea as seen to-day? No!\r\n\r\nThen you would hate Jesus if you saw him personally, [10]\r\nand knew your right obligations towards him. He would\r\ninsist on the rule and demonstration of divine Science:\r\neven that you first cast out your own dislike and hatred\r\nof God’s idea,—the beam in your own eye that hinders\r\nyour seeing clearly how to cast the mote of evil out of [15]\r\nother eyes. You cannot demonstrate the Principle of\r\nChristian Science and not love its idea: we gather not\r\ngrapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles.\r\n\r\nWhere art thou?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivine Science\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it but another name for Christian Science, [21]\r\nthe cognomen of all true religion, the quintessence of\r\nChristianity, that heals disease and sin and destroys\r\ndeath! Part and parcel of Truth and Love, wherever\r\none ray of its effulgence looks in upon the heart, behold [25]\r\na better man, woman, or child.\r\n\r\nScience is the fiat of divine intelligence, which, hoary\r\nwith eternity, touches time only to take away its frailty.\r\nThat it rests on everlasting foundations, the sequence\r\nproves. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 337.]\r\n\r\nHave I discovered and founded at this period Chris- [1]\r\ntian Science, that which reveals the truth of Love,—is\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nAnd how can you be certain of so momentous an\r\naffirmative? By proving its effect on yourself to be— [5]\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Principle and rule of Christian Science?\r\n\r\nInfinite query! Wonder in heaven and on earth,—\r\nwho shall say? The immaculate Son of the Blessed\r\nhas spoken of them as the Golden Rule and its Principle, [10]\r\nGod who is Love. Listen, and _he_ illustrates the rule:\r\n“Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the\r\nmidst of them, and said,... Whosoever ... shall\r\nhumble himself as this little child, the same is greatest\r\nin the kingdom of heaven.” [15]\r\n\r\nHarmony is heaven. Science brings out harmony;\r\nbut this harmony is not understood unless it produces a\r\ngrowing affection for all good, and consequent disaffec-\r\ntion for all evil, hypocrisy, evil-speaking, lust, envy, hate.\r\nWhere these exist, Christian Science has no sure foot- [20]\r\nhold: they obscure its divine element, and thus seem\r\nto extinguish it. Even the life of Jesus was belittled\r\nand belied by personalities possessing these defacing de-\r\nformities. Only the devout Marys, and such as lived\r\naccording to his precepts, understood the concrete char- [25]\r\nacter of him who taught—by the wayside, in humble\r\nhomes, to itching ears and to dull disciples—the words\r\nof Life.\r\n\r\nThe ineffable Life and light which he reflected through\r\ndivine Science is again reproduced in the character which [30]\r\nsensualism, as heretofore, would hide or besmear. Sin\r\nof any sort tends to hide from an individual this grand\r\n\r\n[Page 338.]\r\n\r\nverity in Science, that the appearing of good in an in- [1]\r\ndividual involves the disappearing of evil. He who first\r\nbrings to humanity some great good, must have gained\r\nits height beforehand, to be able to lift others toward\r\nit. I first proved to myself, not by “words,”—these [5]\r\nafford no proof,—but by demonstration of Christian\r\nScience, that its Principle is divine. All must go and do\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nFaith illumined by works; the spiritual understanding\r\nwhich cannot choose but to labor and love; hope hold- [10]\r\ning steadfastly to good in the midst of seething evil;\r\ncharity that suffereth long and is kind, but cancels not\r\nsin until it be destroyed,—these afford the only rule I\r\nhave found which demonstrates Christian Science.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, a pure faith in humanity will subject [15]\r\none to deception; the uses of good, to abuses from evil;\r\nand calm strength will enrage evil. But the very heavens\r\nshall laugh at them, and move majestically to your defense\r\nwhen the armies of earth press hard upon you.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Thou must be true thyself, [20]\r\n      If thou the truth wouldst teach;\r\n    Thy soul must overflow, if thou\r\n      Another’s soul wouldst reach;\r\n    It needs the overflow of heart,\r\n      To give the lips full speech.” [25]\r\n\r\n    “Think truly, and thy thoughts\r\n      Shall the world’s famine feed;\r\n    Speak truly, and each word of thine\r\n      Shall be a fruitful seed;\r\n    Live truly, and thy life shall be [30]\r\n      A great and noble creed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 339.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFidelity\r\n\r\n\r\nIf people would confine their talk to subjects that are [2]\r\nprofitable, that which St. John informs us took place\r\nonce in heaven, would happen very frequently on earth,—\r\nsilence for the space of half an hour. [5]\r\n\r\nExperience is victor, never the vanquished; and out\r\nof defeat comes the secret of victory. That to-morrow\r\nstarts from to-day and is one day beyond it, robes the\r\nfuture with hope’s rainbow hues.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of life, good is made more industrious [10]\r\nand persistent because of the supposed activity of evil.\r\nThe elbowing of the crowd plants our feet more firmly.\r\nIn the mental collisions of mortals and the strain of in-\r\ntellectual wrestlings, moral tension is tested, and, if it\r\nyields not, grows stronger. The past admonishes us: [15]\r\nwith finger grim and cold it points to every mortal mistake;\r\nor smiling saith, “Thou hast been faithful over a few\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nArt thou a child, and hast added one furrow to the\r\nbrow of care? Art thou a husband, and hast pierced [20]\r\nthe heart venturing its all of happiness to thy keeping?\r\nArt thou a wife, and hast bowed the o’erburdened head\r\nof thy husband? Hast thou a friend, and forgettest to be\r\ngrateful? Remember, that for all this thou alone canst\r\nand must atone. Carelessly or remorselessly thou mayest [25]\r\nhave sent along the ocean of events a wave that will some\r\ntime flood thy memory, surge dolefully at the door of con-\r\nscience, and pour forth the unavailing tear.\r\n\r\nChange and the grave may part us; the wisdom that\r\nmight have blessed the past may come too late. One [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 340.]\r\n\r\nbackward step, one relinquishment of right in an evil [1]\r\nhour, one faithless tarrying, has torn the laurel from many\r\na brow and repose from many a heart. Good is never\r\nthe reward of evil, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThere is no excellence without labor; and the time to [5]\r\nwork, is _now_. Only by persistent, unremitting, straight-\r\nforward toil; by turning neither to the right nor to the\r\nleft, seeking no other pursuit or pleasure than that which\r\ncometh from God, can you win and wear the crown of the\r\nfaithful. [10]\r\n\r\nThat law-school is not at fault which sends forth a\r\nbarrister who never brings out a brief. Why? Because\r\nhe followed agriculture instead of litigation, forsook\r\nBlackstone for gray stone, dug into soils instead of delv-\r\ning into suits, raised potatoes instead of pleas, and drew [15]\r\nup logs instead of leases. He has not been faithful over\r\na few things.\r\n\r\nIs a musician made by his teacher? He makes him-\r\nself a musician by practising what he was taught. The\r\nconscientious are successful. They follow faithfully; [20]\r\nthrough evil or through good report, they work on to the\r\nachievement of good; by patience, they inherit the prom-\r\nise. Be active, and, however slow, thy success is sure:\r\ntoil is triumph; and—thou hast been faithful over a few\r\nthings. [25]\r\n\r\nThe lives of great men and women are miracles of pa-\r\ntience and perseverance. Every luminary in the constel-\r\nlation of human greatness, like the stars, comes out in\r\nthe darkness to shine with the reflected light of God.\r\n\r\nMaterial philosophy, human ethics, scholastic theology, [30]\r\nand physics have not sufficiently enlightened mankind.\r\nHuman wrong, sickness, sin, and death still appear in\r\n\r\n[Page 341.]\r\n\r\nmortal belief, and they never bring out the right action [1]\r\nof mind or body. When will the whole human race have\r\none God,—an undivided affection that leaves the unreal\r\nmaterial basis of things, for the spiritual foundation and\r\nsuperstructure that is real, right, and eternal? [5]\r\n\r\nFirst purify thought, then put thought into words,\r\nand words into deeds; and after much slipping and\r\nclambering, you will go up the scale of Science to the\r\nsecond rule, and be made ruler over many things. Fidelity\r\nfinds its reward and its strength in exalted purpose. Seek- [10]\r\ning is not sufficient whereby to arrive at the results of\r\nScience: you must strive; and the glory of the strife\r\ncomes of honesty and humility.\r\n\r\nDo human hopes deceive? is joy a trembler? Then,\r\nweary pilgrim, unloose the latchet of thy sandals; for the [15]\r\nplace whereon thou standest is sacred. By that, you may\r\nknow you are parting with a material sense of life and\r\nhappiness to win the spiritual sense of good. O learn to\r\nlose with God! and you find Life eternal: you gain all.\r\nTo doubt this is implicit treason to divine decree. [20]\r\n\r\nThe parable of “the ten virgins” serves to illustrate\r\nthe evil of inaction and delay. This parable is drawn\r\nfrom the sad history of Vesta,—a little girl of eight\r\nyears, who takes the most solemn vow of celibacy for thirty\r\nyears, and is subject to terrible torture if the lamp she [25]\r\ntends is not replenished with oil day and night, so that the\r\nflame never expires. The moral of the parable is pointed,\r\nand the diction purely Oriental.\r\n\r\nWe learn from this parable that neither the cares of\r\nthis world nor the so-called pleasures or pains of mate- [30]\r\nrial sense are adequate to plead for the neglect of spiritual\r\nlight, that must be tended to keep aglow the flame of\r\n\r\n[Page 342.]\r\n\r\ndevotion whereby to enter into the joy of divine Science [1]\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe foolish virgins had no oil in their lamps: their\r\nway was material; thus they were in doubt and dark-\r\nness. They heeded not their sloth, their fading warmth [5]\r\nof action; hence the steady decline of spiritual light,\r\nuntil, the midnight gloom upon them, they must borrow\r\nthe better-tended lamps of the faithful. By entering\r\nthe guest-chamber of Truth, and beholding the bridal\r\nof Life and Love, they would be wedded to a higher [10]\r\nunderstanding of God. Each moment’s fair expect-\r\nancy was to behold the bridegroom, the One “altogether\r\nlovely.”\r\n\r\nIt was midnight: darkness profound brooded over\r\nearth’s lazy sleepers. With no oil in their lamps, no [15]\r\nspiritual illumination to look upon him whom they had\r\npierced, they heard the shout, “The bridegroom cometh!”\r\nBut how could they behold him? Hear that human\r\ncry: “Oh, lend us your oil! our lamps have gone out,—\r\nno light! earth’s fables flee, and heaven is afar [20]\r\noff.”\r\n\r\nThe door is shut. The wise virgins had no oil to spare,\r\nand they said to the foolish, “Go to them that sell, and\r\nbuy for yourselves.” Seek Truth, and pursue it. It should\r\ncost you something: you are willing to pay for error [25]\r\nand receive nothing in return; but if you pay the price of\r\nTruth, you shall receive _all_.\r\n\r\n“The children of this world are in their generation\r\nwiser than the children of light;” they watch the market,\r\nacquaint themselves with the etiquette of the exchange, [30]\r\nand are ready for the next move. How much more should\r\nwe be faithful over the few things of Spirit, that are able\r\n\r\n[Page 343.]\r\n\r\nto make us wise unto salvation! Let us watch and pray [1]\r\nthat we enter not into the temptation of ease in sin; and\r\nlet us not forget that others before us have laid upon the\r\naltar all that we have to sacrifice, and have passed to\r\ntheir reward. Too soon we cannot turn from disease [5]\r\nin the body to find disease in the mortal mind, and its cure,\r\nin working for God. Thought must be made better, and\r\nhuman life more fruitful, for the divine energy to move\r\nit onward and upward.\r\n\r\nWarmed by the sunshine of Truth, watered by the [10]\r\nheavenly dews of Love, the fruits of Christian Science\r\nspring upward, and away from the sordid soil of self and\r\nmatter. Are we clearing the gardens of thought by up-\r\nrooting the noxious weeds of passion, malice, envy, and\r\nstrife? Are we picking away the cold, hard pebbles of [15]\r\nselfishness, uncovering the secrets of sin and burnishing\r\nanew the hidden gems of Love, that their pure perfection\r\nshall appear? Are we feeling the vernal freshness and\r\nsunshine of enlightened faith?\r\n\r\nThe weeds of mortal mind are not always destroyed [20]\r\nby the first uprooting; they reappear, like devastating\r\nwitch-grass, to choke the coming clover. O stupid gar-\r\ndener! watch their reappearing, and tear them away from\r\ntheir native soil, until no seedling be left to propagate—\r\nand rot.\r\n\r\nAmong the manifold soft chimes that will fill the haunted [25]\r\nchambers of memory, this is the sweetest: “Thou hast\r\nbeen faithful!”\r\n\r\n[Page 344.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Philosophy And Communion\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related of Justin Martyr that, hearing of a Pythag- [2]\r\norean professor of ethics, he expressed the wish to be-\r\ncome one of his disciples. “Very well,” the teacher\r\nreplied; “but have you studied music, astronomy, and [5]\r\ngeometry, and do you think it possible for you to under-\r\nstand aught of that which leads to bliss, without hav-\r\ning mastered the sciences that disengage the soul from\r\nobjects of sense, so rendering it a fit habitation for\r\nthe intelligences?” On Justin’s confessing that he had [10]\r\nnot studied those branches, he was dismissed by the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nAlas for such a material science of life! Of what\r\navail would geometry be to a poor sinner struggling with\r\ntemptation, or to a man with the smallpox? [15]\r\n\r\nAncient and modern philosophies are spoiled by lack\r\nof Science. They would place Soul wholly inside of body,\r\nintelligence in matter; and from error of premise would\r\nseek a correct conclusion. Such philosophy can never\r\ndemonstrate the Science of Life,—the Science which [20]\r\nPaul understood when he spoke of willingness “to be\r\nabsent from the body, and present with the Lord.” Such\r\nphilosophy is far from the rules of the mighty Nazarene\r\nProphet. His words, living in our hearts, were these:\r\n“Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as [25]\r\na little child, shall in no wise enter therein.” Not through\r\nastronomy did he point out the way to heaven and the\r\nreign of harmony.\r\n\r\nWe need the spirit of St. Paul, when he stood on Mars’\r\nhill at Athens, bringing Christianity for the first time [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 345.]\r\n\r\ninto Europe. The Spirit bestows spiritual gifts, God’s [1]\r\npresence and providence. St. Paul stood where Socrates\r\nhad stood four hundred years before, defending himself\r\nagainst the charge of atheism; in the place where De-\r\nmosthenes had pleaded for freedom in immortal strains [5]\r\nof eloquence.\r\n\r\nWe need the spirit of the pious Polycarp, who, when\r\nthe proconsul said to him, “I will set the beasts upon\r\nyou, unless you yield your religion,” replied: “Let them\r\ncome; I cannot change from good to bad.” Then they [10]\r\nbound him to the stake, set fire to the fagots, and his\r\npure and strong faith rose higher through the baptism\r\nof flame.\r\n\r\nMethinks the infidel was blind who said, “Christianity\r\nis fit only for women and weak men;” but even infidels [15]\r\nmay disagree. Bonaparte declared, “Ever since the\r\nreign of Christianity began the loftiest intellects have had\r\na practical faith in God.” Daniel Webster said, “My\r\nheart has always assured and reassured me that Chris-\r\ntianity must be a divine reality.” [20]\r\n\r\nTo turn the popular indignation against an advanced\r\nform of religion, the pagan slanderers affirmed that\r\nChristians took their infants to a place of worship in\r\norder to offer them in sacrifice,—a baptism not of\r\nwater but of blood, thus distorting or misapprehending [25]\r\nthe purpose of Christian sacraments. Christians met\r\nin midnight feasts in the early days, and talked of the\r\ncrucified Saviour; thence arose the rumor that it was\r\na part of Christian worship to kill and eat a human\r\nbeing. [30]\r\n\r\nReally, Christianity turned men away from the thought\r\nof fleshly sacrifice, and directed them to spiritual attain-\r\n\r\n[Page 346.]\r\n\r\nments. Life, not death, was and is the very centre of [1]\r\nits faith. Christian Science carries this thought even\r\nhigher, and insists on the demonstration of moral and\r\nspiritual healing as eminent proof that God is understood\r\nand illustrated. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin Of Evil\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of evil is the problem of ages. It confronts\r\neach generation anew. It confronts Christian Science.\r\nThe question is often asked, If God created only the\r\ngood, whence comes the evil? [10]\r\n\r\nTo this question Christian Science replies: Evil never\r\ndid exist as an entity. It is but a belief that there is an\r\nopposite intelligence to God. This belief is a species of\r\nidolatry, and is not more true or real than that an image\r\ngraven on wood or stone is God. [15]\r\n\r\nThe mortal admission of the reality of evil perpetuates\r\nfaith in evil; and the Scriptures declare that “to whom\r\nye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye\r\nare.” This leading, self-evident proposition of Christian\r\nScience, that, good being real, its opposite is necessarily [20]\r\nunreal, needs to be grasped in all its divine requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruth Versus Error\r\n\r\n\r\n“A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures\r\nof silver.” It is a rule in Christian Science never to re-\r\npeat error unless it becomes requisite to bring out Truth. [25]\r\nThen lift the curtain, let in the light, and countermand\r\n\r\n[Page 347.]\r\n\r\nthis first command of Solomon, “Answer not a fool accord- [1]\r\ning to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him,”\r\n\r\nA distant rumbling and quivering of the earth foretell\r\nthe internal action of pent-up gas. To avoid danger from\r\nthis source people have to escape from their houses to the [5]\r\nopen space. A conical cloud, hanging like a horoscope\r\nin the air, foreshadows a cyclone. To escape from this\r\ncalamity people prepare shelter in caves of the earth.\r\n\r\nThey who discern the face of the skies cannot always\r\ndiscern the mental signs of these times, and peer through [10]\r\nthe opaque error. Where my vision begins and is clear,\r\ntheirs grows indistinct and ends.\r\n\r\nThere are diversities of operation by the same spirit.\r\nTwo individuals, with all the goodness of generous na-\r\ntures, advise me. One says, Go this way; the other [15]\r\nsays, Take the opposite direction! Between the two I\r\nstand still; or, accepting the premonition of one of them,\r\nI follow his counsel, take a few steps, then halt. A true\r\nsense not unfamiliar has been awakened. I see the way\r\nnow. The guardians of His presence go before me. I [20]\r\nenter the path. It may be smooth, or it may be rugged;\r\nbut it is always straight and narrow; and if it be up-\r\nhill all the way, the ascent is easy and the summit can\r\nbe gained.\r\n\r\nGod is responsible for the mission of those whom He [25]\r\nhas anointed. Those who know no will but His take\r\nHis hand, and from the night He leads to light. None\r\ncan say unto Him, What doest Thou?\r\n\r\n_The Christian Science Journal_ was the oldest and\r\nonly authenticated organ of Christian Science up to [30]\r\n1898. Loyal Scientists are targets for envy, rivalry,\r\nslander; and whoever hits this mark is well paid by the\r\n\r\n[Page 348.]\r\n\r\numpire. But the Scientists aim highest. They press for- [1]\r\nward towards the mark of a high calling. They recog-\r\nnize the claims of the law and the gospel. They know\r\nthat whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap. They\r\ninfringe neither the books nor the business of others; and [5]\r\nwith hearts overflowing with love for God, they help on the\r\nbrotherhood of men. It is not _mine_ but _Thine_ they seek.\r\n\r\nWhen God bids one uncover iniquity, in order to\r\nexterminate it, one should lay it bare; and divine Love\r\nwill bless this endeavor and those whom it reaches. [10]\r\n“Nothing is hid that shall not be revealed.”\r\n\r\nIt is only a question of time when God shall reveal His\r\nrod, and show the plan of battle. Error, left to itself,\r\naccumulates. Hence, Solomon’s transverse command:\r\n“Answer a fool according, to his folly, lest he be wise in [15]\r\nhis own conceit.”\r\n\r\nTo quench the growing flames of falsehood, once in\r\nabout seven years I have to repeat this,—that I use no\r\ndrugs whatever, not even coffea (coffee), thea (tea), cap-\r\nsicum (red pepper); though every day, and especially at [20]\r\ndinner, I indulge in homœopathic doses of _Natrum muri-_\r\n_aticum_ (common salt).\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself under this new _régime_ of medi-\r\ncine, the medicine of Mind, I wanted to satisfy my curi-\r\nosity as to the effect of drugs on one who had lost all [25]\r\nfaith in them. Hence I tried several doses of medicine,\r\nand so proved to myself that drugs have no beneficial\r\neffect on an individual in a proper state of mind.\r\n\r\nI have by no means encouraged students of the Massa-\r\nchusetts Metaphysical College to enter medical schools, [30]\r\nand afterwards denied this and objected to their entering\r\nthose schools. A student who consulted me on this sub-\r\n\r\n[Page 349.]\r\n\r\nject, received my consent and even the offer of pecuniary [1]\r\nassistance to take lessons outside of my College, provided\r\nhe received these lessons of a certain regular-school physi-\r\ncian, whose instructions included about twelve lessons,\r\nthree weeks’ time, and the surgical part of midwifery. I [5]\r\nhave students with the degree of M. D., who are skilful\r\nobstetricians. Such a course with such a teacher would\r\nnot necessitate essential materialization of a student’s\r\nthought, nor detract from the metaphysical mode of\r\nobstetrics taught in my College. [10]\r\n\r\nThis student had taken the above-named course in\r\nobstetrics when he consulted me on the feasibility of enter-\r\ning a medical school; and to this I objected on the ground\r\nthat it was inconsistent with Christian Science, which he\r\nclaimed to be practising; but I was willing, and said [15]\r\nso, that, notwithstanding my objection, he should do as\r\nhe deemed best, for I claim no jurisdiction over any stu-\r\ndents. He entered the medical school, and several other\r\nstudents with him. My counsel to all of them was in\r\nsubstance the same as the foregoing, and some of these [20]\r\nstudents have openly acknowledged this.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question on the following subject, I\r\nwill state that I preached four years, and built up the\r\nchurch, before I would accept the slightest remuneration.\r\nWhen the church had sufficient members and means to [25]\r\npay a salary, and refused to give me up or to receive my\r\ngratuitous services, I accepted, for a time, fifteen dollars\r\neach Sunday when I preached. I never received more\r\nthan this; and the contributions, when I preached,\r\ndoubled that amount. I have accepted no pay from my [30]\r\nchurch for about three years, and believe that I have\r\nput into the church-fund about two thousand dollars of\r\n\r\n[Page 350.]\r\n\r\nmy own contributions. I hold receipts for $1,489.50 paid [1]\r\nin, and the balance was never receipted for.\r\n\r\nI temporarily organized a secret society known as the\r\nP. M., the workings whereof were not “terrible and too\r\nshocking to relate.” By and with advice of the very [5]\r\nstudent who brings up the question of this society, it\r\nwas formed. The P. M. (Private Meeting) Society met\r\nonly twice. The first subject given out for considera-\r\ntion was this: “There is no Animal Magnetism.” There\r\nwas no advice given, no mental work, and there were [10]\r\nno transactions at those meetings which I would hesitate\r\nto have known. On the contrary, our deliberations\r\nwere, as usual, Christian, and like my public instruction.\r\nThe second P. M. convened in about one week from the\r\nfirst. The subject given out at that meeting was, in sub- [15]\r\nstance, “God is All; there is none beside Him.” This\r\nproved to be our last meeting. I dissolved the society,\r\nand we have not met since. If harm could come from\r\nthe consideration of these two topics, it was because of\r\nthe misconception of those subjects in the mind that [20]\r\nhandled them. An individual state of mind sometimes\r\noccasions effects on patients which are not in harmony\r\nwith Science and the soundness of the argument used.\r\nHence it prevents the normal action, and the benefit that would otherwise\r\n            accrue. [25]\r\n\r\nI issue no arguments, and cause none to be used in\r\nmental practice, which consign people to suffering. On\r\nthe contrary, I cannot serve two masters; therefore I\r\nteach the use of such arguments only as promote health\r\nand spiritual growth. My life, consecrated to humanity [30]\r\nthrough nameless suffering and sacrifice, furnishes its\r\nown proof of my practice.\r\n\r\n[Page 351.]\r\n\r\nI have sometimes called on students to test their ability [1]\r\nand meet the mental malpractice, so as to lift the burdens\r\nimposed by students.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that for want of time, and for the purpose\r\nof blessing even my enemies, I neglect myself. I never [5]\r\nhave practised by arguments which, perverted, are the\r\nweapons of the silent mental malpractice. I have no skill\r\nin occultism; and I could not if I would, and would not\r\nif I could, harm any one through the mental method of\r\nMind-healing, or in any manner. [10]\r\n\r\nThe late much-ado-about-nothing arose solely from\r\nmental malicious practice, and the audible falsehood\r\ndesigned to stir up strife between brethren, for the purpose\r\nof placing Christian Science in the hands of aspirants\r\nfor place and power. These repeated attempts of mad [15]\r\nambition may retard our Cause, but they never can place\r\nit in the wrong hands and hold it there, nor benefit\r\nmankind by such endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFallibility Of Human Concepts\r\n\r\n\r\nEvil counterfeits good: it says, “I am Truth,” though [20]\r\nit is a lie; it says, “I am Love,”—but Love is spirit-\r\nual, and sensuous love is material, wherefore it is hate\r\ninstead of Love; for the five senses give to mortals pain,\r\nsickness, sin, and death,—pleasure that is false, life that\r\nleads unto death, joy that becomes sorrow. Love that is [25]\r\nnot the procurator of happiness, declares itself the anti-\r\npode of Love; and Love divine punishes the joys of this\r\nfalse sense of love, chastens its affection, purifies it, and\r\nturns it into the opposite channels.\r\n\r\nMaterial life is the antipode of spiritual life; it mocks [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 352.]\r\n\r\nthe bliss of spiritual being; it is bereft of permanence and [1]\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nWhen human sense is quickened to behold aright the\r\nerror,—the error of regarding Life, Truth, Love as\r\nmaterial and not spiritual, or as both material and spirit- [5]\r\nual,—it is able for the first time to discern the Science\r\nof good. But it must first see the error of its present\r\nerroneous course, to be able to behold the facts of Truth\r\noutside of the error; and, _vice versa_, when it discovers\r\nthe truth, this uncovers the error and quickens the true [10]\r\nconsciousness of God, good. May the human shadows of\r\nthought lengthen as they approach the light, until they\r\nare lost in light and no night is there!\r\n\r\nIn Science, sickness is healed upon the same Principle\r\nand by the same rule that sin is healed. To know the [15]\r\nsupposed bodily belief of the patient and what has claimed\r\nto produce it, enables the practitioner to act more under-\r\nstandingly in destroying this belief. Thus it is in heal-\r\ning the moral sickness; the malicious mental operation\r\nmust be understood in order to enable one to destroy [20]\r\nit and its effects. There is not sufficient spiritual power\r\nin the human thought to heal the sick or the sinful.\r\nThrough the divine energies alone one must either get\r\nout of himself and into God so far that his consciousness\r\nis the reflection of the divine, or he must, through argu- [25]\r\nment and the human consciousness of both evil and good,\r\novercome evil.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the healing of sin and the\r\nhealing of sickness is, that sin must be _un_covered before\r\nit can be destroyed, and the moral sense be aroused to [30]\r\nreject the sense of error; while sickness must be cov-\r\nered with the veil of harmony, and the consciousness be\r\n\r\n[Page 353.]\r\n\r\nallowed to rejoice in the sense that it has nothing to mourn [1]\r\nover, but something to forget.\r\n\r\nHuman concepts run in extremes; they are like the\r\naction of sickness, which is either an excess of action or\r\nnot action enough; they are fallible; they are neither [5]\r\nstandards nor models.\r\n\r\nIf one asks me, Is my concept of you right? I reply, The\r\nhuman concept is always imperfect; relinquish your human\r\nconcept of me, or of any one, and find the divine, and you\r\nhave gained the right one—and never until then. People [10]\r\ngive me too much attention of the misguided, fallible sort,\r\nand this misrepresents one through malice or ignorance.\r\n\r\nMy brother was a manufacturer; and one day a work-\r\nman in his mills, a practical joker, set a man who applied\r\nfor work, in the overseer’s absence, to pour a bucket of [15]\r\nwater every ten minutes on the regulator. When my\r\nbrother returned and saw it, he said to the jester, “You\r\nmust pay that man.” Some people try to tend folks, as\r\nif they should steer the regulator of mankind. God makes\r\n_us_ pay for tending the action that He adjusts. [20]\r\n\r\nThe regulator is governed by the principle that makes\r\nthe machinery work rightly; and because it _is_ thus gov-\r\nerned, the folly of tending it is no mere jest. The divine\r\nPrinciple carries on His harmony.\r\n\r\nNow turn from the metaphor of the mill to the Mother’s [25]\r\nfour thousand children, most of whom, at about three\r\nyears of scientific age, set up housekeeping alone. Certain\r\nstudents, being too much interested in themselves to think\r\nof helping others, go their way. They do not love Mother,\r\nbut pretend to; they constantly go to her for help, interrupt [30]\r\nthe home-harmony, criticise and disobey her; then “return\r\nto their vomit,”—world worship, pleasure seeking, and\r\n\r\n[Page 354.]\r\n\r\nsense indulgence,—meantime declaring they “never dis- [1]\r\nobey Mother”! It exceeds my conception of human\r\nnature. Sin in its very nature is marvellous! Who but a\r\nmoral idiot, sanguine of success in sin, can steal, and lie\r\nand lie, and lead the innocent to doom? History needs it, [5]\r\nand it has the grandeur of the loyal, self-forgetful, faith-\r\nful Christian Scientists to overbalance this foul stuff.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mother’s love can no longer promote peace\r\nin the family, wisdom is not “justified of her children.”\r\nWhen depraved reason is preferred to revelation, error [10]\r\nto Truth, and evil to good, and sense seams sounder than\r\nSoul, the children are tending the regulator; they are\r\nindeed losing the knowledge of the divine Principle and\r\nrules of Christian Science, whose fruits prove the nature\r\nof their source. A little more grace, a motive made pure, [15]\r\na few truths tenderly told, a heart softened, a character\r\nsubdued, a life consecrated, would restore the right action\r\nof the mental mechanism, and make manifest the move-\r\nment of body and soul in accord with God.\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on the Principle of all that really [20]\r\nexists,—to govern His own creation,—self-conceit, igno-\r\nrance, and pride would regulate God’s action. Expe-\r\nrience shows that humility is the first step in Christian\r\nScience, wherein all is controlled, not by man or laws\r\nmaterial, but by wisdom, Truth, and Love. [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Go gaze on the eagle, his eye on the sun,\r\n    Fast gathering strength for a flight well begun,\r\n    As rising he rests in a liberty higher\r\n    Than genius inflated with worldly desire.\r\n\r\n    No tear dims his eye, nor his pinions lose power [30]\r\n    To gaze on the lark in her emerald bower—\r\n    Whenever he soareth to fashion his nest,\r\n    No vision more bright than the dream in his breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 355.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Way\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present stage of progress in Christian Science pre- [2]\r\nsents two opposite aspects,—a full-orbed promise, and\r\na gaunt want. The need, however, is not of the letter,\r\nbut the spirit. [5]\r\n\r\nLess teaching and good healing is to-day the acme of\r\n“well done;” a healing that is not guesswork,—chronic\r\nrecovery ebbing and flowing,—but instantaneous cure.\r\nThis absolute demonstration of Science must be revived.\r\nTo consummate this _desideratum_, mortal mind must pass [10]\r\nthrough three stages of growth.\r\n\r\nFirst, self-knowledge. The physician must know him-\r\nself and understand the mental state of his patient. Error\r\nfound out is two-thirds destroyed, and the last third\r\npierces itself, for the remainder only stimulates and gives [15]\r\nscope to higher demonstration. To strike out right and\r\nleft against the mist, never clears the vision; but to lift\r\nyour head above it, is a sovereign panacea. Mental dark-\r\nness is senseless error, neither intelligence nor power, and\r\nits victim is responsible for its supposititious presence. [20]\r\n“Cast the beam out of thine own eye.” Learn what in\r\nthine own mentality is unlike “the anointed,” and cast\r\nit out; then thou wilt discern the error in thy patient’s\r\nmind that makes his body sick, and remove it, and rest\r\nlike the dove from the deluge. [25]\r\n\r\n“Physician, heal thyself.” Let no clouds of sin gather\r\nand fall in mist and showers from thine own mental\r\natmosphere. Hold thy gaze to the light, and the iris of\r\nfaith, more beautiful than the rainbow seen from my\r\nwindow at the close of a balmy autumnal day, will span [30]\r\nthy heavens of thought.\r\n\r\n[Page 356.]\r\n\r\nA radiant sunset, beautiful as blessings when they take [1]\r\ntheir flight, dilates and kindles into rest. Thus will a\r\nlife corrected illumine its own atmosphere with spiritual\r\nglow and understanding.\r\n\r\nThe pent-up elements of mortal mind need no terrible [5]\r\ndetonation to free them. Envy, rivalry, hate need no\r\ntemporary indulgence that they be destroyed through\r\nsuffering; they should be stifled from lack of air and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nMy students, with cultured intellects, chastened affec- [10]\r\ntions, and costly hopes, give promise of grand careers.\r\nBut they must remember that the seedtime is passed,\r\nthe harvest hour has come; and songs should ascend\r\nfrom the mount of revelation, sweeter than the sound of\r\nvintage bells. [15]\r\n\r\nThe seed of Christian Science, which when sown was\r\n“the least of all seeds,” has sprung up, borne fruit, and\r\nthe birds of the air, the uplifted desires of the human\r\nheart, have lodged in its branches. Now let my faithful\r\nstudents carry the fruit of this tree into the rock-ribbed [20]\r\nnests of the raven’s callow brood.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of mental development is humility.\r\nThis virtue triumphs over the flesh; it is the genius of\r\nChristian Science. One can never go up, until one has\r\ngone down in his own esteem. Humility is lens and [25]\r\nprism to the understanding of Mind-healing; it must be\r\nhad to understand our textbook; it is indispensable to\r\npersonal growth, and points out the chart of its divine\r\nPrinciple and rule of practice.\r\n\r\nCherish humility, “watch,” and “pray without ceasing,” [30]\r\nor you will miss the way of Truth and Love. Humility\r\nis no busybody: it has no moments for trafficking\r\n\r\n[Page 357.]\r\n\r\nin other people’s business, no place for envy, no time for [1]\r\nidle words, vain amusements, and all the _et cetera_ of the\r\nways and means of personal sense.\r\n\r\nLet Christian Scientists minister to the sick; the school-\r\nroom is the _dernier ressort_. Let them seek the lost sheep [5]\r\nwho, having strayed from the true fold, have lost their\r\ngreat Shepherd and yearn to find living pastures and\r\nrest beside still waters. These long for the Christlike-\r\nness that is above the present status of religion and be-\r\nyond the walks of common life, quite on the verge of [10]\r\nheaven. Without the cross and healing, Christianity has\r\nno central emblem, no history.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Truth fall by the wayside, on artless\r\nlisteners. They fall on stony ground and shallow soil.\r\nThe fowls of the air pick them up. Much of what has [15]\r\nbeen sown has withered away, but what remaineth has\r\nfallen into the good and honest hearts and is bearing\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of mental growth is manifested in _love_,\r\nthe greatest of all stages and states of being; love that [20]\r\nis irrespective of self, rank, or following. For some time\r\nit has been clear to my thought that those students of\r\nChristian Science whose Christian characters and lives\r\nrecommend them, should receive full fellowship from us,\r\nno matter who has taught them. If they have been taught [25]\r\nwrongly, they are not morally responsible for this, and\r\nneed special help. They are as lambs that have sought\r\nthe true fold and the great Shepherd, and strayed inno-\r\ncently; hence we should be ready and glad to help them\r\nand point the way. [30]\r\n\r\nDivine Love is the substance of Christian Science, the\r\nbasis of its demonstration, yea, its foundation and super-\r\n\r\n[Page 358.]\r\n\r\nstructure. Love impels good works. Love is greatly [1]\r\nneeded, and must be had to mark the way in divine\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nThe student who heals by teaching and teaches by\r\nhealing, will graduate under divine honors, which are [5]\r\nthe only appropriate seals for Christian Science. State\r\nhonors perish, and their gain is loss to the Christian\r\nScientist. They include for him at present naught but\r\ntardy justice, hounded footsteps, false laurels. God\r\nalone is his help, his shield and great reward. He that [10]\r\nseeketh aught besides God, loseth in Life, Truth, and\r\nLove. All men shall be satisfied when they “awake in\r\nHis likeness,” and they never should be until then. Hu-\r\nman pride is human weakness. Self-knowledge, humility,\r\nand love are divine strength. Christ’s vestures are put [15]\r\non only when mortals are “washed in the blood of the\r\nLamb;” we must walk in the way which Jesus marked\r\nout, if we would reach the heaven-crowned summit of\r\nChristian Science.\r\n\r\nBe it understood that I do not require Christian Sci- [20]\r\nentists to stop teaching, to dissolve their organizations,\r\nor to desist from organizing churches and associations.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Metaphysical College, the first\r\nand only College for teaching Christian Science Mind-\r\nhealing, after accomplishing the greatest work of the [25]\r\nages, and at the pinnacle of prosperity, is closed. Let\r\nScientists who have grown to self-sacrifice do their\r\npresent work, awaiting, with staff in hand, God’s\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nWhen students have fulfilled all the good ends of [30]\r\norganization, and are convinced that by leaving the\r\nmaterial forms thereof a higher spiritual unity is won,\r\n\r\n[Page 359.]\r\n\r\nthen is the time to follow the example of the _Alma Mater_. [1]\r\nMaterial organization is requisite in the beginning; but\r\nwhen it has done its work, the purely Christly method\r\nof teaching and preaching must be adopted. On the same\r\nprinciple, you continue the mental argument in the prac- [5]\r\ntice of Christian healing until you can cure without it\r\ninstantaneously, and through Spirit alone.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul says: “When I was a child, I spake as a\r\nchild, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but\r\nwhen I became a man, I put away childish things. For [10]\r\nnow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to\r\nface.” Growth is restricted by forcing humanity out of\r\nthe proper channels for development, or by holding it in\r\nfetters.\r\n\r\nFor Jesus to walk the water was scientific, insomuch [15]\r\nas he was able to do this; but it is neither wisdom nor\r\nScience for poor humanity to step upon the Atlantic until\r\nwe can walk on the water.\r\n\r\nPeter’s impetuosity was rebuked. He had to learn\r\nfrom experience; so have we. The methods of our [20]\r\nMaster were in advance of the period in which he per-\r\nsonally appeared; but his example was right, and is\r\navailable at the right time. The _way_ is absolute divine\r\nScience: walk ye in it; but remember that Science is\r\ndemonstrated by degrees, and our demonstration rises [25]\r\nonly as we rise in the scale of being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScience And Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nMen give counsel; but they give not the wisdom to\r\nprofit by it. To ask wisdom of God, is the beginning of\r\nwisdom. [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 360.]\r\n\r\nMeekness, moderating human desire, inspires wisdom [1]\r\nand procures divine power. Human lives are yet un-\r\ncarved,—in the rough marble, encumbered with crude,\r\nrude fragments, and awaiting the hammering, chiselling,\r\nand transfiguration from His hand. [5]\r\n\r\nGreat only as good, because fashioned divinely, were\r\nthose unpretentious yet colossal characters, Paul and\r\nJesus. Theirs were modes of mind cast in the moulds\r\nof Christian Science: Paul’s, by the supremely natural\r\ntransforming power of Truth; and the character of [10]\r\nJesus, by his original scientific sonship with God. Phi-\r\nlosophy never has produced, nor can it reproduce, these\r\nstars of the first magnitude—fixed stars in the heavens\r\nof Soul. When shall earth be crowned with the true\r\nknowledge of Christ? [15]\r\n\r\nWhen Christian Science has melted away the cloud of\r\nfalse witnesses; and the dews of divine grace, fall-\r\ning upon the blighted flowers of fleeting joys, shall\r\nlift every thought-leaflet Spiritward; and “Israel after\r\nthe flesh,” who partaketh of its own altars, shall be [20]\r\nno more,—then, “the Israel according to Spirit”\r\nshall fill earth with the divine energies, understanding,\r\nand ever-flowing tides of spiritual sensation and consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen mortal mind is silenced by the “still, small voice” [25]\r\nof Truth that regenerates philosophy and logic; and\r\nJesus, as the true idea of Him, is heard as of yore saying\r\nto sensitive ears and dark disciples, “I came from the\r\nFather,” “Before Abraham was, I am,” coexistent and\r\ncoeternal with God,—and this idea is understood,— [30]\r\nthen will the earth be filled with the true knowledge of\r\nChrist. No advancing modes of human mind made\r\n\r\n[Page 361.]\r\n\r\nJesus; rather was it their subjugation, and the pure [1]\r\nheart that sees God.\r\n\r\nWhen the belief in material origin, mortal mind, sen-\r\nsual conception, dissolves through self-imposed suffering,\r\nand its substances are found substanceless,—then its [5]\r\nmiscalled life ends in death, and death itself is swallowed\r\nup in Life,—spiritual Life, whose myriad forms are\r\nneither material nor mortal.\r\n\r\nWhen every form and mode of evil disappear to hu-\r\nman thought, and mollusk and radiate are spiritual con- [10]\r\ncepts testifying to one creator,—then, earth is full of\r\nHis glory, and Christian Science has overshadowed all\r\nhuman philosophy, and being is understood in startling\r\ncontradiction of human hypotheses; and Socrates, Plato,\r\nKant, Locke, Berkeley, Tyndall, Darwin, and Spencer [15]\r\nsit at the feet of Jesus.\r\n\r\nTo this great end, Paul admonished, “Let us lay aside\r\nevery weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us,\r\nand let us run with patience the race that is set before\r\nus, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our [20]\r\nfaith.” So shall mortals soar to final freedom, and rest\r\nfrom the subtlety of speculative wisdom and human\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nGod is the only Mind, and His manifestation is the\r\nspiritual universe, including man and all eternal indi- [25]\r\nviduality. God, the only substance and divine Principle\r\nof creation, is by no means a creative partner in the firm\r\nof error, named matter, or mortal mind. He elucidates\r\nHis own idea, wherein Principle and idea, God and man,\r\nare not one, but are inseparable as cause and effect. If [30]\r\none, who could say which that “one” was?\r\n\r\nHis ways are not as our ways. The divine modes\r\n\r\n[Page 362.]\r\n\r\nand manifestations are not those of the material senses; [1]\r\nfor instance, intelligent matter, or mortal mind, material\r\nbirth, growth, and decay: they are the forever-existing\r\nrealities of divine Science; wherein God and man are\r\nperfect, and man’s reason is at rest in God’s wisdom,— [5]\r\nwho comprehends and reflects all real mode, form, indi-\r\nviduality, identity.\r\n\r\nScholastic dogma has made men blind. Christ’s _logos_\r\ngives sight to these blind, ears to these deaf, feet to these\r\nlame,—physically, morally, spiritually. Theologians [10]\r\nmake the mortal mistake of believing that God, having\r\nmade _all_, made evil; but the Scriptures declare that all\r\nthat He made was good. Then, was evil part and parcel\r\nof His creation?\r\n\r\nPhilosophy hypothetically regards creation as its own [15]\r\ncreator, puts cause into effect, and out of nothing would\r\ncreate something, whose noumenon is mortal mind,\r\nwith its phenomenon matter,—an evil mind already\r\ndoomed, whose modes are material manifestations of\r\nevil, and that continually, until self-extinguished by [20]\r\nsuffering!\r\n\r\nHere revelation must come to the rescue of mortals,\r\nto remove this mental millstone that is dragging them\r\ndownward, and refute erring reason with the spiritual\r\ncosmos and Science of Soul. We all must find shelter [25]\r\nfrom the storm and tempest in the tabernacle of Spirit.\r\nTruth is won through Science or suffering: O vain mor-\r\ntals! which shall it be? And suffering has no reward,\r\nexcept when it is necessary to prevent sin or reform\r\nthe sinner. And pleasure is no crime except when it [30]\r\nstrengthens the influence of bad inclinations or lessens\r\nthe activities of virtue. The more nearly an erring so-\r\n\r\n[Page 363.]\r\n\r\ncalled mind approaches purity, the more conscious it [1]\r\nbecomes of its own unreality, and of the great reality of\r\ndivine Mind and true happiness.\r\n\r\nThe “ego” that claims selfhood in error, and passes\r\nfrom molecule and monkey up to man, is no ego, but is [5]\r\nsimply the supposition that the absence of good is mind\r\nand makes men,—when its greatest flatterer, identifica-\r\ntion, is piqued by Him who compensateth vanity with\r\nnothingness, dust with dust!\r\n\r\nThe mythology of evil and mortality is but the ma- [10]\r\nterial mode of a suppositional mind; while the immortal\r\nmodes of Mind are spiritual, and pass through none of\r\nthe changes of matter, or evil. Truth said, and said from\r\nthe beginning, “Let us [Spirit] make man perfect;” and\r\nthere is no other Maker: a perfect man would not desire [15]\r\nto make himself imperfect, and God is not chargeable\r\nwith imperfection. His modes declare the beauty of holi-\r\nness, and His manifold wisdom shines through the visible\r\nworld in glimpses of the eternal verities. Even through\r\nthe mists of mortality is seen the brightness of His [20]\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nWe must avoid the shoals of a sensual religion or\r\nphilosophy that misguides reason and affection, and\r\nhold fast to the Principle of Christian Science as the\r\nWord that _is_ God, Spirit, and Truth. This Word cor- [25]\r\nrects the philosopher, confutes the astronomer, exposes\r\nthe subtle sophist, and drives diviners mad. The Bible\r\nis the learned man’s masterpiece, the ignorant man’s\r\ndictionary, the wise man’s directory.\r\n\r\nI foresee and foresay that every advancing epoch of so [30]\r\nTruth will be characterized by a more spiritual appre-\r\nhension of the Scriptures, that will show their marked\r\n\r\n[Page 364.]\r\n\r\nconsonance with the textbook of Christian Science Mind- [1]\r\nhealing, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.”\r\nInterpreting the Word in the “new tongue,” whereby\r\nthe sick are healed, naturally evokes new paraphrase\r\nfrom the world of letters. “Wait patiently on the Lord, [5]\r\nand He will renew your strength.” In return for indi-\r\nvidual sacrifice, what a recompense to have healed, through\r\nTruth, the sick and sinful, made the public your friend,\r\nand posterity your familiar!\r\n\r\nChristian Science refutes everything that is not a [10]\r\npostulate of the divine Principle, God. It is the soul of\r\ndivine philosophy, and there is no other philosophy. It\r\nis not a search after wisdom, it _is_ wisdom: it is God’s\r\nright hand grasping the universe,—all time, space,\r\nimmortality, thought, extension, cause, and effect; con- [15]\r\nstituting and governing all identity, individuality, law,\r\nand power. It stands on this Scriptural platform:\r\nthat He made all that was made, and it is good, reflects\r\nthe divine Mind, is governed by it; and that nothing\r\napart from this Mind, one God, is self-created or evolves [20]\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nHuman hypotheses predicate matter of Spirit and\r\nevil of good; hence these opposites must either cooperate\r\nor quarrel throughout time and eternity,—or until\r\nthis impossible partnership is dissolved. If Spirit is the [25]\r\nlawgiver to matter, and good has the same power or\r\nmodes as evil, it has the same consciousness, and there\r\nis no absolute good. This error, carried to its ultimate,\r\nwould either extinguish God and His modes, or give\r\nreality and power to evil _ad infinitum_. [30]\r\n\r\nChristian Science rends this veil of the temple of gods,\r\nand reproduces the divine philosophy of Jesus and Paul.\r\n\r\n[Page 365.]\r\n\r\nThis philosophy alone will bear the strain of time and [1]\r\nbring out the glories of eternity; for “other founda-\r\ntion can no man lay than that is laid,” which is Christ,\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nHuman theories weighed in the balances of God are [5]\r\nfound wanting; and their highest endeavors are to Science\r\nwhat a child’s love of pictures is to art. The school whose\r\nschoolmaster is not Christ, gets things wrong, and is ignorant\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nIf Christian Science lacked the proof of its goodness [10]\r\nand utility, it would destroy itself; for it rests alone on\r\ndemonstration. Its genius is right thinking and right\r\nacting, physical and moral harmony; and the secret of\r\nits success lies in supplying the universal need of better\r\nhealth and better men. [15]\r\n\r\nGood health and a more spiritual religion form the\r\ncommon want, and this want has worked out a moral\r\nresult; namely, that mortal mind is calling for what im-\r\nmortal Mind alone can supply. If the uniform moral\r\nand spiritual, as well as physical, effects of divine Science [20]\r\nwere lacking, the demand would diminish; but it con-\r\ntinues, and increases, which shows the real value of\r\nChristian Science to the race. Even doctors agree that\r\ninfidelity, bigotry, or sham has never met the growing\r\nwants of humanity. [25]\r\n\r\nAs a literature, Christian metaphysics is hampered by\r\nlack of proper terms in which to express what it means.\r\nAs a Science, it is held back by the common ignorance\r\nof what it is and of what it does,—and more than all\r\nelse, by the impostors that come in its name. To be [30]\r\nappreciated, it must be conscientiously understood and\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Page 366.]\r\n\r\nIf the Bible and “Science and Health with Key to the [1]\r\nScriptures” had in our schools the time or attention that\r\nhuman hypotheses consume, they would advance the\r\nworld. True, it requires more study to understand and\r\ndemonstrate what they teach than to learn the doctrine [5]\r\nof theology, philosophy, or physics, because they con-\r\ntain and offer Science, with fixed Principle, given rule,\r\nand unmistakable proof.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures give the keynote of Christian Science\r\nfrom Genesis to Revelation, and this is the prolonged [10]\r\ntone: “For the Lord He is God, and there is\r\n_none beside Him_.” And because He is All-in-all,\r\nHe is in nothing unlike Himself; and nothing that\r\nworketh or maketh a lie is in Him, or can be divine con-\r\nsciousness. [15]\r\n\r\nAt this date, poor jaded humanity needs to get her\r\neyes open to a new style of imposition in the field of\r\nmedicine and of religion, and to “beware of the leaven\r\nof the scribes and Pharisees,” the doctrines of men, even\r\nas Jesus admonished. From first to last, evil insists on [20]\r\nthe unity of good and evil as the purpose of God; and\r\non drugs, electricity, and animal magnetism as modes\r\nof medicine. To a greater or less extent, all mortal conclusions\r\nstart from this false premise, and they necessarily\r\nculminate in sickness, sin, disease, and death. [25]\r\nErroneous doctrines never have abated and never will\r\nabate dishonesty, self-will, envy, and lust. To destroy\r\nsin and its sequence, is the office of Christ, Truth,—ac-\r\ncording to His mode of Christian Science; and this is\r\nbeing done daily. [30]\r\n\r\nThe false theories whose names are legion, gilded with\r\nsophistry and what Jesus had not, namely, mere book-\r\n\r\n[Page 367.]\r\n\r\nlearning,—letter without law, gospel, or demonstration, [1]\r\n—have no place in Christian Science. This Science re-\r\nquires man to be honest, just, pure; to love his neighbor\r\nas himself, and to love God supremely.\r\n\r\nMatter and evil are subjective states of error or mortal [5]\r\nmind. But Mind is immortal; and the fact of there\r\nbeing no mortal mind, exposes the lie of suppositional\r\nevil, showing that error is not Mind, substance, or\r\nLife. Thus, whatever is wrongfully-minded will dis-\r\nappear in the proportion that Science is understood, [10]\r\nand the reality of being—goodness and harmony—is\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nError says that knowing all things implies the neces-\r\nsity of knowing evil, that it dishonors God to claim that\r\nHe is ignorant of anything; but God says of this fruit [15]\r\nof the tree of knowledge of _both_ good and evil, “In the\r\nday that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.” If\r\nGod is infinite good, He knows nothing but good; if He\r\ndid know aught else, He would not be infinite. Infinite\r\nMind knows nothing beyond Himself or Herself. To [20]\r\ngood, evil is never present; for evil is a different state of\r\nconsciousness. It was not against evil, but against _know-_\r\n_ing_ evil, that God forewarned. He dwelleth in light;\r\nand in the light He sees light, and cannot see darkness.\r\nThe opposite conclusion, that darkness dwelleth in light, [25]\r\nhas neither precedent nor foundation in nature, in logic,\r\nor in the character of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe senses would say that whatever saves from sin,\r\nmust know sin. Truth replies that God is too pure\r\nto behold iniquity; and by virtue of His ignorance of [30]\r\nthat which is not, He knoweth that which _is_, and\r\nabideth in Himself, the only Life, Truth, and Love,\r\n\r\n[Page 368.]\r\n\r\n—and is reflected by a universe in His own image [1]\r\nand likeness.\r\n\r\nEven so, Father, let the light that shineth in dark-\r\nness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not, dispel this\r\nillusion of the senses, open the eyes of the blind, and cause [5]\r\nthe deaf to hear.\r\n\r\n“Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne.\r\nYet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,\r\nStandeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.”\r\n                    LOWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Take Heed!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe regret to be obliged to say that all are not meta-\r\nphysicians, or Christian Scientists, who call themselves\r\nso. Charlatanism, fraud, and malice are getting into\r\nthe ranks of the good and pure, sending forth a poison [15]\r\nmore deadly than the upas-tree in the eastern archi-\r\npelago. This evil obtains in the present false teaching\r\nand false practice of the Science of treating disease through\r\nMind. The silent address of a mental malpractitioner\r\ncan only be portrayed in these words of the apostle, [20]\r\n“whisperers,” and “the poison of asps is under their\r\ntongue.”\r\n\r\nSome of the mere puppets of the hour are playing\r\nonly for money, and at a fearful stake. Others, from\r\nmalice and envy, are working out the destinies of the [25]\r\ndamned. But while the best, perverted, on the mortal\r\nplane may become the worst, let us not forget that the\r\nLord reigns, and that this earth shall some time rejoice\r\nin His supreme rule,—that the tired watchmen on the\r\n\r\n[Page 369.]\r\n\r\nwalls of Zion, and the true Christian Scientist at the foot [1]\r\nof the mount of revelation, shall look up with shouts and\r\nthanksgiving,—that God’s law, as in divine Science,\r\nshall be finally understood; and the gospel of glad tidings\r\nbring “on earth peace, good will toward men.” [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cry Of Christmas-Tide\r\n\r\n\r\nMetaphysics, not physics, enables us to stand erect\r\non sublime heights, surveying the immeasurable universe\r\nof Mind, peering into the cause which governs all effects,\r\nwhile we are strong in the unity of God and man. There [10]\r\nis “method” in the “madness” of this system,—since\r\nmadness it seems to many onlookers. This method sits\r\nserene at the portals of the temple of thought, while\r\nthe leaders of materialistic schools indulge in mad\r\nantics. Metaphysical healing seeks a wisdom that is [15]\r\nhigher than a rhubarb tincture or an ipecacuanha pill.\r\nThis method is devout enough to trust Christ more than\r\nit does drugs.\r\n\r\nMeekly we kneel at our Master’s feet, for even a crumb\r\nthat falleth from his table. We are hungry for Love, [20]\r\nfor the white-winged charity that heals and saves; we\r\nare tired of theoretic husks,—as tired as was the prodi-\r\ngal son of the carobs which he shared with the swine,\r\nto whom he fed that wholesome but unattractive food.\r\nLike him, we would find our Father’s house again— [25]\r\nthe perfect and eternal Principle of man. We thirst\r\nfor inspiring wine from the vine which our Father tends.\r\nWe crave the privilege of saying to the sick, when their\r\n\r\n[Page 370.]\r\n\r\nfeebleness calls for help, “Rise and walk.” We rejoice [1]\r\nto say, in the spirit of our Master, “Stretch forth thy\r\nhand, and be whole!”\r\n\r\nWhen the Pharisees saw Jesus do such deeds of mercy,\r\nthey went away and took counsel how they might remove [5]\r\nhim. The antagonistic spirit of evil is still abroad; but\r\nthe greater spirit of Christ is also abroad,—risen from\r\nthe grave-clothes of tradition and the cave of ignorance.\r\nLet the sentinels of Zion’s watch-towers shout once\r\nagain, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is [10]\r\ngiven.”\r\n\r\nIn different ages the divine idea assumes different\r\nforms, according to humanity’s needs. In this age it\r\nassumes, more intelligently than ever before, the form\r\nof Christian healing. This is the babe we are to cherish. [15]\r\nThis is the babe that twines its loving arms about the\r\nneck of omnipotence, and calls forth infinite care from\r\nHis loving heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlind Leaders\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat figure is less favorable than a wolf in sheep’s [20]\r\nclothing? The braying donkey whose ears stick out is\r\nless troublesome. What manner of man is it that has\r\ndiscovered an improvement on Christian Science, a “met-\r\naphysical healing” by which error destroys error, and\r\nwould gather all sorts into a “national convention” by [25]\r\nthe sophistry that such is the true fold for Christian heal-\r\ners, since the good shepherd cares for all?\r\n\r\nYes; the _good_ Shepherd does care for all, and His\r\nfirst care is to separate the sheep from the goats; and\r\n\r\n[Page 371.]\r\n\r\nthis is among the first lessons on healing taught by our [1]\r\ngreat Master.\r\n\r\nIf, as the gentleman aforesaid states, large flocks of\r\nmetaphysicians are wandering about without a leader,\r\nwhat has opened his eyes to see the need of taking them [5]\r\nout of the care of the great Shepherd, and behold the\r\nremedy, to help them by his own leadership? Is it that\r\nhe can guide Christian Scientists better than they, through\r\nthe guidance of our common Father, can guide them-\r\nselves? or is it that they are incapable of helping them- [10]\r\nselves thus?\r\n\r\nI as their teacher can say, They know far more of\r\nChristian Science than he who deprecates their condition\r\nappears to, and my heart pleads for them to possess\r\nmore and more of Truth and Love; but mixing all grades [15]\r\nof persons is not productive of the better sort, although\r\nhe who has self-interest in this mixing is apt to pro-\r\npose it.\r\n\r\nWhoever desires to say, “good right, and good wrong,”\r\nhas no truth to defend. It is a wise saying that “men [20]\r\nare known by their enemies.” To sympathize in any\r\ndegree with error, is not to rectify it; but error always\r\nstrives to unite, in a definition of purpose, with Truth,\r\nto give it buoyancy. What is under the mask, but error\r\nin borrowed plumes? [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Christ And Christmas”\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Illustrated Poem\r\n\r\nThis poem and its illustrations are as hopelessly origi-\r\nnal as is “Science and Health with Key to the Scrip-\r\n\r\n[Page 372.]\r\n\r\ntures.” When the latter was first issued, critics declared [1]\r\nthat it was incorrect, contradictory, unscientific, unchris-\r\ntian; but those human opinions had not one feather’s\r\nweight in the scales of God. The fact remains, that\r\nthe textbook of Christian Science is transforming the [5]\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n“Christ and Christmas” voices Christian Science\r\nthrough song and object-lesson. In two weeks from the\r\ndate of its publication in December, 1893, letters extoll-\r\ning it were pouring in from artists and poets. A mother [10]\r\nwrote, “Looking at the pictures in your wonderful book\r\nhas healed my child.”\r\n\r\nKnowing that this book would produce a stir, I sought\r\nthe judgment of sound critics familiar with the works\r\nof masters in France and Italy. From them came such [15]\r\nreplies as the following: “The illustrations of your poem\r\nare truly a work of art, and the artist seems quite familiar\r\nwith delineations from the old masters.” I am delighted\r\nto find “Christ and Christmas” in accord with the\r\nancient and most distinguished artists. [20]\r\n\r\n_The Christian Science Journal_ gives no uncertain dec-\r\nlaration concerning the spirit and mission of “Christ and\r\nChristmas.”\r\n\r\nI aimed to reproduce, with reverent touch, the modest\r\nglory of divine Science. Not by aid of foreign device [25]\r\nor environment could I copy art,—never having seen\r\nthe painter’s masterpieces; but the _art_ of Christian\r\nScience, with true hue and character of the living God,\r\nis akin to its _Science_: and Science and Health gives\r\nscopes and shades to the shadows of divinity, thus im- [30]\r\nparting to humanity the true sense of meekness and\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n[Page 373.]\r\n\r\nOne incident serves to illustrate the simple nature of [1]\r\nart.\r\n\r\nI insisted upon placing the serpent behind the woman\r\nin the picture “Seeking and Finding.” My artist at the\r\neasel objected, as he often did, to my sense of Soul’s [5]\r\nexpression through the brush; but, as usual, he finally\r\nyielded. A few days afterward, the following from Roth-\r\nerham’s translation of the New Testament was handed\r\nto me,—I had never before seen it: “And the serpent\r\ncast out of his mouth, _behind_ the woman, water as a [10]\r\nriver, that he might cause her to be river-borne.” Neither\r\nmaterial finesse, standpoint, nor perspective guides the\r\ninfinite Mind and spiritual vision that should, does, guide\r\nHis children.\r\n\r\nOne great master clearly delineates Christ’s appear- [15]\r\ning in the flesh, and his healing power, as clad not in\r\nsoft raiment or gorgeous apparel; and when forced out\r\nof its proper channel, as living feebly, in kings’ courts.\r\nThis master’s thought presents a sketch of Christian-\r\nity’s state, in the early part of the Christian era, as [20]\r\nhomelessness in a wilderness. But in due time Chris-\r\ntianity entered into synagogues, and, as St. Mark\r\nwrites, it has rich possession here, with houses and\r\nlands. In Genesis we read that God gave man do-\r\nminion over all things; and this assurance is followed [25]\r\nby Jesus’ declaration, “All power is given unto me\r\nin heaven and in earth,” and by his promise that the\r\nChristlike shall finally sit down at the right hand of the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nChristian Science is more than a prophet or a proph- [30]\r\necy: it presents not words alone, but works,—the daily\r\ndemonstration of Truth and Love. Its healing and sav-\r\n\r\n[Page 374.]\r\n\r\ning power was so great a proof of Immanuel and the [1]\r\nrealism of Christianity, that it caused even the publi-\r\ncans to justify God. Although clad in panoply of power,\r\nthe Pharisees scorned the spirit of Christ in most of its\r\nvaried manifestations. To them it was cant and carica- [5]\r\nture,—always the opposite of what it was. Keen and\r\nalert was their indignation at whatever rebuked hypocrisy\r\nand demanded Christianity in life and religion. In view\r\nof this, Jesus said, “Wisdom is justified of all her\r\nchildren.” [10]\r\n\r\nAbove the fogs of sense and storms of passion, Chris-\r\ntian Science and its art will rise triumphant; ignorance,\r\nenvy, and hatred—earth’s harmless thunder—pluck\r\nnot their heaven-born wings. Angels, with overtures,\r\nhold charge over both, and announce their Principle and [15]\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nIt is most fitting that Christian Scientists memorize\r\nthe nativity of Jesus. To him who brought a great light\r\nto all ages, and named his burdens light, homage is in-\r\ndeed due,—but is bankrupt. I never looked on my [20]\r\nideal of the face of the Nazarite Prophet; but the one\r\nillustrating my poem approximates it.\r\n\r\nExtremists in every age either doggedly deny or fran-\r\ntically affirm what is what: one renders not unto Cæsar\r\n“the things that are Cæsar’s;” the other sees “Helen’s [25]\r\nbeauty in a brow of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nPictures are portions of one’s ideal, but this ideal is\r\nnot one’s personality. Looking behind the veil, he that\r\nperceives a semblance between the thinker and his thought\r\non canvas, blames him not. [30]\r\n\r\nBecause my ideal of an angel is a woman without\r\n_feathers_ on her wings,—is it less artistic or less natu-\r\n\r\n[Page 375.]\r\n\r\nral? Pictures which present disordered phases of ma- [1]\r\nterial conceptions and personality blind with animality,\r\nare not my concepts of angels. What is the material ego,\r\nbut the counterfeit of the spiritual?\r\n\r\nThe truest art of Christian Science is to be a Chris- [5]\r\ntian Scientist; and it demands more than a Raphael to\r\ndelineate _this_ art.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter reverting to\r\nthe illustrations of “Christ and Christmas”:—\r\n\r\n“In my last letter, I did not utter all I felt about the [10]\r\nwonderful new book you have given us. Years ago,\r\nwhile in Italy, I studied the old masters and their great\r\nworks of art thoroughly, and so got quite an idea of\r\nwhat constitutes true art. Then I spent two years in\r\nParis, devoting every moment to the study of music and [15]\r\nart.\r\n\r\n“The first thing that impressed me in your illustra-\r\ntions was the conscientious application to detail, which is\r\nis the foundation of true art. From that, I went on to\r\nstudy each illustration thoroughly, and to my amazement [20]\r\nand delight I find an almost identical resemblance, in\r\nmany things, to the old masters! In other words, the art\r\nis perfect.\r\n\r\n“The hands and feet of the figures—how many times\r\nhave I seen these hands and feet in Angelico’s “Jesus,” [25]\r\nor Botticelli’s “Madonna”!\r\n\r\n“It gave me such a thrill of joy as no words can ex-\r\npress, to see produced to-day that art—the only true\r\nart—that we have identified with the old masters, and\r\nmourned as belonging to them exclusively,—a thing of [30]\r\nthe past, impossible of reproduction.\r\n\r\n“All that I can say to you, as one who gives no mean\r\n\r\n[Page 376.]\r\n\r\nattention to such matters, is that the art is perfect. It [1]\r\nis the true art of the oldest, most revered, most authen-\r\ntic Italian school, revived. I use the words _most au-_\r\n_thentic_ in the following sense: the face, figure, and\r\ndrapery of Jesus, very closely resemble in detail the [5]\r\nface, figure, and drapery of that Jesus portrayed by the\r\noldest of the old masters, and said to have been authen-\r\ntic; the face having been taken by Fra Angelico from\r\nCæsar’s Cameo, the figure and garments from a descrip-\r\ntion, in _The Galaxy_, of a small sketch handed down [10]\r\nfrom the _living reality_. _Their_ productions are expres-\r\nsionless copies of an engraving cut in a stone. _Yours_\r\nis a palpitating, living Saviour engraven on the heart.\r\nYou have given us back our Jesus, and in a much better\r\nis form.” [15]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunrise At Pleasant View\r\n\r\n\r\nWho shall describe the brave splendor of a November\r\nsky that this morning burst through the lattice for me,\r\non my bed? According to terrestrial calculations, above\r\nthe horizon, in the east, there rose one rod of rainbow [20]\r\nhues, crowned with an acre of eldritch ebony. Little\r\nby little this topmost pall, drooping over a deeply daz-\r\nzling sunlight, softened, grew gray, then gay, and glided\r\ninto a glory of mottled marvels. Fleecy, faint, fairy\r\nblue and golden flecks came out on a background of [25]\r\ncerulean hue; while the lower lines of light kindled into\r\ngold, orange, pink, crimson, violet; and diamond, topaz,\r\nopal, garnet, turquoise, and sapphire spangled the gloom\r\nin celestial space as with the brightness of His glory.\r\nThen thought I, What are we, that He who fashions for- [30]\r\n\r\n[Page 377.]\r\n\r\never such forms and hues of heaven, should move our [1]\r\nbrush or pen to paint frail fairness or to weave a web\r\nof words that glow with gladdening gleams of God, so\r\nunapproachable, and yet so near and full of radiant relief\r\nin clouds and darkness! [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. INKLINGS HISTORIC\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 378.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1862, while the author of this work [1]\r\nwas at Dr. Vail’s Hydropathic Institute in New\r\nHampshire, this occurred: A patient considered incur-\r\nable left that institution, and in a few weeks returned\r\napparently well, having been healed, as he informed [5]\r\nthe patients, by one Mr. P. P. Quimby of Portland,\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\nAfter much consultation among ourselves, and a struggle\r\nwith pride, the author, in company with several other\r\npatients, left the water-cure, _en route_ for the aforesaid [10]\r\ndoctor in Portland. He proved to be a magnetic practi-\r\ntioner. His treatment seemed at first to relieve her, but\r\nsignally failed in healing her case.\r\n\r\nHaving practised homœopathy, it never occurred to the\r\nauthor to learn his practice, but she did ask him how [15]\r\nmanipulation could benefit the sick. He answered kindly\r\nand squarely, in substance, “Because it conveys _electricity_\r\nto them.” That was the sum of what he taught her of\r\nhis medical profession.\r\n\r\nThe readers of my books cannot fail to see that meta- [20]\r\nphysical therapeutics, as in Christian Science, are farther\r\nremoved from such thoughts than the nebulous system\r\nis from the earth.\r\n\r\n[Page 379.]\r\n\r\nAfter treating his patients, Mr. Quimby would retire [1]\r\nto an anteroom and write at his desk. I had a curiosity\r\nto know if he indited anything pathological relative to\r\nhis patients, and asked if I could see his pennings on\r\nmy case. He immediately presented them. I read the [5]\r\ncopy in his presence, and returned it to him. The com-\r\nposition was commonplace, mostly descriptive of the gen-\r\neral appearance, height, and complexion of the individual,\r\nand the nature of the case: it was not at all metaphysi-\r\ncal or scientific; and from his remarks I inferred that [10]\r\nhis writings usually ran in the vein of thought presented\r\nby these. He was neither a scholar nor a metaphysician.\r\nI never heard him say that matter was not as real as Mind,\r\nor that electricity was not as potential or remedial, or\r\nallude to God as the divine Principle of all healing. He [15]\r\ncertainly had advanced views of his own, but they com-\r\nmingled error with truth, and were not Science. On\r\nhis rare humanity and sympathy one could write a\r\nsonnet.\r\n\r\nI had already experimented in medicine beyond the [20]\r\nbasis of _materia medica_,—up to the highest attenuation\r\nin homoeopathy, thence to a mental standpoint not un-\r\nderstood and with phenomenally good results;(7) mean-\r\nwhile assiduously pondering the solution of this great\r\nquestion: Is it matter, or is it Mind, that heals the [25]\r\nsick?\r\n\r\nIt was after Mr. Quimby’s death that I discovered,\r\nin 1866, the momentous facts relating to Mind and its\r\nsuperiority over matter, and named my discovery Chris-\r\ntian Science. Yet, there remained the difficulty of ad- [30]\r\njusting in the scale of Science a metaphysical _practice_,\r\n\r\n[Page 380.]\r\n\r\nand settling the question, What shall be the outward [1]\r\nsign of such a practice: if a divine Principle alone heals,\r\nwhat is the human modus for demonstrating this,—in\r\nshort, how can sinful mortals prove that a divine Principle\r\nheals the sick, as well as governs the universe, time, [5]\r\nspace, immortality, man?\r\n\r\nWhen contemplating the majesty and magnitude of\r\nthis query, it looked as if centuries of spiritual growth\r\nwere requisite to enable me to elucidate or to dem-\r\nonstrate what I had discovered: but an unlooked-for, [10]\r\nimperative call for help impelled me to begin this stu-\r\npendous work at once, and teach the first student in\r\nChristian Science. Even as when an accident, called\r\nfatal to life, had driven me to discover the Science of\r\nLife, I again, in faith, turned to divine help,—and com- [15]\r\nmenced teaching.\r\n\r\nMy students at first practised in slightly differing\r\nforms. Although _I_ could heal mentally, without a sign\r\nsave the immediate recovery of the sick, my students’\r\npatients, and people generally, called for a sign—a ma- [20]\r\nterial evidence wherewith to satisfy the sick that something\r\nwas being done for them; and I said, “Suffer it\r\nto be so now,” for thus saith our Master. Experience,\r\nhowever, taught me the impossibility of demonstrating\r\nthe Science of metaphysical healing by any outward form [25]\r\nof practice.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1883, a bill in equity was filed in the United\r\nStates Circuit Court in Boston, to restrain, by decree and\r\norder of the Court, the unlawful publishing and use of an\r\ninfringing pamphlet printed and issued by a student of [30]\r\nChristian Science.\r\n\r\nAnswer was filed by the defendant, alleging that the\r\n\r\n[Page 381.]\r\n\r\ncopyrighted works of Mrs. Eddy were not original with [1]\r\nher, but had been copied by her, or by her direction,\r\nfrom manuscripts originally composed by Dr. P. P.\r\nQuimby.\r\n\r\nTestimony was taken on the part of Mrs. Eddy, the [5]\r\ndefendant being present personally and by counsel. The\r\ntime for taking testimony on the part of the defendant\r\nhaving nearly expired, he gave notice through his counsel\r\nthat he should not put in testimony. Later, Mrs.\r\nEddy requested her lawyer to inquire of defendant’s [10]\r\ncounsel why he did not present evidence to support his\r\nclaim that Dr. Quimby was the author of her writings!\r\nAccordingly, her counsel asked the defendant’s counsel\r\nthis question, and he replied, in substance, “There is\r\nno evidence to present.” [15]\r\n\r\nThe stipulation for a judgment and a decree in favor\r\nof Mrs. Eddy was drawn up and signed by counsel.\r\nIt was ordered that the complainant (Mrs. Eddy)\r\nrecover of the defendant her cost of suit, taxed at\r\n($113.09) one hundred thirteen and 9/100 dollars. [20]\r\n\r\nA writ of injunction was issued under the seal of the\r\nsaid Court, restraining the defendant from directly or\r\nindirectly printing, publishing, selling, giving away,\r\ndistributing, or in any way or manner disposing of,\r\nthe enjoined pamphlet, on penalty of ten thousand [25]\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe infringing books, to the number of thirty-eight\r\nhundred or thereabouts, were put under the edge of\r\nthe knife, and their unlawful existence destroyed, in\r\nBoston, Massachusetts. [30]\r\n\r\nIt has been written that “nobody can be both founder\r\nand discoverer of the same thing.” If this declaration\r\n\r\n[Page 382.]\r\n\r\nwere either a truism or a rule, my experience would [1]\r\ncontradict it and prove an exception.\r\n\r\nNo works on the subject of Christian Science existed,\r\nprior to my discovery of this Science. Before the publi-\r\ncation of my first work on this doctrine, a few manu- [5]\r\nscripts of mine were in circulation. The discovery and\r\nfounding of Christian Science has cost more than thirty\r\nyears of unremitting toil and unrest; but, comparing those\r\nwith the joy of knowing that the sinner and the sick are\r\nhelped thereby, that time and eternity bear witness to [10]\r\nthis gift of God to the race, I am the debtor.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the nineteenth century I discov-\r\nered the Science of Christianity, and restored the first\r\npatient healed in this age by Christian Science. I taught\r\nthe first student in Christian Science Mind-healing; was [15]\r\nauthor and publisher of the first books on this subject;\r\nobtained the first charter for the first Christian Science\r\nchurch, originated its form of government, and was its\r\nfirst pastor. I donated to this church the land on which\r\nin 1894 was erected the first church edifice of this denomination [20]\r\nin Boston; obtained the first and only charter\r\nfor a metaphysical medical college,—was its first and\r\nonly president; was editor and proprietor of the first\r\nChristian Science periodical; organized the first Christian\r\nScientist Association, wrote its constitution and by- [25]\r\nlaws,—as also the constitution and by-laws of the\r\nNational Christian Science Association; and gave it\r\n_The Christian Science Journal_; inaugurated our denom-\r\ninational form of Sunday services, Sunday School, and\r\nso the entire system of teaching and practising Christian [30]\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 I ordained that the Bible, and “Science and\r\n\r\n[Page 383.]\r\n\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures,” the Christian Science [1]\r\ntextbook, be the pastor, on this planet, of all the churches\r\nof the Christian Science denomination. This ordinance\r\ntook effect the same year, and met with the universal ap-\r\nproval and support of Christian Scientists. Whenever [5]\r\nand wherever a church of Christian Science is established,\r\nits pastor is the Bible and my book.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 it goes without saying, preeminent over igno-\r\nrance or envy, that Christian Science _is founded by its_\r\n_discoverer_, and built upon the rock of Christ. The el- [10]\r\nements of earth beat in vain against the immortal parapets\r\nof this Science. Erect and eternal, it will go on with the\r\nages, go down the dim posterns of time unharmed, and\r\non every battle-field rise higher in the estimation of\r\nthinkers and in the hearts of Christians.

TESTIMONIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters From Those Healed By Reading “Science And Health With Key To The\r\nScriptures”\r\n\r\nThe Editor of _The Christian Science Journal_ (Falmouth and St. Paul\r\nStreets, Boston, Mass.) holds the original of most of the letters that\r\nauthenticate these.\r\n\r\nIt is something more than a year and a half since I was cured of a\r\ncomplication of diseases through reading “Science and Health with Key to\r\nthe Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nBecoming at an early age disgusted with drugs, I learned hygiene, and\r\npractised it faithfully for over twenty years; then I began to lose all\r\nfaith in its efficacy, became greatly discouraged, and, as I had never\r\nbeen cured of a single ailment, I rapidly grew worse in health. Hearing of\r\nthis, a dear sister brought me Science and Health. Her admonition was,\r\n“Now read it, E——; I have heard that just the reading of that book has\r\nbeen known to heal the sick.”\r\n\r\nI had read to, and through, the chapter on Healing and Teaching,(8) and\r\nwas so deeply interested that I began reading that blessed chapter over\r\nagain,—when I found I was cured of my dyspepsia, that I could use my\r\nstrength in lifting without feeling the old distressing pain in my side,\r\nand also that the pain in the kidneys only came on at night, waking me out\r\nof sleep. Then I began my first conscious treatments: of course I followed\r\nno formula, and I needed none. A cry for help, knowing it would be\r\nanswered; precious texts from the Bible, which had already become like a\r\nnew book to me; sweet assurance of faith by the witnessing Spirit; strong\r\nlogical conclusions, learned from Science and Health: what a wealth of\r\nmaterial! Before finishing the book, all tendency to my old aches and\r\npains had left me, and I have been a strong, healthy woman ever since.\r\n\r\nMy first demonstration with another than myself was also before I had\r\nfinished my first reading. My husband was cured of the belief of bilious\r\nfever by not over ten minutes’ treatment; the fever and pain in head and\r\nlimbs disappearing in that instantaneous way as soon as I could summon\r\nsufficient courage to offer my services in this, to us, new but glorious\r\nwork. He slept soundly that night (the treatment was given about 10 A.\r\nM.), and ate and worked as usual the next day, with no symptoms of a\r\nrelapse then or afterward. That was in March, 1888; in the following\r\nAugust I met in one of our Rocky Mountain berry patches a lady who\r\ncomplained so bitterly that I felt compelled to offer her treatment. Her\r\nwords, when I visited her at her home during Christmas week, will give\r\nsome idea of the result:—\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am doing three women’s work,—attending to my own and my son’s\r\nhousework, and caring for his wife and new-born babe; but I am equal to\r\nit, when I think of all the Lord has done for me! Why, Mrs. S., I was\r\ncured with that first treatment you gave me, I know; because I went out to\r\ngather berries that day and was caught in a drenching shower,—and for ten\r\nyears before I could not bear the least exposure without suffering from\r\nthose dreadful headaches I told you about, and from dysentery,—but that\r\nday I had neither. I had once been laid out for dead,—lying there\r\nperfectly conscious, hearing my friends grieving over me,—but I did not\r\nwant to come to, I suffered so. No, I never have any of those ailments. I\r\nam a well, hearty woman,—and that is not all. I had been seeking religion\r\nfor more than twenty years, but I never knew how Christians felt till I\r\ntold you I was cured that day on the camp-ground.”\r\n\r\nOn the first of this year I was so blessed as to receive a course of\r\nlessons from one of our teacher’s students. Now I am only trusting that\r\nthe time will come when I may be enabled to teach others the way of Truth,\r\nas well as to add to the many demonstrations God has given me.—E. D. S.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nA student of Christian Science was employed in the Massachusetts State\r\nPrison at Charlestown, to teach the prisoners to make shoes. He carried\r\nhis copy of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” and the\r\n_Journal_ with him, and as he had the opportunity would tell the men what\r\nthis wonderful truth could do for them, setting them free in a larger and\r\nhigher sense than they had dreamed of.\r\n\r\nWe make extracts from a number of letters that one of the prisoners has\r\nwritten to those who are interesting themselves in this work.\r\n\r\n“_Editor of The Christian Science Journal_:—At the prison, once a week,\r\nthere are Christian papers given to the inmates. But none of those papers\r\npoint out so clearly the fallibility of the mortal or carnal mind, and the\r\ninfallibility of the divine Mind, as does the teaching of Christian\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n“I was strangely blind and stupid. I loved sin, and it seemed as though I\r\nnever would be able to forsake it. I did everything that would be expected\r\nof one entirely ignorant of God.\r\n\r\n“I also had a complication of diseases. I could not begin to describe the\r\nmedicines I have taken.\r\n\r\n“I no longer look for material treatment, but humbly seek for the divine\r\nassistance of Jesus, through the way Christian Science has taught me. I\r\nam, indeed, an altered man. I now have no more doubt of the way of\r\nsalvation than I have of the way to the prison workshop.\r\n\r\n“I am very grateful to the students of Christian Science, for the interest\r\nthey have taken in me and my fellow-prisoners. Their letters and books\r\nhave been of great profit, and in accordance with their wish I have done\r\nwhat I could for the others.\r\n\r\n“I gave the _Journal_ to every man who would accept it, and related my\r\nexperience to those who would listen. I told them they need go no farther\r\nthan myself to see what the demonstration was; for not only have my eyes\r\nbeen healed, but many other ailments have disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Some of the fellows told me I was becoming religiously insane, but acting\r\nupon your advice, I did not stop to argue with those opposed; and I am\r\nglad to be able to tell you that those who expressed interest were more\r\nthan those who opposed.\r\n\r\n“The chaplain told me I could keep Science and Health until I got through\r\nwith it. I never should get through with that book, but, as others were\r\nwaiting for it, I did not like to keep it too long. God bless the author!\r\n\r\n“I need have no fear after leaving here; I feel that I can make an honest\r\nliving. I can honestly add, that my bad reputation is largely due to my\r\nlack of education. What little I do know, I learned here and in the House\r\nof Correction. I tell you this, for I feel that I must be honest with the\r\nkind friends who have done so much for me.\r\n\r\n“Providing I should not be paroled, I shall remain here until the 24th of\r\nnext December. God bless you all.—J. C.”\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI am glad to tell how I was healed. Beliefs of consumption, dyspepsia,\r\nneuralgia, piles, tobacco, and bad language held me in bondage for many\r\nyears. Doctors that were consulted did nothing to relieve me, and I\r\nconstantly grew worse. Nearly two years ago a lady told me that if I would\r\nread a book called “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” I would\r\nbe healed. I told her I would “go into it for all it is worth,” and I have\r\nfound that it is worth all. I got the book, and read day and night. I saw\r\nthat it must be true, and believed that what I could not then understand\r\nwould be made clear later.\r\n\r\nAfter some days’ reading I was affected with drowsiness, followed by\r\nvomiting. This lasted several hours; when I fell into a sleep, and awoke\r\nhealed. The good I have received, and that I have been able to do in\r\nhealing others, has all come from Science and Health. I received some\r\ninstructions from teachers; but they did me more harm than good: I asked\r\nfor bread, but they gave me a stone. I held to what I could understand of\r\nScience and Health; and the truth does not forsake me, but enables me to\r\nheal others.\r\n\r\nLast February, I was called to treat a child that the M. D.’s said was\r\ndying from lung fever; after the third treatment the child got up and ran\r\nabout, completely healed. Another child was brought to me, with rupture;\r\nafter the second treatment the truss was thrown away. An aged lady was\r\nhealed of heart disease and chills, in one treatment. These cases brought\r\nme many more, that were also healed.\r\n\r\nThe husband of a lady in the State Lunatic Asylum asked me to treat her;\r\nshe had been for two years and a half in the asylum, and though taken home\r\nin this time once or twice, she had had to be taken back. After two weeks\r\nof absent treatment, the husband visited her, and the doctor reported\r\ngreat improvement during the preceding two weeks. At the end of another\r\ntwo weeks I went with the husband to the asylum, and the doctor told us\r\nthat she was well enough to go home. The husband asked the doctor how it\r\nwas that she had improved so rapidly, and he said that he could not\r\naccount for it. We said nothing about the Christian Science treatment, and\r\ntook the lady home. This was about a year ago, and she has remained\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\nMany cases as striking as this can be referred to in this town, as\r\nevidence that Truth is the healer of sickness as well as of sin.—J. B. H.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nNo. 1. A lady friend, who was found to have a severe attack of dysentery,\r\nwas assured that such attacks could be cured without medicine, and advised\r\nto take no more. She was more than astonished at the result; for in less\r\nthan an hour all pain and other symptoms of the trouble ceased, and she\r\nfelt perfectly well the next day.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. While she was visiting relatives in the country, an infant of\r\ntheirs was attacked severely with croup, and appeared to be on the verge\r\nof suffocation, giving its parents much alarm. The infant was taken in the\r\narms of the lady, in thirty minutes was completely relieved, went to\r\nsleep, and awoke in good health the next morning.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. The mother of this child was subsequently attacked with a\r\nscrofulous swelling on the neck, just under the ear, which was very\r\npainful and disfiguring; the side of the face, also, being badly swollen.\r\nIt was feared that this would develop into and undergo the usual\r\nphenomenon of abscess, as other similar swellings had done previously. She\r\nhad great faith in the metaphysical treatment, because of the experience\r\nwhich she had had with her baby, and wrote a letter describing her case.\r\nThis was immediately answered, and absent treatment was begun. In\r\ntwenty-four hours after receipt of the letter, to the astonishment of\r\nherself and family, the tumor had entirely disappeared: there was not a\r\ntrace of it left; although the day before it was fully as large as a hen’s\r\negg; red, and tender to the touch.\r\n\r\nThese instances are only a few of the many cures which have been performed\r\nin this way, and they are mentioned simply to show what good work may be\r\ndone by any earnest, conscientious person who has gained by reading my\r\nworks the proper understanding of the Principle of Christian Science.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful field for enlightenment and profit lies open to those who\r\nseek after Truth. Alas, that the feet of so few enter it!\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n_Rev. M. B. G. Eddy_:—Will you kindly spare me a few moments for the\r\nperusal of these lines from a stranger,— one who feels under a debt of\r\ngratitude to you,—for, through the divine Science brought to light by you,\r\nI have been “made whole.” I have been cured of a malignant cancer since I\r\nbegan to study Christian Science, and have _demonstrated the truth_ of it\r\nin a number of cases. I have only studied your good books, having been\r\n_unable_ to take the lectures for want of means. I dare not think of\r\nthese, for there is no prospect that I shall be in a position to take the\r\ncourse at all. I do not allow myself to complain, but cheerfully take up\r\nmy books and study, and feel thankful for this light.\r\n\r\nM. E.

If you would write me what the cost would be for a course on\r\ndivine metaphysics, I would try to manage it later on.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I should be grateful if you would refer me to any one in this\r\ncountry who is interested similarly, for I get more kicks than halfpence\r\nin discussing it.\r\n\r\nYour obliged friend,\r\n\r\n(REV.)

Eddy\r\n\r\nA gentleman here had hired all the most skilled doctors in the United\r\nStates—nothing helped him. He was a ghost to look upon. I told him just to\r\nread my copies of your books. I talked to him, told him what he could do\r\nfor himself if he but tried. He laughed at me. I was willing he should\r\nlaugh, for it was very unusual for him to do this. He had your books two\r\nmonths, and last Sunday he returned them. I wish you could see him: _he is\r\nwell_. He is happy, and told me he was going to write to you for the books\r\nfor himself this week.—E. E.

It was during one of\r\nmany attacks that your book, “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” was handed me. I read it only a very short time, when I\r\narose, well, went out into the kitchen, prepared a large dinner, and ate\r\nheartily of it.\r\n\r\nI have been up and well ever since,—a marvel to my friends and family, and\r\nsometimes they can hardly believe it is I; and feeling so grateful, I must\r\ntell you of it. I wish everybody in the world would read your book, for\r\nall would be benefited by it.\r\n\r\nGratefully yours,  ANNA M.

He fitted me with glasses,\r\nwhich I wore for a considerable time, and then removed; but the pain and\r\ndifficulty returned, and I was obliged to go again to the oculist, who\r\nadvised me never to take my glasses off again.\r\n\r\nI continued wearing them for fully five years longer, until some time in\r\nlast January, when, upon reading your book, “Science and Health with Key\r\nto the Scriptures,” I again took them off. Since that time, though I have\r\nbeen in the courts reporting, and reading fine notes frequently, I have\r\nexperienced no difficulty with my eyes.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\nWilliam A.

Christian Science was our\r\nonly help two weeks ago, when our baby was born. My husband and myself\r\nwere alone. I dressed myself the next day; commenced doing my work the\r\nthird day, and am well and strong.

I heard of your book,\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” bought a copy, began\r\nreading it, and a great light seemed to break through the darkness. I\r\ncried aloud in joy, “This is what I have been hungering for, these many\r\nyears!” I studied it closely, and healed myself and several of my friends\r\nbefore I had taken instruction of any teacher.\r\n\r\nMRS.

No amount of money could buy the book of me,\r\nif I could not get another. No matter what suffering comes, physical or\r\nmental, I have only to take Science and Health, and almost invariably the\r\nfirst sentence brings relief. It seems to steady the thought. I do not\r\nthink any student old enough to neglect reading it. When we think we are\r\nadvanced far enough to let that book alone, then are we in danger.\r\n\r\nMRS. ELLEN P.

When I commenced\r\nreading them, I was carrying about a very sick body. Your books have\r\nhealed me. I am now in perfect health. People look at me with surprise,\r\nand say they do not understand it; but when they see the sick ones made\r\nwell, they are not always willing to believe it.\r\n\r\nMRS.

Eddy:_—I add one more testimony of a cure from reading your\r\nbook, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.” Five years ago I\r\nlay prostrate with piles and inflammation of the bowels. All the coating\r\ncame off, apparently. A stricture was formed, beyond medical reach. I then\r\nlived in Chicago; one of the best physicians, who made a specialty of\r\ntreating piles, attended me. The pain was relieved, but my bowels were\r\ninactive, and remained so until New Year’s eve.\r\n\r\nI determined to trust all to God, or die before I would take any more\r\nmedicine, as I never had an action unless I took a free dose of some\r\nlaxative. If I forgot to take the medicine one night, or allowed myself to\r\nbe without it, I had a terrible sick headache for two or three days, and\r\nterrible backache. I never had backache at any other time, and the piles\r\nwould be so much inflamed, in two days’ time, that I could hardly tell\r\nwhere I suffered the worst.\r\n\r\nSince I have learned to trust all to God, I have not had the least trouble\r\nwith the piles, nor one twinge of the backache. I have an easy action of\r\nthe bowels each morning. It was five days after I resolved to leave\r\nmedicine alone, before a natural movement took place; and ever since I\r\nhave been perfectly regular. It was a great effort for me to take that\r\nstep, for I knew I was running the risk of throwing myself back into all\r\nmisery, and perhaps into a worse state than before. By reading Science and\r\nHealth, I learned that God was able to save the body as well as the soul,\r\nand I believed His promises were for me.\r\n\r\nMATTIE E. MAYFIELD, Des Moines, Iowa\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nFor the Cause of Truth, I submit the following testimonial for\r\npublication; may it bring _one_ more, at least, into the fold of divine\r\nScience! The truth, as it is stated in “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” has done much towards making our home the abiding-place of\r\npeace and harmony. I now write of the wonderful demonstration of Truth\r\nover the birth of my baby boy, two weeks ago. Sunday, September 23, we\r\nwent for a long drive of three hours; at night I retired at the usual\r\nhour; toward morning I was given a little warning; when I awoke at seven\r\no’clock, the birth took place. Not more than ten minutes after, I ate a\r\nhearty breakfast, and then had a refreshing sleep; at ten o’clock walked\r\nacross the room while my bed was dressed; at twelve took a substantial\r\ndinner; most of the afternoon sat up in bed, without any support but\r\nTruth; at six in the evening dressed myself and walked to the dining-room,\r\nand remained up for two hours. Next morning I arose at the usual hour, and\r\nhave kept it up ever since,—was not confined to my bed one whole day. The\r\nsecond day was out walking in the yard, and the third day went for a drive\r\nin the morning and received callers in the afternoon. If it had not been\r\nfor the presence of my young hopeful, it would have been hard to believe\r\nthat there had so recently been a belief of a birth in the house; but\r\nthen, I was sustained by Love, and had no belief of suffering to take my\r\nstrength away. Before baby was two weeks old, I cooked, swept, ran the\r\nsewing machine, etc., assisting with the housework generally. How grateful\r\nI am for the obstetrics of this grand Science! Mothers need no longer\r\nlisten to the whispering lies of the old serpent, for the law of mortal\r\nmind is broken by Truth.\r\n\r\nMRS. DORA HOSSICK, Carrolton, Mo.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nMy wife and I have been healed by reading your book, “Science and Health\r\nwith Key to the Scriptures.” We both feel very grateful to you.\r\n\r\nFive months ago my wife gave birth to a child, without pain or\r\ninconvenience, has done all the housework since, and has been every minute\r\nperfectly well. Neither she nor the child have been ill,—as was constantly\r\nthe case with former children,—so we have thought it right to name the\r\nchild Glover Eddy.\r\n\r\nWe have been reading Science and Health nearly two years, and have sold\r\nseveral copies to others. We are reading the _Journal_ also this year.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully, JOHN B. HOUSEL, Lincoln, Neb.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n_Dear Mother:_—The most blessed of women! Oh, how I long to sit within\r\nrange of your voice and hear the truth that comes to you from on high! for\r\nnone could speak such wondrous thoughts as have come from your pen, except\r\nit be the Spirit that speaketh in you.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago last October, while laboring under a great strain of care\r\nand anxiety in regard to financial affairs, I heard of Christian Science.\r\nI borrowed “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and began to\r\nread. I bless God that I was driven to it by such an extremity. After\r\nreading some one hundred and fifty pages, I was convinced that it was the\r\ntruth for which I had searched during twenty years. While I was reading\r\nthe chapter on Imposition and Demonstration,(9) I was healed of\r\nendometritis and prolapsus uteri of over twenty years’ standing,\r\npronounced incurable by eminent physicians. Professor Ludlam, the dean of\r\nHahnemann Medical College, of Chicago, Ill., was one of my doctors.\r\n\r\nBefore I was healed, to walk seven or eight blocks would so fatigue me\r\nthat it would take me a week to recover. I now started out and walked, and\r\nwas on my feet all day and for several succeeding days, but felt no\r\nweariness from my labors.\r\n\r\nI felt, after being healed, I must have a Science and Health of my own. I\r\nhad no money to buy it, so earned it by getting subscribers for the\r\n_Journal_. It has gone with me everywhere I have been. I have been well\r\never since.\r\n\r\nI had suffered from bodily ailments, but they were nothing compared to my\r\nmental trials. Grief, hatred, jealousy, and revenge had well-nigh bereft\r\nme of reason. I had lost a home of plenty, been reduced to almost abject\r\npoverty, and had become a cheerless woman,—could not smile without feeling\r\nI had sinned.\r\n\r\nAll my griefs and sorrows are now turned to joy, and my hatred is changed\r\nto love. “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will\r\ntoward men.” I read Science and Health, and all your other books, together\r\nwith the New Testament, every minute I can get.—E. B. C., Omaha, Neb.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI must add one more to your great pile of letters, to tell you what your\r\nbook, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” has done for me and\r\nmy family. More than a year ago, my husband was suffering from an injury\r\nreceived about a year previous, and he went to Mrs. B. for treatment. His\r\nshoulder had been fractured, his collarbone broken, and he had sustained\r\ninternal injuries. Several M. D.’s had attended him, but had given him\r\nvery little relief. Mrs. B. treated him a short time, and he received much\r\nbenefit. He bought Science and Health. From reading it, I was cured of a\r\nbelief of chronic liver complaint. I suffered so much from headaches and\r\nconstipation, and other beliefs, that I seldom ever saw a well day; but,\r\nthanks to you and divine Principle, I now seldom ever have a belief of\r\nfeeling badly.\r\n\r\nNovember 4th, last, I was confined. I was alone, because I knew no one\r\nwhose thought was in harmony with Science. I thought I could get along\r\nwithout help, and I did. My little girl was sleeping in the same room with\r\nme, and after the birth she called a woman who was asleep upstairs, to\r\ntake care of the baby. This woman was much frightened; but, on seeing how\r\ncomposed I was, she got over her fright. I was sitting up in bed, holding\r\nthe child, and feeling as well as I ever did in my life. I never had seen\r\na Scientist nor been treated, but got all my ideas from Science and\r\nHealth. My baby was born on Sunday morning, and I got up Monday at noon,\r\nand stayed up. I never got along so well with a baby as I did with this\r\none.\r\n\r\nI am very thankful for the knowledge of Science I have gained through your\r\nbook. I want so much to be a Scientist; but we are very poor. My husband\r\nis a brakeman on the railroad; and I have very little education. There is\r\ncomfort in the thought that, if I can’t be a Scientist, my children may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nYours with much love, C. A. W., Lexington, Mo.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nIn the February _Journal_ it appears there is some one who says that\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” is hard to understand, and\r\nwho thinks she can explain it. Perhaps my experience with Science and\r\nHealth may help some one who might otherwise take up this thought, and so\r\nbe led away from the truth. After reading and studying it for some time,\r\nand talking to the Scientists I met in my travels, the thought came to me,\r\n“Why not try these truths on yourself?” I did so, and to my surprise and\r\ngreat joy I found immediate relief. Dyspepsia (the trouble of most\r\ncommercial travellers), catarrh, and many lesser beliefs, left me, so that\r\nin a short time I was a _well man_, and by no other means than trusting to\r\nthe Saviour’s promises as explained in Science and Health. This took place\r\nwhile I was travelling about the country.\r\n\r\nOn my return home, I gave my wife treatments. In many instances the\r\nblessing came before the treatment was finished, and often we proved that\r\nonly a thought of the power of Truth was sufficient to give relief.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning, soon after my return, a friend called and asked if I\r\ncould give him anything to relieve his wife, who, he said, had been\r\nsuffering for some days with rheumatism in her shoulder, so severely that\r\nshe could neither dress alone nor comb her hair. I told him that the only\r\nmedicine we had in the house was Christian Science. He laughed at the\r\nidea; but before he left, he asked if I would give his wife a treatment. I\r\ntold him I was very young in Science, but if she wished it, I would. He\r\nwent home, but returned immediately, saying she wished me to come. Then I\r\nasked help from the fountain of Truth, and started for my first treatment\r\nto be given away from home. When I left their room fifteen minutes later,\r\nshe was shaking her hand high above her head, and exclaiming, “I am all\r\nright; I am well!” That was in November, 1887, and she has had no return\r\nof the belief since.\r\n\r\nA friend told me that his son, twelve years old, had catarrh so badly that\r\nhis breath was very offensive, his throat troubled him all the time, and\r\nthat he had been deaf since he had the measles. In less than three weeks\r\nboth beliefs vanished. This was a case of absent treatment. I could give\r\nyou other cases, but I think I have said enough to prove that Science and\r\nHealth _is not hard to understand_, for my work has all been done without\r\nmy ever attending class.\r\n\r\nH. H. B., New York City\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nA lady, with no other instructor than “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” has demonstrated beyond many who have taken numerous lessons.\r\nPersuaded, through her reading, of the allness of God,—and the perfectness\r\nof idea,—she would know nothing else. A daughter, so badly affected by\r\npoison oak (ivy) that for weeks death was feared from blood-poisoning, had\r\nrecovered with a terrible dread of that plant. As the next season’s picnic\r\ntime drew near, she was regretting that she dared not go again. The\r\nmother, with her new-born faith in the Science of being, said, “Certainly\r\nyou can go, for nothing can harm you.” Assured by these words, the\r\ndaughter went, and in her rambles fell into a mass of the dreaded plant;\r\nbut trusting to the word of Truth, she thought nothing of it till one who\r\nknew of her previous trouble said, in her mother’s presence, “See, her\r\nface is showing red already.” But the mother was prompt in denial and\r\nassurance. Next morning, old symptoms were out in force, but they yielded\r\nat once and finally to the positive and uncompromising hold on Truth.\r\nAnother daughter, that was thought too delicate to raise, from bronchial\r\nand nervous troubles, always dosed with medicine and wrapped in flannels,\r\nnow runs free and well without either of these, winter and summer. The\r\nmother was recently attacked by mesmerism from the church that believed\r\nshe was influencing her daughter to leave. She overcame by the same\r\nunwavering trust in God, seeing Truth clearer than ever before. Her\r\ndemonstrations come through no form of treatment, but by letting the\r\nSpirit bear witness,—by the positive recognition and realization of no\r\nreality but ever-present good.\r\n\r\nThe other night her husband was attacked with an old belief, similar to\r\none that some time before had ended in a congestive chill which the doctor\r\nthought very serious, and from which he had been a long time in\r\nrecovering. The wife simply recognized no reality in the belief, and,\r\nseeing only perfect being, felt no fear. She did nothing,—no “treating” in\r\nthe usual sense. There is nothing to do but to understand that all is\r\nharmony, always. He felt the presence that destroys the sense of evil, and\r\nnext morning—there was nothing left to recover from.\r\n\r\nA lady, while doing some starching, thoughtlessly put her hand into the\r\nscalding starch to wring out a collar. Recalled to mortal sense by the\r\nstinging pain, she immediately realized the all-power of God. At once the\r\npain began to subside; and as she brushed off the scalding starch, she\r\ncould see the blister-swelling go down till there was but a little redness\r\nto show for the accident; absorbed in her thankfulness, she mechanically\r\nwrung out the collar with the same hand, and with no sense of pain, thus\r\nverifying the demonstration. This woman (not reading English) only knows\r\nScience as she has received it from her practitioner during the treatments\r\nreceived within the last month. So much has come to her from Spirit\r\nthrough her loyalty to Christ, in so far as she could understand.\r\n\r\nA case of ulcerated tooth and neuralgic belief would only partially yield\r\nafter repeated treatments, till it was discovered that the patient was\r\nantagonizing Truth by holding the thought that her old remedy, laudanum,\r\nwould give relief; treated from this standpoint, relief was immediate and\r\nfinal.\r\n\r\nOne morning after Rev. —— had been preaching to thousands for several\r\ndays, he told them that he had never felt such a sense of depression nor\r\nhad so little showing of results. Some Scientists hearing this, at once\r\nsaw his trouble. He had been fearlessly exposing and denouncing evil; and\r\nit had turned on him, till the mesmerism was likely to overcome him\r\nentirely, for he did not understand the seeming power. The effect of the\r\nsilent word to uplift and sustain, was very manifest that evening in his\r\npreaching, and was a beautiful demonstration of Science. He probably only\r\nfelt Spirit-inspiration as he had not before, without a thought as to what\r\nhad broken the evil spell; but we never know the what, or when, or where,\r\nof the harvest we can sow—“God giveth the increase.”—E. H. B., Sacramento\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI had two German patients who were anxious to have you publish “Science\r\nand Health with Key to the Scriptures” in their language. I advised them\r\nto buy it and try to read it. They commenced reading, and now can read all\r\nof Science and Health, but do not read well any other book or paper, and\r\nthey do not need to. With great love.—M. H. P.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI sold three copies of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” to\r\nfriends, not long ago. One of them, fifty years of age, said to me, “I\r\nnever had one day’s sickness in my life; but after reading Science and\r\nHealth I found that I was bruised and mangled, from the crown of my head\r\nto the soles of my feet. I have been reaching after something that, before\r\nreading Science and Health, seemed to me unattainable;” and with tears in\r\nher eyes, she rejoiced in the God of her salvation. Did not Jesus say, “If\r\nthese should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out”?\r\n\r\nP. L., Lexington, Ky.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nFor eight years I suffered terribly with my eyes; I could not read fifteen\r\nminutes without the most agonizing sick headache. Oculists called it a\r\ncase of double vision, and said that the only chance for a cure lay in\r\ncutting the muscles of the eyes. This was done, but the pain was worse\r\nthan before. One of the most famous oculists of New York said I would\r\nsimply have to endure it for life, as it was a case of severe astigmatism.\r\n\r\nI suffered so that my health gave way. A friend spoke to me of Christian\r\nScience, but I scoffed at the idea. Later on, in desperation, I asked her\r\nto lend me “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” thinking I\r\nmight be able to read five minutes a day in it. I opened the book at the\r\nchapter on Physiology, and began. Time passed unnoticed: every page seemed\r\nilluminated. I said, “This is everything or nothing; if everything, then\r\nyou need no glasses.” I took off the heavy ground glasses, and went on.\r\nWhat a terrible headache I had the next morning! but I fought it with the\r\ntruth laid down in the book. I said again, “This is everything or\r\nnothing,” and the truth triumphed. The headache ceased, but I felt\r\nmiserably. I recalled what was said about chemicalization, and persevered.\r\n\r\nIn four days my eyes were well; I read as many hours a day as I pleased;\r\nmy strength returned. I conquered one belief after another, until now,\r\nstrong and well, I meet every belief with confidence. “I will fear _no_\r\nevil: for _Thou_ art with me.” For two years I have realized the peace and\r\nconfidence which the knowledge that God is all-powerful and always present\r\nalone can give. Feeling a great desire to spread Christian Science, that\r\nit may do the good to others that it has to me, not only physically but\r\nspiritually, I ask if you have any missionaries in the work. Being a\r\nmember of the Episcopal Church, I have always sent what I could to help\r\nforeign missions through that church. Will it do the most good to continue\r\nso doing, as our foreign missionaries are devoted men, or have you\r\nChristian Science missionaries who devote their lives to the work?\r\n\r\nAn answer addressed to me, or published in the _Journal_, would help one\r\nwho is seeking to do right.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, K. L. T.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI do wish to add my testimony of being healed by reading “Science and\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures.” I had been an invalid for over twenty\r\nyears, and had given up all hope of ever being well again. I had read the\r\nbook about six weeks, when it seemed I was made all over new, and I could\r\n“run, and not be weary; and ... walk, and not faint.” I did not understand\r\nit, but it was the savior from death unto life with me; I have remained\r\nwell ever since I was healed,—more than five years ago. I commenced to\r\ntreat others as soon as I was born anew into the kingdom of Truth. My\r\npatients were healed right along, before I had taken lessons in a class,\r\nand they have remained well to this day.\r\n\r\nChristian Science has made me as young as a girl of sixteen. If this\r\nshould meet the eye of any sufferers who may be led to go and do as I did,\r\nthey will be healed.—N. A.

After eighteen years of\r\ninvalidism, and eight years of scepticism, without hope, with no\r\nGod,—except a First Cause,—I was given up to die.\r\n\r\nA loving friend told me of this book, which was soon brought; and\r\nthirty-five pages of the first chapter were read to me that evening. The\r\nnext morning I got up, walked, and read the book for myself.\r\n\r\nI mention the chapter, for the reason that nearly two years have passed\r\nsince those wonderful words of Life were first read to me, and _still_\r\ntheir sacred sweetness is ever the same. Now I exclaim, _God is_ All!\r\n\r\nMRS. MARY A. R.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to keep still any longer. In 1885, when I had not\r\nknown a well day in five years, “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures” was placed in my hands by a dear lady who insisted upon my\r\nreading it, saying she believed it would heal me. Like many, I was afraid\r\nof it,—until I learned what it really was. The friend’s words were\r\nverified. I _was_ healed by the reading of the book, and for one year\r\ncontinued to read nothing whatever but the Bible and Science and Health.\r\nThey were my constant study. Through the understanding gained, that _God_\r\nis _All_, I came to demonstrate with great success, and with but one\r\nthought,—for I knew nothing about giving a “treatment;” I wish I knew as\r\nlittle now, for I believe that healing in Christian Science is to be done\r\nin a moment. I became anxious to learn more, to study with the teacher,\r\nbut funds would not allow,—and I thought to substitute a course in\r\nChicago, perhaps. Every time I would speak of it, however, my dear mother\r\nwould say, “You have Science and Health and the Bible, and God for your\r\nteacher—what more do you need? If I could not go to the teacher, I would\r\nnot go to any one.”\r\n\r\nIf I had only heeded the blessed counsel of Truth!\r\n\r\nI went to Chicago, however, so full of confidence in Christian Science\r\nthat I supposed every one who had studied with Mrs. Eddy must be right.\r\nUnfortunately, I took my course with a spiritualist who had been through\r\ntwo of her classes; discovered my mistake, and went to a mind-cure,—only\r\nto find the mistake repeated. Being an earnest seeker for Truth, I tried\r\nagain to go to the Massachusetts Metaphysical College; but it was\r\nuncertain when there would be a class, so I took a course with one of Mrs.\r\nEddy’s students in Boston. The darkness now rolled away. Science and\r\nHealth once more revealed the light to me as of old.\r\n\r\nAll this time, the mind-curers had me in view, and were sending me\r\nreading-matter; but, _praise the Lord!_ Truth is victorious.\r\n\r\nMy dear brothers and sisters, let us be safely guided by the counsels of\r\nour Mother, in Science and Health! I, for one, am astounded that I was so\r\nled astray; but I did it all through ignorance,—and the _sincere_ desire\r\nto know the truth and to _do_ it, saved me.\r\n\r\nYour sister in truth, R.

R., Wauseon, Ohio\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nA little over two years ago, while living in Pittsburgh, my wife and I had\r\nChristian Science brought to our attention. We were at once interested,\r\nand bought a copy of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nAt the time, Mrs. A—— was suffering with severe belief of astigmatism of\r\nthe eyes. She had been treated by a number of specialists, during seven\r\nyears, the last being the late Dr. Agnew of New York, who prescribed two\r\nsets of glasses. He said that he could do nothing more for her, as the\r\ntrouble was organic; that she must wear glasses constantly; that if she\r\nattempted to go without, she would become either blind or insane. The\r\nglasses were in operation, and still life had become a burden from\r\nconstant pain, when Christian Science came to our relief. Mrs. A—— had not\r\nin years read for two consecutive minutes, and could not use her eyes in\r\nsewing at all. The lady that told us of the Science, insisted that she\r\n_could_ read Science and Health, which she actually did,—reading it\r\nthrough twice, and studying it carefully each time. After the second\r\nreading, there came the thought that she did not need the glasses, and she\r\nat once abandoned them, and went about her usual duties. In about two\r\nweeks from that day the eyes were perfectly healed, and are well and\r\nstrong to-day.\r\n\r\nE. G.

Could you know out of\r\nwhat depths of material _débris_ the first reading of the first volume of\r\nScience and Health, six years ago last December, lifted me, you would\r\nbelieve it had always been “all I could ask.” It was _only_ words from the\r\npen of _uninspired_ writers that gave me pain. As the revelation of the\r\nAll-good appeared to me, all other books, all forms of religion, all\r\nmethods of healing, to my sense became void. Chronic beliefs of disease of\r\ntwenty years’ standing, dimness of sight from the belief of age, all\r\ndisappeared _instantly_; indeed, material life seemed a blank. The _why?_\r\nI could not explain, but this I did know, in this realm of the real I\r\nfound joy, peace, rest, love to all, unbounded, unspeakable. Human\r\nlanguage had lost its power of expression, for no words came to me; and in\r\nall this six years of bliss I still have found no words to tell my\r\nnew-found life in God. The most chronic forms of disease have sometimes\r\nbeen healed instantly and without argument. With great love and\r\ngratitude.—M. H. P.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI take great comfort in reading “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” and will cling firmly to the light I have, knowing that more\r\nwill be given me. While in Salt Lake City, I met at the hotel a lady who\r\nhad been an invalid all her life. I talked with her about Christian\r\nScience, and loaned her Science and Health, together with the _Journals_ I\r\nhad with me. She had become very much discouraged, having lost all faith\r\nin doctors and medicine, and did not know where to turn next. She became\r\nvery much absorbed in the book, feeling she had found salvation. She at\r\nonce laid aside the glasses she was wearing, and now reads readily without\r\nthem. She and her husband have accepted this truth beautifully.—Mrs. G. A.\r\nG., Ogden, Utah\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nOn a trip through Mexico I met a woman who told me that, although she did\r\nnot believe in Christian Science, on her way from Wisconsin, her home, she\r\nhad bought a copy of Science and Health. When she reached M——, she met a\r\nminister from the North, whom the M. D.’s had sent there because of\r\nconsumption,—they had given him two months to live. She gave him Science\r\nand Health, and while doing so, felt it was all absurd. The minister read\r\nit, and was healed _immediately_. Was not this a beautiful demonstration\r\nof the power of Truth, and good evidence that Science and Health is the\r\nword of God?\r\n\r\nI had while in Mexico a glorious conquest over the fear of smallpox. There\r\nwere hundreds of cases in some small towns where we were. After the fear\r\nwas cast out, never a thought of it as real came to me or my husband, or\r\ntroubled us in any way. On the street I met three men who were being taken\r\nto the pest-house with that loathsome disease.—F. W.

This is doing much good in the social circles. He has\r\nfor a long time been interested, but his wife has declared it could not\r\nheal, and was not Christian. She will now be obliged to acknowledge this\r\nhealing, for the lady above referred to has been, to sense, a great\r\nsufferer.—P. J. L.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nSome of the experiences given in the _Journal_ have been so helpful to me,\r\nI have been moved to give to its readers a little experience of my own,\r\nwhich occurred when I first began the study of “Science and Health with\r\nKey to the Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nI had already been healed of sick headache, almost instantly, by declaring\r\nthat I was God’s child, and, as God is perfect, His child must be perfect\r\nalso. This had given me great happiness, and a quiet, peaceful state of\r\nmind I never had known before. My family did not seem to see anything good\r\nin Christian Science, but to me it was sacred.\r\n\r\nOne Monday morning, I awoke feeling very ill indeed. The morning was warm\r\nand sultry. I thought I certainly could not wash that day; but when I went\r\ndownstairs, I found my daughter had made preparations for such work. I\r\nthought, “Well, if she feels like washing, I will not say anything;\r\nperhaps I shall get over this.” After breakfast I went about my work,\r\nthinking I could lean against the tub and wash with more ease than I could\r\ndo up the morning work. I tried to treat myself as I had done\r\nbefore,—tried to realize that “all is Mind, there is no matter;” that “God\r\nis All, there is nothing beside Him,” but all to no purpose. I seemed to\r\ngrow worse all the time. I did not want my family to know how badly I was\r\nfeeling, and it was very humiliating to think that I must give up and go\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nAll at once these questions came to me, as though spoken by some one,\r\ntaking me away from my line of thought entirely: How is God an\r\never-present help? How does He know our earnest desires? Then, without\r\nwaiting for me to think how, the answer came in the same way, God is\r\nconscious Mind. Instantly the thoughts came: Is God conscious of me? Can I\r\nbe conscious of Him? I was healed instantly: every bad feeling was\r\ndestroyed. I could see that the morning had not changed a particle, but I\r\nwas oblivious of the weather. It did not seem that I had anything more to\r\ndo with that washing. It was finished in good season, while I was “absent\r\nfrom the body, and present with the Lord.”\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of the battle with sin and self, but at the same\r\ntime it was the dawning of the resurrection. Since then (over four years)\r\nI have had many experiences, some of which seem too sacred to give to the\r\nworld. False literature has caused me much suffering; sorrow has visited\r\nmy home; but, through all this, the light that came to me on that Monday\r\nmorning—that new and precious sense of omnipresent Life, Truth, and\r\nLove—has never left me one moment. It was the light that cannot be hid.\r\n\r\nMRS. H. B. J., Cambridge, Ill.\r\n\r\nHealing\r\n\r\nFour years ago I learned for the first time that there was a way to be\r\nhealed through Christ. I had always been sick, but found no relief in\r\ndrugs; still, I thought that if the Bible was true, God could heal me. So,\r\nwhen my attention was called to Christian Science, I at once bought\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” studied it, and began to\r\nimprove in health. I seemed to see God so near and so dear,—so different\r\nfrom the God I had been taught to fear. I studied alone night and day,\r\nuntil I found I was healed, both physically and mentally.\r\n\r\nThen came a desire to tell every one of this wonderful truth. I expected\r\nall to feel just as pleased as I did; but to my sorrow none would believe.\r\nSome, it is true, took treatment and were helped, but went on in the old\r\nway, without a word of thanks. But still I could not give up. I seemed to\r\nknow that this was the way, and I had rather live it alone than to follow\r\nthe crowd the other way. But as time passed, I had some good\r\ndemonstrations of this Love that is our Life.\r\n\r\nI am the only Scientist in Le Roy, as yet, but the good seed has been\r\nsown, and where the people once scoffed at this “silly new idea,” they are\r\nbecoming interested, and many have been healed, and some are asking about\r\nit. One dear old lady and I study the Bible Lessons every Tuesday\r\nafternoon. She came to call, and as we talked, she told me of her sickness\r\nof years’ standing; and was healed during our talk, so that she has never\r\nfelt a touch of the old trouble since.\r\n\r\nOne lady, whom I had never seen, was healed of consumption in six weeks’\r\ntreatment. She had not left her bed in four months, and had been given up\r\nby many physicians.\r\n\r\nMRS. FLORENCE WILLIAMS, Le Roy, Mich.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI like the _Journal_ and _Quarterly_, and have many of Rev. Mary B. G.\r\nEddy’s works, which make my little world. I have a great desire to learn\r\nmore of this Love that casts out all fear, and to work in this Science. It\r\nis the greatest pleasure I have, to talk this truth, as far as I\r\nunderstand it, to any who will listen; and am waiting for others to learn\r\nof this blessed Science.\r\n\r\nI give my experience in reading “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures” aloud to a little child. A letter published in the _Journal_,\r\nwritten by a lady who had relieved a two-year-old child by reading to her,\r\nfirst suggested this course to me. At the time, my little one was a trifle\r\nover a year old. I was trying to overcome for him a claim which, though\r\nnot one of serious illness, was no small trial to me, because of its\r\nfrequent occurrence and its seeming ability to baffle my efforts. One day\r\nas I sat near and treated him, it occurred to me to read aloud. I took up\r\none of the older editions of Science and Health lying near, began at the\r\nwords, “Brains can give no idea of God’s man,” and read on for two or\r\nthree paragraphs, endeavoring—as the writer suggested—to understand it\r\nmyself; yet thinking, perchance, the purer thought of the babe might grasp\r\nthe underlying meaning sooner than I. So it proved. Before the disturbance\r\nfelt by me had been calmed, the weary expression on the face of the child\r\nwas replaced by one of evident relief.\r\n\r\nWhen putting him to sleep, I had often repeated the spiritual\r\ninterpretation of the Lord’s Prayer. One night he was very restless,\r\nfretful, and cried a great deal, while I seemed unable to soothe him. At\r\nlast I perceived that he was asking for something, and it dawned upon me\r\nthat the Prayer might be his desire. I began repeating it aloud,\r\nendeavoring to _mean_ it also. He turned over quietly, and in a few\r\nminutes was sweetly sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe last time my attention was specially called to this subject, was about\r\na year after the first experience. Various hindrances had been allowed to\r\nkeep me from Science and Health all day; and it was toward evening when I\r\nrecognized that material sense had been given predominance, and must be\r\nput down. I soon felt drawn to read the book. The little boy had seemed\r\nrestless and somewhat disturbed all day; but without thinking specially of\r\nhim, rather to assist in holding my own thought, I began to read aloud,\r\n“Consciousness constructs a better body, when it has conquered our fear of\r\nmatter.” In a minute or two a little hand had touched mine, and I looked\r\ndown into a sweet face fairly radiant with smiles. I read it over. The\r\nchild was evidently delighted, and was restful and happy all the rest of\r\nthe day.—A. H. W., Deland, Florida\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nA week ago a friend wrote to me on business, and in the letter stated that\r\nhis wife had been very ill for six weeks. At once the thought came, “Tell\r\nher to read the chapter on Healing, in Science and Health.” In my answer\r\nto his letter I obeyed the thought. A few days after, I had occasion to\r\ncall; found her much better, and _reading_ Science and Health. They had\r\ndone as directed, and had received the promise.—R., New York\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe first allusion to Christian Science reached me in an article I read on\r\nthat subject. Later, a friend came to visit me, bringing a copy of\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” For two weeks I read it\r\neagerly; then I sent for a copy for myself. When it came, I began to study\r\nit. The Bible, of which I had had but a dim understanding, began to grow\r\nclearer. The light grew brighter each day. Finally, I began to treat\r\nmyself against ills that had bound me for twenty-eight years. At the end\r\nof six weeks I was _healed_, much to the amazement of all who knew me.\r\nFrom that time, my desire was to help others out of their suffering, and\r\nto talk this wonderful truth. After a while I took the class lectures, and\r\nam doing what I can to spread this healing gospel.—A. M. G.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nRev. Mary B. G. Eddy\r\n\r\n_My Dear Leader:_—I will try to tell you how I was led to Christian\r\nScience. Heretofore I have not tried to lead a Christian life, but have\r\nalways firmly believed that if one truly desired and needed help, he would\r\nget it from God by asking for it. I suffered, as I think but very few\r\nhave, for fourteen years; yet I did not think it sufficient to warrant me\r\nin asking God to help me, until I gave up all hope elsewhere,—and this\r\noccurred in the spring of 1891. I then thought that the time had come to\r\ncommit myself to God. Being at home alone, after going to bed I prayed God\r\nto deliver me from my torments, this sentence being the substance of my\r\nprayer, “What shall I do to be saved?”\r\n\r\nI repeated that sentence, I suppose, until I fell asleep. About twelve\r\no’clock at night, I saw a vision in the form of a man with wings, standing\r\nat the foot of my bed,—wings partly spread,—one arm hanging loosely at his\r\nside, and one extended above his head. At the same time there was a bright\r\nlight shining in my room, which made all objects shine like fire. I knew\r\nwhere I was, and was not afraid. The vision (for such it was), after\r\nlooking directly at me for some time, spoke this one sentence, and then\r\ndisappeared: “Do right, and thou shalt be saved.”\r\n\r\nI immediately tried to live according to that precept, and found relief in\r\nproportion to my understanding. I soon after learned of Christian Science.\r\nOne of my brothers in Kansas, having been healed by it, persuaded me to\r\nbuy “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” wherein I learned\r\nthat the above precept was the key to Christian Science; that it is\r\nChristian Science to do right, and that nothing short of right living has\r\nany claim to the name.\r\n\r\nI have been learning my way in Christian Science about one year, and have\r\nbeen successful in healing. I have all of your books, and am a subscriber\r\nfor the _Journal_ and _Quarterly Bible Lessons_. Some of the cases I have\r\ntreated have yielded almost instantly. I am a stranger to you, but I have\r\ntold you the truth, just as it occurred. Yours in truth,\r\n\r\nSAM SCHROYER, Oklahoma City, Okla.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI desire to make known the great good I have received by reading the\r\nblessed book “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.” Four years\r\nhave now passed since I began to read it. It has been my only healer and\r\nteacher, as I never have had an opportunity to go through a class; but I\r\nfind that the “Spirit of truth” will teach us all things if we will but\r\npractise well what we know. After two years and a half of study, I\r\nthought, as many beginners think, that I had travelled over the worst part\r\nof this narrow path.\r\n\r\nSoon after, it came about that I was separated from every one who had ever\r\nheard of Christian Science; and, as I lived in the country, no one came to\r\nvisit me for about eight months. At first, I thought the Lord had wrought\r\na great evil. I had no one to talk to, but would take my Science and\r\nHealth every morning, before going about my work, and read; yet mortal\r\nmind would say, “You can do no good, with no one to talk with.” At last,\r\none morning after listening to the serpent’s voice, I looked out at the\r\nlittle wild flowers as they waved to and fro; they seemed to be a living\r\nvoice, and this is what they said: “On earth peace, good will toward men.”\r\nThere was also a mocking-bird that would sit on the house and sing. For\r\nthe first time, I realized that divine Love was the only friend I needed.\r\nSoon after, I sent the _Journal_ to my nearest neighbor, by her little son\r\nwho came to play with my children. Afterward she told me that when she\r\nbegan to read it she said to the family, “God has sent this book to me.”\r\nCalling to see her one evening, I found her suffering from heart disease.\r\nI began talking to her about Christian Science, and in less than an hour\r\nshe declared herself healed. She is to-day a happy woman. I would say to\r\nall suffering ones, that if you will buy a copy of this wonderful book,\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” by the Rev. Mary Baker G.\r\nEddy, and study it, and practise its teachings, you will find it a pearl\r\nof great price.\r\n\r\nMRS.

I read\r\nit through in the same manner in which I would read any other book, to\r\nfind out the contents.\r\n\r\nBefore I got to the end, having partly understood its meaning, I began to\r\ndemonstrate over old physical troubles, and they disappeared. A belt that\r\nI had worn for over twelve years, I took off, and threw overboard (being a\r\nseafaring man).\r\n\r\nUp to that time I had been a constant smoker, and chewed tobacco; but I\r\ngradually lost all pleasure in it, and now look upon it with disgust.\r\n\r\nI was brought up in the Lutheran doctrine, and when a boy received a good\r\nknowledge of Scripture; but I never understood it until explained to me in\r\nScience and Health.\r\n\r\nH. F.

I left my mending, took Science and Health and read all\r\nthe afternoon and evening; when all trace of the claim was gone, and I\r\nhave felt nothing of it since.”\r\n\r\nWhen this dear woman applied to Truth, she was a great sufferer. Her\r\ngratitude knows no bounds. Many chronic ailments, which have bound her\r\nwith heavy chains for many years, are being removed one by one. It is such\r\na sweet privilege to lead her out of this bondage of flesh, for she turns\r\nwith such childlike trust and obedience to the book, and looks to that for\r\naid in every trial and affliction. It is beautiful to see, and is a rebuke\r\nto some of us older in the thought, who depend so much on personality.\r\n\r\nShe is far away, in a little country town where Science has hardly been\r\nheard of; but she is so happy with her book that she has no desire for\r\nother reading.\r\n\r\nI have always tried to show her that God was with her there as well as\r\nwith us here; that in Him she possesses all; and that with her Bible and\r\nScience and Health no harm can befall her, for the remedy for every ill\r\nshe has at hand.—MRS. C. H.

He asked me to help him. I\r\ntook the case. Relief came almost instantly. I treated him for eight days;\r\nthe fifth, I heard one of three physicians, who held a private\r\nconsultation over my patient, ask him this question:\r\n\r\n“Mr. F——, have you not got one bit of pain?” I was rewarded by hearing him\r\nanswer, “No, sir; not the least bit.” No one else seemed to have any hope\r\nfor him; but I held firmly to the thought that God is an ever-present\r\nhelp, never doubting, and Christian Science has again won a victory. Many\r\npeople call it a miracle, and it has set them to thinking.\r\n\r\nThe harvest is now ripe and ready for the reaper. I wish some good\r\nChristian Science teacher would come and help us. I can help in my own\r\nway, but am not advanced enough to lead and teach others. I have only\r\nstudied Science and Health a little over a year, and have not been through\r\na class yet.\r\n\r\nS. G. SCHROYER, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI became interested in Christian Science through being healed. I had no\r\nfaith in doctors, therefore would not consult any; but felt that something\r\nmust be done, or I would soon follow a brother and sister who had passed\r\non with the same claim. In my extremity I thought of the “great\r\nPhysician,” and took my case to Him, and realized that He alone could help\r\nme.\r\n\r\nA relative, finding I would not consult a doctor or take any drug, gave me\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” to read; saying that,\r\nalthough a dear friend thought she was greatly helped by a Christian\r\nScientist, he himself had no faith in that kind of treatment, and had no\r\nuse for the book.\r\n\r\nI had heard of the people called Christian Scientists, and of their\r\ntextbook, Science and Health, but knew nothing about either; yet I wanted\r\nto know, and took the book gladly, and was soon deeply interested in it.\r\nIt was a revelation to me. Although I could only understand it in part, I\r\nknew it was the truth, and the truth was making me free. I felt that I had\r\nbeen bound and in prison; and that now, one after another, the bonds were\r\nbeing broken, and I was lifted into the pure air and light of heaven. I\r\nwas healed before I had read half-way through the precious volume; for I\r\nwas obliged to read slowly, and some passages over and over again. When I\r\ncame to page 304, line 10 (47th edition), I then and there felt that I\r\nmust add my testimony, though already there were \"heaps upon heaps;\" but\r\nsince then, I have tried to put the thought of those dark days away from\r\nme, and only refer to them now in the hope that some one who is bound may\r\nbe released and brought into the light of divine Love, which alone can\r\nheal, and make us “every whit whole.”\r\n\r\nL.

On July 2, 1890, I met a Scientist who gave me\r\na pamphlet called “Christian Healing,” by the Rev. Mary B. G. Eddy. At\r\nthat time I was almost helpless. This lady advised me to buy Science and\r\nHealth. I did so, and tried to read it; but my hands were so lame I could\r\nnot hold it, and I let it fall to the floor so often that it became\r\nunbound, and I laid it away and resumed my medicine.\r\n\r\nThe following May, the Scientist visited in this city again. She advised\r\nme to burn all my medicines and to lean unreservedly on the promises of\r\nGod. I took her advice; had my book rebound in three volumes, so I could\r\nhold it more easily, and now read it constantly, reading nothing else.\r\nSometimes I would suffer intensely, then I would get a little better; then\r\nmore suffering, and so on, until August, 1891, when all pain left me. I\r\nhave had no return of it, and no disagreeable sensations of any kind, and\r\nam perfectly well in all respects.\r\n\r\nSurely, if we will but trust our heavenly Father, He is sufficient for us.\r\nI hope some one of, or near, my age, who is afflicted, may read this and\r\ntake courage; for I have _demonstrated_ the fact that, by reading Science\r\nand Health, in connection with the Bible, and trying to follow the\r\nteaching therein, one in the autumn of life may be made over new. I am so\r\nthankful to God for my great recovery!\r\n\r\nThat remark of Sojourner Truth helps me to a better understanding of Life\r\nin God: “God is the great house that holds all His children; we dwell in\r\nHim as the fishes dwell in the seas.”—P. T. P.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nUntil about one year ago, I had no thought of investigating Christian\r\nScience. Previous to that time it had been presented to me in such a way\r\nthat I condemned it as unreasonable and absurd. At that time it was\r\npresented to me in a more reasonable light. I determined to divest myself\r\nof prejudice (as far as was possible) and investigate it, thinking that if\r\nthere was anything in it, it was for me as well as others; that I surely\r\nneeded it, and if I found no good in it, I could then with some show of\r\nreason condemn it.\r\n\r\nI had been reading Science and Health about two weeks, when one morning I\r\nwanted my cane. It had been misplaced; and while looking for it the\r\nthought came to me, If all is Mind, I need no cane. I went out without it,\r\nhave not used it at all since, and do not need it as a support; but for a\r\ntime I did miss it from my hand. I had used it for years as a support to a\r\nvery lame back.\r\n\r\nI before went much stooped, because it pained me to straighten up; but\r\nfrom the time I laid my cane aside I straightened up, free from pain.\r\nOccasionally I have a slight pain in my back, but it is nothing to compare\r\nwith what it had been.\r\n\r\nIn a short time after laying my cane aside, my pipe and tobacco went out\r\ninto the street and have not returned. I had smoked for sixty-five years,\r\nand chewed for fifty. I have no desire for either of them; in fact, the\r\nsmoke is offensive to me.\r\n\r\nMany times before I had tried to quit, but the desire for it was so strong\r\nthat I would go back to it; and when I tried to “taper off,” I would make\r\nthe taper end the longest.\r\n\r\nMany other physical claims have disappeared, and it is a common thing for\r\nacquaintances to say when they meet me, “You look better than I have seen\r\nyou for years; what have you been doing?” My reply is, I not only look\r\nbetter, but feel better, and am better; and Christian Science has done it.\r\n\r\nWith all this, I seem to have very little spiritual understanding of the\r\ntruth; am endeavoring to get more, but it seems slow. If there is a\r\nshorter road to it than I have found, I should like to be directed to it.\r\n\r\nJ. S.

The book was\r\nfull of light, and disease vanished as naturally as darkness gives place\r\nto light, although it was about six months before I was entirely healed.\r\n\r\nSeeing this truth in its purity, showed me where to take my stand; and in\r\ndefending it I have the prince of this world to meet. Mortal mind has even\r\ncalled me crazy; but what a blessing to know the nothingness of that mind,\r\nand that divine Principle governs all its ideas, and will place each where\r\nit belongs!\r\n\r\nIf our Master was persecuted, can his servants hope to escape? I know in\r\nsome degree what Paul meant when he said he rejoiced in tribulations, “for\r\nwhen I am weak, then am I strong.”\r\n\r\nMany claims that have baffled the skill of the physicians have disappeared\r\nthrough my understanding of Truth. What a blessing that we can break the\r\nbread of Life to others, and so add to our crown of rejoicing!\r\n\r\nS. E.

He did not feel that he wanted to go; seemed\r\ndumpish, and according to mortal belief was not well; at noon, he said he\r\nwanted to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nHis mother took him in her lap and began to read to him from “Science and\r\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures.” Very soon he expressed a wish to go to\r\nthe picnic, and did go. His father, happening to pass the place where the\r\nlittle ones were spending the afternoon, and somewhat surprised to see him\r\nplaying, as happy and active as any there, called to him and asked, “How\r\nlong did you sleep?” The little fellow replied, “I did not sleep at all;\r\nmamma read to me from Science and Health, and I was well in a minute.”—K.\r\nL.

I asked her what it was, and what they\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nShe then told me of a friend of hers who had become a Christian Scientist.\r\nThis friend had passed through great sorrow and disappointment; her health\r\nhad failed her, and her cheerful disposition had entirely changed; she\r\ncould talk of nothing but her troubles, and was a most unhappy woman. A\r\nfew years ago she visited my neighbor, who, greatly surprised at her\r\nchanged appearance,—for she was happy and well,—asked where her troubles\r\nwere. The reply was, “I have no troubles. I have found true happiness; for\r\nI have become a Christian Scientist.”\r\n\r\nI became deeply interested, and asked if the students in Clinton had\r\npublic meetings on Sundays. She replied that they had, and told me where\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday, I went. All was quiet when I entered, for they were\r\nengaged in silent prayer. Soon they repeated the spiritual interpretation\r\nof the Lord’s Prayer. I shall never forget the impression that made on me;\r\nall the next week I heard the leader’s voice repeating the first sentence.\r\n\r\nI was invited to come again, and did so. One of the ladies loaned me\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and offered to get me\r\none; which she did the next week. I have studied it in connection with the\r\nBible. I have greatly improved in health, having had only one attack of a\r\nphysical trouble which caused great suffering, since that time, and that\r\nwas a year ago.\r\n\r\nAt first, I did not think anything about being healed, or of my physical\r\ninfirmity. I only loved the sacred teaching. How true, that God’s word\r\ndoes not return unto Him void! The words of truth that my neighbor’s\r\nfriend spoke to her, were what first awakened me. If the one who first\r\nhears it does not receive it, it goes to some one who is ready, and it\r\ntakes root and bears fruit.\r\n\r\nMRS. G. H.

I had a desire to know something of Christian\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nI procured the textbook, and studied it with a desire to know the truth.\r\nAt first all was dark; but light began slowly to come, and at the end of\r\nthree months I found my physical claims all gone and my eyesight restored.\r\nAt the end of three months more, I had gained thirty-five pounds in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nI had been an infidel, and the change from that came more slowly; but now\r\nI know that my Redeemer lives, and I am able by divine grace to make very\r\nconvincing demonstrations.—J. S., Rudd, Iowa\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nFor a long time I have felt that I must in some way express my great debt\r\nof gratitude for Christian Science. I know no better way to do so than to\r\ngive an account, through the _Journal_, of some of the many blessings I\r\nhave received as a result of our Leader’s untiring toil and\r\nself-sacrificing love for suffering mortals, in giving to us the wonderful\r\nbook, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nWhen I first heard of Christian Science, about six years ago, I was\r\nsatisfied that it was the religion of Christ Jesus, because Jesus had so\r\nplainly said, “And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name\r\nshall they cast out devils;... they shall lay hands on the sick, and they\r\nshall recover.”\r\n\r\nI had been a church-member since my girlhood, but was not satisfied that\r\nmy belief would take me to heaven, as I did not have these “signs\r\nfollowing”—and this had always troubled me; so, when I heard that an old\r\nacquaintance living at a distance had not only been raised from a dying\r\ncondition to health, but her life had been changed and purified through\r\nChristian Science, I could hardly wait to know more of this Christlike\r\nreligion which was casting out evils and healing the sick. I searched\r\nevery bookstore in the city for Science and Health, at last found a copy,\r\nand was delighted to get hold of it, but little realized what a treasure\r\nit was to be to me and my household.\r\n\r\nAt first it was like Greek to me, and I could not understand much of it,\r\nbut gleaned enough to keep on reading, and longed for some one to talk to\r\nme of it.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been reading it about a year’s time, I suddenly became almost\r\nblind. I knew no Scientist to go to, so went to physicians; they told me\r\nthat my case was hopeless, that it was certain my sight never could be\r\nrestored, and the probabilities were that I would soon be totally blind.\r\n\r\nI felt sure that Christian Science would help me if I could only fully\r\nunderstand it; but there was no one from whom I could ask help, that I\r\nknew of. I gave all the time that I could use my eyes to studying Science\r\nand Health,—which at first was not more than five minutes two, and\r\nsometimes three, times a day; gradually my sight returned, until it was\r\nfully restored.\r\n\r\nDuring this time God and the “little book” were my only help. My\r\nunderstanding was very limited; but like the prodigal son, I had turned\r\naway from the husks, towards my Father’s house, and while I “was yet a\r\ngreat way off” my Father came to meet me. When this great cloud of\r\ndarkness was banished by the light of Truth, could I doubt that Christian\r\nScience was indeed the “Comforter” that would lead us “into all truth”?\r\n\r\nAgain I lay at the point of death; but holding steadfastly to the truth,\r\nknowing, from the teaching of this precious book, that God is Life and\r\nthere is no death, I was raised up to health,—restored to my husband and\r\nlittle children, all of whom I am thankful to say are now with me in\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nI had no one to talk with on this subject, knew no one of whose\r\nunderstanding I felt sure enough to ask for help; but I was careful from\r\nthe first not to read or inquire into anything except genuine Christian\r\nScience, and how thankful I am for it! Since then, I have been through a\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nI cannot express in words what Christian Science has done for my children,\r\nor my gratitude that the light of Truth has come to them in their innocent\r\nchildhood,—healing all claims of sickness, and showing us how to overcome\r\nthe more stubborn claims of sin.—L.

I was not long in finding the light I\r\nneeded,—that gave “feet to the lame,” enabling me now to go, move, and\r\nwalk, where I will, without crutch or support of any description, save the\r\nstaff of divine Science.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as my thoughts are occupied with the work in Science, does\r\nthe peace and joy come inwardly that transforms the blight of error\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nT.

My\r\nprayer is that I may be so filled with the truth that I can carry the\r\nmessage to my brother man.\r\n\r\nF. W.

The\r\nblessing has been so bountiful that words can but poorly express my\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nA little over six years ago, a relative came from Denver, Colorado, to\r\nvisit us. She was a Christian Scientist, having herself been healed of a\r\nsevere claim that M. D.’s, drugs, and climate could not relieve; and her\r\nhusband having been in the drug business, she had had a chance to give\r\nthem a fair trial.\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law did not talk much on the subject, as I remember; but what\r\nwas better, lived the truth before us as she realized it.\r\n\r\nOne day (a blessed day to me), I ventured to open Science and Health, and\r\nread the first sentence in the Preface. I closed the book, wondering what\r\nmore it could contain, this seeming to cover the whole ground. When my\r\nsister-in-law returned to the room, I asked her if I might read it. Her\r\nreply was, “Yes; but begin at the first.”\r\n\r\nThat night, after all had retired, I began to read; within forty-eight\r\nhours I destroyed all drugs, applications, etc., notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat my husband had just paid fifty dollars to a travelling specialist for\r\npart of a treatment. With the drugs disappeared ailments of nine years’\r\nstanding, which M. D.’s had failed to relieve.\r\n\r\nI now understand that my sudden healing was due to my turning completely\r\naway from material methods; for I was convinced I should never use them\r\nagain. I realized that God was my health, my strength, my Life, therefore\r\nAll. As I read Science and Health, I wondered why others had not discerned\r\nthis truth,—physicians, ministers, and others who had devoted their lives\r\nto benefit mankind. Yes! why? Because they had been seeking in the\r\nopposite direction to Truth, namely, for cause and effect in matter, when\r\nall cause and effect are mental.\r\n\r\nI mention physicians and ministers, because one class claims to heal\r\ndisease, the other claims to heal sin; but Christian Science heals\r\nphysically and morally,—it contains all; “its leaves are for the healing\r\nof the nations.”\r\n\r\nL.

The last one, after treating me for one year, told me he would give\r\nme one year more to live.\r\n\r\nOne evening a near neighbor came in and asked me to go home with her; and\r\nas it was only a few steps, I did so.\r\n\r\nShe took up a new book, Science and Health, read me a few chapters, and\r\nthen gave me some Christian Science tracts, which I read, and one of them\r\nI almost committed to memory.\r\n\r\nI bought a copy of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and\r\nstudied it carefully. I am healed of all those claims which troubled me so\r\nlong. I was lifted out of darkness into light.\r\n\r\nM. J.

Eddy, Boston, Mass.:_—I wish to thank you for the true\r\nlight that was revealed to me by reading your book, “Science and Health\r\nwith Key to the Scriptures,” and at once adopting its teaching. It was one\r\nyear ago to-day that I put on the armor, determined never to surrender to\r\nthe enemy; and you may know I have looked forward to this day with a great\r\ndeal of pleasure, to show my friends that the Lord is constantly with me\r\nto help overcome all evil.\r\n\r\nSome said, when I first started in this new path, “Wait until you get one\r\nof your stomach attacks, and you will change your mind.” For months they\r\nhave waited, and are beginning to see the truth in my actions, that speak\r\nfor themselves, and show that all is _Mind_.\r\n\r\nFor nearly thirty years I had been a sufferer from throat and stomach\r\ntroubles; bronchitis, dyspepsia, gastralgia, and gastritis, etc., were the\r\nterms applied by my physicians. About eighteen years of that time I was\r\nengaged in the drug business, had constant opportunities for consulting\r\nthe best physicians, and took such medicine as I felt assured would cure\r\nme; but only to be disappointed each time.\r\n\r\nThe last few years I had been living on oatmeal crackers and hot water;\r\nsuffering more or less all the time, and could not eat anything else\r\nwithout suffering intense pain. I felt as though I could not live many\r\nmonths more, and was getting ready to give up the fight when a dear friend\r\nand neighbor, Mrs. Corning, left a copy of Science and Health at our home.\r\nAt first I did not care to read it; having been educated, for many years,\r\nin the belief that medicine can cure all diseases, I could not conceive of\r\nanything else to cure the sick.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday I had the curiosity to know something about this Christian\r\nScience, and read Science and Health. The more I read, the more interested\r\nI became, and finally said to myself, “I will try it.” I took a large\r\nporous plaster and four thicknesses of flannel off my stomach, and threw\r\nthem in the corner, saying, “Now it shall be Mind over matter; no more\r\nmatter over Mind.” I filled a large basket full of bottles containing\r\nmedicine, and put it in the shed (where all medicine should be). From that\r\nday I have eaten of everything on the table, and all I wished. Coffee was\r\nmy worst enemy, and I had not tasted it for years without suffering untold\r\nagony. Several days passed before I cared to drink it; then, one morning,\r\nI told my family I would commence to use it; I did, and have used it every\r\nday since, and don’t know that I have a stomach, as it never has caused me\r\nany trouble since that morning.\r\n\r\nI am happy to say I have not used a drop of any kind of medicine,\r\ninternally or externally, from that day, and _I know that all is Mind_. I\r\nread the Bible and Science and Health nearly every day, thanking the Lord\r\nfor the years of suffering which have led me to the truth as taught by our\r\nSaviour; for I feel it was only through its victory over the suffering\r\nthat the truth could have been revealed in my case.\r\n\r\nI have had some demonstrations to make over error, but each time it\r\nbecomes easier. God is ever present and ready to help me, and I trust in\r\nHim; my faith is planted on a rock that is immovable.\r\n\r\nYours truly, FRANK S. EBERHART\r\n\r\nP. S.

I\r\nbecame a victim of the morphia habit, taking daily thirty grains of that\r\ndrug. My physicians declared me consumptive, and abandoned all hopes of\r\nrecovery. Shortly after this I made the acquaintance of a student of the\r\nauthor of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” who presented\r\nme with her works; and as drugs did me no good, I stopped taking any\r\nwhatever, save morphia, without which I thought it impossible to get\r\nalong, and to my astonishment began to gain in flesh, and my ambition\r\nreturning in proportion. I finally felt that I would stop my loathsome\r\nhabit of morphia-eating, and did so in one week, without any discomfort\r\nworth mentioning. For a test I administered one fourth of a grain of\r\nmorphia to the aforesaid Scientist, hypodermically, without the slightest\r\nphysiological effect, clearly proving the existence of metaphysical laws.\r\nI have read Science and Health carefully, and consider my present improved\r\nhealth solely due to mental influence.\r\n\r\nOTTO ANDERSON, M.D., Cincinnati, Ohio\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe profound truths which you announce, sustained by facts of the immortal\r\nlife, give to your work the seal of inspiration—reaffirm in modern phrase\r\nthe Christian revelations.

I have perused it with interest. Your book\r\ntends to lead us to new thoughts and practices in the healing art, and for\r\nmany maladies I have no doubt the treatment your excellent work introduces\r\nwill be the only remedy.\r\n\r\n(COL.)

Yours has, indeed,\r\nbeen a pioneer work, and will be; and I believe that you, of all the\r\nmillions, are selected and chosen because of your peculiar fitness for\r\nthis great work—this grand work of opening the gates and leading the way,\r\nthat fallen humanity may follow step by step; reach up to Christ, and be\r\nmade whole! That all this should be systematized and proven with\r\nmathematical precision,—that there can be no guesswork or quackery,—is\r\nsimply astounding. Science and Health has given me a new impetus\r\nheavenward.\r\n\r\nM. A.

CLEMENT, McMinnville, Warren Co., Tenn.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI was sick for a number of years with what some of the most skilful\r\nphysicians pronounced an incurable disease. The more I tried to get help,\r\nthe worse I became, until a life of pain and helplessness seemed\r\nunavoidable. Two years ago I heard of “Science and Health with Key to the\r\nScriptures,” began reading it and trying to live up to its teachings. At\r\nfirst, my beliefs were so strong I made but little progress; but gradually\r\nmy disease gave way, and finally disappeared, and to-day I am a well\r\nwoman. I cannot express the gratitude I feel for what the light shining\r\nthrough the teachings of that book did for me.\r\n\r\n(MRS.) EMILY T. HOWE, Norway, Me.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI have been reading “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and\r\nfeasting—like a starving, ship-wrecked mariner, on the food that was to\r\nsustain him—on truths which ages to come will appreciate, understand, and\r\naccept. Many of the theories which at first appear abstruse and obscure,\r\nat length become clear and lucid. The candle of intellect requires\r\noccasional snuffing to throw the clear light of penetration on the page.\r\n\r\n(MRS.) S. A.

I\r\ntold her the little girl would be all right; not to give her any medicine,\r\nbut read Science and Health to her. When I next saw the mother, she told\r\nme the little girl was entirely well; that the cold had all disappeared,\r\nand with it a claim of night-sweats that the child had been under for more\r\nthan a year. The little girl had been out sliding down-hill in the snow a\r\nnumber of times; had her feet very wet, but it did not affect her at all.\r\nThey were all pleased,—especially the child; her face was beaming with\r\nhappiness and smiles. This is just one little instance of the good that\r\ncomes from reading Science and Health.\r\n\r\nT. W.

The author evidently discards\r\nphysiology, hygiene, mesmerism, magnetism, and every form of medication,\r\nbathing, dieting, etc.,—all go by the board; no medicine, manipulation, or\r\nexternal applications are permitted; everything is done through the mind.\r\nApplied to certain conditions, this method has great value: even the\r\nreading of the author’s book has cured hopeless cases. The author claims\r\nthat her methods are those used by Christ and his apostles, and she has\r\nestablished a church and school to propagate them.—_Herald of Health_, N.\r\nY. (M. L. HOLBROOK, _Publisher_)\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scientists claim that the power of healing is not lost, and\r\nhave supported that claim by inducing cures astonishingly like those\r\nquoted from the New Testament. And even more good they hope to achieve, as\r\nthis power which they possess is better understood and the new light gains\r\nstrength in the world. Experience has taught us that the nearer we\r\napproach to the source of a report of miraculous power, the smaller does\r\nthe wonder grow. In the instance of the Christian Scientists, the result\r\nhas been rather the reverse; if third parties have related a remarkable\r\ncircumstance, the person of whom the fact was alleged has been found to\r\nmake the assertion still stronger.—_Boston Sunday Globe_\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” by Mary Baker G. Eddy,\r\nPresident of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, is a remarkable\r\npublication, claiming to elucidate the influence of mentality over matter.\r\nMrs. Eddy announces herself as the discoverer of this metaphysical\r\nScience, and receives students, to whom she imparts so much of her\r\nmetaphysics as their minds are capable of receiving. The volumes are a\r\nvigorous protest against the materialism of our modern scientists, Darwin,\r\nHuxley, Tyndall, etc. Her Science of Mind was first self-applied: having\r\nbeen ill and treated by doctors of the various schools without benefit,\r\nshe discovered the grand Principle of all healing to be God, or Mind.\r\nRelying on this Principle alone, she regained her health, and for the last\r\nsixteen years has taught this theory to others, and has healed the sick in\r\nall cases where the patient’s mentality was sufficiently strong to\r\nunderstand her teachings and act upon them.—_Brooklyn Eagle_\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe book “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” is certainly\r\noriginal, and contains much that will do good. The reader will find this\r\nwork not influenced by superstition or pride, but striking out\r\nboldly,—full of self-sacrifice and love towards God and man.—_Christian\r\nAdvocate_, Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” are high\r\nand pure, wholly free from those vile theories about love and marriage\r\nwhich have been so prevalent among the spiritualists. This new sect\r\ndevotes itself to a study of the Bible, and a practice of curing disease\r\nwithout mesmerism or spiritualism. It treats Darwin and materialists with\r\na lofty scorn.—_Springfield Republican_\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n“Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” is indisputably a\r\nwonderful work. It has no equal. No one can read the book and not be\r\nbenefited by it in mind and body.

It likewise has a hard thrust at spiritualism;\r\nand, taken altogether, it is a very rare book.—_Boston Investigator_\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nThe author of “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” which is\r\nattracting much attention, shows her ability to defend her cause with\r\nvigor.—_Boston Weekly Journal_\r\n\r\n(_By permission_)\r\n\r\nHow To Understand Science And Health\r\n\r\n_My Dear Friend H.:_—Your good letter of the 26th ult. came duly to hand\r\nseveral days ago, and I am not greatly surprised at its contents. You say,\r\nin substance, that you procured the book, “Science and Health with Key to\r\nthe Scriptures,” which I recommended, and that to your surprise and\r\ndisgust you found it to be a work on faith-cure, and ask by what process\r\nof reasoning I could possibly bring myself to adopt or accept such\r\nvisionary theories. In answer to your very natural question, I will try,\r\nin my own way, to give you what appears to me to be a reason for the hope\r\nthat is in me.\r\n\r\nMy religious views of fifteen years ago are too familiar to you to need\r\nany exposition at my hands at this time. Suffice it to say that the\r\nreligion of the Bible, as taught by the churches, to my mind appeared to\r\nbe self-contradictory and confusing, and their explanations failed to\r\nexplain. During the next eleven years my convictions underwent little\r\nchange. I read everything that came in my way that had any bearing upon,\r\nor pretended in any degree to explain, the problem of life; and while I\r\ngained some knowledge of a general nature, I was no nearer the solution of\r\nlife’s problem than when I began my investigations years ago, and I had\r\ngiven up all hope of ever being able to come to a knowledge of the truth,\r\nor a satisfactory explanation of the enigma of life.\r\n\r\nIn all my intellectual wanderings I had never lost my belief in a great\r\nFirst Cause, which I was as well satisfied to call God as anything else;\r\nbut the orthodox explanations of His or its nature and power were to my\r\nmind such a mixture of truth and error, that I could not tell where fact\r\nleft off and fancy began. The whole effort of the pulpit being put forth,\r\nseemed directed to the impossible task of harmonizing the teachings of\r\nJesus Christ with the wisdom of the world; and the whole tendency of our\r\nreligious education was to befog the intellect and produce scepticism in a\r\nmind that presumed to think for itself and to inquire into the why and the\r\nwherefore. I fully believe that the agnosticism of yourself and myself was\r\nproduced by the futile attempt to mix and harmonize the wisdom of the\r\nworld with the philosophy of the Christ.\r\n\r\nIn my investigations into the researches of the savants and philosophers I\r\nfound neither any satisfactory explanation of things as they seemed to\r\nexist, nor any solution of the great and all-absorbing question, “What is\r\nTruth?” Their premises appeared to be sound, and their reasonings\r\nfaultless; but in the nature of things, no final conclusion of the whole\r\nmatter could be reached from premises based wholly on material knowledge.\r\nThey could explain “matter” and its properties to their own satisfaction,\r\nbut the intelligence that lay behind or beyond it, and which was\r\nmanifested in and through it, was to them as much of a mystery as it was\r\nto the humblest of God’s creatures. They could prove pretty conclusively\r\nthat many of the generally accepted theories had no basis in fact; but\r\nthey left us as much in the dark regarding Life and its governing\r\nPrinciple as had the divines before them.\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago, while still in the mental condition above indicated,\r\nmy attention was called to what at that time appeared to me to be a new\r\nphase of spiritism, and which was called by those who professed to believe\r\nin it, _Christian Science_. I thought that I had given some attention to\r\nabout all the _isms_ that ever existed, and that this was only another\r\nphantasm of some religionist lost in the labyrinths of mental\r\nhallucination.\r\n\r\nIn my reflections at that time it seemed to me that life was an\r\nincomprehensible enigma; that the creator had placed us on this earth, and\r\nleft us entirely in the dark as to His purpose in so doing. We seemed to\r\nbe cast upon the ocean of time, and left to drift aimlessly about, with no\r\nexact knowledge of what was required of us or how to attain unto the\r\ntruth, which must certainly have an existence somewhere. It seemed to me\r\nthat in the very nature of things there must be a great error somewhere in\r\nour understanding, or that the creator Himself had slipped a cog when He\r\nfitted all things into their proper spheres. That there had been a grand\r\nmistake somewhere I had no doubt; but I still had doubt enough of my own\r\ncapabilities and understanding to believe that the mistake, whatever it\r\nwas, was in me and not in the creator. I knew that, in a fair measure at\r\nleast, I had an honest desire to live aright, as it was given me to see\r\nthe right, and to strive to some extent to do the will of God, if I could\r\nonly know certainly just what it was.\r\n\r\nWhile in this frame of mind, I inwardly appealed to the great unseen power\r\nto enlighten my understanding, and to lead me into a knowledge of the\r\ntruth, promising mentally to follow wherever it might lead, if I could\r\nonly do so understandingly.\r\n\r\nMy wife had been investigating Christian Science to some extent, but\r\nknowing my natural antipathy to such vagaries, as I then thought them, had\r\nsaid very little to me about it; but one day, while discussing the\r\nmysteries of life with a judge of one of our courts, he asked me whether I\r\nhad ever looked into the teachings of the Christian Scientists. I told him\r\nthat I had not, and he urged me very strongly to do so. He claimed to have\r\ninvestigated their teachings, and said that he had become a thorough\r\nbeliever in them. This aroused my curiosity, and I procured the book\r\ncalled “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” and read it.\r\nBefore reading very far in it, I became pretty thoroughly nauseated with\r\nwhat I thought the chimerical ideas of the author, but kept on\r\nreading,—more because I had promised to read the book than because of\r\ninterest in its teachings; but before I had gotten through with it, I did\r\nbecome interested in the Principle that I thought I discovered the author\r\nwas striving to elucidate; and when I got through it, I began again and\r\nreread it very carefully. When I had finished reading this book the second\r\ntime, I had become thoroughly convinced that her explanation of the\r\nreligion taught by Jesus Christ, and what he did teach, afforded the only\r\nexplanation which, to my mind, came anywhere near harmonizing and making\r\ncohesive what had always seemed contradictory and inexplicable in the\r\nBible. I became satisfied that I had found the truth for which I had long\r\nbeen seeking, and I arose from the reading of the book a changed man;\r\ndoubt and uncertainty had fled, and my mind has never been troubled with a\r\nserious doubt upon the subject from that day to this.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to have acquired the power it is claimed we may attain\r\nto; but I am satisfied that the fault is in me, and not in the Principle.\r\nI think I can almost hear you ask, What! do you believe in miracles? I\r\nanswer unhesitatingly, Yes; I believe in the manifestations of the power\r\nof Mind which the world calls miraculous; but which those who claim to\r\nunderstand the Principle through which the works are done, seem to think\r\nnot unnatural, but only the logical result of the application of a known\r\nPrinciple.\r\n\r\nIt always did seem to me that Truth should be self-evident, or at least\r\nsusceptible of unmistakable proof,—which all religions seemed to lack, at\r\nleast in so far as I had known them. I now remember that Jesus furnished\r\nunmistakable proofs of the truth of his teachings, by his manifestations\r\nof the power of Mind, or, as some might call it, Spirit; which power he\r\nplainly taught would be acquired by those who believed in the Principle\r\nwhich he taught, and which manifestations would follow as signs that an\r\nunderstanding of his philosophy had been reached. It does seem to me, that\r\nwhere the signs do not follow professing Christians which Christ said\r\nshould follow them, there must be something wrong, either in his teachings\r\nor their understanding of them; and to say the least, the foundations of\r\ntheir faith require a careful re-examination, with a view to harmonizing\r\nthem with the plain teachings of the Christ in whose footsteps they\r\nprofess to follow.\r\n\r\nI never could understand how God could be ever-present as a personal\r\nBeing, but I think I can and do understand how divine Principle can\r\npervade every thing and place.\r\n\r\nI never could understand how heaven could be a place with gorgeous\r\nfittings, but I think I can and do understand how it might be a spiritual\r\n(or if you please mental) condition. Jesus said, “The kingdom of God\r\ncometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo\r\nthere! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”\r\n\r\n“Knowledge (or understanding) is power.” Since adopting the views of life\r\nas set forth in “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” I have\r\nseen proofs of what can be accomplished through a knowledge of the truth,\r\nwhich to my mind amount to demonstrations, and which no longer seem\r\nincredible, but which I do not ask another to accept upon my statements.\r\nEvery one must see or feel for himself in order to be convinced; but I am\r\nsatisfied that any who will lay aside their preconceived notions, and deal\r\nhonestly with themselves and the light they have, will come to a knowledge\r\nof the truth as illustrated in the teachings and life of Jesus Christ;\r\nthat is, that Mind, or Soul, or whatever you may be pleased to call it, is\r\nthe real Ego, or self, and that mortal mind with its body is the unreal\r\nand vanishing, and eventually goes back to its native nothingness.\r\n\r\nTruth is, and ever has been, simple; and because of its utter simplicity,\r\nwe in our pride and selfishness have been looking right over it. We have\r\nbeen keeping our eyes turned toward the sky, scanning the heavens with a\r\nfar-off gaze in search of light, expecting to see the truth blaze forth\r\nlike some great comet, or in some extraordinary manner; and when, instead\r\nof coming in great pomp and splendor, it appears in the simpleness of\r\ndemonstration, we are staggered at it, and refuse to accept it; our\r\nintellectual pride is shocked, and we are sure that there has been some\r\nmistake. Human nature is ever the same. The Jews were looking for\r\nsomething transcendently wonderful, and the absence of it made the Christ,\r\nTruth, to them a stumbling-block. It was foolishness to the Greeks, who\r\nexcelled in the worldly wisdom of that day; but in all ages of the world\r\nit has ever been the power of God to them that believe, not blindly, but\r\nbecause of an enlightened understanding.\r\n\r\nI always did think that there was something beautiful in the philosophy of\r\nlife as taught by Jesus Christ, but that it was impracticable and not\r\nsusceptible of application to the affairs of life in a world constituted\r\nas this appeared to be. As I now view it, that belief was the result of\r\nignorance of the real power that “moves the universe,”—too much faith in\r\nmatter or effect, and not enough in Mind or cause, which is God.\r\n\r\nTo one who can accept the truth that all causation is in Mind, and who\r\ntherefore begins to look away from matter and into Mind, or Spirit, for\r\nall that is real and eternal, and for all that produces anything that is\r\nlasting, the doubts and petty annoyances of life become dissolved in the\r\nlight of a better understanding, which has been refined in the crucible of\r\ncharity and love; and they fade away into the nothingness from whence they\r\ncame, never having had any existence in fact, being only the inventions of\r\nerring human belief.\r\n\r\nRead the teachings of the Christ from a Christian Science standpoint, and\r\nthey no longer appear vague and mystical, but become luminous and\r\npowerful,—and, let me say, intelligible.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as you intimate, that this theory of life is much more\r\ngenerally accepted by women than by men, and it may be true that as a rule\r\ntheir reasoning is much less rigid in its nature than that of the sterner\r\nsex, and that they may be liable to scan their premises less keenly; but\r\nmay it not also be true, that they are of finer texture and more spiritual\r\nin their natures, and that they may be just as likely to arrive at the\r\ntruth through their intuitions, in connection with their logic, as we are\r\nthrough the more rugged courses? If it be true that man is the more\r\nlogical, the fallibility of our own reasonings very frequently becomes\r\npainfully apparent even to ourselves, and they are therefore not the\r\nsafest gauge by which to judge others.\r\n\r\nI believe, myself, that when it comes to standing up for Truth in the face\r\nof the world, and possibly at the sacrifice of position and popularity,\r\nwomen possess the necessary courage in a much greater degree than do men.\r\n\r\nI had not intended to weary you with such a long letter, but after getting\r\ninto the subject, I hardly knew where to stop. As an old and loved friend,\r\nI have given you a glimpse of my inner life, because I hardly knew how to\r\nexplain my mental condition to you in any other way....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 The order of this sentence has been conformed to the text of the\r\n      1908 edition of Science and Health.
