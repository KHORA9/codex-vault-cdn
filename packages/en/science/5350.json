H. KING, D. Sc.\r\n\r\n1911\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy DR. L. H. BAILEY.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet gathered up the experience of mankind in the tilling\r\nof the earth; yet the tilling of the earth is the bottom condition\r\nof civilization. If we are to assemble all the forces and agencies\r\nthat make for the final conquest of the planet, we must assuredly\r\nknow how it is that all the peoples in all the places have met the\r\nproblem of producing their sustenance out of the soil.\r\n\r\nWe have had few great agricultural travelers and few books that\r\ndescribe the real and significant rural conditions. Of natural\r\nhistory travel we have had very much; and of accounts of sights and\r\nevents perhaps we have had too many. There are, to be sure, famous\r\nbooks of study and travel in rural regions, and some of them, as\r\nArthur Young's \"Travels in France,\" have touched social and\r\npolitical history; but for the most part, authorship of agricultural\r\ntravel is yet undeveloped. The spirit of scientific inquiry must now\r\nbe taken into this field, and all earth-conquest must be compared\r\nand the results be given to the people that work.\r\n\r\nThis was the point of view in which I read Professor King's\r\nmanuscript. It is the writing of a well-trained observer who went\r\nforth not to find diversion or to depict scenery and common wonders,\r\nbut to study the actual conditions of life of agricultural peoples.\r\nWe in North America are wont to think that we may instruct all the\r\nworld in agriculture, because our agricultural wealth is great and\r\nour exports to less favored peoples have been heavy; but this wealth\r\nis great because our soil is fertile and new, and in large acreage\r\nfor every person. We have really only begun to farm well. The first\r\ncondition of farming is to maintain fertility. This condition the\r\noriental peoples have met, and they have solved it in their way. We\r\nmay never adopt particular methods, but we can profit vastly by\r\ntheir experience. With the increase of personal wants in recent\r\ntime. the newer countries may never reach such density of population\r\nas have Japan and China; but we must nevertheless learn the first\r\nlesson in the conservation of natural resources, which are the\r\nresources of the land. This is the message that Professor King\r\nbrought home from the East.\r\n\r\nThis book on agriculture should have good effect in establishing\r\nunderstanding between the West and the East. If there could be such\r\nan interchange of courtesies and inquiries on these themes as is\r\nsuggested by Professor King, as well as the interchange of athletics\r\nand diplomacy and commerce, the common productive people on both\r\nsides should gain much that they could use; and the results in amity\r\nshould be incalculable.\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune that Professor King could not have lived to write\r\nthe concluding \"Message of China and Japan to the World.\" It would\r\nhave been a careful and forceful summary of his study of eastern\r\nconditions. At the moment when the work was going to the printer, he\r\nwas called suddenly to the endless journey and his travel here was\r\nleft incomplete. But he bequeathed us a new piece of literature, to\r\nadd to his standard writings on soils and on the applications of\r\nphysics and devices to agriculture. Whatever he touched he\r\nilluminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nFIRST GLIMPSES OF JAPAN\r\n\r\nGRAVE LANDS OF CHINA\r\n\r\nTO HONGKONG AND CANTON\r\n\r\nUP THE SI-KIANG, WEST RIVER\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF CANALIZATION AND SURFACE FITTING OF FIELDS\r\n\r\nSOME CUSTOMS OF THE COMMON PEOPLE\r\n\r\nTHE FUEL PROBLEM, BUILDING AND TEXTILE MATERIALS\r\n\r\nTRAMPS AFIELD\r\n\r\nTHE UTILIZATION OF WASTE\r\n\r\nIN THE SHANTUNG PROVINCE\r\n\r\nORIENTALS CROWD BOTH TIME AND SPACE\r\n\r\nRICE CULTURE IN THE ORIENT\r\n\r\nSILK CULTURE\r\n\r\nTHE TEA INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nABOUT TIENTSIN\r\n\r\nMANCHURIA AND KOREA\r\n\r\nRETURN TO JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of introduction is needed to place the reader at the best\r\nview point from which to consider what is said in the following\r\npages regarding the agricultural practices and customs of China,\r\nKorea and Japan. It should be borne in mind that the great factors\r\nwhich today characterize, dominate and determine the agricultural\r\nand other industrial operations of western nations were physical\r\nimpossibilities to them one hundred years ago, and until then had\r\nbeen so to all people.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, too, that the United States as yet is a\r\nnation of but few people widely scattered over a broad virgin land\r\nwith more than twenty acres to the support of every man, woman and\r\nchild, while the people whose practices are to be considered are\r\ntoiling in fields tilled more than three thousand years and who have\r\nscarcely more than two acres per capita,* more than one-half of\r\nwhich is uncultivable mountain land.\r\n\r\n*[Footnote: This figure was wrongly stated in the first edition as\r\none acre, owing to a mistake in confusing the area of cultivated\r\nland with total area.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the great movement of cargoes of feeding stuffs and mineral\r\nfertilizers to western Europe and to the eastern United States began\r\nless than a century ago and has never been possible as a means of\r\nmaintaining soil fertility in China, Korea or Japan, nor can it be\r\ncontinued indefinitely in either Europe or America. These\r\nimportations are for the time making tolerable the waste of plant\r\nfood materials through our modern systems of sewage disposal and\r\nother faulty practices; but the Mongolian races have held all such\r\nwastes, both urban and rural, and many others which we ignore,\r\nsacred to agriculture, applying them to their fields.\r\n\r\nWe are to consider some of the practices of a virile race of some\r\nfive hundred millions of people who have an unimpaired inheritance\r\nmoving with the momentum acquired through four thousand years; a\r\npeople morally and intellectually strong, mechanically capable, who\r\nare awakening to a utilization of all the possibilities which\r\nscience and invention during recent years have brought to western\r\nnations; and a people who have long dearly loved peace but who can\r\nand will fight in self defense if compelled to do so.\r\n\r\nWe had long desired to stand face to face with Chinese and Japanese\r\nfarmers; to walk through their fields and to learn by seeing some of\r\ntheir methods, appliances and practices which centuries of stress\r\nand experience have led these oldest farmers in the world to adopt.\r\nWe desired to learn how it is possible, after twenty and perhaps\r\nthirty or even forty centuries, for their soils to be made to\r\nproduce sufficiently for the maintenance of such dense populations\r\nas are living now in these three countries. We have now had this\r\nopportunity and almost every day we were instructed, surprised and\r\namazed at the conditions and practices which confronted us whichever\r\nway we turned; instructed in the ways and extent to which these\r\nnations for centuries have been and are conserving and utilizing\r\ntheir natural resources, surprised at the magnitude of the returns\r\nthey are getting from their fields, and amazed at the amount of\r\nefficient human labor cheerfully given for a daily wage of five\r\ncents and their food, or for fifteen cents, United States currency,\r\nwithout food.\r\n\r\nThe three main islands of Japan in 1907 had a population of\r\n46,977,003 maintained on 20,000 square miles of cultivated field.\r\nThis is at the rate of more than three people to each acre, and of\r\n2,349 to each square mile; and yet the total agricultural imports\r\ninto Japan in 1907 exceeded the agricultural exports by less than\r\none dollar per capita. If the cultivated land of Holland is\r\nestimated at but one-third of her total area, the density of her\r\npopulation in 1905 was, on this basis, less than one-third that of\r\nJapan in her three main islands. At the same time Japan is feeding\r\n69 horses and 56 cattle, nearly all laboring animals, to each square\r\nmile of cultivated field, while we were feeding in 1900 but 30\r\nhorses and mules per same area, these being our laboring animals.\r\n\r\nAs coarse food transformers Japan was maintaining 16,500,000\r\ndomestic fowl, 825 per square mile, but only one for almost three of\r\nher people. We were maintaining, in 1900, 250,600,000 poultry, but\r\nonly 387 per square mile of cultivated field and yet more than three\r\nfor each person. Japan's coarse food transformers in the form of\r\nswine, goats and sheep aggregated but 13 to the square mile and\r\nprovided but one of these units for each 180 of her people while in\r\nthe United States in 1900 there were being maintained, as\r\ntransformers of grass and coarse grain into meat and milk, 95\r\ncattle, 99 sheep and 72 swine per each square mile of improved\r\nfarms. In this reckoning each of the cattle should be counted as the\r\nequivalent of perhaps five of the sheep and swine, for the\r\ntransforming power of the dairy cow is high. On this basis we are\r\nmaintaining at the rate of more than 646 of the Japanese units per\r\nsquare mile, and more than five of these to every man, woman and\r\nchild, instead of one to every 180 of the population, as is the case\r\nin Japan.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly accurate statistics are not accessible for China but\r\nin the Shantung province we talked with a farmer having 12 in his\r\nfamily and who kept one donkey, one cow, both exclusively laboring\r\nanimals, and two pigs on 2.5 acres of cultivated land where he grew\r\nwheat, millet, sweet potatoes and beans. Here is a density of\r\npopulation equal to 3,072 people, 256 donkeys, 256 cattle and 512\r\nswine per square mile. In another instance where the holding was one\r\nand two-thirds acres the farmer had 10 in his family and was\r\nmaintaining one donkey and one pig, giving to this farm land a\r\nmaintenance capacity of 3,840 people, 384 donkeys and 384 pigs to\r\nthe square mile, or 240 people, 24 donkeys and 24 pigs to one of our\r\nforty-acre farms which our farmers regard too small for a single\r\nfamily. The average of seven Chinese holdings which we visited and\r\nwhere we obtained similar data indicates a maintenance capacity for\r\nthose lands of 1,783 people, 212 cattle or donkeys and 399\r\nswine,--1,995 consumers and 399 rough food transformers per square\r\nmile of farm land. These statements for China represent strictly\r\nrural populations. The rural population of the United States in 1900\r\nwas placed at the rate of 61 per square mile of improved farm land\r\nand there were 30 horses and mules. In Japan the rural population\r\nhad a density in 1907 of 1,922 per square mile, and of horses and\r\ncattle together 125.\r\n\r\nThe population of the large island of Chungming in the mouth of the\r\nYangtse river, having an area of 270 square miles, possessed,\r\naccording to the official census of 1902, a density of 3,700 per\r\nsquare mile and yet there was but one large city on the island,\r\nhence the population is largely rural.\r\n\r\nIt could not be other than a matter of the highest industrial,\r\neducational and social importance to all nations if there might be\r\nbrought to them a full and accurate account of all those conditions\r\nwhich have made it possible for such dense populations to be\r\nmaintained so largely upon the products of Chinese, Korean and\r\nJapanese soils. Many of the steps, phases and practices through\r\nwhich this evolution has passed are irrevocably buried in the past\r\nbut such remarkable maintenance efficiency attained centuries ago\r\nand projected into the present with little apparent decadence merits\r\nthe most profound study and the time is fully ripe when it should be\r\nmade. Living as we are in the morning of a century of transition\r\nfrom isolated to cosmopolitan national life when profound\r\nreadjustments, industrial, educational and social, must result, such\r\nan investigation cannot be made too soon. It is high time for each\r\nnation to study the others and by mutual agreement and co-operative\r\neffort, the results of such studies should become available to all\r\nconcerned, made so in the spirit that each should become coordinate\r\nand mutually helpful component factors in the world's progress.\r\n\r\nOne very appropriate and immensely helpful means for attacking this\r\nproblem, and which should prove mutually helpful to citizen and\r\nstate, would be for the higher educational institutions of all\r\nnations, instead of exchanging courtesies through their baseball\r\nteams, to send select bodies of their best students under competent\r\nleadership and by international agreement, both east and west,\r\norganizing therefrom investigating bodies each containing components\r\nof the eastern and western civilization and whose purpose it should\r\nbe to study specifically set problems. Such a movement well\r\nconceived and directed, manned by the most capable young men, should\r\ncreate an international acquaintance and spread broadcast a body of\r\nimportant knowledge which would develop as the young men mature and\r\ncontribute immensely toward world peace and world progress. If some\r\nbroad plan of international effort such as is here suggested were\r\norganized the expense of maintenance might well be met by diverting\r\nso much as is needful from the large sums set aside for the\r\nexpansion of navies for such steps as these, taken in the interests\r\nof world uplift and world peace, could not fail to be more\r\nefficacious and less expensive than increase in fighting equipment.\r\nIt would cultivate the spirit of pulling together and of a square\r\ndeal rather than one of holding aloof and of striving to gain\r\nunneighborly advantage.\r\n\r\nMany factors and conditions conspire to give to the farms and\r\nfarmers of the Far East their high maintenance efficiency and some\r\nof these may be succinctly stated. The portions of China, Korea and\r\nJapan where dense populations have developed and are being\r\nmaintained occupy exceptionally favorable geographic positions so\r\nfar as these influence agricultural production. Canton in the south\r\nof China has the latitude of Havana, Cuba, while Mukden in\r\nManchuria, and northern Honshu in Japan are only as far north as New\r\nYork city, Chicago and northern California. The United States lies\r\nmainly between 50 degrees and 30 degrees of latitude while these\r\nthree countries lie between 40 degrees and 20 degrees, some seven\r\nhundred miles further south. This difference of position, giving\r\nthem longer seasons, has made it possible for them to devise systems\r\nof agriculture whereby they grow two, three and even four crops on\r\nthe same piece of ground each year. In southern China, in Formosa\r\nand in parts of Japan two crops of rice are grown; in the Chekiang\r\nprovince there may be a crop of rape, of wheat or barley or of\r\nwindsor beans or clover which is followed in midsummer by another of\r\ncotton or of rice. In the Shantung province wheat or barley in the\r\nwinter and spring may be followed in summer by large or small\r\nmillet, sweet potatoes, soy beans or peanuts. At Tientsin, 39 deg\r\nnorth, in the latitude of Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Springfield,\r\nIllinois, we talked with a farmer who followed his crop of wheat on\r\nhis small holding with one of onions and the onions with cabbage,\r\nrealizing from the three crops at the rate of $163, gold, per acre;\r\nand with another who planted Irish potatoes at the earliest\r\nopportunity in the spring, marketing them when small, and following\r\nthese with radishes, the radishes with cabbage, realizing from the\r\nthree crops at the rate of $203 per acre.\r\n\r\nNearly 500,000,000 people are being maintained, chiefly upon the\r\nproducts of an area smaller than the improved farm lands of the\r\nUnited States. Complete a square on the lines drawn from Chicago\r\nsouthward to the Gulf and westward across Kansas, and there will be\r\nenclosed an area greater than the cultivated fields of China, Korea\r\nand Japan and from which five times our present population are fed.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall in these countries is not only larger than that even in\r\nour Atlantic and Gulf states, but it falls more exclusively during\r\nthe summer season when its efficiency in crop production may be\r\nhighest. South China has a rainfall of some 80 inches with little of\r\nit during the winter, while in our southern states the rainfall is\r\nnearer 60 inches with less than one-half of it between June and\r\nSeptember. Along a line drawn from Lake Superior through central\r\nTexas the yearly precipitation is about 30 inches but only 16 inches\r\nof this falls during the months May to September; while in the\r\nShantung province, China, with an annual rainfall of little more\r\nthan 24 inches, 17 of these fall during the months designated and\r\nmost of this in July and August. When it is stated that under the\r\nbest tillage and with no loss of water through percolation, most of\r\nour agricultural crops require 300 to 600 tons of water for each ton\r\nof dry substance brought to maturity, it can be readily understood\r\nthat the right amount of available moisture, coming at the proper\r\ntime, must be one of the prime factors of a high maintenance\r\ncapacity for any soil, and hence that in the Far East, with their\r\nintensive methods, it is possible to make their soils yield large\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nThe selection of rice and of the millets as the great staple food\r\ncrops of these three nations, and the systems of agriculture they\r\nhave evolved to realize the most from them, are to us remarkable and\r\nindicate a grasp of essentials and principles which may well cause\r\nwestern nations to pause and reflect.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large and favorable rainfall of these countries,\r\neach of the nations have selected the one crop which permits them to\r\nutilize not only practically the entire amount of rain which falls\r\nupon their fields, but in addition enormous volumes of the run-off\r\nfrom adjacent uncultivable mountain country. Wherever paddy fields\r\nare practicable there rice is grown. In the three main islands of\r\nJapan 56 per cent of the cultivated fields, 11,000 square miles, is\r\nlaid out for rice growing and is maintained under water from\r\ntransplanting to near harvest time, after which the land is allowed\r\nto dry, to be devoted to dry land crops during the balance of the\r\nyear, where the season permits.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who studies the agricultural methods of the Far East in\r\nthe field it is evident that these people, centuries ago, came to\r\nappreciate the value of water in crop production as no other nations\r\nhave. They have adapted conditions to crops and crops to conditions\r\nuntil with rice they have a cereal which permits the most intense\r\nfertilization and at the same time the ensuring of maximum yields\r\nagainst both drought and flood. With the practice of western nations\r\nin all humid climates, no matter how completely and highly we\r\nfertilize, in more years than not yields are reduced by a deficiency\r\nor an excess of water.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey, by word or map, an adequate conception of\r\nthe magnitude of the systems of canalization which contribute\r\nprimarily to rice culture. A conservative estimate would place the\r\nmiles of canals in China at fully 200,000 and there are probably\r\nmore miles of canal in China, Korea and Japan than there are miles\r\nof railroad in the United States. China alone has as many acres in\r\nrice each year as the United States has in wheat and her annual\r\nproduct is more than double and probably threefold our annual wheat\r\ncrop, and yet the whole of the rice area produces at least one and\r\nsometimes two other crops each year.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the quick-maturing, drought-resisting millets as\r\nthe great staple food crops to be grown wherever water is not\r\navailable for irrigation, and the almost universal planting in hills\r\nor drills, permitting intertillage, thus adopting centuries ago the\r\nutilization of earth mulches in conserving soil moisture, has\r\nenabled these people to secure maximum returns in seasons of drought\r\nand where the rainfall is small. The millets thrive in the hot\r\nsummer climates; they survive when the available soil moisture is\r\nreduced to a low limit, and they grow vigorously when the heavy\r\nrains come. Thus we find in the Far East, with more rainfall and a\r\nbetter distribution of it than occurs in the United States, and with\r\nwarmer, longer seasons, that these people have with rare wisdom\r\ncombined both irrigation and dry farming methods to an extent and\r\nwith an intensity far beyond anything our people have ever dreamed,\r\nin order that they might maintain their dense populations.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that in each of these countries the soils\r\nare naturally more than ordinarily deep, inherently fertile and\r\nenduring, judicious and rational methods of fertilization are\r\neverywhere practiced; but not until recent years, and only in Japan,\r\nhave mineral commercial fertilizers been used. For centuries,\r\nhowever, all cultivated lands, including adjacent hill and mountain\r\nsides, the canals, streams and the sea have been made to contribute\r\nwhat they could toward the fertilization of cultivated fields and\r\nthese contributions in the aggregate have been large. In China, in\r\nKorea and in Japan all but the inaccessible portions of their vast\r\nextent of mountain and hill lands have long been taxed to their full\r\ncapacity for fuel, lumber and herbage for green manure and compost\r\nmaterial; and the ash of practically all of the fuel and of all of\r\nthe lumber used at home finds its way ultimately to the fields as\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn China enormous quantities of canal mud are applied to the fields,\r\nsometimes at the rate of even 70 and more tons per acre. So, too,\r\nwhere there are no canals, both soil and subsoil are carried into\r\nthe villages and there between the intervals when needed they are,\r\nat the expense of great labor, composted with organic refuse and\r\noften afterwards dried and pulverized before being carried back and\r\nused on the fields as home-made fertilizers. Manure of all kinds,\r\nhuman and animal, is religiously saved and applied to the fields in\r\na manner which secures an efficiency far above our own practices.\r\nStatistics obtained through the Bureau of Agriculture, Japan, place\r\nthe amount of human waste in that country in 1908 at 23,950,295\r\ntons, or 1.75 tons per acre of her cultivated land. The\r\nInternational Concession of the city of Shanghai, in 1908, sold to a\r\nChinese contractor the privilege of entering residences and public\r\nplaces early in the morning of each day in the year and removing the\r\nnight soil, receiving therefor more than $31,000, gold, for 78,000\r\ntons of waste. All of this we not only throw away but expend much\r\nlarger sums in doing so.\r\n\r\nJapan's production of fertilizing material, regularly prepared and\r\napplied to the land annually, amounts to more than 4.5 tons per acre\r\nof cultivated field exclusive of the commercial fertilizers\r\npurchased. Between Shanhaikwan and Mukden in Manchuria we passed, on\r\nJune 18th, thousands of tons of the dry highly nitrified compost\r\nsoil recently carried into the fields and laid down in piles where\r\nit was waiting to be \"fed to the crops.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1888, and then after a prolonged war of more than\r\nthirty years, generaled by the best scientists of all Europe, that\r\nit was finally conceded as demonstrated that leguminous plants\r\nacting as hosts for lower organisms living on their roots are\r\nlargely responsible for the maintenance of soil nitrogen, drawing it\r\ndirectly from the air to which it is returned through the processes\r\nof decay. But centuries of practice had taught the Far East farmers\r\nthat the culture and use of these crops are essential to enduring\r\nfertility, and so in each of the three countries the growing of\r\nlegumes in rotation with other crops very extensively for the\r\nexpress purpose of fertilizing the soil is one of their old, fixed\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nJust before, or immediately after the rice crop is harvested, fields\r\nare often sowed to \"clover\" (Astragalus sinicus) which is allowed to\r\ngrow until near the next transplanting time when it is either turned\r\nunder directly, or more often stacked along the canals and saturated\r\nwhile doing so with soft mud dipped from the bottom of the canal.\r\nAfter fermenting twenty or thirty days it is applied to the field.\r\nAnd so it is literally true that these old world farmers whom we\r\nregard as ignorant, perhaps because they do not ride sulky plows as\r\nwe do, have long included legumes in their crop rotation, regarding\r\nthem as indispensable.\r\n\r\nTime is a function of every life process as it is of every physical,\r\nchemical and mental reaction. The husbandman is an industrial\r\nbiologist and as such is compelled to shape his operations so as to\r\nconform with the time requirements of his crops. The oriental farmer\r\nis a time economizer beyond all others. He utilizes the first and\r\nlast minute and all that are between. The foreigner accuses the\r\nChinaman of being always long on time, never in a fret, never in a\r\nhurry. This is quite true and made possible for the reason that they\r\nare a people who definitely set their faces toward the future and\r\nlead time by the forelock. They have long realized that much time is\r\nrequired to transform organic matter into forms available for plant\r\nfood and although they are the heaviest users in the world, the\r\nlargest portion of this organic matter is predigested with soil or\r\nsubsoil before it is applied to their fields, and at an enormous\r\ncost of human time and labor, but it practically lengthens their\r\ngrowing season and enables them to adopt a system of multiple\r\ncropping which would not otherwise be possible. By planting in hills\r\nand rows with intertillage it is very common to see three crops\r\ngrowing upon the same field at one time, but in different stages of\r\nmaturity, one nearly ready to harvest one just coming up, and the\r\nother at the stage when it is drawing most heavily upon the soil. By\r\nsuch practice, with heavy fertilization, and by supplemental\r\nirrigation when needful, the soil is made to do full duty throughout\r\nthe growing season.\r\n\r\nThen, notwithstanding the enormous acreage of rice planted each year\r\nin these countries, it is all set in hills and every spear is\r\ntransplanted. Doing this, they save in many ways except in the\r\nmatter of human labor, which is the one thing they have in excess.\r\nBy thoroughly preparing the seed bed, fertilizing highly and giving\r\nthe most careful attention, they are able to grow on one acre,\r\nduring 30 to 50 days, enough plants to occupy ten acres and in the\r\nmean time on the other nine acres crops are maturing, being\r\nharvested and the fields being fitted to receive the rice when it is\r\nready for transplanting, and in effect this interval of time is\r\nadded to their growing season.\r\n\r\nSilk culture is a great and, in some ways, one of the most\r\nremarkable industries of the Orient. Remarkable for its magnitude;\r\nfor having had its birthplace apparently in oldest China at least\r\n2700 years B. C.; for having been laid on the domestication of a\r\nwild insect of the woods; and for having lived through more than\r\n4000 years, expanding until a million-dollar cargo of the product\r\nhas been laid down on our western coast and rushed by special fast\r\nexpress to the cast for the Christmas trade.\r\n\r\nA low estimate of China's production of raw silk would be\r\n120,000,000 pounds annually, and this with the output of Japan,\r\nKorea and a small area of southern Manchuria, would probably exceed\r\n150,000,000 pounds annually, representing a total value of perhaps\r\n$700,000,000, quite equaling in value the wheat crop of the United\r\nStates, but produced on less than one-eighth the area of our wheat\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tea in China and Japan is another of the great\r\nindustries of these nations, taking rank with that of sericulture if\r\nnot above it in the important part it plays in the welfare of the\r\npeople. There is little reason to doubt that this industry has its\r\nfoundation in the need of something to render boiled water palatable\r\nfor drinking purposes. The drinking of boiled water is universally\r\nadopted in these countries as an individually available and\r\nthoroughly efficient safeguard against that class of deadly disease\r\ngerms which thus far it has been impossible to exclude from the\r\ndrinking water of any densely peopled country.\r\n\r\nJudged by the success of the most thorough sanitary measures thus\r\nfar instituted, and taking into consideration the inherent\r\ndifficulties which must increase enormously with increasing\r\npopulations, it appears inevitable that modern methods must\r\nultimately fail in sanitary efficiency and that absolute safety can\r\nbe secured only in some manner having the equivalent effect of\r\nboiling drinking water, long ago adopted by the Mongolian races.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1907 Japan had 124,482 acres of land in tea plantations,\r\nproducing 60,877,975 pounds of cured tea. In China the volume\r\nannually produced is much larger than that of Japan, 40,000,000\r\npounds going annually to Tibet alone from the Szechwan province and\r\nthe direct export to foreign countries was, in 1905, 176,027,255\r\npounds, and in 1906 it was 180,271,000, so that their annual export\r\nmust exceed 200,000,000 pounds with a total annual output more than\r\ndouble this amount of cured tea.\r\n\r\nBut above any other factor, and perhaps greater than all of them\r\ncombined in contributing to the high maintenance efficiency attained\r\nin these countries must be placed the standard of living to which\r\nthe industrial classes have been compelled to adjust themselves,\r\ncombined with their remarkable industry and with the most intense\r\neconomy they practice along every line of effort and of living.\r\n\r\nAlmost every foot of land is made to contribute material for food,\r\nfuel or fabric. Everything which can be made edible serves as food\r\nfor man or domestic animals. Whatever cannot be eaten or worn is\r\nused for fuel. The wastes of the body, of fuel and of fabric worn\r\nbeyond other use are taken back to the field; before doing so they\r\nare housed against waste from weather, compounded with intelligence\r\nand forethought and patiently labored with through one, three or\r\neven six months, to bring them into the most efficient form to serve\r\nas manure for the soil or as feed for the crop. It seems to be a\r\ngolden rule with these industrial classes, or if not golden, then an\r\ninviolable one, that whenever an extra hour or day of labor can\r\npromise even a little larger return then that shall be given, and\r\nneither a rainy day nor the hottest sunshine shall be permitted to\r\ncancel the obligation or defer its execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFIRST GLIMPSES OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the United States from Seattle for Shanghai, China, sailing\r\nby the northern route, at one P. M. February second, reaching\r\nYokohama February 19th and Shanghai, March 1st. It was our aim\r\nthroughout the journey to keep in close contact with the field and\r\ncrop problems and to converse personally, through interpreters or\r\notherwise, with the farmers, gardeners and fruit growers themselves;\r\nand we have taken pains in many cases to visit the same fields or\r\nthe same region two, three or more times at different intervals\r\nduring the season in order to observe different phases of the same\r\ncultural or fertilization methods as these changed or varied with\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nOur first near view of Japan came in the early morning of February\r\n19th when passing some three miles off the point where the Pacific\r\npassenger steamer Dakota was beached and wrecked in broad daylight\r\nwithout loss of life two years ago. The high rounded hills were\r\nclothed neither in the dense dark forest green of Washington and\r\nVancouver, left sixteen days before, nor yet in the brilliant\r\nemerald such as Ireland's hills in June fling in unparalleled\r\ngreeting to passengers surfeited with the dull grey of the rolling\r\nocean. This lack of strong forest growth and even of shrubs and\r\nheavy herbage on hills covered with deep soil, neither cultivated\r\nnor suffering from serious erosion, yet surrounded by favorable\r\nclimatic conditions, was our first great surprise.\r\n\r\nTo the southward around the point, after turning northward into the\r\ndeep bay, similar conditions prevailed, and at ten o'clock we stood\r\noff Uraga where Commodore Perry anchored on July 8th, 1853, bearing\r\nto the Shogun President Fillmore's letter which opened the doors of\r\nJapan to the commerce of the world and, it is to be hoped brought to\r\nher people, with their habits of frugality and industry so indelibly\r\nfixed by centuries of inheritance, better opportunities for\r\ndevelopment along those higher lines destined to make life still\r\nmore worth living.\r\n\r\nAs the Tosa Maru drew alongside the pier at Yokohama it was raining\r\nhard and this had attired an army after the manner of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, dressed as seen in Fig. 1, ready to carry you and yours to\r\nthe Customs house and beyond for one, two, three or five cents.\r\nStrong was the contrast when the journey was reversed and we\r\ndescended the gang plank at Seattle, where no one sought the\r\nopportunity of moving baggage.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Captain Harrison of the Tosa Maru in calling\r\nan interpreter by wireless to meet the steamer, it was possible to\r\nutilize the entire interval of stop in Yokohama to the best\r\nadvantage in the fields and gardens spread over the eighteen miles\r\nof plain extending to Tokyo, traversed by both electric tram and\r\nrailway lines, each running many trains making frequent stops; so\r\nthat this wonderfully fertile and highly tilled district could be\r\nreadily and easily reached at almost any point.\r\n\r\nWe had left home in a memorable storm of snow, sleet and rain which\r\ncut out of service telegraph and telephone lines over a large part\r\nof the United States; we had sighted the Aleutian Islands, seeing\r\nand feeling nothing on the way which could suggest a warm soil and\r\ngreen fields, hence our surprise was great to find the jinricksha\r\nmen with bare feet and legs naked to the thighs, and greater still\r\nwhen we found, before we were outside the city limits, that the\r\nelectric tram was running between fields and gardens green with\r\nwheat, barley, onions, carrots, cabbage and other vegetables. We\r\nwere rushing through the Orient with everything outside the car so\r\nstrange and different from home that the shock came like a bolt of\r\nlightning out of a clear sky.\r\n\r\nIn the car every man except myself and one other was smoking tobacco\r\nand that other was inhaling camphor through an ivory mouthpiece\r\nresembling a cigar holder closed at the end. Several women, tiring\r\nof sitting foreign style, slipped off--I cannot say out of--their\r\nshoes and sat facing the windows, with toes crossed behind them on\r\nthe seat. The streets were muddy from the rain and everybody\r\nJapanese was on rainy-day wooden shoes, the soles carried three to\r\nfour inches above the ground by two cross blocks, in the manner seen\r\nin Fig. 2. A mother, with baby on her back and a daughter of sixteen\r\nyears came into the car. Notwithstanding her high shoes the mother\r\nhad dipped one toe into the mud. Seated, she slipped her foot off.\r\nWithout evident instructions the pretty black-eyed, glossy-haired,\r\nred-lipped lass, with cheeks made rosy, picked up the shoe, withdrew\r\na piece of white tissue paper from the great pocket in her sleeve,\r\ndeftly cleaned the otherwise spotless white cloth sock and then the\r\nshoe, threw the paper on the floor, looked to see that her fingers\r\nwere not soiled, then set the shoe at her mother's foot, which found\r\nits place without effort or glance.\r\n\r\nEverything here was strange and the scenes shifted with the speed of\r\nthe wildest dream. Now it was driving piles for the foundation of a\r\nbridge. A tripod of poles was erected above the pile and from it\r\nhung a pulley. Over the pulley passed a rope from the driving weight\r\nand from its end at the pulley ten cords extended to the ground. In\r\na circle at the foot of the tripod stood ten agile Japanese women.\r\nThey were the hoisting engine. They chanted in perfect rhythm,\r\nhauled and stepped, dropped the weight and hoisted again, making up\r\nfor heavier hammer and higher drop by more blows per minute. When we\r\nreached Shanghai we saw the pile driver being worked from above.\r\nFourteen Chinese men stood upon a raised staging, each with a\r\nseparate cord passing direct from the hand to the weight below. A\r\nconcerted, half-musical chant, modulated to relieve monotony, kept\r\nall hands together. What did the operation of this machine cost?\r\nThirteen cents, gold, per man per day, which covered fuel and\r\nlubricant, both automatically served. Two additional men managed the\r\npiles, two directed the hammer, eighteen manned the outfit. Two\r\ndollars and thirty-four cents per day covered fuel, superintendence\r\nand repairs. There was almost no capital invested in machinery. Men\r\nwere plenty and to spare. Rice was the fuel, cooked without salt,\r\nboiled stiff, reinforced with a hit of pork or fish, appetized with\r\nsalted cabbage or turnip and perhaps two or three of forty and more\r\nother vegetable relishes. And are these men strong and happy? They\r\ncertainly were strong. They are steadily increasing their millions,\r\nand as one stood and watched them at their work their faces were\r\noften wreathed in smiles and wore what seemed a look of satisfaction\r\nand contentment.\r\n\r\nAmong the most common sights on our rides from Yokohama to Tokyo,\r\nboth within the city and along the roads leading to the fields,\r\nstarting early in the morning, were the loads of night soil carried\r\non the shoulders of men and on the backs of animals, but most\r\ncommonly on strong carts drawn by men, bearing six to ten tightly\r\ncovered wooden containers holding forty, sixty or more pounds each.\r\nStrange as it may seem, there are not today and apparently never\r\nhave been, even in the largest and oldest cities of Japan, China or\r\nKorea, anything corresponding to the hydraulic systems of sewage\r\ndisposal used now by western nations. Provision is made for the\r\nremoval of storm waters but when I asked my interpreter if it was\r\nnot the custom of the city during the winter months to discharge its\r\nnight soil into the sea, as a quicker and cheaper mode of disposal,\r\nhis reply came quick and sharp, \"No, that would be waste. We throw\r\nnothing away. It is worth too much money.\" In such public places as\r\nrail way stations provision is made for saving, not for wasting, and\r\neven along the country roads screens invite the traveler to stop,\r\nprimarily for profit to the owner more than for personal\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nBetween Yokohama and Tokyo along the electric car line and not far\r\ndistant from the seashore, there were to be seen in February very\r\nmany long, fence-high screens extending east and west, strongly\r\ninclined to the north, and built out of rice straw, closely tied\r\ntogether and supported on bamboo poles carried upon posts of wood\r\nset in the ground. These screens, set in parallel series of five to\r\nten or more in number and several hundred feet long, were used for\r\nthe purpose of drying varieties of delicate seaweed, these being\r\nspread out in the manner shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe seaweed is first spread upon separate ten by twelve inch straw\r\nmats, forming a thin layer seven by eight inches. These mats are\r\nheld by means of wooden skewers forced through the body of the\r\nscreen, exposing the seaweed to the direct sunshine. After becoming\r\ndry the rectangles of seaweed are piled in bundles an inch thick,\r\ncut once in two, forming packages four by seven inches, which are\r\nneatly tied and thus exposed for sale as soup stock and for other\r\npurposes. To obtain this seaweed from the ocean small shrubs and the\r\nlimbs of trees are set up in the bottom of shallow water, as seen in\r\nFig. 4. To these limbs the seaweeds become attached, grow to\r\nmaturity and are then gathered by hand. By this method of culture\r\nlarge amounts of important food stuff are grown for the support of\r\nthe people on areas otherwise wholly unproductive.\r\n\r\nAnother rural feature, best shown by photograph taken in February,\r\nis the method of training pear orchards in Japan, with their limbs\r\ntied down upon horizontal over-bead trellises at a height under\r\nwhich a man can readily walk erect and easily reach the fruit with\r\nthe hand while standing upon the ground. Pear orchards thus form\r\narbors of greater or less size, the trees being set in quincunx\r\norder about twelve feet apart in and between the rows. Bamboo poles\r\nare used overhead and these carried on posts of the same material\r\n1.5 to 2.5 inches in diameter, to which they are tied. Such a pear\r\norchard is shown in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe limbs of the pear trees are trained strictly in one plane, tying\r\nthem down and pruning out those not desired. As a result the ground\r\nbeneath is completely shaded and every pear is within reach, which\r\nis a great convenience when it becomes desirable to protect the\r\nfruit from insects, by tying paper bags over every pear as seen in\r\nFigs. 6 and 7. The orchard ground is kept free from weeds and not\r\ninfrequently is covered with a layer of rice or other straw,\r\nextensively used in Japan as a ground cover with various crops and\r\nwhen so used is carefully laid in handfuls from bundles, the straws\r\nbeing kept parallel as when harvested.\r\n\r\nTo one from a country of 160-acre farms, with roads four rods wide;\r\nof cities with broad streets and residences with green lawns and\r\nample back yards; and where the cemeteries are large and beautiful\r\nparks, the first days of travel in these old countries force the\r\nover-crowding upon the attention as nothing else can. One feels that\r\nthe cities are greatly over-crowded with houses and shops, and these\r\nwith people and wares; that the country is over-crowded with fields\r\nand the fields with crops; and that in Japan the over-crowding is\r\ngreatest of all in the cemeteries, gravestones almost touching and\r\nmarkers for families literally in bundles at a grave, while round\r\nabout there may be no free country whatever, dwellings, gardens or\r\nrice paddies contesting the tiny allotted areas too closely to leave\r\neven foot-paths between.\r\n\r\nUnless recently modified through foreign influence the streets of\r\nvillages and cities are narrow, as seen in Fig. 8, where however the\r\nstreet is unusually broad. This is a village in the Hakone district\r\non a beautiful lake of the same name, where stands an Imperial\r\nsummer palace, seen near the center of the view on a hill across the\r\nlake. The roofs of the houses here are typical of the neat, careful\r\nthatching with rice straw, very generally adopted in place of tile\r\nfor the country villages throughout much of Japan. The shops and\r\nstores, open full width directly upon the street, are filled to\r\noverflowing, as seen in Fig. 9 and in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nIn the canalized regions of China the country villages crowd both\r\nbanks of a canal, as is the case in Fig. 10. Here, too, often is a\r\nsingle street and it very narrow, very crowded and very busy. Stone\r\nsteps lead from the houses down into the water where clothing,\r\nvegetables, rice and what not are conveniently washed. In this\r\nparticular village two rows of houses stand on one side of the canal\r\nseparated by a very narrow street, and a single row on the other.\r\nBetween the bridge where the camera was exposed and one barely\r\ndiscernible in the background, crossing the canal a third of a mile\r\ndistant, we counted upon one side, walking along the narrow street,\r\neighty houses each with its family, usually of three generations and\r\noften of four. Thus in the narrow strip, 154 feet broad, including\r\n16 feet of street and 30 feet of canal, with its three lines of\r\nhouses. lived no less than 240 families and more than 1200 and\r\nprobably nearer 2000 people.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the crowding of fields in the country nothing except\r\nseeing can tell so forcibly the fact as such landscapes as those of\r\nFigs. 11, 12 and 13, one in Japan, one in Korea and one in China,\r\nnot far from Nanking, looking from the hills across the fields to\r\nthe broad Yangtse kiang, barely discernible as a band of light along\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nThe average area of the rice field in Japan is less than five square\r\nrods and that of her upland fields only about twenty. In the case of\r\nthe rice fields the small size is necessitated partly by the\r\nrequirement of holding water on the sloping sides of the valley, as\r\nseen in Fig. 11. These small areas do not represent the amount of\r\nland worked by one family, the average for Japan being more nearly\r\n2.5 acres. But the lands worked by one family are seldom contiguous,\r\nthey may even be widely scattered and very often rented.\r\n\r\nThe people generally live in villages, going often considerable\r\ndistances to their work. Recognizing the great disadvantage of\r\nscattered holdings broken into such small areas, the Japanese\r\nGovernment has passed laws for the adjustment of farm lands which\r\nhave been in force since 1900. It provides for the exchange of\r\nlands; for changing boundaries; for changing or abolishing roads,\r\nembankments, ridges or canals and for alterations in irrigation and\r\ndrainage which would ensure larger areas with channels and roads\r\nstraightened, made less numerous and less wasteful of time, labor\r\nand land. Up to 1907 Japan had issued permits for the readjustment\r\nof over 240,000 acres, and Fig. 14 is a landscape in one of these\r\nreadjusted districts. To provide capable experts for planning and\r\nsupervising these changes the Government in 1905 intrusted the\r\ntraining of men to the higher agricultural school belonging to the\r\nDai Nippon Agricultural Association and since 1906 the Agricultural\r\nCollege and the Kogyokusha have undertaken the same task and now\r\nthere are men sufficient to push the work as rapidly as desired.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered, too, as showing how, along other fundamental\r\nlines, Japan is taking effective steps to improve the condition of\r\nher people, that she already has her Imperial highways extending\r\nfrom one province to another; her prefectural roads which connect\r\nthe cities and villages within the prefecture; and those more local\r\nwhich serve the farms and villages. Each of the three systems of\r\nroads is maintained by a specific tax levied for the purpose which\r\nis expended under proper supervision, a designated section of road\r\nbeing kept in repair through the year by a specially appointed crew,\r\nas is the practice in railroad maintenance. The result is, Japan has\r\nroads maintained in excellent condition, always narrow, sacrificing\r\nthe minimum of land, and everywhere without fences.\r\n\r\nHow the fields are crowded with crops and all available land is made\r\nto do full duty in these old, long-tilled countries is evident in\r\nFig. 15 where even the narrow dividing ridges but a foot wide, which\r\nretain the water on the rice paddies, are bearing a heavy crop of\r\nsoy beans; and where may be seen the narrow pear orchard standing on\r\nthe very slightest rise of ground, not a foot above the water all\r\naround, which could better be left in grading the paddies to proper\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nHow closely the ground itself may be crowded with plants is seen in\r\nFig. 16, where a young peach orchard, whose tree tops were six feet\r\nthrough, planted in rows twenty-two feet apart, had also ten rows of\r\ncabbage, two rows of large windsor beans and a row of garden peas.\r\nThirteen rows of vegetables in 22 feet, all luxuriant and strong,\r\nand note the judgment shown in placing the tallest plants, needing\r\nthe most sun, in the center between the trees.\r\n\r\nBut these old people, used to crowding and to being crowded, and\r\nlong ago capable of making four blades of grass grow where Nature\r\ngrew but one, have also learned how to double the acreage where a\r\ncrop needs more elbow than it does standing room, as seen in Fig.\r\n17. This man's garden had an area of but 63 by 68 feet and two\r\nsquare rods of this was held sacred to the family grave mound, and\r\nyet his statement of yields, number of crops and prices made his\r\nearning $100 a year on less than one-tenth of an acre.\r\n\r\nHis crop of cucumbers on less than .06 of an acre would bring him\r\n$20. He had already sold $5 worth of greens and a second crop would\r\nfollow the cucumbers. He had just irrigated his garden from an\r\nadjoining canal, using a foot-power pump, and stated that until it\r\nrained he would repeat the watering once per week. It was his wife\r\nwho stood in the garden and, although wearing trousers, her dress\r\nshowed full regard for modesty.\r\n\r\nBut crowding crops more closely in the field not only requires\r\nhigher feeding to bring greater returns, but also relatively greater\r\ncare, closer watchfulness in a hundred ways and a patience far\r\nbeyond American measure; and so, before the crowding of the crops in\r\nthe field and along with it, there came to these very old farmers a\r\ncrowding of the grey matter in the brain with the evolution of\r\neffective texture. This is shown in his fields which crowd the\r\nlandscape. It is seen in the crops which crowd his fields. You see\r\nit in the old man's face, Fig. 18, standing opposite his compeer,\r\nPrince Ching, Fig. 19, each clad in winter dress which is the\r\nembodiment of conversation, retaining the fires of the body for its\r\nown needs, to release the growth on mountain sides for other uses.\r\nAnd when one realizes how, nearly to the extreme limits,\r\nconservation along all important lines is being practiced as an\r\ninherited instinct, there need be no surprise when one reflects that\r\nthe two men, one as feeder and the other as leader, are standing in\r\nthe fore of a body of four hundred millions of people who have\r\nmarched as a nation through perhaps forty centuries, and who now, in\r\nthe light and great promise of unfolding science have their faces\r\nset toward a still more hopeful and longer future.\r\n\r\nOn February 21st the Tosa Maru left Yokohama for Kobe at schedule\r\ntime on the tick of the watch, as she had done from Seattle. All\r\nJapanese steamers appear to be moved with the promptness of a\r\nrailway train. On reaching Kobe we transferred to the Yamaguchi Maru\r\nwhich sailed the following morning, to shorten the time of reaching\r\nShanghai. This left but an afternoon for a trip into the country\r\nbetween Kobe and Osaka, where we found, if possible, even higher and\r\nmore intensive culture practices than on the Tokyo plain, there\r\nbeing less land not carrying a winter crop. And Fig. 20 shows how\r\nclosely the crops crowd the houses and shops. Here were very many\r\ncement lined cisterns or sheltered reservoirs for collecting manures\r\nand preparing fertilizers and the appearance of both soil and crops\r\nshowed in a marked manner to what advantage. We passed a garden of\r\nnearly an acre entirely devoted to English violets just coming into\r\nfull bloom. They were grown in long parallel east and west beds\r\nabout three feet wide. On the north edge of each bed was erected a\r\nrice-straw screen four feet high which inclined to the south,\r\noverhanging the bed at an angle of some thirty-five degrees, thus\r\nforming a sort of bake-oven tent which reflected the sun, broke the\r\nforce of the wind and checked the loss of heat absorbed by the soil.\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Kobe to Moji was made between 10 in the morning,\r\nFebruary 24th, and 5 .30 P. M. of February 25th over a quiet sea\r\nwith an enjoyable ride. Being fogbound during the night gave us the\r\nwhole of Japan's beautiful Inland Sea, enchanting beyond measure, in\r\nall its near and distant beauty but which no pen, no brush, no\r\ncamera may attempt. Only the eye can convey. Before reaching harbor\r\nthe tide had been rising and the strait separating Honshu from\r\nKyushu island was running like a mighty swirling river between Moji\r\nand Shimonoseki, dangerous to attempt in the dark, so we waited\r\nuntil morning.\r\n\r\nThere was cargo to take on board and the steamer must coal. No\r\nsooner had the anchor dropped and the steamer swung into the current\r\nthan lighters came alongside with out-going freight. The small,\r\nstrong, agile Japanese stevedores had this task completed by 8:30 P.\r\nM. and when we returned to the deck after supper another scene was\r\non. The cargo lighters had gone and four large barges bearing 250\r\ntons of coal had taken their places on opposite sides of the\r\nsteamer, each illuminated with buckets of blazing coal or by burning\r\nconical heaps on the surface. From the bottom of these pits in the\r\ndarkness the illumination suggested huge decapitated ant heaps in\r\nthe wildest frenzy, for the coal seemed covered and there was hurry\r\nin every direction. Men and women, boys and girls, bending to their\r\ntasks, were filling shallow saucer-shaped baskets with coal and\r\nstacking them eight to ten high in a semi-circle, like coin for\r\ndelivery. Rising out of these pits sixteen feet up the side of the\r\nsteamer and along her deck to the chutes leading to her bunkers were\r\nwhat seemed four endless human chains, in service the prototype of\r\nour modern conveyors, but here each link animated by its own power.\r\nUp these conveyors the loaded buckets passed, one following another\r\nat the rate of 40 to 60 per minute, to return empty by the\r\ndescending line, and over the four chains one hundred tons per hour,\r\nfor 250 tons of coal passed to the bunkers in two and a half hours.\r\nBoth men and women stood in the line and at the upper turn of one of\r\nthese, emptying the buckets down the chute, was a mother with her\r\ntwo-year-old child in the sling on back, where it rocked and swayed\r\nto and fro, happy the entire time. It was often necessary for the\r\nmother to adjust her baby in the sling whenever it was leaning\r\nuncomfortably too far to one side or the other, but she did it\r\nskillfully, always with a shrug of the shoulders, for both hands\r\nwere full. The mother looked strong, was apparently accepting her\r\nlot as a matter of course and often, with a smile, turned her face\r\nto the child, who patted it and played with her ears and hair.\r\nProbably her husband was doing his part in a more strenuous place in\r\nthe chain and neither had time to be troubled with affinities for it\r\nwas 10:30 P. M. when the baskets stopped, and somewhere no doubt\r\nthere was a home to be reached and perhaps supper to get. Shall we\r\nbe able, when our numbers have vastly increased, to permit all\r\nneedful earnings to be acquired in a better way?\r\n\r\nWe left Moji in the early morning and late in the evening of the\r\nsame day entered the beautiful harbor of Nagasaki, all on board\r\nwaiting until morning for a launch to go ashore. We were to sail\r\nagain at noon so available time for observation was short and we set\r\nout in a ricksha at once for our first near view of terraced\r\ngardening on the steep hillsides in Japan. In reaching them and in\r\nreturning our course led through streets paved with long, thick and\r\nnarrow stone blocks, having deep open gutters on one or both sides\r\nclose along the houses, into which waste water was emptied and\r\nthrough which the storm waters found their way to the sea. Few of\r\nthese streets were more than twelve feet wide and close watching,\r\nwith much dodging, was required to make way through them. Here, too,\r\nthe night soil of the city was being removed in closed receptacles\r\non the shoulders of men, on the backs of horses and cattle and on\r\ncarts drawn by either. Other men and women were hurrying along with\r\nbaskets of vegetables well illustrated in Fig. 21, some with fresh\r\ncabbage, others with high stacks of crisp lettuce, some with\r\nmonstrous white radishes or turnips, others with bundles of onions,\r\nall coming down from the terraced gardens to the markets. We passed\r\nloads of green bamboo poles just cut, three inches in diameter at\r\nthe butt and twenty feet long, drawn on carts. Both men and women\r\nwere carrying young children and older ones were playing and singing\r\nin the street. Very many old women, some feeble looking, moved,\r\nloaded, through the throng. Homely little dogs, an occasional lean\r\ncat, and hens and roosters scurried across the street from one low\r\nmarket or store to another. Back of the rows of small stores and\r\nshops fronting on the clean narrow streets were the dwellings whose\r\nexits seemed to open through the stores, few or no open courts of\r\nany size separating them from the market or shop. The opportunity\r\nwhich the oriental housewife may have in the choice of vegetables on\r\ngoing to the market, and the attractive manner of displaying such\r\nproducts in Japan, are seen in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached one of the terraced hillsides which rise five\r\nhundred to a thousand feet above the harbor with sides so steep that\r\ngarden areas have a width of seldom more than twenty to thirty feet\r\nand often less, while the front of each terrace may be a stone wall,\r\nsometimes twelve feet high, often more than six, four and five feet\r\nbeing the most common height. One of these hillside slopes is seen\r\nin Fig. 23. These terraced gardens are both short and narrow and\r\nmost of them bounded by stone walls on three sides, suggesting house\r\nfoundations, the two end walls sloping down the hill from the height\r\nof the back terrace, dropping to the ground level in front, these\r\nforming foot-paths leading up the slope occasionally with one, two\r\nor three steps in places.\r\n\r\nEach terrace sloped slightly down the hill at a small angle and had\r\na low ridge along the front. Around its entire border a narrow drain\r\nor furrow was arranged to collect surface water and direct it to\r\ndrainage channels or into a catch basin where it might be put back\r\non the garden or be used in preparing liquid fertilizer. At one\r\ncorner of many of these small terraced gardens were cement lined\r\npits, used both as catch basins for water and as receptacles for\r\nliquid manure or as places in which to prepare compost. Far up the\r\nsteep paths, too, along either side, we saw many piles of stable\r\nmanure awaiting application, all of which had been brought up the\r\nslopes in backets on bamboo poles, carried on the shoulders of men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nGRAVE LANDS OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe launch had returned the passengers to the steamer at 11:30; the\r\ncaptain was on the bridge; prompt to the minute at the call \"Hoist\r\naway\" the signal went below and the Yamaguchi's whistle filled the\r\nharbor and over-flowed the hills. The cable wound in, and at twelve,\r\nnoon, we were leaving Nagasaki, now a city of 153,000 and the\r\nwestern doorway of a nation of fifty-one millions of people but of\r\nlittle importance before the sixteenth century when it became the\r\nchief mart of Portuguese trade. We were to pass the Koreans on our\r\nright and enter the portals of a third nation of four hundred\r\nmillions. We had left a country which had added eighty-five millions\r\nto its population in one hundred years and which still has twenty\r\nacres for each man, woman and child, to pass through one which has\r\nbut one and a half acres per capita, and were going to another whose\r\nallotment of acres, good and bad, is less than 2.4. We had gone from\r\npractices by which three generations had exhausted strong virgin\r\nfields, and were coming to others still fertile after thirty\r\ncenturies of cropping. On January 30th we crossed the head waters of\r\nthe Mississippi-Missouri, four thousand miles from its mouth, and on\r\nMarch 1st were in the mouth of the Yangtse river whose waters are\r\ngathered from a basin in which dwell two hundred millions of people.\r\n\r\nThe Yamaguchi reached Woosung in the night and anchored to await\r\nmorning and tide before ascending the Hwangpoo, believed by some\r\ngeographers to be the middle of three earlier delta arms of the\r\nYangtse kiang, the southern entering the sea at Hangchow 120 miles\r\nfurther south, the third being the present stream. As we wound\r\nthrough this great delta plain toward Shanghai, the city of foreign\r\nconcessions to all nationalities, the first striking feature was the\r\n\"graves of the fathers\", of \"the ancestors\". At first the numerous\r\ngrass-covered hillocks dotting the plain seemed to be stacks of\r\ngrain or straw; then came the query whether they might not be huge\r\ncompost heaps awaiting distribution in the fields, but as the river\r\nbrought us nearer to them we seemed to be moving through a land of\r\nancient mound builders and Fig. 24 shows, in its upper section,\r\ntheir appearance as seen in the distance.\r\n\r\nAs the journey led on among the fields, so large were the mounds,\r\noften ten to twelve feet high and twenty or more feet at the base;\r\nso grass-covered and apparently neglected; so numerous and so\r\nirregularly scattered, without apparent regard for fields, that when\r\nwe were told these were graves we could not give credence to the\r\nstatement, but before the city was reached we saw places where, by\r\nthe shifting of the channel, the river had cut into some of these\r\nmounds, exposing brick vaults, some so low as to be under water part\r\nof the time, and we wonder if the fact does not also record a slow\r\nsubsidence of the delta plain under the ever increasing load of\r\nriver silt.\r\n\r\nA closer view of these graves in the same delta plain is given in\r\nthe lower section of Fig. 24, where they are seen in the midst of\r\nfields and to occupy not only large areas of valuable land but to be\r\nmuch in the way of agricultural operations. A still closer view of\r\nother groups, with a farm village in the background, is shown in the\r\nmiddle section of the same illustration, and here it is better seen\r\nhow large is the space occupied by them. On the right in the same\r\nview may be seen a line of six graves surmounting a common lower\r\nbase which is a type of the larger and higher ones so suggestive of\r\nbuildings seen in the horizon of the upper section.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we went in China, about all of the very old and large\r\ncities, the proportion of grave land to cultivated fields is very\r\nlarge. In the vicinity of Canton Christian college, on Honam island,\r\nmore than fifty per cent of the land was given over to graves and in\r\nmany places they were so close that one could step from one to\r\nanother. They are on the higher and dryer lands, the cultivated\r\nareas occupying ravines and the lower levels to which water may be\r\nmore easily applied and which are the most productive. Hilly lands\r\nnot so readily cultivated, and especially if within reach of cities,\r\nare largely so used, as seen in Fig. 25, where the graves are marked\r\nby excavated shelves rather than by mounds, as on the plains. These\r\ngrave lands are not altogether unproductive for they are generally\r\novergrown with herbage of one or another kind and used as pastures\r\nfor geese, sheep, goats and cattle, and it is not at all uncommon,\r\nwhen riding along a canal, to see a huge water buffalo projected\r\nagainst the sky from the summit of one of the largest and highest\r\ngrave mounds within reach. If the herbage is not fed off by animals\r\nit is usually cut for feed, for fuel, for green manure or for use in\r\nthe production of compost to enrich the soil.\r\n\r\nCaskets may be placed directly upon the surface of a field, encased\r\nin brick vaults with tile roofs, forming such clusters as was seen\r\non the bank of the Grand Canal in Chekiang province, represented in\r\nthe lower section of Fig. 26, or they may stand singly in the midst\r\nof a garden, as in the upper section of the same figure; in a rice\r\npaddy entirely surrounded by water parts of the year, and indeed in\r\nalmost any unexpected place. In Shanghai in 1898, 2,763 exposed\r\ncoffined corpses were removed outside the International Settlement\r\nor buried by the authorities.\r\n\r\nFurther north, in the Shantung province, where the dry season is\r\nmore prolonged and where a severe drought had made grass short, the\r\ngrave lands had become nearly naked soil, as seen in Fig. 27 where a\r\nShantung farmer had just dug a temporary well to irrigate his little\r\nfield of barley. Within the range of the camera, as held to take\r\nthis view, more than forty grave mounds besides the seven near by,\r\nare near enough to be fixed on the negative and be discernible under\r\na glass, indicating what extensive areas of land, in the aggregate,\r\nare given over to graves.\r\n\r\nStill further north, in Chihli, a like story is told in, if\r\npossible, more emphatic manner and fully vouched for in the next\r\nillustration, Fig. 28, which shows a typical family group, to be\r\nobserved in so many places between Taku and Tientsin and beyond\r\ntoward Peking. As we entered the mouth of the Pei-ho for Tientsin,\r\nfar away to the vanishing horizon there stretched an almost naked\r\nplain except for the vast numbers of these \"graves of the fathers\",\r\nso strange, so naked, so regular in form and so numerous that more\r\nthan an hour of our journey had passed before we realized that they\r\nwere graves and that the country here was perhaps more densely\r\npeopled with the dead than with the living. In so many places there\r\nwas the huge father grave, often capped with what in the distance\r\nsuggested a chimney, and the many associated smaller ones, that it\r\nwas difficult to realize in passing what they were.\r\n\r\nIt is a common custom, even if the residence has been permanently\r\nchanged to some distant province, to take the bodies back for\r\ninterment in the family group; and it is this custom which leads to\r\nthe practice of choosing a temporary location for the body, waiting\r\nfor a favorable opportunity to remove it to the family group. This\r\nis often the occasion for the isolated coffin so frequently seen\r\nunder a simple thatch of rice straw, as in Fig. 29; and the many\r\nsmall stone jars containing skeletons of the dead, or portions of\r\nthem, standing singly or in rows in the most unexpected places least\r\nin the way in the crowded fields and gardens, awaiting removal to\r\nthe final resting place. It is this custom, too, I am told, which\r\nhas led to placing a large quantity of caustic lime in the bottom of\r\nthe casket, on which the body rests, this acting as an effective\r\nabsorbent.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom in some parts of China, if not in all, to\r\nperiodically restore the mounds, maintaining their height and size,\r\nas is seen in the next two illustrations, and to decorate these once\r\nin the year with flying streamers of colored paper, the remnants of\r\nwhich may be seen in both Figs. 30 and 31, set there as tokens that\r\nthe paper money has been burned upon them and its essence sent up in\r\nthe smoke for the maintenance of the spirits of their departed\r\nfriends. We have our memorial day; they have for centuries observed\r\ntheirs with religious fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe usual expense of a burial among the working people is said to be\r\n$100, Mexican, an enormous burden when the day's wage or the yearly\r\nearning of the family is considered and when there is added to this\r\nthe yearly expense of ancestor worship. How such voluntary burdens\r\nare assumed by people under such circumstances is hard to\r\nunderstand. Missionaries assert it is fear of evil consequences in\r\nthis life and of punishment and neglect in the hereafter that leads\r\nto assuming them. Is it not far more likely that such is the price\r\nthese people are willing to pay for a good name among the living and\r\nbecause of their deep and lasting friendship for the departed? Nor\r\ndoes it seem at all strange that a kindly, warm-hearted people with\r\nstrong filial affection should have reached, carry in their long\r\nhistory, a belief in one spirit of the departed which hovers about\r\nthe home, one which hovers about the grave and another which wanders\r\nabroad, for surely there are associations with each of these\r\nconditions which must long and forcefully awaken memories of friends\r\ngone. If this view is possible may not such ancestral worship be an\r\nindex of qualities of character strongly fixed and of the highest\r\nworth which, when improvements come that may relieve the heavy\r\nburdens now carried, will only shine more brightly and count more\r\nfor right living as well as comfort?\r\n\r\nEven in our own case it will hardly be maintained that our burial\r\ncustoms have reached their best and final solution, for in all\r\ncivilized nations they are unnecessarily expensive and far too\r\ncumbersome. It is only necessary to mentally add the accumulation of\r\na few centuries to our cemeteries to realize how impossible our\r\npractice must become. Clearly there is here a very important line\r\nfor betterment which all nationalities should undertake.\r\n\r\nWhen the steamer anchored at Shanghai the day was pleasant and the\r\nrain coats which greeted us in Yokohama were not in evidence but the\r\nnumbers who had met the steamer in the hope of an opportunity for\r\nearning a trifle was far greater and in many ways in strong contrast\r\nwith the Japanese. We were much surprised to find the men of so\r\nlarge stature, much above the Chinese usually seen in the United\r\nStates. They were fully the equal of large Americans in frame but\r\nquite without surplus flesh yet few appeared underfed. To realize\r\nthat these are strong, hardy men it was only necessary to watch them\r\ncarrying on their shoulders bales of cotton between them, supported\r\nby a strong bamboo; while the heavy loads they transport on\r\nwheel-barrows through the country over long distances, as seen in\r\nFig. 32, prove their great endurance. This same type of vehicle,\r\ntoo, is one of the common means of transporting people, especially\r\nChinese women, and four six and even eight may be seen riding\r\ntogether, propelled by a single wheelbarrow man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTO HONGKONG AND CANTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had come to learn how the old-world farmers bad been able to\r\nprovide materials for food and clothing on such small areas for so\r\nmany millions, at so low a price, during so many centuries, and were\r\nanxious to see them at the soil and among the crops. The sun was\r\nstill south of the equator, coming north only about twelve miles per\r\nday, so, to save time, we booked on the next steamer for Hongkong to\r\nmeet spring at Canton, beyond the Tropic of Cancer, six hundred\r\nmiles farther south, and return with her.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 4th the Tosa Maru steamed out into the\r\nYangtse river, already flowing with the increased speed of ebb tide.\r\nThe pilots were on the bridge to guide her course along the narrow\r\nsouth channel through waters seemingly as brown and turbid as the\r\nPotomac after a rain. It was some distance beyond Gutzlaff Island,\r\nseventy miles to sea, where there is a lighthouse and a telegraph\r\nstation receiving six cables, that we crossed the front of the\r\nout-going tide, showing in a sharp line of contrast stretching in\r\neither direction farther than the eye could see, across the course\r\nof the ship and yet it was the season of low water in this river.\r\nDuring long ages this stream of mighty volume has been loading upon\r\nitself in far-away Tibet, without dredge, barge, fuel or human\r\neffort, unused and there unusable soils, bringing them down from\r\ninaccessible heights across two or three thousand miles, building up\r\nwith them, from under the sea, at the gateways of commerce, miles\r\nupon miles of the world's most fertile fields and gardens. Today on\r\nthis river, winding through six hundred miles of the most highly\r\ncultivated fields, laid out on river-built plains, go large ocean\r\nsteamers to the city of Hankow-Wuchang-Hanyang where 1,770,000\r\npeople live and trade within a radius less than four miles; while\r\nsmaller steamers push on a thousand miles and are then but 130 feet\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\nEven now, with the aid of current, tide and man, these brown turbid\r\nwaters are rapidly adding fertile delta plains for new homes. During\r\nthe last twenty-five years Chungming island has grown in length some\r\n1800 feet per year and today a million people are living and growing\r\nrice, wheat, cotton and sweet potatoes on 270 square miles of\r\nfertile plain where five hundred years ago were only submerged river\r\nsands and silt. Here 3700 people per square mile have acquired\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nThe southward voyage was over a quiet sea and as we passed among and\r\nnear the off-shore islands these, as seen in Japan, appeared\r\ndestitute of vegetation other than the low herbaceous types with few\r\nshrubs and almost no forest growth and little else that gave the\r\nappearance of green. Captain Harrison informed me that at no time in\r\nthe year are these islands possessed of the grass-green verdure so\r\noften seen in northern climates, and yet the islands lie in a region\r\nof abundant summer rain, making it hard to understand why there is\r\nnot a more luxuriant growth.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, March 7th, passing first extensive sugar refineries,\r\nfound us entering the long, narrow and beautiful harbor of Hongkong.\r\nHere, lying at anchor in the ten square miles of water, were five\r\nbattleships, several large ocean steamers, many coastwise vessels\r\nand a multitude of smaller craft whose yearly tonnage is twenty to\r\nthirty millions. But the harbor lies in the track of the terrible\r\nEast Indian typhoon and, although sheltered on the north shore of a\r\nhigh island, one of these storms recently sunk nine vessels, sent\r\ntwenty-three ashore, seriously damaged twenty-one others, wrought\r\ngreat destruction among the smaller craft and over a thousand dead\r\nwere recovered. Such was the destruction wrought by the September\r\nstorm of 1906.\r\n\r\nOur steamer did not go to dock but the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's launch\r\ntransferred us to a city much resembling Seattle in possessing a\r\nscant footing between a long sea front and high steep mountain\r\nslopes behind. Here cliffs too steep to climb rise from the very\r\nsidewalk and are covered with a great profusion and variety of\r\nferns, small bamboo, palms, vines, many flowering shrubs, all\r\ninterspersed with pine and great banyan trees that do so much toward\r\nadding the beauty of northern landscapes to the tropical features\r\nwhich reach upward until hidden in a veil of fog that hung, all of\r\nthe time we were there, over the city, over the harbor and stretched\r\nbeyond Old and New Kowloon.\r\n\r\nHongkong island is some eleven miles long and but two to five miles\r\nwide, while the peak carrying the signal staff rises 1,825 feet\r\nabove the streets from which ascends the Peak tramway, where,\r\nhanging from opposite ends of a strong cable, one car rises up the\r\nslope and another descends every fifteen to twenty minutes,\r\naffording communication with business houses below and homes in\r\nbeautiful surroundings and a tempered climate above. Extending along\r\nthe slopes of the mountains, too, above the city, are very excellent\r\nroads, carefully graded, provided with concrete gutters and bridges,\r\nalong which one may travel on foot, on horseback, by ricksha or\r\nsedan chair, but too narrow for carriages. Over one of these we\r\nascended along one side of Happy Valley, around its head and down\r\nthe other side. Only occasionally could we catch glimpses of the\r\nsummit through the lifting fog but the views, looking down and\r\nacross the city and beyond the harbor with its shipping, and up and\r\ndown the many ravines from via-ducts, are among the choicest and\r\nrarest ever made accessible to the residents of any city. It was the\r\nbeginning of the migratory season for birds, and trees and shrubbery\r\nthronged with many species.\r\n\r\nMany of the women in Hongkong were seen engaged in such heavy manual\r\nlabor with the men as carrying crushed rock and sand, for concrete\r\nand macadam work, up the steep street slopes long distances from the\r\ndock, but they were neither tortured nor incapacitated by bound\r\nfeet. Like the men, they were of smaller stature than most seen at\r\nShanghai and closely resemble the Chinese in the United States. Both\r\nsexes are agile, wiry and strong. Here we first saw lumber sawing in\r\nthe open streets after the manner shown in Fig. 33, where wide\r\nboards were being cut from camphor logs. In the damp, already warm\r\nweather the men were stripped to the waist, their limbs bare to\r\nabove the knee, and each carried a large towel for wiping away the\r\nprofuse perspiration.\r\n\r\nIt was here, too, that we first met the remarkable staging for the\r\nerection of buildings of four and six stories, set up without saw,\r\nhammer or nail; without injury to or waste of lumber and with the\r\nminimum of labor in construction and removal. Poles and bamboo stems\r\nwere lashed together with overlapping ends, permitting any interval\r\nor height to be secured without cutting or nailing, and admitting of\r\nready removal with absolutely no waste, all parts being capable of\r\nrepeated use unless it be some of the materials employed in tying\r\nmembers. Up inclined stairways, from staging to staging, in the\r\nerection of six-story granite buildings, mortar was being carried in\r\nbaskets swinging from bamboo poles on the shoulders of men and\r\nwomen, as the cheapest hoists available in English Hongkong where\r\nthere is willing human labor and to spare.\r\n\r\nThe Singer sewing machine, manufactured in New Jersey, was seen in\r\nmany Chinese shops in Hongkong and other cities, operated by Chinese\r\nmen and women, purchased, freight prepaid, at two-thirds the retail\r\nprice in the United States. Such are the indications of profit to\r\nmanufacturers on the home sale of home-made goods while at the same\r\ntime reaping good returns from a large trade in heathen lands, after\r\npaying the freight.\r\n\r\nIndustrial China, Korea and Japan do not observe our weekly day of\r\nrest and during our walk around Happy Valley on Sunday afternoon,\r\nlooking down upon its terraced gardens and tiny fields, we saw men\r\nand women busy fitting the soil for new crops, gathering vegetables\r\nfor market, feeding plants with liquid manure and even irrigating\r\ncertain crops, notwithstanding the damp, foggy, showery weather.\r\nTurning the head of the valley, attention was drawn to a walled\r\nenclosure and a detour down the slope brought us to a florist's\r\ngarden within which were rows of large potted foliage plants of\r\nsemi-shrubbery habit, seen in Fig. 35, trained in the form of\r\nlife-size human figures with limbs, arms and trunk provided with\r\nhighly glazed and colored porcelain feet, hands and head. These,\r\nwith many other potted plants and trees, including dwarf varieties,\r\nare grown under out-door lattice shelters in different parts of\r\nChina, for sale to the wealthy Chinese families.\r\n\r\nHow thorough is the tillage, how efficient and painstaking the\r\ngarden fitting, and how closely the ground is crowded to its upper\r\nlimit of producing power are indicated in Fig. 36; and when one\r\nstops and studies the detail in such gardens he expects in its\r\nexecutor an orderly, careful, frugal and industrious man, getting\r\nnot a little satisfaction out of his creations however arduous his\r\ntask or prolonged his day. If he is in the garden or one meets him\r\nat the house, clad as the nature of his duties and compensation have\r\ndetermined, you may be disappointed or feel arising an unkind\r\njudgment. But who would risk a reputation so clad and so environed?\r\nMany were the times, during our walks in the fields and gardens\r\namong these old, much misunderstood, misrepresented and undervalued\r\npeople, when the bond of common interest was recognized between us,\r\nthat there showed through the face the spirit which put aside both\r\ndress and surroundings and the man stood forth who, with fortitude\r\nand rare wisdom, is feeding the millions and who has carried through\r\ncenturies the terrible burden of taxes levied by dishonor and\r\nneedless wars. Nay, more than this, the man stood forth who has kept\r\nalive the seeds of manhood and has nourished them into such sturdy\r\nstock as has held the stream of progress along the best interests of\r\ncivilization in spite of the driftwood heaped upon it.\r\n\r\nNot only are these people extremely careful and painstaking in\r\nfitting their fields and gardens to receive the crop, but they are\r\neven more scrupulous in their care to make everything that can\r\npossibly serve as fertilizer for the soil, or food for the crop\r\nbeing grown, do so unless there is some more remunerative service it\r\nmay render. Expense is incurred to provide such receptacles as are\r\nseen in Fig. 37 for receiving not only the night soil of the home\r\nand that which may be bought or otherwise procured, but in which may\r\nbe stored any other fluid which can serve as plant food. On the\r\nright of these earthenware jars too is a pile of ashes and one of\r\nmanure. All such materials are saved and used in the most\r\nadvantageous ways to enrich the soil or to nourish the plants being\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nGenerally the liquid manures must be diluted with water to a greater\r\nor less extent before they are \"fed\", as the Chinese say, to their\r\nplants, hence there is need of an abundant and convenient water\r\nsupply. One of these is seen in Fig. 38, where the Chinaman has\r\nadopted the modern galvanized iron pipe to bring water from the\r\nmountain slope of Happy Valley to his garden. By the side of this\r\ntank are the covered pails in which the night soil was brought,\r\nperhaps more than a mile, to be first diluted and then applied. But\r\nthe more general method for supplying water is that of leading it\r\nalong the ground in channels or ditches to a small reservoir in one\r\ncorner of a terraced field or garden, as seen in Fig. 39, where it\r\nis held and the surplus led down from terrace to terrace, giving\r\neach its permanent supply. At the upper right corner of the\r\nengraving may be seen two manure receptacles and a third stands near\r\nthe reservoir. The plants on the lower terrace are water cress and\r\nthose above the same. At this time of the year, on the terraced\r\ngardens of Happy Valley, this is one of the crops most extensively\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nWalking among these gardens and isolated homes, we passed a pig pen\r\nprovided with a smooth, well-laid stone floor that had just been\r\nwashed scrupulously clean, like the floor of a house. While I was\r\nnot able to learn other facts regarding this case, I have little\r\ndoubt that the washings from this floor had been carefully collected\r\nand taken to some receptacle to serve as a plant food.\r\n\r\nLooking backward as we left Hongkong for Canton on the cloudy\r\nevening of March 8th, the view was wonderfully beautiful. We were\r\ndrawing away from three cities, one, electric-lighted Hongkong\r\nrising up the steep slopes, suggesting a section of sky set with a\r\nvast array of stars of all magnitudes up to triple Jupiters;\r\nanother, old and new Kowloon on the opposite side of the harbor; and\r\nbetween these two, separated from either shore by wide reaches of\r\nwholly unoccupied water, lay the third, a mid-strait city of\r\nsampans, junks and coastwise craft of many kinds segregated, in\r\nobedience to police regulation, into blocks and streets with each\r\nsetting sun, but only to scatter again with the coming morn. At\r\nnight, after a fixed hour, no one is permitted to leave shore and\r\ncross the vacant water strip except from certain piers and with the\r\npermission of the police, who take the number of the sampan and the\r\nnames of its occupants. Over the harbor three large search lights\r\nwere sweeping and it was curious to see the junks and other craft\r\nsuddenly burst into full blazes of light, like so many monstrous\r\nfire-flies, to disappear and reappear as the lights came and went.\r\nThus is the mid-strait city lighted and policed and thus have steps\r\nbeen taken to lessen the number of cases of foul play where people\r\nhave left the wharves at night for some vessel in the strait, never\r\nto be heard from again.\r\n\r\nSome ninety miles is the distance by water to Canton, and early the\r\nnext morning our steamer dropped anchor off the foreign settlement\r\nof Shameen. Through the kindness of Consul-General Amos P. Wilder in\r\nsending a telegram to the Canton Christian College, their little\r\nsteam launch met the boat and took us directly to the home of the\r\ncollege on Honam Island, lying in the great delta south of the city\r\nwhere sediments brought by the Si-kiang--west, Pei-kiang--north, and\r\nTung-kiang--east--rivers through long centuries have been building\r\nthe richest of land which, because of the density of population, are\r\nsquared up everywhere to the water's edge and appropriated as fast\r\nas formed, and made to bring forth materials for food fuel and\r\nraiment in vast quantities.\r\n\r\nIt was on Honam Island that we walked first among the grave lands\r\nand came to know them as such, for Canton Christian College stands\r\nin the midst of graves which, although very old, are not permitted\r\nto be disturbed and the development of the campus must wait to\r\nsecure permission to remove graves, or erect its buildings in places\r\nnot the most desirable. Cattle were grazing among the graves and\r\nwith them a flock of some 250 of the brown Chinese geese, two-thirds\r\ngrown, was watched by boys, gleaning their entire living from the\r\ngrave lands and adjacent water. A mature goose sells in Canton for\r\n$1.20, Mexican, or less than 52 cents, gold, but even then how can\r\nthe laborer whose day's wage is but ten or fifteen cents afford one\r\nfor his family? Here, too, we saw the Chinese persistent,\r\nnever-ending industry in keeping their land, their sunshine and\r\ntheir rain, with themselves, busy in producing something needful.\r\nFields which had matured two crops of rice during the long summer,\r\nhad been laboriously, and largely by hand labor, thrown into strong\r\nridges as seen in Fig. 40, to permit still a third winter crop of\r\nsome vegetable to be taken from the land.\r\n\r\nBut this intensive, continuous cropping of the land spells soil\r\nexhaustion and creates demands for maintenance and restoration of\r\navailable plant food or the adding of large quantities of something\r\nquickly convertible into it, and so here in the fields on Honam\r\nIsland, as we had found in Happy Valley, there was abundant evidence\r\nof the most careful attention and laborious effort devoted to plant\r\nfeeding. The boat standing in the canal in Fig. 41 had come from\r\nCanton in the early morning with two tons of human manure and men\r\nwere busy applying it, in diluted form, to beds of leeks at the rate\r\nof 16,000 gallons per acre, all carried on the shoulders in such\r\npails as stand in the foreground. The material is applied with\r\nlong-handled dippers holding a gallon, dipping it from the pails,\r\nthe men wading, with bare feet and trousers rolled above the knees,\r\nin the water of the furrows between the beds. This is one of their\r\nways of \"feeding the crop,\" and they have other methods of \"manuring\r\nthe soil.\"\r\n\r\nOne of these we first met on Honam Island. Large amounts of canal\r\nmud are here collected in boats and brought to the fields to be\r\ntreated and there left to drain and dry before distributing. Both\r\nthe material used to feed the crop and that used for manuring the\r\nland are waste products, hindrances to the industry of the region,\r\nbut the Chinese make them do essential duty in maintaining its life.\r\nThe human waste must be disposed of. They return it to the soil. We\r\nturn it into the sea. Doing so, they save for plant feeding more\r\nthan a ton of phosphorus (2712 pounds) and more than two tons of\r\npotassium (4488 pounds) per day for each million of adult\r\npopulation. The mud collects in their canals and obstructs movement.\r\nThey must be kept open. The mud is highly charged with organic\r\nmatter and would add humus to the soil if applied to the fields, at\r\nthe same time raising their level above the river and canal, giving\r\nthem better drainage; thus are they turning to use what is otherwise\r\nwaste, causing the labor which must be expended in disposal to count\r\nin a remunerative way.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning ride to Canton Christian College and three\r\nothers which we were permitted to enjoy in the launch on the canal\r\nand river waters, everything was again strange, fascinating and full\r\nof human interest. The Cantonese water population was a surprise,\r\nnot so much for its numbers as for the lithe, sinewy forms, bright\r\neyes and cheerful faces, particularly among the women, young and\r\nold. Nearly always one or more women, mother and daughter oftenest,\r\ngrandmother many times, wrinkled, sometimes grey, but strong, quick\r\nand vigorous in motion, were manning the oars of junks, houseboats\r\nand sampans. Sometimes husband and wife and many times the whole\r\nfamily were seen together when the craft was both home and business\r\nboat as well. Little children were gazing from most unexpected peek\r\nholes, or they toddled tethered from a waist belt at the end of as\r\nmuch rope as would arrest them above water, should they go\r\noverboard. And the cat was similarly tied. Through an overhanging\r\nlatticed stern, too, hens craned their necks, longing for scenes\r\nthey could not reach. With bare heads, bare feet, in short trousers\r\nand all dressed much alike, men, women, boys and girls showed equal\r\nmastery of the oar. Beginning so young, day and night in the open\r\nair on the tide-swept streams and canals, exposed to all of the\r\nsunshine the fogs and clouds will permit, and removed from the dust\r\nand filth of streets, it would seem that if the children survive at\r\nall they must develop strong. The appearance of the women somehow\r\nconveyed the impression that they were more vigorous and in better\r\nfettle than the men.\r\n\r\nBoats selling many kinds of steaming hot dishes were common. Among\r\nthese was rice tied in green leaf wrappers, three small packets in a\r\ncluster suspended by a strand of some vegetable fiber, to be handed\r\nhot from the cooker to the purchaser, some one on a passing junk or\r\non an in-coming or out-going boat. Another would buy hot water for a\r\nbrew of tea, while still another, and for a single cash, might be\r\nhanded a small square of cotton cloth, wrung hot from the water,\r\nwith which to wipe his face and hands and then be returned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing better measures the intensity of the maintenance\r\nstruggle here, and better indicates the minute economies practiced,\r\nthan the value of their smallest currency unit, the Cash, used in\r\ntheir daily retail transactions. On our Pacific coast, where less\r\nthought is given to little economies than perhaps anywhere else in\r\nthe world, the nickel is the smallest coin in general use, twenty to\r\nthe dollar. For the rest of the United States and in most English\r\nspeaking countries one hundred cents or half pennies measure an\r\nequal value. In Russia 170 kopecks, in Mexico 200 centavos, in\r\nFrance 250 two-centime pieces, and in Austria-Hungary 250 two-heller\r\ncoins equal the United States dollar; while in Germany 400 pfennigs,\r\nand in India 400 pie are required for an equal value. Again 500\r\npenni in Finland and of stotinki in Bulgaria, of centesimi in Italy\r\nand of half cents in Holland equal our dollar; but in China the\r\nsmall daily financial transactions are measured against a much\r\nsmaller unit, their Cash, 1500 to 2000 of which are required to\r\nequal the United States dollar, their purchasing power fluctuating\r\ndaily with the price of silver.\r\n\r\nIn the Shantung province, when we inquired of the farmers the\r\nselling prices of their crops, their replies were given like this:\r\n\"Thirty-five strings of cash for 420 catty of wheat and twelve to\r\nfourteen strings of cash for 1000 catty of wheat straw.\" At this\r\ntime, according to my interpreter, the value of one string of cash\r\nwas 40 cents Mexican, from which it appears that something like 250\r\nof these coins were threaded on a string. Twice we saw a wheelbarrow\r\nheavily loaded with strings of cash being transported through the\r\nstreets of Shanghai, lying exposed on the frame, suggesting chains\r\nof copper more than money. At one of the go-downs or warehouses in\r\nTsingtao, where freight was being transferred from a steamer, the\r\ncarriers were receiving their pay in these coin. The pay-master\r\nstood in the doorway with half a bushel of loose cash in a grain\r\nsack at his feet. With one hand he received the bamboo tally-sticks\r\nfrom the stevedores and with the other paid the cash for service\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to buying hot water. In a sampan managed by\r\na woman and her daughter, who took us ashore, the middle section of\r\nthe boat was furnished in the manner of a tiny sitting-room, and on\r\nthe sideboard sat the complete embodiment of our fireless cookers,\r\nkeeping boiled water hot for making tea. This device and the custom\r\nare here centuries old and throughout these countries boiled water,\r\nas tea, is the universal drink, adopted no doubt as a preventive\r\nmeasure against typhoid fever and allied diseases. Few vegetables\r\nare eaten raw and nearly all foods are taken hot or recently cooked\r\nif not in some way pickled or salted. Houseboat meat shops move\r\namong the many junks on the canals. These were provided with a\r\ncompartment communicating freely with the canal water where the fish\r\nwere kept alive until sold. At the street markets too, fish are kept\r\nalive in large tubs of water systematically aerated by the water\r\nfalling from an elevated receptacle in a thin stream. A live fish\r\nmay even be sliced before the eyes of a purchaser and the unsold\r\nportion returned to the water. Poultry is largely retailed alive\r\nalthough we saw much of it dressed and cooked to a uniform rich\r\nbrown, apparently roasted, hanging exposed in the markets of the\r\nvery narrow streets in Canton, shaded from the hot sun under awnings\r\nadmitting light overhead through translucent oyster-shell\r\nlatticework. Perhaps these fowl had been cooked in hot oil and\r\nbefore serving would be similarly heated. At any rate it is\r\nperfectly clear that among these people many very fundamental\r\nsanitary practices are rigidly observed.\r\n\r\nOne fact which we do not fully understand is that, wherever we went,\r\nhouse flies were very few. We never spent a summer with so little\r\nannoyance from them as this one in China, Korea and Japan. It may be\r\nthat our experience was exceptional but, if so, it could not be\r\nascribed to the season of our visit for we have found flies so\r\nnumerous in southern Florida early in April as to make the use of\r\nthe fly brush at the table very necessary. If the scrupulous\r\nhusbanding of waste refuse so universally practiced in these\r\ncountries reduces the fly nuisance and this menace to health to the\r\nextent which our experience suggests, here is one great gain. We\r\nbreed flies in countless millions each year, until they become an\r\nintolerable nuisance, and then expend millions of dollars on screens\r\nand fly poison which only ineffectually lessen the intensity and\r\ndanger of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical appliances in use on the canals and in the shops of\r\nCanton demonstrate that the Chinese possess constructive ability of\r\na high order, notwithstanding so many of these are of the simplest\r\nforms. This statement is well illustrated in the simple yet\r\nefficient foot-power seen in Fig. 42, where a father and his two\r\nsons are driving an irrigation pump, lifting water at the rate of\r\nseven and a half acre-inches per ten hours, and at a cost, including\r\nwage and food, of 36 to 45 cents, gold. Here, too, were large\r\nstern-wheel passenger boats, capable of carrying thirty to one\r\nhundred people, propelled by the same foot-power but laid crosswise\r\nof the stern, the men working in long single or double lines,\r\ndepending on the size of the boat. On these the fare was one cent,\r\ngold, for a fifteen mile journey, a rate one-thirtieth our two-cent\r\nrailway tariff. The dredging and clearing of the canals and water\r\nchannels in and about Canton is likewise accomplished with the same\r\nfoot-power, often by families living on the dredge boats. A dipper\r\ndredge is used, constructed of strong bamboo strips woven into the\r\nform of a sliding, two-horse road scraper, guided by a long bamboo\r\nhandle. The dredge is drawn along the bottom by a rope winding about\r\nthe projecting axle of the foot-power, propelled by three or more\r\npeople. When the dipper reaches the axle and is raised from the\r\nwater it is swung aboard, emptied and returned by means of a long\r\narm like the old well sweep, operated by a cord depending from the\r\nlower end of the lever, the dipper swinging from the other. Much of\r\nthe mud so collected from the canals and channels of the city is\r\ntaken to the rice and mulberry fields, many square miles of which\r\noccupy the surrounding country. Thus the channels are kept open, the\r\nfields grow steadily higher above flood level, while their\r\nproductive power is maintained by the plant food and organic matter\r\ncarried in the sediment.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical principle involved in the boy's button buzz was\r\napplied in Canton and in many other places for operating small\r\ndrills as well as in grinding and polishing appliances used in the\r\nmanufacture of ornamental ware. The drill, as used for boring metal,\r\nis set in a straight shaft, often of bamboo, on the upper end of\r\nwhich is mounted a circular weight. The drill is driven by a pair of\r\nstrings with one end attached just beneath the momentum weight and\r\nthe other fastened at the ends of a cross hand-bar, having a hole at\r\nits center through which the shaft carrying the drill passes.\r\nHolding the drill in position for work and turning the shaft, the\r\ntwo cords are wrapped about it in such a manner that simple downward\r\npressure on the hand bar held in the two hands unwinds the cords and\r\nthus revolves the drill. Relieving the pressure at the proper time\r\npermits the momentum of the revolving weight to rewind the cords and\r\nthe next downward pressure brings the drill again into service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nUP THE SI-KIANG, WEST RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 10th we took passage on the Nanning for\r\nWuchow, in Kwangsi province, a journey of 220 miles up the West\r\nriver, or Sikiang. The Nanning is one of two English steamers making\r\nregular trips between the two places, and it was the sister boat\r\nwhich in the summer of 1906 was attacked by pirates on one of her\r\ntrips and all of the officers and first class passengers killed\r\nwhile at dinner. The cause of this attack, it is said, or the excuse\r\nfor it, was threatened famine resulting from destructive floods\r\nwhich had ruined the rice and mulberry crops of the great delta\r\nregion and had prevented the carrying of manure and bean cake as\r\nfertilizers to the tea fields in the hill lands beyond, thus\r\nbringing ruin to three of the great staple crops of the region. To\r\navoid the recurrence of such tragedies the first class quarters on\r\nthe Nanning had been separated from the rest of the ship by heavy\r\niron gratings thrown across the decks and over the hatchways. Armed\r\nguards stood at the locked gateways, and swords were hanging from\r\nposts under the awnings of the first cabin quarters, much as saw and\r\nax in our passenger coaches. Both British and Chinese gunboats were\r\npatrolling the river; all Chinese passengers were searched for\r\nconcealed weapons as they came aboard, even though Government\r\nsoldiers, and all arms taken into custody until the end of the\r\njourney. Several of the large Chinese merchant junks which were\r\npassed, carrying valuable cargoes on the river, were armed with\r\nsmall cannon and when riding by rail from Canton to Sam Shui, a\r\ngovernment pirate detective was in our coach.\r\n\r\nThe Sikiang is one of the great rivers of China and indeed of the\r\nworld. Its width at Wuchow at low water was nearly a mile and our\r\nsteamer anchored in twenty-four feet of water to a floating dock\r\nmade fast by huge iron chains reaching three hundred feet up the\r\nslope to the city proper, thus providing for a rise of twenty-six\r\nfeet in the river at its flood stage during the rainy season. In a\r\nnarrow section of river where it winds through Shui Hing gorge, the\r\nwater at low stage has a depth of more than twenty-five fathoms, too\r\ndeep for anchorage, so in times of prospective fog, boats wait for\r\nclearing weather. Fluctuations in the height of the river limit\r\nvessels passing up to Wuchow to those drawing six and a half feet of\r\nwater during the low stage, and at high stage to those drawing\r\nsixteen feet.\r\n\r\nWhen the West river emerges from the high lands, with its burden of\r\nsilt, to join its waters with those of the North and East rivers, it\r\nhas entered a vast delta plain some eighty miles from east to west\r\nand nearly as many from north to south, and this has been canalized,\r\ndiked, drained and converted into the most productive of fields,\r\nbearing three or more crops each year. As we passed westward through\r\nthis delta region the broad flat fields, surrounded by dikes to\r\nprotect them against high water, were being plowed and fitted for\r\nthe coming crop of rice. In many places the dikes which checked off\r\nthe fields were planted with bananas and in the distance gave the\r\nappearance of extensive orchards completely occupying the ground.\r\nExcept for the water and the dikes it was easy to imagine that we\r\nwere traversing one of our western prairie sections in the early\r\nspring, at seeding time, the scattered farm villages here easily\r\nsuggested distant farmsteads; but a nearer approach to the houses\r\nshowed that the roofs and sides were thatched with rice straw and\r\nstacks were very numerous about the buildings. Many tide gates were\r\nset in the dikes, often with double trunks.\r\n\r\nAt times we approached near enough to the fields to see how they\r\nwere laid out. From the gates long canals, six to eight feet wide,\r\nled back sometimes eighty or a hundred rods. Across these and at\r\nright angles, head channels were cut and between them the fields\r\nwere plowed in long straight lands some two rods wide, separated by\r\nwater furrows. Many of the fields were bearing sugar cane standing\r\neight feet high. The Chinese do no sugar refining but boil the sap\r\nuntil it will solidify, when it is run into cakes resembling\r\nchocolate or our brown maple sugar. Immense quantities of sugar\r\ncane, too, are exported to the northern provinces, in bundles\r\nwrapped with matting or other cover, for the retail markets where it\r\nis sold, the canes being cut in short sections and sometimes peeled,\r\nto be eaten from the hands as a confection.\r\n\r\nMuch of the way this water-course was too broad to permit detailed\r\nstudy of field conditions and crops, even with a glass. In such\r\nsections the recent dikes often have the appearance of being built\r\nfrom limestone blocks but a closer view showed them constructed from\r\nblocks of the river silt cut and laid in walls with slightly sloping\r\nfaces. In time however the blocks weather and the dikes become\r\nrounded earthen walls.\r\n\r\nWe passed two men in a boat, in charge of a huge flock of some\r\nhundreds of yellow ducklings. Anchored to the bank was a large\r\nhouseboat provided with an all-around, over-hanging rim and on board\r\nwas a stack of rice straw and other things which constituted the\r\nfloating home of the ducks. Both ducks and geese are reared in this\r\nmanner in large numbers by the river population. When it is desired\r\nto move to another feeding ground a gang plank is put ashore and the\r\nflock come on board to remain for the night or to be landed at\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\nAbout five hours journey westward in this delta plain, where the\r\nfields lie six to ten feet above the present water stage, we reached\r\nthe mulberry district. Here the plants are cultivated in rows about\r\nfour feet apart, having the habit of small shrubs rather than of\r\ntrees, and so much resembling cotton that our first impression was\r\nthat we were in an extensive cotton district. On the lower lying\r\nareas, surrounded by dikes, some fields were laid out in the manner\r\nof the old Italian or English water meadows, with a shallow\r\nirrigation furrow along the crest of the bed and much deeper\r\ndrainage ditches along the division line between them. Mulberries\r\nwere occupying the ground before the freshly cut trenches we saw\r\nwere dug, and all the surface between the rows had been evenly\r\noverlaid with the fresh earth removed with the spade, the soil lying\r\nin blocks essentially unbroken. In Fig. 43 may be seen the mulberry\r\ncrop on a similarly treated surface, between Canton and Samshui,\r\nwith the earth removed from the trenches laid evenly over the entire\r\nsurface between and around the plants, as it came from the spade.\r\n\r\nAt frequent intervals along the river, paths and steps were seen\r\nleading to the water and within a distance of a quarter of a mile we\r\ncounted thirty-one men and women carrying mud in baskets on bamboo\r\npoles swung across their shoulders, the mud being taken from just\r\nabove the water line. The disposition of this material we could not\r\nsee as it was carried beyond a rise in ground. We have little doubt\r\nthat the mulberry fields were being covered with it. It was here\r\nthat a rain set in and almost like magic the fields blossomed out\r\nwith great numbers of giant rain hats and kittysols, where people\r\nhad been unobserved before. From one o'clock until six in the\r\nafternoon we had traveled continuously through these mulberry fields\r\nstretching back miles from our line of travel on either hand, and\r\nthe total acreage must have been very large. But we had now nearly\r\nreached the margin of the delta and the mulberries changed to fields\r\nof grain, beans, peas and vegetables.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the delta region the balance of the journey to Wuchow\r\nwas through a hill country, the slopes rising steeply from near the\r\nriver bank, leaving relatively little tilled or readily tillable\r\nland. Rising usually five hundred to a thousand feet, the sides and\r\nsummits of the rounded, soil-covered hills were generally clothed\r\nwith a short herbaceous growth and small scattering trees, oftenest\r\npine, four to sixteen feet high, Fig. 44 being a typical landscape\r\nof the region.\r\n\r\nIn several sections along the course of this river there are limited\r\nareas of intense erosion where naked gulleys of no mean magnitude\r\nhave developed but these were exceptions and we were continually\r\nsurprised at the remarkable steepness of the slopes, with convexly\r\nrounded contours almost everywhere, well mantled with soil, devoid\r\nof gulleys and completely covered with herbaceous growth dotted with\r\nsmall trees. The absence of forest growth finds its explanation in\r\nhuman influence rather than natural conditions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the hill-land section of this mighty river the most\r\ncharacteristic and persistent human features were the stacks of\r\nbrush-wood and the piles of stove wood along the banks or loaded\r\nupon boats and barges for the market. The brush-wood was largely\r\nmade from the boughs of pine, tied into bundles and stacked like\r\ngrain. The stove wood was usually round, peeled and made from the\r\nlimbs and trunks of trees two to five inches in diameter. All this\r\nfuel was coming to the river from the back country, sent down along\r\nsteep slides which in the distance resemble paths leading over hills\r\nbut too steep for travel. The fuel was loaded upon large barges, the\r\nboughs in the form of stacks to shed rain but with a tunnel leading\r\ninto the house of the boat about which they were stacked, while the\r\nwood was similarly corded about the dwelling, as seen in Fig. 44.\r\nThe wood was going to Canton and other delta cities while the pine\r\nboughs were taken to the lime and cement kilns, many of which were\r\nlocated along the river. Absolutely the whole tree, including the\r\nroots and the needles, is saved and burned; no waste is permitted.\r\n\r\nThe up-river cargo of the Nanning was chiefly matting rush, taken on\r\nat Canton, tied in bundles like sheaves of wheat. It is grown upon\r\nthe lower, newer delta lands by methods of culture similar to those\r\napplied to rice, Fig. 45 showing a field as seen in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe rushes were being taken to one of the country villages on a\r\ntributary of the Sikiang and the steamer was met by a flotilla of\r\njunks from this village, some forty-five miles up the stream, where\r\nthe families live who do the weaving. On the return trip the\r\nflotilla again met the steamer with a cargo of the woven matting. In\r\nkeeping record of packages transferred the Chinese use a simple and\r\nunique method. Each carrier, with his two bundles, received a pair\r\nof tally sticks. At the gang-plank sat a man with a tally-case\r\ndivided into twenty compartments, each of which could receive five,\r\nbut no more, tallies. As the bundles left the steamer the tallies\r\nwere placed in the tally-case until it contained one hundred, when\r\nit was exchanged for another.\r\n\r\nWuchow is a city of some 65,000 inhabitants, standing back on the\r\nhigher ground, not readily visible from the steamer landing nor from\r\nthe approach on the river. On the foreground, across which stretched\r\nthe anchor chains of the dock, was living a floating population,\r\nmany in shelters less substantial than Indian wigwams, but engaged\r\nin a great variety of work, and many water buffalo had been tied for\r\nthe night along the anchor chains. Before July much of this area\r\nwould lie beneath the flood waters of the Sikiang.\r\n\r\nHere a ship builder was using his simple, effective bow-brace,\r\nboring holes for the dowel pins in the planking for his ship, and\r\nanother was bending the plank to the proper curvature. The bow-brace\r\nconsisted of a bamboo stalk carrying the bit at one end and a\r\nshoulder rest at the other. Pressing the bit to its work with the\r\nshoulder, it was driven with the string of a long bow wrapped once\r\naround the stalk by drawing the bow back and forth, thus rapidly and\r\nreadily revolving the bit.\r\n\r\nThe bending of the long, heavy plank, four inches thick and eight\r\ninches wide, was more simple still, It was saturated with water and\r\none end raised on a support four feet above the ground. A bundle of\r\nburning rice straw moved along the under side against the wet wood\r\nhad the effect of steaming the wood and the weight of the plank\r\ncaused it to gradually bend into the shape desired. Bamboo poles are\r\ncommonly bent or straightened in this manner to suit any need and\r\nFig. 46 shows a wooden fork shaped in the manner described from a\r\nsmall tree having three main branches. This fork is in the hands of\r\nmy interpreter and was used by the woman standing at the right, in\r\nturning wheat.\r\n\r\nWhen the old ship builder had finished shaping his plank he sat down\r\non the ground for a smoke. His pipe was one joint of bamboo stem a\r\nfoot long, nearly two inches in diameter and open at one end. In the\r\nclosed end, at one side, a small hole was bored for draft. A charge\r\nof tobacco was placed in the bottom, the lips pressed into the open\r\nend and the pipe lighted by suction, holding a lighted match at the\r\nsmall opening. To enjoy his pipe the bowl rested on the ground\r\nbetween his legs. With his lips in the bowl and a long breath, he\r\nwould completely fill his lungs, retaining the smoke for a time,\r\nthen slowly expire and fill the lungs again, after an interval of\r\nnatural breathing.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Canton we went by rail, with an interpreter, to\r\nSamshui, visiting fields along the way, and Fig. 47 is a view of one\r\nlandscape. The woman was picking roses among tidy beds of garden\r\nvegetables. Beyond her and in front of the near building are two\r\nrows of waste receptacles. In the center background is a large\r\n\"go-down\", in function that of our cold storage warehouse and in\r\npart that of our grain elevator for rice. In them, too, the wealthy\r\nstore their fur-lined winter garments for safe keeping. These are\r\nnumerous in this portion of China and the rank of a city is\r\nindicated by their number. The conical hillock is a large near-by\r\ngrave mound and many others serrate the sky line on the hill beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the next landscape, Fig. 48, a crop of winter peas, trained to\r\ncanes, are growing on ridges among the stubble of the second crop of\r\nrice, In front is one canal, the double ridge behind is another and\r\na third canal extends in front of the houses. Already preparations\r\nwere being made for the first crop of rice, fields were being\r\nflooded and fertilized. One such is seen in Fig. 49, where a laborer\r\nwas engaged at the time in bringing stable manure, wading into the\r\nwater to empty the baskets.\r\n\r\nTwo crops of rice are commonly grown each year in southern China and\r\nduring the winter and early spring, grain, cabbage, rape, peas,\r\nbeans, leeks and ginger may occupy the fields as a third or even\r\nfourth crop, making the total year's product from the land very\r\nlarge; but the amount of thought, labor and fertilizers given to\r\nsecuring these is even greater and beyond anything Americans will\r\nendure. How great these efforts are will be appreciated from what is\r\nseen in Fig. 50, representing two fields thrown into high ridges,\r\nplanted to ginger and covered with straw. All of this work is done\r\nby hand and when the time for rice planting comes every ridge will\r\nagain be thrown down and the surface smoothed to a water level. Even\r\nwhen the ridges and beds are not thrown down for the crops of rice,\r\nthe furrows and the beds will change places so that all the soil is\r\nworked over deeply and mainly through hand labor. The statement so\r\noften made, that these people only barely scratch the surface of\r\ntheir fields with the crudest of tools is very far from the truth,\r\nfor their soils are worked deeply and often, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that their plowing, as such, may be shallow.\r\n\r\nThrough Dr. John Blumann of the missionary hospital at Tungkun, east\r\nfrom Canton, we learned that the good rice lands there a few years\r\nago sold at $75 to $130 per acre but that prices are rising rapidly.\r\nThe holdings of the better class of farmers there are ten to fifteen\r\nmow--one and two-thirds to two and a half acres--upon which are\r\nmaintained families numbering six to twelve. The day's wage of a\r\ncarpenter or mason is eleven to thirteen cents of our currency, and\r\nboard is not included, but a day's ration for a laboring man is\r\ncounted worth fifteen cents, Mexican, or less than seven cents,\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nFish culture is practiced in both deep and shallow basins, the deep\r\npermanent ones renting as high as $30 gold, per acre. The shallow\r\nbasins which can be drained in the dry season are used for fish only\r\nduring the rainy period, being later drained and planted to some\r\ncrop. The permanent basins have often come to be ten or twelve feet\r\ndeep, increasing with long usage, for they are periodically drained\r\nby pumping and the foot or two of mud which has accumulated, removed\r\nand sold as fertilizer to planters of rice and other crops. It is a\r\ncommon practice, too, among the fish growers, to fertilize the\r\nponds, and in case a foot path leads alongside, screens are built\r\nover the water to provide accommodation for travelers. Fish reared\r\nin the better fertilized ponds bring a higher price in the market.\r\nThe fertilizing of the water favors a stronger growth of food forms,\r\nboth plant and animal, upon which the fish live and they are better\r\nnourished, making a more rapid growth, giving their flesh better\r\nqualities, as is the case with well fed animals.\r\n\r\nIn the markets where fish are exposed for sale they are often sliced\r\nin halves lengthwise and the cut surface smeared with fresh blood.\r\nIn talking with Dr. Blumann as to the reason for this practice he\r\nstated that the Chinese very much object to eating meat that is old\r\nor tainted and that he thought the treatment simply had the effect\r\nof making the fish look fresher. I question whether this treatment\r\nwith fresh blood may not have a real antiseptic effect and very much\r\ndoubt that people so shrewd as the Chinese would be misled by such a\r\nruse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF CANALIZATION AND\r\nSURFACE FITTING OF FIELDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 15th we left Canton for Hongkong and the\r\nfollowing day embarked again on the Tosa Maru for Shanghai. Although\r\nour steamer stood so far to sea that we were generally out of sight\r\nof land except for some off-shore islands, the water was turbid most\r\nof the way after we had crossed the Tropic of Cancer off the mouth\r\nof the Han river at Swatow. Over a sea bottom measuring more than\r\nsix hundred miles northward along the coast, and perhaps fifty miles\r\nto sea, unnumbered acre-feet of the richest soil of China are being\r\nborne beyond the reach of her four hundred millions of people and\r\nthe children to follow them. Surely it must be one of the great\r\ntasks of future statesmanship, education and engineering skill to\r\ndivert larger amounts of such sediments close along inshore in such\r\nmanner as to add valuable new land annually to the public domain,\r\nnot alone in China but in all countries where large resources of\r\nthis type are going to waste.\r\n\r\nIn the vast Cantonese delta plains which we had just left, in the\r\nstill more extensive ones of the Yangtse kiang to which we were now\r\ngoing, and in those of the shifting Hwang ho further north,\r\ncenturies of toiling millions have executed works of almost\r\nincalculable magnitude, fundamentally along such lines as those just\r\nsuggested. They have accomplished an enormous share of these tasks\r\nby sheer force of body and will, building levees, digging canals,\r\ndiverting the turbid waters of streams through them and then\r\ncarrying the deposits of silt and organic growth out upon the\r\nfields, often borne upon the shoulders of men in the manner we have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIt is well nigh impossible, by word or map, to convey an adequate\r\nidea of the magnitude of the systems of canalization and delta and\r\nother lowland reclamation work, or of the extent of surface fitting\r\nof fields which have been effected in China, Korea and Japan through\r\nthe many centuries, and which are still in progress. The lands so\r\nreclaimed and fitted constitute their most enduring asset and they\r\nsupport their densest populations. In one of our journeys by\r\nhouseboat on the delta canals between Shanghai and Hangchow, in\r\nChina, over a distance of 117 miles, we made a careful record of the\r\nnumber and dimensions of lateral canals entering and leaving the\r\nmain one along which our boat-train was traveling. This record shows\r\nthat in 62 miles, beginning north of Kashing and extending south to\r\nHangchow, there entered from the west 134 and there left on the\r\ncoast side 190 canals. The average width of these canals, measured\r\nalong the water line, we estimated at 22 and 19 feet respectively on\r\nthe two sides. The height of the fields above the water level ranged\r\nfrom four to twelve feet, during the April and May stage of water.\r\nThe depth of water, after we entered the Grand Canal, often exceeded\r\nsix feet and our best judgment would place the average depth of all\r\ncanals in this part of China at more than eight feet below the level\r\nof the fields.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 51, representing an area of 718 square miles in the region\r\ntraversed, all lines shown are canals, but scarcely more than\r\none-third of those present are shown on the map. Between A, where we\r\nbegan our records, before reaching Kashing, and B, near the left\r\nmargin of the map, there were forty-three canals leading in from the\r\nup-country side, instead of the eight shown, and on the coast side\r\nthere were eighty-six leading water out into the delta plain toward\r\nthe coast, instead of the twelve shown. Again, on one of our trips\r\nby rail, from Shanghai to Nanking, we made a similar record of the\r\nnumber of canals seen from the train, close along the track, and the\r\nnotes show, in a distance of 162 miles, 593 canals between Lungtan\r\nand Nansiang. This is an average of more than three canals per mile\r\nfor this region and that between Shanghai and Hangchow.\r\n\r\nThe extent, nature and purpose of these vast systems of internal\r\nimprovement may be better realized through a study of the next two\r\nsketch maps. The first, Fig. 52, represents an area 175 by 160\r\nmiles, of which the last illustration is the portion enclosed in the\r\nsmall rectangle. On this area there are shown 2,700 miles of canals\r\nand only about one-third of the canals shown in Fig. 51 are laid\r\ndown on this map, and according to our personal observations there\r\nare three times as many canals as are shown on the map of which Fig.\r\n51 represents a part. It is probable, therefore, that there exists\r\ntoday in the area of Fig. 52 not less than 25,000 miles of canals.\r\n\r\nIn the next illustration, Fig. 53, an area of northeast China, 600\r\nby 725 miles, is represented. The unshaded land area covers nearly\r\n200,000 square miles of alluvial plain. This plain is so level that\r\nat Ichang, nearly a thousand miles up the Yangtse, the elevation is\r\nonly 130 feet above the sea. The tide is felt on the river to beyond\r\nWuhu, 375 miles from the coast. During the summer the depth of water\r\nin the Yangtse is sufficient to permit ocean vessels drawing\r\ntwenty-five feet of water to ascend six hundred miles to Hankow, and\r\nfor smaller steamers to go on to Ichang, four hundred miles further.\r\n\r\nThe location, in this vast low delta and coastal plain, of the\r\nsystem of canals already described, is indicated by the two\r\nrectangles in the south-east corner of the sketch map, Fig. 53. The\r\nheavy barred black line extending from Hangchow in the south to\r\nTientsin in the north represents the Grand Canal which has a length\r\nof more than eight hundred miles. The plain, east of this canal, as\r\nfar north as the mouth of the Hwang ho in 1852, is canalized much as\r\nis the area shown in Fig. 52. So, too, is a large area both sides of\r\nthe present mouth of the same river in Shantung and Chihli, between\r\nthe canal and the coast. Westward, up the Yangtse valley, the\r\nprovinces of Anhwei, Kiangsi, Hunan and Hupeh have very extensive\r\ncanalized tracts, probably exceeding 28,000 square miles in area,\r\nand Figs. 54 and 55 are two views in this more western region. Still\r\nfurther west, in Szechwan province, is the Chengtu plain, thirty by\r\nseventy miles, with what has been called \"the most remarkable\r\nirrigation system in China.\"\r\n\r\nWestward beyond the limits of the sketch map, up the Hwang ho\r\nvalley, there is a reach of 125 miles of irrigated lands about\r\nNinghaifu, and others still farther west, at Lanchowfu and at Suchow\r\nwhere the river has attained an elevation of 5,000 feet, in Kansu\r\nprovince; and there is still to be named the great Canton delta\r\nregion. A conservative estimate would place the miles of canals and\r\nleveed rivers in China, Korea and Japan equal to eight times the\r\nnumber represented in Fig. 52. Fully 200,000 miles in all. Forty\r\ncanals across the United States from east to west and sixty from\r\nnorth to south would not equal, in number of miles those in these\r\nthree countries today. Indeed, it is probable that this estimate is\r\nnot too large for China alone.\r\n\r\nAs adjuncts to these vast canalization works there have been\r\nenormous amounts of embankment, dike and levee construction. More\r\nthan three hundred miles of sea wall alone exist in the area covered\r\nby the sketch map, Fig. 52. The east bank of the Grand Canal,\r\nbetween Yangchow and Hwaianfu, is itself a great levee, holding back\r\nthe waters to the west above the eastern plain, diverting them\r\nsouth, into the Yangtse kiang. But it is also provided with\r\nspillways for use in times of excessive flood, permitting waters to\r\ndischarge eastward. Such excess waters however are controlled by\r\nanother dike with canal along its west side, some forty miles to the\r\neast, impounding the water in a series of large lakes until it may\r\ngradually drain away. This area is seen in Fig. 53, north of the\r\nYangtse river.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the Yangtse, and for many miles along the Hwang\r\nho, great levees have been built, some-times in reinforcing series\r\nof two or three at different distances back from the channel where\r\nthe stream bed is above the adjacent country, in order to prevent\r\nwidespread disaster and to limit the inundated areas in times of\r\nunusual flood. In the province of Hupeh, where the Han river flows\r\nthrough two hundred miles of low country, this stream is diked on\r\nboth sides throughout the whole distance, and in a portion of its\r\ncourse the height of the levees reaches thirty feet or more. Again,\r\nin the Canton delta region there are other hundreds of miles of sea\r\nwall and dikes, so that the aggregate mileage of this type of\r\nconstruction works in the Empire can only be measured in thousands\r\nof miles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the canal and levee construction works there are\r\nnumerous impounding reservoirs which are brought into requisition to\r\ncontrol overflow waters from the great streams. Some of these\r\nreservoirs, like Tungting lake in Hupeh and Poyang in Hunan, have\r\nareas of 2,000 and 1,800 square miles respectively and during the\r\nheaviest rainy seasons each may rise through twenty to thirty feet,\r\nThen there are other large and small lakes in the coastal plain\r\ngiving an aggregate reservoir area exceeding 13,000 square miles,\r\nall of which are brought into service in controlling flood waters,\r\nall of which are steadily filling with the sediments brought from\r\nthe far away uncultivable mountain slopes and which are ultimately\r\ndestined to become rich alluvial plains, doubtless to be canalized\r\nin the manner we have seen.\r\n\r\nThere is still another phase of these vast construction works which\r\nhas been of the greatest moment in increasing the maintenance\r\ncapacity of the Empire,--the wresting from the flood waters of the\r\nenormous volumes of silt which they carry, depositing it over the\r\nflooded areas, in the canals and along the shores in such manner as\r\nto add to the habitable and cultivable land. Reference has been made\r\nto the rapid growth of Chungming island in the mouth of the Yangtse\r\nkiang, and the million people now finding homes on the 270 square\r\nmiles of newly made land which now has its canals, as may be seen in\r\nthe upper margin of Fig. 52. The city of Shanghai, as its name\r\nsignifies, stood originally on the seashore, which has now grown\r\ntwenty miles to the northward and to the eastward. In 220 B. C. the\r\ntown of Putai in Shantung stood one-third of a mile from the sea,\r\nbut in 1730 it was forty-seven miles inland, and is forty-eight\r\nmiles from the shore today.\r\n\r\nSienshuiku, on the Pei ho, stood upon the seashore in 500 A. D. We\r\npassed the city, on our way to Tientsin, eighteen miles inland. The\r\ndotted line laid in from the coast of the Gulf of Chihli in Fig. 53\r\nmarks one historic shore line and indicates a general growth of land\r\neighteen miles to seaward.\r\n\r\nBesides these actual extensions of the shore lines the centuries of\r\nflooding of lakes and low lying lands has so filled many depressions\r\nas to convert large areas of swamp into cultivated fields. Not only\r\nthis, but the spreading of canal mud broadcast over the encircled\r\nfields has had two very important effects,--namely, raising the\r\nlevel of the low lying fields, giving them better drainage and so\r\nbetter physical condition, and adding new plant food in the form of\r\nvirgin soil of the richest type, thus contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of soil fertility, high maintenance capacity and\r\npermanent agriculture through all the centuries.\r\n\r\nThese operations of maintenance and improvement had a very early\r\ninception; they appear to have persisted throughout the recorded\r\nhistory of the Empire and are in vogue today. Canals of the type\r\nillustrated in Figs. 51 and 52 have been built between 1886 and\r\n1901, both on the extensions of Chungming island and the newly\r\nformed main land to the north, as is shown by comparison of\r\nStieler's atlas, revised in 1886, with the recent German survey.\r\n\r\nEarlier than 2255 B. C., more than 4100 years ago, Emperor Yao\r\nappointed \"The Great\" Yu \"Superintendent of Works\" and entrusted him\r\nwith the work of draining off the waters of disastrous floods and of\r\ncanalizing the rivers, and he devoted thirteen years to this work.\r\nThis great engineer is said to have written several treatises on\r\nagriculture and drainage, and was finally called, much against his\r\nwishes, to serve as Emperor during the last seven years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Hwang ho is one of disastrous floods and\r\nshiftings of its course, which have occurred many times in the years\r\nsince before the time of the Great Yu, who perhaps began the works\r\nperpetuated today. Between 1300 A. D. and 1852 the Hwang ho emptied\r\ninto the Yellow Sea south of the highlands of Shantung, but in that\r\nyear, when in unusual flood, it broke through the north levees and\r\nfinally took its present course, emptying again into the Gulf of\r\nChihli, some three hundred miles further north. Some of these\r\nshiftings of course of the Hwang ho and of the Yangtse kiang are\r\nindicated in dotted lines on the sketch map, Fig. 53, where it may\r\nhe seen that the Hwang ho during 146 years, poured its waters into\r\nthe sea as far north as Tientsin, through the mouth of the Pei ho,\r\nfour hundred miles to the northward of its mouth in 1852.\r\n\r\nThis mighty river is said to carry at low stage, past the city of\r\nTsinan in Shantung, no less than 4,000 cubic yards of water per\r\nsecond, and three times this volume when running at flood. This is\r\nwater sufficient to inundate thirty-three square miles of level\r\ncountry ten feet deep in twenty-four hours. What must be said of the\r\nmental status of a people who for forty centuries have measured\r\ntheir strength against such a Titan racing past their homes above\r\nthe level of their fields, confined only between walls of their own\r\nconstruction? While they have not always succeeded in controlling\r\nthe river, they have never failed to try again. In 1877 this river\r\nbroke its banks, inundating a vast. area, bringing death to a\r\nmillion people. Again, as late as 1898, fifteen hundred villages to\r\nthe northeast of Tsinan and a much larger area to the southwest of\r\nthe same city were devastated by it, and it is such events as these\r\nwhich have won for the river the names \"China's Sorrow,\" \"The\r\nUngovernable\" and \"The Scourge of the Sons of Han.\"\r\n\r\nThe building of the Grand Canal appears to have been a comparatively\r\nrecent event in Chinese history. The middle section, between the\r\nYangtse and Tsingkiangpu, is said to have been constructed about the\r\nsixth century B. C.; the southern section, between Chingkiang and\r\nHangchow, during the years 605 to 617 A. D.; but the northern\r\nsection, from the channel of the Hwang ho deserted in 1852, to\r\nTientsin, was not built until the years 1280-1283.\r\n\r\nWhile this canal has been called by the Chinese Yu ho (Imperial\r\nriver), Yun ho (Transport river) or Yunliang ho (Tribute bearing\r\nriver) and while it has connected the great rivers coming down from\r\nthe far interior into a great water-transport system, this feature\r\nof construction may have been but a by-product of the great\r\ndominating purpose which led to the vast internal improvements in\r\nthe form of canals, dikes, levees and impounding reservoirs so\r\nwidely scattered, so fully developed and so effectively utilized.\r\nRather the master purpose must have been maintenance for the\r\nincreasing flood of humanity. And I am willing to grant to the Great\r\nYu, with his finger on the pulse of the nation, the power to project\r\nhis vision four thousand years into the future of his race and to\r\nformulate some of the measures which might he inaugurated to grow\r\nwith the years and make certain perpetual maintenance for those to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of cultivated fields must always have been the most\r\nfundamental, vital and difficult problem of all civilized people and\r\nit appears clear that such canalization as is illustrated in Figs.\r\n51 and 52 may have been primarily initial steps in the reclamation\r\nof delta and overflow lands. At any rate, whether deliberately so\r\nplanned or not, the canalization of the delta and overflow plains of\r\nChina has been one of the most fundamental and fruitful measures for\r\nthe conservation of her national resources that they could have\r\ntaken, for we are convinced that this oldest nation in the world has\r\nthus greatly augmented the extension of its coastal plains,\r\nconserving and building out of the waste of erosion wrested from the\r\ngreat streams, hundreds of square miles of the richest and most\r\nenduring of soils, and we have little doubt that were a full and\r\naccurate account given of human influence upon the changes in this\r\nremarkable region during the last four thousand years it would show\r\nthat these gigantic systems of canalization have been matters of\r\nslow, gradual growth, often initiated and always profoundly\r\ninfluenced by the labors of the strong, patient, persevering,\r\nthoughtful but ever silent husband-men in their efforts to acquire\r\nhomes and to maintain the productive power of their fields.\r\n\r\nNothing appears more clear than that the greatest material problem\r\nwhich can engage the best thought of China today is that of\r\nperfecting, extending and perpetuating the means for controlling her\r\nflood waters, for better draining of her vast areas of low land, and\r\nfor utilizing the tremendous loads of silt borne by her streams more\r\neffectively in fertilizing existing fields and in building and\r\nreclaiming new land. With her millions of people needing homes and\r\nanxious for work; who have done so much in land building, in\r\nreclamation and in the maintenance of soil fertility, the government\r\nshould give serious thought to the possibility of putting large\r\nnumbers of them at work, effectively directed by the best\r\nengineering skill. It must now be entirely practicable, with\r\nengineering skill and mechanical appliances, to put the Hwang ho,\r\nand other rivers of China subject to overflow, completely under\r\ncontrol. With the Hwang ho confined to its channel, the adjacent low\r\nlands can be better drained by canalization and freed from the\r\naccumulating saline deposits which are rendering them sterile.\r\nWarping may be resorted to during the flood season to raise the\r\nlevel of adjacent low-lying fields, rendering them at the same time\r\nmore fertile. Where the river is running above the adjacent plains\r\nthere is no difficulty in drawing off the turbid water by gravity,\r\nunder controlled conditions, into diked basins, and even in\r\ncompelling the river to buttress its own levees. There is certainly\r\ngreat need and great opportunity for China to make still better and\r\nmore efficient her already wonderful transportation canals and those\r\ndevoted to drainage, irrigation and fertilization.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, along the same lines, now that we are\r\nconsidering the development of inland waterways, the subject should\r\nbe surveyed broadly and much careful study may well be given to the\r\nworks these old people have developed and found serviceable through\r\nso many centuries. The Mississippi is annually bearing to the sea\r\nnearly 225,000 acre-feet of the most fertile sediment, and between\r\nlevees along a raised bed through two hundred miles of country\r\nsubject to inundation. The time is here when there should he\r\nundertaken a systematic diversion of a large part of this fertile\r\nsoil over the swamp areas, building them into well drained,\r\ncultivable, fertile fields provided with waterways to serve for\r\ndrainage, irrigation, fertilization and transportation. These great\r\nareas of swamp land may thus be converted into the most productive\r\nrice and sugar plantations to be found anywhere in the world, and\r\nthe area made capable of maintaining many millions of people as long\r\nas the Mississippi endures, bearing its burden of fertile sediment.\r\n\r\nBut the conservation and utilization of the wastes of soil erosion,\r\nas applied in the delta plain of China, stupendous as this work has\r\nbeen, is nevertheless small when measured by the savings which\r\naccrue from the careful and extensive fitting of fields so largely\r\npracticed, which both lessens soil erosion and permits a large\r\namount of soluble and suspended matter in the run-off to be applied\r\nto, and retained upon, the fields through their extensive systems of\r\nirrigation. Mountainous and hilly as are the lands of Japan, 11,000\r\nsquare miles of her cultivated fields in the main islands of Honshu,\r\nKyushu and Shikoku have been carefully graded to water level areas\r\nbounded by narrow raised rims upon which sixteen or more inches of\r\nrun-off water, with its suspended and soluble matters, may be\r\napplied, a large part of which is retained on the fields or utilized\r\nby the crop, while surface erosion is almost completely prevented.\r\nThe illustrations, Figs. 11, 12 and 13 show the application of the\r\nprinciple to the larger and more level fields, and in Figs. 151, 152\r\nand 225 may be seen the practice on steep slopes.\r\n\r\nIf the total area of fields graded practically to a water level in\r\nJapan aggregates 11,000 square miles, the total area thus surface\r\nfitted in China must be eight or tenfold this amount. Such enormous\r\nfield erosion as is tolerated at the present time in our southern\r\nand south Atlantic states is permitted nowhere in the Far East, so\r\nfar as we observed, not even where the topography is much steeper.\r\nThe tea orchards as we saw them on the steeper slopes, not\r\nlevel-terraced, are often heavily mulched with straw which makes\r\nerosion, even by heavy rains impossible, while the treatment retains\r\nthe rain where it falls, giving the soil opportunity to receive it\r\nunder the impulse of both capillarity and gravity, and with it the\r\nsoluble ash ingredients leached from the straw. The straw mulches we\r\nsaw used in this manner were often six to eight inches deep, thus\r\nconstituting a dressing of not less than six tons per acre, carrying\r\n140 pounds of soluble potassium and 12 pounds of phosphorus. The\r\npractice, therefore, gives at once a good fertilizing, the highest\r\nconservation and utilization of rainfall, and a complete protection\r\nagainst soil erosion. It is a multum in parvo treatment which\r\ncharacterizes so many of the practices of these people, which have\r\ncrystallized from twenty centuries of high tension experience.\r\n\r\nIn the Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces as elsewhere in the densely\r\npopulated portions of the Far East, we found almost all of the\r\ncultivated fields very nearly level or made so by grading. Instances\r\nshowing the type of this grading in a comparatively level country\r\nare seen in Figs. 56 and 57. By this preliminary surface fitting of\r\nthe fields these people have reduced to the lowest possible limit\r\nthe waste of soil fertility by erosion and surface leaching. At the\r\nsame time they are able to retain upon the field, uniformly\r\ndistributed over it, the largest part of the rainfall practicable,\r\nand to compel a much larger proportion of the necessary run off to\r\nleave by under-drainage than would be possible otherwise, conveying\r\nthe plant food developed in the surface soil to the roots of the\r\ncrops, while they make possible a more complete absorption and\r\nretention by the soil of the soluble plant food materials not taken\r\nup. This same treatment also furnishes the best possible conditions\r\nfor the application of water to the fields when supplemental\r\nirrigation would be helpful, and for the withdrawal of surplus\r\nrainfall by surface drainage, should this be necessary.\r\n\r\nBesides this surface fitting of fields there is a wide application\r\nof additional methods aiming to conserve both rainfall and soil\r\nfertility, one of which is illustrated in Fig. 58, showing one end\r\nof a collecting reservoir. There were three of these reservoirs in\r\ntandem, connected with each other by surface ditches and with an\r\nadjoining canal. About the reservoir the level field is seen to be\r\nthrown into beds with shallow furrows between the long narrow\r\nridges. The furrows are connected by a head drain around the margin\r\nof the reservoir and separated from it by a narrow raised rim. Such\r\na reservoir may be six to ten feet deep but can be completely\r\ndrained only by pumping or by evaporation during the dry season.\r\nInto such reservoirs the excess surface water is drained where all\r\nsuspended matter carried from the field collects and is returned,\r\neither directly as an application of mud or as material used in\r\ncomposts. In the preparation of composts, pits are dug near the\r\nmargin of the reservoir, as seen in the illustration, and into them\r\nare thrown coarse manure and any roughage in the form of stubble or\r\nother refuse which may be available, these materials being saturated\r\nwith the soft mud dipped from the bottom of the reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn all of the provinces where canals are abundant they also serve as\r\nreservoirs for collecting surface washings and along their banks\r\ngreat numbers of compost pits are maintained and repeatedly filled\r\nduring the season, for use on the fields as the crops are changed.\r\nFig. 59 shows two such pits on the bank of a canal, already filled.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, as in the Shantung province, illustrated in Fig. 60,\r\nthe surface of the field may be thrown into broad leveled lands\r\nseparated and bounded by deep and wide trenches into which the\r\nexcess water of very heavy rains may collect. As we saw them there\r\nwas no provision for draining the trenches and the water thus\r\ncollected either seeps away or evaporates, or it may be returned in\r\npart by underflow and capillary rise to the soil from which it was\r\ncollected, or be applied directly for irrigation by pumping. In this\r\nprovince the rains may often be heavy but the total fall for the\r\nyear is small, being little more than twenty-four inches hence there\r\nis the greatest need for its conservation, and this is carefully\r\npracticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSOME CUSTOMS OF THE COMMON\r\nPEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tosa Maru brought us again into Shanghai March 20th, just in\r\ntime for the first letters from home. A ricksha man carried us and\r\nour heavy valise at a smart trot from the dock to the Astor House\r\nmore than a mile, for 8.6 cents, U. S. currency, and more than the\r\nconventional price for the service rendered. On our way we passed\r\nseveral loaded carryalls of the type seen in Fig. 61, on which women\r\nwere riding for a fare one-tenth that we had paid, but at a slower\r\npace and with many a jolt.\r\n\r\nThe ringing chorus which came loud and clear when yet half a block\r\naway announced that the pile drivers were still at work on the\r\nfoundation for an annex to the Astor House, and so were they on May\r\n27th when we returned from the Shantung province, 88 days after we\r\nsaw them first, but with the task then practically completed. Had\r\nthe eighteen men labored continuously through this interval, the\r\ncost of their services to the contractor would have been but\r\n$205.92. With these conditions the engine-driven pile driver could\r\nnot compete. All ordinary labor here receives a low wage. In the\r\nChekiang province farm labor employed by the year received $30 and\r\nboard, ten years ago, but now is receiving $50. This is at the rate\r\nof about $12.90 and $21.50, gold, materially less than there is paid\r\nper month in the United States. At Tsingtao in the Shantung province\r\na missionary was paying a Chinese cook ten dollars per month, a man\r\nfor general work nine dollars per month, and the cook's wife, for\r\ndoing the mending and other family service, two dollars per month,\r\nall living at home and feeding themselves. This service rendered for\r\n$9.03, gold, per month covers the marketing, all care of the garden\r\nand lawn as well as all the work in the house. Missionaries in China\r\nfind such servants reliable and satisfactory, and trust them with\r\nthe purse and the marketing for the table, finding them not only\r\nhonest but far better at a bargain and at economical selection than\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWe had a soil tube made in the shops of a large English ship\r\nbuilding and repair firm, employing many hundred Chinese as\r\nmechanics, using the most modern and complex machinery, and the\r\nforeman stated that as soon as the men could understand well enough\r\nto take orders they were even better shop hands than the average in\r\nScotland and England. An educated Chinese booking clerk at the\r\nSoochow railway station in Kiangsu province was receiving a salary\r\nof $10.75, gold, per month. We had inquired the way to the Elizabeth\r\nBlake hospital and he volunteered to escort us and did so, the\r\ndistance being over a mile.\r\n\r\nHe would accept no compensation, and yet I was an entire stranger,\r\nwithout introduction of any kind. Everywhere we went in China, the\r\nlaboring people appeared generally happy and contented if they have\r\nsomething to do, and showed clearly that they were well nourished.\r\nThe industrial classes are thoroughly organized, having had their\r\nguilds or labor unions for centuries and it is not at all uncommon\r\nfor a laborer who is known to have violated the rules of his guild\r\nto be summarily dealt with or even to disappear without questions\r\nbeing asked. In going among the people, away from the lines of\r\ntourist travel, one gets the impression that everybody is busy or is\r\nin the harness ready to be busy. Tramps of our hobo type have few\r\nopportunities here and we doubt if one exists in either of these\r\ncountries. There are people physically disabled who are asking alms\r\nand there are organized charities to help them, but in proportion to\r\nthe total population these appear to be fewer than in America or\r\nEurope. The gathering of unfortunates and habitual beggars about\r\npublic places frequented by people of leisure and means naturally\r\nleads tourists to a wrong judgment regarding the extent of these\r\nsocial conditions. Nowhere among these densely crowded people,\r\neither Chinese, Japanese or Korean, did we see one intoxicated, but\r\namong Americans and Europeans many instances were observed. All\r\nclasses and both sexes use tobacco and the British-American Tobacco\r\nCompany does a business in China amounting to millions of dollars\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nDuring five months among these people we saw but two children in a\r\nquarrel. The two little boys were having their trouble on Nanking\r\nroad, Shanghai, where, grasping each other's pigtails, they tussled\r\nwith a vengeance until the mother of one came and parted their ways.\r\n\r\nAmong the most frequent sights in the city streets are the itinerant\r\nvendors of hot foods and confections. Stove, fuel, supplies and\r\nappliances may all be carried on the shoulders, swinging from a\r\nbamboo pole. The mother in Fig. 63 was quite likely thus supporting\r\nher family and the children are seen at lunch, dressed in the blue\r\nand white calico prints so generally worn by the young. The printing\r\nof this calico by the very ancient, simple yet effective method we\r\nwitnessed in the farm village along the canal seen in Fig. 10. This\r\nart, as with so many others in China, was the inheritance of the\r\nfamily we saw at work, handed down to them through many generations.\r\nThe printer was standing at a rough work bench upon which a large\r\nheavy stone in cubical form served as a weight to hold in place a\r\nthoroughly lacquered sheet of tough cardboard in which was cut the\r\npattern to appear in white on the cloth. Beside the stone stood a\r\npot of thick paste prepared from a mixture of lime and soy bean\r\nflour. The soy beans were being ground in one corner of the same\r\nroom by a diminutive edition of such an outfit as seen in Fig. 64.\r\nThe donkey was working in his permanent abode and whenever off duty\r\nhe halted before manger and feed. At the operator's right lay a bolt\r\nof white cotton cloth fixed to unroll and pass under the stencil,\r\nheld stationary by the heavy weight. To print, the stencil was\r\nraised and the cloth brought to place under it. The paste was then\r\ndeftly spread with a paddle over the surface and thus upon the cloth\r\nbeneath wherever exposed through the openings in the stencil. This\r\ncompletes the printing of the pattern on one section of the bolt of\r\ncloth. The free end of the stencil is then raised, the cloth passed\r\nalong the proper distance by hand and the stencil dropped in place\r\nfor the next application. The paste is permitted to dry upon the\r\ncloth and when the bolt has been dipped into the blue dye the\r\nportions protected by the paste remain white. In this simple manner\r\nhas the printing of calico been done for centuries for the garments\r\nof millions of children. From the ceiling of the drying room in this\r\nprintery of olden times were hanging some hundreds of stencils\r\nbearing different patterns. In our great calico mills, printing\r\nhundreds of yards per minute, the mechanics and the chemistry differ\r\nonly in detail of application and in dispatch, not in fundamental\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIn almost any direction we traveled outside the city, in the\r\npleasant mornings when the air was still, the laying of warp for\r\ncotton cloth could be seen, to be woven later in the country homes.\r\nWe saw this work in progress many times and in many places in the\r\nearly morning, usually along some roadside or open place, as seen in\r\nFig. 65, but never later in the day. When the warp is laid each will\r\nbe rolled upon its stretcher and removed to the house to be woven.\r\n\r\nIn many places in Kiangsu province batteries of the large dye pits\r\nwere seen sunk in the fields and lined with cement. These were six\r\nto eight feet in diameter and four to five feet deep. In one case\r\nobserved there were nine pits in the set. Some of the pits were\r\nneatly sheltered beneath live arbors, as represented in Fig. 66. But\r\nmuch of this spinning, weaving, dyeing and printing of late years is\r\nbeing displaced by the cheaper calicos of foreign make and most of\r\nthe dye pits we saw were not now used for this purpose, the two in\r\nthe illustration serving as manure receptacles. Our interpreter\r\nstated however that there is a growing dissatisfaction with foreign\r\ngoods on account of their lack of durability; and we saw many cases\r\nwhere the cloth dyed blue was being dried in large quantities on the\r\ngrave lands.\r\n\r\nIn another home for nearly an hour we observed a method of beating\r\ncotton and of laying it to serve as the body for mattresses and the\r\ncoverlets for beds. This we could do without intrusion because the\r\nhome was also the work shop and opened full width directly upon the\r\nnarrow street. The heavy wooden shutters which closed the home at\r\nnight were serving as a work bench about seven feet square, laid\r\nupon movable supports. There was barely room to work between it and\r\nthe sidewalk without impeding traffic, and on the three other sides\r\nthere was a floor space three or four feet wide. In the rear sat\r\ngrandmother and wife while in and out the four younger children were\r\nplaying. Occupying the two sides of the room were receptacles filled\r\nwith raw cotton and appliances for the work. There may have been a\r\nkitchen and sleeping room behind but no door, as such, was visible.\r\nThe finished mattresses, carefully rolled and wrapped in paper, were\r\nsuspended from the ceiling. On the improvised work table, with its\r\ntop two feet above the floor, there had been laid in the morning\r\nbefore our visit, a mass of soft white cotton more than six feet\r\nsquare and fully twelve inches deep. On opposite sides of this table\r\nthe father and his son, of twelve years, each twanged the string of\r\ntheir heavy bamboo bows, snapping the lint from the wads of cotton\r\nand flinging it broadcast in an even layer over the surface of the\r\ngrowing mattress, the two strings the while emitting tones pitched\r\nfar below the hum of the bumblebee. The heavy bow was steadied by a\r\ncord secured around the body of the operator, allowing him to manage\r\nit with one hand and to move readily around his work in a manner\r\ndifferent from the custom of the Japanese seen in Fig. 67. By this\r\nmeans the lint was expeditiously plucked and skillfully and\r\nuniformly laid, the twanging being effected by an appliance similar\r\nto that used in Japan.\r\n\r\nRepeatedly, taken in small bits from the barrel of cotton, the lint\r\nwas distributed over the entire surface with great dexterity and\r\nuniformity, the mattress growing upward with perfectly vertical\r\nsides, straight edges and square corners. In this manner a\r\nthoroughly uniform texture is secured which compresses into a body\r\nof even thickness, free from hard places.\r\n\r\nThe next step in building the mattress is even more simple and\r\nexpeditious. A basket of long bobbins of roughly spun cotton was\r\nnear the grandmother and probably her handiwork. The father took\r\nfrom the wall a slender bamboo rod like a fish-pole, six feet long,\r\nand selecting one of the spools, threaded the strand through an eye\r\nin the small end. With the pole and spool in one hand and the free\r\nend of the thread, passing through the eye, in the other, the father\r\nreached the thread across the mattress to the boy who hooked his\r\nfinger over it, carrying it to one edge of the bed of cotton. While\r\nthis was doing the father had whipped the pole back to his side and\r\ncaught the thread over his own finger, bringing this down upon the\r\ncotton opposite his son. There was thus laid a double strand, but\r\nthe pole continued whipping hack and forth across the bed, father\r\nand son catching the threads and bringing them to place on the\r\ncotton at the rate of forty to fifty courses per minute, and in a\r\nvery short time the entire surface of the mattress had been laid\r\nwith double strands. A heavy bamboo roller was next laid across the\r\nstrands at the middle, passed carefully to one side, back again to\r\nthe middle and then to the other edge. Another layer of threads was\r\nthen laid diagonally and this similarly pressed with the same\r\nroller; then another diagonally the other way and finally straight\r\nacross in both directions. A similar network of strands had been\r\nlaid upon the table before spreading the cotton. Next a flat\r\nbottomed, circular, shallow basket-like form two feet in diameter\r\nwas used to gently compress the material from twelve to six inches\r\nin thickness. The woven threads were now turned over the edge of the\r\nmattress on all sides and sewed down, after which, by means of two\r\nheavy solid wooden disks eighteen inches in diameter, father and son\r\ncompressed the cotton until the thickness was reduced to three\r\ninches. There remained the task of carefully folding and wrapping\r\nthe finished piece in oiled paper and of suspending it from the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nOn March 20th, when visiting the Boone Road and Nanking Road markets\r\nin Shanghai, we had our first surprise regarding the extent to which\r\nvegetables enter into the daily diet of the Chinese. We had observed\r\nlong processions of wheelbarrow men moving from the canals through\r\nthe streets carrying large loads of the green tips of rape in\r\nbundles a foot long and five inches in diameter. These had come from\r\nthe country on boats each carrying tons of the succulent leaves and\r\nstems. We had counted as many as fifty wheelbarrow men passing a\r\ngiven point on the street in quick succession, each carrying 300 to\r\n500 pounds of the green rape and moving so rapidly that it was not\r\neasy to keep pace with them, as we learned in following one of the\r\ntrains during twenty minutes to its destination. During this time\r\nnot a man in the train halted or slackened his pace.\r\n\r\nThis rape is very extensively grown in the fields, the tips of the\r\nstems cut when tender and eaten, after being boiled or steamed,\r\nafter the manner of cabbage. Very large quantities are also packed\r\nwith salt in the proportion of about twenty pounds of salt to one\r\nhundred pounds of the rape. This, Fig. 68, and many other vegetables\r\nare sold thus pickled and used as relishes with rice, which\r\ninvariably is cooked and served without salt or other seasoning.\r\n\r\nAnother field crop very extensively grown for human food, and partly\r\nas a source of soil nitrogen, is closely allied to our alfalfa. This\r\nis the Medicago astragalus, two beds of which are seen in Fig. 69.\r\nTender tips of the stems are gathered before the stage of blossoming\r\nis reached and served as food after boiling or steaming. It is known\r\namong the foreigners as Chinese \"clover.\" The stems are also cooked\r\nand then dried for use when the crop is out of season. When picked\r\nvery young, wealthy Chinese families pay an extra high price for the\r\ntender shoots, sometimes as much as 20 to 28 cents, our currency,\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\nThe markets are thronged with people making their purchases in the\r\nearly mornings, and the congested condition, with the great variety\r\nof vegetables, makes it almost as impressive a sight as Billingsgate\r\nfish market in London. In the following table we give a list of\r\nvegetables observed there and the prices at which they were selling.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nLIST OF VEGETABLES DISPLAYED FOR SALE IN BOONE ROAD MARKET,\r\n   SHANGHAI, APRIL 6TH, 1900, WITH PRICES EXPRESSED\r\n                  IN U.

The record is only\r\nsuch as was made in passing down one side and across one end of the\r\nmarket occupying nearly one city block. Nearly everything is sold by\r\nweight and the problem of correct weights is effectively solved by\r\neach purchaser carrying his own scales, which he unhesitatingly uses\r\nin the presence of the dealer. These scales are made on the pattern\r\nof the old time steelyards but from slender rods of wood or bamboo\r\nprovided with a scale and sliding poise, the suspensions all being\r\nmade with strings.\r\n\r\nWe stood by through the purchasing of two cockerels and the\r\ndickering over their weight. A dozen live birds were under cover in\r\na large, open-work basket. The customer took out the birds one by\r\none, examining them by touch, finally selecting two, the price being\r\nnamed. These the dealer tied together by their feet and weighed\r\nthem, announcing the result; whereupon the customer checked the\r\nstatement with his own scales. An animated dialogue followed,\r\npunctuated with many gesticulations and with the customer tossing\r\nthe birds into the basket and turning to go away while the dealer\r\ngrew more earnest. The purchaser finally turned back, and again\r\nbalancing the roosters upon his scales, called a bystander to read\r\nthe weight, and then flung them in apparent disdain at the dealer,\r\nwho caught them and placed them in the customer's basket. The storm\r\nsubsided and the dealer accepted 92c, Mexican, for the two birds.\r\nThey were good sized roosters and must have dressed more than three\r\npounds each, yet for the two he paid less than 40 cents in our\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nBamboo sprouts are very generally used in China, Korea and Japan and\r\nwhen one sees them growing they suggest giant stalks of asparagus,\r\nsome of them being three and even five inches in diameter and a foot\r\nin height at the stage for cutting. They are shipped in large\r\nquantities from province to province where they do not grow or when\r\nthey are out of season. Those we saw in Nagasaki referred to in Fig.\r\n22, had come from Canton or Swatow or possibly Formosa. The form,\r\nfoliage and bloom of the bamboo give the most beautiful effects in\r\nthe landscape, especially when grouped with tree forms. They are\r\nusually cultivated in small clumps about dwellings in places not\r\notherwise readily utilized, as seen in Fig. 66. Like the asparagus\r\nbud, the bamboo sprout grows to its full height between April and\r\nAugust, even when it exceeds thirty or even sixty feet in height.\r\nThe buds spring from fleshy underground stems or roots whose stored\r\nnourishment permits this rapid growth, which in its earlier stages\r\nmay exceed twelve inches in twenty-four hours. But while the full\r\nsize of the plant is attained the first season, three or four years\r\nare required to ripen and harden the wood sufficiently to make it\r\nsuitable for the many uses to which the stems are put. It would seem\r\nthat the time must come when some of the many forms of bamboo will\r\nbe introduced and largely grown in many parts of this country.\r\n\r\nLotus roots form another article of diet largely used and widely\r\ncultivated from Canton to Tokyo. These are seen in the lower section\r\nof Fig. 70, and the plants in bloom in Fig. 71, growing in water,\r\ntheir natural habitat. The lotus is grown in permanent ponds not\r\nreadily drained for rice or other crops, and the roots are widely\r\nshipped.\r\n\r\nSprouted beans and peas of many kinds and the sprouts of other\r\nvegetables, such as onions, are very generally seen in the markets\r\nof both China and Japan, at least during the late winter and early\r\nspring, and are sold as foods, having different flavors and\r\ndigestive qualities, and no doubt with important advantageous\r\neffects in nutrition.\r\n\r\nGinger is another. crop which is very widely and extensively\r\ncultivated. It is generally displayed in the market in the root\r\nform. No one thing was more generally hawked about the streets of\r\nChina than the water chestnut. This is a small corm or fleshy bulb\r\nhaving the shape and size of a small onion. Boys pare them and sell\r\na dozen spitted together on slender sticks the length of a knitting\r\nneedle. Then there are the water caltropes, grown in the canals\r\nproducing a fruit resembling a horny nut having a shape which\r\nsuggests for them the name \"buffalo-horn\". Still another plant,\r\nknown as water-grass (Hydropyrum latifolium) is grown in Kiangsu\r\nprovince where the land is too wet for rice. The plant has a tender\r\nsucculent crown of leaves and the peeling of the outer coarser ones\r\naway suggests the husking of an ear of green corn. The portion eaten\r\nis the central tender new growth, and when cooked forms a delicate\r\nsavory dish. The farmers' selling price is three to four dollars,\r\nMexican, per hundred catty, or $.97 to $1.29 per hundredweight, and\r\nthe return per acre is from $13 to $20.\r\n\r\nThe small number of animal products which are included in the market\r\nlist given should not be taken as indicating the proportion of\r\nanimal to vegetable foods in the dietaries of these people. It is\r\nnevertheless true that they are vegetarians to a far higher degree\r\nthan are most western nations, and the high maintenance efficiency\r\nof the agriculture of China, Korea and Japan is in great measure\r\nrendered possible by the adoption of a diet so largely vegetarian.\r\nHopkins, in his Soil Fertility and Permanent Agriculture, page 234,\r\nmakes this pointed statement of fact: \"1000 bushels of grain has at\r\nleast five times as much food value and will support five times as\r\nmany people as will the meat or milk that can be made from it\". He\r\nalso calls attention to the results of many Rothamsted feeding\r\nexperiments with growing and fattening cattle, sheep and swine,\r\nshowing that the cattle destroyed outright, in every 100 pounds of\r\ndry substance eaten, 57.3 pounds, this passing off into the air, as\r\ndoes all of wood except the ashes, when burned in the stove; they\r\nleft in the excrements 36.5 pounds, and stored as increase but 6.2\r\npounds of the 100. With sheep the corresponding figures were 60.1\r\npounds; 31.9 pounds and 8 pounds; and with swine they were 65.7\r\npounds; 16.7 pounds and 17.6 pounds. But less than two-thirds of the\r\nsubstance stored in the animal can become food for man and hence we\r\nget but four pounds in one hundred of the dry substances eaten by\r\ncattle in the form of human food; but five pounds from the sheep and\r\neleven pounds from swine.\r\n\r\nIn view of these relations, only recently established as scientific\r\nfacts by rigid research, it is remarkable that these very ancient\r\npeople came long ago to discard cattle as milk and meat producers;\r\nto use sheep more for their pelts and wool than for food; while\r\nswine are the one kind of the three classes which they did retain in\r\nthe role of middleman as transformers of coarse substances into\r\nhuman food.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in the adoption of the succulent forms of\r\nvegetables as human food important advantages are gained. At this\r\nstage of maturity they have a higher digestibility, thus making the\r\nelimination of the animal less difficult. Their nitrogen content is\r\nrelatively higher and this in a measure compensates for loss of\r\nmeat. By devoting the soil to growing vegetation which man can\r\ndirectly digest they have saved 60 pounds per 100 of absolute waste\r\nby the animal, returning their own wastes to the field for the\r\nmaintenance of fertility. In using these immature forms of\r\nvegetation so largely as food they are able to produce an immense\r\namount that would otherwise be impossible, for this is grown in a\r\nshorter time, permitting the same soil to produce more crops. It is\r\nalso produced late in the fall and early in the spring when the\r\nseason is too cold and the hours of sunshine too few each day to\r\npermit of ripening crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FUEL PROBLEM, BUILDING AND\r\nTEXTILE MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the vast and ever increasing demands made upon materials which\r\nare the products of cultivated fields, for food, for apparel, for\r\nfurnishings and for cordage, better soil management must grow more\r\nimportant as populations multiply. With the increasing cost and\r\nultimate exhaustion of mineral fuel; with our timber vanishing\r\nrapidly before the ever growing demands for lumber and paper; with\r\nthe inevitably slow growth of trees and the very limited areas which\r\nthe world can ever afford to devote to forestry, the time must\r\nsurely come when, in short period rotations, there will be grown\r\nupon the farm materials from which to manufacture not only paper and\r\nthe substitutes for lumber, but fuels as well. The complete\r\nutilization of every stream which reaches the sea, reinforced by the\r\nforce of the winds and the energy of the waves which may be\r\ntransformed along the coast lines, cannot fully meet the demands of\r\nthe future for power and heat; hence only in the event of science\r\nand engineering skill becoming able to devise means for transforming\r\nthe unlimited energy of space through which we are ever whirled,\r\nwith an economy approximating that which crops now exhibit, can good\r\nsoil management be relieved of the task of meeting a portion of the\r\nworld's demand for power and heat.\r\n\r\nWhen these statements were made in 1905 we did not know that for\r\ncenturies there had existed in China, Korea and Japan a density of\r\npopulation such as to require the extensive cultivation of crops for\r\nfuel and building material, as well as for fabrics, by the ordinary\r\nmethods of tillage, and hence another of the many surprises we had\r\nwas the solution these people had reached of their fuel problem and\r\nof how to keep warm. Their solution has been direct and the simplest\r\npossible. Dress to make fuel for warmth of body unnecessary, and\r\nburn the coarser stems of crops, such as cannot be eaten, fed to\r\nanimals or otherwise made useful. These people still use what wood\r\ncan be grown on the untillable land within transporting distance,\r\nand convert much wood into charcoal, making transportation over\r\nlonger distances easier. The general use of mineral fuels, such as\r\ncoal, coke, oils and gas, had been impossible to these as to every\r\nother people until within the last one hundred years. Coal, coke,\r\noil and natural gas, however, have been locally used by the Chinese\r\nfrom very ancient times. For more than two thousand years brine from\r\nmany deep wells in Szechwan province has been evaporated with heat\r\ngenerated by the burning of natural gas from wells, conveyed through\r\nbamboo stems to the pans and burned from iron terminals. In other\r\nsections of the same province much brine is evaporated over coal\r\nfires. Alexander Hosie estimates the production of salt in Szechwan\r\nprovince at more than 600 million pounds annually.\r\n\r\nCoal is here used also to some extent for warming the houses, burned\r\nin pits sunk in the floor, the smoke escaping where it may. The same\r\nmethod of heating we saw in use in the post office at Yokohama\r\nduring February. The fires were in large iron braziers more than two\r\nfeet across the top, simply set about the room, three being in\r\noperation. Stoves for house warming are not used in dwellings in\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\nIn both China and Japan we saw coal dust put into the form and size\r\nof medium oranges by mixing it with a thin paste of clay. Charcoal\r\nis similarly molded, as seen in Fig. 72, using a by-product from the\r\nmanufacture of rice syrup for cementing. In Nanking we watched with\r\nmuch interest the manufacture of charcoal briquets by another\r\nmethod. A Chinese workman was seated upon the earth floor of a shop.\r\nBy his side was a pile of powdered charcoal, a dish of rice syrup\r\nby-product and a basin of the moistened charcoal powder. Between his\r\nlegs was a heavy mass of iron containing a slightly conical mold two\r\ninches deep, two and a half inches across at the top and a heavy\r\niron hammer weighing several pounds. In his left hand he held a\r\nshort heavy ramming tool and with his right placed in the mold a\r\npinch of the moistened charcoal; then followed three well directed\r\nblows from the hammer upon the ramming tool, compressing the charge\r\nof moistened, sticky charcoal into a very compact layer. Another\r\npinch of charcoal was added and the process repeated until the mold\r\nwas filled, when the briquet was forced out.\r\n\r\nBy this simplest possible mechanism, the man, utilizing but a small\r\npart of his available energy, was subjecting the charcoal to an\r\nenormous pressure such as we attain only with the best hydraulic\r\npresses, and he was using the principle of repeated small charges\r\nrecently patented and applied in our large and most efficient cotton\r\nand hay presses, which permit much denser bales to be made than is\r\npossible when large charges are added, and the Chinese is here, as\r\nin a thousand other ways, thoroughly sound in his application of\r\nmechanical principles. His output for the day was small but his\r\npatience seemed unlimited. His arms and body, bared to the waist,\r\nshowed vigor and good feeding, while his face wore the look of\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nWith forty centuries of such inheritance coursing in the veins of\r\nfour hundred millions of people, in a country possessed of such\r\nmarvelous wealth of coal and water power, of forest and of\r\nagricultural possibilities, there should be a future speedily\r\nblossoming and ripening into all that is highest and best for such a\r\nnation. If they will retain their economies and their industry and\r\nuse their energies to develop, direct and utilize the power in their\r\nstreams and in their coal fields along the lines which science has\r\nnow made possible to them, at the same time walking in paths of\r\npeace and virtue, there is little worth while which may not come to\r\nsuch a people.\r\n\r\nA Shantung farmer in winter dress, Fig. 18, and the Kiangsu woman\r\nportrayed in Fig. 73, in corresponding costume, are typical\r\nillustrations of the manner in which food for body warmth is\r\nminimized and of the way the heat generated in the body is\r\nconserved. Observe his wadded and quilted frock, his trousers of\r\nsimilar goods tied about the ankle, with his feet clad in multiple\r\nsocks and cloth shoes provided with thick felted soles. These types\r\nof dress, with the wadding, quilting, belting and tying, incorporate\r\nand confine as part of the effective material a large volume of air,\r\nthus securing without cost, much additional warmth without\r\nincreasing the weight of the garments. Beneath these outer garments\r\nseveral under pieces of different weights are worn which greatly\r\nconserve the warmth during the coldest weather and make possible a\r\nwide range of adjustment to suit varying changes in temperature. It\r\nis doubtful if there could he devised a wardrobe suited to the\r\nconditions of these people at a smaller first cost and maintenance\r\nexpense. Rev. E. A. Evans, of the China Inland Mission, for many\r\nyears residing at Sunking in Szechwan, estimated that a farmer's\r\nwardrobe, once it was procured, could be maintained with an annual\r\nexpenditure of $2.25 of our currency, this sum procuring the\r\nmaterials for both repairs and renewals.\r\n\r\nThe intense individual economy, extending to the smallest matters,\r\nso universally practiced by these people, has sustained the massive\r\nstrength of the Mongolian nations through their long history and\r\nthis trait is seen in their handling of the fuel problem, as it is\r\nin all other lines. In the home of Mrs. Wu, owner and manager of a\r\n25-acre rice farm in Chekiang province, there was a masonry kang\r\nseven by seven feet, about twenty-eight inches high, which could be\r\nwarmed in winter by building a fire within. The top was fitted for\r\nmats to serve as couch by day and as a place upon which to spread\r\nthe bed at night. In the Shantung province we visited the home of a\r\nprosperous farmer and here found two kangs in separate sleeping\r\napartments, both warmed by the waste heat from the kitchen whose\r\nchimney flue passed horizontally under the kangs before rising\r\nthrough the roof. These kangs were wide enough to spread the beds\r\nupon, about thirty inches high, and had been constructed from brick\r\ntwelve inches square and four inches thick, made from the clay\r\nsubsoil taken from the fields and worked into a plastic mass, mixed\r\nwith chaff and short straw, dried in the sun and then laid in a\r\nmortar of the same material. These massive kangs are thus capable of\r\nabsorbing large amounts of the waste heat from the kitchen during\r\nthe day and of imparting congenial warmth to the couches by day and\r\nto the beds and sleeping apartments during the night. In some\r\nManchurian inns large compound kangs are so arranged that the guests\r\nsleep heads together in double rows, separated only by low dividing\r\nrails, securing the greatest economy of fuel, providing the guests\r\nwith places where they may sit upon the moderately warmed fireplace,\r\nand spread their beds when they retire.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the chimney beds does not end with the warmth\r\nconserved. The earth and straw brick, through the processes of\r\nfermentation and through shrinkage, become open and porous after\r\nthree or four years of service, so that the draft is defective,\r\ngiving annoyance from smoke, which requires their renewal. But the\r\nheat, the fermentation and the absorption of products of combustion\r\nhave together transformed the comparatively infertile subsoil into\r\nwhat they regard as a valuable fertilizer and these discarded brick\r\nare used in the preparation of compost fertilizers for the fields.\r\nOn account of this value of the discarded brick the large amount of\r\nlabor involved in removing and rebuilding the kangs is not regarded\r\naltogether as labor lost.\r\n\r\nOur own observations have shown that heating soils to dryness at a\r\ntemperature of 110 deg C. greatly increases the freedom with which\r\nplant food may be recovered from them by the solvent power of water,\r\nand the same heating doubtless improves the physical and biological\r\nconditions of the soil as well. Nitrogen combined as ammonia, and\r\nphosphorus, potash and lime are all carried with the smoke or soot,\r\nmechanically in the draft and arrested upon the inner walls of the\r\nkangs or filter into the porous brick with the smoke, and thus add\r\nplant food directly to the soil. Soot from wood has been found to\r\ncontain, as an average, 1.36 per cent of nitrogen; .51 per cent of\r\nphosphorus and 5.34 per cent of potassium. We practice burning straw\r\nand corn stalks in enormous quantities, to get them easily out of\r\nthe way, thus scattering on the winds valuable plant food,\r\nthoughtlessly and lazily wasting where these people laboriously and\r\nreligiously save. These are gains in addition to those which result\r\nfrom the formation of nitrates, soluble potash and other plant foods\r\nthrough fermentation. We saw many instances where these discarded\r\nbrick were being used, both in Shantung and Chihli provinces, and it\r\nwas common in walking through the streets of country villages to see\r\npiles of them, evidently recently removed.\r\n\r\nThe fuel grown on the farms consists of the stems of all\r\nagricultural crops which are to any extent woody, unless they can be\r\nput to some better use. Rice straw, cotton stems pulled by the roots\r\nafter the seed has been gathered, the stems of windsor beans, those\r\nof rape and the millets, all pulled by the roots, and many other\r\nkinds, are brought to the market tied in bundles in the manner seen\r\nin Figs. 74, 75 and 76. These fuels are used for domestic purposes\r\nand for the burning of lime, brick, roofing tile and earthenware as\r\nwell as in the manufacture of oil, tea, bean-curd and many other\r\nprocesses. In the home, when the meals are cooked with these light\r\nbulky fuels, it is the duty of some one, often one of the children,\r\nto sit on the floor and feed the fire with one hand while with the\r\nother a bellows is worked to secure sufficient draft. The\r\nmanufacture of cotton seed oil and cotton seed cake is one of the\r\ncommon family industries in China, and in one of these homes we saw\r\nrice hulls and rice straw being used as fuel. In the large low,\r\none-story, tile-roofed building serving as store, warehouse, factory\r\nand dwelling, a family of four generations were at work, the\r\ngrandfather supervising in the mill and the grandmother leading in\r\nthe home and store where the cotton seed oil was being. retailed for\r\n22 cents per pound and the cotton seed cake at 33 cents, gold, per\r\nhundredweight. Back of the store and living rooms, in the mill\r\ncompartment, three blindfolded water buffalo, each working a granite\r\nmill, were crushing and grinding the cotton seed. Three other\r\nbuffalo, for relay service, were lying at rest or eating, awaiting\r\ntheir turn at the ten-hour working day. Two of the mills were\r\nhorizontal granite burrs more than four feet in diameter, the upper\r\none revolving once with each circuit made by the cow. The third mill\r\nwas a pair of massive granite rollers, each five feet in diameter\r\nand two feet thick, joined on a very short horizontal axle which\r\nrevolved on a circular stone plate about a vertical axis once with\r\neach circuit of the buffalo. Two men tended the three mills. After\r\nthe cotton seed had been twice passed through the mills it was\r\nsteamed to render the oil fluid and more readily expressed. The\r\nsteamer consisted of two covered wooden hoops not unlike that seen\r\nin Fig. 77, provided with screen bottoms, and in these the meal was\r\nplaced over openings in the top of an iron kettle of boiling water\r\nfrom which the steam was forced through the charge of meal. Each\r\ncharge was weighed in a scoop balanced on the arm of a bamboo scale,\r\nthus securing a uniform weight for the cakes.\r\n\r\nOn the ground in front of the furnace sat a boy of twelve years\r\nsteadily feeding rice chaff into the fire with his left hand at the\r\nrate of about thirty charges per minute, while with his right hand,\r\nand in perfect rhythm, he drew back and forth the long plunger of a\r\nrectangular box bellows, maintaining a forced draft for the fire. At\r\nintervals the man who was bringing fuel fed into the furnace a\r\nbundle of rice straw, thus giving the boy's left arm a moment's\r\nrespite. When the steaming has rendered the oil sufficiently fluid\r\nthe meal is transferred, hot, to ten-inch hoops two inches deep,\r\nmade of braided bamboo strands, and is deftly tramped with the bare\r\nfeet, while hot, the operator steadying himself by a pair of hand\r\nbars. After a stack of sixteen hoops, divided by a slight sifting of\r\nchaff or short straw to separate the cakes, had been completed these\r\nwere taken to one of four pressmen, who were kept busy in expressing\r\nthe oil.\r\n\r\nThe presses consisted of two parallel timbers framed together, long\r\nenough to receive the sixteen hoops on edge above a gap between\r\nthem. These cheeses of meal are subjected to an enormous pressure\r\nsecured by means of three parallel lines of wedges forced against\r\nthe follower each by an iron-bound master wedge, driven home with a\r\nheavy beetle weighing some twenty-five or thirty pounds. The lines\r\nof wedges were tightened in succession, the loosened line receiving\r\nan additional wedge to take up the slack after drawing back the\r\nmaster wedge, which was then driven home. To keep good the supply of\r\nwedges which are often crushed under the pressure a second boy,\r\nolder than the one at the furnace, was working on the floor, shaping\r\nnew ones, the broken wedges and the chips going to the furnace for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nBy this very simple, readily constructed and inexpensive mechanism\r\nenormous pressures were secured and when the operator had obtained\r\nthe desired compression he lighted his pipe and sat down to smoke\r\nuntil the oil ceased dripping into the pit sunk in the floor beneath\r\nthe press. In this interval the next series of cakes went to another\r\npress and the work thus kept up during the day.\r\n\r\nSix hundred and forty cakes was the average daily output of this\r\nfamily of eight men and two boys, with their six water buffalo. The\r\ncotton seed cakes were being sold as feed, and a near-by Chinese\r\ndairyman was using them for his herd of forty water buffalo, seen in\r\nFig. 78, producing milk for the foreign trade in Shanghai. This herd\r\nof forty cows one of which was an albino, was giving an average of\r\nbut 200 catty of milk per day, or at the rate of six and two-thirds\r\npounds per head! The cows have extremely small udders but the milk\r\nis very rich, as indicated by an analysis made in the office of the\r\nShanghai Board of Health and obtained through the kindness of Dr.\r\nArthur Stanley. The milk showed a specific gravity of 1.028 and\r\ncontained 20.1 per cent total solids; 7.5 per cent fat; 4.2 per cent\r\nmilk sugar and .8 per cent ash. In the family of Rev. W. H. Hudson,\r\nof the Southern Presbyterian Mission, Kashing, whose very gracious\r\nhospitality we enjoyed on two different occasions, the butter made\r\nfrom the milk of two of these cows, one of which, with her calf, is\r\nseen in Fig. 79, was used on the family table. It was as white as\r\nlard or cottolene but the texture and flavor were normal and far\r\nbetter than the Danish and New Zealand products served at the\r\nhotels.\r\n\r\nThe milk produced at the Chinese dairy in Shanghai was being sold in\r\nbottles holding two pounds, at the rate of one dollar a bottle, or\r\n43 cents, gold. This seems high and there may have been\r\nmisunderstanding on the part of my interpreter but his answer to my\r\nquestion was that the milk was being sold at one Shanghai dollar per\r\nbottle holding one and a half catty, which, interpreted, is the\r\nvalue given above.\r\n\r\nBut fuel from the stems of cultivated plants which are in part\r\notherwise useful, is not sufficient to meet the needs of country and\r\nvillage, notwithstanding the intense economies practiced. Large\r\nareas of hill and mountain land are made to contribute their share,\r\nas we have seen in the south of China, where pine boughs were being\r\nused for firing the lime and cement kilns. At Tsingtao we saw the\r\npine bough fuel on the backs of mules, Fig. 80, coming from the\r\nhills in Shantung province. Similar fuels were being used in Korea\r\nand we have photographs of large pine bough fuel stacks, taken in\r\nJapan at Funabashi, east from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nThe hill and mountain lands, wherever accessible to the densely\r\npeopled plains, have long been cut over and as regularly has\r\nafforestation been encouraged and deliberately secured even through\r\nthe transplanting of nursery stock grown expressly for that purpose.\r\nWe had read so much regarding the reckless destruction of forests in\r\nChina and Japan and had seen so few old forest trees except where\r\nthese had been protected about temples, graves or houses, that when\r\nRev. R. A. Haden, of the Elizabeth Blake hospital, near Soochow\r\ninsisted that the Chinese were deliberate foresters and that they\r\nregularly grow trees for fuel, transplanting them when necessary to\r\nsecure a close and early stand, after the area had been cleared, we\r\nwere so much surprised that he generously volunteered to accompany\r\nus westward on a two days journey into the hill country where the\r\npractice could be seen.\r\n\r\nA family owning a houseboat and living upon it was engaged for the\r\njourney. This family consisted of a recently widowed father, his two\r\nsons, newly married, and a helper. They were to transport us and\r\nprovide sleeping quarters for myself, Mr. Haden and a cook for the\r\nconsideration of $3.00, Mexican, per day and to continue the journey\r\nthrough the night, leaving the day for observation in the hills.\r\n\r\nThe recent funeral had cost the father $100 and the wedding of the\r\ntwo sons $50 each, while the remodeling of the houseboat to meet the\r\nneeds of the new family relations cost still another $100. To meet\r\nthese expenses it had been necessary to borrow the full amount,\r\n$300. On $100 the father was paying 20 per cent interest; on $50 he\r\nwas compelled to pay 50 per cent interest. The balance he had\r\nborrowed from friends without interest but with the understanding\r\nthat he would return the favor should occasion be required.\r\n\r\nRev. A. E. Evans informed us that it is a common practice in China\r\nfor neighbors to help one another in times of great financial\r\nstress. This is one of the methods:\r\n\r\nA neighbor may need 8000 cash. He prepares a feast and sends\r\ninvitations to a hundred friends. They know there has been no death\r\nin his family and that there is no wedding, still it is understood\r\nthat he is in need of money. The feast is prepared at a small\r\nexpense. The invited guests come, each bringing eighty cash as a\r\npresent. The recipient is expected to keep a careful record of\r\ncontributing friends and to repay the sum. Another method is like\r\nthis: For some reason a man needs to borrow 20,000 cash. He proposes\r\nto twenty of his friends that they organize a club to raise this\r\nsum. If the friends agree each pays 1000 cash to the organizing\r\nmember. The balance of the club draw lots as to which member shall\r\nbe number two, three, four, five, etc., designating the order in\r\nwhich payments shall be made. The man borrowing the money is then\r\nunder obligation to see that these payments are met in full at the\r\ntimes agreed upon. Not infrequently a small rate of interest is\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nRates of interest are very high in China, especially on small sums\r\nwhere securities are not the best. Mr. Evans informs me that two per\r\ncent per month is low and thirty per cent per annum is very commonly\r\ncollected. Such obligations are often never met but they do not\r\noutlaw and may descend from father to son.\r\n\r\nThe boat cost $292.40 in U. S. currency; the yearly earning was\r\n$107.50 to $120.40. The funeral cost $43 and $43 more was required\r\nfor the wedding of the two sons. They were receiving for the\r\nservices of six people $1.29 per day. An engagement for two weeks or\r\na month could have been made for materially lower rates and their\r\naverage daily earning, on the basis of three hundred days service in\r\nthe year, and the $120.40 total earning, would be only 40.13 cents,\r\nless than seven cents each, hence their trip with us was two of\r\ntheir banner days. Foreigners in Shanghai and other cities\r\nfrequently engage such houseboat service for two weeks or a month of\r\ntravel on the canals and rivers, finding it a very enjoyable as well\r\nas inexpensive way of having a picnic outing.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the hill lands the next morning there were such scenes\r\nas shown in Fig. 82, where the strips of tree growth, varying from\r\ntwo to ten years, stretched directly up the slope, often in strong\r\ncontrast on account of the straight boundaries and different ages of\r\nthe timber. Some of these long narrow holdings were less than two\r\nrods wide and on one of these only recently cut, up which we walked\r\nfor considerable distance, the young pine were springing up in\r\ngoodly numbers. As many as eighteen young trees were counted on a\r\nwidth of six feet across the strip of thirty feet wide. On this area\r\neverything had been recently cut clean. Even stumps and the large\r\nroots were dug and saved for fuel.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 83 are seen bundles of fuel from such a strip, just brought\r\ninto the village, the boughs retaining the leaves although the fuel\r\nhad been dried. The roots, too, are tied in with the limbs so that\r\neverything is saved. On our walk to the hills we passed many people\r\nbringing their loads of fuel swinging from carrying poles on their\r\nshoulders. Inquiries regarding the afforestation of these strips of\r\nhillside showed that the extensive digging necessitated by the\r\nrecovery of the roots usually caused new trees to spring up quickly\r\nas volunteers from scattered seed and from the roots, so that\r\nplanting was not generally required. Talking with a group of people\r\nas to where we could see some of the trees used for replanting the\r\nhillsides, a lad of seven years was first to understand and\r\nvolunteered to conduct us to a planting. This he did and was\r\noverjoyed on receipt of a trifle for his services. One of these\r\nlittle pine nurseries is seen in Fig. 84, many being planted in\r\nsuitable places through the woods. The lad led us to two such\r\nlocations with whose whereabouts he was evidently very familiar,\r\nalthough they were considerable distance from the path and far from\r\nhome. These small trees are used in filling in places where the\r\nvolunteer growth has not been sufficiently close. A strong\r\nherbaceous growth usually springs up quickly on these newly cleared\r\nlands and this too is cut for fuel or for use in making compost or\r\nas green manure.\r\n\r\nThe grass which grows on the grave lands, if not fed off, is also\r\ncut and saved for fuel. We saw several instances of this outside of\r\nShanghai, one where a mother with her daughter, provided with rake,\r\nsickle, basket and bag, were gathering the dry stubble and grass of\r\nthe previous season, from the grave lands where there was less than\r\ncould be found on our closely mowed meadows. In Fig. 85 may be seen\r\na man who has just returned with such a load, and in his hand is the\r\ntypical rake of the Far East, made by simply bending bamboo splints,\r\nclaw-shape, and securing them as seen in the engraving.\r\n\r\nIn the Shantung province, in Chihli and in Manchuria, millet stems,\r\nespecially those of the great kaoliang or sorghum, are extensively\r\nused for fuel and for building as well as for screens, fences and\r\nmatting. At Mukden the kaoliang was selling as fuel at $2.70 to\r\n$3.00, Mexican, for a 100-bundle load of stalks, weighing seven\r\ncatty to the bundle. The yield per acre of kaoliang fuel amounts to\r\n5600 pounds and the stalks are eight to twelve feet long, so that\r\nwhen carried on the backs of mules or horses the animals are nearly\r\nhidden by the load. The price paid for plant stem fuel from\r\nagricultural crops, in different parts of China and Japan, ranged\r\nfrom $1.30 to $2.85, U. S. currency, per ton. The price of\r\nanthracite coal at Nanking was $7.76 per ton. Taking the weight of\r\ndry oak wood at 3500 pounds per cord, the plant stem fuel, for equal\r\nweight, was selling at $2.28 to $5.00.\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of wood are converted into charcoal in these countries\r\nand sent to market baled in rough matting or in basketwork cases\r\nwoven from small brush and holding two to two and a half bushels.\r\nWhen such wood is not converted into charcoal it is sawed into one\r\nor two-foot lengths, split and marketed tied in bundles, as seen in\r\nFig. 77.\r\n\r\nAlong the Mukden-Antung railway in Manchuria fuel was also being\r\nshipped in four-foot lengths, in the form of cordwood. In Korea\r\ncattle were provided with a peculiar saddle for carrying wood in\r\nfour-foot sticks laid blanket-fashion over the animal, extending far\r\ndown on their sides. Thus was it brought from the hills to the\r\nrailway station. This wood, as in Manchuria, was cut from small\r\ntrees. In Korea, as in most parts of China where we visited, the\r\ntree growth over the hills was generally scattering and thin on the\r\nground wherever there was not individual ownership in small\r\nholdings. Under and among the scattering pine there were oak in many\r\ncases, but these were always small, evidently not more than two or\r\nthree years standing, and appearing to have been repeatedly cut\r\nback. It was in Korea that we saw so many instances of young leafy\r\noak boughs brought to the rice fields and used as green manure.\r\n\r\nThere was abundant evidence of periodic cutting between Mukden and\r\nAntung in Manchuria; between Wiju and Fusan in Korea; and throughout\r\nmost of our journey in Japan; from Nagasaki to Moji and from\r\nShimonoseki to Yokohama. In all of these countries afforestation\r\ntakes place quickly and the cuttings on private holdings are made\r\nonce in ten, twenty or twenty-five years. When the wood is sold to\r\nthose coming for it the takers pay at the rate of 40 sen per one\r\nhorse load of forty kan, or 330 pounds, such as is seen in Fig. 87.\r\nDirector Ono, of the Akashi Experiment station, informed us that\r\nsuch fuel loads in that prefecture, where the wood is cut once in\r\nten years, bring returns amounting to about $40 per acre for the\r\nten-year crop. This land was worth $40 per acre but when they are\r\nsuitable for orange groves they sell for $600 per acre. Mushroom\r\nculture is extensively practiced under the shade of some of these\r\nwooded areas, yielding under favorable conditions at the rate of\r\n$100 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe forest covered area in Japan exclusive of Formosa and Karafuto,\r\namounts to a total of 54,196,728 acres, less than twenty millions of\r\nwhich are in private holdings, the balance belonging to the state\r\nand to the Imperial Crown.\r\n\r\nIn all of these countries there has been an extensive general use of\r\nmaterials other than wood for building purposes and very many of the\r\nsubstitutes for lumber are products grown on the cultivated fields.\r\nThe use of rice straw for roofing, as seen in the Hakone village,\r\nFig. 8, is very general throughout the rice growing districts, and\r\neven the sides of houses may be similarly thatched, as was observed\r\nin the Canton delta region, such a construction being warm for\r\nwinter and cool for summer. The life of these thatched roofs,\r\nhowever, is short and they must be renewed as often as every three\r\nto five years but the old straw is highly prized as fertilizer for\r\nthe fields on which it is grown, or it may serve as fuel, the ashes\r\nonly going to the fields.\r\n\r\nBurned clay tile, especially for the cities and public buildings,\r\nare very extensively used for roofing, clay being abundant and near\r\nat hand. In Chihli and in Manchuria millet and sorghum stems, used\r\nalone or plastered, as in Fig. 88, with a mud mortar, sometimes\r\nmixed with lime, cover the roofs of vast numbers of the dwellings\r\noutside the larger cities.\r\n\r\nAt Chiao Tou in Manchuria we saw the building of the thatched millet\r\nroofs and the use of kaoliang stems as lumber. Rafters were set in\r\nthe usual way and covered with a layer about two inches thick of the\r\nlong kaoliang stems stripped of their leaves and tops. These were\r\ntied together and to the rafters with twine, thus forming a sort of\r\nmatting. A layer of thin clay mortar was then spread over the\r\nsurface and well trowelled until it began to show on the under side.\r\nOver this was applied a thatch of small millet stems bound in\r\nbundles eight inches thick, cut square across the butts to eighteen\r\ninches in length. They were dipped in water and laid in courses\r\nafter the manner of shingles but the butts of the stems are driven\r\nforward to a slope which obliterates the shoulder, making the\r\ncourses invisible. In the better houses this thatching may be\r\nplastered with earth mortar or with an earth-lime mortar, which is\r\nless liable to wash in heavy rain.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the house we saw building were also sided with the\r\nlong, large kaoliang stems. An ordinary frame with posts and girts\r\nabout three feet apart had been erected, on sills and with plates\r\ncarrying the roof. Standing vertically against the girts and tied to\r\nthem, forming a close layer, were the kaoliang stems. These were\r\nplastered outside and in with a layer of thin earth mortar. A\r\nsimilar layer of stems, set up on the inside of the girts and\r\nsimilarly plastered, formed the inner face of the wall of the house,\r\nleaving dead air spaces between the girts.\r\n\r\nBrick made from earth are very extensively used for house building,\r\nchaff and short straw being used as a binding material, the brick\r\nbeing simply dried in the sun, as seen in Fig. 89. A house in the\r\nprocess of building, where the brick were being used, is seen in\r\nFig. 90. The foundation of the dwelling, it will be observed, was\r\nlaid with well-formed hard-burned brick, these being necessary to\r\nprevent capillary moisture from the ground being drawn up and soften\r\nthe earth brick, making the wall unsafe.\r\n\r\nSeveral kilns for burning brick, built of clay and earth, were\r\npassed in our journey up the Pei ho, and stacked about them,\r\ncovering an area of more than eight hundred feet back from the river\r\nwere bundles of the kaoliang stems to serve as fuel in the kilns.\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of the unburned brick is necessitated by the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining fuel, and various methods are adopted to\r\nreduce the number of burned brick required in construction. One of\r\nthese devices is shown in Fig. 79, where the city wall surrounding\r\nKashing is constructed of alternate courses of four layers of burned\r\nbrick separated by layers of simple earth concrete.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the multiple-function, farm-gown crops used for food,\r\nfuel and building material, there is a large acreage devoted to the\r\ngrowing of textile and fiber products and enormous quantities of\r\nthese are produced annually. In Japan, where some fifty millions of\r\npeople are chiefly fed on the produce of little more than 21,000\r\nsquare miles of cultivated land, there was grown in 1906 more than\r\n75,500,000 pounds of cotton, hemp, flax and China grass textile\r\nstock, occupying 76,700 acres of the cultivated land. On 141,000\r\nother acres there grew 115,000,000 pounds of paper mulberry and\r\nMitsumata, materials used in the manufacture of paper. From still\r\nanother 14,000 acres were taken 92,000,000 pounds of matting stuff,\r\nwhile more than 957,000 acres were occupied by mulberry trees for\r\nthe feeding of silkworms, yielding to Japan 22,389,798 pounds of\r\nsilk. Here are more than 300,000,000 pounds of fiber and textile\r\nstuff taken from 1860 square miles of the cultivated land, cutting\r\ndown the food producing area to 19,263 square miles and this area is\r\nmade still smaller by devoting 123,000 acres to tea, these producing\r\nin 1906 58,900,000 pounds, worth nearly five million dollars. Nor do\r\nthese statements express the full measure of the producing power of\r\nthe 21,321 square miles of cultivated land, for, in addition to the\r\nfood and other materials named, there were also made $2,365,000\r\nworth of braid from straw and wood shavings; $6,000,000 worth of\r\nrice straw bags, packing cases and matting; and $1,085,000 worth of\r\nwares from bamboo, willow and vine. As illustrating the intense home\r\nindustry of these people we may consider the fact that the 5,453,309\r\nhouseholds of farmers in Japan produced in 1906, in their homes as\r\nsubsidiary work, $20,527,000 worth of manufactured articles. If\r\ncorrespondingly exact statistical data were available from China and\r\nKorea a similarity full utilization of cultural possibilities would\r\nbe revealed there.\r\n\r\nThis marvelous heritage of economy, industry and thrift, bred of the\r\nstress of centuries, must not be permitted to lose virility through\r\ncontact with western wasteful practices, now exalted to seeming\r\nvirtues through the dazzling brilliancy of mechanical achievements.\r\nMore and more must labor be dignified in all homes alike, and\r\neconomy, industry and thrift become inherited impulses compelling\r\nand satisfying.\r\n\r\nCheap, rapid, long distance transportation, already well started in\r\nthese countries, will bring with it a fuller utilization of the\r\nlarge stores of coal and mineral wealth and of the enormous\r\navailable water power, and as a result there will come some\r\ntemporary lessening of the stress for fuel and with better forest\r\nmanagement some relief along the lines of building materials. But\r\nthe time is not a century distant when, throughout the world, a\r\nfuller, better development must take place along the lines of these\r\nmost far-reaching and fundamental practices so long and so\r\neffectively followed by the Mongolian races in China, Korea and\r\nJapan. When the enormous water-power of these countries has been\r\nharnessed and brought into the foot-hills and down upon the margins\r\nof the valleys and plains in the form of electric current, let it,\r\nif possible, be in a large measure so distributed as to become\r\navailable in the country village homes to lighten the burden and\r\nlessen the human drudgery and yet increase the efficiency of the\r\nhuman effort now so well bestowed upon subsidiary manufactures under\r\nthe guidance and initiative of the home, where there may be room to\r\nbreathe and for children to come up to manhood and womanhood in the\r\nbest conditions possible, rather than in enormous congested\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTRAMPS AFIELD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 31st we took the 8 A. M. train on the Shanghai-Nanking\r\nrailway for Kunshan, situated thirty-two miles west from Shanghai,\r\nto spend the day walking in the fields. The fare, second class, was\r\neighty cents, Mexican. A third class ticket would have been forty\r\ncents and a first class, $1.60, practically two cents, one cent and\r\nhalf a cent, our currency, per mile. The second class fare to\r\nNanking, a distance of 193 miles, was $1.72, U. S. currency, or a\r\nlittle less than one cent per mile. While the car seats were not\r\nupholstered, the service was good. Meals were served on the train in\r\neither foreign or Chinese style, and tea, coffee or hot water to\r\ndrink. Hot, wet face cloths were regularly passed and many Chinese\r\ndaily newspapers were sold on the train, a traveler often buying\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Kunshan a large area of farm land had been\r\nacquired by the French catholic mission at a purchase price of $40,\r\nMexican, per mow, or at the rate of $103.20 per acre. This they\r\nrented to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIt was here that we first saw, at close range, the details of using\r\ncanal mud as a fertilizer, so extensively applied in China. Walking\r\nthrough the fields we came upon the scene in the middle section of\r\nFig. 92 where, close on the right was such a reservoir as seen in\r\nFig. 58. Men were in it, dipping up the mud which had accumulated\r\nover its bottom, pouring it on the bank in a field of windsor beans,\r\nand the thin mud was then over two feet deep at that side and\r\nflowing into the beans where it had already spread two rods, burying\r\nthe plants as the engraving shows. When sufficiently dry to be\r\nreadily handled this would be spread among the beans as we found it\r\nbeing done in another field, shown in the upper section of the\r\nillustration. Here four men were distributing such mud, which had\r\ndried, between the rows, not to fertilize the beans, but for a\r\nsucceeding crop of cotton soon to be planted between the rows,\r\nbefore they were harvested. The owner of this piece of land, with\r\nwhom we talked and who was superintending the work, stated that his\r\nusual yield of these beans was three hundred catty per mow and that\r\nthey sold them green, shelled, at two cents, Mexican, per catty. At\r\nthis price and yield his return would be $15.48, gold, per acre. If\r\nthere was need of nitrogen and organic matter in the soil the vines\r\nwould be pulled green, after picking the beans, and composted with\r\nthe wet mud. If not so needed the dried stems would be tied in\r\nbundles and sold as fuel or used at home, the ashes being returned\r\nto the fields. The windsor beans are thus an early crop grown for\r\nfertilizer, fuel and food.\r\n\r\nThis farmer was paying his laborers one hundred cash per day and\r\nproviding their meals, which he estimated worth two hundred cash\r\nmore, making twelve cents, gold, for a ten-hour day. Judging from\r\nwhat we saw and from the amount of mud carried per load, we\r\nestimated the men would distribute not less than eighty-four loads\r\nof eighty pounds each per day, an average distance of five hundred\r\nfeet, making the cost 3.57 cents, gold, per ton for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe lower section of Fig. 92 shows another instance where mud was\r\nbeing used on a narrow strip bordering the path along which we\r\nwalked, the amount there seen having been brought more than four\r\nhundred feet, by one man before 10 A. M. on the morning the\r\nphotograph was taken. He was getting it from the bottom of a canal\r\nten feet deep, laid bare by the out-going tide. Already he had\r\nbrought more than a ton to his field.\r\n\r\nThe carrying baskets used for this work were in the form of huge\r\ndustpans suspended from the carrying poles by two cords attached to\r\nthe side rims, and steadied by the hand grasping a handle provided\r\nin the back for this purpose and for emptying the baskets by\r\ntipping. With this construction the earth was readily raked upon the\r\nbasket and very easily emptied from it by simply raising the hands\r\nwhen the destination was reached. No arrangement could be more\r\nsimple, expeditious or inexpensive for this man with his small\r\nholding. In this simple manner has nearly all of the earth been\r\nmoved in digging the miles of canal and in building the long sea\r\nwalls. In Shanghai the mud carried through the storm sewers into\r\nSoochow creek we saw being removed in the same manner during the\r\nintervals when the tide was out.\r\n\r\nIn still another field, seen in Fig. 93, the upper portion shows\r\nwhere canal mud had been applied at a rate exceeding seventy tons\r\nper acre, and we were told that such dressings may be repeated as\r\noften as every two years though usually at longer intervals, if\r\nother and cheaper fertilizers could be obtained. In the lower\r\nportion of the same illustration may be seen the section of canal\r\nfrom which this mud was taken up the three earthen stairways built\r\nof the mud itself and permitted to dry before using. Many such lines\r\nof stairway were seen during our trips along the canals, only\r\nrecently made or in the process of building to be in readiness when\r\nthe time for applying the mud should arrive. To facilitate\r\ncollecting the mud from the shallow canals temporary dams may be\r\nthrown across them at two places and the water between either\r\nscooped or pumped out, laying the bottom bare, as is often done also\r\nfor fishing. The earth of the large grave mound seen across a canal\r\nin the center background of the upper portion of the engraving had\r\nbeen collected in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIn the Chekiang province canal mud is extensively used in the\r\nmulberry orchards as a surface dressing. We have referred to this\r\npractice in southern China, and Fig. 94 is a view taken south of\r\nKashing early in April. The boat anchored in front of the mulberry\r\norchard is the home of a family coming from a distance, seeking\r\nemployment during the season for picking mulberry leaves to feed\r\nsilkworms. We were much surprised, on looking back at the boat after\r\nclosing the camera, to see the head of the family standing erect in\r\nthe center, having shoved back a section of the matting roof.\r\n\r\nThe dressing of mud applied to this field formed a loose layer more\r\nthan two inches deep and when compacted by the rains which would\r\nfollow would add not less than a full inch of soil over the entire\r\norchard, and the weight per acre could not be less than 120 tons.\r\n\r\nAnother equally, or even more, laborious practice followed by the\r\nChinese farmers in this province is the periodic exchange of soil\r\nbetween mulberry orchards and the rice fields, their experience\r\nbeing that soil long used in the mulberry orchards improves the\r\nrice, while soil from the rice fields is very helpful when applied\r\nto the mulberry orchards. We saw many instances, when traveling by\r\nboat-train between Shanghai, Kashing and Hangchow, of soil being\r\ncarried from rice fields and either stacked on the banks or dropped\r\ninto the canal. Such soil was oftenest taken from narrow trenches\r\nleading through the fields, laying them off in beds. It is our\r\njudgment that the soil thrown into the canals undergoes important\r\nchanges, perhaps through the absorption of soluble plant food\r\nsubstances such as lime, phosphoric acid and potash withdrawn from\r\nthe water, or through some growth or fermentation, which, in the\r\njudgment of the farmer, makes the large labor involved in this\r\nprocedure worth while. The stacking of soil along the banks was\r\nprobably in preparation for its removal by boat to some of the\r\nmulberry orchards.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly recognized by the farmers that mud collected from\r\nthose sections of the canal leading through country villages, such\r\nas that seen in Fig. 10, is both inherently more fertile and in\r\nbetter physical condition than that collected in the open country.\r\nThey attribute this difference to the effect of the village washing\r\nin the canal, where soap is extensively used. The storm waters of\r\nthe city doubtless carry some fertilizing material also, although\r\nsewage, as such, never finds its way into the canals. The washing\r\nwould be very likely to have a decided flocculating effect and so\r\nrender this material more friable when applied to the field.\r\n\r\nOne very important advantage which comes to the fields when heavily\r\ndressed with such mud is that resulting from the addition of lime\r\nwhich has become incorporated with the silts through their\r\nflocculation and precipitation, and that which is added in the form\r\nof snail shells abounding in the canals. The amount of these may be\r\nrealized from the large numbers contained in the mud recently thrown\r\nout, as seen in the upper section of Fig. 95, where the pebbly\r\nappearance of the surface is caused by snail shells. In the lower\r\nsection of the same illustration the white spots are snail shells\r\nexposed in the soil of a recently spaded field. The shells are by no\r\nmeans as numerous generally as here seen but yet sufficient to\r\nmaintain the supply of lime.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of these snails are collected in quantities and used\r\nas food. Piles containing bushels of the empty shells were seen\r\nalong the canals outside the villages. The snails are cooked in the\r\nshell and often sold by measure to be eaten from the hand, as we buy\r\nroasted peanuts or popcorn. When a purchase is made the vender clips\r\nthe spiral point from each shell with a pair of small shears. This\r\nadmits air and permits the snail to be readily removed by suction\r\nwhen the lips are applied to the shell. In the canals there are also\r\nlarge numbers of fresh water eel, shrimp and crabs as well as fish,\r\nall of which are collected and used for human food. It is common,\r\nwhen walking through the canal country, to come upon groups of\r\ngleaners busy in the bottoms of the shallow agricultural canals,\r\ngathering anything which may serve as food, even including small\r\nbulbs or the fleshy roots of edible aquatic plants. To facilitate\r\nthe collection of such food materials sections of the canal are\r\noften drained in the manner already described, so that gleaning may\r\nbe done by hand, wading in the mud. Families living in houseboats\r\nmake a business of fishing for shrimp. They trail behind the\r\nhouseboat one or two other boats carrying hundreds of shrimp traps\r\ncleverly constructed in such manner that when they are trailed along\r\nthe bottom and disturb the shrimps they dart into the holes in the\r\ntrap, mistaking them for safe hiding places.\r\n\r\nOn the streets, especially during festival days, one may see young\r\npeople and others in social intercourse, busying their fingers and\r\ntheir teeth eating cooked snails or often watermelon seeds, which\r\nare extensively sold and thus eaten. This custom we saw first in the\r\nstreets of a city south of Kashing on the line of the new railway\r\nbetween Hangchow and Shanghai. The first passenger train over the\r\nline had been run the day before our visit, which was a festival day\r\nand throngs of people were visiting the nine-story pagoda standing\r\non a high hill a mile outside the city limits. The day was one of\r\ngreat surprises to these people who had never before seen a\r\npassenger train, and my own person appeared to be a great curiosity\r\nto many. No boy ever scrutinized the face of a caged chimpanzee\r\ncloser, with purer curiosity, or with less consideration for his\r\nfeelings than did a woman of fifty scrutinize mine, standing close\r\nin front, not two feet distant, even bending forward as I sat upon a\r\nbench writing at the railway station. People would pass their hands\r\nalong my coat sleeve to judge the cloth, and a boy felt of my shoes.\r\nWalking through the street we passed many groups gathered about\r\ntables and upon seats, visiting or in business conference, their\r\nfingers occupied with watermelon seeds or with packages of cooked\r\nsnails. Along the pathway leading to the pagoda beggars had\r\ndistributed themselves, one in a place, at intervals of two or three\r\nhundred feet, asking alms, most of them infirm with age or in some\r\nother way physically disabled. We saw but one who appeared capable\r\nof earning a living.\r\n\r\nTravel between Shanghai and Hangchow at this time was heavy. Three\r\ncompanies were running trains, of six or more houseboats, each towed\r\nby a steam launch, and these were daily crowded with passengers. Our\r\ntrain left Shanghai at 4:30 P. M., reaching Hangchow at 5:30 P. M.\r\nthe following day, covering a distance along the canal of something\r\nmore than 117 miles. We paid $5.16, gold, for the exclusive use of a\r\nfirst-cabin, five-berth stateroom for myself and interpreter. It\r\noccupied the full width of the boat, lacking about fourteen inches\r\nof footway, and could be entered from either side down a flight of\r\nfive steps. The berths were flat, naked wooden shelves thirty inches\r\nwide, separated by a partition headboard six inches high and without\r\nrailing in front. Each traveler provided his own bedding. A small\r\ntable upon which meals were served, a mirror on one side and a lamp\r\non the other, set in an opening in the partition, permitting it to\r\nserve two staterooms, completed the furnishings. The roof of the\r\nstaterooms was covered with an awning and divided crosswise into two\r\ntiers of berths, each thirty inches wide, by board partitions six\r\ninches high. In these sections passengers spread their beds,\r\nsleeping heads together, separated only by a headboard six inches\r\nhigh. The awning was only sufficiently high to permit passengers to\r\nsit erect. Ventilation was ample but privacy was nil. Curtains could\r\nbe dropped around the sides in stormy weather.\r\n\r\nMeals were served to each passenger wherever he might be. Dinner\r\nconsisted of hot steamed rice brought in very heavy porcelain bowls\r\nset inside a covered, wet, steaming hot wooden case. With the rice\r\nwere tiny dishes, butterchip size, of green clover, nicely cooked\r\nand seasoned; of cooked bean curd served with shredded bamboo\r\nsprouts; of tiny pork strips with bean curd; of small bits of liver\r\nwith bamboo sprouts; of greens, and hot water for tea. If the\r\nappetite is good one may have a second helping of rice and as much\r\nhot water for tea as desired. There was no table linen, no napkins\r\nand everything but the tea had to be negotiated with chop sticks,\r\nor, these failing, with the fingers. When the meal was finished the\r\ntable was cleared and water, hot if desired, was brought for your\r\nhand basin, which with tea, teacup and bedding, constitute part of\r\nthe traveler's outfit. At frequent intervals, up to ten P. M., a\r\ncrier walked about the deck with hot water for those who might\r\ndesire an extra cup of tea, and again in the early morning.\r\n\r\nAt this season of the year Chinese incubators were being run to\r\ntheir full capacity and it was our good fortune to visit one of\r\nthese, escorted by Rev. R. A. Haden, who also acted as interpreter.\r\nThe art of incubation is very old and very extensively practiced in\r\nChina. An interior view of one of these establishments is shown in\r\nFig. 96, where the family were hatching the eggs of hens, ducks and\r\ngeese, purchasing the eggs and selling the young as hatched. As in\r\nthe case of so many trades in China, this family was the last\r\ngeneration of a long line whose lives had been spent in the same\r\nwork. We entered through their store, opening on the street of the\r\nnarrow village seen in Fig. 10. In the store the eggs were purchased\r\nand the chicks were sold, this work being in charge of the women of\r\nthe family. It was in the extreme rear of the home that thirty\r\nincubators were installed, all doing duty and each having a capacity\r\nof 1,200 hens' eggs. Four of these may be seen in the illustration\r\nand one of the baskets which, when two-thirds filled with eggs, is\r\nset inside of each incubator.\r\n\r\nEach incubator consists of a large earthenware jar having a door cut\r\nin one side through which live charcoal may be introduced and the\r\nfire partly smothered under a layer of ashes, this serving as the\r\nsource of heat. The jar is thoroughly insulated, cased in basketwork\r\nand provided with a cover, as seen in the illustration. Inside the\r\nouter jar rests a second of nearly the same size, as one teacup may\r\nin another. Into this is lowered the large basket with its 600 hens'\r\neggs, 400 ducks' eggs or 175 geese' eggs, as the case may be. Thirty\r\nof these incubators were arranged in two parallel rows of fifteen\r\neach. Immediately above each row, and utilizing the warmth of the\r\nair rising from them, was a continuous line of finishing hatchers\r\nand brooders in the form of woven shallow trays with sides warmly\r\npadded with cotton and with the tops covered with sets of quilts of\r\ndifferent thickness.\r\n\r\nAfter a basket of hens' eggs has been incubated four days it is\r\nremoved and the eggs examined by lighting, to remove those which are\r\ninfertile before they have been rendered unsalable. The infertile\r\neggs go to the store and the basket is returned to the incubator.\r\nDucks' eggs are similarly examined after two days and again after\r\nfive days incubation; and geese' eggs after six days and again after\r\nfourteen days. Through these precautions practically all loss from\r\ninfertile eggs is avoided and from 95 to 98 per cent of the fertile\r\neggs are hatched, the infertile eggs ranging from 5 to 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth day in the incubator all eggs are turned five times\r\nin twenty-four hours. Hens' eggs are kept in the lower incubator\r\neleven days; ducks' eggs thirteen days, and geese' eggs sixteen\r\ndays, after which they are transferred to the trays. Throughout the\r\nincubation period the most careful watch and control is kept over\r\nthe temperature. No thermometer is used but the operator raises the\r\nlid or quilt, removes an egg, pressing the large end into the eye\r\nsocket. In this way a large contact is made where the skin is\r\nsensitive, nearly constant in temperature, but little below blood\r\nheat and from which the air is excluded for the time. Long practice\r\npermits them thus to judge small differences of temperature\r\nexpeditiously and with great accuracy; and they maintain different\r\ntemperatures during different stages of the incubation. The men\r\nsleep in the room and some one is on duty continuously, making the\r\nrounds of the incubators and brooders, examining and regulating each\r\naccording to its individual needs, through the management of the\r\ndoors or the shifting of the quilts over the eggs in the brooder\r\ntrays where the chicks leave the eggs and remain until they go to\r\nthe store. In the finishing trays the eggs form rather more than one\r\ncontinuous layer but the second layer does not cover more than a\r\nfifth or a quarter of the area. Hens' eggs are in these trays ten\r\ndays, ducks' and geese' eggs, fourteen days.\r\n\r\nAfter the chickens have been hatched sufficiently long to require\r\nfeeding they are ready for market and are then sorted according to\r\nsex and placed in separate shallow woven trays thirty inches in\r\ndiameter. The sorting is done rapidly and accurately through the\r\nsense of touch, the operator recognizing the sex by gently pinching\r\nthe anus. Four trays of young chickens were in the store fronting on\r\nthe street as we entered and several women were making purchases,\r\ntaking five to a dozen each. Dr. Haden informed me that nearly every\r\nfamily in the cities, and in the country villages raise a few, but\r\nonly a few, chickens and it is a common sight to see grown chickens\r\nwalking about the narrow streets, in and out of the open stores,\r\ndodging the feet of the occupants and passers-by. At the time of our\r\nvisit this family was paying at the rate of ten cents, Mexican, for\r\nnine hens' and eight ducks' eggs, and were selling their largest\r\nstrong chickens at three cents each. These figures, translated into\r\nour currency, make the purchase price for eggs nearly 48 cents, and\r\nthe selling price for the young chicks $1.29, per hundred, or\r\nthirteen eggs for six cents and seven chickens for nine cents.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult even to conceive, not to say measure, the vast\r\nimport of this solution of how to maintain, in the millions of\r\nhomes, a constantly accessible supply of absolutely fresh and\r\nthoroughly sanitary animal food in the form of meat and eggs. The\r\ngreat density of population in these countries makes the problem of\r\nsupplying eggs to the people very different from that in the United\r\nStates. Our 250,600,000 fowl in 1900 was at the rate of three to\r\neach person but in Japan, with her 16,500,000 fowl, she had in 1906\r\nbut one for every three people. Her number per square mile of\r\ncultivated land however was 825, while in the United States, in\r\n1900, the number of fowls per square mile of improved farm land was\r\nbut 387. To give to Japan three fowls to each person there would\r\nneeds be an average of about nine to each acre of her cultivated\r\nland, whereas in the United States there were in 1900 nearly two\r\nacres of improved farm land for each fowl. We have no statistics\r\nregarding the number of fowl in China or the number of eggs produced\r\nbut the total is very large and she exports to Japan. The large boat\r\nload of eggs seen in Fig. 97 had just arrived from the country,\r\ncoming into Shanghai in one of her canals.\r\n\r\nBesides applying canal mud directly to the fields in the ways\r\ndescribed there are other very extensive practices of composting it\r\nwith organic matter of one or another kind and of then using the\r\ncompost on the fields. The next three illustrations show some of the\r\nsteps and something of the tremendous labor of body, willingly and\r\ncheerfully incurred, and something of the forethought practiced,\r\nthat homes may be maintained and that grandparents, parents, wives\r\nand children need neither starve nor beg. We had reached a place\r\nseen in Fig. 98, where eight bearers were moving winter compost to a\r\nrecently excavated pit in an adjoining field shown in Fig. 99.\r\n\r\nFour months before the camera fixed the activity shown, men had\r\nbrought waste from the stables of Shanghai fifteen miles by water,\r\ndepositing it upon the canal bank between layers of thin mud dipped\r\nfrom the canal, and left it to ferment. The eight men were removing\r\nthis compost to the pit seen in Fig. 99, then nearly filled. Near by\r\nin the same field was a second pit seen in Fig. 100, excavated three\r\nfeet deep and rimmed about with the earth removed, making it two\r\nfeet deeper.\r\n\r\nAfter these pits had been filled the clover which was in blossom\r\nbeyond the pits would be cut and stacked upon them to a height of\r\nfive to eight feet and this also saturated, layer by layer, with mud\r\nbrought from the canal, and allowed to ferment twenty to thirty days\r\nuntil the juices set free had been absorbed by the winter compost\r\nbeneath, helping to carry the ripening of that still further, and\r\nuntil the time had arrived for fitting the ground for the next crop.\r\nThis organic matter, fermented with the canal mud, would then be\r\ndistributed by the men over the field, carried a third time on their\r\nshoulders, notwithstanding its weight was many tons.\r\n\r\nThis manure had been collected, loaded and carried fifteen miles by\r\nwater; it had been unloaded upon the bank and saturated with canal\r\nmud; the field had been fitted for clover the previous fall and\r\nseeded; the pits had been dug in the fields; the winter compost had\r\nbeen carried and placed in the pits; the clover was to be cut,\r\ncarried by the men on their shoulders, stacked layer by layer and\r\nsaturated with mud dipped from the canal; the whole would later be\r\ndistributed over the field and finally the earth removed from the\r\npits would be returned to them, that the service of no ground upon\r\nwhich a crop might grow should be lost.\r\n\r\nSuch are the tasks to which Chinese farmers hold themselves, because\r\nthey are convinced desired results will follow, because their\r\nholdings are so small and their families so large. These practices\r\nare so extensive in China and so fundamental in the part they play\r\nin the maintenance of high productive power in their soils that we\r\nmade special effort to follow them through different phases. In Fig.\r\n101 we saw the preparation being made to build one of the clover\r\ncompost stacks saturated with canal mud. On the left the thin mud\r\nhad been dipped from the canal; way-farers in the center were\r\ncrossing the foot-bridge of the country by-way; and beyond rises the\r\nconical thatch to shelter the water buffalo when pumping for\r\nirrigating the rice crop to be fed with this plant food in\r\npreparation. On the right were two large piles of green clover\r\nfreshly cut and a woman of the family at one of them was spreading\r\nit to receive the mud, while the men-folk were coming from the field\r\nwith more clover on their carrying poles. We came upon this scene\r\njust before the dinner hour and after the workers had left another\r\nphotograph was taken at closer range and from a different side,\r\ngiving the view seen in Fig. 102. The mud had been removed some days\r\nand become too stiff to spread, so water was being brought from the\r\ncanal in the pails at the right for reducing its consistency to that\r\nof a thin porridge, permitting it to more completely smear and\r\nsaturate the clover. The stack grew, layer by layer, each saturated\r\nwith the mud, tramped solid with the bare feet, trousers rolled\r\nhigh. Provision had been made here for building four other stacks.\r\n\r\nFurther along we came upon the scene in Fig. 103 where the building\r\nof the stack of compost and the gathering of the mud from the canal\r\nwere simultaneous. On one side of the canal the son, using a\r\nclam-shell form of dipper made of basket-work, which could be opened\r\nand shut with a pair of bamboo handles, had nearly filled the middle\r\nsection of his boat with the thin ooze, while on the other side,\r\nagainst the stack which was building, the mother was emptying a\r\nsimilar boat, using a large dipper, also provided with a bamboo\r\nhandle. The man on the stack is a good scale for judging its size.\r\n\r\nWe came next upon a finished stack on the bank of another canal,\r\nshown in Fig. 104, where our umbrella was set to serve as a scale.\r\nThis stack measured ten by ten feet on the ground, was six feet high\r\nand must have contained more than twenty tons of the green compost.\r\nAt the same place, two other stacks had been started, each about\r\nfourteen by fourteen feet, and foundations were laid for six others,\r\nnine in all.\r\n\r\nDuring twenty or more days this green nitrogenous organic matter is\r\npermitted to lie fermenting in contact with the fine soil particles\r\nof the ooze with which it had been charged. This is a remarkable\r\npractice in that it is a very old, intensive application of an\r\nimportant fundamental principle only recently understood and added\r\nto the science of agriculture, namely, the power of organic matter,\r\ndecaying rapidly in contact with soil, to liberate from it soluble\r\nplant food; and so it would be a great mistake to say that these\r\nlaborious practices are the result of ignorance, of a lack of\r\ncapacity for accurate thinking or of power to grasp and utilize. If\r\nthe agricultural lands of the United States are ever called upon to\r\nfeed even 1200 millions of people, a number proportionately less\r\nthan one-half that being fed in Japan today, very different\r\npractices from those we are now following will have been adopted. We\r\ncan believe they will require less human bodily effort and be more\r\nefficient. But the knowledge which can make them so is not yet in\r\nthe possession of our farmers, much less the conviction that plant\r\nfeeding and more persistent and better directed soil management are\r\nnecessary to such yields as will then be required.\r\n\r\nLater, just before the time for transplanting rice, we returned to\r\nthe same district to observe the manner of applying this compost to\r\nthe field, and Fig. 105 is prepared from photographs taken then,\r\nillustrating the activities of one family, as seen during the\r\nmorning of May 28th. Their home was in a near-by village and their\r\nholding was divided into four nearly rectangular paddies, graded to\r\nwater level, separated by raised rims, and having an area of nearly\r\ntwo acres. Three of these little fields are partly shown in the\r\nillustration, and the fourth in Fig. 160. In the background of the\r\nupper section of Fig. 105, and under the thatched shelter, was a\r\nnative Chinese cow, blindfolded and hitched to the power-wheel of a\r\nlarge wooden-chain pump, lifting water from the canal and flooding\r\nthe field in the foreground, to soften the soil for plowing. Riding\r\non the power-wheel was a girl of some twelve years, another of seven\r\nand a baby. They were there for entertainment and to see that the\r\ncow kept at work. The ground had been sufficiently softened so that\r\nthe father had begun plowing, the cow sinking to her knees as she\r\nwalked. In the same paddy, but shown in the section below, a boy was\r\nspreading the clover compost with his hands, taking care that it was\r\nfinely divided and evenly scattered. He had been once around before\r\nthe plowing began. This compost had been brought from a stack by the\r\nside of a canal, and two other men were busy still bringing the\r\nmaterial to one of the other paddies, one of whom, with his baskets\r\non the carrying pole appears in the third section. Between these two\r\npaddies was the one seen at the bottom of the illustration, which\r\nhad matured a crop of rape that had been pulled and was lying in\r\nswaths ready to be moved. Two other men were busy here, gathering\r\nthe rape into large bundles and carrying it to the village home,\r\nwhere the women were threshing out the seed, taking care not to\r\nbreak the stems which, after threshing, were tied into bundles for\r\nfuel. The seed would be ground and from it an oil expressed, while\r\nthe cake would be used as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThis crop of rape is remarkable for the way it fits into the\r\neconomies of these people. It is a near relative of mustard and\r\ncabbage; it grows rapidly during the cooler portions of the season,\r\nthe spring crop ripening before the planting of rice and cotton; its\r\nyoung shoots and leaves are succulent, nutritious, readily digested\r\nand extensively used as human food, boiled and eaten fresh, or\r\nsalted for winter use, to be served with rice; the mature stems,\r\nbeing woody, make good fuel; and it bears a heavy crop of seed, rich\r\nin oil, which has been extensively used for lights and in cooking,\r\nwhile the rape seed cake is highly prized as a manure and very\r\nextensively so used.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring the country is luxuriantly green with the large\r\nacreage of rape, later changing to a sea of most brilliant yellow\r\nand finally to an ashy grey when the leaves fall and the stems and\r\npods ripen. Like the dairy cow, rape produces a fat, in the ratio of\r\nabout forty pounds of oil to a hundred pounds of seed, which may be\r\neaten, burned or sold without materially robbing the soil of its\r\nfertility if the cake and the ashes from the stems are returned to\r\nthe fields, the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen of which the oil is\r\nalmost wholly composed coming from the atmosphere rather than from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nIn Japan rape is grown as a second crop on both the upland and paddy\r\nfields, and in 1906 she produced more than 5,547,000 bushels of the\r\nseed; $1,845,000 worth of rape seed cake, importing enough more to\r\nequal a total value of $2,575,000, all of which was used as a\r\nfertilizer, the oil being exported. The yield of seed per acre in\r\nJapan ranges between thirteen and sixteen bushels, and the farmer\r\nwhose field was photographed estimated that his returns from the\r\ncrop would be at the rate of 640 pounds of seed per acre, worth\r\n$6.19, and 8,000 pounds of stems worth as fuel $5.16 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE UTILIZATION OF WASTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable agricultural practices adopted by any\r\ncivilized people is the centuries-long and well nigh universal\r\nconservation and utilization of all human waste in China, Korea and\r\nJapan, turning it to marvelous account in the maintenance of soil\r\nfertility and in the production of food. To understand this\r\nevolution it must be recognized that mineral fertilizers so\r\nextensively employed in modern western agriculture, like the\r\nextensive use of mineral coal, had been a physical impossibility to\r\nall people alike until within very recent years. With this fact must\r\nbe associated the very long unbroken life of these nations and the\r\nvast numbers their farmers have been compelled to feed.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect upon the depleted fertility of our own older farm\r\nlands, comparatively few of which have seen a century's service, and\r\nupon the enormous quantity of mineral fertilizers which are being\r\napplied annually to them in order to secure paying yields, it\r\nbecomes evident that the time is here when profound consideration\r\nshould be given to the practices the Mongolian race has maintained\r\nthrough many centuries, which permit it to be said of China that\r\none-sixth of an acre of good land is ample for the maintenance of\r\none person, and which are feeding an average of three people per\r\nacre of farm land in the three southernmost of the four main islands\r\nof Japan.\r\n\r\nFrom the analyses of mixed human excreta made by Wolff in Europe and\r\nby Kellner in Japan it appears that, as an average, these carry in\r\nevery 2000 pounds 12.7 pounds of nitrogen, 4 pounds of potassium and\r\n1.7 pounds of phosphorus. On this basis and that of Carpenter, who\r\nestimates the average amount of excreta per day for the adult at 40\r\nounces, the average annual production per million of adult\r\npopulation is 5,794,300 pounds of nitrogen; 1,825,000 pounds of\r\npotassium, and 775,600 pounds of phosphorus carried in 456,250 tons\r\nof excreta. The figures which Hall cites in Fertilizers and Manures,\r\nwould make these amounts 7,940,000 pounds of nitrogen; 3,070,500\r\npounds of potassium, and 1,965,600 pounds of phosphorus, but the\r\nfigures he takes and calls high averages give 12,000,000 of\r\nnitrogen; 4,151,000 pounds of potassium, and 3,057,600 pounds of\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the International Concessions of the city of Shanghai sold\r\nto one Chinese contractor for $31,000, gold, the privilege of\r\ncollecting 78,000 tons of human waste, under stipulated regulations,\r\nand of removing it to the country for sale to farmers. The flotilla\r\nof boats seen in Fig. 106 is one of several engaged daily in\r\nShanghai throughout the year in this service.\r\n\r\nDr. Kawaguchi, of the National Department of Agriculture and\r\nCommerce, taking his data from their records, informed us that the\r\nhuman manure saved and applied to the fields of Japan in 1908\r\namounted to 23,850,295 tons, which is an average of 1.75 tons per\r\nacre of their 21,321 square miles of cultivated land in their four\r\nmain islands.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the data of Wolff, Kellner and Carpenter, or of\r\nHall, the people of the United States and of Europe are pouring into\r\nthe sea, lakes or rivers and into the underground waters from\r\n5,794,300 to 12,000,000 pounds of nitrogen; 1,881,900 to 4,151,000\r\npounds of potassium, and 777,200 to 3,057,600 pounds of phosphorus\r\nper million of adult population annually, and this waste we esteem\r\none of the great achievements of our civilization. In the Far East,\r\nfor more than thirty centuries, these enormous wastes have been\r\nreligiously saved and today the four hundred million of adult\r\npopulation send back to their fields annually 150,000 tons of\r\nphosphorus; 376,000 tons of potassium, and 1,158,000 tons of\r\nnitrogen comprised in a gross weight exceeding 182 million tons,\r\ngathered from every home, from the country villages and from the\r\ngreat cities like Hankow-Wuchang-Hanyang with its 1,770,000 people\r\nswarming on a land area delimited by a radius of four miles.\r\n\r\nMan is the most extravagant accelerator of waste the world has ever\r\nendured. His withering blight has fallen upon every living thing\r\nwithin his reach, himself not excepted; and his besom of destruction\r\nin the uncontrolled hands of a generation has swept into the sea\r\nsoil fertility which only centuries of life could accumulate, and\r\nyet this fertility is the substratum of all that is living. It must\r\nbe recognized that the phosphate deposits which we are beginning to\r\nreturn to our fields are but measures of fertility lost from older\r\nsoils, and indices of processes still in progress. The rivers of\r\nNorth America are estimated to carry to the sea more than 500 tons\r\nof phosphorus with each cubic mile of water. To such loss modern\r\ncivilization is adding that of hydraulic sewage disposal through\r\nwhich the waste of five hundred millions of people might be more\r\nthan 194,300 tons of phosphorus annually, which could not be\r\nreplaced by 1,295,000 tons of rock phosphate, 75 per cent pure. The\r\nMongolian races, with a population now approaching the figure named;\r\noccupying an area little more than one-half that of the United\r\nStates, tilling less than 800,000 square miles of land, and much of\r\nthis during twenty, thirty or perhaps forty centuries; unable to\r\navail themselves of mineral fertilizers, could not survive and\r\ntolerate such waste. Compelled to solve the problem of avoiding such\r\nwastes, and exercising the faculty which is characteristic of the\r\nrace, they \"cast down their buckets where they were\", as\r\n\r\n*A ship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly\r\nvessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal,\r\n\"Water, water; we die of thirst!\" The answer from the friendly\r\nvessel at once came back, \"Cast down your bucket where you are.\" A\r\nsecond time the signal, \"Water, water; Send us water!\" ran up from\r\nthe distressed vessel, and was answered, \"Cast down your bucket\r\nwhere you are.\" And a third and fourth signal for water was\r\nanswered, \"Cast down your bucket where you are.\" The captain of the\r\ndistressed vessel, at last heeding the injunction, cast down his\r\nbucket, and it came up full of fresh sparkling water from the mouth\r\nof the Amazon river. *Booker T. Washington, Atlanta address.\r\n\r\nNot even in great cities like Canton, built in the meshes of\r\ntideswept rivers and canals; like Hankow on the banks of one of the\r\nlargest rivers in the world; nor yet in modern Shanghai, Yokohama or\r\nTokyo, is such waste permitted. To them such a practice has meant\r\nrace suicide and they have resisted the temptation so long that it\r\nhas ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur Stanley, Health officer of the city of Shanghai, in his\r\nannual report for 1899, considering this subject as a municipal\r\nproblem, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the bearing on the sanitation of Shanghai of the\r\nrelationship between Eastern and Western hygiene, it may be said,\r\nthat if prolonged national life is indicative of sound sanitation,\r\nthe Chinese are a race worthy of study by all who concern themselves\r\nwith Public Health. Even without the returns of a Registrar-General\r\nit is evident that in China the birth rate must very considerably\r\nexceed the death rate, and have done so in an average way during the\r\nthree or four thousand years that the Chinese nation has existed.\r\nChinese hygiene, when compared with medieval English, appears to\r\nadvantage. The main problem of sanitation is to cleanse the dwelling\r\nday by day, and if this can be done at a profit so much the better.\r\nWhile the ultra-civilized Western elaborates destructors for burning\r\ngarbage at a financial loss and turns sewage into the sea, the\r\nChinaman uses both for manure. He wastes nothing while the sacred\r\nduty of agriculture is uppermost in his mind. And in reality recent\r\nbacterial work has shown that faecal matter and house refuse are\r\nbest destroyed by returning them to clean soil, where natural\r\npurification takes place. The question of destroying garbage can, I\r\nthink, under present conditions in Shanghai, be answered in a\r\ndecided negative. While to adopt the water-carriage system for\r\nsewage and turn it into the river, whence the water supply is\r\nderived, would be an act of sanitary suicide. It is best, therefore,\r\nto make use of what is good in Chinese hygiene, which demands\r\nrespect, being, as it is, the product of an evolution extending from\r\nmore than a thousand years before the Christian era.\"\r\n\r\nThe storage of such waste in China is largely in stoneware\r\nreceptacles such as are seen in Fig. 109, which are hard-burned,\r\nglazed terra-cotta urns, having capacities ranging from 500 to 1000\r\npounds. Japan more often uses sheltered cement-lined pits such as\r\nare seen in Fig. 110.\r\n\r\nIn the three countries the carrying to the fields is oftenest in\r\nsome form of pail, as seen in Fig. 111, a pair of which are borne\r\nswinging from the carrying pole. In applying the liquid to the field\r\nor garden the long handle dipper is used, seen in Fig. 112.\r\n\r\nWe are beginning to husband with some economy the waste from our\r\ndomestic animals but in this we do not approach that of China, Korea\r\nand Japan. People in China regularly search for and collect\r\ndroppings along the country and caravan roads. Repeatedly, when\r\nwalking through city streets, we observed such materials quickly and\r\napparently eagerly gathered, to be carefully stored under conditions\r\nwhich ensure small loss from either leaching or unfavorable\r\nfermentation. In some mulberry orchards visited the earth had been\r\ncarefully hoed back about the trunks of trees to a depth of three or\r\nfour inches from a circle having a diameter of six to eight feet,\r\nand upon these areas were placed the droppings of silkworms, the\r\nmoulted skins, together with the bits of leaves and stem left after\r\nfeeding. Some disposition of such waste must be made. They return at\r\nonce to the orchard all but the silk produced from the leaves;\r\nunnecessary loss is thus avoided and the material enters at once the\r\nservice of forcing the next crop of leaves.\r\n\r\nOn the farm of Mrs. Wu, near Kashing, while studying the operation\r\nof two irrigation pumps driven by two cows, lifting water to flood\r\nher twenty-five acres of rice field preparatory to transplanting, we\r\nwere surprised to observe that one of the duties of the lad who had\r\ncharge of the animals was to use a six-quart wooden dipper with a\r\nbamboo handle six feet long to collect all excreta, before they fell\r\nupon the ground, and transfer them to a receptacle provided for the\r\npurpose. There came a flash of resentment that such a task was set\r\nfor the lad, for we were only beginning to realize to what lengths\r\nthe practice of economy may go, but there was nothing irksome\r\nsuggested in the boy's face. He performed the duty as a matter of\r\ncourse and as we thought it through there was no reason why it\r\nshould have been otherwise. In fact, the only right course was being\r\ntaken. Conditions would have been worse if the collection had not\r\nbeen made. It made possible more rice. Character of substantial\r\nquality was building in the lad which meant thrift in the growing\r\nman and continued life for the nation.\r\n\r\nWe have adverted to the very small number of flies observed anywhere\r\nin the course of our travel, but its significance we did not realize\r\nuntil near the end of our stay. Indeed, for some reason, flies were\r\nmore in evidence during the first two days on the steamship, out\r\nfrom Yokohama on our return trip to America, than at any time before\r\non our journey. It is to be expected that the eternal vigilance\r\nwhich seizes every waste, once it has become such, putting it in\r\nplaces of usefulness, must contribute much toward the destruction of\r\nbreeding places, and it may be these nations have been mindful of\r\nthe wholesomeness of their practice and that many phases of the\r\nevolution of their waste disposal system have been dictated by and\r\nheld fast to through a clear conception of sanitary needs.\r\n\r\nMuch intelligence and the highest skill are exhibited by these\r\nold-world farmers in the use of their wastes. In Fig. 113 is one of\r\nmany examples which might be cited. The man walking down the row\r\nwith his manure pails swinging from his shoulders informed us on his\r\nreturn that in his household there were twenty to be fed; that from\r\nthis garden of half an acre of land he usually sold a product\r\nbringing in $400, Mexican,--$172, gold. The crop was cucumbers in\r\ngroups of two rows thirty inches apart and twenty-four inches\r\nbetween the groups. The plants were eight to ten inches apart in the\r\nrow. He had just marketed the last of a crop of greens which\r\noccupied the space between the rows of cucumbers seen under the\r\nstrong, durable, light and very readily removable trellises. On May\r\n28 the vines were beginning to run, so not a minute had been lost in\r\nthe change of crop. On the contrary this man had added a month to\r\nhis growing season by over-lapping his crops, and the trellises\r\nenabled him to feed more plants of this type than there was room for\r\nvines on the ground. With ingenuity and much labor he had made his\r\nhalf acre for cucumbers equivalent to more than two. He had removed\r\nthe vines entirely from the ground; had provided a travel space two\r\nfeet wide, down which he was walking, and he had made it possible to\r\nwork about the roots of every plant for the purpose of hoeing and\r\nfeeding. Four acres of cucumbers handled by American field methods\r\nwould not yield more than this man's one, and he grows besides two\r\nother crops the same season.\r\n\r\nThe difference is not so much in activity of muscle as it is in\r\nalertness and efficiency of the grey matter of the brain. He sees\r\nand treats each plant individually, he loosens the ground so that\r\nhis liquid manure drops immediately beneath the surface within reach\r\nof the active roots. If the rainfall has been scanty and the soil is\r\ndry he may use ten of water to two of night soil, not to supply\r\nwater but to make certain sufficiently deep penetration. If the\r\nweather is rainy and the soil over wet, the food is applied more\r\nconcentrated, not to lighten the burden but to avoid waste by\r\nleaching and over saturation. While ever crowding growth he never\r\noverfeeds. Forethought, after-thought and the mind focused on the\r\nwork in hand are characteristic of these people. We do not recall to\r\nhave seen a man smoking while at work. They enjoy smoking, but\r\nprefer to do this also with the attention undivided and thus get\r\nmore for their money.\r\n\r\nOn another date earlier in May we were walking in the fields without\r\nan interpreter. For half an hour we stood watching an old gardener\r\nfitting the soil with his spading hoe in the manner seen in Fig. 26,\r\nwhere the graves of his ancestors occupy a part of the land.\r\nAngleworms were extremely numerous, as large around as an ordinary\r\nlead pencil and, when not extended, two-thirds as long, decidedly\r\ngreenish in color. Nearly every stroke of the spade exposed two to\r\nfive of these worms but so far as we observed, and we watched the\r\nman closely, pulverizing the soil, he neither injured nor left\r\nuncovered a single worm. While he seemed to make no effort to avoid\r\ninjuring them or to cover them with earth, and while we could not\r\ntalk with him, we are convinced that his action was continually\r\nguarded against injuring the worms.\r\n\r\nThey certainly were subsoiling his garden deeply and making possible\r\na freer circulation of air far below the surface. Their great\r\nabundance proved a high content of organic matter present in the\r\nsoil and, as the worms ate their way through it, passing the soil\r\nthrough their bodies, the yearly volume of work done by them was\r\nvery great. In the fields flooded preparatory to fitting them for\r\nrice these worms are forced to the surface in enormous numbers and\r\nlarge flocks of ducks are taken to such fields to feed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn another field a crop of barley was nearing maturity. An adjacent\r\nstrip of land was to be fitted and planted. The leaning barley heads\r\nwere in the way. Not one must be lost and every inch of ground must\r\nbe put to use. The grain along the margin, for a breadth of sixteen\r\ninches, had been gathered into handfuls and skillfully tied, each\r\nwith an unpulled barley stem, without breaking the straw, thus\r\npermitting even the grains in that head to fill and be gathered with\r\nthe rest, while the tying set all straws well aslant, out of the\r\nway, and permitted the last inch of naked ground to be fitted\r\nwithout injuring the grain.\r\n\r\nIn still another instance a man was growing Irish potatoes to market\r\nwhen yet small. He had enriched his soil; he would apply water if\r\nthe rains were not timely and sufficient, and had fed the plants. He\r\nhad planted in rows only twelve to fourteen inches apart with a hill\r\nevery eight inches in the row. The vines stood strong, straight,\r\nfourteen inches high and as even as a trimmed hedge. The leaves and\r\nstems were turgid, the deepest green and as prime and glossy as a\r\nprize steer. So close were the plants that there was leaf surface to\r\nintercept the sunshine falling on every square inch of the patch.\r\nThere were no potato beetles and we saw no signs of injury but the\r\ngardener was scanning the patch with the eye of a robin. He spied\r\nthe slightest first drooping of leaves in a stem; went after the\r\ndifficulty and brought and placed in our hand a cutworm, a young\r\ntuber the size of a marble and a stem cut half off, which he was\r\nwilling to sacrifice because of our evident interest. But the two\r\nfriends who had met were held apart by the babel of tongues.\r\n\r\nNothing is costing the world more; has made so many enemies, and has\r\nso much hindered the forming of friendships as the inability to\r\nfully understand; hence the dove that brings world peace must fly on\r\nthe wings of a common language, and the bright star in the east is\r\nworld commerce, rising on rapidly developing railway and steamship\r\nlines, heralded and directed by electric communication. With world\r\ncommerce must come mutual confidence and friendship requiring a full\r\nunderstanding and therefore a common tongue. Then world peace will\r\nbe permanently assured. It is coming inevitably and faster than we\r\nthink. Once this desired end is seriously sought, the carrying of\r\nthree generations of children through the public schools where the\r\nworld language is taught together with the mother tongue, and the\r\npassing of the parents and grandparents, would effect the change.\r\n\r\nThe important point regarding these Far East people, to which\r\nattention should be directed, is that effective thinking, clear and\r\nstrong, prevails among the farmers who have fed and are still\r\nfeeding the dense populations from the products of their limited\r\nareas. This is further indicated in the universal and extensive use\r\nof plant ashes derived from fuel grown upon cultivated fields and\r\nupon the adjacent hill and mountain lands.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to secure exact data regarding the amount of fuel\r\nburned annually in these countries, and of ashes used as fertilizer,\r\nbut a cord of dry oak wood weighs about 3500 pounds, and the weight\r\nof fuel used in the home and in manufactures must exceed that of two\r\ncords per household. Japan has an average of 5.563 people per\r\nfamily. If we allow but 1300 pounds of fuel per capita, Japan's\r\nconsumption would be 31,200,000 tons. In view of the fact that a\r\nvery large share of the fuel used in these countries is either\r\nagricultural plant stems, with an average ash content of 5 per cent,\r\nor the twigs and even leaves of trees, as in the case of pine bough\r\nfuel, 4.5 per cent of ash may be taken as a fair estimate. On this\r\nbasis, and with a content of phosphorus equal to .5 per cent, and of\r\npotassium equal to 5 per cent, the fuel ash for Japan would amount\r\nto 1,404,000 tons annually, carrying 7020 tons of phosphorus and\r\n70,200 tons of potassium, together with more than 400,000 tons of\r\nlimestone, which is returned annually to less than 21,321 square\r\nmiles of cultivated land.\r\n\r\nIn China, with her more than four hundred millions of people, a\r\nsimilar rate of fuel consumption would make the phosphorus and\r\npotassium returned to her fields more than eight times the amounts\r\ncomputed for Japan. On the basis of these statements Japan's annual\r\nsaving of phosphorus from the waste of her fuel would be equivalent\r\nto more than 46,800 tons of rock phosphate having a purity of 75 per\r\ncent, or in the neighborhood of seven pounds per acre. If this\r\namount, even with the potash and limestone added, appears like a\r\ntrifling addition of fertility it is important for Americans to\r\nremember that even if this is so, these people have felt compelled\r\nto make the saving.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of returning soluble potassium to the cultivated\r\nfields Japan would be applying with her ashes the equivalent of no\r\nless than 156,600 tons of pure potassium sulphate, equal to 23\r\npounds per acre; while the lime carbonate so applied annually would\r\nbe some 62 pounds per acre.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the forest lands, which have long been made to\r\ncontribute plant food to the cultivated fields through fuel ashes,\r\nthere are large areas which contribute green manure and compost\r\nmaterial. These are chiefly hill lands, aggregating some twenty per\r\ncent of the cultivated fields, which bear mostly herbaceous growth.\r\nSome 2,552,741 acres of these lands may be cut over three times each\r\nseason, yielding, in 1903, an average of 7980 pounds per acre. The\r\nfirst cutting of this hill herbage is mainly used on the rice fields\r\nas green manure, it being tramped into the mud between the rows\r\nafter the manner seen in Fig. 114.\r\n\r\nThis man had been with basket and sickle to gather green herbage\r\nwherever he could and had brought it to his rice paddy. The day in\r\nJuly was extremely sultry. We came upon him wading in the water half\r\nway to his knees, carefully laying the herbage he had gathered\r\nbetween alternate rows of his rice, one handful in a place, with\r\ntips overlapping. This done he took the attitude seen in the\r\nillustration and, gathering the materials into a compact bunch,\r\npressed it beneath the surface with his foot. The two hands smoothed\r\nthe soft mud over the grass and righted the disturbed spears of rice\r\nin the two adjacent hills. Thus, foot following foot, one bare\r\nlength ahead, the succeeding bunches of herbage were submerged until\r\nthe last had been reached, following between alternate rows only a\r\nfoot apart, there being a hill every nine to ten inches in the row\r\nand the hands grasping and being drawn over every one in the paddy.\r\n\r\nHe was renting the land, paying therefor forty kan of rice per tan,\r\nand his usual yield was eighty kan. This is forty-four bushels of\r\nsixty pounds per acre. In unfavorable seasons his yield might be\r\nless but still his rent would be forty kan per tan unless it was\r\nclear that he had done all that could reasonably be expected of him\r\nin securing the crop. It is difficult for Americans to understand\r\nhow it is possible for the will of man, even when spurred by the\r\nlove of home and family, to hold flesh to tasks like these.\r\n\r\nThe second and third cuttings of herbage from the genya lands in\r\nJapan are used for the preparation of compost applied on the\r\ndry-land fields in the fall or in the spring of the following\r\nseason. Some of these lands are pastured, but approximately\r\n10,185,500 tons of green herbage grown and gathered from the hills\r\ncontributes much of its organic matter and all of its ash to enrich\r\nthe cultivated fields. Such wild growth areas in Japan are the\r\ncommons of the near by villages, to which the people are freely\r\nadmitted for the purpose of cutting the herbage. A fixed time may be\r\nset for cutting and a limit placed upon the amount which may be\r\ncarried away, which is done in the manner seen in Fig. 115. It is\r\nwell recognized by the people that this constant cutting and removal\r\nof growth from the hill lands, with no return, depletes the soils\r\nand reduces the amount of green herbage they are able to secure.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Dr. Daikuhara of the Imperial Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station at Tokyo we are able to give the average\r\ncomposition of the green leaves and young stems of five of the most\r\ncommon wild species of plants cut for green manure in June. In each\r\n1000 pounds the amount of water is 562.18 pounds; of organic matter,\r\n382.68 pounds; of ash, 55.14 pounds; nitrogen, 4.78 pounds;\r\npotassium, 2.407 pounds, and phosphorus, .34 pound. On the basis of\r\nthis composition and an aggregate yield of 10,185,500 tons, there\r\nwould be annually applied to the cultivated fields 3463 tons of\r\nphosphorus and 24,516 tons of potassium derived from the genya\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the run-off from both the mountain and the genya\r\nlands is largely used upon the rice fields, more than sixteen inches\r\nof water being applied annually to them in some prefectures. If such\r\nwaters have the composition of river waters in North America, twelve\r\ninches of water applied to the rice fields of the three main islands\r\nwould contribute no less than 1200 tons of phosphorus and 19,000\r\ntons of potassium annually.\r\n\r\nDr. Kawaguchi, of the National Department of Agriculture and\r\nCommerce, informed us that in 1908 Japanese farmers prepared and\r\napplied to their fields 22,812,787 tons of compost manufactured from\r\nthe wastes of cattle, horses, swine and poultry, combined with\r\nherbage, straw and other similar wastes and with soil, sod or mud\r\nfrom ditches and canals. The amount of this compost is sufficient to\r\napply 1.78 tons per acre of cultivated land of the southern three\r\nmain islands.\r\n\r\nFrom data obtained at the Nara Experiment Station, the composition\r\nof compost as there prepared shows it to contain, in each 2000\r\npounds, 550 pounds of organic matter; 15.6 pounds of nitrogen; 8.3\r\npounds of potassium, and 5.24 pounds of phosphorus. On this basis\r\n22,800,000 tons of compost will carry 59,700 tons of phosphorus and\r\n94,600 tons of potassium. The construction of compost houses is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 116, reproduced from a large circular sent to\r\nfarmers from the Nara Experiment Station, and an exterior of one at\r\nthe Nara Station is given in Fig. 117.\r\n\r\nThis compost house is designed to serve two and a half acres. Its\r\nfloor is twelve by eighteen feet, rendered watertight by a mixture\r\nof clay, lime and sand. The walls are of earth, one foot thick, and\r\nthe roof is thatched with straw. Its capacity is sixteen to twenty\r\ntons, having a cash value of 60 yen, or $30. In preparing the stack,\r\nmaterials are brought daily and, spread over one side of the compost\r\nfloor until the pile has attained a height of five feet. After one\r\nfoot in depth has been laid and firmed, 1.2 inches of soil or mud is\r\nspread over the surface and the process repeated until full height\r\nhas been attained. Water is added sufficient to keep the whole\r\nsaturated and to maintain the temperature below that of the body.\r\nAfter the compost stacks have been completed they are permitted to\r\nstand five weeks in summer, seven weeks in winter, when they are\r\nforked over and transferred to the opposite side of the house.\r\n\r\nIf we state in round numbers the total nitrogen, phosphorus and\r\npotassium thus far enumerated which Japanese farmers apply or return\r\nannually to their twenty or twenty-one thousand square miles of\r\ncultivated fields, the case stands 385,214 tons of nitrogen, 91,656\r\ntons of phosphorus and 255,778 tons of potassium. These values are\r\nonly approximations and do not include the large volume and variety\r\nof fertilizers prepared from fish, which have long been used.\r\nNeither do they include the very large amount of nitrogen derived\r\ndirectly from the atmosphere through their long, extensive and\r\npersistent cultivation of soy beans and other legumes. Indeed, from\r\n1903 to 1906 the average area of paddy field upon which was grown a\r\nsecond crop of green manure in the form of some legume was 6.8 per\r\ncent of the total area of such fields aggregating 11,000 square\r\nmiles. In 1906 over 18 per cent of the upland fields also produced\r\nsome leguminous crop, these fields aggregating between 9,000 and\r\n10,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nWhile the values which have been given above, expressing the sum\r\ntotal of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium applied annually to the\r\ncultivated fields of Japan may be somewhat too high for some of the\r\nsources named, there is little doubt that Japanese farmers apply to\r\ntheir fields more of these three plant food elements annually than\r\nhas been computed. The amounts which have been given are sufficient\r\nto provide annually, for each acre of the 21,321 square miles of\r\ncultivated land, an application of not less than 56 pounds of\r\nnitrogen, 13 pounds of phosphorus and 37 pounds of potassium. Or, if\r\nwe omit the large northern island of Hokkaido, still new in its\r\nagriculture and lacking the intensive practices of the older farm\r\nland, the quantities are sufficient for a mean application of 60, 14\r\nand 40 pounds respectively of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium per\r\nacre, and yet the maturing of 1000 pounds of wheat crop, covering\r\ngrain and straw as water-free substance, removes from the soil but\r\n13.9 pounds of nitrogen, 2.3 pounds of phosphorus and 8.4 pounds of\r\npotassium, from which it may be computed that the 60 pounds of\r\nnitrogen added is sufficient for a crop yielding 31 bushels of\r\nwheat; the phosphorus is sufficient for a crop of 44 bushels, and\r\nthe potassium for a crop of 35 bushels per acre. Dr. Hopkins, in his\r\nrecent valuable work on \"Soil Fertility and Permanent Agriculture\"\r\ngives, on page 154, a table from which we abstract the following\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n\r\n APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM REMOVABLE\r\n                         PER ACRE ANNUALLY BY\r\n                                   Nitrogen,  Phosphorus,  Potassium,\r\n                                    pounds.     pounds.      pounds.\r\n 100 bush. crop of corn              148          23           71\r\n 100 bush. crop of oats               97          16           68\r\n  50 bush. crop of wheat              96          16           58\r\n  25 bush. crop of soy beans         159          21           73\r\n 100 bush. crop of rice              155          18           95\r\n   3 ton crop of timothy hay          72           9           71\r\n   4 ton crop of clover hay          160          20          120\r\n   3 ton crop of cow pea hay         130          14           98\r\n   8 ton crop of alfalfa hay         400          36          192\r\n7000 lb. crop of cotton              168          29.4         82\r\n 400 bush. crop of potatoes           84          17.3        120\r\n  20 ton crop of sugar beets         100          18          157\r\nAnnually applied in Japan, more than  60          14           40\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have inserted in this table, for comparison, the crop of rice,\r\nand have increased the crop of potatoes from three hundred bushels\r\nto four hundred bushels per acre, because such a yield, like all of\r\nthose named, is quite practicable under good management and\r\nfavorable seasons, notwithstanding the fact that much smaller yields\r\nare generally attained through lack of sufficient plant food or\r\nwater. From this table, assuming that a crop of matured grain\r\ncontains 11 per cent of water and the straw 15 per cent, while\r\npotatoes contain 79 per cent and beets 87 per cent, the amounts of\r\nthe three plant food elements removable annually by 1000 pounds of\r\ncrop have been calculated and stated in the next table.\r\n\r\n\r\n  APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN, PHOSPHORUS AND POTASSIUM\r\n  REMOVABLE ANNUALLY PER 1,0000 POUNDS OF DRY CROP SUBSTANCE\r\n                       Nitrogen,  Phosphorus,   Potassium,\r\n                        pounds.     pounds.       pounds.\r\n               Cereals.\r\nWheat                   13.873      2.312         8.382\r\nOats                    13.666      2.254         9.580\r\nCorn                    13.719      2.149         6.676\r\n               Legumes.\r\nSoy beans               30.807      4.070        14.147\r\nCow peas                25.490      2.745        19.216\r\nClover                  23.529      2.941        17.647\r\nAlfalfa                 29.411      2.647        14.118\r\n               Roots.\r\nBeets                   19.213      3.462        30.192\r\nPotatoes                15.556      3.210        22.222\r\n               Grass.\r\nTimothy                 14.117      1.765        13.922\r\nRice                     9.949      1.129         6.089\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium applied\r\nannually to the cultivated fields of Japan and from the data in\r\nthese two tables it may be readily seen that these people are now\r\nand probably long have been applying quite as much of these three\r\nplant food elements to their fields with each planting as are\r\nremoved with the crop, and if this is true in Japan it must also be\r\ntrue in China. Moreover there is nothing in American agricultural\r\npractice which indicates that we shall not ultimately be compelled\r\nto do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIN THE SHANTUNG PROVINCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 15th we left Shanghai by one of the coastwise steamers for\r\nTsingtao, some three hundred miles farther north, in the Shantung\r\nProvince, our object being to keep in touch with methods of tillage\r\nand fertilization, corresponding phases of which would occur later\r\nin the season there.\r\n\r\nThe Shantung province is in the latitude of North Carolina and\r\nKentucky, or lies between that of San Francisco and Los Angeles. It\r\nhas an area of nearly 56,000 square miles, about that of Wisconsin.\r\nLess than one-half of this area is cultivated land yet it is at the\r\npresent time supporting a population exceeding 38,000,000 of people.\r\nNew York state has today less than ten millions and more than half\r\nof these are in New York city.\r\n\r\nIt was in this province that Confucius was born 2461 years ago, and\r\nthat Mencius, his disciple, lived. Here, too, seventeen hundred\r\nyears before Confucius' time, after one of the great floods of the\r\nYellow river, 2297 B. C., and more than 4100 years ago, the Great Yu\r\nwas appointed \"Superintendent of Public Works\" and entrusted with\r\ndraining off the flood waters and canalizing the rivers.\r\n\r\nHere also was the beginning of the Boxer uprising. Tsingtao sits at\r\nthe entrance of Kiaochow Bay. Following the war of Japan with China\r\nthis was seized by Germany, November 14, 1897, nominally to\r\nindemnify for the murder of two German missionaries which had\r\noccurred in Shantung, and March 6th, 1898, this bay, to the high\r\nwater line, its islands and a \"Sphere of Influence\" extending thirty\r\nmiles in all directions from the boundary, together with Tsingtao,\r\nwas leased to Germany for ninety-nine years. Russia demanded and\r\nsecured a lease of Port Arthur at the same time. Great Britain\r\nobtained a similar lease of Weihaiwei in Shantung, while to France\r\nKwangchow-wan in southern China, was leased. But the \"encroachments\"\r\nof European powers did not stop with these leases and during the\r\nlatter part of 1898 the \"Policy of Spheres of Influence\" culminated\r\nin the international rivalry for railway concessions and mining.\r\nThese greatly alarmed China and uprisings broke out very naturally\r\nfirst in Shantung, among the people nearest of kin to the founders\r\nof the Empire. As might have been expected of a patriotic, even\r\nthough naturally peaceful people, they determined to defend their\r\ncountry against such encroachments and the Boxer troubles followed.\r\n\r\nTsingtao has a deep, commodious harbor always free from ice and\r\nGermany is constructing here very extensive and substantial harbor\r\nimprovements which will be of lasting benefit to the province and\r\nthe Empire. A pier four miles in length encloses the inner wharf,\r\nand a second wharf is nearing completion. Germany is also\r\nmaintaining a meteorological observatory here and has established a\r\nlarge, comprehensive Forest Garden, under excellent management,\r\nwhich is showing remarkable developments for so short a time.\r\n\r\nOur steamer entered the harbor during the night and, on going\r\nashore, we soon found that only Chinese and German were generally\r\nspoken; but through the kind assistance of Rev. W. H. Scott, of the\r\nAmerican Presbyterian Mission, an interpreter promised to call at my\r\nhotel in the evening, although he failed to appear. The afternoon\r\nwas spent at the Forest Garden and on the reforestation tract, which\r\nare under the supervision of Mr. Haas. The Forest Garden covers two\r\nhundred and seventy acres and the reforestation tract three thousand\r\nacres more. In the garden a great variety of forest and fruit trees\r\nand small fruits are being tried out with high promise of the most\r\nvaluable results.\r\n\r\nIt was in the steep hills about Tsingtao that we first saw at close\r\nrange serious soil erosion in China; and the returning of forest\r\ngrowth on hills nearly devoid of soil was here remarkable, in view\r\nof the long dry seasons which prevail from November to June, and\r\nFig. 118 shows how destitute of soil the crests of granite hills may\r\nbecome and yet how the coming back of the forest growth may hasten\r\nas soon as it is no longer cut away. The rock going into decay,\r\nwhere this view was taken, is an extremely coarse crystalline\r\ngranite, as may be seen in contrast with the watch, and it is\r\nfalling into decay at a marvelous rate. Disintegration has\r\npenetrated the rock far below the surface and the large crystals are\r\nheld together with but little more tenacity than prevails in a bed\r\nof gravel. Moisture and even roots penetrate it deeply and readily\r\nand the crystals fall apart with thrusts of the knife blade, the\r\nrock crumbling with the greatest freedom. Roadways have been\r\nextensively carved along the sides of the hills with the aid of only\r\npick and shovel. Close examination of the rock shows that layers of\r\nsediment exist between the crystal faces, either washed down by\r\npercolating rain or formed through decomposition of the crystals in\r\nplace. The next illustration, Fig. 119, shows how large the growth\r\non such soils may be, and in Fig. 120 the vegetation and forest\r\ngrowth are seen coming back, closely covering just such soil\r\nsurfaces and rock structure as are indicated in Figs. 118 and 119.\r\n\r\nThese views are taken on the reforestation tract at Tsingtao but\r\nmost of the growth is volunteer, standing now protected by the\r\nGerman government in their effort to see what may be possible under\r\ncareful supervision.\r\n\r\nThe loads of pine bough fuel represented in Fig. 80 were gathered\r\nfrom such hills and from such forest growth as are here represented,\r\nbut on lands more distant from the city. But Tsingtao, with its\r\nforty thousand Chinese, and Kiaochow across the bay, with its one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand more, and other villages dotting the\r\nnarrow plains, maintain a very great demand for such growth on the\r\nhill lands. The wonder is that forest growth has persisted at all\r\nand has contributed so much in the way of fuel.\r\n\r\nGrowing in the Forest Garden was a most beautiful wild yellow rose,\r\nnative to Shantung, being used for landscape effect in the parking,\r\nand it ought to be widely introduced into other countries wherever\r\nit will thrive. It was growing as heavy borders and massive clumps\r\nsix to eight feet high, giving a most wonderful effect, with its\r\nbrilliant, dense cloud of the richest yellow bloom. The blossoms are\r\nsingle, fully as large as the Rosa rugosa, with the tips of the\r\npetals shading into the most dainty light straw yellow, while the\r\ncenter is a deep orange, the contrast being sufficient to show in\r\nthe photograph from which Fig. 121 was prepared. Another beautiful\r\nand striking feature of this rose is the clustering of the blossoms\r\nin one-sided wreath-like sprays, sometimes twelve to eighteen inches\r\nlong, the flowers standing close enough to even overlap.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter engaged for us failed to appear as per agreement so\r\nthe next morning we took the early train for Tsinan to obtain a\r\ngeneral view of the country and to note the places most favorable as\r\npoints for field study. We had resolved also to make an effort to\r\nsecure an interpreter through the American Presbyterian College at\r\nTsinan. Leaving Tsingtao, the train skirts around the Kiaochow bay\r\nfor a distance of nearly fifty miles, where we pass the city of the\r\nsame name with its population of 120,000, which had an import and\r\nexport trade in 1905 valued at over $24,000,000. At Sochen we passed\r\nthrough a coal mining district where coal was being brought to the\r\ncars in baskets carried by men. The coal on the loaded open cars was\r\nsprinkled with whitewash, serving as a seal to safe-guard against\r\nstealing during transit, making it so that none could be removed\r\nwithout the fact being revealed by breaking the seal. This practice\r\nis general in China and is applied to many commodities handled in\r\nbulk. We saw baskets of milled rice carried by coolies sealed with a\r\npattern laid over the surface by sprinkling some colored powder upon\r\nit. Cut stone, corded for the market, was whitewashed in the same\r\nmanner as the coal.\r\n\r\nAs we were approaching Weihsien, another city of 100,000 people, we\r\nidentified one of the deeply depressed, centuries-old roadways, worn\r\neight to ten feet deep, by chancing to see half a dozen teams\r\npassing along it as the train crossed. We had passed several and\r\nwere puzzling to account for such peculiar erosion. The teams gave\r\nthe explanation and thus connected our earlier reading with the\r\nconcrete. Along these deep-cut roadways caravans may pass, winding\r\nthrough the fields, entirely unobserved unless one chances to be\r\nclose along the line or the movement is discovered by clouds of\r\ndust, one of the methods that has produced them, and we would not be\r\nsurprised if gathering manure from them has played a large part\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWeihsien is near one of the great commercial highways of China and\r\nin the center of one of the coal mining regions of the province.\r\nStill further along towards Tsinan we passed Tsingchowfu, another of\r\nthe large cities of the province, with 150,000 population. All day\r\nwe rode through fields of wheat, always planted in rows, and in\r\nhills in the row east of Kaumi, but in single or double continuous\r\ndrills westward from here to Tsinan. Thousands of wells used for\r\nirrigation, of the type seen in Fig. 123, were passed during the\r\nday, many of them recently dug to supply water for the barley\r\nsuffering from the severe drought which was threatening the crop at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIt was 6:30 P. M. before our train pulled into the station at\r\nTsinan; 7:30 when we had finished supper and engaged a ricksha to\r\ntake us to the American Presbyterian College in quest of an\r\ninterpreter. We could not speak Chinese, the ricksha boy could\r\nneither speak nor understand a word of English, but the hotel\r\nproprietor had instructed him where to go. We plunged into the\r\nnarrow streets of a great Chinese city, the boy running wherever he\r\ncould, walking where he must on account of the density of the crowds\r\nor the roughness of the stone paving. We had turned many corners,\r\ncrossed bridges and passed through tunneled archways in sections of\r\nthe massive city walls, until it was getting dusk and the ricksha\r\nman purchased and lighted a lantern. We were to reach the college in\r\nthirty minutes but had been out a full hour. A little later the boy\r\ndrew up to and held conference with a policeman. The curious of the\r\nstreet gathered about and it dawned upon us that we were lost in the\r\nnight in the narrow streets of a Chinese city of a hundred thousand\r\npeople. To go further would be useless for the gates of the mission\r\ncompound would be locked. We could only indicate by motions our\r\ndesire to return, but these were not understood. On the train a\r\nthoughtful, kindly old German had recognized a stranger in a foreign\r\nland and volunteered useful information, cutting from his daily\r\npaper an advertisement describing a good hotel. This gave the name\r\nof the hotel in German, English and in Chinese characters. We handed\r\nthis to the policeman, pointing to the name of the hotel, indicating\r\nby motions the desire to return, but apparently he was unable to\r\nread in either language and seemed to think we were assuming to\r\ndirect the way to the college. A man and boy in the crowd apparently\r\nvolunteered to act as escort for us. The throng parted and we left\r\nthem, turned more corners into more unlighted narrow alleyways, one\r\nof which was too difficult to permit us to ride. The escorts, if\r\nsuch they were, finally left us, but the dark alley led on until it\r\nterminated at the blank face, probably of some other portion of the\r\nmassive city wall we had thrice threaded through lighted tunnels.\r\nHere the ricksha boy stopped and turned about but the light from his\r\nlantern was too feeble to permit reading the workings of his mind\r\nthrough his face, and our tongues were both utterly useless in this\r\nemergency, so we motioned for him to turn back and by some route we\r\nreached the hotel at 11 P. M.\r\n\r\nWe abandoned the effort to visit the college, for the purpose of\r\nsecuring an interpreter, and took the early train back to Tsingtao,\r\nreaching there in time to secure the very satisfactory service of\r\nMr. Chu Wei Yung, through the further kind offices of Mr. Scott. We\r\nhad been twice over the road between the two cities, obtaining a\r\ngeneral idea of the country and of the crops and field operations at\r\nthis season. The next morning we took an early train to Tsangkau and\r\nwere ready to walk through the fields and to talk with the last\r\ngenerations of more than forty unbroken centuries of farmers who,\r\nwith brain and brawn, have successfully and continuously sustained\r\nlarge families on small areas without impoverishing their soil. The\r\nnext illustration is from a photograph taken in one of these fields.\r\nWe astonished the old farmer by asking the privilege of holding his\r\nplow through one round in his little field, but he granted the\r\nprivilege readily. Our furrow was not as well turned as his, nor as\r\nwell as we could have done with a two-handled Oliver or John Deere,\r\nbut it was better than the old man had expected and won his respect.\r\n\r\nThis plow had a good steel point, as a separate, blunt, V-shaped\r\npiece, and a moldboard of cast steel with a good twist which turned\r\nthe soil well. The standard and sole were of wood and at the end of\r\nthe beam was a block for gauging the depth of furrow. The cost of\r\nthis plow, to the farmer, was $2.15, gold, and when the day's work\r\nis done it is taken home on the shoulders, even though the distance\r\nmay be a mile or more, and carefully housed. Chinese history states\r\nthat the plow was invented by Shennung, who lived 2737-2697 B. C.\r\nand \"taught the art of agriculture and the medical use of herbs\". He\r\nis honored as the \"God of Agriculture and Medicine.\"\r\n\r\nThrough my interpreter we learned that there were twelve in this\r\nman's family, which he maintained on fifteen mow of land, or 2.5\r\nacres, together with his team, consisting of a cow and small donkey,\r\nbesides feeding two pigs. This is at the rate of 192 people, 16\r\ncows, 16 donkeys and 32 pigs on a forty-acre farm; and of a\r\npopulation density equivalent to 3072 people, 256 cows, 256 donkeys\r\nand 512 swine per square mile of cultivated field.\r\n\r\nOn another small holding we talked with the farmer standing at the\r\nwell in Fig. 27, where he was irrigating a little piece of barley 30\r\nfeet wide and 138 feet long. He owned and was cultivating but one\r\nand two-thirds acres of land and yet there were ten in his family\r\nand he kept one donkey and usually one pig. Here is a maintenance\r\ncapacity at the rate of 240 people, 24 donkeys and 24 pigs on a\r\nforty-acre farm; and a population density of 3840 people, 384\r\ndonkeys and 384 pigs per square mile. His usual annual sales in good\r\nseasons were equivalent in value to $73, gold.\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases the crops grown were wheat, barley, large and\r\nsmall millet, sweet potatoes and soy beans or peanuts. Much straw\r\nbraid is manufactured in the province by the women and children in\r\ntheir homes, and the cargo of the steamer on which we returned to\r\nShanghai consisted almost entirely of shelled peanuts in gunny sacks\r\nand huge bales of straw braid destined for the manufacture of hats\r\nin Europe and America.\r\n\r\nShantung has only moderate rainfall, little more than 24 inches\r\nannually, and this fact has played an important part in determining\r\nthe agricultural practices of these very old people. In Fig. 123 is\r\na closer view than Fig. 27 of the farmer watering his little field\r\nof barley. The well had just been dug over eight feet deep,\r\nexpressly and solely to water this one piece of grain once, after\r\nwhich it would be filled and the ground planted.\r\n\r\nThe season had been unusually dry, as had been the one before, and\r\nthe people were fearing famine. Only 2.44 inches of rain had fallen\r\nat Tsingtao between the end of the preceding October and our visit,\r\nMay 21st, and hundreds of such temporary wells had been or were\r\nbeing dug all along both sides of the two hundred and fifty miles of\r\nrailway, and nearly all to be filled when the crop on the ground was\r\nirrigated, to release the land for one to follow. The homes are in\r\nvillages a mile or more apart and often the holdings or rentals are\r\nscattered, separated by considerable distances, hence easy\r\nportability is the key-note in the construction of this irrigating\r\noutfit. The bucket is very light, simply a woven basket waterproofed\r\nwith a paste of bean flour. The windlass turns like a long spool on\r\na single pin and the standard is a tripod with removable legs. Some\r\nwells we saw were sixteen or twenty feet deep and in these the water\r\nwas raised by a cow walking straight away at the end of a rope.\r\n\r\nThe amount and distribution of rainfall in this province, as\r\nindicated by the mean of ten years' records at Tsingtao, obtained at\r\nthe German Meteorological Observatory through the courtesy of Dr. B.\r\nMeyermanns, are given in the table in which the rainfall of Madison,\r\nWisconsin, is inserted for comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mean monthly rainfall.

This greater summer rainfall, with\r\npersistent fertilization and intense management, in a warm latitude,\r\nare some of the elements permitting Shantung today to feed\r\n38,247,900 people from an area equal to that upon which Wisconsin is\r\nyet feeding but 2,333,860. Must American agriculture ultimately feed\r\nsixteen people where it is now feeding but one? If so,\r\ncorrespondingly more intense and effective practices must follow,\r\nand we can neither know too well nor too early what these Old World\r\npeople have been driven to do; how they have succeeded, and how we\r\nand they may improve upon their practices and lighten the human\r\nburdens by more fully utilizing physical forces and mechanical\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nAs we passed on to other fields we found a mother and daughter\r\ntransplanting sweet potatoes on carefully fitted ridges of nearly\r\nair-dry soil in a little field, the remnant of a table on a deeply\r\neroded hillside, Fig. 124. The husband was bringing water for\r\nmoistening the soil from a deep ravine a quarter of a mile distant,\r\ncarrying it on his shoulder in two buckets, Fig. 125, across an\r\nintervening gulch. He had excavated four holes at intervals up the\r\ngulch and from these, with a broken gourd dipper mended with\r\nstitches, he filled his pails, bailing in succession from one to the\r\nother in regular rotation.\r\n\r\nThe daughter was transplanting. Holding the slip with its tip\r\nbetween thumb and fingers, a strong forward stroke plowed a furrow\r\nin the mellow, dry soil; then, with a backward movement and a\r\ndownward thrust, planted the slip, firmed the soil about it, leaving\r\na depression in which the mother poured about a pint of water from\r\nanother gourd dipper. After this water had soaked away, dry earth\r\nwas drawn about the slip and firmed and looser earth drawn over\r\nthis, the only tools being the naked hands and dipper.\r\n\r\nThe father and mother were dressed in coarse garb but the daughter\r\nwas neatly clad, with delicate hands decorated with rings and a\r\nbracelet. Neither of the women had bound feet. There were ten in his\r\nfamily; and on adjacent similar areas they had small patches of\r\nwheat nearly ready for the harvest, all planted in hills, hoed, and\r\nin astonishingly vigorous condition considering the extreme drought\r\nwhich prevailed. The potatoes were being planted under these extreme\r\nconditions in anticipation of the rainy season which then was fully\r\ndue. The summer before had been one of unusual drought, and famine\r\nwas threatened. The government had recently issued an edict that no\r\nsheep should be sold from the province, fearing they might be needed\r\nfor food. An old woman in one of the villages came out, as we walked\r\nthrough, and inquired of my interpreter if we had come to make it\r\nrain. Such was the stress under which we found these people.\r\n\r\nOne of the large farmers, owning ten acres, stated that his usual\r\nyield of wheat in good season was 160 catty per mow, equivalent to\r\n21.3 bushels per acre. He was expecting the current season not more\r\nthan one half this amount. As a fertilizer he used a prepared earth\r\ncompost which we shall describe later, mixing it with the grain and\r\nsowing in the hills with the seed, applying about 5333 pounds per\r\nacre, which he valued, in our currency, at $8.60, or $3.22 per ton.\r\nA pile of such prepared compost is seen in Fig. 126, ready to be\r\ntransferred to the field. The views show with what cleanliness the\r\nyard is kept and with what care all animal waste is saved. The cow\r\nand donkey are the work team, such as was being used by the plowman\r\nreferred to in Fig. 122. The mounds in the background of the lower\r\nview are graves; the fence behind the animals is made from the stems\r\nof the large millet, kaoliang, while that at the right of the donkey\r\nis made of earth, both indicative of the scarcity of lumber. The\r\nbuildings, too, are thatched and their walls are of earth plastered\r\nwith an earthen mortar worked up with chaff.\r\n\r\nIn another field a man plowing and fertilizing for sweet potatoes\r\nhad brought to the field and laid down in piles the finely\r\npulverized dry compost. The father was plowing; his son of sixteen\r\nyears was following and scattering, from a basket, the pulverized\r\ndry compost in the bottom of the furrow. The next furrow covered the\r\nfertilizer, four turned together forming a ridge upon which the\r\npotatoes were to be planted after a second and older son had\r\nsmoothed and fitted the crest with a heavy hand rake. The fertilizer\r\nwas thus applied directly beneath the row, at the rate of 7400\r\npounds per acre, valued at $7.15, our currency, or $1.93 per ton.\r\n\r\nWe were astonished at the moist condition of the soil turned, which\r\nwas such as to pack in the hand notwithstanding the extreme drought\r\nprevailing and the fact that standing water in the ground was more\r\nthan eight feet below the surface. The field had been without crop\r\nand cultivated. To the question, \"What yield of sweet potatoes do\r\nyou expect from this piece of land?\" he replied, \"About 4000 catty,\"\r\nwhich is 440 bushels of 56 pounds per acre. The usual market price\r\nwas stated to be $1.00, Mexican, per one hundred catty, making the\r\ngross value of the crop $79.49, gold, per acre. His land was valued\r\nat $60, Mexican, per mow, or $154.80 per acre, gold.\r\n\r\nMy interpreter informed me that the average well-to-do farmers in\r\nthis part of Shantung own from fifteen to twenty mow of land and\r\nthis amount is quite ample to provide for eight people. Such farmers\r\nusually keep two cows, two donkeys and eight or ten pigs. The less\r\nwell-to-do or small farmers own two to five mow and act as\r\nsuperintendents for the larger farmers. Taking the largest holding,\r\nof twenty mow per family of eight people, as a basis, the density\r\nper square mile would be 1536 people, and an area of farm land equal\r\nto the state of Wisconsin would have 86,000,000 people; 21,500,000\r\ncows; 21,500,000 donkeys and 86,000,000 swine. These observations\r\napply to one of the most productive sections of the province, but\r\nvery large areas of land in the province are not cultivable and the\r\nlast census showed the total population nearly one-half of this\r\namount. It is clear, therefore, that either very effective\r\nagricultural methods are practiced or else extreme economy is\r\nexercised. Both are true.\r\n\r\nOn this day in the fields our interpreter procured his dinner at a\r\nfarm house, bringing us four boiled eggs, for which he paid at the\r\nrate of 8.3 cents of our money, but his dinner was probably included\r\nin the price. The next table gives the prices for some articles\r\nobtained by inquiry at the Tsingtao market, May 23rd, 1909, reduced\r\nto our currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Cents\r\nOld potatoes, per lb                2.18\r\nNew potatoes, per lb                2.87\r\nSalted turnip, per lb                .86\r\nOnions, per lb                      4.10\r\nRadishes, bunch of 10               1.29\r\nString beans, per lb               11.46\r\nCucumbers, per lb                   5.78\r\nPears, per lb                       5.73\r\nApricots, per lb                    8.60\r\nPork, fresh, per lb                10.33\r\nFish, per lb                        5.73\r\nEggs, per dozen                     5.16\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only items which are low compared with our own prices are salted\r\nturnips, radishes and eggs. Most of the articles listed were out of\r\nseason for the locality and were imported for the foreigners,\r\nturnips, radishes, pork, fish and eggs being the exceptions. Prof.\r\nRoss informs us that he found eggs selling in Shensi at four for one\r\ncent of our money.\r\n\r\nOur interpreter asked a compensation of one dollar, Mexican, or 43\r\ncents, U. S. currency, per day, he furnishing his own meals. The\r\nusual wage for farm labor here was $8.60, per year, with board and\r\nlodging. We have referred to the wages paid by missionaries for\r\ndomestic service. As servants the Chinese are considered efficient,\r\nfaithful and trustworthy. It was the custom of Mr. and Mrs. League\r\nto intrust them with the purse for marketing, feeling that they\r\ncould be depended upon for the closest bargaining. Commonly, when\r\ninstructed to procure a certain article, if they found the price one\r\nor two cash higher than usual they would select a cheaper\r\nsubstitute. If questioned as to why instructions were not followed\r\nthe reply would be \"Too high, no can afford.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. League recited her experience with her cook regarding his use\r\nof our kitchen appliances. After fitting the kitchen with a modern\r\nrange and cooking utensils, and working with him to familiarize him\r\nwith their use, she was surprised, on going into the kitchen a few\r\ndays later, to find that the old Chinese stove had been set on the\r\nrange and the cooking being done with the usual Chinese furniture.\r\nWhen asked why he was not using the stove his reply was \"Take too\r\nmuch fire.\" Nothing jars on the nerves of these people more than\r\nincurring of needless expense, extravagance in any form, or poor\r\njudgment in making purchases.\r\n\r\nDaily we became more and more impressed by the evidence of the\r\nintense and incessant stress imposed by the dense populations of\r\ncenturies, and how, under it, the laws of heredity have wrought upon\r\nthe people, affecting constitution, habits and character. Even the\r\ncattle and sheep have not escaped its irresistible power. Many times\r\nin this province we saw men herding flocks of twenty to thirty sheep\r\nalong the narrow unfenced pathways winding through the fields, and\r\non the grave lands. The prevailing drought had left very little\r\ngreen to be had from these places and yet sheep were literally\r\nbrushing their sides against fresh green wheat and barley, never\r\nmolesting them. Time and again the flocks were stampeded into the\r\ngrain by an approaching train, but immediately they returned to\r\ntheir places without taking a nibble. The voice of the shepherd and\r\nan occasional well aimed lump of earth only being required to bring\r\nthem back to their uninviting pastures.\r\n\r\nIn Kiangsu and Chekiang provinces a line of half a dozen white goats\r\nwere often seen feeding single file along the pathways, held by a\r\ncord like a string of beads, sometimes led by a child. Here, too,\r\none of the most common sights was the water buffalo grazing\r\nunattended among the fields along the paths and canal banks, with\r\ncrops all about, One of the most memorable shocks came to us in\r\nChekiang, China, when we had fallen into a revery while gazing at\r\nthe shifting landscape from the doorway of our low-down Chinese\r\nhouseboat. Something in the sky and the vegetation along the canal\r\nbank had recalled the scenes of boyhood days and it seemed, as we\r\nlooked aslant up the bank with its fringe of grass, that we were\r\ngliding along Whitewater creek through familiar meadows and that\r\nstanding up would bring the old home in sight. That instant there\r\nglided into view, framed in the doorway and projected high against\r\nthe tinted sky above the setting sun, a giant water buffalo standing\r\nmotionless as a statue on the summit of a huge grave mound, lifted\r\nfully ten feet above the field. But in a flash this was replaced by\r\na companion scene, and with all its beautiful setting, which had\r\nbeen as suddenly fixed on the memory fourteen years before in the\r\nfar away Trossachs when our coach, hurriedly rounding a sharp turn\r\nin the hills, suddenly exposed a wild ox of Scotland similarly\r\nthrust against the sky from a small but isolated rocky summit, and\r\nthen, outspeeding the wireless, recollection crossed two oceans and\r\nan intervening continent, bringing us back to China before a speed\r\nof five miles, per hour could move the first picture across the\r\nnarrow doorway.\r\n\r\nIt was through the fields about Tsangkow that the stalwart\r\nfreighters referred to, Fig. 32, passed us on one of the paths\r\nleading from Kiaochow through unnumbered country villages, already\r\neleven miles on their way with their wheelbarrows loaded with\r\nmatches made in Japan. Many of the wheelbarrow men seen in Shanghai\r\nand other cities are from Shantung families, away for employment,\r\nexpecting to return. During the harvest season, too, many of these\r\npeople go west and north into Manchuria seeking employment,\r\nreturning to their homes in winter. Alexander Hosie, in his book on\r\nManchuria, states that from Chefoo alone more than 20,000 Chinese\r\nlaborers cross to Newchwang every spring by steamer, others finding\r\ntheir way there by junks or other means, so that after the harvest\r\nseason 8,000 more return by steamer to Chefoo than left that way in\r\nthe spring, from which he concludes that Shantung annually supplies\r\nManchuria with agricultural labor to the extent of 30,000 men.\r\n\r\nAbout the average condition of wheat in Shantung during this dry\r\nseason, and nearing maturity, is seen in Fig. 127, standing rather\r\nmore than three feet high, as indicated by our umbrella between the\r\nrows. Beyond the wheat and to the right, grave mounds serrate the\r\nsky line, no hills being in sight, for we were in the broad plain\r\nbuilt up from the sea between the two mountain islands forming the\r\nhighlands of Shantung.\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd we were in the fields north of Kiaochow, some sixty\r\nmiles by rail west from Tsingtao, but within the neutral zone\r\nextending thirty miles back from the high water line of the bay of\r\nthe same name. Here the Germans had built a broad macadam road after\r\nthe best European type but over it were passing the vehicles of\r\nforty centuries seen in Figs. 128 and 129. It is doubtful if the\r\nresistance to travel experienced by these men on the better road was\r\nenough less than that on the old paths they had left to convince\r\nthem that the cost of construction and maintenance would be worth\r\nwhile until vehicles and the price of labor change. It may appear\r\nstrange that with a nation of so many millions and with so long a\r\nhistory, roads have persisted as little more than beaten foot-paths;\r\nbut modern methods of transportation have remained physical\r\nimpossibilities to every people until the science of the last\r\ncentury opened the way. Throughout their history the burdens of\r\nthese people have been carried largely on foot, mostly on the feet\r\nof men, and of single men wherever the load could be advantageously\r\ndivided. Animals have been supplemental burden bearers but, as with\r\nthe men, they have carried the load directly on their own feet, the\r\nmode least disturbed by inequalities of road surface.\r\n\r\nFor adaptability to the worst road conditions no vehicle equals the\r\nwheelbarrow, progressing by one wheel and two feet. No vehicle is\r\nused more in China, if the carrying pole is excepted, and no\r\nwheelbarrow in the world permits so high an efficiency of human\r\npower as the Chinese, as must be clear from Figs. 32 and 61, where\r\nnearly the whole load is balanced on the axle of a high, massive\r\nwheel with broad tire. A shoulder band from the handles of the\r\nbarrow relieves the strain on the hands and, when the load or the\r\nroad is heavy, men or animals may aid in drawing, or even, when the\r\nwind is favorable, it is not unusual to hoist a sail to gain\r\npropelling power. It is only in northern China, and then in the more\r\nlevel portions, where there are few or no canals, that carts have\r\nbeen extensively used, but are more difficult to manage on bad\r\nroads. Most of the heavy carts, especially those in Manchuria, seen\r\nin Fig. 203, have the wheels framed rigidly to the axle which\r\nrevolves with them, the bearing being in the bed of the cart. But\r\nnew carts of modern type are being introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the extent of development and utilization of inland waterways no\r\npeople have approached the Chinese. In the matter of land\r\ntransportation they have clearly followed the line of least\r\nresistance for individual initiative, so characteristic of\r\nindustrial China.\r\n\r\nThere are Government courier or postal roads which connect Peking\r\nwith the most distant parts of the Empire, some twenty-one being\r\nusually enumerated. These, as far as practicable, take the shortest\r\ncourse, are often cut into the mountain sides and even pass through\r\ntunnels. In the plains regions these roads may be sixty to\r\nseventy-five feet wide, paved and occasionally bordered by rows of\r\ntrees. In some cases, too, signal towers are erected at intervals of\r\nthree miles and there are inns along the way, relay posts and\r\nstations for soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of planting grain in rows and in hills in the row. In\r\nFig. 130 is a field with the rows planted in pairs, the members\r\nbeing 16 inches apart, and together occupying 30 inches. The space\r\nbetween each pair is also 30 inches, making five feet in all. This\r\nmakes frequent hoeing practicable, which is begun early in the\r\nspring and is repeated after every rain. It also makes it possible\r\nto feed the plants when they can utilize food to the best advantage\r\nand to repeat the feeding if desirable. Besides, the ground in the\r\nwider space may be fitted, fertilized and another crop planted\r\nbefore the first is removed. The hills alternate in the rows and are\r\n24 to 26 inches from center to center.\r\n\r\nThe planting may be done by hand or with a drill such as that in\r\nFig. 131, ingenious in the simple mechanism which permits planting\r\nin hills. The husbandman had just returned from the field with the\r\ndrill on his shoulder when we met at the door of his village home,\r\nwhere he explained to us the construction and operation of the drill\r\nand permitted the photograph to be taken, but turning his face\r\naside, not wishing to represent a specific character, in the view.\r\nIn the drill there was a heavy leaden weight swinging free from a\r\npoint above the space between the openings leading to the respective\r\ndrill feet. When planting, the operator rocks the drill from side to\r\nside, causing the weight to hang first over one and then over the\r\nother opening, thus securing alternation of hills in each pair of\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nCounting the heads of wheat in the hill in a number of fields showed\r\nthem ranging between 20 and 100, the distance between the rows and\r\nbetween the hills as stated above. There were always a larger number\r\nof stalks per hill where the water capacity of the soil was large,\r\nwhere the ground water was near the surface, and where the soil was\r\nevidently of good quality. This may have been partly the result of\r\nstooling but we have little doubt that judgment was exercised in\r\nplanting, sowing less seed on the lighter soils where less moisture\r\nwas available. In the piece just referred to, in the illustration,\r\nan average hill contained 46 stalks and the number of kernels in a\r\nhead varied between 20 and 30. Taking Richardson's estimate of\r\n12,000 kernels of wheat to the pound, this field would yield about\r\ntwelve bushels of wheat per acre this unusually dry season. Our\r\ninterpreter, whose parents lived near Kaomi, four stations further\r\nwest, stated that in 1901, one of their best seasons, farmers there\r\nsecured yields as high as 875 catty per legal mow, which is at the\r\nrate of 116 bushels per acre. Such a yield on small areas highly\r\nfertilized and carefully tilled, when the rainfall is ample or where\r\nirrigation is practiced, is quite possible and in the Kiangsu\r\nprovince we observed individual small fields which would certainly\r\napproach close to this figure.\r\n\r\nFurther along in our journey of the day we came upon a field where\r\nthree, one of them a boy of fourteen years, were hoeing and thinning\r\nmillet and maize. In China, during the hot weather, the only garment\r\nworn by the men in the field, was their trousers, and the boy had\r\nfound these unnecessary, although he slipped into them while we were\r\ntalking with his father. The usual yield of maize was set at 420 to\r\n480 catty per mow, and that of millet at 600 catty, or 60 to 68.5\r\nbushels of maize and 96 bushels of millet, of fifty pounds, per\r\nacre, and the usual price would make the gross earnings $23.48 to\r\n$26.83 per acre for the maize, and $30.96, gold, for the millet.\r\n\r\nIt was evident when walking through these fields that the fall-sowed\r\ngrain was standing the drought far better than the barley planted in\r\nthe spring, quite likely because of the deeper and stronger\r\ndevelopment of root system made possible by the longer period of\r\ngrowth, and partly because the wheat had made much of its growth\r\nutilizing water that had fallen before the barley was planted and\r\nwhich would have been lost from the soil through percolation and\r\nsurface evaporation. Farmers here are very particular to hoe their\r\ngrain, beginning in the early spring, and always after rains,\r\nthoroughly appreciating the efficiency of earth mulches. Their hoe,\r\nseen in Fig. 132, is peculiarly well adapted to its purpose, the\r\nbroad blade being so hung that it draws nearly parallel with the\r\nsurface, cutting shallow and permitting the soil to drop practically\r\nupon the place from which it was loosened. These hoes are made in\r\nthree parts; a wooden handle, a long, strong and heavy iron socket\r\nshank, and a blade of steel. The blade is detachable and different\r\nforms and sizes of blades may be used on the same shank. The\r\nmulch-producing blades may have a cutting edge thirteen inches long\r\nand a width of nine inches.\r\n\r\nAt short intervals on either hand, along the two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles of railway between Tsingtao and Tsinan, were observed many\r\npiles of earth compost distributed in the fields. One of these piles\r\nis seen in Fig. 133. They were sometimes on unplanted fields, in\r\nother cases they occurred among the growing crops soon to be\r\nharvested, or where another crop was to be planted between the rows\r\nof one already on the ground. Some of these piles were six feet\r\nhigh. All were built in cubical form with flat top and carefully\r\nplastered with a layer of earth mortar which sometimes cracked on\r\ndrying, as seen in the illustration. The purpose of this careful\r\nshaping and plastering we did not learn although our interpreter\r\nstated it was to prevent the compost from being appropriated for use\r\non adjacent fields. Such a finish would have the effect of a seal,\r\nshowing if the pile had been disturbed, but we suspect other\r\nadvantages are sought by the treatment, which involves so large an\r\namount of labor.\r\n\r\nThe amount of this earth compost prepared and used annually in\r\nShantung is large, as indicated by the cases cited, where more than\r\nfive thousand pounds, in one instance, and seven thousand pounds in\r\nanother, were applied per acre for one crop. When two or more crops\r\nare grown the same year on the same ground, each is fertilized,\r\nhence from three to six or more tons may be applied to each\r\ncultivated acre. The methods of preparing compost and of fertilizing\r\nin Kiangsu, Chekiang and Kwangtung provinces have been described. In\r\nthis part of Shantung, in Chihli and north in Manchuria as far as\r\nMukden, the methods are materially different and if possible even\r\nmore laborious, but clearly rational and effective. Here nearly if\r\nnot all fertilizer compost is prepared in the villages and carried\r\nto the fields, however distant these may be.\r\n\r\nRev. T. J. League very kindly accompanied us to Chengyang on the\r\nrailway, from which we walked some two miles, back to a prosperous\r\nrural village to see their methods of preparing this compost\r\nfertilizer. It was toward the close of the afternoon before we\r\nreached the village, and from all directions husbandmen were\r\nreturning from the fields, some with hoes, some with plows, some\r\nwith drills over their shoulders and others leading donkeys or\r\ncattle, and similar customs obtain in Japan, as seen in Fig. 134.\r\nThese were mostly the younger men. When we reached the village\r\nstreets the older men, all bareheaded, as were those returning from\r\nthe fields, and usually with their queues tied about the crown, were\r\nvisiting, enjoying their pipes of tobacco.\r\n\r\nOpium is no longer used openly in China, unless it be permitted to\r\nsome well along in years with the habit confirmed, and the growing\r\nof the poppy is prohibited. The penalties for violating the law are\r\nheavy and enforcement is said to be rigid and effective. For the\r\nfirst violation a fine is imposed. If convicted of a second\r\nviolation the fine is heavier with imprisonment added to help the\r\nvictim acquire self control, and a third conviction may bring the\r\ndeath penalty. The eradication of the opium scourge must prove a\r\ngreat blessing to China. But with the passing of this most\r\nformidable evil, for whose infliction upon China England was largely\r\nresponsible, it is a great misfortune that through the pitiless\r\nefforts of the British-American Tobacco Company her people are\r\nrapidly becoming addicted to the western tobacco habit, selfish\r\nbeyond excuse, filthy beyond measure, and unsanitary in its\r\npolluting and oxygen-destroying effect upon the air all are\r\ncompelled to breathe. It has already become a greater and more\r\ninexcusable burden upon mankind than opium ever was.\r\n\r\nChina, with her already overtaxed fields, can ill afford to give\r\nover an acre to the cultivation of this crop and she should prohibit\r\nthe growing of tobacco as she has that of the poppy. Let her take\r\nthe wise step now when she readily may, for all civilized nations\r\nwill ultimately be compelled to adopt such a measure. The United\r\nStates in 1902 had more than a million acres growing tobacco, and\r\nharvested 821,000,000 pounds of leaf. This leaf depleted those soils\r\nto the extent of more than twenty eight million pounds of nitrogen,\r\ntwenty-nine million pounds of potassium and nearly two and a half\r\nmillion pounds of phosphorus, all so irrecoverably lost that even\r\nChina, with her remarkable skill in saving and her infinite patience\r\nwith little things, could not recover them for her soils. On a like\r\narea of field might as readily be grown twenty million bushels of\r\nwheat and if the twelve hundred million pounds of grain were all\r\nexported it would deplete the soil less than the tobacco crop in\r\neverything but phosphorus, and in this about the same. Used at home,\r\nChina would return it all to one or another field. The home\r\nconsumption of tobacco in the United States averaged seven pounds\r\nper capita in 1902. A like consumption for China's four hundred\r\nmillions would call for 2800 million pounds of leaf. If she grew it\r\non her fields two million acres would not suffice. Her soils would\r\nbe proportionately depleted and she would be short forty million\r\nbushels of wheat; but if China continues to import her tobacco the\r\nvast sum expended can neither fertilize her fields nor feed, clothe\r\nor educate her people, yet a like sum expended in the importation of\r\nwheat would feed her hungry and enrich her soils.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of conservation of national resources here is one of\r\nthe greatest opportunities open to all civilized nations. What might\r\nnot be done in the United States with a fund of $57,000,000\r\nannually, the market price of the raw tobacco leaf, and the land,\r\nthe labor and the capital expended in getting the product to the men\r\nwho puff, breathe and perspire the noxious product into the air\r\neveryone must breathe, and who bespatter the streets, sidewalks, the\r\nfloor of every public place and conveyance, and befoul the million\r\nspittoons, smoking rooms and smoking cars, all unnecessary and\r\nshould be uncalled for, but whose installation and up-keep the\r\nnon-user as well as the user is forced to pay, and this in a country\r\nof, for and by the people. This costly, filthy, selfish tobacco\r\nhabit should be outgrown. Let it begin in every new home, where the\r\nmother helps the father in refusing to set the example, and let its\r\nindulgence be absolutely prohibited to everyone while in public\r\nschool and to all in educational institutions.\r\n\r\nMr. League had been given a letter of introduction to one of the\r\nleading farmers of the village and it chanced that as we reached the\r\nentrance way to big home we were met by his son, just returning from\r\nthe fields with his drill on his shoulder, and it is he standing in\r\nthe illustration, Fig. 131, holding the letter of introduction in\r\nhis hand. After we had taken this photograph and another one looking\r\ndown the narrow street from the same point, we were led to the small\r\nopen court of the home, perhaps forty by eighty feet, upon which all\r\ndoors of the one-storied structures opened. It was dry and bare of\r\neverything green, but a row of very tall handsome trees, close\r\nrelatives of our cottonwood, with trunks thirty feet to the limbs,\r\nlooked down into the court over the roofs of the low thatched\r\nhouses. Here we met the father and grandfather of the man with the\r\ndrill, so that, with the boy carrying the baby in his arms, who had\r\nmet his father in the street gateway, there were four generations of\r\nmales at our conference. There were women and girls in the household\r\nbut custom requires them to remain in retirement on such occasions.\r\n\r\nA low narrow four-legged bench, not unlike our carpenter's sawhorse,\r\nfive feet long, was brought into the court as a seat, which our host\r\nand we occupied in common. We had been similarly received at the\r\nhome of Mrs. Wu in Chekiang province. On our right was the open\r\ndoorway to the kitchen in which stood, erect and straight, the tall\r\nspare figure of the patriarch of the household, his eyes still\r\nshining black but with hair and long thin straggling beard a uniform\r\ndull ashen gray. No Chinese hair, it seems, ever becomes white with\r\nage. He seemed to have assumed the duties of cook for while we were\r\nthere be lighted the fire in the kitchen and was busy, but was\r\nalways the final oracle on any matter of difference of opinion\r\nbetween the younger men regarding answers to questions. Two sleeping\r\napartments adjoining the kitchen, through whose wide kang beds the\r\nwaste heat from the cooking was conveyed, as described on page 142,\r\ncompleted this side of the court. On our left was the main street\r\ncompletely shut off by a solid earth wall as high as the eaves of\r\nthe house, while in front of us, adjoining the street, was the\r\nmanure midden, a compost pit six feet deep and some eight feet\r\nsquare. A low opening in the street wall permitted the pit to be\r\nemptied and to receive earth and stubble or refuse from the fields\r\nfor composting, Against the pit and without partition, but cut off\r\nfrom the court, was the home of the pigs, both under a common roof\r\ncontinuous with a closed structure joining with the sleeping\r\napartments, while behind us and along the alley-way by which we had\r\nentered were other dwelling and storage compartments. Thus was the\r\nlarge family of four generations provided with a peculiarly private\r\nopen court where they could work and come out for sun and air, both,\r\nfrom our standards, too meagerly provided in the houses.\r\n\r\nWe had come to learn more of the methods of fertilizing practiced by\r\nthese people. The manure midden was before us and the piles of earth\r\nbrought in from the fields, for use in the process, were stacked in\r\nthe street, where we had photographed them at the entrance, as seen\r\nin Fig. 135. There a father, with his pipe, and two boys stand at\r\nthe extreme left; beyond them is a large pile of earth brought into\r\nthe village and carefully stacked in the narrow street; on the other\r\nside of the street, at the corner of the first building, is a pile\r\nof partly fermented compost thrown from a pit behind the walls.\r\nFurther along in the street, on the same side, is a second large\r\nstack of soil where two boys are standing at either end and another\r\nlittle boy was in a near-by doorway. In front of the tree, on the\r\nleft side of the street, stands a third boy, near him a small donkey\r\nand still another boy. Beyond this boy stands a third large stack of\r\nsoil, while still beyond and across the way is another pile partly\r\ncomposted. Notwithstanding the cattle in the preceding illustration,\r\nthe donkey, the men, the boys, the three long high stacks of soil\r\nand the two piles of compost, the ten rods of narrow street\r\npossessed a width of available travelway and a cleanliness which\r\nwould appear impossible. Each farmer's household had its stack of\r\nsoil in the street, and in walking through the village we passed\r\ndozens of men turning and mixing the soil and compost, preparing it\r\nfor the field.\r\n\r\nThe compost pit in front of where we sat was two-thirds filled. In\r\nit had been placed all of the manure and waste of the household and\r\nstreet, all stubble and waste roughage from the field, all ashes not\r\nto be applied directly and some of the soil stacked in the street.\r\nSufficient water was added at intervals to keep the contents\r\ncompletely saturated and nearly submerged, the object being to\r\ncontrol the character of fermentation taking place.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of these compost pits is determined by the amount of\r\nland served, and the period of composting is made as long as\r\npossible, the aim being to have the fiber of all organic material\r\ncompletely broken down, the result being a product of the\r\nconsistency of mortar.\r\n\r\nWhen it is near the time for applying the compost to the field, or\r\nof feeding it to the crop, the fermented product is removed in\r\nwaterproof carrying baskets to the floor of the court, to the yard,\r\nsuch as seen in Fig. 126, or to the street, where it is spread to\r\ndry, to be mixed with fresh soil, more ashes, and repeatedly turned\r\nand stirred to bring about complete aeration and to hasten the\r\nprocesses of nitrification. During all of these treatments, whether\r\nin the compost pit or on the nitrification floor, the fermenting\r\norganic matter in contact with the soil is converting plant food\r\nelements into soluble plant food substances in the form of\r\npotassium, calcium and magnesium nitrates and soluble phosphates of\r\none or another form, perhaps of the same bases and possibly others\r\nof organic type. If there is time and favorable temperature and\r\nmoisture conditions for these fermentations to take place in the\r\nsoil of the field before the crop will need it, the compost may be\r\ncarried direct from the pit to the field and spread broadcast, to be\r\nplowed under. Otherwise the material is worked and reworked, with\r\nmore water added if necessary, until it becomes a rich complete\r\nfertilizer, allowed to become dry and then finely pulverized,\r\nsometimes using stone rollers drawn over it by cattle, the donkey or\r\nby hand. The large numbers of stacks of compost seen in the fields\r\nbetween Tsingtao and Tsinan were of this type and thus laboriously\r\nprepared in the villages and then transported to the fields, stacked\r\nand plastered to be ready for use at next planting.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of European history, before modern chemistry had\r\nprovided the cheaper and more expeditious method of producing\r\npotassium nitrate for the manufacture of gunpowder and fireworks,\r\nmuch land and effort were devoted to niter-farming which was no\r\nother than a specific application of this most ancient Chinese\r\npractice and probably imported from China. While it was not until\r\n1877 to 1879 that men of science came to know that the processes of\r\nnitrification, so indispensable to agriculture, are due to germ\r\nlife, in simple justice to the plain farmers of the world, to those\r\nwho through all the ages from Adam down, living close to Nature and\r\nworking through her and with her, have fed the world, it should be\r\nrecognized that there have been those among them who have grasped\r\nsuch essential, vital truths and have kept them alive in the\r\npractices of their day. And so we find it recorded in history as far\r\nback as 1686 that Judge Samuel Lewell copied upon the cover of his\r\njournal a practical man's recipe for making saltpeter beds, in which\r\nit was directed, among other things, that there should be added to\r\nit \"mother of petre\", meaning, in Judge Lewell's understanding,\r\nsimply soil from an old niter bed, but in the mind of the man who\r\napplied the maternity prefix,--mother,--it must have meant a vital\r\ngerm contained in the soil, carried with it, capable of reproducing\r\nits kind and of perpetuating its characteristic work, belonging to\r\nthe same category with the old, familiar, homely germ, \"mother\" of\r\nvinegar. So, too, with the old cheesemaker who grasped the\r\nconception which led to the long time practice of washing the walls\r\nof a new cheese factory with water from an old factory of the same\r\ntype, he must have been led by analogies of experience with things\r\nseen to realize that he was here dealing with a vital factor.\r\nHundreds, of course, have practiced empyrically, but some one\r\npreceded with the essential thought and we feel it is small credit\r\nto men of our time who, after ten or twenty years of technical\r\ntraining, having their attention directed to a something to be seen,\r\nand armed with compound microscopes which permit them to see with\r\nthe physical eye the \"mother of petre\", arrogate to themselves the\r\ndiscovery of a great truth. Much more modest would it be and much\r\nmore in the spirit of giving credit where credit is due to admit\r\nthat, after long doubting the existence of such an entity, we have\r\nsucceeded in confirming in fullness the truth of a great discovery\r\nwhich belongs to an unnamed genius of the past, or perhaps to a\r\nhundred of them who, working with life's processes and familiar with\r\nthem through long intimate association, saw in these invisible\r\nprocesses analogies that revealed to them the essential truth in\r\nsuch fullness as to enable them to build upon it an unfailing\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThere is another practice followed by the Chinese, connected with\r\nthe formation of nitrates in soils, which again emphasizes the\r\nnational trait of saving and turning to use any and every thing\r\nworth while. Our attention was called to this practice by Rev. A. E.\r\nEvans of Shunking, Szechwan province. It rests upon the tendency of\r\nthe earth floors of dwellings to become heavily charged with calcium\r\nnitrate through the natural processes of nitrification. Calcium\r\nnitrate being deliquescent absorbs moisture sufficiently to dissolve\r\nand make the floor wet and sticky. Dr. Evans' attention was drawn to\r\nthe wet floor in his own house, which be at first ascribed to\r\ninsufficient ventilation, but which be was unable to remedy by\r\nimproving that. The father of one of his assistants, whose business\r\nconsisted in purchasing the soil of such floors for producing\r\npotassium nitrate, used so much in China in the manufacture of\r\nfireworks and gunpowder, explained his difficulty and suggested the\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nThis man goes from house to house through the village, purchasing\r\nthe soil of floors which have thus become overcharged. He procures a\r\nsample, tests it and announces what he will pay for the surface two,\r\nthree or four inches, the price sometimes being as high as fifty\r\ncents for the privilege of removing the top layer of the floor,\r\nwhich the proprietors must replace. He leaches the soil removed, to\r\nrecover the calcium nitrate, and then pours the leachings through\r\nplant ashes containing potassium carbonate, for the purpose of\r\ntransforming the calcium nitrate into the potassium nitrate or\r\nsaltpeter. Dr. Evans learned that during the four months preceding\r\nour interview this man had produced sufficient potassium nitrate to\r\nbring his sales up to $80, Mexican. It was necessary for him to make\r\na two-days journey to market his product. In addition he paid a\r\nlicense fee of 80 cents per month. He must purchase his fuel ashes\r\nand hire the services of two men.\r\n\r\nWhen the nitrates which accumulate in the floors of dwellings are\r\nnot collected for this purpose the soil goes to the fields to be\r\nused directly as a fertilizer, or it may be worked into compost. In\r\nthe course of time the earth used in the village walls and even in\r\nthe construction of the houses may disintegrate so as to require\r\nremoval, but in all such cases, as with the earth brick used in the\r\nkangs, the value of the soil has improved for composting and is\r\ngenerally so used. This improvement of the soil will not appear\r\nstrange when it is stated that such materials are usually from the\r\nsubsoil, whose physical condition would improve when exposed to the\r\nweather, converting it in fact into an uncropped virgin soil.\r\n\r\nWe were unable to secure definite data as to the chemical\r\ncomposition of these composts and cannot say what amounts of\r\navailable plant food the Shantung farmers are annually returning to\r\ntheir fields. There can be little doubt, however, that the amounts\r\nare quite equal to those removed by the crops. The soils appeared\r\nwell supplied with organic matter and the color of the foliage and\r\nthe general aspect of crops indicated good feeding.\r\n\r\nThe family with whom we talked in the village place their usual\r\nyields of wheat at 420 catty of grain and 1000 catty of straw per\r\nmow,--their mow was four-thirds of the legal standard mow--the grain\r\nbeing worth 35 strings of cash and the straw 12 to 14 strings, a\r\nstring of cash being 40 cents, Mexican, at this time. Their yields\r\nof beans were such as to give them a return of 30 strings of cash\r\nfor the grain and 8 to 10 strings for the straw. Small millet\r\nusually yielded 450 catty of grain, worth 25 strings of cash, per\r\nmow, and 800 catty of straw worth 10 to 11 strings of cash; while\r\nthe yields of large millet they placed at 400 catty per mow, worth\r\n25 strings of cash, and 1000 catty of straw worth 12 to 14 strings\r\nof cash. Stating these amounts in bushels per acre and in our\r\ncurrency, the yield of wheat was 42 bushels of grain and 6000 pounds\r\nof straw per acre, having a cash value of $27.09 for the grain and\r\n$10.06 for the straw. The soy bean crop follows the wheat, giving an\r\nadditional return of $23.22 for the beans and $6.97 for the straw,\r\nmaking the gross earning for the two crops $67.34 per acre. The\r\nyield of small millet was 54 bushels of seed and 4800 pounds of\r\nstraw per acre, worth $27.09 and $8.12 for seed and straw\r\nrespectively, while the kaoliang or large millet gave a yield of 48\r\nbushels of grain and 6000 pounds of stalks per acre, worth $19.35\r\nfor the grain, and $10.06 for the straw.\r\n\r\nA crop of wheat like the one stated, if no part of the plant food\r\ncontained in the grain or straw were returned to the field, would\r\ndeplete the soil to the extent of about 90 pounds of nitrogen, 15\r\npounds of phosphorus and 65 pounds of potassium; and the crop of soy\r\nbeans, if it also were entirely removed, would reduce these three\r\nplant food elements in the soil to the extent of about 240 pounds of\r\nnitrogen, 33 pounds of phosphorus and 102 pounds of potassium, on\r\nthe basis of 45 bushels of beans and 5400 pounds of stems and leaves\r\nper acre, assuming that the beans added no nitrogen to the soil,\r\nwhich is of course not true. This household of farmers, therefore,\r\nin order to have maintained this producing power in their soil, have\r\nbeen compelled to return to it annually, in one form or another, not\r\nless than 48 pounds of phosphorus and 167 pounds of potassium per\r\nacre. The 330 pounds of nitrogen they would have to return in the\r\nform of organic matter or accumulate it from the atmosphere, through\r\nthe instrumentality of their soy bean crop or some other legume. It\r\nhas already been stated that they do add more than 5000 to 7000\r\npounds of dry compost, which, repeated for a second crop, would make\r\nan annual application of five to seven tons of dry compost per acre\r\nannually. They do use, in addition to this compost, large amounts of\r\nbean and peanut cake, which carry all of the plant food elements\r\nderived from the soil which are contained in the beans and the\r\npeanuts. If the vines are fed, or if the stems of the beaus are\r\nburned for fuel, most of the plant food elements in these will be\r\nreturned to the field, and they have doubtless learned how to\r\ncompletely restore the plant food elements removed by their crops,\r\nand persistently do so.\r\n\r\nThe roads made by the Germans in the vicinity of Tsingtao enabled us\r\nto travel by ricksha into the adjoining country, and on one such\r\ntrip we visited a village mill for grinding soy beans and peanuts in\r\nthe manufacture of oil, and Fig. 136 shows the stone roller, four\r\nfeet in diameter and two feet thick, which is revolved about a\r\nvertical axis on a circular stone plate, drawn by a donkey, crushing\r\nthe kernels partly by its weight and partly by a twisting motion,\r\nfor the arm upon which the roller revolves is very short. After the\r\nmeal had been ground the oil was expressed in essentially the same\r\nway as that described for the cotton seed, but the bean and peanut\r\ncakes are made much larger than the cotton seed cakes, about\r\neighteen inches in diameter and three to four inches thick. Two of\r\nthese cakes are seen in Fig. 137, standing on edge outside the mill\r\nin an orderly clean court. It is in this form that bean cake is\r\nexported in large quantities to different parts of China, and to\r\nJapan in recent years, for use as fertilizer, and very recently it\r\nis being shipped to Europe for both stock food and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nNowhere in this province, nor further north, did we see the large\r\nterra cotta, receptacles so extensively used in the south for\r\nstoring human excreta. In these dryer climates some method of\r\ndesiccation is practiced and we found the gardeners in the vicinity\r\nof Tsingtao with quantities of the fertilizer stacked under matting\r\nshelters in the desiccated condition, this being finely pulverized\r\nin one or another way before it was applied. The next illustration,\r\nFig. 138, shows one of these piles being fitted for the garden, its\r\nthatched shelter standing behind the grandfather of a household. His\r\ngrandson was carrying the prepared fertilizer to the garden area\r\nseen in Fig. 139, where the father was working it into the soil. The\r\ngreatest pains is taken, both in reducing the product to a fine\r\npowder and in spreading and incorporating it with the soil, for one\r\nof their maxims of soil management is to make each square foot of\r\nfield or garden the equal of every other in its power to produce. In\r\nthis manner each little holding is made to yield the highest returns\r\npossible under the conditions the husbandman is able to control.\r\n\r\nFrom one portion of the area being fitted, a crop of artemisia had\r\nbeen harvested, giving a gross return at the rate of $73.19 per\r\nacre, and from another leeks had been taken, bringing a gross return\r\nof $43.86 per acre. Chinese celery was the crop for which the ground\r\nwas being fitted.\r\n\r\nThe application of soil as a fertilizer to the fields of China,\r\nwhether derived from the subsoil or from the silts and organic\r\nmatter of canals and rivers, must have played an important part in\r\nthe permanency of agriculture in the Far East, for all such\r\nadditions have been positive accretions to the effective soil,\r\nincreasing its depth and carrying to it all plant food elements. If\r\nnot more than one-half of the weight of compost applied to the\r\nfields of Shantung is highly fertilized soil, the rates of\r\napplication observed would, in a thousand years, add more than two\r\nmillion pounds per acre, and this represents about the volume of\r\nsoil we turn with the plow in our ordinary tillage operations, and\r\nthis amount of good soil may carry more than 6000 pounds of\r\nnitrogen, 2000 pounds of phosphorus and more than 60,000 pounds of\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\nWhen we left our hotel by ricksha for the steamer, returning to\r\nShanghai, we soon observed a boy of thirteen or fourteen years\r\napparently following, sometimes a little ahead, sometimes behind,\r\nusually keeping the sidewalk but slackening his pace whenever the\r\nricksha man came to a walk. It was a full mile to the wharf. The boy\r\nevidently knew the sailing schedule and judged by the valise in\r\nfront, that we were to take the out-going steamer and that he might\r\npossibly earn two cents, Mexican, the usual fee for taking a valise\r\naboard the steamer. Twenty men at the wharf might be waiting for the\r\njob, but he was taking the chance with the mile down and back thrown\r\nin, and all for less than one cent in our currency, equivalent at\r\nthe time to about twenty \"cash\". As we neared the steamer the lad\r\nclosed up behind but strong and eager men were watching. Twice he\r\nwas roughly thrust aside and before the ricksha stopped a man of\r\nstalwart frame seized the valise and, had we not observed the boy\r\nthus unobtrusively entering the competition, he would have had only\r\nhis trouble for his pains. Thus intense was the struggle here for\r\nexistence and thus did a mere lad put himself effectively into it.\r\nTrue to breeding and example he had spared no labor to win and was\r\nsurprised but grateful to receive more than he had expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nORIENTALS CROWD BOTH TIME AND SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTime is a function of every life process, as it is of every\r\nphysical, chemical and mental reaction, and the husbandman is\r\ncompelled to shape his operations so as to conform with the time\r\nrequirements of his crops. The oriental farmer is a time economizer\r\nbeyond any other. He utilizes the first and last minute and all that\r\nare between. The foreigner accuses the Chinaman of being always\r\n\"long on time\", never in a fret, never in a hurry. And why should he\r\nbe when he leads time by the forelock, and uses all there is?\r\n\r\nThe customs and practices of these Farthest East people regarding\r\ntheir manufacture of fertilizers in the form of earth composts for\r\ntheir fields, and their use of altered subsoils which have served in\r\ntheir kangs, village walls and dwellings, are all instances where\r\nthey profoundly shorten the time required in the field to affect the\r\nnecessary chemical, physical and biological reactions which produce\r\nfrom them plant food substances. Not only do they thus increase\r\ntheir time assets, but they add, in effect, to their land area by\r\nproducing these changes outside their fields, at the same time\r\ngiving their crops the immediately active soil products.\r\n\r\nTheir compost practices have been of the greatest consequence to\r\nthem, both in their extremely wet, rice-culture methods, and in\r\ntheir \"dry-farming\" practices, where the soil moisture is too scanty\r\nduring long periods to permit rapid fermentation under field\r\nconditions. Western agriculturalists have not sufficiently\r\nappreciated the fact that the most rapid growth of plant food\r\nsubstances in the soil cannot occur at the same time and place with\r\nthe most rapid crop increase, because both processes draw upon the\r\navailable soil moisture, soil air and soluble potassium, calcium,\r\nphosphorus and nitrogen compounds. Whether this fundamental\r\nprinciple of practical agriculture is written in their literature or\r\nnot it is most indelibly fixed in their practice. If we and they can\r\nperpetuate the essentials of this practice at a large saving of\r\nhuman effort, or perpetually secure the final result in some more\r\nexpeditious and less laborious way, most important progress will\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nWhen we went north to the Shantung province the Kiangsu and Chekiang\r\nfarmers were engaged in another of their time saving practices, also\r\ninvolving a large amount of human labor. This was the planting of\r\ncotton in wheat fields before the wheat was quite ready to harvest.\r\nIn the sections of these two provinces which we visited most of the\r\nwheat and barley were sowed broadcast on narrow raised lands, some\r\nfive feet wide, with furrows between, after the manner seen in Fig.\r\n140, showing a reservoir in the immediate foreground, on whose bank\r\nis installed one of the four-man foot-power irrigation pumps in use\r\nto flood the nursery rice bed close by on the right. The narrow\r\nlands of broadcasted wheat extend back from the reservoir toward the\r\nfarmsteads which dot the landscape, and on the left stands one of\r\nthe pump shelters near the canal bank.\r\n\r\nTo save time, or lengthen the growing season of the cotton which was\r\nto follow, this seed was sown broadcast among the grain on the\r\nsurface, some ten to fifteen days before the wheat would be\r\nharvested. To cover the seed the soil in the furrows between the\r\nbeds had been spaded loose to a depth of four or five inches, finely\r\npulverized, and then with a spade was evenly scattered over the bed,\r\nletting it sift down among the grain, covering the seed. This loose\r\nearth, so applied, acts as a mulch to conserve the capillary\r\nmoisture, permitting the soil to become sufficiently damp to\r\ngerminate the seed before the wheat is harvested. The next\r\nillustration, Fig. 141, is a closer view with our interpreter\r\nstanding in another field of wheat in which cotton was being sowed\r\nApril 22nd in the manner described, and yet the stand of grain was\r\nvery close and shoulder high, making it not an easy task either to\r\nsow the seed or to scatter sufficient soil to cover it.\r\n\r\nWhen we had returned from Shantung this piece of grain had been\r\nharvested, giving a yield of 95.6 bushels of wheat and 3.5 tons of\r\nstraw per acre, computed from the statement of the owner that 400\r\ncatty of grain and 500 catty of straw had been taken from the beds\r\nmeasuring 4050 square feet. On the morning of May 29th the\r\nphotograph for Fig. 142 was taken, showing the same area after the\r\nwheat had been harvested and the cotton was up, the young plants\r\nshowing slightly through the short stubble. These beds had already\r\nbeen once treated with liquid fertilizer. A little later the plants\r\nwould be hoed and thinned to a stand of about one plant per each\r\nsquare foot of surface. There were thirty-seven days between the\r\ntaking of the two photographs, and certainly thirty days had been\r\nadded to the cotton crop by this method of planting, over what would\r\nhave been available if the grain had been first harvested and the\r\nfield fitted before planting, It will be observed that the cotton\r\nfollows the wheat without plowing, but the soil was deep, naturally\r\nopen, and a layer of nearly two inches of loose earth had been\r\nplaced over the seed at the time of planting. Besides, the ground\r\nwould be deeply worked with the two or four tined hoe, at the time\r\nof thinning.\r\n\r\nStarting cotton in the wheat in the manner described is but a\r\nspecial case of a general practice widely in vogue. The growing of\r\nmultiple crops is the rule throughout these countries wherever the\r\nclimate permits. Sometimes as many as three crops occupy the same\r\nfield in recurrent rows, but of different dates of planting and in\r\ndifferent stages of maturity. Reference has been made to the\r\noverlapping and alternation of cucumbers with greens. The general\r\npractice of planting nearly all crops in rows lends itself readily\r\nto systems of multiple cropping, and these to the fullest possible\r\nutilization of every minute of the growing season and of the time of\r\nthe family in caring for the crops. In the field, Fig. 143, a crop\r\nof winter wheat was nearing maturity, a crop of windsor beans was\r\nabout two-thirds grown, and cotton had just been planted, April\r\n22nd. This field had been thrown into ridges some five feet wide\r\nwith a twelve inch furrow between them. Two rows of wheat eight\r\ninches wide, planted two feet between centers occupied the crest of\r\nthe ridge, leaving a strip sixteen inches wide, seen in the upper\r\nsection, (1) for tillage, (2) then fertilization and (3) finally the\r\nrow of cotton planted just before the wheat was harvested. Against\r\nthe furrow on each side was a row of windsor beans, seen in the\r\nlower view, hiding the furrow, which was matured some time after the\r\nwheat was harvested and before the cotton was very large. A late\r\nfall crop sometimes follows the windsor beans after a period of\r\ntillage and fertilization, making four in one year. With such a\r\nsuccession fertilization for each crop, and an abundance of soil\r\nmoisture are required to give the largest returns from the soil.\r\n\r\nIn another plan winter wheat or barley may grow side by side with a\r\ngreen crop, such as the \"Chinese clover\" (Medicago denticulata,\r\nWilld.) for soil fertilizer, as was the case in Fig. 144, to be\r\nturned under and fertilize for a crop of cotton planted in rows on\r\neither side of a crop of barley. After the barley had been harvested\r\nthe ground it occupied would be tilled and further fertilized, and\r\nwhen the cotton was nearing maturity a crop of rape might be grown,\r\nfrom which \"salted cabbage\" would be prepared for winter use.\r\n\r\nMultiple crops are grown as far north in Chihli as Tientsin and\r\nPeking, these being oftenest wheat, maize, large and small millet\r\nand soy beans, and this, too, where the soil is less fertile and\r\nwhere the annual rainfall is only about twenty-five inches, the\r\nrainy season beginning in late June or early July, and Fig. 145\r\nshows one of these fields as it appeared June 14th, where two rows\r\nof wheat and two of large millet were planted in alternating pairs,\r\nthe rows being about twenty-eight inches apart. The wheat was ready\r\nto harvest but the straw was unusually short because growing on a\r\nlight sandy loam in a season of exceptional drought, but little more\r\nthan two inches of rain having fallen after January 1st of that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe piles of pulverized dry-earth compost seen between the rows had\r\nbeen brought for use on the ground occupied by the wheat when that\r\nwas removed. The wheat would be pulled, tied in bundles, taken to\r\nthe village and the roots cut off, for making compost, as in Fig.\r\n146, which shows the family engaged in cutting the roots from the\r\nsmall bundles of wheat, using a long straight knife blade, fixed at\r\none end, and thrust downward upon the bundle with lever pressure.\r\nThese roots, if not used as fuel, would be transferred to the\r\ncompost pit in the enclosure seen in Fig. 147, whose walls were\r\nbuilt of earth brick. Here, with any other waste litter, manure or\r\nashes, they would be permitted to decay under water until the fiber\r\nhad been destroyed, thus permitting it to be incorporated with soil\r\nand applied to the fields, rich in soluble plant food and in a\r\ncondition which would not interfere with the capillary movement of\r\nsoil moisture, the work going on outside the field where the changes\r\ncould occur unimpeded and without interfering with the growth of\r\ncrops on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn this system of combined intertillage and multiple cropping the\r\noriental farmer thus takes advantage of whatever good may result\r\nfrom rotation or succession of crops, whether these be physical,\r\nvito-chemical or biological. If plants are mutually helpful through\r\nclose association of their root systems in the soil, as some believe\r\nmay be the case, this growing of different species in close\r\njuxtaposition would seem to provide the opportunity, but the other\r\nadvantages which have been pointed out are so evident and so\r\nimportant that they, rather than this, have doubtless led to the\r\npractice of growing different crops in close recurrent rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nRICE CULTURE IN THE ORIENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basal food crop of the people of China, Korea and Japan is rice,\r\nand the mean consumption in Japan, for the five years ending 1906,\r\nper capita and per annum, was 302 pounds. Of Japan's 175,428 square\r\nmiles she devoted, in 1906, 12,856 to the rice crop. Her average\r\nyield of water rice on 12,534 square miles exceeded 33 bushels per\r\nacre, and the dry land rice averaged 18 bushels per acre on 321\r\nsquare miles. In the Hokkaido, as far north as northern Illinois,\r\nJapan harvested 1,780,000 bushels of water rice from 53,000 acres.\r\n\r\nIn Szechwan province, China, Consul-General Hosie places the yield\r\nof water rice on the plains land at 44 bushels per acre, and that of\r\nthe dry land rice at 22 bushels. Data given us in China show an\r\naverage yield of 42 bushels of water rice per acre, while the\r\naverage yield of wheat was 25 bushels per acre, the normal yield in\r\nJapan being about 17 bushels.\r\n\r\nIf the rice eaten per capita in China proper and Korea is equal to\r\nthat in Japan the annual consumption for the three nations, using\r\nthe round number 300 pounds per capita per annum, would be:\r\n\r\n\r\n             Population.

In Formosa and in southern China large areas produce two\r\ncrops each year. At the large mean yield used in the computation the\r\nestimated acreage of rice in China proper amounts to 5.93 per cent\r\nof her total area and this is 7433 square miles greater than the\r\nacreage of wheat in the United States in 1907. Our yield of wheat,\r\nhowever, was but 19,000,000 tons, while China's output of rice was\r\ncertainly double and probably three times this amount from nearly\r\nthe same acreage of land; and notwithstanding this large production\r\nper acre, more than fifty per cent, possibly as high as seventy-five\r\nper cent, of the same land matures at least one other crop the same\r\nyear, and much of this may be wheat or barley, both chiefly consumed\r\nas human food.\r\n\r\nHad the Mongolian races spread to and developed in North America\r\ninstead of, or as well as, in eastern Asia, there might have been a\r\nGrand Canal, something as suggested in Fig. 148, from the Rio Grande\r\nto the mouth of the Ohio river and from the Mississippi to\r\nChesapeake Bay, constituting more than two thousand miles of inland\r\nwater-way, serving commerce, holding up and redistributing both the\r\nrun-off water and the wasting fertility of soil erosion, spreading\r\nthem over 200,000 square miles of thoroughly canalized coastal\r\nplains, so many of which are now impoverished lands, made so by the\r\nintolerable waste of a vaunted civilization. And who shall venture\r\nto enumerate the increase in the tonnage of sugar, bales of cotton,\r\nsacks of rice, boxes of oranges, baskets of peaches, and in the\r\ntrainloads of cabbage, tomatoes and celery such husbanding would\r\nmake possible through all time; or number the increased millions\r\nthese could feed and clothe? We may prohibit the exportation of our\r\nphosphorus, grind our limestone, and apply them to our fields, but\r\nthis alone is only temporizing with the future. The more we produce,\r\nthe more numerous our millions, the faster must present practices\r\nspeed the waste to the sea, from whence neither money nor prayer can\r\ncall them back.\r\n\r\nIf the United States is to endure; if we shall project our history\r\neven through four or five thousand years as the Mongolian nations\r\nhave done, and if that history shall be written in continuous peace,\r\nfree from periods of wide-spread famine or pestilence, this nation\r\nmust orient itself; it must square its practices with a conservation\r\nof resources which can make endurance possible. Intensifying\r\ncultural methods but intensifies the digestion, assimilation and\r\nexhaustion of the surface soil, from which life springs. Multiple\r\ncropping, closer stands on the ground and stronger growth, all mean\r\nthe transpiration of much more water per acre through the crops, and\r\nthis can only be rendered possible through a redistribution of the\r\nrun-off and the adoption of irrigation practices in humid climates\r\nwhere water exists in abundance. Sooner or later we must adopt a\r\nnational policy which shall more completely conserve our water\r\nresources, utilizing them not only for power and transportation, but\r\nprimarily for the maintenance of soil fertility and greater crop\r\nproduction through supplemental irrigation, and all these great\r\nnational interests should be considered collectively, broadly, and\r\nwith a view to the fullest and best possible coordination. China,\r\nKorea and Japan long ago struck the keynote of permanent agriculture\r\nbut the time has now come when they can and will make great\r\nimprovements, and it remains for us and other nations to profit by\r\ntheir experience, to adopt and adapt what is good in their practice\r\nand help in a world movement for the introduction of new and\r\nimproved methods.\r\n\r\nIn selecting rice as their staple crop; in developing and\r\nmaintaining their systems of combined irrigation and drainage,\r\nnotwithstanding they have a large summer rainfall; in their systems\r\nof multiple cropping; in their extensive and persistent use of\r\nlegumes; in their rotations for green manure to maintain the humus\r\nof their soils and for composting; and in the almost religious\r\nfidelity with which they have returned to their fields every form of\r\nwaste which can replace plant food removed by the crops, these\r\nnations have demonstrated a grasp of essentials and of fundamental\r\nprinciples which may well cause western nations to pause and\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\nWhile this country need not and could not now adopt their laborious\r\nmethods of rice culture, and while, let us hope, those who come\r\nafter us may never be compelled to do so, it is nevertheless quite\r\nworth while to study, for the sake of the principles involved, the\r\npractices they have been led to adopt.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the acreage of land in rice in these countries but\r\nlittle, relatively, is of the dry land type, and the fields upon\r\nwhich most of the rice grows have all been graded to a water level\r\nand surrounded by low, narrow raised rims, such as may be seen in\r\nFig. 149 and in Fig. 150, where three men are at work on their\r\nfoot-power pump, flooding fields preparatory to transplanting the\r\nrice. If the country was not level then the slopes have been graded\r\ninto horizontal terraces varying in size according to the steepness\r\nof the areas in which they were cut. We saw these often no larger\r\nthan the floor of a small room, and Professor Ross informed me that\r\nhe walked past those in the interior of China no larger than a\r\ndining table and that he saw one bearing its crop of rice,\r\nsurrounded by its rim and holding water, yet barely larger than a\r\ngood napkin. The average area of the paddy field in Japan is\r\nofficially reported at 1.14 se, or an area of but 31 by 40 feet.\r\nExcluding Hokkaido, Formosa and Karafuto, fifty-three per cent of\r\nthe irrigated rice lands in Japan are in allotments smaller than\r\none-eighth of an acre, and seventy-four per cent of other cultivated\r\nlands are held in areas less than one-fourth of an acre, and each of\r\nthese may be further subdivided. The next two illustrations, Figs.\r\n151 and 152, give a good idea both of the small size of the rice\r\nfields and of the terracing which has been done to secure the water\r\nlevel basins. The house standing near the center of Fig. 151 is a\r\ngood scale for judging both the size of the paddies and the slope of\r\nthe valley. The distance between the rows of rice is scarcely one\r\nfoot, hence counting these in the foreground may serve as another\r\nmeasure. There are more than twenty little fields shown in this\r\nengraving in front of the house and reaching but half way to it, and\r\nthe house was less than five hundred feet from the camera.\r\n\r\nThere are more than eleven thousand square miles of fields thus\r\ngraded in the three main islands of Japan, each provided with rims,\r\nwith water supply and drainage channels, all carefully kept in the\r\nbest of repair. The more level areas, too, in each of the three\r\ncountries, have been similarly thrown into water level basins,\r\ncomparatively few of which cover large areas, because nearly always\r\nthe holdings are small. All of the earth excavated from the canals\r\nand drainage channels has been leveled over the fields unless needed\r\nfor levees or dikes, so that the original labor of construction,\r\nadded to that of maintenance, makes a total far beyond our\r\ncomprehension and nearly all of it is the product of human effort.\r\n\r\nThe laying out and shaping of so many fields into these level basins\r\nbrings to the three nations an enormous aggregate annual asset, a\r\nlarge proportion of which western nations are not yet utilizing. The\r\ngreatest gain comes from the unfailing higher yields made possible\r\nby providing an abundance of water through which more plant food can\r\nbe utilized, thus providing higher average yields. The waters used,\r\ncoming as they do largely from the uncultivated hills and mountain\r\nlands, carrying both dissolved and suspended matters, make positive\r\nannual additions of dissolved limestone and plant food elements to\r\nthe fields which in the aggregate have been very large, through the\r\npersistent repetitions which have prevailed for centuries. If the\r\nyearly application of such water to the rice fields is but sixteen\r\ninches, and this has the average composition quoted by Merrill for\r\nrivers of North America, taking into account neither suspended\r\nmatter nor the absorption of potassium and phosphorus by it, each\r\nten thousand square miles would receive, dissolved in the water,\r\nsubstances containing some 1,400 tons of phosphorus; 23,000 tons of\r\npotassium; 27,000 tons of nitrogen; and 48,000 tons of sulphur. In\r\naddition, there are brought to the fields some 216,000 tons of\r\ndissolved organic matter and a still larger weight of dissolved\r\nlimestone, so necessary in neutralizing the acidity of soils,\r\namounting to 1,221,000 tons; and such savings have been maintained\r\nin China, Korea and Japan on more than five, and possibly more than\r\nnine, times the ten thousand square miles, through centuries. The\r\nphosphorus thus turned upon ninety thousand square miles would\r\naggregate nearly thirteen million tons in a thousand years, which is\r\nless than the time the practice has been maintained, and is more\r\nphosphorus than would be carried in the entire rock phosphate thus\r\nfar mined in the United States, were it all seventy-five per cent\r\npure.\r\n\r\nThe canalization of fifty thousand square miles of our Gulf and\r\nAtlantic coastal plain, and the utilization on the fields of the\r\nsilts and organic matter, together with the water, would mean\r\nturning to account a vast tonnage of plant food which is now wasting\r\ninto the sea, and a correspondingly great increase of crop yield.\r\nThere ought, and it would seem there must some time be provided a\r\nway for sending to the sandy plains of Florida, and to the sandy\r\nlands between there and the Mississippi, large volumes of the rich\r\nsilt and organic matter from this and other rivers, aside from that\r\nwhich should be applied systematically to building above flood plain\r\nthe lands of the delta which are subject to overflow or are too low\r\nto permit adequate drainage.\r\n\r\nIt may appear to some that the application of such large volumes of\r\nwater to fields, especially in countries of heavy rainfall, must\r\nresult in great loss of plant food through leaching and surface\r\ndrainage. But under the remarkable practices of these three nations\r\nthis is certainly not the case and it is highly important that our\r\npeople should understand and appreciate the principles which\r\nunderlie the practices they have almost uniformly adopted on the\r\nareas devoted to rice irrigation. In the first place, their paddy\r\nfields are under-drained so that most of the water either leaves the\r\nsoil through the crop, by surface evaporation, or it percolates\r\nthrough the subsoil into shallow drains. When water is passed\r\ndirectly from one rice paddy to another it is usually permitted some\r\ntime after fertilization, when both soil and crop have had time to\r\nappropriate or fix the soluble plant food substances. Besides this,\r\nwater is not turned upon the fields until the time for transplanting\r\nthe rice, when the plants are already provided with a strong root\r\nsystem and are capable of at once appropriating any soluble plant\r\nfood which may develop about their roots or be carried downward over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the drains are of the surface type and but eighteen inches\r\nto three feet in depth, they are sufficiently numerous and close so\r\nthat, although the soil is continuously nearly filled with water,\r\nthere is a steady percolation of the fresh, fully aerated water\r\ncarrying an abundance of oxygen into the soil to meet the needs of\r\nthe roots, so that watermelons, egg plants, musk melons and taro are\r\ngrown in the rotations on the small paddies among the irrigated rice\r\nafter the manner seen in the illustrations. In Fig. 153 each double\r\nrow of egg plants is separated from the next by a narrow shallow\r\ntrench which connects with a head drain and in which water was\r\nstanding within fourteen inches of the surface. The same was true in\r\nthe case of the watermelons seen in Fig. 154, where the vines are\r\ngrowing on a thick layer of straw mulch which holds them from the\r\nmoist soil and acts to conserve water by diminishing evaporation\r\nand, through decay from the summer rains and leaching, serves as\r\nfertilizer for the crop. In Fig. 155 the view is along a pathway\r\nseparating two head ditches between areas in watermelons and taro,\r\ncarrying the drainage waters from the several furrows into the main\r\nditches. Although the soil appeared wet the plants were vigorous and\r\nhealthy, seeming in no way to suffer from insufficient drainage.\r\n\r\nThese people have, therefore, given effective attention to the\r\nmatter of drainage as well as irrigation and are looking after\r\npossible losses of plant food, as well as ways of supplying it. It\r\nis not alone where rice is grown that cultural methods are made to\r\nconserve soluble plant food and to reduce its loss from the field,\r\nfor very often, where flooding is not practiced, small fields and\r\nbeds, made quite level, are surrounded by low raised borders which\r\npermit not only the whole of any rain to be retained upon the field\r\nwhen so desired, but it is completely distributed over it, thus\r\ncausing the whole soil to be uniformly charged with moisture and\r\npreventing washing from one portion of the field to another. Such\r\nprovisions are shown in Figs. 133 and 138.\r\n\r\nExtensive as is the acreage of irrigated rice in China, Korea and\r\nJapan, nearly every spear is transplanted; the largest and best crop\r\npossible, rather than the least labor and trouble, as is so often\r\nthe case with us, determining their methods and practices. We first\r\nsaw the fitting of the rice nursery beds at Canton and again near\r\nKashing in Chekiang province on the farm of Mrs. Wu, whose homestead\r\nis seen in Fig. 156. She had come with her husband from Ningpo after\r\nthe ravages of the Taiping rebellion had swept from two provinces\r\nalone twenty millions of people and settled on a small area of then\r\nvacated land. As they prospered they added to their holding by\r\npurchase until about twenty-five acres were acquired, an area about\r\nten times that possessed by the usual prosperous family in China.\r\nThe widow was managing her place, one of her sons, although married,\r\nbeing still in school, the daughter-in-law living with her\r\nmother-in-law and helping in the home. Her field help during the\r\nsummer consisted of seven laborers and she kept four cows for the\r\nplowing and pumping of water for irrigation. The wages of the men\r\nwere at the rate of $24, Mexican, for five summer months, together\r\nwith their meals which were four each day. The cash outlay for the\r\nseven men was thus $14.45 of our currency per month. Ten years\r\nbefore, such labor had been $30 per year, as compared with $50 at\r\nthe time of our visit, or $12.90 and $21.50 of our currency,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nHer usual yields of rice were two piculs per mow, or twenty-six and\r\ntwo-thirds bushels per acre, and a wheat crop yielding half this\r\namount, or some other, was taken from part of the land the same\r\nseason, one fertilization answering for the two crops. She stated\r\nthat her annual expense for fertilizers purchased was usually about\r\n$60, or $25.80 of our currency. The homestead of Mrs. Wu, Fig. 156,\r\nconsists of a compound in the form of a large quadrangle surrounding\r\na court closed on the south by a solid wall eight feet high. The\r\nstructure is of earth brick with the roof thatched with rice straw.\r\n\r\nOur first visit here was April 19th. The nursery rice beds had been\r\nplanted four days, sowing seed at the rate of twenty bushels per\r\nacre. The soil had been very carefully prepared and highly\r\nfertilized, the last treatment being a dressing of plant ashes so\r\nincompletely burned as to leave the surface coal black. The seed,\r\nscattered directly upon the surface, almost completely covered it\r\nand had been gently beaten barely into the dressing of ashes, using\r\na wide, flat-bottom basket for the purpose. Each evening, if the\r\nnight was likely to be cool, water was pumped over the bed, to be\r\nwithdrawn the next day, if warm and sunny, permitting the warmth to\r\nbe absorbed by the black surface, and a fresh supply of air to be\r\ndrawn into the soil.\r\n\r\nNearly a month later, May 14th, a second visit was made to this farm\r\nand one of the nursery beds of rice, as it then appeared, is seen in\r\nFig. 159, the plants being about eight inches high and nearing the\r\nstage for transplanting. The field beyond the bed had already been\r\npartly flooded and plowed, turning under \"Chinese clover\" to ferment\r\nas green manure, preparatory for the rice transplanting. On the\r\nopposite side of the bed and in front of the residence, Fig. 156,\r\nflooding was in progress in the furrows between the ridges formed\r\nafter the previous crop of rice was harvested and upon which the\r\ncrop of clover for green manure was grown. Immediately at one end of\r\nthe two series of nursery beds, one of which is seen in Fig. 159,\r\nwas the pumping plant seen in Fig. 157, under a thatched shelter,\r\nwith its two pumps installed at the end of a water channel leading\r\nfrom the canal. One of these wooden pump powers, with the\r\nblindfolded cow attached, is reproduced in Fig. 158 and just beyond\r\nthe animal's head may be seen the long handle dipper to which\r\nreference has been made, used for collecting excreta.\r\n\r\nMore than a month is saved for maturing and harvesting winter and\r\nearly spring crops, or in fitting the fields for rice, by this\r\nplanting in nursery beds. The irrigation period for most of the land\r\nis cut short a like amount, saving in both water and time. It is\r\ncheaper and easier to highly fertilize and prepare a small area for\r\nthe nursery, while at the same time much stronger and more uniform\r\nplants are secured than would be possible by sowing in the field.\r\nThe labor of weeding and caring for the plants in the nursery is far\r\nless than would be required in the field. It would be practically\r\nimpossible to fit the entire rice areas as early in the season as\r\nthe nursery beds are fitted, for the green manure is not yet grown\r\nand time is required for composting or for decaying, if plowed under\r\ndirectly. The rice plants in the nursery are carried to a stage when\r\nthey are strong feeders and when set into the newly prepared,\r\nfertilized, clean soil of the field they are ready to feed strongly\r\nunder these most favorable conditions Both time and strength of\r\nplant are thus gained and these people are following what would\r\nappear to be the best possible practices under their condition of\r\nsmall holdings and dense population.\r\n\r\nWith our broad fields, our machinery and few people, their system\r\nappears to us crude and impossible, but cut our holdings to the size\r\nof theirs and the same stroke makes our machinery, even our plows,\r\nstill more impossible, and so the more one studies the environment\r\nof these people, thus far unavoidable, their numbers, what they have\r\ndone and are doing, against what odds they have succeeded, the more\r\ndifficult it becomes to see what course might have been better.\r\n\r\nHow full with work is the month which precedes the transplanting of\r\nrice has been pointed out,--the making of the compost fertilizer;\r\nharvesting the wheat, rape and beans; distributing the compost over\r\nthe fields, and their flooding and plowing. In Fig. 160 one of these\r\nfields is seen plowed, smoothed and nearly ready for the plants. The\r\nturned soil had been thoroughly pulverized, leveled and worked to\r\nthe consistency of mortar, on the larger fields with one or another\r\nsort of harrow, as seen in Figs. 160 and 161. This thorough puddling\r\nof the soil permits the plants to be quickly set and provides\r\nconditions which ensure immediate perfect contact for the roots.\r\n\r\nWhen the fields are ready women repair to the nurseries with their\r\nlow four-legged bamboo stools, to pull the rice plants, carefully\r\nrinsing the soil from the roots, and then tie them into bundles of a\r\nsize easily handled in transplanting, which are then distributed in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe work of transplanting may be done by groups of families changing\r\nwork, a considerable number of them laboring together after the\r\nmanner seen in Fig. 163, made from four snap shots taken from the\r\nsame point at intervals of fifteen minutes. Long cords were\r\nstretched in the rice field six feet apart and each of the seven men\r\nwas setting six rows of rice one foot apart, six to eight plants in\r\na hill, and the hills eight or nine inches apart in the row. The,\r\nbundle was held in one hand and deftly, with the other, the desired\r\nnumber of plants were selected with the fingers at the roots,\r\nseparated from the rest and, with a single thrust, set in place in\r\nthe row. There was no packing of earth about the roots, each hill\r\nbeing set with a single motion, which followed one another in quick\r\nsuccession, completing one cross row of six hills after another. The\r\nmen move backward across the field, completing one entire section,\r\ntossing the unused plants into the unset field. Then reset the lines\r\nto cover another section. We were told that the usual day's work of\r\ntransplanting, for a man under these conditions, after the field is\r\nfitted and the plants are brought to him, is two mow or one-third of\r\nan acre. The seven men in this group would thus set two and a third\r\nacres per day and, at the wage Mrs. Wu was paying, the cash outlay,\r\nif the help was hired, would be nearly 21 cents per acre. This is\r\nmore cheaply than we are able to set cabbage and tobacco plants with\r\nour best machine methods. In Japan, as seen in Figs. 164 and 165,\r\nthe women participate in the work of setting the plants more than in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nAfter the rice has been transplanted its care, unlike that of our\r\nwheat crop, does not cease. It must be hoed, fertilized and watered.\r\nTo facilitate the watering all fields have been leveled, canals,\r\nditches and drains provided, and to aid in fertilizing and hoeing,\r\nthe setting has been in rows and in hills in the row.\r\n\r\nThe first working of the rice fields after the transplanting, as we\r\nsaw it in Japan, consisted in spading between the hills with a\r\nfour-tined hoe, apparently more for loosening the soil and aeration\r\nthan for killing weeds. After this treatment the field was gone over\r\nagain in the manner seen in Fig. 166, where the man is using his\r\nbare hands to smooth and level the stirred soil, taking care to\r\neradicate every weed, burying them beneath the mud, and to\r\nstraighten each hill of rice as it is passed. Sometimes the fingers\r\nare armed with bamboo claws to facilitate the weeding. Machinery in\r\nthe form of revolving hand cultivators is recently coming into use\r\nin Japan, and two men using these are seen in Fig. 14. In these\r\ncultivators the teeth are mounted on an axle so as to revolve as the\r\ncultivator is pushed along the row.\r\n\r\nFertilization for the rice crop receives the greatest attention\r\neverywhere by these three nations and in no direction more than in\r\nmaintaining the store of organic matter in the soil. The pink\r\nclover, to which reference has been made, Figs. 99 and 100, is\r\nextensively sowed after a crop of rice is harvested in the fall and\r\ncomes into full bloom, ready to cut for compost or to turn under\r\ndirectly when the rice fields are plowed. Eighteen to twenty tons of\r\nthis green clover are produced per acre, and in Japan this is\r\nusually applied to about three acres, the stubble and roots serving\r\nfor the field producing the clover, thus giving a dressing of six to\r\nseven tons of green manure per acre, carrying not less than 37\r\npounds of potassium; 5 pounds of phosphorus, and 58 pounds of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nWhere the families are large and the holdings small, so they cannot\r\nspare room to grow the green manure crop, it is gathered on the\r\nmountain, weed and hill lands, or it may be cut in the canals. On\r\nour boat trip west from Soochow the last of May, many boats were\r\npassed carrying tons of the long green ribbon-like grass, cut and\r\ngathered from the bottom of the canal. To cut this grass men were\r\nworking to their armpits in the water of the canal, using a\r\ncrescent-shaped knife mounted like an anchor from the end of a\r\n16-foot bamboo handle. This was shoved forward along the bottom of\r\nthe canal and then drawn backward, cutting the grass, which rose to\r\nthe surface where it was gathered upon the boats. Or material for\r\ngreen manure may be cut on grave, mountain or hill lands, as\r\ndescribed under Fig. 115.\r\n\r\nThe straw of rice and other grain and the stems of any plant not\r\nusable as fuel may also be worked into the mud of rice fields, as\r\nmay the chaff which is often scattered upon the water after the rice\r\nis transplanted, as in Fig. 168.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the utilization of waste of various kinds\r\nin these countries to maintain the productive power of their soils,\r\nbut it is worth while, in the interests of western nations, as\r\nhelping them to realize the ultimate necessity of such economies, to\r\nstate again, in more explicit terms, what Japan is doing. Dr.\r\nKawaguchi, of the National Department of Agriculture and Commerce,\r\ntaking his data from their records, informed me that Japan produced,\r\nin 1908, and applied to her fields, 23,850,295 tons of human manure;\r\n22,812,787 tons of compost; and she imported 753,074 tons of\r\ncommercial fertilizers, 7000 of which were phosphates in one form or\r\nanother. In addition to these she must have applied not less than\r\n1,404,000 tons of fuel ashes and 10,185,500 tons of green manure\r\nproducts grown on her hill and weed lands, and all of these applied\r\nto less than 14,000,000 acres of cultivated field, and it should be\r\nemphasized that this is done because as yet they have found no\r\nbetter way of permanently maintaining a fertility capable of feeding\r\nher millions.\r\n\r\nBesides fertilizing, transplanting and weeding the rice crop there\r\nis the enormous task of irrigation to be maintained until the rice\r\nis nearly matured. Much of the water used is lifted by animal power\r\nand a large share of this is human. Fig. 169 shows two Chinese men\r\nin their cool, capacious, nowhere-touching summer trousers flinging\r\nwater with the swinging basket, and it is surprising the amount of\r\nwater which may be raised three to four feet by this means. The\r\nportable spool windlass, in Figs. 27 and 123, has been described,\r\nand Fig. 170 shows the quadrangular, cone-shaped bucket and sweep\r\nextensively used in Chihli. This man was supplying water sufficient\r\nfor the irrigation of half an acre, per day, lifting the water eight\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe form of pump most used in China and the foot-power for working\r\nit are seen in Fig. 171. Three men working a similar pump are seen\r\nin Fig. 150, a closer view of three men working the foot-power may\r\nbe seen in Fig. 42 and still another stands adjacent to a series of\r\nflooded fields in Fig. 172. Where this view was taken the old farmer\r\ninformed us that two men, with this pump, lifting water three feet,\r\nwere able to cover two mow of land with three inches of water in two\r\nhours. This is at the rate of 2.5 acre-inches of water per ten hours\r\nper man, and for 12 to 15 cents, our currency, thus making sixteen\r\nacre-inches, or the season's supply of water, cost 77 to 96 cents,\r\nwhere coolie labor is hired and fed. Such is the efficiency of human\r\npower applied to the Chinese pump, measured in American currency.\r\n\r\nThis pump is simply an open box trough in which travels a wooden\r\nchain carrying a series of loosely fitting boards which raise the\r\nwater from the canal, discharging it into the field. The size of the\r\ntrough and of the buckets are varied to suit the power applied and\r\nthe amount of water to be lifted. Crude as it appears there is\r\nnothing in western manufacture that can compete with it in first\r\ncost, maintenance or efficiency for Chinese conditions and nothing\r\nis more characteristic of all these people than their efficient,\r\nsimple appliances of all kinds, which they have reduced to the\r\nlowest terms in every feature of construction and cost. The greatest\r\nresults are accomplished by the simplest means. If a canal must be\r\nbridged and it is too wide to be covered by a single span, the\r\nChinese engineer may erect it at some convenient place and turn the\r\ncanal under it when completed. This we saw in the case of a new\r\nrailroad bridge near Sungkiang. The bridge was completed and the\r\nwater had just been turned under it and was being compelled to make\r\nits own excavation. Great expense had been saved while traffic on\r\nthe canal had not been obstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the foot-power wheel of Japan all gearing is eliminated and the\r\nman walks the paddles themselves, as seen in Fig. 173. Some of these\r\nwheels are ten feet in diameter, depending upon the height the water\r\nmust be lifted.\r\n\r\nIrrigation by animal power is extensively practiced in each of the\r\nthree countries, employing mostly the type of power wheel shown in\r\nFig. 158. The next illustration, Fig. 174, shows the most common\r\ntype of shelter seen in Chekiang and Kiangsu provinces, which are\r\nthere very numerous. We counted as many as forty such shelters in a\r\nsemi-circle of half a mile radius. They provide comfort for the\r\nanimals during both sunshine and rain, for under no conditions must\r\nthe water be permitted to run low on the rice fields, and everywhere\r\ntheir domestic animals receive kind, thoughtful treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the less level sections, where streams have sufficient fall,\r\ncurrent wheels are in common use, carrying buckets near their\r\ncircumference arranged so as to fill when passing through the water,\r\nand to empty after reaching the highest level into a receptacle\r\nprovided with a conduit which leads the water to the field. In\r\nSzechwan province some of these current wheels are so large and\r\ngracefully constructed as to strongly suggest Ferris wheels. A view\r\nof one of these we are permitted to present in Fig. 175, through the\r\nkindness of Rollin T. Chamberlin who took the photograph from which\r\nthe engraving was prepared. This wheel which was some forty feet in\r\ndiameter, was working when the snap shot was taken, raising the\r\nwater and pouring it into the horizontal trough seen near the top of\r\nthe wheel, carried at the summit of a pair of heavy poles standing\r\non the far side of the wheel. From this trough, leading away to the\r\nleft above the sky line, is the long pipe, consisting of bamboo\r\nstems joined together, for conveying the water to the fields.\r\n\r\nWhen the harvest time has come, notwithstanding the large acreage of\r\ngrain, yielding hundreds of millions of bushels, the small, widely\r\nscattered holdings and the surface of the fields render all of our\r\nmachine methods quite impossible. Even our grain cradle, which\r\npreceded the reaper, would not do, and the great task is still met\r\nwith the old-time sickle, as seen in Fig. 176, cutting the rice hill\r\nby hill, as it was transplanted.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the time for cutting, after the seed is well matured,\r\nthe water is drawn off and the land permitted to dry and harden. The\r\nrainy season is not yet over and much care must be exercised in\r\ncuring the crop. The bundles may be shocked in rows along the\r\nmargins of the paddies, as seen in Fig. 176, or they may be\r\nsuspended, heads down, from bamboo poles as seen in Fig. 177.\r\n\r\nThe threshing is accomplished by drawing the heads of the rice\r\nthrough the teeth of a metal comb mounted as seen at the right in\r\nFig. 178, near the lower corner, behind the basket, where a man and\r\nwoman are occupied in winnowing the dust and chaff from the grain by\r\nmeans of a large double fan. Fanning mills built on the principle of\r\nthose used by our farmers and closely resembling them have long been\r\nused in both China and Japan. After the rice is threshed the grain\r\nmust be hulled before it can serve as food, and the oldest and\r\nsimplest method of polishing used by the Japanese is seen in, Fig.\r\n179, where the friction of the grain upon itself does the polishing.\r\nA quantity of rice is poured into the receptacle when, with heavy\r\nblows, the long-headed plunger is driven into the mass of rice, thus\r\nforcing the kernels to slide over one another until, by their\r\nabrasion, the desired result is secured. The same method of\r\npolishing, on a larger scale, is accomplished where the plungers are\r\nworked by the weight of the body, a series of men stepping upon\r\nlever handles of weighted plungers, raising them and allowing them\r\nto fall under the force of the weight attached. Recently, however,\r\nmills worked by gasoline engines are in operation for both hulling\r\nand polishing, in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe many uses to which rice straw is put in the economies of these\r\npeople make it almost as important as the rice itself. As food and\r\nbedding for cattle and horses; as thatching material for dwellings\r\nand other shelters; as fuel; as a mulch; as a source of organic\r\nmatter in the soil, and as a fertilizer, it represents a money value\r\nwhich is very large. Besides these ultimate uses the rice straw is\r\nextensively employed in the manufacture of articles used in enormous\r\nquantities. It is estimated that not less than 188,700,000 bags such\r\nas are seen in Figs. 180 and 181, worth $3,110,000 are made annually\r\nfrom the rice straw in Japan, for handling 346,150,000 bushels of\r\ncereals and 28,190,000 bushels of beans; and besides these, great\r\nnumbers of bags are employed in transporting fish and other prepared\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\nIn the prefecture of Hyogo, with 596 square miles of farm land, as\r\ncompared with Rhode Island's 712 square miles, Hyogo farmers\r\nproduced in 1906, on 265,040 acres, 10,584,000 bushels of rice worth\r\n$16,191,400, securing an average yield of almost forty bushels per\r\nacre and a gross return of $61 for the grain alone. In addition to\r\nthis, these farmers grew on the same land, the same season, at least\r\none other crop. Where this was barley the average yield exceeded\r\ntwenty-six bushels per acre, worth $17.\r\n\r\nIn connection with their farm duties these Japanese families\r\nmanufactured, from a portion of their rice straw, at night and\r\nduring the leisure hours of winter, 8,980,000 pieces of matting and\r\nnetting of different kinds having a market value of $262,000;\r\n4,838,000 bags worth $185,000; 8,742,000 slippers worth $34,000;\r\n6,254,000 sandals worth $30,000; and miscellaneous articles worth\r\n$64,000. This is a gross earning of more than $21,000,000 from\r\neleven and a half townships of farm land and the labor of the\r\nfarmers' families, an average earning of, $80 per acre on nearly\r\nthree-fourths of the farm land of this prefecture. At this rate\r\nthree of the four forties of our 160-acre farms should bring a gross\r\nannual income of $9,600 and the fourth forty should pay the\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nAt the Nara Experiment Station we were informed that the money value\r\nof a good crop of rice in that prefecture should be placed at ninety\r\ndollars per acre for the grain and eight dollars for the\r\nunmanufactured straw; thirty-six dollars per acre for the crop of\r\nnaked barley and two dollars per acre for the straw. The farmers\r\nhere practice a rotation of rice and barley covering four or five\r\nyears, followed by a summer crop of melons, worth $320 per acre and\r\nsome other vegetable instead of the rice on the fifth or sixth year,\r\nworth eighty yen per tan, or $160 per acre. To secure green manure\r\nfor fertilizing, soy beans are planted each year in the space\r\nbetween the rows of barley, the barley being planted in November.\r\nOne week after the barley is harvested the soy beans, which produce\r\na yield of 160 kan per tan, or 5290 pounds per acre, are turned\r\nunder and the ground fitted for rice, At these rates the Nara\r\nfarmers are producing on four-fifths or five-sixths of their rice\r\nlands a gross earning of $136 per acre annually, and on the other\r\nfifth or sixth, an earning of $480 per acre, not counting the annual\r\ncrop of soy beans used in maintaining the nitrogen and organic\r\nmatter in their soils, and not counting their earnings from home\r\nmanufactures. Can the farmers of our south Atlantic and Gulf Coast\r\nstates, which are in the same latitude, sometime attain to this\r\nstandard? We see no reason why they should not, but only with the\r\nbest of irrigation, fertilization and proper rotation, with multiple\r\ncropping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nSILK CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the great and in some ways one of the most remarkable\r\nindustries of the Orient is that of silk production, and its\r\nmanufacture into the most exquisite and beautiful fabrics in the\r\nworld. Remarkable for its magnitude; for having had its birthplace\r\napparently in oldest China, at least 2600 years B. C.; for having\r\nbeen founded on the domestication of a wild insect of the woods; and\r\nfor having lived through more than four thousand years, expanding\r\nuntil a $1,000,000 cargo of the product has been laid down on our\r\nwestern coast at one time and rushed by special fast express to New\r\nYork City for the Christmas trade.\r\n\r\nJapan produced in 1907 26,072,000 pounds of raw silk from 17,154,000\r\nbushels of cocoons, feeding the silkworms from mulberry leaves grown\r\non 957,560 acres. At the export selling price of this silk in Japan\r\nthe crop represents a money value of $124,000,000, or more than two\r\ndollars per capita for the entire population of the Empire; and\r\nengaged in the care of the silkworms, as seen in Figs. 184, 185, 186\r\nand 187, there were, in 1906, 1,407,766 families or some 7,000,000\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nRichard's geography of the Chinese Empire places the total export of\r\nraw silk to all countries, from China, in 1905, at 30,413,200\r\npounds, and this, at the Japanese export price, represents a value\r\nof $145,000,000. Richard also states that the value of the annual\r\nChinese export of silk to France amounts to 10,000,000 pounds\r\nsterling and that this is but twelve per cent of the total, from\r\nwhich it appears that her total export alone reaches a value near\r\n$400,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe use of silk in wearing apparel is more general among the Chinese\r\nthan among the Japanese, and with China's eightfold greater\r\npopulation, the home consumption of silk must be large indeed and\r\nher annual production must much exceed that of Japan. Hosie places\r\nthe output of raw silk in Szechwan at 5,439,500 pounds, which is\r\nnearly a quarter of the total output of Japan, and silk is\r\nextensively grown in eight other provinces, which together have an\r\narea nearly fivefold that of Japan. It would appear, therefore, that\r\na low estimate of China's annual production of raw silk must be some\r\n120,000,000 pounds, and this, with the output of Japan and Korea,\r\nwould make a product for the three countries probably exceeding\r\n150,000,000 pounds annually, representing a total value of perhaps\r\n$700,000,000; quite equalling in value the wheat crop of the United\r\nStates, but produced on less than one-eighth of the area.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Count Dandola, the worms which\r\ncontribute to this vast earning are so small that some 700,000 of\r\nthem weigh at hatching only one pound, but they grow very rapidly,\r\nshed their skins four times, weighing 15 pounds at the time of the\r\nfirst moult, 94 pounds at the second, 400 pounds at the third, 1628\r\npounds at the fourth moulting and when mature have come to weigh\r\nnearly five tons--9500 pounds. But in making this growth during\r\nabout thirty-six days, according to Paton, the 700,000 worms have\r\neaten 105 pounds by the time of the first moult; 315 pounds by the\r\nsecond; 1050 pounds by the third; 3150 pounds by the fourth, and in\r\nthe final period, before spinning, 19,215 pounds, thus consuming in\r\nall nearly twelve tons of mulberry leaves in producing nearly five\r\ntons of live weight, or at the rate of two and a half pounds of\r\ngreen leaf to one pound of growth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Paton, the cocoons from the 700,000 worms would weigh\r\nbetween 1400 and 2100 pounds and these, according to the\r\nobservations of Hosie in the province of Szechwan, would yield about\r\none-twelfth their weight of raw silk. On this basis the one pound of\r\nworms hatched from the eggs would yield between 116 and 175 pounds\r\nof raw silk, worth, at the Japanese export price for 1907, between\r\n$550 and $832, and 164 pounds of green mulberry leaves would be\r\nrequired to produce a pound of silk.\r\n\r\nA Chinese banker in Chekiang province, with whom we talked, stated\r\nthat the young worms which would hatch from the eggs spread on a\r\nsheet of paper twelve by eighteen inches would consume, in coming to\r\nmaturity, 2660 pounds of mulberry leaves and would spin 21.6 pounds\r\nof silk. This is at the rate of 123 pounds of leaves to one pound of\r\nsilk. The Japanese crop for 1907, 26,072,000 pounds, produced on\r\n957,560 acres, is a mean yield of 27.23 pounds of raw silk per acre\r\nof mulberries, and this would require a mean yield of 4465 pounds of\r\ngreen mulberry leaves per acre, at the rate of 164 pounds per pound\r\nof silk.\r\n\r\nOrdinary silk in these countries is produced largely from three\r\nvarieties of mulberries, and from them there may be three pickings\r\nof leaves for the rearing of a spring, summer and autumn crop of\r\nsilk. We learned at the Nagoya Experiment Station, Japan, that there\r\ngood spring yields of mulberry leaves are at the rate of 400 kan,\r\nthe second crop, 150 kan, and the third crop, 250 kan per tan,\r\nmaking a total yield of over thirteen tons of green leaves per acre.\r\nThis, however, seems to be materially higher than the average for\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 188 is a near view of a mulberry orchard in Chekiang\r\nprovince, which has been very heavily fertilized with canal mud, and\r\nwhich was at the stage for cutting the leaves to feed the first crop\r\nof silkworms. A bundle of cut limbs is in the crotch of the front\r\ntree in the view. Those who raise mulberry leaves are not usually\r\nthe feeders of the silkworms and the leaves from this orchard were\r\nbeing sold at one dollar, Mexican, per picul, or 32.25 cents per one\r\nhundred pounds. The same price was being paid a week later in the\r\nvicinity of Nanking, Kiangsu province.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry trees, as they appear before coming into leaf in the\r\nearly spring, may be seen in Fig. 189. The long limbs are the shoots\r\nof the last year's growth, from which at least one crop of leaves\r\nhad been picked, and in healthy orchards they may have a length of\r\ntwo to three feet. An orchard from a portion of which the limbs had\r\njust been cut, presented the appearance seen in Fig. 190. These\r\ntrees were twelve to fifteen years old and the enlargements on the\r\nends of the limbs resulted from the frequent pruning, year after\r\nyear, at nearly the same place. The ground under these trees was\r\nthickly covered with a growth of pink clover just coming into bloom,\r\nwhich would be spaded into the soil, providing nitrogen and organic\r\nmatter, whose decay would liberate potash, phosphorus and other\r\nmineral plant food elements for the crop.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 191 three rows of mulberry trees, planted four feet apart,\r\nstand on a narrow embankment raised four feet, partly through\r\nadjusting the surrounding fields for rice, and partly by additions\r\nof canal mud used as a fertilizer. On either side of the mulberries\r\nis a crop of windsor beans, and on the left a crop of rape, both of\r\nwhich would be harvested in early June, the ground where they stand\r\nflooded, plowed and transplanted to rice. This and the other\r\nmulberry views were taken in the extensively canalized portion of\r\nChina represented in Fig. 52. The farmer owning this orchard had\r\njust finished cutting two large bundles of limbs for the sale of the\r\nleaves in the village. He stated that his first crop ordinarily\r\nyields from three to as many as twenty piculs per mow, but that the\r\nsecond crop seldom exceeded two to three piculs. The first and\r\nsecond crop of leaves, if yielding together twenty-three piculs per\r\nmow, would amount to 9.2 tons per acre, worth, at the price named,\r\n$59.34. Mulberry leaves must be delivered fresh as soon as gathered\r\nand must be fed the same day, the limbs, when, stripped of their\r\nleaves, at the place where these are sold, are tied into bundles and\r\nreserved for use as fuel.\r\n\r\nIn the south of China the mulberry is grown from low cuttings rooted\r\nby layering. We have before spoken of our five hours ride in the\r\nCanton delta region, on the steamer Nanning, through extensive\r\nfields of low mulberry then in full leaf, which were first mistaken\r\nfor cotton nearing the blossom stage. This form of mulberry is seen\r\nin Fig. 43, and the same method of pruning is practiced in southern\r\nJapan. In middle Japan high pruning, as in Chekiang and Kiangsu\r\nprovinces, is followed, but in northern Japan the leaves are picked\r\ndirectly, as is the case with the last crop of leaves everywhere,\r\npruning not being practiced in the more northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nNot all silk produced in these northern countries is from the\r\ndomesticated Bombyx mori, large amounts being obtained from the\r\nspinnings of wild silkworms feeding upon the leaves of species of\r\noak growing on the mountain and hill lands in various parts of\r\nChina, Korea and Japan. In China the collections in largest amount\r\nare reeled from the cocoons of the tussur worm (Antheraea pernyi)\r\ngathered in Shantung, Honan, Kweichow and Szechwan provinces. In the\r\nhilly parts of Manchuria also this industry is attaining large\r\nproportions, the cocoons being sent to Chefoo in the Shantung\r\nprovince, to be woven into pongee silk.\r\n\r\nM. Randot has estimated the annual crop of wild silk cocoons in\r\nSzechwan at 10,180,000 pounds, although in the opinion of Alexander\r\nHosie much of this may come from Kweichow. Richard places the export\r\nof raw wild silk from the whole of China proper, in 1904, at\r\n4,400,000 pounds. This would mean not less than 75,300,000 pounds of\r\nwild cocoons and may be less than half the home consumption.\r\n\r\nFrom data collected by Alexander Hosie it appears that in 1899 the\r\nexport of raw tussur silk from Manchuria, through the port of\r\nNewchwang by steamer alone, was 1,862,448 pounds, valued at\r\n$1,721,200, and the production is increasing rapidly. The export\r\nfrom the same port the previous year, by steamer, was 1,046,704\r\npounds. This all comes from the hilly and mountain lands south of\r\nMukden, lying between the Liao plain on the west and the Yalu river\r\non the east, covering some five thousand square miles, which we\r\ncrossed on the Antung-Mukden railway.\r\n\r\nThere are two broods of these wild silkworms each season, between\r\nearly May and early October. Cocoons of the fall brood are kept\r\nthrough the winter and when the moths come forth they are caused to\r\nlay their eggs on pieces of cloth and when the worms are hatched\r\nthey are fed until the first moult upon the succulent new oak leaves\r\ngathered from the hills, after which the worms are taken to the low\r\noak growth on the hills where they feed themselves and spin their\r\ncocoons under the cover of leaves drawn about them.\r\n\r\nThe moths reserved from the first brood, after becoming fertile, are\r\ntied by means of threads to the oak bushes where they deposit the\r\neggs which produce the second crop of tussur silk. To maintain an\r\nabundance of succulent leaves within reach the oaks are periodically\r\ncut back.\r\n\r\nThus these plain people, patient, frugal, unshrinking from toil, the\r\nbasic units of three of the oldest nations, go to the uncultivated\r\nhill lands and from the wild oak and the millions of insects which\r\nthey help to feed upon it, not only create a valuable export trade\r\nbut procure material for clothing, fuel, fertilizer and food, for\r\nthe large chrysalides, cooked in the reeling of the silk, may be\r\neaten at once or are seasoned with sauce to be used later. Besides\r\nthis, the last unreelable portion of each cocoon is laid aside to be\r\nmanufactured into silk wadding and into soft mattresses for caskets\r\nupon which the wealthy lay their dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE TEA INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tea in China and Japan is another of the great\r\nindustries of these nations, taking rank with that of sericulture,\r\nif not above it, in the important part it plays in the welfare of\r\nthe people. There is little reason to doubt that the industry has\r\nits foundation in the need of something to render boiled water\r\npalatable for drinking purposes. The drinking of boiled water has\r\nbeen universally adopted in these countries as an individually\r\navailable, thoroughly efficient and safe guard against that class of\r\ndeadly disease germs which it has been almost impossible to exclude\r\nfrom the drinking water of any densely peopled country.\r\n\r\nSo far as may be judged from the success of the most thorough\r\nsanitary measures thus far instituted, and taking into consideration\r\nthe inherent difficulties which must increase enormously with\r\nincreasing populations, it appears inevitable that modern methods\r\nmust ultimately fail in sanitary efficiency and that absolute safety\r\nmust be secured in some manner having the equivalent effect of\r\nboiling water, long ago adopted by the Mongolian races, and which\r\ndestroys active disease germs at the latest moment before using. And\r\nit must not be overlooked that the boiling of drinking water in\r\nChina and Japan has been demanded quite as much because of congested\r\nrural populations as to guard against such dangers in large cities,\r\nwhile as yet our sanitary engineers have dealt only with the urban\r\nphases of this most vital problem and chiefly, too, thus far, only\r\nwhere it has been possible to procure the water supply in\r\ncomparatively unpopulated hill lands. But such opportunities cannot\r\nremain available indefinitely, any more than they did in China and\r\nJapan, and already typhoid epidemics break out in our large cities\r\nand citizens are advised to boil their drinking water.\r\n\r\nIf tea drinking in the family is to remain general in most portions\r\nof the world, and especially if it shall increase in proportion to\r\npopulation, there is great industrial and commercial promise for\r\nChina, Korea and Japan in their tea industry if they will develop\r\ntea culture still further over the extensive and still unused flanks\r\nof the hill lands; improve their cultural methods; their\r\nmanufacture; and develop their export trade. They have the best of\r\nclimatic and soil conditions and people sufficiently capable of\r\nenormously expanding the industry. Both improvement and expansion of\r\nmethods along all essential lines, are needed, enabling them to put\r\nupon the market pure teas of thoroughly uniform grades of guaranteed\r\nquality, and with these the maintenance of an international code of\r\nrigid ethics which shall secure to all concerned a square deal and a\r\nfair division of the profits.\r\n\r\nThe production of rice, silk and tea are three industries which\r\nthese nations are preeminently circumstanced and qualified to\r\neconomically develop and maintain. Other nations may better\r\nspecialize along other lines which fitness determines, and the time\r\nis coming when maximum production at minimum cost as the result of\r\nclean robust living that in every way is worth while, will determine\r\nlines of social progress and of international relations. With the\r\nvital awakening to the possibility of and necessity for world peace,\r\nit must be recognized that this can be nothing less than universal,\r\nindustrial, commercial, intellectual and religious, in addition to\r\nmaking impossible forever the bloody carnage that has ravaged the\r\nworld through all the centuries.\r\n\r\nWith the extension of rapid transportation and more rapid\r\ncommunication throughout the world, we are fast entering the state\r\nof social development which will treat the whole world as a mutually\r\nhelpful, harmonious industrial unit. It must be recognized that in\r\ncertain regions, because of peculiar fitness of soil, climate and\r\npeople, needful products can be produced there better and enough\r\nmore cheaply than elsewhere to pay the cost of transportation. If\r\nChina, Korea and Japan, with parts of India, can and will produce\r\nthe best and cheapest silks, teas or rice, it must be for the\r\ngreatest good to seek a mutually helpful exchange, and the erection\r\nof impassable tariff barriers is a declaration of war and cannot\r\nmake for world peace and world progress.\r\n\r\nThe date of the introduction of tea culture into China appears\r\nunknown. It was before the beginning of the Christian era and\r\ntradition would place it more than 2700 years earlier. The Japanese\r\ndefinitely date its introduction into their islands as in the year\r\n805 A. D., and state its coming to them from China. However and\r\nwhenever tea growing originated in these countries, it long ago\r\nattained and now maintains large proportions. In 1907 Japan had\r\n124,482 acres of land occupied by tea gardens and tea plantations.\r\nThese produced 60,877,975 pounds of cured tea, giving a mean yield\r\nof 489 pounds per acre. Of the more than sixty million pounds of tea\r\nproduced annually on nearly two hundred square miles in Japan, less\r\nthan twenty-two million pounds are consumed at home, the balance\r\nbeing exported at a cash value, in 1907, of $6,309,122, or a mean of\r\nsixteen cents per pound.\r\n\r\nIn China the volume of tea produced annually is much larger than in\r\nJapan. Hosie places the annual export from Szechwan into Tibet alone\r\nat 40,000,000 pounds and this is produced largely in the mountainous\r\nportion of the province west of the Min river. Richard places her\r\ndirect export to foreign countries, in 1905, at 176,027,255 pounds;\r\nand in 1906 at 180,271,000 pounds, so that the annual export must\r\nexceed 200,000,000 pounds, and her total product of cured tea must\r\nbe more than 400,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of tea bushes as they are grown in Japan is\r\nindicated in Fig. 192. The form of the bushes, the shape and size of\r\nthe leaves and the dense green, shiny foliage quite suggests our\r\nbox, so much used in borders and hedges. When the bushes are young,\r\nnot covering the ground, other crops are grown between the rows, but\r\nas the bushes attain their full size, standing after trimming, waist\r\nto breast high, the ground between is usually thickly covered with\r\nstraw, leaves or grass and weeds from the hill lands, which serve as\r\na mulch, as a fertilizer, as a means of preventing washing on the\r\nhillsides, and to force the rain to enter the soil uniformly where\r\nit falls.\r\n\r\nQuite a large per cent of the tea bushes are grown on small,\r\nscattering, irregular areas about dwellings, on land not readily\r\ntilled, but there are also many tea plantations of considerable\r\nsize, presenting the appearance seen in Fig. 193. After each picking\r\nof the leaves the bushes are trimmed back with pruning shears,\r\ngiving the rows the appearance of carefully trimmed hedges.\r\n\r\nThe tea leaves are hand picked, generally by women and girls, after\r\nthe manner seen in Fig. 194, where they are gathering the tender,\r\nnewly-formed leaves into baskets to be weighed fresh, as seen in\r\nFig. 195.\r\n\r\nThree crops of leaves are usually gathered each season, the first\r\nyielding in Japan one hundred kan per tan, the second fifty kan and\r\nthe third eighty kan per tan. This is at the rate of 3307 pounds,\r\n1653 pounds, and 2645 pounds per acre, making a total of 7605 pounds\r\nfor the season, from which the grower realizes from a little more\r\nthan 2.2 to a little more than 3 cents per pound of the green\r\nleaves, or a gross earning of $167 to $209.50 per acre.\r\n\r\nWe were informed that the usual cost for fertilizers for the tea\r\norchards was 15 to 20 yen per tan, or $30 to $40 per acre per annum,\r\nthe fertilizer being applied in the fall, in the early spring and\r\nagain after the first picking of the leaves. While the tea plants\r\nare yet small one winter crop and one summer crop of vegetables,\r\nbeans or barley are grown between the rows, these giving a return of\r\nsome forty dollars per acre. Where the plantations are given good\r\ncare and ample fertilization the life of a plantation may be\r\nprolonged continuously, it is said, through one hundred or more\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDuring our walk from Joji to Kowata, along a country road in one of\r\nthe tea districts, we passed a tea-curing house. This was a long\r\nrectangular, one-story building with twenty furnaces arranged, each\r\nunder an open window, around the sides. In front of each heated\r\nfurnace with its tray of leaves, a Japanese man, wearing only a\r\nbreech cloth, and in a state of profuse perspiration, was busy\r\nrolling the tea leaves between the palms of his hands.\r\n\r\nAt another place we witnessed the making of the low grade dust tea,\r\nwhich is prepared from the leaves of bushes which must be removed or\r\nfrom those of the prunings. In this case the dried bushes with their\r\nleaves were being beaten with flails on a threshing floor. The dust\r\ntea thus produced is consumed by the poorer people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nABOUT TIENTSIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June we left central China for Tientsin and further\r\nnorth, sailing by coastwise steamer from Shanghai, again plowing\r\nthrough the turbid waters which give literal exactness to the name\r\nYellow Sea. Our steamer touched at Tsingtao, taking on board a body\r\nof German troops, and again at Chefoo, and it was only between these\r\ntwo points that the sea was not strongly turbid. Nor was this all.\r\nFrom early morning of the 10th until we anchored at Tientsin, 2:30\r\nP. M., our course up the winding Pei ho was against a strong\r\ndust-laden wind which left those who had kept to the deck as grey as\r\nthough they had ridden by automobile through the Colorado desert; so\r\nthe soils of high interior Asia are still spreading eastward by\r\nflood and by wind into the valleys and far over the coastal plains.\r\nOver large areas between Tientsin and Peking and at other points\r\nnorthward toward Mukden trees and shrubs have been systematically\r\nplanted in rectangular hedgerow lines, to check the force of the\r\nwinds and reduce the drifting of soils, planted fields occupying the\r\nspaces between.\r\n\r\nIt was on this trip that we met Dr. Evans of Shunking, Szechwan\r\nprovince. His wife is a physician practicing among the Chinese\r\nwomen, and in discussing the probable rate of increase of population\r\namong the Chinese, it was stated that she had learned through her\r\npractice that very many mothers had borne seven to eleven children\r\nand yet but one, two or at most three, were living.\r\n\r\nIt was said there are many customs and practices which determine\r\nthis high mortality among children, one of which is that of feeding\r\nthem meat before they have teeth, the mother masticating for the\r\nchildren, with the result that often fatal convulsions follow. A\r\nScotch physician of long experience in Shantung, who took the\r\nsteamer at Tsingtao, replied to my question as to the usual size of\r\nfamilies in his circuit, \"I do not know. It depends on the crops. In\r\ngood years the number is large; in times of famine the girls\r\nespecially are disposed of, often permitted to die when very young\r\nfor lack of care. Many are sold at such times to go into other\r\nprovinces.\" Such statements, however, should doubtless be taken with\r\nmuch allowance. If all the details were known regarding the cases\r\nwhich have served as foundations for such reports, the matter might\r\nappear in quite a different light from that suggested by such cold\r\nrecitals.\r\n\r\nAlthough land taxes are high in China Dr. Evans informed me that it\r\nis not infrequent for the same tax to be levied twice and even three\r\ntimes in one year. Inquiries regarding the land taxes among farmers\r\nin different parts of China showed rates running from three cents to\r\na dollar and a half, Mexican, per mow; or from about eight cents to\r\n$3.87 gold, per acre. At these rates a forty acre farm would pay\r\nfrom $3.20 to $154.80, and a quarter section four times these\r\namounts. Data collected by Consul-General E. T. Williams of Tientsin\r\nindicate that in Shantung the land tax is about one dollar per acre,\r\nand in Chihli, twenty cents. In Kiangsi province the rate is 200 to\r\n300 cash per mow, and in Kiangsu, from 500 to 600 cash per mow, or,\r\naccording to the rate of exchange given on page 76, from 60 to 80\r\ncents, or 90 cents to $1.20 per acre in Kiangsi; and $1.50 to $2.00\r\nor $1.80 to $2.40 in Kiangsu province. The lowest of these rates\r\nwould make the land tax on 160 acres, $96, and the highest would\r\nplace it at $384, gold.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the taxes are paid quarterly and the combined amount of the\r\nnational, prefectural and village assessments usually aggregates\r\nabout ten per cent of the government valuation placed on the land.\r\nThe mean valuation placed on the irrigated fields, excluding Formosa\r\nand Karafuto, was in 1907, 35.35 yen per tan; that of the upland\r\nfields, 9.40 yen, and the genya and pasture lands were given a\r\nvaluation of .22 yen per tan. These are valuations of $70.70, $18.80\r\nand $.44, gold, per acre, respectively, and the taxes on forty acres\r\nof paddy field would be $282.80; $75.20 on forty acres of upland\r\nfield, and $1.76, gold, on the same area of the genya and weed\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIn the villages, where work of one or another kind is done for pay,\r\nDr. Evans stated that a woman's wage might not exceed $8, Mexican,\r\nor $3.44, gold, per year, and when we asked how it could be worth a\r\nwoman's while to work a whole year for so small a sum, his reply\r\nwas, \"If she did not do this she would earn nothing, and this would\r\nkeep her in clothes and a little more.\" A cotton spinner in his\r\nchurch would procure a pound of cotton and on returning the yarn\r\nwould receive one and a quarter pounds of cotton in exchange, the\r\nquarter pound being her compensation.\r\n\r\nDr. Evans also described a method of rooting slips from trees,\r\npracticed in various parts of China. The under side of a branch is\r\ncut, bent upward and split for a short distance; about this is\r\npacked a ball of moistened earth wrapped in straw to retain the soil\r\nand to provide for future watering; the whole may then be bound with\r\nstrips of bamboo for greater stability. In this way slips for new\r\nmulberry orchards are procured.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the morning we entered the mouth of the Pei ho\r\nand wound westward through a vast, nearly sea-level, desert plain\r\nand in both directions, far toward the horizon, huge white stacks of\r\nsalt dotted the surface of the Taku Government salt fields, and\r\nrevolving in the wind were great numbers of horizontal sail\r\nwindmills, pumping sea water into an enormous acreage of evaporation\r\nbasins. In Fig. 196 may be seen five of the large salt stacks and\r\nsix of the windmills, together with many smaller piles of salt. Fig.\r\n197 is a closer view of the evaporation basins with piles of salt\r\nscraped from the surface after the mother liquor had been drained\r\naway. The windmills, which were working one, sometimes two, of the\r\nlarge wooden chain pumps, were some thirty feet in diameter and\r\nlifted the brine from tide-water basins into those of a second and\r\nthird higher level where the second and final concentration\r\noccurred. These windmills, crude as they appear in Fig. 198, are\r\nnevertheless efficient, cheaply constructed and easily controlled.\r\nThe eight sails, each six by ten feet, were so hung as to take the\r\nwind through the entire revolution, tilting automatically to receive\r\nthe wind on the opposite face the moment the edge passed the\r\ncritical point. Some 480 feet of sail surface were thus spread to\r\nthe wind, working on a radius of fifteen feet. The horizontal drive\r\nwheel had a diameter of ten feet, carried eighty-eight wooden cogs\r\nwhich engaged a pinion with fifteen leaves, and there were nine arms\r\non the reel at the other end of the shaft which drove the chain. The\r\nboards or buckets of the chain pump were six by twelve inches,\r\nplaced nine inches apart, and with a fair breeze the pump ran full.\r\n\r\nEnormous quantities of salt are thus cheaply manufactured through\r\nwind, tide and sun power directed by the cheapest human labor.\r\nBefore reaching Tientsin we passed the Government storage yards and\r\ncounted two hundred stacks of salt piled in the open, and more than\r\na third of the yard had been passed before beginning the count. The\r\naverage content of each stack must have exceeded 3000 cubic feet of\r\nsalt, and more than 40,000,000 pounds must have been stored in the\r\nyards. Armed guards in military uniform patrolled the alleyways day\r\nand night. Long strips of matting laid over the stacks were the only\r\nshelter against rain.\r\n\r\nThroughout the length of China's seacoast, from as far north as\r\nbeyond Shanhaikwan, south to Canton, salt is manufactured from sea\r\nwater in suitable places. In Szechwan province, we learn from the\r\nreport of Consul-General Hosie, that not less than 300,000 tons of\r\nsalt are annually manufactured there, largely from brine raised by\r\nanimal power from wells seven hundred to more than two thousand feet\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nHosie describes the operations at a well more than two thousand feet\r\ndeep, at Tzeliutsing. In the basement of a power-house which\r\nsheltered forty water buffaloes, a huge bamboo drum twelve feet\r\nhigh, sixty feet in circumference, was so set as to revolve on a\r\nvertical axis propelled by four cattle drawing from its\r\ncircumference. A hemp rope was wound about this drum, six feet from\r\nthe ground, passing out and under a pulley at the well, then up and\r\naround a wheel mounted sixty feet above and descended to the bucket\r\nmade from bamboo stems four inches in diameter and nearly sixty feet\r\nlong, which dropped with great speed to the bottom of the well as\r\nthe rope unwound. When the bucket reached the bottom four\r\nattendants, each with a buffalo in readiness, hitched to the drum\r\nand drove at a running pace, during fifteen minutes, or until the\r\nbucket was raised from the well. The buffalo were then unhitched\r\nand, while the bucket was being emptied and again dropped to the\r\nbottom of the well, a fresh relay were brought to the drum. In this\r\nway the work continued night and day.\r\n\r\nThe brine, after being raised from the well, was emptied into\r\ndistributing reservoirs, flowing thence through bamboo pipes to the\r\nevaporating sheds where round bottomed, shallow iron kettles four\r\nfeet across were set in brick arches in which jets of natural gas\r\nwere burning.\r\n\r\nWithin an area some sixty miles square there are more than a\r\nthousand brine and twenty fire wells from which fuel gas is taken.\r\nThe mouths of the fire wells are closed with masonry, out from which\r\nbamboo conduits coated with lime lead to the various furnaces,\r\nterminating with iron burners beneath the kettles. Remarkable is the\r\nfact that in the city of Tzeliutsing, both these brine and the fire\r\nwells have been operated in the manufacture of salt since before\r\nChrist was born.\r\n\r\nThe forty water buffalo are worth $30 to $40 per head and their food\r\nfifteen to twenty cents per day. The cost of manufacturing this salt\r\nis placed at thirteen to fourteen cash per catty, to which the\r\nGovernment adds a tax of nine cash more, making the cost at the\r\nfactory from 82 cents to $1.15, gold, per hundred pounds. Salt\r\nmanufacture is a Government monopoly and the product must be sold\r\neither to Government officials or to merchants who have bought the\r\nexclusive right to supply certain districts. The importation of salt\r\nis prohibited by treaties. For the salt tax collection China is\r\ndivided into eleven circuits each having its own source of supply\r\nand transfer of salt from one circuit to another is forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe usual cost of salt is said to vary between one and a half and\r\nfour cash per catty. The retail price of salt ranges from\r\nthree-fourths to three cents per pound, fully twelve to fifteen\r\ntimes the cost of manufacture. The annual production of salt in the\r\nEmpire is some 1,860,000 tons, and in 1901 salt paid a tax close to\r\nten million dollars.\r\n\r\nBeyond the salt fields, toward Tientsin, the banks of the river were\r\ndotted at short intervals with groups of low, almost windowless\r\nhouses, Fig. 199, built of earth brick plastered with clay on sides\r\nand roof, made more resistant to rain by an admixture of chaff and\r\ncut straw, and there was a remarkable freshness of look about them\r\nwhich we learned was the result of recent preparations made for the\r\nrainy season about to open. Beyond the first of these villages came\r\na stretch of plain dotted thickly and far with innumerable grave\r\nmounds, to which reference has been made. For nearly an hour we had\r\ntraveled up the river before there was any material vegetation, the\r\nsoil being too saline apparently to permit growth, but beyond this,\r\ncrops in the fields and gardens, with some fruit and other trees,\r\nformed a fringe of varying width along the banks. Small fields of\r\ntransplanted rice on both banks were frequent and often the land was\r\nlaid out in beds of two levels, carefully graded, the rice occupying\r\nthe lower areas, and wooden chain pumps were being worked by hand,\r\nfoot and animal power, irrigating both rice and garden crops.\r\n\r\nIn the villages were many stacks of earth compost, of the Shantung\r\ntype; manure middens were common and donkeys drawing heavy stone\r\nrollers followed by men with large wooden mallets, were going round\r\nand round, pulverizing and mixing the dry earth compost and the\r\nlarge earthen brick from dismantled kangs, preparing fertilizer for\r\nthe new series of crops about to be planted, following the harvest\r\nof wheat and barley. Large boatloads of these prepared fertilizers\r\nwere moving on the river and up the canals to the fields.\r\n\r\nToward the coast from Tientsin, especially in the country, traversed\r\nby the railroad, there was little produced except a short grass,\r\nthis being grazed at the time of our visit and, in places, cut for a\r\nvery meagre crop of hay. The productive cultivated lands lie chiefly\r\nalong the rivers and canals or other water courses, where there is\r\nbetter drainage as well as water for irrigation. The extensive,\r\nclose canalization that characterizes parts of Kiangsu and Chekiang\r\nprovinces is lacking here and for this reason, in part, the soil is\r\nnot so productive. The fuller canalization, the securing of adequate\r\ndrainage and the gaining of complete control of the flood waters\r\nwhich flow through this vast plain during the rainy season\r\nconstitute one of China's most important industrial problems which,\r\nwhen properly solved, must vastly increase her resources. During our\r\ndrive over the old Peking-Taku road saline deposits were frequently\r\nobserved which had been brought to the surface during the dry\r\nseason, and the city engineer of Tientsin stated that in their\r\nefforts at parking portions of the foreign concessions they had\r\nfound the trees dying after a few years when their roots began to\r\npenetrate the more saline subsoil, but that since they had opened\r\ncanals, improving the drainage, trees were no longer dying. There is\r\nlittle doubt that proper drainage by means of canals, and the\r\nirrigation which would go with it, would make all of these lands,\r\nnow more or less saline, highly productive, as are now those\r\ncontiguous to the existing water courses.\r\n\r\nIt had rained two days before our drive over the Taku road and when\r\nwe applied for a conveyance, the proprietor doubted whether the\r\nroads were passible, as he had been compelled to send out an extra\r\nteam to assist in the return of one which had been stalled during\r\nthe previous night. It was finally arranged to send an extra horse\r\nwith us. The rainy season had just begun but the deep trenching of\r\nthe roads concentrates the water in them and greatly intensifies the\r\ntrouble. In one of the little hamlets through which we passed the\r\nroadway was trenched to a depth of three to four feet in the middle\r\nof the narrow street, leaving only five feet for passing in front of\r\nthe dwellings on either side, and in this trench our carriage moved\r\nthrough mud and water nearly to the hubs.\r\n\r\nBetween Tientsin and Peking, in the early morning after a rain of\r\nthe night before, we saw many farmers working their fields with the\r\nbroad hoes, developing an earth mulch at the first possible moment\r\nto conserve their much needed moisture. Men were at work, as seen in\r\nFigs. 200 and 201, using long handled hoes, with blades nine by\r\nthirteen inches, hung so as to draw just under the surface, doing\r\nvery effective work, permitting them to cover the ground rapidly.\r\n\r\nWalking further, we came upon six women in a field of wheat,\r\ngleaning the single heads which had prematurely ripened and broken\r\nover upon the ground between the rows soon to be harvested. Whether\r\nthey were doing this as a privilege or as a task we do not know;\r\nthey were strong, cheerful, reasonably dressed, hardly past middle\r\nlife and it was nearly noon, yet not one of them had collected more\r\nstraws than she could readily grasp in one hand. The season in\r\nChihli as in Shantung, had been one of unusual drought, making the\r\ncrop short and perhaps unusual frugality was being practiced; but it\r\nis in saving that these people excel perhaps more than in producing.\r\nThese heads of wheat, if left upon the ground, would be wasted and\r\nif the women were privileged gleaners in the fields their returns\r\nwere certainly much greater than were those of the very old women we\r\nhave seen in France gathering heads of wheat from the already\r\nharvested fields.\r\n\r\nIn the fields between Tientsin and Peking all wheat was being\r\npulled, the earth shaken from the roots, tied in small bundles and\r\ntaken to the dwellings, sometimes on the heavy cart drawn by a team\r\nconsisting of a small donkey and cow hitched tandem, as seen in Fig.\r\n202. Millet had been planted between the rows of wheat in this field\r\nand was already up. When the wheat was removed the ground would be\r\nfertilized and planted to soy beans. Because of the dry season this\r\nfarmer estimated his yield would be but eight to nine bushels per\r\nacre. He was expecting to harvest thirteen to fourteen bushels of\r\nmillet and from ten to twelve bushels of soy beans per acre from the\r\nsame field. This would give him an earning, based on the local\r\nprices, of $10.36, gold, for the wheat; $6.00 for the beans, and\r\n$5.48 per acre for the millet. This land was owned by the family of\r\nthe Emperor and was rented at $1.55, gold, per acre. The soil was a\r\nrather light sandy loam, not inherently fertile, and fertilizers to\r\nthe value of $3.61 gold, per acre, had been applied, leaving the\r\nearning $16.71 per acre.\r\n\r\nAnother farmer with whom we talked, pulling his crop of wheat, would\r\nfollow this with millet and soy beans in alternate rows. His yield\r\nof wheat was expected to be eleven to twelve bushels per acre, his\r\nbeans twenty-one bushels and his millet twenty-five bushels which,\r\nat the local prices for grain and straw, would bring a gross earning\r\nof $35, gold, per acre.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the end of our walk through the fields toward the\r\nnext station we came across another of the many instances of the\r\nlabor these people are willing to perform for only a small possible\r\nincrease in crop. The field was adjacent to one of the windbreak\r\nhedges and the trees had spread their roots far afield and were\r\nthreatening his crop through the consumption of moisture and plant\r\nfood. To check this depletion the farmer had dug a trench twenty\r\ninches deep the length of his field, and some twenty feet from the\r\nline of trees, thereby cutting all of the surface roots to stop\r\ntheir draft on the soil. The trench was left open and an interesting\r\nfeature observed was that nearly every cut root on the field side of\r\nthe trench had thrown up one or more shoots bearing leaves, while\r\nthe ends still connected with the trees showed no signs of leaf\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIn Chihli as elsewhere the Chinese are skilled gardeners, using\r\nwater for irrigation whenever it is advantageous. One gardener was\r\ngrowing a crop of early cabbage, followed by one of melons, and\r\nthese with radish the same season. He was paying a rent of $6.45,\r\ngold, per acre; was applying fertilizer at a cost of nearly $8 per\r\nacre for each of the three crops, making his cash outlay $29.67 per\r\nacre. His crop of cabbage sold for $103, gold; his melons for $77,\r\nand his radish for something more than $51, making a total of\r\n$232.20 per acre, leaving him a net value of $202.53.\r\n\r\nA second gardener, growing potatoes, obtained a yield, when sold\r\nnew, of 8,000 pounds per acre; and of 16,000 pounds when the crop\r\nwas permitted to mature. The new potatoes were sold so as to bring\r\n$51.60 and the mature potatoes $185.76 per acre, making the earning\r\nfor the two crops the same season a total of $237.36, gold. By\r\nplanting the first crop very early these gardeners secure two crops\r\nthe same season, as far north as Columbus, Ohio, and Springfield,\r\nIllinois, the first crop being harvested when the tubers are about\r\nthe size of walnuts. The rental and fertilizers in this case\r\namounted to $30.96 per acre.\r\n\r\nStill another gardener growing winter wheat followed by onions, and\r\nthese by cabbage, both transplanted, realized from the three crops a\r\ngross earning of $176.73, gold, per acre, and incurred an expense of\r\n$31.73 per acre for fertilizer and rent, leaving him a net earning\r\nof $145 per acre.\r\n\r\nThese old people have acquired the skill and practice of storing and\r\npreserving such perishable fruits as pears and grapes so as to\r\nenable them to keep them on the markets almost continuously. Pears\r\nwere very common in the latter part of June, and Consul-General\r\nWilliams informed me that grapes are regularly carried into July. In\r\ntalking with my interpreter as to the methods employed I could only\r\nlearn that the growers depend simply upon dry earth cellars which\r\ncan be maintained at a very uniform temperature, the separate fruits\r\nbeing wrapped in paper. No foreigner with whom we talked knew their\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nVegetables are carried through the winter in such earth cellars as\r\nare seen in Fig. 88, page 161, these being covered after they are\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nAs to the price of labor in this part of China, we learned through\r\nConsul-General Williams that a master mechanic may receive 50 cents,\r\nMexican, per day, and a journeyman 18 cents, or at a rate of 21.5\r\ncents and 7.75 cents, gold. Farm laborers receive from $20 to $30,\r\nMexican, or $8.60 to $12.90, gold, per year, with food, fuel and\r\npresents which make a total of $17.20 to $21.50. This is less for\r\nthe year than we pay for a month of probably less efficient labor.\r\nThere is relatively little child labor in China and this perhaps\r\nshould be expected when adult labor is so abundant and so cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nMANCHURIA AND KOREA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 39th parallel of latitude lies just south of Tientsin; followed\r\nwestward, it crosses the toe of Italy's boot, leads past Lisbon in\r\nPortugal, near Washington and St. Louis and to the north of\r\nSacramento on the Pacific. We were leaving a country with a mean\r\nJuly temperature of 80 deg F., and of 21 deg in January, but where\r\ntwo feet of ice may form; a country where the eighteen year mean\r\nmaximum temperature is 103.5 deg and the mean minimum 4.5 deg; where\r\ntwice in this period the thermometer recorded 113 deg above zero,\r\nand twice 7 deg below, and yet near the coast and in the latitude of\r\nWashington; a country where the mean annual rainfall is 19.72 inches\r\nand all but 3.37 inches falls in June, July, August and September.\r\nWe had taken the 5:40 A. M. Imperial North-China train, June 17th,\r\nto go as far northward as Chicago,--to Mukden in Manchuria, a\r\ndistance by rail of some four hundred miles, but all of the way\r\nstill across the northward extension of the great Chinese coastal\r\nplain. Southward, out from the coldest quarter of the globe, where\r\nthe mean January temperature is more than 40 deg below zero, sweep\r\nnortherly winds which bring to Mukden a mean January temperature\r\nonly 3 deg above zero, and yet there the July temperature averages\r\nas high as 77 deg and there is a mean annual rainfall of but 18.5\r\ninches, coming mostly in the summer, as at Tientsin.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rainfall of the northern extension of China's coastal\r\nplain is small, its efficiency is relatively high because of its\r\nmost favorable distribution and the high summer temperatures. In the\r\nperiod of early growth, April, May and June, there are 4.18 inches;\r\nbut in the period of maximum growth, July and August, the rainfall\r\nis 11.4 inches; and in the ripening period, September and October,\r\nit is 3.08 inches, while during the rest of the year but 1.06 inch\r\nfalls. Thus most of the rain comes at the time when the crops\r\nrequire the greatest daily consumption and it is least in\r\nmid-winter, during the period of little growth.\r\n\r\nAs our train left Tientsin we traveled for a long distance through a\r\ncountry agriculturally poor and little tilled, with surface flat,\r\nthe soil apparently saline, and the land greatly in need of\r\ndrainage. Wherever there were canals the crops were best, apparently\r\noccupying more or less continuous areas along either bank. The day\r\nwas hot and sultry but laborers were busy with their large hoes,\r\noften with all garments laid aside except a short shirt or a pair of\r\nroomy trousers.\r\n\r\nIn the salt district about the village of Tangku there were huge\r\nstacks of salt and smaller piles not yet brought together, with\r\nnumerous windmills, constituting most striking features in the\r\nlandscape, but there was almost no agricultural or other vegetation.\r\nBeyond Pehtang there are other salt works and a canal leads westward\r\nto Tientsin, on which the salt is probably taken thither, and still\r\nother salt stacks and windmills continued visible until near Hanku,\r\nwhere another canal leads toward Peking. Here the coast recedes\r\neastward from the railway and beyond the city limits many grave\r\nmounds dot the surrounding plains where herds of sheep were grazing.\r\n\r\nAs we hurried toward the delta region of the Lwan ho, and before\r\nreaching Tangshan, a more productive country was traversed. Thrifty\r\ntrees made the landscape green, and fields of millet, kaoliang and\r\nwheat stretched for miles together along the track and back over the\r\nflat plain beyond the limit of vision. Then came fields planted with\r\ntwo rows of maize alternating with one row of soy beans, but not\r\nover twenty-eight inches apart, one stalk of corn in a place every\r\nsixteen to eighteen inches, all carefully hoed, weedless and\r\nblanketed with an excellent earth mulch; but still the leaves were\r\ncurling in the intense heat of the sun. Tangshan is a large city,\r\napparently of recent growth on the railroad in a country where\r\nisolated conical hills rise one hundred or two hundred feet out of\r\nthe flat, plains. Cart loads of finely pulverized earth compost were\r\nhere moving to the fields in large numbers, being laid in single\r\npiles of five hundred to eight hundred pounds, forty to sixty feet\r\napart. At Kaiping the country grows a little rolling and we passed\r\nthrough the first railway cuts, six to eight feet deep, and the\r\nwater in the streams is running ten to twelve feet below the surface\r\nof the fields. On the right and beyond Kuyeh there are low hills,\r\nand here we passed enormous quantities of dry, finely powdered earth\r\ncompost, distributed on narrow unplanted area over the fields. What\r\ncrop, if indeed any, had occupied these areas this season, we could\r\nnot judge. The fertilization here is even more extensive and more\r\ngeneral than we found it in the Shantung province, and in places\r\nwater was being carried in pails to the fields for use either in\r\nplanting or in transplanting, to ensure the readiness of the new\r\ncrops to utilize the first rainfall when it comes.\r\n\r\nThen the bed of a nearly dry stream some three hundred feet wide was\r\ncrossed and beyond it a sandy plain was planted in long narrow\r\nfields between windbreak hedges. The crops were small but evidently\r\nimproved by the influence of the shelter. The sand in places had\r\ndrifted into the hedges to a height of three feet. At a number of\r\nother places along the way before Mukden was reached such protected\r\nareas were passed and oftenest on the north side of wide, now nearly\r\ndry, stream channels.\r\n\r\nAs we passed on toward Shanhaikwan we were carried over broad plains\r\neven more nearly level and unobstructed than any to be found in the\r\ncorn belt of the middle west, and these too planted with corn,\r\nkaoliang, wheat and beans, and with the low houses hidden in distant\r\nscattered clusters of trees dotting the wide plain on either side,\r\nwith not a fence, and nothing to suggest a road anywhere in sight.\r\nWe seemed to be moving through one vast field dotted with hundreds\r\nof busy men, a plowman here, and there a great cart hopelessly lost\r\nin the field so far as one could see any sign of road to guide their\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nSome early crop appeared to have been harvested from areas\r\nalternating with those on the ground, and these were dotted with\r\npiles of the soil and manure compost, aggregating hundreds of tons,\r\ndistributed over the fields but no doubt during the next three or\r\nfour days these thousands of piles would have been worked into the\r\nsoil and vanished from sight, to reappear after another crop and\r\nanother year.\r\n\r\nIt was at Lwanchow that we met the out-going tide of soy beans\r\ndestined for Japan and Europe, pouring in from the surrounding\r\ncountry in gunny sacks brought on heavy carts drawn by large mules,\r\nas seen in Fig. 203, and enormous quantities had been stacked in the\r\nopen along the tracks, with no shelter whatever, awaiting the\r\narrival of trains to move them to export harbors.\r\n\r\nThe planting here, as elsewhere, is in rows, but not of one kind of\r\ngrain. Most frequently two rows of maize, kaoliang or millet\r\nalternated with the soy beans and usually not more than twenty-eight\r\ninches apart, sharp high ridge cultivation being the general\r\npractice. Such planting secures the requisite sunshine with a larger\r\nnumber of plants on the field; it secures a continuous general\r\ndistribution of the roots of the nitrogen-fixing soy beans in the\r\nsoil of all the field every season, and permits the soil to be more\r\ncontinuously and more completely laid under tribute by the root\r\nsystems. In places where the stand of corn or millet was too open\r\nthe gaps were filled with the soy beans. Such a system of planting\r\npossibly permits a more immediate utilization of the nitrogen\r\ngathered from the soil air in the root nodules, as these die and\r\nundergo nitrification during the same season, while the crops are\r\nyet on the ground, and so far as phosphorus and potassium compounds\r\nare liberated by this decay, they too would become available to the\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe end of the day's journey was at Shanhaikwan on the boundary\r\nbetween Chihli and Manchuria, the train stopping at 6:20 P. M. for\r\nthe night. Stepping upon the veranda from our room on the second\r\nfloor of a Japanese inn in the early morning, there stood before us,\r\nsullen and grey, the eastern terminus of the Great Wall, winding\r\nfifteen hundred miles westward across twenty degrees of longitude,\r\nhaving endured through twenty-one centuries, the most stupendous\r\npiece of construction ever conceived by man and executed by a\r\nnation. More than twenty feet thick at the base and than twelve feet\r\non the top; rising fifteen to thirty feet above the ground with\r\nparapets along both faces and towers every two hundred yards rising\r\ntwenty feet higher, it must have been, for its time and the methods\r\nof warfare then practiced, when defended by their thousands, the\r\nboldest and most efficient national defense ever constructed. Nor in\r\nthe economy of construction and maintenance has it ever been\r\nequalled.\r\n\r\nEven if it be true that 20,000 masons toiled through ten years in\r\nits building, defended by 400,000 soldiers, fed by a commissariat of\r\n20,000 more and supported by 30,000 others in the transport, quarry\r\nand potters' service, she would then have been using less than eight\r\ntenths per cent of her population, on a basis of 60,000,000 at the\r\ntime; while according to Edmond Théry's estimate, the officers and\r\nsoldiers of Europe today, in time of peace, constitute one per cent\r\nof a population of 400,000,000 of people, and these, at only one\r\ndollar each per day for food, clothing and loss of producing power\r\nwould cost her nations, in ten years, more than $14,000 million.\r\nChina, with her present habits and customs, would more easily have\r\nmaintained her army of 470,000 men on thirty cents each per day, or\r\nfor a total ten-year cost of but $520,000,000. The French cabinet in\r\n1900 approved a naval program involving an expenditure of\r\n$600,000,000 during the next ten years, a tax of more than $15 for\r\nevery man, woman and child in the Republic.\r\n\r\nLeaving Shanhaikwan at 5:20 in the morning and reaching Mukden at\r\n6:30 in the evening, we rode the entire day through Manchurian\r\nfields. Manchuria has an area of 363,700 square miles, equal to that\r\nof both Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa combined. It has\r\nroughly the outline of a huge boot and could one slide it eastward\r\nuntil Port Arthur was at Washington, Shanhaikwan would fall well\r\ntoward Pittsburgh, both at the tip of the broad toe to the boot. The\r\nfoot would lie across Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and all of\r\nNew England, extending beyond New Brunswick with the heel in the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence. Harbin, at the instep of the boot, would lie\r\nfifty miles east of Montreal and the expanding leg would reach\r\nnorthwestward nearly to James Bay, entirely to the north of the\r\nOttawa river and the Canadian Pacific, spanning a thousand miles of\r\nlatitude and nine hundred miles of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe Liao plain, thirty miles wide, and the central Sungari plain,\r\nare the largest in Manchuria, forming together a long narrow valley\r\nfloor between two parallel mountain systems and extending\r\nnortheasterly from the Liao gulf, between Port Arthur and\r\nShanhaikwan, up the Liao river and down the Sungari to the Amur, a\r\ndistance of eight hundred or more miles. These plains have a\r\nfertile, deep soil and it is on them and other lesser river bottoms\r\nthat Manchurian agriculture is developed, supporting eight or nine\r\nmillion people on a cultivated, acreage possibly not greater than\r\n25,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nManchuria has great forest and grazing possibilities awaiting future\r\ndevelopment, as well as much mineral wealth. The population of\r\nTsitsihar, in the latitude of middle North Dakota, swells from\r\nthirty thousand to seventy thousand during September and October,\r\nwhen the Mongols bring in their cattle to market. In the middle\r\nprovince, at the head of steam navigation on the Sungari, because of\r\nthe abundance and cheapness of lumber, Kirin has become a\r\nshipbuilding center for Chinese junks. The Sungari-Milky-river, is a\r\nlarge stream carrying more water at flood season than the Amur above\r\nits mouth, the latter being navigable 450 miles for steamers drawing\r\ntwelve feet of water, and 1500 miles for those drawing four feet, so\r\nthat during the summer season the middle and northern provinces have\r\nnatural inland waterways, but the outlet to the sea is far to the\r\nnorth and closed by ice six months of the year.\r\n\r\nNot far beyond the Great Wall of China, fast falling into ruin,\r\npartly through the appropriation of its material for building\r\npurposes now that it has outlived its usefulness, another broad,\r\nnearly dry stream bed was crossed. There, in full bloom, was what\r\nappeared to be the wild white rose seen earlier, further south, west\r\nof Suchow, having a remarkable profusion of small white bloom in\r\nclusters resembling the Rambler rose. One of these bushes growing\r\nwild there on the bank of the canal had over spread a clump of trees\r\none of which was thirty feet in height, enveloping it in a mantle of\r\nbloom, as seen in the upper section of Fig. 204. The lower section\r\nof the illustration is a closer view showing the clusters. The stem\r\nof this rose, three feet above the ground, measured 14.5 inches in\r\ncircumference. If it would thrive in this country nothing could be\r\nbetter for parks and pleasure drives. Later on our journey we saw it\r\nmany times in bloom along the railway between Mukden and Antung, but\r\nnowhere attaining so large growth. The blossoms are scant\r\nthree-fourths inch in diameter, usually in compact clusters of three\r\nto eleven, sometimes in twos and occasionally standing singly. The\r\nleaves are five-foliate, sometimes trifoliate; leaflets broadly\r\nlanceolate, accuminate and finely serrate; thorns minute, recurrent\r\nand few, only on the smaller branches.\r\n\r\nIn a field beyond, a small donkey was drawing a stone roller three\r\nfeet long and one foot in diameter, firming the crests of narrow,\r\nsharp, recently formed ridges, two at a time. Millet, maize and\r\nkaoliang were here the chief crops. Another nearly dry stream was\r\ncrossed, where the fields became more rolling and much cut by deep\r\ngullies, the first instances we had seen in China except on the\r\nsteep hillsides about Tsingtao. Not all of the lands here were\r\ncultivated, and on the untilled areas herds of fifty to a hundred\r\ngoats, pigs, cattle, horses and donkeys were grazing.\r\n\r\nFields in Manchuria are larger than in China and some rows were a\r\nfull quarter of a mile long, so that cultivation was being done with\r\ndonkeys and cattle, and large numbers of men were working in gangs\r\nof four, seven, ten, twenty, and in one field as high as fifty,\r\nhoeing millet. Such a crew as the largest mentioned could probably\r\nbe hired at ten cents each, gold, per day, and were probably men\r\nfrom the thickly settled portions of Shantung who had left in the\r\nspring, expecting to return in September or October. Both laborers\r\nand working animals were taking dinner in the fields, and earlier in\r\nthe day we had seen several instances where hay and feed were being\r\ntaken to the field on a wooden sled, with the plow and other tools.\r\nAt noon this was serving as manger for the cattle, mules or donkeys.\r\n\r\nIn fields where the close, deep furrowing and ridging was being done\r\nthe team often consisted of a heavy ox and two small donkeys driven\r\nabreast, the three walking in adjacent rows, the plow following the\r\nox, or a heavy mule instead.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season had not begun and in many fields there was planting\r\nand transplanting where water was used in separate hills, sometimes\r\nbrought in pails from a nearby stream, and in other cases on carts\r\nprovided with tanks. Holes were made along the crests of the ridges\r\nwith the blade of a narrow hoe and a little water poured in each\r\nhill, from a dipper, before planting or setting. These must have\r\nbeen other instances where the farmers were willing to incur\r\nadditional labor to save time for the maturing of the crop by\r\nassisting germination in a soil too dry to make it certain until the\r\nrains came.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that the strong ridging and the close level rows\r\nso largely adopted here must have marked advantages in utilizing the\r\nrainfall, especially the portions coming early, and that later also\r\nif it should come in heavy showers. With steep narrow ridging, heavy\r\nrains would be shed at once to the bottom of the deep furrows\r\nwithout over-saturating the ridges, while the wet soil in the bottom\r\nof the furrows would favor deep percolation with lateral capillary\r\nflow taking place strongly under the ridges from the furrows,\r\ncarrying both moisture and soluble plant food where they will be\r\nmost completely and quickly available. When the rain comes in heavy\r\nshowers each furrow may serve as a long reservoir which will prevent\r\nwashing and at the same time permit quick penetration; the ridges\r\nnever becoming flooded or puddled, permit the soil air to escape\r\nreadily as the water from the furrows sinks, as it cannot easily do\r\nin flat fields when the rains fall rapidly and fill all of the soil\r\npores, thus closing them to the escape of air from below, which must\r\ntake place before the water can enter.\r\n\r\nWhen rows are only twenty-four to twenty-eight inches apart, ridging\r\nis not sufficiently more wasteful of soil moisture, through greater\r\nevaporation because of increased surface, to compensate for the\r\nother advantages gained, and hence their practice, for their\r\nconditions, appears sound.\r\n\r\nThe application of finely pulverized earth compost to fields to be\r\nplanted, and in some cases where the fields were already planted,\r\ncontinued general after leaving Shanhailkwan as it had been before.\r\nCompost stacks were common in yards wherever buildings were close\r\nenough to the track to be seen. Much of the way about one-third of\r\nthe fields were yet to be, or had just been, planted and in a great\r\nmajority of these compost fertilizer had been laid down for use on\r\nthem, or was being taken to them in large heavy carts drawn\r\nsometimes by three mules. Between Sarhougon and Ningyuenchow\r\nfourteen fields thus fertilized were counted in less than half a\r\nmile; ten others in the next mile; eleven in the mile and a quarter\r\nfollowing. In the next two miles one hundred fields were counted and\r\njust before reaching the station we counted during five minutes,\r\nwith watch in hand, ninety-five fields to be planted, upon which\r\nthis fertilizer had been brought. In some cases the compost was\r\nbeing spread in furrows between the rows of a last year's crop,\r\nevidently to be turned under, thus reversing the position of the\r\nridges.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Lienshan, where, the railway runs near the sea, a sail\r\nwas visible on the bay and many stacks of salt piled about the\r\nevaporation fields were associated with the revolving sail windmills\r\nalready described. Here, too, large numbers of cattle, horses, mules\r\nand donkeys were grazing on the untilled low lands, beyond which we\r\ntraversed a section where all fields were planted, where no\r\nfertilizer was piled in the field but where many groups of men were\r\nbusy hoeing, sometimes twenty in a gang.\r\n\r\nChinese soldiers with bayonetted guns stood guard at every railway\r\nstation between Shanhaikwan and Mukden, and from Chinchowfu our\r\ncoach was occupied by some Chinese official with guests and military\r\nattendants, including armed soldiers. The official and his guests\r\nwere an attractive group of men with pleasant faces and winning\r\nmanners, clad in many garments of richly figured silk of bright,\r\nattractive, but unobtrusive, colors, who talked, seriously or in\r\nmirth, almost incessantly. They took the train about one o'clock and\r\nlunch was immediately served in Chinese style, but the last course\r\nwas not brought until nearly four o'clock. At every station soldiers\r\nstood in line in the attitude of salute until the official car had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nJust before reaching Chinchowfu we saw the first planted fields\r\nlittered with stubble of the previous crop, and in many instances\r\nsuch stubble was being gathered and removed to the villages, large\r\nstacks having been piled in the yards to be used either as fuel or\r\nin the production of compost. As the train approached Taling ho\r\ngroups of men were hoeing in millet fields, thirty in one group on\r\none side and fifty in another body on the other. Many small herds of\r\ncattle, horses, donkeys and flocks of goats and sheep were feeding\r\nalong stream courses and on the unplanted fields. Beyond the\r\nstation, after crossing the river, still another sand dune tract was\r\npassed, planted with willows, millet occupying the level areas\r\nbetween the dunes, and not far beyond, wide untilled flats were\r\ncrossed, on which many herds were grazing and dotted with grave\r\nmounds as we neared Koupantze, where a branch of the railway\r\ntraverses the Liao plain to the port of Newchwang. It was in this\r\nregion that there came the first suggestion of resemblance to our\r\nmarshland meadows; and very soon there were seen approaching from\r\nthe distance loads so green that except for the large size one would\r\nhave judged them to be fresh grass. They were loads of cured hay in\r\nthe brightest green, the result, no doubt, of curing under their dry\r\nweather conditions.\r\n\r\nAt Ta Hu Shan large quantities of grain in sacks were piled along\r\nthe tracks and in the freight yards, but under matting shelters.\r\nNear here, too, large three-mule loads of dry earth compost were\r\ngoing to the fields and men were busy pulverizing and mixing it on\r\nthe threshing floors preparatory for use. Nearly all crops growing\r\nwere one or another of the millets, but considerable areas were yet\r\nunplanted and on these cattle, horses, mules and donkeys were\r\nfeeding and eight more loads of very bright new made hay crossed the\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nWhen the train reached Sinminfu where the railway turns abruptly\r\neastward to cross the Liao ho to reach Mukden we saw the first\r\nextensive massing of the huge bean cakes for export, together with\r\nenormous quantities of soy beans in sacks piled along the railway\r\nand in the freight yards or loaded on cars made up in trains ready\r\nto move. Leaving this station we passed among fields of grain\r\nlooking decidedly yellow, the first indication we had seen in China\r\nof crops nitrogen-hungry and of soils markedly deficient in\r\navailable nitrogen. Beyond the next station the fields were\r\ndecidedly spotted and uneven as well as yellow, recalling conditions\r\nso commonly seen at home and which had been conspicuously absent\r\nhere before. Crossing the Liao ho with its broad channel of shifting\r\nsands, the river carrying the largest volume of water we had yet\r\nseen, but the stream very low and still characteristic of the close\r\nof the dry season of semi-arid climates, we soon reached another\r\nstation where the freight yards and all of the space along the\r\ntracks were piled high with bean cakes and yet the fields about were\r\nreflecting the impoverished condition of the soil through the yellow\r\ncrops and their uneven growth on the fields.\r\n\r\nSince the Japanese-Russian war the shipments of soy beans and of\r\nbean cake from Manchuria have increased enormously. Up to this time\r\nthere had been exports to the southern provinces of China where the\r\nbean cakes were used as fertilizers for the rice fields, but the new\r\nextensive markets have so raised the price that in several instances\r\nwe were informed they could not then afford to use bean cake as\r\nfertilizer. From Newchwang alone, in 1905, between January 1st and\r\nMarch 31st, there went abroad 2,286,000 pounds of beans and bean\r\ncake, but in 1906 the amount had increased to 4,883,000 pounds. But\r\na report published in the Tientsin papers as official, while we were\r\nthere, stated that the value of the export of bean cake and soy\r\nbeans from Dalny for the months ending March 31st had been, in 1909,\r\nonly $1,635,000, gold, compared with $3,065,000 in the corresponding\r\nperiod of 1908, and of $5,120,000 in 1907, showing a marked\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nEdward C. Parker, writing from Mukden for the Review of Reviews,\r\nstated: \"The bean cake shipments from Newchwang, Dalny and Antung in\r\n1908 amounted to 515,198 tons; beans, 239,298 tons; bean oil, 1930\r\ntons; having a total value of $15,016,649 (U. S. gold)\". According\r\nto the composition of soy beans as indicated in Hopkins' table of\r\nanalyses, these shipments of beans and bean cake would remove an\r\naggregate of 6171 tons of phosphorus, 10,097 tons of potassium, and\r\n47,812 tons of nitrogen from Manchurian soils as the result of\r\nexport for that year. Could such a rate have been maintained during\r\ntwo thousand years there would have been sold from these soils\r\n20,194,000 tons of potassium; 12,342,000 tons of phosphorus and\r\n95,624,000 tons of nitrogen; and the phosphorus, were it thus\r\nexported, would have exceeded more than threefold all thus far\r\nproduced in the United States; it would have exceeded the world's\r\noutput in 1906 more than eighteen times, even assuming that all\r\nphosphate rock mined was seventy-five per cent pure.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the millets and the sorghums as the staple bread crops\r\nof northern China and Manchuria has been quite as remarkable as the\r\nselection of rice for the more southern latitudes, and the two\r\ntogether have played a most important part in determining the high\r\nmaintenance efficiency of these people. In nutritive value these\r\ngrains rank well with wheat; the stems of the larger varieties are\r\nextensively used for both fuel and building material and the smaller\r\nforms make excellent forage and have been used directly for\r\nmaintaining the organic content of the soil. Their rapid development\r\nand their high endurance of drought adapt them admirably to the\r\nclimate of north China and Manchuria where the rains begin only\r\nafter late June and where weather too cold for growth comes earlier\r\nin the fall. The quick maturity of these crops also permits them to\r\nbe used to great advantage even throughout the south, in their\r\nsystems of multiple cropping so generally adopted, while their great\r\nresistance to drought, being able to remain at a standstill for a\r\nlong time when the soil is too dry for growth and yet be able to\r\npush ahead rapidly when favorable rains come, permits them to be\r\nused on the higher lands generally where water is not available for\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nIn the Shantung province the large millet, sorghum or kaoliang,\r\nyields as high as 2000 to 3000 pounds of seed per acre, and 5600 to\r\n6000 pounds of air-dry stems, equal in weight to 1.6 to 1.7 cords of\r\ndry oak wood. In the region of Mukden, Manchuria, its average yield\r\nof seed is placed at thirty-five bushels of sixty pounds weight per\r\nacre, and with this comes one and a half tons of fuel or of building\r\nmaterial. Hosie states that, the kaoliang is the staple food of the\r\npopulation of Manchuria and the principal grain food of the work\r\nanimals. The grain is first washed in cold water and then poured\r\ninto a kettle with four times its volume of boiling water and cooked\r\nfor an hour, without salt, as with rice. It is eaten with chopsticks\r\nwith boiled or salted vegetables. He states that an ordinary servant\r\nrequires about two pounds of this grain per day, and that a workman\r\nat heavy labor will take double the amount. A Chinese friend of his,\r\nkeeping five servants, supplied them with 240 pounds of millet per\r\nmonth, together with 16 pounds of native flour, regarded as\r\nsufficient for two days, and meat for two days, the amount not being\r\nstated. Two of the small millets (Setaria italica, and Panicum\r\nmilliaceum), wheat, maize and buckwheat are other grains which are\r\nused as food but chiefly to give variety and change of diet.\r\n\r\nVery large quantities of matting and wrappings are also made from\r\nthe leaves of the large millet, which serve many purposes\r\ncorresponding with the rice mattings and bags of Japan and southern\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe small millets, in Shantung, yield as high as 2700 pounds of seed\r\nand 4800 pounds of straw per acre. In Japan, in the year 1906, there\r\nwere grown 737,719 acres of foxtail, barnyard and proso millet,\r\nyielding 17,084,000 bushels of seed or an average of twenty-three\r\nbushels per acre. In addition to the millets, Japan grew, the same\r\nyear, 5,964,300 bushels of buckwheat on 394,523 acres, or an average\r\nof fifteen bushels per acre. The next engraving, Fig. 205, shows a\r\ncrop of millet already six inches high planted between rows of\r\nwindsor beans which had matured about the middle of June. The leaves\r\nhad dropped, the beans had been picked from the stems, and a little\r\nlater, when the roots had had time to decay the bean stems would be\r\npulled and tied in bundles for use as fuel or for fertilizer.\r\n\r\nWe had reached Mukden thoroughly tired after a long day of\r\ncontinuous close observation and writing. The Astor House, where we\r\nwere to stop, was three miles from the station and the only\r\nconveyance to meet the train was a four-seated springless, open,\r\nsemi-baggage carryall and it was a full hour lumbering its way to\r\nour hotel. But here as everywhere in the Orient the foreigner meets\r\nscenes and phases of life competent to divert his attention from\r\nalmost any discomfort. Nothing could be more striking than the\r\npeculiar mode the Manchu ladies have of dressing their hair, seen in\r\nFig. 206, many instances of which were passed on the streets during\r\nthis early evening ride. It was fearfully and wonderfully done, laid\r\nin the smoothest, glossiest black, with nearly the lateral spread of\r\nthe tail of a turkey cock and much of the backward curve of that of\r\nthe rooster; far less attractive than the plainer, refined, modest,\r\nyet highly artistic style adopted by either Chinese or Japanese\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Mukden to Antung required two days, the train\r\nstopping for the night at Tsaohokow. Our route lay most of the way\r\nthrough mountainous or steep hilly country and our train was made up\r\nof diminutive coaches drawn by a tiny engine over a three-foot\r\ntwo-inch narrow gauge track of light rails laid by the Japanese\r\nduring the war with Russia, for the purpose of moving their armies\r\nand supplies to the hotly contested fields in the Liao and Sungari\r\nplains. Many of the grades were steep, the curves sharp, and in\r\nseveral places it was necessary to divide the short train to enable\r\nthe engines to negotiate them.\r\n\r\nTo the southward over the Liao plain the crops were almost\r\nexclusively millet and soy beans, with a little barley, wheat, and a\r\nfew oats. Between Mukden and the first station across the Hun river\r\nwe had passed twenty-four good sized fields of soy beans on one side\r\nof the river and twenty-two on the other, and before reaching the\r\nhilly country, after travelling a distance of possibly fifteen\r\nmiles, we had passed 309 other and similar fields close along the\r\ntrack. In this distance also we had passed two of the monuments\r\nerected by the Japanese, marking sites of their memorable battles.\r\nThese fields were everywhere flat, lying from sixteen to twenty feet\r\nabove the beds of the nearly dry streams, and the cultivation was\r\nmostly being done with horses or cattle.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the plains country the railway traversed a narrow\r\nwinding valley less than a mile wide, with gradient so steep that\r\nour train was divided. Fully sixty per cent of the hill slopes were\r\ncultivated nearly to the summit and yet rising apparently more than\r\none in three to five feet, and the uncultivated slopes were closely\r\nwooded with young trees, few more than twenty to thirty feet high,\r\nbut in blocks evidently of different ages. Beyond the pass many of\r\nthe cultivated slopes have walled terraces. We crossed a large\r\nstream where railway ties were being rafted down the river. Just\r\nbeyond this river the train was again divided to ascend a gradient\r\nof one in thirty, reaching the summit by five times switching back,\r\nand matched on the other side of the pass by a down grade of one in\r\nforty.\r\n\r\nAt many of the farm houses in the narrow valleys along the way large\r\nrectangular, flat topped compost piles were passed, thirty to forty\r\ninches high and twenty, thirty, forty and even in one case as much\r\nas sixty feet square on the ground. More and more it became evident\r\nthat these mountain and hill lands were originally heavily wooded\r\nand that the new growth springs up quickly, developing rapidly. It\r\nwas clear also that the custom of cutting over these wooded areas at\r\nfrequent intervals is very old, not always in the same stage of\r\ngrowth but usually when the trees are quite small. Considerable\r\nquantities of cordwood were piled at the stations along the railway\r\nand were being loaded on the cars. This was always either round wood\r\nor sticks split but once; and much charcoal, made mostly from round\r\nwood or sticks split but once, was being shipped in sacks shaped\r\nlike those used for rice, seen in Fig. 180. Some strips of the\r\nforest growth had been allowed to stand undisturbed apparently for\r\ntwenty or more years, but most areas have been cut at more frequent\r\nintervals, often apparently once in three to five, or perhaps ten,\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt several places on the rapid streams crossed, prototypes of the\r\nmodern turbine water-wheel were installed, doing duty grinding beans\r\nor grain. As with native machinery everywhere in China, these wheels\r\nwere reduced to the lowest terms and the principle put to work\r\nalmost unclothed. These turbines were of the downward discharge\r\ntype, much resembling our modern windmills, ten to sixteen feet in\r\ndiameter, set horizontally on a vertical axis rising through the\r\nfloor of the mill, with the vanes surrounded by a rim, the water\r\ndropping through the wheel, reacting when reflected from the\r\nobliquely set vanes. American engineers and mechanics would\r\npronounce these very crude, primitive and inefficient. A truer view\r\nwould regard them as examples of a masterful grasp of principle by\r\nsome, man who long ago saw the unused energy of the stream and\r\nsucceeded thus in turning it to account.\r\n\r\nBoth days of our journey had been bright and very warm and, although\r\nwe took the train early in the morning at Mukden, a young Japanese\r\nanticipated the heat, entering the train clad only in his kimono and\r\nsandals, carrying a suitcase and another bundle. He rode all day,\r\nthe most comfortably, if immodestly, clad man on the train, and the\r\nnext morning took his seat in front of us clad in the same garb, but\r\nbefore the train reached Antung he took down his suitcase and then\r\nand there, deliberately attired himself in a good foreign suit,\r\nfolding his kimono and packing it away with his sandals.\r\n\r\nFrom Antung we crossed the Yalu on the ferry to New Wiju at 6:30 A.\r\nM., June 22, and were then in quite a different country and among a\r\nvery different people, although all of the railway officials,\r\nemployes, police and guards were Japanese, as they had been from\r\nMukden. At Antung and New Wiju the Yalu is a very broad slow stream\r\nresembling an arm of the sea more than a river, reminding one of the\r\nSt. Johns at Jacksonville, Florida.\r\n\r\nJune 22nd proved to be one of the national festival days in Korea,\r\ncalled \"Swing day\", and throughout our entire ride to Seoul the\r\nfields were nearly all deserted and throngs of people, arrayed in\r\ngala dress, appeared all along the line of the railway, sometimes\r\ncongregating in bodies of two to three thousand or more, as seen in\r\nFig. 207. Many swings had been hung and were being enjoyed by the\r\nyoung people. Boys and men were bathing in all sorts of \"swimming\r\nholes\" and places. So too, there were many large open air gatherings\r\nbeing addressed by public speakers, one of which is seen in Fig.\r\n208.\r\n\r\nNearly everyone was dressed in white outer garments made from some\r\nfabric which although not mosquito netting was nearly as open and\r\npossessed of a remarkable stiffness which seemed to take and retain\r\nevery dent with astonishing effect and which was sufficiently\r\ntransparent to reveal a third undergarment. The full outstanding\r\nskirts of five Korean women may be seen in Fig. 209, and the\r\ntrousers which went with these were proportionately full but tied\r\nclose about the ankles. The garments seemed to be possessed of a\r\npowerful repulsion which held them quite apart and away from the\r\nperson, no doubt contributing much to comfort. It was windy but one\r\nof those hot sultry, sticky days, and it made one feel cool to see\r\nthese open garments surging in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe Korean men, like the Chinese, wear the hair long but not braided\r\nin a queue. No part of the head is shaved but the hair is wound in a\r\ntight coil on the top of the head, secured by a pin which, in the\r\ncase of the Korean who rode in our coach from Mukden to Antung, was\r\na modern, substantial tenpenny wire nail. The tall, narrow, conical\r\ncrowns of the open hats, woven from thin bamboo splints, are\r\nevidently designed to accommodate this style of hair dressing as\r\nwell as to be cool.\r\n\r\nHere, too, as in China and Manchuria, nearly all crops are planted\r\nin rows, including the cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats.\r\nWe traversed first a flat marshy country with sandy soil and water\r\nnot more than four feet below the surface where, on the lowest areas\r\na close ally of our wild flower-de-luce was in bloom. Wheat was\r\ncoining into head but corn and millet were smaller than in\r\nManchuria. We had left New Wiju at 7:30 in the morning and at 8:15\r\nwe passed from the low land into a hill country with narrow valleys.\r\nScattering young pine, seldom more than ten to twenty-five feet\r\nhigh, occupied the slopes and as we came nearer the hills were seen\r\nto be clothed with many small oak, the sprouts clearly not more than\r\none or two years old. Roofs of dwellings in the country were usually\r\nthatched with straw laid after the manner of shingles, as may be\r\nseen in Fig. 210, where the hills beyond show the low tree growth\r\nreferred to, but here unusually dense. Bundles of pine boughs,\r\nstacked and sheltered from the weather, were common along the way\r\nand evidently used for fuel.\r\n\r\nAt 8:25 we passed through the first tunnel and there were many along\r\nthe route, the longest requiring thirty seconds for the passing of\r\nthe train. The valley beyond was occupied by fields of wheat where\r\nbeans were planted between the rows. Thus far none of the fields had\r\nbeen as thoroughly tilled and well cared for as those seen in China,\r\nnor were the crops as good. Further along we passed hills where the\r\npines were all of two ages, one set about thirty feet high and the\r\nothers twelve to fifteen feet or less, and among these were numerous\r\noak sprouts. Quite possibly these are used as food for the wild\r\nsilkworms. In some places appearances indicate that the oak and\r\nother deciduous growth, with the grass, may be cut annually and only\r\nthe pines allowed to stand for longer periods. As we proceeded\r\nsouthward and had passed Kosui the young oak sprouts were seen to\r\ncover the hills, often stretching over the slopes much like a\r\nregular crop, standing at a height of two to four feet, and fresh\r\nbundles of these sprouts were seen at houses along the foot of the\r\nslopes, again suggesting that the leaves may be for the tussur\r\nsilkworms although the time appears late for the first moulting.\r\nAfter we had left Seoul, entering the broader valleys where rice was\r\nmore extensively grown, the using of the oak boughs and green grass\r\nbrought down from the hill lands for green manure became very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nAfter the winter and early spring crops have been harvested the\r\nnarrow ridges on which they are grown are turned into the furrows by\r\nmeans of their simple plow drawn by a heavy bullock, different from\r\nthe cattle in China but closely similar to those in Japan. The\r\nfields are then flooded until they have the appearance seen in Fig.\r\n12. Over these flooded ridges the green grass and oak boughs are\r\nspread, when the fields are again plowed and the material worked\r\ninto the wet soil. If this working is not completely successful men\r\nenter the fields and tramp the surface until every twig and blade is\r\nsubmerged. The middle section in this illustration has been fitted\r\nand transplanted; in front of it and on the left are two other\r\nfields once plowed but not fertilized; those far to the right have\r\nhad the green manure applied and the ground plowed a second time but\r\nnot finished, and in the immediate foreground the grass and boughs\r\nhave been scattered but the second plowing is not yet done.\r\n\r\nWe passed men and bullocks coming from the hill lands loaded with\r\nthis green herbage and as we proceeded towards Fusan more and more\r\nof the hill area was being made to contribute materials for green\r\nmanure for the cultivated fields. The foreground of Fig. 211 had\r\nbeen thus treated and so had the field in Fig. 212, where the man\r\nwas engaged in tramping the dressing beneath the surface. In very\r\nmany cases this material was laid along the margin of the paddies;\r\nin other cases it had been taken upon the fields as soon as the\r\ngrain was cut and was lying in piles among the bundles; while in\r\nstill other cases the material for green manure had been carried\r\nbetween the rows while the grain was still standing, but nearly\r\nready to harvest. In some fields a full third of a bushel of the\r\ngreen stuff had been laid down at intervals of three feet over the\r\nwhole area. In other cases piles of ashes alternated with those of\r\nherbage, and again manure and ashes mixed had been distributed in\r\nalternate piles with the green manure.\r\n\r\nIn still other cases we saw untreated straw distributed through the\r\nfields awaiting application. At Shindo this, straw had the\r\nappearance of having been dipped in or smeared with some mixture,\r\napparently of mud and ashes or possibly of some compost which had\r\nbeen worked into a thin paste with water.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Keizan, mountain herbage had been brought down from\r\nthe hills in large bales on cleverly constructed racks saddled to\r\nthe backs of bullocks, and in one field we saw a man who had just\r\ncome to his little field with an enormous load borne upon his\r\neasel-like packing appliance. Thus we find the Koreans also adopting\r\nthe rice crop, which yields heavily under conditions of abundant\r\nwater; we find them supplementing a heavy summer rainfall with water\r\nfrom their hills, and bringing to their fields besides both green\r\nherbage for humus and organic matter, and ashes derived from the\r\nfuel coming also from the hills, in these ways making good the\r\nunavoidable losses, through intense cropping.\r\n\r\nThe amount of forest growth in Korea, as we saw it, in proximity to\r\nthe cultivated valleys, is nowhere large and is fairly represented\r\nin Figs. 210, 213 and 214. There were clear evidences of periodic\r\ncutting and considerable, amounts of cordwood split from timber a\r\nfoot through were being brought to the stations on the backs of\r\ncattle. In some places there was evident and occasionally very\r\nserious soil erosion, as may be seen in Fig. 214, one such region\r\nbeing passed just before reaching Kinusan, but generally the hills\r\nare well rounded and covered with a low growth of shrubs and\r\nherbaceous plants.\r\n\r\nSouthernmost Korea has the latitude of the northern boundary of\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, while the\r\nnortheast corner attains that of Madison, Wisconsin, and the\r\nnorthern boundary of Nebraska, the country thus spanning some nine\r\ndegrees and six hundred miles of latitude. It has an area of some\r\n82,000 square miles, about equaling the state of Minnesota, but much\r\nof its surface is occupied by steep hill and mountain land. The\r\nrainy season had not yet set in, June 23rd. Wheat and the small\r\ngrains were practically all harvested southward of Seoul and the\r\npeople were everywhere busy with their flails threshing in the open,\r\nabout the dwellings or in the fields, four flails often beating\r\ntogether on the same lot of grain. As we journeyed southward the\r\nvalleys and the fields became wider and more extensive, and the\r\ncrops, as well as the cultural methods, were clearly much better.\r\n\r\nNeither the foot-power, animal-power, nor the wooden chain pump of\r\nthe Chinese were observed in Korea in use for lifting water, but we\r\nsaw many instances of the long handled, spoonlike swinging scoop\r\nhung over the water by a cord from tall tripods, after the manner\r\nseen in Fig. 215, each operated by one man and apparently with high\r\nefficiency for low lifts. Two instances also were observed of the\r\nform of lift seen in Fig. 173, where the man walks the circumference\r\nof the wheel, so commonly observed in Japan. Much hemp was being\r\ngrown in southern Korea but everywhere on very small isolated areas\r\nwhich flecked the landscape with the deepest green, each little\r\nfield probably representing the crop of a single family.\r\n\r\nIt was 6:30 P. M. when our train reached Fusan after a hot and dusty\r\nride. The service had been good and fairly comfortable but the\r\nice-water tanks of American trains were absent, their place being\r\nsupplied by cooled bottled waters of various brands, including\r\nsoda-water, sold by Japanese boys at nearly every important station.\r\nClose connection was made by trains with steamers to and from Japan\r\nand we went directly on board the Iki Maru which was to weigh anchor\r\nfor Moji and Shimonoseki at 8 P. M. Although small, the steamer was\r\nwell equipped, providing the best of service. We were fortunate in\r\nhaving a smooth passage, anchoring at 6:30 the next morning and\r\nmaking close connection with the train for Nagasaki, landing at the\r\nwharf with the aid of a steam launch.\r\n\r\nOur ride by train through the island of Kyushu carried us through\r\nscenes not widely different from those we had just left. The journey\r\nwas continuously among fields of rice, with Korean features strongly\r\nmarked but usually under better and more intensified culture, and\r\nthe season, too, was a little more advanced. Here the plowing was\r\nbeing done mostly with horses instead of the heavy bullocks so\r\nexclusively employed in Korea. Coming from China into Korea, and\r\nfrom there into Japan, it appeared very clear that in agricultural\r\nmethods and appliances the Koreans and Japanese are more closely\r\nsimilar than the Chinese and Koreans, and the more we came to see of\r\nthe Japanese methods the more strongly the impression became fixed\r\nthat the Japanese had derived their methods either from the Koreans\r\nor the Koreans had taken theirs more largely from Japan than from\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nIt was on this ride from Moji to Nagasaki that we were introduced to\r\nthe attractive and very satisfactory manner of serving lunches to\r\ntravelers on the trains in Japan. At important stations hot tea is\r\nbrought to the car windows in small glazed, earthenware teapots\r\nprovided with cover and bail, and accompanied with a teacup of the\r\nsame ware. The set and contents could be purchased for five sen, two\r\nand a half cents, our currency. All tea is served without milk or\r\nsugar. The lunches were very substantial and put together in a neat\r\nsanitary manner in a three-compartment wooden box, carefully made\r\nfrom clear lumber joined with wooden pegs and perfect joints. Packed\r\nin the cover we found a paper napkin, toothpicks and a pair of\r\nchopsticks. In the second compartment there were thin slices of\r\nmeat, chicken and fish, together with bamboo sprouts, pickles, cakes\r\nand small bits of salted vegetables, while the lower and chief\r\ncompartment was filled with rice cooked quite stiff and without\r\nsalt, as is the custom in the three countries. The box was about six\r\ninches long, four inches deep and three and a half inches wide.\r\nThese lunches are handed to travelers neatly wrapped in spotless\r\nthin white paper daintily tied with a bit of color, all in exchange\r\nfor 25 sen,--12.5 cents. Thus for fifteen cents the traveler is\r\nhanded, through the car window, in a respectful manner, a square\r\nmeal which he may eat at his leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nRETURN TO JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had returned to Japan in the midst of the first rainy season, and\r\nall the day through, June 25th, and two nights, a gentle rain fell\r\nat Nagasaki, almost without interruption. Across the narrow street\r\nfrom Hotel Japan were two of its guest houses, standing near the\r\nfront of a wall-faced terrace rising twenty-eight feet above the\r\nstreet and facing the beautiful harbor. They were accessible only by\r\nwinding stone steps shifting on paved landings to continue the\r\nascent between retaining walls overhung with a wealth of shrubbery\r\nclothed in the densest foliage, so green and liquid in the drip of\r\nthe rain, that one almost felt like walking edgewise amid stairs\r\nlest the drip should leave a stain. Over such another series of\r\nsteps, but longer and more winding, we found our way to the American\r\nConsulate where in the beautifully secluded quarters Consul-General\r\nScidmore escaped many annoyances of settling the imagined petty\r\ngrievances arising between American tourists and the ricksha boys.\r\n\r\nThrough the kind offices of the Imperial University of Sapporo and\r\nof the National Department of Agriculture and Commerce, Professor\r\nTokito met us at Nagasaki, to act as escort through most of the\r\njourney in Japan. Our first visit was to the prefectural\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station at Nagasaki. There are four others\r\nin the four main islands, one to an average area of 4280 square\r\nmiles, and to each 1,200,000 people. The island of Kyushu, whose\r\nlatitude is that of middle Mississippi and north Louisiana, has two\r\nrice harvests, and gardeners at Nagasaki grow three crops, each\r\nyear. The gardener and his family work about five tan, or a little\r\nless than one and one-quarter acres, realizing an annual return of\r\nsome $250 per acre. To maintain these earnings fertilizers are\r\napplied rated worth $60 per acre, divided between the three crops,\r\nthe materials used being largely the wastes of the city, animal\r\nmanure, mud from the drains, fuel ashes and sod, all composted\r\ntogether. If this expenditure for fertilizers appears high it must\r\nbe remembered that nearly the whole product is sold and that there\r\nare three crops each year. Such intense culture requires a heavy\r\nreturn if large yields are maintained. Good agricultural lands were\r\nhere valued at 300 yen per tan, approximately $600 per acre.\r\n\r\nWhen returning toward Moji to visit the Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation of Fukuoka prefecture, the rice along the first portion of\r\nthe route was standing about eight inches above the water. Large\r\nlotus ponds along the way occupied areas not readily drained, and\r\nthe fringing fields between the rice paddies and the untilled hill\r\nlands were bearing squash, maize, beans and Irish potatoes. Many\r\nsmall areas had been set to sweet potatoes on close narrow ridges,\r\nthe tops of which were thinly strewn with green grass, or sometimes\r\nwith straw or other litter, for shade and to prevent the soil from\r\nwashing and baking in the hot sun after rains. At Kitsu we passed\r\nnear Government salt works, for the manufacture of salt by the\r\nevaporation of sea water, this industry in Japan, as in China, being\r\na Government monopoly.\r\n\r\nMany bundles of grass and other green herbage were collected along\r\nthe way, gathered for use in the rice fields. In other cases the\r\ngreen manure had already been spread over the flooded paddies and\r\nwas being worked beneath the surface, as seen in Fig. 216. At this\r\ntime the hill lands were clothed in the richest, deepest green but\r\nthe tree growth was nowhere large except immediately about temples,\r\nand was usually in distinct small areas with sharp boundaries\r\noccasioned by differences in age. Some tracts had been very recently\r\ncut; others were in their second, third or fourth years; while\r\nothers still carried a growth of perhaps seven to ten years. At one\r\nvillage many bundles of the brush fuel had been gathered from an\r\nadjacent area, recently cleared.\r\n\r\nA few fields were still bearing their crop of soy beans planted in\r\nFebruary between rows of grain, and the green herbage was being\r\nworked into the flooded soil, for the crop of rice. Much compost,\r\nbrought to the fields, was stacked with layers of straw between,\r\nlaid straight, the alternate courses at right angles, holding the\r\npiles in rectangular form with vertical sides, some of which were\r\nfour to six feet high and the layers of compost about six inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nJust before reaching Tanjiro, a region is passed where orchards of\r\nthe candleberry tree occupy high leveled areas between rice paddies,\r\nafter the manner described for the mulberry orchards in Chekiang,\r\nChina. These trees, when seen from a distance, have quite the\r\nappearance of our apple orchards.\r\n\r\nAt the Fukuoka Experiment Station we learned that the usual depth of\r\nplowing for the rice fields is three and a half to four and a half\r\ninches, but that deeper plowing gives somewhat larger yields. As an\r\naverage of five years trials, a depth of seven to eight inches\r\nincreased the yield from seven to ten per cent over that of the\r\nusual depth. In this prefecture grass from the bordering hill lands\r\nis applied to the rice fields at rates ranging from 3300 to 16,520\r\npounds green weight per acre, and, according to analyses given,\r\nthese amounts would carry to, the fields from 18 to 90 pounds of\r\nnitrogen; 12.4 to 63.2 pounds of potassium, and 2.1 to 10.6 pounds\r\nof phosphorus per acre.\r\n\r\nWhere bean cake is used as a fertilizer the applications may be at\r\nthe rate of 496 pounds per acre, carrying 33.7 pounds of nitrogen,\r\nnearly 5 pounds of phosphorus and 7.4 pounds of potassium. The earth\r\ncomposts are chiefly applied to the dry land fields and then only\r\nafter they are well rotted, the fermentation being carried through\r\nat least sixty days, during which the material is turned three times\r\nfor aeration, the work being done at the home. When used on the rice\r\nfields where water is abundant the composts are applied in a less\r\nfermented condition.\r\n\r\nThe best yields of rice in this prefecture are some eighty bushels\r\nper acre, and crops of barley may even exceed this, the two crops\r\nbeing grown the same year, the rice following the barley. In most\r\nparts of Japan the grain food of the laboring people is about 70 per\r\ncent naked barley mixed with 30 per cent of rice, both cooked and\r\nused in the same manner. The barley has a lower market value and its\r\nuse permits a larger share of the rice to be sold as a money crop.\r\n\r\nThe soils are fertilized for each crop every year and the\r\nprescription for barley and rice recommended by the Experiment\r\nStation, for growers in this prefecture, is indicated by the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n\r\n         FERTILIZATION FOR NAKED BARLEY.\r\n                    Pounds per acre.\r\n Fertilizers.

The crop yields which have\r\nbeen associated with these applications on the Station fields are\r\nabout forty-nine bushels of barley and fifty bushels of rice per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThe general rotation recommended for this portion of Japan covers\r\nfive years and consists of a crop of wheat or naked barley the first\r\ntwo years with rice as the summer crop; in the third year genge,\r\n\"pink clover\" (Astragalus sinicus) or some other legume for green\r\nmanure is the winter crop, rice following in the summer; the fourth\r\nyear rape is the winter crop, from which the seed is saved and the\r\nash of the stems returned to the soil, or rarely the stems\r\nthemselves may be turned under; on the fifth and last year of the\r\nrotation the broad kidney or windsor bean is the winter crop,\r\npreceding the summer crop of rice. This rotation is not general yet\r\nin the practice of the farmers of the section, they choosing rape or\r\nbarley and in February plant windsor or soy beans between the rows\r\nfor green manure to use when the rice comes on.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from our observations that the use of composts in\r\nfertilizing was very much more general and extensive in China than\r\nit was in either Korea or Japan, but, to encourage the production\r\nand use of compost fertilizers, this and other prefectures have\r\nprovided subsidies which permit the payment of $2.50 annually to\r\nthose farmers who prepare and use on their land a compost heap\r\ncovering twenty to forty square yards, in accordance with specified\r\ndirections given.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural college at Fukuoka was not in session the day of\r\nour visit, it being a holiday usually following the close of the\r\nlast transplanting season. One of the main buildings of the station\r\nand college is seen in Fig. 217, and Figs. 218, 219 and 220, placed\r\ntogether from left to right in the order of their numbers, form a\r\npanoramic view of the station grounds and buildings with something\r\nof the beautiful landscape setting. There is nowhere in Japan the\r\nlavish expenditure of money on elaborate and imposing architecture\r\nwhich characterizes American colleges and stations, but in equipment\r\nfor research work, both as to professional staff and appliances,\r\nthey compare favorably with similar institutions in America. The\r\ndormitory system was in vogue in the college, providing room and\r\nboard at eight yen per month or four dollars of our currency. Eight\r\nstudents were assigned to one commodious room, each provided with a\r\nstudy table, but beds were mattresses spread upon the matting floor\r\nat night and compactly stored on closet shelves during the day.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese plow, which is very similar to the Korean type, may be\r\nseen in Fig. 221, the one on the right costing 2.5 yen and the other\r\n2 yen. With the aid of the single handle and the sliding rod held in\r\nthe right hand, the course of the plow is directed and the plow\r\ntilted in either direction, throwing the soil to the right or the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe nursery beds for rice breeding experiments and variety tests by\r\nthis station are shown in Fig. 222. Although these plots are flooded\r\nthe marginal plants, adjacent to the free water paths, were\r\nmaterially larger than those within and had a much deeper green\r\ncolor, showing better feeding, but what seemed most strange was the\r\nfact that these stronger plants are never used in transplanting, as\r\nthey do not thrive as well as those less vigorous.\r\n\r\nWe left the island of Kyushu in the evening of June 29th, crossing\r\nto the main island of Honshu, waiting in Shimonoseki for the morning\r\ntrain. The rice-planted valleys near Shimonoseki were relatively\r\nbroad and the paddies had all been recently set in close rows about\r\na foot apart and in hills in the rows. Mountain and hill lands were\r\nclosely wooded, largely with coniferous trees about the base but\r\ntoward and at the summits, especially on the South slopes, they were\r\ngreen only with herbage cut for fertilizing and feeding stock. Many\r\nvery small trees, often not more than one foot high, were growing on\r\nthe recently cut-over areas; tall slender graceful bamboos clustered\r\nalong the way and everywhere threw wonderful beauty into the\r\nlandscape. Cartloads of their slender stems, two to four inches in\r\ndiameter at the base and twenty or more feet long, were moving along\r\nthe generally excellent, narrow, seldom fenced roads, such as seen\r\nin Fig. 223. On the borders and pathways between rice paddies many\r\nsmall stacks of straw were in waiting to be laid between the rows of\r\ntransplanted rice, tramped beneath the water and overspread with mud\r\nto enrich the soil. The farmers here, as elsewhere, must contend\r\nagainst the scouring rush, varieties of grass and our common\r\npigweeds, even in the rice fields. The large area of mountain and\r\nhill land compared with that which could be tilled, and the\r\nrelatively small area of cultivated land not at this time under\r\nwater and planted to rice persisted throughout the journey.\r\n\r\nIf there could be any monotony for the traveller new to this land of\r\nbeauty it must result from the quick shifting of scenes and in the\r\nway the landscapes are pieced together, out-doing the craziest\r\npatchwork woman ever attempted; the bits are almost never large;\r\nthey are of every shape, even puckered and crumpled and tilted at\r\nall angles. Here is a bit of the journey: Beyond Habu the foothills\r\nare thickly wooded, largely with conifers. The valley is extremely\r\nnarrow with only small areas for rice. Bamboo are growing in\r\ncongenial places and we pass bundles of wood cut to stove length, as\r\nseen in Fig. 224. Then we cross a long narrow valley practically all\r\nin rice, and then another not half a mile wide, just before reaching\r\nAsa. Beyond here the fields become limited in area with the\r\nbordering low hills recently cut over and a new growth springing up\r\nover them in the form of small shrubs among which are many pine. Now\r\nwe are in a narrow valley between small rice fields or with none at\r\nall, but dash into one more nearly level with wide areas in rice\r\nchiefly on one side of the track just before reaching Onoda at 10:30\r\nA. M. and continuing three minutes ride beyond, when we are again\r\nbetween hills without fields and where the trees are pine with\r\nclumps of bamboo. In four minutes more we are among small rice\r\npaddies and at 10:35 have passed another gap and are crossing\r\nanother valley checkered with rice fields and lotus ponds, but in\r\none minute more the hills have closed in, leaving only room for the\r\ntrack. At 10:37 we are running along a narrow valley with its\r\nterraced rice paddies where many of the hills show naked soil among\r\nthe bamboo, scattering pine and other small trees; then we are out\r\namong garden patches thickly mulched with straw. At 10:38 we are\r\nbetween higher hills with but narrow areas for rice stretching close\r\nalong the track, but in two minutes these are passed and we are\r\namong low hills with terraced dry fields. At 10:42 we are spinning\r\nalong the level valley with its rice, but are quickly out again\r\namong hills with naked soil where erosion was marked. This is just\r\nbefore passing Funkai where we are following the course of a stream\r\nsome sixty feet wide with but little cultivated land in small areas.\r\nAt 10:47 we are again passing narrow rice fields near the track\r\nwhere the people are busy weeding with their hands, half knee-deep\r\nin water. At 10:53 we enter a broader valley stretching far to the\r\nsouth and seaward, but we had crossed it in one minute, shot through\r\nanother gap, and at 10:55 are traversing a much broader valley\r\nlargely given over to rice, but where some of the paddies were\r\nbearing matting rush set in rows and in hills after the manner of\r\nrice. It is here we pass Oyou and just beyond cross a stream\r\nconfined between levees built some distance back from either bank.\r\nAt 11:17 this plain is left and we enter a narrow valley without\r\nfields. Thus do most of the agricultural lands of Japan lie in the\r\nnarrowest valleys, often steeply sloping, and into which jutting\r\nspurs create the greatest irregularity of boundary and slope.\r\n\r\nThe journey of this day covered 350 miles in fourteen hours, all of\r\nthe way through a country of remarkable and peculiar beauty which\r\ncan be duplicated nowhere outside the mountainous, rice-growing\r\nOrient and there only during fifteen days closing the transplanting\r\nseason. There were neither high mountains nor broad valleys, no\r\ngreat rivers and but few lakes; neither rugged naked rocks, tall\r\nforest trees nor wide level fields reaching away to unbroken\r\nhorizons. But the low, rounded, soil-mantled mountain tops clothed\r\nin herbaceous and young forest growth fell everywhere into lower\r\nhills and these into narrow steep valleys which dropped by a series\r\nof water-level benches, as seen in Fig. 225, to the main river\r\ncourses. Each one of these millions of terraces, set about by its\r\nraised rim, was a silvery sheet of water dotted in the daintiest\r\nmanner with bunches of rice just transplanted, but not so close nor\r\nyet so high and over-spreading as to obscure the water, yet quite\r\nenough to impart to the surface a most delicate sheen of green; and\r\nthe grass-grown narrow rims retaining the water in the basins,\r\ncemented them into series of the most superb mosaics, shaped into\r\nthe valley bottoms by artizan artists perhaps two thousand years\r\nbefore and maintained by their descendants through all the years\r\nsince, that on them the rains and fertility from the mountains and\r\nthe sunshine from heaven might be transformed by the rice plant into\r\nfood for the families and support for the nation. Two weeks earlier\r\nthe aspect of these landscapes was very different, and two weeks\r\nlater the reflecting water would lie hidden beneath the growing and\r\nrapidly developing mantle of green, to go on changing until autumn,\r\nwhen all would be overspread with the ripened harvest of grain. And\r\nwhat intensified the beauty of it all was the fact that only along\r\nthe widest valley bottoms were the mosaics level, except the water\r\nsurface of each individual unit and these were always small. At one\r\ntime we were riding along a descending series of steps and then\r\nalong another rising through a winding valley to disappear around a\r\nprojecting spur, and anywhere in the midst of it all might be\r\nstanding Japanese cottages or villas with the water and the growing\r\nrice literally almost against the walls, as seen in Fig. 226, while\r\na near-by high terrace might hold its water on a level with the\r\nchimney-tops. Can one wonder that the Japanese loves his country or\r\nthat they are born and bred landscape artists?\r\n\r\nJust before reaching Hongo there were considerable areas thrown into\r\nlong narrow, much-raised, east and west beds under covers of straw\r\nmatting inclined at a slight angle toward the south, some two feet\r\nabove the ground but open toward the north. What crop may have been\r\ngrown here we did not learn but the matting was apparently intended\r\nfor shade, as it was hot midsummer weather, and we suspect it may\r\nhave been ginseng. It was here, too, that we came into the region of\r\nthe culture of matting rush, extensively grown in Hiroshima and\r\nOkayama prefectures, but less extensively all over the empire. As\r\nwith rice, the rush is first grown in nursery beds from which it is\r\ntransplanted to the paddies, one acre of nursery supplying\r\nsufficient stock for ten acres of field. The plants are set twenty\r\nto thirty stalks in a hill in rows seven inches apart with the hills\r\nsix inches from center to center in the row. Very high fertilization\r\nis practiced, costing from 120 to 240 yen per acre, or $60 to $120\r\nannually, the fertilizer consisting of bean cake and plant ashes, or\r\nin recent years, sometimes of sulphate of ammonia for nitrogen, and\r\nsuperphosphate of lime. About ten per cent of the amount of\r\nfertilizer required for the crop is applied at the time of fitting\r\nthe ground, the balance being administered from time to time as the\r\nseason advances. Two crops of the rush may be taken from the same\r\nground each year or it is grown in rotation with rice, but most\r\nextensively on the lands less readily drained and not so well suited\r\nfor other crops. Fields of the rush, growing in alternation with\r\nrice, are seen in Fig. 45, and in Fig. 227, with the Government salt\r\nfields lying along the seashore beyond.\r\n\r\nWith the most vigorous growth the rush attain a height exceeding\r\nthree feet and the market price varies materially with the length of\r\nthe stems. Good yields, under the best culture, may be as high as\r\n6.5 tons per acre of the dry stems but the average yield is less,\r\nthat of 1905 being 8531 pounds, for 9655 acres, The value of the\r\nproduct ranges from $120 to $200 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is from this material that mats are woven in standard sizes, to\r\nbe laid over padding, upholstering the floors which are the seats of\r\nall classes in Japan, used in the manner seen in Fig. 228 and in\r\nFig. 229, which is a completely furnished guest room in a first\r\nclass Japanese inn, finished in natural unvarnished wood, with walls\r\nof sliding panels of translucent paper, which may open upon a porch,\r\ninto a hallway or into another apartment; and with its bouquet,\r\nwhich may consist of a single large shapely branch of the purple\r\nleaved maple, having the cut end charred to preserve it fresh for a\r\nlonger time, standing in water in the vase.\r\n\r\n\"Two little maids I've heard of, each with a pretty taste, Who had\r\ntwo little rooms to fix and not an hour to waste. Eight thousand\r\nmiles apart they lived, yet on the selfsame day The one in Nikko's\r\nnarrow streets, the other on Broadway, They started out, each happy\r\nmaid her heart's desire to find, And her own dear room to furnish\r\njust according to her mind.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice went a-shopping, she bought a bed of brass, A bureau and\r\nsome chairs and things and such a lovely glass To reflect her little\r\nfigure--with two candle brackets near-- And a little dressing table\r\nthat she said was simply dear! A book shelf low to hold her books, a\r\nlittle china rack, And then, of course, a bureau set and lots of\r\nbric-a-brac; A dainty little escritoire, with fixings all her own\r\nAnd just for her convenience, too, a little telephone. Some oriental\r\nrugs she got, and curtains of madras, With 'cunning' ones of lace\r\ninside, to go against the glass; And then a couch, a lovely one,\r\nwith cushions soft to crush, And forty pillows, more or less, of\r\nlinen, silk and plush; Of all the ornaments besides I couldn't tell\r\nthe half, But wherever there was nothing else, she stuck a\r\nphotograph. And then, when all was finished, she sighed a little\r\nsigh, And looked about with just a shade of sadness in her eye: 'For\r\nit needs a statuette or so--a fern--a silver stork Oh, something,\r\njust to fill it up!' said Alice of New York.\r\n\r\nWhen little Oumi of Japan went shopping, pitapat, She bought a fan\r\nof paper and a little sleeping mat; She set beside the window a lily\r\nin a vase, And looked about with more than doubt upon her pretty\r\nface: 'For, really--don't you think so?--with the lily and the fan.\r\nIt's a little overcrowded!' said Oumi of Japan.\"\r\n\r\n(Margaret Johnson in St. Nicholas Magazine)\r\n\r\nIn the rural homes of Japan during 1906 there were woven 14,497,058\r\nsheets of these floor mats and 6,628,772 sheets of other matting,\r\nhaving a combined value of $2,815,040, and in addition, from the\r\nbest quality of rush grown upon the same ground, aggregating 7657\r\nacres that year, there were manufactured for the export trade, fancy\r\nmattings, having the value of $2,274,131. Here is a total value, for\r\nthe product of the soil and for the labor put into the manufacture,\r\namounting to $664 per acre for the area named.\r\n\r\nAt the Akashi agricultural experiment station, under the\r\nDirectorship of Professor Ono, we saw some of the methods of fruit\r\nculture as practiced in Japan. He was conducting experiments with\r\nthe object of improving methods of heading and training pear trees,\r\nto which reference was made on page 22. A study was also being made\r\nof the advantages and disadvantages associated with covering the\r\nfruit with paper bags, examples of which are seen in Figs. 6 and 7.\r\nThe bags were being made at the time of our visit, from old\r\nnewspapers cut, folded and pasted by women. Naked cultivation was\r\npracticed in the orchard, and fertilizers consisting of fish guano\r\nand superphosphate of lime were being applied twice each year in\r\namounts aggregating a cost of twenty-four dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nPear orchards of native varieties, in good bearing, yield returns of\r\n150 yen per tan, and those of European varieties, 200 yen per tan,\r\nwhich is at the rate of $300 and $400 per acre. The bibo, so\r\nextensively grown in China was being cultivated here also and was\r\nyielding about $320 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt was here that we first met the cultivation of a variety of\r\nburdock grown from the seed, three crops being taken each season\r\nwhere the climate is favorable, or as one of three in the multiple\r\ncrop system. It is grown for the root, yielding a crop valued at $40\r\nto $50 per acre. One crop, planted, in March, was being harvested\r\nJuly 1st.\r\n\r\nDuring our ride to Akashi on the early morning train we passed long\r\nprocessions of carts drawn by cattle, horses or by men, moving along\r\nthe country road which paralleled the railway, all loaded with the\r\nwaste of the city of Kobe, going to its destination in the fields,\r\nsome of it a distance of twelve miles, where it was sold at from 54\r\ncents to $1.63 per ton.\r\n\r\nAt several places along our route from Shimonoseki to Osaka we had\r\nobserved the application of slacked lime to the water of the rice\r\nfields, but in this prefecture, Hyogo, where the station is located,\r\nits use was prohibited in 1901, except under the direction of the\r\nstation authorities, where the soil was acid or where it was needed\r\non account of insect troubles. Up to this time it had been the\r\ncustom of farmers to apply slacked lime at the rate of three to five\r\ntons per acre, paying for it $4.84 per ton. The first restrictive\r\nlegislation permitted the use of 82 pounds of lime with each 827\r\npounds of organic manure, but as the farmers persisted in using much\r\nlarger quantities, complete prohibition was resorted to.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to subsidies encouraging the use of\r\ncomposts, and in this prefecture prizes are awarded for the best\r\ncompost heaps in each county, examinations being made by a\r\ncommittee. The composts receiving the four highest awards in each\r\ncounty are allowed to compete with those in other counties for a\r\nprefectural prize awarded by another committee.\r\n\r\nThe \"pink clover\" grown in Hyogo after rice, as a green manure crop,\r\nyields under favorable conditions twenty tons of the green product\r\nper acre, and is usually applied to about three times the area upon\r\nwhich it grew, at the rate of 6.6 tons per acre, the stubble and\r\nroots serving for the ground upon which the crop grew.\r\n\r\nOn July 3rd we left Osaka, going south through Sakai to Wakayama,\r\nthence east and north to the Nara Experiment Station. After passing\r\nthe first two stations the route lay through a very flat, highly\r\ncultivated garden section with cucumbers trained on trellises, many\r\nsquash in full bloom, with fields of taro, ginger and many other\r\nvegetables. Beyond Hamadera considerable areas of flat sandy land\r\nhad been set close with pine, but with intervening areas in rice,\r\nwhere the growers were using the revolving weeder seen in Fig. 14.\r\nAt Otsu broad areas are in rice but here worked with the short\r\nhandled claw weeders, and stubble from a former crop had been drawn\r\ntogether into small piles, seen in Fig. 230, which later would be\r\ncarefully distributed and worked beneath the mud.\r\n\r\nMuch of the mountain lands in this region, growing pine, is owned by\r\nprivate parties and the growth is cut at intervals of ten, twenty or\r\ntwenty-five years, being sold on the ground to those who will come\r\nand cut it at a price of forty sen for a one-horse load, as already\r\ndescribed, page 159.\r\n\r\nThe course from here was up the rather rapidly rising Kiigawa valley\r\nwhere much water was being applied to the rice fields by various\r\nmethods of pumping, among them numerous current wheels; an\r\noccasional power-pump driven by cattle; and very commonly the\r\nfoot-power wheel where the man walks on the circumference, steadying\r\nhimself with a long pole, as seen in the field, Fig. 231. It was\r\nhere that a considerable section of the hill slope had been very\r\nrecently cut over, the area showing light in the engraving. It was\r\nin the vicinity of Hashimoto on this route, too, that the two\r\nbeautiful views reproduced in Figs. 151 and 152 were taken.\r\n\r\nAt the experiment station it was learned that within the prefecture\r\nof Nara, having a population of 558,314, and 107,574 acres of\r\ncultivated land, two-thirds of this was in paddy rice. Within the\r\nprovince there are also about one thousand irrigation reservoirs\r\nwith an average depth of eight feet. The rice fields receive 16.32\r\ninches of irrigation water in addition to the rain.\r\n\r\nOf the uncultivated hill lands, some 2500 acres contribute green\r\nmanure for fertilization of fields. Reference has been made to the\r\nproduction of compost for fertilizers on page 211. The amount\r\nrecommended in this prefecture as a yearly application for two crops\r\ngrown is:\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganic matter       3,711 to 4,640 lbs. per acre\r\nNitrogen               105 to   131 lbs. per acre\r\nPhosphorus              35 to    44 lbs. per acre\r\nPotassium               56 to    70 lbs. per acre\r\n\r\n\r\nThese amounts, on the basis of the table, p. 214, are nearly\r\nsufficient for a crop of thirty bushels of wheat, followed by one of\r\nthirty bushels of rice, the phosphorus being in excess and the\r\npotassium not quite enough, supposing none to be derived from other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nAt the Nara hotel, one of the beautiful Japanese inns where we\r\nstopped, our room opened upon a second story veranda from which one\r\nlooked down upon a beautiful, tiny lakelet, some twenty by eighty\r\nfeet, within a diminutive park scarcely more than one hundred by two\r\nhundred feet, and the lakelet had its grassy, rocky banks over-hung\r\nwith trees and shrubs planted in all the wild disorder and beauty of\r\nnature; bamboo, willow, fir, pine, cedar, red-leaved maple, catalpa,\r\nwith other kinds, and through these, along the shore, wound a\r\nwoodsy, well trodden, narrow footpath leading from the inn to a half\r\nhidden cottage apparently quarters for the maids, as they were\r\nfrequently passing to and fro. A suggestion of how such wild beauty\r\nis brought right to the very doors in Japan may be gained from Fig.\r\n232, which is an instance of parking effect on a still smaller scale\r\nthan that described.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 6th, with two men for each of our rickshas,\r\nwe left the Yaami hotel for the Kyoto Experiment station, some two\r\nmiles to the southwest of the city limits. As soon as we had entered\r\nupon the country road we found ourselves in a procession of cart men\r\neach drawing a load of six large covered receptacles of about ten\r\ngallons capacity, and filled with the city's waste. Before reaching\r\nthe station we had passed fifty-two of these loads, and on our\r\nreturn the procession was still moving in the same direction and we\r\npassed sixty-one others, so that during at least five hours there\r\nhad moved over this section of road leading into the country, away\r\nfrom the city, not less than ninety tons of waste; along other\r\nroadways similar loads were moving. These freight carts and those\r\ndrawn by horses and bullocks were all provided with long racks\r\nsimilar to that illustrated in Fig. 108, page 197, and when the load\r\nis not sufficient to cover the full length it is always divided\r\nequally and placed near each end, thus taking advantage of the\r\nelasticity of the body to give the effect of springs, lessening the\r\ndraft and the wear and tear,\r\n\r\nOne of the most common commodities coming into the city along the\r\ncountry roads was fuel from the hill lands, in split sticks tied in\r\nbundles as represented in Fig. 224; as bundles of limbs twenty-four\r\nto thirty inches, and sometimes four to six feet, long; and in the\r\nform of charcoal made from trunks and stems one and a half inches to\r\nsix inches long, and baled in straw matting. Most of the draft\r\nanimals used in Japan are either cows, bulls or stallions; at least\r\nwe saw very few oxen and few geldings.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1895 the Government began definite steps looking to the\r\nimprovement of horse breeding, appointing at that time a commission\r\nto devise comprehensive plans. This led to progressive steps finally\r\nculminating in 1906 in the Horse Administration Bureau, whose duties\r\nwere to extend over a period of thirty years, divided into two\r\nintervals, the first, eighteen and the second, twelve years. During\r\nthe first interval it is contemplated that the Government shall\r\nacquire 1,500 stallions to be distributed throughout the country for\r\nthe use of private individuals, and during the second period it is\r\nthe expectation that the system will have completely renovated the\r\nstock and familiarized the people with proper methods of management\r\nso that matters may be left in their hands.\r\n\r\nAs our main purpose and limited time required undivided attention to\r\nagricultural matters, and of these to the long established practices\r\nof the people, we could give but little time to sight-seeing or even\r\nto a study of the efforts being made for the introduction of\r\nimproved agricultural methods and practices. But in the very old\r\ncity of Kyoto, which was the seat of the Mikado's court from before\r\n800 A. D. until 1868, we did pay a short visit to the Kiyomizu\r\ntemple, situated some three hundred yards south from the Yaami\r\nhotel, which faces the Maruyaami park with its centuries-old giant\r\ncherry tree, having a trunk of more than four feet through and wide\r\nspreading branches, now much propped up to guard against accident,\r\nas seen in Fig. 233. These cherry trees are very extensively used\r\nfor ornamental purposes in Japan with striking effect. The tree does\r\nnot produce an edible fruit, but is very beautiful when in full\r\nbloom, as may be seen from Fig. 234. It was these trees that were\r\nsent by the Japanese government to this country for use at\r\nWashington but the first lot were destroyed because they were found\r\nto be infested and threatened danger to native trees.\r\n\r\nKyoto stands amid surroundings of wonderful beauty, the site\r\napparently having been selected with rare acumen for its\r\npossibilities in large landscape effects, and these have been\r\ndeveloped with that fullness and richness which the greatest artists\r\nmight be content to approach. We are thinking particularly of the\r\nKiyomizu-dera, or rather of the marvelous beauty of tree and foliage\r\nwhich has overgrown it and swept far up and over the mountain\r\nsummit, leaving the temple half hidden at the base. No words, no\r\nbrush, no photographic art can transfer the effect. One must see to\r\nfeel the influence for which it was created, and scores of people,\r\nvery old and very young, nearly all Japanese, and more of them on\r\nthat day from the poorer rather than from the well-to-do class, were\r\nthere, all withdrawing reluctantly, like ourselves, looking\r\nbackward, under the spell. So potent and impressive was that\r\nsomething from the great overshadowing beauty of the mountain, that\r\nall along up the narrow, shop-lined street leading to the gateway of\r\nthe temple, seen in Fig. 235, the tiniest bits of park effect were\r\nflourishing in the most impossible situations; and as Professor\r\nTokito and myself were coming away we chanced upon six little\r\nroughly dressed lads laying out in the sand an elaborate little\r\npark, quite nine by twelve feet. They must have been at it hours,\r\nfor there were ponds, bridges, tiny hills and ravines and much\r\nplanting in moss and other little greens. So intent on their task\r\nwere they that we stood watching full two minutes before our\r\npresence attracted their attention, and yet the oldest of the group\r\nmust have been under ten years of age.\r\n\r\nOne partly hidden view of the temple is seen in Fig. 236, the dense\r\nmountain verdure rising above and beyond it. And then too, within\r\nthe temple, as the peasant men and women came before the shrine and\r\ngrasped the long depending rope knocker, with the heavy knot in\r\nfront of the great gong, swinging it to strike three rings,\r\nannouncing their presence before their God, then kneeling to offer\r\nprayers, one could not fail to realize the deep sincerity and faith\r\nexpressed in face and manner, while they were oblivious to all else.\r\nNo Christian was ever more devout and one may well doubt if any ever\r\narose from prayer more uplifted than these. Who need believe they\r\ndid not look beyond the imagery and commune with the Eternal Spirit?\r\n\r\nA third view of the same temple, showing resting places beneath the\r\nshade, which serve the purpose of lawn seats in our parks, is seen\r\nin Fig. 237.\r\n\r\nThat a high order of the esthetic sense is born to the Japanese\r\npeople; that they are masters of the science of the beautiful; and\r\nthat there are artists among them capable of effective and\r\nimpressive results, is revealed in a hundred ways, and one of these\r\nis the iris garden of Fig. 238. One sees it here in the bulrushes\r\nwhich make the iris feel at home; in the unobtrusive semblance of a\r\nlog that seems to have fallen across the run; in the hard beaten\r\nnarrow path and the sore toes of the old pine tree, telling of the\r\nhundreds that come and go; it is seen in the dress and pose of the\r\nladies, and one may be sure the photographer felt all that he saw\r\nand fixed so well.\r\n\r\nThe vender of Oumi's lily that Margaret Johnson saw, is in Fig. 239.\r\nThere another is bartering for a spray of flowers, and thus one sold\r\nthe branch of red maple leaves in our room at the Nara inn. His\r\nfloral stands are borne along the streets pendant from the usual\r\ncarrying pole.\r\n\r\nWhen returning to the city from the Kyoto Experiment Station several\r\nfields of Japanese indigo were passed, growing in water under the\r\nconditions of ordinary rice culture, Fig. 240 being a view of one of\r\nthese. The plant is Poligonum tinctoria, a close relative of the\r\nsmartweed. Before the importation of aniline and alizarin dyes,\r\nwhich amounted in 1907 to 160,558 pounds and 7,170,320 pounds\r\nrespectively, the cultivation of indigo was much more extensive than\r\nat present, amounting in 1897 to 160,460,000 pounds of the dried\r\nleaves; but in 1906 the production had fallen to 58,696,000 pounds,\r\nforty-five per cent of which was grown in the prefecture of\r\nTokushima in the eastern part of the island of Shikoku. The\r\npopulation of this prefecture is 707,565, or 4.4 people to each of\r\nthe 159,450 acres of cultivated field, and yet 19,969 of these acres\r\nbore the indigo crop, leaving more than five people to each\r\nfood-producing acre.\r\n\r\nThe plants for this crop are started in nursery beds in February and\r\ntransplanted in May, the first crop being cut the last of June or\r\nfirst of July, when the fields are again fertilized, the stubble\r\nthrowing out new shoots and yielding a second cutting the last of\r\nAugust or early September. A crop of barley may have preceded one of\r\nindigo, or the indigo may be set following a crop of rice. Such\r\npractice, with the high fertilization for every crop, goes a long\r\nway toward supplying the necessary food. The dense population, too,\r\nhas permitted the manufacture of the indigo as a home industry among\r\nthe farmers, enabling them to exchange the spare labor of the family\r\nfor cash. The manufactured product from the reduced planting in 1907\r\nwas worth $1,304,610, forty-five per cent of which was the output of\r\nthe rural population of the prefecture of Tokushima, which they\r\ncould exchange for rice and other necessaries. The land in rice in\r\nthis prefecture in 1907 was 73,816 acres, yielding 114,380,000\r\npounds, or more than 161 pounds to each man, woman and child, and\r\nthere were 65,665 acres bearing other crops. Besides this there are\r\n874,208 acres of mountain and hill land in the prefecture which\r\nsupply fuel, fuel ashes and green manure for fertilizer; run-off\r\nwater for irrigation; lumber and remunerative employment for service\r\nnot needed in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe journey was continued from Kyoto July 7th, taking the route\r\nleading northeastward, skirting lake Biwa which we came upon\r\nsuddenly on emerging from a tunnel as the train left Otani. At many\r\nplaces we passed waterwheels such as that seen in Fig. 241, all\r\nsimilarly set, busily turning, and usually twelve to sixteen feet in\r\ndiameter but oftenest only as many inches thick. Until we had\r\nreached Lake Biwa the valleys were narrow with only small areas in\r\nrice. Tea plantations were common on the higher cultivated slopes,\r\nand gardens on the terraced hillsides growing vegetables of many\r\nkinds were common, often with the ground heavily mulched with straw,\r\nwhile the wooded or grass-covered slopes still further up showed the\r\nusual systematic periodic cutting. After passing the west end of the\r\nlake, rice fields were nearly continuous and extensive. Before\r\nreaching Hachiman we crossed a stream leading into the lake but\r\nconfined between levees more than twelve feet high, and we had\r\nalready passed beneath two raised viaducts after leaving Kusatsu.\r\nOther crops were being grown side by side with the rice on similar\r\nlands and apparently in rotation with it, but on sharp, narrow close\r\nridges twelve to fourteen inches high. As we passed eastward we\r\nentered one of the important mulberry districts where the fields are\r\ngraded to two levels, the higher occupied with mulberry or other\r\ncrops not requiring irrigation, while the lower was devoted to rice\r\nor crops grown in rotation with it.\r\n\r\nOn the Kisogawa, at the station of the same name, there were four\r\nanchored floating water-power mills propelled by two pair of large\r\ncurrent wheels stationed fore and aft, each pair working on a common\r\naxle from opposite sides of the mill, driven by the force of the\r\ncurrent flowing by.\r\n\r\nAt Kisogawa we had entered the northern end of one of the largest\r\nplains of Japan, some thirty miles wide and extending forty miles\r\nsouthward to Owari bay. The plain has been extensively graded to two\r\nlevels, the benches being usually not more than two feet above the\r\nrice paddies, and devoted to various dry land crops, including the\r\nmulberry. The soil is decidedly sandy in character but the mean\r\nyield of rice for the prefecture is 37 bushels per acre and above\r\nthe average for the country at large. An analysis of the soils at\r\nthe sub-experiment station north of Nagoya shows the following\r\ncontent of the three main plant food elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Nitrogen Phosphorus Potassium\r\n                             Pounds per million\r\n                               In paddy field\r\nSoil                      1520      769        805\r\nSubsoil                    810      756        888\r\n                               In upland field\r\nSoil                      1060      686       1162\r\nSubsoil                    510      673       1204\r\n\r\n\r\nThe green manure crops on this plain are chiefly two varieties of\r\nthe \"pink clover,\" one sowed in the fall and one about May 15th, the\r\nfirst yielding as high as sixteen tons green weight per acre and the\r\nother from five to eight tons.\r\n\r\nOn the plain distant from the mountain and hill land the stems of\r\nagricultural crops are largely used as fuel and the fuel ashes are\r\napplied to the fields at the rate of 10 kan per tan, or 330 pounds\r\nper acre, worth $1.20, little lime, as such, being used.\r\n\r\nIn the prefecture of Aichi, largely in this plain, with an area of\r\ncultivated land equal to about sixteen of our government townships,\r\nthere is a population of 1,752,042, or a density of 4.7 per acre,\r\nand the number of households of farmers was placed at 211,033, thus\r\ngiving to each farmer's family an average of 1.75 acres, their chief\r\nindustries being rice and silk culture.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the Agricultural Experiment Station of Aichi\r\nprefecture at An Jo we crossed the large Yahagigawa, flowing between\r\nstrong levees above the level of the rice fields. Mulberries, with\r\nburdock and other vegetables were growing upon all of the tables\r\nraised one to two, feet above the rice paddies, and these features\r\ncontinued past Okasaki, Koda, and Kamagori, where the hills in many\r\nplaces had been recently cut clean of the low forest growth and\r\nwhere we passed many large stacks of pine boughs tied in bundles for\r\nfuel. After passing Goyu sixty-five miles east from Nagoya, mulberry\r\nwas the chief crop. Then came a plain country which had been graded\r\nand leveled at great cost of labor, the benches with their square\r\nshoulders standing three to four feet above the paddy fields; and\r\nafter passing Toyohashi some distance we were surprised to cross a\r\nrather wide section of comparatively level land overgrown with pine\r\nand herbaceous, plants which had evidently been cut and recut many\r\ntimes. Beyond Futagawa rice fields were laid out on what appeared to\r\nbe, similar land but with soil a little finer in texture, and still\r\nfurther along were other flat areas not cultivated.\r\n\r\nAt Maisaka quite half the cultivated fields appear to be in mulberry\r\nwith ponds of lotus plants in low places, while at Hamamatsu the\r\nrice fields are interspersed with many square-shouldered tables\r\nraised three to four feet and occupied with mulberry or vegetables.\r\nAs we passed upon the flood plain of the Tenryugawa, with its nearly\r\ndry bed of coarse gravel half a mile wide, the dwellings of farm\r\nvillages were, many of them surrounded with nearly solid,\r\nflat-topped, trimmed evergreen hedges nine to twelve feet high, of\r\nthe umbrella pine, forming beautiful and effective screens.\r\n\r\nAt Nakaidzumi we had left the mulberry orchards for those of tea,\r\nrice still holding wherever paddies could be formed. Here, too, we\r\nmet the first fields of tobacco, and at Fukuroi and Homouchi large\r\nquantities of imported Manchurian bean cake were stacked about the\r\nstation, having evidently been brought by rail. At Kanaya we passed\r\nthrough a long tunnel and were in the valley of the Oigawa, crossing\r\nthe broad, nearly dry stream over a bridge of nineteen long spans\r\nand were then in the prefecture of Shizuoka where large fields of\r\ntea spread far up the hillsides, covering extensive areas, but after\r\npassing the next station, and for seventeen miles before reaching\r\nShizuoka we traversed a level stretch of nearly continuous rice\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThe Shizuoka Experiment Station is devoting special attention to the\r\ninterests of horticulture, and progress has already been made in\r\nintroducing new fruits of better quality and in improving the native\r\nvarieties. The native pears and peaches, as we found them served on\r\nthe hotel tables in either China or Japan, were not particularly\r\nattractive in either texture or flavor, but we were here permitted\r\nto test samples of three varieties of ripe figs of fine flavor and\r\ntexture, one of them as large as a good sized pear. Three varieties\r\nof fine peaches were also shown, one unusually large and with\r\ndelicate deep rose tint, including the flesh. If such peaches could\r\nbe canned so as to retain their delicate color they would prove very\r\nattractive for the table. The flavor and texture of this peach were\r\nalso excellent, as was the case with two varieties of pears.\r\n\r\nThe station was also experimenting with the production of marmalades\r\nand we tasted three very excellent brands, two of them lacking the\r\nbitter flavor. It would appear that, in Japan, Korea and China there\r\nshould be a very bright future along the lines of horticultural\r\ndevelopment, leading to the utilization of the extensive hill lands\r\nof these countries and the development of a very extensive export\r\ntrade, both in fresh fruits and marmalades, preserves and the canned\r\nforms. They have favorable climatic and soil conditions and great\r\nnumbers of people with temperament and habits well suited to the\r\nindustries, as well as an enormous home need which should be met, in\r\naddition to the large possibilities in the direction of a most\r\nprofitable export trade which would increase opportunities for labor\r\nand bring needed revenue to the people. In Fig. 242 are three views\r\nat this station, the lower showing a steep terraced hillside set\r\nwith oranges and other fruits, holding out a bright promise for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nPeach orchards were here set on the hill lands, the trees six feet\r\napart each way. They come into bearing in three years, remain\r\nproductive ten to fifteen years, and the returns are 50 to 60 yen\r\nper tan, or at the rate of $100 to $120 per acre. The usual\r\nfertilizers for a peach orchard are the manure-earth-compost,\r\napplied at the rate of 3300 pounds per acre, and fish guano applied\r\nin rotation and at the same rate.\r\n\r\nShizuoka is one of the large prefectures, having a total area of\r\n3029 square miles; 2090 of which are in forest; 438 in pasture and\r\ngenya land, and 501 square miles cultivated, not quite one-half of\r\nwhich is in paddy fields. The mean yield of paddy rice is nearly 33\r\nbushels per acre. The prefecture has a population of 1,293,470, or\r\nabout four to the acre of cultivated field, and the total crop of\r\nrice is such as, to provide 236 pounds to each person.\r\n\r\nAt many places along the way as we left Shizuoka July 10th for\r\nTokyo, farmers were sowing broadcast, on the water, over their rice\r\nfields, some pulverized fertilizer, possibly bean cake. Near the\r\nrailway station of Fuji, and after crossing the boulder gravel bed\r\nof the Fujikawa which was a full quarter of a mile wide, we were\r\ntraversing a broad plain of rice paddies with their raised tables,\r\nbut on them pear orchards were growing, trained to their overhead\r\ntrellises. About. Suduzuka grass was being cut with sickles along\r\nthe canal dikes for use as green manure in the rice fields, which on\r\nthe left of the railway, stretched eastward more than six miles to\r\nbeyond Hara where we passed into a tract of dry land crops\r\nconsisting of mulberry, tea and various vegetables, with more or\r\nless of dry land rice, but we returned to the paddy land again at\r\nNumazu, in another four miles. Here there were four carloads of beef\r\ncattle destined for Tokyo or Yokohama, the first we had seen.\r\n\r\nIt was at this station that the railway turns northward to skirt the\r\neastern flank of the beautiful Fuji-yama, rising to higher lands of\r\na brown loamy character, showing many large boulders two feet in\r\ndiameter. Horses were here moving along the roadways under large\r\nsaddle loads of green grass, going to the paddy fields from the\r\nhills, which in this section are quite free from all but herbaceous\r\ngrowth, well covered and green. Considerable areas were growing\r\nmaize and buckwheat, the latter being ground into flour and made\r\ninto macaroni which is eaten with chopsticks, Fig. 243, and used to\r\ngive variety to the diet of rice and naked barley. At Gotenba, where\r\ntourists leave the train to ascend Fuji-yama, the road turns\r\neastward again and descends rapidly through many tunnels, crossing\r\nthe wide gravelly channel of the Sakawagawa, then carrying but\r\nlittle water, like all of the other main streams we had crossed,\r\nalthough we were in the rainy season. This was partly because the\r\nseason was yet not far advanced; partly because so much water was\r\nbeing taken upon the rice fields, and again because the drainage is\r\nso rapid down the steep slopes and comparatively short water\r\ncourses. Beyond Yamakita the railway again led along a broad plain\r\nset in paddy rice and the hill slopes were terraced and cultivated\r\nnearly to their summits.\r\n\r\nSwinging strongly southeastward, the coast was reached at Noduz in a\r\nhilly country producing chiefly vegetables, mulberry and tobacco,\r\nthe latter crop being extensively grown eastward nearly to Oiso,\r\nbeyond which, after a mile of sweet potatoes, squash and cucumbers,\r\nthere were paddy fields of rice in a flat plain. Before Hiratsuka\r\nwas reached the rice paddies were left and the train was crossing a\r\ncomparatively flat country with a sandy, sometimes gravelly, soil\r\nwhere mulberries, peaches, eggplants, sweet potatoes and dry land\r\nrice were interspersed with areas still occupied with small pine and\r\nherbaceous growth or where small pine had been recently set. Similar\r\nconditions prevailed after we had crossed the broad channel of the\r\nBanyugawa and well toward and beyond Fujishiwa where a leveled plain\r\nhas its tables scattered among the fields of paddy rice, this being\r\nthe southwest margin of the Tokyo plain, the largest in Japan, lying\r\nin five prefectures, whose aggregate area of 1,739,200 acres of\r\narable lands was worked by 657,235 families of farmers; 661,613\r\nacres of which was in paddy rice, producing annually some 19,198,000\r\nbushels, or 161 pounds for each of the 7,194,045 men, women and\r\nchildren in the five prefectures, 1,818,655 of whom were in the\r\ncapital city, Tokyo.\r\n\r\nThree views taken in the eastern portion of this plain in the\r\nprefecture of Chiba, July 17th, are seen in Fig. 244, in two of\r\nwhich shocks of wheat were still standing in the fields among the\r\ngrowing crops, badly weathered and the grain sprouting as the result\r\nof the rainy season. Peanuts, sweet potatoes and millet were the\r\nmain dry land, crops then on the ground, with paddy rice in the\r\nflooded basins. Windsor beans, rape, wheat and barley had been\r\nharvested. One family with whom we talked were threshing their\r\nwheat. The crop had been a good one and was yielding between 38.5\r\nand. 41.3 bushels per acre, worth at the time $35 to $40. On the\r\nsame land this farmer secures a yield of 352 to 361 bushels of\r\npotatoes, which at the market price at that time would give a gross\r\nearning of $64 to $66 per acre.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the extensive use of straw in the\r\ncultural methods of the Japanese. This is notably the case in their\r\ntruck garden work, and two phases of this are shown in Fig. 245. In\r\nthe lower section of the illustration the garden has been ridged and\r\nfurrowed for transplanting, the sets have been laid and the roots\r\ncovered with a little soil; then, in the middle section, showing the\r\nnext step in the method, a layer of straw has been pressed firmly\r\nabove the roots, and in the final step this would be covered with\r\nearth. Adopting this method the straw is so placed that (1) it acts\r\nas an effective mulch without in any way interfering with the\r\ncapillary rise of water to the roots of the sets; (2) it gives deep,\r\nthorough aeration of the soil, at the same time allowing rains to\r\npenetrate quickly, drawing the air after it; (3) the ash ingredients\r\ncarried in the straw are leached directly to the roots where they\r\nare needed; (4) and finally the straw and soil constitute a compost\r\nwhere the rapid decay liberates plant food gradually and in the\r\nplace where it will be most readily available. The upper section of\r\nthe illustration shows rows of eggplants very heavily mulched with\r\ncoarse straw, the quantity being sufficient to act as a most\r\neffective mulch, to largely prevent the development of weeds and to\r\nserve during the rainy season as a very material fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn growing such dry land crops as barley, beans, buckwheat or dry\r\nland rice the soil of the field is at first fitted by plowing or\r\nspading, then furrowed deeply where the rows are to be planted. Into\r\nthese furrows fertilizer is placed and covered with a layer of earth\r\nupon which the seed is planted. When the crop is up, if a second\r\nfertilization is desired, a furrow may be made alongside each row,\r\ninto which the fertilizer is sowed and then covered. When the crop\r\nis so far matured that a second may be planted, a new furrow is\r\nmade, either midway between two others or adjacent to one of them,\r\nfertilizer applied and covered with a layer of soil and the seed\r\nplanted. In this way the least time possible is lost during the\r\ngrowing season, all of the soil of the field doing duty in crop\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIt was our privilege to visit the Imperial Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation at Nishigahara, near Tokyo, which is charged with the\r\nleadership of the general and technical agricultural research work\r\nfor the Empire. The work is divided into the sections of\r\nagriculture, agricultural chemistry, entomology, vegetable\r\npathology, tobacco, horticulture, stock breeding, soils, and tea\r\nmanufacture, each with their laboratory equipment and research\r\nstaff, while the forty-one prefectural stations and fourteen\r\nsub-stations are charged with the duty of handling all specific\r\nlocal, practical problems and with testing out and applying\r\nconclusions and methods suggested by the results obtained at the\r\ncentral station, together with the local dissemination of knowledge\r\namong the farmers of the respective prefectures.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive soil survey of the arable lands of the Empire has\r\nbeen in progress since before 1893, excellent maps being issued on a\r\nscale of 1 to 100,000, or about 1.57 inch-to the mile, showing the\r\ngeological formations in eight colors with subdivisions indicated by\r\nletters. Some eleven soil types are recognized, based on physical\r\ncomposition and the areas occupied by these are shown by means of\r\nlines and dots in black printed over the colors. Typical profiles of\r\nthe soil to depths of three meters are printed as insets on each\r\nsheet and localities where these apply are indicated by\r\ncorresponding numbers in red on the map.\r\n\r\nElaborate chemical and physical studies are also being made in the\r\nlaboratories of samples of both soil and subsoil. The Imperial\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station is well equipped for investigation\r\nwork along many lines and that for soils is notably strong. In Fig.\r\n246 may be seen a portion of the large immersed cylinders which are\r\nfilled with typical soils from different parts of the Empire, and\r\nFig. 247 shows a portion of another part of their elaborate outfit\r\nfor soil studies which are in progress.\r\n\r\nIt is found that nearly all cultivated soils of Japan are acid to\r\nlitmus, and this they are inclined to attribute to the presence of\r\nacid hydro-aluminum silicates.\r\n\r\nThe Island Empire of Japan stretches along the Asiatic coast through\r\nmore than twenty-nine degrees of latitude from the southern\r\nextremity of Formosa northward to the middle of Saghalin, some 2300\r\nstatute miles; or from the latitude of middle Cuba to that of north\r\nNewfoundland and Winnipeg; but the total land area is only 175,428\r\nsquare miles, and less than that of the three states of Wisconsin,\r\nIowa and Minnesota. Of this total land area only 23,698 square miles\r\nare at present cultivated; 7151 square miles in the three main\r\nislands are weed and pasture land. Less than fourteen per cent of\r\nthe entire land area is at present under cultivation.\r\n\r\nIf all lands having a slope of less than fifteen degrees may be\r\ntilled, there yet remain in the four main islands, 15,400 square\r\nmiles to bring under cultivation, which is an addition of 65.4 per\r\ncent to the land already cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 there were in the Empire some 5,814,362 households of\r\nfarmers tilling 15,201,969 acres and feeding 3,522,877 additional\r\nhouseholds, or 51,742,398 people. This is an average of 3.4 people\r\nto the acre of cultivated land, each farmer's household tilling an\r\naverage of 2.6 acres.\r\n\r\nThe lands yet to be reclaimed are being put under cultivation\r\nrapidly, the amount improved in 1907 being 64,448 acres. If the new\r\nlands to be reclaimed can be made as productive as those now in use\r\nthere should be opportunity for an increase in population to the\r\nextent of about 35,000,000 without changing the present ratio of 3.4\r\npeople to the acre of cultivated land.\r\n\r\nWhile the remaining lands to be reclaimed are not as inherently\r\nproductive as those now in use, improvements in management will more\r\nthan compensate for this, and the Empire is certain to quite double\r\nits present maintenance capacity and provide for at least a hundred\r\nmillion people with many more comforts of home and more satisfaction\r\nfor the common people than they now enjoy.\r\n\r\nSince 1872 there has been an increase in the population of Japan\r\namounting to an annual average of about 1.1 per cent, and if this\r\nrate is maintained the one hundred million mark would be passed in\r\nless than sixty years. It appears probable however that the\r\nincreased acreage put under cultivation and pasturage combined, will\r\nmore than keep pace with the population up to this limit, while the\r\nimprovement in methods and crops will readily permit a second like\r\nincrement to her population, bringing that for the present Empire up\r\nto 150 millions. Against this view, perhaps, is the fact that the\r\nrice crop of the twenty years ending in 1906 is only thirty-three\r\nper cent greater than the crop of 1838.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, as in the United States, there has been a strong movement\r\nfrom the country to the city as a natural result of the large\r\nincrease in manufactures and commerce, and the small amount of land\r\nper each farmer's household. In 1903 only .23 per cent of the\r\npopulation of Japan were living in villages of less than 500, while\r\n79.06 per cent were in towns and villages of less than 10,000\r\npeople, 20.7 per cent living in those larger. But in 1894 84.36 per\r\ncent of the population were living in towns and villages of less\r\nthan 10,000, and only 15.64 per cent were in cities, towns and\r\nvillages of over 10,000 people; and while during these ten years the\r\nrural population had increased at the rate of 640 per 10,000, in\r\ncities the increase had been 6,174 per 10,000.\r\n\r\nJapan has been and still is essentially an agricultural nation and\r\nin 1906 there were 3,872,105 farmers' households, whose chief work\r\nwas farming, and 1,581,204 others whose subsidiary work was farming,\r\nor 60.2 per cent of the entire number of households. A like ratio\r\nholds in Formosa. Wealthy land owners who do not till their own\r\nfields are not included.\r\n\r\nOf the farmers in Japan some 33.34 per cent own and work their land.\r\nThose having smaller holdings, who rent additional land, make up\r\n46.03 per cent of the total farmers; while 20.63 per cent are\r\ntenants who work 44.1 per cent of the land. In 1892 only one per\r\ncent of the land holders owned more than twenty-five acres each;\r\nthose holding between twenty-five acres and five acres made up 11.7\r\nper cent; while 87.3 per cent held less than five acres each. A man\r\nowning seventy-five acres of land in Japan is counted among the\r\n\"great landholders\". It is never true, however, except in the\r\nHokkaido, which is a new country agriculturally, that such holdings\r\nlie in one body.\r\n\r\nStatistics published in \"Agriculture in Japan\", by the Agricultural\r\nBureau, Department of Agriculture and Commerce, permit the following\r\nstatements of rent, crop returns, taxes and expenses, to be made.\r\nThe wealthy land owners who rent their lands receive returns like\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n\r\n              For paddy field,  For upland field,\r\n                 per acre.         per acre.\r\nRent              $27.98            $13.53\r\nTaxes               7.34              1.98\r\nExpenses            1.72              2.48\r\nTotal expenses     $9.06             $4.46\r\nNet profit         18.92              9.07\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated, in connection with these statistics, that the rate of\r\nprofit for land capital is 5.6 per cent for the paddy field, and 5.7\r\nper cent for the upland field. This makes the valuation of the land\r\nabout $338 and $159 per acre, respectively. A land holder who owns\r\nand rents ten acres of paddy field and ten acres of upland field\r\nwould, at these rates, realize a net annual income of $279.90.\r\n\r\nPeasant farmers who own and work their lands receive per acre an\r\nincome as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  For paddy field,    For upland field,\r\n                     per acre.            per acre.\r\nCrop returns          $55.00               $30.72\r\nTaxes                   7.34                 1.98\r\nLabor and expenses     36.20                24.00\r\n                     -------              -------\r\nTotal expense         $43.54               $25.98\r\nNet profit             11.46                 4.74\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peasant farmer who owns and works five acres, 2.5 of paddy and\r\n2.5 of upland field, would realize a total net income of $40.50.\r\nThis is after deducting the price of his labor. With that included,\r\nhis income would be something like $91.\r\n\r\nTenant farmers who work some 41 per cent of the farm lands of Japan,\r\nwould have accounts something as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n               For paddy field,  For upland field,\r\n               1 crop.  2 crops.\r\n                   per acre.        per acre.\r\nCrop returns    $49.03   $78.62       $41.36\r\nTenant fee       23.89    31.58        13.52\r\nLabor            15.78    25.79        14.69\r\nFertilization     7.82    17.30        10.22\r\nSeed               .82     1.40         1.57\r\nOther expenses    1.69     2.82         1.66\r\n                  -------------   -------\r\nTotal expenses   $50.00  $78.89       $41.66\r\nNet profit        --.97   --.27        --.30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement indicates that tenant farmers do not realize enough\r\nfrom the crops to quite cover expenses and the price named for their\r\nlabor. If the tenant were renting five acres, equally divided\r\nbetween paddy and upland field, the earning would be $73.00 or\r\n$99.73 according as one or two crops are taken from the paddy field,\r\nthis representing what he realizes on his labor, his other expenses\r\nabsorbing the balance of the crop value.\r\n\r\nBut the average area tilled by each Japanese farmer's household is\r\nonly 2.6 acres, hence the average earning of the tenant household\r\nwould be $37.95 or $51.86. A clearer view of the difference in the\r\npresent condition of farmers in Japan and of those in the United\r\nStates may be gained by making the Japanese statement on the basis\r\nof our 160-acre farm, as expressed in the table below:\r\n\r\n\r\n                For paddy field. For upland field.  Total.\r\n                 For 80 acres.    For 80 acres.   160 acres.\r\nCrop returns      $4,400.00         $2,457.60     $6,857.60\r\n                  ----------        ----------    ----------\r\nTaxes               $587.20           $158.40       $745.60\r\nExpenses           1,633.60            744.80      2,378.40\r\nLabor              1,262.40          1,175.20      2,437.60\r\n                  ----------        ----------    ----------\r\n   Total cost     $3,488.20         $2,078.40     $5,561.60\r\nNet return           916.80            379.20      1,296.00\r\nReturn\r\n  including labor  2,179.20          1,554.40      3,783.60\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the United States the 160-acre farm is managed by and supports a\r\nsingle family, but in Japan, as the average household works but 2.6\r\nacres, the earnings of the 160 acres are distributed among some 61\r\nhouseholds, making the net return to each but $21.25, instead of\r\n$1296, and including the labor as earning, the income would be\r\n$39.96 more, or $60.67 per household instead of $3733.60, the total\r\nfor a 160-acre farm worked under Japanese conditions.\r\n\r\nThese figures reveal something of the tense strain and of the\r\nterrible burden which is being carried by these people, over and\r\nabove that required for the maintenance of the household. The tenant\r\nwho raises one crop of rice pays a rental of $23.89 per acre. If he\r\nraises two crops he pays $31.58; if it is upland field, he pays\r\n$13.52. To these amounts he adds $10.33, $21.52 or $13.45\r\nrespectively for fertilizer, seed and other expenses making a total\r\ninvestment of $34.22, $53.10 or $26.97 per acre, which would require\r\nas many bushels of wheat sold at a dollar a bushel to cover this\r\ncost. In addition to this he assumes all the risks of loss from\r\nweather, from insects and from blight, in the hope that he may\r\nrecoup his expenses and in addition have for his services $14.81,\r\n$25.52 or $14.39 for the season's work.\r\n\r\nThe burdens of society, which have been and still are so largely\r\nburdens of war and of government, with all nations, are reflected\r\nwith almost blinding effect in the land taxes of Japan, which range\r\nfrom $1.98, on the upland, to $7.34 per acre on the paddy fields,\r\nmaking a quarter section, without buildings, carry a burden of $300\r\nto $1100 annually. Japan's budget in 1907 was $134,941,113, which is\r\nat the rate of $2.60 for each man, woman and child; $8.90 for each\r\nacre of cultivated land, and $23, for each household in the Empire.\r\nWhen such is the case it is not strange that scenes like Fig. 248\r\nare common in Japan today where, after seventy years, toil may not\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nThere is a bright, as well as a pathetic side to scenes like this.\r\nThe two have shared for fifty years, but if the days have been full\r\nof toil, with them have come strength of body, of mind and sterling\r\ncharacter. If the burdens have been heavy, each has made the other's\r\nlighter, the satisfaction fuller, the joys keener, the sorrows less\r\ndifficult to bear; and the children who came into the home and have\r\ngone from it to perpetuate new ones, could not well be other than\r\nsuch as to contribute to the foundations of nations of great\r\nstrength and long endurance.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the large amount of work carried on in\r\nthe farmers' households by the women and children, and by the men\r\nwhen they are not otherwise employed, and the earnings of this\r\nsubsidiary work have materially helped to piece out the meagre\r\nincome and to meet the relatively high taxes and rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Farmers of Forty Centuries, by F.
