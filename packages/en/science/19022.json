It\r\nis based on many years' experience in fingerprint identification work\r\nout of which has developed the largest collection of classified\r\nfingerprints in the world. Inasmuch as this publication may serve as a\r\ngeneral reference on classification and other phases of fingerprint\r\nidentification work, the systems utilized in the Identification\r\nDivision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are set forth fully.\r\nThe problem of pattern interpretation, in particular, is discussed in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nCriminal identification by means of fingerprints is one of the most\r\npotent factors in obtaining the apprehension of fugitives who might\r\notherwise escape arrest and continue their criminal activities\r\nindefinitely. This type of identification also makes possible an\r\naccurate determination of the number of previous arrests and\r\nconvictions which, of course, results in the imposition of more\r\nequitable sentences by the judiciary, inasmuch as the individual who\r\nrepeatedly violates the law finds it impossible to pose successfully\r\nas a first, or minor, offender. In addition, this system of\r\nidentification enables the prosecutor to present his case in the light\r\nof the offender's previous record. It also provides the probation\r\nofficers, parole board, and the Governor with definite information\r\nupon which to base their judgment in dealing with criminals in their\r\njurisdictions.\r\n\r\nFrom earliest times fingerprinting, because of its peculiar\r\nadaptability to the field, has been associated in the lay mind with\r\ncriminal identification to the detriment of the other useful phases of\r\nthe science. However, the Civil File of the Identification Division of\r\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation contains three times as many\r\nfingerprints as the Criminal File. These civil fingerprints are an\r\ninvaluable aid in identifying amnesia victims, missing persons and\r\nunknown deceased. In the latter category the victims of major\r\ndisasters may be quickly and positively identified if their\r\nfingerprints are on file, thus providing a humanitarian benefit not\r\nusually associated with fingerprint records.\r\n\r\nThe regular contributors who voluntarily submit fingerprints to the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation play a most important role in the\r\ndrama of identification. Their action expands the size of the\r\nfingerprint files, thereby increasing the value of the files to all\r\nlaw enforcement agencies. Mutual cooperation and efficiency are\r\nresultant by-products.\r\n\r\nThe use of fingerprints for identification purposes is based upon\r\ndistinctive ridge outlines which appear on the bulbs on the inside of\r\nthe end joints of the fingers and thumbs. These ridges have definite\r\ncontours and appear in several general pattern types, each with\r\ngeneral and specific variations of the pattern, dependent on the shape\r\nand relationship of the ridges. The outlines of the ridges appear most\r\nclearly when inked impressions are taken upon paper, so that the\r\nridges are black against a white background. This result is achieved\r\nby the ink adhering to the friction ridges. Impressions may be made\r\nwith blood, dirt, grease or any other foreign matter present on the\r\nridges, or the saline substance emitted by the glands through the\r\nducts or pores which constitute their outlets. The background or\r\nmedium may be paper, glass, porcelain, wood, cloth, wax, putty,\r\nsilverware, or any smooth, nonporous material.\r\n\r\nOf all the methods of identification, fingerprinting alone has proved\r\nto be both infallible and feasible. Its superiority over the older\r\nmethods, such as branding, tattooing, distinctive clothing,\r\nphotography, and body measurements (Bertillon system), has been\r\ndemonstrated time after time. While many cases of mistaken\r\nidentification have occurred through the use of these older systems,\r\nto date the fingerprints of no two individuals have been found to be\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThe background and history of the science of fingerprints constitute\r\nan eloquent drama of human lives, of good and of evil. Nothing, I\r\nthink, has played a part more exciting than that enacted by the\r\nfascinating loops, whorls, and arches etched on the fingers of a human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n[Signature: J.

The establishment of the FBI Identification\r\nDivision resulted from the fact that police officials of the Nation\r\nsaw the need for a centralized pooling of all fingerprint cards and\r\nall arrest records.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation offers identification service free\r\nof charge for official use to all law enforcement agencies in this\r\ncountry and to foreign law enforcement agencies which cooperate in the\r\nInternational Exchange of Identification Data. Through this\r\ncentralization of records it is now possible for an officer to have\r\navailable a positive source of information relative to the past\r\nactivities of an individual in his custody. It is the Bureau's present\r\npolicy to give preferred attention to all arrest fingerprint cards\r\nsince it is realized that speed is essential in this service.\r\n\r\nIn order that the FBI Identification Division can provide maximum\r\nservice to all law enforcement agencies, it is essential that standard\r\nfingerprint cards and other forms furnished by the FBI be utilized.\r\nFingerprints must be clear and distinct and complete name and\r\ndescriptive data required on the form should be furnished in all\r\ninstances. Fingerprints should be submitted promptly since delay might\r\nresult in release of a fugitive prior to notification to the law\r\nenforcement agency seeking his apprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen it is known to a law enforcement agency that a subject under\r\narrest is an employee of the U.S. Government or a member of the Armed\r\nForces, a notation should be placed in the space for \"occupation\" on\r\nthe front of the fingerprint card. Data such as location of agency or\r\nmilitary post of assignment may be added beside the space reserved for\r\nthe photograph on the reverse side of the card.\r\n\r\nMany instances have been observed where an individual is fingerprinted\r\nby more than one law enforcement agency for the same arrest. This\r\nduplicate submission of fingerprints can be eliminated by placing a\r\nnotation on the first set of fingerprints sent to the FBI requesting\r\ncopies of the record for other interested law enforcement agencies,\r\nthereby eliminating submission of fingerprints by the latter agencies.\r\n\r\nIf a photograph is available at the time fingerprints are submitted to\r\nthe FBI Identification Division, it should be identified on the\r\nreverse side with the individual's complete name, name of the\r\ndepartment submitting, the department's number, and it should be\r\nsecurely pasted in the space provided on the fingerprint card. If a\r\nphotograph is to be submitted at a later date, it should be held until\r\nthe identification record or \"no record\" reply from the FBI is\r\nreceived in order that FBI number or fingerprint classification can be\r\nadded to the reverse side of the photograph for assistance of the\r\nIdentification Division in relating it to the proper record.\r\n\r\nThe FBI number, if known, and any request for special handling, such\r\nas collect wire or telephone reply, should be indicated on the\r\nfingerprint card in the appropriate space. Such notations eliminate\r\nthe need for an accompanying letter of instructions.\r\n\r\nAs indicated, the FBI's service is given without cost to regularly\r\nconstituted law enforcement agencies and officers. Supplies of\r\nfingerprint cards and self-addressed, franked envelopes will be\r\nforwarded upon the request of any law enforcement officer. The\r\nfollowing types of cards and forms are available: Criminal (Form\r\nFD-249), used for both arrest and institution records; Applicant (Form\r\nFD-258); Personal Identification (Form FD-353); Death Sheet (Form\r\nR-88); Disposition Sheet (Form R-84); Wanted Notice (Form 1-12);\r\nRecord of Additional Arrest (Form 1-1). An order form for\r\nidentification supplies appears each month with the insert to the FBI\r\nLaw Enforcement Bulletin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its criminal identification activities, the Bureau's\r\nIdentification Division maintains several auxiliary services. Not the\r\nleast of these is the system whereby fugitives are identified through\r\nthe comparison of fingerprints which are received currently. When a\r\nlaw enforcement officer desires the apprehension of a fugitive and the\r\nfingerprints of that individual are available, it is necessary only\r\nthat he inform the Bureau of this fact so a wanted notice may be\r\nplaced in the fugitive's record. This insures immediate notification\r\nwhen the fugitive's fingerprints are next received.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive service is amplified by the Bureau's action in\r\ntransmitting a monthly bulletin to all law enforcement agencies which\r\nforward fingerprints for its files. In this bulletin are listed the\r\nnames, descriptions, and fingerprint classifications of persons wanted\r\nfor offenses of a more serious character. This information facilitates\r\nprompt identifications of individuals arrested for any offense or\r\notherwise located by those receiving the bulletin.\r\n\r\nMissing-persons notices are posted in the Identification files so that\r\nany incoming record on the missing person will be noted. Notices are\r\nposted both by fingerprint card and by name, or by name alone if\r\nfingerprints are not available. The full name, date, and place of\r\nbirth, complete description and photograph of a missing person should\r\nbe forwarded, along with fingerprints, if available. Upon receipt of\r\npertinent information, the contributing agency is advised immediately.\r\nA section on missing persons is carried as an insert in the Law\r\nEnforcement Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThe FBI Identification Division has arranged with the identification\r\nbureaus of many foreign countries to exchange criminal identifying\r\ndata in cases of mutual interest. Fingerprints and arrest records of\r\npersons arrested in this country are routed to the appropriate foreign\r\nbureaus in cases when the interested agency in the United States has\r\nreason to believe an individual in custody may have a record in or be\r\nwanted by the other nation. Similarly, fingerprints are referred to\r\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation by foreign bureaus when it seems a\r\nrecord may be disclosed by a search of the Bureau's records. Numerous\r\nidentifications, including a number of fugitives, have been effected\r\nin this manner, and it is believed that the complete development of\r\nthis project will provide more effective law enforcement throughout\r\nthe world. When the facts indicate an individual may have a record in\r\nanother country, and the contributor submits an extra set of his\r\nfingerprints, they are transmitted by this Bureau to the proper\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIn very rare cases persons without hands are arrested. A file on\r\nfootprints is maintained in the Identification Division on such\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that many individuals in the underworld are known\r\nonly by their nicknames, the Identification Division has for years\r\nmaintained a card-index file containing in alphabetical order the\r\nnicknames appearing on fingerprint cards. When requesting a search of\r\nthe nickname file, it is desired that all possible descriptive data be\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nThe Latent Fingerprint Section handles latent print work. Articles of\r\nevidence submitted by law enforcement agencies are processed for the\r\ndevelopment of latent impressions in the Latent Fingerprint Section.\r\nIn addition, photographs, negatives, and lifts of latents are\r\nscrutinized for prints of value for identification purposes.\r\nPhotographs of the prints of value are always prepared for the FBI's\r\nfiles and are available for comparisons for an indefinite period.\r\nShould the law enforcement agency desire additional comparisons it\r\nneeds only advise the FBI Identification Division, attention Latent\r\nFingerprint Section, and either name or submit the prints of the new\r\nsuspect. It is not necessary to resubmit the evidence. When necessary,\r\na fingerprint expert will testify in local court as to his findings.\r\nShould a department have any special problems involving the\r\ndevelopment or preservation of fingerprints at a crime scene, the\r\nexperts are available for suggestions. In connection with the Latent\r\nFingerprint Section there is maintained a general appearance file of\r\nmany confidence game operators. Searches in this file will be made\r\nupon request. In furnishing data on a suspect, the agency should make\r\nsure that complete descriptive data is sent in. Photographs and other\r\nmaterial on individuals who may be identical with those being sought\r\nwill be furnished to the interested departments.\r\n\r\nDuring the years many persons have voluntarily submitted their\r\nfingerprints to the Identification Division for possible use in the\r\ncase of an emergency. These cards are not filed with the criminal\r\nfingerprints but are maintained separately. Such prints should be\r\ntaken on the standard fingerprint form entitled \"Personal\r\nIdentification\" (Form FD-353). No answer is given to Personal\r\nIdentification fingerprint cards.\r\n\r\nThe fingerprint records of the FBI Identification Division are used\r\nliberally not only by police agencies to obtain previous fingerprint\r\nhistories and to ascertain whether persons arrested are wanted\r\nelsewhere, but by prosecutors to whom the information from the\r\nBureau's files may prove to be valuable in connection with the\r\nprosecution of a case. These records are likewise of frequent value to\r\nthe judge for his consideration in connection with the imposition of\r\nsentence. Obviously, the ends of justice may be served most equitably\r\nwhen the past fingerprint record of the person on trial can be made\r\nknown to the court, or information may be furnished to the effect that\r\nthe defendant is of hitherto unblemished reputation.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that FBI identification records are for the\r\n_OFFICIAL_ use of law enforcement and governmental agencies and misuse\r\nof such records by disseminating them to unauthorized persons may\r\nresult in cancellation of FBI identification services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Types of Patterns and Their Interpretation_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Types of patterns_\r\n\r\nFingerprints may be resolved into three large general groups of\r\npatterns, each group bearing the same general characteristics or\r\nfamily resemblance. The patterns may be further divided into\r\nsub-groups by means of the smaller differences existing between the\r\npatterns in the same general group. These divisions are as follows:\r\n\r\n     I. ARCH\r\n\r\n     _a._ Plain arch.\r\n     _b._ Tented arch.\r\n\r\n     II. LOOP\r\n\r\n     _a._ Radial loop.\r\n     _b._ Ulnar loop.\r\n\r\n     III. WHORL\r\n\r\n     _a._ Plain whorl.\r\n     _b._ Central pocket loop.\r\n     _c._ Double loop.\r\n     _d._ Accidental whorl.\r\n\r\nIllustrations 1 to 10 are examples of the various types of fingerprint\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1.

Accidental.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interpretation_\r\n\r\nBefore pattern definition can be understood, it is necessary to\r\nunderstand the meaning of a few technical terms used in fingerprint\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe _pattern area_ is the only part of the finger impression with\r\nwhich we are concerned in regard to interpretation and classification.\r\nIt is present in all patterns, of course, but in many arches and\r\ntented arches it is impossible to define. This is not important,\r\nhowever, as the only patterns in which we need to define the pattern\r\narea for classification purposes are loops and whorls. In these two\r\npattern types the pattern area may be defined as follows:\r\n\r\n_The pattern area is that part of a loop or whorl in which appear the\r\ncores, deltas, and ridges with which we are concerned in classifying._\r\n\r\n_The pattern areas of loops and whorls are enclosed by type lines._\r\n\r\n_Type lines may be defined as the two innermost ridges which start\r\nparallel, diverge, and surround or tend to surround the pattern area._\r\n\r\nFigure 11 is a typical loop. Lines A and B, which have been emphasized\r\nin this sketch, are the type lines, starting parallel, diverging at\r\nthe line C and surrounding the pattern area, which is emphasized in\r\nfigure 12 by eliminating all the ridges within the pattern area.\r\n\r\nFigures 72 through 101 should be studied for the location of type\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18]\r\n\r\nType lines are not always two continuous ridges. In fact, they are\r\nmore often found to be broken. When there is a definite break in a\r\ntype line, the ridge immediately _outside_ of it is considered as its\r\ncontinuation, as shown by the emphasized ridges in figure 13.\r\n\r\nSometimes type lines may be very short. Care must be exercised in\r\ntheir location. Notice the right type line in figure 14.\r\n\r\nWhen locating type lines it is necessary to keep in mind the\r\ndistinction between a divergence and a bifurcation (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n_A bifurcation is the forking or dividing of one line into two or more\r\nbranches._\r\n\r\n_A divergence is the spreading apart of two lines which have been\r\nrunning parallel or nearly parallel._\r\n\r\nAccording to the narrow meaning of the words in fingerprint parlance,\r\na single ridge may bifurcate, but it may not be said to diverge.\r\nTherefore, with one exception, the two forks of a bifurcation may\r\nnever constitute type lines. The exception is when the forks run\r\nparallel after bifurcating and then diverge. In such a case the two\r\nforks become the two innermost ridges required by the definition. In\r\nillustration 16, the ridges marked \"A--A\" are type lines even though\r\nthey proceed from a bifurcation. In figure 17, however, the ridges\r\nA--A are not the type lines because the forks of the bifurcation do\r\nnot run parallel with each other. Instead, the ridges marked \"T\" are\r\nthe type lines.\r\n\r\nAngles are never formed by a single ridge but by the abutting of one\r\nridge against another. Therefore, an angular formation cannot be used\r\nas a type line. In figure 18, ridges A and B join at an angle. Ridge B\r\ndoes not run parallel with ridge D; ridge A does not diverge. Ridges C\r\nand D, therefore, are the type lines.\r\n\r\n_Focal points_--Within the pattern areas of loops and whorls are\r\nenclosed the focal points which are used to classify them. These\r\npoints are called delta and core.\r\n\r\n_The delta is that point on a ridge at or in front of and nearest the\r\ncenter of the divergence of the type lines._\r\n\r\nIt may be:\r\n\r\n     - A bifurcation\r\n\r\n     - An abrupt ending ridge\r\n\r\n     - A dot\r\n\r\n     - A short ridge\r\n\r\n     - A meeting of two ridges\r\n\r\n     - A point on the first recurving ridge located nearest to\r\n     the center and in front of the divergence of the type lines.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the delta may perhaps be clarified by further\r\nexposition. Webster furnishes the following definition: \"(1) Delta is\r\nthe name of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet (equivalent to\r\nthe English D) from the Phoenician name for the corresponding letter.\r\nThe Greeks called the alluvial deposit at the mouth of the Nile, from\r\nits shape, the Delta of the Nile. (2) A tract of land shaped like the\r\nletter \"delta,\" especially when the land is alluvial, and enclosed\r\nwithin two or more mouths of a river, as the Delta of the Ganges, of\r\nthe Nile, of the Mississippi\" (fig. 19).\r\n\r\nWhen the use of the word \"delta\" in physical geography is fully\r\ngrasped, its fitness as applied in fingerprint work will become\r\nevident. Rivers wear away their banks and carry them along in their\r\nwaters in the form of a fine sediment. As the rivers unite with seas\r\nor lakes, the onward sweep of the water is lessened, and the sediment,\r\nbecoming comparatively still, sinks to the bottom where there is\r\nformed a shoal which gradually grows, as more and more is\r\nprecipitated, until at length a portion of the shoal becomes higher\r\nthan the ordinary level of the stream. There is a similarity between\r\nthe use of the word \"delta\" in physical geography and in fingerprints.\r\nThe island formed in front of the diverging sides of the banks where\r\nthe stream empties at its mouth corresponds to the delta in\r\nfingerprints, which is the first obstruction of any nature at the\r\npoint of divergence of the type lines in front of or nearest the\r\ncenter of the divergence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20]\r\n\r\nIn figure 20, the dot marked \"delta\" is considered as the delta\r\nbecause it is the first ridge or part of a ridge nearest the point of\r\ndivergence of the two type lines. If the dot were not present, point B\r\non ridge C, as shown in the figure, would be considered as the delta.\r\nThis would be equally true whether the ridges were connected with one\r\nof the type lines, both type lines, or disconnected altogether. In\r\nfigure 20, with the dot as the delta, the first ridge count is ridge\r\nC. If the dot were not present, point B on ridge C would be considered\r\nas the delta and the first count would be ridge D. The lines X--X and\r\nY--Y are the type lines, not X--A and Y--Z.\r\n\r\nIn figures 21 to 24, the heavy lines A--A and B--B are type lines with\r\nthe delta at point D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26]\r\n\r\nFigure 25 shows ridge A bifurcating from the lower type line inside\r\nthe pattern area. Bifurcations are also present within this pattern at\r\npoints B and C. The bifurcation at the point marked \"delta\" is the\r\nonly one which fulfills all conditions necessary for its location. It\r\nshould be understood that the diverging type lines must be present in\r\nall delta formations and that wherever one of the formations mentioned\r\nin the definition of a delta may be, it must be located midway between\r\ntwo diverging type lines at or just in front of where they diverge in\r\norder to satisfy the definition and qualify as a delta.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a choice between two or more possible deltas, the\r\nfollowing rules govern:\r\n\r\n     - _The delta may not be located at a bifurcation which does\r\n     not open toward the core._\r\n\r\nIn figure 26, the bifurcation at E is closer to the core than the\r\nbifurcation at D. However, E is not immediately in front of the\r\ndivergence of the type lines and it _does not_ open toward the core.\r\nA--A and B--B are the only possible type lines in this sketch and it\r\nfollows, therefore, that the bifurcation at D must be called the\r\ndelta. The first ridge count would be ridge C.\r\n\r\n     - _When there is a choice between a bifurcation and another\r\n     type of delta, the bifurcation is selected._\r\n\r\nA problem of this type is shown in figure 27. The dot, A, and the\r\nbifurcation are equally close to the divergence of the type lines, but\r\nthe bifurcation is selected as the delta. The ridges marked \"T\" are\r\nthe type lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28]\r\n\r\n     - _When there are two or more possible deltas which conform\r\n     to the definition, the one nearest the core is chosen._\r\n\r\nPrints are sometimes found wherein a single ridge enters the pattern\r\narea with two or more bifurcations opening toward the core. Figure 28\r\nis an example of this. Ridge A enters the pattern area and bifurcates\r\nat points X and D. The bifurcation at D, which is the closer to the\r\ncore, is the delta and conforms to the rule for deltas. A--A and B--B\r\nare the type lines. A bifurcation which does not conform to the\r\ndefinition should not be considered as a delta irrespective of its\r\ndistance from the core.\r\n\r\n     - _The delta may not be located in the middle of a ridge\r\n     running between the type lines toward the core, but at the\r\n     nearer end only._\r\n\r\nThe location of the delta in this case depends entirely upon the point\r\nof origin of the ridge running between the type lines toward the core.\r\nIf the ridge is entirely within the pattern area, the delta is located\r\nat the end nearer the point of divergence of the type lines. Figure 29\r\nis an example of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30]\r\n\r\nIf the ridge enters the pattern area from a point below the divergence\r\nof the type lines, however, the delta must be located at the end\r\nnearer the core. Ridge A in figure 30 is of this type.\r\n\r\nIn figure 31, A--A and B--B are the type lines, with the dot as the\r\ndelta. The bifurcations cannot be considered as they do not open\r\ntoward the core.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32]\r\n\r\nIn figure 32, the dot cannot be the delta because line D cannot be\r\nconsidered as a type line. It does not run parallel to type line A--A\r\nat any point. The same reason prevents line E from being a type line.\r\nThe end of ridge E is the only possible delta as it is a point on the\r\nridge nearest to the center of divergence of the type lines. The other\r\ntype line is, of course, B--B.\r\n\r\nThe delta is the point from which to start in ridge counting. In the\r\nloop type pattern the ridges intervening between the delta and the\r\ncore are counted. The core is the second of the two focal points.\r\n\r\n_The core_, as the name implies, is the approximate center of the\r\nfinger impression. It will be necessary to concern ourselves with the\r\ncore of the loop type only. The following rules govern the selection\r\nof the core of a loop:\r\n\r\n     - _The core is placed upon or within the innermost\r\n     sufficient recurve._\r\n\r\n     - _When the innermost sufficient recurve contains no ending\r\n     ridge or rod rising as high as the shoulders of the loop,\r\n     the core is placed on the shoulder of the loop farther from\r\n     the delta._\r\n\r\n     - _When the innermost sufficient recurve contains an uneven\r\n     number of rods rising as high as the shoulders, the core is\r\n     placed upon the end of the center rod whether it touches the\r\n     looping ridge or not._\r\n\r\n     - _When the innermost sufficient recurve contains an even\r\n     number of rods rising as high as the shoulders, the core is\r\n     placed upon the end of the farther one of the two center\r\n     rods, the two center rods being treated as though they were\r\n     connected by a recurving ridge._\r\n\r\n_The shoulders of a loop are the points at which the recurving ridge\r\ndefinitely turns inward or curves._\r\n\r\nFigures 33 to 38 reflect the focal points of a series of loops. In\r\nfigure 39, there are two rods, but the rod marked \"A\" does not rise as\r\nhigh as the shoulder line X, so the core is at B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34]\r\n\r\nFigures 40 to 45 illustrate the rule that a recurve must have no\r\nappendage abutting upon it at a right angle between the shoulders and\r\non the outside. If such an appendage is present between the shoulders\r\nof a loop, that loop is considered spoiled and the next loop outside\r\nwill be considered to locate the core. In each of the figures, the\r\npoint C indicates the core. Appendages will be further explained in\r\nthe section concerning loops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 38]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 39]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 40]\r\n\r\nFigures 46 to 48 reflect interlocking loops at the center, while\r\nfigure 49 has two loops side by side at the center. In all these cases\r\nthe two loops are considered as one. In figure 46, when the shoulder\r\nline X--X is drawn it is found to cross exactly at the point of\r\nintersection of the two loops. The two loops are considered one, with\r\none rod, the core being placed at C. In figure 47, the shoulder line\r\nX--X is above the point of intersection of the two loops. The two are\r\nconsidered as one, with two rods, the core being at C. In figure 48,\r\nthe shoulder line X--X is below the point of intersection of the\r\nloops. Again the two are treated as one, with two rods, the core being\r\nplaced at C. In figure 49, the two are treated as one, with two rods,\r\nthe core being placed at C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 44]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 47]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 48]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 49]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 50]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 51]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 52]\r\n\r\nIn figure 50, the delta is formed by a bifurcation which is not\r\nconnected with either of the type lines. The first ridge count in this\r\ninstance is ridge C. If the bifurcation were not present, the delta\r\nwould be a point on ridge C and the first ridge count would be ridge\r\nD. In figure 51, the ridge which bifurcates is connected with the\r\nlower type line. The delta in this would be located on the\r\nbifurcation as designated and the first ridge count would be ridge C.\r\nFigure 52 reflects the same type of delta shown in the previous figure\r\nin that the ridge is bifurcating from a type line and then bifurcates\r\nagain to form the delta.\r\n\r\n_A white space must intervene between the delta and the first ridge\r\ncount._ If no such interval exists, the first ridge must be\r\ndisregarded. In figures 53 and 54, the first ridge beyond the delta is\r\ncounted. In figure 55, it is not counted because there is no interval\r\nbetween it and the delta. Notice that the ridge running from the delta\r\ntoward the core is in a straight line between them. If it were not, of\r\ncourse, an interval would intervene as in figures 53 and 54.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 54]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 55]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The loop_\r\n\r\nIn fingerprints, as well as in the usual application of the word\r\n\"loop,\" there cannot be a loop unless there is a recurve or turning\r\nback on itself of one or more of the ridges. Other conditions have to\r\nbe considered, however. A pattern must possess several requisites\r\nbefore it may be properly classified as a loop. This type of pattern\r\nis the most numerous of all and constitutes about 65 percent of all\r\nprints.\r\n\r\n_A loop is that type of fingerprint pattern in which one or more of\r\nthe ridges enter on either side of the impression, recurve, touch or\r\npass an imaginary line drawn from the delta to the core, and terminate\r\nor tend to terminate on or toward the same side of the impression from\r\nwhence such ridge or ridges entered._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Essentials of a loop_\r\n\r\n     - A sufficient recurve.\r\n\r\n     - A delta.\r\n\r\n     - A ridge count across a looping ridge.\r\n\r\n_A sufficient recurve may be defined as that part of a recurving ridge\r\nbetween the shoulders of a loop. It must be free of any appendages\r\nabutting upon the outside of the recurve at a right angle._\r\n\r\n_Appendages_--Some explanation is necessary of the importance attached\r\nto appendages. Much care must be exercised in interpreting appendages\r\nbecause they sometimes change the shape of the recurving ridge to\r\nwhich they are connected. For example, a loop with an appendage\r\nabutting upon its recurve between the shoulders and at right angles,\r\nas in illustration 56, will appear sometimes as in illustration 57\r\nwith the recurve totally destroyed. For further examples see figures\r\n161 to 184.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 57]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of a whorl recurve, as in figures 58 and 59.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to consider and classify figures 56 and 58\r\nas if they actually appeared as in figures 57 and 59.\r\n\r\nIn figure 60, there is a ridge marked \"A\" which enters on one side of\r\nthe impression and, after recurving, passes an imaginary line drawn\r\nfrom the core C to delta D, and terminates on the same side of the\r\nimpression from which it entered, marked \"B\", thus fulfilling all the\r\nconditions required in the definition of a loop. X and Y are the type\r\nlines. It will be noted in figure 61 that there is a ridge which\r\nenters on one side of the impression, recurves, and passes an\r\nimaginary line drawn from the delta to the core. It does not terminate\r\non the side from which it entered but has a tendency to do so. In this\r\ncase, all the requirements of the loop have been met, and consequently\r\nit is classified as such.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 58]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 59]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60]\r\n\r\nFigure 62 shows a ridge entering on one side of the impression,\r\nrecurving, and passing beyond an imaginary line drawn from the delta\r\nto the core, although opposite from the pattern shown in figure 61.\r\nAfter passing the imaginary line, the recurving ridge does not\r\nterminate on the side of the impression from which it entered, but it\r\nhas a tendency to do so, and the pattern is, therefore, a loop.\r\n\r\nIn figure 63, a ridge enters on one side of the impression and then\r\nrecurves, containing two rods within it, each of which rises as high\r\nas the shoulder of the loop. From our study of cores, we know that the\r\ntop of the rod more distant from the delta is the core, but the\r\nrecurving ridge does not pass the imaginary line. For that reason the\r\npattern is not classified as a loop, but is given the preferential\r\nclassification of a tented arch due to the lack of one of the loop\r\nrequisites. The proper location of the core and delta is of extreme\r\nimportance, for an error in the location of either might cause this\r\npattern to be classified as a loop.\r\n\r\nFigure 64 reflects a similar condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 61]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 62]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 63]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 64]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 65]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 66]\r\n\r\nIn figure 65, there is a looping ridge A which enters on one side of\r\nthe impression. The ridges B and C are the type lines. As determined\r\nby rules already stated, the location of the core and the location of\r\nthe delta are shown, and if an imaginary line were placed on the core\r\nand delta, the recurving ridge A would cross it. This is another\r\nfigure showing a ridge which does not terminate on the side of the\r\nimpression from which it entered but tends to do so, and, therefore,\r\nis considered as a loop.\r\n\r\nIn figure 66, we have a print which is similar in many respects to the\r\none described in the preceding paragraph, but here the recurving ridge\r\nA continues and tends to terminate on the _opposite_ side of the\r\nimpression from which it entered. For this reason the pattern is not a\r\nloop, but a tented arch. The recurving ridge must touch or pass the\r\nimaginary line between delta and core and at least tend to pass out\r\ntoward the side from which it entered, so that a ridge count of at\r\nleast one can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 67]\r\n\r\nFigure 67 shows a ridge which enters on one side of the impression\r\nand, after flowing toward the center, turns or loops on itself and\r\nterminates on the same side from whence it entered. This pattern would\r\nbe classified as a loop. This pattern should be distinguished from the\r\npattern appearing in figure 139. Careful study of the pattern in\r\nfigure 67 reveals that the core is located at C and the delta D. The\r\nimaginary line between these points will be crossed by the ridge\r\nforming a loop. In figure 139, the core is located on the recurve and\r\nan imaginary line between the delta and the core does not cross a\r\nlooping ridge. Figure 139 is thus classified as a tented arch, as will\r\nbe seen later.\r\n\r\nFigure 68 shows at the center of the print a ridge which forms a\r\npocket. It will be noticed that ridge A does not begin on the edge of\r\nthe print, but this is of no significance. The ridge A within the\r\npattern area recurves or loops, passing the imaginary line between the\r\ndelta and the core, and tends to terminate toward the same side of the\r\nimpression from whence it entered. This is a loop pattern possessing\r\nall of the requirements.\r\n\r\nIn figures 69 and 70, it will be observed that there is a ridge\r\nentering on one side of the pattern which recurves and then turns back\r\non itself. These patterns are different from any others which have\r\nbeen shown in this respect but are classified as loops. In each of the\r\npatterns the core and delta are marked \"C\" and \"D\". The reader should\r\ntrace the type lines in order to ascertain why the delta is located at\r\npoint D, and then apply the delta rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 68]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 69]\r\n\r\nFigure 71 is an example of loops as they appear on the rolled\r\nimpression portion of a fingerprint card.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 70]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 71]\r\n\r\nRight Hand\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1.

Neither delta nor\r\ncore is counted. A red line upon the reticule of the fingerprint glass\r\nis used to insure absolute accuracy. In the event there is a\r\nbifurcation of a ridge exactly at the point where the imaginary line\r\nwould be drawn, two ridges are counted. Where the line crosses an\r\nisland, both sides are counted. Fragments and dots are counted as\r\nridges only if they appear to be as thick and heavy as the other\r\nridges in the immediate pattern. Variations in inking and pressure\r\nmust, of course, be considered.\r\n\r\nFigures 72 to 97 and figures 98 to 101 show various loop patterns. The\r\nreader should examine each one carefully in order to study the cores\r\nand deltas and to verify the count which has been placed below each\r\npattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 72. 12 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 73. 2 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 74. 16 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 75. 7 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 76. 4 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 77. 7 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 78. 15 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 79. 16 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. 9 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. 3 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 82. 9 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 83. 20 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 84. 6 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 85. 2 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. 8 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 87. 14 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 88. 5 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 89. 12 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 90. 12 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 91. 3 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 92. 16 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93. 14 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 94. 16 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. 18 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 96. 2 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 97. 1 count.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. 1 count.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 99. 2 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. 8 counts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. 13 counts.]\r\n\r\nFigure 102 is a sketch reflecting the various types of ridges which\r\nthe classifier will encounter when engaging in counting loop patterns.\r\n\r\nIn figure 103, the lighter lines are caused by the splitting or\r\nfraying of the ridges. Sometimes ingrained dirt will cause a similar\r\ncondition between the ridges. These lines are not considered ridges\r\nand should not be counted.\r\n\r\nIn figure 104, the dot is not the delta because it is not as thick and\r\nheavy as the other ridges and might not be present if the finger were\r\nnot perfectly inked and printed.\r\n\r\nWhen the core is located on a spike which touches the inside of the\r\ninnermost recurving ridge, the recurve is included in the ridge count\r\nonly when the delta is located below a line drawn at right angles to\r\nthe spike.\r\n\r\nFigures 105 and 106 are examples of this rule.\r\n\r\nIf the delta is located in areas A, the recurving ridge is counted.\r\n\r\nIf the delta is located in areas B, the recurving ridge is not\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102]\r\n\r\n     LOOP\r\n     25 RIDGE COUNTS\r\n\r\n     1.

Loops which flow in the direction of the ulna\r\nbone (toward the little finger) are called ulnar loops and those which\r\nflow in the direction of the radius bone are called radial loops.\r\n\r\nFor test purposes, fingers of the right hand may be placed on the\r\ncorresponding print of the right hand appearing in figure 71, and it\r\nwill be noticed that the side of each finger which is nearer to the\r\nthumb on the hand is also nearer to the thumb on the fingerprint card.\r\nPlace the fingers of the _left_ hand on the corresponding prints of\r\nthe _left_ hand shown in figure 71. It will be noticed that the\r\narrangement of the prints on the card is the _reverse_ of the\r\narrangement of the fingers on the hand. _The classification of loops\r\nis based on the way the loops flow on the hand (not the card), so that\r\non the fingerprint card for the left hand, loops flowing toward the\r\nthumb impression are ulnar, and loops flowing toward the little finger\r\nimpression are radial._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The plain arch_\r\n\r\n_In plain arches the ridges enter on one side of the impression and\r\nflow or tend to flow out the other with a rise or wave in the center._\r\nThe plain arch is the most simple of all fingerprint patterns, and it\r\nis easily distinguished. Figures 107 to 118 are examples of the plain\r\narch. It will be noted that there may be various ridge formations such\r\nas ending ridges, bifurcations, dots and islands involved in this type\r\nof pattern, but they all tend to follow the general ridge contour;\r\ni.e., they enter on one side, make a rise or wave in the center, and\r\nflow or tend to flow out the other side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 107]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110]\r\n\r\nFigures 119 and 120 are examples of plain arches which approximate\r\ntented arches. Also, figure 121 is a plain arch approximating a tented\r\narch as the rising ridge cannot be considered an upthrust because it\r\nis a continuous, and not an ending, ridge. (See following explanation\r\nof the tented arch.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 111]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 113]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 114]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 115]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 116]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 117]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 118]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 119]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 121]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The tented arch_\r\n\r\nIn the tented arch, most of the ridges enter upon one side of the\r\nimpression and flow or tend to flow out upon the other side, as in the\r\nplain arch type; however, the ridge or ridges at the center do not.\r\nThere are three types of tented arches:\r\n\r\n     - The type in which ridges at the center form a definite\r\n     angle; i.e., 90° or less.\r\n\r\n     - The type in which one or more ridges at the center form an\r\n     upthrust. An upthrust is an ending ridge of any length\r\n     rising at a sufficient degree from the horizontal plane;\r\n     i.e., 45° or more.\r\n\r\n     - The type approaching the loop type, possessing two of the\r\n     basic or essential characteristics of the loop, but lacking\r\n     the third.\r\n\r\nFigures 122 to 133 are examples of the tented arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 123]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 125]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 126]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 127]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 129]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 130]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 131]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 133]\r\n\r\nFigures 122 to 124 are of the type possessing an angle.\r\n\r\nFigures 125 to 129 reflect the type possessing an upthrust.\r\n\r\nFigures 130 to 133 show the type approaching the loop but lacking one\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nTented arches and some forms of the loop are often confused. It should\r\nbe remembered by the reader that the _mere converging of two ridges\r\ndoes not form a recurve, without which there can be no loop_. On the\r\nother hand, there are many patterns which at first sight resemble\r\ntented arches but which on close inspection are found to be loops, as\r\nwhere one looping ridge will be found in an almost vertical position\r\nwithin the pattern area, entirely free from and passing in front of\r\nthe delta.\r\n\r\nFigure 134 is a tented arch. The ridge marked \"A--A\" in the sketch\r\nenters on one side of the impression and flows to the other with an\r\nacute rise in the center. Ridge C strikes into A at point B and should\r\nnot be considered as a bifurcating ridge. The ridges marked \"D--D\"\r\nwould form a tented arch if the rest of the pattern were absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 134]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135]\r\n\r\nFigure 135 is a sketch of a pattern reflecting a ridge, A--B, entering\r\non one side of the impression, recurving, and making its exit on the\r\nother side of the impression. The reader should study this sketch\r\ncarefully. It should be borne in mind that there must be a ridge\r\nentering on one side of the impression and recurving in order to make\r\nits exit on the same side from which it entered, or having a tendency\r\nto make its exit on that side, before a pattern can be considered for\r\npossible classification as a loop. This pattern is a tented arch of\r\nthe upthrust type. The upthrust is C. There is also an angle at E. D\r\ncannot be termed as a delta, as the ridge to the left of D cannot be\r\nconsidered a type line because it does not diverge from the ridge to\r\nthe right of D but turns and goes in the same direction.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the types of tented arches, the reader is referred\r\nto the third type. This form of tented arch, the one which approaches\r\nthe loop, may have _any combination of two of the three basic loop\r\ncharacteristics, lacking the third_. These three loop characteristics\r\nare, to repeat:\r\n\r\n     - _A sufficient recurve._\r\n\r\n     - _A delta._\r\n\r\n     - _A ridge count across a looping ridge._\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that a recurve must be free of any appendage\r\nabutting upon it at a right angle between the shoulders, and a true\r\nridge count is obtained only by crossing a looping ridge freely, with\r\na white space intervening between the delta and the ridge to be\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 136]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 137]\r\n\r\nFigures 136 and 137 are tented arches having loop formations within\r\nthe pattern area but with deltas upon the loops, by reason of which it\r\nis impossible to secure a ridge count. The type lines run parallel\r\nfrom the left in figures 136 and 137. These tented arches have two of\r\nthe loop characteristics, recurve and delta, but lack the third, the\r\nridge count.\r\n\r\nIn figure 138, the reader will note the similarity to the figures 136\r\nand 137. The only difference is that in this figure the type lines are\r\nrunning parallel from the right. It will be noted from these three\r\npatterns that the spaces between the type lines at their divergence\r\nshow nothing which could be considered as delta formations except the\r\nlooping ridges. Such patterns are classified as tented arches because\r\nthe ridge count necessary for a loop is lacking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 138]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 139]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 140]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 141]\r\n\r\nFigure 139 is an example of a tented arch. In this pattern, if the\r\nlooping ridge approached the vertical it could possibly be a one-count\r\nloop. Once studied, however, the pattern presents no real difficulty.\r\nThere are no ridges intervening between the delta, which is formed by\r\na bifurcation, and the core. It will be noted that the core, in this\r\ncase, is at the center of the recurve, unlike those loops which are\r\nbroadside to the delta and in which the core is placed upon the\r\nshoulder. This pattern has a recurve and a separate delta, but it\r\nstill lacks the ridge count necessary to make it a loop.\r\n\r\nFigures 140 and 141 are examples of tented arches. These two figures\r\nare similar in many ways. Each of these prints has three abrupt ending\r\nridges but lacks a recurve; however, in figure 141 a delta is present\r\nin addition to the three abrupt ending ridges. This condition does not\r\nexist in figure 140, where the lower ending ridge is the delta.\r\n\r\nWhen interpreting a pattern consisting of two ending ridges and a\r\ndelta but lacking a recurve, do not confuse the ridge count of the\r\ntented arch with that of the ridge count for the loop. The ridge count\r\nof the tented arch is merely a convention of fingerprinting, a fiction\r\ndesigned to facilitate a scientific classification of tented arches,\r\nand has no connection with a loop. To obtain a true ridge count there\r\nmust be a looping ridge which is crossed freely by an imaginary line\r\ndrawn between the delta and the core. The ridge count referred to as\r\nsuch in connection with the tented arches possessing ending ridges and\r\nno recurve is obtained by imagining that the ending ridges are joined\r\nby a recurve only for the purpose of locating the core and obtaining a\r\nridge count. If this point is secure in the mind of the classifier,\r\nlittle difficulty will be encountered.\r\n\r\nFigures 140 and 141, then, are tented arches because they have two of\r\nthe characteristics of a loop, delta and ridge count, but lack the\r\nthird, the recurve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 142]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 143]\r\n\r\nFigure 142 is a loop formation connected with the delta but having no\r\nridge count across a looping ridge. By drawing an imaginary line from\r\nthe core, which is at the top of the rod in the center of the pattern,\r\nto the delta, it will be noted that there is no recurving ridge\r\npassing between this rod and the delta; and, therefore, no ridge count\r\ncan result. This pattern is classified as a tented arch. There must be\r\na white space between the delta and the first ridge counted, or it may\r\nnot be counted. Figure 143 is also a tented arch because no ridge\r\ncount across a looping ridge can be obtained, the bifurcations being\r\nconnected to each other and to the loop in a straight line between\r\ndelta and core. The looping ridge is not crossed freely. No white\r\nspace intervenes between the delta and the loop. These patterns are\r\ntented arches because they possess two of the characteristics of a\r\nloop, a delta and a recurve, but lack the third, a ridge count across\r\na looping ridge.\r\n\r\nFigure 144 is a tented arch combining two of the types. There is an\r\nangle formed by ridge _a_ abutting upon ridge _b_. There are also the\r\nelements of the type approaching a loop, as it has a delta and ridge\r\ncount but lacks a recurve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 144]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 146]\r\n\r\nFigures 145 to 148 are tented arches because of the angles formed by\r\nthe abutting ridges at the center of the patterns.\r\n\r\nFigure 149 is a tented arch because of the upthrust present at the\r\ncenter of the pattern. The presence of the slightest upthrust at the\r\ncenter of the impression is enough to make a pattern a tented arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 147]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 148]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 149]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 150]\r\n\r\nAn upthrust must be an ending ridge. If continuous as in figure 150,\r\nno angle being present, the pattern is classified as a plain arch.\r\n\r\nFigures 151 to 153 are plain arches. Figure 154 is a tented arch.\r\n\r\nFigure 155 is a plain arch because it is readily seen that the\r\napparent upthrust A is a continuation of the curving ridge B. Figure\r\n156 is a tented arch because ridge A is an independent upthrust, and\r\nnot a continuation of ridge B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 152]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 153]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 154]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 155]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 156]\r\n\r\nFigures 157 and 158 are plain arches. Figure 158 cannot be said to be\r\na looping ridge, because by definition a loop must pass out or tend to\r\npass out upon the side from which it entered. This apparent loop\r\npasses out upon the opposite side and cannot be said to tend to flow\r\nout upon the same side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 157]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 158]\r\n\r\nIn figures 159 and 160, there are ending ridges rising at about the\r\nsame degree from the horizontal plane.\r\n\r\nFigure 159, however, is a plain arch, while 160 is a tented arch. This\r\ndifferentiation is necessary because, if the first pattern were\r\nprinted crookedly upon the fingerprint card so that the ending ridge\r\nwas nearer the horizontal plane, there would be no way to ascertain\r\nthe true horizontal plane of the pattern (if the fissure of the finger\r\ndid not appear). In other words, there would be no means of knowing\r\nthat there was sufficient rise to be called an upthrust, so that it is\r\nsafe to classify the print as a plain arch only. In figure 160,\r\nhowever, no matter how it is printed, the presence of a sufficient\r\nrise could always be ascertained because of the space intervening\r\nbetween the ending ridge and the ridge immediately beneath it, so that\r\nit is safe to classify such a pattern as a tented arch. The test is,\r\n_if the ridges on both sides of the ending ridge follow its direction\r\nor flow trend, the print may be classified as a plain arch. If,\r\nhowever, the ridges on only one side follow its direction, the print\r\nis a tented arch_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 159]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 160]\r\n\r\nAn upthrust, then, must not only be an ending ridge rising at a\r\nsufficient degree from the horizontal plane, but there must also be a\r\nspace between the ending ridge and the ridge immediately beneath it.\r\n_This, however, is not necessary for a short upthrust or spike, or any\r\nupthrust which rises perpendicularly._\r\n\r\nIn connection with the proper classification to be assigned to those\r\nborderline loop-tented arch cases where an appendage or spike is\r\nthrusting out from the recurve, it is necessary to remember that _an\r\nappendage or a spike abutting upon a recurve at right angles in the\r\nspace between the shoulders of a loop on the outside is considered to\r\nspoil the recurve_.\r\n\r\nIf the appending ridge flows off the looping ridge smoothly in such a\r\nway that it forms a bifurcation and not an abutment of two ridges at a\r\nright angle, the recurve is considered as remaining intact. The test\r\nis to trace the looping ridge toward the appendage, and if, when it is\r\nreached, the tracing may be continued as readily upon the appendage as\r\nupon the looping ridge, with no sudden, sharp change of direction, the\r\nrecurve is sufficient. Figures 161 to 184 should be studied with this\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 161. Tented arch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 162. Tented arch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 163.

Loop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 183. Loop.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 184. Loop.]\r\n\r\nFigures 185 to 190 show additional examples of tented arches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 185]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 186]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 187]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 188]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 189]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 190]\r\n\r\nThe reason that figure 185 is given the classification of a tented\r\narch is because of the presence of all the loop requirements with the\r\nexception of one, which is the recurve. In this pattern appear three\r\nending ridges. The lowest ending ridge provides the delta, and the\r\nother two by the convention explained previously, provide the ridge\r\ncount. It is a tented arch, then, of the type approaching the loop,\r\nwith two of the characteristics, but lacking the third, a recurve.\r\nFigures 186 and 187 are tented arches of the same type. A close\r\nexamination of these prints will reveal that when the imaginary line\r\nis drawn between delta and core no ridge count across a looping ridge\r\ncan be obtained. It must be remembered that the core of a loop may not\r\nbe placed below the shoulder line. Lacking one of the three\r\ncharacteristics of a loop, these patterns must be classified as tented\r\narches. When figure 188 is examined, it will be noticed that the\r\nrecurve is spoiled by the appendage abutting upon it between the\r\nshoulders at a right angle, so it must also be classified with the\r\ntented arches. In figure 189, the only possible delta must be placed\r\nupon the looping ridge, thus preventing a ridge count although delta\r\nand recurve are present. Figure 190 is assigned the classification of\r\na tented arch. One of the requirements of a loop type is that the\r\nridge enters on one side, recurves, and makes its exit on the side\r\nfrom which it entered. This, of course, makes it necessary that the\r\nridge pass between the delta and the core. It will be noted from this\r\nfigure that although this ridge passes between the delta and the core,\r\nit does not show any tendency to make its exit on the side from which\r\nit entered, and therefore the loop classification is precluded, and it\r\nis a tented arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The whorl_\r\n\r\nThe patterns to which numerical values are assigned in deriving the\r\n\"primary\" in the extension of the Henry System of fingerprint\r\nclassification used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are the\r\nwhorl-type patterns, which occur in about 30 percent of all\r\nfingerprints.\r\n\r\n_The whorl is that type of pattern in which at least two deltas are\r\npresent with a recurve in front in each._ Figures 191 to 193 reflect\r\nthe minimum requirements for the whorl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 191]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 192]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 193]\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the above definition is very general;\r\nhowever, this pattern may be subdivided for extension purposes in\r\nlarge groups where whorls are predominant. Even though this extension\r\nmay be used, all types of whorls are grouped together under the\r\ngeneral classification of \"Whorl\" and are designated by the letter\r\n\"W\".\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned subdivisions are as follows: The Plain Whorl, The\r\nCentral Pocket Loop, The Double Loop, and The Accidental.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The plain whorl_\r\n\r\nThe \"plain whorl\" consists of the simplest form of whorl construction\r\nand is the most common of the whorl subdivisions. It is designated by\r\nthe symbol \"W\" for both general classification and extension purposes.\r\n\r\n_The plain whorl has two deltas and at least one ridge making a\r\ncomplete circuit, which may be spiral, oval, circular, or any variant\r\nof a circle. An imaginary line drawn between the two deltas must touch\r\nor cross at least one of the recurving ridges within the inner pattern\r\narea. A recurving ridge, however, which has an appendage connected\r\nwith it in the line of flow cannot be construed as a circuit. An\r\nappendage connected at that point is considered to spoil the recurve\r\non that side._\r\n\r\nFigures 194 to 211 are typical examples of the plain whorl type.\r\nFigure 212 is, however, a loop, as the circuit is spoiled on one side\r\nby an appendage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 194]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 195]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 196]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 197]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 198]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 199]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 200]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 201]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 202]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 203]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 204]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 205]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 206]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 207]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 208]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 209]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 210]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 211]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 212]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Central pocket loop_\r\n\r\nWithin the whorl group, the subclassification type \"central pocket\r\nloop\" is used for extension purposes only. In general classification\r\nit is designated by the letter \"W\". Figures 213 to 236 are central\r\npocket loops.\r\n\r\n_The central pocket loop type of whorl has two deltas and at least one\r\nridge making a complete circuit, which may be spiral, oval, circular,\r\nor any variant of a circle. An imaginary line drawn between the two\r\ndeltas must not touch or cross any of the recurving ridges within the\r\ninner pattern area. A recurving ridge, however, which has an appendage\r\nconnected with it in the line of flow and on the delta side cannot be\r\nconstrued as a circuit. An appendage connected at that point is\r\nconsidered to spoil the recurve on that side._\r\n\r\n_In lieu of a recurve in front of the delta in the inner pattern area,\r\nan obstruction at right angles to the line of flow will suffice._\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the inner line of flow be fixed artificially.\r\n_The inner line of flow is determined by drawing an imaginary line\r\nbetween the inner delta and the center of the innermost recurve or\r\nlooping ridge._\r\n\r\nIn the central pocket loop, one or more of the simple recurves of the\r\nplain loop type usually recurve a second time to form a pocket within\r\nthe loop. The second recurve, however, need not be a continuation\r\nof--or even connected with--the first. It may be an independent ridge.\r\n\r\nIf no second recurve is present, an obstruction at right angles to the\r\ninner line of flow is acceptable in lieu of it. An obstruction may be\r\neither curved or straight. A dot, of course, may not be considered an\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\n_The definition does not require a recurve to cross the line of flow\r\nat right angles. The angle test needs to be applied to obstructions\r\nonly._\r\n\r\nThe recurve or obstruction of the central pocket loop, as that of the\r\nplain whorl, must be free of any appendage connected to it at the\r\npoint crossed by the line of flow and on the delta side. An appendage\r\nat that point is considered to spoil the recurve or obstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 213]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 214]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 215]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 216]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 217]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 218]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 219]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 220]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 221]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 222]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 223]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 224]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 225]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 226]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 227]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 228]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 229]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 230]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 231]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 232]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 233]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 234]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 235]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 236]\r\n\r\nFigures 237 and 238 are also central pocket loops despite the\r\nappendages connected to the recurves, because they are not connected\r\nat the point crossed by the line of flow.\r\n\r\nFigure 239, although possessing a recurve, is classified as a loop\r\nbecause the second delta is located on the only recurving ridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 237]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 238]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 239]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 240]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 241]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 242]\r\n\r\nFigures 240 to 244, although possessing one delta and a delta\r\nformation, are classified as loops because the obstructions do not\r\ncross the line of flow at right angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 243]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 244]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 245]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 246]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 247]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 248]\r\n\r\nFigures 245 to 254 have two deltas and one or more recurves, but they\r\nare classified as loops because each recurve is spoiled by an\r\nappendage connected to it at the point crossed by the line of flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 249]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 250]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 251]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 252]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 253]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 254]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Double loop_\r\n\r\nWithin the whorl group, the subclassification type \"double loop\" is\r\nused for extension purposes only. In general classification it is\r\ndesignated by the letter \"W\".\r\n\r\n_The double loop consists of two separate loop formations, with two\r\nseparate and distinct sets of shoulders, and two deltas._\r\n\r\nThe word \"separate,\" as used here, does not mean unconnected. The two\r\nloops may be connected by an appending ridge provided that it does not\r\nabut at right angles between the shoulders of the loop formation. The\r\nappendage rule for the loop applies also to the double loop. An\r\nappendage abutting upon a loop at right angles between the shoulders\r\nis considered to spoil the loop, while an appendage which flows off\r\nsmoothly is considered to leave the recurve intact.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there must be two separate loop formations eliminates\r\nfrom consideration as a double loop the \"S\" type core, the\r\ninterlocking type core, and the formation with one loop inside\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe loops of a double loop do not have to conform to the requirements\r\nof the loop. In other words, no ridge count is necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential that both sides of a loop be of equal length, nor\r\nthat the two loops be of the same size. Neither is it material from\r\nwhich side the loops enter.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between twinned loops and lateral pocket loops made by\r\nHenry and adopted by other authors has been abandoned by the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation because of the difficulty in locating and\r\ntracing the loops. Both types have been consolidated under the\r\nclassification \"double loop.\"\r\n\r\nFigures 255 to 266 are double loops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 255]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 256]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 257]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 258]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 259]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 260]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 261]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 262]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 263]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 264]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 265]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 266]\r\n\r\nFigure 267 is a plain whorl. It is not classified as a double loop as\r\none side of one loop forms the side of the other. Figure 268 is a\r\nplain loop. It is not a double loop because all of the recurves of the\r\nloop on the right are spoiled by appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 267]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 268]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Accidental_\r\n\r\nWithin the whorl group the subdivision type \"accidental\" is used for\r\nextension purposes only. In general classification it is designated by\r\nthe letter \"W\" and for extension purposes by the letter \"X\".\r\n\r\n_The accidental whorl is a pattern consisting of a combination of two\r\ndifferent types of pattern, with the exception of the plain arch, with\r\ntwo or more deltas; or a pattern which possesses some of the\r\nrequirements for two or more different types; or a pattern which\r\nconforms to none of the definitions._ It may be a combination of loop\r\nand tented arch, loop and whorl, loop and central pocket loop, double\r\nloop and central pocket loop, or other such combinations. The plain\r\narch is excluded as it is rather the absence of pattern than a\r\npattern. Underneath every pattern there are ridges running from one\r\nside to the other, so that if it were not excluded every pattern but\r\nthe plain arch would be an accidental whorl.\r\n\r\nThis subclassification also includes those exceedingly unusual\r\npatterns which may not be placed by definition into any other classes.\r\n\r\nFigures 269 to 271 are accidentals combining a loop with a tented\r\narch. Figures 272 to 276 combine a loop and a plain whorl or central\r\npocket loop. Figure 277 combines a loop and a double loop. Figure 278\r\ncombines a loop and a plain arch, so it is classified as a loop.\r\nFigure 279 combines a loop and a tented arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 269]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 270]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 271]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 272]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 273]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 274]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 275]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 276]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 277]\r\n\r\nSome whorls may be found which contain ridges conforming to more than\r\none of the whorl subdivisions described. In such cases, the order of\r\npreference (if any practical distinction need be made) should be: (1)\r\naccidental, (2) double loop, (3) central pocket loop, (4) plain whorl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 278]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 279]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 280]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 281]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whorl tracing_\r\n\r\nThe technique of whorl tracing depends upon the establishment of the\r\nfocal points--the deltas. Every whorl has two or more. When the deltas\r\nhave been located, the ridge emanating from the lower side or point of\r\nthe extreme left delta is traced until the point nearest or opposite\r\nthe extreme right delta is reached. The number of ridges intervening\r\nbetween the tracing ridge and the right delta are then counted. If the\r\nridge traced passes inside of (above) the right delta, and three or\r\nmore ridges intervene between the tracing ridge and the delta, the\r\ntracing is designated as an \"inner\"--I (fig. 280). If the ridge traced\r\npasses outside (below) the right delta, and three or more ridges\r\nintervene between the tracing ridge and the right delta, the tracing\r\nis designated as an \"outer\"--O (fig. 281). All other tracings are\r\ndesignated as \"meeting\"--M (figs. 282 to 287).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 282]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 283]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 284]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 285]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 286]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 287]\r\n\r\nTracing begins from the left delta. In no instance is a tracing to\r\nbegin on a type line. In figure 288, tracing begins at the short ridge\r\nwhich is the left delta. It is true that inasmuch as the short ridge\r\nends immediately the type line is next followed, but this is only\r\nbecause the type line is the next lower ridge. Its status as a type\r\nline is independent and has no bearing on the fact that it is being\r\ntraced. This point is illustrated further in figure 289. This pattern\r\nshows an inner tracing. It will be noted that the delta is at the\r\npoint on the first recurve nearest to the center of the divergence of\r\nthe type lines. It will be further noted that tracing begins at the\r\npoint of delta on the left and continues toward the right, passing\r\ninside of the right delta, with three ridges intervening between the\r\ntracing ridge and the right delta. This shows the tracing to be an\r\ninner tracing. If, in this case, the type line were traced (which\r\nwould be the incorrect procedure), only two ridges would intervene\r\nbetween the tracing ridge and the right delta, resulting in an\r\nerroneous meeting tracing. Figure 290 is another example of the\r\napplication of this rule. This illustration is also an inner whorl.\r\n\r\nWhen the ridge traced ends abruptly, and it is determined that the\r\nridge definitely ends, the tracing drops down to the point on the next\r\nlower ridge immediately beneath the point where the ridge above ends,\r\ncontinuing from there. Figure 291, therefore, is an outer whorl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 288]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 289]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should be noted that the rule for dropping to\r\nthe next lower line applies only when the ridge _definitely_ ends.\r\nShort breaks in a ridge which may be due to improper inking, the\r\npresence of foreign matter on the ridges, enlarged pores, disease, or\r\nworn ridges should not be considered as definite ridge endings. The\r\ndetermination of what constitutes a definite ending will depend, of\r\ncourse, upon the good judgment of the classifier. When the question\r\narises as to whether a break encountered in the ridge tracing is a\r\ndefinite ending, or whether there has been interference with a natural\r\nimpression, the whole pattern should be examined to ascertain whether\r\nsuch breaks are general throughout the pattern. If they are found to\r\nbe common, consideration should then be given to the possibility that\r\nthe break is not a definite ridge ending. Appropriate reference\r\ntracing should be done in all such cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 290]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 291]\r\n\r\nWhenever the ridge traced bifurcates, the rule for tracing requires\r\nthat the lower limb or branch proceeding from the bifurcation be\r\nfollowed. This is illustrated in 292.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 292]\r\n\r\nAccidentals often possess three or more deltas. In tracing them only\r\nthe extreme deltas are considered, the tracing beginning at the\r\nextreme left delta and proceeding toward the extreme right delta, as\r\nillustrated in figure 293.\r\n\r\nIn a double loop or accidental the problem of where to stop tracing is\r\nsometimes presented. The rule is, _when the tracing passes inside of\r\nthe right delta, stop at the nearest point to the right delta on the\r\nupward trend_, as in figure 294. If no upward trend is present,\r\ncontinue tracing until a point opposite the right delta, or the delta\r\nitself, is reached (figs. 295 and 296).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 293]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 294]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 295]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 296]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Questionable Patterns_\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how definite fingerprint rules and pattern definitions are\r\nmade, there will always be patterns concerning which there is doubt as\r\nto the classification they should be given. The primary reason for\r\nthis is the fact that probably no two fingerprints will ever appear\r\nwhich are exactly alike. Other reasons are differences in the degree\r\nof judgment and interpretation of the individual classifying\r\nfingerprints, the difference in the amount of pressure used by the\r\nperson taking the prints, and the amount or kind of ink used. Nothing\r\ncan be done about faulty inking or pressure once the prints are taken.\r\nThe patterns which are questionable merely because they seem to have\r\ncharacteristics of two or more types can be classified by strict\r\nadherence to the definitions in deducing a preference. The following\r\nsection is devoted to such patterns with an explanation of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 297]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 298]\r\n\r\nFigure 297 has two loop formations. The one on the left, however, has\r\nan appendage abutting upon the shoulders of its recurve at a right\r\nangle. The left portion of the impression, therefore, is of the tented\r\narch type. The combination of two different types of patterns would be\r\nclassified in the whorl group (accidental), but this impression has\r\nonly the one delta. The right portion of the pattern detail contains a\r\ntrue loop which fulfills all the loop requirements, i.e., a sufficient\r\nrecurve, a delta, and a ridge count across a looping ridge. In the\r\nchoice existing between a tented arch and a loop, preference is given\r\nto the loop classification and this impression would be classified as\r\na loop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 299]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 300]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 301]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 302]\r\n\r\nFigure 298, at a glance, seems to fulfill the requirements of a whorl\r\n(two deltas and a ridge making a complete circuit). The part of the\r\ncircuit in front of the right delta, however, cannot be construed as a\r\nrecurving ridge because of the appendage abutting upon it in the line\r\nof flow. This pattern, therefore, is a one-count loop.\r\n\r\nFigure 299 is a very difficult and unusual pattern. It has\r\ncharacteristics of three types, the whorl, the loop, and the tented\r\narch. It is given the preference of an accidental type of whorl (loop\r\nover a tented arch). This pattern should be referenced both as a loop\r\nand as a tented arch.\r\n\r\nFigure 300 is shown for the purpose of explaining that in the whorl,\r\nas this print is, appendages at the top of the recurve will not spoil\r\nor affect the recurve. Hence, the impression is a good whorl of the\r\ncentral pocket loop type and needs no reference.\r\n\r\nFigure 301 is classified as a whorl of the double loop type. There are\r\npresent two distinct loops and two deltas (the right delta is not\r\npresent as the impression was not rolled sufficiently). The pattern is\r\nunusual because the loops are side by side and flowing in the same\r\ndirection. The tracing is an inner tracing.\r\n\r\nFigure 302 should present no difficulty. It is classified as a plain\r\narch for its ridge construction follows the rule of a plain arch,\r\ni.e., \"enter one side and flow or tend to flow to the other.\"\r\n\r\nFigure 303 is a plain arch. The dot at the center is not elongated\r\nenough to be considered an upthrust. A dot, even though as thick and\r\nheavy as the surrounding ridges, is not considered for any purpose but\r\nridge counting or fixing a delta.\r\n\r\nFigure 304 is a pattern somewhat similar to the previous illustration.\r\nAs indicated before, dots are considered as ridges only in ridge\r\ncounting and fixing a delta. This pattern, therefore, must be\r\nclassified as a plain arch, rather than a tented arch with two ending\r\nridges and a delta formation.\r\n\r\nFigure 305, although showing an appendage upon each recurve on the\r\nleft side, is classified as a whorl of the central pocket loop type,\r\nwith two deltas and a recurve in front of each. To spoil the recurve\r\nof a whorl the appendage must be connected to the recurve at the point\r\nof contact with the line of flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 303]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 304]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 305]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 306]\r\n\r\nIn figure 306, the impression has two equally good loop formations. As\r\nit has but one delta, it cannot be classified as a whorl of the double\r\nloop type nor as a loop since it would be difficult to make a\r\npreferential choice between the two looping ridges. It is arbitrarily\r\ngiven the classification of a tented arch.\r\n\r\nIn figure 307, the difficulty lies in locating the delta. The only\r\nridges answering the definition of type lines (ridges running parallel\r\nand then diverging to enclose the pattern area) have three ending\r\nridges between them. The type lines, the delta, and the core are\r\nlocated as indicated. The pattern is classified as a six-count loop.\r\n\r\nFigure 308 is classified as a tented arch, although it appears at\r\nfirst glance to be a loop. Closer inspection shows that the looping\r\nridge does not tend to go out the side from which it entered but\r\nrather seems to proceed downward ending in an abutment forming a\r\ndefinite angle of 90°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 307]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 308]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 309]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 310]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 311]\r\n\r\nIn figure 309, an impression is shown which at first appears to be a\r\nloop. Closer inspection will show that one of the elements of the loop\r\ntype is missing, namely, a ridge count across a looping ridge; for it\r\nis to be borne in mind that the recurve of the innermost loop should\r\nbe free of appendages abutting between the shoulders at right angles.\r\nThe core, in this illustration, therefore, is placed where the\r\nappendage of the innermost loop touches the next ridge which is a good\r\nrecurve. If an imaginary line is placed between delta and core, it\r\nwill be seen that there are no intervening ridges; hence, there is no\r\nridge count.\r\n\r\nFigure 310 is a pattern which contains two elements of a loop but\r\nlacks the third. It is classified as a tented arch. Thus an impression\r\nhaving a delta and a recurve, but not having a ridge count across a\r\nlooping ridge, falls into this classification.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that although this pattern has the resemblance of a\r\nplain arch, the center of the impression actually contains a partially\r\nformed loop. A recurving ridge enters from the right side and exits in\r\nthe same direction. A delta also appears just below the recurve. In\r\nattempting to obtain a ridge count, it is seen that the imaginary\r\nline drawn between the delta and the core runs directly along the\r\nridge emanating from the former and which is joined onto the side of\r\nthe recurving ridge. For this reason, no ridge count is possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 312]\r\n\r\nFigure 311 is a tented arch. There are three loop formations, each one\r\nof which is spoiled by an appendage abutting upon its recurve between\r\nthe shoulders at a right angle. It cannot be classified as an\r\naccidental as the patterns are all of the same type, i.e., tented\r\narches. An accidental type of whorl is a combination of two or more\r\n_different_ types of patterns exclusive of the plain arch.\r\n\r\nFigure 312 is a loop. It cannot be classified as a whorl of the double\r\nloop type because the formation above the lower loop is too pointed\r\nand it also has an appendage abutting upon it at a right angle.\r\n\r\nFigure 313 at first glance appears to be a whorl of the double loop\r\ntype. Upon closer inspection, however, it will be noticed that there\r\nare no delta formations other than on the recurves. There are, then,\r\ntwo tented arch formations. As two patterns of the same type cannot\r\nform an accidental whorl, the impression must be classified as a\r\ntented arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 313]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 314]\r\n\r\nFigure 314 is an accidental whorl, combining a loop and a tented arch.\r\nThe tented arch is directly beneath the innermost loop, and is of the\r\nupthrust type.\r\n\r\nFigure 315 consists of a loop over a dot with an apparent second\r\ndelta. This pattern must be classified as a loop, as a dot may not be\r\nconsidered an upthrust unless elongated vertically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 315]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 316]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 317]\r\n\r\nEven though a dot may be as thick and heavy as the surrounding ridges,\r\nit may be considered only in ridge counting or fixing a delta.\r\n\r\nFigure 316 at first glance appears to be an accidental whorl, but on\r\ncloser inspection it proves to be a loop. Although there are three\r\ndelta formations present, it should be observed that recurving ridges\r\nappear in front of only one (D-1).\r\n\r\nFigure 317 has the general appearance of a loop. The looping ridge A,\r\nat the center, has an appendage B abutting upon its recurve. The\r\nabutment is at right angles and therefore spoils the recurve. The\r\npattern is a tented arch.\r\n\r\nFigure 318 is a tented arch which approaches both the loop and the\r\nwhorl type patterns. It cannot be considered a whorl, however, as the\r\nrecurve on the left is spoiled by an appendage (figs. 58 and 59). Nor\r\ncan it be a loop because there is no ridge count across a looping\r\nridge. The pattern, then, is a tented arch of the type possessing two\r\nof the basic characteristics of the loop and lacking the third. The\r\ndelta and the sufficient recurve are present but the ridge count is\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nFigure 319 seems at first glance to be a double loop. It will be\r\nnoted, however, that the inner delta formation would be located upon\r\nthe only looping ridge of the upper loop formation. Since the delta\r\nwould be located on the only recurve, this recurving ridge is\r\neliminated from consideration. The pattern is classified as a loop.\r\n\r\nFigure 320 is a loop of two counts, with the delta at B. There is a\r\nridge making a complete circuit present, but point A cannot be used as\r\na delta because it answers the definition of a type line. It should be\r\nconsidered a delta only if it presented an angular formation. Placing\r\nthe delta upon the recurve would spoil that recurve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 318]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 319]\r\n\r\nFigure 321 shows two separate looping ridge formations appearing side\r\nby side and upon the same side of the delta. The core in such case is\r\nplaced upon the nearer shoulder of the farther looping ridge from the\r\ndelta, the two looping ridges being considered as one loop with two\r\nrods rising as high as the shoulder. The ridge count would be four\r\n(fig. 49).\r\n\r\nFigure 322 is an accidental whorl. It is classified thus because it\r\ncontains elements of three different patterns, the loop, the double\r\nloop, and the accidental. In such case the order of preference\r\ngoverns. The delta at the left is point A. The delta at the right is\r\npoint C. This point becomes the delta since it is the point nearest\r\nthe center of the divergence of the type lines. Point B is eliminated\r\nfrom consideration as a delta since type lines may not proceed from a\r\nbifurcation unless they flow parallel after the bifurcation and before\r\ndiverging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 320]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 321]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 322]\r\n\r\nFigure 323 is a loop. There are two delta formations but the dots\r\ncannot be considered as obstructions crossing the line of flow at\r\nright angles. This precludes the classification of the central pocket\r\nloop type of whorl.\r\n\r\nFigure 324 is a loop, the two recurving ridges have appendages and are\r\nconsidered spoiled. The pattern cannot, therefore, be a whorl even\r\nthough two delta formations are present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 323]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 324]\r\n\r\nFigure 325 is classified as a tented arch. If examined closely the\r\npattern will be seen to have an appendage abutting at a right angle\r\nbetween the shoulders of each possible recurve. Thus no sufficient\r\nrecurve is present.\r\n\r\nFigure 326 is a plain arch. There is present no angle which approaches\r\na right angle. Points A, B, and X are merely bifurcations rather than\r\nan abutment of two ridges at an angle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 325]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 326]\r\n\r\nFigure 327 is a tented arch, not because of the dot, however, as it\r\ncannot be considered an upthrust. The tented arch is formed by the\r\nangle made when the curving ridge above the dot abuts upon the ridge\r\nimmediately under and to the left of the dot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 327]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 328]\r\n\r\nFigure 328 consists of two separate looping ridge formations in\r\njuxtaposition upon the same side of a common delta. This pattern\r\ncannot be called a double loop as there is no second delta formation.\r\nIn order to locate the core, the two looping ridges should be treated\r\nas one loop with two rods in the center. The core is thus placed on\r\nthe far rod (actually on the left shoulder of the far loop), resulting\r\nin a ridge count of four (fig. 49).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 329]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 330]\r\n\r\nFigure 329 is a loop of three counts. It cannot be classified as a\r\nwhorl as the only recurve is spoiled by the appendage abutting upon it\r\nat the point of contact with the line of flow.\r\n\r\nFigure 330 is a plain arch as there is no upthrust (an upthrust must\r\nbe an ending ridge), no backward looping turn, and no two ridges\r\nabutting upon each other at a sufficient angle.\r\n\r\nFigure 331 is a plain arch. The ending ridge at the center does not\r\nrise at a sufficient angle to be considered an upthrust, and it does\r\nnot quite meet the ridge toward which it is flowing and therefore\r\nforms no angle.\r\n\r\nFigure 332 is a plain arch. There are two ending ridges, but no\r\nseparate delta formation is present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 331]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 332]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 333]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 334]\r\n\r\nFigure 333 is a plain arch. The rising ridge at the center is curved\r\nat the top forming no angle, and does not constitute an upthrust\r\nbecause it is not an ending ridge.\r\n\r\nFigure 334 is a whorl of the double loop type. Two loops and two\r\ndeltas are present. It is unusual because the loops are juxtaposed\r\ninstead of one flowing over the other, and one delta is almost\r\ndirectly over the other. The tracing is a meeting tracing.\r\n\r\nFigure 335 is a tented arch. Although there is a looping ridge, no\r\nridge count can be obtained. The core is placed upon the end of the\r\nridge abutting upon the inside of the loop, and so the imaginary line\r\ncrosses no looping ridge, which is necessary.\r\n\r\nFigure 336 is a plain arch. The ending ridge at the center cannot be\r\nconsidered an upthrust because it does not deviate from the general\r\ndirection of flow of the ridges on either side. No angle is present as\r\nthe ending ridge does not abut upon the curving ridge which envelopes\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 335]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 336]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 337]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 338]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 339]\r\n\r\nFigure 337 is a plain arch because the dot cannot be considered a\r\ndelta as it is not as thick and heavy as the surrounding ridges.\r\n\r\nFigure 338 is a tented arch consisting of two ending ridges and a\r\ndelta. The short ending ridge is considered a ridge because it is\r\nslightly elongated and not a mere dot.\r\n\r\nIn figure 339, the only question involved is where to stop tracing.\r\nThe rule is: _when tracing on a ridge with an upward trend, stop at\r\nthe point on the upward trend which is nearest to the right delta_. X\r\nis the point in this pattern.\r\n\r\nIn figure 340, the question involved is also one of tracing. In this\r\npattern, the tracing is not on a ridge with an upward trend. The\r\ntracing, therefore, is continued until a point nearest to the right\r\ndelta, or the right delta itself, is reached. This tracing is a\r\nmeeting tracing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 340]\r\n\r\nThere are a few constantly recurring patterns which, though not\r\nquestionable or doubtful as they appear, present a peculiarly\r\ndifficult problem in classifying. The patterns referred to are usually\r\ndouble loops, though accidental whorls and loops sometimes present the\r\nsame problems. The difficulty arises when a loop is so elongated that\r\nthe recurve does not appear until near the edge of a fully rolled\r\nimpression or an impression that is rolled unusually far, as in\r\nfigures 341 to 344.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 341]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 342]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 343]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 344]\r\n\r\nFigure 341, if classified as it appears, would be an accidental whorl.\r\nFigures 342 and 343 would be double loops, and illustration 344, a\r\nloop. It will be observed that these prints are rolled more fully than\r\nnormal. If, however, the next time the prints are taken, they are not\r\nrolled quite so far, the patterns would require a very different\r\nclassification, and would show no indication of any need for\r\nreferencing to their true classification. The result would be a\r\nfailure to establish an identification with the original prints. The\r\nonly way in which such an error may be avoided is to classify such\r\nimpressions as they would appear if not so fully rolled, and to\r\nconduct a reference search in the classification which would be given\r\nto the prints when rolled to the fullest extent. Applying this rule,\r\nillustration 341 is a tented arch, referenced to a whorl. Figures 342\r\nand 343 are loops, referenced to whorls. Figure 344 is a plain arch,\r\nreferenced to a loop.\r\n\r\nNo set rule can possibly be devised to enable a classifier to know\r\nwith certainty where to draw the line when it is doubtful which\r\nclassification should be given such a print. Individual judgment is\r\nthe only standard. The test is: _if the pattern, in the opinion of the\r\nclassifier, is rolled to only a normal width, it should be classified\r\nas it appears. If it seems to be rolled to a width beyond the normal\r\ndegree, it should be classified as if rolled only to the normal\r\ndegree_. Age, weight, size of fingers (as seen in the plain\r\nimpressions), heaviness of the ridges, and experience of the\r\ntechnician in taking fingerprints are all factors in arriving at the\r\ncorrect conclusion. The necessity for exercising the utmost care in\r\ndealing with this type of pattern cannot be too highly emphasized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 345]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 346]\r\n\r\nThe patterns in figures 345 and 346 also have a second loop near the\r\nedge of the impression. In these two patterns, however, the second\r\nloop is very near the delta and consequently will almost invariably\r\nappear even though not rolled to the fullest extent. The foregoing\r\nrule is not applied to this type of impression. Both are classified as\r\na whorl and referenced to a loop to take care of the rare contingency\r\nof nonappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_The Classification Formula and Extensions_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The classification formula_\r\n\r\nAt this point it is necessary to mention that when prints are\r\nclassified, markings are indicated at the bottom of each finger block\r\nto reflect the type. The following symbols are used:\r\n\r\n     - Under the index fingers the appropriate capital letters\r\n     should be placed for every pattern except the ulnar loop.\r\n\r\n     - Under all other fingers, the appropriate small letter\r\n     should be placed for every pattern except the ulnar loop and\r\n     the whorl as follows:\r\n\r\n          Arch              a\r\n          Tented Arch       t\r\n          Radial Loop       r\r\n\r\n     - Ulnar loops in any finger are designated by a diagonal\r\n     line slanting in the direction of the loop.\r\n\r\n     - Whorls in any finger are designated by the letter \"W\".

The D indicates that the values of these fingers\r\nrelate to the denominator, the N that they relate to the numerator.\r\nThe summation of the numerical values of the whorl type patterns, if\r\nany, appearing in fingers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, plus one, is the denominator\r\nof the primary. The summation of the values of the whorls, if any, in\r\nfingers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, plus one, is the numerator of the primary.\r\nWhere no whorl appears in a set of impressions, the primary,\r\ntherefore, would be 1 over 1. The 1 that is assigned to the numerator\r\nand the denominator when no whorls appear is also added, for\r\nconsistency, to the value of the whorls when they do appear. It will\r\nbe understood why it was originally assigned to the no-whorl group\r\nwhen it is considered how easily a zero might be confused with an O,\r\nwhich is the symbol used for an outer whorl tracing.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the primary for the prints in figure 347, the number of\r\nwhorls appearing in the odd fingers is ascertained to be 2. Their\r\npositions are noted (1 in No. 1 and 1 in No. 7) and the values\r\nassigned to whorls appearing in those fingers are added together (16\r\nplus 2 = 18). To this sum the arbitrary 1 is added, giving us the\r\ntotal of 19, which constitutes the denominator for this set of prints.\r\nTo get the numerator, it is ascertained that there are 3 whorls\r\nappearing in the even fingers (2, 4 and 6), the values of which are\r\nadded together (16 plus 8 plus 4 = 28). To this sum the 1 is added,\r\ngiving a numerator of 29, and a complete primary of 29 over 19.\r\n\r\nBy the word \"whorl\" is meant all types of whorls, including plain\r\nwhorls, central pocket loops, double loops and accidentals. The\r\ntracing of the whorl does not enter into the determination of the\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\nThe method of obtaining the primary can probably be shown best by\r\nillustrations. For example, assume that there is a whorl in the right\r\nindex finger only. The value of a whorl in this finger is 16. When 1\r\nover 1 is added the resulting primary is 17 over 1. If a whorl appears\r\nin the right thumb and right index finger, the value is 16 over 16\r\nplus 1 over 1 giving a primary of 17 over 17. If whorls appear in both\r\nindex fingers, the value is 16 over 2 plus 1 over 1 giving a primary\r\nof 17 over 3. When whorls appear in both thumbs and both index\r\nfingers, the primary is 21 over 19 and is obtained by the addition 16\r\nplus 4 plus 1 over 16 plus 2 plus 1. If whorls appear in all 10\r\nfingers, the primary is 32 over 32 (16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1\r\nplus 1 over 16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1). It will be noted\r\nthat the primary classifications extend from 1 over 1 in the no-whorl\r\ngroup to 32 over 32 in the all-whorl group, providing 1,024 possible\r\ncombinations. This does not mean that there are 1,024 even\r\nsubdivisions of prints according to these primaries. Just as there is\r\na preponderance of loops when the types of patterns are considered,\r\nthere is also a preponderance of certain primaries, notably: the 1\r\nover 1 primary, or no-whorl group; the 17 denominator; the 19\r\ndenominator; the 28 denominator, of which the 31 over 28 group is the\r\nlargest; and the 32 denominator, including 2 large primary groups\r\nnamely, 31 over 32 and 32 over 32. As a matter of fact, the 1 over 1\r\ngroup, as a whole, contains over 25 percent of the total number of\r\nprints filed in the FBI. On the other hand, there are a number of\r\nprimaries which rarely appear. It follows, therefore, that when a\r\nprint is classified in one of these larger groups it is necessary to\r\ncomplete the classification to a greater extent than is necessary in\r\nthe more unusual primaries, so that the group to be searched is small\r\nenough for convenience.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the counting of whorl values to obtain the primary,\r\nit might be noted that when the whorls outnumber the other patterns\r\nmore speed can be achieved by counting those patterns and subtracting\r\nrather than by adding the whorls. This procedure should not be\r\nfollowed until enough experience is acquired so that it may be noted\r\nat a glance where whorls are not present.\r\n\r\nThe experienced classifier can tell in what fingers whorls are present\r\nby a glance at a primary classification. For example, a primary of 5\r\nover 17 could mean that there are whorls in the thumbs only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 348]\r\n\r\n       LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK|                                  |SEX\r\n+--------------+             |                                  |__________\r\n|FBI No.       |             |                                  |RACE\r\n+--------------+             |LAST NAME  FIRST NAME  MIDDLE NAME|\r\n-----------------------------|----------------------------------+----------\r\nSIGNATURE OF PERSON          |CONTRIBUTOR      |ALIASES         |HT.  |WT.\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |AND ADDRESS      |                |(IN.)|\r\n                             |                 |                |_____|____\r\n                             |                 |                |DATE OF\r\n-----------------------------|                 |                |BIRTH\r\nRESIDENCE OF PERSON          |                 |                |__________\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |                 |                |HAIR |EYES\r\n                             |                 |                |     |\r\n-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------\r\nOCCUPATION                   |ARREST NUMBER|LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK\r\n                             |             |\r\n-----------------------------|-------------|\r\nSCARS AND MARKS              |PLACE OF     |\r\n                             |BIRTH        |               9 R\r\n                             |-------------|CLASS__________________________\r\n-----------------------------|CITIZENSHIP  |               2 R\r\nSIGNATURE OF OFFICIAL |DATE  | _           |\r\nTAKING FINGERPRINTS   |      ||_|CHECK IF  |\r\n                      |      |  NO CRIMINAL|REF.___________________________\r\n                      |      |  RECORD IS  |\r\n                      |      |  DESIRED    |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

Before going into detail, it should be noted that\r\nafter the primary is obtained the entire remaining portion of the\r\nclassification formula is based upon the arrangement of the\r\nimpressions appearing in the right hand as the numerator over the\r\nimpressions appearing in the left hand as the denominator. The\r\narrangement of the even over the uneven fingers is discarded after the\r\nprimary is obtained. The secondary classification appears just to the\r\nright of the fractional numerals which represent the primary. It is\r\nshown in the formula by capital letters representing the basic types\r\nof patterns appearing in the index fingers of each hand, that of the\r\nright hand being the numerator and that of the left hand being the\r\ndenominator (fig. 348). There are five basic types of patterns which\r\ncan appear.\r\n\r\n     1. Arch             A\r\n     2. Tented Arch      T\r\n     3. Radial Loop      R\r\n     4. Ulnar Loop       U\r\n     5.

Such \"small letters,\" with the exception of those\r\nappearing in the index fingers, are brought up into the classification\r\nformula in their proper relative positions immediately adjacent to the\r\nindex fingers (fig. 349). A dash is used to indicate the absence of\r\neach small letter between the index fingers and another small letter\r\nor between two small letters, as\r\n\r\n1 aUa-t     1 aU-t.\r\n------- and ------\r\n1  R-a      1  U-a\r\n\r\nThus, if a radial loop appears in the right thumb, the small letter\r\n\"r\" would be brought up in the numerator column of the classification\r\nformula and placed just to the left of the capital letter representing\r\nthe index finger. Similarly, if an arch or tented arch or a radial\r\nloop would appear in the middle, ring, or little finger of the hand,\r\nthe small letter representing such a pattern would be placed on the\r\nclassification line to the right of the secondary in the numerator\r\ncolumn if the letter is present in the right hand, and in the\r\ndenominator column if in the left hand. When two or more small letters\r\nof the same type occur immediately adjacent to each other, they are\r\nindicated thus:\r\n\r\n1 rU-2a       1 aTa-a.\r\n-------  and  -------\r\n1 tU3a        1 tA2at\r\n\r\nThe small-letter groups are of vital importance to the classification\r\nsystem, as they are of relatively infrequent occurrence, constituting\r\napproximately 7 to 10 percent of all patterns. Generally speaking,\r\nsince these patterns are of such rare occurrence, their very presence\r\noften enables the classifier to dispense with the usual subsecondary\r\nclassification and the major division which in the majority of cases\r\nare used in the larger groups.\r\n\r\nTHE SUBSECONDARY CLASSIFICATION (GROUPING OF LOOPS AND WHORLS): In\r\nclassifying prints it is necessary to subdivide the secondary groups.\r\nThis is accomplished by grouping according to the ridge counts of\r\nloops and the ridge tracings of whorls. The first of the groups filed\r\nin order, which it will be necessary to so subdivide, would ordinarily\r\nbe the\r\n\r\n1 R\r\n---\r\n1 R\r\n\r\ngroup where no small letters appear. The Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation, however, has found it necessary to extend this division\r\nto many of the small-letter groups which become cumbersome. The\r\nsubsecondary is placed on the classification line just to the right of\r\nthe secondary. Ridge counts are translated into small and large,\r\nrepresented by symbols I and O. The whorl tracings are brought up as\r\nI, M, or O denoting inner, meeting or outer ridge tracings of the\r\nwhorl types. Only six fingers may be involved in the subsecondary--numbers\r\n2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.\r\n\r\nA ridge count of 1 to 9, inclusive, in the index fingers is brought up\r\ninto the subsecondary formula as I. A count of 10 or more is brought\r\nup as O. In the middle fingers a count of from 1 to 10, inclusive, is\r\nbrought up as I, and 11 or more is O. In the ring fingers a count of\r\nfrom 1 to 13 is brought up as I, and 14 or more is O. A loop\r\nsubsecondary could appear in the classification formula as\r\n\r\nOIO.\r\n---\r\nIIO\r\n\r\nAnalyzing this example of a subsecondary, one will know that in the\r\nindex, middle, and ring fingers of the right hand there are counts of\r\nover 9, under 11, and over 13, while in the left hand there are in the\r\nindex, middle, and ring fingers, counts of under 10, under 11, over\r\n13, respectively. The subsecondary classification, therefore, relates\r\nto the groupings of the prints, and no difficulty should be\r\nexperienced in ascertaining whether the I and O arrangement in the\r\nsubsecondary relates to loops or whorls when analyzing a\r\nclassification, because this information can be obtained from the\r\nprimary classification. Figure 350 is an example illustrating the\r\nsubsecondary in addition to other divisions of the classification\r\nformula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 350]\r\n\r\n       LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK|                                  |SEX\r\n+--------------+             |                                  |__________\r\n|FBI No.       |             |                                  |RACE\r\n+--------------+             |LAST NAME  FIRST NAME  MIDDLE NAME|\r\n-----------------------------|----------------------------------+----------\r\nSIGNATURE OF PERSON          |CONTRIBUTOR      |ALIASES         |HT.  |WT.\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |AND ADDRESS      |                |(IN.)|\r\n                             |                 |                |_____|____\r\n                             |                 |                |DATE OF\r\n-----------------------------|                 |                |BIRTH\r\nRESIDENCE OF PERSON          |                 |                |__________\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |                 |                |HAIR |EYES\r\n                             |                 |                |     |\r\n-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------\r\nOCCUPATION                   |ARREST NUMBER|LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK\r\n                             |             |\r\n-----------------------------|-------------|\r\nSCARS AND MARKS              |PLACE OF     |\r\n                             |BIRTH        |         26  5 R OOO 12\r\n                             |-------------|CLASS__________________________\r\n-----------------------------|CITIZENSHIP  |            12 W MOI\r\nSIGNATURE OF OFFICIAL |DATE  | _           |\r\nTAKING FINGERPRINTS   |      ||_|CHECK IF  |\r\n                      |      |  NO CRIMINAL|REF.___________________________\r\n                      |      |  RECORD IS  |\r\n                      |      |  DESIRED    |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

Where whorls appear in the\r\nthumbs the major division reflects the whorl tracings just as the\r\nsubsecondary does. For example, a major division of I over M in the\r\nprimary 5 over 17 would reflect an inner-traced whorl over a\r\nmeeting-traced whorl in the thumbs. Where loops appear in the thumbs,\r\nhowever, a table is used to translate the ridge counts into the small,\r\nmedium, or large groups, designated by the letters S, M, L. An\r\nexpanding table is used for the right thumb when large-count loops\r\nappear in the left thumb, as shown in the chart (fig. 351). This table\r\nis used because it affords a more equitable distribution of prints as\r\na whole, for filing purposes within the groups indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 351.

This order is\r\nattained through the use of the final, which is based upon the ridge\r\ncount of the loop in the right little finger. It is indicated at the\r\nextreme right of the numerator in the classification. Note figure 352.\r\nIf a loop does not appear in the right little finger, a loop in the\r\nleft little finger may be used. It is then indicated at the extreme\r\nright of the denominator (fig. 353). If no loops appear in the little\r\nfingers, a whorl may be used to obtain a final, counting from left\r\ndelta to core if in the right hand and from right delta to core if in\r\nthe left hand. If there are two or more cores (usually applies to\r\naccidental whorls), the ridge count is made from left delta (right\r\nhand) or right delta (left hand) to the core which is the least\r\nnumber of ridges distant from that delta. An exception is made in the\r\ncase of the double loop. The double loop is counted from the delta to\r\nthe core of the upright loop. Where loops of a double loop are\r\nhorizontal, the nearest core is used. Should both little fingers be a\r\nor t, no final is used. The use of a whorl in a little finger for a\r\nfinal is required only in connection with a large group or collection\r\nof prints, such as the 32 over 32 primary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 352]\r\n\r\n       LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK|                                  |SEX\r\n+--------------+             |                                  |__________\r\n|FBI No.       |             |                                  |RACE\r\n+--------------+             |LAST NAME  FIRST NAME  MIDDLE NAME|\r\n-----------------------------|----------------------------------+----------\r\nSIGNATURE OF PERSON          |CONTRIBUTOR      |ALIASES         |HT.  |WT.\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |AND ADDRESS      |                |(IN.)|\r\n                             |                 |                |_____|____\r\n                             |                 |                |DATE OF\r\n-----------------------------|                 |                |BIRTH\r\nRESIDENCE OF PERSON          |                 |                |__________\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |                 |                |HAIR |EYES\r\n                             |                 |                |     |\r\n-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------\r\nOCCUPATION                   |ARREST NUMBER|LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK\r\n                             |             |               LLL\r\n-----------------------------|-------------|               LMM\r\nSCARS AND MARKS              |PLACE OF     |\r\n                             |BIRTH        |      24  L I R  O O O    17\r\n                             |-------------|CLASS__________________________\r\n-----------------------------|CITIZENSHIP  |          L I R  O O O\r\nSIGNATURE OF OFFICIAL |DATE  | _           |\r\nTAKING FINGERPRINTS   |      ||_|CHECK IF  |\r\n                      |      |  NO CRIMINAL|REF.___________________________\r\n                      |      |  RECORD IS  |\r\n                      |      |  DESIRED    |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

The following table is used:\r\n\r\n_Index_                  _Middle_                  _Ring_\r\n\r\n1 to 5, inclusive, S.     1 to 8, inclusive, S.     1  to 10, inclusive, S.\r\n6 to 12, inclusive, M.    9 to 14, inclusive, M.    11 to 18, inclusive, M.\r\n13 or more, L.            15 or more, L.            19 or more, L.\r\n\r\nIf this table is referred to, a study of figure 352 will demonstrate\r\nthe use of the second subsecondary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 353]\r\n\r\n       LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK|                                  |SEX\r\n+--------------+             |                                  |__________\r\n|FBI No.       |             |                                  |RACE\r\n+--------------+             |LAST NAME  FIRST NAME  MIDDLE NAME|\r\n-----------------------------|----------------------------------+----------\r\nSIGNATURE OF PERSON          |CONTRIBUTOR      |ALIASES         |HT.  |WT.\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |AND ADDRESS      |                |(IN.)|\r\n                             |                 |                |_____|____\r\n                             |                 |                |DATE OF\r\n-----------------------------|                 |                |BIRTH\r\nRESIDENCE OF PERSON          |                 |                |__________\r\nFINGERPRINTED                |                 |                |HAIR |EYES\r\n                             |                 |                |     |\r\n-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------\r\nOCCUPATION                   |ARREST NUMBER|LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK\r\n                             |             |\r\n-----------------------------|-------------|\r\nSCARS AND MARKS              |PLACE OF     |\r\n                             |BIRTH        |      22  M  11  U  OOO\r\n                             |-------------|CLASS__________________________\r\n-----------------------------|CITIZENSHIP  |          L   6  U  OMI  13\r\nSIGNATURE OF OFFICIAL |DATE  | _           |\r\nTAKING FINGERPRINTS   |      ||_|CHECK IF  |\r\n                      |      |  NO CRIMINAL|REF.___________________________\r\n                      |      |  RECORD IS  |\r\n                      |      |  DESIRED    |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

These symbols are used for subclassification\r\npurposes only and are brought up into the classification formula\r\ndirectly above the subsecondary in their respective positions, the\r\nright hand being the numerator, the left hand being the denominator.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL LOOP EXTENSION: In the all-loop group\r\n\r\n(1R-U)\r\n------\r\n(1R-U),\r\n\r\nthe following special loop extension may be used, utilizing the ridge\r\ncounts in fingers Nos. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and, if necessary, No. 10:\r\n\r\n    _Ridge Counts_          _Value_\r\n\r\n      1 to  4, inclusive       1\r\n      5 to  8, inclusive       2\r\n      9 to 12, inclusive       3\r\n     13 to 16, inclusive       4\r\n     17 to 20, inclusive       5\r\n     21 to 24, inclusive       6\r\n     25 and over               7\r\n\r\nThe resulting values in this extension are brought up into the\r\nclassification formula directly above the subsecondary in their\r\nrespective positions, the right hand being the numerator, the left\r\nhand being the denominator.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the extensions already mentioned, fingerprint groups\r\nmay be divided into male and female, and by age (either by year or by\r\narbitrarily setting an age limit, beyond which a print bearing such an\r\nage would be filed separately in a \"Reference\" or a \"Presumptive Dead\"\r\nfile).\r\n\r\nIn the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, all prints\r\nbearing an age of 55 through 74 are filed in the \"Reference\" group and\r\nall prints bearing an age of 75 years or more are filed in the\r\n\"Presumptive Dead\" file. Persons 75 years of age or older, in regard\r\nto crime, may be considered as generally inactive and thus are filed\r\nas \"Presumptive Dead.\" Such a group provides for removing from the\r\nother files the cards concerning those of whom no notice is ever\r\nreceived as to death.\r\n\r\nA separate file should be maintained for deceased persons, for\r\npossible future reference.\r\n\r\nA separate file should be maintained for all prints bearing\r\namputations and which have an unequivocal statement or marking from\r\nthe contributor to that effect.\r\n\r\nPermanent scars also may be utilized for this purpose, giving three\r\nmore groupings: those prints having permanent scars in the right hand,\r\nthose having a scar in the left, and those in which scars appear in\r\nboth hands. A separate file may be maintained for mutilated prints\r\nwhether or not the permanent-scar division is used. This is usually\r\ncomposed of prints so badly mutilated, or so mutilated about the cores\r\nand deltas, that intentional mutilation is suspected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 354]\r\n\r\n+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+\r\n|    WHORL     |   |CENTRAL POCKET|   |   DUAL LOOP  |   |  ACCIDENTAL  |\r\n|     -W-      |   |     LOOP     |   |      -D-     |   |      -X-     |\r\n|              |   |              |   |              |   |              |\r\n|[Illustration]|   |[Illustration]|   |[Illustration]|   |[Illustration]|\r\n+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+\r\nPATTERN HAVING     PATTERN HAVING     TWO SEPARATE       TWO OR MORE\r\nONE CORE.

In connection with their proper classification, the\r\nfollowing rules should be observed:\r\n\r\n     - When an impression is so scarred that neither the general\r\n     type of pattern nor the ridge tracing or count can be\r\n     determined with reasonable accuracy, the impression should\r\n     be given both the general type value and the\r\n     subclassification value of the corresponding finger of the\r\n     other hand.\r\n\r\n     - When an impression is partially scarred, i.e., large scars\r\n     about the core so that the _general type_ cannot be\r\n     determined with _reasonable accuracy_, but the ridges allow\r\n     reasonably accurate subclassifications by ridge tracings or\r\n     counting, the impression should be given the primary value\r\n     of the pattern of the corresponding finger and the\r\n     subclassification value as indicated by the ridges of\r\n     partially scarred impressions.\r\n\r\n     - When an impression is partially scarred and the general\r\n     type of pattern can be determined with reasonable accuracy,\r\n     but the ridges cannot be traced or counted so as to fall\r\n     within the proper subsecondary classification, the\r\n     impression should be given the ridge count or tracing value\r\n     of the corresponding finger of the other hand, if the\r\n     corresponding finger is of the same general type. If the\r\n     corresponding finger is not of the same general type, the\r\n     scarred impression should be given the probable value and\r\n     referenced to all other possibilities.\r\n\r\n     - When an impression is so scarred that neither the general\r\n     type of pattern nor the ridge tracing or count can be\r\n     determined with reasonable accuracy, and it so happens that\r\n     the corresponding finger of the other hand is similarly\r\n     scarred, both patterns are given the arbitrary value of\r\n     whorls with meeting tracings.\r\n\r\nIn figure 355, the pattern is entirely obliterated. It could have been\r\na small whorl, a small ulnar or radial loop, an arch, or a tented\r\narch. If the opposite finger were an arch or tented arch or whorl,\r\nthis impression would be classified as arch, tented arch, or whorl\r\n(with the same tracing). If the opposite finger were a small-count\r\nloop, this would be classified as a loop of the same count. If the\r\nopposite finger were a large-count loop, this impression would be\r\ngiven the count of the opposite finger even though it could never have\r\nhad that count. If the opposite finger were scarred in the same\r\nfashion or were amputated or missing, both impressions would be\r\nclassified as whorls with meeting tracings.\r\n\r\nIn figure 356, the general type of the pattern could have been loop\r\n(ulnar if in the right hand) or whorl. If the opposite finger were a\r\nwhorl this would be classified as a whorl, and with the same tracing.\r\nIf a radial loop were opposite, this would be classified as an ulnar\r\nloop (if in the right hand). The ridge count can be obtained with a\r\nfair degree of accuracy. If an arch or tented arch were opposite, this\r\nimpression would be classified as a loop because it looks as if it had\r\nbeen a loop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 355]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 356]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 357]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 358]\r\n\r\nIn figure 357, the ridge count cannot be determined accurately but it\r\nwould be classified as a loop, no matter what the opposite finger\r\nmight be. If the opposite finger were a loop with a count of from 6 to\r\n17, this impression would be given that count. If the count of the\r\nopposite loop were less or more than 6 to 17, the count for this\r\nfinger would be given I or O in the subsecondary classification\r\ndepending upon whether the opposite finger was I or O, but would not\r\nbe given less than 6 nor more than 17 counts as its possibility is\r\nlimited to those counts.\r\n\r\nA pattern with a scar similar to either scar in figures 358 and 359\r\nwould always be given a loop as it could be seen readily that there\r\nwas no possibility of its having been any other type of pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 359]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of amputations and fingers missing at birth_\r\n\r\nWhen one or more amputations appear upon a fingerprint card, it may be\r\nfiled separately from those having no amputations in order to\r\nfacilitate searching. It is to be noted that before it may be filed in\r\nthe amputation group, the card must contain a definite and unequivocal\r\nstatement or marking by the contributor to the effect that a certain\r\nfinger or fingers have been amputated or were missing at birth. This\r\nprevents the appearance on later cards of impressions of fingers\r\nthought to have been amputated but which in reality were merely\r\ninjured and bandaged when previous prints were submitted.\r\n\r\nIf one finger is amputated, it is given a classification identical\r\nwith that of the opposite finger, including pattern and ridge count,\r\nor tracing, and referenced to every other possible classification.\r\n\r\nIf two or more fingers are amputated, they are given classifications\r\nidentical with the fingers opposite, with no additional references.\r\n\r\nIf two amputated fingers are opposite each other, both are given the\r\nclassification of whorls with meeting tracings.\r\n\r\nWhen a fingerprint card bearing a notation of fingers missing at birth\r\nis classified, the missing fingers should be treated as amputations in\r\nthat they are given the identical classifications of the opposite\r\nfingers and are filed in the amputation group. As these fingers are\r\nmissing from a prenatal cause, they would have always received the\r\nidentical classification of the opposite finger on any previous\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIf all 10 fingers are amputated or missing at birth, the\r\nclassification will be\r\n\r\nM 32 W MMM.\r\n-----------\r\nM 32 W MMM\r\n\r\nIf both hands are amputated or missing at birth, the footprints should\r\nbe taken as they, too, bear friction ridges with definite patterns. A\r\nfootprint file is maintained by the FBI for identification purposes in\r\ninstances where the subject has all fingers amputated or missing at\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nPartially amputated fingers often present very complex problems and\r\ncareful consideration should be given to them. The question often\r\narises as to the appropriate groups in which they should be filed,\r\ni.e., amputations or nonamputations. As no definite rule may be\r\napplied, it is a matter of experience and judgment as to their\r\npreferred classification.\r\n\r\nIn those instances in which a partially amputated finger has half or\r\nmore than half of the pattern area missing, it is given the\r\nclassification of the opposite finger. It will be filed in the\r\namputation group under the classification of the opposite finger and\r\nreference searches should be conducted in all possible classifications\r\nin the nonamputation groups. If two or more of the fingers are\r\namputated in this manner, they are given the classification of the\r\nopposite fingers only and are governed by the rules concerning\r\namputations.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a \"tip amputation,\" or one which has less than half of the\r\nfirst joint amputated, will always be printed in the future.\r\nTherefore, a partially amputated finger with less than half of the\r\npattern area missing is classified as it appears and is referenced to\r\nthe opposite finger. It will be filed in the nonamputation group and\r\nreference searches should be conducted under the classification of the\r\nopposite finger, and in the amputation group. It must be referenced\r\nthis way even though it never could have originally had the\r\nclassification of the opposite finger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of bandaged or imprinted fingers_\r\n\r\nAs noted in the chapter pertaining to \"Problems in the Taking of Inked\r\nFingerprints,\" an indication to the effect \"recently injured,\r\nbandaged\" is not sufficient to file a fingerprint card. It is obvious\r\nthat a fingerprint card bearing these notations cannot be properly\r\nclassified or filed. If the injury is temporary, and if possible,\r\nthese prints should not be taken until after healing.\r\n\r\nIf fingers are injured to the extent that it is impossible to secure\r\ninked impressions by special inking devices, the unprinted fingers are\r\ngiven classifications identical with the classifications of the\r\nfingers opposite. If only one finger is lacking, reference searches\r\nshould be conducted in every possible classification. If more than one\r\nfinger is lacking, they should be given the classifications of the\r\nopposite fingers, but no reference searches should be conducted. If\r\nthere are two lacking, opposite each other, they should be classified\r\nas whorls with meeting tracings.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in the case of an injured finger, observation is made of\r\nthe ridges of the finger itself and indicated on the print, this\r\nclassification should be, insofar as it is possible, utilized. For\r\nexample, a missing impression labeled \"ulnar loop of about 8 counts\"\r\nby the individual taking the prints, should be searched in the\r\nsubsecondary as both I and O but should not be referenced as a pattern\r\nother than a loop. If the finger is used as the final, or key, it\r\nshould be searched enough counts on each side of 8 to allow for\r\npossible error in the counting by the contributor using his naked\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Filing Sequence_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sequence must be arranged properly at all times to make possible\r\nthe most accurate work. Prints are sequenced and filed in this order,\r\naccording to:\r\n\r\nI. _Primary:_\r\n\r\n1    32.\r\n- to --\r\n1    32\r\n\r\nIn the primary classification the denominator remains constant until\r\nall numerator figures have been exhausted from 1 to 32. All prints\r\nwith the primary 1 over 1 are filed together. These are followed by 2\r\nover 1, 3 over 1, 4 over 1, etc., until 32 over 1 is reached. The next\r\nprimary is 1 over 2, then 2 over 2, etc., until 32 over 2 is reached.\r\nEventually, through the use of each denominator figure and the\r\nelimination of each numerator over each denominator, the 32 over 32\r\nprimary will be reached.\r\n\r\nEven in the smaller collections of fingerprints, it will be found that\r\nthe groups which are arranged under the individual primaries filed in\r\nsequence, from 1 over 1 to 32 over 32, will be too voluminous for\r\nexpeditious searching.\r\n\r\nII. _Secondary:_\r\n\r\nA. Secondary small-letter group:\r\n\r\nA    rW3r.\r\n- to ----\r\nA    rW3r\r\n\r\nMost intricate of all the individual sequences is the small-letter\r\nsequence. It is less difficult if the following method is used:\r\n\r\n1. Sequence according to the patterns in the index fingers, grouped\r\n\r\nA    W.\r\n- to -\r\nA    W\r\n\r\nWhen small letters are present, there are 25 possible combinations\r\nwhich can appear in the index fingers. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n     A T R U W\r\n     - - - - -\r\n     A A A A A\r\n\r\n     A T R U W\r\n     - - - - -\r\n     T T T T T\r\n\r\n     A T R U W\r\n     - - - - -\r\n     R R R R R\r\n\r\n     A T U R W\r\n     - - - - -\r\n     U U U U U\r\n\r\n     A T U R W\r\n     - - - - -\r\n     W W W W W\r\n\r\n2. Within each group sequence:\r\n\r\n  a. The denominator, by--\r\n\r\n    (1) Count of the small letters (lesser preceding the greater).\r\n\r\n    (2) Position of the small letters (those to the left preceding those\r\n        to the right).\r\n\r\n    (3) Type of small letter (sequence a, t, r).\r\n\r\n  b.

For example, assume that there are 5\r\nprints in a group having a key of 14. All of these should be filed\r\ntogether and followed by those prints in the same group having a key\r\nof 15, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_Searching and Referencing_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Searching_\r\n\r\nWhen searching a print through the fingerprint files in order to\r\nestablish an identification, it should be remembered that the\r\nfingerprint cards are filed in such a way that all those prints having\r\nthe same classification are together. Thus, the print being searched\r\nis compared only with the groups having a comparable classification,\r\nrather than with the whole file.\r\n\r\nAfter locating the proper group classification, the searcher should\r\nfix in his mind the one or two most outstanding characteristics of the\r\npatterns of the current print and look for them among the prints in\r\nfile. If a print is found which has a characteristic resembling one\r\nupon the current print, the two prints should be examined closely to\r\ndetermine if identical. To avoid making an erroneous identification,\r\nthe searcher should be exceedingly careful to ascertain that the\r\nprints being compared are identical in all respects before identifying\r\none against the other.\r\n\r\nTo establish identity, it is necessary to locate several points of\r\nidentity among the characteristics of the prints. The number of\r\nidentical characteristics is left to the discretion of the individual\r\nbut he should be absolutely certain that the prints are identical\r\nbefore treating them as such. Characteristics need not appear within\r\nthe pattern area, since any ridge formation is acceptable. Quite often\r\nexcellent ridge detail appears in the second joint of the finger. The\r\ncharacteristics used to establish an identification are shown in\r\nfigure 102.\r\n\r\nThe final and the key may be considered control figures for searching\r\nprints. They limit the number of prints it is necessary to search in a\r\ngroup to those prints having finals and keys closely related to the\r\nfinal and key of the print being searched.\r\n\r\nDue to the possibility of visual misinterpretation, distortion by\r\npressure, or poor condition of the ridge detail of the prints in file,\r\nit is advisable to allow a margin for such discrepancies. Except in\r\ncases where the ridge count of the final and/or key is questionable on\r\nthe print being searched, the following procedure is used:\r\n\r\nOf the prints within any group classification, only those prints are\r\nexamined which have a final within 2 ridge counts on each side of the\r\nfinal of the print being searched. For example, if the print to be\r\nsearched has a final of 17, all prints bearing a final 15 through 19\r\nwill be compared with it.\r\n\r\nWithin the final of any group classification, only those prints are\r\nexamined which have a key within 2 ridge counts on each side of the\r\nkey of the print being searched. For example, if the print to be\r\nsearched has a key of 20, all prints bearing a key of 18 through 22\r\nwill be compared with it.\r\n\r\nIn figure 352, it will be noted that there are 17 ridge counts\r\nappearing in the right little finger and this number is used as the\r\nfinal. It will also be noted that there is a loop of 24 ridge counts\r\nin the right thumb and this number is used as the key inasmuch as it\r\nis the first loop. In this example, the print is searched in the group\r\nclassification which has finals ranging from 15 through 19. Within\r\nthis group of finals the prints which have keys ranging from 22\r\nthrough 26 are examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Referencing_\r\n\r\nToo much stress cannot be placed upon the necessity of referencing\r\nquestionable patterns, whether it be in the interpretation of the type\r\nof pattern, the ridge count, or the tracing.\r\n\r\nThe factors which make it necessary are: variation in individual\r\njudgment and eyesight, the amount of ink used, the amount of pressure\r\nused in taking the prints, the difference in width of the rolled\r\nimpressions, skin diseases, worn ridges due to age or occupations,\r\ntemporary and permanent scars, bandaged fingers, crippled hands, and\r\namputation.\r\n\r\n_For the highest degree of accuracy, all rolled impressions should be\r\nchecked by the plain impressions_, which generally are not distorted\r\nby pressure. This also helps prevent error caused by the reversal or\r\nmixing of the rolled impressions out of their proper order. For the\r\nsame reason, as much of the counting and tracing should be done in the\r\nplain impressions as it is possible to do.\r\n\r\nIf there is any doubt as to which of two or more classifications\r\nshould be assigned to a given pattern, it is given the preferred\r\nclassification and reference searches are conducted in all other\r\npossible classifications. For example, if on a print with the\r\npreferred classification\r\n\r\n1 A\r\n----\r\n1 Aa\r\n\r\nit is questionable whether the left middle finger should be a plain\r\narch, a tented arch, or a radial loop, the print is searched in the\r\n\r\n1 A\r\n----\r\n1 Aa\r\n\r\ngroup, and reference searches are conducted in the\r\n\r\n1 A\r\n----\r\n1 At\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n1 A\r\n----\r\n1 Ar\r\n\r\ngroups. For further illustration, a print is given a preferred primary\r\nclassification of\r\n\r\n1,\r\n-\r\n1\r\n\r\nalthough the ridge detail on the right thumb is so formed as to\r\nresemble a whorl. The search is completed first in the preferred\r\n\r\n1\r\n-\r\n1\r\n\r\nprimary classification and a reference search is then conducted in the\r\n\r\n1\r\n--\r\n17\r\n\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\nAll ridge counts that are \"line counts,\" i.e., when one more or one\r\nless count would change the designation of the loop from I to O or\r\nfrom S to M, etc., must be searched in both groups. For example, in a\r\nprint classified\r\n\r\n16 M 1 U III 10,\r\n---------------\r\n   M 1 U III\r\n\r\nif the ridge count of the right middle finger is 10 and the count in\r\nthe right thumb is 16 (as indicated by the key), the print would be\r\nsearched first as classified, then reference searches would be\r\nconducted in the following groups:\r\n\r\n     M 1 U IOI, L 1 U III,     L 1 U IOI\r\n     ---------  ---------  and ---------\r\n     M 1 U III  M 1 U III      M 1 U III\r\n\r\nWhen there is doubt concerning the tracing of a whorl, it should be\r\ntreated in the same fashion. For example, if in the classification\r\n\r\nO  5 U\r\n------\r\nI 17 U\r\n\r\ndoubt existed as to whether the tracing of the right thumb might not\r\nbe a meeting tracing, the print would be searched as classified, and a\r\nreference search would be conducted in\r\n\r\nM  5 U.\r\n------\r\nI 17 U\r\n\r\nIf there is no doubt concerning the ridge count used for the final, it\r\nis enough to search out of the group only those prints containing a\r\nfinal within 2 ridge counts on each side of the final on the print\r\nbeing searched. When, however, there is doubt concerning the ridge\r\ncount of the final, the print should be searched 2 ridge counts on\r\neach side of the two extremes of possibility. For example, if it were\r\npossible for a final to be 6, 7, 8, or 9 ridge counts, the print\r\nshould be searched through that part of the group bearing finals of\r\nfrom 4 through 11.\r\n\r\nThe above explanation pertaining to the final also applies to the key.\r\n\r\nAll prints bearing amputations should be referenced to the necessary\r\nfiles containing prints other than amputations for reference searches.\r\n\r\nIn instances where only one finger is amputated, reference searches\r\nare conducted in all possible classifications, including all possible\r\nridge counts or tracings. For example, a print containing the\r\nclassification:\r\n\r\n     AMP\r\n\r\n     4 S 1 U III 6\r\n     -------------\r\n       S 1 U III\r\n\r\nwith the right index finger amputated, the left index finger being an\r\nulnar loop, would be searched first in the amputation group for the\r\nclassification, then reference searches would be conducted in the\r\nfollowing groups in the nonamputation files:\r\n\r\n     S 1 U III  S 1 T  II  S 17 W III\r\n     ---------  ---------  ----------\r\n     S 1 U III  S 1 U III  S  1 U III\r\n\r\n     S 1 U OII  S 1 R III  S 17 W MII\r\n     ---------  ---------  ----------\r\n     S 1 U III  S 1 U III  S  1 U III\r\n\r\n     S 1 A  II  S 1 R OII  S 17 W OII\r\n     ---------  ---------  ----------\r\n     S 1 U III  S 1 U III  S  1 U III\r\n\r\nAll prints bearing unprinted or badly crippled fingers are filed in\r\nthe nonamputation files, and reference searches are conducted in the\r\namputation group.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of determining if it is feasible to conduct reference\r\nsearches in all possible classifications, the method of referencing\r\namputations is applied to completely scarred patterns (Chapter titled\r\n\"Scarred Patterns--Amputations--Missing at Birth\"). For example, a\r\nprint bearing the preferred classification:\r\n\r\n     13 O 17 W OOO 14\r\n     ----------------\r\n        L 17 U OOI\r\n\r\nwith the left middle finger completely scarred, the right middle\r\nfinger being an ulnar loop with a ridge count of 13, would be searched\r\nfirst in the group for that classification, then reference searches\r\nwould be conducted in the following groups:\r\n\r\n     O 17 W OOO     O 17 W         O 19 W OOO\r\n     ----------     -------        ----------\r\n     L 17 U OII     L 17 Ur        L 17 U OOI\r\n\r\n     O 17 W         O 19 W OOO\r\n     -------        ----------\r\n     L 17 Ua        L 17 U OII\r\n\r\n     O 17 W         O 19 W OOO\r\n     -------        ----------\r\n     L 17 Ut        L 17 U OMI\r\n\r\nThe referencing of partial scars is a problem in which many factors\r\nare present. A full explanation of the scars, their preferred\r\nclassifications and their references is made in the chapter,\r\n\"Classification of Scarred Patterns--Amputations--Missing at Birth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the age extension is utilized and a \"Reference\" group and a\r\n\"Presumptive Dead\" file are maintained, it is suggested that a general\r\nallowance of 5 years be considered to allow for a discrepancy in\r\nprints bearing the ages of 50 years or older.\r\n\r\nIn the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation the various age\r\ngroups are as follows:\r\n\r\n1-54            \"Regular\" file.\r\n55-74           \"Reference\" file.\r\n75 and over     \"Presumptive Dead\" file.\r\n\r\nReference searches for the preceding groups are conducted in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n50-54            Referenced to \"Reference\" file.\r\n70-74            Referenced to \"Presumptive Dead\" file and \"Regular\" file.\r\n75-79            Referenced to \"Reference\" file and \"Regular\" file.\r\n80 and older     Referenced to \"Regular\" file only.\r\n\r\nIf no age is given, it should be searched first in the regular file\r\nand reference searches should be conducted in the \"Reference\" group\r\nand the \"Presumptive Dead\" file.\r\n\r\nWhen separate male and female files are maintained, there may be doubt\r\nas to the sex of a subject due to a discrepancy between the sex\r\nindicated and the name and the description and picture. In such case\r\ntry to determine the sex from the description and the size of the\r\nprints, then reference the print to the other file. A Photostat copy\r\ncan be made and placed in the other file until the true sex can be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_How To Take Inked Fingerprints_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equipment required for taking fingerprints consists of an inking\r\nplate, a cardholder, printer's ink (heavy black paste), and a roller.\r\nThis equipment is simple and inexpensive.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain clear, distinct fingerprints, it is necessary to\r\nspread the printer's ink in a thin even coating on a small inking\r\nplate. A roller similar to that used by printers in making galley\r\nproofs is best adapted for use as a spreader. Its size is a matter\r\ndetermined by individual needs and preferences; however, a roller\r\napproximately 6 inches long and 2 inches in diameter has been found to\r\nbe very satisfactory. These rollers may be obtained from a fingerprint\r\nsupply company or a printing supply house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 360. Fingerprint stand.]\r\n\r\nAn inking plate may be made from a hard, rigid, scratch-resistant\r\nmetal plate 6 inches wide by 14 inches long or by inlaying a block of\r\nwood with a piece of glass one-fourth of an inch thick, 6 inches wide,\r\nand 14 inches long. The glass plate by itself would be suitable, but\r\nit should be fixed to a base in order to prevent breakage. The inking\r\nsurface should be elevated to a sufficient height to allow the\r\nsubject's forearm to assume a horizontal position when the fingers are\r\nbeing inked. For example, the inking plate may be placed on the edge\r\nof a counter or a table of counter height. In such a position, the\r\noperator has greater assurance of avoiding accidental strain or\r\npressure on the fingers and should be able to procure more uniform\r\nimpressions. The inking plate should also be placed so that the\r\nsubject's fingers which are not being printed can be made to \"swing\"\r\noff the table to prevent their interfering with the inking process. A\r\nfingerprint stand such as that shown in figure 360 may be purchased\r\nfrom fingerprint supply companies. The stand is made of hardwood and\r\nmeasures approximately 2 feet in length, 1 foot in height and width.\r\nThis stand contains a cardholder and a chrome strip which is used as\r\nthe inking plate. Two compartments used to store blank fingerprint\r\ncards and supplies complete the stand. This equipment should be\r\nsupplemented by a cleansing fluid and necessary cloths so that the\r\nsubject's fingers may be cleaned before rolling and the inking plate\r\ncleaned after using. Denatured alcohol and commercially available\r\ncleaning fluids are suitable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 361.

Figure 361 shows\r\nfingerprints properly taken on one of the standard personnel\r\nidentification cards from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. From\r\nthis illustration, it is evident there are two types of impressions\r\ninvolved in the process of taking fingerprints. The upper 10 prints\r\nare taken individually--thumb, index, middle, ring, and little fingers\r\nof each hand in the order named. These are called \"rolled\"\r\nimpressions, the fingers being rolled from side to side in order to\r\nobtain all available ridge detail. The smaller impressions at the\r\nbottom of the card are taken by simultaneously printing all of the\r\nfingers of each hand and then the thumb without rolling. These are\r\ncalled \"plain\" or \"fixed\" impressions and are used as a check upon the\r\nsequence and accuracy of the rolled impressions. Rolled impressions\r\nmust be taken carefully in order to insure that an accurate\r\nfingerprint classification can be obtained by examination of the\r\nvarious patterns. It is also necessary that each focal point (cores\r\nand all deltas) be clearly printed in order that accurate ridge counts\r\nand tracings may be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn preparing to take a set of fingerprints, a small daub of ink should\r\nbe placed on the inking glass or slab and thoroughly rolled until a\r\nvery thin, even film covers the entire surface. The subject should\r\nstand in front of and at forearm's length from the inking plate. In\r\ntaking the rolled impressions, the side of the bulb of the finger is\r\nplaced upon the inking plate and the finger is rolled to the other\r\nside until it faces the opposite direction. Care should be exercised\r\nso the bulb of each finger is inked evenly from the tip to below the\r\nfirst joint. By pressing the finger lightly on the card and rolling in\r\nexactly the same manner, a clear rolled impression of the finger\r\nsurface may be obtained. It is better to ink and print each finger\r\nseparately beginning with the right thumb and then, in order, the\r\nindex, middle, ring, and little fingers. (Stamp pad ink, printing ink,\r\nordinary writing ink, or other colored inks are not suitable for use\r\nin fingerprint work as they are too light or thin and do not dry\r\nquickly.)\r\n\r\nIf consideration is given the anatomical or bony structure of the\r\nforearm when taking rolled impressions, more uniform impressions will\r\nbe obtained. The two principal bones of the forearm are known as the\r\nradius and the ulna, the former being on the thumb side and the latter\r\non the little finger side of the arm. As suggested by its name, the\r\nradius bone revolves freely about the ulna as a spoke of a wheel about\r\nthe hub. In order to take advantage of the natural movement in making\r\nfinger impressions, the hand should be rotated from the awkward to the\r\neasy position. This requires that the thumbs be rolled toward and the\r\nfingers away from the center of the subject's body. This process\r\nrelieves strain and leaves the fingers relaxed upon the completion of\r\nrolling so that they may be lifted easily from the card without danger\r\nof slipping which smudges and blurs the prints. Figures 362 and 363\r\nshow the proper method of holding a finger for inking and printing a\r\nrolled impression.\r\n\r\nThe degree of pressure to be exerted in inking and taking rolled\r\nimpressions is important, and this may best be determined through\r\nexperience and observation. It is quite important, however, that the\r\nsubject be cautioned to relax and refrain from trying to help the\r\noperator by exerting pressure as this prevents the operator from\r\ngaging the amount needed. A method which is helpful in effecting the\r\nrelaxation of a subject's hand is that of instructing him to look at\r\nsome distant object and not to look at his hands. The person taking\r\nthe fingerprints should stand to the left of the subject when printing\r\nthe right hand, and to the right of the subject when printing the left\r\nhand. In any case, the positions of both subject and operator should\r\nbe natural and relaxed if the best fingerprints are to be obtained.\r\n\r\nTo obtain \"plain\" impressions, all the fingers of the right hand\r\nshould be pressed lightly upon the inking plate, then pressed\r\nsimultaneously upon the lower right hand corner of the card in the\r\nspace provided. The left hand should be similarly printed, and the\r\nthumbs of both hands should be inked and printed, without rolling, in\r\nthe space provided. Figures 364 and 365 show the correct method of\r\ntaking plain impressions of the fingers and thumbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 362. Proper method of holding finger.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 363. Proper method of printing rolled impressions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 364. Proper method of taking plain impressions of\r\nfingers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 365. Proper method of taking plain impressions of\r\nthumbs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Problems in the Taking of Inked Fingerprints_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time various problems arise concerning the taking of\r\ninked impressions. It is believed that these problems can be divided\r\ninto four phases:\r\n\r\n     - Mechanical operation\r\n\r\n     - Temporary disabilities\r\n\r\n     - Permanent disabilities\r\n\r\n     - General\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mechanical operation_\r\n\r\nIn order to take good fingerprints, the necessary equipment should be\r\nmaintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times.\r\n\r\nPoor impressions are usually caused by one of the following faults:\r\n\r\n1. The use of poor, thin, or colored ink, resulting in impressions\r\nwhich are too light and faint, or in which the ink has run,\r\nobliterating the ridges. The best results will be obtained by using\r\nheavy black printer's ink, a paste which should not be thinned before\r\nusing. This ink will dry quickly and will not blur or smear with\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to clean thoroughly the inking apparatus and the fingers of\r\nforeign substances and perspiration, causing the appearance of false\r\nmarkings and the disappearance of characteristics. Windshield cleaner,\r\ngasoline, benzine, and alcohol are good cleansing agents, but any\r\nfluid may be used. In warm weather each finger should be wiped dry of\r\nperspiration before printing.\r\n\r\n3. Failure to roll the fingers fully from one side to the other and to\r\nink the whole area from tip to below the first fissure. The result of\r\nthis is that the focal points of the impressions (the deltas or cores)\r\ndo not appear. The whole finger surface from joint to tip and from\r\nside to side should appear.\r\n\r\n4. The use of too much ink, obliterating or obscuring the ridges. If\r\nprinter's ink is used, just a touch of the tube end to the inking\r\nplate will suffice for several sets of prints. It should be spread to\r\na thin, even film by rolling.\r\n\r\n5. Insufficient ink, resulting in ridges too light and faint to be\r\ncounted or traced.\r\n\r\n6. Allowing the fingers to slip or twist, resulting in smears, blurs,\r\nand false-appearing patterns. The fingers should be held lightly\r\nwithout too much pressure. The subject should be warned not to try to\r\nhelp but to remain passive.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations numbered 366 through 377 show the results of these\r\nfaults and show also the same fingers taken in the proper manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illegible inked prints_\r\n\r\nA brief review of the problems of classifying and filing a fingerprint\r\ncard in the FBI will help to clarify the FBI's policy concerning the\r\nprocessing of \"bad\" inked fingerprints.\r\n\r\nThe criminal fingerprint file contains the fingerprints of millions of\r\nindividuals. The complete classification formula is used. To obtain\r\nit, each inked finger must show all the essential characteristics.\r\nBecause of the immense volume of prints it has become necessary to\r\nextend the normal classification formula.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this point:\r\n\r\n          dWdwc\r\n          xCdwc\r\n     O 32  W   OOO 18\r\n     I 32  W   III\r\n\r\nIn order to subdivide the 32 over 32 primary still further, the ridge\r\ncount of the whorl of the right little finger is used to obtain a\r\nfinal classification. The extension above the normal classification\r\nformula indicates that each whorl is classified as to the type;\r\nnamely, plain whorl (W), double loop (D), central pocket loop (C), and\r\naccidental (X). Accordingly, it is not enough for the FBI\r\nIdentification Division to ascertain the general whorl pattern type,\r\nbut the deltas and core must show in order to obtain the ridge\r\ntracing, the type of whorl, and also, in some instances, the ridge\r\ncount. The complete WCDX extension is outlined in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nFigures 366 to 377 are some examples of improperly and properly taken\r\ninked fingerprints.\r\n\r\nAn examination of figure 372 shows that it is a whorl. In order to\r\nclassify the ridge tracing accurately, however, so that the\r\nfingerprint card can be placed in the correct classification, the left\r\ndelta must show. The approximate ridge tracing for the whorl in figure\r\n372 would be MEETING. An examination of the properly taken fingerprint\r\nin figure 373 indicates that the correct ridge tracing is INNER. It\r\nfollows that the pattern in figure 372 would not have been placed in\r\nthe proper place in file.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 366. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 367. Proper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 368. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 369. Proper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 370. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 371. Proper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 372. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 373. Proper.]\r\n\r\nThe correct whorl tracing is needed to obtain the complete\r\nsubsecondary and the major classifications.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that both deltas are present in figure 374. This would\r\nenable the technical expert to ascertain the correct ridge tracing,\r\nOUTER. In the core of the whorl, however, there is a heavy amount of\r\nink which makes it impossible to determine the type of whorl with any\r\ndegree of accuracy. If one were to hazard a guess, it would appear to\r\nbe a plain whorl. Actually, the correct type of whorl, a double loop,\r\nis clearly visible in figure 375.\r\n\r\nIt can be ascertained that the pattern in figure 376 is a loop, but an\r\naccurate ridge count cannot be obtained because the left delta does\r\nnot appear. The approximate ridge count of this loop is 14 to 16.\r\nThis approximation is sufficient for a fingerprint expert to place\r\nthis loop in the \"O\" group of any finger of the subsecondary. The\r\ncorrect ridge count of this loop is 19, and it appears in illustration\r\n377. The approximate ridge count is not sufficient to place this print\r\nproperly in the large files of the FBI because in certain general\r\ncomplete classification formulas the accurate ridge count is needed to\r\nobtain an extension. These extensions use a smaller grouping of ridge\r\ncounts to form a valuation table, and in this way, differ from the\r\nlarger grouping of ridge counts which form the basis of the\r\nsubsecondary classification. These extensions are called the second\r\nsubsecondary and the special loop extension and are outlined in\r\nchapter VI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 374. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 375. Proper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 376. Improper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 377. Proper.]\r\n\r\nThere are two additional points which illustrate the FBI's need for\r\nthe delta, ridges, and core to show clearly in loops. The first point\r\nis set forth: the ridge count of the loop may be needed to obtain the\r\nkey classification. The key classification is an actual ridge count,\r\nand no valuation table is used to obtain a subdivision. The key\r\nclassification is used as an integral part of the fingerprint filing\r\nsystem. The second point is as follows: the ridge count may be needed\r\nto obtain the final classification. The final classification is an\r\nactual ridge count, and no valuation table is used to obtain a\r\nsubdivision. The final classification is used as an integral part of\r\nthe fingerprint filing system.\r\n\r\nThe following are just a few examples to illustrate the completeness\r\nof the classification formula used in the FBI fingerprint file:\r\n\r\n12       M            9           R            OIO            11\r\n\r\n         S            1           R            IOI\r\n\r\nKey     Major      Primary     Secondary    Subsecondary     Final\r\n\r\n6                   17            aW            IIO            9\r\n\r\n                     1            U             OII\r\nKey               Primary     Small letter  Subsecondary     Final\r\n                               Secondary\r\n\r\n8       S            1           Ua              II            6\r\n        S            1            U             III\r\n\r\nKey     Major      Primary     Small letter (Subsecondary     Final\r\n                                Secondary     Extension)\r\n\r\n                                               SML  (Second\r\n                                               SML    Subsecondary)\r\n5       0            5           U             IOO            14\r\n\r\n        I            17          U             IOO\r\n\r\nKey     Major      Primary     Secondary    Subsecondary     Final\r\n\r\n                                                245 (Special Loop\r\n                                                332  Extension)\r\n14      M            1           U             IOO            16\r\n\r\n        S            1           U             OII\r\n\r\nKey     Major      Primary     Secondary    Subsecondary     Final\r\n\r\n15      I            29            W           IOO            19\r\n\r\n        I            28            W           OOI\r\n\r\nKey     Major      Primary     Secondary    Subsecondary     Final\r\n\r\nThese several examples should help to illustrate the FBI's extended\r\nclassification formulas for classifying and filing fingerprints. The\r\nlarger collection of fingerprints must of necessity call for a more\r\ndetailed analysis of all fingerprint characteristic details. The\r\ncloser examination to obtain further fingerprint subdivisions is\r\ndependent on ten legible inked impressions.\r\n\r\nThe identification officer will understand the problems of accurately\r\nclassifying and filing fingerprint cards. He knows there is little\r\nvalue in placing a fingerprint card in the FBI's files with only an\r\napproximate or an inaccurate classification.\r\n\r\nEvery fingerprint card filed in the FBI's file is of value to the\r\nparticular law enforcement agency which forwarded it, as well as to\r\nall other law enforcement agencies which rely on its being correctly\r\nclassified and filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Temporary disabilities_\r\n\r\nThere are temporary disabilities affecting an individual's hand which\r\nare sometimes beyond the control of the identification officer. These\r\ncan be fresh cuts, or wounds, bandaged fingers or finger, occupational\r\n(carpenters, bricklayers, etc.) blisters, and excessive perspiration.\r\nChildren, whose ridges are small and fine, would also come under this\r\nheading. Extreme care should be exercised in fingerprinting the\r\naforementioned.\r\n\r\nAn indication on the fingerprint card to the effect \"fresh cut,\r\nbandaged\" is not sufficient to file the fingerprint card. It is\r\nobvious that a fingerprint card bearing these notations cannot be\r\nproperly classified and filed. The same situation would occur if there\r\nwere a blister on an individual's finger. The blister temporarily\r\ndisfigures the ridge detail. When an injury is temporary, the prints,\r\nif at all possible, should not be taken until after the injury has\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nOccupational problems (bricklayers, carpenters, etc.) are definitely a\r\nchallenge to the identification officer. In some instances, by means\r\nof softening agents (oils and creams), it is possible to obtain\r\nlegible inked impressions. It is further suggested that in these cases\r\na very small amount of ink should be used on the inking plate.\r\n\r\nExcessive perspiration can be controlled to some extent by the\r\nidentification officer. Excessive perspiration causes the inked\r\nimpressions to be indistinct. It is suggested in these cases to wipe\r\nthe finger with a cloth and then immediately ink the finger and roll\r\nit on the fingerprint card. This process should be followed with each\r\nfinger. It is also suggested that possibly the fingers could be wiped\r\nwith alcohol, benzine, or similar fluid which would act as a drying\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nIn all the above situations, if it is not possible to accurately\r\nclassify and file the fingerprint card, the name appearing on the card\r\nwill be searched in the alphabetical files and then returned to the\r\nlaw-enforcement agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Permanent disabilities_\r\n\r\nAnother phase involves permanent disabilities which can in most cases\r\nbe controlled by the identification officer. These can be lack of\r\nfingers (born without), amputations, crippled fingers (bent, broken),\r\ndeformities (webbed, extra fingers), and old age.\r\n\r\nWith respect to lack of fingers, it should be noted that some\r\nindividuals are born without certain fingers. The notation \"missing\"\r\nis not satisfactory because it does not sufficiently explain the\r\ncorrect situation. It is suggested that \"missing at birth\" or some\r\nsimilar notation be made in the individual fingerprint block on the\r\ncard. A proper notation concerning this situation will prevent the\r\nfingerprint card from being returned. Figures 378 and 379 illustrate\r\ntemporary and permanent disabilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 378. Temporary disability.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 379. Permanent disability.]\r\n\r\nConcerning amputations, it is suggested that a proper notation to this\r\neffect appear in the individual fingerprint block or blocks. It is\r\nsuggested that if a portion of the first joint of a finger is\r\namputated, the finger should be inked and printed. A notation\r\nconcerning this fact should be made on the fingerprint card in the\r\nindividual fingerprint block.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where all of the fingers are amputated, the inked\r\nfootprints should be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe handling of crippled fingers and certain deformities can be\r\ndiscussed in a group because they generally present the same problems.\r\nIt is not sufficient in all cases to indicate \"broken,\" \"bent,\"\r\n\"crippled.\" If the fingers are bent or crippled so that they are\r\ntouching the palm and cannot be moved, a notation to this effect\r\nshould be on the fingerprint card in the proper individual fingerprint\r\nblock. However, it is believed that these extreme cases are rare. It\r\nis suggested that the special inking devices used for taking the\r\nprints of deceased individuals be used in taking inked impressions of\r\nbent or crippled fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 380. The spatula, roller, and curved holder used for\r\ntaking the inked prints of bent or crippled fingers.]\r\n\r\nThis equipment, which will be discussed more fully in the section on\r\nprinting deceased persons, consists of spatula, small roller, and a\r\ncurved holder for the individual finger block. Figure 380 shows the\r\nspatula, roller, and curved holder. It should be further noted in\r\nfigure 380 that there are a strip of the entire hand of the\r\nfingerprint card and also individual finger blocks cut from the\r\nfingerprint card. Each of these types can be used in connection with\r\nthe curved holder.\r\n\r\nEach crippled finger is taken as a separate unit and then the finger\r\nblock pasted on a fingerprint card. In figure 381, note the use of the\r\nspatula for applying the ink to a bent or crippled finger; and in\r\nfigure 382, observe the use of the curved holder for taking the\r\n\"rolled\" impression of a bent or crippled finger.\r\n\r\nOld age has been placed under permanent disability only for discussion\r\npurposes. The problem is not encountered frequently in taking the\r\nfingerprints of individuals who are arrested. The situation of\r\ncrippled fingers due to old age may be met, and it can be handled as\r\npreviously suggested. In most cases the problems arise because of the\r\nvery faint ridges of the individual. It is believed that in the\r\nmajority of cases, legibly inked prints can be taken by using a very\r\nsmall amount of ink on the inking plate and by using little pressure\r\nin the rolling of the fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 381. The use of the spatula in the application of ink\r\nto the finger.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 382. The use of the curved holder for taking the\r\n\"rolled\" impression.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deformities_\r\n\r\nIf a subject has more than 10 fingers, as occasionally happens, the\r\nthumbs and the next 4 fingers to them should be printed, and any\r\nfingers left over should be printed on the other side of the card with\r\na notation made to the effect that they are extra fingers. When a\r\nperson with more than 10 fingers has an intentional amputation\r\nperformed, it is invariably the extra finger on the little finger side\r\nwhich is amputated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 383]\r\n\r\nIt also happens, not infrequently, that a subject will have two or\r\nmore fingers webbed or grown together, as in figures 383 and 384,\r\nmaking it impossible to roll such fingers on the inside. Such fingers\r\nshould be rolled, however, as completely as possible, and a notation\r\nmade to the effect that they are joined.\r\n\r\nSplit thumbs, i.e., thumbs having two nail joints, as in figure 385,\r\nare classified as if the joint toward the outside of the hand were not\r\npresent. In other words the inner joint is used, and no consideration\r\nwhatever is given to the outer joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 384]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 385]\r\n\r\n\r\n_General_\r\n\r\nThese problems have dealt with the mechanical or operational\r\nprocesses. However, there are other problems dealing with the\r\ncompleting of the descriptive information. The fingerprint card may be\r\nreturned because of the lack of information in the spaces provided,\r\nsuch as name, sex, race, height, weight, etc. Any discrepancies in\r\nthis information may necessitate the return of the fingerprint card.\r\n\r\nThe success and value of the FBI's fingerprint files to all law\r\nenforcement agencies are dependent, in a large measure, on the legibly\r\ninked fingerprints taken by law enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nFigure 386 shows an enlarged portion of the bulb of a finger revealing\r\nthe microscopic structure of the friction skin. The epidermis consists\r\nof two main layers, namely, the stratum corneum, which covers the\r\nsurface, and the stratum mucosum, which is just beneath the covering\r\nsurface. The stratum mucosum is folded under the surface so as to form\r\nridges which will run lengthwise and correspond to the surface\r\nridges. However, these are twice as numerous since the deeper ridges\r\nwhich correspond to the middle of the surface ridges alternate with\r\nsmaller ones which correspond to the furrows. The sweat pores run in\r\nsingle rows along the ridges and communicate through the sweat ducts\r\nwith the coil sweat glands which are below the entire epidermis. The\r\nfriction ridges result from the fusion in rows of separate epidermic\r\nelements, such as the dot shown on the left. Generally speaking, when\r\nan individual bruises or slightly cuts the outer layer or stratum\r\ncorneum of the bulb of the finger, the ridges will not be permanently\r\ndefaced. However, if a more serious injury is inflicted on the bulb of\r\nthe finger, thereby damaging the stratum mucosum, the friction skin\r\nwill heal, but not in its original formation. The serious injury will\r\nresult in a permanent scar appearing on the bulb of the finger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 386]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_Problems and Practices in Fingerprinting the Dead_\r\n\r\n\r\nEach year new graves are opened in potter's fields all over the United\r\nStates. Into many of them are placed the unknown dead--those who have\r\nlived anonymously or who, through accident or otherwise, lose their\r\nlives under such circumstances that identification seems impossible.\r\nIn a majority of such cases, after the burial of the body, no single\r\nitem or clue remains to effect subsequent identification. As a result,\r\nactive investigation usually ceases and the cases are forgotten,\r\nunless, of course, it is definitely established that a murder has been\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nReliance is too often placed on visual inspection in establishing the\r\nidentity of the deceased. This includes having the remains viewed by\r\nindividuals seeking to locate a lost friend or relative. The body is\r\noften decomposed. If death was caused by burning, the victim may be\r\nunrecognizable. As a result of many fatal accidents the deceased is\r\noften mutilated, particularly about the face, so that visual\r\nidentification is impossible. Yet, in many cases, the only attempt at\r\nidentification is by having persons view the remains and the personal\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe recorded instances of erroneous visual identifications are\r\nnumerous. In one case a body, burned beyond recognition, was\r\nidentified by relatives as that of a 21-year-old man; yet fingerprints\r\nlater proved that the corpse was that of a 55-year-old man.\r\n\r\nFingerprints have frequently been instrumental in establishing the\r\ncorrect identity of persons killed in airplane crashes and incorrectly\r\n\"identified\" by close relatives.\r\n\r\nIn one instance a woman found dead in a hotel room was \"positively\"\r\nidentified by several close friends. The body was shipped to the\r\nfather of the alleged deceased in another state where again it was\r\n\"identified\" by close friends. Burial followed. Approximately one\r\nmonth later the persons who had first identified the body as that of\r\ntheir friend were sitting in a tavern when the \"dead\" woman walked\r\ninto the room. Authorities were immediately advised of the error; they\r\nin turn advised the authorities in the neighboring state of the\r\nerroneous identification and steps were taken immediately to rectify\r\nthe mistake. After permission had been granted by the State Health\r\nBoard to exhume the body of the dead woman, fingerprints were taken\r\nand copies were forwarded to the FBI Identification Division. The\r\nfinger impressions were searched through the fingerprint files and the\r\ntrue identity of the deceased was established.\r\n\r\nDuring a 12-month period, the FBI Identification Division received\r\nthe fingerprints of 1,708 unknown dead. Of these, 1,298, or almost 76\r\npercent, were identified. The remaining 410 were not identified simply\r\nbecause fingerprints of these individuals were not in the FBI files.\r\nIt should be noted that in these 1,708 cases, it was possible to\r\nsecure legible fingerprints of the deceased in the usual manner by\r\ninking the fingers in those instances in which decomposition had not\r\ninjured the ridge detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 387. Field equipment for disaster identification.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fingerprints of 1,708 unknown dead, the\r\nIdentification Division received the fingers and/or the hands of 85\r\nunknown dead individuals. In these cases, decomposition was so far\r\nadvanced that it was not possible to secure inked fingerprints in the\r\nregular manner. Of these, 68 bodies, or 80 percent of the group, were\r\nidentified. Of the 17 unidentified, the fingerprints of 14 were not in\r\nthe FBI files. In three cases decomposition was so far advanced that\r\nall ridge detail had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn order to emphasize what can be accomplished, it is pointed out that\r\nin those cases in which hands and fingers were submitted, the time\r\nwhich elapsed from death until the specimens were received ranged from\r\na week to 3 years. Incredible as it may seem, it has been possible to\r\nsecure identifiable impressions 3 years after death.\r\n\r\nThese statistics of achievement in the field of identifying unknown\r\ndead re-emphasize the fact that in all cases involving the\r\nidentification of a deceased person, fingerprints should be used as\r\nthe medium for establishing a conclusive and positive identification.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, in the course of their work fingerprint operators\r\nfind it necessary to take the impressions of three classes of deceased\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n     - Those who have died recently, in which cases the task is\r\n     relatively simple.\r\n\r\n     - Those dead for a longer period, in which cases difficulty\r\n     is experienced due to pronounced stiffening of the fingers,\r\n     the early stages of decomposition, or both.\r\n\r\n     - Those cases in which extreme difficulty is encountered\r\n     because of maceration, desiccation, or advanced decay of the\r\n     skin.\r\n\r\nThese problems will be considered separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1. Fingerprinting the Newly Dead._\r\n\r\nWhen the fingers are flexible it is often possible to secure inked\r\nfingerprint impressions of a deceased person through the regular\r\ninking process on a standard fingerprint card. Experience has proved\r\nthat this task can be made easier if the deceased is laid face down\r\nand palms down on a table (fig. 388).\r\n\r\nIn all cases where inked impressions are to be made, care should be\r\nexercised to see that the fingers are clean and dry before inking. If\r\nnecessary, wash the digits with soap and water and dry thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIn the event difficulty is encountered in trying to procure\r\nfingerprints by the regular method, it may prove more convenient to\r\ncut the 10 \"squares\" numbered for the rolled impressions from a\r\nfingerprint card. After the finger is inked, the square is rolled\r\naround the finger without letting it slip. Extreme caution should be\r\nexercised to see that each square bears the correct fingerprint\r\nimpression. After all the inked impressions are properly taken, the\r\nten squares bearing the impressions are pasted or stapled to a\r\nstandard fingerprint card in their proper positions, i.e., right\r\nthumb, right index, right middle, etc. Whenever possible the \"plain\"\r\nor \"simultaneous\" impressions should also be taken.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it will be found necessary to obtain or improvise a tool\r\nsimilar to a broad-bladed putty knife or spatula to be used as an\r\ninking instrument. The ink is rolled evenly and thinly on the knife or\r\nspatula and applied to the finger by passing the inked knife or\r\nspatula around it. The tool, of course, replaces the usual glass\r\ninking slab or plate, the use of which is extremely difficult or\r\nawkward when printing a deceased person.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2. Fingerprinting the Dead, Where Stiffening of the Fingers and/or\r\nEarly Decomposition Are Present._\r\n\r\nThis second group consists of cases in which the hands of the deceased\r\nare clenched, or the finger tips are wrinkled, or decomposition has\r\nbegun, and/or where there are combinations of these three conditions.\r\nCases of this sort may necessitate cutting off the skin. Legal\r\nauthority is necessary before cutting a corpse. Such authority may be\r\ngranted by state law or by an official having authority to grant such\r\na right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 388]\r\n\r\nIn cases where rigor mortis (stiffening of the muscles) has set in and\r\nthe fingers are tightly clenched, the fingers may be forcibly\r\nstraightened by \"breaking the rigor.\" This is done by holding the hand\r\nof the deceased person firmly with one hand, grasping the finger to be\r\nstraightened with the four fingers of the other hand and placing the\r\nthumb, which is used as a lever, on the knuckle of the finger and\r\nforcing it straight (fig. 389). The inking tool and \"squares,\" as\r\npreviously explained, are then used to secure the fingerprint.\r\n\r\nIn the event the rigor cannot be completely overcome, it will be most\r\nhelpful to improvise or secure a spoon-shaped tool for holding the cut\r\nsquares or cut strips while printing the fingers, similar to the tool\r\nmentioned briefly in the discussion of crippled fingers. This tool,\r\nsomewhat resembling a gouge without the sharp edge, should have a\r\nhandle, a concave end, and a frame or clamp to hold the cardboard\r\nsquares or strips. In Figure 390, one type of tool is illustrated.\r\nThis tool eliminates the necessity of rolling the deceased's finger,\r\nsince the \"square\" assumes the concave shape of the tool, and the\r\ngentle pressure applied to the inked finger when it is brought in\r\ncontact with the square results in a \"rolled\" impression without\r\nactually rolling the finger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 389]\r\n\r\nAnother problem encountered in this second group includes cases in\r\nwhich the tips of the fingers are fairly pliable and intact, yet due\r\nto the presence of wrinkles in the skin, complete impressions cannot\r\nbe obtained. This condition can be corrected by the injection of a\r\ntissue builder, procurable from a dealer in undertaker's supplies. If\r\nthis is not available, glycerin or water may be used.\r\n\r\nThe method is simple. Injection of the tissue builder, glycerin, or\r\nwater, is accomplished by the use of a hypodermic syringe. The\r\nhypodermic needle is injected at the joint of the finger up into the\r\ntip of the finger, care being used to keep the needle below the skin\r\nsurface (fig. 391). The solution is injected until the finger \"bulbs\"\r\nare rounded out, after which they are inked and printed.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in stubborn cases, entry of the needle at the joint and\r\ninjection of the fluid will not completely fill the finger bulb. It\r\nmay be necessary, therefore, to inject the fluid at other points of\r\nthe finger such as the extreme tip or sides, until suitable results\r\nare achieved (fig. 392). The tissue builder has a distinct advantage\r\nover glycerin or water, inasmuch as the builder hardens after a short\r\ntime and is not lost, whereas glycerin and water sometimes seep out\r\nwhen pressure is applied in printing. To offset seepage at the point\r\nwhere the hypodermic needle is injected, whenever possible, tie a\r\npiece of string tightly around the finger just above the point of\r\nentry of the needle.\r\n\r\nWhen the tissue builder is purchased, a solvent for cleaning the\r\nhypodermic syringe and needle should be acquired, inasmuch as the\r\nbuilder will harden in the syringe and needle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 390]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 391]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 392]\r\n\r\nThose cases in which decomposition in its early stage is present\r\nbelong in this group also. Frequently, the outer layer of skin has\r\nbegun to peel from the fingers. A careful examination should be made\r\nto determine if the peeling skin is intact or if a part of it has been\r\nlost. If the skin is in one piece, an effort should be made to secure\r\nprints just as though it were attached normally to the finger. Or, if\r\nit is deemed advisable, the skin may be peeled off in one piece,\r\nplaced over the finger of the operator, and inked and printed as\r\nthough it were his own finger.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the first layer of skin is missing. There remains the\r\ndermis or second layer of skin which is also of value for\r\nidentification purposes. This second layer would be dealt with as\r\nthough it were the outside skin, using the techniques described above.\r\nThe ridge detail of the second layer of skin is less pronounced than\r\nthat of the outer skin, however, and more attention and care are\r\nneeded in order to obtain suitable impressions.\r\n\r\nSo far this discussion has dealt with the taking of impressions of\r\nfingers when the flesh is fairly firm and the ridge detail intact. A\r\ndifferent problem arises when the fingers are in various stages of\r\ndecay. The techniques of treating the fingers in such cases vary\r\ngreatly, depending upon the condition of the fingers with respect to\r\ndecomposition, desiccation, or maceration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3. Fingerprinting the Dead in Difficult Cases._\r\n\r\nIn cases involving badly decomposed bodies the first thing to do is to\r\nexamine the fingers to see if all are present. If they are not, an\r\neffort should be made to determine whether the missing finger or\r\nfingers or even a hand was amputated during the person's lifetime, or\r\nwhether the loss was due to other causes such as destruction by animal\r\nor marine life. Deductions from this examination should be noted on\r\nthe fingerprint record. This point is made in view of the fact that in\r\nthe fingerprint files of the FBI and some police departments, the\r\nfingerprint cards reflecting amputations are filed separately. Noting\r\namputations may lessen to a great extent a search through the\r\nfingerprint files.\r\n\r\nIn making the initial examination, attention should be given to the\r\nremoval of dirt, silt, grease and other foreign matter from the\r\nfingers. Soap and water are good cleansing agents. So is xylene, a\r\nchemical which will readily clean grease and fatty matter from the\r\nfingers. Good results can be achieved by utilizing a child's\r\nsoft-bristled toothbrush in cases where the skin is fairly firm. The\r\nbrushing should be done lightly and the strokes should follow the\r\nridge design in order to clean not only the ridges but the depressions\r\nas well. In the event that the skin is not firm enough to use the\r\ntoothbrush, a cotton swab may be used. The fingers should be wiped\r\nvery lightly with either soap and water or xylene, always following\r\nthe ridge contours.\r\n\r\nAt this point the fingers are again examined to determine the\r\ncondition they are in, based upon the circumstances in which the body\r\nwas found. Study and actual experience have shown that there are three\r\ngeneral types of conditions to be considered: Decomposition or\r\nputrefaction, prevalent in bodies found in brush or buried in earth;\r\ndesiccation or mummification (that is, dried out), noted in bodies\r\nwhich have been found in the open (ridge detail not in contact with\r\nthe ground) in dry protected places, or bodies subjected to severe\r\nheat; and the group involving maceration (water soaking), which\r\nordinarily results from being immersed in water.\r\n\r\nThe degree of decomposition, desiccation, or maceration varies from a\r\ncomparatively early stage to an extremely advanced stage. Accordingly,\r\neach case must be considered individually. For example, what is done\r\nsuccessfully in one case of desiccation may not show favorable results\r\nin another. Hence, the techniques outlined below point out generally\r\nwhat can be done, and has been done, with success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 393]\r\n\r\nWhen a body is found, the hands usually will be tightly clenched. The\r\nfirst problem will be to straighten the fingers. If rigor mortis has\r\nset in and an effort to straighten the fingers as previously explained\r\nfails, the difficulty can be overcome easily. Using a scalpel, make a\r\ndeep cut at the second joint on the inner side of each of the four\r\nfingers. They can now be straightened with the application of force\r\n(fig. 393). The thumb, if it is cramped or bent, can generally be\r\nstraightened by making a deep cut between the thumb and the index\r\nfinger. These incisions are made for the obvious purpose of examining\r\nthe fingers to determine if there is any ridge detail. Before this\r\nfact can be definitely ascertained it may be necessary to cleanse the\r\npattern areas with soap and water or xylene, as previously explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 394]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Advanced decomposition_\r\n\r\nIf the case is one involving decomposition, the operator is confronted\r\nwith the problem of dealing with flesh which is rotted or putrefied.\r\nThe flesh may be soft or flabby and very fragile. If this is so, an\r\nexamination is made of the finger tips to see if the outer skin is\r\npresent. If the outer skin is present and intact, it may be possible,\r\nusing extreme care, to ink and print in the regular manner. Sometimes,\r\nthe outer skin, although present, will be too soft and fragile to ink\r\nand roll in the regular way. In such cases, when the ridge detail is\r\ndiscernible, the skin, if it is easily removed from the finger, or the\r\nfinger itself may be cut off at the second joint and placed in a 10-\r\nto 15-percent solution of formaldehyde for approximately an hour to\r\nharden it. Skin placed in a formaldehyde solution usually turns a\r\ngrayish white and becomes firm. However, it will be brittle and may\r\nsplit if not handled carefully. The skin is placed in the solution\r\nonly until it hardens sufficiently, after which it is removed and\r\ncarefully wiped dry with a piece of cloth. Then the skin, placed over\r\nthe operator's own thumb or index finger and held in place by his\r\nother hand, is inked and rolled as though the operator were printing\r\nhis own finger. If a legible print is not obtainable in this manner,\r\nthe operator should examine the underside of the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 395]\r\n\r\nIn many instances, where the ridge detail on the outer surface has\r\nbeen destroyed or is not discernible, the ridge detail is clearly\r\nvisible on the underside (fig. 394). If this is the case, the skin is\r\ninverted (turned inside out) very carefully to prevent splitting or\r\nbreaking and then is inked and printed in the usual way. It must be\r\nborne in mind, however, that when the underside of the skin is printed\r\nthe resulting impression will be in reverse color and position; that\r\nis, the ink is actually adhering to what would be furrows of the\r\npattern when viewed from the proper or outer side. If it is deemed\r\ninadvisable to try to invert or turn the skin inside out for fear of\r\ndamaging it, a photograph of the inner ridge detail is made and the\r\nnegative is printed to give an \"as is\" position photograph for proper\r\nclassification and comparison purposes. In order to secure good\r\nphotographs of the ridge detail it may be advisable to trim the skin,\r\nflatten it out between two pieces of glass, and photograph it in that\r\nposition (fig. 395).\r\n\r\nWhen the entire finger is placed in the solution during the hardening\r\nprocess, the skin, in absorbing the formalin solution, may swell and\r\ncome loose from the finger. Should this occur, the skin must be\r\nremoved carefully and the procedure outlined above followed. If,\r\nhowever, the skin still adheres to the finger and is not too wrinkled,\r\nink is applied and prints made. Should the skin be too wrinkled to\r\nsecure a satisfactory impression, consideration is given to the\r\ninjection of the tissue builder under the skin as previously\r\nmentioned, in order to distend the pattern area. If successful, the\r\nfinger is inked and printed. This, of course, can be done only when\r\nthe skin is intact.\r\n\r\nShould part of the skin be destroyed to the extent that tissue builder\r\ncannot be injected effectively, while examination discloses that the\r\npattern area is present but wrinkled, cut off the entire pattern area\r\nfrom the joint to the tip of the finger (fig. 396). Care must be\r\nexercised to insure getting the complete fingerprint pattern as well\r\nas cutting deep enough to avoid injury to the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 396]\r\n\r\nAfter excision, the flesh is carefully and meticulously removed from\r\nthe inside by scraping, cutting, and trimming until only the skin\r\nremains, or until the specimen is so thin it can be flattened out to\r\nremove most of the wrinkles. If the skin is fairly pliable, the\r\noperator should attempt to place it over one of his own fingers and\r\ntry several prints. If the prints secured are not suitable, the piece\r\nof skin (exert care to avoid breaking or splitting) is flattened out\r\nbetween two pieces of glass and photographed (figs. 397, 398, 399).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 397. Inked print made from the finger of deceased\r\nbefore treatment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 398. Inked print made after skin was removed and\r\ntreated.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 399. Photograph of ridge detail of skin flattened\r\nbetween two pieces of glass.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing outline covers the procedures followed in cases\r\ninvolving decomposition in which the outer skin is still present. In\r\nmany instances of decomposition the outer skin has been destroyed or\r\nis in such a condition as to be of no value. It must be emphasized\r\nagain that the second layer of skin possesses the same ridge detail as\r\nthe outer layer and this, though finer and less pronounced, is just as\r\neffective for identification purposes.\r\n\r\nIf, from examination, it is apparent that the outer layer of skin is\r\nmissing and the second layer is intact, the finger should be cleansed,\r\ndried, inked, and printed in the usual manner. If the specimen is\r\nwrinkled but pliable it may be possible to inject tissue builder, as\r\npreviously mentioned, to round out the finger, then ink and print it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, some of the outer skin is still attached but is of no\r\nvalue. This skin should be removed by carefully picking or prying it\r\noff with a scalpel in such a manner as not to destroy or injure the\r\nridge detail of the second layer. After the outer fragments have been\r\nremoved, the second layer is cleaned, inked, and printed. In the event\r\nthe resultant impressions are not suitable for classification and\r\nidentification purposes, the most likely reason for it is that the\r\nridge detail is too fine to print even though there are few if any\r\nwrinkles in it. If this is the case, the finger should be cut off at\r\nthe second joint and photographed. Should wrinkles which cannot be\r\nremoved by injecting tissue builder, and which also preclude the\r\ntaking of suitable photographs, be present, the pattern area is cut\r\noff with a scalpel from the first joint to the tip. The flesh is then\r\ncut and scraped out as previously described, until the specimen is\r\nthin enough to flatten out between two pieces of glass which may be\r\nheld together by scotch tape. The skin is then photographed.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, even after the flattening process it will be noted in\r\nthe ground glass of the camera that the skin may be seen plainly but\r\nthe ridge detail is very poor. This difficulty may be due to the poor\r\ncontrast of the ridges and furrows when using direct lighting. If so,\r\nit can be overcome by scraping the skin to transparency and then\r\nphotographing it by transmitted light (i.e., passing light through the\r\nskin). Sometimes, due to the condition of the skin, even though it is\r\ntissue thin, it will not be transparent. This can be overcome by\r\nsoaking the skin in xylene for a few minutes and then photographing it\r\nby transmitted light while it is still impregnated with the xylene. If\r\nthe substance dries too fast to permit proper photographing, the skin\r\nshould be photographed while immersed in the xylene. (See subtopic of\r\nthis chapter pertaining to \"general photography.\") Of course, after\r\nthe skin has been photographed the negative should be printed to give\r\na reverse position so that the print will be comparable with inked\r\nimpressions on fingerprint cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Desiccation and charring_\r\n\r\nThe problem confronting the fingerprint examiner in treating fingers\r\nwhich are desiccated or dried and shriveled is that of distending and\r\nsoftening the skin. Desiccated fingers are generally found to have the\r\nouter layer of skin intact and the ridge detail fairly clear. However,\r\ndue to the shrinking, numerous wrinkles will be present, and as the\r\ndrying process continues the skin and flesh harden until the fingers\r\nbecome almost as hard as stone.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes possible to distend or swell the flesh by utilizing a\r\n1- to 3-percent solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide,\r\nsometimes referred to as caustic potash. As a matter of caution, this\r\nprocess should be tried with one finger before using it for the\r\nremaining fingers. This point of caution is made because of the\r\nreaction of the potassium or sodium hydroxide, which is actually one\r\nof destruction. While absorption and swelling of the flesh occur, the\r\ndisintegrating action of the fluid may result in total destruction of\r\nthe flesh.\r\n\r\nThe finger to be distended is cut from the hand at the second joint\r\nand placed in the hydroxide. When it has resumed its normal size by\r\nthe absorption of the solution, it is inked and printed. There is no\r\nset time for this process. The procedure may require a few hours or as\r\nmuch as several days until suitable results are obtained.\r\n\r\nAfter the finger has been in the solution for about 30 minutes, it\r\nshould be removed and examined in order to note the extent of the\r\nswelling and the reaction of the flesh to the solution. If no material\r\nchange is noted, the finger is returned to the solution. A close watch\r\nis maintained and the finger is examined from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe solution may cause thin layers of skin to peel from the finger.\r\nShould this occur, the loose skin is carefully scraped off and the\r\nfinger rinsed in water for a few minutes. It is then returned to the\r\nhydroxide for continuation of the process.\r\n\r\nIf, during the course of an inspection, it is seen that the flesh is\r\nbecoming too soft, the finger should be placed in a 1- to 3-percent\r\nsolution of formaldehyde or alcohol for several minutes in order to\r\nharden it.\r\n\r\nIf, after several hours in the hydroxide, the finger has not reached\r\nits normal size, it should be placed in water for an hour or two. This\r\nhas a tendency to hasten the swelling. When the finger is removed, it\r\nwill be noted that a film has coated the surface. This coating is\r\ncarefully scraped off and the finger is replaced in the hydroxide\r\nsolution for an hour or so, again scraped if coated, soaked in clean\r\nwater, etc. This process of alternating from solution to water,\r\nscraping, and replacing in hydroxide is continued until desirable\r\nresults are obtained. The finger is then inked and printed.\r\n\r\nThe above process will so saturate the finger with solution that it\r\nmay be too wet to print properly. Accordingly, the finger may be\r\ndipped into acetone for several seconds, removed, and be permitted to\r\ndry, after which it is inked and printed.\r\n\r\nThe complete process may take from several hours to as much as 10 days\r\nto secure suitable results. If the final results of the above\r\nprocedure are satisfactory with the one finger being tested, the\r\nremaining fingers are given the same treatment. Care must be taken to\r\nidentify each finger properly as to right index, right middle, etc.,\r\nto avoid any mixup.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the reaction of the solution on the first finger\r\ntreated is not satisfactory and the operator feels that it would be\r\nfutile to continue the process, the finger should be removed from the\r\nsolution immediately, washed carefully in water, and placed in\r\nformaldehyde to harden sufficiently for it to be handled without\r\ncausing injury to the ridges. The pattern area is cut off in such a\r\nmanner that sufficient surrounding surface permits the skin to be\r\ntrimmed. Then from the cut side the skin is carefully scraped and cut\r\nto remove the excess flesh. While the cutting and scraping are being\r\ndone, from time to time the skin should be soaked in xylene and\r\nmassaged for purposes of softening to remove wrinkles. When the skin\r\nis thin enough and sufficiently pliable, the operator places the skin\r\non his own finger, inks and prints it in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nIf the results are satisfactory, the same procedure is followed with\r\nthe remaining fingers. In the event the resultant inked prints are not\r\nsuitable, the skin should be scraped until it is sufficiently thin to\r\nbe flattened between two pieces of glass and photographed.\r\n\r\nHere again it is pointed out that should there be a poor contrast\r\nbetween the ridges and furrows when using direct lighting, the skin is\r\nscraped as thin as possible without tearing and it is then\r\nphotographed by transmitted light.\r\n\r\nThere are also included, as cases of desiccation, bodies which have\r\nbeen burned or subjected to severe heat. Often there are cases where\r\nthe skin has become loose but is hard and crisp, or where the finger\r\nhas been severely burned and is reduced almost to carbon, yet is firm.\r\nIn these instances the ridge detail usually has not been destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen a body which has been severely burned is located, the problems of\r\nidentification should be anticipated. Accordingly, before the body is\r\nremoved, a careful examination of the fingers should be made in order\r\nto determine if the removal would, in any way, cause damage to the\r\nfingers. Should it be felt that because of the condition of the body\r\nremoval would cause injury to the ridge detail, securing of\r\nfingerprints at the scene, or possibly the cutting off of the hands or\r\nfingers to avoid destruction of the skin, should be considered. An\r\nexamination of the fingers may disclose that the outer skin is\r\nhardened and is partially loosened from the flesh. It is sometimes\r\npossible, by twisting back and forth, to remove this outer skin\r\nintact. If this is done, the operator may place the skin on his own\r\nfinger, ink and print in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf the skin is intact on the finger and is not wrinkled, of course\r\nthere is no problem and the usual method is employed to secure\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nShould wrinkles be present and the skin pliable, tissue builder is\r\ninjected into the bulbs, which are then inked and printed.\r\n\r\nIn the event the wrinkles cannot be removed in this fashion, the\r\npattern area is cut off and the excess flesh scraped out as before.\r\nWhile the scraping and cutting are being accomplished, the skin should\r\nbe soaked and massaged in xylene to soften. The skin is then placed on\r\nthe operator's finger, inked and printed. Should prints made in this\r\nmanner be unsatisfactory, the next recourse is photography.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the fingers of burned bodies will be charred. Such\r\ncases require very careful handling as there is a probability of\r\ndestroying or disturbing the ridge detail through mistreatment. In\r\nthese instances the procedure is determined by the degree of charring.\r\nIn extreme cases the only method of recording is by photographing,\r\nusing side lighting to secure the proper contrast of ridges and\r\ndepressions. Obviously, no attempt should be made to ink and roll as\r\nthe pressure necessary to secure the prints would cause the skin to\r\ncrumble.\r\n\r\nIn instances where the charring has not reached the extreme stage the\r\nprocedures previously set forth should be applied; that is, treatment\r\nof the skin by cleaning, softening, inking and printing, or, finally,\r\nby photographing (fig. 400).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 400. Photograph of charts used in actual case to\r\nestablish the identity of a charred body, victim of murder. Chart A\r\nshows skin removed from one of the fingers treated and photographed.\r\nChart B shows an inked impression of the same finger during victim's\r\nlife.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water-soaked fingers_\r\n\r\nThe third and final type of case which may confront the identification\r\nofficer concerns the problem of maceration, that is, long immersion of\r\nthe fingers in water.\r\n\r\nOne of the cardinal rules for securing legible impressions is that the\r\nfingers must be dry. Accordingly, in these cases it becomes a matter\r\nof drying the fingers in addition to contending with other\r\ndifficulties. Usually the skin on the fingers absorbs water, swells\r\nand loosens from the flesh within a few hours after immersion.\r\n\r\nIf an examination discloses the skin to be water-soaked, wrinkled and\r\npliable, but intact, the first step is to cleanse the skin carefully\r\nas previously described. Next, wipe the fingertip with alcohol,\r\nbenzine or acetone, waiting a few seconds for it to dry. The skin is\r\npulled or drawn tight across the pattern area so that a large wrinkle\r\nis formed on the back of the finger, then the bulb is inked and\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nIf the skin is broken and hanging loose, but its pattern area is\r\nintact, it should be removed from the finger, cleansed and placed in\r\nalcohol or benzine (not acetone) for about a minute, then stretched\r\ncarefully over the operator's finger so as to remove any wrinkles. It\r\nmay then be printed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the skin is intact on the finger but so wrinkled and hard\r\nthat it is not possible to draw it tight for inking. In this case it\r\nmay be advisable to inject tissue builder to round out the bulbs for\r\ninking and printing. Should this fail, the ridge detail is\r\nphotographed on the finger; or the skin is cut off, flattened between\r\ntwo pieces of glass and then photographed. Here, again, it must be\r\npointed out that when the ridge detail does not show on the surface of\r\nthe outer skin the underside should be examined, for many times the\r\ndetail can be seen clearly. Should this be true, of course, the\r\nunderside is photographed.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is noted that the outer skin is gone and the finger\r\nis not saturated with water, it is possible to dry the surface\r\nsufficiently for inking and printing purposes by rolling the finger on\r\na blotter. If this fails, the finger is wiped off with a piece of\r\ncloth which has been saturated with alcohol, benzine or acetone, after\r\nwhich it may be inked and printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying the fingers_\r\n\r\nIn many instances it will be found that the outer skin is gone and the\r\nfingers themselves are saturated with water. A quick method of drying\r\nout the fingers is to place them in full strength acetone for\r\napproximately 30 minutes. The fingers are then placed in xylene for\r\nabout an hour or until the xylene has overcome the reaction of the\r\nacetone. After removal from the xylene the fingers should be placed on\r\na blotter until the surface of the fingers appears dry. They are then\r\nready to be inked and printed.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in this procedure that when the fingers are removed\r\nfrom the acetone they dry and harden in a matter of seconds. The\r\npurpose of the xylene is to resoften the fingers. After this\r\ntreatment, should the resulting inked impressions be unsuitable for\r\nclassification purposes, the ridge detail should be photographed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_X-ray photography_\r\n\r\nThe use of X-ray photographs (radiography) has been advocated by some\r\nfor purposes of recording the ridge details in decomposed, desiccated,\r\nor macerated cases. Briefly, the procedure involves the covering of\r\nthe fingers with heavy salts such as bismuth or lead carbonate, in a\r\nthin, even film over the pattern area and then, by the use of the\r\nX-ray, reproducing the ridge detail. This procedure necessitates the\r\nuse of X-ray equipment and a technician skilled in making radiographs.\r\nIt is, therefore, an expensive operation. The results of the\r\nradiograph in no way compensate for the expense, time, and skill\r\nrequired inasmuch as in those cases where many wrinkles and creases\r\nappear in the fingers, especially desiccated specimens, the results\r\nhave been very poor. In instances where there are no wrinkles or only\r\na few, and where the creases are not too deep, the ridge detail is\r\nreproduced very well in the radiograph. In these cases, however, it is\r\nusually possible to secure impressions by inking and rolling in the\r\nregular way or, should this fail, ordinary photography will certainly\r\ngive satisfactory results. For economical and practical purposes the\r\nuse of the X-ray is not recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General photography_\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing instances in which it has been impossible to obtain\r\nsuitable inked impressions it will be noted that the last resort has\r\nalways been photography. In all probability in advanced cases of\r\ndecomposition, desiccation, and maceration it may not be possible to\r\nsecure inked impressions which can be properly classified. Hence, it\r\nwill be necessary to photograph the ridge detail. Accordingly, there\r\nare outlined below several methods of photographing the ridges which\r\nhave been used with success.\r\n\r\nIn photographing the ridge detail on fingers it has been determined to\r\nbe most practicable to photograph the finger natural, or 1/1, size\r\ninasmuch as comparisons will usually be made with inked impressions\r\nwhich are natural size. Any camera built or adjusted to taking 1/1\r\nsize pictures, and with which the lighting may be arranged to best\r\nadvantage, may be used.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide choice of film which can be used for this purpose. The\r\nso-called soft films are all good for photographing ridge detail on\r\nfingers. Process film is not recommended inasmuch as the film presents\r\ntoo much of a contrast. Consequently, if it is used, some of the ridge\r\ndetail will be lost, especially if wrinkles are present in the skin.\r\n\r\nLighting is accomplished by the use of gooseneck lamps, floodlights,\r\nor a spotlight. If a fingerprint camera is used, its lights may be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nThe manner of lighting may be by direct light, side light, transmitted\r\nlight or reflected light, depending upon the prevailing condition of\r\nthe finger or skin.\r\n\r\nDirect light is used in those cases in which the ridge detail is\r\nfairly clear and there are no wrinkles present; or, if wrinkles are\r\npresent, they are not deep enough to interfere with photographing the\r\nridges.\r\n\r\nSide lighting is used when there are no wrinkles of any consequence\r\nand the ridge detail is clear but because of discoloration the ridges\r\nare not readily seen in the ground glass as there is lack of contrast\r\nbetween ridges and depressions. Accordingly, the lights, instead of\r\nbeing focused directly on the skin or finger, are placed to the side\r\nof the object so that the light is directed across the skin or finger,\r\nthus highlighting the ridges and shading the depressions.\r\n\r\nIn side lighting, two lights may be used. Better results are often\r\nobtained, however, by using only one light, such as a spotlight, the\r\nbeam of which can be controlled to best advantage.\r\n\r\nTransmitted light is used in cases in which the skin has peeled off or\r\nin which the dermis has been removed, cut, and scraped thin so that\r\nlight will go through. The prepared skin is placed between two pieces\r\nof glass pressed together in order to flatten the skin or dermis and\r\nremove creases. By trimming some of the surplus skin or dermis,\r\nespecially at the top, it may be more easily flattened. After the\r\nglass is properly mounted in front of the camera, the lights are\r\nplaced behind it and light is directed through the skin. The ridge\r\ndetail is brought into focus on the ground glass. Before the picture\r\nis actually taken it is suggested that the ground glass be checked by\r\nfirst using one light and then two lights to see which is more\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThere will be instances in which the second layer of skin, cut and\r\nscraped thin enough to flatten out, fails when dry to have a\r\nsufficient contrast between ridges and depressions for purposes of\r\nphotographing. The same piece of skin when soaked in xylene will show\r\na marked contrast, which it loses on drying. This difficulty is\r\novercome by photographing the skin while in solution, which can be\r\ndone by placing the skin in a test tube or a small bottle of a size to\r\nkeep the skin upright and the ridges toward the camera. The test tube\r\nor bottle is then filled with xylene.\r\n\r\nIf the skin is sufficiently thin, transmitted light may be used.\r\nShould it be found, however, that transmitted light is not effective,\r\nthen direct light may be tried and the results checked in the ground\r\nglass (fig. 401).\r\n\r\nWhen photographing a small curved surface such as a test tube, direct\r\nlighting will usually create a high light. If the high light as shown\r\nin the ground glass is over the ridge detail on the skin, a poor\r\nphotograph will result. If the high light cannot be removed by\r\nrearranging the lights, then reflected light should be tried.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect reflected light a large piece of white paper,\r\ncardboard, or similar material is used. A hole is cut in the center of\r\nthe paper or cardboard. This must be big enough for the camera lens to\r\nprotrude through. The ends of the paper or board are curved toward the\r\nskin or finger to be photographed. The lamps which are to be used are\r\nplaced facing the curved paper or cardboard in such fashion that the\r\nlight will strike the paper or board and be reflected by the curved\r\nsurface to the object.\r\n\r\nThe lamps should be close enough to the paper or board to give the\r\nmaximum light. Care should be exercised, however, not to place them\r\ntoo close, because of the fire hazard.\r\n\r\nAny arrangement of lamps and reflectors giving a similar effect as the\r\nabove should prove suitable.\r\n\r\nFingers or skin which have a mottled, reddish-brown color because of\r\ndecomposition, exposure to severe heat, or diffusion with blood\r\npresent a problem of lack of contrast between ridges and depressions\r\nfor photographic purposes. This lack of contrast can be overcome to a\r\nlarge extent by the use of a yellow or light red filter. Sometimes, in\r\nthose cases where the discoloration is due to the diffusion of blood\r\nthroughout the tissues, the blood can be washed out by saturating and\r\nrinsing the specimen in a 10- to 20-percent solution of citric acid.\r\nIf, of course, the blood is not removed satisfactorily, the\r\nphotographing should be done with the filter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 401]\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the fingerprint camera can be readily adapted to\r\nthe use of photographing fingers or skin specimens for ridge detail.\r\nSometimes it is possible to photograph the skin or finger in the same\r\nmanner as one does a latent print. There will be instances, however,\r\nin which the standard use of the fingerprint camera will not be\r\npossible or effective, such as for side light, reflected light, and\r\nsometimes transmitted light, or instances in which it is not possible\r\nto get the finger or skin flush with the opening of the camera. In\r\nthese instances the lights of the camera are not used, so the\r\nbatteries should be removed and gooseneck lamps or other suitable\r\nlighting equipment and ground glass utilized when the finger or skin\r\nis prepared for photographing (fig. 402).\r\n\r\nThe camera is opened either at the point where the lights are housed\r\nor at the lens point, whichever is most effective. Then, opening the\r\nshutter, the operator moves the camera either toward or away from the\r\nfinger or skin to the point where the ridge detail is sharpest in the\r\nground glass. The camera is held firmly, the ground glass is removed,\r\nthe film is inserted and the photograph taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 402]\r\n\r\nWith respect to exposure time, it is possible only to generalize and\r\npoint out that each case will have its own individual aspects.\r\nControlling features for consideration will be the type of film, the\r\ntype and size of lights, the method of lighting (direct, side,\r\ntransmitted or reflected) and also whether or not filters are used.\r\nAccordingly, there may be a wide variation of exposure time in\r\ndifferent cases.\r\n\r\nThe best approach for arriving at the proper exposure time is merely\r\nto make a test exposure, develop the film, and from an examination\r\ndetermine if it is underexposed or overexposed. Time the next exposure\r\naccordingly, until satisfactory results are obtained.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned previously, when photographing the ridges on\r\nfingers or skin, the ridge detail will be in reverse position, the\r\nopposite from an inked impression made from the same skin or finger.\r\n(This is true except in those cases in which the underside of the\r\nepidermis is photographed.) Accordingly, when the negative is\r\nprinted, it should be printed gloss side to sensitive side of paper to\r\ngive the position comparable to an inked print made from the same skin\r\nor finger. In order to avoid error or confusion a notation should be\r\nmade on the photograph of each finger, or, if they are cut and mounted\r\non a fingerprint card, point out that the position has been reversed\r\nand that the prints are in their correct position for classifying and\r\nsearching. Otherwise, it is possible that the right hand may be\r\nmistaken for the left hand and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIf the underside of the epidermis or outer skin is being photographed,\r\nthe negative should be printed in the normal manner, that is, emulsion\r\nside of negative to sensitized side of paper. Here, reversal of\r\nposition is not necessary for when the ridge detail is viewed from the\r\nunderside it appears to be in the same position as the inked\r\nimpression normally is reflected on a fingerprint card.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to see that each photograph is labeled correctly\r\nto indicate the finger it represents, such as right thumb, right\r\nindex, right ring, etc. It is imperative that no error occurs in such\r\nlabeling, inasmuch as it is highly probable that the resultant\r\nclassification would be incorrect and failure to make an\r\nidentification might very easily follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deceased infants_\r\n\r\nThe foregoing has dealt with the securing of fingerprints of unknown\r\ndeceased persons for identification purposes. The basis for such\r\naction is the presumptive possibility that the unknowns had been\r\nfingerprinted previously and through this medium might be identified.\r\n\r\nAnother type of problem, however, arises with the finding of a\r\ndeceased infant. It can be safely assumed that the possibility of\r\nthere being in existence a set of known fingerprints of the infant is\r\nextremely remote. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that many\r\nhospitals throughout the country, as part of the general routine of\r\nrecording a birth, secure the infant's footprints, it would follow\r\nthat there could be a remote possibility of identifying the deceased\r\ninfant through its footprints. The foregoing principles and procedures\r\nwould then apply in securing the foot impression of a deceased infant.\r\nIt is fully realized that in practically all cases involving the\r\nfinding of an abandoned infant corpse the infant is probably\r\nillegitimate issue and delivery did not occur in a hospital, but there\r\nhave been instances where such was not the case.\r\n\r\nThe importance of securing footprints of deceased infants killed in a\r\ncommon disaster cannot be overemphasized. Such disasters may involve\r\nthe death of infants of lawful issue, and in many instances there are\r\nhospital footprint records available which may prove of value as a\r\npositive means of identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technical consideration_\r\n\r\nThe methods described are intended to record, either by printing with\r\nink or by photographing as legibly as possible, the ridge details of\r\nthe tips of the fingers of unknown dead for identification purposes.\r\nThe securing of the impressions enables the fingerprint examiner to\r\nclassify and search them through a file. This \"search,\" of course,\r\nmeans merely to make a comparison of the deceased's prints with the\r\nprints of known individuals.\r\n\r\nIt is well to bear in mind the fact that the dermis or epidermis may\r\nhave undergone certain physical changes and that in order for the\r\nfingerprint examiner to make a proper comparison he must know the\r\nchanges which can and do occur. Otherwise, he may fail to make an\r\nidentification (fig. 403).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 403. Epidermis or outer layer of skin commencing to\r\npeel from dermis or second layer of skin, result of decomposition.]\r\n\r\nConsider first the epidermis or outer layer of skin in cases of\r\nmaceration (the skin is water soaked). There may be considerable\r\nswelling. The ridges become broader and are more distinct. An inked\r\nimpression in such an instance may show a pattern larger in area than\r\na print made from the same finger when the person was alive. Also, if\r\nthe skin is on the finger but is loose, inking and rolling could\r\ndistort the impression so that some of the ridge formations would seem\r\nto be in a different alignment from corresponding details in a print\r\nmade during life. When decomposition commences, what are really solid\r\nridges may be broken, giving rise to the possibility that there appear\r\nto be more characteristics than there actually are (figs. 404 and\r\n405).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 404. Inked fingerprint made during life.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 405. Inked impression of same finger of deceased\r\nshowing effect of decomposition.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of wrinkles may also cause the impression to acquire an\r\nappearance of dissimilarity when compared with the original inked\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nWith respect to cases of desiccation, there will probably be\r\nshrinkage, hence, the impressions made may appear smaller than in life\r\nand the ridges will be finer. In cases in which the epidermis has been\r\nlost and there remains only the dermis or second layer, there will\r\nusually be shrinkage with the same results. Here also, wrinkles, if\r\npresent, may cause a difference in appearance from the normal print.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 406]\r\n\r\nIn addition to shrinkage and wrinkles in cases involving the second\r\nlayer of skin, there is a radical change in the appearance of the\r\nridges themselves. The second or dermal layer of skin is composed of\r\nwhat are called dermal papillae which have the appearance of minute\r\nblunt pegs or nipples. The dermal papillae are arranged in double rows\r\n(fig. 406). Each double row lies deep in a ridge of the surface or\r\nepidermal layer and presents the same variations of ridge\r\ncharacteristics as are on the outer layer of skin except that they are\r\ndouble. Accordingly, when the second layer of skin is printed or\r\nphotographed, the ridge detail will appear in double. That is, the\r\nridges will appear as though they were split. This may well confuse\r\nthe fingerprint examiner in that what may be a loop having 10 ridge\r\ncounts may appear to be a loop having 20 ridge counts when the\r\nimpression is made from the second or dermal layer of skin. These\r\ndouble rows of ridges are finer and not as sharp as the detail on the\r\nouter skin, which adds to the difficulty of arriving at a correct\r\nclassification and making a proper comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FBI aid_\r\n\r\nThe above techniques and procedures have been dealt with upon the\r\nbasis that the law enforcement officers would, when a corpse has been\r\nfound, attempt to secure a set of finger impressions in an effort to\r\nidentify the unknown dead. If, however, the officer feels that the job\r\nis too difficult or is beyond his scope, consideration should be given\r\nto cutting off the hands or fingers of the deceased and forwarding\r\nthem to the Identification Division of the FBI for processing. If this\r\ncourse is decided upon, it is reiterated that local statutes governing\r\nthe cutting of the dead must be complied with and proper authorization\r\nmust be secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 407]\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the transmission of such specimens to the FBI\r\nthe following suggestions are made:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is deemed most desirable, when possible, to have both of the\r\nhands, severed at the wrist, forwarded in their entirety (fig. 407).\r\nIt is desired that the hands, rather than each separate finger, be\r\nsent inasmuch as it eliminates the possibility of getting the fingers\r\nmixed up or incorrectly labeled. If, however, it is not possible to\r\nsend the hands for some reason, then, of course, the fingers should be\r\ncut off and forwarded. In cutting, the fingers should be cut off at\r\nthe palm beginning with the right thumb, then the right index, ring,\r\netc., just as though they were to be printed. As soon as each finger\r\nis cut off it should be placed in an individual container, such as a\r\nsmall glass jar, and immediately marked as to which particular finger\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the hands or fingers of more than one dead are being\r\ntransmitted, it is absolutely necessary that not only the fingers be\r\nproperly labeled but that each body also be given an identifying\r\nnumber or symbol which must be indicated on the hands or fingers cut\r\nfrom that body as well, in order to avoid the embarrassing situation\r\nof identifying the hands and not knowing from which body they were\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nIn shipping, the hands, fingers, or skins may be placed in preserving\r\nsolutions such as 5-percent solution of formaldehyde, 5-percent\r\nsolution of alcohol, or embalming fluid. When hands or fingers are\r\ndesiccated (dried out), however, it is most desirable that they be\r\nplaced in airtight containers and sent without any preservative. If\r\nglass containers are used, the specimens should be packed in such a\r\nmanner as to avoid breakage. Dry ice is a suitable preservative for\r\ntransmitting such specimens but it should not be used when shipping\r\nwill take more than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIn making up a package using dry ice, the hands or fingers, properly\r\ntagged, should be placed in cellophane or paper bags. A material such\r\nas sawdust, shavings or similar packing which acts as an insulation is\r\nplaced around the specimens. A sufficient amount of dry ice is then\r\nplaced in the package which is then packed tight with more sawdust or\r\nshavings. The dry ice should not be in direct contact with the\r\ncellophane or paper bags which contain the hands or fingers.\r\n\r\nA letter covering transmittal of the specimens should be prepared in\r\nduplicate. It should, of course, indicate the sender. The names of any\r\nprobable victims, sex, race and approximate age of the deceased\r\nshould, if such information is available, be secured from the coroner\r\nor medical examiner and be included in the letter. A copy of the\r\nletter should be placed in the package. The original should be mailed\r\nseparately. Both letter and package should be addressed as follows:\r\n\r\n     DIRECTOR\r\n     FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\r\n     U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\r\n     WASHINGTON 25, D.C.\r\n\r\n     Attention: Identification Division--Latent Fingerprint Section.\r\n\r\nIf the package contains glass jars it should be marked \"Fragile\" to\r\ninsure careful handling in transit.\r\n\r\nThe package should be sent railway express, prepaid, or, where there\r\nis need for speed, by air express, prepaid. When they are received by\r\nthe Identification Division, the specimens will undergo various\r\ntreatments which may necessitate further cutting, scraping, etc. In\r\nall cases, regardless of condition, the specimens will be returned\r\nafter examination.\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing matter has dealt with instances in which it has\r\nbeen assumed that all ten fingers are available, or a sufficient\r\nnumber of the fingers of a deceased have been secured and impressions\r\nsuitable for searching through the fingerprint files of the FBI have\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\nThere will be cases, however, where only a few, or possibly only one,\r\nof the fingers has sufficient ridge detail for identification. In such\r\ninstances a search through the FBI files would be impractical. This,\r\nhowever, does not preclude the possibility of making a positive\r\nidentification by the use of the one finger. Though a search through\r\nthe file is not possible, a comparison can be made with the\r\nfingerprints of individuals who it is thought the deceased may be or,\r\nin some instances, with the fingerprints of missing persons.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, where one or only a few fingers are forwarded to\r\nthe FBI, the names of all possible victims should also be submitted.\r\nThe fingerprints of those individuals, if available, will then be\r\ntaken out of file and compared with the ridge detail on the finger of\r\nthe deceased in an endeavor to establish a positive identification.\r\nMany such identifications have been effected.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the usual services afforded authorized law\r\nenforcement agencies, the services of an FBI fingerprint expert are\r\nalso made available in those cases where expert testimony is necessary\r\nto establish the identity of the deceased through fingerprints,\r\nproviding, of course, such an identification has been made.\r\n\r\nExtreme caution should be exercised in the case of the chemicals\r\npreviously mentioned in this article. Acetone, alcohol, benzine, and\r\nxylene are highly inflammable and should neither be used near open\r\nflames nor while the operator is smoking. The fumes given off by\r\nacetone, benzine, xylene, and formaldehyde are toxic and may cause\r\nsickness. They should be used in a well-ventilated room only. It is\r\nalso suggested that the fingerprint examiner wear rubber gloves when\r\nusing acetone, benzine, xylene, formaldehyde, potassium hydroxide, or\r\nsodium hydroxide. These chemicals will cause the skin to peel. Strong\r\nconcentrations may cause burns.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is pointed out that the procedures and techniques\r\nwhich have been described are those currently being used by the\r\nfingerprint experts of the FBI. These methods are fast and the results\r\nhave been most satisfactory. This Bureau does not claim, however, that\r\nsatisfactory results cannot be achieved through variations thereof or\r\ndifferent methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Establishment of a Local Fingerprint Identification Bureau_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the information and assistance of officials who desire to\r\nestablish a local fingerprint identification bureau, the following\r\nsuggestions are being made to indicate the principal materials\r\nnecessary to equip such a bureau:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fingerprinting equipment_\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of taking fingerprints there should be a stand with a\r\nclamp for holding the fingerprint cards steady. This latter item is\r\nnecessary to prevent smudging the prints. A tube of printer's ink is\r\nused. The ink is applied by a roller to a glass plate upon which the\r\nfingers are inked before being rolled on the cards. The complete\r\nequipment for the above process may be secured from a number of\r\ncommercial sources or it can be made. Figure 408 depicts an inking\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fingerprint files_\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the fingerprint card be white, light cardboard, 8\r\nby 8 inches, slightly glazed. This size is convenient, as it allows\r\nall the space necessary for recording the classification of the prints\r\nand general descriptive information concerning the individual. In the\r\nevent the new bureau desires to contribute copies of its fingerprints\r\nto the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the latter will, upon request,\r\ngladly furnish fingerprint cards for the purpose together with\r\nenvelopes and instructions on how to take fingerprints. It is\r\nsuggested that the new bureau design its cards similar to those\r\nfurnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as these have been\r\ndesigned after special study and have been found to be satisfactory\r\nover a long period of time. Figures 409 and 410 show the fingerprint\r\nside and reverse side of the criminal fingerprint card used by the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nIn classifying and comparing fingerprints it is necessary to use a\r\nmagnifying or fingerprint glass. Such instruments can be obtained from\r\nvarious commercial sources. Figure 411 shows the type of magnifying\r\nglass used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 408. Diagram of a FINGERPRINT INKING STAND]\r\n\r\nThe fingerprint cards should be filed according to fingerprint\r\nclassification sequence in cabinets, preferably steel. It is further\r\nsuggested that the cabinets be three drawers high, with each drawer\r\ndivided into three rows for filing. Such cabinets or similar ones can\r\nbe obtained from various commercial sources. Figure 412 shows the type\r\nof fingerprint cabinet used in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the location of classification groups, it is\r\nsuggested that guide cards be placed in the rows of fingerprint cards\r\nat frequent intervals. These guide cards should be slightly longer\r\nand heavier than the fingerprint cards and should have small tabs on\r\nthe top to hold classification identifying symbols. Figure 413 shows\r\nthe type of guide card used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 409]\r\n\r\nLEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK   |TYPE OR PRINT                     |SEX     |RACE\r\n                         |                                  |        |\r\n                         |LAST NAME  FIRST NAME  MIDDLE NAME|--------|-----\r\n                         |                                  |HT.     |WT.\r\n                         |                                  |(Inches)|\r\n                         |                                  |        |\r\n                         |----------------------------------|--------|-----\r\n                         |CONTRIBUTOR AND |ALIASES          |HAIR    |EYES\r\n                         |ADDRESS         |                 |        |\r\n                         |                |                 |--------------\r\n-------------------------|                |                 |DATE OF BIRTH\r\nSIGNATURE OF PERSON      |                |                 |\r\nFINGERPRINTED            |                |                 |--------------\r\n                         |                |                 |PLACE OF BIRTH\r\n                         |                |                 |\r\n                         |-------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------|YOUR NUMBER       |LEAVE THIS SPACE BLANK\r\nSCARS AND   |AMPUTATION  |                  |\r\nMARKS       |            |------------------|CLASS\r\n            |            |PLACE FBI NUMBER  |     -------------------------\r\n-------------------------|HERE              |\r\nSIGNATURE OF        DATE |------------------|REF.\r\nOFFICIAL TAKING          | _  CHECK IF NO   |    --------------------------\r\nFINGERPRINTS             ||_| REPLY         |\r\n                         |    IS DESIRED    |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n1.

This substitute card,\r\nor \"charge-out\" card, is of a different color from the fingerprint\r\ncard and slightly longer. On it are recorded the name, the\r\nclassification formula, and peculiar characteristics, such as scars\r\nand peculiar pattern formations, appearing on the original card. By\r\nindicating the date and reason for charging out the original card, the\r\nBureau is able to keep an accurate check on the whereabouts of all\r\nprints at all times. It is suggested that the local bureaus adopt a\r\npractice of this kind whenever a fingerprint card is drawn from the\r\nfiles and it is known that it may be out for a period of time longer\r\nthan the remainder of the day on which it is drawn. Figure 414 shows\r\nthe type of charge-out card used in the FBI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 410]\r\n\r\n  FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\r\n                           WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                       CURRENT ARREST OR RECEIPT\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n DATE ARRESTED |     CHARGE OR OFFENCE     |DISPOSITION OF SENTENCE\r\n  OR RECEIVED  |(If code citation is used  |(List final disposition only.\r\n               |it should be accompanied by|If not now available\r\n               |charge)                    |submit later on FBI Form R-54\r\n               |                           |for completion of record.)\r\n               |                           |\r\n               |                           |\r\n---------------|---------------------------|\r\nOCCUPATION     |RESIDENCE OF PERSON        |\r\n               |FINGERPRINTED              |\r\n               |                           |\r\n-------------------------------------------|\r\nIf COLLECT wire reply or COLLECT telephone |\r\nreply is desired, indicate here            |\r\n _                    _                    |\r\n|_| Wire reply       |_| Telephone reply   |\r\n                                           |   FOR INSTITUTIONS USE ONLY\r\n                         ----------------  |\r\n                         Telephone number  |  Sentence expires____________\r\n-------------------------------------------|------------------------------\r\n                                           |          INSTRUCTIONS\r\n                                           |1.

In order to\r\nfacilitate work of this nature, as well as to keep a complete record\r\nand check on each set of fingerprints, it is necessary that the files\r\nbe indexed in a manner similar to that in which books in a library are\r\nindexed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 411]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 412]\r\n\r\nIn this connection, for each fingerprint card there is prepared an\r\nindex card. On this the name of the individual is placed, with all\r\nknown aliases, the fingerprint classification formula, the police or\r\narrest number, the date of arrest or other action. It is desirable,\r\nalso, to have on this card such general information as age, height,\r\nweight and race.

Figure 418 shows a charge-out card.\r\n\r\nTo supplant the 3- by 5-inch index cards mentioned above, many law\r\nenforcement agencies have found it desirable to use a separate sheet,\r\nsometimes referred to as a \"History Sheet\" or \"Information Sheet,\"\r\ncontaining the complete case history of the subject involved. These\r\nseparate sheets can be filed by fingerprint number sequence and\r\ncontain not only the data such as the known aliases, the fingerprint\r\nclassification formula, the arrest number, and other essential items\r\nwhich are set out on the 3- by 5-inch cards as heretofore described,\r\nbut also contain a concise summary of the subject's arrest history,\r\nparticularly with reference to his criminal activities in the\r\nparticular city. They may also contain a summarized case history with\r\nrespect to each arrest or commitment, including such items as the date\r\nand place of arrest, complete home address, relatives, the essential\r\nfacts concerning the prosecution of charges, and the ultimate\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 417]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jacket folder file_\r\n\r\nWhen an identification bureau receives prints of individuals on whom\r\nit already has prints, it is not practical to keep more than one set\r\nof prints per person in what may be called the active fingerprint\r\nfile. In these instances the better print should be designated a\r\n\"Master\" print by having the word \"Master\" stamped thereon. It should\r\nbe given a number, to be known as the master number, which number\r\nshould also be placed on all other sets of prints which may be found\r\nto be identical with the \"Master\" print. The \"Master\" print is placed\r\nin the active files. The extra prints are placed together in a heavy\r\nfolder with their master number stamped thereon. This jacket folder is\r\nthen filed in a separate cabinet. Also, if copies of all information\r\nregarding an individual, photographs, and FBI transcript of record are\r\nkept in this folder, his complete record will always be assembled in\r\nan easily accessible unit. The \"Master\" number should also be placed\r\non the index card and all the alias cards of the individual. Also,\r\neach new alias and arrest number should be placed on the original\r\nindex card. The additional records are kept in folders which are\r\narranged in numerical order, beginning with Nos. 1, 2, 3, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 418]\r\n\r\n1-154                    |-----------|           |     GPO: 1962 OF--663475\r\n                         |           |           |\r\n                         |-----------|           |-------------------------\r\n                         |           |           |          POSTING\r\n                         |-----------|           |-------------------------\r\n                         |           |           |\r\n                         |           |           |DOB\r\n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------\r\n                         |  ASSEMBLY |   MISC.   |        DESCRIPTION\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n     NAME_____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n            __________________________________________________\r\n\r\n                 NAME______________________________________________\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n   (ARREST NUMBER)      (DEPARTMENT)             (CITY)          (STATE)\r\n\r\nA further suggestion in connection with the maintenance of this folder\r\nfile, besides the use of a separate \"Master\" numbering system, is the\r\nuse of the arrest fingerprint number. As indicated previously, each\r\nperson arrested and fingerprinted is assigned a number. This number\r\nappears on the fingerprint card, name-index card, and photograph. The\r\npractice of handling every new arrest fingerprint card in the bureau\r\nshould include searching the fingerprint card in the fingerprint file\r\nto ascertain if the subject has a previous record. If the subject does\r\nnot have a previous record, a new number should be assigned. In this\r\nconnection it is noted that only one copy of the fingerprint card\r\nshould be maintained in the file by fingerprint classification. To\r\nindicate the new arrest on the old index card, the date of the new\r\narrest can be shown. Whether the bureau follows the \"Master\" numbering\r\nsystem or the \"previous arrest\" numbering system should make very\r\nlittle difference in the ultimate purpose. All extra copies of\r\nfingerprint cards, complete record sheets, photographs, and all\r\ninformation pertaining to the individual are filed away in the folder\r\nfile. This complete record is readily accessible at all times. It will\r\nnow be found that the bureau has a complete record of each individual\r\nwho has an arrest record on file, with provision made for accurate\r\ncross-referencing and checking between names and fingerprints.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dispositions_\r\n\r\nIt is important to the bureau to have complete information concerning\r\nthe ultimate disposition on each arrest fingerprint card. If the\r\ndisposition of a charge is known at the time the person is\r\nfingerprinted, this fact should be indicated in the space provided on\r\nthe fingerprint card. For example, in the case of an individual who is\r\narrested, fingerprinted, and turned over to the county jail, this\r\ndisposition can be indicated on the fingerprint card which is\r\nforwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The fingerprint card\r\nshould not be held by the bureau pending final disposition of the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the disposition is pending prosecutive or court\r\naction, a separate 3- by 5-inch disposition file can be maintained. On\r\nthese cards information concerning the name, fingerprint number, race,\r\nsex, charge, name of the arresting officers, and the fingerprint\r\nclassification should appear. These cards are filed in a\r\npending-disposition file. The 3- by 5-inch disposition cards are made\r\nat the time the fingerprints of the person are taken. When the final\r\ndisposition is obtained it should be noted on the card. In those cases\r\nwhere there is only one fingerprint card in the bureau, the\r\ndisposition can be noted on the name-index card or the reverse side of\r\nthe bureau's fingerprint card. In those cases where there is a\r\njacket-folder file for the individual this disposition card can then\r\nbe placed in the folder.\r\n\r\n\"Disposition Sheets\" (No. R-84) can be obtained from the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation for forwarding this information so that the\r\nfiles of the FBI will have complete information concerning the\r\narrests. At the time the final disposition is obtained, these\r\ndisposition sheets can be completed and forwarded to the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death notices_\r\n\r\nWhen persons whose fingerprints are on file are reported as deceased,\r\nthe prints should be taken from the active file and assembled with\r\nany other prints of the person concerned. These should be plainly\r\nmarked \"Dead\" and filed in a separate cabinet or section. All the\r\nindex cards on this individual should also be marked \"Dead\" and filed\r\nin a separate section. These should be retained for possible future\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, \"Death Notice\" forms (No. R-88) can be obtained\r\nfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation so that information\r\nconcerning these deaths can be properly noted in its fingerprint file.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Record of additional arrest_\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for a bureau to send a regular fingerprint card to\r\nthe Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on\r\nindividuals who have been arrested repeatedly and whose previous\r\nrecords are known to the local law enforcement agency. In such cases\r\nthe \"Record of Additional Arrest\" form should be used.\r\n\r\nComplete information must be given on this form. It is imperative that\r\nthe FBI number and the finger impressions be placed on this form. The\r\nIdentification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will\r\nsend no answer upon receipt of this form.\r\n\r\nThe form will be placed in the FBI number folder on the individual and\r\nlater when a regular fingerprint card is received the arrest\r\ninformation from all the forms will be compiled and included on the\r\nsubject's record as \"supported by fingerprints.\"\r\n\r\n\"Record of Additional Arrest\" forms (No. 1-1) can be obtained from the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wanted notices_\r\n\r\nAll wanted notices containing fingerprints, including the wanted\r\nnotices inserted in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, should be filed\r\nin the fingerprint file by classification formula, and the names\r\nappearing on these wanted notices should be indexed and placed in the\r\nname files. Concerning the small wanted notices inserted in the FBI\r\nLaw Enforcement Bulletin, a suggested procedure would be to paste each\r\nindividual notice on a blank 8- by 8-inch white card. The wanted\r\nnotices are filed by the fingerprint classification and the names\r\nindexed and placed in the name file. When an apprehension notice is\r\nreceived concerning the wanted notice, a proper notation should be\r\nmade on the name card and the wanted notice in the fingerprint file.\r\nIf these canceled wanted notices endanger the efficiency of the file,\r\nit is suggested that the name-index card and the fingerprint-wanted\r\nnotice be destroyed. Should the bureau adopt this practice it is\r\nsuggested that the 8- by 8-inch cards be used again for other wanted\r\nnotices. In this manner it would be possible to use the blank card for\r\neight of these notices.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation will make available to law\r\nenforcement agencies a special \"Wanted Notice\" form (No. 1-12) in\r\norder that they can place wanted notices against the fingerprints in\r\nthe files of the FBI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Photographs_\r\n\r\nArrangements should be made to procure a camera for taking photographs\r\nof the persons fingerprinted. This is known as a \"mugging\" camera and\r\nvarious types are on the market. It is believed that the photographs\r\nshould include a front and side view of the person. In most instances\r\na scale for indicating height can be made a part of the picture even\r\nthough only the upper portion of the individual photographed is taken.\r\nOf course, if the scale is used, the person photographed should be\r\nstanding even though only the upper portion of the body appears in the\r\nphotograph. The necessary lights should be provided for obtaining\r\nphotographs. A standard set of scales should be obtained in order that\r\nthe correct weight can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 419]\r\n\r\nThe negatives and photographs can be filed by fingerprint number in a\r\nseparate file. In those cases where the individual has more than one\r\narrest all the photographs can be placed in the jacket-folder number\r\nfile. The negatives, in these instances, can remain in the photograph\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Latent fingerprints_\r\n\r\nTo adequately develop the latent prints at crime scenes, it is\r\nnecessary that the proper equipment be provided. This equipment\r\nincludes latent fingerprint powders, brushes, lifting tape,\r\nfingerprint camera, searchlight, and scissors. All of this equipment\r\ncan be obtained from commercial fingerprint supply companies. Figure\r\n419 shows some of the equipment used by the FBI. The techniques of\r\ndeveloping latent fingerprints and their uses are more fully explained\r\nin the following chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that by following the basic ideas outlined, the\r\nofficials of law enforcement agencies can be assured of best results\r\nin establishing and maintaining a small identification bureau. For\r\nfurther information, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will furnish\r\nto duly constituted law enforcement officials any additional data\r\nwhich may be of material assistance in the maintenance of such a\r\nbureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_Latent Impressions_\r\n\r\n\r\nEach ridge of the fingers, palms, and soles bears a row of sweat pores\r\nwhich in the average person constantly exude perspiration. Also, the\r\nridges of the fingers and palms are in intermittent contact with other\r\nparts of the body, such as the hair and face, and with various\r\nobjects, which may leave a film of grease or moisture on the ridges.\r\nIn touching an object, the film of moisture and/or grease may be\r\ntransferred to the object, thus leaving an outline of the ridges of\r\nthe fingers or palm thereon. This print is called a latent impression,\r\nthe word \"latent\" meaning hidden, that is, the print many times is not\r\nreadily visible.\r\n\r\nLatent impressions, regardless of the area of the ridges present, are\r\nof the greatest importance to the criminal investigator as\r\nidentification of them may solve the crime and result in successful\r\nprosecution of the subject. Consequently, every effort should be made\r\nto preserve and _identify_ them.\r\n\r\nVisible prints in mediums such as blood, grease, dirt, or dust are\r\nequally important to the investigator but, strictly speaking, are not\r\nlatent impressions.\r\n\r\nA search of the crime scene should be conducted in a logical manner.\r\nPoints of entry and exit should be examined, along with surfaces or\r\nobjects disturbed or likely touched during the commission of the\r\ncrime. The examiner should wear a pair of light cloth gloves and\r\nhandle an object only insofar as is necessary and then only by edges\r\nor surfaces which are not receptive to latent impressions. A record of\r\nthe exact location of a print on an object and of the object itself\r\nshould be made, since these facts may be of the utmost importance in\r\nany trial resulting from the investigation. No one should handle an\r\nobject other than the examiner himself.\r\n\r\nPortable articles removed should be labeled or marked so that they may\r\nbe readily identified thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe beam of a flashlight played over the surface of an object will\r\nfrequently show the location of latent impressions, although this is\r\nnot an infallible test for their presence.\r\n\r\nEvidence should be examined as soon as feasible after its discovery.\r\n\r\nFollowing the location of any latent prints at the scene of a crime,\r\nthe prints of all persons whose presence at the place under inspection\r\nhas been for legitimate purposes must be excluded from further\r\nattention. It is advisable, therefore, during the initial stages of an\r\ninvestigation where latent prints are found, to secure the inked\r\nprints of all members of the household, the employees, and any police\r\nor other officials who may have touched the objects on which the\r\nlatent impressions were found. Inked prints taken for this purpose are\r\nreferred to as elimination prints.\r\n\r\nDue to the fragmentary nature of most latent prints it is not possible\r\nto derive a classification which makes a file search practicable. A\r\nlatent impression may be identified, however, by comparison with the\r\nprints of a particular suspect.\r\n\r\nInked fingerprints taken for comparison with latent impressions should\r\nbe as legible and as complete as possible, including the areas not\r\nessential to classification, since identifications are often made with\r\nthese areas. Inked palm prints taken should likewise be complete and\r\nclear and should include impressions of the finger joints. Persons not\r\nexperienced in latent print comparisons should not attempt to evaluate\r\nlatent fragments, since the area necessary for an identification may\r\nbe extremely small compared to that of an average inked fingerprint.\r\n\r\nArticles which are to be transported by mail or express should be so\r\npacked that the surfaces bearing latent impressions are not in contact\r\nwith other surfaces. This may be accomplished by mounting the articles\r\non a piece of fiber board or plywood. The board should then be secured\r\nin a box so that the objects will not touch or be shaken against the\r\nsides in transit. The package should be plainly marked \"Evidence,\" to\r\nprevent inadvertent handling on opening. Cotton or cloth should never\r\nbe placed in direct contact with any surface bearing latent prints.\r\n\r\nAny number of paper or cardboard specimens may be placed in a single\r\nprotective wrapper, since contact with other surfaces does not harm\r\nlatents on such objects. Lifts, negatives and photographs are readily\r\nenclosed with letters.\r\n\r\nAn explanatory letter should accompany all evidence. If it is\r\nnecessary to pack the evidence separately, a copy of the letter should\r\nbe placed in every package so that the recipient will know immediately\r\nthe import of the contents. All items of evidence should be marked and\r\ndescribed exactly in the accompanying letter so that they will not be\r\nconfused with packing material of a similar nature, and to provide a\r\ncheck on what the package should contain.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the letter should include for record purposes a brief\r\noutline of the crime, i.e., type, date and place of occurrence, and\r\nnames of victims and subjects. If suspects are named for comparison,\r\nsufficient descriptive data should be set out to permit location of\r\ntheir fingerprint records. This information, in preferential order,\r\ncomprises the individual's complete name, aliases, FBI number, date of\r\nprior arrest or fingerprinting, fingerprint classification, date and\r\nplace of birth, and physical description.\r\n\r\nEvidence is preferably forwarded by registered mail or railway\r\nexpress, as these means provide records of dispatch and receipt.\r\n\r\nElimination or suspect fingerprints are best enclosed with the\r\nevidence itself, with a notation as to the type of prints forwarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_Powdering and Lifting Latent Impressions_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose in \"developing\" a latent impression is to make it\r\nvisible so that it may be preserved and compared. Various powders and\r\nchemicals are used for this purpose. When a latent print is plainly\r\nvisible, it should be photographed before any effort is made to\r\ndevelop it.\r\n\r\nNo attempt should be made to brush or apply powder to prints in dust,\r\nobviously greasy prints, or bloody prints, as this will almost surely\r\ndestroy them. Objects which have been wet or immersed in water may\r\nstill bear identifiable latent impressions. Before any examination is\r\nattempted, however, the object must be dried.\r\n\r\nPowder brushed lightly over a latent-bearing surface will cling to\r\ngrease or moisture in the ridges of a latent print, making it visible\r\nagainst the background. Obviously, a powder should be used which will\r\ncontrast with the color of the surface. Photographic contrasts should\r\nalso be considered.\r\n\r\nA gray powder and a black powder are adequate for latent print work.\r\nMany fingerprint powders of various colors and compositions are\r\navailable from fingerprint supply houses but none are superior to the\r\ngray and black.\r\n\r\nA very small amount of powder is placed on the brush for application\r\nto the surface. Once the contour of a print is visible, the brush\r\nstrokes should conform to the direction of the ridges. All excess\r\npowder should be brushed from between the ridges. Too much powder and\r\ntoo little brushing are the chief faults of beginners.\r\n\r\nGray powder is used on dark-colored surfaces. It is also used on\r\nmirrors and metal surfaces which have been polished to a mirrorlike\r\nfinish, since these surfaces will photograph black with the\r\nfingerprint camera.\r\n\r\nBlack powder should be applied to white or light-colored surfaces.\r\n\r\nAluminum powder affords the same contrast as the gray. Gold and red\r\nbronze powders, although of a glittering appearance, will photograph\r\ndark and should consequently be used on light-colored surfaces.\r\nDragon's blood powder is a photographically neutral powder and may be\r\ndusted on either a light or dark surface.\r\n\r\nOn clear transparent glass, either gray or black powder may be used,\r\nit being necessary only to use a contrasting black or white background\r\nwhen photographing.\r\n\r\nPrints should be lifted after photographing. Both rubber and\r\ntransparent tape are available for this purpose. Rubber lifting tape\r\nis procurable in black or white 4\" x 9\" sheets and has the adhesive\r\nsurface protected with a celluloid cover. A black powder print should\r\nobviously be lifted on white tape and a gray powder print on black\r\ntape.\r\n\r\nGold bronze and red bronze powders should be lifted on white tape,\r\naluminum on black. Dragon's blood may be lifted on either black or\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nAfter cutting a piece of tape sufficiently large to cover the entire\r\nlatent print, the celluloid covering is removed and the adhesive side\r\napplied to the latent. The tape should be pressed evenly and firmly to\r\nthe surface, taking care not to shift its position. It is then peeled\r\ngently from the surface and the piece of celluloid placed over the\r\nprint to protect it. The operator should handle the lift in such a\r\nmanner that he will leave no prints of his own on the adhesive\r\nsurface. A small paper identification tag bearing the initials of the\r\noperator, date, and object from which lifted should be placed under\r\none corner of the celluloid, or this information may be written on the\r\nback of the lift itself if it can be done in a permanent, legible\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIf an excessive amount of powder adheres to the latent print, a more\r\nlegible print may sometimes be obtained by lifting a second time (on a\r\nnew piece of tape, of course).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that a print lifted on rubber tape is in a reverse\r\nposition. Consequently, in preparing a photograph of a print on such a\r\nlift, it will be necessary to print the negative from the reverse side\r\nin order for the print to appear in its correct position for\r\ncomparison. Preparation of such photographs should not be attempted by\r\npersons of inadequate knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nTransparent tape with a durable adhesive surface is available in 1\" to\r\n2\" widths for fingerprint work. The common variety of transparent tape\r\nis not suitable due to the deterioration (drying) of the adhesive\r\nsurface. The print on a piece of transparent tape is in correct\r\nposition. Transparent lifts should be affixed to a smooth, grainless,\r\nopaque background of a black or white color contrasting with the\r\npowder used. Every effort should be made to avoid air bubbles under\r\nsuch lifts. In no instance should a transparent lift ever be folded\r\nback on itself or stuck to another piece of such tape as a backing,\r\nsince it is generally not possible to determine the correct position\r\nof such a print.\r\n\r\nGroups of latent impressions, such as those of adjacent fingers or\r\nfingers and palms which appear to have been made simultaneously,\r\nshould be lifted as units, that is, on a single piece of tape, as this\r\nmay facilitate the task of making comparisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_Chemical Development of Latent Impressions_\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical treatment in the development of latent finger impressions on\r\npaper, cardboard, and newly finished or unpainted wood may involve a\r\nslightly more complicated technique than that in which powders are\r\nutilized, but the results justify the additional effort.\r\n\r\nIt is very strongly recommended that powders not be applied to\r\narticles of the above types. This recommendation is made for several\r\nreasons. First, powders cannot be removed from paper and possibly may\r\ninterfere with some types of document examinations. In this\r\nconnection, they are likely to prevent restoration of the specimen to\r\na legible condition. Powders will not develop as many latent\r\nimpressions as chemicals on paper or cardboard. In some cases they\r\nwill obscure latent impressions subsequently developed chemically.\r\n\r\nNeither scientific training nor complete knowledge of the chemical\r\nprocesses involved is necessary for one to become proficient in the\r\nuse of chemical developers, two of which will be discussed more fully.\r\nThese two, iodine and silver nitrate, are the most commonly used,\r\ninasmuch as they are relatively inexpensive, readily procurable,\r\neffective, and easy to apply.\r\n\r\nAll specimens which are treated should be handled with tweezers or\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nWhen iodine crystals are subjected to a slight amount of heat they\r\nvaporize rapidly, producing violet fumes. These fumes are absorbed by\r\nfatty or oily matter with which they come in contact. If the specimen\r\ntreated bears latent impressions which contain oil or fat, the print\r\nis developed or made visible by the absorption of the iodine fumes and\r\nthe ridges of the print appear yellowish-brown against the background.\r\n\r\nIodine prints are not permanent and begin to fade once the fuming is\r\nstopped. It is necessary, therefore, for the operator to have a camera\r\nready to photograph the prints immediately.\r\n\r\nControl of the fumes is achieved by using the crystals in an iodine\r\ngun or fuming cabinet. The iodine gun may be assembled by the\r\nindividual examiner, by a druggist, or it may be purchased through a\r\nfingerprint supply house.\r\n\r\nMaterial for making the iodine gun, as well as iodine crystals, may be\r\nprocured from a chemical supply house or through a druggist. The gun\r\nitself consists essentially of two parts. One tube (the end of the gun\r\nthrough which the breath is blown) contains a drying agent such as\r\ncalcium chloride, to remove moisture from the breath. Without this,\r\nthe moisture from the breath and saliva would condense at the end of\r\nthe gun, drip onto the specimen and cause stains which might prove\r\nindelible. The second tube contains a small amount of iodine crystals\r\nwhich are vaporized by the heat of the breath, augmented by the warmth\r\nof the hand cupped around the tube containing the iodine. This vapor\r\nis blown onto the specimen (fig. 420). Glass wool serves to hold the\r\ncalcium chloride and iodine in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 420. Iodine fuming gun in use.]\r\n\r\nDue to the amount of physical exertion involved, the gun is generally\r\nlimited to the examination of a few small specimens. Where a large\r\nnumber of specimens are to be treated, the fuming cabinet, a\r\nbox-shaped wooden receptacle with a glass front and top permitting the\r\noperator to control the amount of fumes in the cabinet and observe the\r\ndevelopment of the latent impressions, is used (fig. 421). The fumes\r\nare generated by placing a small alcohol burner under an evaporating\r\ndish containing the iodine crystals. This is set in a hole cut in the\r\nbottom of the cabinet. As soon as the fumes begin to appear in\r\nsufficient amounts, the burner is removed. The specimens may be hung\r\nin the cabinet by wooden clothes pins fastened to a removable stick\r\nwhich is supported by wooden strips affixed near the top edges of the\r\ncabinet. The top of the cabinet is removable to permit access.\r\nDiagrams for the construction of the iodine gun or fuming cabinet will\r\nbe furnished on request to members of the law enforcement profession.\r\n\r\nMany specimens bear small, greasy areas which, in addition to any\r\nlatent impressions of a greasy nature, will also appear\r\nyellowish-brown after exposure to iodine fumes. All these stains will\r\neventually disappear if the specimen is placed in a current of air\r\nfrom a fan or vent. All latent impressions on an object will not be\r\ndeveloped by the iodine process but only those containing fat or oil.\r\nDue to this fact and the fact that iodine evaporates from the surface,\r\nit is used prior to (it cannot be used afterward), and in conjunction\r\nwith, the silver nitrate process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 421. Iodine fuming cabinet in use.]\r\n\r\nNo ill effects have been noted from contact with small amounts of\r\niodine vapor but prolonged or excessive contact will produce\r\nirritation of the skin and respiratory passages. To prevent gradual\r\nloss of the chemical through evaporation and the corrosion of\r\nsurrounding metal surfaces, iodine crystals should be kept in an\r\nairtight container when not being used.\r\n\r\nThe development of latent impressions with silver nitrate is dependent\r\non the fact that the sodium chloride (the same substance as common\r\ntable salt) present in the perspiration which forms the ridges in most\r\nlatent impressions reacts with the silver nitrate solution to form\r\nsilver chloride. Silver chloride is white but is unstable on exposure\r\nto light and breaks down into its components, silver and chlorine. The\r\nridges of the fingerprints developed in this manner appear\r\nreddish-brown against the background. Immersion in the silver nitrate\r\nsolution will wash traces of fat and oil from the paper;\r\nconsequently, it is necessary to fume the specimen for latents of such\r\na nature prior to treatment with silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nOnce the requisite equipment is assembled, the steps in the process\r\nare these:\r\n\r\nDip the specimen in the solution, blot and dry it, expose to light,\r\nand photograph latents when contrast is good.\r\n\r\nChemically standardized solutions are not required for the successful\r\napplication of this process. It has been determined through long\r\npractice that a 3-percent solution of silver nitrate is adequate for\r\nthe purpose, although concentrations up to 10 percent are sometimes\r\nused. A solution of approximately 3 percent may be prepared by\r\ndissolving 4 ounces of silver nitrate in 1 gallon of distilled water.\r\nSmaller quantities of 3-percent solution are made by using the\r\ncomponents in the same proportion. For instance, one quart of water\r\nwill require 1 ounce of the crystals. For a 10-percent solution, use\r\n13-1/3 ounces of crystals per gallon.\r\n\r\nAn alcohol solution may be preferred. This is prepared by mixing 4\r\nounces of silver nitrate crystals, 4 ounces of distilled water, and 1\r\ngallon of grain alcohol, 190 proof. The alcoholic solution dries\r\nfaster, and when treating paper bearing writing in ink, it is less\r\nlikely to cause the ink to run. On the other hand, the alcoholic\r\nsolution is much more expensive and there is some loss by evaporation\r\nwhile in use.\r\n\r\nThe solutions may be used several times before losing their strength\r\nand when not in use should be kept in brown bottles in cupboards to\r\nretard deterioration. If the strength of the solution is doubtful, the\r\noperator should attempt to develop test latent impressions before\r\nproceeding on evidence.\r\n\r\nSilver nitrate crystals and distilled water in small amounts are\r\nobtainable from druggists or in large amounts from chemical supply\r\nhouses. Dealers in distilled water are located in many communities.\r\n\r\nTap water should not be used in the preparation of the solution\r\nbecause it generally contains chemicals which will partially\r\nneutralize the silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the solution be placed in a glass or enamelware\r\ntray approximately 18 by 12 by 5 inches for use, a size used in\r\nphotographic development. Treatment with this solution is called\r\n\"silvering.\" The specimen is immersed in the solution so that the\r\nsurfaces are completely moistened, then taken out, placed between\r\nblotters to remove the excess solution, and dried. The drying is\r\nreadily accomplished with an electric hair dryer. Blotters may be\r\ndried and used several times before discarding. It is not necessary to\r\nwork in a dark room. Work in an illuminated room but not in direct\r\nsunlight. Soaking the specimen in the solution does not aid\r\ndevelopment and is actually undesirable as it requires a longer drying\r\ntime. The specimen should be reasonably dry before exposing to the\r\nlight, otherwise the latent prints may be developed while the paper\r\nis still wet, thus necessitating drying in subdued light to prevent\r\ndarkening.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the latent impressions occurs rapidly when the specimen\r\nis exposed to a blue or violet light source. A 1,000-watt blue or\r\ndaylight photographer's lamp, a mercury arc (most ultraviolet lamps\r\nare of this type), or carbon arc is excellent for the purpose (fig.\r\n422). If a weaker light is used, a stronger mixture of the solution\r\nshould be prepared. For instance, if a 300-watt bulb is used, the\r\n10-percent solution would be preferable. Direct sunlight will cause\r\nthe latent impressions to appear very rapidly and if several specimens\r\nare exposed at once it is not possible for a single operator to\r\nproperly control the development. Sunlight coming through a window\r\npane will serve for development. Where fingerprints containing sodium\r\nchloride (normally exuded from the sweat pores in the ridges) have\r\nbeen deposited, the silver chloride formed will darken against the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 422. Developing silver nitrate prints using 1,000-watt\r\nbulb reflector.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ridge detail of the prints is clearly visible, the\r\npaper should be removed from the light. Continued exposure will darken\r\nthe paper and the contrast will be lost.\r\n\r\nPaper so treated should be kept in darkness; that is, in a heavy\r\nenvelope or drawer until ready to photograph.\r\n\r\nImmediate photographing, as in the case of iodine prints, is not\r\nalways essential, since the prints are permanent and become illegible\r\nonly through eventual clouding of the background. Prompt photographing\r\nis recommended, however, as, in exceptional instances, silver-nitrate\r\nprints have become illegible in a matter of hours. Darkening\r\nordinarily will occur slowly if the paper is preserved in absolute\r\ndarkness, and silver-nitrate prints so preserved more than 10 years\r\nhave been observed to be quite clear.\r\n\r\nItems such as cardboard cartons, newspapers, road maps, large pieces\r\nof wrapping paper, or smooth, unpainted wood surfaces, too large for\r\ndipping, may be treated by brushing the solution over the surface with\r\na paint brush (fig. 423). Brushing does not damage or destroy latent\r\nimpressions on surfaces of this type. Cardboard boxes may be slit down\r\nthe edges and flattened out to permit easy placement under the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 423. Silver nitrate solution being applied with paint\r\nbrush.]\r\n\r\nWet paper should be handled with extreme care to prevent tearing. In\r\ntreating very thin types of paper the solution is best applied with a\r\ncotton swab or brush.\r\n\r\nPhotographs, Photostats, and blueprints of any value should not be\r\ntreated with silver nitrate, since the developed prints or stains\r\ncannot be removed without destroying them.\r\n\r\nIn working with silver nitrate, wear rubber gloves or handle all\r\nspecimens with tweezers; avoid spilling it on clothing. It will cause\r\ndark brown stains on clothing, skin, and fingernails. Such stains are\r\nnot easily removed. Areas of the skin subjected to prolonged contact\r\nare deadened, will turn black and peel.\r\n\r\nIf removal of silver nitrate prints (called \"de-silvering\") is\r\ndesired, this may be accomplished by placing the specimen in a\r\n2-percent solution of mercuric nitrate in a tray similar to that used\r\nfor the silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a small amount of this solution, dissolve two-thirds of an\r\nounce of mercuric nitrate crystals in 1 quart of distilled water and\r\nadd one-third of a fluid ounce of nitric acid. Shake well. This\r\nsolution, too, may be used several times before losing its strength\r\nand is not necessarily discarded after each use. It is not necessary\r\nto keep it in a dark bottle.\r\n\r\nThe specimen bearing silver nitrate prints is immersed in this\r\nsolution until all traces of the prints disappear. It should then be\r\nrinsed thoroughly in water to remove all mercuric nitrate. If this is\r\nnot done the paper deteriorates, becoming brittle and crumbly. A tray\r\nof distilled water may be used for rinsing or a tray of ordinary tap\r\nwater changed several times during the rinsing. The specimen is then\r\nlaid out flat to dry.\r\n\r\nWrinkles, such as are left in paper after ordinary drying, may be\r\nprevented by ironing with a moderately hot iron. An electric iron with\r\na temperature control is desirable. If kept too hot it will scorch or\r\nwrinkle the paper somewhat. The bottom of the iron should be clean so\r\nthat unremovable smudges will not be left on the paper.\r\n\r\nNo ill effects have been noted from working in the 2-percent mercuric\r\nnitrate solution with bare hands for very short periods, but it is a\r\ncaustic solution and it is suggested that the specimens be handled\r\nwith tweezers or that rubber gloves be worn if contact is prolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_The Use of the Fingerprint Camera_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a fingerprint is visible, an effort should be made to photograph it\r\nbefore any attempt is made to develop it. In every case a print\r\ndeveloped with powder should be photographed before lifting. It\r\nsometimes happens that the print does not lift properly although it\r\nmay be quite clear after development.\r\n\r\nThe camera which is especially adapted to the purpose and which is\r\neasiest to handle and operate is the fingerprint camera, one type of\r\nwhich is shown in figure 424. This camera has several advantages in\r\nphotographing fingerprints:\r\n\r\n     It photographs the prints in natural size.\r\n     It contains its own light source.\r\n     It has a fixed focus.\r\n\r\nCameras of this type are available in models operated by batteries and\r\n110-volt current. It is believed that the battery-operated type has\r\nthe greater utility, since house current may not be available at the\r\ncrime scene. When not in use the batteries should be removed as they\r\nwill eventually deteriorate and corrode the brass contacts in the\r\ncamera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 424. The fingerprint camera.]\r\n\r\nThe camera is of the box type and has three button controls which will\r\nopen: (1) The metal flap covering the aperture, (2) the front portion\r\nof the frame providing access to the self-contained light bulbs, and\r\n(3) the camera in half, providing access to the batteries and the\r\nshutter as shown below in figure 425.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 425. Button controls permit access to bulbs, batteries,\r\nand shutter.]\r\n\r\nA 2-1/4 x 3-1/4 film pack adapter or a 2-1/4 x 3-1/4 cut film holder\r\nholds the film in the camera. The film pack adapter will hold a pack\r\nof 12 sheets of film, and accordingly, will permit the taking of 12\r\npictures. The cut film holder is a unit which holds two sheets of film\r\nutilizing each side of the holder.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out that the FBI uses the film pack exclusively in view\r\nof the fact that practically all latent examinations will necessitate\r\nthe taking of more than two pictures. Further, the film pack is made\r\nso that it may be loaded into the adapter in the open light. Also, the\r\nfilms are numbered 1 through 12, which is a valuable feature in that\r\nin maintaining notes concerning the latent examinations it is a simple\r\nmatter to note by the number of the negative where the latent\r\nimpression was developed and photographed. Should it happen that\r\nduring a latent examination all twelve of the films are not used, the\r\nfilm pack, with the slide in place, is taken into the darkroom and\r\nonly those films which have been exposed are removed and developed.\r\nThe unexposed films remain in the film pack adapter with the slide in\r\nand may be used later.\r\n\r\nAs was previously mentioned, the camera has a fixed focus; that is,\r\nthe camera will take a legible picture only when the latent print is\r\nat the focal point, or exactly flush with the opening of the camera.\r\nThe latent print must not be inside the open end of the camera, nor\r\nmust it be beyond; otherwise, the picture will be blurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 426. When object being photographed does not cover\r\ncamera opening, outside light is excluded with piece of cloth.]\r\n\r\nSince the camera has its own light source, any leakage of outside\r\nlight will cause overexposure of the film. Consequently, if the\r\nsurface of the object bearing the latent print which is to be\r\nphotographed is uneven or does not cover the entire front of the\r\ncamera opening, it will be necessary to use some opaque material such\r\nas a focusing cloth or heavy dark material to cover the front of the\r\ncamera so as to exclude all outside light (fig. 426). If a latent\r\nprint on a pane of glass or an automobile window is being\r\nphotographed, it will be necessary to back up the latent so that there\r\nwill be no light leakage. Material showing a pattern or grain should\r\nnot be used for this purpose as any such pattern will photograph in\r\nthe background and possibly obliterate the ridges of the latent print.\r\n\r\nTo insure an equal distribution of the light over the latents being\r\nphotographed, the impressions should be centered in the opening of the\r\ncamera. This is accomplished by opening the angular front section of\r\nthe camera after the metal plate covering the front has been opened,\r\nand setting the aperture over the latent impressions so that they will\r\nbe as near the center as possible. Then, holding the camera firmly in\r\nplace, it is carefully closed (fig. 427).\r\n\r\nDuring exposure the camera must be held perfectly still. Any movement\r\nof the camera or object will result in a fuzzy or double image.\r\n\r\nIn photographing a small, movable object such as a bottle or tumbler,\r\nthe camera should not be placed on its end and an attempt made to\r\nbalance the object across the opening. Instead, the camera should be\r\nplaced on its side and the bottle or tumbler built up to the opening\r\nso that there is no necessity for holding the object (fig. 428). There\r\nwill be, of course, instances where the camera will have to be held,\r\nsuch as to the side of a wall, cabinet or automobile. Here an extreme\r\neffort should be made to avoid moving the camera or permitting it to\r\nslip during exposure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 427. Centering of latent in aperture insures equal\r\ndistribution of light over print.]\r\n\r\nAnticipating the possible use of the photographic negatives in a court\r\nproceeding, it becomes of paramount importance to be able to identify\r\nthem. This is done by using what is called an identification tag. The\r\ntag consists of a small piece of paper bearing the date, initials of\r\nthe examiner, and possibly a case number, and it should be\r\nhand-written. The tag is placed near the latent prints being\r\nphotographed so that it will appear in the picture. It should be borne\r\nin mind that concentration should be on the latent impressions, which\r\nmust be centered, and the identification tag should be to one side and\r\nnot covering any of the latent prints. Another method of\r\nidentification, if the surface permits, is to write the\r\nabove-mentioned data on the surface of the object bearing the latents\r\nso that the information set out will also be a part of the picture.\r\nToo much emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of the\r\nidentification tag. The lack of such data, by discretion of the\r\ncourt, may exclude the latents as evidence, in the absence of the\r\noriginal specimen bearing the latents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 428. In photographing objects with curved or irregular\r\nsurfaces, camera should be laid flat and latent-bearing surface built\r\nup to opening.]\r\n\r\nThe following are suggested exposure times for Tri-X film (available\r\nin 2-1/4\" x 3-1/4\" film packs) with battery-operated cameras having\r\nlenses without diaphragms:\r\n\r\n     Black powder print on white or light background--snapshot\r\n     Gray or white powder print on black or dark background--1 second\r\n\r\nThese same exposure times can be used on some cameras having lenses\r\nwith diaphragms, provided the lens opening is set at f6.3.\r\n\r\nThe above exposure times are for cameras with batteries in average\r\ncondition. If batteries become weak the exposures may be increased\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nIn making snapshots the shutter mechanism should be manipulated as\r\nrapidly as possible since slow motion will appreciably lengthen the\r\nexposure. In making time exposures the camera shutter must be held\r\nopen for the desired time. Personnel with photographic experience may\r\ndesire to use cut film with the fingerprint camera. A few tests will\r\ndetermine the optimum exposure times for any particular type of film.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the procedure for taking photographs of latents is as\r\nfollows: The film pack is placed into the film pack adapter with the\r\nsafety paper side of the film pack to the slide side of the adapter,\r\ncare being taken to see that all of the paper tabs are outside of the\r\nadapter. The adapter is placed on the camera in its proper position by\r\nopening a slide clamp attached to the camera, fitting the side of the\r\nadapter into the slot away from the clamp and pushing it down flat\r\ninto the opening. Don't try to slide the adapter into the opening from\r\nthe top. The adapter is locked in position by closing the clamp. Next\r\nthe slide is removed and the tab marked \"Safety Cover\" pulled out as\r\nfar as it will come and torn off. The camera is placed in position and\r\nthe first exposure made; then the tab marked \"1\" is pulled and the\r\nnext film is in position for exposure. This procedure is followed with\r\neach succeeding film until all have been exposed.\r\n\r\nWhen the last tab has been pulled out, the pack can be removed from\r\nthe adapter in daylight. If all of the films have not been exposed the\r\nslide is replaced into the adapter and the film pack removed from it\r\nin a darkroom, as previously stated.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of regular policy, it is recommended that more than one\r\nexposure be made of each latent, varying the normal exposure time to\r\ninsure satisfactory results, especially when the contrast is not a\r\ngood black on white or gray on black.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to photograph, note the following:\r\n\r\n     - Check shutter action.\r\n\r\n     - Check bulbs, batteries, and lights.\r\n\r\n     - Center latents in opening of camera.\r\n\r\n     - Latent being photographed must be flush with opening of\r\n     camera.\r\n\r\n     - Outside light must be excluded.\r\n\r\n     - Include identification tag in photograph.\r\n\r\n     - Remove slide and pull safety tab of film pack before\r\n     making exposure.\r\n\r\n     - Hold camera still while making exposure.\r\n\r\n     - Pull correct number tab after each exposure (be careful\r\n     not to pull more than one).\r\n\r\n     - Do not use grained or uneven material as a backing when\r\n     photographing latents on transparent glass.\r\n\r\n     - Mirrors, polished chrome, and nickel plate will photograph\r\n     black in the fingerprint camera.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing has dealt with the standard use of the fingerprint\r\ncamera when the direct light afforded by the camera gives suitable\r\nresults. There will be cases, however, where the results from the use\r\nof the direct light may not be adequate. Such cases may involve molded\r\nor embedded prints, such as prints in putty, wax, soap, etc. Should\r\ndirect light give poor results, side lighting may prove effective.\r\nThis can be done by loosening two of the bulbs on one side so that\r\nthey will not light. The light given by the other two bulbs is\r\ndirected so as to pass at right angles, as much as possible, across\r\nthe ridges of the embedded latent print. Adjustment of the exposure\r\ntime must be made when this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Fingerprint Charts for Court Testimony_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn testifying to fingerprint identification, the expert often prepares\r\ncharts to visually aid the court and jury in understanding the nature\r\nof his testimony. Many times it is undoubtedly difficult for the\r\nlayman to perceive, from a vocal explanation alone, the full import of\r\nan expert's testimony, due to its technical nature; consequently, some\r\ngraphic representation of the facts presented is amply justified and\r\nrewarded. The preparation of the charts is ultimately the sole\r\nresponsibility of the expert using them. As a matter of interest to\r\nlaw enforcement personnel engaged in fingerprint work, a brief\r\nexplanation of the preparation of such charts follows, along with\r\nsuggestions and remarks based on long experience in these matters.\r\n\r\nTo do the work conveniently, it will be necessary to have available,\r\nin addition to the ordinary photographic developing and printing\r\nmaterials, a projection enlarger which will enlarge preferably to at\r\nleast ten diameters. In the projection method of enlargement, the\r\nimage is printed directly from the original negative, and the\r\npreparation of an enlarged negative is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAside from the photographic equipment, the needed materials are: a\r\nroll of scotch photographic tape 1 inch wide to outline the areas of\r\nthe fingerprints on the negatives to be used; some stiff cardboard\r\napproximately 1/32 inch thick on which to mount the prepared charts; a\r\ntube of rubber cement; and a bottle of translucent ink, other than\r\nblack or white.\r\n\r\nA light-box on which to view the negatives while blocking, and a\r\nlettering set to draw the lines and numbers uniformly on the charts,\r\nwhile not absolutely essential, are helpful conveniences. A light-box\r\nis basically a frosted pane of glass with a light beneath it to\r\nproduce soft, even, non-glaring illumination. If no light-box is\r\navailable, a clear window may be utilized in \"blocking\" the negatives.\r\n\r\nIf the expert finds it necessary to have an outside source prepare his\r\nphotographs, he should retain personal custody of the evidence during\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nThe original latent print and inked print with which it is identical\r\nshould be photographed actual size. This procedure eliminates\r\nguesswork in enlarging both to the same degree. Whatever areas of the\r\ntwo prints are deemed requisite to illustrate the method of\r\nidentification are then outlined (blocked) on the negatives with the\r\nmasking tape, so that only those areas will show in the subsequent\r\nenlargements. Generally, if the legible area of the latent print is\r\nsmall, it is well to show the complete print. If the area is large,\r\nhowever, as in a palm print, an area which will not make the chart too\r\nbulky or unwieldy may be selected.\r\n\r\nIn blocking, the negative is affixed to the window pane or light-box\r\nby means of strips of photographic tape across the corners, with the\r\nside to be blocked up. This prevents constant shifting of the negative\r\nwhile it is being prepared. The latent print should be blocked first.\r\nCorners of the blocked areas should be square. Care should be\r\nexercised to have as nearly as possible the same ridge formations\r\nshown and the ridge formations in the same upright or horizontal\r\npositions. This may be facilitated by fixing a negative, bearing ruled\r\nsquares, between the negative being blocked and the glass to which it\r\nis attached.\r\n\r\nIf the latent print was developed or photographed as a light print on\r\na dark background, a reverse-color negative should be prepared and\r\nblocked in order that both prints may appear as black ridges on light\r\nbackgrounds. This is done by placing the original negative adjacent to\r\na new sheet of film and exposing it. The resultant negative contains\r\nthe same image as the original except that the color of the image has\r\nbeen reversed.\r\n\r\nIf the negative is a photograph of an opaque lift, the print appears\r\nin reverse position; that is, as a mirror image, and the negative will\r\naccordingly have to be blocked from the dull or emulsion side in order\r\nfor it to appear in a position comparable to that of the inked print.\r\n\r\nFailure to present the prints in question in the same color and\r\nposition may possibly confuse the observer and nullify the purpose for\r\nwhich the chart is made.\r\n\r\nThe degree of enlargement is not important in itself, so long as the\r\nridges of the latent print are readily distinguishable by the eye. Ten\r\ndiameters have been found adequate, although any enlargement from 5 to\r\n30 will serve. It should be remembered, however, that small\r\nenlargements are difficult to see a few feet away and that large ones\r\nlose some of the contrast between ridges and background. A white\r\nborder of at least 1-1/2 inches or a width equal to about one-third\r\nthe enlarged area should be left for charting purposes.\r\n\r\nAny chart prepared must be technically correct; that is, the\r\ncorresponding ridge characteristics in the two prints must be\r\nsimilarly numbered and indicated.\r\n\r\nSeveral ways of pointing out the similar ridge formations have been\r\nobserved, but the one which appears soundest is also simplest and\r\nconsists of merely marking the characteristics with lines and numbers.\r\n\r\nAll of the ridge characteristics in the prints need not be charted.\r\nTwelve characteristics are ample to illustrate an identification, but\r\nit is neither claimed nor implied that this number is required.\r\n\r\nAll fingerprint identifications are made by observing that two\r\nimpressions have ridge characteristics of similar shapes which occupy\r\nthe same relative positions in the patterns.\r\n\r\nMethods involving superimposition of the prints are not recommended\r\nbecause such a procedure is possible only in a very few instances, due\r\nto the distortion of ridges in most prints through pressure and\r\ntwisting. Such a procedure is not necessarily a test of identity.\r\n\r\nLikewise, presenting charts with the shapes of the characteristics\r\ndrawn in the margin is not recommended. Individual ridge\r\ncharacteristics may vary slightly in actual shape or physical position\r\ndue to twisting, pressure, incomplete inking, condition of latent\r\nprint when developed, powder adhering to background, etc.\r\nIdentifications are based on a number of characteristics viewed in a\r\nunit relationship and not on the microscopic appearances of single\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nSince the enlarged photographs appear in black and white, an ink other\r\nthan black or white should be used to line the chart. Such an ink\r\nshould be preferably translucent so that it will be possible to see\r\nthe ridges which it traverses. A translucent carmine drawing ink\r\nserves well. In placing the lines on the chart, they should be\r\narranged so that they do not cross or touch.\r\n\r\nThe chart will present a clearer, neater, and more pleasing appearance\r\nif it is numbered clockwise and the numbers are evenly spaced (fig.\r\n429). It is not necessary, however, to place the numbers evenly around\r\nthe photograph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 429. Chart illustrating method of fingerprint\r\nidentification.]\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the numbers are placed on three sides and the type of\r\nprint (latent or ink) noted at the bottom. In any case, the manner of\r\nnumbering should be subservient to an explanation of the\r\ncharacteristics in an orderly sequence; and, if the situation warrants\r\nit, all of the points may be illustrated on a single side of the\r\nphotograph.\r\n\r\nA single line should be drawn from each characteristic to a numbered\r\npoint on the margin. Care should be taken to draw the line exactly to\r\nthe characteristic point, not short of it, beyond it, or obscuring it.\r\nErasures should be avoided. If the ink runs or blots, it is sometimes\r\npossible to remove it with a cloth dampened in denatured alcohol,\r\nwithout damaging the photograph.\r\n\r\nIf the enlargement is great, that is, 25 or 30 diameters, it might be\r\nwell to draw a small circle around each characteristic and then draw\r\nthe line from the circle to the number, since the ridge will be much\r\nthicker than the illustrating line. All lines and numbers should be\r\nchecked for absolute accuracy. The expert should also study the\r\nenlargements for _apparent discrepancies_ in the prints, which he\r\nmight be called upon to explain.\r\n\r\nThe charted enlargements are readily mounted on stiff cardboard with\r\nrubber cement, which may be purchased in small tubes. After cementing\r\nthe photograph to the cardboard, it should be placed under a heavy\r\nflat object which will cover the entire surface until dry to prevent\r\nwarping and wrinkling. After drying, trim the two enlargements to the\r\nsame square size with heavy scissors, a pen knife or scalpel, and\r\nfasten them together, book-fashion, with strips of the photographic\r\ntape used in blocking the negatives. Of course, if charts are large,\r\n20 to 36 inches square, mounting is unnecessary and they will have to\r\nbe supported in the courtroom with thumbtacks or metal rings.\r\n\r\nSome courts do not permit numbering or lining of the photographs and\r\nthe enlargements alone in these cases will have to suffice. If there\r\nis some question about admissibility of the charted enlargements, it\r\nis well to prepare an extra uncharted set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Unidentified Latent Fingerprint File_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the FBI is requested to conduct surveys and\r\nparticipate in conferences and in police schools on the problem of\r\nfingerprint identification.\r\n\r\nAs a result of its observations in the course of these activities it\r\nhas been found that many identification bureaus are not fully aware of\r\nthe importance which latent finger impressions can have in connection\r\nwith the ordinary handling of arrest fingerprint cards.\r\n\r\nMany bureaus and departments spend considerable time in developing\r\nlatent impressions in a particular case. If no immediate results are\r\nforthcoming, the latent impressions are filed for future reference.\r\n\r\nSingle fingerprint files have been maintained with success by some\r\ndepartments. Many others do not attempt to keep a file because of\r\neither limited personnel or lack of funds. In many departments,\r\nhowever, where such a file is maintained, too often latent impressions\r\nare simply filed with no regard to possible future use. Actually,\r\nthese impressions should be treated as evidence directly connecting\r\nthe subject with the crime.\r\n\r\nActive consideration should be given to the latent impressions until\r\nthey are identified or the case has been successfully prosecuted. It\r\nis definitely felt that the following suggested procedure might have\r\nsome decided advantages.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that in all cases where latent impressions are\r\ndeveloped at the crime scene, or on an object used in connection with\r\nthe commission of a crime, the impressions be properly photographed\r\nand lifted. The evidence, where possible and practicable, should be\r\nproperly packed, labeled, and stored for future use in court (fig.\r\n430).\r\n\r\nUse care in wrapping the evidence to see that the latent impressions\r\non the objects are not destroyed. If the specimens are later used in\r\ncourt, the impressions should still be clearly visible. In the same\r\nmanner, all evidence not of a bulky nature, such as photographic\r\nnegatives, photographs, and lifts of latent impressions, should be\r\nsimilarly preserved for future court use. It is to be emphasized that\r\nall material in one case should bear a case number. All specimens not\r\nof a bulky nature can be placed in an envelope and filed by this case\r\nnumber (fig. 431).\r\n\r\nThe above procedure is the usual one followed by the majority of\r\nidentification bureaus in handling latent impressions. In order,\r\nhowever, to keep the latents in an active state, the photographs of\r\nall the latent impressions found in a particular case should be cut up\r\nand pasted on a 3 by 5 card bearing the case number and title of the\r\ncase (fig. 432).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 430. Evidence labeled and latents protected for storing\r\nfor future court use.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 431. Latent material in a case should be filed under a\r\nsingle case number.]\r\n\r\nIf numerous latents are developed, several cards should be used, all\r\nhaving the same number and title. These cards are then filed by case\r\nnumber in a regular filing cabinet. Before this step is taken, every\r\neffort should be made to secure and compare the fingerprints of\r\nindividuals who may legitimately have placed their prints on the\r\nobjects which were examined. In addition, as part of the case report\r\nbearing the same case number as the latent impressions, there should\r\nbe a notation pointing out that latent impressions were developed in\r\nthe case and that they are on file.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 432. For ready current comparisons latents in a case\r\nare placed on a 3 x 5 card bearing case title and number.]\r\n\r\n     Case #2345\r\n\r\n     Unknown Subjects\r\n     Jones' Drug Co.\r\n     B&E\r\n     3-15-47\r\n\r\nFingerprint comparisons in this unidentified file can be made on the\r\nbasis of fingerprints taken from day to day of individuals\r\nfingerprinted for criminal identification purposes. A routine may be\r\nset up whereby the fingerprints of individuals arrested each day will\r\nbe compared the following day with the latent fingerprints filed in\r\nthe unidentified latent file. It is most important that this procedure\r\nbe rigidly followed from day to day. It is to be borne in mind that\r\nthe comparisons are made whether the particular person is or is not a\r\nsuspect in a certain case. Special attention should be paid to\r\nfingerprints of individuals charged with burglary, breaking and\r\nentering, armed robbery, and other similar crimes.\r\n\r\nShould an identification be made of some latent prints, and others in\r\nthe same case remain unidentified, the 3 by 5 card should remain in\r\nfile until the case is fully closed, inasmuch as more than one person\r\nmay be involved in the crime. Of course, if all the latents are\r\nidentified, then the 3 by 5 card is removed and placed with the\r\nnegatives, lifts, etc.\r\n\r\nIt may be deemed advisable to remove these latents from the file in\r\ninstances where the statute of limitations covering the crime has run.\r\n\r\nIf the above procedure is rigidly followed, identification in many\r\ninstances will result--more than would be effected if the department\r\nmaintained only a single fingerprint file in which the latent prints\r\nwere merely filed away. Very often such a latent fingerprint file is a\r\nsource of information when all logical investigative leads have been\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n     _This résumé of latent impressions has been prepared by the\r\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation in the belief that it may be\r\n     of possible interest to law enforcement officers desiring to\r\n     avail themselves of latent identification evidence in\r\n     connection with their investigative activities. It should be\r\n     borne in mind that the comments and expressions set out in\r\n     this book are not intended to convey the thought that the\r\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation believes the points\r\n     emphasized are the only ones of moment, or that other\r\n     methods of developing latent impressions are not equally\r\n     acceptable. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will be glad\r\n     to answer any questions on the foregoing which may occur to\r\n     any law enforcement officer who reads this material._",
