Being thus established\r\nin a considerable part of the dominions he now possesses, he began,\r\nabout the year 1765, to form, at the instigation (as he asserts) of the\r\nservants of the East India Company, a variety of designs for the further\r\nextension of his territories. Some years after, he carried his views to\r\ncertain objects of interior arrangement, of a very pernicious nature.\r\nNone of these designs could be compassed without the aid of the\r\nCompany's arms; nor could those arms be employed consistently with an\r\nobedience to the Company's orders. He was therefore advised to form a\r\nmore secret, but an equally powerful, interest among the servants of\r\nthat Company, and among others both at home and abroad. By engaging them\r\nin his interests, the use of the Company's power might be obtained\r\nwithout their ostensible authority; the power might even be employed in\r\ndefiance of the authority, if the case should require, as in truth it\r\noften did require, a proceeding of that degree of boldness.\r\n\r\nThe Company had put him into possession of several great cities and\r\nmagnificent castles. The good order of his affairs, his sense of\r\npersonal dignity, his ideas of Oriental splendor, and the habits of an\r\nAsiatic life, (to which, being a native of India, and a Mahometan, he\r\nhad from his infancy been inured,) would naturally have led him to fix\r\nthe seat of his government within his own dominions. Instead of this, he\r\ntotally sequestered himself from his country, and, abandoning all\r\nappearance of state, he took up his residence in an ordinary house,\r\nwhich he purchased in the suburbs of the Company's factory at Madras. In\r\nthat place he has lived, without removing one day from thence, for\r\nseveral years past. He has there continued a constant cabal with the\r\nCompany's servants, from the highest to the lowest,--creating, out of\r\nthe ruins of the country, brilliant fortunes for those who will, and\r\nentirely destroying those who will not, be subservient to his purposes.\r\n\r\nAn opinion prevailed, strongly confirmed by several passages in his own\r\nletters, as well as by a combination of circumstances forming a body of\r\nevidence which cannot be resisted, that very great sums have been by him\r\ndistributed, through a long course of years, to some of the Company's\r\nservants. Besides these presumed payments in ready money, (of which,\r\nfrom the nature of the thing, the direct proof is very difficult,) debts\r\nhave at several periods been acknowledged to those gentlemen, to an\r\nimmense amount,--that is, to some millions of sterling money. There is\r\nstrong reason to suspect that the body of these debts is wholly\r\nfictitious, and was never created by money _bonâ fide_ lent. But even on\r\na supposition that this vast sum was really advanced, it was impossible\r\nthat the very reality of such an astonishing transaction should not\r\ncause some degree of alarm and incite to some sort of inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all seemly, at a moment when the Company itself was so\r\ndistressed as to require a suspension, by act of Parliament, of the\r\npayment of bills drawn on them from India,--and also a direct tax upon\r\nevery house in England, in order to facilitate the vent of their goods,\r\nand to avoid instant insolvency,--at that very moment, that their\r\nservants should appear in so flourishing a condition, as, besides ten\r\nmillions of other demands on their masters, to be entitled to claim a\r\ndebt of three or four millions more from the territorial revenue of one\r\nof their dependent princes.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible pecuniary transactions of the Nabob of Arcot with very\r\nprivate persons are so enormous, that they evidently set aside every\r\npretence of policy which might induce a prudent government in some\r\ninstances to wink at ordinary loose practice in ill-managed departments.\r\nNo caution could be too great in handling this matter, no scrutiny too\r\nexact. It was evidently the interest, and as evidently at least in the\r\npower, of the creditors, by admitting secret participation in this dark\r\nand undefined concern, to spread corruption to the greatest and the most\r\nalarming extent.\r\n\r\nThese facts relative to the debts were so notorious, the opinion of\r\ntheir being a principal source of the disorders of the British\r\ngovernment in India was so undisputed and universal, that there was no\r\nparty, no description of men in Parliament, who did not think themselves\r\nbound, if not in honor and conscience, at least in common decency, to\r\ninstitute a vigorous inquiry into the very bottom of the business,\r\nbefore they admitted any part of that vast and suspicious charge to be\r\nlaid upon an exhausted country. Every plan concurred in directing such\r\nan inquiry, in order that whatever was discovered to be corrupt,\r\nfraudulent, or oppressive should lead to a due animadversion on the\r\noffenders, and, if anything fair and equitable in its origin should be\r\nfound, (nobody suspected that much, comparatively speaking, would be so\r\nfound,) it might be provided for,--in due subordination, however, to the\r\nease of the subject and the service of the state.\r\n\r\nThese were the alleged grounds for an inquiry, settled in all the bills\r\nbrought into Parliament relative to India,--and there were, I think, no\r\nless than four of them. By the bill commonly called Mr. Pitt's bill, the\r\ninquiry was specially, and by express words, committed to the Court of\r\nDirectors, without any reserve for the interference of any other person\r\nor persons whatsoever. It was ordered that _they_ should make the\r\ninquiry into the origin and justice of these debts, as far as the\r\nmaterials in _their_ possession enabled them to proceed; and where\r\n_they_ found those materials deficient, _they_ should order the\r\nPresidency of Fort St. George (Madras) to complete the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors applied themselves to the execution of the trust\r\nreposed in them. They first examined into the amount of the debt, which\r\nthey computed, at compound interest, to be 2,945,600_l._ sterling.\r\nWhether their mode of computation, either of the original sums or the\r\namount on compound interest, was exact, that is, whether they took the\r\ninterest too high or the several capitals too low, is not material. On\r\nwhatever principle any of the calculations were made up, none of them\r\nfound the debt to differ from the recital of the act, which asserted\r\nthat the sums claimed were \"_very_ large.\" The last head of these debts\r\nthe Directors compute at 2,465,680_l._ sterling. Of the existence of\r\nthis debt the Directors heard nothing until 1776, and they say, that,\r\n\"although they had _repeatedly_ written to the Nabob of Arcot, and to\r\ntheir servants, respecting the debt, yet they _had never been able to\r\ntrace the origin thereof, or to obtain any satisfactory information on\r\nthe subject_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors, after stating the circumstances under which the\r\ndebts appeared to them to have been contracted, add as follows:--\"For\r\nthese reasons we should have thought it our duty to inquire _very\r\nminutely_ into those debts, even if the act of Parliament had been\r\nsilent on the subject, before we concurred in any measure for their\r\npayment. But with the positive injunctions of the act before us to\r\nexamine into their nature and origin, we are indispensably bound to\r\ndirect such an inquiry to be instituted.\" They then order the President\r\nand Council of Madras to enter into a full examination, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe Directors, having drawn up their order to the Presidency on these\r\nprinciples, communicated the draught of the general letter in which\r\nthose orders were contained to the board of his Majesty's ministers, and\r\nother servants lately constituted by Mr. Pitt's East India Act. These\r\nministers, who had just carried through Parliament the bill ordering a\r\nspecific inquiry, immediately drew up another letter, on a principle\r\ndirectly opposite to that which was prescribed by the act of Parliament\r\nand followed by the Directors. In these second orders, all idea of an\r\ninquiry into the justice and origin of the pretended debts, particularly\r\nof the last, the greatest, and the most obnoxious to suspicion, is\r\nabandoned. They are all admitted and established without any\r\ninvestigation whatsoever, (except some private conference with the\r\nagents of the claimants is to pass for an investigation,) and a fund for\r\ntheir discharge is assigned and set apart out of the revenues of the\r\nCarnatic. To this arrangement in favor of their servants, servants\r\nsuspected of corruption and convicted of disobedience, the Directors of\r\nthe East India Company were ordered to set their hands, asserting it to\r\narise from their own conviction and opinion, in flat contradiction to\r\ntheir recorded sentiments, their strong remonstrance, and their declared\r\nsense of their duty, as well under their general trust and their oath as\r\nDirectors, as under the express injunctions of an act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which this summary proceeding was adopted by the\r\nministerial board are stated by themselves in a number in the appendix\r\nto this speech.\r\n\r\nBy another section of the same act, the same Court of Directors were\r\nordered to take into consideration and to decide on the indeterminate\r\nrights of the Rajah of Tanjore and the Nabob of Arcot; and in this, as\r\nin the former case, no power of appeal, revision, or alteration was\r\nreserved to any other. It was a jurisdiction, in a cause between party\r\nand party, given to the Court of Directors specifically. It was known\r\nthat the territories of the former of these princes had been twice\r\ninvaded and pillaged, and the prince deposed and imprisoned, by the\r\nCompany's servants, influenced by the intrigues of the latter, and for\r\nthe purpose of paying his pretended debts. The Company had, in the year\r\n1775, ordered a restoration of the Rajah to his government, under\r\ncertain conditions. The Rajah complained, that his territories had not\r\nbeen completely restored to him, and that no part of his goods, money,\r\nrevenues, or records, unjustly taken and withheld from him, were ever\r\nreturned. The Nabob, on the other hand, never ceased to claim the\r\ncountry itself, and carried on a continued train of negotiation, that it\r\nshould again be given up to him, in violation of the Company's public\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe Directors, in obedience to this part of the act, ordered an inquiry,\r\nand came to a determination to restore certain of his territories to the\r\nRajah. The ministers, proceeding as in the former case, without hearing\r\nany party, rescinded the decision of the Directors, refused the\r\nrestitution of the territory, and, without regard to the condition of\r\nthe country of Tanjore, which had been within a few years four times\r\nplundered, (twice by the Nabob of Arcot, and twice by enemies brought\r\nupon it solely by the politics of the same Nabob, the declared enemy of\r\nthat people,) and without discounting a shilling for their sufferings,\r\nthey accumulate an arrear of about four hundred thousand pounds of\r\npretended tribute to this enemy; and then they order the Directors to\r\nput their hands to a new adjudication, directly contrary to a judgment\r\nin a judicial character and trust solemnly given by them and entered on\r\ntheir records.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings naturally called for some inquiry. On the 28th of\r\nFebruary, 1785, Mr. Fox made the following motion in the House of\r\nCommons, after moving that the clauses of the act should be read:--\"That\r\nthe proper officer do lay before this House copies or extracts of all\r\nletters and orders of the Court of Directors of the United East India\r\nCompany, in pursuance of the injunctions contained in the 37th and 38th\r\nclauses of the said act\"; and the question being put, it passed in the\r\nnegative by a very great majority.\r\n\r\nThe last speech in the debate was the following; which is given to the\r\npublic, not as being more worthy of its attention than others, (some of\r\nwhich were of consummate ability,) but as entering more into the detail\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe times we live in, Mr. Speaker, have been distinguished by\r\nextraordinary events. Habituated, however, as we are, to uncommon\r\ncombinations of men and of affairs, I believe nobody recollects anything\r\nmore surprising than the spectacle of this day. The right honorable\r\ngentleman[1] whose conduct is now in question formerly stood forth in\r\nthis House, the prosecutor of the worthy baronet[2] who spoke after him.\r\nHe charged him with several grievous acts of malversation in office,\r\nwith abuses of a public trust of a great and heinous nature. In less\r\nthan two years we see the situation of the parties reversed; and a\r\nsingular revolution puts the worthy baronet in a fair way of returning\r\nthe prosecution in a recriminatory bill of pains and penalties, grounded\r\non a breach of public trust relative to the government of the very same\r\npart of India. If he should undertake a bill of that kind, he will find\r\nno difficulty in conducting it with a degree of skill and vigor fully\r\nequal to all that have been exerted against him.\r\n\r\nBut the change of relation between these two gentlemen is not so\r\nstriking as the total difference of their deportment under the same\r\nunhappy circumstances. Whatever the merits of the worthy baronet's\r\ndefence might have been, he did not shrink from the charge. He met it\r\nwith manliness of spirit and decency of behavior. What would have been\r\nthought of him, if he had held the present language of his old accuser?\r\nWhen articles were exhibited against him by that right honorable\r\ngentleman, he did not think proper to tell the House that we ought to\r\ninstitute no inquiry, to inspect no paper, to examine no witness. He did\r\nnot tell us (what at that time he might have told us with some show of\r\nreason) that our concerns in India were matters of delicacy, that to\r\ndivulge anything relative to them would be mischievous to the state. He\r\ndid not tell us that those who would inquire into his proceedings were\r\ndisposed to dismember the empire. He had not the presumption to say,\r\nthat, for his part, having obtained, in his Indian presidency, the\r\nultimate object of his ambition, his honor was concerned in executing\r\nwith integrity the trust which had been legally committed to his charge:\r\nthat others, not having been so fortunate, could not be so\r\ndisinterested; and therefore their accusations could spring from no\r\nother source than faction, and envy to his fortune.\r\n\r\nHad he been frontless enough to hold such vain, vaporing language in the\r\nface of a grave, a detailed, a specified matter of accusation, whilst he\r\nviolently resisted everything which could bring the merits of his cause\r\nto the test,--had he been wild enough to anticipate the absurdities of\r\nthis day,--that is, had he inferred, as his late accuser has thought\r\nproper to do, that he could not have been guilty of malversation in\r\noffice, for this sole and curious reason, that he had been in\r\noffice,--had he argued the impossibility of his abusing his power on\r\nthis sole principle, that he had power to abuse,--he would have left\r\nbut one impression on the mind of every man who heard him, and who\r\nbelieved him in his senses: that in the utmost extent he was guilty of\r\nthe charge.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, leaving these two gentlemen to alternate as criminal and\r\naccuser upon what principles they think expedient, it is for us to\r\nconsider whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasurer of\r\nthe Navy, acting as a Board of Control, are justified by law or policy\r\nin suspending the legal arrangements made by the Court of Directors, in\r\norder to transfer the public revenues to the private emolument of\r\ncertain servants of the East India Company, without the inquiry into the\r\norigin and justice of their claims prescribed by an act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is not contended that the act of Parliament did not expressly ordain\r\nan inquiry. It is not asserted that this inquiry was not, with equal\r\nprecision of terms, specially committed, under particular regulations,\r\nto the Court of Directors. I conceive, therefore, the Board of Control\r\nhad no right whatsoever to intermeddle in that business. There is\r\nnothing certain in the principles of jurisprudence, if this be not\r\nundeniably true, that when, a special authority is given to any persons\r\nby name to do some particular act, that no others, by virtue of general\r\npowers, can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust,\r\nand to exercise those special functions in their place. I therefore\r\nconsider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright\r\nusurpation. But if the strained construction by which they have forced\r\nthemselves into a suspicious office (which every man delicate with\r\nregard to character would rather have sought constructions to avoid)\r\nwere perfectly sound and perfectly legal, of this I am certain, that\r\nthey cannot be justified in declining the inquiry which had been\r\nprescribed to the Court of Directors. If the Board of Control did\r\nlawfully possess the right of executing the special trust given to that\r\ncourt, they must take it as they found it, subject to the very same\r\nregulations which bound the Court of Directors. It will be allowed that\r\nthe Court of Directors had no authority to dispense with either the\r\nsubstance or the mode of inquiry prescribed by the act of Parliament. If\r\nthey had not, where in the act did the Board of Control acquire that\r\ncapacity? Indeed, it was impossible they should acquire it. What must we\r\nthink of the fabric and texture of an act of Parliament which should\r\nfind it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition, that should descend\r\ninto minute regulations for the conduct of that inquisition, that should\r\ncommit this trust to a particular description of men, and in the very\r\nsame breath should enable another body, at their own pleasure, to\r\nsupersede all the provisions the legislature had made, and to defeat the\r\nwhole purpose, end, and object of the law? This cannot be supposed even\r\nof an act of Parliament conceived by the ministers themselves, and\r\nbrought forth during the delirium of the last session.\r\n\r\nMy honorable friend has told you in the speech which introduced his\r\nmotion, that fortunately this question is not a great deal involved in\r\nthe labyrinths of Indian detail. Certainly not. But if it were, I beg\r\nleave to assure you that there is nothing in the Indian detail which is\r\nmore difficult than in the detail of any other business. I admit,\r\nbecause I have some experience of the fact, that for the interior\r\nregulation of India a minute knowledge of India is requisite. But on\r\nany specific matter of delinquency in its government you are as capable\r\nof judging as if the same thing were done at your door. Fraud,\r\ninjustice, oppression, peculation, engendered in India, are crimes of\r\nthe same blood, family, and cast with those that are born and bred in\r\nEngland. To go no farther than the case before us: you are just as\r\ncompetent to judge whether the sum of four millions sterling ought or\r\nought not to be passed from the public treasury into a private pocket\r\nwithout any title except the claim of the parties, when the issue of\r\nfact is laid in Madras, as when it is laid in Westminster. Terms of art,\r\nindeed, are different in different places; but they are generally\r\nunderstood in none. The technical style of an Indian treasury is not one\r\njot more remote than the jargon of our own Exchequer from the train of\r\nour ordinary ideas or the idiom of our common language. The difference,\r\ntherefore, in the two cases is not in the comparative difficulty or\r\nfacility of the two subjects, but in our attention to the one and our\r\ntotal neglect of the other. Had this attention and neglect been\r\nregulated by the value of the several objects, there would be nothing to\r\ncomplain of. But the reverse of that supposition is true. The scene of\r\nthe Indian abuse is distant, indeed; but we must not infer that the\r\nvalue of our interest in it is decreased in proportion as it recedes\r\nfrom our view. In our politics, as in our common conduct, we shall be\r\nworse than infants, if we do not put our senses under the tuition of our\r\njudgment, and effectually cure ourselves of that optical illusion which\r\nmakes a brier at our nose of greater magnitude than an oak at five\r\nhundred yards' distance.\r\n\r\nI think I can trace all the calamities of this country to the single\r\nsource of our not having had steadily before our eyes a general,\r\ncomprehensive, well-connected, and well-proportioned view of the whole\r\nof our dominions, and a just sense of their true bearings and relations.\r\nAfter all its reductions, the British empire is still vast and various.\r\nAfter all the reductions of the House of Commons, (stripped as we are of\r\nour brightest ornaments and of our most important privileges,) enough\r\nare yet left to furnish us, if we please, with means of showing to the\r\nworld that we deserve the superintendence of as large an empire as this\r\nkingdom ever held, and the continuance of as ample privileges as the\r\nHouse of Commons, in the plenitude of its power, had been habituated to\r\nassert. But if we make ourselves too little for the sphere of our duty,\r\nif, on the contrary, we do not stretch and expand our minds to the\r\ncompass of their object, be well assured that everything about us will\r\ndwindle by degrees, until at length our concerns are shrunk to the\r\ndimensions of our minds. It is not a predilection to mean, sordid,\r\nhome-bred cares that will avert the consequences of a false estimation\r\nof our interest, or prevent the shameful dilapidation into which a great\r\nempire must fall by mean reparations upon mighty ruins.\r\n\r\nI confess I feel a degree of disgust, almost leading to despair, at the\r\nmanner in which we are acting in the great exigencies of our country.\r\nThere is now a bill in this House appointing a rigid inquisition into\r\nthe minutest detail of our offices at home. The collection of sixteen\r\nmillions annually, a collection on which the public greatness, safety,\r\nand credit have their reliance, the whole order of criminal\r\njurisprudence, which holds together society itself, have at no time\r\nobliged us to call forth such powers,--no, nor anything like them. There\r\nis not a principle of the law and Constitution of this country that is\r\nnot subverted to favor the execution of that project.[3] And for what is\r\nall this apparatus of bustle and terror? Is it because anything\r\nsubstantial is expected from it? No. The stir and bustle itself is the\r\nend proposed. The eye-servants of a short-sighted master will employ\r\nthemselves, not on what is most essential to his affairs, but on what is\r\nnearest to his ken. Great difficulties have given a just value to\r\neconomy; and our minister of the day must be an economist, whatever it\r\nmay cost us. But where is he to exert his talents? At home, to be sure;\r\nfor where else can he obtain a profitable credit for their exertion? It\r\nis nothing to him, whether the object on which he works under our eye be\r\npromising or not. If he does not obtain any public benefit, he may make\r\nregulations without end. Those are sure to pay in present expectation,\r\nwhilst the effect is at a distance, and may be the concern of other\r\ntimes and other men. On these principles, he chooses to suppose (for he\r\ndoes not pretend more than to suppose) a naked possibility that he shall\r\ndraw some resource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury;\r\nthat something shall be laid in store from the short allowance of\r\nrevenue-officers overloaded with duty and famished for want of\r\nbread,--by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to\r\nbatter the Treasury with what breaks through stone walls for an\r\n_increase_ of their appointments. From the marrowless bones of these\r\nskeleton establishments, by the use of every sort of cutting and of\r\nevery sort of fretting tool, he flatters himself that he may chip and\r\nrasp an empirical alimentary powder, to diet into some similitude of\r\nhealth and substance the languishing chimeras of fraudulent reformation.\r\n\r\nWhilst he is thus employed according to his policy and to his taste, he\r\nhas not leisure to inquire into those abuses in India that are drawing\r\noff money by millions from the treasures of this country, which are\r\nexhausting the vital juices from members of the state, where the public\r\ninanition is far more sorely felt than in the local exchequer of\r\nEngland. Not content with winking at these abuses, whilst he attempts to\r\nsqueeze the laborious, ill-paid drudges of English revenue, he lavishes,\r\nin one act of corrupt prodigality, upon those who never served the\r\npublic in any honest occupation at all, an annual income equal to two\r\nthirds of the whole collection of the revenues of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nActuated by the same principle of choice, he has now on the anvil\r\nanother scheme, full of difficulty and desperate hazard, which totally\r\nalters the commercial relation of two kingdoms, and, what end soever it\r\nshall have, may bequeath a legacy of heartburning and discontent to one\r\nof the countries, perhaps to both, to be perpetuated to the latest\r\nposterity. This project is also undertaken on the hope of profit. It is\r\nprovided, that, out of some (I know not what) remains of the Irish\r\nhereditary revenue, a fund, at some time, and of some sort, should be\r\napplied to the protection of the Irish trade. Here we are commanded\r\nagain to task our faith, and to persuade ourselves, that, out of the\r\nsurplus of deficiency, out of the savings of habitual and systematic\r\nprodigality, the minister of wonders will provide support for this\r\nnation, sinking under the mountainous load of two hundred and thirty\r\nmillions of debt. But whilst we look with pain at his desperate and\r\nlaborious trifling, whilst we are apprehensive that he will break his\r\nback in stooping to pick up chaff and straws, he recovers himself at an\r\nelastic bound, and with a broadcast swing of his arm he squanders over\r\nhis Indian field a sum far greater than the clear produce of the whole\r\nhereditary revenue of the kingdom of Ireland.[4]\r\n\r\nStrange as this scheme of conduct in ministry is, and inconsistent with\r\nall just policy, it is still true to itself, and faithful to its own\r\nperverted order. Those who are bountiful to crimes will be rigid to\r\nmerit and penurious to service. Their penury is even held out as a blind\r\nand cover to their prodigality. The economy of injustice is to furnish\r\nresources for the fund of corruption. Then they pay off their protection\r\nto great crimes and great criminals by being inexorable to the paltry\r\nfrailties of little men; and these modern flagellants are sure, with a\r\nrigid fidelity, to whip their own enormities on the vicarious back of\r\nevery small offender.\r\n\r\nIt is to draw your attention to economy of quite another order, it is to\r\nanimadvert on offences of a far different description, that my honorable\r\nfriend has brought before you the motion of this day. It is to\r\nperpetuate the abuses which are subverting the fabric of your empire,\r\nthat the motion is opposed. It is, therefore, with reason (and if he has\r\npower to carry himself through, I commend his prudence) that the right\r\nhonorable gentleman makes his stand at the very outset, and boldly\r\nrefuses all Parliamentary information. Let him admit but one step\r\ntowards inquiry, and he is undone. You must be ignorant, or he cannot be\r\nsafe. But before his curtain is let down, and the shades of eternal\r\nnight shall veil our Eastern dominions from our view, permit me, Sir, to\r\navail myself of the means which were furnished in anxious and\r\ninquisitive times to demonstrate out of this single act of the present\r\nminister what advantages you are to derive from permitting the greatest\r\nconcern of this nation to be separated from the cognizance, and exempted\r\neven out of the competence, of Parliament. The greatest body of your\r\nrevenue, your most numerous armies, your most important commerce, the\r\nrichest sources of your public credit, (contrary to every idea of the\r\nknown, settled policy of England,) are on the point of being converted\r\ninto a mystery of state. You are going to have one half of the globe hid\r\neven from the common liberal curiosity of an English gentleman. Here a\r\ngrand revolution commences. Mark the period, and mark the circumstances.\r\nIn most of the capital changes that are recorded in the principles and\r\nsystem of any government, a public benefit of some kind or other has\r\nbeen pretended. The revolution commenced in something plausible, in\r\nsomething which carried the appearance at least of punishment of\r\ndelinquency or correction of abuse. But here, in the very moment of the\r\nconversion of a department of British government into an Indian mystery,\r\nand in the very act in which the change commences, a corrupt private\r\ninterest is set up in direct opposition to the necessities of the\r\nnation. A diversion is made of millions of the public money from the\r\npublic treasury to a private purse. It is not into secret negotiations\r\nfor war, peace, or alliance that the House of Commons is forbidden to\r\ninquire. It is a matter of account; it is a pecuniary transaction; it is\r\nthe demand of a suspected steward upon ruined tenants and an embarrassed\r\nmaster that the Commons of Great Britain are commanded not to inspect.\r\nThe whole tenor of the right honorable gentleman's argument is consonant\r\nto the nature of his policy. The system of concealment is fostered by a\r\nsystem of falsehood. False facts, false colors, false names of persons\r\nand things, are its whole support.\r\n\r\nSir, I mean to follow the right honorable gentleman over that field of\r\ndeception, clearing what he has purposely obscured, and fairly stating\r\nwhat it was necessary for him to misrepresent. For this purpose, it is\r\nnecessary you should know, with some degree of distinctness, a little of\r\nthe locality, the nature, the circumstances, the magnitude of the\r\npretended debts on which this marvellous donation is founded, as well as\r\nof the persons from whom and by whom it is claimed.\r\n\r\nMadras, with its dependencies, is the second (but with a long interval,\r\nthe second) member of the British empire in the East. The trade of that\r\ncity, and of the adjacent territory, was not very long ago among the\r\nmost flourishing in Asia. But since the establishment of the British\r\npower it has wasted away under an uniform gradual decline, insomuch that\r\nin the year 1779 not one merchant of eminence was to be found in the\r\nwhole country.[5] During this period of decay, about six hundred\r\nthousand sterling pounds a year have been drawn off by English gentlemen\r\non their private account, by the way of China alone.[6] If we add four\r\nhundred thousand, as probably remitted through other channels, and in\r\nother mediums, that is, in jewels, gold, and silver, directly brought to\r\nEurope, and in bills upon the British and foreign companies, you will\r\nscarcely think the matter overrated. If we fix the commencement of this\r\nextraction of money from the Carnatic at a period no earlier than the\r\nyear 1760, and close it in the year 1780, it probably will not amount to\r\na great deal less than twenty millions of money.\r\n\r\nDuring the deep, silent flow of this steady stream of wealth which set\r\nfrom India into Europe, it generally passed on with no adequate\r\nobservation; but happening at some periods to meet rifts of rocks that\r\nchecked its course, it grew more noisy and attracted more notice. The\r\npecuniary discussions caused by an accumulation of part of the fortunes\r\nof their servants in a debt from the Nabob of Arcot was the first thing\r\nwhich very particularly called for, and long engaged, the attention of\r\nthe Court of Directors. This debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty\r\nthousand pounds sterling, and was claimed, for the greater part, by\r\nEnglish gentlemen residing at Madras. This grand capital, settled at\r\nlength by order at ten per cent, afforded an annuity of eighty-eight\r\nthousand pounds.[7]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Directors were digesting their astonishment at this\r\ninformation, a memorial was presented to them from three gentlemen,\r\ninforming them that their friends had lent, likewise, to merchants of\r\nCanton in China, a sum of not more than one million sterling. In this\r\nmemorial they called upon the Company for their assistance and\r\ninterposition with the Chinese government for the recovery of the debt.\r\nThis sum lent to Chinese merchants was at twenty-four per cent, which\r\nwould yield, if paid, an annuity of two hundred and forty thousand\r\npounds.[8]\r\n\r\nPerplexed as the Directors were with these demands, you may conceive,\r\nSir, that they did not find themselves very much disembarrassed by being\r\nmade acquainted that they must again exert their influence for a new\r\nreserve of the happy parsimony of their servants, collected into a\r\nsecond debt from the Nabob of Arcot, amounting to two millions four\r\nhundred thousand pounds, settled at an interest of twelve per cent. This\r\nis known by the name of the Consolidation of 1777, as the former of the\r\nNabob's debts was by the title of the Consolidation of 1767. To this was\r\nadded, in a separate parcel, a little reserve, called the Cavalry Debt,\r\nof one hundred and sixty thousand pounds, at the same interest. The\r\nwhole of these four capitals, amounting to four millions four hundred\r\nand forty thousand pounds, produced at their several rates, annuities\r\namounting to six hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds a year: a good\r\ndeal more than one third of the clear land-tax of England, at four\r\nshillings in the pound; a good deal more than double the whole annual\r\ndividend of the East India Company, the nominal masters to the\r\nproprietors in these funds. Of this interest, three hundred and\r\neighty-three thousand two hundred pounds a year stood chargeable on the\r\npublic revenues of the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nSir, at this moment, it will not be necessary to consider the various\r\noperations which the capital and interest of this debt have successively\r\nundergone. I shall speak to these operations when I come particularly to\r\nanswer the right honorable gentleman on each of the heads, as he has\r\nthought proper to divide them. But this was the exact view in which\r\nthese debts first appeared to the Court of Directors, and to the world.\r\nIt varied afterwards. But it never appeared in any other than a most\r\nquestionable shape. When this gigantic phantom of debt first appeared\r\nbefore a young minister, it naturally would have justified some degree\r\nof doubt and apprehension. Such a prodigy would have filled any common\r\nman with superstitious fears. He would exorcise that shapeless, nameless\r\nform, and by everything sacred would have adjured it to tell by what\r\nmeans a small number of slight individuals, of no consequence or\r\nsituation, possessed of no lucrative offices, without the command of\r\narmies or the known administration of revenues, without profession of\r\nany kind, without any sort of trade sufficient to employ a peddler,\r\ncould have, in a few years, (as to some, even in a few months,) amassed\r\ntreasures equal to the revenues of a respectable kingdom? Was it not\r\nenough to put these gentlemen, in the novitiate of their administration,\r\non their guard, and to call upon them for a strict inquiry, (if not to\r\njustify them in a reprobation of those demands without any inquiry at\r\nall,) that, when all England, Scotland, and Ireland had for years been\r\nwitness to the immense sums laid out by the servants of the Company in\r\nstocks of all denominations, in the purchase of lands, in the buying and\r\nbuilding of houses, in the securing quiet seats in Parliament or in the\r\ntumultuous riot of contested elections, in wandering throughout the\r\nwhole range of those variegated modes of inventive prodigality which\r\nsometimes have excited our wonder, sometimes roused our indignation,\r\nthat, after all, India was four millions still in debt to _them_? India\r\nin debt to _them_! For what? Every debt, for which an equivalent of some\r\nkind or other is not given, is, on the face of it, a fraud. What is the\r\nequivalent they have given? What equivalent had they to give? What are\r\nthe articles of commerce, or the branches of manufacture, which those\r\ngentlemen have carried hence to enrich India? What are the sciences they\r\nbeamed out to enlighten it? What are the arts they introduced to cheer\r\nand to adorn it? What are the religious, what the moral institutions\r\nthey have taught among that people, as a guide to life, or as a\r\nconsolation when life is to be no more, that there is an eternal debt, a\r\ndebt \"still paying, still to owe,\" which must be bound on the present\r\ngeneration in India, and entailed on their mortgaged posterity forever?\r\nA debt of millions, in favor of a set of men whose names, with few\r\nexceptions, are either buried in the obscurity of their origin and\r\ntalents or dragged into light by the enormity of their crimes!\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the courage of the minister was the most wonderful part of\r\nthe transaction, especially as he must have read, or rather the right\r\nhonorable gentleman says he has read for him, whole volumes upon the\r\nsubject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part so numerous\r\nas the right honorable gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order\r\nto frighten you from inquiry; but in these volumes, such as they are,\r\nthe minister must have found a full authority for a suspicion (at the\r\nvery least) of everything relative to the great fortunes made at Madras.\r\nWhat is that authority? Why, no other than the standing authority for\r\nall the claims which the ministry has thought fit to provide for,--the\r\ngrand debtor,--the Nabob of Arcot himself. Hear that prince, in the\r\nletter written to the Court of Directors, at the precise period whilst\r\nthe main body of these debts were contracting. In his letter he states\r\nhimself to be, what undoubtedly he is, a most competent witness to this\r\npoint. After speaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of\r\nother measures which he censures, (whether right or wrong it signifies\r\nnothing,) and into which he says he had been led by the Company's\r\nservants, he proceeds in this manner:--\"If all these things were against\r\nthe real interests of the Company, they are ten thousand times more\r\nagainst mine, and against the prosperity of my country and the happiness\r\nof my people; for your interests and mine are the same. _What were they\r\nowing to, then? To the private views of a few individuals, who have\r\nenriched themselves at the expense of your influence and of my country:\r\nfor your servants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY, neither do you pay them\r\nhigh wages; yet in a few years they return to England with many lacs of\r\npagodas. How can you or I account for such immense fortunes acquired in\r\nso short a time, without any visible means of getting them?_\"\r\n\r\nWhen he asked this question, which involves its answer, it is\r\nextraordinary that curiosity did not prompt the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer to that inquiry which might come in vain recommended to him by\r\nhis own act of Parliament. Does not the Nabob of Arcot tell us, in so\r\nmany words, that there was no fair way of making the enormous sums sent\r\nby the Company's servants to England? And do you imagine that there was\r\nor could be more honesty and good faith in the demands for what remained\r\nbehind in India? Of what nature were the transactions with himself? If\r\nyou follow the train of his information, you must see, that, if these\r\ngreat sums were at all lent, it was not property, but spoil, that was\r\nlent; if not lent, the transaction was not a contract, but a fraud.\r\nEither way, if light enough could not be furnished to authorize a full\r\ncondemnation of these demands, they ought to have been left to the\r\nparties, who best knew and understood each other's proceedings. It was\r\nnot necessary that the authority of government should interpose in favor\r\nof claims whose very foundation was a defiance of that authority, and\r\nwhose object and end was its entire subversion.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that this letter was written by the Nabob of Arcot in a\r\nmoody humor, under the influence of some chagrin. Certainly it was; but\r\nit is in such humors that truth comes out. And when he tells you, from\r\nhis own knowledge, what every one must presume, from the extreme\r\nprobability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one such testimony\r\nis worth a thousand that contradict that probability, when the parties\r\nhave a better understanding with each other, and when they have a point\r\nto carry that may unite them in a common deceit.\r\n\r\nIf this body of private claims of debt, real or devised, were a\r\nquestion, as it is falsely pretended, between the Nabob of Arcot, as\r\ndebtor, and Paul Benfield and his associates, as creditors, I am sure I\r\nshould give myself but little trouble about it. If the hoards of\r\noppression were the fund for satisfying the claims of bribery and\r\npeculation, who would wish to interfere between such litigants? If the\r\ndemands were confined to what might be drawn from the treasures which\r\nthe Company's records uniformly assert that the Nabob is in possession\r\nof, or if he had mines of gold or silver or diamonds, (as we know that\r\nhe has none,) these gentlemen might break open his hoards or dig in his\r\nmines without any disturbance from me. But the gentlemen on the other\r\nside of the House know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me,\r\nthat the Nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adversaries, but\r\ncollusive parties, and that the whole transaction is under a false color\r\nand false names. The litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their\r\nrapacity and his hoarded riches. No: it is between him and them\r\ncombining and confederating, on one side, and the public revenues, and\r\nthe miserable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. These are\r\nthe real plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit. Refusing a\r\nshilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand, the Nabob\r\nof Arcot is always ready, nay, he earnestly, and with eagerness and\r\npassion, contends for delivering up to these pretended creditors his\r\nterritory and his subjects. It is, therefore, not from treasuries and\r\nmines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld\r\nfrom the veins and whipped out of the backs of the most miserable of\r\nmen, that we are to pamper extortion, usury, and peculation, under the\r\nfalse names of debtors and creditors of state.\r\n\r\nThe great patron of these creditors, (to whose honor they ought to erect\r\nstatues,) the right honorable gentleman,[9] in stating the merits which\r\nrecommended them to his favor, has ranked them under three grand\r\ndivisions. The first, the creditors of 1767; then the creditors of the\r\ncavalry loan; and lastly, the creditors of the loan in 1777. Let us\r\nexamine them, one by one, as they pass in review before us.\r\n\r\nThe first of these loans, that of 1767, he insists, has an indisputable\r\nclaim upon the public justice. The creditors, he affirms, lent their\r\nmoney publicly; they advanced it with the express knowledge and\r\napprobation of the Company; and it was contracted at the moderate\r\ninterest of ten per cent. In this loan, the demand is, according to him,\r\nnot only just, but meritorious in a very high degree: and one would be\r\ninclined to believe he thought so, because he has put it last in the\r\nprovision he has made for these claims.\r\n\r\nI readily admit this debt to stand the fairest of the whole; for,\r\nwhatever may be my suspicions concerning a part of it, I can convict it\r\nof nothing worse than the most enormous usury. But I can convict, upon\r\nthe spot, the right honorable gentleman of the most daring\r\nmisrepresentation in every one fact, without any exception, that he has\r\nalleged in defence of this loan, and of his own conduct with regard to\r\nit. I will show you that this debt was never contracted with the\r\nknowledge of the Company; that it had not their approbation; that they\r\nreceived the first intelligence of it with the utmost possible surprise,\r\nindignation, and alarm.\r\n\r\nSo for from being previously apprised of the transaction from its\r\norigin, it was two years before the Court of Directors obtained any\r\nofficial intelligence of it. \"The dealings of the servants with the\r\nNabob were concealed from the first, until they were found out\" (says\r\nMr. Sayer, the Company's counsel) \"by the report of the country.\" The\r\nPresidency, however, at last thought proper to send an official account.\r\nOn this the Directors tell them, \"To your great reproach, it has been\r\n_concealed from us_. We cannot but suspect this debt to have had its\r\nweight in _your proposed aggrandizement of Mahomed Ali_ [the Nabob of\r\nArcot]; but whether it has or has not, certain it is you are guilty of\r\nan high breach of duty in _concealing_ it from us.\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions, concerning the ground of the transaction, its effect,\r\nand its clandestine nature, are in the letters bearing date March 17,\r\n1769. After receiving a more full account, on the 23d March, 1770, they\r\nstate, that \"Messrs. John Pybus, John Call, and James Bourchier, as\r\ntrustees for themselves and others of the Nabob's private creditors, had\r\nproved a deed of assignment upon the Nabob and his son of FIFTEEN\r\ndistricts of the Nabob's country, the revenues of which yielded, in time\r\nof peace, eight lacs of pagodas [320,000_l._ sterling] annually; and\r\nlikewise an assignment of the yearly tribute paid the Nabob from the\r\nRajah of Tanjore, amounting to four lacs of rupees [40,000_l._].\" The\r\nterritorial revenue at that time possessed by these gentlemen, without\r\nthe knowledge or consent of their masters, amounted to three hundred and\r\nsixty thousand pounds sterling annually. They were making rapid strides\r\nto the entire possession of the country, when the Directors, whom the\r\nright honorable gentleman states as having authorized these\r\nproceedings, were kept in such profound ignorance of this royal\r\nacquisition of territorial revenue by their servants, that in the same\r\nletter they say, \"This assignment was obtained by _three of the members\r\nof your board_ in January, 1767; yet we do not find the _least trace_ of\r\nit upon your Consultations until August, 1768, nor do any of your\r\nletters to us afford any information relative to such transactions till\r\nthe 1st of November, 1768. By your last letters of the 8th of May, 1769,\r\nyou bring the whole proceedings to light in one view.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the previous knowledge of the Company, and its sanction to the\r\ndebts, you see that this assertion of that knowledge is utterly\r\nunfounded. But did the Directors approve of it, and ratify the\r\ntransaction, when it was known? The very reverse. On the same 3d of\r\nMarch, the Directors declare, \"upon an _impartial examination_ of the\r\nwhole conduct of our late Governor and Council of Fort George [Madras],\r\nand on the fullest consideration, that the said Governor and Council\r\nhave, _in notorious violation of the trust_ reposed in them, manifestly\r\n_preferred the interest of private individuals to that of the Company_,\r\nin permitting the assignment of the revenues of certain valuable\r\ndistricts, to a very large amount, from the Nabob to individuals\"; and\r\nthen, highly aggravating their crimes, they add,--\"We order and direct\r\nthat you do examine, in the most impartial manner, all the\r\nabove-mentioned transactions, and that you _punish_, by suspension,\r\ndegradation, dismission, or otherwise, as to you shall seem meet, all\r\nand every such servant or servants of the Company who may by you be\r\nfound guilty of any of the above offences.\" \"We had\" (say the\r\nDirectors) \"the mortification to find that the servants of the Company,\r\nwho had been _raised, supported, and owed their present opulence to the\r\nadvantages_ gained in such service, have in this instance most\r\n_unfaithfully betrayed_ their trust, _abandoned_ the Company's interest,\r\nand _prostituted_ its influence to accomplish the _purposes of\r\nindividuals, whilst the interest of the Company is almost wholly\r\nneglected_, and payment to us rendered extremely precarious.\" Here,\r\nthen, is the rock of approbation of the Court of Directors, on which the\r\nright honorable gentleman says this debt was founded. Any member, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, who should come into the House, on my reading this sentence of\r\ncondemnation of the Court of Directors against their unfaithful\r\nservants, might well imagine that he had heard an harsh, severe,\r\nunqualified invective against the present ministerial Board of Control.\r\nSo exactly do the proceedings of the patrons of this abuse tally with\r\nthose of the actors in it, that the expressions used in the condemnation\r\nof the one may serve for the reprobation of the other, without the\r\nchange of a word.\r\n\r\nTo read you all the expressions of wrath and indignation fulminated in\r\nthis dispatch against the meritorious creditors of the right honorable\r\ngentleman, who according to him have been so fully approved by the\r\nCompany, would be to read the whole.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman, with an address peculiar to himself,\r\nevery now and then slides in the Presidency of Madras, as synonymous to\r\nthe Company. That the Presidency did approve the debt is certain. But\r\nthe right honorable gentleman, as prudent in suppressing as skilful in\r\nbringing forward his matter, has not chosen to tell you that the\r\nPresidency were the very persons guilty of contracting this\r\nloan,--creditors themselves, and agents and trustees for all the other\r\ncreditors. For this the Court of Directors accuse them of breach of\r\ntrust; and for this the right honorable gentleman considers them as\r\nperfectly good authority for those claims. It is pleasant to hear a\r\ngentleman of the law quote the approbation of creditors as an authority\r\nfor their own debt.\r\n\r\nHow they came to contract the debt to themselves, how they came to act\r\nas agents for those whom they ought to have controlled, is for your\r\ninquiry. The policy of this debt was announced to the Court of Directors\r\nby the very persons concerned in creating it. \"Till very lately,\" say\r\nthe Presidency, \"the Nabob placed his dependence on the Company. Now he\r\nhas been taught by ill advisers that an interest out of doors may stand\r\nhim in good stead. He has been made to believe that _his private\r\ncreditors have power and interest to overrule the Court of\r\nDirectors_.\"[10] The Nabob was not misinformed. The private creditors\r\ninstantly qualified a vast number of votes; and having made themselves\r\nmasters of the Court of Proprietors, as well as extending a powerful\r\ncabal in other places as important, they so completely overturned the\r\nauthority of the Court of Directors at home and abroad, that this poor,\r\nbaffled government was soon obliged to lower its tone. It was glad to be\r\nadmitted into partnership with its own servants. The Court of\r\nDirectors, establishing the debt which they had reprobated as a breach\r\nof trust, and which was planned for the subversion of their authority,\r\nsettled its payments on a par with those of the public; and even so were\r\nnot able to obtain peace, or even equality in their demands. All the\r\nconsequences lay in a regular and irresistible train. By employing their\r\ninfluence for the recovery of this debt, their orders, issued in the\r\nsame breath, against creating new debts, only animated the strong\r\ndesires of their servants to this prohibited prolific sport, and it soon\r\nproduced a swarm of sons and daughters, not in the least degenerated\r\nfrom the virtue of their parents.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the authority of the Court of Directors expired in the\r\nCarnatic, and everywhere else. \"Every man,\" says the Presidency, \"who\r\nopposes the government and its measures, finds an immediate countenance\r\nfrom the Nabob; even our discarded officers, however unworthy, are\r\nreceived into the Nabob's service.\"[11] It was, indeed, a matter of no\r\nwonderful sagacity to determine whether the Court of Directors, with\r\ntheir miserable salaries to their servants, of four or five hundred\r\npounds a year, or the distributor of millions, was most likely to be\r\nobeyed. It was an invention beyond the imagination of all the\r\nspeculatists of our speculating age, to see a government quietly settled\r\nin one and the same town, composed of two distinct members: one to pay\r\nscantily for obedience, and the other to bribe high for rebellion and\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nThe next thing which recommends this particular debt to the right\r\nhonorable gentleman is, it seems, the moderate interest of ten per cent.\r\nIt would be lost labor to observe on this assertion. The Nabob, in a\r\nlong apologetic letter[12] for the transaction between him and the body\r\nof the creditors, states the fact as I shall state it to you. In the\r\naccumulation of this debt, the first interest paid was from thirty to\r\nthirty-six per cent; it was then brought down to twenty-five per cent;\r\nat length it was reduced to twenty; and there it found its rest. During\r\nthe whole process, as often as any of these monstrous interests fell\r\ninto an arrear, (into which they were continually falling,) the arrear,\r\nformed into a new capital,[13] was added to the old, and the same\r\ninterest of twenty per cent accrued upon both. The Company, having got\r\nsome scent of the enormous usury which prevailed at Madras, thought it\r\nnecessary to interfere, and to order all interests to be lowered to ten\r\nper cent. This order, which contained no exception, though it by no\r\nmeans pointed particularly to this class of debts, came like a\r\nthunderclap on the Nabob. He considered his political credit as ruined;\r\nbut to find a remedy to this unexpected evil, he again added to the old\r\nprincipal twenty per cent interest accruing for the last year. Thus a\r\nnew fund was formed; and it was on that accumulation of various\r\nprincipals, and interests heaped upon interests, not on the sum\r\noriginally lent, as the right honorable gentleman would make you\r\nbelieve, that ten per cent was settled on the whole.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider the enormity of the interest at which these debts were\r\ncontracted, and the several interests added to the principal, I believe\r\nyou will not think me so skeptical, if I should doubt whether for this\r\ndebt of 880,000_l._ the Nabob ever saw 100,000_l._ in real money. The\r\nright honorable gentleman suspecting, with all his absolute dominion\r\nover fact, that he never will be able to defend even this venerable\r\npatriarchal job, though sanctified by its numerous issue, and hoary with\r\nprescriptive years, has recourse to recrimination, the last resource of\r\nguilt. He says that this loan of 1767 was provided for in Mr. Fox's\r\nIndia bill; and judging of others by his own nature and principles, he\r\nmore than insinuates that this provision was made, not from any sense of\r\nmerit in the claim, but from partiality to General Smith, a proprietor,\r\nand an agent for that debt. If partiality could have had any weight\r\nagainst justice and policy with the then ministers and their friends,\r\nGeneral Smith had titles to it. But the right honorable gentleman knows\r\nas well as I do, that General Smith was very far from looking on himself\r\nas partially treated in the arrangements of that time; indeed, what man\r\ndared to hope for private partiality in that sacred plan for relief to\r\nnations?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the right honorable gentleman should\r\nsarcastically call that time to our recollection. Well do I remember\r\nevery circumstance of that memorable period. God forbid I should forget\r\nit! O illustrious disgrace! O victorious defeat! May your memorial be\r\nfresh and new to the latest generations! May the day of that generous\r\nconflict be stamped in characters never to be cancelled or worn out from\r\nthe records of time! Let no man hear of us, who shall not hear, that, in\r\na struggle against the intrigues of courts and the perfidious levity of\r\nthe multitude, we fell in the cause of honor, in the cause of our\r\ncountry, in the cause of human nature itself! But if fortune should be\r\nas powerful over fame as she has been prevalent over virtue, at least\r\nour conscience is beyond her jurisdiction. My poor share in the support\r\nof that great measure no man shall ravish from me. It shall be safely\r\nlodged in the sanctuary of my heart,--never, never to be torn from\r\nthence, but with those holds that grapple it to life.\r\n\r\nI say, I well remember that bill, and every one of its honest and its\r\nwise provisions. It is not true that this debt was ever protected or\r\nenforced, or any revenue whatsoever set apart for it. It was left in\r\nthat bill just where it stood: to be paid or not to be paid out of the\r\nNabob's private treasures, according to his own discretion. The Company\r\nhad actually given it their sanction, though always relying for its\r\nvalidity on the sole security of the faith of him[14] who without their\r\nknowledge or consent entered into the original obligation. It had no\r\nother sanction; it ought to have had no other. So far was Mr. Fox's bill\r\nfrom providing _funds_ for it, as this ministry have wickedly done for\r\nthis, and for ten times worse transactions, out of the public estate,\r\nthat an express clause immediately preceded, positively forbidding any\r\nBritish subject from receiving assignments upon any part of the\r\nterritorial revenue, on any pretence whatsoever.[15]\r\n\r\nYou recollect, Mr. Speaker, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nstrongly professed to retain every part of Mr. Fox's bill which was\r\nintended to prevent abuse; but in _his_ India bill, which (let me do\r\njustice) is as able and skilful a performance, for its own purposes, as\r\never issued from the wit of man, premeditating this iniquity,--\r\n\r\n    Hoc ipsum ut strueret, Trojamque aperiret Achivis,--\r\n\r\nexpunged this essential clause, broke down the fence which was raised to\r\ncover the public property against the rapacity of his partisans, and\r\nthus levelling every obstruction, he made a firm, broad highway for sin\r\nand death, for usury and oppression, to renew their ravages throughout\r\nthe devoted revenues of the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nThe tenor, the policy, and the consequences of this debt of 1767 are in\r\nthe eyes of ministry so excellent, that its merits are irresistible; and\r\nit takes the lead to give credit and countenance to all the rest. Along\r\nwith this chosen body of heavy-armed infantry, and to support it in the\r\nline, the right honorable gentleman has stationed his corps of black\r\ncavalry. If there be any advantage between this debt and that of 1769,\r\naccording to him the cavalry debt has it. It is not a subject of\r\ndefence: it is a theme of panegyric. Listen to the right honorable\r\ngentleman, and you will find it was contracted to save the country,--to\r\nprevent mutiny in armies,--to introduce economy in revenues; and for\r\nall these honorable purposes, it originated at the express desire and by\r\nthe representative authority of the Company itself.\r\n\r\nFirst let me say a word to the authority. This debt was contracted, not\r\nby the authority of the Company, not by its representatives, (as the\r\nright honorable gentleman has the unparalleled confidence to assert,)\r\nbut in the ever-memorable period of 1777, by the usurped power of those\r\nwho rebelliously, in conjunction with the Nabob of Arcot, had overturned\r\nthe lawful government of Madras. For that rebellion this House\r\nunanimously directed a public prosecution. The delinquents, after they\r\nhad subverted government, in order to make to themselves a party to\r\nsupport them in their power, are universally known to have dealt jobs\r\nabout to the right and to the left, and to any who were willing to\r\nreceive them. This usurpation, which the right honorable gentleman well\r\nknows was brought about by and for the great mass of these pretended\r\ndebts, is the authority which is set up by him to represent the\r\nCompany,--to represent that Company which, from the first moment of\r\ntheir hearing of this corrupt and fraudulent transaction to this hour,\r\nhave uniformly disowned and disavowed it.\r\n\r\nSo much for the authority. As to the facts, partly true, and partly\r\ncolorable, as they stand recorded, they are in substance these. The\r\nNabob of Arcot, as soon as he had thrown off the superiority of this\r\ncountry by means of these creditors, kept up a great army which he never\r\npaid. Of course his soldiers were generally in a state of mutiny.[16]\r\nThe usurping Council say that they labored hard with their master, the\r\nNabob, to persuade him to reduce these mutinous and useless troops. He\r\nconsented; but, as usual, pleaded inability to pay them their arrears.\r\nHere was a difficulty. The Nabob had no money; the Company had no money;\r\nevery public supply was empty. But there was one resource which no\r\nseason has ever yet dried up in that climate. The _soucars_ were at\r\nhand: that is, private English money-jobbers offered their assistance.\r\nMessieurs Taylor, Majendie, and Call proposed to advance the small sum\r\nof 160,000_l._ to pay off the Nabob's black cavalry, provided the\r\nCompany's authority was given for their loan. This was the great point\r\nof policy always aimed at, and pursued through a hundred devices by the\r\nservants at Madras. The Presidency, who themselves had no authority for\r\nthe functions they presumed to exercise, very readily gave the sanction\r\nof the Company to those servants who knew that the Company, whose\r\nsanction was demanded, had positively prohibited all such transactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, so far as the reality of the dealing goes, all is hitherto fair\r\nand plausible; and here the right honorable gentleman concludes, with\r\ncommendable prudence, his account of the business. But here it is I\r\nshall beg leave to commence my supplement: for the gentleman's discreet\r\nmodesty has led him to cut the thread of the story somewhat abruptly.\r\nOne of the most essential parties is quite forgotten. Why should the\r\nepisode of the poor Nabob be omitted? When that prince chooses it,\r\nnobody can tell his story better. Excuse me, if I apply again to my\r\nbook, and give it you from the first hand: from the Nabob himself.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stratton became acquainted with this, and got Mr. Taylor and\r\nothers to lend me four lacs of pagodas towards discharging the arrears\r\nof pay of my troops. Upon this, I wrote a letter of thanks to Mr.\r\nStratton; and upon the faith of this money being paid immediately, I\r\nordered many of my troops to be discharged by a certain day, and\r\nlessened the number of my servants. Mr. Taylor, &c., some time after\r\nacquainted me, that they had no ready money, but they would grant teeps\r\npayable in four months. This astonished me; for I did not know what\r\nmight happen, when the sepoys were dismissed from my service. I begged\r\nof Mr. Taylor and the others to pay this sum to the officers of my\r\nregiments at the time they mentioned; and desired the officers, at the\r\nsame time, to pacify and persuade the men belonging to them that their\r\npay would be given to them _at the end of four months_, and that, till\r\nthose arrears were discharged, their pay should be continued to them.\r\n_Two years_ are nearly expired since that time, but Mr. Taylor has not\r\nyet entirely discharged the arrears of those troops, and I am obliged to\r\ncontinue their pay from that time till this. I hoped to have been able,\r\nby this expedient, to have lessened the number of my troops, and\r\ndischarged the arrears due to them, considering the trifle of interest\r\nto Mr. Taylor and the others as no great matter; but instead of this, _I\r\nam oppressed with the burden of pay due to those troops, and the\r\ninterest, which is going on to Mr. Taylor from the day the teeps were\r\ngranted to him_.\" What I have read to you is an extract of a letter from\r\nthe Nabob of the Carnatic to Governor Rumbold, dated the 22d, and\r\nreceived the 24th of March, 1779.[17]\r\n\r\nSuppose his Highness not to be well broken in to things of this kind,\r\nit must, indeed, surprise so known and established a bond-vender as the\r\nNabob of Arcot, one who keeps himself the largest bond-warehouse in the\r\nworld, to find that he was now to receive in kind: not to take money for\r\nhis obligations, but to give his bond in exchange for the bond of\r\nMessieurs Taylor, Majendie, and Call, and to pay, besides, a good, smart\r\ninterest, legally twelve per cent, (in reality, perhaps, twenty or\r\ntwenty-four per cent,) for this exchange of paper. But his troops were\r\nnot to be so paid, or so disbanded. They wanted bread, and could not\r\nlive by cutting and shuffling of bonds. The Nabob still kept the troops\r\nin service, and was obliged to continue, as you have seen, the whole\r\nexpense to exonerate himself from which he became indebted to the\r\nsoucars.\r\n\r\nHad it stood here, the transaction would have been of the most audacious\r\nstrain of fraud and usury perhaps ever before discovered, whatever might\r\nhave been practised and concealed. But the same authority (I mean the\r\nNabob's) brings before you something, if possible, more striking. He\r\nstates, that, for this their paper, he immediately handed over to these\r\ngentlemen something very different from paper,--that is, the receipt of\r\na territorial revenue, of which, it seems, they continued as long in\r\npossession as the Nabob himself continued in possession of anything.\r\nTheir payments, therefore, not being to commence before the end of four\r\nmonths, and not being completed in two years, it must be presumed\r\n(unless they prove the contrary) that their payments to the Nabob were\r\nmade out of the revenues they had received from his assignment. Thus\r\nthey condescended to accumulate a debt of 160,000_l._ with an interest\r\nof twelve per cent, in compensation for a lingering payment to the\r\nNabob of 160,000_l._ of his own money.\r\n\r\nStill we have not the whole. About two years after the assignment of\r\nthose territorial revenues to these gentlemen, the Nabob receives a\r\nremonstrance from his chief manager in a principal province, of which\r\nthis is the tenor. \"The _entire_ revenue of those districts is by your\r\nHighness's order set apart to discharge the tunkaws [assignments]\r\ngranted to the Europeans. The gomastahs [agents] of Mr. Taylor to Mr. De\r\nFries are there in order to collect those tunkaws; and as they receive\r\n_all_ the revenue that is collected, your Highness's troops have _seven\r\nor eight months' pay due_, which they cannot receive, and are thereby\r\nreduced to the greatest _distress_. _In such times_ it is highly\r\nnecessary to provide for the sustenance of the troops, that they may be\r\nready to exert themselves in the service of your Highness.\"\r\n\r\nHere, Sir, you see how these causes and effects act upon one another.\r\nOne body of troops mutinies for want of pay; a debt is contracted to pay\r\nthem; and they still remain unpaid. A territory destined to pay other\r\ntroops is assigned for this debt; and these other troops fall into the\r\nsame state of indigence and mutiny with the first. Bond is paid by bond;\r\narrear is turned into new arrear; usury engenders new usury; mutiny,\r\nsuspended in one quarter, starts up in another; until all the revenues\r\nand all the establishments are entangled into one inextricable knot of\r\nconfusion, from which they are only disengaged by being entirely\r\ndestroyed. In that state of confusion, in a very few months after the\r\ndate of the memorial I have just read to you, things were found, when\r\nthe Nabob's troops, famished to feed English soucars, instead of\r\ndefending the country, joined the invaders, and deserted in entire\r\nbodies to Hyder Ali.[18]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this transaction was carried on shows that good\r\nexamples are not easily forgot, especially by those who are bred in a\r\ngreat school. One of those splendid examples give me leave to mention,\r\nat a somewhat more early period; because one fraud furnishes light to\r\nthe discovery of another, and so on, until the whole secret of\r\nmysterious iniquity bursts upon you in a blaze of detection. The paper I\r\nshall read you is not on record. If you please, you may take it on my\r\nword. It is a letter written from one of undoubted information in Madras\r\nto Sir John Clavering, describing the practice that prevailed there,\r\nwhilst the Company's allies were under sale, during the time of Governor\r\nWinch's administration.\r\n\r\n\"One mode,\" says Clavering's correspondent, \"of amassing money at the\r\nNabob's cost is curious. He is generally in arrears to the Company. Here\r\nthe Governor, being cash-keeper, is generally on good terms with the\r\nbanker, who manages matters thus. The Governor presses the Nabob for the\r\nbalance due from him; the Nabob flies to his banker for relief; the\r\nbanker engages to pay the money, and grants his notes accordingly, which\r\nhe puts in the cash-book as ready money; the Nabob pays him an interest\r\nfor it at two and three per cent _per mensem_, till the tunkaws he\r\ngrants on the particular districts for it are paid. Matters in the mean\r\ntime are so managed that there is no call for this money for the\r\nCompany's service till the tunkaws become due. By this means not a cash\r\nis advanced by the banker, though he receives a heavy interest from the\r\nNabob, which is divided as lawful spoil.\"\r\n\r\nHere, Mr. Speaker, you have the whole art and mystery, the true\r\nfree-mason secret, of the profession of _soucaring_; by which a few\r\ninnocent, inexperienced young Englishmen, such as Mr. Paul Benfield, for\r\ninstance, without property upon which any one would lend to themselves a\r\nsingle shilling, are enabled at once to take provinces in mortgage, to\r\nmake princes their debtors, and to become creditors for millions.\r\n\r\nBut it seems the right honorable gentleman's favorite soucar cavalry\r\nhave proved the payment before the Mayor's Court at Madras! Have they\r\nso? Why, then, defraud our anxiety and their characters of that proof?\r\nIs it not enough that the charges which I have laid before you have\r\nstood on record against these poor injured gentlemen for eight years? Is\r\nit not enough that they are in print by the orders of the East India\r\nCompany for five years? After these gentlemen have borne all the odium\r\nof this publication and all the indignation of the Directors with such\r\nunexampled equanimity, now that they are at length stimulated into\r\nfeeling are you to deny them their just relief? But will the right\r\nhonorable gentleman be pleased to tell us how they came not to give this\r\nsatisfaction to the Court of Directors, their lawful masters, during all\r\nthe eight years of this litigated claim? Were they not bound, by every\r\ntie that can bind man, to give them this satisfaction? This day, for the\r\nfirst time, we hear of the proofs. But when were these proofs offered?\r\nIn what cause? Who were the parties? Who inspected, who contested this\r\nbelated account? Let us see something to oppose to the body of record\r\nwhich appears against them. The Mayor's Court! the Mayor's Court!\r\nPleasant! Does not the honorable gentleman know that the first corps of\r\ncreditors (the creditors of 1767) stated it as a sort of hardship to\r\nthem, that they could not have justice at Madras, from the impossibility\r\nof their supporting their claims in the Mayor's Court? Why? Because, say\r\nthey, the members of that court were themselves creditors, and therefore\r\ncould not sit as judges.[19] Are we ripe to say that no creditor under\r\nsimilar circumstances was member of the court, when the payment which is\r\nthe ground of this cavalry debt was put in proof?[20] Nay, are we not in\r\na manner compelled to conclude that the court was so constituted, when\r\nwe know there is scarcely a man in Madras who has not some participation\r\nin these transactions? It is a shame to hear such proofs mentioned,\r\ninstead of the honest, vigorous scrutiny which the circumstances of such\r\nan affair so indispensably call for.\r\n\r\nBut his Majesty's ministers, indulgent enough to other scrutinies, have\r\nnot been satisfied with authorizing the payment of this demand without\r\nsuch inquiry as the act has prescribed; but they have added the arrear\r\nof twelve per cent interest, from the year 1777 to the year 1784, to\r\nmake a new capital, raising thereby 160 to 294,000_l._ Then they charge\r\na new twelve per cent on the whole from that period, for a transaction\r\nin which it will be a miracle if a single penny will be ever found\r\nreally advanced from the private stock of the pretended creditors.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, and at such an interest, the ministers have thought\r\nproper to dispose of 294,000_l._ of the public revenues, for what is\r\ncalled the Cavalry Loan. After dispatching this, the right honorable\r\ngentleman leads to battle his last grand division, the consolidated debt\r\nof 1777. But having exhausted all his panegyric on the two first, he has\r\nnothing at all to say in favor of the last. On the contrary, he admits\r\nthat it was contracted in defiance of the Company's orders, without even\r\nthe pretended sanction of any pretended representatives. Nobody, indeed,\r\nhas yet been found hardy enough to stand forth avowedly in its defence.\r\nBut it is little to the credit of the age, that what has not\r\nplausibility enough to find an advocate has influence enough to obtain a\r\nprotector. Could any man expect to find that protector anywhere? But\r\nwhat must every man think, when he finds that protector in the chairman\r\nof the Committee of Secrecy[21], who had published to the House, and to\r\nthe world, the facts that condemn these debts, the orders that forbid\r\nthe incurring of them, the dreadful consequences which attended them?\r\nEven in his official letter, when he tramples on his Parliamentary\r\nreport, yet his general language is the same. Read the preface to this\r\npart of the ministerial arrangement, and you would imagine that this\r\ndebt was to be crushed, with all the weight of indignation which could\r\nfall from a vigilant guardian of the public treasury upon those who\r\nattempted to rob it. What must be felt by every man who has feeling,\r\nwhen, after such a thundering preamble of condemnation, this debt is\r\nordered to be paid without any sort of inquiry into its\r\nauthenticity,--without a single step taken to settle even the amount of\r\nthe demand,--without an attempt so much as to ascertain the real persons\r\nclaiming a sum which rises in the accounts from one million three\r\nhundred thousand pound sterling to two million four hundred thousand\r\npound, principal money,[22]--without an attempt made to ascertain the\r\nproprietors, of whom no list has ever yet been laid before the Court of\r\nDirectors,--of proprietors who are known to be in a collusive shuffle,\r\nby which they never appear to be the same in any two lists handed about\r\nfor their own particular purposes?\r\n\r\nMy honorable friend who made you the motion has sufficiently exposed the\r\nnature of this debt. He has stated to you, that _its own agents_, in the\r\nyear 1781, in the arrangement _they proposed_ to make at Calcutta, were\r\nsatisfied to have twenty-five per cent at once struck off from the\r\ncapital of a great part of this debt, and prayed to have a provision\r\nmade for this reduced principal, without any interest at all. This was\r\nan arrangement of _their own_, an arrangement made by those who best\r\nknew the true constitution of their own debt, who knew how little favor\r\nit merited,[23] and how little hopes they had to find any persons in\r\nauthority abandoned enough to support it as it stood.\r\n\r\nBut what corrupt men, in the fond imaginations of a sanguine avarice,\r\nhad not the confidence to propose, they have found a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer in England hardy enough to undertake for them. He has cheered\r\ntheir drooping spirits. He has thanked the peculators for not despairing\r\nof their commonwealth. He has told them they were too modest. He has\r\nreplaced the twenty-five per cent which, in order to lighten themselves,\r\nthey had abandoned in their conscious terror. Instead of cutting off the\r\ninterest, as they had themselves consented to do, with the fourth of the\r\ncapital, he has added the whole growth of four years' usury of twelve\r\nper cent to the first overgrown principal; and has again grafted on this\r\nmeliorated stock a perpetual annuity of six per cent, to take place from\r\nthe year 1781. Let no man hereafter talk of the decaying energies of\r\nNature. All the acts and monuments in the records of peculation, the\r\nconsolidated corruption of ages, the patterns of exemplary plunder in\r\nthe heroic times of Roman iniquity, never equalled the gigantic\r\ncorruption of this single act. Never did Nero, in all the insolent\r\nprodigality of despotism, deal out to his prætorian guards a donation\r\nfit to be named with the largess showered down by the bounty of our\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer on the faithful band of his Indian sepoys.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman[24] lets you freely and voluntarily into\r\nthe whole transaction. So perfectly has his conduct confounded his\r\nunderstanding, that he fairly tells you that through the course of the\r\nwhole business he has never conferred with any but the agents of the\r\npretended creditors. After this, do you want more to establish a secret\r\nunderstanding with the parties,--to fix, beyond a doubt, their collusion\r\nand participation in a common fraud?\r\n\r\nIf this were not enough, he has furnished you with other presumptions\r\nthat are not to be shaken. It is one of the known indications of guilt\r\nto stagger and prevaricate in a story, and to vary in the motives that\r\nare assigned to conduct. Try these ministers by this rule. In their\r\nofficial dispatch, they tell the Presidency of Madras that they have\r\nestablished the debt for two reasons: first, because the Nabob (the\r\nparty indebted) does not dispute it; secondly, because it is mischievous\r\nto keep it longer afloat, and that the payment of the European creditors\r\nwill promote circulation in the country. These two motives (for the\r\nplainest reasons in the world) the right honorable gentleman has this\r\nday thought fit totally to abandon. In the first place, he rejects the\r\nauthority of the Nabob of Arcot. It would, indeed, be pleasant to see\r\nhim adhere to this exploded testimony. He next, upon grounds equally\r\nsolid, abandons the benefits of that circulation which was to be\r\nproduced by drawing out all the juices of the body. Laying aside, or\r\nforgetting, these pretences of his dispatch, he has just now assumed a\r\nprinciple totally different, but to the full as extraordinary. He\r\nproceeds upon a supposition that many of the claims may be fictitious.\r\nHe then finds, that, in a case where many valid and many fraudulent\r\nclaims are blended together, the best course for their discrimination is\r\nindiscriminately to establish them all. He trusts, (I suppose,) as there\r\nmay not be a fund sufficient for every description of creditors, that\r\nthe best warranted claimants will exert themselves in bringing to light\r\nthose debts which will not bear an inquiry. What he will not do himself\r\nhe is persuaded will be done by others; and for this purpose he leaves\r\nto any person a general power of excepting to the debt. This total\r\nchange of language and prevarication in principle is enough, if it stood\r\nalone, to fix the presumption of unfair dealing. His dispatch assigns\r\nmotives of policy, concord, trade, and circulation: his speech proclaims\r\ndiscord and litigations, and proposes, as the ultimate end, detection.\r\n\r\nBut he may shift his reasons, and wind and turn as he will, confusion\r\nwaits him at all his doubles. Who will undertake this detection? Will\r\nthe Nabob? But the right honorable gentleman has himself this moment\r\ntold us that no prince of the country can by any motive be prevailed\r\nupon to discover any fraud that is practised upon him by the Company's\r\nservants. He says what (with the exception of the complaint against the\r\nCavalry Loan) all the world knows to be true: and without that prince's\r\nconcurrence, what evidence can be had of the fraud of any the smallest\r\nof these demands? The ministers never authorized any person to enter\r\ninto his exchequer and to search his records. Why, then, this shameful\r\nand insulting mockery of a pretended contest? Already contests for a\r\npreference have arisen among these rival bond-creditors. Has not the\r\nCompany itself struggled for a preference for years, without any attempt\r\nat detection of the nature of those debts with which they contended?\r\nWell is the Nabob of Arcot attended to in the only specific complaint he\r\nhas ever made. He complained of unfair dealing in the Cavalry Loan. It\r\nis fixed upon him with interest on interest; and this loan is excepted\r\nfrom all power of litigation.\r\n\r\nThis day, and not before, the right honorable gentleman thinks that the\r\ngeneral establishment of all claims is the surest way of laying open the\r\nfraud of some of them. In India this is a reach of deep policy. But what\r\nwould be thought of this mode of acting on a demand upon the Treasury in\r\nEngland? Instead of all this cunning, is there not one plain way\r\nopen,--that is, to put the burden of the proof on those who make the\r\ndemand? Ought not ministry to have said to the creditors, \"The person\r\nwho admits your debt stands excepted to as evidence; he stands charged\r\nas a collusive party, to hand over the public revenues to you for\r\nsinister purposes. You say, you have a demand of some millions on the\r\nIndian Treasury; prove that you have acted by lawful authority; prove,\r\nat least, that your money has been _bonâ fide_ advanced; entitle\r\nyourself to my protection by the fairness and fulness of the\r\ncommunications you make\"? Did an honest creditor ever refuse that\r\nreasonable and honest test?\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that several individuals have been seduced by the\r\npurveyors to the Nabob of Arcot to put their money (perhaps the whole of\r\nhonest and laborious earnings) into their hands, and that at such high\r\ninterest as, being condemned at law, leaves them at the mercy of the\r\ngreat managers whom they trusted. These seduced creditors are probably\r\npersons of no power or interest either in England or India, and may be\r\njust objects of compassion. By taking, in this arrangement, no measures\r\nfor discrimination and discovery, the fraudulent and the fair are in the\r\nfirst instance confounded in one mass. The subsequent selection and\r\ndistribution is left to the Nabob. With him the agents and instruments\r\nof his corruption, whom he sees to be omnipotent in England, and who may\r\nserve him in future, as they have done in times past, will have\r\nprecedence, if not an exclusive preference. These leading interests\r\ndomineer, and have always domineered, over the whole. By this\r\narrangement, the persons seduced are made dependent on their seducers;\r\nhonesty (comparative honesty at least) must become of the party of\r\nfraud, and must quit its proper character and its just claims, to\r\nentitle itself to the alms of bribery and peculation.\r\n\r\nBut be these English creditors what they may, the creditors most\r\ncertainly not fraudulent are the natives, who are numerous and wretched\r\nindeed: by exhausting the whole revenues of the Carnatic, nothing is\r\nleft for them. They lent _bonâ fide_; in all probability they were even\r\nforced to lend, or to give goods and service for the Nabob's\r\nobligations. They had no trusts to carry to his market. They had no\r\nfaith of alliances to sell. They had no nations to betray to robbery and\r\nruin. They had no lawful government seditiously to overturn; nor had\r\nthey a governor, to whom it is owing that you exist in India, to deliver\r\nover to captivity, and to death in a shameful prison.[25]\r\n\r\nThese were the merits of the principal part of the debt of 1777, and the\r\nuniversally conceived causes of its growth; and thus the unhappy natives\r\nare deprived of every hope of payment for their real debts, to make\r\nprovision for the arrears of unsatisfied bribery and treason. You see in\r\nthis instance that the presumption of guilt is not only no exception to\r\nthe demands on the public treasury, but with these ministers it is a\r\nnecessary condition to their support. But that you may not think this\r\npreference solely owing to their known contempt of the natives, who\r\nought with every generous mind to claim their first charities, you will\r\nfind the same rule religiously observed with Europeans too. Attend, Sir,\r\nto this decisive case. Since the beginning of the war, besides arrears\r\nof every kind, a bond-debt has been contracted at Madras, uncertain in\r\nits amount, but represented from four hundred thousand pound to a\r\nmillion sterling. It stands only at the low interest of eight per cent.\r\nOf the legal authority on which this debt was contracted, of its\r\npurposes for the very being of the state, of its publicity and fairness,\r\nno doubt has been entertained for a moment. For this debt no sort of\r\nprovision whatever has been made. It is rejected as an outcast, whilst\r\nthe whole undissipated attention of the minister has been employed for\r\nthe discharge of claims entitled to his favor by the merits we have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to find out, if possible, the amount of the whole of\r\nthose demands, in order to see how much, supposing the country in a\r\ncondition to furnish the fund, may remain to satisfy the public debt and\r\nthe necessary establishments. But I have been foiled in my attempt.\r\n\r\nAbout one fourth, that is, about 220,000_l._, of the loan of 1767\r\nremains unpaid. How much interest is in arrear I could never discover:\r\nseven or eight years' at least, which would make the whole of that debt\r\nabout 396,000_l._ This stock, which the ministers in their instructions\r\nto the Governor of Madras state as the least exceptionable, they have\r\nthought proper to distinguish by a marked severity, leaving it the only\r\none on which the interest is not added to the principal to beget a new\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Cavalry Loan, by the operation of the same authority, is made up to\r\n294,000_l._; and this 294,000_l._, made up of principal and interest, is\r\ncrowned with a new interest of twelve per cent.\r\n\r\nWhat the grand loan, the bribery loan of 1777, may be is amongst the\r\ndeepest mysteries of state. It is probably the first debt ever assuming\r\nthe title of Consolidation that did not express what the amount of the\r\nsum consolidated was. It is little less than a contradiction in terms.\r\nIn the debt of the year 1767 the sum was stated in the act of\r\nconsolidation, and made to amount to 880,000_l._ capital. When this\r\nconsolidation of 1777 was first announced at the Durbar, it was\r\nrepresented authentically at 2,400,000_l._ In that, or rather in a\r\nhigher state, Sir Thomas Rumbold found and condemned it.[26] It\r\nafterwards fell into such a terror as to sweat away a million of its\r\nweight at once; and it sunk to 1,400,000_l._[27] However, it never was\r\nwithout a resource for recruiting it to its old plumpness. There was a\r\nsort of floating debt of about four or five hundred thousand pounds more\r\nready to be added, as occasion should require.\r\n\r\nIn short, when you pressed this sensitive-plant, it always contracted\r\nits dimensions. When the rude hand of inquiry was withdrawn, it expanded\r\nin all the luxuriant vigor of its original vegetation. In the treaty of\r\n1781, the whole of the Nabob's debt to private Europeans is by Mr.\r\nSulivan, agent to the Nabob and his creditors, stated at 2,800,000_l._,\r\nwhich, if the Cavalry Loan and the remains of the debt of 1767 be\r\nsubtracted, leaves it nearly at the amount originally declared at the\r\nDurbar in 1777: but then there is a private instruction to Mr. Sulivan,\r\nwhich, it seems, will reduce it again to the lower standard of\r\n1,400,000_l._\r\n\r\nFailing in all my attempts, by a direct account, to ascertain the extent\r\nof the capital claimed, (where in all probability no capital was ever\r\nadvanced,) I endeavored, if possible, to discover it by the interest\r\nwhich was to be paid. For that purpose, I looked to the several\r\nagreements for assigning the territories of the Carnatic to secure the\r\nprincipal and interest of this debt. In one of them,[28] I found, in a\r\nsort of postscript, by way of an additional remark, (not in the body of\r\nthe obligation,) the debt represented at 1,400,000_l._: but when I\r\ncomputed the sums to be paid for interest by instalments in another\r\npaper, I found they produced an interest of two millions, at twelve per\r\ncent; and the assignment supposed, that, if these instalments might\r\nexceed, they might also fall short of, the real provision for that\r\ninterest.[29] Another instalment-bond was afterwards granted: in that\r\nbond the interest exactly tallies with a capital of 1,400,000_l._:[30]\r\nbut pursuing this capital through the correspondence, I lost sight of it\r\nagain, and it was asserted that this instalment-bond was considerably\r\nshort of the interest that ought to be computed to the time\r\nmentioned.[31]\r\n\r\nHere are, therefore, two statements of equal authority, differing at\r\nleast a million from each other; and as neither persons claiming, nor\r\nany special sum as belonging to each particular claimant, is ascertained\r\nin the instruments of consolidation, or in the installment-bonds, a\r\nlarge scope was left to throw in any sums for any persons, as their\r\nmerits in advancing the interest of that loan might require; a power was\r\nalso left for reduction, in case a harder hand, or more scanty funds,\r\nmight be found to require it. Stronger grounds for a presumption of\r\nfraud never appeared in any transaction. But the ministers, faithful to\r\nthe plan of the interested persons, whom alone they thought fit to\r\nconfer with on this occasion, have ordered the payment of the whole mass\r\nof these unknown, unliquidated sums, without an attempt to ascertain\r\nthem. On this conduct, Sir, I leave you to make your own reflections.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible (at least I have found it impossible) to fix on the\r\nreal amount of the pretended debts with which your ministers have\r\nthought proper to load the Carnatic. They are obscure; they shun\r\ninquiry; they are enormous. That is all you know of them.\r\n\r\nThat you may judge what chance any honorable and useful end of\r\ngovernment has for a provision that comes in for the leavings of these\r\ngluttonous demands, I must take it on myself to bring before you the\r\nreal condition of that abused, insulted, racked, and ruined country;\r\nthough in truth my mind revolts from it, though you will hear it with\r\nhorror, and I confess I tremble when I think on these awful and\r\nconfounding dispensations of Providence. I shall first trouble you with\r\na few words as to the cause.\r\n\r\nThe great fortunes made in India, in the beginnings of conquest,\r\nnaturally excited an emulation in all the parts and through the whole\r\nsuccession of the Company's service. But in the Company it gave rise to\r\nother sentiments. They did not find the new channels of acquisition flow\r\nwith equal riches to them. On the contrary, the high flood-tide of\r\nprivate emolument was generally in the lowest ebb of their affairs. They\r\nbegan also to fear that the fortune of war might take away what the\r\nfortune of war had given. Wars were accordingly discouraged by repeated\r\ninjunctions and menaces: and that the servants might not be bribed into\r\nthem by the native princes, they were strictly forbidden to take any\r\nmoney whatsoever from their hands. But vehement passion is ingenious in\r\nresources. The Company's servants were not only stimulated, but better\r\ninstructed by the prohibition. They soon fell upon a contrivance which\r\nanswered their purposes far better than the methods which were\r\nforbidden: though in this also they violated an ancient, but they\r\nthought, an abrogated order. They reversed their proceedings. Instead of\r\nreceiving presents, they made loans. Instead of carrying on wars in\r\ntheir own name, they contrived an authority, at once irresistible and\r\nirresponsible, in whose name they might ravage at pleasure; and being\r\nthus freed from all restraint, they indulged themselves in the most\r\nextravagant speculations of plunder. The cabal of creditors who have\r\nbeen the object of the late bountiful grant from his Majesty's\r\nministers, in order to possess themselves, under the name of creditors\r\nand assignees, of every country in India, as fast as it should be\r\nconquered, inspired into the mind of the Nabob of Arcot (then a\r\ndependant on the Company of the humblest order) a scheme of the most\r\nwild and desperate ambition that I believe ever was admitted into the\r\nthoughts of a man so situated.[32] First, they persuaded him to\r\nconsider himself as a principal member in the political system of\r\nEurope. In the next place, they held out to him, and he readily imbibed,\r\nthe idea of the general empire of Hindostan. As a preliminary to this\r\nundertaking, they prevailed on him to propose a tripartite division of\r\nthat vast country: one part to the Company; another to the Mahrattas;\r\nand the third to himself. To himself he reserved all the southern part\r\nof the great peninsula, comprehended under the general name of the\r\nDeccan.\r\n\r\nOn this scheme of their servants, the Company was to appear in the\r\nCarnatic in no other light than as a contractor for the provision of\r\narmies, and the hire of mercenaries for his use and under his direction.\r\nThis disposition was to be secured by the Nabob's putting himself under\r\nthe guaranty of France, and, by the means of that rival nation,\r\npreventing the English forever from assuming an equality, much less a\r\nsuperiority, in the Carnatic. In pursuance of this treasonable project,\r\n(treasonable on the part of the English,) they extinguished the Company\r\nas a sovereign power in that part of India; they withdrew the Company's\r\ngarrisons out of all the forts and strongholds of the Carnatic; they\r\ndeclined to receive the ambassadors from foreign courts, and remitted\r\nthem to the Nabob of Arcot; they fell upon, and totally destroyed, the\r\noldest ally of the Company, the king of Tanjore, and plundered the\r\ncountry to the amount of near five millions sterling; one after\r\nanother, in the Nabob's name, but with English force, they brought into\r\na miserable servitude all the princes and great independent nobility of\r\na vast country.[33] In proportion to these treasons and violences, which\r\nruined the people, the fund of the Nabob's debt grew and flourished.\r\n\r\nAmong the victims to this magnificent plan of universal plunder, worthy\r\nof the heroic avarice of the projectors, you have all heard (and he has\r\nmade himself to be well remembered) of an Indian chief called Hyder Ali\r\nKhan. This man possessed the western, as the Company, under the name of\r\nthe Nabob of Arcot, does the eastern division of the Carnatic. It was\r\namong the leading measures in the design of this cabal (according to\r\ntheir own emphatic language) to _extirpate_ this Hyder Ali.[34] They\r\ndeclared the Nabob of Arcot to be his sovereign, and himself to be a\r\nrebel, and publicly invested their instrument with the sovereignty of\r\nthe kingdom of Mysore. But their victim was not of the passive kind.\r\nThey were soon obliged to conclude a treaty of peace and close alliance\r\nwith this rebel, at the gates of Madras. Both before and since that\r\ntreaty, every principle of policy pointed out this power as a natural\r\nalliance; and on his part it was courted by every sort of amicable\r\noffice. But the cabinet council of English creditors would not suffer\r\ntheir Nabob of Arcot to sign the treaty, nor even to give to a prince at\r\nleast his equal the ordinary titles of respect and courtesy.[35] From\r\nthat time forward, a continued plot was carried on within the divan,\r\nblack and white, of the Nabob of Arcot, for the destruction of Hyder\r\nAli. As to the outward members of the double, or rather treble\r\ngovernment of Madras, which had signed the treaty, they were always\r\nprevented by some overruling influence (which they do not describe, but\r\nwhich cannot be misunderstood) from performing what justice and interest\r\ncombined so evidently to enforce.[36]\r\n\r\nWhen at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either\r\nwould sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could bind,\r\nand who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself, he\r\ndecreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and\r\npredestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in\r\nthe gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the\r\nwhole Carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put\r\nperpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the\r\nfaith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no\r\nprotection. He became at length so confident of his force, so collected\r\nin his might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful\r\nresolution. Having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every\r\nrival, who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation\r\nagainst the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter\r\nwhatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of\r\ndestruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and\r\ndesolation into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities\r\nof the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and\r\nstupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their\r\nhorizon, it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole of its contents\r\nupon the plains of the Carnatic. Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of\r\nwhich no eye had seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can\r\nadequately tell. All the horrors of war before known or heard of were\r\nmercy to that new havoc. A storm of universal fire blasted every field,\r\nconsumed every house, destroyed every temple. The miserable inhabitants,\r\nflying from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others,\r\nwithout regard to sex, to age, to the respect of rank or sacredness of\r\nfunction, fathers torn from children, husbands from wives, enveloped in\r\na whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading spears of drivers, and\r\nthe trampling of pursuing horses, were swept into captivity in an\r\nunknown and hostile land. Those who were able to evade this tempest fled\r\nto the walled cities; but escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they\r\nfell into the jaws of famine.\r\n\r\nThe alms of the settlement, in this dreadful exigency, were certainly\r\nliberal; and all was done by charity that private charity could do: but\r\nit was a people in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out its\r\nhands for food. For months together, these creatures of sufferance,\r\nwhose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen\r\nshort of the allowance of our austerest fasts, silent, patient,\r\nresigned, without sedition or disturbance, almost without complaint,\r\nperished by an hundred a day in the streets of Madras; every day seventy\r\nat least laid their bodies in the streets or on the glacis of Tanjore,\r\nand expired of famine in the granary of India. I was going to awake your\r\njustice towards this unhappy part of our fellow-citizens, by bringing\r\nbefore you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger: of all\r\nthe calamities which beset and waylay the life of man, this comes the\r\nnearest to our heart, and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels\r\nhimself to be nothing more than he is: but I find myself unable to\r\nmanage it with decorum; these details are of a species of horror so\r\nnauseous and disgusting, they are so degrading to the sufferers and to\r\nthe hearers, they are so humiliating to human nature itself, that, on\r\nbetter thoughts, I find it more advisable to throw a pall over this\r\nhideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.\r\n\r\nFor eighteen months,[37] without intermission, this destruction raged\r\nfrom the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so completely did\r\nthese masters in their art, Hyder Ali and his more ferocious son,\r\nabsolve themselves of their impious vow, that, when the British armies\r\ntraversed, as they did, the Carnatic for hundreds of miles in all\r\ndirections, through the whole line of their march they did not see one\r\nman, not one woman, not one child, not one four-footed beast of any\r\ndescription whatever. One dead, uniform silence reigned over the whole\r\nregion. With the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of\r\nsome few forts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally. I mean to\r\nproduce to you more than three witnesses, above all exception, who will\r\nsupport this assertion in its full extent. That hurricane of war passed\r\nthrough every part of the central provinces of the Carnatic. Six or\r\nseven districts to the north and to the south (and these not wholly\r\nuntouched) escaped the general ravage.\r\n\r\nThe Carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to England. Figure\r\nto yourself, Mr. Speaker, the land in whose representative chair you\r\nsit; figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful\r\ncountry from Thames to Trent, north and south, and from the Irish to the\r\nGerman Sea, east and west, emptied and embowelled (may God avert the\r\nomen of our crimes!) by so accomplished a desolation. Extend your\r\nimagination a little further, and then suppose your ministers taking a\r\nsurvey of this scene of waste and desolation. What would be your\r\nthoughts, if you should be informed that they were computing how much\r\nhad been the amount of the excises, how much the customs, how much the\r\nland and malt tax, in order that they should charge (take it in the most\r\nfavorable light) for public service, upon the relics of the satiated\r\nvengeance of relentless enemies, the whole of what England had yielded\r\nin the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance? What would you\r\ncall it? To call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an\r\nimage; yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers\r\nat your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of\r\nthe Carnatic, when they were providing, not supply for the\r\nestablishments of its protection, but rewards for the authors of its\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nEvery day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant, \"The Carnatic\r\nis a country that will soon recover, and become instantly as prosperous\r\nas ever.\" They think they are talking to innocents, who will believe,\r\nthat, by sowing of dragons' teeth, men may come up ready grown and ready\r\narmed. They who will give themselves the trouble of considering (for it\r\nrequires no great reach of thought, no very profound knowledge) the\r\nmanner in which mankind are increased, and countries cultivated, will\r\nregard all this raving as it ought to be regarded. In order that the\r\npeople, after a long period of vexation and plunder, may be in a\r\ncondition to maintain government, government must begin by maintaining\r\nthem. Here the road to economy lies not through receipt, but through\r\nexpense; and in that country Nature has given no short cut to your\r\nobject. Men must propagate, like other animals, by the mouth. Never did\r\noppression light the nuptial torch; never did extortion and usury spread\r\nout the genial bed. Does any of you think that England, so wasted,\r\nwould, under such a nursing attendance, so rapidly and cheaply recover?\r\nBut he is meanly acquainted with either England or India who does not\r\nknow that England would a thousand times sooner resume population,\r\nfertility, and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both,\r\nrevenue, than such a country as the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nThe Carnatic is not by the bounty of Nature a fertile soil. The general\r\nsize of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise. It is some\r\ndays since I moved that a curious and interesting map, kept in the\r\nIndia House, should be laid before you.[38] The India House is not yet\r\nin readiness to send it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and\r\nthere it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter\r\nworthy of his attention. It is, indeed, a noble map, and of noble\r\nthings; but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine\r\nspeculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know must be\r\nthe case in every part of the world, (the necessity of a previous\r\nprovision of habitation, seed, stock, capital,) that map will show you\r\nthat the uses of the influences of Heaven itself are in that country a\r\nwork of art. The Carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or\r\nrunning streams, and it has rain only at a season; but its product of\r\nrice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command. This is the\r\nnational bank of the Carnatic, on which it must have a perpetual credit,\r\nor it perishes irretrievably. For that reason, in the happier times of\r\nIndia, a number, almost incredible, of reservoirs have been made in\r\nchosen places throughout the whole country: they are formed, for the\r\ngreater part, of mounds of earth and stones, with sluices of solid\r\nmasonry; the whole constructed with admirable skill and labor, and\r\nmaintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map\r\nalone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs, and they\r\namount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three\r\nacres to five miles in circuit. From these reservoirs currents are\r\noccasionally drawn over the fields, and these watercourses again call\r\nfor a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly\r\nlevelled. Taking the district in that map as a measure, there cannot be\r\nin the Carnatic and Tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs\r\nof the larger and middling dimensions, to say nothing of those for\r\ndomestic services, and the use of religious purification. These are not\r\nthe enterprises of your power, nor in a style of magnificence suited to\r\nthe taste of your minister. These are the monuments of real kings, who\r\nwere the fathers of their people,--testators to a posterity which they\r\nembraced as their own. These are the grand sepulchres built by\r\nambition,--but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not\r\ncontented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the\r\ncontracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and\r\ngraspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty\r\nbeyond the limits of Nature, and to perpetuate themselves through\r\ngenerations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the\r\nnourishers of mankind.\r\n\r\nLong before the late invasion, the persons who are objects of the grant\r\nof public money now before you had so diverted the supply of the pious\r\nfunds of culture and population, that everywhere the reservoirs were\r\nfallen into a miserable decay.[39] But after those domestic enemies had\r\nprovoked the entry of a cruel foreign foe into the country, he did not\r\nleave it, until his revenge had completed the destruction begun by their\r\navarice. Few, very few indeed, of these magazines of water that are not\r\neither totally destroyed, or cut through with such gaps as to require a\r\nserious attention and much cost to reëstablish them, as the means of\r\npresent subsistence to the people and of future revenue to the state.\r\n\r\nWhat, Sir, would a virtuous and enlightened ministry do, on the view of\r\nthe ruins of such works before them?--on the view of such a chasm of\r\ndesolation as that which yawned in the midst of those countries, to the\r\nnorth and south, which still bore some vestiges of cultivation? They\r\nwould have reduced all their most necessary establishments; they would\r\nhave suspended the justest payments; they would have employed every\r\nshilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers of the\r\nunproductive parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty,\r\nwhilst they were celebrating these mysteries of justice and humanity,\r\nthey would have told the corps of fictitious creditors, whose crimes\r\nwere their claims, that they must keep an awful distance,--that they\r\nmust silence their inauspicious tongues,--that they must hold off their\r\nprofane, unhallowed paws from this holy work; they would have\r\nproclaimed, with a voice that should make itself heard, that on every\r\ncountry the first creditor is the plough,--that this original,\r\nindefeasible claim supersedes every other demand.\r\n\r\nThis is what a wise and virtuous ministry would have done and said.\r\nThis, therefore, is what our minister could never think of saying or\r\ndoing. A ministry of another kind would have first improved the country,\r\nand have thus laid a solid foundation for future opulence and future\r\nforce. But on this grand point of the restoration of the country there\r\nis not one syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers,\r\nfrom the first to the last; they felt nothing for a land desolated by\r\nfire, sword, and famine: their sympathies took another direction; they\r\nwere touched with pity for bribery, so long tormented with a fruitless\r\nitching of its palms; their bowels yearned for usury, that had long\r\nmissed the harvest of its returning months;[40] they felt for\r\npeculation, which had been for so many years raking in the dust of an\r\nempty treasury; they were melted into compassion for rapine and\r\noppression, licking their dry, parched, unbloody jaws. These were the\r\nobjects of their solicitude. These were the necessities for which they\r\nwere studious to provide.\r\n\r\nTo state the country and its revenues in their real condition, and to\r\nprovide for those fictitious claims, consistently with the support of an\r\narmy and a civil establishment, would have been impossible; therefore\r\nthe ministers are silent on that head, and rest themselves on the\r\nauthority of Lord Macartney, who, in a letter to the Court of Directors,\r\nwritten in the year 1781, speculating on what might be the result of a\r\nwise management of the countries assigned by the Nabob of Arcot, rates\r\nthe revenue, as in time of peace, at twelve hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear, as he does those of the king of Tanjore (which had not been\r\nassigned) at four hundred and fifty. On this Lord Macartney grounds his\r\ncalculations, and on this they choose to ground theirs. It was on this\r\ncalculation that the ministry, in direct opposition to the remonstrances\r\nof the Court of Directors, have compelled that miserable enslaved body\r\nto put their hands to an order for appropriating the enormous sum of\r\n480,000_l._ annually, as a fund for paying to their rebellious servants\r\na debt contracted in defiance of their clearest and most positive\r\ninjunctions.\r\n\r\nThe authority and information of Lord Macartney is held high on this\r\noccasion, though it is totally rejected in every other particular of\r\nthis business. I believe I have the honor of being almost as old an\r\nacquaintance as any Lord Macartney has. A constant and unbroken\r\nfriendship has subsisted between us from a very early period; and I\r\ntrust he thinks, that, as I respect his character, and in general admire\r\nhis conduct, I am one of those who feel no common interest in his\r\nreputation. Yet I do not hesitate wholly to disallow the calculation of\r\n1781, without any apprehension that I shall appear to distrust his\r\nveracity or his judgment. This peace estimate of revenue was not\r\ngrounded on the state of the Carnatic, as it then, or as it had\r\nrecently, stood. It was a statement of former and better times. There is\r\nno doubt that a period did exist, when the large portion of the Carnatic\r\nheld by the Nabob of Arcot might be fairly reputed to produce a revenue\r\nto that, or to a greater amount. But the whole had so melted away by the\r\nslow and silent hostility of oppression and mismanagement, that the\r\nrevenues, sinking with the prosperity of the country, had fallen to\r\nabout 800,000_l._ a year, even before an enemy's horse had imprinted his\r\nhoof on the soil of the Carnatic. From that view, and independently of\r\nthe decisive effects of the war which ensued, Sir Eyre Coote conceived\r\nthat years must pass before the country could be restored to its former\r\nprosperity, and production. It was that state of revenue (namely, the\r\nactual state before the war) which the Directors have opposed to Lord\r\nMacartney's speculation. They refused to take the revenues for more than\r\n800,000_l._ In this they are justified by Lord Macartney himself, who,\r\nin a subsequent letter, informs the court that his sketch is a matter of\r\nspeculation; it supposes the country restored to its ancient prosperity,\r\nand the revenue to be in a course of effective and honest collection.\r\nIf, therefore, the ministers have gone wrong, they were not deceived by\r\nLord Macartney: they were deceived by no man. The estimate of the\r\nDirectors is nearly the very estimate furnished by the right honorable\r\ngentleman himself, and published to the world in one of the printed\r\nreports of his own committee;[41] but as soon as he obtained his power,\r\nhe chose to abandon his account. No part of his official conduct can be\r\ndefended on the ground of his Parliamentary information.\r\n\r\nIn this clashing of accounts and estimates, ought not the ministry, if\r\nthey wished to preserve even appearances, to have waited for information\r\nof the actual result of these speculations, before they laid a charge,\r\nand such a charge, not conditionally and eventually, but positively and\r\nauthoritatively, upon a country which they all knew, and which one of\r\nthem had registered on the records of this House, to be wasted, beyond\r\nall example, by every oppression of an abusive government, and every\r\nravage of a desolating war? But that you may discern in what manner they\r\nuse the correspondence of office, and that thereby you may enter into\r\nthe true spirit of the ministerial Board of Control, I desire you, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, to remark, that, through their whole controversy with the Court\r\nof Directors, they do not so much as hint at their ever having seen any\r\nother paper from Lord Macartney, or any other estimate of revenue than\r\nthis of 1781. To this they hold. Here they take post; here they intrench\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read this curious controversy between the ministerial\r\nboard and the Court of Directors, common candor obliged me to attribute\r\ntheir tenacious adherence to the estimate of 1781 to a total ignorance\r\nof what had appeared upon the records. But the right honorable gentleman\r\nhas chosen to come forward with an uncalled-for declaration; he\r\nboastingly tells you, that he has seen, read, digested, compared\r\neverything,--and that, if he has sinned, he has sinned with his eyes\r\nbroad open. Since, then, the ministers will obstinately shut the gates\r\nof mercy on themselves, let them add to their crimes what aggravations\r\nthey please. They have, then, (since it must be so,) wilfully and\r\ncorruptly suppressed the information which they ought to have produced,\r\nand, for the support of peculation, have made themselves guilty of\r\nspoliation and suppression of evidence.[42] The paper I hold in my hand,\r\nwhich totally overturns (for the present, at least) the estimate of\r\n1781, they have no more taken notice of, in their controversy with the\r\nCourt of Directors, than if it had no existence. It is the report made\r\nby a committee appointed at Madras to manage the whole of the six\r\ncountries assigned to the Company by the Nabob of Arcot. This committee\r\nwas wisely instituted by Lord Macartney, to remove from himself the\r\nsuspicion of all improper management in so invidious a trust; and it\r\nseems to have been well chosen. This committee has made a comparative\r\nestimate of the only six districts which were in a condition to be let\r\nto farm. In one set of columns they state the gross and net produce of\r\nthe districts as let by the Nabob. To that statement they oppose the\r\nterms on which the same districts were rented for five years under\r\ntheir authority. Under the Nabob, the gross farm was so high as\r\n570,000_l._ sterling. What was the clear produce? Why, no more than\r\nabout 250,000_l._; and this was the whole profit of the Nabob's\r\ntreasury, under his own management of all the districts which were in a\r\ncondition to be let to farm on the 27th of May, 1782. Lord Macartney's\r\nleases stipulated a gross produce of no more than about 530,000_l._; but\r\nthen the estimated net amount was nearly double the Nabob's. It,\r\nhowever, did not then exceed 480,000_l._; and Lord Macartney's\r\ncommissioners take credit for an annual revenue amounting to this clear\r\nsum. Here is no speculation; here is no inaccurate account clandestinely\r\nobtained from those who might wish, and were enabled, to deceive. It is\r\nthe authorized, recorded state of a real, recent transaction. Here is\r\nnot twelve hundred thousand pound,--not eight hundred. The whole revenue\r\nof the Carnatic yielded no more, in May, 1782, than four hundred and\r\neighty thousand pounds: nearly the very precise sum which your minister,\r\nwho is so careful of the public security, has carried from all\r\ndescriptions of establishment to form a fund for the private emolument\r\nof his creatures.\r\n\r\nIn this estimate, we see, as I have just observed, the Nabob's farms\r\nrated so high as 570,000_l._ Hitherto all is well: but follow on to the\r\neffective net revenue; there the illusion vanishes; and you will not\r\nfind nearly so much as half the produce. It is with reason, therefore,\r\nLord Macartney invariably, throughout the whole correspondence,\r\nqualifies all his views and expectations of revenue, and all his plans\r\nfor its application, with this indispensable condition, that the\r\nmanagement is not in the hands of the Nabob of Arcot. Should that fatal\r\nmeasure take place, he has over and over again told you that he has no\r\nprospect of realizing anything whatsoever for any public purpose. With\r\nthese weighty declarations, confirmed by such a state of indisputable\r\nfact before them, what has been done by the Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nand his accomplices? Shall I be believed? They have delivered over those\r\nvery territories, on the keeping of which in the hands of the committee\r\nthe defence of our dominions, and, what was more dear to them, possibly,\r\ntheir own job, depended,--they have delivered back again, without\r\ncondition, without arrangement, without stipulation of any sort for the\r\nnatives of any rank, the whole of those vast countries, to many of which\r\nhe had no just claim, into the ruinous mismanagement of the Nabob of\r\nArcot. To crown all, according to their miserable practice, whenever\r\nthey do anything transcendently absurd, they preface this their\r\nabdication of their trust by a solemn declaration that they were not\r\nobliged to it by any principle of policy or any demand of justice\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nI have stated to you the estimated produce of the territories of the\r\nCarnatic in a condition to be farmed in 1782, according to the different\r\nmanagements into which they might fall; and this estimate the ministers\r\nhave thought proper to suppress. Since that, two other accounts have\r\nbeen received. The first informs us, that there has been a recovery of\r\nwhat is called arrear, as well as of an improvement of the revenue of\r\none of the six provinces which were let in 1782.[43] It was brought\r\nabout by making a new war. After some sharp actions, by the resolution\r\nand skill of Colonel Fullarton several of the petty princes of the most\r\nsoutherly of the unwasted provinces were compelled to pay very heavy\r\nrents and tributes, who for a long time before had not paid any\r\nacknowledgment. After this reduction, by the care of Mr. Irwin, one of\r\nthe committee, that province was divided into twelve farms. This\r\noperation raised the income of that particular province; the others\r\nremain as they were first farmed. So that, instead of producing only\r\ntheir original rent of 480,000_l._, they netted, in about two years and\r\na quarter, 1,320,000_l._ sterling, which would be about 660,000_l._ a\r\nyear, if the recovered arrear was not included. What deduction is to be\r\nmade on account of that arrear I cannot determine, but certainly what\r\nwould reduce the annual income considerably below the rate I have\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nThe second account received is the letting of the wasted provinces of\r\nthe Carnatic. This I understand is at a growing rent, which may or may\r\nnot realize what it promises; but if it should answer, it will raise the\r\nwhole, at some future time, to 1,200,000_l._\r\n\r\nYou must here remark, Mr. Speaker, that this revenue is the produce of\r\n_all_ the Nabob's dominions. During the assignment, the Nabob paid\r\nnothing, because the Company had all. Supposing the whole of the lately\r\nassigned territory to yield up to the most sanguine expectations of the\r\nright honorable gentleman, and suppose 1,200,000_l._ to be annually\r\nrealized, (of which we actually know of no more than the realizing of\r\nsix hundred thousand,) out of this you must deduct the subsidy and rent\r\nwhich the Nabob paid before the assignment,--namely, 340,000_l._ a year.\r\nThis reduces back the revenue applicable to the new distribution made by\r\nhis Majesty's ministers to about 800,000_l._ Of that sum five eighths\r\nare by them surrendered to the debts. The remaining three are the only\r\nfund left for all the purposes so magnificently displayed in the letter\r\nof the Board of Control: that is, for a new-cast peace establishment, a\r\nnow fund for ordnance and fortifications, and a large allowance for what\r\nthey call \"the splendor of the Durbar.\"\r\n\r\nYou have heard the account of these territories as they stood in 1782.\r\nYou have seen the _actual_ receipt since the assignment in 1781, of\r\nwhich I reckon about two years and a quarter productive. I have stated\r\nto you the expectation from the wasted part. For realizing all this you\r\nmay value yourselves on the vigor and diligence of a governor and\r\ncommittee that have done so much. If these hopes from the committee are\r\nrational, remember that the committee is no more. Your ministers, who\r\nhave formed their fund for these debts on the presumed effect of the\r\ncommittee's management, have put a complete end to that committee. Their\r\nacts are rescinded; their leases are broken; their renters are\r\ndispersed. Your ministers knew, when they signed the death-warrant of\r\nthe Carnatic, that the Nabob would not only turn all these unfortunate\r\nfarmers of revenue out of employment, but that he has denounced his\r\nseverest vengeance against them, for acting under British authority.\r\nWith a knowledge of this disposition, a British Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer and Treasurer of the Navy, incited by no public advantage,\r\nimpelled by no public necessity, in a strain of the most wanton perfidy\r\nwhich has ever stained the annals of mankind, have delivered over to\r\nplunder, imprisonment, exile, and death itself, according to the mercy\r\nof such execrable tyrants as Amir-ul-Omrah and Paul Benfield, the\r\nunhappy and deluded souls who, untaught by uniform example, were still\r\nweak enough to put their trust in English faith.[44] They have gone\r\nfarther: they have thought proper to mock and outrage their misery by\r\nordering them protection and compensation. From what power is this\r\nprotection to be derived, and from what fund is this compensation to\r\narise? The revenues are delivered over to their oppressor; the\r\nterritorial jurisdiction, from whence that revenue is to arise, and\r\nunder which they live, is surrendered to the same iron hands: and that\r\nthey shall be deprived of all refuge and all hope, the minister has made\r\na solemn, voluntary declaration that he never will interfere with the\r\nNabob's internal government.[45]\r\n\r\nThe last thing considered by the Board of Control among the debts of the\r\nCarnatic was that arising to the East India Company, which, after the\r\nprovision for the cavalry, and the consolidation of 1777, was to divide\r\nthe residue of the fund of 480,000_l._ a year with the lenders of 1767.\r\nThis debt the worthy chairman, who sits opposite to me, contends to be\r\nthree millions sterling. Lord Macartney's account of 1781 states it to\r\nbe at that period 1,200,000_l._ The first account of the Court of\r\nDirectors makes it 900,000_l._ This, like the private debt, being\r\nwithout any solid existence, is incapable of any distinct limits.\r\nWhatever its amount or its validity may be, one thing is clear: it is of\r\nthe nature and quality of a public debt. In that light nothing is\r\nprovided for it, but an eventual surplus to be divided with one class\r\nof the private demands, after satisfying the two first classes. Never\r\nwas a more shameful postponing a public demand, which, by the reason of\r\nthe thing, and the uniform practice of all nations, supersedes every\r\nprivate claim.\r\n\r\nThose who gave this preference to private claims consider the Company's\r\nas a lawful demand; else why did they pretend to provide for it? On\r\ntheir own principles they are condemned.\r\n\r\nBut I, Sir, who profess to speak to your understanding and to your\r\nconscience, and to brush away from this business all false colors, all\r\nfalse appellations, as well as false facts, do positively deny that the\r\nCarnatic owes a shilling to the Company,--whatever the Company may be\r\nindebted to that undone country. It owes nothing to the Company, for\r\nthis plain and simple reason: the territory charged with the debt is\r\ntheir own. To say that their revenues fall short, and owe them money, is\r\nto say they are in debt to themselves, which is only talking nonsense.\r\nThe fact is, that, by the invasion of an enemy, and the ruin of the\r\ncountry, the Company, either in its own name, or in the names of the\r\nNabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore, has lost for several years what it\r\nmight have looked to receive from its own estate. If men were allowed to\r\ncredit themselves upon such principles, any one might soon grow rich by\r\nthis mode of accounting. A flood comes down upon a man's estate in the\r\nBedford Level of a thousand pounds a year, and drowns his rents for ten\r\nyears. The Chancellor would put that man into the hands of a trustee,\r\nwho would gravely make up his books, and for this loss credit himself in\r\nhis account for a debt due to him of 10,000_l._ It is, however, on this\r\nprinciple the Company makes up its demands on the Carnatic. In peace\r\nthey go the full length, and indeed more than the full length, of what\r\nthe people can bear for current establishments; then they are absurd\r\nenough to consolidate all the calamities of war into debts,--to\r\nmetamorphose the devastations of the country into demands upon its\r\nfuture production. What is this but to avow a resolution utterly to\r\ndestroy their own country, and to force the people to pay for their\r\nsufferings to a government which has proved unable to protect either the\r\nshare of the husbandman or their own? In every lease of a farm, the\r\ninvasion of an enemy, instead of forming a demand for arrear, is a\r\nrelease of rent: nor for that release is it at all necessary to show\r\nthat the invasion has left nothing to the occupier of the soil; though\r\nin the present case it would be too easy to prove that melancholy\r\nfact.[46] I therefore applauded my right honorable friend, who, when he\r\ncanvassed the Company's accounts, as a preliminary to a bill that ought\r\nnot to stand on falsehood of any kind, fixed his discerning eye and his\r\ndeciding hand on these debts of the Company from the Nabob of Arcot and\r\nRajah of Tanjore, and at one stroke expunged them all, as utterly\r\nirrecoverable: he might have added, as utterly unfounded.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I do not blame the arrangement this day in question, as\r\na preference given to the debt of individuals over the Company's debt.\r\nIn my eye it is no more than the preference of a fiction over a chimera;\r\nbut I blame the preference given to those fictitious private debts over\r\nthe standing defence and the standing government. It is there the public\r\nis robbed. It is robbed in its army; it is robbed in its civil\r\nadministration; it is robbed in its credit; it is robbed in its\r\ninvestment, which forms the commercial connection between that country\r\nand Europe. There is the robbery.\r\n\r\nBut my principal objection lies a good deal deeper. That debt to the\r\nCompany is the pretext under which all the other debts lurk and cover\r\nthemselves. That debt forms the foul, putrid mucus in which are\r\nengendered the whole brood of creeping ascarides, all the endless\r\ninvolutions, the eternal knot, added to a knot of those inexpugnable\r\ntape-worms which devour the nutriment and eat up the bowels of\r\nIndia.[47] It is necessary, Sir, you should recollect two things. First,\r\nthat the Nabob's debt to the Company carries no interest. In the next\r\nplace, you will observe, that, whenever the Company has occasion to\r\nborrow, she has always commanded whatever she thought fit at eight per\r\ncent. Carrying in your mind these two facts, attend to the process with\r\nregard to the public and private debt, and with what little appearance\r\nof decency they play into each other's hands a game of utter perdition\r\nto the unhappy natives of India. The Nabob falls into an arrear to the\r\nCompany. The Presidency presses for payment. The Nabob's answer is, \"I\r\nhave no money.\" Good! But there are soucars who will supply you on the\r\nmortgage of your territories. Then steps forward some Paul Benfield,\r\nand, from his grateful compassion to the Nabob, and his filial regard\r\nto the Company, he unlocks the treasures of his virtuous industry, and,\r\nfor a consideration of twenty-four or thirty-six per cent on a mortgage\r\nof the territorial revenue, becomes security to the Company for the\r\nNabob's arrear.\r\n\r\nAll this intermediate usury thus becomes sanctified by the ultimate view\r\nto the Company's payment. In this case, would not a plain man ask this\r\nplain question of the Company: If you know that the Nabob must annually\r\nmortgage his territories to your servants to pay his annual arrear to\r\nyou, why is not the assignment or mortgage made directly to the Company\r\nitself? By this simple, obvious operation, the Company would be relieved\r\nand the debt paid, without the charge of a shilling interest to that\r\nprince. But if that course should be thought too indulgent, why do they\r\nnot take that assignment with such interest to themselves as they pay to\r\nothers, that is, eight per cent? Or if it were thought more advisable\r\n(why it should I know not) that he must borrow, why do not the Company\r\nlend their own credit to the Nabob for their own payment? That credit\r\nwould not be weakened by the collateral security of his territorial\r\nmortgage. The money might still be had at eight per cent. Instead of any\r\nof these honest and obvious methods, the Company has for years kept up a\r\nshow of disinterestedness and moderation, by suffering a debt to\r\naccumulate to them from the country powers without any interest at all;\r\nand at the same time have seen before their eyes, on a pretext of\r\nborrowing to pay that debt, the revenues of the country charged with an\r\nusury of twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six, and even eight-and-forty per\r\ncent, with compound interest,[48] for the benefit of their servants. All\r\nthis time they know that by having a debt subsisting without any\r\ninterest, which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highest\r\ninterest, they manifestly render it necessary to the Nabob of Arcot to\r\ngive the private demand a preference to the public; and, by binding him\r\nand their servants together in a common cause, they enable him to form a\r\nparty to the utter ruin of their own authority and their own affairs.\r\nThus their false moderation, and their affected purity, by the natural\r\noperation of everything false and everything affected, becomes pander\r\nand bawd to the unbridled debauchery and licentious lewdness of usury\r\nand extortion.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this double game, all the territorial revenues have at\r\none time or other been covered by those locusts, the English soucars.\r\nNot one single foot of the Carnatic has escaped them: a territory as\r\nlarge as England. During these operations what a scene has that country\r\npresented![49] The usurious European assignee supersedes the Nabob's\r\nnative farmer of the revenue; the farmer flies to the Nabob's presence\r\nto claim his bargain; whilst his servants murmur for wages, and his\r\nsoldiers mutiny for pay. The mortgage to the European assignee is then\r\nresumed, and the native farmer replaced,--replaced, again to be removed\r\non the new clamor of the European assignee.[50] Every man of rank and\r\nlanded fortune being long since extinguished, the remaining miserable\r\nlast cultivator, who grows to the soil, after having his back scored by\r\nthe farmer, has it again flayed by the whip of the assignee, and is\r\nthus, by a ravenous, because a short-lived succession of claimants,\r\nlashed from oppressor to oppressor, whilst a single drop of blood is\r\nleft as the means of extorting a single grain of corn. Do not think I\r\npaint. Far, very far, from it: I do not reach the fact, nor approach to\r\nit. Men of respectable condition, men equal to your substantial English\r\nyeomen, are daily tied up and scourged to answer the multiplied demands\r\nof various contending and contradictory titles, all issuing from one and\r\nthe same source. Tyrannous exaction brings on servile concealment; and\r\nthat again calls forth tyrannous coercion. They move in a circle,\r\nmutually producing and produced; till at length nothing of humanity is\r\nleft in the government, no trace of integrity, spirit, or manliness in\r\nthe people, who drag out a precarious and degraded existence under this\r\nsystem of outrage upon human nature. Such is the effect of the\r\nestablishment of a debt to the Company, as it has hitherto been managed,\r\nand as it ever will remain, until ideas are adopted totally different\r\nfrom those which prevail at this time.\r\n\r\nYour worthy ministers, supporting what they are obliged to condemn, have\r\nthought fit to renew the Company's old order against contracting private\r\ndebts in future. They begin by rewarding the violation of the ancient\r\nlaw; and then they gravely reenact provisions, of which they have given\r\nbounties for the breach. This inconsistency has been well exposed.[51]\r\nBut what will you say to their having gone the length of giving positive\r\ndirections for contracting the debt which they positively forbid?\r\n\r\nI will explain myself. They order the Nabob, out of the revenues of the\r\nCarnatic, to allot four hundred and eighty thousand pounds a year, as a\r\nfund for the debts before us. For the punctual payment of this annuity,\r\nthey order him to give soucar security.[52] When a soucar, that is, a\r\nmoney-dealer, becomes security for any native prince, the course is for\r\nthe native prince to counter-secure the money-dealer, by making over to\r\nhim in mortgage a portion of his territory equal to the sum annually to\r\nbe paid, with an interest of at least twenty-four per cent. The point\r\nfit for the House to know is, who are these soucars to whom this\r\nsecurity on the revenues in favor of the Nabob's creditors is to be\r\ngiven? The majority of the House, unaccustomed to these transactions,\r\nwill hear with astonishment that these soucars are no other than the\r\ncreditors themselves. The minister, not content with authorizing these\r\ntransactions in a manner and to an extent unhoped for by the rapacious\r\nexpectations of usury itself, loads the broken back of the Indian\r\nrevenues, in favor of his worthy friends, the soucars, with an\r\nadditional twenty-four per cent for being security to themselves for\r\ntheir own claims, for condescending to take the country in mortgage to\r\npay to themselves the fruits of their own extortions.\r\n\r\nThe interest to be paid for this security, according to the most\r\nmoderate strain of soucar demand, comes to 118,000_l._ a year, which,\r\nadded to the 480,000_l._ on which it is to accrue, will make the whole\r\ncharge amount to 598,000_l._ a year,--as much as even a long peace will\r\nenable those revenues to produce. Can any one reflect for a moment on\r\nall those claims of debt, which the minister exhausts himself in\r\ncontrivances to augment with new usuries, without lifting up his hands\r\nand eyes in astonishment at the impudence both of the claim and of the\r\nadjudication? Services of some kind or other these servants of the\r\nCompany must have done, so great and eminent that the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer cannot think that all they have brought home is half enough.\r\nHe hallooes after them, \"Gentlemen, you have forgot a large packet\r\nbehind you, in your hurry; you have not sufficiently recovered\r\nyourselves; you ought to have, and you shall have, interest upon\r\ninterest upon a prohibited debt that is made up of interest upon\r\ninterest. Even this is too little. I have thought of another character\r\nfor you, by which you may add something to your gains: you shall be\r\nsecurity to yourselves; and hence will arise a new usury, which shall\r\nefface the memory of all the usuries suggested to you by your own dull\r\ninventions.\"\r\n\r\nI have done with the arrangement relative to the Carnatic. After this it\r\nis to little purpose to observe on what the ministers have done to\r\nTanjore. Your ministers have not observed even form and ceremony in\r\ntheir outrageous and insulting robbery of that country, whose only crime\r\nhas been its early and constant adherence to the power of this, and the\r\nsuffering of an uniform pillage in consequence of it. The debt of the\r\nCompany from the Rajah of Tanjore is just of the same stuff with that of\r\nthe Nabob of Arcot.\r\n\r\nThe subsidy from Tanjore, on the arrear of which this pretended debt (if\r\nany there be) has accrued to the Company, is not, like that paid by the\r\nNabob of Arcot, a compensation for vast countries obtained, augmented,\r\nand preserved for him; not the price of pillaged treasuries, ransacked\r\nhouses, and plundered territories: it is a large grant, from a small\r\nkingdom not obtained by our arms; robbed, not protected, by our power; a\r\ngrant for which no equivalent was ever given, or pretended to be given.\r\nThe right honorable gentleman, however, bears witness in his reports to\r\nthe punctuality of the payments of this grant of bounty, or, if you\r\nplease, of fear. It amounts to one hundred and sixty thousand pounds\r\nsterling net annual subsidy. He bears witness to a further grant of a\r\ntown and port, with an annexed district of thirty thousand pound a year,\r\nsurrendered to the Company since the first donation. He has not borne\r\nwitness, but the fact is, (he will not deny it,) that in the midst of\r\nwar, and during the ruin and desolation of a considerable part of his\r\nterritories, this prince made many very large payments. Notwithstanding\r\nthese merits and services, the first regulation of ministry is to force\r\nfrom him a territory of an extent which they have not yet thought proper\r\nto ascertain,[53] for a military peace establishment the particulars of\r\nwhich they have not yet been pleased to settle.\r\n\r\nThe next part of their arrangement is with regard to war. As confessedly\r\nthis prince had no share in stirring up any of the former wars, so all\r\nfuture wars are completely out of his power; for he has no troops\r\nwhatever, and is under a stipulation not so much as to correspond with\r\nany foreign state, except through the Company. Yet, in case the\r\nCompany's servants should be again involved in war, or should think\r\nproper again to provoke any enemy, as in times past they have wantonly\r\nprovoked all India, he is to be subjected to a new penalty. To what\r\npenalty? Why, to no less than the confiscation of all his revenues. But\r\nthis is to end with the war, and they are to be faithfully returned? Oh,\r\nno! nothing like it. The country is to remain under confiscation until\r\nall the debt which the Company shall think fit to incur in such war\r\nshall be discharged: that is to say, forever. His sole comfort is, to\r\nfind his old enemy, the Nabob of Arcot, placed in the very same\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe revenues of that miserable country were, before the invasion of\r\nHyder, reduced to a _gross_ annual receipt of three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand pound.[54] From this receipt the subsidy I have just stated is\r\ntaken. This again, by payments in advance, by extorting deposits of\r\nadditional sums to a vast amount for the benefit of their soucars, and\r\nby an endless variety of other extortions, public and private, is loaded\r\nwith a debt, the amount of which I never could ascertain, but which is\r\nlarge undoubtedly, generating an usury the most completely ruinous that\r\nprobably was ever heard of: _that is, forty-eight per cent, payable\r\nmonthly, with compound interest_.[55]\r\n\r\nSuch is the state to which the Company's servants have reduced that\r\ncountry. Now come the reformers, restorers, and comforters of India.\r\nWhat have they done? In addition to all these tyrannous exactions, with\r\nall these ruinous debts in their train, looking to one side of an\r\nagreement whilst they wilfully shut their eyes to the other, they\r\nwithdraw from Tanjore all the benefits of the treaty of 1762, and they\r\nsubject that nation to a perpetual tribute of forty thousand a year to\r\nthe Nabob of Arcot: a tribute never due, or pretended to be due, to\r\n_him_, even when he appeared to be something; a tribute, as things now\r\nstand, not to a real potentate, but to a shadow, a dream, an incubus of\r\noppression. After the Company has accepted in subsidy, in grant of\r\nterritory, in remission of rent, as a compensation for their own\r\nprotection, at least two hundred thousand pound a year, without\r\ndiscounting a shilling for that receipt, the ministers condemn this\r\nharassed nation to be tributary to a person who is himself, by their own\r\narrangement, deprived of the right of war or peace, deprived of the\r\npower of the sword, forbid to keep up a single regiment of soldiers, and\r\nis therefore wholly disabled from all protection of the country which is\r\nthe object of the pretended tribute. Tribute hangs on the sword. It is\r\nan incident inseparable from real, sovereign power. In the present case,\r\nto suppose its existence is as absurd as it is cruel and oppressive. And\r\nhere, Mr. Speaker, you have a clear exemplification of the use of those\r\nfalse names and false colors which the gentlemen who have lately taken\r\npossession of India choose to lay on for the purpose of disguising their\r\nplan of oppression. The Nabob of Arcot and Rajah of Tanjore have, in\r\ntruth and substance, no more than a merely civil authority, held in the\r\nmost entire dependence on the Company. The Nabob, without military,\r\nwithout federal capacity, is extinguished as a potentate; but then he is\r\ncarefully kept alive as an independent and sovereign power, for the\r\npurpose of rapine and extortion,--for the purpose of perpetuating the\r\nold intrigues, animosities, usuries, and corruptions.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough that this mockery of tribute was to be continued\r\nwithout the correspondent protection, or any of the stipulated\r\nequivalents, but ten years of arrear, to the amount of 400,000_l._\r\nsterling, is added to all the debts to the Company and to individuals,\r\nin order to create a new debt, to be paid (if at all possible to be paid\r\nin whole or in part) only by new usuries,--and all this for the Nabob of\r\nArcot, or rather for Mr. Benfield and the corps of the Nabob's creditors\r\nand their soucars. Thus these miserable Indian princes are continued in\r\ntheir seats for no other purpose than to render them, in the first\r\ninstance, objects of every species of extortion, and, in the second, to\r\nforce them to become, for the sake of a momentary shadow of reduced\r\nauthority, a sort of subordinate tyrants, the ruin and calamity, not the\r\nfathers and cherishers, of their people.\r\n\r\nBut take this tribute only as a mere charge (without title, cause, or\r\nequivalent) on this people; what one step has been taken to furnish\r\ngrounds for a just calculation and estimate of the proportion of the\r\nburden and the ability? None,--not an attempt at it. They do not adapt\r\nthe burden to the strength, but they estimate the strength of the\r\nbearers by the burden they impose. Then what care is taken to leave a\r\nfund sufficient to the future reproduction of the revenues that are to\r\nbear all these loads? Every one, but tolerably conversant in Indian\r\naffairs, must know that the existence of this little kingdom depends on\r\nits control over the river Cavery. The benefits of Heaven to any\r\ncommunity ought never to be connected with political arrangements, or\r\nmade to depend on the personal conduct of princes, in which the mistake,\r\nor error, or neglect, or distress, or passion of a moment, on either\r\nside, may bring famine on millions, and ruin an innocent nation perhaps\r\nfor ages. The means of the subsistence of mankind should be as immutable\r\nas the laws of Nature, let power and dominion take what course they\r\nmay.--Observe what has been done with regard to this important concern.\r\nThe use of this river is, indeed, at length given to the Rajah, and a\r\npower provided for its enjoyment _at his own charge_; but the means of\r\nfurnishing that charge (and a mighty one it is) are wholly out off. This\r\nuse of the water, which ought to have no more connection than clouds and\r\nrains and sunshine with the politics of the Rajah, the Nabob, or the\r\nCompany, is expressly contrived as a means of enforcing demands and\r\narrears of tribute. This horrid and unnatural instrument of extortion\r\nhad been a distinguishing feature in the enormities of the Carnatic\r\npolitics, that loudly called for reformation. But the food of a whole\r\npeople is by the reformers of India conditioned on payments from its\r\nprince, at a moment that he is overpowered with a swarm of their\r\ndemands, without regard to the ability of either prince or people. In\r\nfine, by opening an avenue to the irruption of the Nabob of Arcot's\r\ncreditors and soucars, whom every man, who did not fall in love with\r\noppression and corruption on an experience of the calamities they\r\nproduced, would have raised wall before wall and mound before mound to\r\nkeep from a possibility of entrance, a more destructive enemy than Hyder\r\nAli is introduced into that kingdom. By this part of their arrangement,\r\nin which they establish a debt to the Nabob of Arcot, in effect and\r\nsubstance, they deliver over Tanjore, bound hand and foot, to Paul\r\nBenfield, the old betrayer, insulter, oppressor, and scourge of a\r\ncountry which has for years been an object of an unremitted, but,\r\nunhappily, an unequal struggle, between the bounties of Providence to\r\nrenovate and the wickedness of mankind to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman[56] talks of his fairness in determining\r\nthe territorial dispute between the Nabob of Arcot and the prince of\r\nthat country, when he superseded the determination of the Directors, in\r\nwhom the law had vested the decision of that controversy. He is in this\r\njust as feeble as he is in every other part. But it is not necessary to\r\nsay a word in refutation of any part of his argument. The mode of the\r\nproceeding sufficiently speaks the spirit of it. It is enough to fix his\r\ncharacter as a judge, that he _never heard the Directors in defence of\r\ntheir adjudication, nor either of the parties in support of their\r\nrespective claims_. It is sufficient for me that he takes from the Rajah\r\nof Tanjore by this pretended adjudication, or rather from his unhappy\r\nsubjects, 40,000_l._ a year of his and their revenue, and leaves upon\r\nhis and their shoulders all the charges that can be made on the part of\r\nthe Nabob, on the part of his creditors, and on the part of the Company,\r\nwithout so much as hearing him as to right or to ability. But what\r\nprincipally induces me to leave the affair of the territorial dispute\r\nbetween the Nabob and the Rajah to another day is this,--that, both the\r\nparties being stripped of their all, it little signifies under which of\r\ntheir names the unhappy, undone people are delivered over to the\r\nmerciless soucars, the allies of that right honorable gentleman and the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. In them ends the account of this long\r\ndispute of the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman is of opinion that his judgment in this\r\ncase can be censured by none but those who seem to act as if they were\r\npaid agents to one of the parties. What does he think of his Court of\r\nDirectors? If they are paid by either of the parties, by which of them\r\ndoes he think they are paid? He knows that their decision has been\r\ndirectly contrary to his. Shall I believe that it does not enter into\r\nhis heart to conceive that any person can steadily and actively interest\r\nhimself in the protection of the injured and oppressed without being\r\nwell paid for his service? I have taken notice of this sort of discourse\r\nsome days ago, so far as it may be supposed to relate to me. I then\r\ncontented myself, as I shall now do, with giving it a cold, though a\r\nvery direct contradiction. Thus much I do from respect to truth. If I\r\ndid more, it might be supposed, by my anxiety to clear myself, that I\r\nhad imbibed the ideas which, for obvious reasons, the right honorable\r\ngentleman wishes to have received concerning all attempts to plead the\r\ncause of the natives of India, as if it were a disreputable employment.\r\nIf he had not forgot, in his present occupation, every principle which\r\nought to have guided him, and I hope did guide him, in his late\r\nprofession, he would have known that he who takes a fee for pleading the\r\ncause of distress against power, and manfully performs the duty he has\r\nassumed, receives an honorable recompense for a virtuous service. But if\r\nthe right honorable gentleman will have no regard to fact in his\r\ninsinuations or to reason in his opinions, I wish him at least to\r\nconsider, that, if taking an earnest part with regard to the oppressions\r\nexercised in India, and with regard to this most oppressive case of\r\nTanjore in particular, can ground a presumption of interested motives,\r\nhe is himself the most mercenary man I know. His conduct, indeed, is\r\nsuch that he is on all occasions the standing testimony against himself.\r\nHe it was that first called to that case the attention of the House; the\r\nreports of his own committee are ample and affecting upon that\r\nsubject;[57] and as many of us as have escaped his massacre must\r\nremember the very pathetic picture he made of the sufferings of the\r\nTanjore country, on the day when he moved the unwieldy code of his\r\nIndian resolutions. Has he not stated over and over again, in his\r\nreports, the ill treatment of the Rajah of Tanjore (a branch of the\r\nroyal house of the Mahrattas, every injury to whom the Mahrattas felt as\r\noffered to themselves) as a main cause of the alienation of that people\r\nfrom the British power? And does he now think that to betray his\r\nprinciples, to contradict his declarations, and to become himself an\r\nactive instrument in those oppressions which he had so tragically\r\nlamented, is the way to clear himself of having been actuated by a\r\npecuniary interest at the time when he chose to appear full of\r\ntenderness to that ruined nation?\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman is fond of parading on the motives of\r\nothers, and on his own. As to himself, he despises the imputations of\r\nthose who suppose that anything corrupt could influence him in this his\r\nunexampled liberality of the public treasure. I do not know that I am\r\nobliged to speak to the motives of ministry, in the arrangements they\r\nhave made of the pretended debts of Arcot and Tanjore. If I prove fraud\r\nand collusion with regard to public money on those right honorable\r\ngentlemen, I am not obliged to assign their motives; because no good\r\nmotives can be pleaded in favor of their conduct. Upon that case I\r\nstand; we are at issue; and I desire to go to trial. This, I am sure, is\r\nnot loose railing, or mean insinuation, according to their low and\r\ndegenerate fashion, when they make attacks on the measures of their\r\nadversaries. It is a regular and juridical course; and unless I choose\r\nit, nothing can compel me to go further.\r\n\r\nBut since these unhappy gentlemen have dared to hold a lofty tone about\r\ntheir motives, and affect to despise suspicion, instead of being careful\r\nnot to give cause for it, I shall beg leave to lay before you some\r\ngeneral observations on what I conceive was their duty in so delicate a\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIf I were worthy to suggest any line of prudence to that right honorable\r\ngentleman, I would tell him that the way to avoid suspicion in the\r\nsettlement of pecuniary transactions, in which great frauds have been\r\nvery strongly presumed, is, to attend to these few plain\r\nprinciples:--First, to hear all parties equally, and not the managers\r\nfor the suspected claimants only; not to proceed in the dark, but to act\r\nwith as much publicity as possible; not to precipitate decision; to be\r\nreligious in following the rules prescribed in the commission under\r\nwhich we act; and, lastly, and above all, not to be fond of straining\r\nconstructions, to force a jurisdiction, and to draw to ourselves the\r\nmanagement of a trust in its nature invidious and obnoxious to\r\nsuspicion, where the plainest letter of the law does not compel it. If\r\nthese few plain rules are observed, no corruption ought to be suspected;\r\nif any of them are violated, suspicion will attach in proportion; if all\r\nof them are violated, a corrupt motive of some kind or other will not\r\nonly be suspected, but must be violently presumed.\r\n\r\nThe persons in whose favor all these rules have been violated, and the\r\nconduct of ministers towards them, will naturally call for your\r\nconsideration, and will serve to lead you through a series and\r\ncombination of facts and characters, if I do not mistake, into the very\r\ninmost recesses of this mysterious business. You will then be in\r\npossession of all the materials on which the principles of sound\r\njurisprudence will found, or will reject, the presumption of corrupt\r\nmotives, or, if such motives are indicated, will point out to you of\r\nwhat particular nature the corruption is.\r\n\r\nOur wonderful minister, as you all know, formed a new plan, a plan\r\n_insigne, recens, indictum ore alio_, a plan for supporting the freedom\r\nof our Constitution by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions\r\nby Indian delinquency. To carry that bold, paradoxical design into\r\nexecution, sufficient funds and apt instruments became necessary. You\r\nare perfectly sensible that a Parliamentary reform occupies his\r\nthoughts day and night, as an essential member in this extraordinary\r\nproject. In his anxious researches upon this subject, natural instinct,\r\nas well as sound policy, would direct his eyes and settle his choice on\r\nPaul Benfield. Paul Benfield is the grand Parliamentary reformer, the\r\nreformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the\r\nright honorable gentleman himself must yield the palm: for what region\r\nin the empire, what city, what borough, what county, what tribunal in\r\nthis kingdom is not full of his labors? Others have been only\r\nspeculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whilst the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer pledges in vain the man and the minister, to\r\nincrease the provincial members, Mr. Benfield has auspiciously and\r\npractically begun it. Leaving far behind him even Lord Camelford's\r\ngenerous design of bestowing Old Sarum on the Bank of England, Mr.\r\nBenfield has thrown in the borough of Cricklade to reinforce the county\r\nrepresentation. Not content with this, in order to station a steady\r\nphalanx for all future reforms, this public-spirited usurer, amidst his\r\ncharitable toils for the relief of India, did not forget the poor,\r\nrotten Constitution of his native country. For her, he did not disdain\r\nto stoop to the trade of a wholesale upholsterer for this House,--to\r\nfurnish it, not with the faded tapestry figures of antiquated merit,\r\nsuch as decorate, and may reproach, some other houses, but with real,\r\nsolid, living patterns of true modern virtue. Paul Benfield made\r\n(reckoning himself) no fewer than eight members in the last Parliament.\r\nWhat copious streams of pure blood must he not have transfused into the\r\nveins of the present!\r\n\r\nBut what is even more striking than the real services of this\r\nnew-imported patriot is his modesty. As soon as he had conferred this\r\nbenefit on the Constitution, he withdrew himself from our applause. He\r\nconceived that the duties of a member of Parliament (which with the\r\nelect faithful, the true believers, the _Islam_ of Parliamentary reform,\r\nare of little or no merit, perhaps not much better than specious sins)\r\nmight he as well attended to in India as in England, and the means of\r\nreformation to Parliament itself be far better provided. Mr. Benfield\r\nwas therefore no sooner elected than he set off for Madras, and\r\ndefrauded the longing eyes of Parliament. We have never enjoyed in this\r\nHouse the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race, and\r\ncontemplating that visage which has so long reflected the happiness of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore not possible for the minister to consult personally\r\nwith this great man. What, then, was he to do? Through a sagacity that\r\nnever failed him in these pursuits, he found out, in Mr. Benfield's\r\nrepresentative, his exact resemblance. A specific attraction, by which\r\nhe gravitates towards all such characters, soon brought our minister\r\ninto a close connection with Mr. Benfield's agent and attorney, that is,\r\nwith the grand contractor, (whom I name to honor,) Mr. Richard\r\nAtkinson,--a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of\r\nthis House, as long as the records of the British Treasury, as long as\r\nthe monumental debt of England, shall endure.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, Sir, acts as attorney for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one\r\nwho hears me is well acquainted with the sacred friendship and the\r\nsteady mutual attachment that subsists between him and the present\r\nminister. As many members as chose to attend in the first session of\r\nthis Parliament can best tell their own feelings at the scenes which\r\nwere then acted. How much that honorable gentleman was consulted in the\r\noriginal frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's India\r\nBill, is matter only of conjecture, though by no means difficult to\r\ndivine. But the public was an indignant witness of the ostentation with\r\nwhich the measure was made his own, and the authority with which he\r\nbrought up clause after clause, to stuff and fatten the rankness of that\r\ncorrupt act. As fast as the clauses were brought up to the table, they\r\nwere accepted. No hesitation, no discussion. They were received by the\r\nnew minister, not with approbation, but with implicit submission. The\r\nreformation may be estimated by seeing who was the reformer. Paul\r\nBenfield's associate and agent was held up to the world as legislator of\r\nHindostan. But it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between\r\nthe men of intrigue in India and the minister of intrigue in England by\r\na studied display of the power of this their connecting link. Every\r\ntrust, every honor, every distinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was\r\nat once made a Director of the India Company, made an alderman of\r\nLondon, and to be made, if ministry could prevail, (and I am sorry to\r\nsay how near, how very near, they were prevailing,) representative of\r\nthe capital of this kingdom. But to secure his services against all\r\nrisk, he was brought in for a ministerial borough. On his part, he was\r\nnot wanting in zeal for the common cause. His advertisements show his\r\nmotives, and the merits upon which he stood. For your minister, this\r\nworn-out veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the London\r\ncontest; and you all remember that in the same virtuous cause he\r\nsubmitted to keep a sort of public office or counting-house, where the\r\nwhole business of the last general election was managed. It was openly\r\nmanaged by the direct agent and attorney of Benfield. It was managed\r\nupon Indian principles and for an Indian interest. This was the golden\r\ncup of abominations,--this the chalice of the fornications of rapine,\r\nusury, and oppression, which was held out by the gorgeous Eastern\r\nharlot,--which so many of the people, so many of the nobles of this land\r\nhad drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to\r\nfollow this lewd debauch? that no payment was to be demanded for this\r\nriot of public drunkenness and national prostitution? Here, you have it\r\nhere before you! The principal of the grand election-manager must be\r\nindemnified; accordingly, the claims of Benfield and his crew must be\r\nput above all inquiry.\r\n\r\nFor several years Benfield appeared as the chief proprietor, as well as\r\nthe chief agent, director, and controller of this system of debt. The\r\nworthy chairman of the Company has stated the claims of this single\r\ngentleman on the Nabob of Arcot as amounting to five hundred thousand\r\npound.[58] Possibly at the time of the chairman's state they might have\r\nbeen as high. Eight hundred thousand pound had been mentioned some time\r\nbefore;[59] and, according to the practice of shifting the names of\r\ncreditors in these transactions, and reducing or raising the debt itself\r\nat pleasure, I think it not impossible that at one period the name of\r\nBenfield might have stood before those frightful figures. But my best\r\ninformation goes to fix his share no higher than four hundred thousand\r\npounds. By the scheme of the present ministry for adding to the\r\nprincipal twelve per cent from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four\r\nhundred thousand pounds, that smallest of the sums ever mentioned for\r\nMr. Benfield, will form a capital of 592,000_l._ at six per cent. Thus,\r\nbesides the arrears of three years, amounting to 106,500_l._, (which, as\r\nfast as received, may be legally lent out at twelve per cent,) Benfield\r\nhas received, by the ministerial grant before you, an annuity of\r\n35,520_l._ a year, charged on the public revenues.\r\n\r\nOur mirror of ministers of finance did not think this enough for the\r\nservices of such a friend as Benfield. He found that Lord Macartney, in\r\norder to frighten the Court of Directors from the project of obliging\r\nthe Nabob to give soucar security for his debt, assured them, that, if\r\nthey should take that step, Benfield[60] would infallibly be the soucar,\r\nand would thereby become the entire master of the Carnatic. What Lord\r\nMacartney thought sufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with\r\nBenfield in his iniquities was the inducement to the two right honorable\r\ngentlemen to order this very soucar security to be given, and to recall\r\nBenfield to the city of Madras from the sort of decent exile into which\r\nhe had been relegated by Lord Macartney. You must therefore consider\r\nBenfield as soucar security for 480,000_l._ a year, which, at\r\ntwenty-four per cent, (supposing him contented with that profit,) will,\r\nwith the interest of his old debt, produce an annual income of\r\n149,520_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nHere is a specimen of the new and pure aristocracy created by the right\r\nhonorable gentleman,[61] as the support of the crown and Constitution\r\nagainst the old, corrupt, refractory, natural interests of this kingdom;\r\nand this is the grand counterpoise against all odious coalitions of\r\nthese interests. A single Benfield outweighs them all: a criminal, who\r\nlong since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal, is by\r\nhis Majesty's ministers enthroned in the government of a great kingdom,\r\nand enfeoffed with an estate which in the comparison effaces the\r\nsplendor of all the nobility of Europe. To bring a little more\r\ndistinctly into view the true secret of this dark transaction, I beg you\r\nparticularly to advert to the circumstances which I am going to place\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nThe general corps of creditors, as well as Mr. Benfield himself, not\r\nlooking well into futurity, nor presaging the minister of this day,\r\nthought it not expedient for their common interest that such a name as\r\nhis should stand at the head of their list. It was therefore agreed\r\namongst them that Mr. Benfield should disappear, by making over his debt\r\nto Messrs. Taylor, Majendie, and Call, and should in return be secured\r\nby their bond.\r\n\r\nThe debt thus exonerated of so great a weight of its odium, and\r\notherwise reduced from its alarming bulk, the agents thought they might\r\nventure to print a list of the creditors. This was done for the first\r\ntime in the year 1783, during the Duke of Portland's administration. In\r\nthis list the name of Benfield was not to be seen. To this strong\r\nnegative testimony was added the further testimony of the Nabob of\r\nArcot. That prince[62] (or rather Mr. Benfield for him) writes to the\r\nCourt of Directors a letter[63] full of complaints and accusations\r\nagainst Lord Macartney, conveyed in such terms as were natural for one\r\nof Mr. Benfield's habits and education to employ. Amongst the rest he is\r\nmade to complain of his Lordship's endeavoring to prevent an intercourse\r\nof politeness and sentiment between him and Mr. Benfield; and to\r\naggravate the affront, he expressly declares Mr. Benfield's visits to be\r\nonly on account of respect and of gratitude, as no pecuniary transaction\r\nsubsisted between them.\r\n\r\nSuch, for a considerable space of time, was the outward form of the loan\r\nof 1777, in which Mr. Benfield had no sort of concern. At length\r\nintelligence arrived at Madras, that this debt, which had always been\r\nrenounced by the Court of Directors, was rather like to become the\r\nsubject of something more like a criminal inquiry than of any patronage\r\nor sanction from Parliament. Every ship brought accounts, one stronger\r\nthan the other, of the prevalence of the determined enemies of the\r\nIndian system. The public revenues became an object desperate to the\r\nhopes of Mr. Benfield; he therefore resolved to fall upon his\r\nassociates, and, in violation of that faith which subsists among those\r\nwho have abandoned all other, commences a suit in the Mayor's Court\r\nagainst Taylor, Majendie, and Call, for the bond given to him, when he\r\nagreed to disappear for his own benefit as well as that of the common\r\nconcern. The assignees of his debt, who little expected the springing of\r\nthis mine, even from such an engineer as Mr. Benfield, after recovering\r\ntheir first alarm, thought it best to take ground on the real state of\r\nthe transaction. They divulged the whole mystery, and were prepared to\r\nplead that they had never received from Mr. Benfield any other\r\nconsideration for the bond than a transfer, in trust for himself, of his\r\ndemand on the Nabob of Arcot. An universal indignation arose against the\r\nperfidy of Mr. Benfield's proceeding; the event of the suit was looked\r\nupon as so certain, that Benfield was compelled to retreat as\r\nprecipitately as he had advanced boldly; he gave up his bond, and was\r\nreinstated in his original demand, to wait the fortune of other\r\nclaimants. At that time, and at Madras, this hope was dull indeed; but\r\nat home another scene was preparing.\r\n\r\nIt was long before any public account of this discovery at Madras had\r\narrived in England, that the present minister and his Board of Control\r\nthought fit to determine on the debt of 1777. The recorded proceedings\r\nat this time knew nothing of any debt to Benfield. There was his own\r\ntestimony, there was the testimony of the list, there was the testimony\r\nof the Nabob of Arcot, against it. Yet such was the ministers' feeling\r\nof the true secret of this transaction, that they thought proper, in the\r\nteeth of all these testimonies, to give him license to return to Madras.\r\nHere the ministers were under some embarrassment. Confounded between\r\ntheir resolution of rewarding the good services of Benfield's friends\r\nand associates in England, and the shame of sending that notorious\r\nincendiary to the court of the Nabob of Arcot, to renew his intrigues\r\nagainst the British government, at the time they authorize his return,\r\nthey forbid him, under the severest penalties, from any conversation\r\nwith the Nabob or his ministers: that is, they forbid his communication\r\nwith the very person on account of his dealings with whom they permit\r\nhis return to that city. To overtop this contradiction, there is not a\r\nword restraining him from the freest intercourse with the Nabob's second\r\nson, the real author of all that is done in the Nabob's name; who, in\r\nconjunction with this very Benfield, has acquired an absolute dominion\r\nover that unhappy man, is able to persuade him to put his signature to\r\nwhatever paper they please, and often without any communication of the\r\ncontents. This management was detailed to them at full length by Lord\r\nMacartney, and they cannot pretend ignorance of it.[64]\r\n\r\nI believe, after this exposure of facts, no man can entertain a doubt of\r\nthe collusion of ministers with the corrupt interest of the delinquents\r\nin India. Whenever those in authority provide for the interest of any\r\nperson, on the real, but concealed state of his affairs, without regard\r\nto his avowed, public, and ostensible pretences, it must be presumed\r\nthat they are in confederacy with him, because they act for him on the\r\nsame fraudulent principles on which he acts for himself. It is plain\r\nthat the ministers were fully apprised of Benfield's real situation,\r\nwhich he had used means to conceal, whilst concealment answered his\r\npurposes. They were, or the person on whom they relied was, of the\r\ncabinet council of Benfield, in the very depth of all his mysteries. An\r\nhonest magistrate compels men to abide by one story. An equitable judge\r\nwould not hear of the claim of a man who had himself thought proper to\r\nrenounce it. With such a judge his shuffling and prevarication would\r\nhave damned his claims; such a judge never would have known, but in\r\norder to animadvert upon, proceedings of that character.\r\n\r\nI have thus laid before you, Mr. Speaker, I think with sufficient\r\nclearness, the connection of the ministers with Mr. Atkinson at the\r\ngeneral election; I have laid open to you the connection of Atkinson\r\nwith Benfield; I have shown Benfield's employment of his wealth in\r\ncreating a Parliamentary interest to procure a ministerial protection; I\r\nhave set before your eyes his large concern in the debt, his practices\r\nto hide that concern from the public eye, and the liberal protection\r\nwhich he has received from the minister. If this chain of circumstances\r\ndoes not lead you necessarily to conclude that the minister has paid to\r\nthe avarice of Benfield the services done by Benfield's connections to\r\nhis ambition, I do not know anything short of the confession of the\r\nparty that can persuade you of his guilt. Clandestine and collusive\r\npractice can only be traced by combination and comparison of\r\ncircumstances. To reject such combination and comparison is to reject\r\nthe only means of detecting fraud; it is, indeed, to give it a patent\r\nand free license to cheat with impunity.\r\n\r\nI confine myself to the connection of ministers, mediately or\r\nimmediately, with only two persons concerned in this debt. How many\r\nothers, who support their power and greatness within and without doors,\r\nare concerned originally, or by transfers of these debts, must be left\r\nto general opinion. I refer to the reports of the Select Committee for\r\nthe proceedings of some of the agents in these affairs, and their\r\nattempts, at least, to furnish ministers with the means of buying\r\nGeneral Courts, and even whole Parliaments, in the gross.[65]\r\n\r\nI know that the ministers will think it little less than acquittal, that\r\nthey are not charged with having taken to themselves some part of the\r\nmoney of which they have made so liberal a donation to their partisans,\r\nthough the charge may be indisputably fixed upon the corruption of their\r\npolitics. For my part, I follow their crimes to that point to which\r\nlegal presumptions and natural indications lead me, without considering\r\nwhat species of evil motive tends most to aggravate or to extenuate the\r\nguilt of their conduct. But if I am to speak my private sentiments, I\r\nthink that in a thousand cases for one it would be far less mischievous\r\nto the public, and full as little dishonorable to themselves, to be\r\npolluted with direct bribery, than thus to become a standing auxiliary\r\nto the oppression, usury, and peculation of multitudes, in order to\r\nobtain a corrupt support to their power. It is by bribing, not so often\r\nby being bribed, that wicked politicians bring rum on mankind. Avarice\r\nis a rival to the pursuits of many. It finds a multitude of checks, and\r\nmany opposers, in every walk of life. But the objects of ambition are\r\nfor the few; and every person who aims at indirect profit, and therefore\r\nwants other protection than innocence and law, instead of its rival,\r\nbecomes its instrument. There is a natural allegiance and fealty due to\r\nthis domineering, paramount evil, from all the vassal vices, which\r\nacknowledge its superiority, and readily militate under its banners; and\r\nit is under that discipline alone that avarice is able to spread to any\r\nconsiderable extent, or to render itself a general, public mischief. It\r\nis therefore no apology for ministers, that they have not been bought by\r\nthe East India delinquents, but that they have only formed an alliance\r\nwith them for screening each other from justice, according to the\r\nexigence of their several necessities. That they have done so is\r\nevident; and the junction of the power of office in England with the\r\nabuse of authority in the East has not only prevented even the\r\nappearance of redress to the grievances of India, but I wish it may not\r\nbe found to have dulled, if not extinguished, the honor, the candor, the\r\ngenerosity, the good-nature, which used formerly to characterize the\r\npeople of England. I confess, I wish that some more feeling than I have\r\nyet observed for the sufferings of our fellow-creatures and\r\nfellow-subjects in that oppressed part of the world had manifested\r\nitself in any one quarter of the kingdom, or in any one large\r\ndescription of men.\r\n\r\nThat these oppressions exist is a fact no more denied than it is\r\nresented as it ought to be. Much evil has been done in India under the\r\nBritish authority. What has been done to redress it? We are no longer\r\nsurprised at anything. We are above the unlearned and vulgar passion of\r\nadmiration. But it will astonish posterity, when they read our opinions\r\nin our actions, that, after years of inquiry, we have found out that the\r\nsole grievance of India consisted in this, that the servants of the\r\nCompany there had not profited enough of their opportunities, nor\r\ndrained it sufficiently of its treasures,--when they shall hear that the\r\nvery first and only important act of a commission specially named by act\r\nof Parliament is, to charge upon an undone country, in favor of a\r\nhandful of men in the humblest ranks of the public service, the enormous\r\nsum of perhaps four millions of sterling money.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the most wise and upright government to correct the\r\nabuses of remote, delegated power, productive of unmeasured wealth, and\r\nprotected by the boldness and strength of the same ill-got riches. These\r\nabuses, full of their own wild native vigor, will grow and flourish\r\nunder mere neglect. But where the supreme authority, not content with\r\nwinking at the rapacity of its inferior instruments, is so shameless and\r\ncorrupt as openly to give bounties and premiums for disobedience to its\r\nlaws,--when it will not trust to the activity of avarice in the pursuit\r\nof its own gains,--when it secures public robbery by all the careful\r\njealousy and attention with which it ought to protect property from such\r\nviolence,--the commonwealth then is become totally perverted from its\r\npurposes; neither God nor man will long endure it; nor will it long\r\nendure itself. In that case, there is an unnatural infection, a\r\npestilential taint, fermenting in the constitution of society, which\r\nfever and convulsions of some kind or other must throw off, or in which\r\nthe vital powers, worsted in an unequal struggle, are pushed back upon\r\nthemselves, and, by a reversal of their whole functions, fester to\r\ngangrene, to death,--and instead of what was but just now the delight\r\nand boast of the creation, there will be cast out in the face of the sun\r\na bloated, putrid, noisome carcass, full of stench and poison, an\r\noffence, a horror, a lesson to the world.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we ought not to wait for the fruitless instruction of\r\ncalamity to inquire into the abuses which bring upon us ruin in the\r\nworst of its forms, in the loss of our fame and virtue. But the right\r\nhonorable gentleman[66] says, in answer to all the powerful arguments of\r\nmy honorable friend, \"that this inquiry is of a delicate nature, and\r\nthat the state will suffer detriment by the exposure of this\r\ntransaction.\" But it is exposed; it is perfectly known in every member,\r\nin every particle, and in every way, except that which may lead to a\r\nremedy. He knows that the papers of correspondence are printed, and that\r\nthey are in every hand.\r\n\r\nHe and delicacy are a rare and a singular coalition. He thinks that to\r\ndivulge our Indian politics may be highly dangerous. He! the mover, the\r\nchairman, the reporter of the Committee of Secrecy! he, that brought\r\nforth in the utmost detail, in several vast, printed folios, the most\r\nrecondite parts of the politics, the military, the revenues of the\r\nBritish empire in India! With six great chopping bastards,[67] each as\r\nlusty as an infant Hercules, this delicate creature blushes at the sight\r\nof his new bridegroom, assumes a virgin delicacy; or, to use a more fit,\r\nas well as a more poetic comparison, the person so squeamish, so timid,\r\nso trembling lest the winds of heaven should visit too roughly, is\r\nexpanded to broad sunshine, exposed like the sow of imperial augury,\r\nlying in the mud with all the prodigies of her fertility about her, as\r\nevidence of her delicate amours,--\r\n\r\n    Triginta capitum fœtus enixa jacebat,\r\n    Alba, solo recubans, albi circum ubera nati.\r\n\r\nWhilst discovery of the misgovernment of others led to his own power, it\r\nwas wise to inquire, it was safe to publish: there was then no\r\ndelicacy; there was then no danger. But when his object is obtained, and\r\nin his imitation he has outdone the crimes that he had reprobated in\r\nvolumes of reports and in sheets of bills of pains and penalties, then\r\nconcealment becomes prudence, and it concerns the safety of the state\r\nthat we should not know, in a mode of Parliamentary cognizance, what all\r\nthe world knows but too well, that is, in what manner he chooses to\r\ndispose of the public revenues to the creatures of his politics.\r\n\r\nThe debate has been long, and as much so on my part, at least, as on the\r\npart of those who have spoken before me. But long as it is, the more\r\nmaterial half of the subject has hardly been touched on: that is, the\r\ncorrupt and destructive system to which this debt has been rendered\r\nsubservient, and which seems to be pursued with at least as much vigor\r\nand regularity as ever. If I considered your ease or my own, rather than\r\nthe weight and importance of this question, I ought to make some apology\r\nto you, perhaps some apology to myself, for having detained your\r\nattention so long. I know on what ground I tread. This subject, at one\r\ntime taken up with so much fervor and zeal, is no longer a favorite in\r\nthis House. The House itself has undergone a great and signal\r\nrevolution. To some the subject is strange and uncouth; to several,\r\nharsh and distasteful; to the relics of the last Parliament it is a\r\nmatter of fear and apprehension. It is natural for those who have seen\r\ntheir friends sink in the tornado which raged during the late shift of\r\nthe monsoon, and have hardly escaped on the planks of the general wreck,\r\nit is but too natural for them, as soon as they make the rocks and\r\nquicksands of their former disasters, to put about their new-built\r\nbarks, and, as much as possible, to keep aloof from this perilous lee\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nBut let us do what we please to put India from our thoughts, we can do\r\nnothing to separate it from our public interest and our national\r\nreputation. Our attempts to banish this importunate duty will only make\r\nit return upon us again and again, and every time in a shape more\r\nunpleasant than the former. A government has been fabricated for that\r\ngreat province; the right honorable gentleman says that therefore you\r\nought not to examine into its conduct. Heavens! what an argument is\r\nthis! We are not to examine into the conduct of the Direction, because\r\nit is an old government; we are not to examine into this Board of\r\nControl, because it is a new one. Then we are only to examine into the\r\nconduct of those who have no conduct to account for. Unfortunately, the\r\nbasis of this new government has been laid on old, condemned\r\ndelinquents, and its superstructure is raised out of prosecutors turned\r\ninto protectors. The event has been such as might be expected. But if it\r\nhad been otherwise constituted, had it been constituted even as I\r\nwished, and as the mover of this question had planned, the better part\r\nof the proposed establishment was in the publicity of its proceedings,\r\nin its perpetual responsibility to Parliament. Without this check, what\r\nis our government at home, even awed, as every European government is,\r\nby an audience formed of the other states of Europe, by the applause or\r\ncondemnation of the discerning and critical company before which it\r\nacts? But if the scene on the other side of the globe, which tempts,\r\ninvites, almost compels, to tyranny and rapine, be not inspected with\r\nthe eye of a severe and unremitting vigilance, shame and destruction\r\nmust ensue. For one, the worst event of this day, though it may deject,\r\nshall not break or subdue me. The call upon us is authoritative. Let who\r\nwill shrink back, I shall be found at my post. Baffled, discountenanced,\r\nsubdued, discredited, as the cause of justice and humanity is, it will\r\nbe only the dearer to me. Whoever, therefore, shall at any time bring\r\nbefore you anything towards the relief of our distressed fellow-citizens\r\nin India, and towards a subversion of the present most corrupt and\r\noppressive system for its government, in me shall find a weak, I am\r\nafraid, but a steady, earnest, and faithful assistant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Right Honorable Henry Dundas.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir Thomas Rumbold, late Governor of Madras.\r\n\r\n[3] Appendix, No. 1.\r\n\r\n[4] The whole of the net Irish hereditary revenue is, on a medium of the\r\nlast seven years, about 330,000_l._ yearly.

I mention this\r\ncircumstance to you _with horror_; for the creditors being in general\r\n_servants of the Company_ renders my task, on the part of the Company,\r\n_difficult and invidious_.\" \"I have freed the sanction of this\r\ngovernment from so _corrupt_ a transaction. It is in my mind the most\r\nvenal of all proceedings to give the Company's protection to debts that\r\ncannot bear the light; and though it appears exceedingly alarming, that\r\na country on which you are to depend for resources should be so involved\r\nas to be nearly three years' revenue in debt,--in a country, too, where\r\none year's revenue can never be called _secure_, by men who know\r\nanything of the politics of this part of India.\" \"I think it proper to\r\nmention to you, that, although _the Nabob reports his private debt to\r\namount to upwards of sixty lacs_, yet I understand that it is not quite\r\nso much.\" Afterwards Sir Thomas Rumbold recommended this debt to the\r\nfavorable attention of the Company, but without any sufficient reason\r\nfor his change of disposition.

He\r\ndistinguishes his debts into two sorts: those contracted before the\r\nyear 1766, and those contracted from that year to the year in which he\r\nleft Madras.--Being asked, What he thinks is the original amount of the\r\nold debts? he said, Between twenty-three and twenty-four lacs of\r\npagodas, as well as he can recollect.--Being asked, What was the amount\r\nof that debt when he left Madras? he said, Between four and five lacs of\r\npagodas, as he understood.--Being asked, What was the amount of the new\r\ndebt when he left Madras? he said, In November, 1777, that debt\r\namounted, according to the Nabob's own account, and published at\r\nChepauk, his place of residence, to sixty lacs of pagodas, independent\r\nof the old debt, on which debt of sixty lacs of pagodas the Nabob did\r\nagree to pay an interest of twelve per cent per annum.--Being asked,\r\nWhether this debt was approved of by the Court of Directors? he said, He\r\ndoes not know it was.--Being asked, Whether the old debt was recognized\r\nby the Court of Directors? he said, Yes, it has been; and the Court of\r\nDirectors have sent out repeated orders to the President and Council of\r\nMadras to enforce its recovery and payment.--Being asked, If the\r\ninterest upon the new debt is punctually paid? he said, It was not\r\nduring his residence at Madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he\r\nthinks no more than five per cent interest was paid, in different\r\ndividends of two and one per cent.--Being asked, What is the usual\r\ncourse taken by the Nabob concerning the arrears of interest? he said,\r\nNot having ever lent him moneys himself, he cannot fully answer as to\r\nthe mode of settling the interest with him.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, Whether he has reason to believe the sixty lacs of pagodas\r\nwas all principal money really and truly advanced to the Nabob of\r\nArcot, or a fictitious capital, made up of obligations given by him,\r\nwhere no money or goods were received, or which was increased by the\r\nuniting into it a greater interest than the twelve per cent expressed to\r\nbe due on the capital? he said, He has no reason to believe that the sum\r\nof sixty lacs of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the Nabob,\r\nbecause that sum he thinks is of more value than all the money, goods,\r\nand chattels in the settlement; but he does not know in what mode or\r\nmanner this debt of the Nabob's was incurred or accumulated.--Being\r\nasked, Whether it was not a general and well-grounded opinion at Madras,\r\nthat a great part of this sum was accumulated by obligations, and was\r\nfor services performed or to be performed for the Nabob? he said, He has\r\nheard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes mentioned in\r\nthe above question, but he does not know that it was so.--Being asked,\r\nWhether it was the general opinion of the settlement? he said, He cannot\r\nsay that it was the general opinion, but it was the opinion of a\r\nconsiderable part of the settlement.--Being asked, Whether it was the\r\ndeclared opinion of those that were concerned in the debt, or those that\r\nwere not? he said, It was the opinion of both parties, at least such of\r\nthem as he conversed with.--Being asked, Whether he has reason to\r\nbelieve that the interest really paid by the Nabob, upon obligations\r\ngiven, or money lent, did not frequently exceed twelve per cent? he\r\nsaid, Prior to the 1st of August, 1774, he had had reason to believe\r\nthat a higher interest than twelve per cent was paid by the Nabob on\r\nmoneys lent to him; but from and after that period, when the last act of\r\nParliament took place in India, he does not know that more than twelve\r\nper cent had been paid by the Nabob, or received from him.--Being asked,\r\nWhether it is not his opinion that the Nabob has paid more than twelve\r\nper cent for money due since the 1st of August, 1774? he said, He has\r\nheard that he has, but he does not know it.--Being asked, Whether he has\r\nbeen told so by any considerable and weighty authority, that was like to\r\nknow? he said, He has been so informed by persons who he believes had a\r\nvery good opportunity of knowing it.--Being asked, Whether he was ever\r\ntold so by the Nabob of Arcot himself? he said, He does not recollect\r\nthat the Nabob of Arcot directly told him so, but from what he said he\r\ndid infer that he paid a higher interest than twelve per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith being asked, Whether, in the course of trade, he ever sold\r\nanything to the Nabob of Arcot? he said, In the year 1775 he did sell to\r\nthe Nabob of Arcot pearls to the amount of 32,500 pagodas, for which the\r\nNabob gave him an order or tankah on the country of Tanjore, payable in\r\nsix months, without interest.--Being asked, Whether, at the time he\r\nasked the Nabob his price for the pearls, the Nabob beat down that\r\nprice, as dealers commonly do? he said, No; so far from it, he offered\r\nhim more than he asked by 1000 pagodas, and which he rejected.--Being\r\nasked, Whether, in settling a transaction of discount with the Nabob's\r\nagent, he was not offered a greater discount than 12_l._ per cent? he\r\nsaid, In discounting a soucar's bill for 180,000 pagodas, the Nabob's\r\nagent did offer him a discount of twenty-four per cent per annum, saving\r\nthat it was the usual rate of discount paid by the Nabob; but which he\r\nwould not accept of, thinking himself confined by the act of Parliament\r\nlimiting the interest of moneys to twelve per cent, and accordingly he\r\ndiscounted the bill at twelve per cent per annum only.--Being asked,\r\nWhether he does not think those offers were made him because the Nabob\r\nthought he was a person of some consequence in the settlement? he said,\r\nBeing only a private merchant, he apprehends that the offer was made to\r\nhim more from its being a general practice than from any opinion of his\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\nReferred to from p. 38.\r\n\r\n_A Bill for the Better Government of the Territorial Possessions and\r\nDependencies in India_.\r\n\r\n[ONE OF MR FOX'S INDIA BILLS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the Nabob of\r\nArcot, the Rajah of Tanjore, or any other native protected prince in\r\nIndia, shall not assign, mortgage, or pledge any territory or land\r\nwhatsoever, or the produce or revenue thereof, to any British subject\r\nwhatsoever; neither shall it be lawful to and for any British subject\r\nwhatsoever to take or receive any such assignment, mortgage, or pledge;\r\nand the same are hereby declared to be null and void; and all payments\r\nor deliveries of produce or revenue, under any such assignment, shall\r\nand may be recovered back, by such native prince paying or delivering\r\nthe same, from the person or persons receiving the same, or his or their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nReferred to from pp. 64 and 73.\r\n\r\n(COPY.)\r\n\r\n27th May, 1782.\r\n\r\n_Letter from the Committee of Assigned Revenue, to the President and\r\nSelect Committee, dated 27th May, 1782; with Comparative Statement, and\r\nMinute thereon._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Right Honorable LORD MACARTNEY, K.B., President, and Governor,\r\n&c., Select Committee of Fort St. George.\r\n\r\nMY LORD, AND GENTLEMEN,--\r\n\r\nAlthough we have, in obedience to your commands of the 5th January,\r\nregularly laid before you our proceedings at large, and have\r\noccasionally addressed you upon such points as required your resolutions\r\nor orders for our guidance, we still think it necessary to collect and\r\ndigest in a summary report those transactions in the management of the\r\nassigned revenue which have principally engaged our attention, and\r\nwhich, upon the proceeding, are too much intermixed with ordinary\r\noccurrences to be readily traced and understood.\r\n\r\nSuch a report may be formed with the greater propriety at this time,\r\nwhen your Lordship, &c., have been pleased to conclude your arrangements\r\nfor the rent of several of the Nabob's districts. Our aim in it is\r\nbriefly to explain the state of the Carnatic at the period of the\r\nNabob's assignment,--the particular causes which existed to the\r\nprejudice of that assignment, after it was made,--and the measures which\r\nyour Lordship, &c., have, upon our recommendation, adopted for removing\r\nthose causes, and introducing a more regular and beneficial system of\r\nmanagement in the country.\r\n\r\nHyder Ali having entered the Carnatic with his whole force, about the\r\nmiddle of July, 1780, and employed fire and sword in its destruction for\r\nnear eighteen months before the Nabob's assignment took place, it will\r\nnot be difficult to conceive the state of the country at that period. In\r\nthose provinces which were fully exposed to the ravages of horse, scarce\r\na vestige remained either of population or agriculture: such of the\r\nmiserable inhabitants as escaped the fury of the sword were either\r\ncarried into the Mysore country or left to struggle under the horrors of\r\nfamine. The Arcot and Trichinopoly districts began early to feel the\r\neffects of this desolating war. Tinnevelly, Madura, and Ramnadaporum,\r\nthough little infested with Hyder's troops, became a prey to the\r\nincursions of the Polygars, who stripped them of the greatest part of\r\nthe revenues. Ongole, Nellore, and Palnaud, the only remaining\r\ndistricts, had suffered, but in a small degree.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of war, however, were not the only evils which the\r\nCarnatic experienced. The Nabob's aumildars, and other servants, appear\r\nto have taken advantage of the general confusion to enrich themselves. A\r\nvery small part of the revenue was accounted for; and so high were the\r\nordinary expenses of every district, that double the apparent produce of\r\nthe whole country would not have satisfied them.\r\n\r\nIn this state, which we believe is no way exaggerated, the Company took\r\ncharge of the assigned countries. Their prospect of relief from the\r\nheavy burdens of the war was, indeed, but little advanced by the\r\nNabob's concession; and the revenues of the Carnatic seemed in danger of\r\nbeing irrecoverably lost, unless a speedy and entire change of system\r\ncould be adopted.\r\n\r\nOn our minutes of the 21st January we treated the subject of the\r\nassignment at some length, and pointed out the mischiefs which, in\r\naddition to the effects of the war, had arisen from what we conceived to\r\nbe wrong and oppressive management. We used the freedom to suggest an\r\nentire alteration in the mode of realizing the revenues. We proposed a\r\nconsiderable and immediate reduction of expenses, and a total change of\r\nthe principal aumildars who had been employed under the Nabob.\r\n\r\nOur ideas had the good fortune to receive your approbation; but the\r\nremoval of the Nabob's servants being thought improper at that\r\nparticular period of the collections, we employed our attention chiefly\r\nin preserving what revenue was left the country, and acquiring such\r\nmaterials as might lead to a more perfect knowledge of its former and\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\nThese pursuits, as we apprehended, met with great obstructions from the\r\nconduct of the Nabob's servants. The orders they received were evaded\r\nunder various pretexts; no attention was paid to the strong and repeated\r\napplications made to them for the accounts of their management; and\r\ntheir attachment to the Company's interest appeared, in every instance,\r\nso feeble, that we saw no prospect whatever of success, but in the\r\nappointment of renters under the Company's sole authority.\r\n\r\nUpon this principle, we judged it expedient to recommend that such of\r\nthe Nabob's districts as were in a state to be farmed out might be\r\nimmediately let by a public advertisement, issued in the Company's\r\nname, and circulated through every province of the Carnatic; and, with\r\nthe view of encouraging bidders, we proposed that the countries might be\r\nadvertised for the whole period of the Nabob's assignment, and the\r\nsecurity of the Company's protection promised in the fullest manner to\r\nsuch persons as might become renters.\r\n\r\nThis plan had the desired effect; and the attempts which were secretly\r\nmade to counteract it afforded an unequivocal proof of its necessity:\r\nbut the advantages resulting from it were more pleasingly evinced by the\r\nnumber of proposals that were delivered, and by the terms which were in\r\ngeneral offered for the districts intended to be farmed out.\r\n\r\nHaving so far attained the purposes of the assignment, our attention was\r\nnext turned to the heavy expenses entailed upon the different provinces;\r\nand here, we confess, our astonishment was raised to the highest pitch.\r\nIn the Trichinopoly country the standing disbursements appeared, by the\r\nNabob's own accounts, to be one lac of rupees more than the receipts. In\r\nother districts the charges were not in so high a proportion, but still\r\nrated on a most extravagant scale; and we saw, by every account that was\r\nbrought before us, the absolute necessity of retrenching considerably in\r\nall the articles of expense.\r\n\r\nOur own reason, aided by such inquiries as we were able to make,\r\nsuggested the alterations we have recommended to your Lordship, &c.,\r\nunder this head. You will observe that we have not acted sparingly, but\r\nwe chose rather, in cases of doubt, to incur the hazard of retrenching\r\ntoo much than too little; because it would be easier, after any stated\r\nallowance for expenses, to add what might be necessary than to\r\ndiminish. We hope, however, there will be no material increase in the\r\narticles, as they now stand.\r\n\r\nOne considerable charge upon the Nabob's country was for extraordinary\r\nsibbendies, sepoys, and horsemen, who appeared to us to be a very\r\nunnecessary incumbrance on the revenue. Your Lordship, &c., have\r\ndetermined to receive such of these people as will enlist into the\r\nCompany's service, and discharge the rest. This measure will not only\r\nrelieve the country of a heavy burden, but tend greatly to fix in the\r\nCompany that kind of authority which is requisite for the due collection\r\nof the revenues.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of your determination respecting the Nabob's sepoys, &c.,\r\nevery charge under that head has been struck out of our account of\r\nexpenses. If the whole number of these people be enlisted by the\r\nCompany, there will probably be no more than sufficient to complete\r\ntheir ordinary military establishment. But should the present reduction\r\nof the Nabob's artillery render it expedient, after the war, to make any\r\naddition to the Company's establishment for the purposes of the assigned\r\ncountries, the expense of such addition, whatever it be, must be\r\ndeducted from the present account of savings.\r\n\r\nIn considering the charges of the several districts, in order to\r\nestablish better regulations, we were careful to discriminate those\r\nincurred for troops, kept or supposed to be kept up for the defence of\r\nthe country, from those of the sibbendy, servants, &c., for the\r\ncultivation of the lands and the collection of the revenues, as well as\r\nto pay attention, to such of the established customs of the country,\r\nancient privileges of the inhabitants, and public charities, as were\r\nnecessarily allowed, and appeared proper to be continued, but which,\r\nunder the Nabob's government, were not only rated much higher, but had\r\nbeen blended under one confused and almost unintelligible title of\r\nexpenses of the districts: so joined, perhaps, to afford pleas and means\r\nof secreting and appropriating great part of the revenues to other\r\npurposes than fairly appeared; and certainly betraying the utmost\r\nneglect and mismanagement, as giving latitude for every species of fraud\r\nand oppression. Such a system has, in the few latter years of the\r\nNabob's necessities, brought all his countries into that situation from\r\nwhich nothing but the most rigid economy, strict observance of the\r\nconduct of managers, and the most conciliating attention to the rights\r\nof the inhabitants can possibly recover them.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to lay before your Lordship, &c., the\r\ninclosed statement of the sums at which the districts lately advertised\r\nhave been let, compared with the accounts of their produce delivered by\r\nthe Nabob, and entered on our proceedings of the 21st January,--likewise\r\na comparative view of the former and present expenses.\r\n\r\nThe Nabob's accounts of the produce of these districts state, as we have\r\nsome reason to think, the sums which former renters engaged to pay to\r\nhim, (and which were seldom, if ever, made good,) and not the sums\r\nactually produced by the districts; yet we have the satisfaction to\r\nobserve that the present aggregate rents, upon an average, are equal to\r\nthose accounts. Your Lordship, &c., cannot, indeed, expect, that, in the\r\nmidst of the danger, invasion, and distress which assail the Carnatic on\r\nevery side, the renters now appointed will be able at present to fulfil\r\nthe terms of their leases; but we trust, from the measures we have\r\ntaken, that very little, if any, of the actual collections will be lost,\r\neven during the war,--and that, on the return of peace and tranquillity,\r\nthe renters will have it in their power fully to perform their\r\nrespective agreements.\r\n\r\nWe much regret that the situation of the Arcot province will not admit\r\nof the same settlement which has been made for the other districts; but\r\nthe enemy being in possession of the capital, together with several\r\nother strongholds, and having entirely desolated the country, there is\r\nlittle room to hope for more from it than a bare subsistence to the few\r\ngarrisons we have left there.\r\n\r\nWe shall not fail to give our attention towards obtaining every\r\ninformation respecting this province that the present times will permit,\r\nand to take the first opportunity to propose such arrangements for the\r\nmanagement as we may think eligible.\r\n\r\nWe have the honor to be\r\n\r\nYour most obedient humble servants,\r\n\r\nCHARLES OAKLEY,\r\nEYLES IRWIN,\r\nHALL PLUMER,\r\nDAVID HALIBURTON,\r\nGEORGE MOUBRAY.\r\n\r\nFORT ST.

This man, though not able to resist the Company's\r\narms, _employed in such a deed at the Nabob's instigation_, had industry\r\nand ability. He acquired, _by a series of services_, even the confidence\r\nof the Nabob, who suffered him to _rent apart of the country of which he\r\nhad deprived him of the property_. This man had afforded no motive for\r\nhis rejection by the Nabob, but that of being ready to engage with the\r\nCompany: a motive most powerful, indeed, but not to be avowed.\r\n\r\n[This is the person whom the English instruments of the Nabob of Arcot\r\nhave had the audacity to charge with a corrupt transaction with Lord\r\nMacartney, and, in support of that charge, to produce a forged letter\r\nfrom his Lordship's steward.

It is asserted by the unfortunate\r\nprince above mentioned, that the Company first settled on the coast of\r\nCoromandel under the protection of one of his ancestors. If this be\r\ntrue, (and it is far from unlikely,) the world must judge of the return\r\nthe descendant has met with. The case of another of the victims given up\r\nby the ministry, though not altogether so striking as the former, is\r\nworthy of attention. It is that of the renter of the Province of\r\nNellore.]\r\n\r\nIt is, with a wantonness of falsehood, and indifference to detection,\r\nasserted to you, in proof of the validity of the Nabob's objections,\r\nthat this man's failures had already forced us to remove him: though in\r\nfact he has continued invariably in office; though our _greatest\r\nsupplies have been received from him_; and that, in the disappointment\r\nof your remittances [the remittances from Bengal] and of other\r\nresources, the specie sent us _from Nellore alone_ has sometimes enabled\r\nus to carry on the public business; and that the _present expedition\r\nagainst the French_ must, without _this_ assistance from the assignment,\r\nhave been laid aside, or delayed until it might have become too late.\r\n\r\n[This man is by the ministry given over to the mercy of persons capable\r\nof making charges on him \"_with a wantonness of falsehood, and\r\nindifference to detection_.\" What is likely to happen to him and the\r\nrest of the victims may appear by the following.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Letter to the Governor-General and Council, March 13th, 1782._\r\n\r\nThe speedy termination, to which the people were taught to look, of the\r\nCompany's interference in the revenues, and the vengeance denounced\r\nagainst those who, contrary to the mandate of the Durbar, should be\r\nconnected with them, as reported by Mr. Sullivan, may, as much as the\r\nformer exactions and oppressions of the Nabob in the revenue, as\r\nreported by the commander-in-chief, have deterred some of the fittest\r\nmen from offering to be concerned in it.\r\n\r\nThe timid disposition of the Hindoo natives of this country was not\r\nlikely to be insensible to the specimen of that vengeance given by his\r\nExcellency the Amir, who, upon the mere rumor, that a Bramin, of the\r\nname of Appagee Row, had given proposals to the Company for the\r\nrentership of Vellore, had the temerity to send for him, and to put him\r\nin confinement.\r\n\r\nA man thus seized by the Nabob's sepoys within the walls of Madras gave\r\na general alarm, and government found it necessary to promise the\r\nprotection of the Company, in order to calm the apprehensions of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6.\r\n\r\nReferred to from pp. 101 and 105.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from the Council and Select Committee at Fort St.\r\nGeorge, to the Governor-General and Council, dated 25th May, 1783._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of our duty, we beseech you to consider, as an act of\r\nstrict and necessary justice, previous to reiteration of your orders for\r\nthe surrender of the assignment, how far it would be likely to affect\r\nthird persons who do not appear to have committed any breach of their\r\nengagements. You command us to compel our aumils to deliver over their\r\nrespective charges as shall be appointed by the Nabob, or to retain\r\ntheir trust under his sole authority, if he shall choose to confirm\r\nthem. These aumils are really renters; they were appointed in the room\r\nof the Nabob's aumils, and contrary to his wishes; they have already\r\nbeen rejected by him, and are therefore not likely to be confirmed by\r\nhim. They applied to this government, in consequence of public\r\nadvertisements in our name, as possessing in this instance the joint\r\nauthority of the Nabob and the Company, and have entered into mutual and\r\nstrict covenants with us, and we with them, relative to the certain\r\ndistricts not actually in the possession of the enemy; by which\r\ncovenants, as they are bound to the punctual payment of their rents and\r\ndue management of the country, so we, and our constituents, and the\r\npublic faith, are in like manner bound to maintain them in the enjoyment\r\nof their leases, during the continuance of the term. That term was for\r\nfive years, agreeably to the words of the assignment, which declare that\r\nthe time of renting shall be for three or five years, as the Governor\r\nshall settle with the renters.--Their leases cannot be legally torn from\r\nthem. Nothing but their previous breach of a part could justify our\r\nbreach of the whole. Such a stretch and abuse of power would, indeed,\r\nnot only savor of the assumption of sovereignty, but of arbitrary and\r\noppressive despotism. In the present contest, whether the Nabob be\r\nguilty, or we be guilty, the renters are not guilty. Whichever of the\r\ncontending parties has broken the condition of the assignment, the\r\nrenters have not broken the condition of their leases. These men, in\r\nconducting the business of the assignment, have acted in opposition to\r\nthe designs of the Nabob, in despite of the menaces denounced against\r\nall who should dare to oppose the mandates of the Durbar justice.\r\nGratitude and humanity require that provision should be made by you,\r\nbefore you set the Nabob's ministers loose on the country, for the\r\nprotection of the victims devoted to their vengeance.\r\n\r\nMr. Benfield, to secure the permanency of his power, and the perfection\r\nof his schemes, thought it necessary to render the Nabob an absolute\r\nstranger to the state of his affairs. He assured his Highness that full\r\njustice was not done to the strength of his sentiments and the keenness\r\nof his attacks, in the translations that were made by the Company's\r\nservants from the original Persian of his letters. He therefore proposed\r\nto him that they should for the future be transmitted in English.--Of\r\nthe English language or writing his Highness or the Amir cannot read one\r\nword, though the latter can converse in it with sufficient fluency. The\r\nPersian language, as the language of the Mahomedan conquerors, and of\r\nthe court of Delhi, as an appendage or signal of authority, was at all\r\ntimes particularly affected by the Nabob. It is the language of all acts\r\nof state, and all public transactions, among the Mussulman chiefs of\r\nHindostan. The Nabob thought to have gained no inconsiderable point, in\r\nprocuring the correspondence from our predecessors to the Rajah of\r\nTanjore to be changed from the Mahratta language, which that Hindoo\r\nprince understands, to the Persian, which he disclaims understanding. To\r\nforce the Rajah to the Nabob's language was gratifying the latter with a\r\nnew species of subserviency. He had formerly contended with considerable\r\nanxiety, and, it was thought, no inconsiderable cost, for particular\r\nforms of address to be used towards him in that language. But all of a\r\nsudden, in favor of Mr. Benfield, he quits his former affections, his\r\nhabits, his knowledge, his curiosity, the increasing mistrust of age, to\r\nthrow himself upon the generous candor, the faithful interpretation, the\r\ngrateful return, and eloquent organ of Mr. Benfield!--_Mr. Benfield\r\nrelates and reads what he pleases to his Excellency the Amir-ul-Omrah;\r\nhis Excellency communicates with the Nabob, his father, in the language\r\nthe latter understands. Through two channels so pure, the truth must\r\narrive at the Nabob in perfect refinement; through this double trust,\r\nhis Highness receives whatever impression it may be convenient to make\r\non him: he abandons his signature to whatever paper they tell him\r\ncontains, in the English language, the sentiments with which they had\r\ninspired him. He thus is surrounded on every side. He is totally at\r\ntheir mercy, to believe what is not true, and to subscribe to what he\r\ndoes not mean. There is no system so new, so foreign to his intentions,\r\nthat they may not pursue in his name, without possibility of detection:\r\nfor they are cautious of who approach him, and have thought prudent to\r\ndecline, for him, the visits of the Governor_, even upon the usual\r\nsolemn and acceptable occasion of delivering to his Highness the\r\nCompany's letters. _Such is the complete ascendency gained by Mr.\r\nBenfield._ It may be partly explained by the facts observed already,\r\nsome years ago, by Mr. Benfield himself, in regard to the Nabob, of the\r\ninfirmities natural to his advanced age, joined to the decays of his\r\nconstitution. To this ascendency, in proportion as it grew, must chiefly\r\nbe ascribed, if not the origin, at least the continuance and increase,\r\nof the Nabob's disunion with this Presidency: a disunion which creates\r\nthe importance and subserves the resentments of Mr. Benfield; _and an\r\nascendency which, if you effect the surrender of the assignment, will\r\nentirely leave the exercise of power and accumulation of fortune at his\r\nboundless discretion: to him, and to the Amir-ul-Omrah, and to Seyd\r\nAssam Cawn, the assignment would in fact be surrendered. HE WILL (IF\r\nANY) BE THE SOUCAR SECURITY; and security in this country is\r\ncounter-secured by possession. You would not choose to take the\r\nassignment from the Company, to give it to individuals_. Of the\r\nimpropriety of its returning to the Nabob, Mr. Benfield would now again\r\nargue from his former observations, that, under his Highness's\r\nmanagement, his country declined, his people emigrated, his revenues\r\ndecreased, and his country was rapidly approaching to a state of\r\npolitical insolvency. Of Seyd Assam Cawn we judge only from the\r\nobservations this letter already contains. But of the other two persons\r\n[Amir-ul-Omrah and Mr. Benfield] we undertake to declare, not as parties\r\nin a cause, or even as voluntary witnesses, but as executive officers,\r\nreporting to you, in the discharge of our duty, and under the impression\r\nof the sacred obligation which binds us to truth, as well as to justice,\r\nthat, from every observation of their principles and dispositions, and\r\nevery information of their character and conduct, they have prosecuted\r\nprojects to the injury and danger of the Company and individuals; _that\r\nit would be improper to trust, and dangerous to employ them, in any\r\npublic or important situation; that the tranquillity of the Carnatic\r\nrequires a restraint to the power of the Amir; and that the Company,\r\nwhose service and protection Mr. Benfield has repeatedly and recently\r\nforfeited, would be more secure against danger and confusion, if he\r\nwere removed from their several Presidencies._\r\n\r\n[After the above solemn declaration from so weighty an authority, the\r\nprincipal object of that awful and deliberate warning, instead of being\r\n\"removed from the several Presidencies,\" is licensed to return to one of\r\nthe principal of those Presidencies, and the grand theatre of the\r\noperations on account of which the Presidency recommends his total\r\nremoval. The reason given is, for the accommodation of that very debt\r\nwhich has been the chief instrument of his dangerous practices, and the\r\nmain cause of all the confusions in the Company's government.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. 7.\r\n\r\nReferred to from pp. 82, 88, and 89.\r\n\r\n_Extracts from the Evidence of Mr. Petrie, late Resident for the Company\r\nat Tanjore, given to the Select Committee, relative to the Revenues and\r\nState of the Country, &c., &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n9th May, 1782.\r\n\r\nWilliam Petrie, Esq., attending according to order, was asked, In what\r\nstation he was in the Company's service? he said, He went to India in\r\nthe year 1765, a writer upon the Madras establishment: he was employed,\r\nduring the former war with Hyder Ali, in the capacity of paymaster and\r\ncommissary to part of the army, and was afterwards paymaster and\r\ncommissary to the army in the first siege of Tanjore, and the\r\nsubsequent campaigns; then secretary to the Secret Department from 1772\r\nto 1775; he came to England in 1775, and returned again to Madras the\r\nbeginning of 1778; he was resident at the durbar of the Rajah of Tanjore\r\nfrom that time to the month of May; and from that time to January, 1780,\r\nwas chief of Nagore and Carrical, the first of which was received from\r\nthe Rajah of Tanjore, and the second was taken from the French.--Being\r\nasked, Who sent him to Tanjore? he said, Sir Thomas Rumbold, and the\r\nSecret Committee.--Being then asked, Upon what errand? he said, He went\r\nfirst up with a letter from the Company to the Rajah of Tanjore: he was\r\ndirected to give the Rajah the strongest assurances that he should be\r\nkept in possession of his country, and every privilege to which he had\r\nbeen restored; he was likewise directed to negotiate with the Rajah of\r\nTanjore for the cession of the seaport and district of Nagore in lieu of\r\nthe town and district of Devicotta, which he had promised to Lord Pigot:\r\nthese were the principal, and, to the best of his recollection at\r\npresent, the only objects in view, when he was first sent up to Tanjore.\r\nIn the course of his stay at Tanjore, other matters of business occurred\r\nbetween the Company and the Rajah, which came under his management as\r\nresident at that durbar.--Being asked, Whether the Rajah did deliver up\r\nto him the town and the annexed districts of Nagore voluntarily, or\r\nwhether he was forced to it? he said, When he made the first proposition\r\nto the Rajah, agreeable to the directions he had received from the\r\nSecret Committee at Madras, in the most free, open, and liberal manner,\r\nthe Rajah told him the seaport of Nagore was entirely at the service of\r\nhis benefactors, the Company, and that he was happy in having that\r\nopportunity of testifying his gratitude to them. These may be supposed\r\nto be words of course; but, from every experience which he had of the\r\nRajah's mind and conduct, whilst he was at Tanjore, he has reason to\r\nbelieve that his declarations of gratitude to the Company were perfectly\r\nsincere. He speaks to the town of Nagore at present, and a certain\r\ndistrict,--not of the districts to the amount of which they afterwards\r\nreceived. The Rajah asked him, To what amount he expected a jaghire to\r\nthe Company? And the witness further said, That he acknowledged to the\r\ncommittee that he was not instructed upon that head; that he wrote for\r\norders to Madras, and was directed to ask the Rajah for a jaghire to a\r\ncertain amount; that this gave rise to a long negotiation, the Rajah\r\nrepresenting to him his inability to make such a gift to the Company as\r\nthe Secret Committee at Madras seemed to expect; while he (the witness)\r\non the other hand, was directed to make as good a bargain as he could\r\nfor the Company. From the view that he then took of the Rajah's\r\nfinances, from the situation of his country, and from the load of debt\r\nwhich pressed hard upon him, he believes he at different times, in his\r\ncorrespondence with the government, represented the necessity of their\r\nbeing moderate in their demands, and it was at last agreed to accept of\r\nthe town of Nagore, valued at a certain annual revenue, and a jaghire\r\nannexed to the town, the whole amounting to 250,000 rupees.--Being\r\nasked, Whether it did turn out so valuable? he said, He had not a doubt\r\nbut it would turn out more, as it was let for more than that to farmers\r\nat Madras, if they had managed the districts properly; _but they were\r\nstrangers to the manners and customs of the people; when they came\r\ndown, they oppressed the inhabitants, and threw the whole district into\r\nconfusion; the inhabitants, many of them, left the country, and deserted\r\nthe cultivation of their lands; of course the farmers were disappointed\r\nof their collections, and they have since failed, and the Company have\r\nlost a considerable part of what the farmers were to pay for the\r\njaghire_.--Being asked, Who these farmers were? he said, One of them was\r\nthe renter of the St. Thomé district, near Madras, and the other, and\r\nthe most responsible, was a Madras dubash.--Being asked, Whom he was\r\ndubash to? he said, To Mr. Cass-major.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, Whether the lease was made upon higher terms than the\r\ndistrict was rated to him by the Rajah? he said, It was.--Being then\r\nasked, What reason was assigned why the district was not kept under the\r\nformer management by aumildars, or let to persons in the Tanjore country\r\nacquainted with the district? he said, No reasons were assigned: he was\r\ndirected from Madras to advertise them to be let to persons of the\r\ncountry; but before he received any proposal, he received accounts that\r\nthey were let at Madras, in consequence of public advertisements which\r\nhad been made there: he believes, indeed, there were very few men in\r\nthose districts responsible enough to have been intrusted with the\r\nmanagement of those lands.--Being asked, Whether, at the time he was\r\nauthorized to negotiate for Nagore in the place of Devicotta, Devicotta\r\nwas given up to the Rajah? he said, No.--Being asked, Whether the Rajah\r\nof Tanjore did not frequently desire that the districts of Arnee and\r\nHanamantagoody should be restored to him, agreeable to treaty, and the\r\nCompany's orders to Lord Pigot? he said, Many a time; and he\r\ntransmitted his representations regularly to Madras.--Being then asked,\r\nWhether those places were restored to him? he said, Not while he was in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, Whether he was not authorized and required by the\r\nPresidency at Madras to demand a large sum of money over and above the\r\nfour lacs of pagodas that were to be annually paid by a grant of the\r\nRajah, made in the time of Lord Pigot? he said, He was: to the amount,\r\nhe believes, of four lacs of pagodas, commonly known by the name of\r\ndeposit-money.--Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not frequently plead\r\nhis inability to pay that money? he said, He did every time he mentioned\r\nit, and complained loudly of the demand.--Being asked, Whether he thinks\r\nthose complaints were well founded? he says, He thinks the Rajah of\r\nTanjore was not only not in a state of ability to pay the deposit-money,\r\nbut that the annual payment of four lacs of pagodas was more than his\r\nrevenues could afford.--Being asked, Whether he was not frequently\r\nobliged to borrow money, in order to pay the instalments of the annual\r\npayments, and such parts as he paid of the deposit? he said, Yes, he\r\nwas.--Being asked, Where he borrowed the money? he said, He believes\r\nprincipally from soucars or native bankers, and some at Madras, as he\r\ntold him.--Being asked, Whether he told him that his credit was very\r\ngood, and that he borrowed upon moderate interest? he said, That he told\r\nhim he found great difficulties in raising money, and was obliged to\r\nborrow at a most exorbitant interest, even some of it at forty-eight per\r\ncent, and he believes not a great deal under it. _He desired him (the\r\nwitness) to speak to one of the soucars or bankers at Tanjore to\r\naccommodate him with a loan of money: that man showed him an account\r\nbetween him and the Rajah, from which it appeared that he charged\r\nforty-eight per cent, besides compound interest_.--Being asked, Whether\r\nthe sums duo were large? he said, Yes, they were considerable; though he\r\ndoes not recollect the amount.--Being asked, Whether the banker lent the\r\nmoney? he said, He would not, unless the witness could procure him\r\npayment of his old arrears.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, What notice did the government of Madras take of the king\r\nof Tanjore's representations of the state of his affairs, and his\r\ninability to pay? he said, He does not recollect, that, in their\r\ncorrespondence with him, there was any reasoning upon the subject; and\r\nin his correspondence with Sir Thomas Rumbold, upon the amount of the\r\njaghire, he seemed very desirous of adapting the demand of government to\r\nthe Rajah's circumstances; but, whilst he stayed at Tanjore, the Rajah\r\nwas not exonerated from any part of his burdens.--Being asked, Whether\r\nthey ever desired the Rajah to make up a statement of his accounts,\r\ndisbursements, debts, and payments to the Company, in order to ascertain\r\nwhether the country was able to pay the increasing demands upon it? he\r\nsaid, Through him he is certain they never did.--Being then asked, If he\r\never heard whether they did through any one else? he said, He never did.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, Whether the Rajah is not bound to furnish the cultivators\r\nof land with seed for their crops, according to the custom of the\r\ncountry? he said, _The king of Tanjore, as proprietor of the land,\r\nalways makes advances of money for seed for the cultivation of the\r\nland._--Being then asked, If money beyond his power of furnishing should\r\nbe extorted from him, might it not prevent, in the first instance, the\r\nmeans of cultivating the country? he said, It certainly does; _he knows\r\nit for a fact; and he knows, that, when he left the country, there were\r\nseveral districts which were uncultivated from that cause_.--Being\r\nasked, Whether it is not necessary to be at a considerable expense in\r\norder to keep up the mounds and watercourses? he said, _A very\r\nconsiderable one annually_.--Being asked, What would be the consequence,\r\nif money should fail for that? he said, _In the first instance, the\r\ncountry would be partially supplied with water, some districts would be\r\noverflowed, and others would be parched_.--Being asked, Whether there is\r\nnot a considerable dam called the Anicut, on the keeping up of which the\r\nprosperity of the country greatly depends, and which requires a great\r\nexpense? he said, Yes, there is: the whole of the Tanjore country is\r\nadmirably well supplied with water, nor can he conceive any method could\r\nbe fallen upon more happily adapted to the cultivation and prosperity of\r\nthe country; but, as the Anicut is the source of that prosperity, any\r\ninjury done to that must essentially affect all the other works in the\r\ncountry: it is a most stupendous piece of masonry, but, from the very\r\ngreat floods, frequently requiring repairs, which if neglected, not only\r\nthe expense of repairing must be greatly increased, but a general injury\r\ndone to the whole country.--Being asked, Whether that dam has been kept\r\nin as good preservation since the prevalence of the English government\r\nas before? he said, From his own knowledge he cannot tell, but from\r\neverything he has read or heard of the former prosperity and opulence of\r\nthe kings of Tanjore, he should suppose not.--Being asked, Whether he\r\ndoes not know of several attempts that have been made to prevent the\r\nrepair, and even to damage the work? he said, The Rajah himself\r\nfrequently complained of that to him, and he has likewise heard it from\r\nothers at Tanjore.--Being asked, Who it was that attempted those acts of\r\nviolence? he said, He was told it was the inhabitants of the Nabob's\r\ncountry adjoining to the Anicut.--Being asked, Whether they were not set\r\non or instigated by the Nabob? he answered, The Rajah said so.--And\r\nbeing asked, What steps the President and Council took to punish the\r\nauthors and prevent those violences? he said, To the best of his\r\nrecollection, the Governor told him he would make inquiries into it, but\r\nhe does not know that any inquiries were made; that Sir Thomas Rumbold,\r\nthe Governor, informed him that he had laid his representations with\r\nrespect to the Anicut before the Nabob, who denied that his people had\r\ngiven any interruption to the repairs of that work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n10th May.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, What he thinks the real clear receipt of the revenues of\r\nTanjore were worth when he left it? he said, He cannot say what was the\r\nnet amount, as he does not know the expense of the Rajah's collection;\r\nbut while he was at Tanjore, he understood from the Rajah himself, and\r\nfrom his ministers, that the gross collection did not exceed nine lacs\r\nof pagodas (360,000_l._).--Being asked, Whether he thinks the country\r\ncould pay the eight lacs of pagodas which had been demanded to be paid\r\nin the course of one year? he said, Clearly not.--Being asked, Whether\r\nthere was not an attempt made to remove the Rajah's minister, upon some\r\ndelay in payment of the deposit? he said, The Governor of Madras wrote\r\nto that effect, which he represented to the Rajah.--Being asked, Who was\r\nmentioned to succeed to the minister that then was, in case he should be\r\nremoved? he said, When Sir Hector Munro came afterwards to Tanjore, the\r\nold daubiere was mentioned, and recommended to the Rajah as successor to\r\nhis then dewan.--Being asked, Of what age was the daubiere at that time?\r\nhe said, Of a very great age: upwards of fourscore.--Being asked,\r\nWhether a person called Kanonga Saba Pilla was not likewise named? he\r\nsaid, Yes, he was: he was recommended by Sir Thomas Rumbold; and one\r\nrecommendation, as well as I can recollect, went through me.--Being\r\nasked, What was the reason of his being recommended? he said, He\r\nundertook to pay off the Rajah's debts, and to give security for the\r\nregular payment of the Rajah's instalments to the Company.--Being asked,\r\nWhether he offered to give any security for preserving the country from\r\noppression, and for supporting the dignity of the Rajah and his people?\r\nhe said, He does not know that he did, or that it was asked of\r\nhim.--Being asked, Whether he was a person agreeable to the Rajah? he\r\nsaid, He was not.--Being asked, Whether he was not a person who had fled\r\nout of the country to avoid the resentment of the Rajah? he said, He\r\nwas.--Being asked, Whether he was not charged by the Rajah with\r\nmalpractices, and breach of trust relative to his effects? he said, He\r\nwas; but he told the Governor that he would account for his conduct, and\r\nexplain everything to the satisfaction of the Rajah.--Being asked,\r\nWhether the Rajah did not consider this man as in the interest of his\r\nenemies, and particularly of the Nabob of Arcot and Mr. Benfield? he\r\nsaid, He does not recollect that he did mention that to him: he\r\nremembers to have heard him complain of a transaction between Kanonga\r\nSaba Pilla and Mr. Benfield; but he told him he had been guilty of a\r\nvariety of malpractices in his administration, that he had oppressed the\r\npeople, and defrauded him.--Being asked, In what branch of business the\r\nRajah had formerly employed him? he said, He was at one time, he\r\nbelieves, renter of the whole country, was supposed to have great\r\ninfluence with the Rajah, and was in fact dewan some time.--Being asked,\r\nWhether the nomination of that man was not particularly odious to the\r\nRajah? he said, He found the Rajah's mind so exceedingly averse to that\r\nman, that he believes he would almost as soon have submitted to his\r\nbeing deposed as to submit to the nomination of that man to be his\r\nprime-minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n13th May.\r\n\r\nMr. Petrie being asked, Whether he was informed by the Rajah, or by\r\nothers, at Tanjore or Madras, that Mr. Benfield, whilst he managed the\r\nrevenues at Tanjore, during the usurpation of the Nabob, did not treat\r\nthe inhabitants with great rigor? he said, He did hear from the Rajah\r\nthat Mr. Benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigor during the time\r\nhe had anything to do with the administration of the revenues of\r\nTanjore.--Being asked, If he recollects in what particulars? he said,\r\nThe Rajah particularly complained that grain had been delivered out to\r\nthe inhabitants, for the purposes of cultivation, at a higher price than\r\nthe market price of grain in the country; he cannot say the actual\r\ndifference of price, but it struck him at the time as something very\r\nconsiderable.--Being asked, Whether that money was all recovered from\r\nthe inhabitants? he said, The Rajah of Tanjore told him that the money\r\nwas all recovered from the inhabitants.--Being asked, Whether he did not\r\nhear that the Nabob exacted from the country of Tanjore, whilst he was\r\nin possession of it? he said, From the accounts which he received at\r\nTanjore of the revenues for a number of years past, it appeared that the\r\nNabob collected from the country, while he was in possession, rather\r\nmore than sixteen lacs of pagodas annually; whereas, when he was at\r\nTanjore, it did not yield more than nine lacs.--Being asked, From whence\r\nthat difference arose? he said, When Tanjore was conquered for the\r\nNabob, he has been told that many thousand of the native inhabitants\r\nfled from the country, some into the country of Mysore, and others into\r\nthe dominions of the Mahrattas; he understood from the same authority,\r\nthat, while the Nabob was in possession of the country, many inhabitants\r\nfrom the Carnatic, allured by the superior fertility and opulence of\r\nTanjore, and encouraged by the Nabob, took up their residence there,\r\nwhich enabled the Nabob to cultivate the whole country; and upon the\r\nrestoration of the Rajah, he has heard that the Carnatic inhabitants\r\nwere carried back to their own country, which left a considerable blank\r\nin the population, which was not replaced while he was there,\r\nprincipally owing to an opinion which prevailed through the country that\r\nthe Rajah's government was not to be permanent, but that another\r\nrevolution was fast approaching. During the Nabob's government, the\r\nprice of grain was considerably higher (owing to a very unusual scarcity\r\nin the Carnatic) than when he was in Tanjore.--Being asked, Whether he\r\nwas ever in the Marawar country? he said, Yes; he was commissary to the\r\narmy in that expedition.--Being asked, Whether that country was much\r\nwasted by the war? he said, Plunder was not permitted to the army, nor\r\ndid the country suffer from its operations, except in causing many\r\nthousands of the inhabitants, who had been employed in the cultivation\r\nof the country, to leave it.--Being asked, Whether he knows what is done\r\nwith the palace and inhabitants of Ramnaut? he said, The town was taken\r\nby storm, but not plundered by the troops; it was immediately delivered\r\nup to the Nabob's eldest son.--Being asked, Whether great riches were\r\nnot supposed to be in that palace and temple? he said, It was\r\nuniversally believed so.--Being asked, What account was given of them?\r\nhe said, He cannot tell; everything remained in the possession of the\r\nNabob.--Being asked, What became of the children and women of the family\r\nof the prince of that country? he said, The Rajah was a minor; the\r\ngovernment was in the hands of the Ranny, his mother: from general\r\nreport he has heard they were carried to Trichinopoly, and placed in\r\nconfinement there.--Being asked, Whether he perceived any difference in\r\nthe face of the Carnatic when he first knew it and when he last knew it?\r\nhe said, He thinks he did, particularly in its population.--Being asked,\r\nWhether it was better or worse? he said, It was not so populous.--Being\r\nasked, What is the condition of the Nabob's eldest son? he said, He was\r\nin the Black Town of Madras, when he left the country.--Being asked,\r\nWhether he was entertained there in a manner suitable to his birth and\r\nexpectations? he said, No: he lived there without any of those exterior\r\nmarks of splendor which princes of his rank in India are particularly\r\nfond of.--Being asked, Whether he has not heard that his appointments\r\nwere poor and mean? he said, He has heard that they were not equal to\r\nhis rank and expectations.--Being asked, Whether he had any share in the\r\ngovernment? he said, He believes none: for some years past the Nabob has\r\ndelegated most of the powers of government to his second son.--Being\r\nasked, Whether the Rajah did not complain to him of the behavior of Mr.\r\nBenfield to himself personally; and what were the particulars? he said,\r\nHe did so, and related to him the following particulars. About fifteen\r\ndays after Lord Pigot's confinement, Mr. Benfield came to Tanjore, and\r\ndelivered the Rajah two letters from the then Governor, Mr.\r\nStratton,--one public, and the other private. He demanded an immediate\r\naccount of the presents which had been made to Lord Pigot, payment of\r\nthe tunkahs which he (Mr. Benfield) had received from the Nabob upon the\r\ncountry, and that the Rajah should only write such letters to the Madras\r\ngovernment as Mr. Benfield should approve and give to him. The Rajah\r\nanswered, that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made\r\nby the Nabob upon the country; that those tunkahs related to accounts\r\nwhich he (the Rajah) had no concern with; that he never had given Lord\r\nPigot any presents, but Lord Pigot had given him many; and that as to\r\nhis correspondence with the Madras government, he would not trouble Mr.\r\nBenfield, because he would write his letters himself. That the Rajah\r\ntold the witness, that by reason of this answer he was much threatened,\r\nin consequence of which he desired Colonel Harper, who then commanded at\r\nTanjore, to be present at his next interview with Mr. Benfield; when\r\nMr. Benfield denied many parts of the preceding conversation, and threw\r\nthe blame upon his interpreter, Comroo. When Mr. Benfield found (as the\r\nRajah informed him) that he could not carry these points which had\r\nbrought him to Tanjore, he prepared to set off for Madras; that the\r\nRajah sent him a letter which he had drawn out in answer to one which\r\nMr. Benfield had brought him; that Mr. Benfield disapproved of the\r\nanswer, and returned it by Comroo to the durbar, who did not deliver it\r\ninto the Rajah's hands, but threw it upon the ground, and expressed\r\nhimself improperly to him.\r\n\r\nBeing asked, Whether it was at the king of Tanjore's desire, that such\r\npersons as Mr. Benfield and Comroo had been brought into his presence?\r\nhe said, The Rajah told him, that, when Lord Pigot came to Tanjore, to\r\nrestore him to his dominions, Comroo, without being sent for, or desired\r\nto come to the palace, had found means to get access to his person: he\r\nmade an offer of introducing Mr. Benfield to the Rajah, which he\r\ndeclined.--Being asked, Whether the military officer commanding there\r\nprotected the Rajah from the intrusion of such people? he said, The\r\nRajah did not tell him that he called upon the military officer to\r\nprevent these intrusions, but that he desired Colonel Harper to be\r\npresent as a witness to what might pass between him and Mr.\r\nBenfield.--Being asked, If it is usual for persons of the conditions and\r\noccupations of Mr. Benfield and Comroo to intrude themselves into the\r\npresence of the princes of the country, and to treat them with such\r\nfreedom? he said, Certainly it is not: less there than in any other\r\ncountry.--Being asked, Whether the king of Tanjore has no ministers to\r\nwhom application might be made to transact such business as Mr. Benfield\r\nand Comroo had to do in the country? he said, Undoubtedly: his minister\r\nis the person whose province it is to transact that business.--Being\r\nasked, Before the invasion of the British troops into Tanjore, what\r\nwould have been the consequence, if Mr. Benfield had intruded himself\r\ninto the Rajah's presence, and behaved in that manner? he said, He could\r\nnot say what would have been the consequence; but the attempt would have\r\nbeen madness, and could not have happened.--Being asked, Whether the\r\nRajah had not particular exceptions to Comroo, and thought he had\r\nbetrayed him in very essential points? he said, Yes, he had.--Being\r\nasked, Whether the Rajah has not been apprised that the Company have\r\nmade stipulations that their servants should not interfere in the\r\nconcerns of his government? he said, He signified it to the Rajah, that\r\nit was the Company's positive orders, and that any of their servants so\r\ninterfering would incur their highest displeasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 8.\r\n\r\nReferred to from p. 87, &c.\r\n\r\n_Commissioners' Amended Clauses for the Fort St. George Dispatch,\r\nrelative to the Indeterminate Mights and Pretensions of the Nabob of\r\nArcot and Rajah of Tanjore._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our letter of the 28th January last we stated the reasonableness of\r\nour expectation that certain contributions towards the expenses of the\r\nwar should be made by the Rajah of Tanjore. Since writing that letter,\r\nwe have received one from the Rajah, of the 15th of October last, which\r\ncontains at length his representations of his inability to make such\r\nfurther payment. We think it unnecessary here to discuss whether these\r\nrepresentations are or are not exaggerated, because, from the\r\nexplanations we have given of our wishes for a new arrangement in\r\nfuture, both with the Nabob of Arcot and the Rajah of Tanjore, and the\r\ndirections we have given you to carry that arrangement into execution,\r\nwe think it impolitic to insist upon any demands upon the Rajah for the\r\nexpenses of the late war, beyond the sum of four lacs of pagodas\r\nannually: such a demand might tend to interrupt the harmony which should\r\nprevail between the Company and the Rajah, and impede the great objects\r\nof the general system we have already so fully explained to you.\r\n\r\nBut although it is not our opinion that any further claim should be made\r\non the Rajah for his share of the extraordinary expenses of the late\r\nwar, it is by no means our intention in any manner to affect the just\r\nclaim which the Nabob has on the Rajah for the arrears due to him on\r\naccount of peshcush, for the regular payment of which we became guaranty\r\nby the treaty of 1762; but we have already expressed to you our hopes\r\nthat the Nabob may be induced to allow these arrears and the growing\r\npayments, when due, to be received by the Company, and carried in\r\ndischarge of his debt to us. You are at the same time to use every means\r\nto convince him, that, when this debt shall be discharged, it is our\r\nintention, as we are bound by the above treaty, to exert ourselves to\r\nthe utmost of our power to insure the constant and regular payment of it\r\ninto his own hands.\r\n\r\nWe observe, by the plan sent to us by our Governor of Fort St. George,\r\non the 30th October, 1781, that an arrangement is there proposed for the\r\nreceipt of those arrears from the Rajah in three years.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to decide how far this proposal may be consistent with the\r\npresent state of the Rajah's resources; but we direct you to use all\r\nproper means to bring these arrears to account as soon as possible,\r\nconsistently with a due attention to this consideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCLAUSES H.\r\n\r\nYou will observe, that, by the 38th section of the late act of\r\nParliament, it is enacted, that, for settling upon a permanent\r\nfoundation the present indeterminate rights of the Nabob of Arcot and\r\nthe Rajah of Tanjore with respect to each other, we should take into our\r\nimmediate consideration the said indeterminate rights and pretensions,\r\nand take and pursue such measures as in our judgment and discretion\r\nshall be best calculated to ascertain and settle the same, according to\r\nthe principles and the terms and stipulations contained in the treaty of\r\n1762 between the said Nabob and the said Rajah.\r\n\r\nOn a retrospect of the proceedings transmitted to us from your\r\nPresidency, on the subject of the disputes which have heretofore arisen\r\nbetween the Nabob and the Rajah, we find the following points remain\r\nunadjusted, viz.\r\n\r\n1st, Whether the jaghire of Arnee shall be enjoyed by the Nabob, or\r\ndelivered up, either to the Rajah, or the descendants of Tremaul Row,\r\nthe late jaghiredar.\r\n\r\n2d, Whether the fort and district of Hanamantagoody, which is admitted\r\nby both parties to be within the Marawar, ought to be possessed by the\r\nNabob, or to be delivered up by him to the Rajah.\r\n\r\n3rd, To whom the government share of the crop of the Tanjore country, of\r\nthe year 1775-6, properly belongs.\r\n\r\nLastly, Whether the Rajah has a right, by usage and custom, or ought,\r\nfrom the necessity of the case, to be permitted to repair such part of\r\nthe Anicut, or dam and banks of the Cavery, as lie within the district\r\nof Trichinopoly, and to take earth and sand in the Trichinopoly\r\nterritory for the repairs of the dam and banks within either or both of\r\nthose districts.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a complete knowledge of the facts and circumstances\r\nrelative to the several points in dispute, and how far they are\r\nconnected with the treaty of 1762, we have with great circumspection\r\nexamined into all the materials before us on these subjects, and will\r\nproceed to state to you the result of our inquiries and deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the treaty of 1762 appear to be restricted to the arrears\r\nof tribute to be paid to the Nabob for his past claims, and to the\r\nquantum of the Rajah's future tribute or peshcush; the cancelling of a\r\ncertain bond given by the Rajah's father to the father of the Nabob; the\r\nconfirmation to the Rajah of the districts of Coveladdy and Elangaud,\r\nand the restoration of Tremaul Row to his jaghire of Arnee, in\r\ncondescension to the Rajah's request, upon certain stipulations, viz.,\r\nthat the fort of Arnee and Doby Gudy should be retained by the Nabob;\r\nthat Tremaul Row should not erect any fortress, walled pagoda, or other\r\nstronghold, nor any wall round his dwelling-house exceeding eight feet\r\nhigh or two feet thick, and should in all things behave himself with\r\ndue obedience to the government; and that he should pay yearly, in the\r\nmonth of July, unto the Nabob or his successors, the sum of ten thousand\r\nrupees: the Rajah thereby becoming the security for Tremaul Row, that he\r\nshould in all things demean and behave himself accordingly, and pay\r\nyearly the stipulated sum.\r\n\r\nUpon a review of this treaty, the only point now in dispute, which\r\nappears to us to be so immediately connected with it as to bring it\r\nwithin the strict line of our duty to ascertain and settle according to\r\nthe terms and stipulations of the treaty, is that respecting Arnee. For,\r\nalthough the other points enumerated may in some respects have a\r\nrelation to that treaty, yet, as they are foreign to the purposes\r\nexpressed in it, and could not be in the contemplation of the\r\ncontracting parties at the time of making it, those disputes cannot in\r\nour comprehension fall within the line of description of rights and\r\npretensions to be now ascertained and settled by us, according to any of\r\nthe terms and stipulations of it.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the jaghire of Arnee, we do not find that our records\r\nafford us any satisfactory information by what title the Rajah claims\r\nit, or what degree of relationship or connection has subsisted between\r\nthe Rajah and the Killadar of Arnee, save only that by the treaty of\r\n1762 the former became the surety for Tremaul Row's performance of his\r\nengagements specified therein, as the conditions for his restoration to\r\nthat jaghire; on the death of Tremaul Row, we perceive that he was\r\nsucceeded by his widow, and after her death, by his grandson\r\nSeneewasarow, both of whom were admitted to the jaghire by the Nabob.\r\n\r\nFrom your Minutes of Consultation of the 31st October, 1770, and the\r\nNabob's letter to the President of the 21st March, 1771, and the two\r\nletters from Rajah Beerbur Atchenur Punt (who we presume was then the\r\nNabob's manager at Arcot) of the 16th and 18th March, referred to in the\r\nNabob's letter, and transmitted therewith to the President, we observe,\r\nthat, previous to the treaty of 1762, Mr. Pigot concurred in the\r\nexpediency of the Nabob's taking possession of this jaghire, on account\r\nof the troublesome and refractory behavior of the Arnee braminees, by\r\ntheir affording protection to all disturbers, who, by reason of the\r\nlittle distance between Arnee and Arcot, fled to the former, and were\r\nthere protected, and not given up, though demanded;--that, though the\r\njaghire was restored in 1762, it was done under such conditions and\r\nrestrictions as were thought best calculated to preserve the peace and\r\ngood order of the place and due obedience to government;--that,\r\nnevertheless, the braminees (quarrelling among themselves) did\r\nafterwards, in express violation of the treaty, enlist and assemble many\r\nthousand sepoys, and other troops; that they erected gaddies and other\r\nsmall forts, provided themselves with wall-pieces, small guns, and other\r\nwarlike stores, and raised troubles and disturbances in the neighborhood\r\nof the city of Arcot and the forts of Arnee and Shaw Gaddy; and that,\r\nfinally, they imprisoned the hircarrahs of the Nabob, sent with his\r\nletters and instructions, in pursuance of the advice of your board, to\r\nrequire certain of the braminees to repair to the Nabob at Chepauk, and,\r\nthough peremptorily required to repair thither, paid no regard to those,\r\nor to any other orders from the circar.\r\n\r\nBy the 13th article contained in the instructions given by the Nabob to\r\nMr. Dupré, as the basis for negotiating the treaty made with the Rajah\r\nin 1771, the Nabob required that the Arnee district should be delivered\r\nup to the circar, because the braminees had broken the conditions which\r\nthey were to have observed. In the answers given by the Rajah to these\r\npropositions, he says, \"I am to give up to the circar the jaghire\r\ndistrict of Arnee\"; and on the 7th of November, 1771, the Rajah, by\r\nletter to Seneewasarow, who appears by your Consultations and country\r\ncorrespondence to have been the grandson of Tremaul Row, and to have\r\nbeen put in possession of the jaghire at your recommendation, (on the\r\ndeath of his grandmother,) writes, acquainting him that he had given the\r\nArnee country, then in his (Seneewasarow's) possession, to the Nabob, to\r\nwhose aumildars Seneewasarow was to deliver up the possession of the\r\ncountry. And in your letter to us of the 28th February, 1772, you\r\ncertified the district of Arnee to be one of the countries acquired by\r\nthis treaty, and to be of the estimated value of two lacs of rupees per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nIn our orders dated the 12th of April, 1775, we declared our\r\ndetermination to replace the Rajah upon the throne of his ancestors,\r\nupon certain terms and conditions, to be agreed upon for the mutual\r\nbenefit of himself and the Company, without infringing the rights of the\r\nNabob. We declared that our faith stood pledged by the treaty of 1762 to\r\nobtain payment of the Rajah's tribute to the Nabob, and that for the\r\ninsuring such payment the fort of Tanjore should be garrisoned by our\r\ntroops. We directed that you should pay no regard to the article of the\r\ntreaty of 1771 which respected the alienation of part of the Rajah's\r\ndominions; and we declared, that, if the Nabob had not a just title to\r\nthose territories before the conclusion of the treaty, we denied that he\r\nobtained any right thereby, except such temporary sovereignty, for\r\nsecuring the payment of his expenses, as is therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese instructions appear to have been executed in the month of April,\r\n1776; and by your letter of the 14th May following you certified to us\r\nthat the Rajah had been put into the possession of the whole country his\r\nfather held in 1762, when the treaty was concluded with the Nabob; but\r\nwe do not find that you came to any resolution, either antecedent or\r\nsubsequent to this advice, either for questioning or impeaching the\r\nright of the Nabob to the sovereignty of Arnee, or expressive of any\r\ndoubt of his title to it. Nevertheless, we find, that, although the\r\nBoard passed no such resolution, yet your President, in his letter to\r\nthe Nabob of the 30th July and 24th August, called upon his Highness to\r\ngive up the possession of Arnee to the Rajah; and the Rajah himself, in\r\nseveral letters to us, particularly in those of 21st October, 1776, and\r\nthe 7th of June, 1777, expressed his expectation of our orders for\r\ndelivering up that fort and district to him; and so recently as the 15th\r\nof October, 1783, he reminds us of his former application, and states,\r\nthat the country of Arnee being guarantied to him by the Company, it of\r\ncourse is his right, but that it has not been given up to him, and he\r\ntherefore earnestly entreats our orders for putting him into the\r\npossession of it. We also observe by your letter of the 14th of October,\r\n1779, that the Rajah had not then accounted for the Nabob's peshcush\r\nsince his restoration, but had assigned as a reason for his withdrawing\r\nit, that the Nabob had retained from him the district of Arnee, with a\r\ncertain other district, (Hanamantagoody,) which is made the subject of\r\nanother part of our present dispatches.\r\n\r\nWe have thus stated to you the result of our inquiry into the grounds of\r\nthe dispute relative to Arnee; and as the research has offered no\r\nevidence in support of the Rajah's claim, nor even any lights whereby we\r\ncan discover in what degree of relationship, by consanguinity, caste, or\r\nother circumstances, the Rajah now stands, or formerly stood, with the\r\nKilladar of Arnee, or the nature of his connection with or command over\r\nthat district, or the authority he exercised or assumed previous to the\r\ntreaty of 1771, we should think ourselves highly reprehensible in\r\ncomplying with the Rajah's request,--and the more so, as it is expressly\r\nstated, in the treaty of 1762, that this fort and district were then in\r\nthe possession of the Nabob, as well as the person of the jaghiredar, on\r\naccount of his disobedience, and were restored him by the Nabob, in\r\ncondescension to the Rajah's request, upon such terms and stipulations\r\nas could not, in our judgment, have been imposed by the one or submitted\r\nto by the other, if the sovereignty of the one or the dependency of the\r\nother had been at that time a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nAlthough these materials have not furnished us with evidence in support\r\nof the Rajah's claim, they are far from satisfactory to evince the\r\njustice of or the political necessity for the Nabob's continuing to\r\nwithhold the jaghire from the descendants of Tremaul Row; his hereditary\r\nright to that jaghire seems to us to have been fully recognized by the\r\nstipulations of the treaty of 1762, and so little doubted, that, on his\r\ndeath, his widow was admitted by the Nabob to hold it, on account, as\r\nmay be presumed, of the nonage of his grandson and heir, Seneewasarow,\r\nwho appears to have been confirmed in the jaghire, on her death, by the\r\nNabob, as the lineal heir and successor to his grandfather.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Seneewasarow, it does not appear, by any of the\r\nProceedings in our possession, that he was concerned in the misconduct\r\nof the braminees, complained of by the Nabob in the year 1770, which\r\nrendered it necessary for his Highness to take the jaghire into his own\r\nhands, or that he was privy to or could have prevented those\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nWe therefore direct, that, if the heir of Tremaul Row is not at present\r\nin possession of the jaghire, and has not, by any violation of the\r\ntreaty, or act of disobedience, incurred a forfeiture thereof, he be\r\nforthwith restored to the possession of it, according to the terms and\r\nstipulations of the treaty of 1762. But if any powerful motive of regard\r\nto the peace and tranquillity of the Carnatic shall in your judgment\r\nrender it expedient to suspend the execution of these orders, in that\r\ncase you are with all convenient speed to transmit to us your\r\nproceedings thereupon, with the full state of the facts, and of the\r\nreasons which have actuated your conduct.\r\n\r\nWe have before given it as our opinion that the stipulations of the\r\ntreaty of 1762 do not apply to the points remaining to be decided. But\r\nthe late act of Parliament having, from the nature of our connection\r\nwith the two powers in the Carnatic, pointed out the expediency, and\r\neven necessity, of settling the several matters in dispute between them\r\nby a speedy and permanent arrangement, we now proceed to give you our\r\ninstructions upon, the several other heads of disputes before\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fort and district of Hanamantagoody, we observe,\r\nthat, on the restoration of the Rajah in 1776, you informed us in your\r\nletter of the 14th of May, That the Rajah had been put into possession\r\nof the whole of the country his father held in 1762, when the treaty was\r\nconcluded with the Nabob; and on the 25th of June you came to the\r\nresolution of putting the Rajah into possession of Hanamantagoody, on\r\nthe ground of its appearing, on reference to the Nabob's instructions to\r\nMr. Dupré in June, 1762, to his reply, and to the Rajah's\r\nrepresentations of 25th March, 1771, that Hanamantagoody was actually in\r\nthe hands of the late Rajah at the time of making the treaty of 1762. We\r\nhave referred as well to those papers as to all the other proceedings on\r\nthis subject, and must confess they fall very short of demonstrating to\r\nus the truth of that fact. And we find, by the Secret Consultations of\r\nFort William of the 7th of August, 1776, that the same doubt was\r\nentertained by our Governor-General and Council.\r\n\r\nBut whether, in point of fact, the late Rajah was or was not in\r\npossession of Hanamantagoody in 1762, it is notorious that the Nabob had\r\nalways claimed the dominion of the countries of which this fort and\r\ndistrict are a part.\r\n\r\nWe observe that the Nabob is now in the actual possession of this fort\r\nand district; and we are not warranted, by any document we have seen, to\r\nconcur with the wishes of the Rajah to dispossess him.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the government share of the crop of 1775-6, we observe by\r\nthe dobeer's memorandum, recited in your Consultations of the 13th of\r\nMay, 1776, that it was the established custom of the Tanjore country to\r\ngather in the harvest and complete the collections within the month of\r\nMarch, but that, for the causes therein particularly stated, the harvest\r\n(and of course the collection of the government share of the crop) was\r\ndelayed till the month of March was over. We also observe that the Rajah\r\nwas not restored to his kingdom until the 11th of April, 1776; and from\r\nhence we infer, that, if the harvest and collection had been finished at\r\nthe usual time, the Nabob (being then sovereign of the country) would\r\nhave received the full benefit of that year's crop.\r\n\r\nAlthough the harvest and collection were delayed beyond the usual time,\r\nyet we find by the Proceedings of your government, and particularly by\r\nMr. Mackay's Minute of the 29th of May, 1776, and also by the dobeer's\r\naccount, that the greatest part of the grain was cut down whilst the\r\nNabob remained in the government of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, from the contradictory allegations on the subject, to\r\nascertain what was the precise amount of the collections made after the\r\nNabob ceased to have the possession of the country. But whatever it was,\r\nit appears from General Stuart's letter of the 2d of April, 1777, that\r\nit had been asserted with good authority that the far greater part of\r\nthe government share of the crop was plundered by individuals, and never\r\ncame to account in the Rajah's treasury.\r\n\r\nUnder all the circumstances of this case, we must be of opinion that the\r\ngovernment share of the crop of 1776 belonged to the Nabob, as the then\r\nreigning sovereign of the kingdom of Tanjore, he being, _de facto_, in\r\nthe full and absolute possession of the government thereof; and\r\nconsequently that the assignments made by him of the government share of\r\nthe crop were valid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we would by no means be understood by this opinion to\r\nsuggest that any further demands ought to be made upon the Rajah, in\r\nrespect of such parts of the government share of the crop as were\r\ncollected by his people.\r\n\r\nFor, on the contrary, after so great a length of time as hath elapsed,\r\nwe should think it highly unjust that the Rajah should be now compelled\r\neither to pay the supposed balances, whatever they may be, or be called\r\nupon to render a specific account of the collection made by his people.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah has already, in his letter to Governor Stratton of the 21st of\r\nApril, 1777, given his assurance, that the produce of the preceding\r\nyear, accounted for to him, was little more than one lac of pagodas; and\r\nas you have acquainted us, by your letter of the 14th of October, 1779,\r\nthat the Rajah has actually paid into our treasury one lac of pagodas,\r\nby way of deposit, on account of the Nabob's claims to the crop, till\r\nour sentiments should be known, we direct you to surcease any further\r\ndemands from the Rajah on that account.\r\n\r\nWe learn by the Proceedings, and particularly by the Nabob's letter to\r\nLord Pigot of the 6th of July, 1776, that the Nabob, previous to the\r\nrestoration of the Rajah, actually made assignments or granted tunkaws\r\nof the whole of his share of the crop to his creditors and troops; and\r\nthat your government, (entertaining the same opinion as we do upon the\r\nquestion of right to that share,) by letter to the Rajah of the 20th of\r\nAugust, 1776, recommended to him \"to restore to Mr. Benfield (one of the\r\nprincipal assignees or tunkaw-holders of the Nabob) the grain of the\r\nlast year, which was in possession of his people, and said to be\r\nforcibly taken from them,--and farther, to give Mr. Benfield all\r\nreasonable assistance in recovering such debts as should appear to have\r\nbeen justly due to him from the inhabitants; and acquainted the Rajah\r\nthat it had been judged by a majority of the Council that it was the\r\nCompany's intention to let the Nabob have the produce of the crop of\r\n1776, but that you had no intention that the Rajah should be accountable\r\nfor more than the government share, whatever that might be; and that you\r\ndid not mean to do more than recommend to him to see justice done,\r\nleaving the manner and time to himself.\" Subsequent representations\r\nappear to have been made to the Rajah by your government on the same\r\nsubject, in favor of the Nabob's mortgages.\r\n\r\nIn answer to these applications, the Rajah, in his letter to Mr.\r\nStratton of the 12th January, 1777, acquainted you \"that he had given\r\norders respecting the grain which Mr. Benfield had heaped up in his\r\ncountry; and with regard to the money due to him by the farmers, that he\r\nhad desired Mr. Benfield to bring accounts of it, that he might limit a\r\ntime for the payment of it proportionably to their ability, and that the\r\nnecessary orders for stopping this money out of the inhabitants' share\r\nof the crop had been sent to the ryots and aumildars; that Mr.\r\nBenfield's gomastah was then present there, and oversaw his affairs; and\r\nthat in everything that was just he (the Rajah) willingly obeyed our\r\nGovernor and Council.\"\r\n\r\nOur opinion being that the Rajah ought to be answerable for no more than\r\nthe amount of what he admits was collected by his people for the\r\ngovernment share of the crop; and the Proceedings before us not\r\nsufficiently explaining whether, in the sum which the Rajah, by his\r\nbefore-mentioned letter of the 21st April, 1777, admits to have\r\ncollected, are included those parts of the government share of the crop\r\nwhich were taken by his people from Mr. Benfield, or from any other of\r\nthe assignees or tunkaw-holders; and uninformed, as we also are, what\r\ncompensation the Rajah has or has not made to Mr. Benfield, or any other\r\nof the parties from whom the grain was taken by the Rajah's people; or\r\nwhether, by means of the Rajah's refusal so to do, or from any other\r\ncircumstance, any of the persons dispossessed of their grain may have\r\nhad recourse to the Nabob for satisfaction: we are, for these reasons,\r\nincompetent to form a proper judgment what disposition ought in justice\r\nto be made of the one lac of pagodas deposited by the Rajah. But as our\r\nsentiments and intentions are so fully expressed upon the whole subject,\r\nwe presume you, who are upon the spot, can have no doubt or difficulty\r\nin making such an application of the deposit as will be consistent with\r\nthose principles of justice whereon our sentiments are founded. But\r\nshould any such difficulty suggest itself, you will suspend any\r\napplication of the deposit, until you have fully explained the same to\r\nus, and have received our further orders.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the repairs of the Anicut and banks of the Cavery we\r\nhave upon various occasions fully expressed to you our sentiments, and\r\nin particular in our general letter of the 4th July, 1777, we referred\r\nyou to the investigation and correspondence on that subject of the year\r\n1764, and to the report made by Mr. James Bourchier, on his personal\r\nsurvey of the waters, and to several letters of the year 1765 and 1767;\r\nwe also, by our said general letter, acquainted you that it appeared to\r\nus perfectly reasonable that the Rajah should be permitted to repair\r\nthose banks, and the Anicut, in the same manner as had been practised in\r\ntimes past; and we directed you to establish such regulations, by\r\nreference to former usage, for keeping the said banks in repair, as\r\nwould be effectual, and remove all cause of complaint in future.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such our instructions, the Rajah, in his letter to us of\r\nthe 15th October, 1783, complains of the destruction of the Anicut; and\r\nas the cultivation of the Tanjore country appears, by all the surveys\r\nand reports of our engineers employed on that service, to depend\r\naltogether on a supply of water by the Cavery, which can only be secured\r\nby keeping the Anicut and banks in repair, we think it necessary to\r\nrepeat to you our orders of the 4th July, 1777, on the subject of those\r\nrepairs.\r\n\r\nAnd further, as it appears by the survey and report of Mr. Pringle, that\r\nthose repairs are attended with a much heavier expense, when done with\r\nmaterials taken from the Tanjore district, than with those of\r\nTrichinopoly, and that the last-mentioned materials are far preferable\r\nto the other, it is our order, that, if any occurrences should make it\r\nnecessary or expedient, you apply to the Nabob, in our name, to desire\r\nthat his Highness will permit proper spots of ground to be set out, and\r\nbounded by proper marks on the Trichinopoly side, where the Rajah and\r\nhis people may at all times take sand and earth sufficient for these\r\nrepairs; and that his Highness will grant his lease of such spots of\r\nland for a certain term of years to the Company, at a reasonable annual\r\nrent, to the intent that through you the cultivation of the Tanjore\r\ncountry may be secured, without infringing or impairing the rights of\r\nthe Nabob.\r\n\r\nIf any attempts have been or shall be hereafter made to divert the water\r\nfrom the Cavery into the Coleroon, by contracting the current of the\r\nUpper or Lower Cavery, by planting long grass, as mentioned in Mr.\r\nPringle's report, or by any other means, we have no doubt his Highness,\r\non a proper representation to him in our name, will prevent his people\r\nfrom taking any measures detrimental to the Tanjore country, in the\r\nprosperity of which his Highness, as well as the Company, is materially\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nShould you succeed in reconciling the Nabob to this measure, we think it\r\nbut just that the proposed lease shall remain no longer in force than\r\nwhilst the Rajah shall be punctual in the payment of the annual peshcush\r\nto the Nabob, as well as the rent to be reserved for the spots of\r\nground. And in order effectually to remove all future occasions of\r\njealousy and complaint between the parties,--that the Rajah, on the one\r\nhand, may be satisfied that all necessary works for the cultivation of\r\nhis country will be made and kept in repair, and that the Nabob, on the\r\nother hand, may be satisfied that no encroachment on his rights can be\r\nmade, nor any works detrimental to the fertility of his country\r\nerected,--we think it proper that it should be recommended to the\r\nparties, as a part of the adjustment of this very important point, that\r\nskilful engineers, appointed by the Company, be employed at the Rajah's\r\nexpense to conduct all the necessary works, with the strictest attention\r\nto the respective rights and interests of both parties. This will remove\r\nevery probability of injury or dispute. But should either party\r\nunexpectedly conceive themselves to be injured, immediate redress might\r\nbe obtained by application to the government of Madras, under whose\r\nappointment the engineer will act, without any discussion between the\r\nparties, which might disturb that harmony which it is so much the wish\r\nof the Company to establish and preserve, as essential to the prosperity\r\nand peace of the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nHaving now, in obedience to the directions of the act of Parliament,\r\nupon the fullest consideration of the indeterminate rights and\r\npretensions of the Nabob and Rajah, pointed out such measures and\r\narrangements as in our judgment and discretion will be best calculated\r\nto ascertain and settle the same, we hope, that, upon a candid\r\nconsideration of the whole system, although each of the parties may feel\r\ndisappointed in our decision on particular points, they will be\r\nconvinced that we have been guided in our investigation by principles of\r\nstrict justice and impartiality, and that the most anxious attention has\r\nbeen paid to the substantial interests of both parties, and such a\r\ngeneral and comprehensive plan of arrangement proposed as will most\r\neffectually prevent all future dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nApproved by the Board.\r\n\r\nHENRY DUNDAS,\r\nWALSINGHAM,\r\nW.W. GRENVILLE,\r\nMULGRAVE.\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, October 27, 1784.\r\n\r\nNo. 9.\r\n\r\nReferred to from pp. 78 and 85.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from the Court of Directors to the President and\r\nCouncil of Fort St. George, as amended and approved by the Board of\r\nControl._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have taken into our consideration the several advices and papers\r\nreceived from India, relative to the assignment of the revenues of the\r\nCarnatic, from the conclusion of the Bengal treaty to the date of your\r\nletter in October, 1783, together with the representations of the Nabob\r\nof the Carnatic upon that subject; and although we might contend that\r\nthe agreement should subsist till we are fully reimbursed his Highness's\r\nproportion of the expenses of the war, yet, from a principle of\r\nmoderation, and personal attachment to our old ally, his Highness the\r\nNabob of the Carnatic, for whose dignity and happiness we are ever\r\nsolicitous, and to cement more strongly, if possible, that mutual\r\nharmony and confidence which our connection makes so essentially\r\nnecessary for our reciprocal safety and welfare, _and for removing from\r\nhis mind every idea of secret design on our part to lessen his authority\r\nover the internal government of the Carnatic_, and the collection and\r\nadministration of its revenues, we have resolved that the assignment\r\nshall be surrendered; and we do accordingly direct our President, in\r\nwhose name the assignment was taken, _without delay_, to surrender the\r\nsame to his Highness. But while we have adopted this resolution, we\r\nrepose entire confidence in his Highness, that, actuated by the same\r\nmotives of liberality, and feelings of old friendship and alliance, he\r\nwill cheerfully and instantly accede to such arrangements as are\r\nnecessary to be adopted for our common safety, and for preserving the\r\nrespect, rights, and interests we enjoy in the Carnatic. The following\r\nare the heads and principles of such an arrangement as we are decisively\r\nof opinion must be adopted for these purposes, viz.\r\n\r\nThat, for making a provision for discharging the Nabob's just debts to\r\nthe Company and individuals, (for the payment of which his Highness has\r\nso frequently expressed the greatest solicitude,) _the Nabob shall give\r\nsoucar security for the punctual payment, by instalments_, into the\r\nCompany's treasury, of twelve lacs of pagodas per annum, (as voluntarily\r\nproposed by his Highness,) until those debts, with interest, shall be\r\ndischarged; and shall also consent that the equitable provision lately\r\nmade by the British legislature for the liquidation of those debts, _and\r\nsuch resolutions and determinations as we shall hereafter make_, under\r\nthe authority of that provision for the liquidation and adjustment of\r\nthe said debts, _bonâ fide_ incurred, shall be carried into full force\r\nand effect.\r\n\r\nShould any difficulty arise between his Highness and our government of\r\nFort St. George, in respect to _the responsibility of the soucar\r\nsecurity_, or the times and terms of the instalments, it is our pleasure\r\nthat you pay obedience to the orders and resolutions of our\r\nGovernor-General and Council of Bengal in respect thereto, not doubting\r\nbut the Nabob will in such case consent to abide by the determination of\r\nour said supreme government.\r\n\r\nAlthough, from the great confidence we repose in the honor and integrity\r\nof the Nabob, and from an earnest desire not to subject him to any\r\nembarrassment on this occasion, we have not proposed any specific\r\nassignment of territory or revenue for securing the payments aforesaid,\r\nwe nevertheless think it our duty, as well to the private creditors,\r\nwhose interests in this respect have been so solemnly intrusted to us by\r\nthe late act of Parliament, as from regard to the debt due to the\r\nCompany, to insist on a declaration, that, in the event of the failure\r\nof the security proposed, or in default of payment at the stipulated\r\nperiods, we reserve to ourselves full right to demand of the Nabob such\r\n_additional security_, by assignment on his country, as shall be\r\neffectual for answering the purposes of the agreement.\r\n\r\nAfter having conciliated the mind of the Nabob to this measure, and\r\nadjusted the particulars, you are to carry the same into execution by a\r\nformal deed between his Highness and the Company, according to the tenor\r\nof these instructions.\r\n\r\nAs the administration of the British interests and connections in India\r\nhas in some respects assumed a new shape by the late act of Parliament,\r\nand a general peace in India has been happily accomplished, the present\r\nappears to us to be the proper period, and which cannot without great\r\nimprudence be omitted, to settle and arrange, by a just and equitable\r\ntreaty, a plan for the future defence and protection of the Carnatic,\r\nboth in time of peace and war, on a solid and lasting foundation.\r\n\r\nFor the accomplishment of this great and necessary object, we direct\r\nyou, in the name of the Company, to use your utmost endeavors to impress\r\nthe expediency of, and the good effects to be derived from this measure,\r\nso strongly upon the minds of the Nabob and the Rajah of Tanjore, as to\r\nprevail upon them, jointly or separately, to enter into one or more\r\ntreaty or treaties with the Company, grounded on this principle of\r\nequity: That all the contracting parties shall be bound to contribute\r\njointly to the support of the military force and garrisons, as well in\r\npeace as in war.\r\n\r\nThat the military peace establishment shall be forthwith settled and\r\nadjusted by the Company, in pursuance of the authority and directions\r\ngiven to them by the late act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nAs the payment of the troops and garrisons, occasional expenses in the\r\nrepairs and improvements of fortifications, and other services\r\nincidental to a military establishment, must of necessity be punctual\r\nand accurate, no latitude of personal assurance or reciprocal confidence\r\nof either of the parties on the other must be accepted or required; but\r\nthe Nabob and Rajah must of necessity specify particular districts and\r\nrevenues for securing the due and regular payment of their contributions\r\ninto the treasury of the Company, with whom the charge of the defence of\r\nthe coast, and of course the power of the sword, must be exclusively\r\nintrusted, with power for the Company, in case of failure or default of\r\nsuch payments at the stipulated times and seasons, to enter upon and\r\npossess such districts, and to let the same to renters, to be confirmed\r\nby the Nabob and the Rajah respectively; but, trusting that in the\r\nexecution of this part of the arrangement no undue obstruction will be\r\ngiven by either of those powers, we direct that this part of the treaty\r\nbe coupled with a most positive assurance, on our part, of our\r\ndetermination to support the dignity and authority of the Nabob and\r\nRajah in the exclusive administration of the civil government and\r\nrevenues of their respective countries;--and further, that, in case of\r\n_any_ hostility committed against the territories of either of the\r\ncontracting parties on the coast of Coromandel, the whole revenues of\r\ntheir respective territories shall be considered as one common stock, to\r\nbe appropriated in the common cause of their defence; that the Company,\r\non their part, shall engage to refrain, _during the war_, from the\r\napplication of any part of their revenues to any commercial purposes\r\nwhatsoever, but apply the whole, save only the ordinary charges of their\r\ncivil government, to the purposes of the war; that the Nabob and the\r\nRajah shall in like manner engage, on their parts, to refrain, during\r\nthe war, from the application of any part of their revenues, save only\r\nwhat shall be actually necessary for the support of themselves and the\r\ncivil government of their respective countries, to any other purposes\r\nthan that of defraying the expenses of such military operations as the\r\nCompany may find it necessary to carry on for the common safety of their\r\ninterests on the coast of Coromandel.\r\n\r\nAnd to obviate any difficulties or misunderstanding which might arise\r\nfrom leaving indeterminate the sum necessary to be appropriated for the\r\ncivil establishment of each of the respective powers, that the sum be\r\nnow ascertained which is indispensably necessary to be applied to those\r\npurposes, and which is to be held sacred under every emergency, and set\r\napart previous to the application of the rest of the revenues, as hereby\r\nstipulated, for the purposes of mutual or common defence against any\r\nenemy, for _clearing_ the incumbrance which may have become necessarily\r\nincurred in addition to the expenditure of those revenues _which must be\r\nalways deemed part of the war establishment_. This we think absolutely\r\nnecessary; as nothing can tend so much to the preservation of peace, and\r\nto prevent the renewal of hostilities, as the early putting the finances\r\nof the several powers upon a clear footing, and the showing to all other\r\npowers that the Company, the Nabob, and the Rajah are firmly united in\r\none common cause, and combined in one system of permanent and vigorous\r\ndefence, for the preservation of their respective territories and the\r\ngeneral tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThat the whole aggregate revenue of the contracting parties shall,\r\nduring the war, be under the application of the Company, and shall\r\ncontinue as long after the war _as shall be necessary, to discharge the\r\nburdens contracted by it_; but it must be declared that this provision\r\nshall in no respect extend to deprive either the Nabob or the Rajah of\r\nthe substantial authority necessary to the collection of the revenues of\r\ntheir respective countries. But it is meant that they shall faithfully\r\nperform the conditions of this arrangement; and if a division of any\r\npart of the revenues to any other than the stipulated purposes shall\r\ntake place, the Company shall be entitled to take upon themselves the\r\ncollection of the revenue.\r\n\r\nThe Company are to engage, during the time they shall administer the\r\nrevenues, to produce to the other contracting parties regular accounts\r\nof the application thereof to the purposes stipulated by the treaty, and\r\nfaithfully apply them in support of the war.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, as the defence of the Carnatic is thus to rest with the\r\nCompany, the Nabob shall be satisfied of the propriety of avoiding all\r\nunnecessary expense, and will therefore agree not to maintain a greater\r\nnumber of troops than shall be necessary for the support of his dignity\r\nand the splendor of the durbar, which number shall be specified in the\r\ntreaty; and if any military aid is requisite for the security and\r\ncollection of his revenues, other than the fixed establishment employed\r\nto enforce the ordinary collections and preserve the police of the\r\ncountry, the Company must be bound to furnish him with such aid: the\r\nRajah of Tanjore must likewise become bound by similar engagements, and\r\nbe entitled to similar aid.\r\n\r\nAs, in virtue of the powers vested in Lord Macartney by the agreement of\r\nDecember, 1781, sundry leases, of various periods, have been granted to\r\nrenters, we direct that you apply to the Nabob, in our name, for his\r\nconsent that they may be _permitted_ to hold their leases to the end of\r\nthe stipulated term; and we have great reliance[70] on the liberality\r\nand spirit of accommodation manifested by the Nabob on so many\r\noccasions, that he will be disposed to acquiesce in a proposition so\r\n_just and reasonable_. But if, contrary to our expectations, his\r\nHighness should be impressed with any particular aversion to comply with\r\nthis proposition, we do not desire you to insist upon it as an essential\r\npart of the arrangement to take place between us; but, in that event,\r\nyou must take especial care to give such indemnification to the renters\r\nfor any loss they may sustain as you judge to be reasonable.\r\n\r\nIt equally concerns the honor of our government, that such natives as\r\nmay have been put in any degree of authority over the collections, in\r\nconsequence of the deed of assignment, and who have proved faithful to\r\ntheir trust, shall not suffer inconvenience on account of their\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given our sentiments at large, as well for the surrender of\r\nthe assignment as with regard to those arrangements which we think\r\nnecessary to adopt in consequence thereof, we cannot dismiss this\r\nsubject without expressing our highest approbation of _the ability,\r\nmoderation, and command of temper_ with which our President at Madras\r\nhas conducted himself in the management of a very delicate and\r\nembarrassing situation. His conduct, and that of the Select Committee of\r\nFort St. George, in the execution of the trust delegated to Lord\r\nMacartney by the Nabob Mahomed Ali, has been vigorous and effectual, for\r\nthe purpose of realizing as great a revenue, at a crisis of necessity,\r\nas the nature of the case admitted; and the imputation of corruption,\r\nsuggested in some of the Proceedings, appears to be totally groundless\r\nand unwarranted.\r\n\r\nWhile we find so much to applaud, it is with regret we are induced to\r\nadvert to anything which may appear worthy of blame: as the step of\r\nissuing the Torana Chits in Lord Macartney's own name can only be\r\njustified upon the ground of absolute necessity;[71] and as his Lordship\r\nhad every reason to believe that the demand, when made, would be\r\nirksome and disagreeable to the feelings of Mahomed Ali, every\r\nprecaution ought to have been used and more time allowed for proving\r\nthat necessity, by previous acts of address, civility, and conciliation,\r\napplied for the purposes of obtaining his authority to such a measure.\r\nIt appears to us that more of this might have been used; and therefore\r\nwe cannot consider the omission of it as blameless, consistent with our\r\nwishes of sanctifying no act contrary to the spirit of the agreement, or\r\nderogatory to the authority of the Nabob of the Carnatic, in the\r\nexercise of any of his just rights in the government of the people under\r\nhis authority.\r\n\r\nWe likewise observe, the Nabob has complained that no official\r\ncommunication was made to him of the peace, for near a month after the\r\ncessation of arms took place. This, and every other mark of disrespect\r\nto the Nabob, will ever appear highly reprehensible in our eyes; and we\r\ndirect that you do, upon all occasions, pay the highest attention to him\r\nand his family.\r\n\r\nLord Macartney, in his Minute of the 9th of September last, has been\r\nfully under our consideration. We shall ever applaud the prudence and\r\nforesight of our servants which induces them to collect and communicate\r\nto us every opinion, or even ground of suspicion they may entertain,\r\nrelative to any of the powers in India with whose conduct our interest\r\nand the safety of our settlements is essentially connected. At the same\r\ntime we earnestly recommend that those opinions and speculations be\r\ncommunicated to us with prudence, discretion, and all possible secrecy,\r\n_and the terms in which they are conveyed be expressed in a manner as\r\nlittle offensive as possible to the powers whom they may concern and\r\ninto whose hands they may fall._[72]\r\n\r\nWe next proceed to give you our sentiments respecting the private debts\r\nof the Nabob; _and we cannot but acknowledge_ that the origin and\r\njustice, both of the loan of 1767, and the loan of 1777, commonly called\r\nthe Cavalry Loan, appear to us clear and indisputable, agreeable to the\r\ntrue sense and spirit of the late act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the loan of 1767, we are to be understood as speaking of\r\nthe debt as constituted by the original bonds of that year, bearing\r\ninterest at 10_l._ per cent; and therefore, if any of the Nabob's\r\ncreditors, under a pretence that their debts made part of the\r\nconsolidated debt of 1767, although secured by bonds of a subsequent\r\ndate, carrying an interest exceeding 10_l._ per cent, shall claim the\r\nbenefit of the following orders, we direct that you pay no regard to\r\nsuch claims, without further especial instructions for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the consolidated debt of 1777, it certainly stands upon\r\na less favorable footing. So early as the 27th March, 1769, it was\r\nordered by our then President and Council of Fort St. George, that, for\r\nthe preventing all persons living under the Company's protection from\r\nhaving any dealings with any of the country powers or their ministers\r\nwithout the knowledge or consent of the Board, an advertisement should\r\nbe published, by fixing it up at the sea-gate, and sending round a copy\r\nto the Company's servants and inhabitants, and to the different\r\nsubordinates, and our garrisons, and giving it out in general orders,\r\nstating therein that the President and Council did consider the\r\nirreversible order of the Court of Directors of the year 1714 (whereby\r\ntheir people were prohibited from having any dealings with the country\r\ngovernments in money matters) to be in full force and vigor, and thereby\r\nexpressly forbidding all servants of the Company, and other Europeans\r\nunder their jurisdiction, to make loans or have any money transactions\r\nwith any of the princes or states in India, without special license and\r\npermission of the President and Council for the time being, except only\r\nin the particular cases there mentioned, and declaring that any wilful\r\ndeviation therefrom should be deemed a breach of orders, and treated as\r\nsuch. And on the 4th of March, 1778, it was resolved by our President\r\nand Council of Fort St George, that the consolidated debt of 1777 was\r\nnot, on any respect whatever, conducted under the auspices or protection\r\nof that government; and on the circumstance of the consolidation of the\r\nsaid debt being made known to us, we did, on the 28rd of December, 1778,\r\nwrite to you in the following terms: \"Your account of the Nabob's\r\nprivate debts is very alarming; but from whatever cause or causes those\r\ndebts have been contracted or increased, we hereby repeat our orders,\r\nthat the sanction of the Company be on no account given to any kind of\r\nsecurity for the payment or liquidation of any part thereof, (except by\r\nthe express authority of the Court of Directors,) on any account or\r\npretence whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe loan of 1777, therefore, has no sanction or authority from us; and\r\nin considering the situation and circumstances of this loan, we cannot\r\nomit to observe, that the creditors could not be ignorant how greatly\r\nthe affairs of the Nabob were at that time deranged, and that his debt\r\nto the Company was then very considerable,--the payment of which the\r\nparties took the most effectual means to postpone, by procuring an\r\nassignment of such specific revenues for the discharge of their own\r\ndebts as alone could have enabled the Nabob to have discharged that of\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances, we should be warranted to refuse our aid\r\nor protection in the recovery of this loan. But when we consider the\r\ninexpediency of keeping the subject of the Nabob's debts longer afloat\r\nthan is absolutely necessary,--when we consider how much the final\r\nconclusion of this business will tend to promote tranquillity, credit,\r\nand circulation of property in the Carnatic,--and when we consider that\r\nthe debtor concurs with the creditor in establishing the justice of\r\nthose debts consolidated in 1777 into gross sums, for which bonds were\r\ngiven, liable to be transferred to persons different from the original\r\ncreditors, and having no share or knowledge of the transactions in which\r\nthe debts originated, and of course how little ground there is to expect\r\nany substantial good to result from an unlimited investigation into\r\nthem, we have resolved so far to recognize the justice of those debts as\r\nto extend to them that protection which, upon _more_ forcible grounds,\r\nwe have seen cause to allow to the other two classes of debts. But\r\nalthough we so far adopt the general presumption in their favor as to\r\nadmit them to a participation in the manner hereafter directed, we do\r\nnot mean to debar you from receiving any complaints against those debts\r\nof 1777, at the instance either of the Nabob himself, or of other\r\ncreditors injured by their being so admitted, or by any other persons\r\nhaving a proper interest, or stating reasonable grounds of objection;\r\nand if any complaints are offered, we order that the grounds of all such\r\nbe attentively examined by you, and be transmitted to us, together with\r\nthe evidence adduced in support of them, for our final decision; and as\r\nwe have before directed that the sum of twelve lacs of pagodas, to be\r\nreceived annually from the Nabob, should be paid into our treasury, it\r\nis our order that the same be distributed according to the following\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThat the debt be made up in the following manner, viz.\r\n\r\nThe debt consolidated in 1767 to be made up to the end of the year 1784,\r\nwith the current interest at ten per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Cavalry Loan to be made up to the same period, with the current\r\ninterest at twelve per cent.\r\n\r\nThe debt consolidated in 1777 to be made up to the same period, with the\r\ncurrent interest at twelve per cent, to November, 1781, and from thence\r\nwith the current interest at six per cent.\r\n\r\nThe twelve lacs annually to be received are then to be applied,--\r\n\r\n1. To the growing interest on the Cavalry Loan, at twelve per cent.\r\n\r\n2. To the growing interest on the debt of 1777, at six per cent.\r\n\r\nThe remainder to be equally divided: one half to be applied to the\r\nextinction of the Company's debt; the other half to be applied to the\r\npayment of growing interest at 10_l._ per cent, and towards the\r\ndischarge of the principal of the debt of 1767.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement to continue till the principal of the debt 1767 is\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThe application of the twelve lacs is, then, to be,--\r\n\r\n1. To the interest of the debt of 1777, as above. The remainder to be\r\nthen equally divided,--one half towards the discharge of the current\r\ninterest and principal of the Cavalry Loan, and the other half towards\r\nthe discharge of the Company's debt.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cavalry Loan shall be thus discharged, there shall then be paid\r\ntowards the discharge of the Company's debt seven lacs.\r\n\r\nTo the growing interest and capital of the 1777 loan, five lacs.\r\n\r\nWhen the Company's debt shall be discharged, the whole is then to be\r\napplied in discharge of the debt 1777.\r\n\r\nIf the Nabob shall be prevailed upon to apply the arrears and growing\r\npayments of the Tanjore peshcush in further discharge of his debts, over\r\nand above the twelve lacs of pagodas, we direct that the whole of that\r\npayment, when made, shall be applied towards the reduction of the\r\nCompany's debt.\r\n\r\nWe have laid down these general rules of distribution, as appearing to\r\nus founded on justice, and the relative circumstances of the different\r\ndebts; and therefore we give our authority and protection to them only\r\non the supposition that they who ask our protection acquiesce in the\r\ncondition upon which it is given; and therefore we expressly order,\r\nthat, if any creditor of the Nabob, a servant of the Company, or being\r\nunder our protection, shall refuse to express his acquiescence in these\r\narrangements, he shall not only be excluded from receiving any share of\r\nthe fund under your distribution, but shall be prohibited from taking\r\nany separate measures to recover his debt from the Nabob: it being one\r\ngreat inducement to our adopting this arrangement, that the Nabob shall\r\nbe relieved from all further disquietude by the importunities of his\r\nindividual creditors, and be left at liberty to pursue those measures\r\nfor the prosperity of his country which the embarrassments of his\r\nsituation have hitherto deprived him of the means of exerting. And we\r\nfurther direct, that, if any creditor shall be found refractory, or\r\ndisposed to disturb the arrangement we have suggested, he shall be\r\ndismissed the service, and sent home to England.\r\n\r\nThe directions we have given only apply to the three classes of debts\r\nwhich have come under our observation. It has been surmised that the\r\nNabob has of late contracted further debts: if any of these are due to\r\nBritish subjects, we forbid any countenance or protection whatever to be\r\ngiven to them, until the debt is fully investigated, the nature of it\r\nreported home, and our special instructions upon it received.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this subject without adverting in the strongest terms\r\nto the prohibitions which have from time to time issued under the\r\nauthority of different Courts of Directors against any of our servants,\r\nor of those under our protection, having any money transactions with any\r\nof the country powers, without the knowledge and previous consent of our\r\nrespective governments abroad. We are happy to find that the Nabob,\r\nsensible of the great embarrassments, both to his own and the Company's\r\naffairs, which the enormous amount of their private claims have\r\noccasioned, is willing to engage not to incur any new debts with\r\nindividuals, and we think little difficulty will be found in persuading\r\nhis Highness into a positive stipulation for that purpose. And though\r\nthe legislature has thus humanely interfered in behalf of such\r\nindividuals as might otherwise have been reduced to great distress by\r\nthe past transactions, we hereby, in the most pointed and positive\r\nterms, repeat our prohibition upon this subject, and direct that no\r\nperson, being a servant of the Company, or being under our protection,\r\nshall, on any pretence whatever, be concerned in any loan or other money\r\ntransaction with any of the country powers, unless with the knowledge\r\nand express permission of our respective governments. And if any of our\r\nservants, or others, being under our protection, shall be discovered in\r\nany respect counteracting these orders, we strictly enjoin you to take\r\nthe first opportunity of sending them home to England, to be punished as\r\nguilty of disobedience of orders, and no protection or assistance of the\r\nCompany shall be given for the recovery of any loans connected with such\r\ntransactions. Your particular attention to this subject is strictly\r\nenjoined; and any connivance on your parts to a breach of our orders\r\nupon it will incur our highest displeasure. In order to put an end to\r\nthose intrigues which have been so successfully carried on at the\r\nNabob's durbar, we repeat our prohibition in the strongest terms\r\nrespecting any intercourse between British subjects and the Nabob and\r\nhis family; as we are convinced that such an intercourse has been\r\ncarried on greatly to the detriment and expense of the Nabob, and merely\r\nto the advantage of individuals. We therefore direct that all persons\r\nwho shall offend against the letter and spirit of this necessary order,\r\nwhether in the Company's service or under their protection, be forthwith\r\nsent to England.\r\n\r\nApproved by the Board.\r\nHENRY DUNDAS,\r\nWALSINGHAM,\r\nW.W. GRENVILLE,\r\nMULGRAVE.\r\nWHITEHALL, 15th Oct. 1784.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the Representation of the Court of Directors of the East\r\nIndia Company._\r\n\r\nMY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,--\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme concern that we express a difference of opinion with\r\nyour right honorable board, in this early exercise of your controlling\r\npower; but in so novel an institution, it can scarce be thought\r\nextraordinary, if the exact boundaries of our respective functions and\r\nduties should not at once, on either side, be precisely and familiarly\r\nunderstood, and therefore confide in your justice and candor for\r\nbelieving that we have no wish to invade or frustrate the salutary\r\npurposes of your institution, as we on our part are thoroughly satisfied\r\nthat you have no wish to encroach on the legal powers of the East India\r\nCompany. We shall proceed to state our objections to such of the\r\namendments as appear to us to be either insufficient, inexpedient, or\r\nunwarranted.\r\n\r\n     6th. Concerning the private debts of the Nabob of Arcot, and the\r\n     application of the fund of twelve lacs of pagodas per annum.\r\n\r\nUnder this head you are pleased, in lieu of our paragraphs, to\r\nsubstantiate at once the justice of all those demands which the act\r\nrequires us to investigate, subject only to a right reserved to the\r\nNabob, or any other party concerned, to question the justice of any debt\r\nfalling within the last of the three classes. We submit, that at least\r\nthe opportunity of questioning, within the limited time, the justice of\r\nany of the debts, ought to have been fully preserved; and supposing the\r\nfirst and second classes to stand free from imputation, (as we incline\r\nto believe they do,) no injury can result to individuals from such\r\ndiscussion: and we further submit to your consideration, how far the\r\nexpress direction of the act to examine the nature and origin of the\r\ndebts has been by the amended paragraphs complied with; and whether at\r\nleast the rate of interest, according to which the debts arising from\r\nsoucar assignment of the land-revenues to the servants of the Company,\r\nacting in the capacity of native bankers, have been accumulated, ought\r\nnot to be inquired into, as well as the reasonableness of the deduction\r\nof twenty-five per cent which the Bengal government directed to be made\r\nfrom a great part of the debts on certain conditions. But to your\r\nappropriation of the fund our duty requires that we should state our\r\nstrongest dissent. Our right to be paid the arrears of those expenses by\r\nwhich, almost to our own ruin, we have preserved the country and all\r\nthe property connected with it from falling a prey to a foreign\r\nconqueror, surely stands paramount to all claims for former debts upon\r\nthe revenues of a country so preserved, even if the legislature had not\r\nexpressly limited the assistance to be given the private creditors to be\r\nsuch as should be consistent with our own rights. The Nabob had, long\r\nbefore passing the act, by treaty with our Bengal government, agreed to\r\npay us seven lacs of pagodas, as part of the twelve lacs, in liquidation\r\nof those arrears; of which seven lacs the arrangement you have been\r\npleased to lay down would take away from us more than the half, and give\r\nit to private creditors, of whose demands there are only about a sixth\r\npart which do not stand in a predicament that you declare would not\r\nentitle them to any aid or protection from us in the recovery thereof,\r\nwere it not upon grounds of expediency, as will more particularly appear\r\nby the annexed estimate. Until our debt shall be discharged, we can by\r\nno means consent to give up any part of the seven lacs to the private\r\ncreditors; and we humbly apprehend that in this declaration we do not\r\nexceed the limits of the authority and rights vested in us.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT HONORABLE THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE AFFAIRS OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n_The Representation of the Court of Directors of the East India\r\nCompany_.\r\n\r\nMy Lords and Gentlemen,--\r\n\r\nThe Court, having duly attended to your reasonings and decisions on the\r\nsubjects of Arnee and Hanamantagoody, beg leave to observe, with due\r\ndeference to your judgment, that the directions we had given in these\r\nparagraphs which did not obtain your approbation still appear to us to\r\nhave been consistent with justice, and agreeable to the late act of\r\nParliament, which pointed out to us, as we apprehended, the treaty of\r\n1762 as our guide.\r\n\r\nSigned by order of the said Court,\r\n\r\nTHO. MORTON, _Sec_.\r\n\r\nEAST INDIA HOUSE, the 3rd November, 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, to\r\nthe Court of Directors, dated 3rd November, 1784, in Answer to their\r\nRemonstrance_.\r\n\r\nSIXTH ARTICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe think it proper, considering the particular nature of the subject, to\r\nstate to you the following remarks on that part of your representation\r\nwhich relates to the plan for the discharging of the Nabob's debts.\r\n\r\n1st. You compute the revenue which the Carnatic may be expected to\r\nproduce only at twenty lacs of pagodas. If we concurred with you in this\r\nopinion, we should certainly feel our hopes of advantage to all the\r\nparties from this arrangement considerably diminished. But we trust that\r\nwe are not too sanguine on this head, when we place the greatest\r\nreliance on the estimate transmitted to you by your President of Fort\r\nSt. George, having there the best means of information upon the fact,\r\nand stating it with a particular view to the subject matter of these\r\nparagraphs. Some allowance, we are sensible, must be made for the\r\ndifference of collection in the Nabob's hands, but, we trust, not such\r\nas to reduce the receipt nearly to what you suppose.\r\n\r\n2ndly. In making up the amount of the private debts, you take in\r\ncompound interest at the different rates specified in our paragraph.\r\nThis it was not our intention to allow; and lest any misconception\r\nshould arise on the spot, we have added an express direction that the\r\ndebts be made up with simple interest only, from the time of their\r\nrespective consolidation. Clause F f.\r\n\r\n3rdly. We have also the strongest grounds to believe that the debts will\r\nbe in other respects considerably less than they are now computed by\r\nyou; and consequently, the Company's annual proportion of the twelve\r\nlacs will be larger than it appears on your estimate. But even on your\r\nown statement of it, if we add to the 150,000_l._, or 3,75,000 pagodas,\r\n(which you take as the annual proportion to be received by the Company\r\nfor five years to the end of 1789,) the annual amount of the Tanjore\r\npeshcush for the same period, and the arrears on the peshcush, (proposed\r\nby Lord Macartney to be received in three years,) the whole will make a\r\nsum not falling very short of pagodas 35,00,000, the amount of pagodas\r\n7,00,000 per annum for the same period. And if we carry our calculations\r\nfarther, it will appear, that, both by the plan proposed by the Nabob\r\nand adopted in your paragraphs, and by that which we transmitted to you,\r\nthe debt from the Nabob, if taken at 3,000,000_l._, will be discharged\r\nnearly at the same period, viz., in the course of the eleventh year. We\r\ncannot, therefore, be of opinion that there is the smallest ground for\r\nobjecting to this arrangement, as injurious to the interests of the\r\nCompany, even if the measure were to be considered on the mere ground\r\nof expediency, and with a view only to the wisdom of reëstablishing\r\ncredit and circulation in a commercial settlement, without any\r\nconsideration of those motives of attention to the feelings and honor of\r\nthe Nabob, of humanity to individuals, and of justice to persons in your\r\nservice and living under your protection, which have actuated the\r\nlegislature, and which afford not only justifiable, but commendable\r\ngrounds for your conduct.\r\n\r\nImpressed with this conviction, we have not made any alteration in the\r\ngeneral outlines of the arrangement which we had before transmitted to\r\nyou. But, as the amount of the Nabob's revenue is matter of uncertain\r\nconjecture, and as it does not appear just to us that any deficiency\r\nshould fall wholly on any one class of these debts, we have added a\r\ndirection to your government of Fort St. George, that, if,\r\nnotwithstanding the provisions contained in our former paragraphs, any\r\ndeficiency should arise, the payments of what shall be received shall be\r\nmade in the same proportion which would have obtained in the division of\r\nthe whole twelve lacs, had they been paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 10.\r\n\r\nReferred to from p. 103.\r\n\r\n[The following extracts are subjoined, to show the matter and the style\r\nof representation employed by those who have obtained that ascendency\r\nover the Nabob of Arcot which is described in the letter marked No. 6 of\r\nthe present Appendix, and which is so totally destructive of the\r\nauthority and credit of the lawful British government at Madras. The\r\ncharges made by these persons have been solemnly denied by Lord\r\nMacartney; and to judge from the character of the parties accused and\r\naccusing, they are probably void of all foundation. But as the letters\r\nare in the name and under the signature of a person of great rank and\r\nconsequence among the natives,--as they contain matter of the most\r\nserious nature,--as they charge the most enormous crimes, and\r\ncorruptions of the grossest kind, on a British governor,--and as they\r\nrefer to the Nabob's minister in Great Britain for proof and further\r\nelucidation of the matters complained of,--common decency and common\r\npolicy demanded an inquiry into their truth or falsehood. The writing is\r\nobviously the product of some English pen. If, on inquiry, these charges\r\nshould be made good, (a thing very unlikely,) the party accused would\r\nbecome a just object of animadversion. If they should be found (as in\r\nall probability they would be found) false and calumnious, and supported\r\nby _forgery_, then the censure would fall on the accuser; at the same\r\ntime the necessity would be manifest for proper measures towards the\r\nsecurity of government against such infamous accusations. It is as\r\nnecessary to protect the honest fame of virtuous governors as it is to\r\npunish the corrupt and tyrannical. But neither the Court of Directors\r\nnor the Board of Control have made any inquiry into the truth or\r\nfalsehood of these charges. They have covered over the accusers and\r\naccused with abundance of compliments; they have insinuated some oblique\r\ncensures; and they have recommended perfect harmony between the chargers\r\nof corruption and peculation and the persons charged with these\r\ncrimes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13th October, 1782. _Extract of a Translation of a Letter from the Nabob\r\nof Arcot to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the East India\r\nCompany_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFatally for me, and for the public interest, the Company's favor and my\r\nunbounded confidence have been lavished on a man totally unfit for the\r\nexalted station in which he has been placed, and unworthy of the trusts\r\nthat have been reposed in him. When I speak of one who has so deeply\r\nstabbed my honor, my wounds bleed afresh, and I must be allowed that\r\nfreedom of expression which the galling reflection of my injuries and my\r\nmisfortunes naturally draws from me. Shall your servants, unchecked,\r\nunrestrained, and unpunished, gratify their private views and ambition\r\nat the expense of my honor, my peace, and my happiness, and to the ruin\r\nof my country, as well as of all your affairs? No sooner had Lord\r\nMacartney obtained the favorite object of his ambition than he betrayed\r\nthe greatest insolence towards me, the most glaring neglect of the\r\ncommon civilities and attentions paid me by all former governors in the\r\nworst of times, and even by the most inveterate of my enemies. He\r\ninsulted my servants, endeavored to defame my character by unjustly\r\ncensuring my administration, and extended his boundless usurpation to\r\nthe whole government of my dominions, in all the branches of judicature\r\nand police; and, in violation of the express articles of the agreements,\r\nproceeded to send renters into the countries, unapproved of by me, men\r\nof bad character, and unequal to my management or responsibility.\r\nThough he is chargeable with the greatest acts of cruelty, even to the\r\nshedding the blood and cutting off the noses and ears of my subjects, by\r\nthose exercising his authority in the countries, and that even the\r\nduties of religion and public worship have been interrupted or\r\nprevented, and though he carries on all his business by the arbitrary\r\nexertion of military force, yet does he not collect from the countries\r\none fourth of the revenue that should be produced. The statement he\r\npretends to hold forth of expected revenue is totally fallacious, and\r\ncan never be realized under the management of his Lordship, in the\r\nappointment of renters totally disqualified, rapacious, and\r\nirresponsible, who are actually embezzling and dissipating the public\r\nrevenues that should assist in the support of the war. Totally occupied\r\nby his private views, and governed by his passions, he has neglected or\r\nsacrificed all the essential objects of public good, and by want of\r\ncoöperation with Sir Eyre Coote, and refusal to furnish the army with\r\nthe necessary supplies, has rendered the glorious and repeated victories\r\nof the gallant general ineffectual to the expulsion of our cruel enemy.\r\nTo cover his insufficiency, and veil the discredit attendant on his\r\nfailure in every measure, he throws out the most illiberal expressions,\r\nand institutes unjust accusations against me; and in aggravation of all\r\nthe distresses imposed upon me, he has abetted the meanest calumniators\r\nto bring forward false charges against me and my son, Amir-ul-Omrah, in\r\norder to create embarrassment, and for the distress of my mind. My\r\npapers and writings sent to you must testify to the whole world the\r\nmalevolence of his designs, and the means that have been used to\r\nforward them. He has violently seized and opened all letters addressed\r\nto me and my servants, on my public and private affairs. My vackeel,\r\nthat attended him according to ancient custom, has been ignominiously\r\ndismissed from his presence, and not suffered to approach the\r\nGovernment-House. He has in the meanest manner, and as he thought in\r\nsecret, been tampering and intriguing with my family and relations for\r\nthe worst of purposes. And if I express the agonies of my mind under\r\nthese most pointed injuries and oppressions, and complain of the\r\nviolence and injustice of Lord Macartney, I am insulted by his affected\r\nconstruction that my communications are dictated by the insinuations of\r\nothers, at the same time that his conscious apprehensions for his\r\nmisconduct have produced the most abject applications to me to smother\r\nmy feelings, and entreaties to write in his Lordship's favor to England,\r\nand to submit all my affairs to his direction. When his submissions have\r\nfailed to mould me to his will, he has endeavored to effect his purposes\r\nby menaces of his secret influence with those in power in England, which\r\nhe pretends to assert shall be effectual to confirm his usurpation, and\r\nto deprive me, and my family, in succession, of my rights of sovereignty\r\nand government forever. To such a length have his passions and violences\r\ncarried him, that all my family, my dependants, and even my friends and\r\nvisitors, are persecuted with the strongest marks of his displeasure.\r\nEvery shadow of authority in my person is taken from me, and respect to\r\nmy name discouraged throughout the whole country. When an officer of\r\nhigh rank in his Majesty's service was some time since introduced to me\r\nby Lord Macartney, his Lordship took occasion to show a personal\r\nderision and contempt of me. Mr. Richard Sulivan, who has attended my\r\ndurbar under the commission of the Governor-General and Council of\r\nBengal, has experienced his resentment; and Mr. Benfield, _with whom I\r\nhave no business_, and who, as he has been accustomed to do for many\r\nyears, has continued to pay me his visits of respect, has felt the\r\nweight of his Lordship's displeasure, and has had every unmerited\r\ninsinuation thrown out against him, to prejudice him, and deter him from\r\npaying me his compliments as usual.\r\n\r\nThus, Gentlemen, have you delivered me over to a stranger; to a man\r\nunacquainted with government and business, and too opinionated to learn;\r\nto a man whose ignorance and prejudices operate to the neglect of every\r\ngood measure, or the liberal coöperation with any that wish well to the\r\npublic interests; to a man who, to pursue his own passions, plans, and\r\ndesigns, will certainly ruin all mine, as well as the Company's affairs.\r\nHis mismanagement and obstinacy have caused the loss of many lacs of my\r\nrevenues, dissipated and embezzled, and every public consideration\r\nsacrificed to his vanity and private views. I beg to offer an instance\r\nin proof of my assertions, and to justify the hope I have that you will\r\ncause to be made good to me all the losses I have sustained by the\r\nmaladministration and bad practices of your servants, according to all\r\nthe account of receipts of former years, and which I made known to Lord\r\nMacartney, amongst other papers of information, in the beginning of his\r\nmanagement in the collections. The district of Ongole produced annually,\r\nupon a medium of many years, 90,000 pagodas; but Lord Macartney, _upon\r\nreceiving a sum of money from Ramchundry_[73] let it out to him, in\r\nApril last, for the inadequate rent of 50,000 pagodas per annum,\r\ndiminishing, in this district alone, near half the accustomed revenues.\r\nAfter this manner hath he exercised his powers over the countries, to\r\nsuit his own purposes and designs; and this secret mode has he taken to\r\nreduce the collections.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n1st November, 1782. _Copy of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the\r\nCourt of Directors, &c._ Received 7th April, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe distresses which I have set forth in my former letters are now\r\nincreased to such an alarming pitch by the imprudent measures of your\r\nGovernor, and by the arbitrary and impolitic conduct pursued with the\r\nmerchants and importers of grain, that the very existence of the Fort of\r\nMadras seems at stake, and that of the inhabitants of the settlement\r\nappears to have been totally overlooked: many thousands have died, and\r\ncontinue hourly to perish of famine, though the capacity of one of your\r\nyoungest servants, with diligence and attention, by doing justice, and\r\ngiving reasonable encouragement to the merchants, and by drawing the\r\nsupplies of grain which the northern countries would have afforded,\r\nmight have secured us against all those dreadful calamities. I had with\r\nmuch difficulty procured and purchased a small quantity of rice, for the\r\nuse of myself, my family, and attendants, and with a view of sending off\r\nthe greatest part of the latter to the northern countries, with a little\r\nsubsistence in their hands. But what must your surprise be, when you\r\nlearn that even this rice was seized by Lord Macartney, with a military\r\nforce! and thus am I unable to provide for the few people I have about\r\nme, who are driven to such extremity and misery that it gives me pain to\r\nbehold them. I have desired permission to get a little rice from the\r\nnorthern countries for the subsistence of my people, without its being\r\nliable to seizure by your sepoys: this even has been refused me by Lord\r\nMacartney. What must your feelings be, on such wanton cruelty exercised\r\ntowards me, when you consider, that, of thousands of villages belonging\r\nto me, a single one would have sufficed for my subsistence!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n22d March, 1783. _Translation of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the\r\nChairman and Directors of the East India Company_. Received from Mr.\r\nJames Macpherson, 1st January, 1784.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am willing to attribute this continued usurpation to the fear of\r\ndetection in Lord Macartney: he dreads the awful day when the scene of\r\nhis enormities will be laid open, at my restoration to my country, and\r\nwhen the tongues of my oppressed subjects will be unloosed, and proclaim\r\naloud the cruel tyrannies they have sustained. These sentiments of his\r\nLordship's designs are corroborated by his sending, on the 10th instant,\r\ntwo gentlemen to me and my son, Amir-ul-Omrah; and these gentlemen from\r\nLord Macartney especially set forth to me, and to my son, that all\r\ndependence on the power of the superior government of Bengal to enforce\r\nthe intentions of the Company to restore my country was vain and\r\ngroundless,--that the Company confided in his Lordship's judgment and\r\ndiscretion, and upon his representations, and that if I, and my son,\r\nAmir-ul-Omrah, would enter into friendship with Lord Macartney, and sign\r\na paper declaring all my charges and complaints against him to be false,\r\nthat his Lordship might be induced to write to England that all his\r\nallegations against me and my son were not well founded, and,\r\nnotwithstanding his declarations to withhold my country, yet, on these\r\nconsiderations, it might be still restored to me.\r\n\r\nWhat must be your feelings for your ancient and faithful friend, on his\r\nreceiving such insults to his honor and understanding from your\r\nprincipal servant, armed with your authority! From these manoeuvres,\r\namongst thousands I have experienced, the truth must evidently appear to\r\nyou, that I have not been loaded with those injuries and oppressions\r\nfrom motives of public service, but to answer the private views and\r\ninterests of his Lordship and his secret agents: _some papers to this\r\npoint are inclosed_; others, almost without number, must be submitted to\r\nyour justice, when time and circumstances shall enable me fully to\r\ninvestigate those transactions. This opportunity will not permit the\r\nfull representation of my load of injuries and distresses: I beg leave\r\nto refer you to my minister, Mr. Macpherson, for the papers, according\r\nto the inclosed list, which accompanied my last dispatches by the\r\nRodney, which I fear have failed; and my correspondence with Lord\r\nMacartney subsequent to that period, such as I have been able to prepare\r\nfor this opportunity, are inclosed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the violent acts and declarations of Lord Macartney,\r\nyet a consciousness of his own misconduct was the sole incentive to the\r\nmenaces and overtures he has held out in various shapes. He has been\r\ninsultingly lavish in his expressions of high respect for my person;\r\nhas had the insolence to say that all his measures flowed from his\r\naffectionate regard alone; has presumed to say that all his enmity and\r\noppression were levelled at my son, Amir-ul-Omrah, to whom he before\r\nacknowledged every aid and assistance; and his Lordship being without\r\nany just cause or foundation for complaint against us, or a veil to\r\ncover his own violences, he has now had recourse to the meanness and has\r\ndared to intimate of my son, in order to intimidate me and to strengthen\r\nhis own wicked purposes, to be in league with our enemies the French.\r\nYou must doubtless be astonished, no less at the assurance than at the\r\nabsurdity of such a wicked suggestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN THE NABOB'S OWN HAND.\r\n\r\nP.S. In my own handwriting I acquainted Mr. Hastings, as I now do my\r\nancient friends the Company, with the insult offered to my honor and\r\nunderstanding, in the extraordinary propositions sent to me by Lord\r\nMacartney, through two gentlemen, on the 10th instant, so artfully\r\nveiled with menaces, hopes, and promises. But how can Lord Macartney add\r\nto his enormities, after his wicked and calumniating insinuations, so\r\nevidently directed against me and my family, through my faithful, my\r\ndutiful, and beloved son, Amir-ul-Omrah, who, you well know, has been\r\never born and bred amongst the English, whom I have studiously brought\r\nup in the warmest sentiments of affection and attachment to\r\nthem,--sentiments that in his maturity have been his highest ambition to\r\nimprove, insomuch that he knows no happiness but in the faithful support\r\nof our alliance and connection with the English nation?\r\n\r\n     12th August, and Postscript of the 16th August, 1783. _Translation\r\n     of a Letter to the Chairman and Directors of the East India\r\n     Company._ Received from Mr. James Macpherson, 14th January, 1784.\r\n\r\nYour astonishment and indignation will be equally raised with mine, when\r\nyou hear that your President _has dared_, contrary to your intention, to\r\ncontinue to usurp the privileges and hereditary powers of the Nabob of\r\nthe Carnatic, your old and unshaken friend, and the declared ally of the\r\nking of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI will not take up your time by enumerating the particular acts of Lord\r\nMacartney's violence, cruelty, and injustice: _they, indeed, occur too\r\nfrequently, and fall upon me and my devoted subjects and country too\r\nthick, to be regularly related_. I refer you to my minister, Mr. James\r\nMacpherson, _for a more circumstantial account of the oppressions and\r\nenormities by which he has brought both mine_ and the Company's affairs\r\nto the brink of destruction. I trust that such flagrant violations of\r\nall justice, honor, and the faith of treaties will receive the severest\r\nmarks of your displeasure, and that Lord Macartney's conduct, in making\r\nuse of your name and authority as a sanction for the continuance of his\r\nusurpation, will be disclaimed with the utmost indignation, and followed\r\nwith the severest punishment. I conceive that his Lordship's arbitrary\r\nretention of my country and government can only originate in his\r\n_insatiable cravings_, in his implacable malevolence against me, and\r\nthrough fear of detection, which must follow the surrender of the\r\nCarnatic into my hands, of those nefarious proceedings which are now\r\nsuppressed by the arm of violence and power.\r\n\r\nI did not fail to represent to the supreme government of Bengal the\r\ndeplorable situation to which I was reduced, and the unmerited\r\npersecutions I have unremittingly sustained from Lord Macartney; and I\r\nearnestly implored them to stretch forth a saving arm, and interpose\r\nthat controlling power which was vested in them, to check _rapacity and\r\npresumption_, and preserve the honor and faith of the Company from\r\nviolation. The Governor-General and Council not only felt the cruelty\r\nand injustice I had suffered, but were greatly alarmed for the fatal\r\nconsequences that might result from the distrust of the country powers\r\nin the professions of the English, when they saw the Nabob of the\r\nCarnatic, the friend of the Company, and the ally of Great Britain, thus\r\nstripped of his rights, his dominions, and his dignity, by the most\r\nfraudulent means, and under the mask of friendship. The Bengal\r\ngovernment had already heard both the Mahrattas and the Nizam urge, as\r\nan objection to an alliance with the English, the faithless behavior of\r\nLord Macartney to a prince whose life had been devoted and whose\r\ntreasures had been exhausted in their service and support; and they did\r\nnot hesitate to give positive orders to Lord Macartney for the\r\nrestitution of my government and authority, on such terms as were not\r\nonly strictly honorable, but equally advantageous to my friends the\r\nCompany: for they justly thought that my honor and dignity and\r\n_sovereign rights_ were the first objects of my wishes and ambition. But\r\nhow can I paint my astonishment at Lord Macartney's presumption in\r\ncontinuing his usurpation after their positive and reiterated mandates,\r\nand, as if nettled by their interference, which he disdained, in\r\nredoubling the fury of his violence, and sacrificing the public and\r\nmyself to his malice and ungovernable passions?\r\n\r\nI am, Gentlemen, at a loss to conceive where his usurpation will stop\r\nand have an end. Has he not solemnly declared that the assignment was\r\nonly made for the support of war? and if neither your instructions nor\r\nthe orders of his superiors at Bengal were to be considered as\r\neffectual, has not the treaty of peace virtually determined the period\r\nof his tyrannical administration? But so far from surrendering the\r\nCarnatic into my hands, he has, since that event, affixed advertisements\r\nto the walls and gates of the Black Town for letting to the best bidder\r\nthe various districts for the term of three years,--and has continued\r\nthe Committee of Revenue, which you positively ordered to be abolished,\r\nto whom he has allowed enormous salaries, from 6000 to 4000 pagodas per\r\nannum, which each member has received from the time of his appointment,\r\nthough his Lordship well knows that most of them are by your orders\r\ndisqualified by being my principal creditors.\r\n\r\nIf those acts of violence and outrage had been productive of public\r\nadvantage, I conceive his Lordship might have held them forward in\r\nextenuation of his conduct; but whilst he cloaks his justification under\r\nthe veil of your records, it is impossible to refute his assertions or\r\nto expose to you their fallacy; and when he is no longer able to support\r\nhis conduct by argument, he refers to those records, where, I\r\nunderstand, he has exercised all his sophistry and malicious\r\ninsinuations to render me and my family obnoxious in the eyes of the\r\nCompany and the British nation. And when the glorious victories of Sir\r\nEyre Coote have been rendered abortive by a constant deficiency of\r\nsupplies,--and when, since the departure of that excellent general to\r\nBengal, whose loss I must ever regret, a dreadful famine, at the close\r\nof last year, occasioned by his Lordship's neglect to lay up a\r\nsufficient stock of grain at a proper season, and from his prohibitory\r\norders to private merchants,--and when no exertion has been made, nor\r\nadvantage gained over the enemy,--when Hyder's death and Tippoo's return\r\nto his own dominions operated in no degree for the benefit of our\r\naffairs,--in short, when all has been a continued series of\r\ndisappointment and disgrace under Lord Macartney's management, (and in\r\nhim alone has the management been vested,)--I want words to convey those\r\nideas of his insufficiency, ignorance, and obstinacy which I am\r\nconvinced you would entertain, had you been spectators of his ruinous\r\nand destructive conduct.\r\n\r\nBut against me, and my son, Amir-ul-Omrah, has his Lordship's vengeance\r\nchiefly been exerted: even the Company's own subordinate zemindars have\r\nfound better treatment, probably because they were more rich; those of\r\nNizanagoram have been permitted, contrary to your pointed orders, to\r\nhold their rich zemindaries at the old disproportionate rate of little\r\nmore than a sixth part of the real revenue; and my zemindar of Tanjore,\r\nthough he should have regarded himself equally concerned with us in the\r\nevent of the war, and from whose fertile country many valuable harvests\r\nhave been gathered in, which have sold at a vast price, has, I\r\nunderstand, only contributed, last year, towards the public exigencies,\r\nthe very inconsiderable sum of one lac of pagodas, and a few thousand\r\npagodas' worth of grain.\r\n\r\nI am much concerned to acquaint you that ever since the peace a dreadful\r\nfamine has swept away many thousands of the followers and sepoys'\r\nfamilies of the army, from Lord Macartney's neglect to send down grain\r\nto the camp, though the roads are crowded with vessels: but his Lordship\r\nhas been too intent upon his own disgraceful schemes to attend to the\r\nwants of the army. The negotiation with Tippoo, which he has set on foot\r\nthrough the mediation of Monsieur Bussy, has employed all his thoughts,\r\nand to the attainment of that object he will sacrifice the dearest\r\ninterests of the Company to gratify his malevolence against me, and for\r\nhis own private advantages. The endeavor to treat with Tippoo, through\r\nthe means of the French, must strike you, Gentlemen, as highly improper\r\nand impolitic; but it must raise your utmost indignation to hear, that,\r\nby intercepted letters from Bussy to Tippoo, as well as from their\r\nrespective vakeels, and from various accounts from Cuddalore, we have\r\nevery reason to conclude that his Lordship's secretary, Mr. Staunton,\r\nwhen at Cuddalore, as his agent to settle the cessation of arms with the\r\nFrench, was informed of all their operations and projects, and\r\n_consequently that Lord Macartney has secretly connived at Monsieur\r\nBussy's recommendation to Tippoo to return into the Carnatic, as the\r\nmeans of procuring the most advantageous terms, and furnishing Lord\r\nMacartney with the plea of necessity for concluding a peace after his\r\nown manner_: and what further confirms the truth of this fact is, that\r\nrepeated reports, as well as the alarms of the inhabitants to the\r\nwestward, leave us no reason to doubt that Tippoo is approaching\r\ntowards us. His Lordship has issued public orders that the garrison\r\nstore of rice, for which we are indebted to the exertions of the Bengal\r\ngovernment, should be immediately disposed of, and has strictly forbid\r\nall private grain to be sold; by which act he effectually prohibits all\r\nprivate importation of grain, and may eventually cause as horrid a\r\nfamine as that which we experienced at the close of last year from the\r\nsame shortsighted policy and destructive prohibitions of Lord Macartney.\r\n\r\nBut as he has the fabrication of the records in his own hands, he trusts\r\nto those partial representations of his character and conduct, because\r\nthe signatures of those members of government whom he seldom consults\r\nare affixed, as a public sanction; but you may form a just idea of their\r\ncorrectness and propriety, when you are informed that his Lordship,\r\n_upon my noticing the heavy disbursements made for secret service money,\r\nordered the sums to be struck off, and the accounts to be erased from\r\nthe cash-book of the Company_; and I think I cannot give you a better\r\nproof of his management of my country and revenues than by calling your\r\nattention to his conduct in the Ongole province, and by referring you to\r\nhis Lordship's administration of your own jaghire, from whence he has\r\nbrought to the public account the sum of twelve hundred pagodas for the\r\nlast year's revenue, yet blazons forth his vast merits and exertions,\r\nand expects to receive the thanks of his Committee and Council.\r\n\r\nI will beg leave to refer you to my minister, James Macpherson, Esq.,\r\nfor a more particular account of my sufferings and miseries, to whom I\r\nhave transmitted copies of all papers that passed with his Lordship.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without calling your attention to _the situation of my\r\ndifferent creditors_, whose claims are the claims of justice, and whose\r\ndemands I am bound by honor and every moral obligation to discharge; it\r\nis not, therefore, without great concern I have heard insinuations\r\ntending to question the legality of their right to the payment of those\r\njust debts: they proceeded from advances made by them openly and\r\nhonorably for the support of my own and the public affairs. But I hope\r\nthe tongue of calumny will never drown the voice of truth and justice;\r\nand while that is heard, the wisdom of the English nation cannot fail to\r\naccede to an effectual remedy for their distresses, by any arrangement\r\nin which their claims may be duly considered and equitably provided for:\r\nand for this purpose, my minister, _Mr. Macpherson, will readily\r\nsubscribe, in my name, to any agreement you may think proper to adopt,\r\nfounded on the same principles_ with either of the engagements I entered\r\ninto with the supreme government of Bengal for our mutual interest and\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nI always pray for your happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     6th September, and Postscript of 7th September, 1783. _Translation\r\n     of a Letter from the Nabob of Arcot to the Chairman and Directors\r\n     of the East India Company._ Received from Mr. James Macpherson,\r\n     14th January, 1784.\r\n\r\nI refer you, Gentlemen, to my inclosed duplicate, as well as to my\r\nminister, Mr. Macpherson, for the particulars of my sufferings. There is\r\nno word or action of mine that is not perverted; and though it was my\r\nintention to have sent my son, Amir-ul-Omrah, who is well versed in my\r\naffairs, to Bengal, to impress those gentlemen with a full sense of my\r\nsituation, yet I find myself obliged to lay it aside, from the\r\ninsinuations of the calumniating tongue of Lord Macartney, that takes\r\nevery license to traduce every action of my life and that of my son. I\r\nam informed that Lord Macartney, at this late moment, intends to write a\r\nletter: I am ignorant of the subject, but fully perceive, that, by\r\ndelaying to send it till the very eve of the dispatch, he means to\r\ndeprive me of all possibility of communicating my reply, and forwarding\r\nit for the information of my friends in England. Conscious of the weak\r\nground on which he stands, he is obliged to have recourse to these\r\nartifices to mislead the judgment, and support for a time his\r\nunjustifiable measures by deceit and imposition. I wish only to meet and\r\ncombat his charges and allegations fairly and openly, and I have\r\nrepeatedly and urgently demanded to be furnished with copies of those\r\nparts of his _fabricated_ records relative to myself; but as he well\r\nknows I should refute his sophistry, I cannot be surprised at his\r\nrefusal, though I lament that it prevents you, Gentlemen, from a clear\r\ninvestigation of his conduct towards me.\r\n\r\nInclosed you have a translation of an arzee from the Killidar of\r\nVellore. _I have thousands of the same kind_; but this, just now\r\nreceived, will serve to give you some idea of the miseries brought upon\r\nthis my devoted country, and the wretched inhabitants that remain in it,\r\nby the oppressive hand of Lord Macartney's management: nor will the\r\n_embezzlements of collections_ thus obtained, when brought before you in\r\n_proof_, appear less extraordinary,--which _shall certainly be done in\r\ndue time_.\r\n\r\n     _Translation of an Arzee, in the Persian Language, from\r\n     Uzzim-ul-Doen Cawn, the Killidar of Vellore, to the Nabob_, dated\r\n     1st September, 1783. Inclosed in the Nabob's Letter to the Court of\r\n     Directors, September, 1783.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly represented to your Highness the violences and\r\noppressions exercised by the present aumildar [collector of revenue], of\r\nLord Macartney's appointment, over the few remaining inhabitants of the\r\ndistricts of Vellore, Amboor, Saulguda, &c.\r\n\r\nThe outrages and violences now committed are of that astonishing nature\r\nas were never known or heard of during the administration of the Circar.\r\nHyder Naik, the cruellest of tyrants, used every kind of oppression in\r\nthe Circar countries; but even his measures were not like those now\r\npursued. Such of the inhabitants as had escaped the sword and pillage of\r\nHyder Naik, by taking refuge in the woods, and within the walls of\r\nVellore, &c., on the arrival of Lord Macartney's aumildar to Vellore,\r\nand in consequence of his cowle of protection and support, most\r\ncheerfully returned to the villages, set about the cultivation of the\r\nlands, and with great pains rebuilt their cottages.--But now the\r\naumildar has imprisoned the wives and children of the inhabitants,\r\nseized the few jewels that were on the bodies of the women, and then,\r\nbefore the faces of their husbands, flogged them, in order to make them\r\nproduce other jewels and effects, which he said they had buried\r\nsomewhere under ground, and to make the inhabitants bring him money,\r\nnotwithstanding there was yet no cultivation in the country. Terrified\r\nwith the flagellations, some of them produced their jewels and\r\nwearing-apparel of their women, to the amount of ten or fifteen pagodas,\r\nwhich they had hidden; others, who declared they had none, the aumildar\r\nflogged their women severely, tied cords around their breasts, and tore\r\nthe sucking children from their teats, and exposed them to the scorching\r\nheat of the sun. Those children died, as did the wife of Ramsoamy, an\r\ninhabitant of Bringpoor. Even this could not stir up compassion in the\r\nbreast of the aumildar. Some of the children that were somewhat large he\r\nexposed to sale. In short, the violences of the aumildar are so\r\nastonishing, that the people, on seeing the present situation, remember\r\nthe loss of Hyder with regret. With whomsoever the aumildar finds a\r\nsingle measure of natchinee or rice, he takes it away from him, and\r\nappropriates it to the expenses of the sibindy that he keeps up. No\r\nrevenues are collected from the countries, but from the effects of the\r\npoor, wretched inhabitants. Those ryots [yeomen] who intended to return\r\nto their habitations, hearing of those violences, have fled for refuge,\r\nwith their wives and children, into Hyder's country. Every day is\r\nushered in and closed with these violences and disturbances. I have no\r\npower to do anything; and who will hear what I have to say? My business\r\nis to inform your Highness, who are my master. The people bring their\r\ncomplaints to me, and I tell them I will write to your Highness.[74]\r\n\r\n     _Translation of a Tellinga Letter from Veira Permaul, Head Dubash\r\n     to Lord Macartney, in his own Handwriting, to Rajah Ramchunda, the\r\n     Renter of Ongole._ Dated 25th of the Hindoo month Mausay, in the\r\n     year Plavanamal, corresponding to 5th March, 1782.\r\n\r\nI present my respects to you, and am very well here, wishing to hear\r\nfrequently of your welfare.\r\n\r\nYour peasher Vancatroyloo has brought the Visseel Bakees, and delivered\r\nthem to me, as _also what you sent him for me to deliver to my master,\r\nwhich I have done. My master at first refused to take it, because he is\r\nunacquainted with your disposition_, or what kind of a person you are.\r\nBut after I made encomiums on your goodness and greatness of mind, and\r\ntook my oath to the same, and that _it would not become public_, but be\r\nheld as precious as our lives, _my master accepted it_. You may remain\r\nsatisfied that I will get the Ongole business settled in your name; I\r\nwill cause the jamaubundee to be settled agreeable to your desire. It\r\nwas formerly the Nabob's intention to give this business to you, as the\r\nGovernor knows full well, but did not at that time agree to it, which\r\nyou must be well acquainted with.\r\n\r\nYour peasher Vancatroyloo is a very careful, good man; he is well\r\nexperienced in business; _he has bound me by an oath to keep all this\r\nbusiness secret, and that his own, yours, and my lives are responsible\r\nfor it_. I write this letter to you with the greatest reluctance, and I\r\nsignified the same to your peasher, and declared that I would not write\r\nto you by any means. To this the peasher urged, that, _if I did not\r\nwrite to his master, how could he know to whom he (the peasher)\r\ndelivered the money_, and what must his master think of it? Therefore I\r\nwrite you this letter, and send it by my servant Ramanah, accompanied by\r\nthe peasher's servant, and it will come safe to your hands. After\r\nperusal, you will send it back to me immediately: until I receive it, I\r\ndon't like to eat my victuals or take any sleep. Your peasher took his\r\noath, and urged me to write this for your satisfaction, and has engaged\r\nto me that I shall have this letter returned to me in the space of\r\ntwelve days.\r\n\r\nThe present Governor is not like the former Governors: he is a very\r\ngreat man in Europe; and all the great men of Europe are much obliged,\r\nto him for his condescension in accepting the government of this place.\r\nIt is his custom, when he makes friendship with any one, to continue it\r\nalways; and if _he is at enmity with any one, he never will desist till\r\nhe has worked his destruction. He is now exceedingly displeased with\r\nthe Nabob, and you will understand by-and-by that the Nabob's business\r\ncannot be carried on_; he (the Nabob) will have no power to do anything\r\nin his own affairs: _you have, therefore, no room to fear him_; you may\r\nremain with a contented mind. I desired the Governor to write you a\r\nletter for your satisfaction: the Governor said he would do so, when the\r\nbusiness was settled. This letter you must peruse as soon as possible,\r\nand send it back with all speed by the bearer, Ramadoo, accompanied by\r\nthree or four of your people, to the end that no accident may happen on\r\nthe road. These people must be ordered to march in the night only, and\r\nto arrive here with the greatest dispatch. You sent ten mangoes for my\r\nmaster and two for me, all of which I have delivered to my master,\r\nthinking that ten was not sufficient to present him with. I write this\r\nfor your information, and salute you with ten thousand respects.\r\n\r\n     I, Muttu Kistnah, of Madras Patnam, dubash, declare that I\r\n     perfectly understand the Gentoo language, and do most solemnly\r\n     affirm that the foregoing is a true translation of the annexed\r\n     paper writing from the Gentoo language.\r\n\r\n     (Signed)\r\n\r\n     Muttu Kistnah.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] In this statement, the Ongole country, though it is included under\r\nthe head of gross revenue, has been let for a certain sum, exclusive of\r\ncharges. If the expenses specified in the Nabob's vassool accounts for\r\nthis district are added, the present gross revenue even would appear to\r\nexceed the Nabob's; and as the country is only let for one year, there\r\nmay hereafter be an increase of its revenue.\r\n\r\n[69] The Trichinopoly countries let for the above sum, exclusive of the\r\nexpenses of sibbendy and saderwared, amounting, by the Nabob's accounts,\r\nto rupees 1,30,00 per annum, which are to be defrayed by the renter. And\r\nthe jaghires of Amir-ul-Omrah and the Begum are not included in the\r\npresent lease.\r\n\r\n[70] For the ground of this \"great reliance,\" see the papers in this\r\nAppendix, No. 5; as also the Nabob's letters to the Court of Directors\r\nin this Appendix, No. 10.\r\n\r\n[71] For the full proof of this necessity, Lord Macartney's whole\r\ncorrespondence on the subject may be referred to. Without the act here\r\ncondemned, not one of the acts commended in the preceding paragraph\r\ncould be performed. By referring to the Nabob's letters in this Appendix\r\nit will be seen what sort of task a governor has on his hands, who is to\r\nuse, according to the direction of this letter, \"acts of address,\r\ncivility, and conciliation,\" and to pay, upon _all_ occasions, _the\r\nhighest attention_, to persons who at the very time are falsely, and in\r\nthe grossest terms, accusing him of peculation, corruption, treason, and\r\nevery species of malversation in office. The recommendation, under\r\nmenaces of such behavior, and under such circumstances, conveys a lesson\r\nthe tendency of which cannot be misunderstood.\r\n\r\n[72] The delicacy here recommended, in the _expressions_ concerning\r\nconduct \"with which the safety of our settlements is essentially\r\nconnected,\" is a lesson of the same nature with the former. Dangerous\r\ndesigns, if truly such, ought to be expressed according to their nature\r\nand qualities. And as for the _secrecy_ recommended concerning the\r\ndesigns here alluded to, nothing can be more absurd; as they appear very\r\nfully and directly in the papers published by the authority of the Court\r\nof Directors in 1775, and may be easily discerned from the propositions\r\nfor the Bengal treaty, published in the Reports of the Committee of\r\nSecrecy, and in the Reports of the Select Committee. The keeping of such\r\nsecrets too long has been one cause of the Carnatic war, and of the ruin\r\nof our affairs in India.\r\n\r\n[73] See Tellinga letter, at the end of this correspondence.\r\n\r\n[74] The above-recited practices, or practices similar to them, have\r\nprevailed in almost every part of the miserable countries on the coast\r\nof Coromandel for near twenty years past. That they prevailed as\r\nstrongly and generally as they could prevail, under the administration\r\nof the Nabob, there can be no question, notwithstanding the assertion in\r\nthe beginning of the above petition; nor will it ever be otherwise,\r\nwhilst affairs are conducted upon the principles which influence the\r\npresent system. Whether the particulars here asserted are true or false\r\nneither the Court of Directors nor their ministry have thought proper to\r\ninquire. If they are true, in order to bring them to affect Lord\r\nMacartney, it ought to be proved that the complaint was made _to him,\r\nand that he had refused redress_. Instead of this fair course, the\r\ncomplaint is carried to the Court of Directors.--The above is one of the\r\ndocuments transmitted by the Nabob, in proof of his charge of corruption\r\nagainst Lord Macartney. If genuine, it is conclusive, at least against\r\nLord Macartney's principal agent and manager. If it be a forgery, (as in\r\nall likelihood it is,) it is conclusive against the Nabob and his evil\r\ncounsellors, and folly demonstrates, if anything further were necessary\r\nto demonstrate, the necessity of the clause in Mr. Fox's bill\r\nprohibiting the residence of the native princes in the Company's\r\nprincipal settlements,--which clause was, for obvious reasons, not\r\nadmitted into Mr. Pitt's. It shows, too, the absolute necessity of a\r\nsevere and exemplary punishment on certain of his English evil\r\ncounsellors and creditors, by whom such practices are carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCE OF THE SPEECH\r\n\r\nIN THE\r\n\r\nDEBATE ON THE ARMY ESTIMATES\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,\r\n\r\nON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1790\r\n\r\nCOMPREHENDING\r\n\r\nA DISCUSSION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke's speech on the report of the army estimates has not been\r\ncorrectly stated in some of the public papers. It is of consequence to\r\nhim not to be misunderstood. The matter which incidentally came into\r\ndiscussion is of the most serious importance. It is thought that the\r\nheads and substance of the speech will answer the purpose sufficiently.\r\nIf, in making the abstract, through defect of memory in the person who\r\nnow gives it, any difference at all should be perceived from the speech\r\nas it was spoken, it will not, the editor imagines, be found in anything\r\nwhich may amount to a retraction of the opinions he then maintained, or\r\nto any softening in the expressions in which they were conveyed.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke spoke a considerable time in answer to various arguments,\r\nwhich had been insisted upon by Mr. Grenville and Mr. Pitt, for keeping\r\nan increased peace establishment, and against an improper jealousy of\r\nthe ministers, in whom a full confidence, subject to responsibility,\r\nought to be placed, on account of their knowledge of the real situation\r\nof affairs, the exact state of which it frequently happened that they\r\ncould not disclose without violating the constitutional and political\r\nsecrecy necessary to the well-being of their country.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said in substance, That confidence might become a vice, and\r\njealousy a virtue, according to circumstances. That confidence, of all\r\npublic virtues, was the most dangerous, and jealousy in an House of\r\nCommons, of all public vices, the most tolerable,--- especially where\r\nthe number and the charge of standing armies in time of peace was the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThat in the annual Mutiny Bill the annual army was declared to be for\r\nthe purpose of preserving the balance of power in Europe. The propriety\r\nof its being larger or smaller depended, therefore, upon the true state\r\nof that balance. If the increase of peace establishments demanded of\r\nParliament agreed with the manifest appearance of the balance,\r\nconfidence in ministers as to the particulars would be very proper. If\r\nthe increase was not at all supported by any such appearance, he thought\r\ngreat jealousy might be, and ought to be, entertained on that subject.\r\n\r\nThat he did not find, on a review of all Europe, that, politically, we\r\nstood in the smallest degree of danger from any one state or kingdom it\r\ncontained, nor that any other foreign powers than our own allies were\r\nlikely to obtain a considerable preponderance in the scale.\r\n\r\nThat France had hitherto been our first object in all considerations\r\nconcerning the balance of power. The presence or absence of France\r\ntotally varied every sort of speculation relative to that balance.\r\n\r\nThat France is at this time, in a political light, to be considered as\r\nexpunged out of the system of Europe. Whether she could ever appear in\r\nit again, as a leading power, was not easy to determine; but at present\r\nbe considered France as not politically existing; and most assuredly it\r\nwould take up much time to restore her to her former active existence:\r\n_Gallos quoque in bellis floruisse audivimus_ might possibly be the\r\nlanguage of the rising generation. He did not mean to deny that it was\r\nour duty to keep our eye on that nation, and to regulate our preparation\r\nby the symptoms of her recovery.\r\n\r\nThat it was to her _strength_, not to her _form of government_, which we\r\nwere to attend; because republics, as well as monarchies, were\r\nsusceptible of ambition, jealousy, and anger, the usual causes of war.\r\n\r\nBut if, while France continued in this swoon, we should go on increasing\r\nour expenses, we should certainly make ourselves less a match for her\r\nwhen it became our concern to arm.\r\n\r\nIt was said, that, as she had speedily fallen, she might speedily rise\r\nagain. He doubted this. That the fall from an height was with an\r\naccelerated velocity; but to lift a weight up to that height again was\r\ndifficult, and opposed by the laws of physical and political\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nIn a political view, France was low indeed. She had lost everything,\r\neven to her name.\r\n\r\n        Jacet ingens littore truncus,\r\n    Avolsumque humeris _caput_, et sine _nomine_ corpus.[75]\r\n\r\nHe was astonished at it; he was alarmed at it; he trembled at the\r\nuncertainty of all human greatness.\r\n\r\nSince the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in\r\nFrance. The French had shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin\r\nthat had hitherto existed in the world. In that very short space of time\r\nthey had completely pulled down to the ground their monarchy, their\r\nchurch, their nobility, their law, their revenue, their army, their\r\nnavy, their commerce, their arts, and their manufactures. They had done\r\ntheir business for us as rivals in a way in which twenty Ramillies or\r\nBlenheims could never have done it. Were we absolute conquerors, and\r\nFrance to lie prostrate at our feet, we should be ashamed to send a\r\ncommission to settle their affairs which could impose so hard a law upon\r\nthe French, and so destructive of all their consequence as a nation, as\r\nthat they had imposed upon themselves.\r\n\r\nFrance, by the mere circumstance of its vicinity, had been, and in a\r\ndegree always must be, an object of our vigilance, either with regard to\r\nher actual power or to her influence and example. As to the former he\r\nhad spoken; as to the latter (her example) he should say a few words:\r\nfor by this example our friendship and our intercourse with that nation\r\nhad once been, and might again become, more dangerous to us than their\r\nworst hostility.\r\n\r\nIn the last century, Louis the Fourteenth had established a greater and\r\nbetter disciplined military force than ever had been before seen in\r\nEurope, and with it a perfect despotism. Though that despotism was\r\nproudly arrayed in manners, gallantry, splendor, magnificence, and even\r\ncovered over with the imposing robes of science, literature, and arts,\r\nit was, in government, nothing better than a painted and gilded\r\ntyranny,--in religion, a hard, stern intolerance, the fit companion and\r\nauxiliary to the despotic tyranny which prevailed in its government. The\r\nsame character of despotism insinuated itself into every court of\r\nEurope,--the same spirit of disproportioned magnificence,--the same love\r\nof standing armies, above the ability of the people. In particular, our\r\nthen sovereigns, King Charles and King James, fell in love with the\r\ngovernment of their neighbor, so flattering to the pride of kings. A\r\nsimilarity of sentiments brought on connections equally dangerous to the\r\ninterests and liberties of their country. It were well that the\r\ninfection had gone no farther than the throne. The admiration of a\r\ngovernment flourishing and successful, unchecked in its operations, and\r\nseeming, therefore, to compass its objects more speedily and\r\neffectually, gained something upon all ranks of people. The good\r\npatriots of that day, however, struggled against it. They sought nothing\r\nmore anxiously than to break off all communication with France, and to\r\nbeget a total alienation from its councils and its example,--which, by\r\nthe animosity prevalent between the abettors of their religious system\r\nand the assertors of ours, was in some degree effected.\r\n\r\nThis day the evil is totally changed in France: but there is an evil\r\nthere. The disease is altered; but the vicinity of the two countries\r\nremains, and must remain; and the natural mental habits of mankind are\r\nsuch, that the present distemper of France is far more likely to be\r\ncontagious than the old one: for it is not quite easy to spread a\r\npassion for servitude among the people; but in all evils of the opposite\r\nkind our natural inclinations are flattered. In the case of despotism,\r\nthere is the _fœdum crimen servitutis_: in the last, the _falsa SPECIES\r\nlibertatis_; and accordingly, as the historian says, _pronis auribus\r\naccipitur_.\r\n\r\nIn the last age we were in danger of being entangled by the example of\r\nFrance in the net of a relentless despotism. It is not necessary to say\r\nanything upon that example. It exists no longer. Our present danger from\r\nthe example of a people whose character knows no medium is, with regard\r\nto government, a danger from anarchy: a danger of being led, through an\r\nadmiration of successful fraud and violence, to an imitation of the\r\nexcesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating,\r\nplundering, ferocious, bloody, and tyrannical democracy. On the side of\r\nreligion, the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but\r\nfrom atheism: a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and\r\nconsolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have\r\nbeen embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed.\r\n\r\nThese are our present dangers from France. But, in his opinion, the very\r\nworst part of the example set is in the late assumption of citizenship\r\nby the army, and the whole of the arrangement, or rather disarrangement,\r\nof their military.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry that his right honorable friend (Mr. Fox) had dropped even\r\na word expressive of exultation on that circumstance, or that he seemed\r\nof opinion that the objection from standing armies was at all lessened\r\nby it. He attributed this opinion of Mr. Fox entirely to his known zeal\r\nfor the best of all causes, liberty. That it was with a pain\r\ninexpressible he was obliged to have even the shadow of a difference\r\nwith his friend, whose authority would always be great with him, and\r\nwith all thinking people,--_Quæ maxima semper censetur nobis, et_ ERIT\r\n_quæ maxima semper_;--his confidence in Mr. Fox was such, and so ample,\r\nas to be almost implicit. That he was not ashamed to avow that degree of\r\ndocility. That, when the choice is well made, it strengthens, instead of\r\noppressing our intellect. That he who calls in the aid of an equal\r\nunderstanding doubles his own. He who profits of a superior\r\nunderstanding raises his powers to a level with the height of the\r\nsuperior understanding he unites with. He had found the benefit of such\r\na junction, and would not lightly depart from it. He wished almost, on\r\nall occasions, that his sentiments were understood to be conveyed in Mr.\r\nFox's words. And that he wished, as amongst the greatest benefits he\r\ncould wish the country, an eminent share of power to that right\r\nhonorable gentleman; because he knew that to his great and masterly\r\nunderstanding he had joined the greatest possible degree of that natural\r\nmoderation which is the best corrective of power: that he was of the\r\nmost artless, candid, open, and benevolent disposition; disinterested in\r\nthe extreme; of a temper mild and placable even to a fault; without one\r\ndrop of gall in his whole constitution.\r\n\r\nThat the House must perceive, from his coming forward to mark an\r\nexpression or two of his best friend, how anxious he was to keep the\r\ndistemper of France from the least countenance in England, where he was\r\nsure some wicked persons had shown a strong disposition to recommend an\r\nimitation of the French spirit of reform. He was so strongly opposed to\r\nany the least tendency towards the _means_ of introducing a democracy\r\nlike theirs, as well as to the _end_ itself, that, much as it would\r\nafflict him, if such a thing could be attempted, and that any friend of\r\nhis could concur in such measures, (he was far, very far, from believing\r\nthey could,) he would abandon his best friends, and join with his worst\r\nenemies, to oppose either the means or the end,--and to resist all\r\nviolent exertions of the spirit of innovation, so distant from all\r\nprinciples of true and safe reformation: a spirit well calculated to\r\noverturn states, but perfectly unfit to amend them.\r\n\r\nThat he was no enemy to reformation. Almost every business in which he\r\nwas much concerned, from the first day he sat in that House to that\r\nhour, was a business of reformation; and when he had not been employed\r\nin correcting, he had been employed in resisting abuses. Some traces of\r\nthis spirit in him now stand on their statute-book. In his opinion,\r\nanything which unnecessarily tore to pieces the contexture of the state\r\nnot only prevented all real reformation, but introduced evils which\r\nwould call, but perhaps call in vain, for new reformation.\r\n\r\nThat he thought the French nation very unwise. What they valued\r\nthemselves on was a disgrace to them. They had gloried (and some people\r\nin England had thought fit to take share in that glory) in making a\r\nRevolution, as if revolutions were good things in themselves. All the\r\nhorrors and all the crimes of the anarchy which led to their Revolution,\r\nwhich attend its progress, and which may virtually attend it in its\r\nestablishment, pass for nothing with the lovers of revolutions. The\r\nFrench have made their way, through the destruction of their country, to\r\na bad constitution, when they were absolutely in possession of a good\r\none. They were in possession of it the day the states met in separate\r\norders. Their business, had they been either virtuous or wise, or had\r\nbeen left to their own judgment, was to secure the stability and\r\nindependence of the states, according to those orders, under the monarch\r\non the throne. It was then their duty to redress grievances.\r\n\r\nInstead of redressing grievances, and improving the fabric of their\r\nstate, to which they were called by their monarch and sent by their\r\ncountry, they were made to take a very different course. They first\r\ndestroyed all the balances and counterpoises which serve to fix the\r\nstate and to give it a steady direction, and which furnish sure\r\ncorrectives to any violent spirit which may prevail in any of the\r\norders. These balances existed in their oldest constitution, and in the\r\nconstitution of this country, and in the constitution of all the\r\ncountries in Europe. These they rashly destroyed, and then they melted\r\ndown the whole into one incongruous, ill-connected mass.\r\n\r\nWhen they had done this, they instantly, and with the most atrocious\r\nperfidy and breach of all faith among men, laid the axe to the root of\r\nall property, and consequently of all national prosperity, by the\r\nprinciples they established and the example they set, in confiscating\r\nall the possessions of the Church. They made and recorded a sort of\r\n_institute_ and _digest_ of anarchy, called the Rights of Man, in such a\r\npedantic abuse of elementary principles as would have disgraced boys at\r\nschool: but this declaration of rights was worse than trifling and\r\npedantic in them; as by their name and authority they systematically\r\ndestroyed every hold of authority by opinion, religious or civil, on the\r\nminds of the people. By this mad declaration they subverted the state,\r\nand brought on such calamities as no country, without a long war, has\r\never been known to suffer, and which may in the end produce such a war,\r\nand perhaps many such.\r\n\r\nWith them the question was not between despotism and liberty. The\r\nsacrifice they made of the peace and power of their country was not made\r\non the altar of freedom. Freedom, and a better security for freedom than\r\nthat they have taken, they might have had without any sacrifice at all.\r\nThey brought themselves into all the calamities they suffer, not that\r\nthrough them they might obtain a British constitution; they plunged\r\nthemselves headlong into those calamities to prevent themselves from\r\nsettling into that constitution, or into anything resembling it.\r\n\r\nThat, if they should perfectly succeed in what they propose, as they are\r\nlikely enough to do, and establish a democracy, or a mob of democracies,\r\nin a country circumstanced like France, they will establish a very bad\r\ngovernment,--a very bad species of tyranny.\r\n\r\nThat the worst effect of all their proceeding was on their military,\r\nwhich was rendered an army for every purpose but that of defence. That,\r\nif the question was, whether soldiers were to forget they were citizens,\r\nas an abstract proposition, he could have no difference about it;\r\nthough, as it is usual, when abstract principles are to be applied, much\r\nwas to be thought on the manner of uniting the character of citizen and\r\nsoldier. But as applied to the events which had happened in France,\r\nwhere the abstract principle was clothed with its circumstances, he\r\nthought that his friend would agree with him, that what was done there\r\nfurnished no matter of exultation, either in the act or the example.\r\nThese soldiers were not citizens, but base, hireling mutineers, and\r\nmercenary, sordid deserters, wholly destitute of any honorable\r\nprinciple. Their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic spirit\r\nfrom the evils of which a democracy itself was to be resorted to, by\r\nthose who were the least disposed to that form, as a sort of refuge. It\r\nwas not an army in corps and with discipline, and embodied under the\r\nrespectable patriot citizens of the state in resisting tyranny. Nothing\r\nlike it. It was the case of common soldiers deserting from their\r\nofficers, to join a furious, licentious populace. It was a desertion to\r\na cause the real object of which was to level all those institutions,\r\nand to break all those connections, natural and civil, that regulate and\r\nhold together the community by a chain of subordination: to raise\r\nsoldiers against their officers, servants against their masters,\r\ntradesmen against their customers, artificers against their employers,\r\ntenants against their landlords, curates against their bishops, and\r\nchildren against their parents. That this cause of theirs was not an\r\nenemy to servitude, but to society.\r\n\r\nHe wished the House to consider how the members would like to have their\r\nmansions pulled down and pillaged, their persons abused, insulted, and\r\ndestroyed, their title-deeds brought out and burned before their faces,\r\nand themselves and their families driven to seek refuge in every nation\r\nthroughout Europe, for no other reason than this, that, without any\r\nfault of theirs, they were born gentlemen and men of property, and were\r\nsuspected of a desire to preserve their consideration and their estates.\r\nThe desertion in France was to aid an abominable sedition, the very\r\nprofessed principle of which was an implacable hostility to nobility and\r\ngentry, and whose savage war-whoop was, _\"A l'Aristocrate!\"_--by which\r\nsenseless, bloody cry they animated one another to rapine and murder;\r\nwhilst abetted by ambitious men of another class, they were crushing\r\neverything respectable and virtuous in their nation, and to their power\r\ndisgracing almost every name by which we formerly knew there was such a\r\ncountry in the world as France.\r\n\r\nHe knew too well, and he felt as much as any man, how difficult it was\r\nto accommodate a standing army to a free constitution, or to any\r\nconstitution. An armed disciplined body is, in its essence, dangerous to\r\nliberty; undisciplined, it is ruinous to society. Its component parts\r\nare in the latter case neither good citizens nor good soldiers. What\r\nhave they thought of in France, under such a difficulty as almost puts\r\nthe human faculties to a stand? They have put their army under such a\r\nvariety of principles of duty, that it is more likely to breed\r\nlitigants, pettifoggers, and mutineers than soldiers.[76] They have set\r\nup, to balance their crown army, another army, deriving under another\r\nauthority, called a municipal army,--a balance of armies, not of orders.\r\nThese latter they have destroyed with every mark of insult and\r\noppression. States may, and they will best, exist with a partition of\r\ncivil powers. Armies cannot exist under a divided command. This state of\r\nthings he thought in effect a state of war, or at best but a truce,\r\ninstead of peace, in the country.\r\n\r\nWhat a dreadful thing is a standing army for the conduct of the whole or\r\nany part of which no man is responsible! In the present state of the\r\nFrench crown army, is the crown responsible for the whole of it? Is\r\nthere any general who can be responsible for the obedience of a\r\nbrigade, any colonel for that of a regiment, any captain for that of a\r\ncompany? And as to the municipal army, reinforced as it is by the new\r\ncitizen deserters, under whose command are they? Have we not seen them,\r\nnot led by, but dragging, their nominal commander, with a rope about his\r\nneck, when they, or those whom they accompanied, proceeded to the most\r\natrocious acts of treason and murder? Are any of these armies? Are any\r\nof these citizens?\r\n\r\nWe have in such a difficulty as that of fitting a standing army to the\r\nstate, he conceived, done much better. We have not distracted our army\r\nby divided principles of obedience. We have put them under a single\r\nauthority, with a simple (our common) oath of fidelity; and we keep the\r\nwhole under our annual inspection. This was doing all that could be\r\nsafely done.\r\n\r\nHe felt some concern that this strange thing called a Revolution in\r\nFrance should be compared with the glorious event commonly called the\r\nRevolution in England, and the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion\r\ncompared with the behavior of some of the troops of France in the\r\npresent instance. At that period, the Prince of Orange, a prince of the\r\nblood-royal in England, was called in by the flower of the English\r\naristocracy to defend its ancient Constitution, and not to level all\r\ndistinctions. To this prince, so invited, the aristocratic leaders who\r\ncommanded the troops went over with their several corps, in bodies, to\r\nthe deliverer of their country. Aristocratic leaders brought up the\r\ncorps of citizens who newly enlisted in this cause. Military obedience\r\nchanged its object; but military discipline was not for a moment\r\ninterrupted in its principle. The troops were ready for war, but\r\nindisposed to mutiny.\r\n\r\nBut as the conduct of the English armies was different, so was that of\r\nthe whole English nation at that time. In truth, the circumstances of\r\nour Revolution (as it is called) and that of France are just the reverse\r\nof each other in almost every particular, and in the whole spirit of the\r\ntransaction. With us it was the case of a legal monarch attempting\r\narbitrary power; in France it is the case of an arbitrary monarch\r\nbeginning, from whatever cause, to legalize his authority. The one was\r\nto be resisted, the other was to be managed and directed; but in neither\r\ncase was the order of the state to be changed, lest government might be\r\nruined, which ought only to be corrected and legalized. With us we got\r\nrid of the man, and preserved the constituent parts of the state. There\r\nthey get rid of the constituent parts of the state, and keep the man.\r\nWhat we did was in truth and substance, and in a constitutional light, a\r\nrevolution, not made, but prevented. We took solid securities; we\r\nsettled doubtful questions; we corrected anomalies in our law. In the\r\nstable, fundamental parts of our Constitution we made no\r\nrevolution,--no, nor any alteration at all. We did not impair the\r\nmonarchy. Perhaps it might be shown that we strengthened it very\r\nconsiderably. The nation kept the same ranks, the same orders, the same\r\nprivileges, the same franchises, the same rules for property, the same\r\nsubordinations, the same order in the law, in the revenue, and in the\r\nmagistracy,--the same lords, the same commons, the same corporations,\r\nthe same electors.\r\n\r\nThe Church was not impaired. Her estates, her majesty, her splendor, her\r\norders and gradations, continued the same. She was preserved in her\r\nfull efficiency, and cleared only of a certain intolerance, which was\r\nher weakness and disgrace. The Church and the State were the same after\r\nthe Revolution that they were before, but better secured in every part.\r\n\r\nWas little done because a revolution was not made in the Constitution?\r\nNo! Everything was done; because we commenced with reparation, not with\r\nruin. Accordingly, the state flourished. Instead of lying as dead, in a\r\nsort of trance, or exposed, as some others, in an epileptic fit, to the\r\npity or derision of the world, for her wild, ridiculous, convulsive\r\nmovements, impotent to every purpose but that of dashing out her brains\r\nagainst the pavement, Great Britain rose above the standard even of her\r\nformer self. An era of a more improved domestic prosperity then\r\ncommenced, and still continues, not only unimpaired, but growing, under\r\nthe wasting hand of time. All the energies of the country were awakened.\r\nEngland never preserved a firmer countenance or a more vigorous arm to\r\nall her enemies and to all her rivals. Europe under her respired and\r\nrevived. Everywhere she appeared as the protector, assertor, or avenger\r\nof liberty. A war was made and supported against fortune itself. The\r\ntreaty of Ryswick, which first limited the power of France, was soon\r\nafter made; the grand alliance very shortly followed, which shook to the\r\nfoundations the dreadful power which menaced the independence of\r\nmankind. The states of Europe lay happy under the shade of a great and\r\nfree monarchy, which knew how to be great without endangering its own\r\npeace at home or the internal or external peace of any of its\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said he should have felt very unpleasantly, if he had not\r\ndelivered these sentiments. He was near the end of his natural, probably\r\nstill nearer the end of his political career. That he was weak and\r\nweary, and wished for rest. That he was little disposed to\r\ncontroversies, or what is called a detailed opposition. That at his time\r\nof life, if he could not do something by some sort of weight of opinion,\r\nnatural or acquired, it was useless and indecorous to attempt anything\r\nby mere struggle. _Turpe senex miles_. That he had for that reason\r\nlittle attended the army business, or that of the revenue, or almost any\r\nother matter of detail, for some years past. That he had, however, his\r\ntask. He was far from condemning such opposition; on the contrary, he\r\nmost highly applauded it, where a just occasion existed for it, and\r\ngentlemen had vigor and capacity to pursue it. Where a great occasion\r\noccurred, he was, and, while he continued in Parliament, would be,\r\namongst the most active and the most earnest,--as he hoped he had shown\r\non a late event. With respect to the Constitution itself, he wished few\r\nalterations in it,--happy if he left it not the worse for any share he\r\nhad taken in its service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Fox then rose, and declared, in substance, that, so far as regarded\r\nthe French army, he went no farther than the general principle, by which\r\nthat army showed itself indisposed to be an instrument in the servitude\r\nof their fellow-citizens, but did not enter into the particulars of\r\ntheir conduct. He declared that he did not affect a democracy: that he\r\nalways thought any of the simple, unbalanced governments bad: simple\r\nmonarchy, simple aristocracy, simple democracy,--he held them all\r\nimperfect or vicious; all were bad by themselves; the composition alone\r\nwas good. That these had been always his principles, in which he had\r\nagreed with his friend Mr. Burke,--of whom he had said many kind and\r\nflattering things, which Mr. Burke, I take it for granted, will know\r\nhimself too well to think he merits from anything but Mr. Fox's\r\nacknowledged good-nature. Mr. Fox thought, however, that, in many cases,\r\nMr. Burke was rather carried too far by his hatred to innovation.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said, he well knew that these had been Mr. Fox's invariable\r\nopinions; that they were a sure ground for the confidence of his\r\ncountry. But he had been fearful that cabals of very different\r\nintentions would be ready to make use of his great name, against his\r\ncharacter and sentiments, in order to derive a credit to their\r\ndestructive machinations.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheridan then rose, and made a lively and eloquent speech against\r\nMr. Burke; in which, among other things, he said that Mr. Burke had\r\nlibelled the National Assembly of France, and had cast out reflections\r\non such characters as those of the Marquis de La Fayette and Mr. Bailly.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke said, that he did not libel the National Assembly of France,\r\nwhom he considered very little in the discussion of these matters. That\r\nhe thought all the substantial power resided in the republic of Paris,\r\nwhose authority guided, or whose example was followed by, all the\r\nrepublics of France. The republic of Paris had an army under their\r\norders, and not under those of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nN.B. As to the particular gentlemen, I do not remember that Mr. Burke\r\nmentioned either of them,--certainly not Mr. Bailly. He alluded,\r\nundoubtedly, to the case of the Marquis de La Fayette; but whether what\r\nhe asserted of him be a libel on him must be left to those who are\r\nacquainted with the business.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt concluded the debate with becoming gravity and dignity, and a\r\nreserve on both sides of the question, as related to France, fit for a\r\nperson in a ministerial situation. He said, that what he had spoken only\r\nregarded France when she should unite, which he rather thought she soon\r\nmight, with the liberty she had acquired, the blessings of law and\r\norder. He, too, said several civil things concerning the sentiments of\r\nMr. Burke, as applied to this country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] Mr. Burke probably had in his mind the remainder of the passage,\r\nand was filled with some congenial apprehensions:--\r\n\r\n    Hæc finis Priami fatorum; hic exitus illum\r\n    Sorte tulit, Trojam incensam et prolapsa videntem\r\n    Pergama, tot quondam populis terrisque superbum\r\n    Regnatorem Asiæ. Jacet ingens littore truncus,\r\n    Avolsumque humeris caput, et sine nomine corpus.\r\n    _At me_ tum primum sævus circumstetit horror.\r\n    Obstupui: _subiit chari genitoris imago_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[76] They are Sworn to obey the king, the nation, and the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE,\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEEDINGS IN CERTAIN SOCIETIES IN\r\n\r\nLONDON RELATIVE TO THAT EVENT:\r\n\r\nIN A LETTER\r\n\r\nINTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO A GENTLEMAN IN PARIS.\r\n\r\n1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be unnecessary to inform the reader that the following\r\nReflections had their origin in a correspondence between the author and\r\na very young gentleman at Paris, who did him the honor of desiring his\r\nopinion upon the important transactions which then, and ever since have,\r\nso much occupied the attention of all men. An answer was written some\r\ntime in the month of October, 1789; but it was kept back upon prudential\r\nconsiderations. That letter is alluded to in the beginning of the\r\nfollowing sheets. It has been since forwarded to the person to whom it\r\nwas addressed. The reasons for the delay in sending it were assigned in\r\na short letter to the same gentleman. This produced on his part a new\r\nand pressing application for the author's sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe author began a second and more full discussion on the subject. This\r\nhe had some thoughts of publishing early in the last spring; but the\r\nmatter gaining upon him, he found that what he had undertaken not only\r\nfar exceeded the measure of a letter, but that its importance required\r\nrather a more detailed consideration than at that time he had any\r\nleisure to bestow upon it. However, having thrown down his first\r\nthoughts in the form of a letter, and, indeed, when he sat down to\r\nwrite, having intended it for a private letter, he found it difficult to\r\nchange the form of address, when his sentiments had grown into a greater\r\nextent and had received another direction. A different plan, he is\r\nsensible, might be more favorable to a commodious division and\r\ndistribution of his matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for\r\nmy thoughts on the late proceedings in France. I will not give you\r\nreason to imagine that I think my sentiments of such value as to wish\r\nmyself to be solicited about them. They are of too little consequence to\r\nbe very anxiously either communicated or withheld. It was from attention\r\nto you, and to you only, that I hesitated at the time when you first\r\ndesired to receive them. In the first letter I had the honor to write to\r\nyou, and which at length I send, I wrote neither for nor from any\r\ndescription of men; nor shall I in this. My errors, if any, are my own.\r\nMy reputation alone is to answer for them.\r\n\r\nYou see, Sir, by the long letter I have transmitted to you, that, though\r\nI do most heartily wish that France may be animated by a spirit of\r\nrational liberty, and that I think you bound, in all honest policy, to\r\nprovide a permanent body in which that spirit may reside, and an\r\neffectual organ by which it may act, it is my misfortune to entertain\r\ngreat doubts concerning several material points in your late\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nYou imagined, when you wrote last, that I might possibly be reckoned\r\namong the approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the solemn\r\npublic seal of sanction they have received from two clubs of gentlemen\r\nin London, called the Constitutional Society, and the Revolution\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nI certainly have the honor to belong to more clubs than one in which the\r\nConstitution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious\r\nRevolution are held in high reverence; and I reckon myself among the\r\nmost forward in my zeal for maintaining that Constitution and those\r\nprinciples in their utmost purity and vigor. It is because I do so that\r\nI think it necessary for me that there should be no mistake. Those who\r\ncultivate the memory of our Revolution, and those who are attached to\r\nthe Constitution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are\r\ninvolved with persons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the\r\nRevolution and Constitution, too frequently wander from their true\r\nprinciples, and are ready on every occasion to depart from the firm, but\r\ncautious and deliberate, spirit which produced the one and which\r\npresides in the other. Before I proceed to answer the more material\r\nparticulars in your letter, I shall beg leave to give you such\r\ninformation as I have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have\r\nthought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of\r\nFrance,--first assuring you that I am not, and that I have never been, a\r\nmember of either of those societies.\r\n\r\nThe first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or Society for\r\nConstitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of\r\nseven or eight years' standing. The institution of this society appears\r\nto be of a charitable, and so far of a laudable nature: it was intended\r\nfor the circulation, at the expense of the members, of many books which\r\nfew others would be at the expense of buying, and which might lie on the\r\nhands of the booksellers, to the great loss of an useful body of men.\r\nWhether the books so charitably circulated were ever as charitably read\r\nis more than I know. Possibly several of them have been exported to\r\nFrance, and, like goods not in request here, may with you have found a\r\nmarket. I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that\r\nare sent from hence. What improvements they have had in their passage\r\n(as it is said some liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot\r\ntell; but I never heard a man of common judgment or the least degree of\r\ninformation speak a word in praise of the greater part of the\r\npublications circulated by that society; nor have their proceedings been\r\naccounted, except by some of themselves, as of any serious consequence.\r\n\r\nYour National Assembly seems to entertain much the same opinion that I\r\ndo of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you reserved the whole\r\nstock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution Society, when\r\ntheir fellows in the Constitutional were in equity entitled to some\r\nshare. Since you have selected the Revolution Society as the great\r\nobject of your national thanks and praises, you will think me excusable\r\nin making its late conduct the subject of my observations. The National\r\nAssembly of France has given importance to these gentlemen by adopting\r\nthem; and they return the favor by acting as a committee in England for\r\nextending the principles of the National Assembly. Henceforward we must\r\nconsider them as a kind of privileged persons, as no inconsiderable\r\nmembers in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which\r\nhave given splendor to obscurity and distinction to undiscerned merit.\r\nUntil very lately I do not recollect to have heard of this club. I am\r\nquite sure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts,--nor, I\r\nbelieve, those of any person out of their own set. I find, upon inquiry,\r\nthat, on the anniversary of the Revolution in 1688, a club of\r\nDissenters, but of what denomination I know not, have long had the\r\ncustom of hearing a sermon in one of their churches, and that afterwards\r\nthey spent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I\r\nnever heard that any public measure or political system, much less that\r\nthe merits of the constitution of any foreign nation, had been the\r\nsubject of a formal proceeding at their festivals, until, to my\r\ninexpressible surprise, I found them in a sort of public capacity, by a\r\ncongratulatory address, giving an authoritative sanction to the\r\nproceedings of the National Assembly in France.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient principles and conduct of the club, so far at least as\r\nthey were declared, I see nothing to which I could take exception. I\r\nthink it very probable, that, for some purpose, new members may have\r\nentered among them,--and that some truly Christian politicians, who love\r\nto dispense benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand which\r\ndistributes the dole, may have made them the instruments of their pious\r\ndesigns. Whatever I may have reason to suspect concerning private\r\nmanagement, I shall speak of nothing as of a certainty but what is\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nFor one, I should be sorry to be thought directly or indirectly\r\nconcerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full share, along\r\nwith the rest of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in\r\nspeculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the public stage, in\r\nany place, ancient or modern,--in the republic of Rome, or the republic\r\nof Paris; but having no general apostolical mission, being a citizen of\r\na particular state, and being bound up, in a considerable degree, by its\r\npublic will, I should think it at least improper and irregular for me to\r\nopen a formal public correspondence with the actual government of a\r\nforeign nation, without the express authority of the government under\r\nwhich I live.\r\n\r\nI should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence under\r\nanything like an equivocal description, which to many, unacquainted with\r\nour usages, might make the address in which I joined appear as the act\r\nof persons in some sort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws\r\nof this kingdom, and authorized to speak the sense of some part of it.\r\nOn account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general\r\ndescriptions, and of the deceit which may be practised under them, and\r\nnot from mere formality, the House of Commons would reject the most\r\nsneaking petition for the most trifling object, under that mode of\r\nsignature to which you have thrown open the folding-doors of your\r\npresence-chamber, and have ushered into your National Assembly with as\r\nmuch ceremony and parade, and with as great a bustle of applause, as if\r\nyou had been visited by the whole representative majesty of the whole\r\nEnglish nation. If what this society has thought proper to send forth\r\nhad been a piece of argument, it would have signified little whose\r\nargument it was. It would be neither the more nor the less convincing on\r\naccount of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and\r\nresolution. It stands solely on authority; and in this case it is the\r\nmere authority of individuals, few of whom appear. Their signatures\r\nought, in my opinion, to have been annexed to their instrument. The\r\nworld would then have the means of knowing how many they are, who they\r\nare, and of what value their opinions may be, from their personal\r\nabilities, from their knowledge, their experience, or their lead and\r\nauthority in this state. To me, who am but a plain man, the proceeding\r\nlooks a little too refined and too ingenious; it has too much the air of\r\na political stratagem, adopted for the sake of giving, under a\r\nhigh-sounding name, an importance to the public declarations of this\r\nclub, which, when the matter came to be closely inspected, they did not\r\naltogether so well deserve. It is a policy that has very much the\r\ncomplexion of a fraud.\r\n\r\nI flatter myself that I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty as well\r\nas any gentleman of that society, be he who he will; and perhaps I have\r\ngiven as good proofs of my attachment to that cause, in the whole course\r\nof my public conduct. I think I envy liberty as little as they do to any\r\nother nation. But I cannot stand forward, and give praise or blame to\r\nanything which relates to human actions and human concerns on a simple\r\nview of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the\r\nnakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. Circumstances (which\r\nwith some gentlemen pass for nothing) give in reality to every political\r\nprinciple its distinguishing color and discriminating effect. The\r\ncircumstances are what render every civil and political scheme\r\nbeneficial or noxious to mankind. Abstractedly speaking, government, as\r\nwell as liberty, is good; yet could I, in common sense, ten years ago,\r\nhave felicitated France on her enjoyment of a government, (for she then\r\nhad a government,) without inquiry what the nature of that government\r\nwas, or how it was administered? Can I now congratulate the same nation\r\nupon its freedom? Is it because liberty in the abstract may be classed\r\namongst the blessings of mankind, that I am seriously to felicitate a\r\nmadman who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome\r\ndarkness of his cell on his restoration to the enjoyment of light and\r\nliberty? Am I to congratulate a highwayman and murderer who has broke\r\nprison upon the recovery of his natural rights? This would be to act\r\nover again the scene of the criminals condemned to the galleys, and\r\ntheir heroic deliverer, the metaphysic Knight of the Sorrowful\r\nCountenance.\r\n\r\nWhen I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at\r\nwork; and this, for a while, is all I can possibly know of it. The wild\r\ngas, the fixed air, is plainly broke loose: but we ought to suspend our\r\njudgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided, till the\r\nliquor is cleared, and until we see something deeper than the agitation\r\nof a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure, before I\r\nventure publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing, that they have\r\nreally received one. Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver;\r\nand adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings. I\r\nshould therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of\r\nFrance, until I was informed how it had been combined with government,\r\nwith public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies, with the\r\ncollection of an effective and well-distributed revenue, with morality\r\nand religion, with solidity and property, with peace and order, with\r\ncivil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things, too;\r\nand without them, liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and is not\r\nlikely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that\r\nthey may do what they please: we ought to see what it will please them\r\nto do, before we risk congratulations, which may be soon turned into\r\ncomplaints. Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate,\r\ninsulated, private men. But liberty, when men act in bodies, is _power_.\r\nConsiderate people, before they declare themselves, will observe the use\r\nwhich is made of _power_,--and particularly of so trying a thing as\r\n_new_ power in _new_ persons, of whose principles, tempers, and\r\ndispositions they have little or no experience, and in situations where\r\nthose who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the\r\nreal movers.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations, however, were below the transcendental dignity\r\nof the Revolution Society. Whilst I continued in the country, from\r\nwhence I had the honor of writing to you, I had but an imperfect idea of\r\ntheir transactions. On my coming to town, I sent for an account of their\r\nproceedings, which had been published by their authority, containing a\r\nsermon of Dr. Price, with the Duke de Rochefoucault's and the Archbishop\r\nof Aix's letter and several other documents annexed. The whole of that\r\npublication, with the manifest design of connecting the affairs of\r\nFrance with those of England, by drawing us into an imitation of the\r\nconduct of the National Assembly, gave me a considerable degree of\r\nuneasiness. The effect of that conduct upon the power, credit,\r\nprosperity, and tranquillity of France became every day more evident.\r\nThe form of constitution to be settled, for its future polity, became\r\nmore clear. We are now in a condition to discern with tolerable\r\nexactness the true nature of the object held up to our imitation. If the\r\nprudence of reserve and decorum dictates silence in some circumstances,\r\nin others prudence of a higher order may justify us in speaking our\r\nthoughts. The beginnings of confusion with us in England are at present\r\nfeeble enough; but with you we have seen an infancy still more feeble\r\ngrowing by moments into a strength to heap mountains upon mountains, and\r\nto wage war with Heaven itself. Whenever our neighbor's house is on\r\nfire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own.\r\nBetter to be despised for too anxious apprehensions than ruined by too\r\nconfident a security.\r\n\r\nSolicitous chiefly for the peace of my own country, but by no means\r\nunconcerned for yours, I wish to communicate more largely what was at\r\nfirst intended only for your private satisfaction. I shall still keep\r\nyour affairs in my eye, and continue to address myself to you. Indulging\r\nmyself in the freedom of epistolary intercourse, I beg leave to throw\r\nout my thoughts and express my feelings just as they arise in my mind,\r\nwith very little attention to formal method. I set out with the\r\nproceedings of the Revolution Society; but I shall not confine myself to\r\nthem. Is it possible I should? It looks to me as if I were in a great\r\ncrisis, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps\r\nof more than Europe. All circumstances taken together, the French\r\nRevolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the\r\nworld. The most wonderful things are brought about in many instances by\r\nmeans the most absurd and ridiculous, in the most ridiculous modes, and\r\napparently by the most contemptible instruments. Everything seems out of\r\nnature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of all sorts of\r\ncrimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this\r\nmonstrous tragi-comic scene, the most opposite passions necessarily\r\nsucceed and sometimes mix with each other in the mind: alternate\r\ncontempt and indignation, alternate laughter and tears, alternate scorn\r\nand horror.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be denied that to some this strange scene appeared\r\nin quite another point of view. Into them it inspired no other\r\nsentiments than those of exultation and rapture. They saw nothing in\r\nwhat has been done in France but a firm and temperate exertion of\r\nfreedom,--so consistent, on the whole, with morals and with piety as to\r\nmake it deserving not only of the secular applause of dashing\r\nMachiavelian politicians, but to render it a fit theme for all the\r\ndevout effusions of sacred eloquence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the forenoon of the fourth of November last, Doctor Richard Price, a\r\nNon-Conforming minister of eminence, preached at the Dissenting\r\nmeeting-house of the Old Jewry, to his club or society, a very\r\nextraordinary miscellaneous sermon, in which there are some good moral\r\nand religious sentiments, and not ill expressed, mixed up with a sort of\r\nporridge of various political opinions and reflections: but the\r\nRevolution in France is the grand ingredient in the caldron. I consider\r\nthe address transmitted by the Revolution Society to the National\r\nAssembly, through Earl Stanhope, as originating in the principles of\r\nthe sermon, and as a corollary from them. It was moved by the preacher\r\nof that discourse. It was passed by those who came reeking from the\r\neffect of the sermon, without any censure or qualification, expressed or\r\nimplied. If, however, any of the gentlemen concerned shall wish to\r\nseparate the sermon from the resolution, they know how to acknowledge\r\nthe one and to disavow the other. They may do it: I cannot.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I looked on that sermon as the public declaration of a man\r\nmuch connected with literary caballers and intriguing philosophers, with\r\npolitical theologians and theological politicians, both at home and\r\nabroad. I know they set him up as a sort of oracle; because, with the\r\nbest intentions in the world, he naturally _philippizes_, and chants his\r\nprophetic song in exact unison with their designs.\r\n\r\nThat sermon is in a strain which I believe has not been heard in this\r\nkingdom, in any of the pulpits which are tolerated or encouraged in it,\r\nsince the year 1648,--when a predecessor of Dr. Price, the Reverend Hugh\r\nPeters, made the vault of the king's own chapel at St. James's ring with\r\nthe honor and privilege of the saints, who, with the \"high praises of\r\nGod in their mouths, and a _two_-edged sword in their hands, were to\r\nexecute judgment on the heathen, and punishments upon the _people_; to\r\nbind their _kings_ with chains, and their _nobles_ with fetters of\r\niron.\"[77] Few harangues from the pulpit, except in the days of your\r\nLeague in France, or in the days of our Solemn League and Covenant in\r\nEngland, have ever breathed less of the spirit of moderation than this\r\nlecture in the Old Jewry. Supposing, however, that something like\r\nmoderation were visible in this political sermon, yet politics and the\r\npulpit are terms that have little agreement. No sound ought to be heard\r\nin the church but the healing voice of Christian charity. The cause of\r\ncivil liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion\r\nby this confusion of duties. Those who quit their proper character to\r\nassume what does not belong to them are, for the greater part, ignorant\r\nboth of the character they leave and of the character they assume.\r\nWholly unacquainted with the world, in which they are so fond of\r\nmeddling, and inexperienced in all its affairs, on which they pronounce\r\nwith so much confidence, they have nothing of politics but the passions\r\nthey excite. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought to\r\nbe allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis pulpit style, revived after so long a discontinuance, had to me the\r\nair of novelty, and of a novelty not wholly without danger. I do not\r\ncharge this danger equally to every part of the discourse. The hint\r\ngiven to a noble and reverend lay-divine, who is supposed high in office\r\nin one of our universities,[78] and other lay-divines \"of _rank_ and\r\nliterature,\" may be proper and seasonable, though somewhat new. If the\r\nnoble _Seekers_ should find nothing to satisfy their pious fancies in\r\nthe old staple of the national Church, or in all the rich variety to be\r\nfound in the well-assorted warehouses of the Dissenting congregations,\r\nDr. Price advises them to improve upon Non-Conformity, and to set up,\r\neach of them, a separate meeting-house upon his own particular\r\nprinciples.[79] It is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine\r\nshould be so earnest for setting up new churches, and so perfectly\r\nindifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them. His\r\nzeal is of a curious character. It is not for the propagation of his own\r\nopinions, but of any opinions. It is not for the diffusion of truth, but\r\nfor the spreading of contradiction. Let the noble teachers but dissent,\r\nit is no matter from whom or from what. This great point once secured,\r\nit is taken for granted their religion will be rational and manly. I\r\ndoubt whether religion would reap all the benefits which the calculating\r\ndivine computes from this \"great company of great preachers.\" It would\r\ncertainly be a valuable addition of nondescripts to the ample collection\r\nof known classes, genera, and species, which at present beautify the\r\n_hortus siccus_ of Dissent. A sermon from a noble duke, or a noble\r\nmarquis, or a noble earl, or baron bold, would certainly increase and\r\ndiversify the amusements of this town, which begins to grow satiated\r\nwith the uniform round of its vapid dissipations. I should only\r\nstipulate that these new _Mess-Johns_ in robes and coronets should keep\r\nsome sort of bounds in the democratic and levelling principles which are\r\nexpected from their titled pulpits. The new evangelists will, I dare\r\nsay, disappoint the hopes that are conceived of them. They will not\r\nbecome, literally as well as figuratively, polemic divines,--nor be\r\ndisposed so to drill their congregations, that they may, as in former\r\nblessed times, preach their doctrines to regiments of dragoons and corps\r\nof infantry and artillery. Such arrangements, however favorable to the\r\ncause of compulsory freedom, civil and religious, may not be equally\r\nconducive to the national tranquillity. These few restrictions I hope\r\nare no great stretches of intolerance, no very violent exertions of\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nBut I may say of our preacher, \"_Utinam nugis tota illa dedisset et\r\ntempora sævitiæ_.\" All things in this his fulminating bull are not of so\r\ninnoxious a tendency. His doctrines affect our Constitution in its vital\r\nparts. He tells the Revolution Society, in this political sermon, that\r\nhis Majesty \"is almost the _only_ lawful king in the world, because the\r\n_only_ one who owes his crown to _the choice of his people_.\" As to the\r\nkings of _the world_, all of whom (except one) this arch-pontiff of the\r\n_rights of men_, with all the plenitude and with more than the boldness\r\nof the Papal deposing power in its meridian fervor of the twelfth\r\ncentury, puts into one sweeping clause of ban and anathema, and\r\nproclaims usurpers by circles of longitude and latitude over the whole\r\nglobe, it behooves them to consider how they admit into their\r\nterritories these apostolic missionaries, who are to tell their subjects\r\nthey are not lawful kings. That is their concern. It is ours, as a\r\ndomestic interest of some moment, seriously to consider the solidity of\r\nthe _only_ principle upon which these gentlemen acknowledge a king of\r\nGreat Britain to be entitled to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, as applied to the prince now on the British throne,\r\neither is nonsense, and therefore neither true nor false, or it affirms\r\na most unfounded, dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional position.\r\nAccording to this spiritual doctor of politics, if his Majesty does not\r\nowe his crown to the choice of his people, he is no _lawful_ king. Now\r\nnothing can be more untrue than that the crown of this kingdom is so\r\nheld by his Majesty. Therefore, if you follow their rule, the king of\r\nGreat Britain, who most certainly does not owe his high office to any\r\nform of popular election, is in no respect better than the rest of the\r\ngang of usurpers, who reign, or rather rob, all over the face of this\r\nour miserable world, without any sort of right or title to the\r\nallegiance of their people. The policy of this general doctrine, so\r\nqualified, is evident enough. The propagators of this political gospel\r\nare in hopes their abstract principle (their principle that a popular\r\nchoice is necessary to the legal existence of the sovereign magistracy)\r\nwould be overlooked, whilst the king of Great Britain was not affected\r\nby it. In the mean time the ears of their congregations would be\r\ngradually habituated to it, as if it were a first principle admitted\r\nwithout dispute. For the present it would only operate as a theory,\r\npickled in the preserving juices of pulpit eloquence, and laid by for\r\nfuture use. _Condo et compono quæ mox depromere passim_. By this policy,\r\nwhilst our government is soothed with a reservation in its favor, to\r\nwhich it has no claim, the security which it has in common with all\r\ngovernments, so far as opinion is security, is taken away.\r\n\r\nThus these politicians proceed, whilst little notice is taken of their\r\ndoctrines; but when they come to be examined upon the plain meaning of\r\ntheir words and the direct tendency of their doctrines, then\r\nequivocations and slippery constructions come into play. When they say\r\nthe king owes his crown to the choice of his people, and is therefore\r\nthe only lawful sovereign in the world, they will perhaps tell us they\r\nmean to say no more than that some of the king's predecessors have been\r\ncalled to the throne by some sort of choice, and therefore he owes his\r\ncrown to the choice of his people. Thus, by a miserable subterfuge, they\r\nhope to render their proposition safe by rendering it nugatory. They are\r\nwelcome to the asylum they seek for their offence, since they take\r\nrefuge in their folly. For, if you admit this interpretation, how does\r\ntheir idea of election differ from our idea of inheritance? And how does\r\nthe settlement of the crown in the Brunswick line, derived from James\r\nthe First, come to legalize our monarchy rather than that of any of the\r\nneighboring countries? At some time or other, to be sure, all the\r\nbeginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called them to govern.\r\nThere is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of Europe\r\nwere at a remote period elective, with more or fewer limitations in the\r\nobjects of choice. But whatever kings might have been here or elsewhere\r\na thousand years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of\r\nEngland or France may have begun, the king of Great Britain is at this\r\nday king by a fixed rule of succession, according to the laws of his\r\ncountry; and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty\r\nare performed by him, (as they are performed,) he holds his crown in\r\ncontempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a single\r\nvote for a king amongst them, either individually or collectively:\r\nthough I make no doubt they would soon erect themselves into an\r\nelectoral college, if things were ripe to give effect to their claim.\r\nHis Majesty's heirs and successors, each in his time and order, will\r\ncome to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his\r\nMajesty has succeeded to that he wears.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the success of evasion in explaining away the gross\r\nerror _fact_, which supposes that his Majesty (though he holds it in\r\nconcurrence with the wishes) owes his crown to the choice of his people,\r\nyet nothing can evade their full, explicit declaration concerning the\r\nprinciple of a right in the people to choose,--which right is directly\r\nmaintained, and tenaciously adhered to. All the oblique insinuations\r\nconcerning election bottom in this proposition, and are referable to it.\r\nLest the foundation of the king's exclusive legal title should pass for\r\na mere rant of adulatory freedom, the political divine proceeds\r\ndogmatically to assert,[80] that, by the principles of the Revolution,\r\nthe people of England have acquired three fundamental rights, all of\r\nwhich, with him, compose one system, and lie together in one short\r\nsentence: namely, that we have acquired a right\r\n\r\n1. \"To choose our own governors.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"To cashier them for misconduct.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"To frame a government for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThis new, and hitherto unheard-of bill of rights, though made in the\r\nname of the whole people, belongs to those gentlemen and their faction\r\nonly. The body of the people of England have no share in it. They\r\nutterly disclaim it. They will resist the practical assertion of it with\r\ntheir lives and fortunes. They are bound to do so by the laws of their\r\ncountry, made at the time of that very Revolution which is appealed to\r\nin favor of the fictitious rights claimed by the society which abuses\r\nits name.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen of the Old Jewry, in all their reasonings on the\r\nRevolution of 1688, have a revolution which happened in England about\r\nforty years before, and the late French Revolution, so much before their\r\neyes and in their hearts, that they are constantly confounding all the\r\nthree together. It is necessary that we should separate what they\r\nconfound. We must recall their erring fancies to the _acts_ of the\r\nRevolution which we revere, for the discovery of its true _principles_.\r\nIf the _principles_ of the Revolution of 1688 are anywhere to be found,\r\nit is in the statute called the _Declaration of Right_. In that most\r\nwise, sober, and considerate declaration, drawn up by great lawyers and\r\ngreat statesmen, and not by warm and inexperienced enthusiasts, not one\r\nword is said, nor one suggestion made, of a general right \"to choose our\r\nown _governors_, to cashier them for misconduct, and to _form_ a\r\ngovernment for _ourselves_.\"\r\n\r\nThis Declaration of Right (the act of the 1st of William and Mary, sess.\r\n2, ch. 2) is the corner-stone of our Constitution, as reinforced,\r\nexplained, improved, and in its fundamental principles forever settled.\r\nIt is called \"An act for declaring the rights and liberties of the\r\nsubject, and for _settling_ the _succession_ of the crown.\" You will\r\nobserve that these rights and this succession are declared in one body,\r\nand bound indissolubly together.\r\n\r\nA few years after this period, a second opportunity offered for\r\nasserting a right of election to the crown. On the prospect of a total\r\nfailure of issue from King William, and from the princess, afterwards\r\nQueen Anne, the consideration of the settlement of the Crown, and of a\r\nfurther security for the liberties of the people, again came before the\r\nlegislature. Did they this second time make any provision for legalizing\r\nthe crown on the spurious Revolution principles of the Old Jewry? No.\r\nThey followed the principles which prevailed in the Declaration of\r\nRight; indicating with more precision the persons who were to inherit in\r\nthe Protestant line. This act also incorporated, by the same policy, our\r\nliberties and an hereditary succession in the same act. Instead of a\r\nright to choose our own governors, they declared that the _succession_\r\nin that line (the Protestant line drawn from James the First) was\r\nabsolutely necessary \"for the peace, quiet, and security of the realm,\"\r\nand that it was equally urgent on them \"to maintain a _certainty in the\r\nsuccession_ thereof, to which the subjects may safely have recourse for\r\ntheir protection.\" Both these acts, in which are heard the unerring,\r\nunambiguous oracles of Revolution policy, instead of countenancing the\r\ndelusive gypsy predictions of a \"right to choose our governors,\" prove\r\nto a demonstration how totally adverse the wisdom of the nation was from\r\nturning a case of necessity into a rule of law.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably there was at the Revolution, in the person of King\r\nWilliam, a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a\r\nregular hereditary succession; but it is against all genuine principles\r\nof jurisprudence to draw a principle from a law made in a special case\r\nand regarding an individual person. _Privilegium non transit in\r\nexemplum_. If ever there was a time favorable for establishing the\r\nprinciple that a king of popular choice was the only legal king, without\r\nall doubt it was at the Revolution. Its not being done at that time is\r\na proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any\r\ntime. There is no person so completely ignorant of our history as not to\r\nknow that the majority in Parliament, of both parties, were so little\r\ndisposed to anything resembling that principle, that at first they were\r\ndetermined to place the vacant crown, not on the head of the Prince of\r\nOrange, but on that of his wife, Mary, daughter of King James, the\r\neldest born of the issue of that king, which they acknowledged as\r\nundoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite story, to recall to\r\nyour memory all those circumstances which demonstrated that their\r\naccepting King William was not properly a _choice_; but to all those who\r\ndid not wish in effect to recall King James, or to deluge their country\r\nin blood, and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into\r\nthe peril they had just escaped, it was an act of _necessity_, in the\r\nstrictest moral sense in which necessity can be taken.\r\n\r\nIn the very act in which, for a time, and in a single case, Parliament\r\ndeparted from the strict order of inheritance, in favor of a prince who,\r\nthough not next, was, however, very near in the line of succession, it\r\nis curious to observe how Lord Somers, who drew the bill called the\r\nDeclaration of Right, has comported himself on that delicate occasion.\r\nIt is curious to observe with what address this temporary solution of\r\ncontinuity is kept from the eye; whilst all that could be found in this\r\nact of necessity to countenance the idea of an hereditary succession is\r\nbrought forward, and fostered, and made the most of, by this great man,\r\nand by the legislature who followed him. Quitting the dry, imperative\r\nstyle of an act of Parliament, he makes the Lords and Commons fall to a\r\npious legislative ejaculation, and declare that they consider it \"as a\r\nmarvellous providence, and merciful goodness of God to this nation, to\r\npreserve their said Majesties' _royal_ persons most happily to reign\r\nover us _on the throne of their ancestors_, for which, from the bottom\r\nof their hearts, they return their humblest thanks and praises.\" The\r\nlegislature plainly had in view the Act of Recognition of the first of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, chap. 3rd, and of that of James the First, chap. 1st,\r\nboth acts strongly declaratory of the inheritable nature of the crown;\r\nand in many parts they follow, with a nearly literal precision, the\r\nwords, and even the form of thanksgiving which is found in these old\r\ndeclaratory statutes.\r\n\r\nThe two Houses, in the act of King William, did not thank God that they\r\nhad found a fair opportunity to assert a right to choose their own\r\ngovernors, much less to make an election the _only lawful_ title to the\r\ncrown. Their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of\r\nit, as much as possible, was by them considered as a providential\r\nescape. They threw a politic, well-wrought veil over every circumstance\r\ntending to weaken the rights which in the meliorated order of succession\r\nthey meant to perpetuate, or which might furnish a precedent for any\r\nfuture departure from what they had then settled forever. Accordingly,\r\nthat they might not relax the nerves of their monarchy, and that they\r\nmight preserve a close conformity to the practice of their ancestors, as\r\nit appeared in the declaratory statutes of Queen Mary[81] and Queen\r\nElizabeth, in the next clause they vest, by recognition, in their\r\nMajesties _all_ the legal prerogatives of the crown, declaring \"that in\r\nthem they are most _fully_, rightfully, and _entirely_ invested,\r\nincorporated, united, and annexed.\" In the clause which follows, for\r\npreventing questions, by reason of any pretended titles to the crown,\r\nthey declare (observing also in this the traditionary language, along\r\nwith the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a\r\nrubric the language of the preceding acts of Elizabeth and James) that\r\non the preserving \"a _certainty_ in the SUCCESSION thereof the unity,\r\npeace, and tranquillity of this nation doth, under God, wholly depend.\"\r\n\r\nThey knew that a doubtful title of succession would but too much\r\nresemble an election, and that an election would be utterly destructive\r\nof the \"unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation,\" which they\r\nthought to be considerations of some moment. To provide for these\r\nobjects, and therefore to exclude forever the Old Jewry doctrine of \"a\r\nright to choose our own governors,\" they follow with a clause containing\r\na most solemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of Queen\r\nElizabeth,--as solemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favor of\r\nan hereditary succession, and as solemn a renunciation as could be made\r\nof the principles by this society imputed to them:--\"The Lords Spiritual\r\nand Temporal, and Commons, do, in the name of all the people aforesaid,\r\nmost humbly and faithfully submit _themselves, their heirs, and\r\nposterities forever_; and do faithfully promise that they will stand to,\r\nmaintain, and defend their said Majesties, and also the _limitation of\r\nthe crown_, herein specified and contained, to the utmost of their\r\npowers,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nSo far is it from being true that we acquired a right by the Revolution\r\nto elect our kings, that, if we had possessed it before, the English\r\nnation did at that time most solemnly renounce and abdicate it, for\r\nthemselves, and for all their posterity forever. These gentlemen may\r\nvalue themselves as much as they please on their Whig principles; but I\r\nnever desire to be thought a better Whig than Lord Somers, or to\r\nunderstand the principles of the Revolution better than those by whom it\r\nwas brought about, or to read in the Declaration of Right any mysteries\r\nunknown to those whose penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances,\r\nand in our hearts, the words and spirit of that immortal law.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that, aided with the powers derived from force and\r\nopportunity, the nation was at that time, in some sense, free to take\r\nwhat course it pleased for filling the throne,--but only free to do so\r\nupon the same grounds on which they might have wholly abolished their\r\nmonarchy, and every other part of their Constitution. However, they did\r\nnot think such bold changes within their commission. It is, indeed,\r\ndifficult, perhaps impossible, to give limits to the mere _abstract_\r\ncompetence of the supreme power, such as was exercised by Parliament at\r\nthat time; but the limits of a _moral_ competence, subjecting, even in\r\npowers more indisputably sovereign, occasional will to permanent reason,\r\nand to the steady maxims of faith, justice, and fixed fundamental\r\npolicy, are perfectly intelligible, and perfectly binding upon those who\r\nexercise any authority, under any name, or under any title, in the\r\nstate. The House of Lords, for instance, is not morally competent to\r\ndissolve the House of Commons,--no, nor even to dissolve itself, nor to\r\nabdicate, if it would, its portion in the legislature of the kingdom.\r\nThough a king may abdicate for his own person, he cannot abdicate for\r\nthe monarchy. By as strong, or by a stronger reason, the House of\r\nCommons cannot renounce its share of authority. The engagement and pact\r\nof society, which generally goes by the name of the Constitution,\r\nforbids such invasion and such surrender. The constituent parts of a\r\nstate are obliged to hold their public faith with each other, and with\r\nall those who derive any serious interest under their engagements, as\r\nmuch as the whole state is bound to keep its faith with separate\r\ncommunities: otherwise, competence and power would soon be confounded,\r\nand no law be left but the will of a prevailing force. On this\r\nprinciple, the succession of the crown has always been what it now is,\r\nan hereditary succession by law: in the old line it was a succession by\r\nthe Common Law; in the new by the statute law, operating on the\r\nprinciples of the Common Law, not changing the substance, but regulating\r\nthe mode and describing the persons. Both these descriptions of law are\r\nof the same force, and are derived from an equal authority, emanating\r\nfrom the common agreement and original compact of the state, _communi\r\nsponsione reipublicæ_, and as such are equally binding on king, and\r\npeople too, as long as the terms are observed, and they continue the\r\nsame body politic.\r\n\r\nIt is far from impossible to reconcile, if we do not suffer ourselves to\r\nbe entangled in the mazes of metaphysic sophistry, the use both of a\r\nfixed rule and an occasional deviation,--the sacredness of an hereditary\r\nprinciple of succession in our government with a power of change in its\r\napplication in cases of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity, (if\r\nwe take the measure of our rights by our exercise of them at the\r\nRevolution,) the change is to be confined to the peccant part only,--to\r\nthe part which produced the necessary deviation; and even then it is to\r\nbe effected without a decomposition of the whole civil and political\r\nmass, for the purpose of originating a new civil order out of the first\r\nelements of society.\r\n\r\nA state without the means of some change is without the means of its\r\nconservation. Without such means it might even risk the loss of that\r\npart of the Constitution which it wished the most religiously to\r\npreserve. The two principles of conservation and correction operated\r\nstrongly at the two critical periods of the Restoration and Revolution,\r\nwhen England found itself without a king. At both those periods the\r\nnation had lost the bond of union in their ancient edifice: they did\r\nnot, however, dissolve the whole fabric. On the contrary, in both cases\r\nthey regenerated the deficient part of the old Constitution through the\r\nparts which were not impaired. They kept these old parts exactly as they\r\nwere, that the part recovered might be suited to them. They acted by the\r\nancient organized states in the shape of their old organization, and not\r\nby the organic _moleculæ_ of a disbanded people. At no time, perhaps,\r\ndid the sovereign legislature manifest a more tender regard to that\r\nfundamental principle of British constitutional policy than at the time\r\nof the Revolution, when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary\r\nsuccession. The crown was carried somewhat out of the line in which it\r\nhad before moved; but the new line was derived from the same stock. It\r\nwas still a line of hereditary descent; still an hereditary descent in\r\nthe same blood, though an hereditary descent qualified with\r\nProtestantism. When the legislature altered the direction, but kept the\r\nprinciple, they showed that they held it inviolable.\r\n\r\nOn this principle, the law of inheritance had admitted some amendment in\r\nthe old time, and long before the era of the Revolution. Some time after\r\nthe Conquest great questions arose upon the legal principles of\r\nhereditary descent. It became a matter of doubt whether the heir _per\r\ncapita_ or the heir _per stirpes_ was to succeed; but whether the heir\r\n_per capita_ gave way when the heirdom _per stirpes_ took place, or the\r\nCatholic heir when the Protestant was preferred, the inheritable\r\nprinciple survived with a sort of immortality through all\r\ntransmigrations,--\r\n\r\n                            Multosque per annos\r\n    Stat fortuna domûs, et avi numerantur avorum.\r\n\r\nThis is the spirit of our Constitution, not only in its settled course,\r\nbut in all its revolutions. Whoever came in, or however he came in,\r\nwhether he obtained the crown by law or by force, the hereditary\r\nsuccession was either continued or adopted.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of the Society for Revolutions see nothing in that of 1688\r\nbut the deviation from the Constitution; and they take the deviation\r\nfrom the principle for the principle. They have little regard to the\r\nobvious consequences of their doctrine, though they may see that it\r\nleaves positive authority in very few of the positive institutions of\r\nthis country. When such an unwarrantable maxim is once established, that\r\nno throne is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes who\r\npreceded this era of fictitious election can be valid. Do these\r\ntheorists mean to imitate some of their predecessors, who dragged the\r\nbodies of our ancient sovereigns out of the quiet of their tombs? Do\r\nthey mean to attaint and disable backwards all the kings that have\r\nreigned before the Revolution, and consequently to stain the throne of\r\nEngland with the blot of a continual usurpation? Do they mean to\r\ninvalidate, annul, or to call into question, together with the titles of\r\nthe whole line of our kings, that great body of our statute law which\r\npassed under those whom they treat as usurpers? to annul laws of\r\ninestimable value to our liberties,--of as great value at least as any\r\nwhich have passed at or since the period of the Revolution? If kings who\r\ndid not owe their crown to the choice of their people had no title to\r\nmake laws, what will become of the statute _De tallagio non concedendo?_\r\nof the _Petition of Right?_ of the act of _Habeas Corpus?_ Do these new\r\ndoctors of the rights of men presume to assert that King James the\r\nSecond, who came to the crown as next of blood, according to the rules\r\nof a then unqualified succession, was not to all intents and purposes a\r\nlawful king of England, before he had done any of those acts which were\r\njustly construed into an abdication of his crown? If he was not, much\r\ntrouble in Parliament might have been saved at the period these\r\ngentlemen commemorate. But King James was a bad king with a good title,\r\nand not an usurper. The princes who succeeded according to the act of\r\nParliament which settled the crown on the Electress Sophia and on her\r\ndescendants, being Protestants, came in as much by a title of\r\ninheritance as King James did. He came in according to the law, as it\r\nstood at his accession to the crown; and the princes of the House of\r\nBrunswick came to the inheritance of the crown, not by election, but by\r\nthe law, as it stood at their several accessions, of Protestant descent\r\nand inheritance, as I hope I have shown sufficiently.\r\n\r\nThe law by which this royal family is specifically destined to the\r\nsuccession is the act of the 12th and 13th of King William. The terms of\r\nthis act bind \"us, and our _heirs_, and our _posterity_, to them, their\r\n_heirs_, and their _posterity_,\" being Protestants, to the end of time,\r\nin the same words as the Declaration of Right had bound us to the heirs\r\nof King William and Queen Mary. It therefore secures both an hereditary\r\ncrown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground, except the\r\nconstitutional policy of forming an establishment to secure that kind of\r\nsuccession which is to preclude a choice of the people forever, could\r\nthe legislature have fastidiously rejected the fair and abundant choice\r\nwhich our own country presented to them, and searched in strange lands\r\nfor a foreign princess, from whose womb the line of our future rulers\r\nwere to derive their title to govern millions of men through a series of\r\nages?\r\n\r\nThe Princess Sophia was named in the act of settlement of the 12th and\r\n13th of King William, for a _stock_ and root of _inheritance_ to our\r\nkings, and not for her merits as a temporary administratrix of a power\r\nwhich she might not, and in fact did not, herself ever exercise. She was\r\nadopted for one reason, and for one only,--because, says the act, \"the\r\nmost excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of\r\nHanover, is _daughter_ of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late\r\nQueen of Bohemia, _daughter_ of our late _sovereign lord_ King James the\r\nFirst, of happy memory, and is hereby declared to be the next in\r\n_succession_ in the Protestant line,\" &c., &c.; \"and the crown shall\r\ncontinue to the _heirs_ of her body, being Protestants.\" This limitation\r\nwas made by Parliament, that through the Princess Sophia an inheritable\r\nline not only was to be continued in future, but (what they thought very\r\nmaterial) that through her it was to be connected with the old stock of\r\ninheritance in King James the First; in order that the monarchy might\r\npreserve an unbroken unity through all ages, and might be preserved\r\n(with safety to our religion) in the old approved mode by descent, in\r\nwhich, if our liberties had been once endangered, they had often,\r\nthrough all storms and struggles of prerogative and privilege, been\r\npreserved. They did well. No experience has taught us that in any other\r\ncourse or method than that of an _hereditary crown_ our liberties can be\r\nregularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our _hereditary right_. An\r\nirregular, convulsive movement may be necessary to throw off an\r\nirregular, convulsive disease. But the course of succession is the\r\nhealthy habit of the British Constitution. Was it that the legislature\r\nwanted, at the act for the limitation of the crown in the Hanoverian\r\nline, drawn through the female descendants of James the First, a due\r\nsense of the inconveniences of having two or three, or possibly more,\r\nforeigners in succession to the British throne? No!--they had a due\r\nsense of the evils which might happen from such foreign rule, and more\r\nthan a due sense of them. But a more decisive proof cannot be given of\r\nthe full conviction of the British nation that the principles of the\r\nRevolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their pleasure, and\r\nwithout any attention to the ancient fundamental principles of our\r\ngovernment, than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary\r\nProtestant succession in the old line, with all the dangers and all the\r\ninconveniences of its being a foreign line full before their eyes, and\r\noperating with the utmost force upon their minds.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I should be ashamed to overload a matter so capable of\r\nsupporting itself by the then unnecessary support of any argument; but\r\nthis seditious, unconstitutional doctrine is now publicly taught,\r\navowed, and printed. The dislike I feel to revolutions, the signals for\r\nwhich have so often been given from pulpits,--the spirit of change that\r\nis gone abroad,--the total contempt which prevails with you, and may\r\ncome to prevail with us, of all ancient institutions, when set in\r\nopposition to a present sense of convenience, or to the bent of a\r\npresent inclination,--all these considerations make it not unadvisable,\r\nin my opinion, to call back our attention to the true principles of our\r\nown domestic laws, that you, my French friend, should begin to know, and\r\nthat we should continue to cherish them. We ought not, on either side of\r\nthe water, to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by the counterfeit\r\nwares which some persons, by a double fraud, export to you in illicit\r\nbottoms, as raw commodities of British growth, though wholly alien to\r\nour soil, in order afterwards to smuggle them back again into this\r\ncountry, manufactured after the newest Paris fashion of an improved\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThe people of England will not ape the fashions they have never tried,\r\nnor go back to those which they have found mischievous on trial. They\r\nlook upon the legal hereditary succession of their crown as among their\r\nrights, not as among their wrongs,--as a benefit, not as a\r\ngrievance,--as a security for their liberty, not as a badge of\r\nservitude. They look on the frame of their commonwealth, _such as it\r\nstands_, to be of inestimable value; and they conceive the undisturbed\r\nsuccession of the crown to be a pledge of the stability and perpetuity\r\nof all the other members of our Constitution.\r\n\r\nI shall beg leave, before I go any further, to take notice of some\r\npaltry artifices which the abettors of election as the only lawful title\r\nto the crown are ready to employ, in order to render the support of the\r\njust principles of our Constitution a task somewhat invidious. These\r\nsophisters substitute a fictitious cause, and feigned personages, in\r\nwhose favor they suppose you engaged, whenever you defend the\r\ninheritable nature of the crown. It is common with them to dispute as if\r\nthey were in a conflict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery\r\nwho formerly maintained, what I believe no creature now maintains, \"that\r\nthe crown is held by divine, hereditary, and indefeasible right.\" These\r\nold fanatics of single arbitrary power dogmatized as if hereditary\r\nroyalty was the only lawful government in the world,--just as our new\r\nfanatics of popular arbitrary power maintain that a popular election is\r\nthe sole lawful source of authority. The old prerogative enthusiasts, it\r\nis true, did speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too, as if\r\nmonarchy had more of a divine sanction than any other mode of\r\ngovernment,--and as if a right to govern by inheritance were in\r\nstrictness _indefeasible_ in every person who should be found in the\r\nsuccession to a throne, and under every circumstance, which no civil or\r\npolitical right can be. But an absurd opinion concerning the king's\r\nhereditary right to the crown does not prejudice one that is rational,\r\nand bottomed upon solid principles of law and policy. If all the absurd\r\ntheories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which\r\nthey are conversant, we should have no law and no religion left in the\r\nworld. But an absurd theory on one side of a question forms no\r\njustification for alleging a false fact or promulgating mischievous\r\nmaxims on the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second claim of the Revolution Society is \"a right of cashiering\r\ntheir governors for _misconduct_.\" Perhaps the apprehensions our\r\nancestors entertained of forming such a precedent as that \"of cashiering\r\nfor misconduct\" was the cause that the declaration of the act which\r\nimplied the abdication of King James was, if it had any fault, rather\r\ntoo guarded and too circumstantial.[82] But all this guard, and all this\r\naccumulation of circumstances, serves to show the spirit of caution\r\nwhich predominated in the national councils, in a situation in which men\r\nirritated by oppression, and elevated by a triumph over it, are apt to\r\nabandon themselves to violent and extreme courses; it shows the anxiety\r\nof the great men who influenced the conduct of affairs at that great\r\nevent to make the Revolution a parent of settlement, and not a nursery\r\nof future revolutions.\r\n\r\nNo government could stand a moment, if it could be blown down with\r\nanything so loose and indefinite as an opinion of \"_misconduct_.\" They\r\nwho led at the Revolution grounded their virtual abdication of King\r\nJames upon no such light and uncertain principle. They charged him with\r\nnothing less than a design, confirmed by a multitude of illegal overt\r\nacts, to _subvert the Protestant Church and State_, and their\r\n_fundamental_, unquestionable laws and liberties: they charged him with\r\nhaving broken the _original contrast_ between king and people. This was\r\nmore than _misconduct_. A grave and overruling necessity obliged them to\r\ntake the step they took, and took with infinite reluctance, as under\r\nthat most rigorous of all laws. Their trust for the future preservation\r\nof the Constitution was not in future revolutions. The grand policy of\r\nall their regulations was to render it almost impracticable for any\r\nfuture sovereign to compel the states of the kingdom to have again\r\nrecourse to those violent remedies. They left the crown, what in the eye\r\nand estimation of law it had ever been, perfectly irresponsible. In\r\norder to lighten the crown still further, they aggravated responsibility\r\non ministers of state. By the statute of the first of King William,\r\nsess. 2d, called \"_the act for declaring the rights and liberties of the\r\nsubject, and for settling the succession of the crown_,\" they enacted\r\nthat the ministers should serve the crown on the terms of that\r\ndeclaration. They secured soon after the _frequent meetings of\r\nParliament_, by which the whole government would be under the constant\r\ninspection and active control of the popular representative and of the\r\nmagnates of the kingdom. In the next great constitutional act, that of\r\nthe 12th and 13th of King William, for the further limitation of the\r\ncrown, and _better_ securing the rights and liberties of the subject,\r\nthey provided \"that no pardon under the great seal of England should be\r\npleadable to an impeachment by the Commons in Parliament.\" The rule laid\r\ndown for government in the Declaration of Right, the constant inspection\r\nof Parliament, the practical claim of impeachment, they thought\r\ninfinitely a better security not only for their constitutional liberty,\r\nbut against the vices of administration, than the reservation of a right\r\nso difficult in the practice, so uncertain in the issue, and often so\r\nmischievous in the consequences, as that \"cashiering their governors.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Price, in this sermon,[83] condemns, very properly, the practice of\r\ngross adulatory addresses to kings. Instead of this fulsome style, he\r\nproposes that his Majesty should be told, on occasions of\r\ncongratulation, that \"he is to consider himself as more properly the\r\nservant than the sovereign of his people.\" For a compliment, this new\r\nform of address does not seem to be very soothing. Those who are\r\nservants in name, as well as in effect, do not like to be told of their\r\nsituation, their duty, and their obligations. The slave in the old play\r\ntells his master, \"_Hæc commemeratio est quasi exprobratio_.\" It is not\r\npleasant as compliment; it is not wholesome as instruction. After all,\r\nif the king were to bring himself to echo this new kind of address, to\r\nadopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of Servant of the\r\nPeople as his royal style, how either he or we should be much mended by\r\nit I cannot imagine. I have seen very assuming letters signed, \"Your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant.\" The proudest domination that ever was\r\nendured on earth took a title of still greater humility than that which\r\nis now proposed for sovereigns by the Apostle of Liberty. Kings and\r\nnations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himself \"The\r\nServant of Servants\"; and mandates for deposing sovereigns were sealed\r\nwith the signet of \"The Fisherman.\"\r\n\r\nI should have considered all this as no more than a sort of flippant,\r\nvain discourse, in which, as in an unsavory fume, several persons suffer\r\nthe spirit of liberty to evaporate, if it were not plainly in support of\r\nthe idea, and a part of the scheme, of \"cashiering kings for\r\nmisconduct.\" In that light it is worth some observation.\r\n\r\nKings, in one sense, are undoubtedly the servants of the people, because\r\ntheir power has no other rational end than that of the general\r\nadvantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary sense, (by\r\nour Constitution, at least,) anything like servants,--the essence of\r\nwhose situation is to obey the commands of some other, and to be\r\nremovable at pleasure. But the king of Great Britain obeys no other\r\nperson; all other persons are individually, and collectively too, under\r\nhim, and owe to him a legal obedience. The law, which knows neither to\r\nflatter nor to insult, calls this high-magistrate, not our servant, as\r\nthis humble divine calls him, but \"_our sovereign lord the king_\"; and\r\nwe, on our parts, have learned to speak only the primitive language of\r\nthe law, and not the confused jargon of their Babylonian pulpits.\r\n\r\nAs he is not to obey us, but we are to obey the law in him, our\r\nConstitution has made no sort of provision towards rendering him, as a\r\nservant, in any degree responsible. Our Constitution knows nothing of a\r\nmagistrate like the _Justicia_ of Aragon,--nor of any court legally\r\nappointed, nor of any process legally settled, for submitting the king\r\nto the responsibility belonging to all servants. In this he is not\r\ndistinguished from the commons and the lords, who, in their several\r\npublic capacities, can never be called to an account for their conduct;\r\nalthough the Revolution Society chooses to assert, in direct opposition\r\nto one of the wisest and most beautiful parts of our Constitution, that\r\n\"a king is no more than the first servant of the public, created by it,\r\n_and responsible to it_.\"\r\n\r\nIll would our ancestors at the Revolution have deserved their fame for\r\nwisdom, if they had found no security for their freedom, but in\r\nrendering their government feeble in its operations and precarious in\r\nits tenure,--if they had been able to contrive no better remedy against\r\narbitrary power than civil confusion. Let these gentlemen state who that\r\n_representative_ public is to whom they will affirm the king, as a\r\nservant, to be responsible. It will be then time enough for me to\r\nproduce to them the positive statute law which affirms that he is not.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of cashiering kings, of which these gentlemen talk so much\r\nat their ease, can rarely, if ever, be performed without force. It then\r\nbecomes a case of war, and not of constitution. Laws are commanded to\r\nhold their tongues amongst arms; and tribunals fall to the ground with\r\nthe peace they are no longer able to uphold. The Revolution of 1688 was\r\nobtained by a just war, in the only case in which any war, and much more\r\na civil war, can be just. \"_Justa bella quibus_ NECESSARIA.\" The\r\nquestion of dethroning, or, if these gentlemen, like the phrase better,\r\n\"cashiering kings,\" will always be, as it has always been, an\r\nextraordinary question of state, and wholly out of the law: a question\r\n(like all other questions of state) of dispositions, and of means, and\r\nof probable consequences, rather than of positive rights. As it was not\r\nmade for common abuses, so it is not to be agitated by common minds. The\r\nspeculative line of demarcation, where obedience ought to end and\r\nresistance must begin, is faint, obscure, and not easily definable. It\r\nis not a single act or a single event which determines it. Governments\r\nmust be abused and deranged indeed, before it can be thought of; and the\r\nprospect of the future must be as bad as the experience of the past.\r\nWhen things are in that lamentable condition, the nature of the disease\r\nis to indicate the remedy to those whom Nature has qualified to\r\nadminister in extremities this critical, ambiguous, bitter potion to a\r\ndistempered state. Times and occasions and provocations will teach their\r\nown lessons. The wise will determine from the gravity of the case; the\r\nirritable, from sensibility to oppression; the high-minded, from disdain\r\nand indignation at abusive power in unworthy hands; the brave and bold,\r\nfrom the love of honorable danger in a generous cause: but, with or\r\nwithout right, a revolution will be the very last resource of the\r\nthinking and the good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third head of right asserted by the pulpit of the Old Jewry, namely,\r\nthe \"right to form a government for ourselves,\" has, at least, as little\r\ncountenance from anything done at the Revolution, either in precedent or\r\nprinciple, as the two first of their claims. The Revolution was made to\r\npreserve our _ancient_ indisputable laws and liberties, and that\r\n_ancient_ constitution of government which is our only security for law\r\nand liberty. If you are desirous of knowing the spirit of our\r\nConstitution, and the policy which predominated in that great period\r\nwhich has secured it to this hour, pray look for both in our histories,\r\nin our records, in our acts of Parliament and journals of Parliament,\r\nand not in the sermons of the Old Jewry, and the after-dinner toasts of\r\nthe Revolution Society. In the former you will find other ideas and\r\nanother language. Such a claim is as ill-suited to our temper and wishes\r\nas it is unsupported by any appearance of authority. The very idea of\r\nthe fabrication of a new government is enough to fill us with disgust\r\nand horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish,\r\nto derive all we possess as _an inheritance from our forefathers_. Upon\r\nthat body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate\r\nany scion alien to the nature of the original plant. All the\r\nreformations we have hitherto made have proceeded upon the principle of\r\nreference to antiquity; and I hope, nay, I am persuaded, that all those\r\nwhich possibly may be made hereafter will be carefully formed upon\r\nanalogical precedent, authority, and example.\r\n\r\nOur oldest reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will see that Sir\r\nEdward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men\r\nwho follow him, to Blackstone,[84] are industrious to prove the pedigree\r\nof our liberties. They endeavor to prove that the ancient charter, the\r\nMagna Charta of King John, was connected with another positive charter\r\nfrom Henry the First, and that both the one and the other were nothing\r\nmore than a reaffirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the\r\nkingdom. In the matter of fact, for the greater part, these authors\r\nappear to be in the right; perhaps not always: but if the lawyers\r\nmistake in some particulars, it proves my position still the more\r\nstrongly; because it demonstrates the powerful prepossession towards\r\nantiquity with which the minds of all our lawyers and legislators, and\r\nof all the people whom they wish to influence, have been always filled,\r\nand the stationary policy of this kingdom in considering their most\r\nsacred rights and franchises as an _inheritance_.\r\n\r\nIn the famous law of the 3rd of Charles the First, called the _Petition\r\nof Right,_ the Parliament says to the king, \"Your subjects have\r\n_inherited_ this freedom\": claiming their franchises, not on abstract\r\nprinciples, \"as the rights of men,\" but as the rights of Englishmen, and\r\nas a patrimony derived from their forefathers. Selden, and the other\r\nprofoundly learned men who drew this Petition of Right, were as well\r\nacquainted, at least, with all the general theories concerning the\r\n\"rights of men\" as any of the discoursers in our pulpits or on your\r\ntribune: full as well as Dr. Price, or as the Abbé Sièyes. But, for\r\nreasons worthy of that practical wisdom which superseded their theoretic\r\nscience, they preferred this positive, recorded, _hereditary_ title to\r\nall which can be dear to the man and the citizen to that vague,\r\nspeculative right which exposed their sure inheritance to be scrambled\r\nfor and torn to pieces by every wild, litigious spirit.\r\n\r\nThe same policy pervades all the laws which have since been made for the\r\npreservation of our liberties. In the 1st of William and Mary, in the\r\nfamous statute called the Declaration of Right, the two Houses utter not\r\na syllable of \"a right to frame a government for themselves.\" You will\r\nsee that their whole care was to secure the religion, laws, and\r\nliberties that had been long possessed, and had been lately endangered.\r\n\"Taking[85] into their most serious consideration the _best_ means for\r\nmaking such an establishment that their religion, laws, and liberties\r\nmight not be in danger of being again subverted,\" they auspicate all\r\ntheir proceedings by stating as some of those _best_ means, \"in the\r\n_first place_,\" to do \"as their _ancestors in like cases have usually_\r\ndone for vindicating their _ancient_ rights and liberties, to\r\n_declare_\";--and then they pray the king and queen \"that it may be\r\n_declared_ and enacted that _all and singular_ the rights and liberties\r\n_asserted and declared_ are the true _ancient_ and indubitable rights\r\nand liberties of the people of this kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nYou will observe, that, from Magna Charta to the Declaration of Right,\r\nit has been the uniform policy of our Constitution to claim and assert\r\nour liberties as an _entailed inheritance_ derived to us from our\r\nforefathers, and to be transmitted to our posterity,--as an estate\r\nspecially belonging to the people of this kingdom, without any reference\r\nwhatever to any other more general or prior right. By this means our\r\nConstitution preserves an unity in so great a diversity of its parts. We\r\nhave an inheritable crown, an inheritable peerage, and a House of\r\nCommons and a people inheriting privileges, franchises, and liberties\r\nfrom a long line of ancestors.\r\n\r\nThis policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection,--or\r\nrather the happy effect of following Nature, which is wisdom without\r\nreflection, and above it. A spirit of innovation is generally the result\r\nof a selfish temper and confined views. People will not look forward to\r\nposterity, who never look backward to their ancestors. Besides, the\r\npeople of England well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a\r\nsure principle of conservation, and a sure principle of transmission,\r\nwithout at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves\r\nacquisition free; but it secures what it acquires. Whatever advantages\r\nare obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in\r\na sort of family settlement, grasped as in a kind of mortmain forever.\r\nBy a constitutional policy working after the pattern of Nature, we\r\nreceive, we hold, we transmit our government and our privileges, in the\r\nsame manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives.\r\nThe institutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of\r\nProvidence, are handed down to us, and from us, in the same course and\r\norder. Our political system is placed in a just correspondence and\r\nsymmetry with the order of the world, and with the mode of existence\r\ndecreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts,--wherein, by\r\nthe disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great\r\nmysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is\r\nnever old or middle-aged or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable\r\nconstancy, moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall,\r\nrenovation, and progression. Thus, by preserving the method of Nature in\r\nthe conduct of the state, in what we improve we are never wholly new, in\r\nwhat we retain we are never wholly obsolete. By adhering in this manner\r\nand on those principles to our forefathers, we are guided, not by the\r\nsuperstition of antiquarians, but by the spirit of philosophic analogy.\r\nIn this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the\r\nimage of a relation in blood: binding up the Constitution of our country\r\nwith our dearest domestic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the\r\nbosom of our family affections; keeping inseparable, and cherishing with\r\nthe warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our\r\nstate, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.\r\n\r\nThrough the same plan of a conformity to Nature in our artificial\r\ninstitutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful\r\ninstincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason,\r\nwe have derived several other, and those no small benefits, from\r\nconsidering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting\r\nas if in the presence of canonized forefathers, the spirit of freedom,\r\nleading in itself to misrule and excess, is tempered with an awful\r\ngravity. This idea of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of\r\nhabitual native dignity, which prevents that upstart insolence almost\r\ninevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers\r\nof any distinction. By this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom.\r\nIt carries an imposing and majestic aspect. It has a pedigree and\r\nillustrating ancestors. It has its bearings and its ensigns armorial. It\r\nhas its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records,\r\nevidences, and titles. We procure reverence to our civil institutions on\r\nthe principle upon which Nature teaches us to revere individual men: on\r\naccount of their age, and on account of those from whom they are\r\ndescended. All your sophisters cannot produce anything better adapted to\r\npreserve a rational and manly freedom than the course that we have\r\npursued, who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations, our\r\nbreasts rather than our inventions, for the great conservatories and\r\nmagazines of our rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou might, if you pleased, have profited of our example, and have given\r\nto your recovered freedom a correspondent dignity. Your privileges,\r\nthough discontinued, were not lost to memory. Your Constitution, it is\r\ntrue, whilst you were out of possession, suffered waste and\r\ndilapidation; but you possessed in some parts the walls, and in all the\r\nfoundations, of a noble and venerable castle. You might have repaired\r\nthose walls; you might have built on those old foundations. Your\r\nConstitution was suspended before it was perfected; but you had the\r\nelements of a Constitution very nearly as good as could be wished. In\r\nyour old states you possessed that variety of parts corresponding with\r\nthe various descriptions of which your community was happily composed;\r\nyou had all that combination and all that opposition of interests, you\r\nhad that action and counteraction, which, in the natural and in the\r\npolitical world, from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers draws\r\nout the harmony of the universe. These opposed and conflicting\r\ninterests, which you considered as so great a blemish in your old and in\r\nour present Constitution, interpose a salutary check to all precipitate\r\nresolutions. They render deliberation a matter, not of choice, but of\r\nnecessity; they make all change a subject of _compromise_, which\r\nnaturally begets moderation; they produce _temperaments_, preventing the\r\nsore evil of harsh, crude, unqualified reformations, and rendering all\r\nthe headlong exertions of arbitrary power, in the few or in the many,\r\nforever impracticable. Through that diversity of members and interests,\r\ngeneral liberty had as many securities as there were separate views in\r\nthe several orders; whilst by pressing down the whole by the weight of a\r\nreal monarchy, the separate parts would have been prevented from warping\r\nand starting from their allotted places.\r\n\r\nYou had all these advantages in your ancient states; but you chose to\r\nact as if you had never been moulded into civil society, and had\r\neverything to begin anew. You began ill, because you began by despising\r\neverything that belonged to you. You set up your trade without a\r\ncapital. If the last generations of your country appeared without much\r\nlustre in your eyes, you might have passed them by, and derived your\r\nclaims from a more early race of ancestors. Under a pious predilection\r\nfor those ancestors, your imaginations would have realized in them a\r\nstandard of virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the hour;\r\nand you would have risen with the example to whose imitation you\r\naspired. Respecting your forefathers, you would have been taught to\r\nrespect yourselves. You would not have chosen to consider the French as\r\na people of yesterday, as a nation of low-born, servile wretches until\r\nthe emancipating year of 1789. In order to furnish, at the expense of\r\nyour honor, an excuse to your apologists here for several enormities of\r\nyours, you would not have been content to be represented as a gang of\r\nMaroon slaves, suddenly broke loose from the house of bondage, and\r\ntherefore to be pardoned for your abuse of the liberty to which you were\r\nnot accustomed, and were ill fitted. Would it not, my worthy friend,\r\nhave been wiser to have you thought, what I for one always thought you,\r\na generous and gallant nation, long misled to your disadvantage by your\r\nhigh and romantic sentiments of fidelity, honor, and loyalty; that\r\nevents had been unfavorable to you, but that you were not enslaved\r\nthrough any illiberal or servile disposition; that, in your most devoted\r\nsubmission, you were actuated by a principle of public spirit; and that\r\nit was your country you worshipped, in the person of your king? Had you\r\nmade it to be understood, that, in the delusion of this amiable error,\r\nyou had gone further than your wise ancestors,--that you were resolved\r\nto resume your ancient privileges, whilst you preserved the spirit of\r\nyour ancient and your recent loyalty and honor; or if, diffident of\r\nyourselves, and not clearly discerning the almost obliterated\r\nConstitution of your ancestors, you had looked to your neighbors in this\r\nland, who had kept alive the ancient principles and models of the old\r\ncommon law of Europe, meliorated and adapted to its present state,--by\r\nfollowing wise examples you would have given new examples of wisdom to\r\nthe world. You would have rendered the cause of liberty venerable in the\r\neyes of every worthy mind in every nation. You would have shamed\r\ndespotism from the earth, by showing that freedom was not only\r\nreconcilable, but, as, when well disciplined, it is, auxiliary to law.\r\nYou would have had an unoppressive, but a productive revenue. You would\r\nhave had a flourishing commerce to feed it. You would have had a free\r\nConstitution, a potent monarchy, a disciplined army, a reformed and\r\nvenerated clergy,--a mitigated, but spirited nobility, to lead your\r\nvirtue, not to overlay it; you would have had a liberal order of\r\ncommons, to emulate and to recruit that nobility; you would have had a\r\nprotected, satisfied, laborious, and obedient people, taught to seek and\r\nto recognize the happiness that is to be found by virtue in all\r\nconditions,--in which consists the true moral equality of mankind, and\r\nnot in that monstrous fiction which, by inspiring false ideas and vain\r\nexpectations into men destined to travel in the obscure walk of\r\nlaborious life, serves only to aggravate and embitter that real\r\ninequality which it never can remove, and which the order of civil life\r\nestablishes as much for the benefit of those whom it must leave in an\r\nhumble state as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more\r\nsplendid, but not more happy. You had a smooth and easy career of\r\nfelicity and glory laid open to you, beyond anything recorded in the\r\nhistory of the world; but you have shown that difficulty is good for\r\nman.\r\n\r\nCompute your gains; see what is got by those extravagant and\r\npresumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all\r\ntheir predecessors, and all their contemporaries, and even to despise\r\nthemselves, until the moment in which they became truly despicable. By\r\nfollowing those false lights, France has bought undisguised calamities\r\nat a higher price than any nation has purchased the most unequivocal\r\nblessings. France has bought poverty by crime. France has not sacrificed\r\nher virtue to her interest; but she has abandoned her interest, that she\r\nmight prostitute her virtue. All other nations have begun the fabric of\r\na new government, or the reformation of an old, by establishing\r\noriginally, or by enforcing with greater exactness, some rites or other\r\nof religion. All other people have laid the foundations of civil freedom\r\nin severer manners, and a system of a more austere and masculine\r\nmorality. France, when she let loose the reins of regal authority,\r\ndoubled the license of a ferocious dissoluteness in manners, and of an\r\ninsolent irreligion in opinions and practices,--and has extended through\r\nall ranks of life, as if she were communicating some privilege, or\r\nlaying open some secluded benefit, all the unhappy corruptions that\r\nusually were the disease of wealth and power. This is one of the new\r\nprinciples of equality in France.\r\n\r\nFrance, by the perfidy of her leaders, has utterly disgraced the tone of\r\nlenient council in the cabinets of princes, and disarmed it of its most\r\npotent topics. She has sanctified the dark, suspicious maxims of\r\ntyrannous distrust, and taught kings to tremble at (what will hereafter\r\nbe called) the delusive plausibilities of moral politicians. Sovereigns\r\nwill consider those who advise them to place an unlimited confidence in\r\ntheir people as subverters of their thrones,--as traitors who aim at\r\ntheir destruction, by leading their easy good-nature, under specious\r\npretences, to admit combinations of bold and faithless men into a\r\nparticipation of their power. This alone (if there were nothing else) is\r\nan irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that your\r\nParliament of Paris told your king, that, in calling the states\r\ntogether, he had nothing to fear but the prodigal excess of their zeal\r\nin providing for the support of the throne. It is right that these men\r\nshould hide their heads. It is right that they should bear their part in\r\nthe ruin which their counsel has brought on their sovereign and their\r\ncountry. Such sanguine declarations tend to lull authority asleep,--to\r\nencourage it rashly to engage in perilous adventures of untried\r\npolicy,--to neglect those provisions, preparations, and precautions\r\nwhich distinguish benevolence from imbecility, and without which no man\r\ncan answer for the salutary effect of any abstract plan of government or\r\nof freedom. For want of these, they have seen the medicine of the state\r\ncorrupted into its poison. They have seen the French rebel against a\r\nmild and lawful monarch, with more fury, outrage, and insult than ever\r\nany people has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper or\r\nthe most sanguinary tyrant. Their resistance was made to concession;\r\ntheir revolt was from protection; their blow was aimed at a hand holding\r\nout graces, favors, and immunities.\r\n\r\nThis was unnatural. The rest is in order. They have found their\r\npunishment in their success. Laws overturned; tribunals subverted;\r\nindustry without vigor; commerce expiring; the revenue unpaid, yet the\r\npeople impoverished; a church pillaged, and a state not relieved; civil\r\nand military anarchy made the constitution of the kingdom; everything\r\nhuman and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national\r\nbankruptcy the consequence; and, to crown all, the paper securities of\r\nnew, precarious, tottering power, the discredited paper securities of\r\nimpoverished fraud and beggared rapine, held out as a currency for the\r\nsupport of an empire, in lieu of the two great recognized species that\r\nrepresent the lasting, conventional credit of mankind, which disappeared\r\nand hid themselves in the earth from whence they came, when the\r\nprinciple of property, whose creatures and representatives they are, was\r\nsystematically subverted.\r\n\r\nWere all these dreadful things necessary? Were they the inevitable\r\nresults of the desperate struggle of determined patriots, compelled to\r\nwade through blood and tumult to the quiet shore of a tranquil and\r\nprosperous liberty? No! nothing like it. The fresh ruins of France,\r\nwhich shock our feelings wherever we can turn our eyes, are not the\r\ndevastation of civil war: they are the sad, but instructive monuments of\r\nrash and ignorant counsel in time of profound peace. They are the\r\ndisplay of inconsiderate and presumptuous, because unresisted and\r\nirresistible authority. The persons who have thus squandered away the\r\nprecious treasure of their crimes, the persons who have made this\r\nprodigal and wild waste of public evils, (the last stake reserved for\r\nthe ultimate ransom of the state,) have met in their progress with\r\nlittle, or rather with no opposition at all. Their whole march was more\r\nlike a triumphal procession than the progress of a war. Their pioneers\r\nhave gone before them, and demolished and laid everything level at their\r\nfeet. Not one drop of _their_ blood have they shed in the cause of the\r\ncountry they have ruined. They have made no sacrifices to their projects\r\nof greater consequence than their shoe-buckles, whilst they were\r\nimprisoning their king, murdering their fellow-citizens, and bathing in\r\ntears and plunging in poverty and distress thousands of worthy men and\r\nworthy families. Their cruelty has not even been the base result of\r\nfear. It has been the effect of their sense of perfect safety, in\r\nauthorizing treasons, robberies, rapes, assassinations, slaughters, and\r\nburnings, throughout their harassed land. But the cause of all was plain\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis unforced choice, this fond election of evil, would appear perfectly\r\nunaccountable, if we did not consider the composition of the National\r\nAssembly: I do not mean its formal constitution, which, as it now\r\nstands, is exceptionable enough, but the materials of which in a great\r\nmeasure it is composed, which is of ten thousand times greater\r\nconsequence than all the formalities in the world. If we were to know\r\nnothing of this assembly but by its title and function, no colors could\r\npaint to the imagination anything more venerable. In that light, the\r\nmind of an inquirer, subdued by such an awful image as that of the\r\nvirtue and wisdom of a whole people collected into one focus, would\r\npause and hesitate in condemning things even of the very worst aspect.\r\nInstead of blamable, they would appear only mysterious. But no name, no\r\npower, no function, no artificial institution whatsoever, can make the\r\nmen, of whom any system of authority is composed, any other than God,\r\nand Nature, and education, and their habits of life have made them.\r\nCapacities beyond these the people have not to give. Virtue and wisdom\r\nmay be the objects of their choice; but their choice confers neither the\r\none nor the other on those upon whom they lay their ordaining hands.\r\nThey have not the engagement of Nature, they have not the promise of\r\nRevelation for any such powers.\r\n\r\nAfter I had read over the list of the persons and descriptions elected\r\ninto the _Tiers État_, nothing which they afterwards did could appear\r\nastonishing. Among them, indeed, I saw some of known rank, some of\r\nshining talents; but of any practical experience in the state not one\r\nman was to be found. The best were only men of theory. But whatever the\r\ndistinguished few may have been, it is the substance and mass of the\r\nbody which constitutes its character, and must finally determine its\r\ndirection. In all bodies, those who will lead must also, in a\r\nconsiderable degree, follow. They must conform their propositions to the\r\ntaste, talent, and disposition of those whom they wish to conduct:\r\ntherefore, if an assembly is viciously or feebly composed in a very\r\ngreat part of it, nothing but such a supreme degree of virtue as very\r\nrarely appears in the world, and for that reason cannot enter into\r\ncalculation, will prevent the men of talents disseminated through it\r\nfrom becoming only the expert instruments of absurd projects. If, what\r\nis the more likely event, instead of that unusual degree of virtue, they\r\nshould be actuated by sinister ambition and a lust of meretricious\r\nglory, then the feeble part of the assembly, to whom at first they\r\nconform, becomes, in its turn, the dupe and instrument of their designs.\r\nIn this political traffic, the leaders will be obliged to bow to the\r\nignorance of their followers, and the followers to become subservient to\r\nthe worst designs of their leaders.\r\n\r\nTo secure any degree of sobriety in the propositions made by the leaders\r\nin any public assembly, they ought to respect, in some degree perhaps to\r\nfear, those whom they conduct. To be led any otherwise than blindly, the\r\nfollowers must be qualified, if not for actors, at least for judges;\r\nthey must also be judges of natural weight and authority. Nothing can\r\nsecure a steady and moderate conduct in such assemblies, but that the\r\nbody of them should be respectably composed, in point of condition in\r\nlife, of permanent property, of education, and of such habits as enlarge\r\nand liberalize the understanding.\r\n\r\nIn the calling of the States-General of France, the first thing that\r\nstruck me was a great departure from the ancient course. I found the\r\nrepresentation for the third estate composed of six hundred persons.\r\nThey were equal in number to the representatives of both the other\r\norders. If the orders were to act separately, the number would not,\r\nbeyond the consideration of the expense, be of much moment. But when it\r\nbecame apparent that the three orders were to be melted down into one,\r\nthe policy and necessary effect of this numerous representation became\r\nobvious. A very small desertion from either of the other two orders\r\nmust throw the power of both into the hands of the third. In fact, the\r\nwhole power of the state was soon resolved into that body. Its due\r\ncomposition became, therefore, of infinitely the greater importance.\r\n\r\nJudge, Sir, of my surprise, when I found that a very great proportion of\r\nthe Assembly (a majority, I believe, of the members who attended) was\r\ncomposed of practitioners in the law. It was composed, not of\r\ndistinguished magistrates, who had given pledges to their country of\r\ntheir science, prudence, and integrity,--not of leading advocates, the\r\nglory of the bar,--not of renowned professors in universities,--but for\r\nthe far greater part, as it must in such a number, of the inferior,\r\nunlearned, mechanical, merely instrumental members of the profession.\r\nThere were distinguished exceptions; but the general composition was of\r\nobscure provincial advocates, of stewards of petty local jurisdictions,\r\ncountry attorneys, notaries, and the whole train of the ministers of\r\nmunicipal litigation, the fomenters and conductors of the petty war of\r\nvillage vexation. From the moment I read the list, I saw distinctly, and\r\nvery nearly as it has happened, all that was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe degree of estimation in which any profession is held becomes the\r\nstandard of the estimation in which the professors hold themselves.\r\nWhatever the personal merits of many individual lawyers might have been,\r\n(and in many it was undoubtedly very considerable,) in that military\r\nkingdom no part of the profession had been much regarded, except the\r\nhighest of all, who often united to their professional offices great\r\nfamily splendor, and were invested with great power and authority. These\r\ncertainly were highly respected, and even with no small degree of awe.\r\nThe next rank was not much esteemed; the mechanical part was in a very\r\nlow degree of repute.\r\n\r\nWhenever the supreme authority is vested in a body so composed, it must\r\nevidently produce the consequences of supreme authority placed in the\r\nhands of men not taught habitually to respect themselves,--who had no\r\nprevious fortune in character at stake,--who could not be expected to\r\nbear with moderation or to conduct with discretion a power which they\r\nthemselves, more than any others, must be surprised to find in their\r\nhands. Who could flatter himself that these men, suddenly, and as it\r\nwere by enchantment, snatched from the humblest rank of subordination,\r\nwould not be intoxicated with their unprepared greatness? Who could\r\nconceive that men who are habitually meddling, daring, subtle, active,\r\nof litigious dispositions and unquiet minds, would easily fall back into\r\ntheir old condition of obscure contention, and laborious, low, and\r\nunprofitable chicane? Who could doubt but that, at any expense to the\r\nstate, of which they understood nothing, they must pursue their private\r\ninterests, which they understood but too well? It was not an event\r\ndepending on chance or contingency. It was inevitable; it was necessary;\r\nit was planted in the nature of things. They must _join_ (if their\r\ncapacity did not permit them to _lead_) in any project which could\r\nprocure to them a _litigious constitution_,--which could lay open to\r\nthem those innumerable lucrative jobs which follow in the train of all\r\ngreat convulsions and revolutions in the state, and particularly in all\r\ngreat and violent permutations of property. Was it to be expected that\r\nthey would attend to the stability of property, whose existence had\r\nalways depended upon whatever rendered property questionable, ambiguous,\r\nand insecure? Their objects would be enlarged with their elevation; but\r\ntheir disposition, and habits, and mode of accomplishing their designs\r\nmust remain the same.\r\n\r\nWell! but these men were to be tempered and restrained by other\r\ndescriptions, of more sober minds and more enlarged understandings. Were\r\nthey, then, to be awed by the supereminent authority and awful dignity\r\nof a handful of country clowns, who have seats in that assembly, some of\r\nwhom are said not to be able to read and write,--and by not a greater\r\nnumber of traders, who, though somewhat more instructed, and more\r\nconspicuous in the order of society, had never known anything beyond\r\ntheir counting-house? No! both these descriptions were more formed to be\r\noverborne and swayed by the intrigues and artifices of lawyers than to\r\nbecome their counterpoise. With such a dangerous disproportion, the\r\nwhole must needs be governed by them.\r\n\r\nTo the faculty of law was joined a pretty considerable proportion of the\r\nfaculty of medicine. This faculty had not, any more than that of the\r\nlaw, possessed in France its just estimation. Its professors, therefore,\r\nmust have the qualities of men not habituated to sentiments of dignity.\r\nBut supposing they had ranked as they ought to do, and as with us they\r\ndo actually, the sides of sick-beds are not the academies for forming\r\nstatesmen and legislators. Then came the dealers in stocks and funds,\r\nwho must be eager, at any expense, to change their ideal paper wealth\r\nfor the more solid substance of land. To these were joined men of other\r\ndescriptions, from whom as little knowledge of or attention to the\r\ninterests of a great state was to be expected, and as little regard to\r\nthe stability of any institution,--men formed to be instruments, not\r\ncontrols.--Such, in general, was the composition of the _Tiers État_ in\r\nthe National Assembly; in which was scarcely to be perceived the\r\nslightest traces of what we call the natural landed interest of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe know that the British House of Commons, without shutting its doors to\r\nany merit in any class, is, by the sure operation of adequate causes,\r\nfilled with everything illustrious in rank, in descent, in hereditary\r\nand in acquired opulence, in cultivated talents, in military, civil,\r\nnaval, and politic distinction, that the country can afford. But\r\nsupposing, what hardly can be supposed as a case, that the House of\r\nCommons should be composed in the same manner with the _Tiers État_ in\r\nFrance,--would this dominion of chicane be borne with patience, or even\r\nconceived without horror? God forbid I should insinuate anything\r\nderogatory to that profession which is another priesthood, administering\r\nthe rights of sacred justice! But whilst I revere men in the functions\r\nwhich belong to them, and would do as much as one man can do to prevent\r\ntheir exclusion from any, I cannot, to flatter them, give the lie to\r\nNature. They are good and useful in the composition; they must be\r\nmischievous, if they preponderate so as virtually to become the whole.\r\nTheir very excellence in their peculiar functions may be far from a\r\nqualification for others. It cannot escape observation, that, when men\r\nare too much confined to professional and faculty habits, and, as it\r\nwere, inveterate in the recurrent employment of that narrow circle, they\r\nare rather disabled than qualified for whatever depends on the\r\nknowledge of mankind, on experience in mixed affairs, on a\r\ncomprehensive, connected view of the various, complicated, external, and\r\ninternal interests which go to the formation of that multifarious thing\r\ncalled a State.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if the House of Commons were to have an wholly professional\r\nand faculty composition, what is the power of the House of Commons,\r\ncircumscribed and shut in by the immovable barriers of laws, usages,\r\npositive rules of doctrine and practice, counterpoised by the House of\r\nLords, and every moment of its existence at the discretion of the crown\r\nto continue, prorogue, or dissolve us? The power of the House of\r\nCommons, direct or indirect, is, indeed, great: and long may it be able\r\nto preserve its greatness, and the spirit belonging to true greatness,\r\nat the full!--and it will do so, as long as it can keep the breakers of\r\nlaw in India from becoming the makers of law for England. The power,\r\nhowever, of the House of Commons, when least diminished, is as a drop of\r\nwater in the ocean, compared to that residing in a settled majority of\r\nyour National Assembly. That assembly, since the destruction of the\r\norders, has no fundamental law, no strict convention, no respected usage\r\nto restrain it. Instead of finding themselves obliged to conform to a\r\nfixed constitution, they have a power to make a constitution which shall\r\nconform to their designs. Nothing in heaven or upon earth can serve as a\r\ncontrol on them. What ought to be the heads, the hearts, the\r\ndispositions, that are qualified, or that dare, not only to make laws\r\nunder a fixed constitution, but at one heat to strike out a totally new\r\nconstitution for a great kingdom, and in every part of it, from the\r\nmonarch on the throne to the vestry of a parish? But\r\n\r\n    \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a state of unbounded power, for undefined and undefinable\r\npurposes, the evil of a moral and almost physical inaptitude of the man\r\nto the function must be the greatest we can conceive to happen in the\r\nmanagement of human affairs.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the composition of the third estate, as it stood in\r\nits original frame, I took a view of the representatives of the clergy.\r\nThere, too, it appeared that full as little regard was had to the\r\ngeneral security of property, or to the aptitude of the deputies for\r\ntheir public purposes, in the principles of their election. That\r\nelection was so contrived as to send a very large proportion of mere\r\ncountry curates to the great and arduous work of new-modelling a state:\r\nmen who never had seen the state so much as in a picture; men who knew\r\nnothing of the world beyond the bounds of an obscure village; who,\r\nimmersed in hopeless poverty, could regard all property, whether secular\r\nor ecclesiastical, with no other eye than that of envy; among whom must\r\nbe many who, for the smallest hope of the meanest dividend in plunder,\r\nwould readily join in any attempts upon a body of wealth in which they\r\ncould hardly look to have any share, except in a general scramble.\r\nInstead of balancing the power of the active chicaners in the other\r\nassembly, these curates must necessarily become the active coadjutors,\r\nor at best the passive instruments, of those by whom they had been\r\nhabitually guided in their petty village concerns. They, too, could\r\nhardly be the most conscientious of their kind, who, presuming upon\r\ntheir incompetent understanding, could intrigue for a trust which led\r\nthem from their natural relation to their flocks, and their natural\r\nspheres of action, to undertake the regeneration of kingdoms. This\r\npreponderating weight, being added to the force of the body of chicane\r\nin the _Tiers État_, completed that momentum of ignorance, rashness,\r\npresumption, and lust of plunder, which nothing has been able to resist.\r\n\r\nTo observing men it must have appeared from the beginning, that the\r\nmajority of the third estate, in conjunction with such a deputation from\r\nthe clergy as I have described, whilst it pursued the destruction of the\r\nnobility, would inevitably become subservient to the worst designs of\r\nindividuals in that class. In the spoil and humiliation of their own\r\norder these individuals would possess a sure fund for the pay of their\r\nnew followers. To squander away the objects which made the happiness of\r\ntheir fellows would be to them no sacrifice at all. Turbulent,\r\ndiscontented men of quality, in proportion as they are puffed up with\r\npersonal pride and arrogance, generally despise their own order. One of\r\nthe first symptoms they discover of a selfish and mischievous ambition\r\nis a profligate disregard of a dignity which they partake with others.\r\nTo be attached to the subdivision, to love the little platoon we belong\r\nto in society, is the first principle (the germ, as it were) of public\r\naffections. It is the first link in the series by which we proceed\r\ntowards a love to our country and to mankind. The interest of that\r\nportion of social arrangement is a trust in the hands of all those who\r\ncompose it; and as none but bad men would justify it in abuse, none but\r\ntraitors would barter it away for their own personal advantage.\r\n\r\nThere were, in the time of our civil troubles in England, (I do not know\r\nwhether you have any such in your Assembly in France,) several persons,\r\nlike the then Earl of Holland, who by themselves or their families had\r\nbrought an odium on the throne by the prodigal dispensation of its\r\nbounties towards them, who afterwards joined in the rebellions arising\r\nfrom the discontents of which they were themselves the cause: men who\r\nhelped to subvert that throne to which they owed, some of them, their\r\nexistence, others all that power which they employed to ruin their\r\nbenefactor. If any bounds are set to the rapacious demands of that sort\r\nof people, or that others are permitted to partake in the objects they\r\nwould engross, revenge and envy soon fill up the craving void that is\r\nleft in their avarice. Confounded by the complication of distempered\r\npassions, their reason is disturbed; their views become vast and\r\nperplexed,--to others inexplicable, to themselves uncertain. They find,\r\non all sides, bounds to their unprincipled ambition in any fixed order\r\nof things; but in the fog and haze of confusion all is enlarged, and\r\nappears without any limit.\r\n\r\nWhen men of rank sacrifice all ideas of dignity to an ambition without a\r\ndistinct object, and work with low instruments and for low ends, the\r\nwhole composition becomes low and base. Does not something like this now\r\nappear in France? Does it not produce something ignoble and inglorious:\r\na kind of meanness in all the prevalent policy; a tendency in all that\r\nis done to lower along with individuals all the dignity and importance\r\nof the state? Other revolutions have been conducted by persons who,\r\nwhilst they attempted or affected changes in the commonwealth,\r\nsanctified their ambition by advancing the dignity of the people whose\r\npeace they troubled. They had long views. They aimed at the rule, not at\r\nthe destruction of their country. They were men of great civil and great\r\nmilitary talents, and if the terror, the ornament of their age. They\r\nwere not like Jew brokers contending with each other who could best\r\nremedy with fraudulent circulation and depreciated paper the\r\nwretchedness and ruin brought on their country by their degenerate\r\ncouncils. The compliment made to one of the great bad men of the old\r\nstamp (Cromwell) by his kinsman, a favorite poet of that time, shows\r\nwhat it was he proposed, and what indeed to a great degree he\r\naccomplished in the success of his ambition:--\r\n\r\n    \"Still as _you_ rise, the _state_, exalted too,\r\n    Finds no distemper whilst 't is changed by _you_;\r\n    Changed like the world's great scene, when without noise\r\n    The rising sun night's _vulgar_ lights destroys.\"\r\n\r\nThese disturbers were not so much like men usurping power as asserting\r\ntheir natural place in society. Their rising was to illuminate and\r\nbeautify the world. Their conquest over their competitors was by\r\noutshining them. The hand, that, like a destroying angel, smote the\r\ncountry, communicated to it the force and energy under which it\r\nsuffered. I do not say, (God forbid!) I do not say that the virtues of\r\nsuch men were to be taken as a balance to their crimes; but they were\r\nsome corrective to their effects. Such was, as I said, our Cromwell.\r\nSuch were your whole race of Guises, Condés, and Colignys. Such the\r\nRichelieus, who in more quiet times acted in the spirit of a civil war.\r\nSuch, as better men, and in a less dubious cause, were your Henry the\r\nFourth, and your Sully, though nursed in civil confusions, and not\r\nwholly without some of their taint. It is a thing to be wondered at, to\r\nsee how very soon France, when she had a moment to respire, recovered\r\nand emerged from the longest and most dreadful civil war that ever was\r\nknown in any nation. Why? Because, among all their massacres, they had\r\nnot slain the _mind_ in their country. A conscious dignity, a noble\r\npride, a generous sense of glory and emulation, was not extinguished. On\r\nthe contrary, it was kindled and inflamed. The organs also of the state,\r\nhowever shattered, existed. All the prizes of honor and virtue, all the\r\nrewards, all the distinctions, remained. But your present confusion,\r\nlike a palsy, has attacked the fountain of life itself. Every person in\r\nyour country, in a situation to be actuated by a principle of honor, is\r\ndisgraced and degraded, and can entertain no sensation of life, except\r\nin a mortified and humiliated indignation. But this generation will\r\nquickly pass away. The next generation of the nobility will resemble the\r\nartificers and clowns, and money-jobbers, usurers, and Jews, who will be\r\nalways their fellows, sometimes their masters. Believe me, Sir, those\r\nwho attempt to level never equalize. In all societies consisting of\r\nvarious descriptions of citizens, some description must be uppermost.\r\nThe levellers, therefore, only change and pervert the natural order of\r\nthings: they load the edifice of society by setting up in the air what\r\nthe solidity of the structure requires to be on the ground. The\r\nassociations of tailors and carpenters, of which the republic (of Paris,\r\nfor instance) is composed, cannot be equal to the situation into which,\r\nby the worst of usurpations, an usurpation on the prerogatives of\r\nNature, you attempt to force them.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of France, at the opening of the States, said, in a tone\r\nof oratorial flourish, that all occupations were honorable. If he meant\r\nonly that no honest employment was disgraceful, he would not have gone\r\nbeyond the truth. But in asserting that anything is honorable, we imply\r\nsome distinction in its favor. The occupation of a hair-dresser, or of a\r\nworking tallow-chandler, cannot be a matter of honor to any person,--to\r\nsay nothing of a number of other more servile employments. Such\r\ndescriptions of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state; but\r\nthe state suffers oppression, if such as they, either individually or\r\ncollectively, are permitted to rule. In this you think you are combating\r\nprejudice, but you are at war with Nature.[86]\r\n\r\nI do not, my dear Sir, conceive you to be of that sophistical, captious\r\nspirit, or of that uncandid dullness, as to require, for every general\r\nobservation or sentiment, an explicit detail of the correctives and\r\nexceptions which reason will presume to be included in all the general\r\npropositions which come from reasonable men. You do not imagine that I\r\nwish to confine power, authority, and distinction to blood and names and\r\ntitles. No, Sir. There is no qualification for government but virtue and\r\nwisdom, actual or presumptive. Wherever they are actually found, they\r\nhave, in whatever state, condition, profession, or trade, the passport\r\nof Heaven to human place and honor. Woe to the country which would madly\r\nand impiously reject the service of the talents and virtues, civil,\r\nmilitary, or religious, that are given to grace and to serve it; and\r\nwould condemn to obscurity everything formed to diffuse lustre and glory\r\naround a state! Woe to that country, too, that, passing into the\r\nopposite extreme, considers a low education, a mean, contracted view of\r\nthings, a sordid, mercenary occupation, as a preferable title to\r\ncommand! Everything ought to be open,--but not indifferently to every\r\nman. No rotation, no appointment by lot, no mode of election operating\r\nin the spirit of sortition or rotation, can be generally good in a\r\ngovernment conversant in extensive objects; because they have no\r\ntendency, direct or indirect, to select the man with a view to the duty,\r\nor to accommodate the one to the other. I do not hesitate to say that\r\nthe road to eminence and power, from obscure condition, ought not to be\r\nmade too easy, nor a thing too much of course. If rare merit be the\r\nrarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of\r\nprobation. The temple of honor ought to be seated on an eminence. If it\r\nbe opened through virtue, let it be remembered, too, that virtue is\r\nnever tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.\r\n\r\nNothing is a due and adequate representation of a state, that does not\r\nrepresent its ability, as well as its property. But as ability is a\r\nvigorous and active principle, and as property is sluggish, inert, and\r\ntimid, it never can be safe from the invasions of ability, unless it be,\r\nout of all proportion, predominant in the representation. It must be\r\nrepresented, too, in great masses of accumulation, or it is not rightly\r\nprotected. The characteristic essence of property, formed out of the\r\ncombined principles of its acquisition and conservation, is to be\r\n_unequal_. The great masses, therefore, which excite envy, and tempt\r\nrapacity, must be put out of the possibility of danger. Then they form a\r\nnatural rampart about the lesser properties in all their gradations. The\r\nsame quantity of property which is by the natural course of things\r\ndivided among many has not the same operation. Its defensive power is\r\nweakened as it is diffused. In this diffusion each man's portion is less\r\nthan what, in the eagerness of his desires, he may flatter himself to\r\nobtain by dissipating the accumulations of others. The plunder of the\r\nfew would, indeed, give but a share inconceivably small in the\r\ndistribution to the many. But the many are not capable of making this\r\ncalculation; and those who lead them to rapine never intend this\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the\r\nmost valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that\r\nwhich tends the most to the perpetuation of society itself. It makes our\r\nweakness subservient to our virtue; it grafts benevolence even upon\r\navarice. The possessors of family wealth, and of the distinction which\r\nattends hereditary possession, (as most concerned in it,) are the\r\nnatural securities for this transmission. With us the House of Peers is\r\nformed upon this principle. It is wholly composed of hereditary\r\nproperty and hereditary distinction, and made, therefore, the third of\r\nthe legislature, and, in the last event, the sole judge of all property\r\nin all its subdivisions. The House of Commons, too, though not\r\nnecessarily, yet in fact, is always so composed, in the far greater\r\npart. Let those large proprietors be what they will, (and they have\r\ntheir chance of being amongst the best,) they are, at the very worst,\r\nthe ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth. For though hereditary\r\nwealth, and the rank which goes with it, are too much idolized by\r\ncreeping sycophants, and the blind, abject admirers of power, they are\r\ntoo rashly slighted in shallow speculations of the petulant, assuming,\r\nshort-sighted coxcombs of philosophy. Some decent, regulated\r\npreëminence, some preference (not exclusive appropriation) given to\r\nbirth, is neither unnatural, nor unjust, nor impolitic.\r\n\r\nIt is said that twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred\r\nthousand. True; if the constitution of a kingdom be a problem of\r\narithmetic. This sort of discourse does well enough with the lamp-post\r\nfor its second: to men who _may_ reason calmly it is ridiculous The will\r\nof the many, and their interest, must very often differ; and great will\r\nbe the difference when they make an evil choice. A government of five\r\nhundred country attorneys and obscure curates is not good for\r\ntwenty-four millions of men, though it were chosen by eight-and-forty\r\nmillions; nor is it the better for being guided by a dozen of persons of\r\nquality who have betrayed their trust in order to obtain that power. At\r\npresent, you seem in everything to have strayed out of the high road of\r\nNature. The property of France does not govern it. Of course property\r\nis destroyed, and rational liberty has no existence. All you have got\r\nfor the present is a paper circulation, and a stock-jobbing\r\nconstitution: and as to the future, do you seriously think that the\r\nterritory of France, upon the republican system of eighty-three\r\nindependent municipalities, (to say nothing of the parts that compose\r\nthem,) can ever be governed as one body, or can ever be set in motion by\r\nthe impulse of one mind? When the National Assembly has completed its\r\nwork, it will have accomplished its ruin. These commonwealths will not\r\nlong bear a state of subjection to the republic of Paris. They will not\r\nbear that this one body should monopolize the captivity of the king, and\r\nthe dominion over the assembly calling itself national. Each will keep\r\nits own portion of the spoil of the Church to itself; and it will not\r\nsuffer either that spoil, or the more just fruits of their industry, or\r\nthe natural produce of their soil, to be sent to swell the insolence or\r\npamper the luxury of the mechanics of Paris. In this they will see none\r\nof the equality, under the pretence of which they have been tempted to\r\nthrow off their allegiance to their sovereign, as well as the ancient\r\nconstitution of their country. There can be no capital city in such a\r\nconstitution as they have lately made. They have forgot, that, when they\r\nframed democratic governments, they had virtually dismembered their\r\ncountry. The person whom they persevere in calling king has not power\r\nleft to him by the hundredth part sufficient to hold together this\r\ncollection of republics. The republic of Paris will endeavor, indeed, to\r\ncomplete the debauchery of the army, and illegally to perpetuate the\r\nAssembly, without resort to its constituents, as the means of\r\ncontinuing its despotism. It will make efforts, by becoming the heart\r\nof a boundless paper circulation, to draw everything to itself: but in\r\nvain. All this policy in the end will appear as feeble as it is now\r\nviolent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this be your actual situation, compared to the situation to which you\r\nwere called, as it were by the voice of God and man, I cannot find it in\r\nmy heart to congratulate you on the choice you have made, or the success\r\nwhich has attended your endeavors. I can as little recommend to any\r\nother nation a conduct grounded on such principles and productive of\r\nsuch effects. That I must leave to those who can see further into your\r\naffairs than I am able to do, and who best know how far your actions are\r\nfavorable to their designs. The gentlemen of the Revolution Society, who\r\nwere so early in their congratulations, appear to be strongly of opinion\r\nthat there is some scheme of politics relative to this country, in which\r\nyour proceedings may in some way be useful. For your Dr. Price, who\r\nseems to have speculated himself into no small degree of fervor upon\r\nthis subject, addresses his auditors in the following very remarkable\r\nwords:--\"I cannot conclude without recalling _particularly_ to your\r\nrecollection a consideration which I have _more than once alluded to_,\r\nand which probably your thoughts have _been all along anticipating_; a\r\nconsideration with which _my mind is impressed more than can express_: I\r\nmean the consideration of the _favorableness of the present times to all\r\nexertions in the cause of liberty_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the mind of this _political_ preacher was at the time\r\nbig with some extraordinary design; and it is very probable that the\r\nthoughts of his audience, who understood him better than I do, did all\r\nalong run before him in his reflection, and in the whole train of\r\nconsequences to which it led.\r\n\r\nBefore I read that sermon, I really thought I had lived in a free\r\ncountry; and it was an error I cherished, because it gave me a greater\r\nliking to the country I lived in. I was, indeed, aware that a jealous,\r\never-waking vigilance, to guard the treasure of our liberty, not only\r\nfrom invasion, but from decay and corruption, was our best wisdom and\r\nour first duty. However, I considered that treasure rather as a\r\npossession to be secured than as a prize to be contended for. I did not\r\ndiscern how the present time came to be so very favorable to all\r\n_exertions_ in the cause of freedom. The present time differs from any\r\nother only by the circumstance of what is doing in France. If the\r\nexample of that nation is to have an influence on this, I can easily\r\nconceive why some of their proceedings which have an unpleasant aspect,\r\nand are not quite reconcilable to humanity, generosity, good faith, and\r\njustice, are palliated with so much milky good-nature towards the\r\nactors, and borne with so much heroic fortitude towards the sufferers.\r\nIt is certainly not prudent to discredit the authority of an example we\r\nmean to follow. But allowing this, we are led to a very natural\r\nquestion:--What is that cause of liberty, and what are those exertions\r\nin its favor, to which the example of France is so singularly\r\nauspicious? Is our monarchy to be annihilated, with all the laws, all\r\nthe tribunals, and all the ancient corporations of the kingdom? Is every\r\nlandmark of the country to be done away in favor of a geometrical and\r\narithmetical constitution? Is the House of Lords to be voted useless?\r\nIs Episcopacy to be abolished? Are the Church lands to be sold to Jews\r\nand jobbers, or given to bribe new-invented municipal republics into a\r\nparticipation in sacrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances,\r\nand the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic\r\npresents? Are silver shoe-buckles to be substituted in the place of the\r\nland-tax and the malt-tax, for the support of the naval strength of this\r\nkingdom? Are all orders, ranks, and distinctions to be confounded, that\r\nout of universal anarchy, joined to national bankruptcy, three or four\r\nthousand democracies should be formed into eighty-three, and that they\r\nmay all, by some sort of unknown attractive power, be organized into\r\none? For this great end is the army to be seduced from its discipline\r\nand its fidelity, first by every kind of debauchery, and then by the\r\nterrible precedent of a donative in the increase of pay? Are the curates\r\nto be seduced from their bishops by holding out to them the delusive\r\nhope of a dole out of the spoils of their own order? Are the citizens of\r\nLondon to be drawn from their allegiance by feeding them at the expense\r\nof their fellow-subjects? Is a compulsory paper currency to be\r\nsubstituted in the place of the legal coin of this kingdom? Is what\r\nremains of the plundered stock of public revenue to be employed in the\r\nwild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with\r\neach other? If these are the ends and means of the Revolution Society, I\r\nadmit they are well assorted; and France may furnish them for both with\r\nprecedents in point.\r\n\r\nI see that your example is held out to shame us. I know that we are\r\nsupposed a dull, sluggish race, rendered passive by finding our\r\nsituation tolerable, and prevented by a mediocrity of freedom from ever\r\nattaining to its full perfection. Your leaders in France began by\r\naffecting to admire, almost to adore, the British Constitution; but as\r\nthey advanced, they came to look upon it with a sovereign contempt. The\r\nfriends of your National Assembly amongst us have full as mean an\r\nopinion of what was formerly thought the glory of their country. The\r\nRevolution Society has discovered that the English nation is not free.\r\nThey are convinced that the inequality in our representation is a\r\n\"defect in our Constitution _so gross and palpable_ as to make it\r\nexcellent chiefly in _form_ and _theory_\";[87]--that a representation in\r\nthe legislature of a kingdom is not only the basis of all constitutional\r\nliberty in it, but of \"_all legitimate government_; that without it a\r\n_government_ is nothing but an _usurpation_\";--that, \"when the\r\nrepresentation is _partial_, the kingdom possesses liberty only\r\n_partially_; and if extremely partial, it gives only a _semblance_; and\r\nif not only extremely partial, but corruptly chosen, it becomes a\r\n_nuisance_.\" Dr. Price considers this inadequacy of representation as\r\nour _fundamental grievance_; and though, as to the corruption of this\r\nsemblance of representation, he hopes it is not yet arrived to its full\r\nperfection of depravity, he fears that \"nothing will be done towards\r\ngaining for us this _essential blessing_, until some _great abuse of\r\npower_ again provokes our resentment, or some _great calamity_ again\r\nalarms our fears, or perhaps till the acquisition of a _pure and equal\r\nrepresentation by other countries,_ whilst we are _mocked_ with the\r\n_shadow_, kindles our shame.\" To this he subjoins a note in these\r\nwords:--\"A representation chosen chiefly by the Treasury, and a _few_\r\nthousands of the _dregs_ of the people, who are generally paid for their\r\nvotes.\"\r\n\r\nYou will smile here at the consistency of those democratists who, when\r\nthey are not on their guard, treat the humbler part of the community\r\nwith the greatest contempt, whilst, at the same time, they pretend to\r\nmake them the depositories of all power. It would require a long\r\ndiscourse to point out to you the many fallacies that lurk in the\r\ngenerality and equivocal nature of the terms \"inadequate\r\nrepresentation.\" I shall only say here, in justice to that old-fashioned\r\nConstitution under which we have long prospered, that our representation\r\nhas been found perfectly adequate to all the purposes for which a\r\nrepresentation of the people can be desired or devised. I defy the\r\nenemies of our Constitution to show the contrary. To detail the\r\nparticulars in which it is found so well to promote its ends would\r\ndemand a treatise on our practical Constitution. I state here the\r\ndoctrine of the revolutionists, only that you and others may see what an\r\nopinion these gentlemen entertain of the Constitution of their country,\r\nand why they seem to think that some great abuse of power, or some great\r\ncalamity, as giving a chance for the blessing of a Constitution\r\naccording to their ideas, would be much palliated to their feelings; you\r\nsee _why they_ are so much enamored of your fair and equal\r\nrepresentation, which being once obtained, the same effects might\r\nfollow. You see they consider our House of Commons as only \"a\r\nsemblance,\" \"a form,\" \"a theory,\" \"a shadow,\" \"a mockery,\" perhaps \"a\r\nnuisance.\"\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen value themselves on being systematic, and not without\r\nreason. They must therefore look on this gross and palpable defect of\r\nrepresentation, this fundamental grievance, (so they call it,) as a\r\nthing not only vicious in itself, but as rendering our whole government\r\nabsolutely _illegitimate_, and not at all better than a downright\r\n_usurpation_. Another revolution, to get rid of this illegitimate and\r\nusurped government, would of course be perfectly justifiable, if not\r\nabsolutely necessary. Indeed, their principle, if you observe it with\r\nany attention, goes much further than to an alteration in the election\r\nof the House of Commons; for, if popular representation, or choice, is\r\nnecessary to the _legitimacy_ of all government, the House of Lords is,\r\nat one stroke, bastardized and corrupted in blood. That House is no\r\nrepresentative of the people at all, even in \"semblance\" or \"in form.\"\r\nThe case of the crown is altogether as bad. In vain the crown may\r\nendeavor to screen itself against these gentlemen by the authority of\r\nthe establishment made on the Revolution. The Revolution, which is\r\nresorted to for a title, on their system, wants a title itself. The\r\nRevolution is built, according to their theory, upon a basis not more\r\nsolid than our present formalities, as it was made by a House of Lords\r\nnot representing any one but themselves, and by a House of Commons\r\nexactly such as the present, that is, as they term it, by a mere \"shadow\r\nand mockery\" of representation.\r\n\r\nSomething they must destroy, or they seem to themselves to exist for no\r\npurpose. One set is for destroying the civil power through the\r\necclesiastical; another for demolishing the ecclesiastic through the\r\ncivil. They are aware that the worst consequences might happen to the\r\npublic in accomplishing this double ruin of Church and State; but they\r\nare so heated with their theories, that they give more than hints that\r\nthis ruin, with all the mischiefs that must lead to it and attend it,\r\nand which to themselves appear quite certain, would not be unacceptable\r\nto them, or very remote from their wishes. A man amongst them of great\r\nauthority, and certainly of great talents, speaking of a supposed\r\nalliance between Church and State, says, \"Perhaps _we must wait for the\r\nfall of the civil powers_, before this most unnatural alliance be\r\nbroken. Calamitous, no doubt, will that time be. But what convulsion in\r\nthe political world ought to be a subject of lamentation, if it be\r\nattended with so desirable an effect?\" You see with what a steady eye\r\nthese gentlemen are prepared to view the greatest calamities which can\r\nbefall their country!\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that, with these ideas of everything in\r\ntheir Constitution and government at home, either in Church or State, as\r\nillegitimate and usurped, or at best as a vain mockery, they look abroad\r\nwith an eager and passionate enthusiasm. Whilst they are possessed by\r\nthese notions, it is vain to talk to them of the practice of their\r\nancestors, the fundamental laws of their country, the fixed form of a\r\nConstitution whose merits are confirmed by the solid test of long\r\nexperience and an increasing public strength and national prosperity.\r\nThey despise experience as the wisdom of unlettered men; and as for the\r\nrest, they have wrought under ground a mine that will blow up, at one\r\ngrand explosion, all examples of antiquity, all precedents, charters,\r\nand acts of Parliament. They have \"the rights of men.\" Against these\r\nthere can be no prescription; against these no argument is binding:\r\nthese admit no temperament and no compromise: anything withheld from\r\ntheir full demand is so much of fraud and injustice. Against these their\r\nrights of men let no government look for security in the length of its\r\ncontinuance, or in the justice and lenity of its administration. The\r\nobjections of these speculatists, if its forms do not quadrate with\r\ntheir theories, are as valid against such an old and beneficent\r\ngovernment as against the most violent tyranny or the greenest\r\nusurpation. They are always at issue with governments, not on a question\r\nof abuse, but a question of competency and a question of title. I have\r\nnothing to say to the clumsy subtilty of their political metaphysics.\r\nLet them be their amusement in the schools.\r\n\r\n        _Illa_ se jactet in aula\r\n    Æolus, et clauso ventorum carcere regnet.\r\n\r\nBut let them not break prison to burst like a Levanter, to sweep the\r\nearth with their hurricane, and to break up the fountains of the great\r\ndeep to overwhelm us!\r\n\r\nFar am I from denying in theory, full as far is my heart from\r\nwithholding in practice, (if I were of power to give or to withhold,)\r\nthe _real_ rights of men. In denying their false claims of right, I do\r\nnot mean to injure those which are real, and are such as their pretended\r\nrights would totally destroy. If civil society be made for the advantage\r\nof man, all the advantages for which it is made become his right. It is\r\nan institution of beneficence; and law itself is only beneficence acting\r\nby a rule. Men have a right to live by that rule; they have a right to\r\njustice, as between their fellows, whether their fellows are in politic\r\nfunction or in ordinary occupation. They have a right to the fruits of\r\ntheir industry, and to the means of making their industry fruitful.\r\nThey have a right to the acquisitions of their parents, to the\r\nnourishment and improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life\r\nand to consolation in death. Whatever each man can separately do,\r\nwithout trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and\r\nhe has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its\r\ncombinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this\r\npartnership all men have equal rights; but not to equal things. He that\r\nhas but five shillings in the partnership has as good a right to it as\r\nhe that has five hundred pounds has to his larger proportion; but he has\r\nnot a right to an equal dividend in the product of the joint stock. And\r\nas to the share of power, authority, and direction which each individual\r\nought to have in the management of the state, that I must deny to be\r\namongst the direct original rights of man in civil society; for I have\r\nin my contemplation the civil social man, and no other. It is a thing to\r\nbe settled by convention.\r\n\r\nIf civil society be the offspring of convention, that convention must be\r\nits law. That convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of\r\nconstitution which are formed under it. Every sort of legislative,\r\njudicial, or executory power are its creatures. They can have no being\r\nin any other state of things; and how can any man claim, under the\r\nconventions of civil society, rights which do not so much as suppose its\r\nexistence,--rights which are absolutely repugnant to it? One of the\r\nfirst motives to civil society, and which becomes one of its fundamental\r\nrules, is, _that no man should be judge in his own cause_. By this each\r\nperson has at once divested himself of the first fundamental right of\r\nuncovenanted man, that is, to judge for himself, and to assert his own\r\ncause. He abdicates all right to be his own governor. He inclusively, in\r\na great measure, abandons the right of self-defence, the first law of\r\nNature. Men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state\r\ntogether. That he may obtain justice, he gives up his right of\r\ndetermining what it is in points the most essential to him. That he may\r\nsecure some liberty, he makes a surrender in trust of the whole of it.\r\n\r\nGovernment is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do\r\nexist in total independence of it,--and exist in much greater clearness,\r\nand in a much greater degree of abstract perfection: but their abstract\r\nperfection is their practical defect. By having a right to everything\r\nthey want everything. Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to\r\nprovide for human _wants_. Men have a right that these wants should be\r\nprovided for by this wisdom. Among these wants is to be reckoned the\r\nwant, out of civil society, of a sufficient restraint upon their\r\npassions. Society requires not only that the passions of individuals\r\nshould be subjected, but that even in the mass and body, as well as in\r\nthe individuals, the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted,\r\ntheir will controlled, and their passions brought into subjection. This\r\ncan only be done _by a power out of themselves_, and not, in the\r\nexercise of its function, subject to that will and to those passions\r\nwhich it is its office to bridle and subdue. In this sense the\r\nrestraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among\r\ntheir rights. But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times\r\nand circumstances, and admit of infinite modifications, they cannot be\r\nsettled upon any abstract rule; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss\r\nthem upon that principle.\r\n\r\nThe moment you abate anything from the full rights of men each to govern\r\nhimself, and suffer any artificial, positive limitation upon those\r\nrights, from that moment the whole organization of government becomes a\r\nconsideration of convenience. This it is which makes the constitution of\r\na state, and the due distribution of its powers, a matter of the most\r\ndelicate and complicated skill. It requires a deep knowledge of human\r\nnature and human necessities, and of the things which facilitate or\r\nobstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of\r\ncivil institutions. The state is to have recruits to its strength and\r\nremedies to its distempers. What is the use of discussing a man's\r\nabstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of\r\nprocuring and administering them. In that deliberation I shall always\r\nadvise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician, rather than\r\nthe professor of metaphysics.\r\n\r\nThe science of constructing a commonwealth, or renovating it, or\r\nreforming it, is, like every other experimental science, not to be\r\ntaught _a priori_. Nor is it a short experience that can instruct us in\r\nthat practical science; because the real effects of moral causes are not\r\nalways immediate, but that which in the first instance is prejudicial\r\nmay be excellent in its remoter operation, and its excellence may arise\r\neven from the ill effects it produces in the beginning. The reverse also\r\nhappens; and very plausible schemes, with very pleasing commencements,\r\nhave often shameful and lamentable conclusions. In states there are\r\noften some obscure and almost latent causes, things which appear at\r\nfirst view of little moment, on which a very great part of its\r\nprosperity or adversity may most essentially depend. The science of\r\ngovernment being, therefore, so practical in itself, and intended for\r\nsuch practical purposes, a matter which requires experience, and even\r\nmore experience than any person can gain in his whole life, however\r\nsagacious and observing he may be, it is with infinite caution that any\r\nman ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice which has answered in\r\nany tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of society, or on\r\nbuilding it up again without having models and patterns of approved\r\nutility before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThese metaphysic rights entering into common life, like rays of light\r\nwhich pierce into a dense medium, are, by the laws of Nature, refracted\r\nfrom their straight line. Indeed, in the gross and complicated mass of\r\nhuman passions and concerns, the primitive rights of men undergo such a\r\nvariety of refractions and reflections that it becomes absurd to talk of\r\nthem as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction.\r\nThe nature of man is intricate; the objects of society are of the\r\ngreatest possible complexity: and therefore no simple disposition or\r\ndirection of power can be suitable either to man's nature or to the\r\nquality of his affairs. When I hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed\r\nat and boasted of in any new political constitutions, I am at no loss to\r\ndecide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their trade or\r\ntotally negligent of their duty. The simple governments are\r\nfundamentally defective, to say no worse of them. If you were to\r\ncontemplate society in but one point of view, all these simple modes of\r\npolity are infinitely captivating. In effect each would answer its\r\nsingle end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain\r\nall its complex purposes. But it is better that the whole, should be\r\nimperfectly and anomalously answered than that while some parts are\r\nprovided for with great exactness, others might be totally neglected, or\r\nperhaps materially injured, by the over-care of a favorite member.\r\n\r\nThe pretended rights of these theorists are all extremes; and in\r\nproportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and\r\npolitically false. The rights of men are in a sort of _middle_,\r\nincapable of definition, but not impossible to be discerned. The rights\r\nof men in governments are their advantages; and these are often in\r\nbalances between differences of good,--in compromises sometimes between\r\ngood and evil, and sometimes between evil and evil. Political reason is\r\na computing principle: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing,\r\nmorally, and not metaphysically or mathematically, true moral\r\ndenominations.\r\n\r\nBy these theorists the right of the people is almost always\r\nsophistically confounded with their power. The body of the community,\r\nwhenever it can come to act, can meet with no effectual resistance; but\r\ntill power and right are the same, the whole body of them has no right\r\ninconsistent with virtue, and the first of all virtues, prudence. Men\r\nhave no right to what is not reasonable, and to what is not for their\r\nbenefit; for though a pleasant writer said, \"_Liceat perire poetis_,\"\r\nwhen one of them, in cold blood, is said to have leaped into the flames\r\nof a volcanic revolution, \"_ardentem frigidus Ætnam insiluit_,\" I\r\nconsider such a frolic rather as an unjustifiable poetic license than\r\nas one of the franchises of Parnassus; and whether he were poet, or\r\ndivine, or politician, that chose to exercise this kind of right, I\r\nthink that more wise, because more charitable, thoughts would urge me\r\nrather to save the man than to preserve his brazen slippers as the\r\nmonuments of his folly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe kind of anniversary sermons to which a great part of what I write\r\nrefers, if men are not shamed out of their present course, in\r\ncommemorating the fact, will cheat many out of the principles and\r\ndeprive them of the benefits of the Revolution they commemorate. I\r\nconfess to you, Sir, I never liked this continual talk of resistance and\r\nrevolution, or the practice of making the extreme medicine of the\r\nConstitution its daily bread. It renders the habit of society\r\ndangerously valetudinary; it is taking periodical doses of mercury\r\nsublimate, and swallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides to\r\nour love of liberty.\r\n\r\nThis distemper of remedy, grown habitual, relaxes and wears out, by a\r\nvulgar and prostituted use, the spring of that spirit which is to be\r\nexerted on great occasions. It was in the most patient period of Roman\r\nservitude that themes of tyrannicide made the ordinary exercise of boys\r\nat school,--_cum perimit sævos classis numerosa tyrannos_. In the\r\nordinary state of things, it produces in a country like ours the worst\r\neffects, even on the cause of that liberty which it abuses with the\r\ndissoluteness of an extravagant speculation. Almost all the high-bred\r\nrepublicans of my time have, after a short space, become the most\r\ndecided, thorough-paced courtiers; they soon left the business of a\r\ntedious, moderate, but practical resistance, to those of us whom, in\r\nthe pride and intoxication of their theories, they have slighted as not\r\nmuch better than Tories. Hypocrisy, of course, delights in the most\r\nsublime speculations; for, never intending to go beyond speculation, it\r\ncosts nothing to have it magnificent. But even in cases where rather\r\nlevity than fraud was to be suspected in these ranting speculations, the\r\nissue has been much the same. These professors, finding their extreme\r\nprinciples not applicable to cases which call only for a qualified, or,\r\nas I may say, civil and legal resistance, in such cases employ no\r\nresistance at all. It is with them a war or a revolution, or it is\r\nnothing. Finding their schemes of politics not adapted to the state of\r\nthe world in which they live, they often come to think lightly of all\r\npublic principle, and are ready, on their part, to abandon for a very\r\ntrivial interest what they find of very trivial value. Some, indeed, are\r\nof more steady and persevering natures; but these are eager politicians\r\nout of Parliament, who have little to tempt them to abandon their\r\nfavorite projects. They have some change in the Church or State, or\r\nboth, constantly in their view. When that is the case, they are always\r\nbad citizens, and perfectly unsure connections. For, considering their\r\nspeculative designs as of infinite value, and the actual arrangement of\r\nthe state as of no estimation, they are, at best, indifferent about it.\r\nThey see no merit in the good, and no fault in the vicious management of\r\npublic affairs; they rather rejoice in the latter, as more propitious to\r\nrevolution. They see no merit or demerit in any man, or any action, or\r\nany political principle, any further than as they may forward or retard\r\ntheir design of change; they therefore take up, one day, the most\r\nviolent and stretched prerogative, and another time the wildest\r\ndemocratic ideas of freedom, and pass from the one to the other without\r\nany sort of regard to cause, to person, or to party.\r\n\r\nIn France you are now in the crisis of a revolution, and in the transit\r\nfrom one form of government to another: you cannot see that character of\r\nmen exactly in the same situation in which we see it in this country.\r\nWith us it is militant, with you it is triumphant; and you know how it\r\ncan act, when its power is commensurate to its will. I would not be\r\nsupposed to confine those observations to any description of men, or to\r\ncomprehend all men of any description within them,--no, far from it! I\r\nam as incapable of that injustice as I am of keeping terms with those\r\nwho profess principles of extremes, and who, under the name of religion,\r\nteach little else than wild and dangerous politics. The worst of these\r\npolitics of revolution is this: they temper and harden the breast, in\r\norder to prepare it for the desperate strokes which are sometimes used\r\nin extreme occasions. But as these occasions may never arrive, the mind\r\nreceives a gratuitous taint; and the moral sentiments suffer not a\r\nlittle, when no political purpose is served by the depravation. This\r\nsort of people are so taken up with their theories about the rights of\r\nman, that they have totally forgot his nature. Without opening one new\r\navenue to the understanding, they have succeeded in stopping up those\r\nthat lead to the heart. They have perverted in themselves, and in those\r\nthat attend to them, all the well-placed sympathies of the human breast.\r\n\r\nThis famous sermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but this spirit\r\nthrough all the political part. Plots, massacres, assassinations, seem\r\nto some people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution. A cheap,\r\nbloodless reformation, a guiltless liberty, appear flat and vapid to\r\ntheir taste. There must be a great change of scene; there must be a\r\nmagnificent stage effect; there must be a grand spectacle to rouse the\r\nimagination, grown torpid with the lazy enjoyment of sixty years'\r\nsecurity, and the still unanimating repose of public prosperity. The\r\npreacher found them all in the French Revolution. This inspires a\r\njuvenile warmth through his whole frame. His enthusiasm kindles as he\r\nadvances; and when he arrives at his peroration, it is in a full blaze.\r\nThen viewing, from the Pisgah of his pulpit, the free, moral, happy,\r\nflourishing, and glorious state of France, as in a bird-eye landscape of\r\na promised land, he breaks out into the following rapture:--\r\n\r\n\"What an eventful period is this! I am _thankful_ that I have lived to\r\nit; I could almost say, _Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in\r\npeace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation_.--I have lived to see a\r\n_diffusion_ of knowledge which has undermined superstition and error.--I\r\nhave lived to see _the rights of men_ better understood than ever, and\r\nnations panting for liberty which seemed to have lost the idea of it.--I\r\nhave lived to see _thirty millions of people_, indignant and resolute,\r\nspurning at slavery, and demanding liberty with an irresistible voice;\r\n_their king led in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch surrendering\r\nhimself to his subjects_.\"[88]\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed further, I have to remark that Dr. Price seems rather\r\nto overvalue the great acquisitions of light which he has obtained and\r\ndiffused in this age. The last century appears to me to have been quite\r\nas much enlightened. It had, though in a different place, a triumph as\r\nmemorable as that of Dr. Price; and some of the great preachers of that\r\nperiod partook of it as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of France.\r\nOn the trial of the Reverend Hugh Peters for high treason, it was\r\ndeposed, that, when King Charles was brought to London for his trial,\r\nthe Apostle of Liberty in that day conducted the _triumph_. \"I saw,\"\r\nsays the witness, \"his Majesty in the coach with six horses, and Peters\r\nriding before the king _triumphing_.\" Dr. Price, when he talks as if he\r\nhad made a discovery, only follows a precedent; for, after the\r\ncommencement of the king's trial, this precursor, the same Dr. Peters,\r\nconcluding a long prayer at the royal chapel at Whitehall, (he had very\r\ntriumphantly chosen his place,) said, \"I have prayed and preached these\r\ntwenty years; and now I may say with old Simeon, _Lord, now lettest thou\r\nthy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy\r\nsalvation_.\"[89] Peters had not the fruits of his prayer; for he neither\r\ndeparted so soon as he wished, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily\r\nhope none of his followers may be in this country) himself a sacrifice\r\nto the triumph which he led as pontiff. They dealt at the Restoration,\r\nperhaps, too hardly with this poor good man. But we owe it to his memory\r\nand his sufferings, that he had as much illumination and as much zeal,\r\nand had as effectually undermined all _the superstition and error_ which\r\nmight impede the great business he was engaged in, as any who follow and\r\nrepeat after him in this age, which would assume to itself an exclusive\r\ntitle to the knowledge of the rights of men, and all the glorious\r\nconsequences of that knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter this sally of the preacher of the Old Jewry, which differs only in\r\nplace and time, but agrees perfectly with the spirit and letter of the\r\nrapture of 1648, the Revolution Society, the fabricators of governments,\r\nthe heroic band of _cashierers_ of _monarchs_, electors of sovereigns,\r\nand leaders of kings in triumph, strutting with a proud consciousness of\r\nthe diffusion of knowledge, of which every member had obtained so large\r\na share in the donative, were in haste to make a generous diffusion of\r\nthe knowledge they had thus gratuitously received. To make this\r\nbountiful communication, they adjourned from the church in the Old Jewry\r\nto the London Tavern, where the same Dr. Price, in whom the fumes of his\r\noracular tripod were not entirely evaporated, moved and carried the\r\nresolution, or address of congratulation, transmitted by Lord Stanhope\r\nto the National Assembly of France.\r\n\r\nI find a preacher of the Gospel profaning the beautiful and prophetic\r\nejaculation, commonly called \"_Nunc dimittis_,\" made on the first\r\npresentation of our Saviour in the temple, and applying it, with an\r\ninhuman and unnatural rapture, to the most horrid, atrocious, and\r\nafflicting spectacle that perhaps ever was exhibited to the pity and\r\nindignation of mankind. This \"_leading in triumph_,\" a thing in its best\r\nform unmanly and irreligious, which fills our preacher with such\r\nunhallowed transports, must shock, I believe, the moral taste of every\r\nwell-born mind. Several English were the stupefied and indignant\r\nspectators of that triumph. It was (unless we have been strangely\r\ndeceived) a spectacle more resembling a procession of American savages\r\nentering into Onondaga after some of their murders called victories, and\r\nleading into hovels hung round with scalps their captives overpowered\r\nwith the scoffs and buffets of women as ferocious as themselves, much\r\nmore than it resembled the triumphal pomp of a civilized martial\r\nnation;--if a civilized nation, or any men who had a sense of\r\ngenerosity, were capable of a personal triumph over the fallen and\r\nafflicted.\r\n\r\nThis, my dear Sir, was not the triumph of France. I must believe, that,\r\nas a nation, it overwhelmed you with shame and horror. I must believe\r\nthat the National Assembly find themselves in a state of the greatest\r\nhumiliation in not being able to punish the authors of this triumph or\r\nthe actors in it, and that they are in a situation in which any inquiry\r\nthey may make upon the subject must be destitute even of the appearance\r\nof liberty or impartiality. The apology of that assembly is found in\r\ntheir situation; but when we approve what they _must_ bear, it is in us\r\nthe degenerate choice of a vitiated mind.\r\n\r\nWith a compelled appearance of deliberation, they vote under the\r\ndominion of a stern necessity. They sit in the heart, as it were, of a\r\nforeign republic: they have their residence in a city whose constitution\r\nhas emanated neither from the charter of their king nor from their\r\nlegislative power. There they are surrounded by an army not raised\r\neither by the authority of their crown or by their command, and which,\r\nif they should order to dissolve itself, would instantly dissolve them.\r\nThere they sit, after a gang of assassins had driven away some hundreds\r\nof the members; whilst those who held the same moderate principles, with\r\nmore patience or better hope, continued every day exposed to outrageous\r\ninsults and murderous threats. There a majority, sometimes real,\r\nsometimes pretended, captive itself, compels a captive king to issue as\r\nroyal edicts, at third hand, the polluted nonsense of their most\r\nlicentious and giddy coffee-houses. It is notorious that all their\r\nmeasures are decided before they are debated. It is beyond doubt, that,\r\nunder the terror of the bayonet, and the lamp-post, and the torch to\r\ntheir houses, they are obliged to adopt all the crude and desperate\r\nmeasures suggested by clubs composed of a monstrous medley of all\r\nconditions, tongues, and nations. Among these are found persons in\r\ncomparison of whom Catiline would be thought scrupulous, and Cethegus a\r\nman of sobriety and moderation. Nor is it in these clubs alone that the\r\npublic measures are deformed into monsters. They undergo a previous\r\ndistortion in academies, intended as so many seminaries for these clubs,\r\nwhich are set up in all the places of public resort. In these meetings\r\nof all sorts, every counsel, in proportion as it is daring and violent\r\nand perfidious, is taken for the mark of superior genius. Humanity and\r\ncompassion are ridiculed as the fruits of superstition and ignorance.\r\nTenderness to individuals is considered as treason to the public.\r\nLiberty is always to be estimated perfect as property is rendered\r\ninsecure. Amidst assassination, massacre, and confiscation, perpetrated\r\nor meditated, they are forming plans for the good order of future\r\nsociety. Embracing in their arms the carcasses of base criminals, and\r\npromoting their relations on the title of their offences, they drive\r\nhundreds of virtuous persons to the same end, by forcing them to subsist\r\nby beggary or by crime.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, their organ, acts before them the farce of deliberation\r\nwith as little decency as liberty. They act like the comedians of a\r\nfair, before a riotous audience; they act amidst the tumultuous cries of\r\na mixed mob of ferocious men, and of women lost to shame, who, according\r\nto their insolent fancies, direct, control, applaud, explode them, and\r\nsometimes mix and take their seats amongst them,--domineering over them\r\nwith a strange mixture of servile petulance and proud, presumptuous\r\nauthority. As they have inverted order in all things, the gallery is in\r\nthe place of the house. This assembly, which overthrows kings and\r\nkingdoms, has not even the physiognomy and aspect of a grave legislative\r\nbody,--_nec color imperii, nec frons erat ulla senatûs_. They have a\r\npower given to them, like that of the Evil Principle, to subvert and\r\ndestroy,--but none to construct, except such machines as may be fitted\r\nfor further subversion and further destruction.\r\n\r\nWho is it that admires, and from the heart is attached to national\r\nrepresentative assemblies, but must turn with horror and disgust from\r\nsuch a profane burlesque and abominable perversion of that sacred\r\ninstitute? Lovers of monarchy, lovers of republics, must alike abhor it.\r\nThe members of your Assembly must themselves groan under the tyranny of\r\nwhich they have all the shame, none of the direction, and little of the\r\nprofit. I am sure many of the members who compose even the majority of\r\nthat body must feel as I do, notwithstanding the applauses of the\r\nRevolution Society. Miserable king! miserable assembly! How must that\r\nassembly be silently scandalized with those of their members who could\r\ncall a day which seemed to blot the sun out of heaven \"_un beau\r\njour_\"![90] How must they be inwardly indignant at hearing others who\r\nthought fit to declare to them, \"that the vessel of the state would fly\r\nforward in her course towards regeneration with more speed than ever,\"\r\nfrom the stiff gale of treason and murder which preceded our preacher's\r\ntriumph! What must they have felt, whilst, with outward patience and\r\ninward indignation, they heard of the slaughter of innocent gentlemen in\r\ntheir houses, that \"the blood spilled was not the most pure\"! What must\r\nthey have felt, when they were besieged by complaints of disorders which\r\nshook their country to its foundations, at being compelled coolly to\r\ntell the complainants that they were under the protection of the law,\r\nand that they would address the king (the captive king) to cause the\r\nlaws to be enforced for their protection, when the enslaved ministers of\r\nthat captive king had formally notified to them that there were neither\r\nlaw nor authority nor power left to protect! What must they have felt at\r\nbeing obliged, as a felicitation on the present new year, to request\r\ntheir captive king to forget the stormy period of the last, on account\r\nof the great good which _he_ was likely to produce to his people,--to\r\nthe complete attainment of which good they adjourned the practical\r\ndemonstrations of their loyalty, assuring him of their obedience when he\r\nshould no longer possess any authority to command!\r\n\r\nThis address was made with much good-nature and affection, to be sure.\r\nBut among the revolutions in France must be reckoned a considerable\r\nrevolution in their ideas of politeness. In England we are said to learn\r\nmanners at second-hand from your side of the water, and that we dress\r\nour behavior in the frippery of France. If so, we are still in the old\r\ncut, and have not so far conformed to the new Parisian mode of good\r\nbreeding as to think it quite in the most refined strain of delicate\r\ncompliment (whether in condolence or congratulation) to say, to the most\r\nhumiliated creature that crawls upon the earth, that great public\r\nbenefits are derived from the murder of his servants, the attempted\r\nassassination of himself and of his wife, and the mortification,\r\ndisgrace, and degradation that he has personally suffered. It is a topic\r\nof consolation which our ordinary of Newgate would be too humane to use\r\nto a criminal at the foot of the gallows. I should have thought that the\r\nhangman of Paris, now that he is liberalized by the vote of the National\r\nAssembly, and is allowed his rank and arms in the Herald's College of\r\nthe rights of men, would be too generous, too gallant a man, too full of\r\nthe sense of his new dignity, to employ that cutting consolation to any\r\nof the persons whom the _lèze-nation_ might bring under the\r\nadministration of his _executive powers_.\r\n\r\nA man is fallen indeed, when he is thus flattered. The anodyne draught\r\nof oblivion, thus drugged, is well calculated to preserve a galling\r\nwakefulness, and to feed the living ulcer of a corroding memory. Thus to\r\nadminister the opiate potion of amnesty, powdered with all the\r\ningredients of scorn and contempt, is to hold to his lips, instead of\r\n\"the balm of hurt minds,\" the cup of human misery full to the brim, and\r\nto force him to drink it to the dregs.\r\n\r\nYielding to reasons at least as forcible as those which were so\r\ndelicately urged in the compliment on the new year, the king of France\r\nwill probably endeavor to forget these events and that compliment. But\r\nHistory, who keeps a durable record of all our acts, and exercises her\r\nawful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns, will not\r\nforget either those events, or the era of this liberal refinement in the\r\nintercourse of mankind. History will record, that, on the morning of the\r\nsixth of October, 1789, the king and queen of France, after a day of\r\nconfusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged\r\nsecurity of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of respite,\r\nand troubled, melancholy repose. From this sleep the queen was first\r\nstartled by the voice of the sentinel at her door, who cried out to her\r\nto save herself by flight,--that this was the last proof of fidelity he\r\ncould give,--that they were upon him, and he was dead. Instantly he was\r\ncut down. A band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with his\r\nblood, rushed into the chamber of the queen, and pierced with a hundred\r\nstrokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted\r\nwoman had but just time to fly almost naked, and, through ways unknown\r\nto the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king and\r\nhusband not secure of his own life for a moment.\r\n\r\nThis king, to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant\r\nchildren, (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and\r\ngenerous people,) were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most\r\nsplendid palace in the world, which they left swimming in blood,\r\npolluted by massacre, and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated\r\ncarcasses. Thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom.\r\nTwo had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted, promiscuous\r\nslaughter which was made of the gentlemen of birth and family who\r\ncomposed the king's body-guard. These two gentlemen, with all the parade\r\nof an execution of justice, were cruelly and publicly dragged to the\r\nblock, and beheaded in the great court of the palace. Their heads were\r\nstuck upon spears, and led the procession; whilst the royal captives who\r\nfollowed in the train were slowly moved along, amidst the horrid yells,\r\nand shrilling screams, and frantic dances, and infamous contumelies, and\r\nall the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell, in the abused\r\nshape of the vilest of women. After they had been made to taste, drop by\r\ndrop, more than the bitterness of death, in the slow torture of a\r\njourney of twelve miles, protracted to six hours, they were, under a\r\nguard composed of those very soldiers who had thus conducted them\r\nthrough this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old palaces of Paris,\r\nnow converted into a Bastile for kings.\r\n\r\nIs this a triumph to be consecrated at altars, to be commemorated with\r\ngrateful thanksgiving, to be offered to the Divine Humanity with fervent\r\nprayer and enthusiastic ejaculation?--These Theban and Thracian orgies,\r\nacted in France, and applauded only in the Old Jewry, I assure you,\r\nkindle prophetic enthusiasm in the minds but of very few people in this\r\nkingdom: although a saint and apostle, who may have revelations of his\r\nown, and who has so completely vanquished all the mean superstitions of\r\nthe heart, may incline to think it pious and decorous to compare it\r\nwith the entrance into the world of the Prince of Peace, proclaimed in\r\nan holy temple by a venerable sage, and not long before not worse\r\nannounced by the voice of angels to the quiet innocence of shepherds.\r\n\r\nAt first I was at a loss to account for this fit of unguarded transport.\r\nI knew, indeed, that the sufferings of monarchs make a delicious repast\r\nto some sort of palates. There were reflections which might serve to\r\nkeep this appetite within some bounds of temperance. But when I took one\r\ncircumstance into my consideration, I was obliged to confess that much\r\nallowance ought to be made for the society, and that the temptation was\r\ntoo strong for common discretion: I mean, the circumstance of the Io\r\nPæan of the triumph, the animating cry which called for \"_all_ the\r\nBISHOPS to be hanged on the lamp-posts,\"[91] might well have brought\r\nforth a burst of enthusiasm on the foreseen consequences of this happy\r\nday. I allow to so much enthusiasm some little deviation from prudence.\r\nI allow this prophet to break forth into hymns of joy and thanksgiving\r\non an event which appears like the precursor of the Millennium, and the\r\nprojected Fifth Monarchy, in the destruction of all Church\r\nestablishments. There was, however, (as in all human affairs there is,)\r\nin the midst of this joy, something to exercise the patience of these\r\nworthy gentlemen, and to try the long-suffering of their faith. The\r\nactual murder of the king and queen, and their child, was wanting to the\r\nother auspicious circumstances of this \"_beautiful day_\". The actual\r\nmurder of the bishops, though called for by so many holy ejaculations,\r\nwas also wanting. A group of regicide and sacrilegious slaughter was,\r\nindeed, boldly sketched, but it was only sketched. It unhappily was left\r\nunfinished, in this great history-piece of the massacre of innocents.\r\nWhat hardy pencil of a great master, from the school of the rights of\r\nmen, will finish it, is to be seen hereafter. The age has not yet the\r\ncomplete benefit of that diffusion of knowledge that has undermined\r\nsuperstition and error; and the king of France wants another object or\r\ntwo to consign to oblivion, in consideration of all the good which is to\r\narise from his own sufferings, and the patriotic crimes of an\r\nenlightened age.[92]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this work of our new light and knowledge did not go to the\r\nlength that in all probability it was intended it should be carried, yet\r\nI must think that such treatment of any human creatures must be shocking\r\nto any but those who are made for accomplishing revolutions. But I\r\ncannot stop here. Influenced by the inborn feelings of my nature, and\r\nnot being illuminated by a single ray of this new-sprung modern light,\r\nI confess to you, Sir, that the exalted rank of the persons suffering,\r\nand particularly the sex, the beauty, and the amiable qualities of the\r\ndescendant of so many kings and emperors, with the tender age of royal\r\ninfants, insensible only through infancy and innocence of the cruel\r\noutrages to which their parents were exposed, instead of being a subject\r\nof exultation, adds not a little to my sensibility on that most\r\nmelancholy occasion.\r\n\r\nI hear that the august person who was the principal object of our\r\npreacher's triumph, though he supported himself, felt much on that\r\nshameful occasion. As a man, it became him to feel for his wife and his\r\nchildren, and the faithful guards of his person that were massacred in\r\ncold blood about him; as a prince, it became him to feel for the strange\r\nand frightful transformation of his civilized subjects, and to be more\r\ngrieved for them than solicitous for himself. It derogates little from\r\nhis fortitude, while it adds infinitely to the honor of his humanity. I\r\nam very sorry to say it, very sorry indeed, that such personages are in\r\na situation in which it is not unbecoming in us to praise the virtues of\r\nthe great.\r\n\r\nI hear, and I rejoice to hear, that the great lady, the other object of\r\nthe triumph, has borne that day, (one is interested that beings made for\r\nsuffering should suffer well,) and that she bears all the succeeding\r\ndays, that she bears the imprisonment of her husband, and her own\r\ncaptivity, and the exile of her friends, and the insulting adulation of\r\naddresses, and the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs, with a serene\r\npatience, in a manner suited to her rank and race, and becoming the\r\noffspring of a sovereign distinguished for her piety and her courage;\r\nthat, like her, she has lofty sentiments; that she feels with the\r\ndignity of a Roman matron; that in the last extremity she will save\r\nherself from the last disgrace; and that, if she must fall, she will\r\nfall by no ignoble hand.\r\n\r\nIt is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France,\r\nthen the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this\r\norb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw\r\nher just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere\r\nshe just began to move in,--glittering like the morning-star, full of\r\nlife and splendor and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what an heart must\r\nI have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall!\r\nLittle did I dream, when she added titles of veneration to those of\r\nenthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged\r\nto carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom!\r\nlittle did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen\r\nupon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor, and of\r\ncavaliers! I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their\r\nscabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the\r\nage of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators\r\nhas succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never,\r\nnever more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that\r\nproud submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the\r\nheart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an\r\nexalted freedom! The unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of\r\nnations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone!\r\nIt is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor, which\r\nfelt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated\r\nferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice\r\nitself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness!\r\n\r\nThis mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in the ancient\r\nchivalry; and the principle, though varied in its appearance by the\r\nvarying state of human affairs, subsisted and influenced through a long\r\nsuccession of generations, even to the time we live in. If it should\r\never be totally extinguished, the loss, I fear, will be great. It is\r\nthis which has given its character to modern Europe. It is this which\r\nhas distinguished it under all its forms of government, and\r\ndistinguished it to its advantage, from the states of Asia, and possibly\r\nfrom those states which flourished in the most brilliant periods of the\r\nantique world. It was this, which, without confounding ranks, had\r\nproduced a noble equality, and handed it down through all the gradations\r\nof social life. It was this opinion which mitigated kings into\r\ncompanions, and raised private men to be fellows with kings. Without\r\nforce or opposition, it subdued the fierceness of pride and power; it\r\nobliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar of social esteem,\r\ncompelled stern authority to submit to elegance, and gave a domination,\r\nvanquisher of laws, to be subdued by manners.\r\n\r\nBut now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions which made\r\npower gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different\r\nshades of life, and which by a bland assimilation incorporated into\r\npolitics the sentiments which beautify and soften private society, are\r\nto be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason. All\r\nthe decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the superadded\r\nideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the\r\nheart owns and the understanding ratifies, as necessary to cover the\r\ndefects of our naked, shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in\r\nour own estimation, are to be exploded, as a ridiculous, absurd, and\r\nantiquated fashion.\r\n\r\nOn this scheme of things, a king is but a man, a queen is but a woman, a\r\nwoman is but an animal,--and an animal not of the highest order. All\r\nhomage paid to the sex in general as such, and without distinct views,\r\nis to be regarded as romance and folly. Regicide, and parricide, and\r\nsacrilege, are but fictions of superstition, corrupting jurisprudence by\r\ndestroying its simplicity. The murder of a king, or a queen, or a\r\nbishop, or a father, are only common homicide,--and if the people are by\r\nany chance or in any way gainers by it, a sort of homicide much the most\r\npardonable, and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.\r\n\r\nOn the scheme of this barbarous philosophy, which is the offspring of\r\ncold hearts and muddy understandings and which is as void of solid\r\nwisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance, laws are to be\r\nsupported only by their own terrors, and by the concern which each\r\nindividual may find in them from his own private speculations, or can\r\nspare to them from his own private interests. In the groves of _their_\r\nacademy, at the end of every visto, you see nothing but the gallows.\r\nNothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the\r\ncommonwealth. On the principles of this mechanic philosophy, our\r\ninstitutions can never be embodied, if I may use the expression, in\r\npersons,--so as to create in us love, veneration, admiration, or\r\nattachment. But that sort of reason which banishes the affections is\r\nincapable of filling their place. These public affections, combined with\r\nmanners, are required sometimes as supplements, sometimes as\r\ncorrectives, always as aids to law. The precept given by a wise man, as\r\nwell as a great critic, for the construction of poems, is equally true\r\nas to states:--\"_Non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto_.\"\r\nThere ought to be a system of manners in every nation which a\r\nwell-formed mind would be disposed to relish. To make us love our\r\ncountry, our country ought to be lovely.\r\n\r\nBut power, of some kind or other, will survive the shock in which\r\nmanners and opinions perish; and it will find other and worse means for\r\nits support. The usurpation, which, in order to subvert ancient\r\ninstitutions, has destroyed ancient principles, will hold power by arts\r\nsimilar to those by which it has acquired it. When the old feudal and\r\nchivalrous spirit of _fealty_, which, by freeing kings from fear, freed\r\nboth kings and subjects from the precautions of tyranny, shall be\r\nextinct in the minds of men, plots and assassinations will be\r\nanticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and that\r\nlong roll of grim and bloody maxims which form the political code of all\r\npower not standing on its own honor and the honor of those who are to\r\nobey it. Kings will be tyrants from policy, when subjects are rebels\r\nfrom principle.\r\n\r\nWhen ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the loss cannot\r\npossibly be estimated. From that moment we have no compass to govern us,\r\nnor can we know distinctly to what port we steer. Europe, undoubtedly,\r\ntaken in a mass, was in a flourishing condition the day on which your\r\nRevolution was completed. How much of that prosperous state was owing to\r\nthe spirit of our old manners and opinions is not easy to say; but as\r\nsuch causes cannot be indifferent in their operation, we must presume,\r\nthat, on the whole, their operation was beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe are but too apt to consider things in the state in which we find\r\nthem, without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have\r\nbeen produced, and possibly may be upheld. Nothing is more certain than\r\nthat our manners, our civilization, and all the good things which are\r\nconnected with manners and with, civilization, have, in this European\r\nworld of ours, depended for ages upon two principles, and were, indeed,\r\nthe result of both combined: I mean the spirit of a gentleman, and the\r\nspirit of religion. The nobility and the clergy, the one by profession,\r\nand the other by patronage, kept learning in existence, even in the\r\nmidst of arms and confusions, and whilst governments were rather in\r\ntheir causes than formed. Learning paid back what it received to\r\nnobility and to priesthood, and paid it with usury, by enlarging their\r\nideas, and by furnishing their minds. Happy, if they had all continued\r\nto know their indissoluble union, and their proper place! Happy, if\r\nlearning, not debauched by ambition, had been satisfied to continue the\r\ninstructor, and not aspired to be the master! Along with its natural\r\nprotectors and guardians, learning will be cast into the mire and\r\ntrodden down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.[93]\r\n\r\nIf, as I suspect, modern letters owe more than they are always willing\r\nto own to ancient manners, so do other interests which we value full as\r\nmuch as they are worth. Even commerce, and trade, and manufacture, the\r\ngods of our economical politicians, are themselves perhaps but\r\ncreatures, are themselves but effects, which, as first causes, we choose\r\nto worship. They certainly grew under the same shade in which learning\r\nflourished. They, too, may decay with their natural protecting\r\nprinciples. With you, for the present at least, they all threaten to\r\ndisappear together. Where trade and manufactures are wanting to a\r\npeople, and the spirit of nobility and religion remains, sentiment\r\nsupplies, and not always ill supplies, their place; but if commerce and\r\nthe arts should be lost in an experiment to try how well a state may\r\nstand without these old fundamental principles, what sort of a thing\r\nmust be a nation of gross, stupid, ferocious, and at the same time poor\r\nand sordid barbarians, destitute of religion, honor, or manly pride,\r\npossessing nothing at present, and hoping for nothing hereafter?\r\n\r\nI wish you may not be going fast, and by the shortest cut, to that\r\nhorrible and disgustful situation. Already there appears a poverty of\r\nconception, a coarseness and vulgarity, in all the proceedings of the\r\nAssembly and of all their instructors. Their liberty is not liberal.\r\nTheir science is presumptuous ignorance. Their humanity is savage and\r\nbrutal.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether in England we learned those grand and decorous\r\nprinciples and manners, of which considerable traces yet remain, from\r\nyou, or whether you took them from us. But to you, I think, we trace\r\nthem best. You seem to me to be _gentis incunabula nostræ_. France has\r\nalways more or less influenced manners in England; and when your\r\nfountain is choked up and polluted, the stream will not run long or not\r\nrun clear with us, or perhaps with any nation. This gives all Europe, in\r\nmy opinion, but too close and connected a concern in what is done in\r\nFrance. Excuse me, therefore, if I have dwelt too long on the atrocious\r\nspectacle of the sixth of October, 1789, or have given too much scope to\r\nthe reflections which have arisen in my mind on occasion of the most\r\nimportant of all revolutions, which may be dated from that day: I mean a\r\nrevolution in sentiments, manners, and moral opinions. As things now\r\nstand, with everything respectable destroyed without us, and an attempt\r\nto destroy within us every principle of respect, one is almost forced to\r\napologize for harboring the common feelings of men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy do I feel so differently from the Reverend Dr. Price, and those of\r\nhis lay flock who will choose to adopt the sentiments of his\r\ndiscourse?--For this plain reason: Because it is _natural_ I should;\r\nbecause we are so made as to be affected at such spectacles with\r\nmelancholy sentiments upon the unstable condition of mortal prosperity,\r\nand the tremendous uncertainty of human greatness; because in those\r\nnatural feelings we learn great lessons; because in events like these\r\nour passions instruct our reason; because, when kings are hurled from\r\ntheir thrones by the Supreme Director of this great drama, and become\r\nthe objects of insult to the base and of pity to the good, we behold\r\nsuch disasters in the moral as we should behold a miracle in the\r\nphysical order of things. We are alarmed into reflection; our minds (as\r\nit has long since been observed) are purified by terror and pity; our\r\nweak, unthinking pride is humbled under the dispensations of a\r\nmysterious wisdom. Some tears might be drawn from me, if such a\r\nspectacle were exhibited on the stage. I should be truly ashamed of\r\nfinding in myself that superficial, theatric sense of painted distress,\r\nwhilst I could exult over it in real life. With such a perverted mind, I\r\ncould never venture to show my face at a tragedy. People would think the\r\ntears that Garrick formerly, or that Siddons not long since, have\r\nextorted from me, were the tears of hypocrisy; I should know them to be\r\nthe tears of folly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the theatre is a better school of moral sentiments than churches\r\nwhere the feelings of humanity are thus outraged. Poets who have to deal\r\nwith an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights of men,\r\nand who must apply themselves to the moral constitution of the heart,\r\nwould not dare to produce such a triumph as a matter of exultation.\r\nThere, where men follow their natural impulses, they would not bear the\r\nodious maxims of a Machiavelian policy, whether applied to the\r\nattainment of monarchical or democratic tyranny. They would reject them\r\non the modern, as they once did on the ancient stage, where they could\r\nnot bear even the hypothetical proposition of such wickedness in the\r\nmouth of a personated tyrant, though suitable to the character he\r\nsustained. No theatric audience in Athens would bear what has been borne\r\nin the midst of the real tragedy of this triumphal day: a principal\r\nactor weighing, as it were in scales hung in a shop of horrors, so much\r\nactual crime against so much contingent advantage,--and after putting in\r\nand out weights, declaring that the balance was on the side of the\r\nadvantages. They would not bear to see the crimes of new democracy\r\nposted as in a ledger against the crimes of old despotism, and the\r\nbook-keepers of politics finding democracy still in debt, but by no\r\nmeans unable or unwilling to pay the balance. In the theatre, the first\r\nintuitive glance, without any elaborate process of reasoning, would show\r\nthat this method of political computation would justify every extent of\r\ncrime. They would see, that, on these principles, even where the very\r\nworst acts were not perpetrated, it was owing rather to the fortune of\r\nthe conspirators than to their parsimony in the expenditure of treachery\r\nand blood. They would soon see that criminal means, once tolerated, are\r\nsoon preferred. They present a shorter cut to the object than through\r\nthe highway of the moral virtues. Justifying perfidy and murder for\r\npublic benefit, public benefit would soon become the pretext, and\r\nperfidy and murder the end,--until rapacity, malice, revenge, and fear\r\nmore dreadful than revenge, could satiate their insatiable appetites.\r\nSuch must be the consequences of losing, in the splendor of these\r\ntriumphs of the rights of men, all natural sense of wrong and right.\r\n\r\nBut the reverend pastor exults in this \"leading in triumph,\" because,\r\ntruly, Louis the Sixteenth was \"an arbitrary monarch\": that is, in other\r\nwords, neither more nor less than because he was Louis the Sixteenth,\r\nand because he had the misfortune to be born king of France, with the\r\nprerogatives of which a long line of ancestors, and a long acquiescence\r\nof the people, without any act of his, had put him in possession. A\r\nmisfortune it has indeed turned out to him, that he was born king of\r\nFrance. But misfortune is not crime, nor is indiscretion always the\r\ngreatest guilt. I shall never think that a prince, the acts of whose\r\nwhole reign were a series of concessions to his subjects, who was\r\nwilling to relax his authority, to remit his prerogatives, to call his\r\npeople to a share of freedom not known, perhaps not desired, by their\r\nancestors,--such a prince, though he should be subject to the common\r\nfrailties attached to men and to princes, though he should have once\r\nthought it necessary to provide force against the desperate designs\r\nmanifestly carrying on against his person and the remnants of his\r\nauthority,--though all this should be taken into consideration, I shall\r\nbe led with great difficulty to think he deserves the cruel and\r\ninsulting triumph of Paris, and of Dr. Price. I tremble for the cause of\r\nliberty, from such an example to kings. I tremble for the cause of\r\nhumanity, in the unpunished outrages of the most wicked of mankind. But\r\nthere are some people of that low and degenerate fashion of mind that\r\nthey look up with a sort of complacent awe and admiration to kings who\r\nknow to keep firm in their seat, to hold a strict hand over their\r\nsubjects, to assert their prerogative, and, by the awakened vigilance of\r\na severe despotism, to guard against the very first approaches of\r\nfreedom. Against such as these they never elevate their voice. Deserters\r\nfrom principle, listed with fortune, they never see any good in\r\nsuffering virtue, nor any crime in prosperous usurpation.\r\n\r\nIf it could have been made clear to me that the king and queen of France\r\n(those, I mean, who were such before the triumph) were inexorable and\r\ncruel tyrants, that they had formed a deliberate scheme for massacring\r\nthe National Assembly, (I think I have seen something like the latter\r\ninsinuated in certain publications,) I should think their captivity\r\njust. If this be true, much more ought to have been done, but done, in\r\nmy opinion, in another manner. The punishment of real tyrants is a noble\r\nand awful act of justice; and it has with truth been said to be\r\nconsolatory to the human mind. But if I were to punish a wicked king, I\r\nshould regard the dignity in avenging the crime. Justice is grave and\r\ndecorous, and in its punishments rather seems to submit to a necessity\r\nthan to make a choice. Had Nero, or Agrippina, or Louis the Eleventh, or\r\nCharles the Ninth been the subject,--if Charles the Twelfth of Sweden,\r\nafter the murder of Patkul, or his predecessor, Christina, after the\r\nmurder of Monaldeschi, had fallen into your hands, Sir, or into mine, I\r\nam sure our conduct would have been different.\r\n\r\nIf the French king, or king of the French, (or by whatever name he is\r\nknown in the new vocabulary of your Constitution,) has in his own person\r\nand that of his queen really deserved these unavowed, but unavenged,\r\nmurderous attempts, and those frequent indignities more cruel than\r\nmurder, such a person would ill deserve even that subordinate executory\r\ntrust which I understand is to be placed in him; nor is he fit to be\r\ncalled chief in a nation which he has outraged and oppressed. A worse\r\nchoice for such an office in a new commonwealth than that of a deposed\r\ntyrant could not possibly be made. But to degrade and insult a man as\r\nthe worst of criminals, and afterwards to trust him in your highest\r\nconcerns, as a faithful, honest, and zealous servant, is not consistent\r\nin reasoning, nor prudent in policy, nor safe in practice. Those who\r\ncould make such an appointment must be guilty of a more flagrant breach\r\nof trust than any they have yet committed against the people. As this is\r\nthe only crime in which your leading politicians could have acted\r\ninconsistently, I conclude that there is no sort of ground for these\r\nhorrid insinuations. I think no better of all the other calumnies.\r\n\r\nIn England, we give no credit to them. We are generous enemies; we are\r\nfaithful allies. We spurn from us with disgust and indignation the\r\nslanders of those who bring us their anecdotes with the attestation of\r\nthe flower-de-luce on their shoulder. We have Lord George Gordon fast in\r\nNewgate; and neither his being a public proselyte to Judaism, nor his\r\nhaving, in his zeal against Catholic priests and all sorts of\r\necclesiastics, raised a mob (excuse the term, it is still in use here)\r\nwhich pulled down all our prisons, have preserved to him a liberty of\r\nwhich he did not render himself worthy by a virtuous use of it. We have\r\nrebuilt Newgate, and tenanted the mansion. We have prisons almost as\r\nstrong as the Bastile, for those who dare to libel the queens of France.\r\nIn this spiritual retreat let the noble libeller remain. Let him there\r\nmeditate on his Talmud, until he learns a conduct more becoming his\r\nbirth and parts, and not so disgraceful to the ancient religion to which\r\nhe has become a proselyte,--or until some persons from your side of the\r\nwater, to please your new Hebrew brethren, shall ransom him. He may then\r\nbe enabled to purchase, with the old hoards of the synagogue, and a very\r\nsmall poundage on the long compound interest of the thirty pieces of\r\nsilver, (Dr. Price has shown us what miracles compound interest will\r\nperform in 1790 years,) the lands which are lately discovered to have\r\nbeen usurped by the Gallican Church. Send us your Popish Archbishop of\r\nParis, and we will send you our Protestant Rabbin. We shall treat the\r\nperson you send us in exchange like a gentleman and an honest man, as he\r\nis: but pray let him bring with him the fund of his hospitality, bounty,\r\nand charity; and, depend upon it, we shall never confiscate a shilling\r\nof that honorable and pious fund, nor think of enriching the Treasury\r\nwith the spoils of the poor-box.\r\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, my dear Sir, I think the honor of our nation to\r\nbe somewhat concerned in the disclaimer of the proceedings of this\r\nsociety of the Old Jewry and the London Tavern. I have no man's proxy. I\r\nspeak only from myself, when I disclaim, as I do with all possible\r\nearnestness, all communion with the actors in that triumph, or with the\r\nadmirers of it. When I assert anything else, as concerning the people of\r\nEngland, I speak from observation, not from authority; but I speak from\r\nthe experience I have had in a pretty extensive and mixed communication\r\nwith the inhabitants of this kingdom, of all descriptions and ranks, and\r\nafter a course of attentive observation, begun in early life, and\r\ncontinued for near forty years. I have often been astonished,\r\nconsidering that we are divided from you but by a slender dike of about\r\ntwenty-four miles, and that the mutual intercourse between the two\r\ncountries has lately been very great, to find how little you seem to\r\nknow of us. I suspect that this is owing to your forming a judgment of\r\nthis nation from certain publications, which do, very erroneously, if\r\nthey do at all, represent the opinions and dispositions generally\r\nprevalent in England. The vanity, restlessness, petulance, and spirit\r\nof intrigue of several petty cabals, who attempt to hide their total\r\nwant of consequence in bustle and noise, and puffing and mutual\r\nquotation of each other, makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect\r\nof their abilities is a general mark of acquiescence in their opinions.\r\nNo such thing, I assure you. Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a\r\nfern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands\r\nof great cattle reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak chew the\r\ncud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise\r\nare the only inhabitants of the field,--that, of course, they are many\r\nin number,--or that, after all, they are other than the little,\r\nshrivelled, meagre, hopping, though loud and troublesome insects of the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nI almost venture to affirm that not one in a hundred amongst us\r\nparticipates in the \"triumph\" of the Revolution Society. If the king and\r\nqueen of France and their children were to fall into our hands by the\r\nchance of war, in the most acrimonious of all hostilities, (I deprecate\r\nsuch an event, I deprecate such hostility,) they would be treated with\r\nanother sort of triumphal entry into London. We formerly have had a king\r\nof France in that situation: you have read how he was treated by the\r\nvictor in the field, and in what manner he was afterwards received in\r\nEngland. Four hundred years have gone over us; but I believe we are not\r\nmaterially changed since that period. Thanks to our sullen resistance to\r\ninnovation, thanks to the cold sluggishness of our national character,\r\nwe still bear the stamp of our forefathers. We have not (as I conceive)\r\nlost the generosity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century;\r\nnor as yet have we subtilized ourselves into savages. We are not the\r\nconverts of Rousseau; we are not the disciples of Voltaire; Helvetius\r\nhas made no progress amongst us. Atheists are not our preachers; madmen\r\nare not our lawgivers. We know that _we_ have made no discoveries, and\r\nwe think that no discoveries are to be made, in morality,--nor many in\r\nthe great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which\r\nwere understood long before we were born altogether as well as they will\r\nbe after the grave has heaped its mould upon our presumption, and the\r\nsilent tomb shall have imposed its law on our pert loquacity. In England\r\nwe have not yet been completely embowelled of our natural entrails: we\r\nstill feel within us, and we cherish and cultivate, those inbred\r\nsentiments which are the faithful guardians, the active monitors of our\r\nduty, the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals. We have not\r\nbeen drawn and trussed, in order that we may be filled, like stuffed\r\nbirds in a museum, with chaff and rags, and paltry, blurred shreds of\r\npaper about the rights of man. We preserve the whole of our feelings\r\nstill native and entire, unsophisticated by pedantry and infidelity. We\r\nhave real hearts of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms. We fear God;\r\nwe look up with awe to kings, with affection to Parliaments, with duty\r\nto magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to\r\nnobility.[94] Why? Because, when such ideas are brought before our\r\nminds, it is _natural_ to be so affected; because all other feelings are\r\nfalse and spurious, and tend to corrupt our minds, to vitiate our\r\nprimary morals, to render us unfit for rational liberty, and, by\r\nteaching us a servile, licentious, and abandoned insolence, to be our\r\nlow sport for a few holidays, to make us perfectly fit for and justly\r\ndeserving of slavery through the whole course of our lives.\r\n\r\nYou see, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confess\r\nthat we are generally men of untaught feelings: that, instead of casting\r\naway all our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable\r\ndegree; and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish them because\r\nthey are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted, and the more\r\ngenerally they have prevailed, the more we cherish them. We are afraid\r\nto put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason;\r\nbecause we suspect that the stock in each man is small, and that the\r\nindividuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and\r\ncapital of nations and of ages. Many of our men of speculation, instead\r\nof exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the\r\nlatent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, (and\r\nthey seldom fail,) they think it more wise to continue the prejudice,\r\nwith the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and\r\nto leave nothing but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its\r\nreason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection\r\nwhich will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the\r\nemergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom\r\nand virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of\r\ndecision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's\r\nvirtue his habit, and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just\r\nprejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.\r\n\r\nYour literary men, and your politicians, and so do the whole clan of the\r\nenlightened among us, essentially differ in these points. They have no\r\nrespect for the wisdom of others; but they pay it off by a very full\r\nmeasure of confidence in their own. With them it is a sufficient motive\r\nto destroy an old scheme of things, because it is an old one. As to the\r\nnew, they are in no sort of fear with regard to the duration of a\r\nbuilding run up in haste; because duration is no object to those who\r\nthink little or nothing has been done before their time, and who place\r\nall their hopes in discovery. They conceive, very systematically, that\r\nall things which give perpetuity are mischievous, and therefore they are\r\nat inexpiable war with all establishments. They think that government\r\nmay vary like modes of dress, and with as little ill effect; that there\r\nneeds no principle of attachment, except a sense of present conveniency,\r\nto any constitution of the state. They always speak as if they were of\r\nopinion that there is a singular species of compact between them and\r\ntheir magistrates, which binds the magistrate, but which has nothing\r\nreciprocal in it, but that the majesty of the people has a right to\r\ndissolve it without any reason but its will. Their attachment to their\r\ncountry itself is only so far as it agrees with some of their fleeting\r\nprojects: it begins and ends with that scheme of polity which falls in\r\nwith their momentary opinion.\r\n\r\nThese doctrines, or rather sentiments, seem prevalent with your new\r\nstatesmen. But they are wholly different from those on which we have\r\nalways acted in this country.\r\n\r\nI hear it is sometimes given out in France, that what is doing among you\r\nis after the example of England. I beg leave to affirm that scarcely\r\nanything done with you has originated from the practice or the prevalent\r\nopinions of this people, either in the act or in the spirit of the\r\nproceeding. Let me add, that we are as unwilling to learn these lessons\r\nfrom France as we are sure that we never taught them to that nation. The\r\ncabals here who take a sort of share in your transactions as yet consist\r\nof but a handful of people. If, unfortunately, by their intrigues, their\r\nsermons, their publications, and by a confidence derived from an\r\nexpected union with the counsels and forces of the French nation, they\r\nshould draw considerable numbers into their faction, and in consequence\r\nshould seriously attempt anything here in imitation of what has been\r\ndone with you, the event, I dare venture to prophesy, will be, that,\r\nwith some trouble to their country, they will soon accomplish their own\r\ndestruction. This people refused to change their law in remote ages from\r\nrespect to the infallibility of Popes, and they will not now alter it\r\nfrom a pious implicit faith in the dogmatism of philosophers,--though\r\nthe former was armed with the anathema and crusade, and though the\r\nlatter should act with the libel and the lamp-iron.\r\n\r\nFormerly your affairs were your own concern only. We felt for them as\r\nmen; but we kept aloof from them, because we were not citizens of\r\nFrance. But when we see the model held up to ourselves, we must feel as\r\nEnglishmen, and, feeling, we must provide as Englishmen. Your affairs,\r\nin spite of us, are made a part of our interest,--so far at least as to\r\nkeep at a distance your panacea or your plague. If it be a panacea, we\r\ndo not want it: we know the consequences of unnecessary physic. If it be\r\na plague, it is such a plague that the precautions of the most severe\r\nquarantine ought to be established against it.\r\n\r\nI hear on all hands, that a cabal, calling itself philosophic, receives\r\nthe glory of many of the late proceedings, and that their opinions and\r\nsystems are the true actuating spirit of the whole of them. I have heard\r\nof no party in England, literary or political, at any time, known by\r\nsuch a description. It is not with you composed of those men, is it?\r\nwhom the vulgar, in their blunt, homely style, commonly call Atheists\r\nand Infidels? If it be, I admit that we, too, have had writers of that\r\ndescription, who made some noise in their day. At present they repose in\r\nlasting oblivion. Who, born within the last forty years, has read one\r\nword of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that\r\nwhole race who called themselves Freethinkers? Who now reads\r\nBolingbroke? Who ever read him through? Ask the booksellers of London\r\nwhat is become of all these lights of the world. In as few years their\r\nfew successors will go to the family vault of \"all the Capulets.\" But\r\nwhatever they were, or are, with us they were and are wholly unconnected\r\nindividuals. With us they kept the common nature of their kind, and were\r\nnot gregarious. They never acted in corps, nor were known as a faction\r\nin the state, nor presumed to influence in that name or character, or\r\nfor the purposes of such a faction, on any of our public concerns.\r\nWhether they ought so to exist, and so be permitted to act, is another\r\nquestion. As such cabals have not existed in England, so neither has the\r\nspirit of them had any influence in establishing the original frame of\r\nour Constitution, or in any one of the several reparations and\r\nimprovements it has undergone. The whole has been done under the\r\nauspices, and is confirmed by the sanctions, of religion and piety. The\r\nwhole has emanated from the simplicity of our national character, and\r\nfrom a sort of native plainness and directness of understanding, which\r\nfor a long time characterized those men who have successively obtained\r\nauthority among us. This disposition still remains,--at least in the\r\ngreat body of the people.\r\n\r\nWe know, and, what is better, we feel inwardly, that religion is the\r\nbasis of civil society, and the source of all good, and of all\r\ncomfort.[95] In England we are so convinced of this, that there is no\r\nrust of superstition, with which the accumulated absurdity of the human\r\nmind might have crusted it over in the course of ages, that ninety-nine\r\nin a hundred of the people of England would not prefer to impiety. We\r\nshall never be such fools as to call in an enemy to the substance of any\r\nsystem to remove its corruptions, to supply its defects, or to perfect\r\nits construction. If our religious tenets should ever want a further\r\nelucidation, we shall not call on Atheism to explain them. We shall not\r\nlight up our temple from that unhallowed fire. It will be illuminated\r\nwith other lights. It will be perfumed with other incense than the\r\ninfectious stuff which is imported by the smugglers of adulterated\r\nmetaphysics. If our ecclesiastical establishment should want a revision,\r\nit is not avarice or rapacity, public or private, that we shall employ\r\nfor the audit or receipt or application of its consecrated revenue.\r\nViolently condemning neither the Greek nor the Armenian, nor, since\r\nheats are subsided, the Roman system of religion, we prefer the\r\nProtestant: not because we think it has less of the Christian religion\r\nin it, but because, in our judgment, it has more. We are Protestants,\r\nnot from indifference, but from zeal.\r\n\r\nWe know, and it is our pride to know, that man is by his constitution a\r\nreligious animal; that atheism is against, not only our reason, but our\r\ninstincts; and that it cannot prevail long. But if, in the moment of\r\nriot, and in a drunken delirium from the hot spirit drawn out of the\r\nalembic of hell, which in France is now so furiously boiling, we should\r\nuncover our nakedness, by throwing off that Christian religion which has\r\nhitherto been our boast and comfort, and one great source of\r\ncivilization amongst us, and among many other nations, we are\r\napprehensive (being well aware that the mind will not endure a void)\r\nthat some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition might take\r\nplace of it.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, before we take from our establishment the natural,\r\nhuman means of estimation, and give it up to contempt, as you have done,\r\nand in doing it have incurred the penalties you well deserve to suffer,\r\nwe desire that some other may be presented to us in the place of it. We\r\nshall then form our judgment.\r\n\r\nOn these ideas, instead of quarrelling with establishments, as some do,\r\nwho have made a philosophy and a religion of their hostility to such\r\ninstitutions, we cleave closely to them. We are resolved to keep an\r\nestablished church, an established monarchy, an established aristocracy,\r\nand an established democracy, each in the degree it exists, and in no\r\ngreater. I shall show you presently how much of each of these we\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nIt has been the misfortune (not, as these gentlemen think it, the glory)\r\nof this age, that everything is to be discussed, as if the Constitution\r\nof our country were to be always a subject rather of altercation than\r\nenjoyment. For this reason, as well as for the satisfaction of those\r\namong you (if any such you have among you) who may wish to profit of\r\nexamples, I venture to trouble you with a few thoughts upon each of\r\nthese establishments. I do not think they were unwise in ancient Rome,\r\nwho, when they wished to new-model their laws, sent commissioners to\r\nexamine the best-constituted republics within their reach.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst I beg leave to speak of our Church Establishment, which is the\r\nfirst of our prejudices,--not a prejudice destitute of reason, but\r\ninvolving in it profound and extensive wisdom. I speak of it first. It\r\nis first, and last, and midst in our minds. For, taking ground on that\r\nreligious system of which we are now in possession, we continue to act\r\non the early received and uniformly continued sense of mankind. That\r\nsense not only, like a wise architect, hath built up the august fabric\r\nof states, but, like a provident proprietor, to preserve the structure\r\nfrom profanation and ruin, as a sacred temple, purged from all the\r\nimpurities of fraud and violence and injustice and tyranny, hath\r\nsolemnly and forever consecrated the commonwealth, and all that\r\nofficiate in it. This consecration is made, that all who administer in\r\nthe government of men, in which they stand in the person of God Himself,\r\nshould have high and worthy notions of their function and destination;\r\nthat their hope should be full of immortality; that they should not look\r\nto the paltry pelf of the moment, nor to the temporary and transient\r\npraise of the vulgar, but to a solid, permanent existence, in the\r\npermanent part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory, in\r\nthe example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.\r\n\r\nSuch sublime principles ought to be infused into persons of exalted\r\nsituations, and religious establishments provided that may continually\r\nrevive and enforce them. Every sort of moral, every sort of civil, every\r\nsort of politic institution, aiding the rational and natural ties that\r\nconnect the human understanding and affections to the divine, are not\r\nmore than necessary, in order to build up that wonderful structure,\r\nMan,--whose prerogative it is, to be in a great degree a creature of his\r\nown making, and who, when made as he ought to be made, is destined to\r\nhold no trivial place in the creation. But whenever man is put over men,\r\nas the better nature ought ever to preside, in that case more\r\nparticularly he should as nearly as possible be approximated to his\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe consecration of the state by a state religious establishment is\r\nnecessary also to operate with a wholesome awe upon free citizens;\r\nbecause, in order to secure their freedom, they must enjoy some\r\ndeterminate portion of power. To them, therefore, a religion connected\r\nwith the state, and with their duty towards it, becomes even more\r\nnecessary than in such societies where the people, by the terms of their\r\nsubjection, are confined to private sentiments, and the management of\r\ntheir own family concerns. All persons possessing any portion of power\r\nought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that they act in\r\ntrust, and that they are to account for their conduct in that trust to\r\nthe one great Master, Author, and Founder of society.\r\n\r\nThis principle ought even to be more strongly impressed upon the minds\r\nof those who compose the collective sovereignty than upon those of\r\nsingle princes. Without instruments, these princes can do nothing.\r\nWhoever uses instruments, in finding helps, finds also impediments.\r\nTheir power is therefore by no means complete; nor are they safe in\r\nextreme abuse. Such persons, however elevated by flattery, arrogance,\r\nand self-opinion, must be sensible, that, whether covered or not by\r\npositive law, in some way or other they are accountable even here for\r\nthe abuse of their trust. If they are not cut off by a rebellion of\r\ntheir people, they may be strangled by the very janissaries kept for\r\ntheir security against all other rebellion. Thus we have seen the king\r\nof France sold by his soldiers for an increase of pay. But where popular\r\nauthority is absolute and unrestrained, the people have an infinitely\r\ngreater, because a far better founded, confidence in their own power.\r\nThey are themselves in a great measure their own instruments. They are\r\nnearer to their objects. Besides, they are less under responsibility to\r\none of the greatest controlling powers on earth, the sense of fame and\r\nestimation. The share of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of\r\neach individual in public acts is small indeed: the operation of opinion\r\nbeing in the inverse ratio to the number of those who abuse power. Their\r\nown approbation of their own acts has to them the appearance of a public\r\njudgment in their favor. A perfect democracy is therefore the most\r\nshameless thing in the world. As it is the most shameless, it is also\r\nthe most fearless. No man apprehends in his person that he can be made\r\nsubject to punishment. Certainly the people at large never ought: for,\r\nas all punishments are for example towards the conservation of the\r\npeople at large, the people at large can never become the subject of\r\npunishment by any human hand.[96] It is therefore of infinite importance\r\nthat they should not be suffered to imagine that their will, any more\r\nthan that of kings, is the standard of right and wrong. They ought to be\r\npersuaded that they are full as little entitled, and far less qualified,\r\nwith safety to themselves, to use any arbitrary power whatsoever; that\r\ntherefore they are not, under a false show of liberty, but in truth to\r\nexercise an unnatural, inverted domination, tyrannically to exact from\r\nthose who officiate in the state, not an entire devotion to their\r\ninterest, which is their right, but an abject submission to their\r\noccasional will: extinguishing thereby, in all those who serve them, all\r\nmoral principle, all sense of dignity, all use of judgment, and all\r\nconsistency of character; whilst by the very same process they give\r\nthemselves up a proper, a suitable, but a most contemptible prey to the\r\nservile ambition of popular sycophants or courtly flatterers.\r\n\r\nWhen the people have emptied themselves of all the lust of selfish will,\r\nwhich without religion it is utterly impossible they ever should,--when\r\nthey are conscious that they exercise, and exercise perhaps in a higher\r\nlink of the order of delegation, the power which to be legitimate must\r\nbe according to that eternal, immutable law in which will and reason are\r\nthe same,--they will be more careful how they place power in base and\r\nincapable hands. In their nomination to office, they will not appoint to\r\nthe exercise of authority as to a pitiful job, but as to a holy\r\nfunction; not according to their sordid, selfish interest, nor to their\r\nwanton caprice, nor to their arbitrary will; but they will confer that\r\npower (which any man may well tremble to give or to receive) on those\r\nonly in whom they may discern that predominant proportion of active\r\nvirtue and wisdom, taken together and fitted to the charge, such as in\r\nthe great and inevitable mixed mass of human imperfections and\r\ninfirmities is to be found.\r\n\r\nWhen they are habitually convinced that no evil can be acceptable,\r\neither in the act or the permission, to Him whose essence is good, they\r\nwill be better able to extirpate out of the minds of all magistrates,\r\ncivil, ecclesiastical, or military, anything that bears the least\r\nresemblance to a proud and lawless domination.\r\n\r\nBut one of the first and most leading principles on which the\r\ncommonwealth and the laws are consecrated is lest the temporary\r\npossessors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received\r\nfrom their ancestors, or of what is due to their posterity, should act\r\nas if they were the entire masters; that they should not think it\r\namongst their rights to cut off the entail or commit waste on the\r\ninheritance, by destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric\r\nof their society: hazarding to leave to those who come after them a ruin\r\ninstead of an habitation,--and teaching these successors as little to\r\nrespect their contrivances as they had themselves respected the\r\ninstitutions of their forefathers. By this unprincipled facility of\r\nchanging the state as often and as much and in as many ways as there are\r\nfloating fancies or fashions, the whole chain and continuity of the\r\ncommonwealth would be broken; no one generation could link with the\r\nother; men would become little better than the flies of a summer.\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, the science of jurisprudence, the pride of the human\r\nintellect, which, with all its defects, redundancies, and errors, is the\r\ncollected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice\r\nwith the infinite variety of human concerns, as a heap of old exploded\r\nerrors, would be no longer studied. Personal self-sufficiency and\r\narrogance (the certain attendants upon all those who have never\r\nexperienced a wisdom greater than their own) would usurp the tribunal.\r\nOf course no certain laws, establishing invariable grounds of hope and\r\nfear, would keep the actions of men in a certain course, or direct them\r\nto a certain end. Nothing stable in the modes of holding property or\r\nexercising function could form a solid ground on which any parent could\r\nspeculate in the education of his offspring, or in a choice for their\r\nfuture establishment in the world. No principles would be early worked\r\ninto the habits. As soon as the most able instructor had completed his\r\nlaborious course of institution, instead of sending forth his pupil\r\naccomplished in a virtuous discipline fitted to procure him attention\r\nand respect in his place in society, he would find everything altered,\r\nand that he had turned out a poor creature to the contempt and derision\r\nof the world, ignorant of the true grounds of estimation. Who would\r\ninsure a tender and delicate sense of honor to beat almost with the\r\nfirst pulses of the heart, when no man could know what would be the test\r\nof honor in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin? No\r\npart of life would retain its acquisitions. Barbarism with regard to\r\nscience and literature, unskilfulness with regard to arts and\r\nmanufactures, would infallibly succeed to the want of a steady education\r\nand settled principle; and thus the commonwealth itself would in a few\r\ngenerations crumble away, be disconnected into the dust and powder of\r\nindividuality, and at length dispersed to all the winds of heaven.\r\n\r\nTo avoid, therefore, the evils of inconstancy and versatility, ten\r\nthousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice,\r\nwe have consecrated the state, that no man should approach to look into\r\nits defects or corruptions but with due caution; that he should never\r\ndream of beginning its reformation by its subversion; that he should\r\napproach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father, with\r\npious awe and trembling solicitude. By this wise prejudice we are taught\r\nto look with horror on those children of their country who are prompt\r\nrashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of\r\nmagicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations\r\nthey may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their\r\nfather's life.\r\n\r\nSociety is, indeed, a contract. Subordinate contracts for objects of\r\nmere occasional interest may be dissolved at pleasure; but the state\r\nought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership\r\nagreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some\r\nother such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest,\r\nand to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on\r\nwith other reverence; because it is not a partnership in things\r\nsubservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and\r\nperishable nature. It is a partnership in all science, a partnership in\r\nall art, a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection. As the\r\nends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it\r\nbecomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between\r\nthose who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.\r\nEach contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great\r\nprimeval contract of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher\r\nnatures, connecting the visible and invisible world, according to a\r\nfixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical\r\nand all moral natures each in their appointed place. This law is not\r\nsubject to the will of those who, by an obligation above them, and\r\ninfinitely superior, are bound to submit their will to that law. The\r\nmunicipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at\r\nliberty, at their pleasure, and on their speculations of a contingent\r\nimprovement, wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their\r\nsubordinate community, and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil,\r\nunconnected chaos of elementary principles. It is the first and supreme\r\nnecessity only, a necessity that is not chosen, but chooses, a necessity\r\nparamount to deliberation, that admits no discussion and demands no\r\nevidence, which alone can justify a resort to anarchy. This necessity is\r\nno exception to the rule; because this necessity itself is a part, too,\r\nof that moral and physical disposition of things to which man must be\r\nobedient by consent or force: but if that which is only submission to\r\nnecessity should be made the object of choice, the law is broken, Nature\r\nis disobeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, cast forth, and exiled,\r\nfrom this world of reason, and order, and peace, and virtue, and\r\nfruitful penitence, into the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice,\r\nconfusion, and unavailing sorrow.\r\n\r\nThese, my dear Sir, are, were, and, I think, long will be, the\r\nsentiments of not the least learned and reflecting part of this kingdom.\r\nThey who are included in this description form their opinions on such\r\ngrounds as such persons ought to form them. The less inquiring receive\r\nthem from an authority which those whom Providence dooms to live on\r\ntrust need not be ashamed to rely on. These two sorts of men move in the\r\nsame direction, though in a different place. They both move with the\r\norder of the universe. They all know or feel this great ancient\r\ntruth:--\"_Quod illi principi et præpotenti Deo qui omnem hunc mundum\r\nregit nihil eorum quæ quidem fiant in terris acceptius quam concilia et\r\ncoetus hominum jure sociati quæ civitates appellantur_.\" They take this\r\ntenet of the head and heart, not from the great name which it\r\nimmediately bears, nor from the greater from whence it is derived, but\r\nfrom that which alone can give true weight and sanction to any learned\r\nopinion, the common nature and common relation of men. Persuaded that\r\nall things ought to be done with reference, and referring all to the\r\npoint of reference to which all should be directed, they think\r\nthemselves bound, not only as individuals in the sanctuary of the heart,\r\nor as congregated in that personal capacity, to renew the memory of\r\ntheir high origin and cast, but also in their corporate character to\r\nperform their national homage to the Institutor and Author and Protector\r\nof civil society, without which civil society man could not by any\r\npossibility arrive at the perfection of which his nature is capable, nor\r\neven make a remote and faint approach to it. They conceive that He who\r\ngave our nature to be perfected by our virtue willed also the necessary\r\nmeans of its perfection: He willed, therefore, the state: He willed its\r\nconnection with the source and original archetype of all perfection.\r\nThey who are convinced of this His will, which is the law of laws and\r\nthe sovereign of sovereigns, cannot think it reprehensible that this our\r\ncorporate fealty and homage, that this our recognition of a signiory\r\nparamount, I had almost said this oblation of the state itself, as a\r\nworthy offering on the high altar of universal praise, should be\r\nperformed, as all public, solemn acts are performed, in buildings, in\r\nmusic, in decoration, in speech, in the dignity of persons, according to\r\nthe customs of mankind, taught by their nature,--that is, with modest\r\nsplendor, with unassuming state, with mild majesty and sober pomp. For\r\nthose purposes they think some part of the wealth of the country is as\r\nusefully employed as it can be in fomenting the luxury of individuals.\r\nIt is the public ornament. It is the public consolation. It nourishes\r\nthe public hope. The poorest man finds his own importance and dignity in\r\nit, whilst the wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the\r\nman of humble rank and fortune sensible of his inferiority, and degrades\r\nand vilifies his condition. It is for the man in humble life, and to\r\nraise his nature, and to put him in mind of a state in which the\r\nprivileges of opulence will cease, when he will be equal by nature, and\r\nmay be more than equal by virtue, that this portion of the general\r\nwealth of his country is employed and sanctified.\r\n\r\nI assure you I do not aim at singularity. I give you opinions which have\r\nbeen accepted amongst us, from very early times to this moment, with a\r\ncontinued and general approbation, and which, indeed, are so worked into\r\nmy mind that I am unable to distinguish what I have learned from others\r\nfrom the results of my own meditation.\r\n\r\nIt is on some such principles that the majority of the people of\r\nEngland, far from thinking a religious national establishment unlawful,\r\nhardly think it lawful to be without one. In France you are wholly\r\nmistaken, if you do not believe us above all other things attached to\r\nit, and beyond all other nations; and when this people has acted\r\nunwisely and unjustifiably in its favor, (as in some instances they have\r\ndone, most certainly,) in their very errors you will at least discover\r\ntheir zeal.\r\n\r\nThis principle runs through the whole system of their polity. They do\r\nnot consider their Church establishment as convenient, but as essential\r\nto their state: not as a thing heterogeneous and separable,--something\r\nadded for accommodation,--what they may either keep up or lay aside,\r\naccording to their temporary ideas of convenience. They consider it as\r\nthe foundation of their whole Constitution, with which, and with every\r\npart of which, it holds an indissoluble union. Church and State are\r\nideas inseparable in their minds, and scarcely is the one ever mentioned\r\nwithout mentioning the other.\r\n\r\nOur education is so formed as to confirm and fix this impression. Our\r\neducation is in a manner wholly in the hands of ecclesiastics, and in\r\nall stages from infancy to manhood. Even when our youth, leaving schools\r\nand universities, enter that most important period of life which begins\r\nto link experience and study together, and when with that view they\r\nvisit other countries, instead of old domestics whom we have seen as\r\ngovernors to principal men from other parts, three fourths of those who\r\ngo abroad with our young nobility and gentlemen are ecclesiastics: not\r\nas austere masters, nor as mere followers; but as friends and companions\r\nof a graver character, and not seldom persons as well born as\r\nthemselves. With them, as relations, they most commonly keep up a close\r\nconnection through life. By this connection we conceive that we attach\r\nour gentlemen to the Church; and we liberalize the Church by an\r\nintercourse with the leading characters of the country.\r\n\r\nSo tenacious are we of the old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of\r\ninstitution, that very little alteration has been made in them since the\r\nfourteenth or fifteenth century: adhering in this particular, as in all\r\nthings else, to our old settled maxim, never entirely nor at once to\r\ndepart from antiquity. We found these old institutions, on the whole,\r\nfavorable to morality and discipline; and we thought they were\r\nsusceptible of amendment, without altering the ground. We thought that\r\nthey were capable of receiving and meliorating, and above all of\r\npreserving, the accessions of science and literature, as the order of\r\nProvidence should successively produce them. And after all, with this\r\nGothic and monkish education, (for such it is in the groundwork,) we may\r\nput in our claim to as ample and as early a share in all the\r\nimprovements in science, in arts, and in literature, which have\r\nilluminated and adorned the modern world, as any other nation in Europe:\r\nwe think one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the\r\npatrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.\r\n\r\nIt is from our attachment to a Church establishment, that the English\r\nnation did not think it wise to intrust that great fundamental interest\r\nof the whole to what they trust no part of their civil or military\r\npublic service,--that is, to the unsteady and precarious contribution of\r\nindividuals. They go further. They certainly never have suffered, and\r\nnever will suffer, the fixed estate of the Church to be converted into a\r\npension, to depend on the Treasury, and to be delayed, withheld, or\r\nperhaps to be extinguished by fiscal difficulties: which difficulties\r\nmay sometimes be pretended for political purposes, and are in fact often\r\nbrought on by the extravagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians.\r\nThe people of England think that they have constitutional motives, as\r\nwell as religious, against any project of turning their independent\r\nclergy into ecclesiastical pensioners of state. They tremble for their\r\nliberty, from the influence of a clergy dependent on the crown; they\r\ntremble for the public tranquillity, from the disorders of a factious\r\nclergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the crown. They\r\ntherefore made their Church, like their king and their nobility,\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nFrom the united considerations of religion and constitutional policy,\r\nfrom their opinion of a duty to make a sure provision for the\r\nconsolation of the feeble and the instruction of the ignorant, they have\r\nincorporated and identified the estate of the Church with the mass of\r\n_private property_, of which the state is not the proprietor, either for\r\nuse or dominion, but the guardian only and the regulator. They have\r\nordained that the provision of this establishment might be as stable as\r\nthe earth on which it stands, and should not fluctuate with the Euripus\r\nof funds and actions.\r\n\r\nThe men of England, the men, I mean, of light and leading in England,\r\nwhose wisdom (if they have any) is open and direct, would be ashamed, as\r\nof a silly, deceitful trick, to profess any religion in name, which by\r\ntheir proceedings they appear to contemn. If by their conduct (the only\r\nlanguage that rarely lies) they seemed to regard the great ruling\r\nprinciple of the moral and the natural world as a mere invention to keep\r\nthe vulgar in obedience, they apprehend that by such a conduct they\r\nwould defeat the politic purpose they have in view. They would find it\r\ndifficult to make others believe in a system to which they manifestly\r\ngave no credit themselves. The Christian statesmen of this land would,\r\nindeed, first provide for the _multitude_, because it is the\r\n_multitude_, and is therefore, as such, the first object in the\r\necclesiastical institution, and in all institutions. They have been\r\ntaught that the circumstance of the Gospel's being preached to the poor\r\nwas one of the great tests of its true mission. They think, therefore,\r\nthat those do not believe it who do not take care it should be preached\r\nto the poor. But as they know that charity is not confined to any one\r\ndescription, but ought to apply itself to all men who have wants, they\r\nare not deprived of a due and anxious sensation of pity to the\r\ndistresses of the miserable great. They are not repelled, through a\r\nfastidious delicacy, at the stench of their arrogance and presumption,\r\nfrom a medicinal attention to their mental blotches and running sores.\r\nThey are sensible that religious instruction is of more consequence to\r\nthem than to any others: from the greatness of the temptation to which\r\nthey are exposed; from the important consequences that attend their\r\nfaults; from the contagion of their ill example; from the necessity of\r\nbowing down the stubborn neck of their pride and ambition to the yoke of\r\nmoderation and virtue; from a consideration of the fat stupidity and\r\ngross ignorance concerning what imports men most to know, which prevails\r\nat courts, and at the head of armies, and in senates, as much as at the\r\nloom and in the field.\r\n\r\nThe English people are satisfied, that to the great the consolations of\r\nreligion are as necessary as its instructions. They, too, are among the\r\nunhappy. They feel personal pain and domestic sorrow. In these they have\r\nno privilege, but are subject to pay their full contingent to the\r\ncontributions levied on mortality. They want this sovereign balm under\r\ntheir gnawing cares and anxieties, which, being less conversant about\r\nthe limited wants of animal life, range without limit, and are\r\ndiversified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regions\r\nof imagination. Some charitable dole is wanting to these, our often\r\nvery unhappy brethren, to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds\r\nwhich have nothing on earth to hope or fear; something to relieve in the\r\nkilling languor and over-labored lassitude of those who have nothing to\r\ndo; something to excite an appetite to existence in the palled satiety\r\nwhich attends on all pleasures which may be bought, where Nature is not\r\nleft to her own process, where even desire is anticipated, and therefore\r\nfruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight, and\r\nno interval, no obstacle, is interposed between the wish and the\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe people of England know how little influence the teachers of religion\r\nare likely to have with the wealthy and powerful of long standing, and\r\nhow much less with the newly fortunate, if they appear in a manner no\r\nway assorted to those with whom they must associate, and over whom they\r\nmust even exercise, in some cases, something like an authority. What\r\nmust they think of that body of teachers, if they see it in no part\r\nabove the establishment of their domestic servants? If the poverty were\r\nvoluntary, there might be some difference. Strong instances of\r\nself-denial operate powerfully on our minds; and a man who has no wants\r\nhas obtained great freedom and firmness, and even dignity. But as the\r\nmass of any description of men are but men, and their poverty cannot be\r\nvoluntary, that disrespect which attends upon all lay poverty will not\r\ndepart from the ecclesiastical. Our provident Constitution has therefore\r\ntaken care that those who are to instruct presumptuous ignorance, those\r\nwho are to be censors over insolent vice, should neither incur their\r\ncontempt nor live upon their alms; nor will it tempt the rich to a\r\nneglect of the true medicine of their minds. For these reasons, whilst\r\nwe provide first for the poor, and with a parental solicitude, we have\r\nnot relegated religion (like something we were ashamed to show) to\r\nobscure municipalities or rustic villages. No! we will have her to exalt\r\nher mitred front in courts and parliaments. We will have her mixed\r\nthroughout the whole mass of life, and blended with all the classes of\r\nsociety. The people of England will show to the haughty potentates of\r\nthe world, and to their talking sophisters, that a free, a generous, an\r\ninformed nation honors the high magistrates of its Church; that it will\r\nnot suffer the insolence of wealth and titles, or any other species of\r\nproud pretension, to look down with scorn upon what they look up to with\r\nreverence, nor presume to trample on that acquired personal nobility\r\nwhich they intend always to be, and which often is, the fruit, not the\r\nreward, (for what can be the reward?) of learning, piety, and virtue.\r\nThey can see, without pain or grudging, an archbishop precede a duke.\r\nThey can see a bishop of Durham or a bishop of Winchester in possession\r\nof ten thousand pounds a year, and cannot conceive why it is in worse\r\nhands than estates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that\r\nsquire; although it may be true that so many dogs and horses are not\r\nkept by the former, and fed with the victuals which ought to nourish the\r\nchildren of the people. It is true, the whole Church revenue is not\r\nalways employed, and to every shilling, in charity; nor perhaps ought\r\nit; but something is generally so employed. It is better to cherish\r\nvirtue and humanity, by leaving much to free will, even with some loss\r\nto the object, than to attempt to make men mere machines and instruments\r\nof a political benevolence. The world on the whole will gain by a\r\nliberty without which virtue cannot exist.\r\n\r\nWhen once the commonwealth has established the estates of the Church as\r\nproperty, it can consistently hear nothing of the more or the less. Too\r\nmuch and too little are treason against property. What evil can arise\r\nfrom the quantity in any hand, whilst the supreme authority has the\r\nfull, sovereign superintendence over this, as over any property, to\r\nprevent every species of abuse,--and whenever it notably deviates, to\r\ngive to it a direction agreeable to the purposes of its institution?\r\n\r\nIn England most of us conceive that it is envy and malignity towards\r\nthose who are often the beginners of their own fortune, and not a love\r\nof the self-denial and mortification of the ancient Church, that makes\r\nsome look askance at the distinctions and honors and revenues which,\r\ntaken from no person, are set apart for virtue. The ears of the people\r\nof England are distinguishing. They hear these men speak broad. Their\r\ntongue betrays them. Their language is in the _patois_ of fraud, in the\r\ncant and gibberish of hypocrisy. The people of England must think so,\r\nwhen these praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive\r\nevangelic poverty which in the spirit ought always to exist in them,\r\n(and in us, too, however we may like it,) but in the thing must be\r\nvaried, when the relation of that body to the state is altered,--when\r\nmanners, when modes of life, when indeed the whole order of human\r\naffairs, has undergone a total revolution. We shall believe those\r\nreformers to be then honest enthusiasts, not, as now we think them,\r\ncheats and deceivers, when we see them throwing their own goods into\r\ncommon, and submitting their own persons to the austere discipline of\r\nthe early Church.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas rooted in their minds, the Commons of Great Britain, in\r\nthe national emergencies, will never seek their resource from the\r\nconfiscation of the estates of the Church and poor. Sacrilege and\r\nproscription are not among the ways and means of our Committee of\r\nSupply. The Jews in Change Alley have not yet dared to hint their hopes\r\nof a mortgage on the revenues belonging to the see of Canterbury. I am\r\nnot afraid that I shall be disavowed, when I assure you that there is\r\nnot _one_ public man in this kingdom, whom you wish to quote,--no, not\r\none, of any party or description,--who does not reprobate the dishonest,\r\nperfidious, and cruel confiscation which the National Assembly has been\r\ncompelled to make of that property which it was their first duty to\r\nprotect.\r\n\r\nIt is with the exultation of a little national pride I tell you that\r\nthose amongst us who have wished to pledge the societies of Paris in the\r\ncup of their abominations have been disappointed. The robbery of your\r\nChurch has proved a security to the possessions of ours. It has roused\r\nthe people. They see with horror and alarm that enormous and shameless\r\nact of proscription. It has opened, and will more and more open, their\r\neyes upon the selfish enlargement of mind and the narrow liberality of\r\nsentiment of insidious men, which, commencing in close hypocrisy and\r\nfraud, have ended in open violence and rapine. At home we behold similar\r\nbeginnings. We are on our guard against similar conclusions.\r\n\r\nI hope we shall never be so totally lost to all sense of the duties\r\nimposed upon us by the law of social union, as, upon any pretest of\r\npublic service, to confiscate the goods of a single unoffending citizen.\r\nWho but a tyrant (a name expressive of everything which can vitiate and\r\ndegrade human nature) could think of seizing on the property of men,\r\nunaccused, unheard, untried, by whole descriptions, by hundreds and\r\nthousands together? Who that had not lost every trace of humanity could\r\nthink of casting down men of exalted rank and sacred function, some of\r\nthem of an age to call at once for reverence and compassion,--of casting\r\nthem down from the highest situation in the commonwealth, wherein they\r\nwere maintained by their own landed property, to a state of indigence,\r\ndepression, and contempt?\r\n\r\nThe confiscators truly have made some allowance to their victims from\r\nthe scraps and fragments of their own tables, from which they have been\r\nso harshly driven, and which have been so bountifully spread for a feast\r\nto the harpies of usury. But to drive men from independence to live on\r\nalms is itself great cruelty. That which might be a tolerable condition\r\nto men in one state of life, and not habituated to other things, may,\r\nwhen all these circumstances are altered, be a dreadful revolution, and\r\none to which a virtuous mind would feel pain in condemning any guilt,\r\nexcept that which would demand the life of the offender. But to many\r\nminds this punishment of _degradation_ and _infamy_ is worse than death.\r\nUndoubtedly it is an infinite aggravation of this cruel suffering, that\r\nthe persons who were taught a double prejudice in favor of religion, by\r\neducation, and by the place they held in the administration of its\r\nfunctions, are to receive the remnants of their property as alms from\r\nthe profane and impious hands of those who had plundered them of all the\r\nrest,--to receive (if they are at all to receive) not from the\r\ncharitable contributions of the faithful, but from the insolent\r\ntenderness of known and avowed atheism, the maintenance of religion,\r\nmeasured out to them on the standard of the contempt in which it is\r\nheld, and for the purpose of rendering those who receive the allowance\r\nvile and of no estimation in the eyes of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut this act of seizure of property, it seems, is a judgment in law, and\r\nnot a confiscation. They have, it seems, found out in the academies of\r\nthe Palais Royal and the Jacobins, that certain men had no right to the\r\npossessions which they held under law, usage, the decisions of courts,\r\nand the accumulated prescription of a thousand years. They say that\r\necclesiastics are fictitious persons, creatures of the state, whom at\r\npleasure they may destroy, and of course limit and modify in every\r\nparticular; that the goods they possess are not properly theirs, but\r\nbelong to the state which created the fiction; and we are therefore not\r\nto trouble ourselves with what they may suffer in their natural feelings\r\nand natural persons on account of what is done towards them in this\r\ntheir constructive character. Of what import is it, under what names you\r\ninjure men, and deprive them of the just emoluments of a profession in\r\nwhich they were not only permitted, but encouraged by the state to\r\nengage, and upon the supposed certainty of which emoluments they had\r\nformed the plan of their lives, contracted debts, and led multitudes to\r\nan entire dependence upon them?\r\n\r\nYou do not imagine, Sir, that I am going to compliment this miserable\r\ndistinction of persons with any long discussion. The arguments of\r\ntyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful. Had not your\r\nconfiscators by their early crimes obtained a power which secures\r\nindemnity to all the crimes of which they have since been guilty, or\r\nthat they can commit, it is not the syllogism of the logician, but the\r\nlash of the executioner, that would have refuted a sophistry which\r\nbecomes an accomplice of theft and murder. The sophistic tyrants of\r\nParis are loud in their declamations against the departed regal tyrants\r\nwho in former ages have vexed the world. They are thus bold, because\r\nthey are safe from the dungeons and iron cages of their old masters.\r\nShall we be more tender of the tyrants of our own time, when we see them\r\nacting worse tragedies under our eyes? Shall we not use the same liberty\r\nthat they do, when we can use it with the same safety, when to speak\r\nhonest truth only requires a contempt of the opinions of those whose\r\nactions we abhor?\r\n\r\nThis outrage on all the rights of property was at first covered with\r\nwhat, on the system of their conduct, was the most astonishing of all\r\npretexts,--a regard to national faith. The enemies to property at first\r\npretended a most tender, delicate, and scrupulous anxiety for keeping\r\nthe king's engagements with the public creditor. These professors of the\r\nrights of men are so busy in teaching others, that they have not leisure\r\nto learn anything themselves; otherwise they would have known that it is\r\nto the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor\r\nof the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is\r\npledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title,\r\nsuperior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by\r\nacquisition, or by descent, or in virtue of a participation in the goods\r\nof some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or\r\nimplied. They never so much as entered into his head, when he made his\r\nbargain. He well knew that the public, whether represented by a monarch\r\nor by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can\r\nhave no public estate, except in what it derives from a just and\r\nproportioned imposition upon the citizens at large. This was engaged,\r\nand nothing else could be engaged, to the public creditor. No man can\r\nmortgage his injustice as a pawn for his fidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid some observation on the contradictions, caused\r\nby the extreme rigor and the extreme laxity of this new public faith,\r\nwhich influenced in this transaction, and which influenced not according\r\nto the nature of the obligation, but to the description of the persons\r\nto whom it was engaged. No acts of the old government of the kings of\r\nFrance are held valid in the National Assembly, except its pecuniary\r\nengagements: acts of all others of the most ambiguous legality. The rest\r\nof the acts of that royal government are considered in so odious a light\r\nthat to have a claim under its authority is looked on as a sort of\r\ncrime. A pension, given as a reward for service to the state, is surely\r\nas good a ground of property as any security for money advanced to the\r\nstate. It is a better; for money is paid, and well paid, to obtain that\r\nservice. We have, however, seen multitudes of people under this\r\ndescription in France, who never had been deprived of their allowances\r\nby the most arbitrary ministers in the most arbitrary times, by this\r\nassembly of the rights of men robbed without mercy. They were told, in\r\nanswer to their claim to the bread earned with their blood, that their\r\nservices had not been rendered to the country that now exists.\r\n\r\nThis laxity of public faith is not confined to those unfortunate\r\npersons. The Assembly, with perfect consistency, it must be owned, is\r\nengaged in a respectable deliberation how far it is bound by the\r\ntreaties made with other nations under the former government; and their\r\ncommittee is to report which of them they ought to ratify, and which\r\nnot. By this means they have put the external fidelity of this virgin\r\nstate on a par with its internal.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to conceive upon what rational principle the royal\r\ngovernment should not, of the two, rather have possessed the power of\r\nrewarding service and making treaties, in virtue of its prerogative,\r\nthan that of pledging to creditors the revenue of the state, actual and\r\npossible. The treasure of the nation, of all things, has been the least\r\nallowed to the prerogative of the king of France, or to the prerogative\r\nof any king in Europe. To mortgage the public revenue implies the\r\nsovereign dominion, in the fullest sense, over the public purse. It goes\r\nfar beyond the trust even of a temporary and occasional taxation. The\r\nacts, however, of that dangerous power (the distinctive mark of a\r\nboundless despotism) have been alone held sacred. Whence arose this\r\npreference given by a democratic assembly to a body of property deriving\r\nits title from the most critical and obnoxious of all the exertions of\r\nmonarchical authority? Reason can furnish nothing to reconcile\r\ninconsistency; nor can partial favor be accounted for upon equitable\r\nprinciples. But the contradiction and partiality which admit no\r\njustification are not the less without an adequate cause; and that cause\r\nI do not think it difficult to discover.\r\n\r\nBy the vast debt of France a great moneyed interest has insensibly grown\r\nup, and with it a great power. By the ancient usages which prevailed in\r\nthat kingdom, the general circulation of property, and in particular the\r\nmutual convertibility of land into money and of money into land, had\r\nalways been a matter of difficulty. Family settlements, rather more\r\ngeneral and more strict than they are in England, the _jus retractûs_,\r\nthe great mass of landed property held by the crown, and, by a maxim of\r\nthe French law, held unalienably, the vast estates of the ecclesiastic\r\ncorporations,--all these had kept the landed and moneyed interests more\r\nseparated in France, less miscible, and the owners of the two distinct\r\nspecies of property not so well disposed to each other as they are in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe moneyed property was long looked on with rather an evil eye by the\r\npeople. They saw it connected with their distresses, and aggravating\r\nthem. It was no less envied by the old landed interests,--partly for the\r\nsame reasons that rendered it obnoxious to the people, but much more so\r\nas it eclipsed, by the splendor of an ostentatious luxury, the unendowed\r\npedigrees and naked titles of several among the nobility. Even when the\r\nnobility, which represented the more permanent landed interest, united\r\nthemselves by marriage (which sometimes was the case) with the other\r\ndescription, the wealth which saved the family from ruin was supposed to\r\ncontaminate and degrade it. Thus the enmities and heart burnings of\r\nthese parties were increased even by the usual means by which discord is\r\nmade to cease and quarrels are turned into friendship. In the mean time,\r\nthe pride of the wealthy men, not noble, or newly noble, increased with\r\nits cause. They felt with resentment an inferiority the grounds of which\r\nthey did not acknowledge. There was no measure to which they were not\r\nwilling to lend themselves, in order to be revenged of the outrages of\r\nthis rival pride, and to exalt their wealth to what they considered as\r\nits natural rank and estimation. They struck at the nobility through the\r\ncrown and the Church. They attacked them particularly on the side on\r\nwhich they thought them the most vulnerable,--that is, the possessions\r\nof the Church, which, through the patronage of the crown, generally\r\ndevolved upon the nobility. The bishoprics and the great commendatory\r\nabbeys were, with few exceptions, held by that order.\r\n\r\nIn this state of real, though not always perceived, warfare between the\r\nnoble ancient landed interest and the new moneyed interest, the\r\ngreatest, because the most applicable, strength was in the hands of the\r\nlatter. The moneyed interest is in its nature more ready for any\r\nadventure, and its possessors more disposed to new enterprises of any\r\nkind. Being of a recent acquisition, it falls in more naturally with any\r\nnovelties. It is therefore the kind of wealth which will be resorted to\r\nby all who wish for change.\r\n\r\nAlong with the moneyed interest, a new description of men had grown up,\r\nwith whom that interest soon formed a close and marked union: I mean the\r\npolitical men of letters. Men of letters, fond of distinguishing\r\nthemselves, are rarely averse to innovation. Since the decline of the\r\nlife and greatness of Louis the Fourteenth, they were not so much\r\ncultivated either by him, or by the Regent, or the successors to the\r\ncrown; nor were they engaged to the court by favors and emoluments so\r\nsystematically as during the splendid period of that ostentatious and\r\nnot impolitic reign. What they lost in the old court protection they\r\nendeavored to make up by joining in a sort of incorporation of their\r\nown; to which the two academies of France, and afterwards the vast\r\nundertaking of the Encyclopædia, carried on by a society of these\r\ngentlemen, did not a little contribute.\r\n\r\nThe literary cabal had some years ago formed something like a regular\r\nplan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they\r\npursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in\r\nthe propagators of some system of piety. They were possessed with a\r\nspirit of proselytism in the most fanatical degree,--and from thence, by\r\nan easy progress, with the spirit of persecution according to their\r\nmeans.[97] What was not to be done towards their great end by any direct\r\nor immediate act might be wrought by a longer process through the medium\r\nof opinion. To command that opinion, the first step is to establish a\r\ndominion over those who direct it. They contrived to possess themselves,\r\nwith great method and perseverance, of all the avenues to literary fame.\r\nMany of them, indeed, stood high in the ranks of literature and science.\r\nThe world had done them justice, and in favor of general talents forgave\r\nthe evil tendency of their peculiar principles. This was true\r\nliberality; which they returned by endeavoring to confine the reputation\r\nof sense, learning, and taste to themselves or their followers. I will\r\nventure to say that this narrow, exclusive spirit has not been less\r\nprejudicial to literature and to taste than to morals and true\r\nphilosophy. These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own; and\r\nthey have learnt to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk. But in\r\nsome things they are men of the world. The resources of intrigue are\r\ncalled in to supply the defects of argument and wit. To this system of\r\nliterary monopoly was joined an unremitting industry to blacken and\r\ndiscredit in every way, and by every means, all those who did not hold\r\nto their faction. To those who have observed the spirit of their conduct\r\nit has long been clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying\r\nthe intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a persecution which\r\nwould strike at property, liberty, and life.\r\n\r\nThe desultory and faint persecution carried on against them, more from\r\ncompliance with form and decency than with serious resentment, neither\r\nweakened their strength nor relaxed their efforts. The issue of the\r\nwhole was, that, what with opposition, and what with success, a violent\r\nand malignant zeal, of a kind hitherto unknown in the world, had taken\r\nan entire possession of their minds, and rendered their whole\r\nconversation, which otherwise would have been pleasing and instructive,\r\nperfectly disgusting. A spirit of cabal, intrigue, and proselytism\r\npervaded all their thoughts, words, and actions. And as controversial\r\nzeal soon turns its thoughts on force, they began to insinuate\r\nthemselves into a correspondence with foreign princes,--in hopes,\r\nthrough their authority, which at first they flattered, they might\r\nbring about the changes they had in view. To them it was indifferent\r\nwhether these changes were to be accomplished by the thunderbolt of\r\ndespotism or by the earthquake of popular commotion. The correspondence\r\nbetween this cabal and the late king of Prussia will throw no small\r\nlight upon the spirit of all their proceedings.[98] For the same purpose\r\nfor which they intrigued with princes, they cultivated, in a\r\ndistinguished manner, the moneyed interest of France; and partly through\r\nthe means furnished by those whose peculiar offices gave them the most\r\nextensive and certain means of communication, they carefully occupied\r\nall the avenues to opinion.\r\n\r\nWriters, especially when they act in a body and with one direction, have\r\ngreat influence on the public mind; the alliance, therefore, of these\r\nwriters with the moneyed interest[99] had no small effect in removing\r\nthe popular odium and envy which attended that species of wealth. These\r\nwriters, like the propagators of all novelties, pretended to a great\r\nzeal for the poor and the lower orders, whilst in their satires they\r\nrendered hateful, by every exaggeration, the faults of courts, of\r\nnobility, and of priesthood. They became a sort of demagogues. They\r\nserved as a link to unite, in favor of one object, obnoxious wealth to\r\nrestless and desperate poverty.\r\n\r\nAs these two kinds of men appear principal leaders in all the late\r\ntransactions, their junction and politics will serve to account, not\r\nupon any principles of law or of policy, but as a _cause_, for the\r\ngeneral fury with which all the landed property of ecclesiastical\r\ncorporations has been attacked, and the great care which, contrary to\r\ntheir pretended principles, has been taken of a moneyed interest\r\noriginating from the authority of the crown. All the envy against wealth\r\nand power was artificially directed against other descriptions of\r\nriches. On what other principle than that which I have stated can we\r\naccount for an appearance so extraordinary and unnatural as that of the\r\necclesiastical possessions, which had stood so many successions of ages\r\nand shocks of civil violences, and were guarded at once by justice and\r\nby prejudice, being applied to the payment of debts comparatively\r\nrecent, invidious, and contracted by a decried and subverted government?\r\n\r\nWas the public estate a sufficient stake for the public debts? Assume\r\nthat it was not, and that a loss _must_ be incurred somewhere. When the\r\nonly estate lawfully possessed, and which the contracting parties had in\r\ncontemplation at the time in which their bargain was made, happens to\r\nfail, who, according to the principles of natural and legal equity,\r\nought to be the sufferer? Certainly it ought to be either the party who\r\ntrusted, or the party who persuaded him to trust, or both; and not third\r\nparties who had no concern with the transaction. Upon any insolvency,\r\nthey ought to suffer who were weak enough to lend upon bad security, or\r\nthey who fraudulently held out a security that was not valid. Laws are\r\nacquainted with no other rules of decision. But by the new institute of\r\nthe rights of men, the only persons who in equity ought to suffer are\r\nthe only persons who are to be saved harmless: those are to answer the\r\ndebt who neither were lenders nor borrowers, mortgagers nor mortgagees.\r\n\r\nWhat had the clergy to do with these transactions? What had they to do\r\nwith any public engagement further than the extent of their own debt? To\r\nthat, to be sure, their estates were bound to the last acre. Nothing can\r\nlead more to the true spirit of the Assembly, which sits for public\r\nconfiscation with its new equity and its new morality, than an attention\r\nto their proceeding with regard to this debt of the clergy. The body of\r\nconfiscators, true to that moneyed interest for which they were false to\r\nevery other, have found the clergy competent to incur a legal debt. Of\r\ncourse they declared them legally entitled to the property which their\r\npower of incurring the debt and mortgaging the estate implied:\r\nrecognizing the rights of those persecuted citizens in the very act in\r\nwhich they were thus grossly violated.\r\n\r\nIf, as I said, any persons are to mate good deficiencies to the public\r\ncreditor, besides the public at large, they must be those who managed\r\nthe agreement. Why, therefore, are not the estates of all the\r\ncomptrollers-general confiscated?[100] Why not those of the long\r\nsuccession of ministers, financiers, and bankers who have been enriched\r\nwhilst the nation was impoverished by their dealings and their counsels?\r\nWhy is not the estate of M. Laborde declared forfeited rather than of\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris, who has had nothing to do in the creation or in\r\nthe jobbing of the public funds? Or, if you must confiscate old landed\r\nestates in favor of the money-jobbers, why is the penalty confined to\r\none description? I do not know whether the expenses of the Duke de\r\nChoiseul have left anything of the infinite sums which he had derived\r\nfrom the bounty of his master, during the transactions of a reign which\r\ncontributed largely, by every species of prodigality in war and peace,\r\nto the present debt of France. If any such remains, why is not this\r\nconfiscated? I remember to have been in Paris during the time of the old\r\ngovernment. I was there just after the Duke d'Aiguillon had been\r\nsnatched (as it was generally thought) from the block by the hand of a\r\nprotecting despotism. He was a minister, and had some concern in the\r\naffairs of that prodigal period. Why do I not see his estate delivered\r\nup to the municipalities in which it is situated? The noble family of\r\nNoailles have long been servants (meritorious servants I admit) to the\r\ncrown of France, and have had of course some share in its bounties. Why\r\ndo I hear nothing of the application of their estates to the public\r\ndebt? Why is the estate of the Duke de Rochefoucault more sacred than\r\nthat of the Cardinal de Rochefoucault? The former is, I doubt not, a\r\nworthy person; and (if it were not a sort of profaneness to talk of the\r\nuse, as affecting the title to property) he makes a good use of his\r\nrevenues; but it is no disrespect to him to say, what authentic\r\ninformation well warrants me in saying, that the use made of a property\r\nequally valid, by his brother,[101] the Cardinal Archbishop of Rouen,\r\nwas far more laudable and far more public-spirited. Can one hear of the\r\nproscription of such persons, and the confiscation of their effects,\r\nwithout indignation, and horror? He is not a man who does not feel such\r\nemotions on such occasions. He does not deserve the name of a free man\r\nwho will not express them.\r\n\r\nFew barbarous conquerors have ever made so terrible a revolution in\r\nproperty. None of the heads of the Roman factions, when they established\r\n_crudelem illam hastam_ in all their auctions of rapine, have ever set\r\nup to sale the goods of the conquered citizen to such an enormous\r\namount. It must be allowed in favor of those tyrants of antiquity, that\r\nwhat was done by them could hardly be said to be done in cold blood.\r\nTheir passions were inflamed, their tempers soured, their understandings\r\nconfused with the spirit of revenge, with the innumerable reciprocated\r\nand recent inflictions and retaliations of blood and rapine. They were\r\ndriven beyond all bounds of moderation by the apprehension of the return\r\nof power with the return of property to the families of those they had\r\ninjured beyond all hope of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThese Roman confiscators, who were yet only in the elements of tyranny,\r\nand were not instructed in the rights of men to exercise all sorts of\r\ncruelties on each other without provocation, thought it necessary to\r\nspread a sort of color over their injustice. They considered the\r\nvanquished party as composed of traitors, who had borne arms, or\r\notherwise had acted with hostility, against the commonwealth. They\r\nregarded them as persons who had forfeited their property by their\r\ncrimes. With you, in your improved state of the human mind, there was no\r\nsuch formality. You seized upon five millions sterling of annual rent,\r\nand turned forty or fifty thousand human creatures out of their houses,\r\nbecause \"such was your pleasure.\" The tyrant Harry the Eighth of\r\nEngland, as he was not better enlightened than the Roman Mariuses and\r\nSyllas, and had not studied in your new schools, did not know what an\r\neffectual instrument of despotism was to be found in that grand\r\nmagazine of offensive weapons, the rights of men. When he resolved to\r\nrob the abbeys, as the club of the Jacobins have robbed all the\r\necclesiastics, he began by setting on foot a commission to examine into\r\nthe crimes and abuses which prevailed in those communities. As it might\r\nbe expected, his commission reported truths, exaggerations, and\r\nfalsehoods. But truly or falsely, it reported abuses and offences.\r\nHowever, as abuses might be corrected, as every crime of persons does\r\nnot infer a forfeiture with regard to communities, and as property, in\r\nthat dark age, was not discovered to be a creature of prejudice, all\r\nthose abuses (and there were enough of them) were hardly thought\r\nsufficient ground for such a confiscation as it was for his purposes to\r\nmake. He therefore procured the formal surrender of these estates. All\r\nthese operose proceedings were adopted by one of the most decided\r\ntyrants in the rolls of history, as necessary preliminaries, before he\r\ncould venture, by bribing the members of his two servile Houses with a\r\nshare of the spoil, and holding out to them an eternal immunity from\r\ntaxation, to demand a confirmation of his iniquitous proceedings by an\r\nact of Parliament. Had fate reserved him to our times, four technical\r\nterms would have done his business, and saved him all this trouble; he\r\nneeded nothing more than one short form of incantation:--\"_Philosophy,\r\nLight, Liberality, the Rights of Men_.\"\r\n\r\nI can say nothing in praise of those acts of tyranny, which no voice has\r\nhitherto ever commended under any of their false colors; yet in these\r\nfalse colors an homage was paid by despotism to justice. The power which\r\nwas above all fear and all remorse was not set above all shame. Whilst\r\nshame keeps its watch, virtue is not wholly extinguished in the heart,\r\nnor will moderation be utterly exiled from the minds of tyrants.\r\n\r\nI believe every honest man sympathizes in his reflections with our\r\npolitical poet on that occasion, and will pray to avert the omen,\r\nwhenever these acts of rapacious despotism present themselves to his\r\nview or his imagination:--\r\n\r\n                      \"May no such storm\r\n    Fall on our times, where rain must reform!\r\n    Tell me, my Muse, what monstrous, dire offence,\r\n    What crime could any Christian king incense\r\n    To such a rage? Was't luxury, or lust\r\n    Was _he_ so temperate, so chaste, so just?\r\n    Were these their crimes? They were his own much more:\r\n    But wealth is crime enough to him that's poor.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThis same wealth, which is at all times treason and _lèze-nation_ to\r\nindigent and rapacious despotism, under all modes of polity, was your\r\ntemptation to violate property, law, and religion, united in one\r\nobject. But was the state of France so wretched and undone, that no\r\nother resource but rapine remained to preserve its existence? On this\r\npoint I wish to receive some information. When the States met, was the\r\ncondition of the finances of France such, that, after economizing, on\r\nprinciples of justice and mercy, through all departments, no fair\r\nrepartition of burdens upon all the orders could possibly restore them?\r\nIf such an equal imposition would have been sufficient, you well know it\r\nmight easily have been made. M. Necker, in the budget which he laid\r\nbefore the orders assembled at Versailles, made a detailed exposition of\r\nthe state of the French nation.[103]\r\n\r\nIf we give credit to him, it was not necessary to have recourse to any\r\nnew impositions whatsoever, to put the receipts of France on a balance\r\nwith its expenses. He stated the permanent charges of all descriptions,\r\nincluding the interest of a new loan of four hundred millions, at\r\n531,444,000 livres; the fixed revenue at 475,294,000: making the\r\ndeficiency 56,150,000, or short of 2,200,000 _l._ sterling. But to\r\nbalance it, he brought forward savings and improvements of revenue\r\n(considered as entirely certain) to rather more than the amount of that\r\ndeficiency; and he concludes with these emphatical words (p. 39):--\"Quel\r\npays, Messieurs, que celui, où, _sans impôts_ et avec de simples objets\r\n_inaperçus_, on peut faire disparoître un déficit qui a fait tant de\r\nbruit en Europe!\" As to the reimbursement, the sinking of debt, and the\r\nother great objects of public credit and political arrangement indicated\r\nin Monsieur Necker's speech, no doubt could be entertained but that a\r\nvery moderate and proportioned assessment on the citizens without\r\ndistinction would have provided for all of them to the fullest extent of\r\ntheir demand.\r\n\r\nIf this representation of M. Necker was false, then the Assembly are in\r\nthe highest degree culpable for having forced the king to accept as his\r\nminister, and, since the king's deposition, for having employed as\r\n_their_ minister, a man who had been capable of abusing so notoriously\r\nthe confidence of his master and their own: in a matter, too, of the\r\nhighest moment, and directly appertaining to his particular office. But\r\nif the representation was exact, (as, having always, along with you,\r\nconceived a high degree of respect for M. Necker, I make no doubt it\r\nwas,) then what can be said in favor of those who, instead of moderate,\r\nreasonable, and general contribution, have in cold blood, and impelled\r\nby no necessity, had recourse to a partial and cruel confiscation?\r\n\r\nWas that contribution refused on a pretext of privilege, either on the\r\npart of the clergy, or on that of the nobility? No, certainly. As to the\r\nclergy, they even ran before the wishes of the third order. Previous to\r\nthe meeting of the States, they had in all their instructions expressly\r\ndirected their deputies to renounce every immunity which put them upon a\r\nfooting distinct from the condition of their fellow-subjects. In this\r\nrenunciation the clergy were even more explicit than the nobility.\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that the deficiency had remained at the fifty-six\r\nmillions, (or 2,200,000 _l._ sterling,) as at first stated by M. Necker.\r\nLet us allow that all the resources he opposed to that deficiency were\r\nimpudent and groundless fictions, and that the Assembly (or their lords\r\nof articles[104] at the Jacobins) were from thence justified in laying\r\nthe whole burden of that deficiency on the clergy,--yet allowing all\r\nthis, a necessity of 2,200,000 _l._ sterling will not support a\r\nconfiscation to the amount of five millions. The imposition of 2,200,000\r\n_l._ on the clergy, as partial, would have been oppressive and unjust,\r\nbut it would not have been altogether ruinous to those on whom it was\r\nimposed; and therefore it would not have answered the real purpose of\r\nthe managers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps persons unacquainted with the state of France, on hearing the\r\nclergy and the noblesse were privileged in point of taxation, may be led\r\nto imagine, that, previous to the Revolution, these bodies had\r\ncontributed nothing to the state. This is a great mistake. They\r\ncertainly did not contribute equally with each other, nor either of them\r\nequally with the commons. They both, however, contributed largely.\r\nNeither nobility nor clergy enjoyed any exemption from the excise on\r\nconsumable commodities, from duties of custom, or from any of the other\r\nnumerous _indirect_ impositions, which in France, as well as here, make\r\nso very large a proportion of all payments to the public. The noblesse\r\npaid the capitation. They paid also a land-tax, called the twentieth\r\npenny, to the height sometimes of three, sometimes of four shillings in\r\nthe pound: both of them _direct_ impositions, of no light nature, and no\r\ntrivial produce. The clergy of the provinces annexed by conquest to\r\nFrance (which in extent make about an eighth part of the whole, but in\r\nwealth a much larger proportion) paid likewise to the capitation and the\r\ntwentieth penny, at the rate paid by the nobility. The clergy in the old\r\nprovinces did not pay the capitation; but they had redeemed themselves\r\nat the expense of about twenty-four millions, or a little more than a\r\nmillion sterling. They were exempted from the twentieths: but then they\r\nmade free gifts; they contracted debts for the state; and they were\r\nsubject to some other charges, the whole computed at about a thirteenth\r\npart of their clear income. They ought to have paid annually about forty\r\nthousand pounds more, to put them on a par with the contribution of the\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nWhen the terrors of this tremendous proscription hung over the clergy,\r\nthey made an offer of a contribution, through the Archbishop of Aix,\r\nwhich, for its extravagance, ought not to have been accepted. But it was\r\nevidently and obviously more advantageous to the public creditor than\r\nanything which could rationally be promised by the confiscation. Why was\r\nit not accepted? The reason is plain:--There was no desire that the\r\nChurch should be brought to serve the State. The service of the State\r\nwas made a pretext to destroy the Church. In their way to the\r\ndestruction of the Church they would not scruple to destroy their\r\ncountry: and they have destroyed it. One great end in the project would\r\nhave been defeated, if the plan of extortion had been adopted in lieu of\r\nthe scheme of confiscation. The new landed interest connected with the\r\nnew republic, and connected with it for its very being, could not have\r\nbeen created. This was among the reasons why that extravagant ransom was\r\nnot accepted.\r\n\r\nThe madness of the project of confiscation, on the plan that was first\r\npretended, soon became apparent. To bring this unwieldy mass of landed\r\nproperty, enlarged by the confiscation of all the vast landed domain of\r\nthe crown, at once into market was obviously to defeat the profits\r\nproposed by the confiscation, by depreciating the value of those lands,\r\nand indeed of all the landed estates throughout France. Such a sudden\r\ndiversion of all its circulating money from trade to land must be an\r\nadditional mischief. What step was taken? Did the Assembly, on becoming\r\nsensible of the inevitable ill effects of their projected sale, revert\r\nto the offers of the clergy? No distress could oblige them to travel in\r\na course which was disgraced by any appearance of justice. Giving over\r\nall hopes from a general immediate sale, another project seems to have\r\nsucceeded. They proposed to take stock in exchange for the Church lands.\r\nIn that project great difficulties arose in equalizing the objects to be\r\nexchanged. Other obstacles also presented themselves, which threw them\r\nback again upon some project of sale. The municipalities had taken an\r\nalarm. They would not hear of transferring the whole plunder of the\r\nkingdom to the stockholders in Paris. Many of those municipalities had\r\nbeen (upon system) reduced to the most deplorable indigence. Money was\r\nnowhere to be seen. They were therefore led to the point that was so\r\nardently desired. They panted for a currency of any kind which might\r\nrevive their perishing industry. The municipalities were, then, to be\r\nadmitted to a share in the spoil, which evidently rendered the first\r\nscheme (if ever it had been seriously entertained) altogether\r\nimpracticable. Public exigencies pressed upon all sides. The Minister of\r\nFinance reiterated his call for supply with, a most urgent, anxious, and\r\nboding voice. Thus pressed on all sides, instead of the first plan of\r\nconverting their bankers into bishops and abbots, instead of paying the\r\nold debt, they contracted a new debt, at three per cent, creating a new\r\npaper currency, founded on an eventual sale of the Church lands. They\r\nissued this paper currency to satisfy in the first instance chiefly the\r\ndemands made upon them by the _bank of discount_, the great machine or\r\npaper-mill of their fictitious wealth.\r\n\r\nThe spoil of the Church was now become the only resource of all their\r\noperations in finance, the vital principle of all their politics, the\r\nsole security for the existence of their power. It was necessary, by\r\nall, even the most violent means, to put every individual on the same\r\nbottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty interest to uphold this\r\nact, and the authority of those by whom it was done. In order to force\r\nthe most reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rendered\r\ntheir paper circulation compulsory in all payments. Those who consider\r\nthe general tendency of their schemes to this one object as a centre,\r\nand a centre from which afterwards all their measures radiate, will not\r\nthink that I dwell too long upon this part of the proceedings of the\r\nNational Assembly.\r\n\r\nTo cut off all appearance of connection between the crown and public\r\njustice, and to bring the whole under implicit obedience to the\r\ndictators in Paris, the old independent judicature of the Parliaments,\r\nwith all its merits and all its faults, was wholly abolished. Whilst the\r\nParliaments existed, it was evident that the people might some time or\r\nother come to resort to them, and rally under the standard of their\r\nancient laws. It became, however, a matter of consideration, that the\r\nmagistrates and officers in the courts now abolished _had purchased\r\ntheir places_ at a very high rate, for which, as well as for the duty\r\nthey performed, they received but a very low return of interest. Simple\r\nconfiscation is a boon only for the clergy: to the lawyers some\r\nappearances of equity are to be observed; and they are to receive\r\ncompensation to an immense amount. Their compensation becomes part of\r\nthe national debt, for the liquidation of which there is the one\r\nexhaustless fund. The lawyers are to obtain their compensation in the\r\nnew Church paper, which is to march with the new principles of\r\njudicature and legislature. The dismissed magistrates are to take their\r\nshare of martyrdom with the ecclesiastics, or to receive their own\r\nproperty from such a fund and in such a manner as all those who have\r\nbeen seasoned with the ancient principles of jurisprudence, and had been\r\nthe sworn guardians of property, must look upon with horror. Even the\r\nclergy are to receive their miserable allowance out of the depreciated\r\npaper, which is stamped with the indelible character of sacrilege, and\r\nwith the symbols of their own ruin, or they must starve. So violent an\r\noutrage upon credit, property, and liberty, as this compulsory paper\r\ncurrency, has seldom been exhibited by the alliance of bankruptcy and\r\ntyranny, at any time, or in any nation.\r\n\r\nIn the course of all these operations, at length comes out the grand\r\n_arcanum_,--that in reality, and in a fair sense, the lands of the\r\nChurch (so far as anything certain can be gathered from their\r\nproceedings) are not to be sold at all. By the late resolutions of the\r\nNational Assembly, they are, indeed, to be delivered to the highest\r\nbidder. But it is to be observed, that _a certain portion only of the\r\npurchase-money is to be laid down_. A period of twelve years is to be\r\ngiven for the payment of the rest. The philosophic purchasers are\r\ntherefore, on payment of a sort of fine, to be put instantly into\r\npossession of the estate. It becomes in some respects a sort of gift to\r\nthem,--to be held on the feudal tenure of zeal to the new establishment.\r\nThis project is evidently to let in a body of purchasers without money.\r\nThe consequence will be, that these purchasers, or rather grantees, will\r\npay, not only from the rents as they accrue, which might as well be\r\nreceived by the state, but from the spoil of the materials of buildings,\r\nfrom waste in woods, and from whatever money, by hands habituated to the\r\ngripings of usury, they can wring from the miserable peasant. He is to\r\nbe delivered over to the mercenary and arbitrary discretion of men who\r\nwill be stimulated to every species of extortion by the growing demands\r\non the growing profits of an estate held under the precarious\r\nsettlement of a new political system.\r\n\r\nWhen all the frauds, impostures, violences, rapines, burnings, murders,\r\nconfiscations, compulsory paper currencies, and every description of\r\ntyranny and cruelty employed to bring about and to uphold this\r\nRevolution have their natural effect, that is, to shock the moral\r\nsentiments of all virtuous and sober minds, the abettors of this\r\nphilosophic system immediately strain their throats in a declamation\r\nagainst the old monarchical government of France. When they have\r\nrendered that deposed power sufficiently black, they then proceed in\r\nargument, as if all those who disapprove of their new abuses must of\r\ncourse be partisans of the old,--that those who reprobate their crude\r\nand violent schemes of liberty ought to be treated as advocates for\r\nservitude. I admit that their necessities do compel them to this base\r\nand contemptible fraud. Nothing can reconcile men to their proceedings\r\nand projects but the supposition that there is no third option between\r\nthem and some tyranny as odious as can be furnished by the records of\r\nhistory or by the invention of poets. This prattling of theirs hardly\r\ndeserves the name of sophistry. It is nothing but plain impudence. Have\r\nthese gentlemen never heard, in the whole circle of the worlds of theory\r\nand practice, of anything between the despotism of the monarch and the\r\ndespotism of the multitude? Have they never heard of a monarchy directed\r\nby laws, controlled and balanced by the great hereditary wealth and\r\nhereditary dignity of a nation, and both again controlled by a judicious\r\ncheck from the reason and feeling of the people at large, acting by a\r\nsuitable and permanent organ? Is it, then, impossible that a man may be\r\nfound who, without criminal ill intention or pitiable absurdity, shall\r\nprefer such a mixed and tempered government to either of the\r\nextremes,--and who may repute that nation to be destitute of all wisdom\r\nand of all virtue, which, having in its choice to obtain such a\r\ngovernment with ease, _or rather to confirm it when actually possessed_,\r\nthought proper to commit a thousand crimes, and to subject their country\r\nto a thousand evils, in order to avoid it? Is it, then, a truth so\r\nuniversally acknowledged, that a pure democracy is the only tolerable\r\nform into which human society can be thrown, that a man is not permitted\r\nto hesitate about its merits, without the suspicion of being a friend to\r\ntyranny, that is, of being a foe to mankind?\r\n\r\nI do not know under what description to class the present ruling\r\nauthority in France. It affects to be a pure democracy, though I think\r\nit in a direct train of becoming shortly a mischievous and ignoble\r\noligarchy. But for the present I admit it to be a contrivance of the\r\nnature and effect of what it pretends to. I reprobate no form of\r\ngovernment merely upon abstract principles. There may be situations in\r\nwhich the purely democratic form will become necessary. There may be\r\nsome (very few, and very particularly circumstanced) where it would be\r\nclearly desirable. This I do not take to be the case of France, or of\r\nany other great country. Until now, we have seen no examples of\r\nconsiderable democracies. The ancients were better acquainted with them.\r\nNot being wholly unread in the authors who had seen the most of those\r\nconstitutions, and who best understood them, I cannot help concurring\r\nwith their opinion, that an absolute democracy no more than absolute\r\nmonarchy is to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government.\r\nThey think it rather the corruption and degeneracy than the sound\r\nconstitution of a republic. If I recollect rightly, Aristotle observes,\r\nthat a democracy has many striking points of resemblance with a\r\ntyranny.[105] Of this I am certain, that in a democracy the majority of\r\nthe citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon\r\nthe minority, whenever strong divisions prevail in that kind of polity,\r\nas they often must,--and that oppression of the minority will extend to\r\nfar greater numbers, and will be carried on with much greater fury, than\r\ncan almost ever be apprehended from the dominion of a single sceptre. In\r\nsuch a popular persecution, individual sufferers are in a much more\r\ndeplorable condition than in any other. Under a cruel prince they have\r\nthe balmy compassion of mankind to assuage the smart of their wounds,\r\nthey have the plaudits of the people to animate their generous constancy\r\nunder their sufferings: but those who are subjected to wrong under\r\nmultitudes are deprived of all external consolation; they seem deserted\r\nby mankind, overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole species.\r\n\r\nBut admitting democracy not to have that inevitable tendency to party\r\ntyranny which I suppose it to have, and admitting it to possess as much\r\ngood in it when unmixed as I am sure it possesses when compounded with\r\nother forms; does monarchy, on its part, contain nothing at all to\r\nrecommend it? I do not often quote Bolingbroke, nor have his works in\r\ngeneral left any permanent impression on my mind. He is a presumptuous\r\nand a superficial writer. But he has one observation which in my opinion\r\nis not without depth and solidity. He says that he prefers a monarchy to\r\nother governments, because you can better ingraft any description of\r\nrepublic on a monarchy than anything of monarchy upon the republican\r\nforms. I think him perfectly in the right. The fact is so historically,\r\nand it agrees well with the speculation.\r\n\r\nI know how easy a topic it is to dwell on the faults of departed\r\ngreatness. By a revolution in the state, the fawning sycophant of\r\nyesterday is converted into the austere critic of the present hour. But\r\nsteady, independent minds, when they have an object of so serious a\r\nconcern to mankind as government under their contemplation, will disdain\r\nto assume the part of satirists and declaimers. They will judge of human\r\ninstitutions as they do of human characters. They will sort out the good\r\nfrom the evil, which is mixed in mortal institutions as it is in mortal\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nYour government in France, though usually, and I think justly, reputed\r\nthe best of the unqualified or ill-qualified monarchies, was still full\r\nof abuses. These abuses accumulated in a length of time, as they must\r\naccumulate in every monarchy not under the constant inspection of a\r\npopular representative. I am no stranger to the faults and defects of\r\nthe subverted government of France; and I think I am not inclined by\r\nnature or policy to make a panegyric upon anything which is a just and\r\nnatural object of censure. But the question is not now of the vices of\r\nthat monarchy, but of its existence. Is it, then, true, that the French\r\ngovernment was such as to be incapable or undeserving of reform, so that\r\nit was of absolute necessity the whole fabric should be at once pulled\r\ndown, and the area cleared for the erection of a theoretic, experimental\r\nedifice in its place? All France was of a different opinion in the\r\nbeginning of the year 1789. The instructions to the representatives to\r\nthe States-General, from every district in that kingdom, were filled\r\nwith projects for the reformation of that government, without the\r\nremotest suggestion of a design to destroy it. Had such a design been\r\nthen even insinuated, I believe there would have been but one voice, and\r\nthat voice for rejecting it with scorn and horror. Men have been\r\nsometimes led by degrees, sometimes hurried, into things of which, if\r\nthey could have seen the whole together, they never would have permitted\r\nthe most remote approach. When those instructions were given, there was\r\nno question but that abuses existed, and that they demanded a reform:\r\nnor is there now. In the interval between the instructions and the\r\nRevolution things changed their shape; and in consequence of that\r\nchange, the true question at present is, whether those who would have\r\nreformed or those who have destroyed are in the right.\r\n\r\nTo hear some men speak of the late monarchy of France, you would imagine\r\nthat they were talking of Persia bleeding under the ferocious sword of\r\nThamas Kouli Khân,--or at least describing the barbarous anarchic\r\ndespotism of Turkey, where the finest countries in the most genial\r\nclimates in the world are wasted by peace more than any countries have\r\nbeen worried by war, where arts are unknown, where manufactures\r\nlanguish, where science is extinguished, where agriculture decays, where\r\nthe human race itself melts away and perishes under the eye of the\r\nobserver. Was this the case of France? I have no way of determining the\r\nquestion but by a reference to facts. Facts do not support this\r\nresemblance. Along with much evil, there is some good in monarchy\r\nitself; and some corrective to its evil from religion, from laws, from\r\nmanners, from opinions, the French monarchy must have received, which\r\nrendered it (though by no means a free, and therefore by no means a good\r\nconstitution) a despotism rather in appearance than in reality.\r\n\r\nAmong the standards upon which the effects of government on any country\r\nare to be estimated, I must consider the state of its population as not\r\nthe least certain. No country in which population flourishes, and is in\r\nprogressive improvement, can be under a _very_ mischievous government.\r\nAbout sixty years ago, the Intendants of the Generalities of France\r\nmade, with other matters, a report of the population of their several\r\ndistricts. I have not the books, which are very voluminous, by me, nor\r\ndo I know where to procure them, (I am obliged to speak by memory, and\r\ntherefore the less positively,) but I think the population of France was\r\nby them, even at that period, estimated at twenty-two millions of\r\nsouls. At the end of the last century it had been generally calculated\r\nat eighteen. On either of these estimations, France was not ill-peopled.\r\nM. Necker, who is an authority for his own time at least equal to the\r\nIntendants for theirs, reckons, and upon apparently sure principles, the\r\npeople of France, in the year 1780, at twenty-four millions six hundred\r\nand seventy thousand. But was this the probable ultimate term under the\r\nold establishment? Dr. Price is of opinion that the growth of population\r\nin France was by no means at its acme in that year. I certainly defer to\r\nDr. Price's authority a good deal more in these speculations than I do\r\nin his general politics. This gentleman, taking ground on M. Necker's\r\ndata, is very confident that since the period of that minister's\r\ncalculation the French population has increased rapidly,--so rapidly,\r\nthat in the year 1789 he will not consent to rate the people of that\r\nkingdom at a lower number than thirty millions. After abating much (and\r\nmuch I think ought to be abated) from the sanguine calculation of Dr.\r\nPrice, I have no doubt that the population of France did increase\r\nconsiderably during this latter period: but supposing that it increased\r\nto nothing more than will be sufficient to complete the twenty-four\r\nmillions six hundred and seventy thousand to twenty-five millions, still\r\na population of twenty-five millions, and that in an increasing\r\nprogress, on a space of about twenty-seven thousand square leagues, is\r\nimmense. It is, for instance, a good deal more than the proportionable\r\npopulation of this island, or even than that of England, the best\r\npeopled part of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is not universally true that France is a fertile country.\r\nConsiderable tracts of it are barren, and labor under other natural\r\ndisadvantages. In the portions of that territory where things are more\r\nfavorable, as far as I am able to discover, the numbers of the people\r\ncorrespond to the indulgence of Nature.[106] The Generality of Lisle,\r\n(this I admit is the strongest example,) upon an extent of four hundred\r\nand four leagues and a half, about ten years ago contained seven hundred\r\nand thirty-four thousand six hundred souls, which is one thousand seven\r\nhundred and seventy-two inhabitants to each square league. The middle\r\nterm for the rest of France is about nine hundred inhabitants to the\r\nsame admeasurement.\r\n\r\nI do not attribute this population to the deposed government; because I\r\ndo not like to compliment the contrivances of men with what is due in a\r\ngreat degree to the bounty of Providence. But that decried government\r\ncould not have obstructed, most probably it favored, the operation of\r\nthose causes, (whatever they were,) whether of Nature in the soil, or\r\nhabits of industry among the people, which has produced so large a\r\nnumber of the species throughout that whole kingdom, and exhibited in\r\nsome particular places such prodigies of population. I never will\r\nsuppose that fabric of a state to be the worst of all political\r\ninstitutions which by experience is found to contain a principle\r\nfavorable (however latent it may be) to the increase of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of a country is another, and no contemptible standard, by\r\nwhich we may judge whether, on the whole, a government be protecting or\r\ndestructive. France far exceeds England in the multitude of her people;\r\nbut I apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to\r\nours,--that it is not so equal in the distribution, nor so ready in the\r\ncirculation. I believe the difference in the form of the two governments\r\nto be amongst the causes of this advantage on the side of England: I\r\nspeak of England, not of the whole British dominions,--which, if\r\ncompared with those of France, will in some degree weaken the\r\ncomparative rate of wealth upon our side. But that wealth, which will\r\nnot endure a comparison with the riches of England, may constitute a\r\nvery respectable degree of opulence. M. Necker's book, published in\r\n1785,[107] contains an accurate and interesting collection of facts\r\nrelative to public economy and to political arithmetic; and his\r\nspeculations on the subject are in general wise and liberal. In that\r\nwork he gives an idea of the state of France, very remote from the\r\nportrait of a country whose government was a perfect grievance, an\r\nabsolute evil, admitting no cure but through the violent and uncertain\r\nremedy of a total revolution. He affirms, that from the year 1726 to the\r\nyear 1784 there was coined at the mint of France, in the species of gold\r\nand silver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds\r\nsterling.[108]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that M. Necker should be mistaken in the amount of the\r\nbullion which has been coined in the mint. It is a matter of official\r\nrecord. The reasonings of this able financier concerning the quantity of\r\ngold and silver which remained for circulation, when he wrote in 1785,\r\nthat is, about four years before the deposition and imprisonment of the\r\nFrench king, are not of equal certainty; but they are laid on grounds so\r\napparently solid, that it is not easy to refuse a considerable degree of\r\nassent to his calculation. He calculates the _numéraire_, or what we\r\ncall _specie_, then actually existing in France, at about eighty-eight\r\nmillions of the same English money. A great accumulation of wealth for\r\none country, large as that country is! M. Necker was so far from\r\nconsidering this influx of wealth as likely to cease, when he wrote in\r\n1785, that he presumes upon a future annual increase of two per cent\r\nupon the money brought into France during the periods from which he\r\ncomputed.\r\n\r\nSome adequate cause must have originally introduced all the money coined\r\nat its mint into that kingdom; and some cause as operative must have\r\nkept at home, or returned into its bosom, such a vast flood of treasure\r\nas M. Necker calculates to remain for domestic circulation. Suppose any\r\nreasonable deductions from M. Necker's computation, the remainder must\r\nstill amount to an immense sum. Causes thus powerful to acquire and to\r\nretain cannot be found in discouraged industry, insecure property, and a\r\npositively destructive government. Indeed, when I consider the face of\r\nthe kingdom of France, the multitude and opulence of her cities, the\r\nuseful magnificence of her spacious high-roads and bridges, the\r\nopportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the\r\nconveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so\r\nimmense an extent,--when I turn my eyes to the stupendous works of her\r\nports and harbors, and to her whole naval apparatus, whether for war or\r\ntrade,--when I bring before my view the number of her fortifications,\r\nconstructed with so bold and masterly a skill, and made and maintained\r\nat so prodigious a charge, presenting an armed front and impenetrable\r\nbarrier to her enemies upon every side,--when I recollect how very small\r\na part of that extensive region is without cultivation, and to what\r\ncomplete perfection the culture of many of the best productions of the\r\nearth have been brought in France,--when I reflect on the excellence of\r\nher manufactures and fabrics, second to none but ours, and in some\r\nparticulars not second,--when I contemplate the grand foundations of\r\ncharity, public and private,--when I survey the state of all the arts\r\nthat beautify and polish life,--when I reckon the men she has bled for\r\nextending her fame in war, her able statesmen, the multitude of her\r\nprofound lawyers and theologians, her philosophers, her critics, her\r\nhistorians and antiquaries, her poets and her orators, sacred and\r\nprofane,--I behold in all this something which awes and commands the\r\nimagination, which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and\r\nindiscriminate censure, and which demands that we should very seriously\r\nexamine what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us\r\nat once to level so spacious a fabric with the ground. I do not\r\nrecognize in this view of things the despotism of Turkey. Nor do I\r\ndiscern the character of a government that has been on the whole so\r\noppressive, or so corrupt, or so negligent, as to be utterly unfit _for\r\nall reformation_. I must think such a government well deserved to have\r\nits excellences heightened, its faults corrected, and its capacities\r\nimproved into a British Constitution.\r\n\r\nWhoever has examined into the proceedings of that deposed government\r\nfor several years back cannot fail to have observed, amidst the\r\ninconstancy and fluctuation natural to courts, an earnest endeavor\r\ntowards the prosperity and improvement of the country; he must admit\r\nthat it had long been employed, in some instances wholly to remove, in\r\nmany considerably to correct, the abusive practices and usages that had\r\nprevailed in the state,--and that even the unlimited power of the\r\nsovereign over the persons of his subjects, inconsistent, as undoubtedly\r\nit was, with law and liberty, had yet been every day growing more\r\nmitigated in the exercise. So far from refusing itself to reformation,\r\nthat government was open, with a censurable degree of facility, to all\r\nsorts of projects and projectors on the subject. Rather too much\r\ncountenance was given to the spirit of innovation, which soon was turned\r\nagainst those who fostered it, and ended in their ruin. It is but cold,\r\nand no very flattering justice to that fallen monarchy, to say, that,\r\nfor many years, it trespassed more by levity and want of judgment in\r\nseveral of its schemes than from any defect in diligence or in public\r\nspirit. To compare the government of France for the last fifteen or\r\nsixteen years with wise and well-constituted establishments during that,\r\nor during any period, is not to act with fairness. But if in point of\r\nprodigality in the expenditure of money, or in point of rigor in the\r\nexercise of power, it be compared with any of the former reigns, I\r\nbelieve candid judges will give little credit to the good intentions of\r\nthose who dwell perpetually on the donations to favorites, or on the\r\nexpenses of the court, or on the horrors of the Bastile, in the reign of\r\nLouis the Sixteenth.[109]\r\n\r\nWhether the system, if it deserves such a name, now built on the ruins\r\nof that ancient monarchy, will be able to give a better account of the\r\npopulation and wealth of the country which it has taken under its care,\r\nis a matter very doubtful. Instead of improving by the change, I\r\napprehend that a long series of years must be told, before it can\r\nrecover in any degree the effects of this philosophic Revolution, and\r\nbefore the nation can be replaced on its former footing. If Dr. Price\r\nshould think fit, a few years hence, to favor us with an estimate of the\r\npopulation of France, he will hardly be able to make up his tale of\r\nthirty millions of souls, as computed in 1789, or the Assembly's\r\ncomputation of twenty-six millions of that year, or even M. Necker's\r\ntwenty-five millions in 1780. I hear that there are considerable\r\nemigrations from France,--and that many, quitting that voluptuous\r\nclimate, and that seductive Circean liberty, have taken refuge in the\r\nfrozen regions and under the British despotism of Canada.\r\n\r\nIn the present disappearance of coin, no person could think it the same\r\ncountry in which the present minister of the finances has been able to\r\ndiscover fourscore millions sterling in specie. From its general aspect\r\none would conclude that it had been for some time past under the special\r\ndirection of the learned academicians of Laputa and Balnibarbi.[110]\r\nAlready the population of Paris has so declined, that M. Necker stated\r\nto the National Assembly the provision to be made for its subsistence\r\nat a fifth less than what had formerly been found requisite.[111] It is\r\nsaid (and I have never heard it contradicted) that a hundred thousand\r\npeople are out of employment in that city, though it is become the seat\r\nof the imprisoned court and National Assembly. Nothing, I am credibly\r\ninformed, can exceed the shocking and disgusting spectacle of mendicancy\r\ndisplayed in that capital. Indeed, the votes of the National Assembly\r\nleave no doubt of the fact. They have lately appointed a standing\r\ncommittee of mendicancy. They are contriving at once a vigorous police\r\non this subject, and, for the first time, the imposition of a tax to\r\nmaintain the poor, for whoso present relief great sums appear on the\r\nface of the public accounts of the year.[112] In the mean time the\r\nleaders of the legislative clubs and coffee-houses are intoxicated with\r\nadmiration at their own wisdom and ability. They speak with the most\r\nsovereign contempt of the rest of the world. They toll the people, to\r\ncomfort them in the rags with which they have clothed them, that they\r\nare a nation of philosophers; and sometimes, by all the arts of\r\nquackish parade, by show, tumult, and bustle, sometimes by the alarms\r\nof plots and invasions, they attempt to drown the cries of indigence,\r\nand to divert the eyes of the observer from the ruin and wretchedness of\r\nthe state. A brave people will certainly prefer liberty accompanied with\r\na virtuous poverty to a depraved and wealthy servitude. But before the\r\nprice of comfort and opulence is paid, one ought to be pretty sure it is\r\nreal liberty which is purchased, and that she is to be purchased at no\r\nother price. I shall always, however, consider that liberty as very\r\nequivocal in her appearance, which has not wisdom and justice for her\r\ncompanions, and does not lead prosperity and plenty in her train.\r\n\r\nThe advocates for this Revolution, not satisfied with exaggerating the\r\nvices of their ancient government, strike at the fame of their country\r\nitself, by painting almost all that could have attracted the attention\r\nof strangers, I mean their nobility and their clergy, as objects of\r\nhorror. If this were only a libel, there had not been much in it. But it\r\nhas practical consequences. Had your nobility and gentry, who formed\r\nthe great body of your landed men and the whole of your military\r\nofficers, resembled those of Germany, at the period when the Hanse towns\r\nwere necessitated to confederate against the nobles in defence of their\r\nproperty,--had they been like the Orsini and Vitelli in Italy, who used\r\nto sally from their fortified dens to rob the trader and traveller,--had\r\nthey been such as the Mamelukes in Egypt, or the Nayres on the coast of\r\nMalabar,--I do admit that too critical an inquiry might not be advisable\r\ninto the means of freeing the world from such a nuisance. The statues of\r\nEquity and Mercy might be veiled for a moment. The tenderest minds,\r\nconfounded with the dreadful exigence in which morality submits to the\r\nsuspension of its own rules in favor of its own principles, might turn\r\naside whilst fraud and violence were accomplishing the destruction of a\r\npretended nobility, which disgraced, whilst it persecuted, human nature.\r\nThe persons most abhorrent from blood and treason and arbitrary\r\nconfiscation might remain silent spectators of this civil war between\r\nthe vices.\r\n\r\nBut did the privileged nobility who met under the king's precept at\r\nVersailles in 1789, or their constituents, deserve to be looked on as\r\nthe Nayres or Mamelukes of this age, or as the Orsini and Vitelli of\r\nancient times? If I had then asked the question, I should have passed\r\nfor a madman. What have they since done, that they were to be driven\r\ninto exile, that their persons should be hunted about, mangled, and\r\ntortured, their families dispersed, their houses laid in ashes, and that\r\ntheir order should be abolished, and the memory of it, if possible,\r\nextinguished, by ordaining them to change the very names by which they\r\nwere usually known? Read their instructions to their representatives.\r\nThey breathe the spirit of liberty as warmly, and they recommend\r\nreformation as strongly, as any other order. Their privileges relative\r\nto contribution were voluntarily surrendered; as the king, from the\r\nbeginning, surrendered all pretence to a right of taxation. Upon a free\r\nconstitution there was but one opinion in France. The absolute monarchy\r\nwas at an end. It breathed its last without a groan, without struggle,\r\nwithout convulsion. All the struggle, all the dissension, arose\r\nafterwards, upon the preference of a despotic democracy to a government\r\nof reciprocal control. The triumph of the victorious party was over the\r\nprinciples of a British Constitution.\r\n\r\nI have observed the affectation which for many years past has prevailed\r\nin Paris, even to a degree perfectly childish, of idolizing the memory\r\nof your Henry the Fourth. If anything could put any one out of humor\r\nwith that ornament to the kingly character, it would be this overdone\r\nstyle of insidious panegyric. The persons who have worked this engine\r\nthe most busily are those who have ended their panegyrics in dethroning\r\nhis successor and descendant: a man as good-natured, at the least, as\r\nHenry the Fourth; altogether as fond of his people; and who has done\r\ninfinitely more to correct the ancient vices of the state than that\r\ngreat monarch did, or we are sure he ever meant to do. Well it is for\r\nhis panegyrists that they have not him to deal with! For Henry of\r\nNavarre was a resolute, active, and politic prince. He possessed,\r\nindeed, great humanity and mildness, but an humanity and mildness that\r\nnever stood in the way of his interests. He never sought to be loved\r\nwithout putting himself first in a condition to be feared. He used soft\r\nlanguage with determined conduct. He asserted and maintained his\r\nauthority in the gross, and distributed his acts of concession only in\r\nthe detail. Ho spent the income of his prerogative nobly, but he took\r\ncare not to break in upon the capital,--never abandoning for a moment\r\nany of the claims which he made under the fundamental laws, nor sparing\r\nto shed the blood of those who opposed him, often in the field,\r\nsometimes upon the scaffold. Because he knew how to make his virtues\r\nrespected by the ungrateful, he has merited the praises of those whom,\r\nif they had lived in his time, he would have shut up in the Bastile, and\r\nbrought to punishment along with the regicides whom he hanged after he\r\nhad famished Paris into a surrender.\r\n\r\nIf these panegyrists are in earnest in their admiration of Henry the\r\nFourth, they must remember that they cannot think more highly of him\r\nthan he did of the noblesse of France,--whose virtue, honor, courage,\r\npatriotism, and loyalty were his constant theme.\r\n\r\nBut the nobility of France are degenerated since the days of Henry the\r\nFourth.--This is possible; but it is more than I can believe to be true\r\nin any great degree. I do not pretend to know France as correctly as\r\nsome others; but I have endeavored through my whole life to make myself\r\nacquainted with human nature,--otherwise I should be unfit to take even\r\nmy humble part in the service of mankind. In that study I could not pass\r\nby a vast portion of our nature as it appeared modified in a country but\r\ntwenty-four miles from the shore of this island. On my best observation,\r\ncompared with my best inquiries, I found your nobility for the greater\r\npart composed of men of a high spirit, and of a delicate sense of\r\nhonor, both with regard to themselves individually, and with regard to\r\ntheir whole corps, over whom they kept, beyond what is common in other\r\ncountries, a censorial eye. They were tolerably well bred; very\r\nofficious, humane, and hospitable; in their conversation frank and open;\r\nwith a good military tone; and reasonably tinctured with literature,\r\nparticularly of the authors in their own language. Many had pretensions\r\nfar above this description. I speak of those who were generally met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nAs to their behavior to the inferior classes, they appeared to me to\r\ncomport themselves towards them with good-nature, and with something\r\nmore nearly approaching to familiarity than is generally practised with\r\nus in the intercourse between the higher and lower ranks of life. To\r\nstrike any person, even in the most abject condition, was a thing in a\r\nmanner unknown, and would be highly disgraceful. Instances of other\r\nill-treatment of the humble part of the community were rare; and as to\r\nattacks made upon the property or the personal liberty of the commons, I\r\nnever heard of any whatsoever from _them_,--nor, whilst the laws were in\r\nvigor under the ancient government, would such tyranny in subjects have\r\nbeen permitted. As men of landed estates, I had no fault to find with\r\ntheir conduct, though much to reprehend, and much to wish changed, in\r\nmany of the old tenures. Where the letting of their land was by rent, I\r\ncould not discover that their agreements with their farmers were\r\noppressive; nor when they were in partnership with the farmer, as often\r\nwas the case, have I heard that they had taken the lion's share. The\r\nproportions seemed not inequitable. There might be exceptions; but\r\ncertainly they were exceptions only. I have no reason to believe that in\r\nthese respects the landed noblesse of France were worse than the landed\r\ngentry of this country,--certainly in no respect more vexatious than the\r\nlandholders, not noble, of their own nation. In cities the nobility had\r\nno manner of power; in the country very little. You know, Sir, that much\r\nof the civil government, and the police in the most essential parts, was\r\nnot in the hands of that nobility which presents itself first to our\r\nconsideration. The revenue, the system and collection of which were the\r\nmost grievous parts of the French government, was not administered by\r\nthe men of the sword; nor were they answerable for the vices of its\r\nprinciple, or the vexations, where any such existed, in its management.\r\n\r\nDenying, as I am well warranted to do, that the nobility had any\r\nconsiderable share in the oppression of the people, in cases in which\r\nreal oppression existed, I am ready to admit that they were not without\r\nconsiderable faults and errors. A foolish imitation of the worst part of\r\nthe manners of England, which impaired their natural character, without\r\nsubstituting in its place what perhaps they meant to copy, has certainly\r\nrendered them worse than formerly they were. Habitual dissoluteness of\r\nmanners, continued beyond the pardonable period of life, was more common\r\namongst them than it is with us; and it reigned with the less hope of\r\nremedy, though possibly with something of less mischief, by being\r\ncovered with more exterior decorum. They countenanced too much that\r\nlicentious philosophy which has helped to bring on their ruin. There was\r\nanother error amongst them more fatal. Those of the commons who\r\napproached to or exceeded many of the nobility in point of wealth were\r\nnot fully admitted to the rank and estimation which wealth, in reason\r\nand good policy, ought to bestow in every country,--though I think not\r\nequally with that of other nobility. The two kinds of aristocracy were\r\ntoo punctiliously kept asunder: less so, however, than in Germany and\r\nsome other nations.\r\n\r\nThis separation, as I have already taken the liberty of suggesting to\r\nyou, I conceive to be one principal cause of the destruction of the old\r\nnobility. The military, particularly, was too exclusively reserved for\r\nmen of family. But, after all, this was an error of opinion, which a\r\nconflicting opinion would have rectified. A permanent Assembly, in which\r\nthe commons had their share of power, would soon abolish whatever was\r\ntoo invidious and insulting in these distinctions; and even the faults\r\nin the morals of the nobility would have been probably corrected, by the\r\ngreater varieties of occupation and pursuit to which a constitution by\r\norders would have given rise.\r\n\r\nAll this violent cry against the nobility I take to be a mere work of\r\nart. To be honored and even privileged by the laws, opinions, and\r\ninveterate usages of our country, growing out of the prejudice of ages,\r\nhas nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man. Even to be too\r\ntenacious of those privileges is not absolutely a crime. The strong\r\nstruggle in every individual to preserve possession of what he has found\r\nto belong to him, and to distinguish him, is one of the securities\r\nagainst injustice and despotism implanted in our nature. It operates as\r\nan instinct to secure property, and to preserve communities in a settled\r\nstate. What is there to shock in this? Nobility is a graceful ornament\r\nto the civil order. It is the Corinthian capital of polished society.\r\n\"_Omnes boni nobilitati semper favemus_,\" was the saying of a wise and\r\ngood man. It is, indeed, one sign of a liberal and benevolent mind to\r\nincline to it with some sort of partial propensity. He feels no\r\nennobling principle in his own heart, who wishes to level all the\r\nartificial institutions which have been adopted for giving a body to\r\nopinion and permanence to fugitive esteem. It is a sour, malignant,\r\nenvious disposition, without taste for the reality, or for any image or\r\nrepresentation of virtue, that sees with joy the unmerited fall of what\r\nhad long nourished in splendor and in honor. I do not like to see\r\nanything destroyed, any void produced in society, any ruin on the face\r\nof the land. It was therefore with no disappointment or dissatisfaction\r\nthat my inquiries and observations did not present to me any\r\nincorrigible vices in the noblesse of France, or any abuse which could\r\nnot be removed by a reform very short of abolition. Your noblesse did\r\nnot deserve punishment; but to degrade is to punish.\r\n\r\nIt was with the same satisfaction I found that the result of my inquiry\r\nconcerning your clergy was not dissimilar. It is no soothing news to my\r\nears, that great bodies of men are incurably corrupt. It is not with\r\nmuch credulity I listen to any, when they speak evil of those whom they\r\nare going to plunder. I rather suspect that vices are feigned or\r\nexaggerated, when profit is looked for in their punishment. An enemy is\r\na bad witness; a robber is a worse. Vices and abuses there were\r\nundoubtedly in that order, and must be. It was an old establishment, and\r\nnot frequently revised. But I saw no crimes in the individuals that\r\nmerited confiscation of their substance, nor those cruel insults and\r\ndegradations, and that unnatural persecution, which have been\r\nsubstituted in the place of meliorating regulation.\r\n\r\nIf there had been any just cause for this new religions persecution, the\r\natheistic libellers, who act as trumpeters to animate the populace to\r\nplunder, do not love anybody so much as not to dwell with complacence on\r\nthe vices of the existing clergy. This they have not done. They find\r\nthemselves obliged to rake into the histories of former ages (which they\r\nhave ransacked with a malignant and profligate industry) for every\r\ninstance of oppression and persecution which has been made by that body\r\nor in its favor, in order to justify, upon very iniquitous because very\r\nillogical principles of retaliation, their own persecutions and their\r\nown cruelties. After destroying all other genealogies and family\r\ndistinctions, they invent a sort of pedigree of crimes. It is not very\r\njust to chastise men for the offences of their natural ancestors; but to\r\ntake the fiction of ancestry in a corporate succession, as a ground for\r\npunishing men who have no relation to guilty acts, except in names and\r\ngeneral descriptions, is a sort of refinement in injustice belonging to\r\nthe philosophy of this enlightened age. The Assembly punishes men, many,\r\nif not most, of whom abhor the violent conduct of ecclesiastics in\r\nformer times as much as their present persecutors can do, and who would\r\nbe as loud and as strong in the expression of that sense, if they were\r\nnot well aware of the purposes for which all this declamation is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nCorporate bodies are immortal for the good of the members, but not for\r\ntheir punishment. Nations themselves are such corporations. As well\r\nmight we in England think of waging inexpiable war upon all Frenchmen\r\nfor the evils which they have brought upon us in the several periods of\r\nour mutual hostilities. You might, on your part, think yourselves\r\njustified in falling upon all Englishmen on account of the unparalleled\r\ncalamities brought upon the people of France by the unjust invasions of\r\nour Henrys and our Edwards. Indeed, we should be mutually justified in\r\nthis exterminatory war upon each other, full as much as you are in the\r\nunprovoked persecution of your present countrymen, on account of the\r\nconduct of men of the same name in other times.\r\n\r\nWe do not draw the moral lessons we might from history. On the contrary,\r\nwithout care it may be used to vitiate our minds and to destroy our\r\nhappiness. In history a great volume is unrolled for our instruction,\r\ndrawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and\r\ninfirmities of mankind. It may, in the perversion, serve for a magazine,\r\nfurnishing offensive and defensive weapons for parties in Church and\r\nState, and supplying the means of keeping alive or reviving dissensions\r\nand animosities, and adding fuel to civil fury. History consists, for\r\nthe greater part, of the miseries brought upon the world by pride,\r\nambition, avarice, revenge, lust, sedition, hypocrisy, ungoverned zeal,\r\nand all the train of disorderly appetites, which shake the public with\r\nthe same\r\n\r\n            \"troublous storms that toss\r\n    The private state, and render life unsweet.\"\r\n\r\nThese vices are the _causes_ of those storms. Religion, morals, laws,\r\nprerogatives, privileges, liberties, rights of men, are the _pretexts_.\r\nThe pretexts are always found in some specious appearance of a real\r\ngood. You would not secure men from tyranny and sedition by rooting out\r\nof the mind the principles to which these fraudulent pretexts apply? If\r\nyou did, you would root out everything that is valuable in the human\r\nbreast. As these are the pretexts, so the ordinary actors and\r\ninstruments in great public evils are kings, priests, magistrates,\r\nsenates, parliaments, national assemblies, judges, and captains. You\r\nwould not cure the evil by resolving that there should be no more\r\nmonarchs, nor ministers of state, nor of the Gospel,--no interpreters of\r\nlaw, no general officers, no public councils. You might change the\r\nnames: the things in some shape must remain. A certain _quantum_ of\r\npower must always exist in the community, in some hands, and under some\r\nappellation. Wise men will apply their remedies to vices, not to\r\nnames,--to the causes of evil, which are permanent, not to the\r\noccasional organs by which they act, and the transitory modes in which\r\nthey appear. Otherwise you will be wise historically, a fool in\r\npractice. Seldom have two ages the same fashion in their pretexts, and\r\nthe same modes of mischief. Wickedness is a little more inventive.\r\nWhilst you are discussing fashion, the fashion is gone by. The very same\r\nvice assumes a new body. The spirit transmigrates; and, far from losing\r\nits principle of life by the change of its appearance, it is renovated\r\nin its new organs with the fresh vigor of a juvenile activity. It walks\r\nabroad, it continues its ravages, whilst you are gibbeting the carcass\r\nor demolishing the tomb. You are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and\r\napparitions, whilst your house is the haunt of robbers. It is thus with\r\nall those who, attending only to the shell and husk of history, think\r\nthey are waging war with intolerance, pride, and cruelty, whilst, under\r\ncolor of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties, they are\r\nauthorizing and feeding the same odious vices in different factions, and\r\nperhaps in worse.\r\n\r\nYour citizens of Paris formerly had lent themselves as the ready\r\ninstruments to slaughter the followers of Calvin, at the infamous\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew. What should we say to those who could think\r\nof retaliating on the Parisians of this day the abominations and horrors\r\nof that time? They are, indeed, brought to abhor _that_ massacre.\r\nFerocious as they are, it is not difficult to make them dislike it,\r\nbecause the politicians and fashionable teachers have no interest in\r\ngiving their passions exactly the same direction. Still, however, they\r\nfind it their interest to keep the same savage dispositions alive. It\r\nwas but the other day that they caused this very massacre to be acted on\r\nthe stage for the diversion of the descendants of those who committed\r\nit. In this tragic farce they produced the Cardinal of Lorraine in his\r\nrobes of function, ordering general slaughter. Was this spectacle\r\nintended to make the Parisians abhor persecution and loathe the effusion\r\nof blood? No: it was to teach them to persecute their own pastors; it\r\nwas to excite them, by raising a disgust and horror of their clergy, to\r\nan alacrity in hunting down to destruction an order which, if it ought\r\nto exist at all, ought to exist not only in safety, but in reverence. It\r\nwas to stimulate their cannibal appetites (which one would think had\r\nbeen gorged sufficiently) by variety and seasoning,--and to quicken them\r\nto an alertness in new murders and massacres, if it should suit the\r\npurpose of the Guises of the day. An Assembly in which sat a multitude\r\nof priests and prelates was obliged to suffer this indignity at its\r\ndoor. The author was not sent to the galleys, nor the players to the\r\nhouse of correction. Not long after this exhibition, those players came\r\nforward to the Assembly to claim the rites of that very religion which\r\nthey had dared to expose, and to show their prostituted faces in the\r\nsenate, whilst the Archbishop of Paris, whose function was known to his\r\npeople only by his prayers and benedictions, and his wealth only by\r\nalms, is forced to abandon his house, and to fly from his flock, (as\r\nfrom ravenous wolves,) because, truly, in the sixteenth century, the\r\nCardinal of Lorraine was a rebel and a murderer.[113]\r\n\r\nSuch is the effect of the perversion of history by those who, for the\r\nsame nefarious purposes, have perverted every other part of learning.\r\nBut those who will stand upon that elevation of reason which places\r\ncenturies under our eye and brings things to the true point of\r\ncomparison, which obscures little names and effaces the colors of little\r\nparties, and to which nothing can ascend but the spirit and moral\r\nquality of human actions, will say to the teachers of the Palais\r\nRoyal,--The Cardinal of Lorraine was the murderer of the sixteenth\r\ncentury; you have the glory of being the murderers in the eighteenth;\r\nand this is the only difference between you. But history in the\r\nnineteenth century, better understood and better employed, will, I\r\ntrust, teach a civilized posterity to abhor the misdeeds of both these\r\nbarbarous ages. It will teach future priests and magistrates not to\r\nretaliate upon the speculative and inactive atheists of future times\r\nthe enormities committed by the present practical zealots and furious\r\nfanatics of that wretched error, which, in its quiescent state, is more\r\nthan punished, whenever it is embraced. It will teach posterity not to\r\nmake war upon either religion or philosophy for the abuse which the\r\nhypocrites of both have made of the two most valuable blessings\r\nconferred upon us by the bounty of the universal Patron, who in all\r\nthings eminently favors and protects the race of man.\r\n\r\nIf your clergy, or any clergy, should show themselves vicious beyond the\r\nfair bounds allowed to human infirmity, and to those professional faults\r\nwhich can hardly be separated from professional virtues, though their\r\nvices never can countenance the exercise of oppression, I do admit that\r\nthey would naturally have the effect of abating very much of our\r\nindignation against the tyrants who exceed measure and justice in their\r\npunishment. I can allow in clergymen, through all their divisions, some\r\ntenaciousness of their own opinion, some overflowings of zeal for its\r\npropagation, some predilection to their own state and office, some\r\nattachment to the interest of their own corps, some preference to those\r\nwho Us ten with docility to their doctrines beyond those who scorn and\r\nderide them. I allow all this, because I am a man who have to deal with\r\nmen, and who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the\r\ngreatest of all intolerance. I must bear with infirmities, until they\r\nfester into crimes.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the natural progress of the passions, from frailty to vice,\r\nought to be prevented by a watchful eye and a firm hand. But is it true\r\nthat the body of your clergy had passed those limits of a just\r\nallowance? Prom the general style of your late publications of all\r\nsorts, one would be led to believe that your clergy in France were a\r\nsort of monsters: an horrible composition of superstition, ignorance,\r\nsloth, fraud, avarice, and tyranny. But is this true? Is it true that\r\nthe lapse of time, the cessation of conflicting interests, the woful\r\nexperience of the evils resulting from party rage, have had no sort of\r\ninfluence gradually to meliorate their minds? Is it true that they were\r\ndaily renewing invasions on the civil power, troubling the domestic\r\nquiet of their country, and rendering the operations of its government\r\nfeeble and precarious? Is it true that the clergy of our times have\r\npressed down the laity with an iron hand, and were in all places\r\nlighting up the fires of a savage persecution? Did they by every fraud\r\nendeavor to increase their estates? Did they use to exceed the due\r\ndemands on estates that were their own? Or, rigidly screwing up right\r\ninto wrong, did they convert a legal claim into a vexatious extortion?\r\nWhen not possessed of power, were they filled with the vices of those\r\nwho envy it? Were they inflamed with a violent, litigious spirit of\r\ncontroversy? Goaded on with the ambition of intellectual sovereignty,\r\nwere they ready to fly in the face of all magistracy, to fire churches,\r\nto massacre the priests of other descriptions, to pull down altars, and\r\nto make their way over the ruins of subverted governments to an empire\r\nof doctrine, sometimes flattering, sometimes forcing, the consciences of\r\nmen from the jurisdiction of public institutions into a submission to\r\ntheir personal authority, beginning with a claim of liberty and ending\r\nwith an abuse of power?\r\n\r\nThese, or some of these, were the vices objected, and not wholly\r\nwithout foundation, to several of the churchmen of former times, who\r\nbelonged to the two great parties which then divided and distracted\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIf there was in France, as in other countries there visibly is, a great\r\nabatement, rather than any increase of these vices, instead of loading\r\nthe present clergy with the crimes of other men and the odious character\r\nof other times, in common equity they ought to be praised, encouraged,\r\nand supported, in their departure from a spirit which disgraced their\r\npredecessors, and for having assumed a temper of mind and manners more\r\nsuitable to their sacred function.\r\n\r\nWhen my occasions took me into France, towards the close of the late\r\nreign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a considerable part of\r\nmy curiosity. So far from finding (except from one set of men, not then\r\nvery numerous, though very active) the complaints and discontents\r\nagainst that body which some publications had given me reason to expect,\r\nI perceived little or no public or private uneasiness on their account.\r\nOn further examination, I found the clergy, in general, persons of\r\nmoderate minds and decorous manners: I include the seculars, and the\r\nregulars of both sexes. I had not the good fortune to know a great many\r\nof the parochial clergy: but in general I received a perfectly good\r\naccount of their morals, and of their attention to their duties. With\r\nsome of the higher clergy I had a personal acquaintance, and of the rest\r\nin that class a very good means of information. They were almost all of\r\nthem persons of noble birth. They resembled others of their own rank;\r\nand where there was any difference, it was in their favor. They were\r\nmore fully educated than the military noblesse,--so as by no means to\r\ndisgrace their profession by ignorance, or by want of fitness for the\r\nexercise of their authority. They seemed to me, beyond the clerical\r\ncharacter, liberal and open, with the hearts of gentlemen and men of\r\nhonor, neither insolent nor servile in their manners and conduct. They\r\nseemed to me rather a superior class,--a set of men amongst whom you\r\nwould not be surprised to find a Fénelon. I saw among the clergy in\r\nParis (many of the description are not to be met with anywhere) men of\r\ngreat learning and candor; and I had reason to believe that this\r\ndescription was not confined to Paris. What I found in other places I\r\nknow was accidental, and therefore to be presumed a fair sample. I spent\r\na few days in a provincial town, where, in the absence of the bishop, I\r\npassed my evenings with three clergymen, his vicars-general, persons who\r\nwould have done honor to any church. They were all well-informed; two of\r\nthem of deep, general, and extensive erudition, ancient and modern,\r\nOriental and Western,--particularly in their own profession. They had a\r\nmore extensive knowledge of our English divines than I expected; and\r\nthey entered into the genius of those writers with a critical accuracy.\r\nOne of these gentlemen is since dead: the Abbé Morangis. I pay this\r\ntribute without reluctance to the memory of that noble, reverend,\r\nlearned, and excellent person; and I should do the same with equal\r\ncheerfulness to the merits of the others, who I believe are still\r\nliving, if I did not fear to hurt those whom I am unable to serve.\r\n\r\nSome of these ecclesiastics of rank are, by all titles, persons\r\ndeserving of general respect. They are deserving of gratitude from me,\r\nand from many English. If this letter should ever come into their hands,\r\nI hope they will believe there are those of our nation who feel for\r\ntheir unmerited fall, and for the cruel confiscation of their fortunes,\r\nwith no common sensibility. What I say of them is a testimony, as far as\r\none feeble voice can go, which I owe to truth. Whenever the question of\r\nthis unnatural persecution is concerned, I will pay it. No one shall\r\nprevent me from being just and grateful. The time is fitted for the\r\nduty; and it is particularly becoming to show our justice and gratitude,\r\nwhen those who have deserved well of us and of mankind are laboring\r\nunder popular obloquy and the persecutions of oppressive power.\r\n\r\nYou had before your Revolution about a hundred and twenty bishops. A few\r\nof them were men of eminent sanctity, and charity without limit. When we\r\ntalk of the heroic, of course we talk of rare virtue. I believe the\r\ninstances of eminent depravity may be as rare amongst them as those of\r\ntranscendent goodness. Examples of avarice and of licentiousness may be\r\npicked out, I do not question it, by those who delight in the\r\ninvestigation which leads to such discoveries. A man as old as I am will\r\nnot be astonished that several, in every description, do not lead that\r\nperfect life of self-denial, with regard to wealth or to pleasure, which\r\nis wished for by all, by some expected, but by none exacted with more\r\nrigor than by those who are the most attentive to their own interests or\r\nthe most indulgent to their own passions. When I was in France, I am\r\ncertain that the number of vicious prelates was not great. Certain\r\nindividuals among them, not distinguishable for the regularity of their\r\nlives, made some amends for their want of the severe virtues in their\r\npossession of the liberal, and wore endowed with qualities which made\r\nthem useful in the Church and State. I am told, that, with few\r\nexceptions, Louis the Sixteenth had been more attentive to character, in\r\nhis promotions to that rank, than his immediate predecessor; and I\r\nbelieve (as some spirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign)\r\nthat it may be true. But the present ruling power has shown a\r\ndisposition only to plunder the Church. It has punished _all_ prelates:\r\nwhich is to favor the vicious, at least in point of reputation. It has\r\nmade a degrading pensionary establishment, to which no man of liberal\r\nideas or liberal condition will destine his children. It must settle\r\ninto the lowest classes of the people. As with you the inferior clergy\r\nare not numerous enough for their duties, as these duties are beyond\r\nmeasure minute and toilsome, as you have left no middle classes of\r\nclergy at their ease, in future nothing of science or erudition can\r\nexist in the Gallican Church. To complete the project, without the least\r\nattention to the rights of patrons, the Assembly has provided in future\r\nan elective clergy: an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical\r\nprofession all men of sobriety, all who can pretend to independence in\r\ntheir function or their conduct,--and which will throw the whole\r\ndirection of the public mind into the hands of a set of licentious,\r\nbold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of such condition and such\r\nhabits of life as will make their contemptible pensions (in comparison\r\nof which the stipend of an exciseman is lucrative and honorable) an\r\nobject of low and illiberal intrigue. Those officers whom they still\r\ncall bishops are to be elected to a provision comparatively mean,\r\nthrough the same arts, (that is, electioneering arts,) by men of all\r\nreligious tenets that are known or can be invented. The new lawgivers\r\nhave not ascertained anything whatsoever concerning their\r\nqualifications, relative either to doctrine or to morals, no more than\r\nthey have done with regard to the subordinate clergy; nor does it appear\r\nbut that both the higher and the lower may, at their discretion,\r\npractise or preach any mode of religion or irreligion that they please.\r\nI do not yet see what the jurisdiction of bishops over their\r\nsubordinates is to be, or whether they are to have any jurisdiction at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn short, Sir, it seems to me that this new ecclesiastical establishment\r\nis intended only to be temporary, and preparatory to the utter\r\nabolition, under any of its forms, of the Christian religion, whenever\r\nthe minds of men are prepared for this last stroke against it by the\r\naccomplishment of the plan for bringing its ministers into universal\r\ncontempt. They who will not believe that the philosophical fanatics who\r\nguide in these matters have long entertained such a design are utterly\r\nignorant of their character and proceedings. These enthusiasts do not\r\nscruple to avow their opinion, that a state can subsist without any\r\nreligion better than with one, and that they are able to supply the\r\nplace of any good which may be in it by a project of their own,--namely,\r\nby a sort of education they have imagined, founded in a knowledge of the\r\nphysical wants of men, progressively carried to an enlightened\r\nself-interest, which, when well understood, they tell us, will identify\r\nwith an interest more enlarged and public. The scheme of this education\r\nhas been long known. Of late they distinguish it (as they have got an\r\nentirely new nomenclature of technical terms) by the name of a _Civic\r\nEducation_.\r\n\r\nI hope their partisans in England (to whom I rather attribute very\r\ninconsiderate conduct than the ultimate object in this detestable\r\ndesign) will succeed neither in the pillage of the ecclesiastics nor in\r\nthe introduction of a principle of popular election to our bishoprics\r\nand parochial cures. This, in the present condition of the world, would\r\nbe the last corruption of the Church, the utter ruin of the clerical\r\ncharacter, the most dangerous shock that the state ever received through\r\na misunderstood arrangement of religion. I know well enough that the\r\nbishoprics and cures, under kingly and seigniorial patronage, as now\r\nthey are in England, and as they have been lately in France, are\r\nsometimes acquired by unworthy methods; but the other mode of\r\necclesiastical canvass subjects them infinitely more surely and more\r\ngenerally to all the evil arts of low ambition, which, operating on and\r\nthrough greater numbers, will produce mischief in proportion.\r\n\r\nThose of you who have robbed the clergy think that they shall easily\r\nreconcile their conduct to all Protestant nations, because the clergy\r\nwhom they have thus plundered, degraded, and given over to mockery and\r\nscorn, are of the Roman Catholic, that is, of _their own_ pretended\r\npersuasion. I have no doubt that some miserable bigots will be found\r\nhere as well as elsewhere, who hate sects and parties different from\r\ntheir own more than they love the substance of religion, and who are\r\nmore angry with those who differ from them in their particular plans and\r\nsystems than displeased with those who attack the foundation of our\r\ncommon hope. These men will write and speak on the subject in the manner\r\nthat is to be expected from their temper and character. Burnet says,\r\nthat, when he was in France, in the year 1683, \"the method which carried\r\nover the men of the finest parts to Popery was this: they brought\r\nthemselves to doubt of the whole Christian religion: when that was once\r\ndone, it seemed a more indifferent thing of what side or form they\r\ncontinued outwardly.\" If this was then the ecclesiastic policy of\r\nFrance, it is what they have since but too much reason to repent of.\r\nThey preferred atheism to a form of religion not agreeable to their\r\nideas. They succeeded in destroying that form; and atheism has succeeded\r\nin destroying them. I can readily give credit to Burnet's story; because\r\nI have observed too much of a similar spirit (for a little of it is\r\n\"much too much\") amongst ourselves. The humor, however, is not general.\r\n\r\nThe teachers who reformed our religion in England bore no sort of\r\nresemblance to your present reforming doctors in Paris. Perhaps they\r\nwere (like those whom they opposed) rather more than could be wished\r\nunder the influence of a party spirit; but they were most sincere\r\nbelievers; men of the most fervent and exalted piety; ready to die (as\r\nsome of them did die) like true heroes in defence of their particular\r\nideas of Christianity,--as they would with equal fortitude, and more\r\ncheerfully, for that stock of general truth for the branches of which\r\nthey contended with their blood. These men would have disavowed with\r\nhorror those wretches who claimed a fellowship with them upon no other\r\ntitles than those of their having pillaged the persons with whom they\r\nmaintained controversies, and their having despised the common religion,\r\nfor the purity of which they exerted themselves with a zeal which\r\nunequivocally bespoke their highest reverence for the substance of that\r\nsystem which they wished to reform. Many of their descendants have\r\nretained the same zeal, but (as less engaged in conflict) with more\r\nmoderation. They do not forget that justice and mercy are substantial\r\nparts of religion. Impious men do not recommend themselves to their\r\ncommunion by iniquity and cruelty towards any description of their\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nWe hear these new teachers continually boasting of their spirit of\r\ntoleration. That those persons should tolerate all opinions, who think\r\nnone to be of estimation, is a matter of small merit. Equal neglect is\r\nnot impartial kindness. The species of benevolence which arises from\r\ncontempt is no true charity. There are in England abundance of men who\r\ntolerate in the true spirit of toleration. They think the dogmas of\r\nreligion, though in different degrees, are all of moment, and that\r\namongst them there is, as amongst all things of value, a just ground of\r\npreference. They favor, therefore, and they tolerate. They tolerate, not\r\nbecause they despise opinions, but because they respect justice. They\r\nwould reverently and affectionately protect all religions, because they\r\nlove and venerate the great principle upon which they all agree, and the\r\ngreat object to which they are all directed. They begin more and more\r\nplainly to discern that we have all a common cause, as against a common\r\nenemy. They will not be so misled by the spirit of faction as not to\r\ndistinguish what is done in favor of their subdivision from those acts\r\nof hostility which, through some particular description, are aimed at\r\nthe whole corps in which they themselves, under another denomination,\r\nare included. It is impossible for me to say what may be the character\r\nof every description of men amongst us. But I speak for the greater\r\npart; and for them, I must tell you, that sacrilege is no part of their\r\ndoctrine of good works; that, so far from calling you into their\r\nfellowship on such title, if your professors are admitted to their\r\ncommunion, they must carefully conceal their doctrine of the lawfulness\r\nof the proscription of innocent men, and that they must make restitution\r\nof all stolen goods whatsoever. Till then they are none of ours.\r\n\r\nYou may suppose that we do not approve your confiscation of the revenues\r\nof bishops, and deans, and chapters, and parochial clergy possessing\r\nindependent estates arising from land, because we have the same sort of\r\nestablishment in England. That objection, you will say, cannot hold as\r\nto the confiscation of the goods of monks and nuns, and the abolition of\r\ntheir order. It is true that this particular part of your general\r\nconfiscation does not affect England, as a precedent in point; but the\r\nreason applies, and it goes a great way. The Long Parliament confiscated\r\nthe lands of deans and chapters in England on the same ideas upon which\r\nyour Assembly set to sale the lands of the monastic orders. But it is in\r\nthe principle of injustice that the danger lies, and not in the\r\ndescription of persons on whom it is first exercised. I see, in a\r\ncountry very near us, a course of policy pursued, which sets justice,\r\nthe common concern of mankind, at defiance. With the National Assembly\r\nof France possession is nothing, law and usage are nothing. I see the\r\nNational Assembly openly reprobate the doctrine of prescription, which\r\none of the greatest of their own lawyers[114] tells us, with great\r\ntruth, is a part of the law of Nature. He tells us that the positive\r\nascertainment of its limits, and its security from invasion, were among\r\nthe causes for which civil society itself has been instituted. If\r\nprescription be once shaken, no species of property is secure, when it\r\nonce becomes an object large enough to tempt the cupidity of indigent\r\npower. I see a practice perfectly correspondent to their contempt of\r\nthis great fundamental part of natural law. I see the confiscators begin\r\nwith bishops, and chapters, and monasteries; but I do not see them end\r\nthere. I see the princes of the blood, who, by the oldest usages of that\r\nkingdom, held large landed estates, (hardly with the compliment of a\r\ndebate,) deprived of their possessions, and, in lieu of their stable,\r\nindependent property, reduced to the hope of some precarious charitable\r\npension at the pleasure of an Assembly, which of course will pay little\r\nregard to the rights of pensioners at pleasure, when it despises those\r\nof legal proprietors. Flushed with the insolence of their first\r\ninglorious victories, and pressed by the distresses caused by their lust\r\nof unhallowed lucre, disappointed, but not discouraged, they have at\r\nlength ventured completely to subvert all property of all descriptions\r\nthroughout the extent of a great kingdom. They have compelled all men,\r\nin all transactions of commerce, in the disposal of lands, in civil\r\ndealing, and through the whole communion of life, to accept, as perfect\r\npayment and good and lawful tender, the symbols of their speculations on\r\na projected sale of their plunder. What vestiges of liberty or property\r\nhave they left? The tenant-right of a cabbage-garden, a year's interest\r\nin a hovel, the good-will of an ale-house or a baker's shop, the very\r\nshadow of a constructive property, are more ceremoniously treated in our\r\nParliament than with you the oldest and most valuable landed\r\npossessions, in the hands of the most respectable personages, or than\r\nthe whole body of the moneyed and commercial interest of your country.\r\nWe entertain a high opinion of the legislative authority; but we have\r\nnever dreamt that Parliaments had any right whatever to violate\r\nproperty, to overrule prescription, or to force a currency of their own\r\nfiction in the place of that which is real, and recognized by the law of\r\nnations. But you, who began with refusing to submit to the most moderate\r\nrestraints, have ended by establishing an unheard-of despotism. I find\r\nthe ground upon which your confiscators go is this: that, indeed, their\r\nproceedings could not be supported in a court of justice, but that the\r\nrules of prescription cannot bind a legislative assembly.[115] So that\r\nthis legislative assembly of a free nation sits, not for the security,\r\nbut for the destruction of property,--and not of property only, but of\r\nevery rule and maxim which can give it stability, and of those\r\ninstruments which can alone give it circulation.\r\n\r\nWhen the Anabaptists of Munster, in the sixteenth century, had filled\r\nGermany with confusion, by their system of levelling, and their wild\r\nopinions concerning property, to what country in Europe did not the\r\nprogress of their fury furnish just cause of alarm? Of all things,\r\nwisdom is the most terrified with epidemical fanaticism, because of all\r\nenemies it is that against which she is the least able to furnish any\r\nkind of resource. We cannot be ignorant of the spirit of atheistical\r\nfanaticism, that is inspired by a multitude of writings dispersed with\r\nincredible assiduity and expense, and by sermons delivered in all the\r\nstreets and places of public resort in Paris. These writings and sermons\r\nhave filled the populace with a black and savage atrocity of mind, which\r\nsupersedes in them the common feelings of Nature, as well as all\r\nsentiments of morality and religion; insomuch that these wretches are\r\ninduced to bear with a sullen patience the intolerable distresses\r\nbrought upon them by the violent convulsions and permutations that have\r\nbeen made in property.[116] The spirit of proselytism attends this\r\nspirit of fanaticism. They have societies to cabal and correspond at\r\nhome and abroad for the propagation of their tenets. The republic of\r\nBerne, one of the happiest, the most prosperous, and the best-governed\r\ncountries upon earth, is one of the great objects at the destruction of\r\nwhich they aim. I am told they have in some measure succeeded in sowing\r\nthere the seeds of discontent. They are busy throughout Germany. Spain\r\nand Italy have not been untried. England is not left out of the\r\ncomprehensive scheme of their malignant charity: and in England we find\r\nthose who stretch out their arms to them, who recommend their example\r\nfrom more than one pulpit, and who choose, in more than one periodical\r\nmeeting, publicly to correspond with them, to applaud them, and to hold\r\nthem up as objects for imitation; who receive from them tokens of\r\nconfraternity, and standards consecrated amidst their rites and\r\nmysteries;[117] who suggest to them leagues of perpetual amity, at the\r\nvery time when the power to which our Constitution has exclusively\r\ndelegated the federative capacity of this kingdom may find it expedient\r\nto make war upon them.\r\n\r\nIt is not the confiscation of our Church property from this example in\r\nFrance that I dread, though I think this would be no trifling evil. The\r\ngreat source of my solicitude is, lest it should ever be considered in\r\nEngland as the policy of a state to seek a resource in confiscations of\r\nany kind, or that any one description of citizens should be brought to\r\nregard any of the others as their proper prey.[118] Nations are wading\r\ndeeper and deeper into an ocean of boundless debt. Public debts, which\r\nat first were a security to governments, by interesting many in the\r\npublic tranquillity, are likely in their excess to become the means of\r\ntheir subversion. If governments provide for these debts by heavy\r\nimpositions, they perish by becoming odious to the people. If they do\r\nnot provide for them, they will be undone by the efforts of the most\r\ndangerous of all parties: I mean an extensive, discontented moneyed\r\ninterest, injured and not destroyed. The men who compose this interest\r\nlook for their security, in the first instance, to the fidelity of\r\ngovernment; in the second, to its power. If they find the old\r\ngovernments effete, worn out, and with their springs relaxed, so as not\r\nto be of sufficient vigor for their purposes, they may seek new ones\r\nthat shall be possessed of more energy; and this energy will be\r\nderived, not from an acquisition of resources, but from a contempt of\r\njustice. Revolutions are favorable to confiscation; and it is impossible\r\nto know under what obnoxious names the next confiscations will be\r\nauthorized. I am sure that the principles predominant in France extend\r\nto very many persons, and descriptions of persons, in all countries, who\r\nthink their innoxious indolence their security. This kind of innocence\r\nin proprietors may be argued into inutility; and inutility into an\r\nunfitness for their estates. Many parts of Europe are in open disorder.\r\nIn many others there is a hollow murmuring under ground; a confused\r\nmovement is felt, that threatens a general earthquake in the political\r\nworld. Already confederacies and correspondences of the most\r\nextraordinary nature are forming in several countries.[119] In such a\r\nstate of things we ought to hold ourselves upon our guard. In all\r\nmutations (if mutations must be) the circumstance which will serve most\r\nto blunt the edge of their mischief, and to promote what good may be in\r\nthem, is, that they should find us with our minds tenacious of justice\r\nand tender of property.\r\n\r\nBut it will be argued, that this confiscation in France ought not to\r\nalarm other nations. They say it is not made from wanton rapacity; that\r\nit is a great measure of national policy, adopted to remove an\r\nextensive, inveterate, superstitious mischief.--It is with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that I am able to separate policy from justice. Justice is\r\nitself the great standing policy of civil society; and any eminent\r\ndeparture from it, under any circumstances, lies under the suspicion of\r\nbeing no policy at all.\r\n\r\nWhen men are encouraged to go into a certain mode of life by the\r\nexisting laws, and protected in that mode as in a lawful\r\noccupation,--when they have accommodated all their ideas and all their\r\nhabits to it,--when the law had long made their adherence to its rules a\r\nground of reputation, and their departure from them a ground of disgrace\r\nand even of penalty,--I am sure it is unjust in legislature, by an\r\narbitrary act, to offer a sudden violence to their minds and their\r\nfeelings, forcibly to degrade them from their state and condition, and\r\nto stigmatize with shame and infamy that character and those customs\r\nwhich before had been made the measure of their happiness and honor. If\r\nto this be added an expulsion from their habitations and a confiscation\r\nof all their goods, I am not sagacious enough to discover how this\r\ndespotic sport made of the feelings, consciences, prejudices, and\r\nproperties of men can be discriminated from the rankest tyranny.\r\n\r\nIf the injustice of the course pursued in France be clear, the policy of\r\nthe measure, that is, the public benefit to be expected from it, ought\r\nto be at least as evident, and at least as important. To a man who acts\r\nunder the influence of no passion, who has nothing in view in his\r\nprojects but the public good, a great difference will immediately strike\r\nhim, between what policy would dictate on the original introduction of\r\nsuch institutions, and on a question of their total abolition, where\r\nthey have cast their roots wide and deep, and where, by long habit,\r\nthings more valuable than themselves are so adapted to them, and in a\r\nmanner interwoven with them, that the one cannot be destroyed without\r\nnotably impairing the other. He might be embarrassed, if the case were\r\nreally such as sophisters represent it in their paltry style of\r\ndebating. But in this, as in most questions of state, there is a middle.\r\nThere is something else than the mere alternative of absolute\r\ndestruction or unreformed existence. _Spartam nactus es; hanc exorna_.\r\nThis is, in my opinion, a rule of profound sense, and ought never to\r\ndepart from the mind of an honest reformer. I cannot conceive how any\r\nman can have brought himself to that pitch of presumption, to consider\r\nhis country as nothing but _carte blanche_, upon which he may scribble\r\nwhatever he pleases. A man full of warm, speculative benevolence may\r\nwish his society otherwise constituted than he finds it; but a good\r\npatriot, and a true politician, always considers how he shall make the\r\nmost of the existing materials of his country. A disposition to\r\npreserve, and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my\r\nstandard of a statesman. Everything else is vulgar in the conception,\r\nperilous in the execution.\r\n\r\nThere are moments in the fortune of states, when particular men are\r\ncalled to make improvements by great mental exertion. In those moments,\r\neven when they seem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country,\r\nand to be invested with full authority, they have not always apt\r\ninstruments. A politician, to do great things, looks for a _power_, what\r\nour workmen call a _purchase_; and if he finds that power, in politics\r\nas in mechanics, he cannot be at a loss to apply it. In the monastic\r\ninstitutions, in my opinion, was found a great _power_ for the mechanism\r\nof politic benevolence. There were revenues with a public direction;\r\nthere were men wholly set apart and dedicated to public purposes,\r\nwithout any other than public ties and public principles,--men without\r\nthe possibility of converting the estate of the community into a private\r\nfortune,--men denied to self-interests, whose avarice is for some\r\ncommunity,--men to whom personal poverty is honor, and implicit\r\nobedience stands in the place of freedom. In vain shall a man look to\r\nthe possibility of making such things when he wants them. The winds blow\r\nas they list. These institutions are the products of enthusiasm; they\r\nare the instruments of wisdom. Wisdom cannot create materials; they are\r\nthe gifts of Nature or of chance; her pride is in the use. The perennial\r\nexistence of bodies corporate and their fortunes are things particularly\r\nsuited to a man who has long views,--who meditates designs that require\r\ntime in fashioning, and which propose duration when they are\r\naccomplished. He is not deserving to rank high, or even to be mentioned\r\nin the order of great statesmen, who, having obtained the command and\r\ndirection of such a power as existed in the wealth, the discipline, and\r\nthe habits of such corporations as those which you have rashly\r\ndestroyed, cannot find any way of converting it to the great and lasting\r\nbenefit of his country. On the view of this subject, a thousand uses\r\nsuggest themselves to a contriving mind. To destroy any power growing\r\nwild from the rank productive force of the human mind is almost\r\ntantamount, in the moral world, to the destruction of the apparently\r\nactive properties of bodies in the material. It would be like the\r\nattempt to destroy (if it were in our competence to destroy) the\r\nexpansive force of fixed air in nitre, or the power of steam, or of\r\nelectricity, or of magnetism. These energies always existed in Nature,\r\nand they were always discernible. They seemed, some of them\r\nunserviceable, some noxious, some no better than a sport to\r\nchildren,--until contemplative ability, combining with practic skill,\r\ntamed their wild nature, subdued them to use, and rendered them at once\r\nthe most powerful and the most tractable agents, in subservience to the\r\ngreat views and designs of men. Did fifty thousand persons, whose mental\r\nand whose bodily labor you might direct, and so many hundred thousand a\r\nyear of a revenue, which was neither lazy nor superstitious, appear too\r\nbig for your abilities to wield? Had you no way of using the men, but by\r\nconverting monks into pensioners? Had you no way of turning the revenue\r\nto account, but through the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale?\r\nIf you were thus destitute of mental funds, the proceeding is in its\r\nnatural course. Your politicians do not understand their trade; and\r\ntherefore they sell their tools.\r\n\r\nBut the institutions savor of superstition in their very principle; and\r\nthey nourish it by a permanent and standing influence.--This I do not\r\nmean to dispute; but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from\r\nsuperstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the\r\npublic advantage. You derive benefits from many dispositions and many\r\npassions of the human mind which are of as doubtful a color, in the\r\nmoral eye, as superstition itself. It was your business to correct and\r\nmitigate everything which was noxious in this passion, as in all the\r\npassions. But is superstition the greatest of all possible vices? In its\r\npossible excess I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a\r\nmoral subject, and of course admits of all degrees and all\r\nmodifications. Superstition is the religion of feeble minds; and they\r\nmust be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in some trifling or some\r\nenthusiastic shape or other, else you will deprive weak minds of a\r\nresource found necessary to the strongest. The body of all true religion\r\nconsists, to be sure, in obedience to the will of the Sovereign of the\r\nworld, in a confidence in His declarations, and in imitation of His\r\nperfections. The rest is our own. It may be prejudicial to the great\r\nend,--it may be auxiliary. Wise men, who, as such, are not _admirers_,\r\n(not admirers at least of the _munera terræ_,) are not violently\r\nattached to these things, nor do they violently hate them. Wisdom is not\r\nthe most severe corrector of folly. They are the rival follies which\r\nmutually wage so unrelenting a war, and which make so cruel a use of\r\ntheir advantages, as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar, on\r\nthe one side or the other, in their quarrels. Prudence would be neuter;\r\nbut if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy\r\nconcerning things in their nature not made to produce such heats, a\r\nprudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and excesses of\r\nenthusiasm he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think the\r\nsuperstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which\r\ndemolishes,--that which adorns a country, than that which deforms\r\nit,--that which endows, than that which plunders,--that which disposes\r\nto mistaken beneficence, than that which stimulates to real\r\ninjustice,--that which leads a man to refuse to himself lawful\r\npleasures, than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence\r\nof their self-denial. Such, I think, is very nearly the state of the\r\nquestion between the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the\r\nsuperstition of the pretended philosophers of the hour.\r\n\r\nFor the present I postpone all consideration of the supposed public\r\nprofit of the sale, which, however, I conceive to be perfectly delusive.\r\nI shall here only consider it as a transfer of property. On the policy\r\nof that transfer I shall trouble you with a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn every prosperous community something more is produced than goes to\r\nthe immediate support of the producer. This surplus forms the income of\r\nthe landed capitalist. It will be spent by a proprietor who does not\r\nlabor. But this idleness is itself the spring of labor, this repose the\r\nspur to industry. The only concern for the state is, that the capital\r\ntaken in rent from the land should be returned again to the industry\r\nfrom whence it came, and that its expenditure should be with the least\r\npossible detriment to the morals of those who expend it and to those of\r\nthe people to whom it is returned.\r\n\r\nIn all the views of receipt, expenditure, and personal employment, a\r\nsober legislator would carefully compare the possessor whom he was\r\nrecommended to expel with the stranger who was proposed to fill his\r\nplace. Before the inconveniences are incurred which _must_ attend all\r\nviolent revolutions in property through extensive confiscation, we ought\r\nto have some rational assurance that the purchasers of the confiscated\r\nproperty will be in a considerable degree more laborious, more virtuous,\r\nmore sober, less disposed to extort an unreasonable proportion of the\r\ngains of the laborer, or to consume on themselves a larger share than is\r\nfit for the measure of an individual,--or that they should be qualified\r\nto dispense the surplus in a more steady and equal mode, so as to\r\nanswer the purposes of a politic expenditure, than the old possessors,\r\ncall those possessors bishops, or canons, or commendatory abbots, or\r\nmonks, or what you please. The monks are lazy. Be it so. Suppose them no\r\notherwise employed than by singing in the choir. They are as usefully\r\nemployed as those who neither sing nor say,--as usefully even as those\r\nwho sing upon the stage. They are as usefully employed as if they worked\r\nfrom dawn to dark in the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly,\r\nunmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations to which\r\nby the social economy so many wretches are inevitably doomed. If it were\r\nnot generally pernicious to disturb the natural course of things, and to\r\nimpede in any degree the great wheel of circulation which is turned by\r\nthe strangely directed labor of these unhappy people, I should be\r\ninfinitely more inclined forcibly to rescue them from their miserable\r\nindustry than violently to disturb the tranquil repose of monastic\r\nquietude. Humanity, and perhaps policy, might better justify me in the\r\none than in the other. It is a subject on which I have often reflected,\r\nand never reflected without feeling from it. I am sure that no\r\nconsideration, except the necessity of submitting to the yoke of luxury\r\nand the despotism of fancy, who in their own imperious way will\r\ndistribute the surplus product of the soil, can justify the toleration\r\nof such trades and employments in a well-regulated state. But for this\r\npurpose of distribution, it seems to me that the idle expenses of monks\r\nare quite as well directed as the idle expenses of us lay loiterers.\r\n\r\nWhen the advantages of the possession and of the project are on a par,\r\nthere is no motive for a change. But in the present case, perhaps, they\r\nare not upon a par, and the difference is in favor of the possession. It\r\ndoes not appear to me that the expenses of those whom you are going to\r\nexpel do in fact take a course so directly and so generally leading to\r\nvitiate and degrade and render miserable those through whom they pass as\r\nthe expenses of those favorites whom you are intruding into their\r\nhouses. Why should the expenditure of a great landed property, which is\r\na dispersion of the surplus product of the soil, appear intolerable to\r\nyou or to me, when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast\r\nlibraries, which are the history of the force and weakness of the human\r\nmind,--through great collections of ancient records, medals, and coins,\r\nwhich attest and explain laws and customs,--through paintings and\r\nstatues, that, by imitating Nature, seem to extend the limits of\r\ncreation,--through grand monuments of the dead, which continue the\r\nregards and connections of life beyond the grave,--through collections\r\nof the specimens of Nature, which become a representative assembly of\r\nall the classes and families of the world, that by disposition\r\nfacilitate, and by exciting curiosity open, the avenues to science? If\r\nby great permanent establishments all these objects of expense are\r\nbetter secured from the inconstant sport of personal caprice and\r\npersonal extravagance, are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed\r\nin scattered individuals? Does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter,\r\nwho toil in order to partake the sweat of the peasant, flow as\r\npleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the\r\nmajestic edifices of religion as in the painted booths and sordid sties\r\nof vice and luxury? as honorably and as profitably in repairing those\r\nsacred works which grow hoary with innumerable years as on the momentary\r\nreceptacles of transient voluptuousness,--in opera-houses, and brothels,\r\nand gaming-houses, and club-houses, and obelisks in the Champ de Mars?\r\nIs the surplus product of the olive and the vine worse employed in the\r\nfrugal sustenance of persons whom the fictions of a pious imagination\r\nraise to dignity by construing in the service of God than in pampering\r\nthe innumerable multitude of those who are degraded by being made\r\nuseless domestics, subservient to the pride of man? Are the decorations\r\nof temples an expenditure less worthy a wise man than ribbons, and\r\nlaces, and national cockades, and petit maisons, and petit soupers, and\r\nall the innumerable fopperies and follies in which opulence sports away\r\nthe burden of its superfluity?\r\n\r\nWe tolerate even these,--not from love of them, but for fear of worse.\r\nWe tolerate them, because property and liberty, to a degree, require\r\nthat toleration. But why proscribe the other, and surely, in every point\r\nof view, the more laudable use of estates? Why, through the violation of\r\nall property, through an outrage upon every principle of liberty,\r\nforcibly carry them from the better to the worse?\r\n\r\nThis comparison between the new individuals and the old corps is made\r\nupon a supposition that no reform could be made in the latter. But, in a\r\nquestion of reformation, I always consider corporate bodies, whether\r\nsole or consisting of many, to be much more susceptible of a public\r\ndirection, by the power of the state, in the use of their property, and\r\nin the regulation of modes and habits of life in their members, than\r\nprivate citizens ever can be, or perhaps ought to be; and this seems to\r\nme a very material consideration for those who undertake anything which\r\nmerits the name of a politic enterprise.--So far as to the estates of\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons and\r\ncommendatory abbots, I cannot find out for what reason some landed\r\nestates may not be held otherwise than by inheritance. Can any\r\nphilosophic spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the\r\ncomparative evil of having a certain, and that, too, a large, portion of\r\nlanded property passing in succession through persons whose title to it\r\nis, always in theory and often in fact, an eminent degree of piety,\r\nmorals, and learning; a property which by its destination, in their\r\nturn, and on the score of merit, gives to the noblest families\r\nrenovation and support, to the lowest the means of dignity and\r\nelevation; a property, the tenure of which is the performance of some\r\nduty, (whatever value you may choose to set upon that duty,) and the\r\ncharacter of whose proprietors demands at least an exterior decorum and\r\ngravity of manners,--who are to exercise a generous, but temperate\r\nhospitality,--part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for\r\ncharity,--and who, even when they fail in their trust, when they slide\r\nfrom their character, and degenerate into a mere common secular nobleman\r\nor gentleman, are in no respect worse than those who may succeed them in\r\ntheir forfeited possessions? Is it better that estates should be held by\r\nthose who have no duty than by those who have one? by those whose\r\ncharacter and destination point to virtues than by those who have no\r\nrule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own\r\nwill and appetite? Nor are these estates held altogether in the\r\ncharacter or with the evils supposed inherent in mortmain. They pass\r\nfrom hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other. No\r\nexcess is good, and therefore too great a proportion of landed property\r\nmay be held officially for life; but it does not seem to me of material\r\ninjury to any common wealth that there should exist some estates that\r\nhave a chance of being acquired by other means than the previous\r\nacquisition of money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis letter is grown to a great length, though it is, indeed, short with\r\nregard to the infinite extent of the subject. Various avocations have\r\nfrom time to time called my mind from the subject. I was not sorry to\r\ngive myself leisure to observe whether in the proceedings of the\r\nNational Assembly I might not find reasons to change or to qualify some\r\nof my first sentiments. Everything has confirmed me more strongly in my\r\nfirst opinions. It was my original purpose to take a view of the\r\nprinciples of the National Assembly with regard to the great and\r\nfundamental establishments, and to compare the whole of what you have\r\nsubstituted in the place of what you have destroyed with the several\r\nmembers of our British Constitution. But this plan is of greater extent\r\nthan at first I computed, and I find that you have little desire to take\r\nthe advantage of any examples. At present I must content myself with\r\nsome remarks upon your establishments, reserving for another time what I\r\nproposed to say concerning the spirit of our British monarchy,\r\naristocracy, and democracy, as practically they exist.\r\n\r\nI have taken a view of what has been done by the governing power in\r\nFrance. I have certainly spoke of it with freedom. Those whose principle\r\nit is to despise the ancient, permanent sense of mankind, and to set up\r\na scheme of society on new principles, must naturally expect that such\r\nof us who think better of the judgment of the human race than, of theirs\r\nshould consider both them and their devices as men and schemes upon\r\ntheir trial. They must take it for granted that we attend much to their\r\nreason, but not at all to their authority. They have not one of the\r\ngreat influencing prejudices of mankind in their favor. They avow their\r\nhostility to opinion. Of course they must expect no support from that\r\ninfluence, which, with every other authority, they have deposed from the\r\nseat of its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI can never consider this Assembly as anything else than a voluntary\r\nassociation of men who have availed themselves of circumstances to seize\r\nupon the power of the state. They have not the sanction and authority of\r\nthe character under which they first met. They have assumed another of a\r\nvery different nature, and have completely altered and inverted all the\r\nrelations in which they originally stood. They do not hold the authority\r\nthey exercise under any constitutional law of the state. They have\r\ndeparted from the instructions of the people by whom they were sent;\r\nwhich instructions, as the Assembly did not act in virtue of any ancient\r\nusage or settled law, were the sole source of their authority. The most\r\nconsiderable of their acts have not been done by great majorities; and\r\nin this sort of near divisions, which carry only the constructive\r\nauthority of the whole, strangers will consider reasons as well as\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nIf they had set up this new, experimental government as a necessary\r\nsubstitute for an expelled tyranny, mankind would anticipate the time of\r\nprescription, which through long usage mellows into legality governments\r\nthat were violent in their commencement. All those who have affections\r\nwhich lead them to the conservation of civil order would recognize, even\r\nin its cradle, the child as legitimate, which has been produced from\r\nthose principles of cogent expediency to which all just governments owe\r\ntheir birth, and on which they justify their continuance. But they will\r\nbe late and reluctant in giving any sort of countenance to the\r\noperations of a power which has derived its birth from no law and no\r\nnecessity, but which, on the contrary, has had its origin in those vices\r\nand sinister practices by which the social union is often disturbed and\r\nsometimes destroyed. This Assembly has hardly a year's prescription. We\r\nhave their own word for it that they have made a revolution. To make a\r\nrevolution is a measure which, _primâ fronte_, requires an apology. To\r\nmake a revolution is to subvert the ancient state of our country; and no\r\ncommon reasons are called for to justify so violent a proceeding. The\r\nsense of mankind authorizes us to examine into the mode of acquiring new\r\npower, and to criticize on the use that is made of it, with less awe and\r\nreverence than that which is usually conceded to a settled and\r\nrecognized authority.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining and securing their power, the Assembly proceeds upon\r\nprinciples the most opposite from those which appear to direct them in\r\nthe use of it. An observation on this difference will let us into the\r\ntrue spirit of their conduct. Everything which they have done, or\r\ncontinue to do, in order to obtain and keep their power, is by the most\r\ncommon arts. They proceed exactly as their ancestors of ambition have\r\ndone before them. Trace them through all their artifices, frauds, and\r\nviolences, you can find nothing at all that is new. They follow\r\nprecedents and examples with the punctilious exactness of a pleader.\r\nThey never depart an iota from the authentic formulas of tyranny and\r\nusurpation. But in all the regulations relative to the public good the\r\nspirit has been the very reverse of this. There they commit the whole to\r\nthe mercy of untried speculations; they abandon the dearest interests of\r\nthe public to those loose theories to which none of them would choose to\r\ntrust the slightest of his private concerns. They make this difference,\r\nbecause in their desire of obtaining and securing power they are\r\nthoroughly in earnest; there they travel in the beaten road. The public\r\ninterests, because about them they have no real solicitude, they abandon\r\nwholly to chance: I say to chance, because their schemes have nothing in\r\nexperience to prove their tendency beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe must always see with a pity not unmixed with respect the errors of\r\nthose who are timid and doubtful of themselves with regard to points\r\nwherein the happiness of mankind is concerned. But in these gentlemen\r\nthere is nothing of the tender parental solicitude which fears to cut up\r\nthe infant for the sake of an experiment. In the vastness of their\r\npromises and the confidence of their predictions they far outdo all the\r\nboasting of empirics. The arrogance of their pretensions in a manner\r\nprovokes and challenges us to an inquiry into their foundation.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that there are men of considerable parts among the\r\npopular leaders in the National Assembly. Some of them display eloquence\r\nin their speeches and their writings. This cannot be without powerful\r\nand cultivated talents. But eloquence may exist without a proportionable\r\ndegree of wisdom. When I speak of ability, I am obliged to distinguish.\r\nWhat they have done towards the support of their system bespeaks no\r\nordinary men. In the system itself, taken as the scheme of a republic\r\nconstructed for procuring the prosperity and security of the citizen,\r\nand for promoting the strength and grandeur of the state, I confess\r\nmyself unable to find out anything which displays, in a single instance,\r\nthe work of a comprehensive and disposing mind, or even the provisions\r\nof a vulgar prudence. Their purpose everywhere seems to have been to\r\nevade and slip aside from _difficulty_. This it has been the glory of\r\nthe great masters in all the arts to confront, and to overcome,--and\r\nwhen they had overcome the first difficulty, to turn it into an\r\ninstrument for new conquests over new difficulties: thus to enable them\r\nto extend the empire of their science, and even to push forward, beyond\r\nthe reach of their original thoughts, the landmarks of the human\r\nunderstanding itself. Difficulty is a severe instructor, set over us by\r\nthe supreme ordinance of a parental Guardian and Legislator, who knows\r\nus better than we know ourselves, as He loves us better too. _Pater ipse\r\ncolendi haud facilem esse viam voluit_. He that wrestles with us\r\nstrengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our\r\nhelper. This amicable conflict with difficulty obliges us to an intimate\r\nacquaintance with our object, and compels us to consider it in all its\r\nrelations. It will not suffer us to be superficial. It is the want of\r\nnerves of understanding for such a task, it is the degenerate fondness\r\nfor tricking short-outs and little fallacious facilities, that has in so\r\nmany parts of the world created governments with arbitrary powers. They\r\nhave created the late arbitrary monarchy of France. They have created\r\nthe arbitrary republic of Paris. With them defects in wisdom are to be\r\nsupplied by the plenitude of force. They get nothing by it. Commencing\r\ntheir labors on a principle of sloth, they have the common fortune of\r\nslothful men. The difficulties, which they rather had eluded than\r\nescaped, meet them again in their course; they multiply and thicken on\r\nthem; they are involved, through a labyrinth of confused detail, in an\r\nindustry without limit and without direction; and in conclusion, the\r\nwhole of their work becomes feeble, vicious, and insecure.\r\n\r\nIt is this inability to wrestle with difficulty which has obliged the\r\narbitrary Assembly of France to commence their schemes of reform with\r\nabolition and total destruction.[120] But is it in destroying and\r\npulling down that skill is displayed? Your mob can do this as well at\r\nleast as your assemblies. The shallowest understanding, the rudest hand,\r\nis more than equal to that task. Rage and frenzy will pull down more in\r\nhalf an hour than prudence, deliberation, and foresight can build up in\r\na hundred years. The errors and defects of old establishments are\r\nvisible and palpable. It calls for little ability to point them out; and\r\nwhere absolute power is given, it requires but a word wholly to abolish\r\nthe vice and the establishment together. The same lazy, but restless\r\ndisposition, which loves sloth and hates quiet, directs these\r\npoliticians, when they come to work for supplying the place of what they\r\nhave destroyed. To make everything the reverse of what they have seen is\r\nquite as easy as to destroy. No difficulties occur in what has never\r\nbeen tried. Criticism is almost baffled in discovering the defects of\r\nwhat has not existed; and eager enthusiasm and cheating hope have all\r\nthe wide field of imagination, in which they may expatiate with little\r\nor no opposition.\r\n\r\nAt once to preserve and to reform is quite another thing. When the\r\nuseful parts of an old establishment are kept, and what is superadded is\r\nto be fitted to what is retained, a vigorous mind, steady, persevering\r\nattention, various powers of comparison and combination, and the\r\nresources of an understanding fruitful in expedients are to be\r\nexercised; they are to be exercised in a continued conflict with the\r\ncombined force of opposite vices, with the obstinacy that rejects all\r\nimprovement, and the levity that is fatigued and disgusted with\r\neverything of which it is in possession. But you may object,--\"A process\r\nof this kind is slow. It is not fit for an Assembly which glories in\r\nperforming in a few months the work of ages. Such a mode of reforming,\r\npossibly, might take up many years.\" Without question it might; and it\r\nought. It is one of the excellences of a method in which time is amongst\r\nthe assistants, that its operation is slow, and in some cases almost\r\nimperceptible. If circumspection and caution are a part of wisdom, when\r\nwe work only upon inanimate matter, surely they become a part of duty\r\ntoo, when the subject of our demolition and construction is not brick\r\nand timber, but sentient beings, by the sudden alteration of whose\r\nstate, condition, and habits, multitudes may be rendered miserable. But\r\nit seems as if it were the prevalent opinion in Paris, that an unfeeling\r\nheart and an undoubting confidence are the sole qualifications for a\r\nperfect legislator. Far different are my ideas of that high office. The\r\ntrue lawgiver ought to have a heart full of sensibility. He ought to\r\nlove and respect his kind, and to fear himself. It may be allowed to his\r\ntemperament to catch his ultimate object with an intuitive glance; but\r\nhis movements towards it ought to be deliberate. Political arrangement,\r\nas it is a work for social ends, is to be only wrought by social means.\r\nThere mind must conspire with mind. Time is required to produce that\r\nunion of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at. Our\r\npatience will achieve more than our force. If I might venture to appeal\r\nto what is so much out of fashion in Paris,--I mean to experience,--I\r\nshould tell you, that in my course I have known, and, according to my\r\nmeasure, have coöperated with great men; and I have never yet seen any\r\nplan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were\r\nmuch inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the\r\nbusiness. By a slow, but well-sustained progress, the effect of each\r\nstep is watched; the good or ill success of the first gives light to us\r\nin the second; and so, from light to light, we are conducted with safety\r\nthrough the whole series. We see that the parts of the system do not\r\nclash. The evils latent in the most promising contrivances are provided\r\nfor as they arise. One advantage is as little as possible sacrificed to\r\nanother. We compensate, we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to\r\nunite into a consistent whole the various anomalies and contending\r\nprinciples that are found in the minds and affairs of men. From hence\r\narises, not an excellence in simplicity, but one far superior, an\r\nexcellence in composition. Where the great interests of mankind are\r\nconcerned through a long succession of generations, that succession\r\nought to be admitted into some share in the councils which are so deeply\r\nto affect them. If justice requires this, the work itself requires the\r\naid of more minds than one age can furnish. It is from this view of\r\nthings that the best legislators have been often satisfied with the\r\nestablishment of some sure, solid, and ruling principle in\r\ngovernment,--a power like that which some of the philosophers have\r\ncalled a plastic Nature; and having fixed the principle, they have left\r\nit afterwards to its own operation.\r\n\r\nTo proceed in this manner, that is, to proceed with a presiding\r\nprinciple and a prolific energy, is with me the criterion of profound\r\nwisdom. What your politicians think the marks of a bold, hardy genius\r\nare only proofs of a deplorable want of ability. By their violent haste,\r\nand their defiance of the process of Nature, they are delivered over\r\nblindly to every projector and adventurer, to every alchemist and\r\nempiric. They despair of turning to account anything that is common.\r\nDiet is nothing in their system of remedy. The worst of it is, that this\r\ntheir despair of curing common distempers by regular methods arises not\r\nonly from defect of comprehension, but, I fear, from some malignity of\r\ndisposition. Your legislators seem to have taken their opinions of all\r\nprofessions, ranks, and offices from the declamations and buffooneries\r\nof satirists,--who would themselves be astonished, if they were held to\r\nthe letter of their own descriptions. By listening only to these, your\r\nleaders regard all things only on the side of their vices and faults,\r\nand view those vices and faults under every color of exaggeration. It is\r\nundoubtedly true, though it may seem paradoxical,--but, in general,\r\nthose who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are\r\nunqualified for the work of reformation; because their minds are not\r\nonly unfurnished with patterns of the fair and good, but by habit they\r\ncome to take no delight in the contemplation of those things. By hating\r\nvices too much, they come to love men too little. It is therefore not\r\nwonderful that they should be indisposed and unable to serve them. From\r\nhence arises the complexional disposition of some of your guides to pull\r\neverything in pieces. At this malicious game they display the whole of\r\ntheir _quadrimanous_ activity. As to the rest, the paradoxes of eloquent\r\nwriters, brought forth purely as a sport of fancy, to try their talents,\r\nto rouse attention, and excite surprise, are taken up by these\r\ngentlemen, not in the spirit of the original authors, as means of\r\ncultivating their taste and improving their style: these paradoxes\r\nbecome with them serious grounds of action, upon which they proceed in\r\nregulating the most important concerns of the state. Cicero ludicrously\r\ndescribes Cato as endeavoring to act in the commonwealth upon the school\r\nparadoxes which exercised the wits of the junior students in the Stoic\r\nphilosophy. If this was true of Cato, these gentlemen copy after him in\r\nthe manner of some persons who lived about his time,--_pede nudo\r\nCatonem_. Mr. Hume told me that he had from Rousseau himself the secret\r\nof his principles of composition. That acute, though eccentric observer,\r\nhad perceived, that, to strike and interest the public, the marvellous\r\nmust be produced; that the marvellous of the heathen mythology had long\r\nsince lost its effects; that giants, magicians, fairies, and heroes of\r\nromance, which succeeded, had exhausted the portion of credulity which\r\nbelonged to their age; that now nothing was left to a writer but that\r\nspecies of the marvellous, which might still be produced, and with as\r\ngreat an effect as ever, though in another way,--that is, the marvellous\r\nin life, in manners, in characters, and in extraordinary situations,\r\ngiving rise to new and unlooked-for strokes in politics and morals. I\r\nbelieve, that, were Rousseau alive, and in one of his lucid intervals,\r\nhe would be shocked at the practical frenzy of his scholars, who in\r\ntheir paradoxes are servile imitators, and even in their incredulity\r\ndiscover an implicit faith.\r\n\r\nMen who undertake considerable things, even in a regular way, ought to\r\ngive us ground to presume ability. But the physician of the state, who,\r\nnot satisfied with the cure of distempers, undertakes to regenerate\r\nconstitutions, ought to show uncommon powers. Some very unusual\r\nappearances of wisdom ought to display themselves on the face of the\r\ndesigns of those who appeal to no practice and who copy after no model.\r\nHas any such been manifested? I shall take a view (it shall for the\r\nsubject be a very short one) of what the Assembly has done, with regard,\r\nfirst, to the constitution of the legislature; in the next place, to\r\nthat of the executive power; then to that of the judicature; afterwards\r\nto the model of the army; and conclude with the system of finance: to\r\nsee whether we can discover in any part of their schemes the portentous\r\nability which may justify these bold undertakers in the superiority\r\nwhich they assume over mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is in the model of the sovereign and presiding part of this new\r\nrepublic that we should expect their grand display. Here they were to\r\nprove their title to their proud demands. For the plan itself at large,\r\nand for the reasons on which it is grounded, I refer to the journals of\r\nthe Assembly of the 29th of September, 1789, and to the subsequent\r\nproceedings which have made any alterations in the plan. So far as in a\r\nmatter somewhat confused I can see light, the system remains\r\nsubstantially as it has been originally framed. My few remarks will be\r\nsuch as regard its spirit, its tendency, and its fitness for framing a\r\npopular commonwealth, which they profess theirs to be, suited to the\r\nends for which any commonwealth, and particularly such a commonwealth,\r\nis made. At the same time I mean to consider its consistency with itself\r\nand its own principles.\r\n\r\nOld establishments are tried by their effects. If the people are happy,\r\nunited, wealthy, and powerful, we presume the rest. We conclude that to\r\nbe good from whence good is derived. In old establishments various\r\ncorrectives have been found for their aberrations from theory. Indeed,\r\nthey are the results of various necessities and expediences. They are\r\nnot often constructed after any theory: theories are rather drawn from\r\nthem. In them we often see the end best obtained, where the means seem\r\nnot perfectly reconcilable to what we may fancy was the original scheme.\r\nThe means taught by experience may be better suited to political ends\r\nthan those contrived in the original project. They again react upon the\r\nprimitive constitution, and sometimes improve the design itself, from\r\nwhich they seem to have departed. I think all this might be curiously\r\nexemplified in the British Constitution. At worst, the errors and\r\ndeviations of every kind in reckoning are found and computed, and the\r\nship proceeds in her course. This is the case of old establishments; but\r\nin a new and merely theoretic system, it is expected that every\r\ncontrivance shall appear, on the face of it, to answer its ends,\r\nespecially where the projectors are no way embarrassed with an endeavor\r\nto accommodate the new building to an old one, either in the walls or on\r\nthe foundations.\r\n\r\nThe French builders, clearing away as mere rubbish whatever they found,\r\nand, like their ornamental gardeners, forming everything into an exact\r\nlevel, propose to rest the whole local and general legislature on three\r\nbases of three different kinds,--one geometrical, one arithmetical, and\r\nthe third financial; the first of which they call _the basis of\r\nterritory_; the second, _the basis of population_; and the third, _the\r\nbasis of contribution_. For the accomplishment of the first of these\r\npurposes, they divide the area of their country into eighty-three\r\npieces, regularly square, of eighteen leagues by eighteen. These large\r\ndivisions are called _Departments_. These they portion, proceeding by\r\nsquare measurement, into seventeen hundred and twenty districts, called\r\n_Communes_. These again they subdivide, still proceeding by square\r\nmeasurement, into smaller districts, called _Cantons_, making in all\r\n6,400.\r\n\r\nAt first view this geometrical basis of theirs presents not much to\r\nadmire or to blame. It calls for no great legislative talents. Nothing\r\nmore than an accurate land-surveyor, with his chain, sight, and\r\ntheodolite, is requisite for such a plan as this. In the old divisions\r\nof the country, various accidents at times, and the ebb and flow of\r\nvarious properties and jurisdictions, settled their bounds. These bounds\r\nwere not made upon any fixed system, undoubtedly. They were subject to\r\nsome inconveniences; but they were inconveniences for which use had\r\nfound remedies, and habit had supplied accommodation and patience. In\r\nthis new pavement of square within square, and this organization and\r\nsemi-organization, made on the system of Empedocles and Buffon, and not\r\nupon any politic principle, it is impossible that innumerable local\r\ninconveniences, to which men are not habituated, must not arise. But\r\nthese I pass over, because it requires an accurate knowledge of the\r\ncountry, which I do not possess, to specify them.\r\n\r\nWhen these state surveyors came to take a view of their work of\r\nmeasurement, they soon found that in politics the most fallacious of all\r\nthings was geometrical demonstration. They had then recourse to another\r\nbasis (or rather buttress) to support the building, which tottered on\r\nthat false foundation. It was evident that the goodness of the soil, the\r\nnumber of the people, their wealth, and the largeness of their\r\ncontribution, made such infinite variations between square and square\r\nas to render mensuration a ridiculous standard of power in the\r\ncommonwealth, and equality in geometry the most unequal of all measures\r\nin the distribution of men. However, they could not give it up,--but,\r\ndividing their political and civil representation into three parts, they\r\nallotted one of those parts to the square measurement, without a single\r\nfact or calculation to ascertain whether this territorial proportion of\r\nrepresentation was fairly assigned, and ought upon any principle really\r\nto be a third. Having, however, given to geometry this portion, (of a\r\nthird for her dower,) out of compliment, I suppose, to that sublime\r\nscience, they left the other two to be scuffled for between the other\r\nparts, population and contribution.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to provide for population, they were not able to proceed\r\nquite so smoothly as they had done in the field of their geometry. Here\r\ntheir arithmetic came to bear upon their juridical metaphysics. Had they\r\nstuck to their metaphysic principles, the arithmetical process would be\r\nsimple indeed. Men, with them, are strictly equal, and are entitled to\r\nequal rights in their own government. Each head, on this system, would\r\nhave its vote, and every man would vote directly for the person who was\r\nto represent him in the legislature. \"But soft,--by regular degrees, not\r\nyet.\" This metaphysic principle, to which law, custom, usage, policy,\r\nreason, were to yield, is to yield itself to their pleasure. There must\r\nbe many degrees, and some stages, before the representative can come in\r\ncontact with his constituent. Indeed, as we shall soon see, these two\r\npersons are to have no sort of communion with each other. First, the\r\nvoters in the _Canton_, who compose what they call _primary\r\nassemblies_, are to have a _qualification_. What! a qualification on the\r\nindefeasible rights of men? Yes; but it shall be a very small\r\nqualification. Our injustice shall be very little oppressive: only the\r\nlocal valuation of three days' labor paid to the public. Why, this is\r\nnot much, I readily admit, for anything but the utter subversion of your\r\nequalizing principle. As a qualification it might as well be let alone;\r\nfor it answers no one purpose for which qualifications are established;\r\nand, on your ideas, it excludes from a vote the man of all others whose\r\nnatural equality stands the most in need of protection and defence: I\r\nmean the man who has nothing else but his natural equality to guard him.\r\nYou order him to buy the right which you before told him Nature had\r\ngiven to him gratuitously at his birth, and of which no authority on\r\nearth could lawfully deprive him. With regard to the person who cannot\r\ncome up to your market, a tyrannous aristocracy, as against him, is\r\nestablished at the very outset, by you who pretend to be its sworn foe.\r\n\r\nThe gradation proceeds. These primary assemblies of the _Canton_ elect\r\ndeputies to the _Commune_,--one for every two hundred qualified\r\ninhabitants. Here is the first medium put between the primary elector\r\nand the representative legislator; and here a new turnpike is fixed for\r\ntaxing the rights of men with a second qualification: for none can be\r\nelected into the _Commune_ who does not pay the amount of ten days'\r\nlabor. Nor have we yet done. There is still to be another\r\ngradation.[121] These _Communes_, chosen by the _Canton_, choose to the\r\n_Department_; and the deputies of the _Department_ choose their deputies\r\nto the _National Assembly_. Here is a third barrier of a senseless\r\nqualification. Every deputy to the National Assembly must pay, in direct\r\ncontribution, to the value of a _mark of silver_. Of all these\r\nqualifying barriers we must think alike: that they are impotent to\r\nsecure independence, strong only to destroy the rights of men.\r\n\r\nIn all this process, which in its fundamental elements affects to\r\nconsider only _population_, upon a principle of natural right, there is\r\na manifest attention to _property_,--which, however just and reasonable\r\non other schemes, is on theirs perfectly unsupportable.\r\n\r\nWhen they come to their third basis, that of _Contribution_, we find\r\nthat they have more completely lost sight of the rights of men. This\r\nlast basis rests _entirely_ on property. A principle totally different\r\nfrom the equality of men, and utterly irreconcilable to it, is thereby\r\nadmitted: but no sooner is this principle admitted than (as usual) it is\r\nsubverted; and it is not subverted (as we shall presently see) to\r\napproximate the inequality of riches to the level of Nature. The\r\nadditional share in the third portion of representation (a portion\r\nreserved exclusively for the higher contribution) is made to regard the\r\n_district_ only, and not the individuals in it who pay. It is easy to\r\nperceive, by the course of their reasonings, how much they were\r\nembarrassed by their contradictory ideas of the rights of men and the\r\nprivileges of riches. The Committee of Constitution do as good as admit\r\nthat they are wholly irreconcilable. \"The relation with regard to the\r\ncontributions is without doubt _null_, (say they,) when the question is\r\non the balance of the political rights as between individual and\r\nindividual; without which _personal equality would be destroyed_, and\r\n_an aristocracy of the rich_ would be established. But this\r\ninconvenience entirely disappears, when the proportional relation of the\r\ncontribution is only considered in the _great masses_, and is solely\r\nbetween province and province; it serves in that case only to form a\r\njust reciprocal proportion between the cities, without affecting the\r\npersonal rights of the citizens.\"\r\n\r\nHere the principle of _contribution_, as taken between man and man, is\r\nreprobated as _null_, and destructive to equality,--and as pernicious,\r\ntoo, because it leads to the establishment of an _aristocracy of the\r\nrich_. However, it must not be abandoned. And the way of getting rid of\r\nthe difficulty is to establish the inequality as between department and\r\ndepartment, leaving all the individuals in each department upon an exact\r\npar. Observe, that this parity between individuals had been before\r\ndestroyed, when the qualifications within the departments were settled;\r\nnor does it seem a matter of great importance whether the equality of\r\nmen be injured by masses or individually. An individual is not of the\r\nsame importance in a mass represented by a few as in a mass represented\r\nby many. It would be too much to tell a man jealous of his equality,\r\nthat the elector has the same franchise who votes for three members as\r\nhe who votes for ten.\r\n\r\nNow take it in the other point of view, and let us suppose their\r\nprinciple of representation according to contribution, that is according\r\nto riches, to be well imagined, and to be a necessary basis for their\r\nrepublic. In this their third basis they assume that riches ought to be\r\nrespected, and that justice and policy require that they should entitle\r\nmen, in some mode or other, to a larger share in the administration of\r\npublic affairs; it is now to be seen how the Assembly provides for the\r\npreëminence, or even for the security of the rich, by conferring, in\r\nvirtue of their opulence, that larger measure of power to their district\r\nwhich is denied to them personally. I readily admit (indeed, I should\r\nlay it down as a fundamental principle) that in a republican government,\r\nwhich has a democratic basis, the rich do require an additional security\r\nabove what is necessary to them in monarchies. They are subject to envy,\r\nand through envy to oppression. On the present scheme it is impossible\r\nto divine what advantage they derive from the aristocratic preference\r\nupon which the unequal representation of the masses is founded. The rich\r\ncannot feel it, either as a support to dignity or as security to\r\nfortune: for the aristocratic mass is generated from purely democratic\r\nprinciples; and the prevalence given to it in the general representation\r\nhas no sort of reference to or connection with the persons upon account\r\nof whose property this superiority of the mass is established. If the\r\ncontrivers of this scheme meant any sort of favor to the rich, in\r\nconsequence of their contribution, they ought to have conferred the\r\nprivilege either on the individual rich, or on some class formed of rich\r\npersons (as historians represent Servius Tullius to have done in the\r\nearly constitution of Rome); because the contest between the rich and\r\nthe poor is not a struggle between corporation and corporation, but a\r\ncontest between men and men,--a competition, not between districts, but\r\nbetween descriptions. It would answer its purpose better, if the scheme\r\nwere inverted: that the votes of the masses were rendered equal, and\r\nthat the votes within each mass were proportioned to property.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose one man in a district (it is an easy supposition) to\r\ncontribute as much as a hundred of his neighbors. Against these he has\r\nbut one vote. If there were but one representative for the mass, his\r\npoor neighbors would outvote him by an hundred to one for that single\r\nrepresentative. Bad enough! But amends are to be made him. How? The\r\ndistrict, in virtue of his wealth, is to choose, say ten members instead\r\nof one: that is to say, by paying a very large contribution he has the\r\nhappiness of being outvoted, an hundred to one, by the poor, for ten\r\nrepresentatives, instead of being outvoted exactly in the same\r\nproportion for a single member. In truth, instead of benefiting by this\r\nsuperior quantity of representation, the rich man is subjected to an\r\nadditional hardship. The increase of representation within his province\r\nsets up nine persons more, and as many more than nine as there may be\r\ndemocratic candidates, to cabal and intrigue and to flatter the people\r\nat his expense and to his oppression. An interest is by this means held\r\nout to multitudes of the inferior sort, in obtaining a salary of\r\neighteen livres a day, (to them a vast object,) besides the pleasure of\r\na residence in Paris, and their share in the government of the kingdom.\r\nThe more the objects of ambition are multiplied and become democratic,\r\njust in that proportion the rich are endangered.\r\n\r\nThus it must fare between the poor and the rich in the province deemed\r\naristocratic, which in its internal relation is the very reverse of that\r\ncharacter. In its external relation, that is, in its relation to the\r\nother provinces, I cannot see how the unequal representation which is\r\ngiven to masses on account of wealth becomes the means of preserving the\r\nequipoise and the tranquillity of the commonwealth. For, if it be one of\r\nthe objects to secure the weak from being crushed by the strong, (as in\r\nall society undoubtedly it is,) how are the smaller and poorer of these\r\nmasses to be saved from the tyranny of the more wealthy? Is it by adding\r\nto the wealthy further and more systematical means of oppressing them?\r\nWhen we come to a balance of representation between corporate bodies,\r\nprovincial interests, emulations, and jealousies are full as likely to\r\narise among them as among individuals; and their divisions are likely to\r\nproduce a much hotter spirit of dissension, and something leading much\r\nmore nearly to a war.\r\n\r\nI see that these aristocratic masses are made upon what is called the\r\nprinciple of direct contribution. Nothing can be a more unequal standard\r\nthan this. The indirect contribution, that which arises from duties on\r\nconsumption, is in truth a better standard, and follows and discovers\r\nwealth more naturally than this of direct contribution. It is difficult,\r\nindeed, to fix a standard of local preference on account of the one, or\r\nof the other, or of both, because some provinces may pay the more of\r\neither or of both on account of causes not intrinsic, but originating\r\nfrom those very districts over whom they have obtained a preference in\r\nconsequence of their ostensible contribution. If the masses were\r\nindependent, sovereign bodies, who were to provide for a federative\r\ntreasury by distinct contingents, and that the revenue had not (as it\r\nhas) many impositions running through the whole, which affect men\r\nindividually, and not corporately, and which, by their nature, confound\r\nall territorial limits, something might be said for the basis of\r\ncontribution as founded on masses. But, of all things, this\r\nrepresentation, to be measured by contribution, is the most difficult to\r\nsettle upon principles of equity in a country which considers its\r\ndistricts as members of a whole. For a great city, such as Bordeaux or\r\nParis, appears to pay a vast body of duties, almost out of all\r\nassignable proportion to other places, and its mass is considered\r\naccordingly. But are these cities the true contributors in that\r\nproportion? No. The consumers of the commodities imported into Bordeaux,\r\nwho are scattered through all France, pay the import duties of Bordeaux.\r\nThe produce of the vintage in Guienne and Languedoc give to that city\r\nthe means of its contribution growing out of an export commerce. The\r\nlandholders who spend their estates in Paris, and are thereby the\r\ncreators of that city, contribute for Paris from the provinces out of\r\nwhich their revenues arise. Very nearly the same arguments will apply to\r\nthe representative share given on account of _direct_ contribution:\r\nbecause the direct contribution must be assessed on wealth, real or\r\npresumed; and that local wealth will itself arise from causes not local,\r\nand which therefore in equity ought not to produce a local preference.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable, that, in this fundamental regulation which\r\nsettles the representation of the mass upon the direct contribution,\r\nthey have not yet settled how that direct contribution shall be laid,\r\nand how apportioned. Perhaps there is some latent policy towards the\r\ncontinuance of the present Assembly in this strange procedure. However,\r\nuntil they do this, they can have no certain constitution. It must\r\ndepend at last upon the system of taxation, and must vary with every\r\nvariation in that system. As they have contrived matters, their taxation\r\ndoes not so much depend on their constitution as their constitution on\r\ntheir taxation. This must introduce great confusion among the masses; as\r\nthe variable qualification for votes within the district must, if ever\r\nreal contested elections take place, cause infinite internal\r\ncontroversies.\r\n\r\nTo compare together the three bases, not on their political reason, but\r\non the ideas on which the Assembly works, and to try its consistency\r\nwith itself, we cannot avoid observing that the principle which the\r\ncommittee call the basis of _population_ does not begin to operate from\r\nthe same point with the two other principles, called the bases of\r\n_territory_ and of _contribution_, which are both of an aristocratic\r\nnature. The consequence is, that, where all three begin to operate\r\ntogether, there is the most absurd inequality produced by the operation\r\nof the former on the two latter principles. Every canton contains four\r\nsquare leagues, and is estimated to contain, on the average, 4,000\r\ninhabitants, or 680 voters in the _primary assemblies_, which vary in\r\nnumbers with the population of the canton, and send _one deputy_ to the\r\n_commune_ for every 200 voters. _Nine cantons_ make a _commune_.\r\n\r\nNow let us take _a canton_ containing _a seaport town of trade_, or _a\r\ngreat manufacturing town_. Let us suppose the population of this canton\r\nto be 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters, forming _three primary\r\nassemblies_, and sending _ten deputies_ to the _commune_.\r\n\r\nOppose to this _one_ canton _two_ others of the remaining eight in the\r\nsame commune. These we may suppose to have their fair population, of\r\n4,000 inhabitants, and 680 voters each, or 8,000 inhabitants and 1,360\r\nvoters, both together. These will form only _two primary assemblies_,\r\nand send only _six_ deputies to the _commune_.\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly of the _commune_ comes to vote on the _basis of\r\nterritory_, which principle is first admitted to operate in that\r\nassembly, the _single canton_, which has _half_ the territory of the\r\n_other two_, will have _ten_ voices to _six_ in the election of _three\r\ndeputies_ to the assembly of the department, chosen on the express\r\nground of a representation of territory. This inequality, striking as it\r\nis, will be yet highly aggravated, if we suppose, as we fairly may, the\r\n_several_ other cantons of the _commune_ to fall proportionally short of\r\nthe average population, as much as the _principal canton_ exceeds it.\r\n\r\nNow as to _the basis of contribution_, which also is a principle\r\nadmitted first to operate in the assembly of the _commune_. Let us again\r\ntake _one_ canton, such as is stated above. If the whole of the direct\r\ncontributions paid by a great trading or manufacturing town be divided\r\nequally among the inhabitants, each individual will be found to pay much\r\nmore than an individual living in the country according to the same\r\naverage. The whole paid by the inhabitants of the former will be more\r\nthan the whole paid by the inhabitants of the latter,--we may fairly\r\nassume one third more. Then the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of\r\nthe canton, will pay as much as 19,050 inhabitants, or 3,289 voters of\r\nthe _other cantons_, which are nearly the estimated proportion of\r\ninhabitants and voters of _five_ other cantons. Now the 2,193 voters\r\nwill, as I before said, send only _ten_ deputies to the assembly; the\r\n3,289 voters will send _sixteen_. Thus, for an _equal_ share in the\r\ncontribution of the whole _commune_, there will be a difference of\r\n_sixteen_ voices to _ten_ in voting for deputies to be chosen on the\r\nprinciple of representing the general contribution of the whole\r\n_commune_.\r\n\r\nBy the same mode of computation, we shall find 15,875 inhabitants, or\r\n2,741 voters of the _other_ cantons, who pay _one sixth_ LESS to the\r\ncontribution of the whole _commune_, will have _three_ voices MORE than\r\nthe 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of the _one_ canton.\r\n\r\nSuch is the fantastical and unjust inequality between mass and mass, in\r\nthis curious repartition of the rights of representation arising out of\r\n_territory_ and _contribution_. The qualifications which these confer\r\nare in truth negative qualifications, that give a right in an inverse\r\nproportion to the possession of them.\r\n\r\nIn this whole contrivance of the three bases, consider it in any light\r\nyou please, I do not see a variety of objects reconciled in one\r\nconsistent whole, but several contradictory principles reluctantly and\r\nirreconcilably brought and held together by your philosophers, like wild\r\nbeasts shut up in a cage, to claw and bite each other to their mutual\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have gone too far into their way of considering the\r\nformation of a Constitution. They have much, but bad,\r\nmetaphysics,--much, but bad, geometry,--much, but false, proportionate\r\narithmetic; but if it were all as exact as metaphysics, geometry, and\r\narithmetic ought to be, and if their schemes were perfectly consistent\r\nin all their parts, it would make only a more fair and sightly vision.\r\nIt is remarkable, that, in a great arrangement of mankind, not one\r\nreference whatsoever is to be found to anything moral or anything\r\npolitic,--nothing that relates to the concerns, the actions, the\r\npassions, the interests of men. _Hominem non sapiunt_.\r\n\r\nYou see I only consider this Constitution as electoral, and leading by\r\nsteps to the National Assembly. I do not enter into the internal\r\ngovernment of the departments, and their genealogy through the communes\r\nand cantons. These local governments are, in the original plan, to be as\r\nnearly as possible composed in the same manner and on the same\r\nprinciples with the elective assemblies. They are each of them bodies\r\nperfectly compact and rounded in themselves.\r\n\r\nYou cannot but perceive in this scheme, that it has a direct and\r\nimmediate tendency to sever France into a variety of republics, and to\r\nrender them totally independent of each other, without any direct\r\nconstitutional means of coherence, connection, or subordination, except\r\nwhat may be derived from their acquiescence in the determinations of the\r\ngeneral congress of the ambassadors from each independent republic. Such\r\nin reality is the National Assembly; and such governments, I admit, do\r\nexist in the world, though, in forms infinitely more suitable to the\r\nlocal and habitual circumstances of their people. But such associations,\r\nrather than bodies politic, have generally been the effect of necessity,\r\nnot choice; and I believe the present French power is the very first\r\nbody of citizens who, having obtained full authority to do with their\r\ncountry what they pleased, have chosen to dissever it in this barbarous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to observe, that, in the spirit of this geometrical\r\ndistribution and arithmetical arrangement, these pretended citizens\r\ntreat France exactly like a country of conquest. Acting as conquerors,\r\nthey have imitated the policy of the harshest of that harsh race. The\r\npolicy of such barbarous victors, who contemn a subdued people, and\r\ninsult their feelings, has ever been, as much as in them lay, to destroy\r\nall vestiges of the ancient country, in religion, in polity, in laws,\r\nand in manners; to confound all territorial limits; to produce a general\r\npoverty; to put up their properties to auction; to crush their princes,\r\nnobles, and pontiffs; to lay low everything which had lifted its head\r\nabove the level, or which could serve to combine or rally, in their\r\ndistresses, the disbanded people, under the standard of old opinion.\r\nThey have made France free in the manner in which those sincere friends\r\nto the rights of mankind, the Romans, freed Greece, Macedon, and other\r\nnations. They destroyed the bonds of their union, under color of\r\nproviding for the independence of each of their cities.\r\n\r\nWhen the members who compose these new bodies of cantons, communes, and\r\ndepartments, arrangements purposely produced through the medium of\r\nconfusion, begin to act, they will find themselves in a great measure\r\nstrangers to one another. The electors and elected throughout,\r\nespecially in the rural _cantons_, will be frequently without any civil\r\nhabitudes or connections, or any of that natural discipline which is the\r\nsoul of a true republic. Magistrates and collectors of revenue are now\r\nno longer acquainted with their districts, bishops with their dioceses,\r\nor curates with their parishes. These new colonies of the rights of men\r\nbear a strong resemblance to that sort of military colonies which\r\nTacitus has observed upon in the declining policy of Rome. In better and\r\nwiser days (whatever course they took with foreign nations) they were\r\ncareful to make the elements of a methodical subordination and\r\nsettlement to be coeval, and even to lay the foundations of discipline\r\nin the military.[122] But when all the good arts had fallen into ruin,\r\nthey proceeded, as your Assembly does, upon the equality of men, and\r\nwith as little judgment, and as little care for those things which make\r\na republic tolerable or durable. But in this, as well as almost every\r\ninstance, your new commonwealth is born and bred and fed in those\r\ncorruptions which mark degenerated and worn-out republics. Your child\r\ncomes into the world with the symptoms of death; the _facies\r\nHippocratica_ forms the character of its physiognomy and the prognostic\r\nof its fate.\r\n\r\nThe legislators who framed the ancient republics knew that their\r\nbusiness was too arduous to be accomplished with no better apparatus\r\nthan the metaphysics of an undergraduate and the mathematics and\r\narithmetic of an exciseman. They had to do with men, and they were\r\nobliged to study human nature. They had to do with citizens, and they\r\nwere obliged to study the effects of those habits which are\r\ncommunicated by the circumstances of civil life. They were sensible\r\nthat the operation of this second nature on the first produced a new\r\ncombination,--and thence arose many diversities amongst men, according\r\nto their birth, their education, their professions, the periods of their\r\nlives, their residence in towns or in the country, their several ways of\r\nacquiring and of fixing property, and according to the quality of the\r\nproperty itself, all which rendered them, as it were, so many different\r\nspecies of animals. From hence they thought themselves obliged to\r\ndispose their citizens into such classes, and to place them in such\r\nsituations in the state, as their peculiar habits might qualify them to\r\nfill, and to allot to them such appropriated privileges as might secure\r\nto them what their specific occasions required, and which might furnish\r\nto each description such force as might protect it in the conflict\r\ncaused by the diversity of interests that must exist, and must contend,\r\nin all complex society: for the legislator would have been ashamed that\r\nthe coarse husbandman should well know how to assort and to use his\r\nsheep, horses, and oxen, and should have enough of common sense not to\r\nabstract and equalize them all into animals, without providing for each\r\nkind an appropriate food, care, and employment,--whilst he, the\r\neconomist, disposer, and shepherd of his own kindred, subliming himself\r\ninto an airy metaphysician, was resolved to know nothing of his flocks\r\nbut as men in general. It is for this reason that Montesquieu observed,\r\nvery justly, that, in their classification of the citizens, the great\r\nlegislators of antiquity made the greatest display of their powers, and\r\neven soared above themselves. It is here that your modern legislators\r\nhave gone deep into the negative series, and sunk even below their own\r\nnothing. As the first sort of legislators attended to the different\r\nkinds of citizens, and combined them into one commonwealth, the others,\r\nthe metaphysical and alchemistical legislators, have taken the directly\r\ncontrary course. They have attempted to confound all sorts of citizens,\r\nas well as they could, into one homogeneous mass; and then they divided\r\nthis their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics. They reduce\r\nmen to loose counters, merely for the sake of simple telling, and not to\r\nfigures, whose power is to arise from their place in the table. The\r\nelements of their own metaphysics might have taught them better lessons.\r\nThe troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there\r\nwas something else in the intellectual world besides _substance_ and\r\n_quantity_. They might learn from the catechism of metaphysics that\r\nthere were eight heads more,[123] in every complex deliberation, which\r\nthey have never thought of; though these, of all the ten, are the\r\nsubject on which the skill of man can operate anything at all.\r\n\r\nSo far from this able disposition of some of the old republican\r\nlegislators, which follows with a solicitous accuracy the moral\r\nconditions and propensities of men, they have levelled and crushed\r\ntogether all the orders which they found, even under the coarse,\r\nunartificial arrangement of the monarchy, in which mode of government\r\nthe classing of the citizens is not of so much importance as in a\r\nrepublic. It is true, however, that every such classification, if\r\nproperly ordered, is good in all forms of government, and composes a\r\nstrong barrier against the excesses of despotism, as well as it is the\r\nnecessary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic. For want\r\nof something of this kind, if the present project of a republic should\r\nfail, all securities to a moderated freedom fail along with it, all the\r\nindirect restraints which mitigate despotism are removed; insomuch that,\r\nif monarchy should ever again obtain an entire ascendency in France,\r\nunder this or any other dynasty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily\r\ntempered, at setting out, by the wise and virtuous counsels of the\r\nprince, the most completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on\r\nearth. This is to play a most desperate game.\r\n\r\nThe confusion which attends on all such proceedings they even declare to\r\nbe one of their objects, and they hope to secure their Constitution by a\r\nterror of a return of those evils which attended their making it. \"By\r\nthis,\" say they, \"its destruction will become difficult to authority,\r\nwhich cannot break it up without the entire disorganization of the whole\r\nstate.\" They presume, that, if this authority should ever come to the\r\nsame degree of power that they have acquired, it would make a more\r\nmoderate and chastised use of it, and would piously tremble entirely to\r\ndisorganize the state in the savage manner that they have done. They\r\nexpect from the virtues of returning despotism the security which is to\r\nbe enjoyed by the offspring of their popular vices.\r\n\r\nI wish, Sir, that you and my readers would give an attentive perusal to\r\nthe work of M. de Calonne on this subject. It is, indeed, not only an\r\neloquent, but an able and instructive performance. I confine myself to\r\nwhat he says relative to the Constitution of the new state, and to the\r\ncondition of the revenue. As to the disputes of this minister with his\r\nrivals, I do not wish to pronounce upon them. As little do I mean to\r\nhazard any opinion concerning his ways and means, financial or\r\npolitical, for taking his country out of its present disgraceful and\r\ndeplorable situation of servitude, anarchy, bankruptcy, and beggary. I\r\ncannot speculate quite so sanguinely as he does: but he is a Frenchman,\r\nand has a closer duty relative to those objects, and better means of\r\njudging of them, than I can have. I wish that the formal avowal which he\r\nrefers to, made by one of the principal leaders in the Assembly,\r\nconcerning the tendency of their scheme to bring France not only from a\r\nmonarchy to a republic, but from a republic to a mere confederacy, may\r\nbe very particularly attended to. It adds new force to my observations:\r\nand, indeed, M. de Calonne's work supplies my deficiencies by many new\r\nand striking arguments on most of the subjects of this letter.[124]\r\n\r\nIt is this resolution to break their country into separate republics\r\nwhich has driven them into the greatest number of their difficulties and\r\ncontradictions. If it were not for this, all the questions of exact\r\nequality, and these balances, never to be settled, of individual rights,\r\npopulation, and contribution, would be wholly useless. The\r\nrepresentation, though derived from parts, would be a duty which equally\r\nregarded the whole. Each deputy to the Assembly would be the\r\nrepresentative of France, and of all its descriptions, of the many and\r\nof the few, of the rich and of the poor, of the great districts and of\r\nthe small. All these districts would themselves be subordinate to some\r\nstanding authority, existing independently of them,--an authority in\r\nwhich their representation, and everything that belongs to it,\r\noriginated, and to which it was pointed. This standing, unalterable,\r\nfundamental government would make, and it is the only thing which could\r\nmake, that territory truly and properly a whole. With us, when we elect\r\npopular representatives, we send them to a council in which each man\r\nindividually is a subject, and submitted to a government complete in all\r\nits ordinary functions. With you the elective Assembly is the sovereign,\r\nand the sole sovereign; all the members are therefore integral parts of\r\nthis sole sovereignty. But with us it is totally different. With us the\r\nrepresentative, separated from the other parts, can have no action and\r\nno existence. The government is the point of reference of the several\r\nmembers and districts of our representation. This is the centre of our\r\nunity. This government of reference is a trustee for the _whole_, and\r\nnot for the parts. So is the other branch of our public council: I mean\r\nthe House of Lords. With us the King and the Lords are several and joint\r\nsecurities for the equality of each district, each province, each city.\r\nWhen did you hear in Great Britain of any province suffering from the\r\ninequality of its representation? what district from having no\r\nrepresentation at all? Not only our monarchy and our peerage secure the\r\nequality on which our unity depends, but it is the spirit of the House\r\nof Commons itself. The very inequality of representation, which is so\r\nfoolishly complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us\r\nfrom thinking or acting as members for districts. Cornwall elects as\r\nmany members as all Scotland. But is Cornwall better taken care of than\r\nScotland? Few trouble their heads about any of your bases, out of some\r\ngiddy clubs. Most of those who wish for any change, upon any plausible\r\ngrounds, desire it on different ideas.\r\n\r\nYour new Constitution is the very reverse of ours in its principle; and\r\nI am astonished how any persons could dream of holding out anything done\r\nin it as an example for Great Britain. With you there is little, or\r\nrather no, connection between the last representative and the first\r\nconstituent. The member who goes to the National Assembly is not chosen\r\nby the people, nor accountable to them. There are three elections before\r\nhe is chosen; two sets of magistracy intervene between him and the\r\nprimary assembly, so as to render him, as I have said, an ambassador of\r\na state, and not the representative of the people within a state. By\r\nthis the whole spirit of the election is changed; nor can any corrective\r\nyour Constitution-mongers have devised render him anything else than\r\nwhat he is. The very attempt to do it would inevitably introduce a\r\nconfusion, if possible, more horrid than the present. There is no way to\r\nmake a connection between the original constituent and the\r\nrepresentative, but by the circuitous means which may lead the candidate\r\nto apply in the first instance to the primary electors, in order that by\r\ntheir authoritative instructions (and something more perhaps) these\r\nprimary electors may force the two succeeding bodies of electors to make\r\na choice agreeable to their wishes. But this would plainly subvert the\r\nwhole scheme. It would be to plunge them back into that tumult and\r\nconfusion of popular election, which, by their interposed gradation of\r\nelections, they mean to avoid, and at length to risk the whole fortune\r\nof the state with those who have the least knowledge of it and the\r\nleast interest in it. This is a perpetual dilemma, into which they are\r\nthrown by the vicious, weak, and contradictory principles they have\r\nchosen. Unless the people break up and level this gradation, it is plain\r\nthat they do not at all substantially elect to the Assembly; indeed,\r\nthey elect as little in appearance as reality.\r\n\r\nWhat is it we all seek for in an election? To answer its real purposes,\r\nyou must first possess the means of knowing the fitness of your man; and\r\nthen you must retain some hold upon him by personal obligation or\r\ndependence. For what end are these primary electors complimented, or\r\nrather mocked, with a choice? They can never know anything of the\r\nqualities of him that is to serve them, nor has he any obligation\r\nwhatsoever to them. Of all the powers unfit to be delegated by those who\r\nhave any real means of judging, that most peculiarly unfit is what\r\nrelates to a _personal_ choice. In case of abuse, that body of primary\r\nelectors never can call the representative to an account for his\r\nconduct. He is too far removed from them in the chain of representation.\r\nIf he acts improperly at the end of his two years' lease, it does not\r\nconcern him for two years more. By the new French Constitution the best\r\nand the wisest representatives go equally with the worst into this\r\n_Limbus Patrum_. Their bottoms are supposed foul, and they must go into\r\ndock to be refitted. Every man who has served in an Assembly is\r\nineligible for two years after. Just as these magistrates begin to learn\r\ntheir trade, like chimney-sweepers, they are disqualified for exercising\r\nit. Superficial, new, petulant acquisition, and interrupted, dronish,\r\nbroken, ill recollection, is to be the destined character of all your\r\nfuture governors. Your Constitution has too much of jealousy to have\r\nmuch of sense in it. You consider the breach of trust in the\r\nrepresentative so principally that you do not at all regard the question\r\nof his fitness to execute it.\r\n\r\nThis purgatory interval is not unfavorable to a faithless\r\nrepresentative, who may be as good a canvasser as he was a bad governor.\r\nIn this time he may cabal himself into a superiority over the wisest and\r\nmost virtuous. As, in the end, all the members of this elective\r\nConstitution are equally fugitive, and exist only for the election, they\r\nmay be no longer the same persons who had chosen him, to whom he is to\r\nbe responsible when he solicits for a renewal of his trust. To call all\r\nthe secondary electors of the _commune_ to account is ridiculous,\r\nimpracticable, and unjust: they may themselves have been deceived in\r\ntheir choice, as the third set of electors, those of the _department_,\r\nmay be in theirs. In your elections responsibility cannot exist.\r\n\r\nFinding no sort of principle of coherence with each other in the nature\r\nand constitution of the several new republics of France, I considered\r\nwhat cement the legislators had provided for them from any extraneous\r\nmaterials. Their confederations, their _spectacles_, their civic feasts,\r\nand their enthusiasm I take no notice of; they are nothing but mere\r\ntricks; but tracing their policy through their actions, I think I can\r\ndistinguish the arrangements by which they propose to hold these\r\nrepublics together. The first is the _confiscation_, with the compulsory\r\npaper currency annexed to it; the second is the supreme power of the\r\ncity of Paris; the third is the general army of the state. Of this last\r\nI shall reserve what I have to say, until I come to consider the army\r\nas an head by itself.\r\n\r\nAs to the operation of the first (the confiscation and paper currency)\r\nmerely as a cement, I cannot deny that these, the one depending on the\r\nother, may for some time compose some sort of cement, if their madness\r\nand folly in the management, and in the tempering of the parts together,\r\ndoes not produce a repulsion in the very outset. But allowing to the\r\nscheme some coherence and some duration, it appears to me, that, if,\r\nafter a while, the confiscation should not be found sufficient to\r\nsupport the paper coinage, (as I am morally certain it will not,) then,\r\ninstead of cementing, it will add infinitely to the dissociation,\r\ndistraction, and confusion of these confederate republics, both with\r\nrelation to each other and to the several parts within themselves. But\r\nif the confiscation should so far succeed as to sink the paper currency,\r\nthe cement is gone with the circulation. In the mean time its binding\r\nforce will be very uncertain, and it will straiten or relax with every\r\nvariation in the credit of the paper.\r\n\r\nOne thing only is certain in this scheme, which is an effect seemingly\r\ncollateral, but direct, I have no doubt, in the minds of those who\r\nconduct this business; that is, its effect in producing an _oligarchy_\r\nin every one of the republics. A paper circulation, not founded on any\r\nreal money deposited or engaged for, amounting already to four-and-forty\r\nmillions of English money, and this currency by force substituted in the\r\nplace of the coin of the kingdom, becoming thereby the substance of its\r\nrevenue, as well as the medium of all its commercial and civil\r\nintercourse, must put the whole of what power, authority, and influence\r\nis left, in any form whatsoever it may assume, into the hands of the\r\nmanagers and conductors of this circulation.\r\n\r\nIn England we feel the influence of the Bank, though it is only the\r\ncentre of a voluntary dealing. He knows little, indeed, of the influence\r\nof money upon mankind, who does not see the force of the management of a\r\nmoneyed concern which is so much more extensive, and in its nature so\r\nmuch more depending on the managers, than any of ours. But this is not\r\nmerely a money concern. There is another member in the system\r\ninseparably connected with this money management. It consists in the\r\nmeans of drawing out at discretion portions of the confiscated lands for\r\nsale, and carrying on a process of continual transmutation of paper into\r\nland and land into paper. When we follow this process in its effects, we\r\nmay conceive something of the intensity of the force with which this\r\nsystem must operate. By this means the spirit of money-jobbing and\r\nspeculation goes into the mass of land itself, and incorporates with it.\r\nBy this kind of operation, that species of property becomes, as it were,\r\nvolatilized; it assumes an unnatural and monstrous activity, and thereby\r\nthrows into the hands of the several managers, principal and\r\nsubordinate, Parisian and provincial, all the representative of money,\r\nand perhaps a full tenth part of all the land in France, which has now\r\nacquired the worst and most pernicious part of the evil of a paper\r\ncirculation, the greatest possible uncertainty in its value. They have\r\nreversed the Latonian kindness to the landed property of Delos. They\r\nhave sent theirs to be blown about, like the light fragments of a wreck,\r\n_oras et littora circum_.\r\n\r\nThe new dealers, being all habitually adventurers, and without any fixed\r\nhabits or local predilections, will purchase to job out again, as the\r\nmarket of paper or of money or of land shall present an advantage. For\r\nthough a holy bishop thinks that agriculture will derive great\r\nadvantages from the \"_enlightened_\" usurers who are to purchase the\r\nChurch confiscations, I, who am not a good, but an old farmer, with\r\ngreat humility beg leave to tell his late Lordship that usury is not a\r\ntutor of agriculture; and if the word \"enlightened\" be understood\r\naccording to the new dictionary, as it always is in your new schools, I\r\ncannot conceive how a man's not believing in God can teach him to\r\ncultivate the earth with the least of any additional skill or\r\nencouragement. \"_Diis immortalibus sero_,\" said an old Roman, when he\r\nheld one handle of the plough, whilst Death held the other. Though you\r\nwere to join in the commission all the directors of the two Academies to\r\nthe directors of the _Caisse d'Escompte_, an old experienced peasant is\r\nworth them all. I have got more information upon a curious and\r\ninteresting branch of husbandry, in one short conversation with an old\r\nCarthusian monk, than I have derived from all the bank directors that I\r\nhave ever conversed with. However, there is no cause for apprehension\r\nfrom the meddling of money-dealers with rural economy. These gentlemen\r\nare too wise in their generation. At first, perhaps, their tender and\r\nsusceptible imaginations may be captivated with the innocent and\r\nunprofitable delights of a pastoral life; but in a little time they will\r\nfind that agriculture is a trade much more laborious and much less\r\nlucrative than that which they had left. After making its panegyric,\r\nthey will turn their backs on it, like their great precursor and\r\nprototype. They may, like him, begin by singing, \"_Beatus ille_\"--but\r\nwhat will be the end?\r\n\r\n    Hæc ubi locutus fœnerator Alphius,\r\n      Jam jam futurus rusticus,\r\n    Omnem relegit Idibus pecuniam,\r\n      Quærit Calendis ponere.\r\n\r\nThey will cultivate the _Caisse d'Église_, under the sacred auspices of\r\nthis prelate, with much more profit than its vineyards and its\r\ncorn-fields. They will employ their talents according to their habits\r\nand their interests. They will not follow the plough, whilst they can\r\ndirect treasuries and govern provinces.\r\n\r\nYour legislators, in everything new, are the very first who have founded\r\na commonwealth upon gaming, and infused this spirit into it as its vital\r\nbreath. The great object in these politics is to metamorphose France\r\nfrom a great kingdom into one great play-table,--to turn its inhabitants\r\ninto a nation of gamesters,--to make speculation as extensive as\r\nlife,--to mix it with all its concerns,--and to divert the whole of the\r\nhopes and fears of the people from their usual channels into the\r\nimpulses, passions, and superstitions of those who live on chances. They\r\nloudly proclaim their opinion, that this their present system of a\r\nrepublic cannot possibly exist without this kind of gaming fund, and\r\nthat the very thread of its life is spun out of the staple of these\r\nspeculations. The old gaming in funds was mischievous enough,\r\nundoubtedly; but it was so only to individuals. Even when it had its\r\ngreatest extent, in the Mississippi and South Sea, it affected but few,\r\ncomparatively; where it extends further, as in lotteries, the spirit has\r\nbut a single object. But where the law, which in most circumstances\r\nforbids, and in none countenances gaming, is itself debauched, so as to\r\nreverse its nature and policy, and expressly to force the subject to\r\nthis destructive table, by bringing the spirit and symbols of gaming\r\ninto the minutest matters, and engaging everybody in it, and in\r\neverything, a more dreadful epidemic distemper of that kind is spread\r\nthan yet has appeared in the world. With you a man can neither earn nor\r\nbuy his dinner without a speculation. What he receives in the morning\r\nwill not have the same value at night. What he is compelled to take as\r\npay for an old debt will not be received as the same, when he comes to\r\npay a debt contracted by himself; nor will it be the same, when by\r\nprompt payment he would avoid contracting any debt at all. Industry must\r\nwither away. Economy must be driven from your country. Careful provision\r\nwill have no existence. Who will labor without knowing the amount of his\r\npay? Who will study to increase what none can estimate? Who will\r\naccumulate, when he does not know the value of what he saves? If you\r\nabstract it from its uses in gaming, to accumulate your paper wealth\r\nwould be, not the providence of a man, but the distempered instinct of a\r\njackdaw.\r\n\r\nThe truly melancholy part of the policy of systematically making a\r\nnation of gamesters is this,--that, though all are forced to play, few\r\ncan understand the game, and fewer still are in a condition to avail\r\nthemselves of that knowledge. The many must be the dupes of the few who\r\nconduct the machine of these speculations. What effect it must have on\r\nthe country-people is visible. The townsman can calculate from day to\r\nday; not so the inhabitant of the country. When the peasant first brings\r\nhis corn to market, the magistrate in the towns obliges him to take the\r\nassignat at par; when he goes to the shop with this money, he finds it\r\nseven per cent the worse for crossing the way. This market he will not\r\nreadily resort to again. The towns-people will be inflamed; they will\r\nforce the country-people to bring their corn. Resistance will begin, and\r\nthe murders of Paris and St. Denis may be renewed through all France.\r\n\r\nWhat signifies the empty compliment paid to the country, by giving it,\r\nperhaps, more than its share in the theory of your representation? Where\r\nhave you placed the real power over moneyed and landed circulation?\r\nWhere have you placed the means of raising and falling the value of\r\nevery man's freehold? Those whose operations can take from or add ten\r\nper cent to the possessions of every man in France must be the masters\r\nof every man in France. The whole of the power obtained by this\r\nRevolution will settle in the towns among the burghers, and the moneyed\r\ndirectors who lead them. The landed gentleman, the yeoman, and the\r\npeasant have, none of them, habits or inclinations or experience which\r\ncan lead them to any share in this the sole source of power and\r\ninfluence now left in France. The very nature of a country life, the\r\nvery nature of landed property, in all the occupations and all the\r\npleasures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the sole way\r\nof procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impossible amongst\r\ncountry-people. Combine them by all the art you can, and all the\r\nindustry, they are always dissolving into individuality. Anything in the\r\nnature of incorporation is almost impracticable amongst them. Hope,\r\nfear, alarm, jealousy, the ephemerous tale that does its business and\r\ndies in a day, all these things, which are the reins and spurs by which\r\nleaders check or urge the minds of followers, are not easily employed,\r\nor hardly at all, amongst scattered people. They assemble, they arm,\r\nthey act, with the utmost difficulty, and at the greatest charge. Their\r\nefforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be sustained. They cannot\r\nproceed systematically. If the country-gentlemen attempt an influence\r\nthrough the mere income of their property, what is it to that of those\r\nwho have ten times their income to sell, and who can ruin their property\r\nby bringing their plunder to meet it at market? If the landed man wishes\r\nto mortgage, he falls the value of his land and raises the value of\r\nassignats. He augments the power of his enemy by the very means he must\r\ntake to contend with him. The country-gentleman, therefore, the officer\r\nby sea and land, the man of liberal views and habits, attached to no\r\nprofession, will be as completely excluded from the government of his\r\ncountry as if he were legislatively proscribed. It is obvious, that, in\r\nthe towns, all the things which conspire against the country-gentleman\r\ncombine in favor of the money manager and director. In towns combination\r\nis natural. The habits of burghers, their occupations, their diversion,\r\ntheir business, their idleness, continually bring them into mutual\r\ncontact. Their virtues and their vices are sociable; they are always in\r\ngarrison; and they come embodied and half-disciplined into the hands of\r\nthose who mean to form them for civil or military action.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations leave no doubt on my mind, that, if this\r\nmonster of a Constitution can continue, France will be wholly governed\r\nby the agitators in corporations, by societies in the towns, formed of\r\ndirectors in assignats, and trustees for the sale of Church lands,\r\nattorneys, agents, money-jobbers, speculators, and adventurers,\r\ncomposing an ignoble oligarchy, founded on the destruction of the crown,\r\nthe Church, the nobility, and the people. Here end all the deceitful\r\ndreams and visions of the equality and rights of men. In \"the Serbonian\r\nbog\" of this base oligarchy they are all absorbed, sunk, and lost\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThough human eyes cannot trace them, one would be tempted to think some\r\ngreat offences in France must cry to Heaven, which has thought fit to\r\npunish it with a subjection to a vile and inglorious domination, in\r\nwhich no comfort or compensation is to be found in any even of those\r\nfalse splendors which, playing about other tyrannies, prevent mankind\r\nfrom feeling themselves dishonored even whilst they are oppressed. I\r\nmust confess I am touched with a sorrow mixed with some indignation, at\r\nthe conduct of a few men, once of great rank, and still of great\r\ncharacter, who, deluded with specious names, have engaged in a business\r\ntoo deep for the line of their understanding to fathom,--who have lent\r\ntheir fair reputation and the authority of their high-sounding names to\r\nthe designs of men with whom they could not be acquainted, and have\r\nthereby made their very virtues operate to the ruin of their country.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the first cementing principle.\r\n\r\nThe second material of cement for their new republic is the superiority\r\nof the city of Paris; and this, I admit, is strongly connected with the\r\nother cementing principle of paper circulation and confiscation. It is\r\nin this part of the project we must look for the cause of the\r\ndestruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions,\r\necclesiastical and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient\r\ncombinations of things, as well as the formation of so many small\r\nunconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is evidently one\r\ngreat spring of all their politics. It is through the power of Paris,\r\nnow become the centre and focus of jobbing, that the leaders of this\r\nfaction direct, or rather command, the whole legislative and the whole\r\nexecutive government. Everything, therefore, must be done which can\r\nconfirm the authority of that city over the other republics. Paris is\r\ncompact; she has an enormous strength, wholly disproportioned to the\r\nforce of any of the square republics; and this strength is collected and\r\ncondensed within a narrow compass. Paris has a natural and easy\r\nconnection of its parts, which will not be affected by any scheme of a\r\ngeometrical constitution; nor does it much signify whether its\r\nproportion of representation be more or less, since it has the whole\r\ndraught of fishes in its drag-net. The other divisions of the kingdom,\r\nbeing hackled and torn to pieces, and separated from all their habitual\r\nmeans and even principles of union, cannot, for some time at least,\r\nconfederate against her. Nothing was to be left in all the subordinate\r\nmembers, but weakness, disconnection, and confusion. To confirm this\r\npart of the plan, the Assembly has lately come to a resolution that no\r\ntwo of their republics shall have the same commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nTo a person who takes a view of the whole, the strength of Paris, thus\r\nformed, will appear a system of general weakness. It is boasted that the\r\ngeometrical policy has been adopted, that all local ideas should be\r\nsunk, and that the people should be no longer Gascons, Picards, Bretons,\r\nNormans,--but Frenchmen, with one country, one heart, and one Assembly.\r\nBut, instead of being all Frenchmen, the greater likelihood is that the\r\ninhabitants of that region will shortly have no country. No man ever was\r\nattached by a sense of pride, partiality, or real affection, to a\r\ndescription of square measurement. He never will glory in belonging to\r\nthe chequer No. 71, or to any other badge-ticket. We begin our public\r\naffections in our families. No cold relation is a zealous citizen. We\r\npass on to our neighborhoods, and our habitual provincial connections.\r\nThese are inns and resting-places. Such divisions of our country as have\r\nbeen formed by habit, and not by a sudden jerk of authority, were so\r\nmany little images of the great country, in which the heart found\r\nsomething which it could fill. The love to the whole is not extinguished\r\nby this subordinate partiality. Perhaps it is a sort of elemental\r\ntraining to those higher and more large regards by which alone men come\r\nto be affected, as with their own concern, in the prosperity of a\r\nkingdom so extensive as that of France. In that general territory\r\nitself, as in the old name of Provinces, the citizens are interested\r\nfrom old prejudices and unreasoned habits, and not on account of the\r\ngeometric properties of its figure. The power and preëminence of Paris\r\ndoes certainly press down and hold these republics together as long as\r\nit lasts: but, for the reasons I have already given you, I think it can\r\nnot last very long.\r\n\r\nPassing from the civil creating and the civil cementing principles of\r\nthis Constitution to the National Assembly, which is to appear and act\r\nas sovereign, we see a body in its constitution with every possible\r\npower and no possible external control. We see a body without\r\nfundamental laws, without established maxims, without respected rules of\r\nproceeding, which nothing can keep firm to any system whatsoever. Their\r\nidea of their powers is always taken at the utmost stretch of\r\nlegislative competency, and their examples for common cases from the\r\nexceptions of the most urgent necessity. The future is to be in most\r\nrespects like the present Assembly; but, by the mode of the new\r\nelections and the tendency of the new circulations, it will be purged of\r\nthe small degree of internal control existing in a minority chosen\r\noriginally from various interests, and preserving something of their\r\nspirit. If possible, the next Assembly must be worse than the present.\r\nThe present, by destroying and altering everything, will leave to their\r\nsuccessors apparently nothing popular to do. They will be roused by\r\nemulation and example to enterprises the boldest and the most absurd. To\r\nsuppose such an Assembly sitting in perfect quietude is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nYour all-sufficient legislators, in their hurry to do everything at\r\nonce, have forgot one thing that seems essential, and which, I believe,\r\nnever has been before, in the theory or the practice, omitted by any\r\nprojector of a republic. They have forgot to constitute a _senate_, or\r\nsomething of that nature and character. Never, before this time, was\r\nheard of a body politic composed of one legislative and active assembly,\r\nand its executive officers, without such a council: without something to\r\nwhich foreign states might connect themselves,--something to which, in\r\nthe ordinary detail of government, the people could look up,--something\r\nwhich might give a bias and steadiness, and preserve something like\r\nconsistency in the proceedings of state. Such a body kings generally\r\nhave as a council. A monarchy may exist without it; but it seems to be\r\nin the very essence of a republican government. It holds a sort of\r\nmiddle place between the supreme power exercised by the people, or\r\nimmediately delegated from them, and the mere executive. Of this there\r\nare no traces in your Constitution; and in providing nothing of this\r\nkind, your Solons and Numas have, as much as in anything else,\r\ndiscovered a sovereign incapacity.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our eyes to what they have done towards the formation of\r\nan executive power. For this they have chosen a degraded king. This\r\ntheir first executive officer is to be a machine, without any sort of\r\ndeliberative discretion in any one act of his function. At best, he is\r\nbut a channel to convey to the National Assembly such matter as may\r\nimport that body to know. If he had been made the exclusive channel, the\r\npower would not have been without its importance, though infinitely\r\nperilous to those who would choose to exercise it. But public\r\nintelligence and statement of facts may pass to the Assembly with equal\r\nauthenticity through any other conveyance. As to the means, therefore,\r\nof giving a direction to measures by the statement of an authorized\r\nreporter, this office of intelligence is as nothing.\r\n\r\nTo consider the French scheme of an executive officer, in its two\r\nnatural divisions of civil and political.--In the first it must be\r\nobserved, that, according to the new Constitution, the higher parts of\r\njudicature, in either of its lines, are not in the king. The king of\r\nFrance is not the fountain of justice. The judges, neither the original\r\nnor the appellate, are of his nomination. He neither proposes the\r\ncandidates nor has a negative on the choice. He is not even the public\r\nprosecutor. He serves only as a notary, to authenticate the choice made\r\nof the judges in the several districts. By his officers he is to execute\r\ntheir sentence. When we look into the true nature of his authority, he\r\nappears to be nothing more than a chief of bumbailiffs,\r\nsergeants-at-mace, catchpoles, jailers, and hangmen. It is impossible to\r\nplace anything called royalty in a more degrading point of view. A\r\nthousand times better it had been for the dignity of this unhappy\r\nprince, that he had nothing at all to do with the administration of\r\njustice, deprived as he is of all that is venerable and all that is\r\nconsolatory in that function, without power of originating any process,\r\nwithout a power of suspension, mitigation, or pardon. Everything in\r\njustice that is vile and odious is thrown upon him. It was not for\r\nnothing that the Assembly has been at such pains to remove the stigma\r\nfrom certain offices, when they were resolved to place the person who\r\nhad lately been their king in a situation but one degree above the\r\nexecutioner, and in an office nearly of the same quality. It is not in\r\nNature, that, situated as the king of the French now is, he can respect\r\nhimself or can be respected by others.\r\n\r\nView this new executive officer on the side of his political capacity,\r\nas he acts under the orders of the National Assembly. To execute laws is\r\na royal office; to execute orders is not to be a king. However, a\r\npolitical executive magistracy, though merely such, is a great trust. It\r\nis a trust, indeed, that has much depending upon its faithful and\r\ndiligent performance, both in the person presiding in it and in all its\r\nsubordinates. Means of performing this duty ought to be given by\r\nregulation; and dispositions towards it ought to be infused by the\r\ncircumstances attendant on the trust. It ought to be environed with\r\ndignity, authority, and consideration, and it ought to lead to glory.\r\nThe office of execution is an office of exertion. It is not from\r\nimpotence we are to expect the tasks of power. What sort of person is a\r\nking to command executory service, who has no means whatsoever to reward\r\nit:--not in a permanent office; not in a grant of land; no, not in a\r\npension of fifty pounds a year; not in the vainest and most trivial\r\ntitle? In France the king is no more the fountain of honor than he is\r\nthe fountain of justice. All rewards, all distinctions, are in other\r\nhands. Those who serve the king can be actuated by no natural motive but\r\nfear,--by a fear of everything except their master. His functions of\r\ninternal coercion are as odious as those which he exercises in the\r\ndepartment of justice. If relief is to be given to any municipality, the\r\nAssembly gives it. If troops are to be sent to reduce them to obedience\r\nto the Assembly, the king is to execute the order; and upon every\r\noccasion he is to be spattered over with the blood of his people. He has\r\nno negative; yet his name and authority is used to enforce every harsh\r\ndecree. Nay, he must concur in the butchery of those who shall attempt\r\nto free him from his imprisonment, or show the slightest attachment to\r\nhis person or to his ancient authority.\r\n\r\nExecutive magistracy ought to be constituted in such a manner that those\r\nwho compose it should be disposed to love and to venerate those whom\r\nthey are bound to obey. A purposed neglect, or, what is worse, a\r\nliteral, but perverse and malignant obedience, must be the ruin of the\r\nwisest counsels. In vain will the law attempt to anticipate or to follow\r\nsuch studied neglects and fraudulent attentions. To make them act\r\nzealously is not in the competence of law. Kings, even such as are truly\r\nkings, may and ought to bear the freedom of subjects that are obnoxious\r\nto them. They may, too, without derogating from themselves, bear even\r\nthe authority of such persons, if it promotes their service. Louis the\r\nThirteenth mortally hated the Cardinal de Richelieu; but his support of\r\nthat minister against his rivals was the source of all the glory of his\r\nreign, and the solid foundation of his throne itself. Louis the\r\nFourteenth, when come to the throne, did not love the Cardinal Mazarin;\r\nbut for his interests he preserved him in power. When old, he detested\r\nLouvois; but for years, whilst he faithfully served his greatness, he\r\nendured his person. When George the Second took Mr. Pitt, who certainly\r\nwas not agreeable to him, into his councils, he did nothing which could\r\nhumble a wise sovereign. But these ministers, who were chosen by\r\naffairs, not by affections, acted in the name of and in trust for kings,\r\nand not as their avowed constitutional and ostensible masters. I think\r\nit impossible that any king, when he has recovered his first terrors,\r\ncan cordially infuse vivacity and vigor into measures which he knows to\r\nbe dictated by those who, he must be persuaded, are in the highest\r\ndegree ill affected to his person. Will any ministers, who serve such a\r\nking (or whatever he may be called) with but a decent appearance of\r\nrespect, cordially obey the orders of those whom but the other day in\r\nhis name they had committed to the Bastile? will they obey the orders\r\nof those whom, whilst they were exercising despotic justice upon them,\r\nthey conceived they were treating with lenity, and for whom in a prison\r\nthey thought they had provided an asylum? If you expect such obedience,\r\namongst your other innovations and regenerations, you ought to make a\r\nrevolution in Nature, and provide a new constitution, for the human\r\nmind: otherwise your supreme government cannot harmonize with its\r\nexecutory system. There are cases in which we cannot take up with names\r\nand abstractions. You may call half a dozen leading individuals, whom we\r\nhave reason to fear and hate, the nation. It makes no other difference\r\nthan to make us fear and hate them the more. If it had been thought\r\njustifiable and expedient to make such a revolution by such means and\r\nthrough such persons as you have made yours, it would have been more\r\nwise to have completed the business of the fifth and sixth of October.\r\nThe new executive officer would then owe his situation to those who are\r\nhis creators as well as his masters; and he might be bound in interest,\r\nin the society of crime, and (if in crimes there could be virtues) in\r\ngratitude, to serve those who had promoted him to a place of great lucre\r\nand great sensual indulgence,--and of something more: for more he must\r\nhave received from those who certainly would not have limited an\r\naggrandized creature as they have done a submitting antagonist.\r\n\r\nA king circumstanced as the present, if he is totally stupefied by his\r\nmisfortunes, so as to think it not the necessity, but the premium and\r\nprivilege of life, to eat and sleep, without any regard to glory, can\r\nnever be fit for the office. If he feels as men commonly feel, he must\r\nhe sensible that an office so circumstanced is one in which he can\r\nobtain no fame or reputation. He has no generous interest that can\r\nexcite him to action. At best, his conduct will be passive and\r\ndefensive. To inferior people such an office might be matter of honor.\r\nBut to be raised to it and to descend to it are different things, and\r\nsuggest different sentiments. Does he _really_ name the ministers? They\r\nwill have a sympathy with him. Are they forced upon him? The whole\r\nbusiness between them and the nominal king will be mutual counteraction.\r\nIn all other countries the office of ministers of state is of the\r\nhighest dignity. In France it is full of peril, and incapable of glory.\r\nRivals, however, they will have in their nothingness, whilst shallow\r\nambition exists in the world, or the desire of a miserable salary is an\r\nincentive to short-sighted avarice. Those competitors of the ministers\r\nare enabled by your Constitution to attack them in their vital parts,\r\nwhilst they have not the means of repelling their charges in any other\r\nthan the degrading character of culprits. The ministers of state in\r\nPrance are the only persons in that country who are incapable of a share\r\nin the national councils. What ministers! What councils! What a\r\nnation!--But they are responsible. It is a poor service that is to be\r\nhad from responsibility. The elevation of mind to be derived from fear\r\nwill never make a nation glorious. Responsibility prevents crimes. It\r\nmakes all attempts against the laws dangerous. But for a principle of\r\nactive and zealous service, none but idiots could think of it. Is the\r\nconduct of a war to be trusted to a man who may abhor its\r\nprinciple,--who, in every step he may take to render it successful,\r\nconfirms the power of those by whom he is oppressed? Will foreign\r\nstates seriously treat with him who has no prerogative of peace or\r\nwar,--no, not so much as in a single vote by himself or his ministers,\r\nor by any one whom he can possibly influence? A state of contempt is not\r\na state for a prince: better get rid of him at once.\r\n\r\nI know it will be said that these humors in the court and executive\r\ngovernment will continue only through this generation, and that the king\r\nhas been brought to declare the dauphin shall be educated in a\r\nconformity to his situation. If he is made to conform to his situation,\r\nhe will have no education at all. His training must be worse even than\r\nthat of an arbitrary monarch. If he reads,--whether he reads or not,\r\nsome good or evil genius will tell him his ancestors were kings.\r\nThenceforward his object must be to assert himself and to avenge his\r\nparents. This you will say is not his duty. That may be; but it is\r\nNature; and whilst you pique Nature against you, you do unwisely to\r\ntrust to duty. In this futile scheme of polity, the state nurses in its\r\nbosom, for the present, a source of weakness, perplexity, counteraction,\r\ninefficiency, and decay; and it prepares the means of its final ruin. In\r\nshort, I see nothing in the executive force (I cannot call it authority)\r\nthat has even an appearance of vigor, or that has the smallest degree of\r\njust correspondence or symmetry or amicable relation with the supreme\r\npower, either as it now exists, or as it is planned for the future\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nYou have settled, by an economy as perverted as the policy, two[125]\r\nestablishments of government,--one real, one fictitious: both\r\nmaintained at a vast expense; but the fictitious at, I think, the\r\ngreatest. Such a machine as the latter is not worth the grease of its\r\nwheels. The expense is exorbitant; and neither the show nor the use\r\ndeserve the tenth part of the charge.--Oh! but I don't do justice to the\r\ntalents of the legislators: I don't allow, as I ought to do, for\r\nnecessity. Their scheme of executive force was not their choice. This\r\npageant must be kept. The people would not consent to part with\r\nit.--Right: I understand you. You do, in spite of your grand theories,\r\nto which you would have heaven and earth to bend, you do know how to\r\nconform yourselves to the nature and circumstances of things. But when\r\nyou were obliged to conform thus far to circumstances, you ought to have\r\ncarried your submission farther, and to have made, what you were obliged\r\nto take, a proper instrument, and useful to its end. That was in your\r\npower. For instance, among many others, it was in your power to leave to\r\nyour king the right of peace and war.--What! to leave to the executive\r\nmagistrate the most dangerous of all prerogatives?--I know none more\r\ndangerous; nor any one more necessary to be so trusted. I do not say\r\nthat this prerogative ought to be trusted to your king, unless he\r\nenjoyed other auxiliary trusts along with it, which he does not now\r\nhold. But, if he did possess them, hazardous as they are undoubtedly,\r\nadvantages would arise from such a Constitution, more than compensating\r\nthe risk. There is no other way of keeping the several potentates of\r\nEurope from intriguing distinctly and personally with the members of\r\nyour Assembly, from intermeddling in all your concerns, and fomenting,\r\nin the heart of your country, the most pernicious of all\r\nfactions,--factions in the interest and under the direction of foreign\r\npowers. From that worst of evils, thank God, we are still free. Your\r\nskill, if you had any, would be well employed to find out indirect\r\ncorrectives and controls upon this perilous trust. If you did not like\r\nthose which in England we have chosen, your leaders might have exerted\r\ntheir abilities in contriving better. If it were necessary to exemplify\r\nthe consequences of such an executive government as yours, in the\r\nmanagement of great affairs, I should refer you to the late reports of\r\nM. de Montmorin to the National Assembly, and all the other proceedings\r\nrelative to the differences between Great Britain and Spain. It would be\r\ntreating your understanding with disrespect to point them out to you.\r\n\r\nI hear that the persons who are called ministers have signified an\r\nintention of resigning their places. I am rather astonished that they\r\nhave not resigned long since. For the universe I would not have stood in\r\nthe situation in which they have been for this last twelvemonth. They\r\nwished well, I take it for granted, to the Revolution. Let this fact be\r\nas it may, they could not, placed as they were upon an eminence, though\r\nan eminence of humiliation, but be the first to see collectively, and to\r\nfeel each in his own department, the evils which have been produced by\r\nthat Revolution. In every step which they took, or forbore to take, they\r\nmust have felt the degraded situation of their country, and their utter\r\nincapacity of serving it. They are in a species of subordinate servitude\r\nin which no men before them were ever seen. Without confidence from\r\ntheir sovereign on whom they were forced, or from the Assembly who\r\nforced them upon him, all the noble functions of their office are\r\nexecuted by committees of the Assembly, without any regard whatsoever to\r\ntheir personal or their official authority. They are to execute, without\r\npower; they are to be responsible, without discretion; they are to\r\ndeliberate, without choice. In their puzzled situation, under two\r\nsovereigns, over neither of whom they have any influence, they must act\r\nin such a manner as (in effect, whatever they may intend) sometimes to\r\nbetray the one, sometimes the other, and always to betray themselves.\r\nSuch has been their situation; such must be the situation of those who\r\nsucceed them. I have much respect, and many good wishes, for M. Necker.\r\nI am obliged to him for attentions. I thought, when his enemies had\r\ndriven him from Versailles, that his exile was a subject of most serious\r\ncongratulation. _Sed multæ urbes et publica vota vicerunt_. He is now\r\nsitting on the ruins of the finances and of the monarchy of France.\r\n\r\nA great deal more might be observed on the strange constitution of the\r\nexecutory part of the new government; but fatigue must give bounds to\r\nthe discussion of subjects which in themselves have hardly any limits.\r\n\r\nAs little genius and talent am I able to perceive in the plan of\r\njudicature formed by the National Assembly. According to their\r\ninvariable course, the framers of your Constitution have begun with the\r\nutter abolition of the parliaments. These venerable bodies, like the\r\nrest of the old government, stood in need of reform, even though there\r\nshould be no change made in the monarchy. They required several more\r\nalterations to adapt them to the system of a free Constitution. But\r\nthey had particulars in their constitution, and those not a few, which\r\ndeserved approbation from the wise. They possessed one fundamental\r\nexcellence: they were independent. The most doubtful circumstance\r\nattendant on their office, that of its being vendible, contributed,\r\nhowever, to this independency of character. They held for life. Indeed,\r\nthey may be said to have held by inheritance. Appointed by the monarch,\r\nthey were considered as nearly out of his power. The most determined\r\nexertions of that authority against them only showed their radical\r\nindependence. They composed permanent bodies politic, constituted to\r\nresist arbitrary innovation; and from that corporate constitution, and\r\nfrom most of their forms, they were well calculated to afford both\r\ncertainty and stability to the laws. They had been a safe asylum to\r\nsecure these laws, in all the revolutions of humor and opinion. They had\r\nsaved that sacred deposit of the country during the reigns of arbitrary\r\nprinces and the struggles of arbitrary factions. They kept alive the\r\nmemory and record of the Constitution. They were the great security to\r\nprivate property; which might be said (when personal liberty had no\r\nexistence) to be, in fact, as well guarded in France as in any other\r\ncountry. Whatever is supreme in a state ought to have, as much as\r\npossible, ifs judicial authority so constituted as not only not to\r\ndepend upon it, but in some sort to balance it. It ought to give a\r\nsecurity to its justice against its power. It ought to make its\r\njudicature, as it were, something exterior to the state.\r\n\r\nThose parliaments had furnished, not the best certainly, but some\r\nconsiderable corrective to the excesses and vices of the monarchy. Such\r\nan independent judicature was ten times more necessary when a democracy\r\nbecame the absolute power of the country. In that Constitution,\r\nelective, temporary, local judges, such as you have contrived,\r\nexercising their dependent functions in a narrow society, must be the\r\nworst of all tribunals. In them it will be vain to look for any\r\nappearance of justice towards strangers, towards the obnoxious rich,\r\ntowards the minority of routed parties, towards all those who in the\r\nelection have supported unsuccessful candidates. It will be impossible\r\nto keep the new tribunals clear of the worst spirit of faction. All\r\ncontrivances by ballot we know experimentally to be vain and childish to\r\nprevent a discovery of inclinations. Where they may the best answer the\r\npurposes of concealment, they answer to produce suspicion, and this is a\r\nstill more mischievous cause of partiality.\r\n\r\nIf the parliaments had been preserved, instead of being dissolved at so\r\nruinous a change to the nation, they might have served in this new\r\ncommonwealth, perhaps not precisely the same, (I do not mean an exact\r\nparallel,) but near the same purposes as the court and senate of\r\nAreopagus did in Athens: that is, as one of the balances and correctives\r\nto the evils of a light and unjust democracy. Every one knows that this\r\ntribunal was the great stay of that state; every one knows with what\r\ncare it was upheld, and with what a religious awe it was consecrated.\r\nThe parliaments were not wholly free from faction, I admit; but this\r\nevil was exterior and accidental, and not so much the vice of their\r\nconstitution itself as it must be in your new contrivance of sexennial\r\nelective judicatories. Several English commend the abolition of the old\r\ntribunals, as supposing that they determined everything by bribery and\r\ncorruption. But they have stood the test of monarchic and republican\r\nscrutiny. The court was well disposed to prove corruption on those\r\nbodies, when they were dissolved in 1771; those who have again dissolved\r\nthem would have done the same, if they could; but both inquisitions\r\nhaving failed, I conclude that gross pecuniary corruption must have been\r\nrather rare amongst them.\r\n\r\nIt would have been prudent, along with the parliaments, to preserve\r\ntheir ancient power of registering, and of remonstrating at least upon,\r\nall the decrees of the National Assembly, as they did upon those which\r\npassed in the time of the monarchy. It would be a means of squaring the\r\noccasional decrees of a democracy to some principles of general\r\njurisprudence. The vice of the ancient democracies, and one cause of\r\ntheir ruin, was, that they ruled, as you do, by occasional decrees,\r\n_psephismata_. This practice soon broke in upon the tenor and\r\nconsistency of the laws; it abated the respect of the people towards\r\nthem, and totally destroyed them in the end.\r\n\r\nYour vesting the power of remonstrance, which, in the time of the\r\nmonarchy, existed in the Parliament of Paris, in your principal\r\nexecutive officer, whom, in spite of common sense, you persevere in\r\ncalling king, is the height of absurdity. You ought never to suffer\r\nremonstrance from him who is to execute. This is to understand neither\r\ncouncil nor execution, neither authority nor obedience. The person whom\r\nyou call king ought not to have this power, or he ought to have more.\r\n\r\nYour present arrangement is strictly judicial. Instead of imitating your\r\nmonarchy, and seating your judges on a bench of independence, your\r\nobject is to reduce them to the most blind obedience. As you have\r\nchanged all things, you have invented new principles of order. You first\r\nappoint judges, who, I suppose, are to determine according to law, and\r\nthen you let them know, that, at some time or other, you intend to give\r\nthem some law by which they are to determine. Any studies which they\r\nhave made (if any they have made) are to be useless to them. But to\r\nsupply these studies, they are to be sworn to obey all the rules,\r\norders, and instructions which from time to time they are to receive\r\nfrom the National Assembly. These if they submit to, they leave no\r\nground of law to the subject. They become complete and most dangerous\r\ninstruments in the hands of the governing power, which, in the midst of\r\na cause, or on the prospect of it, may wholly change the rule of\r\ndecision. If these orders of the National Assembly come to be contrary\r\nto the will of the people who locally choose those judges, such\r\nconfusion must happen as is terrible to think of. For the judges owe\r\ntheir place to the local authority, and the commands they are sworn to\r\nobey come from those who have no share in their appointment. In the mean\r\ntime they have the example of the court of _Châtelet_ to encourage and\r\nguide them in the exercise of their functions. That court is to try\r\ncriminals sent to it by the National Assembly, or brought before it by\r\nother courses of delation. They sit under a guard to save their own\r\nlives. They know not by what law they judge, nor under what authority\r\nthey act, nor by what tenure they hold. It is thought that they are\r\nsometimes obliged to condemn at peril of their lives. This is not\r\nperhaps certain, nor can it be ascertained; but when they acquit, we\r\nknow they have seen the persons whom they discharge, with perfect\r\nimpunity to the actors, hanged at the door of their court.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, indeed, promises that they will form a body of law, which\r\nshall be short, simple, clear, and so forth. That is, by their short\r\nlaws, they will leave much to the discretion of the judge, whilst they\r\nhave exploded the authority of all the learning which could make\r\njudicial discretion (a thing perilous at best) deserving the appellation\r\nof a _sound_ discretion.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, that the administrative bodies are carefully\r\nexempted from the jurisdiction of these new tribunals. That is, those\r\npersons are exempted from the power of the laws who ought to be the most\r\nentirely submitted to them. Those who execute public pecuniary trusts\r\nought of all men to be the most strictly held to their duty. One would\r\nhave thought that it must have been among your earliest cares, if you\r\ndid not mean that those administrative bodies should be real, sovereign,\r\nindependent states, to form an awful tribunal, like your late\r\nparliaments, or like our King's Bench, where all corporate officers\r\nmight obtain protection in the legal exercise of their functions, and\r\nwould find coercion, if they trespassed against their legal duty. But\r\nthe cause of the exemption is plain. These administrative bodies are the\r\ngreat instruments of the present leaders in their progress through\r\ndemocracy to oligarchy. They must therefore be put above the law. It\r\nwill be said that the legal tribunals which you have made are unfit to\r\ncoerce them. They are, undoubtedly. They are unfit for any rational\r\npurpose. It will be said, too, that the administrative bodies will be\r\naccountable to the general Assembly. This, I fear, is talking without\r\nmuch consideration of the nature of that Assembly or of these\r\ncorporations. However, to be subject to the pleasure of that Assembly is\r\nnot to be subject to law, either for protection or for constraint.\r\n\r\nThis establishment of judges as yet wants something to its completion.\r\nIt is to be crowned by a new tribunal. This is to be a grand state\r\njudicature; and it is to judge of crimes committed against the nation,\r\nthat is, against the power of the Assembly. It seems as if they had\r\nsomething in their view of the nature of the high court of justice\r\nerected in England during the time of the great usurpation. As they have\r\nnot yet finished this part of the scheme, it is impossible to form a\r\ndirect judgment upon it. However, if great care is not taken to form it\r\nin a spirit very different from that which has guided them in their\r\nproceedings relative to state offences, this tribunal, subservient to\r\ntheir inquisition, _the Committee of Research_, will extinguish the last\r\nsparks of liberty in France, and settle the most dreadful and arbitrary\r\ntyranny ever known in any nation. If they wish to give to this tribunal\r\nany appearance of liberty and justice, they must not evoke from or send\r\nto it the causes relative to their own members, at their pleasure. They\r\nmust also remove the seat of that tribunal out of the republic of\r\nParis.[126]\r\n\r\nHas more wisdom been displayed in the constitution of your army than\r\nwhat is discoverable in your plan of judicature? The able arrangement of\r\nthis part is the more difficult, and requires the greater skill and\r\nattention, not only as a great concern in itself, but as it is the third\r\ncementing principle in the new body of republics which you call the\r\nFrench nation. Truly, it is not easy to divine what that army may become\r\nat last. You have voted a very large one, and on good appointments, at\r\nleast fully equal to your apparent means of payment. But what is the\r\nprinciple of its discipline? or whom is it to obey? You have got the\r\nwolf by the ears, and I wish you joy of the happy position in which you\r\nhave chosen to place yourselves, and in which you are well circumstanced\r\nfor a free deliberation relatively to that army, or to anything else.\r\n\r\nThe minister and secretary of state for the War Department is M. de La\r\nTour du Pin. This gentleman, like his colleagues in administration, is a\r\nmost zealous assertor of the Revolution, and a sanguine admirer of the\r\nnew Constitution which originated in that event. His statement of facts\r\nrelative to the military of France is important, not only from his\r\nofficial and personal authority, but because it displays very clearly\r\nthe actual condition of the army in France, and because it throws light\r\non the principles upon which the Assembly proceeds in the administration\r\nof this critical object. It may enable us to form some judgment how far\r\nit may be expedient in this country to imitate the martial policy of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nM. de La Tour du Pin, on the fourth of last June, comes to give an\r\naccount of the state of his department, as it exists under the auspices\r\nof the National Assembly. No man knows it so well; no man can express it\r\nbetter. Addressing himself to the National Assembly, he says,--\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty has _this day_ sent me to apprise you of the multiplied\r\ndisorders of which _every day_ he receives the most distressing\r\nintelligence. The army [_le corps militaire_] threatens to fall into the\r\nmost turbulent anarchy. Entire regiments have dared to violate at once\r\nthe respect due to the laws, to the king, to the order established by\r\nyour decrees, and to the oaths which they have taken with the most awful\r\nsolemnity. Compelled by my duty to give you information of these\r\nexcesses, my heart bleeds, when I consider who they are that have\r\ncommitted them. Those against whom it is not in my power to withhold the\r\nmost grievous complaints are a part of that very soldiery which to this\r\nday have been so full of honor and loyalty, and with whom for fifty\r\nyears I have lived the comrade and the friend.\r\n\r\n\"What incomprehensible spirit of delirium and delusion has all at once\r\nled them astray? Whilst you are indefatigable in establishing uniformity\r\nin the empire and moulding the whole into one coherent and consistent\r\nbody, whilst the French are taught by you at once the respect which the\r\nlaws owe to the rights of man and that which the citizens owe to the\r\nlaws, the administration of the army presents nothing but disturbance\r\nand confusion. I see in more than one corps the bonds of discipline\r\nrelaxed or broken,--the most unheard-of pretensions avowed directly and\r\nwithout any disguise,--the ordinances without force,--the chiefs without\r\nauthority,--the military chest and the colors carried off,--the\r\nauthority of the king himself [_risum teneatis_] proudly defied,--the\r\nofficers despised, degraded, threatened, driven away, and some of them\r\nprisoners in the midst of their corps, dragging on a precarious life in\r\nthe bosom of disgust and humiliation. To fill up the measure of all\r\nthese horrors, the commandants of places have had their throats out\r\nunder the eyes and almost in the arms of their own soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"These evils are great; but they are not the worst consequences which\r\nmay be produced by such military insurrections. Sooner or later they may\r\nmenace the nation itself. _The nature of things requires_ that the army\r\nshould never act but as _an instrument_. The moment that, erecting\r\nitself into a deliberate body, it shall act according to its own\r\nresolutions, _the government, be it what it may, will immediately\r\ndegenerate into a military democracy_: a species of political monster\r\nwhich has always ended by devouring those who have produced it.\r\n\r\n\"After all this, who must not be alarmed at the irregular consultations\r\nand turbulent committees formed in some regiments by the common soldiers\r\nand non-commissioned officers, without the knowledge, or even in\r\ncontempt of the authority, of their superiors?--although the presence\r\nand concurrence of those superiors could give no authority to such\r\nmonstrous democratic assemblies [_comices_].\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add much to this finished picture,--finished as\r\nfar as its canvas admits, but, as I apprehend, not taking in the whole\r\nof the nature and complexity of the disorders of this military\r\ndemocracy, which, the minister at war truly and wisely observes,\r\nwherever it exists, must be the true constitution of the state, by\r\nwhatever formal appellation it may pass. For, though he informs the\r\nAssembly that the more considerable part of the army have not cast off\r\ntheir obedience, but are still attached to their duty, yet those\r\ntravellers who have seen the corps whose conduct is the best rather\r\nobserve in them the absence of mutiny than the existence of discipline.\r\n\r\nI cannot help pausing here for a moment, to reflect upon the expressions\r\nof surprise which this minister has let fall relative to the excesses he\r\nrelates. To him the departure of the troops from their ancient\r\nprinciples of loyalty and honor seems quite inconceivable. Surely those\r\nto whom he addresses himself know the causes of it but too well. They\r\nknow the doctrines which they have preached, the decrees which they have\r\npassed, the practices which they have countenanced. The soldiers\r\nremember the sixth of October. They recollect the French guards. They\r\nhave not forgot the taking of the king's castles in Paris and at\r\nMarseilles. That the governors in both places were murdered with\r\nimpunity is a fact that has not passed out of their minds. They do not\r\nabandon the principles, laid down so ostentatiously and laboriously, of\r\nthe equality of men. They cannot shut their eyes to the degradation of\r\nthe whole noblesse of France, and the suppression of the very idea of a\r\ngentleman. The total abolition of titles and distinctions is not lost\r\nupon them. But M. du Pin is astonished at their disloyalty, when the\r\ndoctors of the Assembly have taught them at the same time the respect\r\ndue to laws. It is easy to judge which of the two sorts of lessons men\r\nwith arms in their hands are likely to learn. As to the authority of the\r\nking, we may collect from the minister himself (if any argument on that\r\nhead were not quite superfluous) that it is not of more consideration\r\nwith these troops than it is with everybody else. \"The king,\" says he,\r\n\"has over and over again repeated his orders to put a stop to these\r\nexcesses; but in so terrible a crisis, _your_ [the Assembly's]\r\nconcurrence is become indispensably necessary to prevent the evils which\r\nmenace the state. _You_ unite to the force of the legislative power\r\n_that of opinion_, still more important.\" To be sure, the army can have\r\nno opinion of the power or authority of the king. Perhaps the soldier\r\nhas by this time learned, that the Assembly itself does not enjoy a much\r\ngreater degree of liberty than that royal figure.\r\n\r\nIt is now to be seen what has been proposed in this exigency, one of the\r\ngreatest that can happen in a state. The minister requests the Assembly\r\nto array itself in all its terrors, and to call forth all its majesty.\r\nHe desires that the grave and severe principles announced by them may\r\ngive vigor to the king's proclamation. After this we should have looked\r\nfor courts civil and martial, breaking of some corps, decimating of\r\nothers, and all the terrible means which necessity has employed in such\r\ncases to arrest the progress of the most terrible of all evils;\r\nparticularly, one might expect that a serious inquiry would be made into\r\nthe murder of commandants in the view of their soldiers. Not one word of\r\nall this, or of anything like it. After they had been told that the\r\nsoldiery trampled upon the decrees of the Assembly promulgated by the\r\nking, the Assembly pass new decrees, and they authorize the king to make\r\nnew proclamations. After the secretary at war had stated that the\r\nregiments had paid no regard to oaths, _prêtés avec la plus imposante\r\nsolennité_, they propose--what? More oaths. They renew decrees and\r\nproclamations as they experience their insufficiency, and they multiply\r\noaths in proportion as they weaken in the minds of men the sanctions of\r\nreligion. I hope that handy abridgments of the excellent sermons of\r\nVoltaire, D'Alembert, Diderot, and Helvétius, on the Immortality of the\r\nSoul, on a Particular Superintending Providence, and on a Future State\r\nof Rewards and Punishments, are sent down to the soldiers along with\r\ntheir civic oaths. Of this I have no doubt; as I understand that a\r\ncertain description of reading makes no inconsiderable part of their\r\nmilitary exercises, and that they are full as well supplied with the\r\nammunition of pamphlets as of cartridges.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the mischiefs arising from conspiracies, irregular\r\nconsultations, seditious committees, and monstrous democratic assemblies\r\n[_comitia, comices_] of the soldiers, and all the disorders arising from\r\nidleness, luxury, dissipation, and insubordination, I believe the most\r\nastonishing means have been used that ever occurred to men, even in all\r\nthe inventions of this prolific age. It is no less than this:--The king\r\nhas promulgated in circular letters to all the regiments his direct\r\nauthority and encouragement, that the several corps should join\r\nthemselves with the clubs and confederations in the several\r\nmunicipalities, and mix with them in their feasts and civic\r\nentertainments! This jolly discipline, it seems, is to soften the\r\nferocity of their minds, to reconcile them to their bottle companions of\r\nother descriptions, and to merge particular conspiracies in more general\r\nassociations.[127] That this remedy would be pleasing to the soldiers,\r\nas they are described by M. de La Tour du Pin, I can readily\r\nbelieve,--and that, however mutinous otherwise, they will dutifully\r\nsubmit themselves to _these_ royal proclamations. But I should question\r\nwhether all this civic swearing, clubbing, and feasting would dispose\r\nthem, more than at present they are disposed, to an obedience to their\r\nofficers, or teach them better to submit to the austere rules of\r\nmilitary discipline. It will make them admirable citizens after the\r\nFrench mode, but not quite so good soldiers after any mode. A doubt\r\nmight well arise, whether the conversations at these good tables would\r\nfit them a great deal the better for the character of _mere\r\ninstruments_, which this veteran officer and statesman justly observes\r\nthe nature of things always requires an army to be.\r\n\r\nConcerning the likelihood of this improvement in discipline by the free\r\nconversation of the soldiers with the municipal festive societies, which\r\nis thus officially encouraged by royal authority and sanction, we may\r\njudge by the state of the municipalities themselves, furnished to us by\r\nthe war minister in this very speech. He conceives good hopes of the\r\nsuccess of his endeavors towards restoring order _for the present_ from\r\nthe good disposition of certain regiments; but he finds something cloudy\r\nwith regard to the future. As to preventing the return of confusion,\r\n\"for this the administration\" (says he) \"cannot be answerable to you, as\r\nlong as they see the municipalities arrogate to themselves an authority\r\nover the troops which your institutions have reserved wholly to the\r\nmonarch. You have fixed the limits of the military authority and the\r\nmunicipal authority. You have bounded the action which you have\r\npermitted to the latter over the former to the right of requisition; but\r\nnever did the letter or the spirit of your decrees authorize the commons\r\nin these municipalities to break the officers, to try them, to give\r\norders to the soldiers, to drive them from the posts committed to their\r\nguard, to stop them in their marches ordered by the king, or, in a word,\r\nto enslave the troops to the caprice of each of the cities or even\r\nmarket-towns through which they are to pass.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the character and disposition of the municipal society which is\r\nto reclaim the soldiery, to bring them back to the true principles of\r\nmilitary subordination, and to lender them machines in the hands of the\r\nsupreme power of the country! Such are the distempers of the French\r\ntroops! Such is their cure! As the army is, so is the navy. The\r\nmunicipalities supersede the orders of the Assembly, and the seamen in\r\ntheir turn supersede the orders of the municipalities. From my heart I\r\npity the condition of a respectable servant of the public, like this war\r\nminister, obliged in his old age to pledge the Assembly in their civic\r\ncups, and to enter with a hoary head into all the fantastic vagaries of\r\nthese juvenile politicians. Such schemes are not like propositions\r\ncoming from a man of fifty years' wear and tear amongst mankind. They\r\nseem rather such as ought to be expected from those grand compounders in\r\npolitics who shorten the road to their degrees in the state, and have a\r\ncertain inward fanatical assurance and illumination upon all\r\nsubjects,--upon the credit of which, one of their doctors has thought\r\nfit, with great applause, and greater success, to caution the Assembly\r\nnot to attend to old men, or to any persons who value themselves upon\r\ntheir experience. I suppose all the ministers of state must qualify, and\r\ntake this test,--wholly abjuring the errors and heresies of experience\r\nand observation. Every man has his own relish; but I think, if I could\r\nnot attain to the wisdom, I would at least preserve something of the\r\nstiff and peremptory dignity of age. These gentlemen deal in\r\nregeneration: but at any price I should hardly yield my rigid fibres to\r\nbe regenerated by them,--nor begin, in my grand climacteric, to squall\r\nin their new accents, or to stammer, in my second cradle, the elemental\r\nsounds of their barbarous metaphysics.[128] _Si isti mihi largiantur ut\r\nrepuerascam, et in eorum cunis vagiam, valde recusem!_\r\n\r\nThe imbecility of any part of the puerile and pedantic system which they\r\ncall a Constitution cannot be laid open without discovering the utter\r\ninsufficiency and mischief of every other part with which it comes in\r\ncontact, or that bears any the remotest relation to it. You cannot\r\npropose a remedy for the incompetence of the crown, without displaying\r\nthe debility of the Assembly. You cannot deliberate on the confusion of\r\nthe army of the state, without disclosing the worse disorders of the\r\narmed municipalities. The military lays open the civil, and the civil\r\nbetrays the military anarchy. I wish everybody carefully to peruse the\r\neloquent speech (such it is) of Mons. de La Tour du Pin. He attributes\r\nthe salvation of the municipalities to the good behavior of some of the\r\ntroops. These troops are to preserve the well-disposed part of the\r\nmunicipalities, which is confessed to be the weakest, from the pillage\r\nof the worst disposed, which is the strongest. But the municipalities\r\naffect a sovereignty, and will command those troops which are necessary\r\nfor their protection. Indeed, they must command them or court them. The\r\nmunicipalities, by the necessity of their situation, and by the\r\nrepublican powers they have obtained, must, with relation to the\r\nmilitary, be the masters, or the servants, or the confederates, or each\r\nsuccessively, or they must make a jumble of all together, according to\r\ncircumstances. What government is there to coerce the army but the\r\nmunicipality, or the municipality but the army? To preserve concord\r\nwhere authority is extinguished, at the hazard of all consequences, the\r\nAssembly attempts to cure the distempers by the distempers themselves;\r\nand they hope to preserve themselves from a purely military democracy by\r\ngiving it a debauched interest in the municipal.\r\n\r\nIf the soldiers once come to mix for any time in the municipal clubs,\r\ncabals, and confederacies, an elective attraction will draw them to the\r\nlowest and most desperate part. With them will be their habits,\r\naffections, and sympathies. The military conspiracies which are to be\r\nremedied by civic confederacies, the rebellious municipalities which are\r\nto be rendered obedient by furnishing them with the means of seducing\r\nthe very armies of the state that are to keep them in order,--all these\r\nchimeras of a monstrous and portentous policy must aggravate the\r\nconfusion from which they have arisen. There must be blood. The want of\r\ncommon judgment manifested in the construction of all their descriptions\r\nof forces, and in all their kinds of civil and judicial authorities,\r\nwill make it flow. Disorders may be quieted in one time and in one\r\npart. They will break out in others; because the evil is radical and\r\nintrinsic. All these schemes of mixing mutinous soldiers with seditious\r\ncitizens must weaken still more and more the military connection of\r\nsoldiers with their officers, as well as add military and mutinous\r\naudacity to turbulent artificers and peasants. To secure a real army,\r\nthe officer should be first and last in the eye of the soldier,--first\r\nand last in his attention, observance, and esteem. Officers, it seems,\r\nthere are to be, whose chief qualification must be temper and patience.\r\nThey are to manage their troops by electioneering arts. They must bear\r\nthemselves as candidates, not as commanders. But as by such means power\r\nmay be occasionally in their hands, the authority by which they are to\r\nbe nominated becomes of high importance.\r\n\r\nWhat you may do finally does not appear: nor is it of much moment,\r\nwhilst the strange and contradictory relation between your army and all\r\nthe parts of your republic, as well as the puzzled relation of those\r\nparts to each other and to the whole, remain as they are. You seem to\r\nhave given the provisional nomination of the officers, in the first\r\ninstance, to the king, with a reserve of approbation by the National\r\nAssembly. Men who have an interest to pursue are extremely sagacious in\r\ndiscovering the true seat of power. They must soon perceive that those\r\nwho can negative indefinitely in reality appoint. The officers must\r\ntherefore look to their intrigues in the Assembly as the sole certain\r\nroad to promotion. Still, however, by your new Constitution, they must\r\nbegin their solicitation at court. This double negotiation for military\r\nrank seems to me a contrivance, as well adapted as if it were studied\r\nfor no other end, to promote faction in the Assembly itself relative to\r\nthis vast military patronage,--and then to poison the corps of officers\r\nwith factions of a nature still more dangerous to the safety of\r\ngovernment, upon any bottom on which it can be placed, and destructive\r\nin the end to the efficacy of the army itself. Those officers who lose\r\nthe promotions intended for them by the crown must become of a faction\r\nopposite to that of the Assembly which has rejected their claims, and\r\nmust nourish discontents in the heart of the army against the ruling\r\npowers. Those officers, on the other hand, who, by carrying their point\r\nthrough an interest in the Assembly, feel themselves to be at best only\r\nsecond in the good-will of the crown, though first in that of the\r\nAssembly, must slight an authority which would not advance and could not\r\nretard their promotion. If, to avoid these evils, you will have no other\r\nrule for command or promotion than seniority, you will have an army of\r\nformality; at the same time it will become more independent and more of\r\na military republic. Not they, but the king is the machine. A king is\r\nnot to be deposed by halves. If he is not everything in the command of\r\nan army, he is nothing. What is the effect of a power placed nominally\r\nat the head of the army, who to that army is no object of gratitude or\r\nof fear? Such a cipher is not fit for the administration of an object of\r\nall things the most delicate, the supreme command of military men. They\r\nmust be constrained (and their inclinations lead them to what their\r\nnecessities require) by a real, vigorous, effective, decided, personal\r\nauthority. The authority of the Assembly itself suffers by passing\r\nthrough such a debilitating channel as they have chosen. The army will\r\nnot long look to an Assembly acting through the organ of false show and\r\npalpable imposition. They will not seriously yield obedience to a\r\nprisoner. They will either despise a pageant, or they will pity a\r\ncaptive king. This relation of your army to the crown will, if I am not\r\ngreatly mistaken, become a serious dilemma in your politics.\r\n\r\nIt is besides to be considered, whether an Assembly like yours, even\r\nsupposing that it was in possession of another sort of organ, through\r\nwhich its orders were to pass, is fit for promoting the obedience and\r\ndiscipline of an army. It is known that armies have hitherto yielded a\r\nvery precarious and uncertain obedience to any senate or popular\r\nauthority; and they will least of all yield it to an Assembly which is\r\nto have only a continuance of two years. The officers must totally lose\r\nthe characteristic disposition of military men, if they see with perfect\r\nsubmission and due admiration the dominion of pleaders,--especially when\r\nthey find that they have a new court to pay to an endless succession of\r\nthose pleaders, whose military policy, and the genius of whose command,\r\n(if they should have any,) must be as uncertain as their duration is\r\ntransient. In the weakness of one kind of authority, and in the\r\nfluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for some time\r\nmutinous and full of faction, until some popular general, who\r\nunderstands the art of conciliating the soldiery, and who possesses the\r\ntrue spirit of command, shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself.\r\nArmies will obey him on his personal account. There is no other way of\r\nsecuring military obedience in this state of things. But the moment in\r\nwhich that event shall happen, the person who really commands the army\r\nis your master,--the master (that is little) of your king, the master of\r\nyour Assembly, the master of your whole republic.\r\n\r\nHow came the Assembly by their present power over the army? Chiefly, to\r\nbe sure, by debauching the soldiers from their officers. They have begun\r\nby a most terrible operation. They have touched the central point about\r\nwhich the particles that compose armies are at repose. They have\r\ndestroyed the principle of obedience in the great, essential, critical\r\nlink between the officer and the soldier, just where the chain of\r\nmilitary subordination commences, and on which the whole of that system,\r\ndepends. The soldier is told he is a citizen, and has the rights of man\r\nand citizen. The right of a man, he is told, is, to be his own governor,\r\nand to be ruled only by those to whom he delegates that self-government.\r\nIt is very natural he should think that he ought most of all to have his\r\nchoice where he is to yield the greatest degree of obedience. He will\r\ntherefore, in all probability, systematically do what he does at present\r\noccasionally: that is, he will exercise at least a negative in the\r\nchoice of his officers. At present the officers are known at best to be\r\nonly permissive, and on their good behavior. In fact, there have been\r\nmany instances in which they have been cashiered by their corps. Here is\r\na second negative on the choice of the king: a negative as effectual, at\r\nleast, as the other of the Assembly. The soldiers know already that it\r\nhas been a question, not ill received in the National Assembly, whether\r\nthey ought not to have the direct choice of their officers, or some\r\nproportion of them. When such matters are in deliberation, it is no\r\nextravagant supposition that they will incline to the opinion most\r\nfavorable to their pretensions. They will not bear to be deemed the army\r\nof an imprisoned king, whilst another army in the same country, with\r\nwhom too they are to feast and confederate, is to be considered as the\r\nfree army of a free Constitution. They will cast their eyes on the other\r\nand more permanent army: I mean the municipal. That corps, they well\r\nknow, does actually elect its own officers. They may not be able to\r\ndiscern the grounds of distinction on which they are not to elect a\r\nMarquis de La Fayette (or what is his new name?) of their own. If this\r\nelection of a commander-in-chief be a part of the rights of men, why not\r\nof theirs? They see elective justices of peace, elective judges,\r\nelective curates, elective bishops, elective municipalities, and\r\nelective commanders of the Parisian army. Why should they alone be\r\nexcluded? Are the brave troops of France the only men in that nation who\r\nare not the fit judges of military merit, and of the qualifications\r\nnecessary for a commander-in-chief? Are they paid by the state, and do\r\nthey therefore lose the rights of men? They are a part of that nation\r\nthemselves, and contribute to that pay. And is not the king, is not the\r\nNational Assembly, and are not all who elect the National Assembly,\r\nlikewise paid? Instead of seeing all these forfeit their rights by their\r\nreceiving a salary, they perceive that in all these cases a salary is\r\ngiven for the exercise of those rights. All your resolutions, all your\r\nproceedings, all your debates, all the works of your doctors in religion\r\nand politics, have industriously been put into their hands; and you\r\nexpect that they will apply to their own case just as much of your\r\ndoctrines and examples as suits your pleasure.\r\n\r\nEverything depends upon the army in such a government as yours; for you\r\nhave industriously destroyed all the opinions and prejudices, and, as\r\nfar as in you lay, all the instincts which support government. Therefore\r\nthe moment any difference arises between your National Assembly and any\r\npart of the nation, you must have recourse to force. Nothing else is\r\nleft to you,--or rather, you have left nothing else to yourselves. You\r\nsee, by the report of your war minister, that the distribution of the\r\narmy is in a great measure made with a view of internal coercion.[129]\r\nYou must rule by an army; and you have infused into that army by which\r\nyou rule, as well as into the whole body of the nation, principles which\r\nafter a time must disable you in the use you resolve to make of it. The\r\nking is to call out troops to act against his people, when the world has\r\nbeen told, and the assertion is still ringing in our ears, that troops\r\nought not to fire on citizens. The colonies assert to themselves an\r\nindependent constitution and a free trade. They must be constrained by\r\ntroops. In what chapter of your code of the rights of men are they able\r\nto read that it is a part of the rights of men to have their commerce\r\nmonopolized and restrained for the benefit of others? As the colonists\r\nrise on you, the negroes rise on them. Troops again,--massacre, torture,\r\nhanging! These are your rights of men! These are the fruits of\r\nmetaphysic declarations wantonly made and shamefully retracted! It was\r\nbut the other day that the farmers of land in one of your provinces\r\nrefused to pay some sorts of rents to the lord of the soil. In\r\nconsequence of this, you decree that the country-people shall pay all\r\nrents and dues, except those which as grievances you have abolished; and\r\nif they refuse, then you order the king to march troops against them.\r\nYou lay down metaphysic propositions which infer universal consequences,\r\nand then you attempt to limit logic by despotism. The leaders of the\r\npresent system tell them of their rights, as men, to take fortresses, to\r\nmurder guards, to seize on kings without the least appearance of\r\nauthority even from the Assembly, whilst, as the sovereign legislative\r\nbody, that Assembly was sitting in the name of the nation; and yet these\r\nleaders presume to order out the troops which have acted in these very\r\ndisorders, to coerce those who shall judge on the principles and follow\r\nthe examples which have been guarantied by their own approbation.\r\n\r\nThe leaders teach the people to abhor and reject all feodality as the\r\nbarbarism of tyranny; and they tell them afterwards how much of that\r\nbarbarous tyranny they are to bear with patience. As they are prodigal\r\nof light with regard to grievances, so the people find them sparing in\r\nthe extreme with regard to redress. They know that not only certain\r\nquit-rents and personal duties, which you have permitted them to redeem,\r\n(but have furnished no money for the redemption,) are as nothing to\r\nthose burdens for which you have made no provision at all; they know\r\nthat almost the whole system of landed property in its origin is\r\nfeudal,--that it is the distribution of the possessions of the original\r\nproprietors made by a barbarous conqueror to his barbarous\r\ninstruments,--and that the most grievous effects of the conquest axe the\r\nland-rents of every kind, as without question they are.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, in all probability, are the descendants of these ancient\r\nproprietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail, in any degree, in the\r\ntitles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and lawyers,\r\nthey retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that\r\nmen are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought\r\nnot to be monopolized to foster the pride and luxury of any men, who by\r\nnature are no better than themselves, and who, if they do not labor for\r\ntheir bread, are worse. They find, that, by the laws of Nature, the\r\noccupant and subduer of the soil is the true proprietor,--that there is\r\nno prescription against Nature,--and that the agreements (where any\r\nthere are) which have been made with the landlords during the time of\r\nslavery are only the effect of duresse and force,--and that, when the\r\npeople reëntered into the rights of men, those agreements were made as\r\nvoid as everything else which had been settled under the prevalence of\r\nthe old feudal and aristocratic tyranny. They will tell you that they\r\nsee no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade and\r\nan idler in a cowl or in a rochet. If you ground the title to rents on\r\nsuccession and prescription, they tell you from the speech of M. Camus,\r\npublished by the National Assembly for their information, that things\r\nill begun cannot avail themselves of prescription,--that the title of\r\nthose lords was vicious in its origin,--and that force is at least as\r\nbad as fraud. As to the title by succession, they will tell you that the\r\nsuccession of those who have cultivated the soil is the true pedigree of\r\nproperty, and not rotten parchments and silly substitutions,--that the\r\nlords have enjoyed their usurpation too long,--and that, if they allow\r\nto these lay monks any charitable pension, they ought to be thankful to\r\nthe bounty of the true proprietor, who is so generous towards a false\r\nclaimant to his goods.\r\n\r\nWhen the peasants give you back that coin of sophistic reason on which\r\nyou have set your image and superscription, you cry it down as base\r\nmoney, and tell them you will pay for the future with French guards and\r\ndragoons and hussars. You hold up, to chastise them, the second-hand\r\nauthority of a king, who is only the instrument of destroying, without\r\nany power of protecting either the people or his own person. Through\r\nhim, it seems, you will make yourselves obeyed. They answer,--\"You have\r\ntaught us that there are no gentlemen; and which of your principles\r\nteach us to bow to kings whom we have not elected? We know, without your\r\nteaching, that lands were given for the support of feudal dignities,\r\nfeudal titles, and feudal offices. When you took down the cause as a\r\ngrievance, why should the more grievous effect remain? As there are now\r\nno hereditary honors and no distinguished families, why are we taxed to\r\nmaintain what you tell us ought not to exist? You have sent down our old\r\naristocratic landlords in no other character and with no other title but\r\nthat of exactors under your authority. Have you endeavored to make these\r\nyour rent-gatherers respectable to us? No. You have sent them to us with\r\ntheir arms reversed, their shields broken, their impresses defaced,--and\r\nso displumed, degraded, and metamorphosed, such unfeathered two-legged\r\nthings, that we no longer know them. They are strangers to us. They do\r\nnot even go by the names of our ancient lords. Physically they may be\r\nthe same men,--though we are not quite sure of that, on your new\r\nphilosophic doctrines of personal identity. In all other respects they\r\nare totally changed. We do not see why we have not as good a right to\r\nrefuse them their rents as you have to abrogate all their honors,\r\ntitles, and distinctions. This we have never commissioned you to do; and\r\nit is one instance among many, indeed, of your assumption of undelegated\r\npower. We see the burghers of Paris, through their clubs, their mobs,\r\nand their national guards, directing you at their pleasure, and giving\r\nthat as law to you, which, under your authority, is transmitted as law\r\nto us. Through you, these burghers dispose of the lives and fortunes of\r\nus all. Why should not you attend as much to the desires of the\r\nlaborious husbandman with regard to our rent, by which we are affected\r\nin the most serious manner, as you do to the demands of these insolent\r\nburghers relative to distinctions and titles of honor, by which neither\r\nthey nor we are affected at all? But we find you pay more regard to\r\ntheir fancies than to our necessities. Is it among the rights of man to\r\npay tribute to his equals? Before this measure of yours we might have\r\nthought we were not perfectly equal; we might have entertained some old,\r\nhabitual, unmeaning prepossession in favor of those landlords; but we\r\ncannot conceive with what other view than that of destroying all respect\r\nto them you could have made the law that degrades them. You have\r\nforbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of respect;\r\nand now you send troops to sabre and to bayonet us into a submission to\r\nfear and force which you did not suffer us to yield to the mild\r\nauthority of opinion.\"\r\n\r\nThe ground of some of these arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all\r\nrational ears; but to the politicians of metaphysics, who have opened\r\nschools for sophistry, and made establishments for anarchy, it is solid\r\nand conclusive. It is obvious, that, on a mere consideration of the\r\nright, the leaders in the Assembly would not in the least have scrupled\r\nto abrogate the rents along with the titles and family ensigns. It would\r\nbe only to follow up the principle of their reasonings, and to complete\r\nthe analogy of their conduct. But they had newly possessed themselves of\r\na great body of landed property by confiscation. They had this commodity\r\nat market; and the market would have been wholly destroyed, if they were\r\nto permit the husbandmen to riot in the speculations with which they so\r\nfreely intoxicated themselves. The only security which property enjoys\r\nin any one of its descriptions is from the interests of their rapacity\r\nwith regard to some other. They have left nothing but their own\r\narbitrary pleasure to determine what property is to be protected and\r\nwhat subverted.\r\n\r\nNeither have they left any principle by which any of their\r\nmunicipalities can be bound to obedience,--or even conscientiously\r\nobliged not to separate from the whole, to become independent, or to\r\nconnect itself with some other state. The people of Lyons, it seems,\r\nhave refused lately to pay taxes. Why should they not? What lawful\r\nauthority is there left to exact them? The king imposed some of them.\r\nThe old States, methodized by orders, settled the more ancient. They may\r\nsay to the Assembly,--\"Who are you, that are not our kings, nor the\r\nStates we have elected, nor sit on the principles on which we have\r\nelected you? And who are we, that, when we see the _gabelles_ which you\r\nhave ordered to be paid wholly shaken off, when we see the act of\r\ndisobedience afterwards ratified by yourselves, who are we, that we are\r\nnot to judge what taxes we ought or ought not to pay, and are not to\r\navail ourselves of the same powers the validity of which you have\r\napproved in others?\" To this the answer is, \"We will send troops.\" The\r\nlast reason of kings is always the first with your Assembly. This\r\nmilitary aid may serve for a time, whilst the impression of the increase\r\nof pay remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all disputes is\r\nflattered. But this weapon will snap short, unfaithful to the hand that\r\nemploys it. The Assembly keep a school, where, systematically, and with\r\nunremitting perseverance, they teach principles and form regulations\r\ndestructive to all spirit of subordination, civil and military,--and\r\nthen they expect that they shall hold in obedience an anarchic people by\r\nan anarchic army.\r\n\r\nThe municipal army, which, according to their new policy, is to balance\r\nthis national army, if considered in itself only, is of a constitution\r\nmuch more simple, and in every respect less exceptionable. It is a mere\r\ndemocratic body, unconnected with the crown or the kingdom, armed and\r\ntrained and officered at the pleasure of the districts to which the\r\ncorps severally belong; and the personal service of the individuals who\r\ncompose, or the fine in lieu of personal service, are directed by the\r\nsame authority.[130] Nothing is more uniform. If, however, considered in\r\nany relation to the crown, to the National Assembly, to the public\r\ntribunals, or to the other army, or considered in a view to any\r\ncoherence or connection between its parts, it seems a monster, and can\r\nhardly fail to terminate its perplexed movements in some great national\r\ncalamity. It is a worse preservative of a general constitution than the\r\nsystasis of Crete, or the confederation of Poland, or any other\r\nill-devised corrective which has yet been imagined, in the necessities\r\nproduced by an ill-constructed system of government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving concluded my few remarks on the constitution of the supreme\r\npower, the executive, the judicature, the military, and on the\r\nreciprocal relation of all these establishments, I shall say something\r\nof the ability showed by your legislators with regard to the revenue.\r\n\r\nIn their proceedings relative to this object, if possible, still fewer\r\ntraces appear of political judgment or financial resource. When the\r\nStates met, it seemed to be the great object to improve the system of\r\nrevenue, to enlarge its collection, to cleanse it of oppression and\r\nvexation, and to establish it on the most solid footing. Great were the\r\nexpectations entertained on that head throughout Europe. It was by this\r\ngrand arrangement that France was to stand or fall; and this became, in\r\nmy opinion very properly, the test by which the skill and patriotism of\r\nthose who ruled in that Assembly would be tried. The revenue of the\r\nstate is the state. In effect, all depends upon it, whether for support\r\nor for reformation. The dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon\r\nthe quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it. As all\r\ngreat qualities of the mind which operate in public, and are not merely\r\nsuffering and passive, require force for their display, I had almost\r\nsaid for their unequivocal existence, the revenue, which is the spring\r\nof all power, becomes in its administration the sphere of every active\r\nvirtue. Public virtue, being of a nature magnificent and splendid,\r\ninstituted for great things, and conversant about great concerns,\r\nrequires abundant scope and room, and cannot spread and grow under\r\nconfinement, and in circumstances straitened, narrow, and sordid.\r\nThrough the revenue alone the body politic can act in its true genius\r\nand character; and therefore it will display just as much of its\r\ncollective virtue, and as much of that virtue which may characterize\r\nthose who move it, and are, as it were, its life and guiding principle,\r\nas it is possessed of a just revenue. For from hence not only\r\nmagnanimity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and\r\nprovidence, and the tutelary protection of all good arts derive their\r\nfood, and the growth of their organs, but continence, and self-denial,\r\nand labor, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever else there is in\r\nwhich the mind shows itself above the appetite, are nowhere more in\r\ntheir proper element than in the provision and distribution of the\r\npublic wealth. It is therefore not without reason that the science of\r\nspeculative and practical finance, which must take to its aid so many\r\nauxiliary branches of knowledge, stands high in the estimation not only\r\nof the ordinary sort, but of the wisest and best men; and as this\r\nscience has grown with the progress of its object, the prosperity and\r\nimprovement of nations has generally increased with the increase of\r\ntheir revenues; and they will both continue to grow and flourish as long\r\nas the balance between what is left to strengthen the efforts of\r\nindividuals and what is collected for the common efforts of the state\r\nbear to each other a due reciprocal proportion, and are kept in a close\r\ncorrespondence and communication. And perhaps it may be owing to the\r\ngreatness of revenues, and to the urgency of state necessities, that old\r\nabuses in the constitution of finances are discovered, and their true\r\nnature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly understood;\r\ninsomuch that a smaller revenue might have been more distressing in one\r\nperiod than a far greater is found to be in another, the proportionate\r\nwealth even remaining the same. In this state of things, the French\r\nAssembly found something in their revenues to preserve, to secure, and\r\nwisely to administer, as well as to abrogate and alter. Though their\r\nproud assumption might justify the severest tests, yet, in trying their\r\nabilities on their financial proceedings, I would only consider what is\r\nthe plain, obvious duty of a common finance minister, and try them upon\r\nthat, and not upon models of ideal perfection.\r\n\r\nThe objects of a financier are, then, to secure an ample revenue; to\r\nimpose it with judgment and equality; to employ it economically; and\r\nwhen necessity obliges him to make use of credit, to secure its\r\nfoundations in that instance, and forever, by the clearness and candor\r\nof his proceedings, the exactness of his calculations, and the solidity\r\nof his funds. On these heads we may take a short and distinct view of\r\nthe merits and abilities of those in the National Assembly who have\r\ntaken to themselves the management of this arduous concern.\r\n\r\nFar from any increase of revenue in their hands, I find, by a report of\r\nM. Vernier, from the Committee of Finances, of the second of August\r\nlast, that the amount of the national revenue, as compared with its\r\nproduce before the Revolution, was diminished by the sum of two hundred\r\nmillions, or _eight millions sterling_, of the annual\r\nincome,--considerably more than one third of the whole.\r\n\r\nIf this be the result of great ability, never surely was ability\r\ndisplayed in a more distinguished manner or with so powerful an effect.\r\nNo common folly, no vulgar incapacity, no ordinary official negligence,\r\neven no official crime, no corruption, no peculation, hardly any direct\r\nhostility, which we have seen in the modern world, could in so short a\r\ntime have made so complete an overthrow of the finances, and, with them,\r\nof the strength of a great kingdom.--_Cedo quî vestram rempublicam\r\ntantam amisistis tam cito?_\r\n\r\nThe sophisters and declaimers, as soon as the Assembly met, began with\r\ndecrying the ancient constitution of the revenue in many of its most\r\nessential branches, such as the public monopoly of salt. They charged\r\nit, as truly as unwisely, with being ill-contrived, oppressive, and\r\npartial. This representation they were not satisfied to make use of in\r\nspeeches preliminary to some plan of reform; they declared it in a\r\nsolemn resolution or public sentence, as it were judicially passed upon\r\nit; and this they dispersed throughout the nation. At the time they\r\npassed the decree, with the same gravity they ordered the same absurd,\r\noppressive, and partial tax to be paid, until they could find a revenue\r\nto replace it. The consequence was inevitable. The provinces which had\r\nbeen always exempted from this salt monopoly, some of whom were charged\r\nwith other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally disinclined\r\nto bear any part of the burden, which by an equal distribution was to\r\nredeem the others. As to the Assembly, occupied as it was with the\r\ndeclaration and violation of the rights of men, and with their\r\narrangements for general confusion, it had neither leisure nor capacity\r\nto contrive, nor authority to enforce, any plan of any kind relative to\r\nthe replacing the tax, or equalizing it, or compensating the provinces,\r\nor for conducting their minds to any scheme of accommodation with the\r\nother districts which were to be relieved. The people of the salt\r\nprovinces, impatient under taxes damned by the authority which had\r\ndirected their payment, very soon found their patience exhausted. They\r\nthought themselves as skilful in demolishing as the Assembly could be.\r\nThey relieved themselves by throwing off the whole burden. Animated by\r\nthis example, each district, or part of a district, judging of its own\r\ngrievance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own opinion, did\r\nas it pleased with other taxes.\r\n\r\nWe are next to see how they have conducted themselves in contriving\r\nequal impositions, proportioned to the means of the citizens, and the\r\nleast likely to lean heavy on the active capital employed in the\r\ngeneration of that private wealth from whence the public fortune must be\r\nderived. By suffering the several districts, and several of the\r\nindividuals in each district, to judge of what part of the old revenue\r\nthey might withhold, instead of better principles of equality, a new\r\ninequality was introduced of the most oppressive kind. Payments were\r\nregulated by dispositions. The parts of the kingdom which were the most\r\nsubmissive, the most orderly, or the most affectionate to the\r\ncommonwealth, bore the whole burden of the state. Nothing turns out to\r\nbe so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government. To fill up all the\r\ndeficiencies in the old impositions, and the new deficiencies of every\r\nkind which were to be expected, what remained to a state without\r\nauthority? The National Assembly called for a voluntary\r\nbenevolence,--for a fourth part of the income of all the citizens, to be\r\nestimated on the honor of those who were to pay. They obtained something\r\nmore than could be rationally calculated, but what was far indeed from\r\nanswerable to their real necessities, and much less to their fond\r\nexpectations. Rational people could have hoped for little from this\r\ntheir tax in the disguise of a benevolence,--tax weak, ineffective, and\r\nunequal,--a tax by which luxury, avarice, and selfishness were screened,\r\nand the load thrown upon productive capital, upon integrity, generosity,\r\nand public spirit,--a tax of regulation upon virtue. At length the mask\r\nis thrown off, and they are now trying means (with little success) of\r\nexacting their benevolence by force.\r\n\r\nThis benevolence, the rickety offspring of weakness, was to be supported\r\nby another resource, the twin brother of the same prolific imbecility.\r\nThe patriotic donations were to make good the failure of the patriotic\r\ncontribution. John Doe was to become security for Richard Roe. By this\r\nscheme they took things of much price from the giver, comparatively of\r\nsmall value to the receiver; they ruined several trades; they pillaged\r\nthe crown of its ornaments, the churches of their plate, and the people\r\nof their personal decorations. The invention of those juvenile\r\npretenders to liberty was in reality nothing more than a servile\r\nimitation of one of the poorest resources of doting despotism. They took\r\nan old, huge, full-bottomed periwig out of the wardrobe of the\r\nantiquated frippery of Louis the Fourteenth, to cover the premature\r\nbaldness of the National Assembly. They produced this old-fashioned\r\nformal folly, though it had been so abundantly exposed in the Memoirs of\r\nthe Duke de Saint-Simon,--if to reasonable men it had wanted any\r\narguments to display its mischief and insufficiency. A device of the\r\nsame kind was tried in my memory by Louis the Fifteenth, but it answered\r\nat no time. However, the necessities of ruinous wars were some excuse\r\nfor desperate projects. The deliberations of calamity are rarely wise.\r\nBut here was a season for disposition and providence. It was in a time\r\nof profound peace, then enjoyed for five years, and promising a much\r\nlonger continuance, that they had recourse to this desperate trifling.\r\nThey were sure to lose more reputation by sporting, in their serious\r\nsituation, with these toys and playthings of finance, which have filled\r\nhalf their journals, than could possibly be compensated by the poor\r\ntemporary supply which they afforded. It seemed as if those who adopted\r\nsuch projects were wholly ignorant of their circumstances, or wholly\r\nunequal to their necessities. Whatever virtue may be in these devices,\r\nit is obvious that neither the patriotic gifts nor the patriotic\r\ncontribution can ever be resorted to again. The resources of public\r\nfolly are soon exhausted. The whole, indeed, of their scheme of revenue\r\nis to make, by any artifice, an appearance of a full reservoir for the\r\nhour, whilst at the same time they cut off the springs and living\r\nfountains of perennial supply. The account not long since furnished by\r\nM. Necker was meant, without question, to be favorable. He gives a\r\nflattering view of the means of getting through the year; but he\r\nexpresses, as it is natural he should, some apprehension for that which\r\nwas to succeed. On this last prognostic, instead of entering into the\r\ngrounds of this apprehension, in order, by a proper foresight, to\r\nprevent the prognosticated evil, M. Necker receives a sort of friendly\r\nreprimand from the President of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAs to their other schemes of taxation, it is impossible to say anything\r\nof them with certainty, because they have not yet had their operation;\r\nbut nobody is so sanguine as to imagine they will fill up any\r\nperceptible part of the wide gaping breach which their incapacity has\r\nmade in their revenues. At present the state of their treasury sinks\r\nevery day more and more in cash, and swells more and more in fictitious\r\nrepresentation. When so little within or without is now found but paper,\r\nthe representative not of opulence, but of want, the creature not of\r\ncredit, but of power, they imagine that our flourishing state in England\r\nis owing to that bank-paper, and not the bank-paper to the flourishing\r\ncondition of our commerce, to the solidity of our credit, and to the\r\ntotal exclusion of all idea of power from any part of the transaction.\r\nThey forget that in England not one shilling of paper money of any\r\ndescription is received but of choice,--that the whole has had its\r\norigin in cash actually deposited,--and that it is convertible at\r\npleasure, in an instant, and without the smallest loss, into cash again.\r\nOur paper is of value in commerce, because in law it is of none. It is\r\npowerful on 'Change, because in Westminster Hall it is impotent. In\r\npayment of a debt of twenty shillings a creditor may refuse all the\r\npaper of the Bank of England. Nor is there amongst us a single public\r\nsecurity, of any quality or nature whatsoever, that is enforced by\r\nauthority. In fact, it might be easily shown that our paper wealth,\r\ninstead of lessening the real coin, has a tendency to increase\r\nit,--instead of being a substitute for money, it only facilitates its\r\nentry, its exit, and its circulation,--that it is the symbol of\r\nprosperity, and not the badge of distress. Never was a scarcity of cash\r\nand an exuberance of paper a subject of complaint in this nation.\r\n\r\nWell! but a lessening of prodigal expenses, and the economy which has\r\nbeen introduced by the virtuous and sapient Assembly, make amends for\r\nthe losses sustained in the receipt of revenue. In this at least they\r\nhave fulfilled the duty of a financier.--Have those who say so looked at\r\nthe expenses of the National Assembly itself? of the municipalities? of\r\nthe city of Paris? of the increased pay of the two armies? of the new\r\npolice? of the new judicatures? Have they even carefully compared the\r\npresent pension-list with the former? These politicians have been cruel,\r\nnot economical. Comparing the expenses of the former prodigal government\r\nand its relation to the then revenues with the expenses of this new\r\nsystem as opposed to the state of its new treasury, I believe the\r\npresent will be found beyond all comparison more chargeable.[131]\r\n\r\nIt remains only to consider the proofs of financial ability furnished\r\nby the present French managers when they are to raise supplies on\r\ncredit. Here I am a little at a stand; for credit, properly speaking,\r\nthey have none. The credit of the ancient government was not, indeed,\r\nthe best; but they could always, on some terms, command money, not only\r\nat home, but from most of the countries of Europe where a surplus\r\ncapital was accumulated; and the credit of that government was improving\r\ndaily. The establishment of a system of liberty would of course be\r\nsupposed to give it new strength: and so it would actually have done, if\r\na system of liberty had been established. What offers has their\r\ngovernment of pretended liberty had from Holland, from Hamburg, from\r\nSwitzerland, from Genoa, from England, for a dealing in their paper? Why\r\nshould these nations of commerce and economy enter into any pecuniary\r\ndealings with a people who attempt to reverse the very nature of\r\nthings,--amongst whom they see the debtor prescribing at the point of\r\nthe bayonet the medium of his solvency to the creditor, discharging one\r\nof his engagements with another, turning his very penury into his\r\nresource, and paying his interest with his rags?\r\n\r\nTheir fanatical confidence in the omnipotence of Church plunder has\r\ninduced these philosophers to overlook all care of the public estate,\r\njust as the dream of the philosopher's stone induces dupes, under the\r\nmore plausible delusion of the hermetic art, to neglect all rational\r\nmeans of improving their fortunes. With these philosophic financiers,\r\nthis universal medicine made of Church mummy is to cure all the evils of\r\nthe state. These gentlemen perhaps do not believe a great deal in the\r\nmiracles of piety; but it cannot be questioned that they have an\r\nundoubting faith in the prodigies of sacrilege. Is there a debt which\r\npresses them? Issue _assignats_. Are compensations to be made or a\r\nmaintenance decreed to those whom they have robbed of their freehold in\r\ntheir office or expelled from their profession? _Assignats_. Is a fleet\r\nto be fitted out? _Assignats_. If sixteen millions sterling of these\r\n_assignats_ forced on the people leave the wants of the state as urgent\r\nas ever, Issue, says one, thirty millions sterling of _assignats_,--says\r\nanother, Issue fourscore millions more of _assignats_. The only\r\ndifference among their financial factions is on the greater or the\r\nlesser quantity of _assignats_ to be imposed on the public sufferance.\r\nThey are all professors of _assignats_. Even those whose natural good\r\nsense and knowledge of commerce, not obliterated by philosophy, furnish\r\ndecisive arguments against this delusion, conclude their arguments by\r\nproposing the emission of _assignats_. I suppose they must talk of\r\n_assignats_, as no other language would be understood. All experience of\r\ntheir inefficacy does not in the least discourage them. Are the old\r\n_assignats_ depreciated at market? What is the remedy? Issue new\r\n_assignats_.--_Mais si maladia opiniatria non vult se garire, quid illi\r\nfacere? Assignare; postea assignare; ensuita assignare_. The word is a\r\ntrifle altered. The Latin of your present doctors may be better than\r\nthat of your old comedy; their wisdom and the variety of their resources\r\nare the same. They have not more notes in their song than the cuckoo;\r\nthough, far from the softness of that harbinger of summer and plenty,\r\ntheir voice is as harsh and as ominous as that of the raven.\r\n\r\nWho but the most desperate adventurers in philosophy and finance could\r\nat all have thought of destroying the settled revenue of the state, the\r\nsole security for the public credit, in the hope of rebuilding it with\r\nthe materials of confiscated property? If, however, an excessive zeal\r\nfor the state should have led a pious and venerable prelate (by\r\nanticipation a father of the Church[132]) to pillage his own order, and,\r\nfor the good of the Church and people, to take upon himself the place of\r\ngrand financier of confiscation and comptroller-general of sacrilege, he\r\nand his coadjutors were, in my opinion, bound to show, by their\r\nsubsequent conduct, that they knew something of the office they assumed.\r\nWhen they had resolved to appropriate to the _fisc_ a certain portion of\r\nthe landed property of their conquered country, it was their business to\r\nrender their bank a real fund of credit,--as far as such a bank was\r\ncapable of becoming so.\r\n\r\nTo establish a current circulating credit upon any _land-bank_, under\r\nany circumstances whatsoever, has hitherto proved difficult at the very\r\nleast. The attempt has commonly ended in bankruptcy. But when the\r\nAssembly were led, through a contempt of moral, to a defiance of\r\neconomical principles, it might at least have been expected that nothing\r\nwould be omitted on their part to lessen this difficulty, to prevent\r\nany aggravation of this bankruptcy. It might be expected, that, to\r\nrender your land-bank tolerable, every means would be adopted that could\r\ndisplay openness and candor in the statement of the security, everything\r\nwhich could aid the recovery of the demand. To take things in their most\r\nfavorable point of view, your condition was that of a man of a large\r\nlanded estate which he wished to dispose of for the discharge of a debt\r\nand the supply of certain services. Not being able instantly to sell,\r\nyou wished to mortgage. What would a man of fair intentions and a\r\ncommonly clear understanding do in such circumstances? Ought he not\r\nfirst to ascertain the gross value of the estate, the charges of its\r\nmanagement and disposition, the incumbrances perpetual and temporary of\r\nall kinds that affect it,--then, striking a net surplus, to calculate\r\nthe just value of the security? When that surplus (the only security to\r\nthe creditor) had been clearly ascertained, and properly vested in the\r\nhands of trustees, then he would indicate the parcels to be sold, and\r\nthe time and conditions of sale; after this he would admit the public\r\ncreditor, if he chose it, to subscribe his stock into this new fund,--or\r\nhe might receive proposals for an _assignat_ from those who would\r\nadvance money to purchase this species of security. This would be to\r\nproceed like men of business, methodically and rationally, and on the\r\nonly principles of public and private credit that have an existence. The\r\ndealer would then know exactly what he purchased; and the only doubt\r\nwhich could hang upon his mind would be the dread of the resumption of\r\nthe spoil, which one day might be made (perhaps with an addition of\r\npunishment) from the sacrilegious gripe of those execrable wretches who\r\ncould become purchasers at the auction of their innocent\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAn open, and exact statement of the clear value of the property, and of\r\nthe time, the circumstances, and the place of sale, were all necessary,\r\nto efface as much as possible the stigma that has hitherto been branded\r\non every kind of land-bank. It became necessary on another\r\nprinciple,--that is, on account of a pledge of faith previously given on\r\nthat subject, that their future fidelity in a slippery concern might be\r\nestablished by their adherence to their first engagement. When they had\r\nfinally determined on a state resource from Church booty, they came, on\r\nthe fourteenth of April, 1790, to a solemn resolution on the subject,\r\nand pledged themselves to their country, \"that, in the statement of the\r\npublic charges for each year, there should be brought to account a sum\r\nsufficient for defraying the expenses of the R.C.A. religion, the\r\nsupport of the ministers at the altars, the relief of the poor, the\r\npensions to the ecclesiastics, secular as well as regular, of the one\r\nand of the other sex, _in order that the estates and goods which are at\r\nthe disposal of the nation may be disengaged of all charges, and\r\nemployed by the representatives, or the legislative body, to the great\r\nand most pressing exigencies of the state.\"_ They further engaged, on\r\nthe same day, that the sum necessary for the year 1791 should be\r\nforthwith determined.\r\n\r\nIn this resolution they admit it their duty to show distinctly the\r\nexpense of the above objects, which, by other resolutions, they had\r\nbefore engaged should be first in the order of provision. They admit\r\nthat they ought to show the estate clear and disengaged of all charges,\r\nand that they should show it immediately. Have they done this\r\nimmediately, or at any time? Have they ever furnished a rent-roll of the\r\nimmovable estate, or given in an inventory of the movable effects, which\r\nthey confiscate to their assignats? In what manner they can fulfil their\r\nengagements of holding out to public service \"an estate disengaged of\r\nall charges,\" without authenticating the value of the estate or the\r\nquantum of the charges, I leave it to their English admirers to explain.\r\nInstantly upon this assurance, and previously to any one step towards\r\nmaking it good, they issue, on the credit of so handsome a declaration,\r\nsixteen millions sterling of their paper. This was manly. Who, after\r\nthis masterly stroke, can doubt of their abilities in finance?--But\r\nthen, before any other emission of these financial _indulgences_, they\r\ntook care at least to make good their original promise.--If such\r\nestimate, either of the value of the estate or the amount of the\r\nincumbrances, has been made, it has escaped me. I never heard of it.\r\n\r\nAt length they have spoken out, and they have made a full discovery of\r\ntheir abominable fraud in holding out the Church lands as a security for\r\nany debts or any service whatsoever. They rob only to enable them to\r\ncheat; but in a very short time they defeat the ends both of the robbery\r\nand the fraud, by making out accounts for other purposes, which blow up\r\ntheir whole apparatus of force and of deception. I am obliged to M. de\r\nCalonne for his reference to the document which proves this\r\nextraordinary fact: it had by some means escaped me. Indeed, it was not\r\nnecessary to make out my assertion as to the breach of faith on the\r\ndeclaration of the fourteenth of April, 1790. By a report of their\r\ncommittee it now appears that the charge of keeping up the reduced\r\necclesiastical establishments, and other expenses attendant on religion,\r\nand maintaining the religious of both sexes, retained or pensioned, and\r\nthe other concomitant expenses of the same nature, which they have\r\nbrought upon themselves by this convulsion in property, exceeds the\r\nincome of the estates acquired by it in the enormous sum of two millions\r\nsterling annually,--besides a debt of seven millions and upwards. These\r\nare the calculating powers of imposture! This is the finance of\r\nphilosophy! This is the result of all the delusions held out to engage a\r\nmiserable people in rebellion, murder, and sacrilege, and to make them\r\nprompt and zealous instruments in the ruin of their country! Never did a\r\nstate, in any case, enrich itself by the confiscations of the citizens.\r\nThis new experiment has succeeded like all the rest. Every honest mind,\r\nevery true lover of liberty and humanity, must rejoice to find that\r\ninjustice is not always good policy, nor rapine the high-road to riches.\r\nI subjoin with pleasure, in a note, the able and spirited observations\r\nof M. de Calonne on this subject.[133]\r\n\r\nIn order to persuade the world of the bottomless resource of\r\necclesiastical confiscation, the Assembly have proceeded to other\r\nconfiscations of estates in offices, which could not be done with any\r\ncommon color without being compensated out of this grand confiscation of\r\nlanded property. They have thrown upon this fund, which was to show a\r\nsurplus disengaged of all charges, a new charge, namely, the\r\ncompensation to the whole body of the disbanded judicature, and of all\r\nsuppressed offices and estates: a charge which I cannot ascertain, but\r\nwhich unquestionably amounts to many French millions. Another of the new\r\ncharges is an annuity of four hundred and eighty thousand pounds\r\nsterling, to be paid (if they choose to keep faith) by daily payments,\r\nfor the interest of the first assignats. Have they ever given themselves\r\nthe trouble to state fairly the expense of the management of the Church\r\nlands in the hands of the municipalities, to whose care, skill, and\r\ndiligence, and that of their legion of unknown under-agents, they have\r\nchosen to commit the charge of the forfeited estates, and the\r\nconsequence of which had been so ably pointed out by the Bishop of\r\nNancy?\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to dwell on these obvious heads of incumbrance.\r\nHave they made out any clear state of the grand incumbrance of all, I\r\nmean the whole of the general and municipal establishments of all sorts,\r\nand compared it with the regular income by revenue? Every deficiency in\r\nthese becomes a charge on the confiscated estate, before the creditor\r\ncan plant his cabbages on an acre of Church property. There is no other\r\nprop than this confiscation to keep the whole state from tumbling to the\r\nground. In this situation they have purposely covered all, that they\r\nought industriously to have cleared, with a thick fog; and then,\r\nblindfold themselves, like bulls that shut their eyes when they push,\r\nthey drive, by the point of the bayonets, their slaves, blindfolded\r\nindeed no worse than their lords, to take their fictions for currencies,\r\nand to swallow down paper pills by thirty-four millions sterling at a\r\ndose. Then they proudly lay in their claim to a future credit, on\r\nfailure of all their past engagements, and at a time when (if in such a\r\nmatter anything can be clear) it is clear that the surplus estates will\r\nnever answer even the first of their mortgages,--I mean that of the four\r\nhundred millions (or sixteen millions sterling) of assignats. In all\r\nthis procedure I can discern neither the solid sense of plain dealing\r\nnor the subtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. The objections within the\r\nAssembly to pulling up the flood-gates for this inundation of fraud are\r\nunanswered; but they are thoroughly refuted by an hundred thousand\r\nfinanciers in the street. These are the numbers by which the metaphysic\r\narithmeticians compute. These are the grand calculations on which a\r\nphilosophical public credit is founded in France. They cannot raise\r\nsupplies; but they can raise mobs. Let them rejoice in the applauses of\r\nthe club at Dundee for their wisdom and patriotism in having thus\r\napplied the plunder of the citizens to the service of the state. I hear\r\nof no address upon this subject from the directors of the Bank of\r\nEngland,--though their approbation would be of a _little_ more weight in\r\nthe scale of credit than that of the club at Dundee. But to do justice\r\nto the club, I believe the gentlemen who compose it to be wiser than\r\nthey appear,--that they will be less liberal of their money than of\r\ntheir addresses, and that they would not give a dog's ear of their most\r\nrumpled and ragged Scotch paper for twenty of your fairest assignats.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year the Assembly issued paper to the amount of sixteen\r\nmillions sterling. What must have been the state into which the Assembly\r\nhas brought your affairs, that the relief afforded by so vast a supply\r\nhas been hardly perceptible? This paper also felt an almost immediate\r\ndepreciation of five per cent, which in a little time came to about\r\nseven. The effect of these assignats on the receipt of the revenue is\r\nremarkable. M. Necker found that the collectors of the revenue, who\r\nreceived in coin, paid the treasury in assignats. The collectors made\r\nseven per cent by thus receiving in money, and accounting in depreciated\r\npaper. It was not very difficult to foresee that this must be\r\ninevitable. It was, however, not the less embarrassing. M. Necker was\r\nobliged (I believe, for a considerable part, in the market of London) to\r\nbuy gold and silver for the mint, which amounted to about twelve\r\nthousand pounds above the value of the commodity gained. That minister\r\nwas of opinion, that, whatever their secret nutritive virtue might be,\r\nthe state could not live upon assignats alone,--that some real silver\r\nwas necessary, particularly for the satisfaction of those who, having\r\niron in their hands, were not likely to distinguish themselves for\r\npatience, when they should perceive, that, whilst an increase of pay was\r\nheld out to them in real money, it was again to be fraudulently drawn\r\nback by depreciated paper. The minister, in this very natural distress,\r\napplied to the Assembly, that they should order the collectors to pay in\r\nspecie what in specie they had received. It could not escape him, that,\r\nif the Treasury paid three per cent for the use of a currency which\r\nshould be returned seven per cent worse than the minister issued it,\r\nsuch a dealing could not very greatly tend to enrich the public. The\r\nAssembly took no notice of his recommendation. They were in this\r\ndilemma: If they continued to receive the assignats, cash must become an\r\nalien to their Treasury; if the Treasury should refuse those paper\r\n_amulets_, or should discountenance them in any degree, they must\r\ndestroy the credit of their sole resource. They seem, then, to have made\r\ntheir option, and to have given some sort of credit to their paper by\r\ntaking it themselves; at the same time, in their speeches, they made a\r\nsort of swaggering declaration, something, I rather think, above\r\nlegislative competence,--that is, that there is no difference in value\r\nbetween metallic money and their assignats. This was a good, stout,\r\nproof article of faith, pronounced under an anathema by the venerable\r\nfathers of this philosophic synod. _Credat_ who will,--certainly not\r\n_Judæus Apella_.\r\n\r\nA noble indignation rises in the minds of your popular leaders, on\r\nhearing the magic-lantern in their show of finance compared to the\r\nfraudulent exhibitions of Mr. Law. They cannot bear to hear the sands\r\nof his Mississippi compared with the rock of the Church, on which they\r\nbuild their system. Pray let them suppress this glorious spirit, until\r\nthey show to the world what piece of solid ground there is for their\r\nassignats, which they have not preoccupied by other charges. They do\r\ninjustice to that great mother fraud, to compare it with their\r\ndegenerate imitation. It is not true that Law built solely on a\r\nspeculation concerning the Mississippi. He added the East India trade;\r\nhe added the African trade; he added the farms of all the farmed revenue\r\nof France. All these together unquestionably could not support the\r\nstructure which the public enthusiasm, not he, chose to build upon these\r\nbases. But these were, however, in comparison, generous delusions. They\r\nsupposed, and they aimed at, an increase of the commerce of France. They\r\nopened to it the whole range of the two hemispheres. They did not think\r\nof feeding France from its own substance. A grand imagination found in\r\nthis flight of commerce something to captivate. It was wherewithal to\r\ndazzle the eye of an eagle. It was not made to entice the smell of a\r\nmole, nuzzling and burying himself in his mother earth, as yours is. Men\r\nwere not then quite shrunk from their natural dimensions by a degrading\r\nand sordid philosophy, and fitted for low and vulgar deceptions. Above\r\nall, remember, that, in imposing on the imagination, the then managers\r\nof the system made a compliment to the freedom of men. In their fraud\r\nthere was no mixture of force. This was reserved to our time, to quench\r\nthe little glimmerings of reason which might break in upon the solid\r\ndarkness of this enlightened age.\r\n\r\nOn recollection, I have said nothing of a scheme of finance which may be\r\nurged in favor of the abilities of these gentlemen, and which has been\r\nintroduced with great pomp, though not yet finally adopted in the\r\nNational Assembly. It comes with something solid in aid of the credit of\r\nthe paper circulation; and much has been said of its utility and its\r\nelegance. I mean the project for coining into money the bells of the\r\nsuppressed churches. This is their alchemy. There are some follies which\r\nbaffle argument, which go beyond ridicule, and which excite no feeling\r\nin us but disgust; and therefore I say no more upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is as little worth remarking any farther upon all their drawing and\r\nre-drawing, on their circulation for putting off the evil day, on the\r\nplay between the Treasury and the _Caisse d'Escompte_, and on all these\r\nold, exploded contrivances of mercantile fraud, now exalted into policy\r\nof state. The revenue will not be trifled with. The prattling about the\r\nrights of men will not be accepted in payment of a biscuit or a pound of\r\ngunpowder. Here, then, the metaphysicians descend from their airy\r\nspeculations, and faithfully follow examples. What examples? The\r\nexamples of bankrupts. But defeated, baffled, disgraced, when their\r\nbreath, their strength, their inventions, their fancies desert them,\r\ntheir confidence still maintains its ground. In the manifest failure of\r\ntheir abilities, they take credit for their benevolence. When the\r\nrevenue disappears in their hands, they have the presumption, in some of\r\ntheir late proceedings, to value _themselves_ on the relief given to the\r\npeople. They did not relieve the people. If they entertained such\r\nintentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? The\r\npeople relieved themselves, in spite of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut waiving all discussion on the parties who may claim the merit of\r\nthis fallacious relief, has there been, in effect, any relief to the\r\npeople in any form? M. Bailly, one of the grand agents of paper\r\ncirculation, lets you into the nature of this relief. His speech to the\r\nNational Assembly contained a high and labored panegyric on the\r\ninhabitants of Paris, for the constancy and unbroken resolution with\r\nwhich they have borne their distress and misery. A fine picture of\r\npublic felicity! What! great courage and unconquerable firmness of mind\r\nto endure benefits and sustain redress? One would think, from the speech\r\nof this learned lord mayor, that the Parisians, for this twelvemonth\r\npast, had been suffering the straits of some dreadful blockade,--that\r\nHenry the Fourth had been stopping up the avenues to their supply, and\r\nSully thundering with his ordnance at the gates of Paris,--when in\r\nreality they are besieged by no other enemies than their own madness and\r\nfolly, their own credulity and perverseness. But M. Bailly will sooner\r\nthaw the eternal ice of his Atlantic regions than restore the central\r\nheat to Paris, whilst it remains \"smitten with the cold, dry, petrific\r\nmace\" of a false and unfeeling philosophy. Some time after this speech,\r\nthat is, on the thirteenth of last August, the same magistrate, giving\r\nan account of his government at the bar of the same Assembly, expresses\r\nhimself as follows:--\"In the month of July, 1789,\" (the period of\r\neverlasting commemoration,) \"the finances of the city of Paris were\r\n_yet_ in good order; the expenditure was counterbalanced by the receipt,\r\nand she had at that time a million [forty thousand pounds sterling] in\r\nbank. The expenses which she has been constrained to incur, _subsequent\r\nto the Revolution_, amount to 2,500,000 livres. From these expenses, and\r\nthe great falling off in the product of the _free gifts_, not only a\r\nmomentary, but a _total_, want of money has taken place.\" This is the\r\nParis upon whose nourishment, in the course of the last year, such\r\nimmense sums, drawn from the vitals of all France, have been expended.\r\nAs long as Paris stands in the place of ancient Rome, so long she will\r\nbe maintained by the subject provinces. It is an evil inevitably\r\nattendant on the dominion of sovereign democratic republics. As it\r\nhappened in Rome, it may survive that republican domination which gave\r\nrise to it. In that case despotism itself must submit to the vices of\r\npopularity. Rome, under her emperors, united the evils of both systems;\r\nand this unnatural combination was one great cause of her ruin.\r\n\r\nTo tell the people that they are relieved by the dilapidation of their\r\npublic estate is a cruel and insolent imposition. Statesmen, before they\r\nvalued themselves on the relief given to the people by the destruction\r\nof their revenue, ought first to have carefully attended to the solution\r\nof this problem:--Whether it be more advantageous to the people to pay\r\nconsiderably and to gain in proportion, or to gain little or nothing and\r\nto be disburdened of all contribution? My mind is made up to decide in\r\nfavor of the first proposition. Experience is with me, and, I believe,\r\nthe best opinions also. To keep a balance between the power of\r\nacquisition on the part of the subject and the demands he is to answer\r\non the part of the state is the fundamental part of the skill of a true\r\npolitician. The means of acquisition are prior in time and in\r\narrangement. Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be\r\nenabled to acquire, the people, without being servile, must be tractable\r\nand obedient. The magistrate must have his reverence, the laws their\r\nauthority. The body of the people must not find the principles of\r\nnatural subordination by art rooted out of their minds. They must\r\nrespect that property of which they cannot partake. They must labor to\r\nobtain what by labor can be obtained; and when they find, as they\r\ncommonly do, the success disproportioned to the endeavor, they must be\r\ntaught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal justice. Of\r\nthis consolation whoever deprives them deadens their industry, and\r\nstrikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation. He that\r\ndoes this is the cruel oppressor, the merciless enemy of the poor and\r\nwretched; at the same time that by his wicked speculations he exposes\r\nthe fruits of successful industry and the accumulations of fortune to\r\nthe plunder of the negligent, the disappointed, and the unprosperous.\r\n\r\nToo many of the financiers by profession are apt to see nothing in\r\nrevenue but banks, and circulations, and annuities on lives, and\r\ntontines, and perpetual rents, and all the small wares of the shop. In a\r\nsettled order of the state, these things are not to be slighted, nor is\r\nthe skill in them to be held of trivial estimation. They are good, but\r\nthen only good when they assume the effects of that settled order, and\r\nare built upon it. But when men think that these beggarly contrivances\r\nmay supply a resource for the evils which result from breaking up the\r\nfoundations of public order, and from causing or suffering the\r\nprinciples of property to be subverted, they will, in the ruin of their\r\ncountry, leave a melancholy and lasting monument of the effect of\r\npreposterous politics, and presumptuous, short-sighted, narrow-minded\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the incapacity shown by the popular leaders in all the\r\ngreat members of the commonwealth are to be covered with the\r\n\"all-atoning name\" of Liberty. In some people I see great liberty,\r\nindeed; in many, if not in the most, an oppressive, degrading servitude.\r\nBut what is liberty without wisdom and without virtue? It is the\r\ngreatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness,\r\nwithout tuition or restraint. Those who know what virtuous liberty is\r\ncannot bear to see it disgraced by incapable heads, on account of their\r\nhaving high-sounding words in their mouths. Grand, swelling sentiments\r\nof liberty I am sure I do not despise. They warm the heart; they enlarge\r\nand liberalize our minds; they animate our courage in a time of\r\nconflict. Old as I am, I read the fine raptures of Lucan and Corneille\r\nwith pleasure. Neither do I wholly condemn the little arts and devices\r\nof popularity. They facilitate the carrying of many points of moment;\r\nthey keep the people together; they refresh the mind in its exertions;\r\nand they diffuse occasional gayety over the severe brow of moral\r\nfreedom. Every politician ought to sacrifice to the Graces, and to join\r\ncompliance with reason. But in such an undertaking as that in France all\r\nthese subsidiary sentiments and artifices are of little avail. To make a\r\ngovernment requires no great prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach\r\nobedience, and the work is done. To give freedom is still more easy. It\r\nis not necessary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. But to\r\nform a _free government_, that is, to temper together these opposite\r\nelements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work, requires much\r\nthought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind.\r\nThis I do not find in those who take the lead in the National Assembly.\r\nPerhaps they are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather\r\nbelieve it. It would put them below the common level of human\r\nunderstanding. But when the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at\r\nan auction of popularity, their talents, in the construction of the\r\nstate, will be of no service. They will become flatterers instead of\r\nlegislators,--the instruments, not the guides of the people. If any of\r\nthem should happen to propose a scheme of liberty soberly limited, and\r\ndefined with proper qualifications, he will be immediately outbid by his\r\ncompetitors, who will produce something more splendidly popular.\r\nSuspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause. Moderation will\r\nbe stigmatized as the virtue of cowards, and compromise as the prudence\r\nof traitors,--until, in hopes of preserving the credit which may enable\r\nhim to temper and moderate on some occasions, the popular leader is\r\nobliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing\r\npowers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose at which he\r\nultimately might have aimed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all that deserves\r\ncommendation in the indefatigable labors of this Assembly? I do not\r\ndeny, that, among an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some\r\ngood may have been done. They who destroy everything certainly will\r\nremove some grievance. They who make everything new have a chance that\r\nthey may establish something beneficial. To give them credit for what\r\nthey have done in virtue of the authority they have usurped, or to\r\nexcuse them in the crimes by which that authority has been acquired, it\r\nmust appear that the same things could not have been accomplished\r\nwithout producing such a revolution. Most assuredly they might; because\r\nalmost every one of the regulations made by them, which is not very\r\nequivocal, was either in the cession of the king, voluntarily made at\r\nthe meeting of the States, or in the concurrent instructions to the\r\norders. Some usages have been abolished on just grounds; but they were\r\nsuch, that, if they had stood as they were to all eternity, they would\r\nlittle detract from the happiness and prosperity of any state. The\r\nimprovements of the National Assembly are superficial, their errors\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\nWhatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather to recommend to our\r\nneighbors the example of the British Constitution than to take models\r\nfrom them for the improvement of our own. In the former they have got an\r\ninvaluable treasure. They are not, I think, without some causes of\r\napprehension and complaint; but these they do not owe to their\r\nConstitution, but to their own conduct. I think our happy situation\r\nowing to our Constitution,--but owing to the whole of it, and not to any\r\npart singly,--owing in a great measure to what we have left standing in\r\nour several reviews and reformations, as well as to what we have altered\r\nor superadded. Our people will find employment enough for a truly\r\npatriotic, free, and independent spirit, in guarding what they possess\r\nfrom violation. I would not exclude alteration neither; but even when I\r\nchanged, it should be to preserve. I should be led to my remedy by a\r\ngreat grievance. In what I did, I should follow the example of our\r\nancestors. I would make the reparation as nearly as possible in the\r\nstyle of the building. A politic caution, a guarded circumspection, a\r\nmoral rather than a complexional timidity, were among the ruling\r\nprinciples of our forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being\r\nilluminated with the light of which the gentlemen of France tell us they\r\nhave got so abundant a share, they acted under a strong impression of\r\nthe ignorance and fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus\r\nfallible rewarded them for having in their conduct attended to their\r\nnature. Let us imitate their caution, if we wish to deserve their\r\nfortune or to retain their bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let\r\nus preserve what they have left; and standing on the firm ground of the\r\nBritish Constitution, let us be satisfied to admire, rather than attempt\r\nto follow in their desperate flights, the aëronauts of France.\r\n\r\nI have told you candidly my sentiments. I think they are not likely to\r\nalter yours. I do not know that they ought. You are young; you cannot\r\nguide, but must follow, the fortune of your country. But hereafter they\r\nmay be of some use to you, in some future form which your commonwealth\r\nmay take. In the present it can hardly remain; but before its final\r\nsettlement, it may be obliged to pass, as one of our poets says,\r\n\"through great varieties of untried being,\" and in all its\r\ntransmigrations to be purified by fire and blood.\r\n\r\nI have little to recommend my opinions but long observation and much\r\nimpartiality. They come from one who has been no tool of power, no\r\nflatterer of greatness, and who in his last acts does not wish to belie\r\nthe tenor of his life. They come from one almost the whole of whose\r\npublic exertion has been a struggle for the liberty of others,--from one\r\nin whose breast no anger durable or vehement has ever been kindled but\r\nby what he considered as tyranny, and who snatches from his share in the\r\nendeavors which are used by good men to discredit opulent oppression the\r\nhours he has employed on your affairs, and who in so doing persuades\r\nhimself he has not departed from his usual office. They come from one\r\nwho desires honors, distinctions, and emoluments but little, and who\r\nexpects them not at all,--who has no contempt for fame, and no fear of\r\nobloquy,--who shuns contention, though he will hazard an opinion; from\r\none who wishes to preserve consistency, but who would preserve\r\nconsistency by varying his means to secure the unity of his end,--and,\r\nwhen the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails may be endangered by\r\noverloading it upon one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight\r\nof his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[77] Ps. cxlix.\r\n\r\n[78] Discourse on the Love of our Country, Nov. 4, 1789, by Dr. Richard\r\nPrice, 3d edition, p. 17 and 18.\r\n\r\n[79] \"Those who dislike that mode of worship which is prescribed by\r\npublic authority ought, if they can find _no_ worship _out_ of the\r\nChurch which they approve, _to set up a separate worship for\r\nthemselves_; and by doing this, and giving an example of a rational and\r\nmanly worship, men of _weight_ from their _rank_ and literature may do\r\nthe greatest service to society and the world.\"--P. 18, Dr. Price's\r\nSermon.\r\n\r\n[80] P. 34, Discourse on the Love of our Country, by Dr. Price.\r\n\r\n[81] 1st Mary, sess. 3, ch. 1.\r\n\r\n[82] \"That King James the Second, having endeavored _to subvert the\r\nConstitution_ of the kingdom, by breaking the _original contract_\r\nbetween king and people, and, by the advice of Jesuits and other wicked\r\npersons, having violated the _fundamental_ laws, and _having withdrawn\r\nhimself out of the kingdom_, hath _abdicated_ the government, and the\r\nthrone is thereby _vacant_.\"\r\n\r\n[83] P. 23, 23, 24.\r\n\r\n[84] See Blackstone's Magna Charta, printed at Oxford, 1759.\r\n\r\n[85] 1 W. and M.\r\n\r\n[86] Ecclesiasticus, chap, xxxviii. ver. 24, 25. \"The wisdom of a\r\nlearned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little\r\nbusiness shall become wise.

He was obliged to secede from the\r\nAssembly; and he afterwards became a voluntary exile, on account of the\r\nhorrors of this pious triumph, and the dispositions of men, who,\r\nprofiting of crimes, if not causing them, have taken the lead in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n_Extract of M. de Lally Tollendal's Second Letter to a Friend_.\r\n\r\n\"Parlons du parti que j'ai pris; il est bien justifé dans ma\r\nconscience.--Ni cette ville coupable, ni cette assemblée plus coupable\r\nencore, ne méritoient que je me justifie; mais j'ai à cœur que vous, et\r\nles personnes qui pensent comme vous, ne me condamnent pas.--Ma santé,\r\nje vous jure, me rendoit mes fonctions impossibles; mais même en les\r\nmettant de côté il a été au-dessus de mes forces de supporter plus\r\nlongtems l'horreur que me causoit ce sang,--ces têtes,--cette reine\r\n_presque egorgée_,--ce roi, amené _esclave_, entrant à Paris au milieu\r\nde ses assassins, et précédé des têtes de ses malheureux gardes,--ces\r\nperfides janissaires, ces assassins, ces femmes cannibales,--ce cri de\r\nTOUS LES ÉVÊQUES À LA LANTERNE, dans le moment où le roi entre sa\r\ncapitale avec deux évêques de son conseil dans sa voiture,--un _coup de\r\nfusil_, que j'ai vu tirer dans un _des carrosses de la reine_,--M.\r\nBailly appellant cela _un beau jour_,--l'assemblée ayant déclaré\r\nfroidement le matin, qu'il n'étoit pas de sa dignité d'aller toute\r\nentière environner le roi,--M.

Aucune idée de crainte ne\r\ns'est approchée de moi. Je rougirois de m'en défendre. J'avois encore\r\nreçû sur la route de la part de ce peuple, moins coupable que ceux qui\r\nl'ont enivré de fureur, des acclamations, et des applaudissements, dont\r\nd'autres auroient été flattés, et qui m'ont fait frémir. C'est à\r\nl'indignation, c'est à l'horreur, c'est aux convulsions physiques, que\r\nle seul aspect du sang me fait éprouver que j'ai cédé. On brave une\r\nseule mort; on la brave plusieurs fois, quand elle peut être utile. Mais\r\naucune puissance sous le ciel, mais aucune opinion publique ou privée\r\nn'ont le droit de me condamner à souffrir inutilement mille supplices\r\npar minute, et à périr de désespoir, de rage, au milieu des _triomphes_,\r\ndu crime que je n'ai pu arrêter. Ils me proscriront, ils confisqueront\r\nmes biens. Je labourerai la terre, et je ne les verrai plus. Voilà ma\r\njustification. Vous pourrez la lire, la montrer, la laisser copier; tant\r\npis pour ceux qui ne la comprendront pas; ce ne sera alors moi qui\r\nauroit eu tort de la leur donner.\"\r\n\r\nThis military man had not so good nerves as the peaceable gentlemen of\r\nthe Old Jewry.--See Mons. Mounier's narrative of these transactions: a\r\nman also of honor and virtue and talents, and therefore a fugitive.\r\n\r\n[A] N.B.M. Mounier was then speaker of the National Assembly. He has\r\nsince been obliged to live in exile, though one of the firmest assertors\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\n[93] See the fate of Bailly and Condorcet, supposed to be here\r\nparticularly alluded to. Compare the circumstances of the trial and\r\nexecution of the former with this prediction.\r\n\r\n[94] The English are, I conceive, misrepresented in a letter published\r\nin one of the papers, by a gentleman thought to be a Dissenting\r\nminister. When writing to Dr. Price of the spirit which prevails at\r\nParis, he says,--\"The spirit of the people in this place has abolished\r\nall the proud _distinctions_ which the _king_ and _nobles_ had usurped\r\nin their minds: whether they talk of _the king, the noble, or the\r\npriest_, their whole language is that of the most _enlightened and\r\nliberal amongst the English_.\" If this gentleman means to confine the\r\nterms _enlightened and liberal_ to one set of men in England, it may be\r\ntrue. It is not generally so.\r\n\r\n[95] Sit igitur hoc ab initio persuasum civibus, dominos esse omnium\r\nrerum ac moderatores deos; eaque, quæ gerantur, eorum geri vi, ditione,\r\nac numine; eosdemque optime de genere hominum mereri; et qualis quisque\r\nsit, quid agat, quid in se admittat, qua mente, qua pietate colat\r\nreligiones intueri: piorum et impiorum habere rationem. His enim rebus\r\nimbutæ mentes haud sane abhorrebunt ab utili et a vera sententia.--Cic.\r\nde Legibus, l. 2.\r\n\r\n[96] Quicquid multis peccatur inultum.\r\n\r\n[97] This (down to the end of the first sentence in the next paragraph)\r\nand some other parts, here and there, were inserted, on his reading the\r\nmanuscript, by my lost son.\r\n\r\n[98] I do not choose to shock the feeling of the moral reader with any\r\nquotation of their vulgar, base, and profane language.\r\n\r\n[99] Their connection with Turgot and almost all the people of the\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\n[100] All have been confiscated in their turn.\r\n\r\n[101] Not his brother, nor any near relation; but this mistake does not\r\naffect the argument.\r\n\r\n[102] The rest of the passage is this:--\r\n\r\n    \"Who, having spent the treasures of his crown,\r\n    Condemns their luxury to feed his own.\r\n    And yet this act, to varnish o'er the shame\r\n    Of sacrilege, must bear Devotion's name.\r\n    No crime so bold, but would be understood\r\n    A Real, or at least a seeming good.\r\n    Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the name,\r\n    And free from conscience, is a slave to fame.\r\n    Thus he the Church at once protects and spoils:\r\n    But princes' swords are sharper than their styles.\r\n    And thus to th' ages past he makes amends,\r\n    Their charity destroys, their faith defends.\r\n    Then did Religion in a lazy cell,\r\n    In empty, airy contemplations, dwell;\r\n    And like the block, unmovèd lay: but ours,\r\n    As much too active, like the stork devours.\r\n    Is there no temperate region can be known\r\n    Betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone?\r\n    Could we not wake from that lethargic dream,\r\n    But to be restless in a worse extreme?\r\n    And for that lethargy was there no care,\r\n    But to be cast into a calenture?\r\n    Can knowledge have no bound, but must advance\r\n    So far, to make us wish for ignorance,\r\n    And rather in the dark to grope our way,\r\n    Than, led by a false guide, to err by day?\r\n    Who sees these dismal heaps, but would demand\r\n    What barbarous invader sack'd the land?\r\n    But when he hears no Goth, no Turk did bring\r\n    This desolation, but a Christian king,\r\n    When nothing but the name of zeal appears\r\n    'Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs,\r\n    What does he think our sacrilege would spare,\r\n    When such th' effects of our devotions are?\"\r\n\r\n                          _Cooper's Hill_, by Sir JOHN DENHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[103] Rapport de Mons. le Directeur-Général des Finances, fait par Ordre\r\ndu Roi à Versailles. Mai 5, 1789.\r\n\r\n[104] In the Constitution of Scotland, during the Stuart reigns, a\r\ncommittee sat for preparing bills; and none could pass, but those\r\npreviously approved by them. This committee was called Lords of\r\nArticles.\r\n\r\n[105] When I wrote this I quoted from memory, after many years had\r\nelapsed from my reading the passage. A learned friend has found it and\r\nit is as follows:--\r\n\r\nτὸ ἠ̂θος τὸ αὐτό, καὶ ἄμφω δεσποτικὰ τω̂ν βελτιόνων, καὶ τὰ\r\nψηφίσματα ὥσπερ ἐκει̂ τὰ ἐπιτάγματα, καὶ ὁ δημαγωγὸς καὶ ὁ\r\nκόλαξ οἱ αὐτοὶ καὶ ἀνάλογον. καὶ μάλιστα δ' ἑκάτεροι παρ'\r\nἑκατέροις ἰσχύουσιν, οἱ μὲν κόλακες παρὰ τοι̂ς τυράννοις, οἱ\r\nδὲ δημαγωγοὶ παρὰ τοι̂ς δήμοις τοι̂ς τοιούτοις.\r\n\r\n\"The ethical character is the same: both exercise despotism over the\r\nbetter class of citizens; and decrees are in the one what ordinances and\r\narrêts are in the other: the demagogue, too, and the court favorite, are\r\nnot unfrequently the same identical men, and always bear a close\r\nanalogy; and these have the principal power, each in their respective\r\nforms of government, favorites with the absolute monarch, and demagogues\r\nwith a people such as I have described.\"--Arist. Politic. lib. iv. cap.\r\n4.\r\n\r\n[106] De l'Administration des Finances de la France, par Mons. Necker,\r\nVol. I. p. 288.\r\n\r\n[107] De l'Administration des Finances de la France, par M. Necker.\r\n\r\n[108] Vol. III. chap. 8 and chap. 9.\r\n\r\n[109] The world is obliged to M. de Calonne for the pains he has taken\r\nto refute the scandalous exaggerations relative to some of the royal\r\nexpenses, and to detect the fallacious account given of pensions, for\r\nthe wicked purpose of provoking the populace to all sorts of crimes.\r\n\r\n[110] See Gulliver's Travels for the idea of countries governed by\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n[111] M. de Calonne states the falling off of the population of Paris as\r\nfar more considerable; and it may be so, since the period of M. Necker's\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n[112]\r\n\r\nTravaux de charité pour subvenir\r\n  au manque de travail à              Livres.         £    s. d.\r\n  Paris et dans les provinces        3,866,920     161,121 13 4\r\nDestruction de vagabondage et de la\r\n  mendicité                          1,671,417      69,642  7 6\r\nPrimes pour l'importation de grains  5,671,907     235,329  9 2\r\nDépenses relatives aux subsistances,\r\n  déduction fait des reconvrements\r\n  qui out en lieu                   39,871,790   1,661,324 11 8\r\n                                    -----------------------------\r\n          Total                     51,082,034   2,128,418  1 8\r\n\r\nWhen I sent this book to the press, I entertained some doubt concerning\r\nthe nature and extent of the last article in the above accounts, which\r\nis only under a general head, without any detail. Since then I have seen\r\nM. de Calonne's work. I must think it a great loss to me that I had not\r\nthat advantage earlier. M. de Calonne thinks this article to be on\r\naccount of general subsistence; but as he is not able to comprehend how\r\nso great a loss as upwards of 1,661,000_l._ sterling could be sustained\r\non the difference between the price and the sale of grain, he seems to\r\nattribute this enormous head of charge to secret expenses of the\r\nRevolution. I cannot say anything positively on that subject. The reader\r\nis capable of judging, by the aggregate of these immense charges, on the\r\nstate and condition of France, and the system of public economy adopted\r\nin that nation. These articles of account produced no inquiry or\r\ndiscussion in the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n[113] This is on a supposition of the truth of this story; but he was\r\nnot in France at the time. One name serves as well as another.\r\n\r\n[114] Domat.\r\n\r\n[115] Speech of M. Camus, published by order of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n[116] Whether the following description is strictly true I know not; but\r\nit is what the publishers would have pass for true, in order to animate\r\nothers. In a letter from Toul, given in one of their papers, is the\r\nfollowing passage concerning the people of that district:--\"Dans la\r\nRévolution actuelle, ils ont résisté à toutes les _séductions du\r\nbigotisme, aux persécutions et aux tracasseries_ des ennemis de la\r\nRévolution. _Oubliant leurs plus grands intérêts_ pour rendre hommage\r\naux vues d'ordre général qui out déterminé l'Assemblée Nationale, ils\r\nvoient, _sans se plaindre_, supprimer cette foule d'établissemens\r\necclésiastiques par lesquels _ils subsistoient_; et même, en perdant\r\nleur siège épiscopal, la seule de toutes ces ressources qui pouvoit, on\r\nplutôt _qui devoit, en toute équité_, leur être conservée, condamnés _à\r\nla plus effrayante misère_ sans avoir _été ni pu être entendus, ils ne\r\nmurmurent point_, ils restent fidèles aux principes du plus pur\r\npatriotisme; ils sont encore prêts à _verser leur sang_ pour le maintien\r\nde la constitution, qui va réduire leur ville _à la plus déplorable\r\nnullité_.\"--These people are not supposed to have endured those\r\nsufferings and injustices in a struggle for liberty, for the same\r\naccount states truly that they have been always free; their patience in\r\nbeggary and ruin, and their suffering, without remonstrance, the most\r\nflagrant and confessed injustice, if strictly true, can be nothing but\r\nthe effect of this dire fanaticism. A great multitude all over France is\r\nin the same condition and the same temper.\r\n\r\n[117] See the proceedings of the confederation at Nantes.\r\n\r\n[118] \"Si plures sunt ii quibus improbe datum est, quam illi quibus\r\ninjuste ademptum est, idcirco plus etiam valent? Non enim numero hæc\r\njudicantur, sed pondere. Quam autem habet æquitatem, ut agrum multis\r\nannis, aut etiam sæculis ante possessum, qui nullum habuit habeat, qui\r\nautem habuit amittat? Ac, propter hoc injuriæ genus, Lacedæmonii\r\nLysandrum Ephorum expulerunt; Agin regem (quod nunquam antea apud eos\r\nacciderat) necaverunt; exque eo tempore tantæ discordiæ secutæ sunt, ut\r\net tyranni exsisterent, et optimates exterminarentur, et preclarissime\r\nconstituta respublica dilaberetur. Nec vero solum ipsa cecidit, sed\r\netiam reliquam Græciam evertit contagionibus malorum, quæ a Lacedæmoniis\r\nprofectæ manarunt latius.\"--After speaking of the conduct of the model\r\nof true patriots, Aratus of Sicyon, which was in a very different\r\nspirit, he says,--\"Sic par est agere cum civibus; non (ut bis jam\r\nvidimus) hastam in foro ponere et bona civium voci subjicere præconis.\r\nAt ille Græcus (id quod fuit sapientis et præstantis viri) omnibus\r\nconsulendum esse putavit: eaque est summa ratio et sapientia boni civis,\r\ncommoda civium non divellere, sed omnes eadem æquitate continere.\"--Cic.\r\nOff. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n[119] See two books entitled, \"Einige Originalschriften des\r\nIlluminatenordens,\"--\"System und Folgen des Illuminatenordens.\" München,\r\n1787.\r\n\r\n[120] A leading member of the Assembly, M. Rabaut de St. Étienne, has\r\nexpressed the principle of all their proceedings as clearly as possible;\r\nnothing can be more simple:--\"_Tous les établissemens en France\r\ncouronnent le malheur du peuple: pour le rendre heureux, il faut le\r\nrenouveler, changer ses idées, changer ses loix, changer ses mœurs, ...\r\nchanger les hommes, changer les choses, changer ses mots, ... tout\r\ndétruire; oui, tout détruire; puisque tout est à récréer_.\"--This\r\ngentleman was chosen president in an assembly not sitting at\r\n_Quinze-Vingt_ or the _Petites Maisons_, and composed of persons giving\r\nthemselves out to be rational beings; but neither his ideas, language,\r\nor conduct differ in the smallest degree from the discourses, opinions,\r\nand actions of those, within and without the Assembly, who direct the\r\noperations of the machine now at work in France.\r\n\r\n[121] The Assembly, in executing the plan of their committee, made some\r\nalterations. They have struck out one stage in these gradations; this\r\nremoves a part of the objection; but the main objection, namely, that in\r\ntheir scheme the first constituent voter has no connection with the\r\nrepresentative legislator, remains in all its force. There are other\r\nalterations, some possibly for the better, some certainly for the worse:\r\nbut to the author the merit or demerit of these smaller alterations\r\nappears to be of no moment, where the scheme itself is fundamentally\r\nvicious and absurd.\r\n\r\n[122] \"Non, ut olim, universæ legiones deducebantur, cum tribunis, et\r\ncenturionibus, et sui cujusque ordinis militibus, ut consensu et\r\ncaritate rempublicam efficerent; sed ignoti inter se, diversis\r\nmanipulis, sine rectore, sine affectibus mutuis, quasi ex alio genere\r\nmortalium repente in unum collecti, numerus magis quam colonia.\"--Tac.\r\nAnnal. lib. 14, sect. 27.--All this will be still more applicable to the\r\nunconnected, rotatory, biennial national assemblies, in this absurd and\r\nsenseless constitution.\r\n\r\n[123] Qualitas, Relatio, Actio, Passio, Ubi, Quando, Situs, Habitus.\r\n\r\n[124] See l'État de la France, p. 363.\r\n\r\n[125] In reality three, to reckon the provincial republican\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n[126] For further elucidations upon the subject of all these judicatures\r\nand of the Committee of Research, see M. de Calonne's work.\r\n\r\n[127] \"Comme sa Majesté a reconnu, non un système d'associations\r\nparticulières, mais une réunion de volontés de tous les François pour la\r\nliberté et la prospérité communes, ainsi pour le maintien de l'ordre\r\npublique, il a pensé qu'il convenoit que chaque régiment prît part à ces\r\nfêtes civiques pour multiplier les rapports, et resserrer les liens\r\nd'union entre les citoyens et les troupes.\"--Lest I should not be\r\ncredited, I insert the words authorizing the troops to feast with the\r\npopular confederacies.\r\n\r\n[128] This war minister has since quitted the school and resigned his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[129] Courrier François, 30 July, 1790. Assemblée Nationale, Numero 210.\r\n\r\n[130] I see by M. Necker's account, that the national guards of Paris\r\nhave received, over and above the money levied within their own city,\r\nabout 145,000_l._ sterling out of the public treasure. Whether this be\r\nan actual payment for the nine months of their existence, or an estimate\r\nof their yearly charge, I do not clearly perceive. It is of no great\r\nimportance, as certainly they may take whatever they please.\r\n\r\n[131] The reader will observe that I have but lightly touched (my plan\r\ndemanded nothing more) on the condition of the French finances as\r\nconnected with the demands upon them. If I had intended to do otherwise,\r\nthe materials in my hands for such a task are not altogether perfect. On\r\nthis subject I refer the reader to M. de Calonne's work, and the\r\ntremendous display that he has made of the havoc and devastation in the\r\npublic estate, and in all the affairs of France, caused by the\r\npresumptuous good intentions of ignorance and incapacity. Such effects\r\nthose causes will always produce. Looking over that account with a\r\npretty strict eye, and, with perhaps too much rigor, deducting\r\neverything which may be placed to the account of a financier out of\r\nplace, who might be supposed by his enemies desirous of making the most\r\nof his cause, I believe it will be found that a more salutary lesson of\r\ncaution against the daring spirit of innovators than what has been\r\nsupplied at the expense of France never was at any time furnished to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n[132] La Bruyère of Bossuet.\r\n\r\n[133] \"Ce n'est point à l'assemblée entière que je m'adresse ici; je ne\r\nparle qu'à ceux qui l'égarent, en lui cachant sous des gazes séduisantes\r\nle but où ils l'entraînent. C'est à eux que je dis: Votre objet, vous\r\nn'en disconviendrez pas, c'est d'ôter tout espoir au clergé, et de\r\nconsommer sa ruine; c'est-là, en ne vous soupçonnant d'aucune\r\ncombinaison de cupidité, d'aucun regard sur le jeu des effets publics,\r\nc'est-là ce qu'on doit croire que vous avez en vue dans la terrible\r\nopération que vous proposez; c'est ce qui doit en être le fruit. Mais le\r\npeuple qui vous y intéressez, quel avantage peut-il y trouver? En vous\r\nservant sans cesse de lui, que faites-vous pour lui? Rien, absolument\r\nrien; et, au contraire, vous faites ce qui ne conduit qu'à l'accabler de\r\nnouvelles charges. Vous avez rejeté, à son préjudice, une offre de 400\r\nmillions, dont l'acceptation pouvoit devenir un moyen de soulagement en\r\nsa faveur; et à cette ressource, aussi profitable que légitime, vous\r\navez substitué une injustice ruineuse, qui, de votre propre aveu, charge\r\nle trésor public, et par consequent le peuple, d'un surcroît de dépense\r\nannuelle de 50 millions an moins, et d'un remboursement de 150 millions.\r\n\r\n\"Malheureux peuple! voilà ce que vous vaut en dernier résultat\r\nl'expropriation de l'Église, et la dureté des décrets taxateurs du\r\ntraitement des ministres d'une religion bienfaisante; et désormais ils\r\nscront à votre charge: leurs charités soulageoient les pauvres; et vous\r\nallez être imposés pour subvenir à leur entretien!\"--_De l'État de la\r\nFrance,_ p. 81.
