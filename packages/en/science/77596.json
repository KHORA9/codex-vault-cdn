DIFFICULT PROJECT\r\n\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to win that reward, Roger, or close up shop.” Ted Dustin,\r\nyouthful president and general manager of Theodore Dustin, Inc., reached\r\nmechanically for his tobacco pouch, filled his black briar, and sighed.\r\n\r\nRoger Sanders, assistant to the president, deposited his sheaf of papers\r\non his desk, closed the door to the private office, and sat down in the\r\nchair facing his superior.\r\n\r\n“You mean—?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” replied Dustin, flicking his lighter with his thumb, “that in\r\norder to prepare the projectile for launching, we’ve spent every cent we\r\nhad, and borrowed a lot besides. Theodore Dustin, Inc., is flat broke,\r\nand the plant is mortgaged from roof to drains. If we don’t win that\r\nreward our creditors will be picking our bones in thirty days.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dustin.” A female voice, apparently issuing from empty air, spoke\r\nhis name. He turned to the radiovisiphone, a plain looking disc resting\r\non a small pedestal at his elbow. It was wireless, and contained no\r\nbuttons, levers or controls of any kind.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” As he spoke, the picture of his information clerk flashed on the\r\ndisc. The word “Yes” had completed the connection.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Evans of the ‘_Globe_’ would like to know if you are ready to\r\ninterview the representatives of the press.”\r\n\r\n“Any other reporters waiting?”\r\n\r\n“There are twenty-seven in the reception room. Mr. Evans says you told\r\nthem all to come at once.”\r\n\r\n“I did,” replied Dustin. “Send them up in five minutes. Off.”\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke the word “Off,” the picture disappeared, the connection\r\nhaving been broken by this word uttered alone with sharp emphasis.\r\n\r\nWhile Roger went out for chairs, he rose and walked to the window. For\r\nsome time he stood there, gazing at the smokeless, chimney-less\r\nfactories beneath him. During twenty of the thirty years of his life, or\r\nuntil 1954, there had been chimneys on these factories. Combustion—the\r\nburning of coal and oil—had been necessary to keep their wheels turning.\r\n\r\nBut Dustin had changed all this by his invention which economically\r\ncaptured and stored the energy of the sun, converting it into\r\nelectricity for light, heat and power, and putting manufacturing on a\r\nnewer, cleaner basis. Now, at the age of thirty, he had lived to see his\r\nsun power units in almost universal use.\r\n\r\nThe money derived from this he had immediately diverted to research and\r\nexperiment with a still mightier objective in view—to harness the power\r\nof the atom. On the eve of success he found his funds nearly dissipated,\r\nand therefore spent his last few dollars in the building of an\r\nemplacement, a gun, and a projectile, for the purpose of winning the\r\nmillion dollar reward offered by the Associated Governments of the Earth\r\nto the man who could first succeed in touching the moon with a finger of\r\nterrestrial matter.\r\n\r\nHe turned from the window as Roger ushered in a group of eager,\r\nexpectant reporters, and said:\r\n\r\n“Take seats, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight chairs creaked. Twenty-eight automatic interview recorders\r\nwere quickly swung forward on their shoulder straps and adjusted. Then\r\nthere was a tense moment of silence.\r\n\r\nTed cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“You fellows know,” he said, “that science, having conquered the air,\r\nnow wants to conquer interplanetary space. The first logical step is the\r\nshortest one. The nearest heavenly body being our moon, and that being\r\nfar enough away to present a pretty tough problem, the princely reward\r\nof a million dollars has been offered the man who will first send a\r\nprojectile or vehicle across this space and prove it to the satisfaction\r\nof the Associated Governments of the Earth.\r\n\r\n“Through some mysterious channel of communication, known only to you\r\nreporters, you found out that I had entered the race. Naturally I have,\r\nup until now, kept my plans a secret from the public and my competitors.\r\nBut that’s all over with, now. The gun, which was constructed according\r\nto my specifications by the American Ordnance Corporation, has a bore of\r\nseven feet and a length of three hundred and fifty. Despite the fact\r\nthat it will be reinforced to more than four times the proportionate\r\nthickness of the most powerful guns built today, my estimates show that\r\nit will be destroyed when the projectile is fired. It was shipped to\r\nDaphne Major, one of the smaller of the Galapagos Islands near the\r\nequator, on March 10th. My projectile, which was manufactured in my own\r\nfactory, was shipped today, fully assembled and crated, in an\r\nInternational Air Freighter.\r\n\r\n“I’ve calculated that March 20th will be the most favorable day for\r\nfiring my projectile, as it will be the day when the moon, in its\r\nendless race with our planet around the sun, will cross the path of the\r\nearth. The projectile will be timed and fired to overcome the forward\r\nspeed and gravity pull of the earth, travel in the arc imparted to it by\r\nthe earth’s axial rotation, and wait for the moon at precisely the right\r\npoint in space, according to my calculations. Its principle will greatly\r\nresemble that of the floating mines dropped by mine-layers in the World\r\nWar of forty years ago.\r\n\r\n“The force which will send the projectile out into space is one which I\r\nhave, after countless experiments, succeeded in liberating and, to some\r\nextent, directing. It’s the terrific force locked in the atom.\r\n\r\n“The motions of the projectile, after it has left the earth, will be\r\nautomatically controlled and corrected by my latest invention, the\r\natomotor, a mechanism which separates electrons from protons and\r\nutilizes the terrific repulsive force of protons toward protons and\r\nelectrons toward electrons, permitting them to escape through specially\r\nconstructed cylinders after they have imparted their energy to the\r\ncylinder heads and thence to the projectile. These cylinders are pointed\r\nin all directions, thus making it possible for the automatic course\r\ncorrecter to control the motions of the projectile.\r\n\r\n“The projectile will be protected at the base by a firing plate of\r\neasily melted metal, which will be destroyed before it leaves the\r\nearth’s atmosphere. It will also be protected by six outer layers of\r\nreinforced asbestos with braced vacuum spaces between them.\r\n\r\n“In the head of the projectile is a charge of explosive which will be\r\nset off by contact with any solid object. This powerful explosive will,\r\nwhen ignited, emit a lurid flash of light that will be easily visible if\r\nit strikes the dark side of the moon, and also a thick cloud of black,\r\nnon-luminous smoke that will spread over a circle a hundred miles in\r\ndiameter will be readily discernible if it strikes the light side.\r\n\r\n“On tomorrow, the sixteenth, I leave for Daphne Major for the purpose of\r\nloading and pointing the gun.\r\n\r\n“That’s all there is to the story, fellows, until after the gun is\r\nfired.”\r\n\r\nRoger opened the door, and the reporters, after wishing the young\r\ninventor success, filed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II. LAUNCHED\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 16th, Dustin and Sanders set out for the\r\nGalapagos in the former’s swift Blettendorf super-electroplane, which\r\nwas capable of a speed of eight hundred miles an hour. They arrived\r\nabout noon and worked assiduously, with the result that the gun was\r\nloaded and ready for the herculean task of lowering it into the\r\nemplacement by night.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth it was pointed according to the calculations of the\r\nyoung inventor, and on the eighteenth was braced in place by hundreds of\r\ntons of special, fast-setting, reinforced concrete.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth the U.S. Aerial Battleship Hawaii arrived with a group\r\nof trained observers, representing the Associated Governments of the\r\nEarth. She was equipped with high power telescopes, spectroscopes, and\r\nphotographic apparatus, all to be used by or under the direction of this\r\nassembly of picked scientists.\r\n\r\nBusy as he was in getting his men and equipment loaded and away from the\r\ndanger zone, Dustin was compelled to hold a reception for his\r\ndistinguished visitors, show them the gun and its emplacement, and\r\nanswer a thousand questions. Sanders, however, assumed the burdens of\r\nthe executive to such good purpose that before the scientists had\r\nboarded the Hawaii to be taken to their point of observation and there\r\nawait the zero hour, he had everything loaded and off the island.\r\n\r\nAll that night, and up until one thirty on the twentieth, the inventor\r\nbusied himself connecting the automatic firing apparatus and seeing that\r\nit was in perfect order.\r\n\r\nBy that time, Dustin, Sanders and Bevans, the pilot, were the only\r\nhumans left in the archipelago. After a cold lunch and a final tour of\r\ninspection, each man made ready to play his part.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that the moon would cross the path of the earth at 6\r\nhours, 53 minutes and 13 seconds past noon, central standard time. This\r\nbrought the firing time to 2 hours, 32 minutes and 22 seconds past noon,\r\nor approximately 2:30 P.M.\r\n\r\nPromptly at 2:20, Bevans started the helicopter blades and rising above\r\nthe rim of the crater headed northwest toward the point on the equator,\r\n97½° west longitude, which it was thought would be most favorable for\r\nobservation, and to which the scientists had gone the evening before.\r\nThis was less than a forty minute run for the powerful\r\nsuper-electroplane.\r\n\r\nAs they hurtled along, Ted glanced, from time to time, at the\r\nchronometer. At 2:30 he hastily unslung his binoculars, opened the rear\r\nwindow and trained them in the direction of Daphne Major.\r\n\r\n“Can’t see the island from here, can you?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly. It’s a good two hundred and fifty miles back and we couldn’t\r\npossibly rise high enough to bring it to our horizon line.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do you expect to see?”\r\n\r\n“Some sign of the explosion, possibly. Take a look for yourself.”\r\n\r\nWhile Roger trained his own binoculars rearward, Ted called up to\r\nBevans:\r\n\r\n“Start the smoke trail at 2:35,” he ordered, “and watch for aerial\r\nwaves. We may be in for a good shaking up.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir.”\r\n\r\nAt 2:32, Ted and Roger sat with bated breath, their binoculars directed\r\ntoward the archipelago, listening intently while the chronometer ticked\r\noff the seconds.\r\n\r\nThe zero hour arrived and for two seconds thereafter the anxious\r\nwatchers saw nothing. Then, with amazing suddenness, a gray,\r\nmushroom-shaped cloud spread skyward above the horizon. Just above it, a\r\nthin pencil of smoke was barely discernible through the glasses,\r\npointing straight toward the zenith.\r\n\r\n“Hurray! She’s off!” shouted Roger.\r\n\r\nTed did not answer. His face grew suddenly grave.\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Roger. “Isn’t everything all right?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid we’ve started something we didn’t consider in our\r\ncalculations,” he replied. “Do you see that black cloud forcing its way\r\nupward through the gray one?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And the band of yellow immediately beneath it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. What is it?”\r\n\r\n“A volcanic eruption,” replied Ted. “Daphne Major, you will remember,\r\nwas the crater of an extinct volcano. We’ve blown off the top, and\r\noutraged Mother Earth is doing the rest. Appears like a terrific\r\neruption from here, too. And look: There’s a reply from the heavens. See\r\nthose flashes in the clouds? A thunder storm has formed in the upper\r\nregions.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment thick, black smoke began belching from the rear of the\r\nelectroplane, and their view to the rear was obscured.\r\n\r\n“Full speed ahead, Bevans,” shouted Ted. “Give her all you’ve got. We’re\r\ndue for a heavy squall in less than five minutes.”\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, signs of terrific agitation in the atmosphere were\r\nregistered in the rear of the smoke trail.\r\n\r\n“Ascend at an angle of 45°,” ordered Ted. “We’ll ride with the gale.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he spoken ere the plane received such a shock that both Ted\r\nand Roger were thrown to the floor. It was accompanied by a continuous\r\nroar as of a thousand thunder-claps let loose at once, echoing and\r\nreechoing with seemingly undiminished intensity for several minutes.\r\n\r\nRising with difficulty, for the ship careened frightfully, Ted dragged\r\nhimself to the rear window and looked out. Their smoke trail had been\r\ncompletely dissipated, and once more he had a clear view toward the\r\nrear. Two things he noted, almost simultaneously—a mountainous,\r\nwhite-crested wall of water swiftly overtaking them on the surface of\r\nthe Pacific, and just above it a swirling, tumbling mass of clouds,\r\nblack beneath and silvery white above, with vivid flashes of forked\r\nlightning playing between them. He shouted up the speaking tube:\r\n\r\n“Higher, Bevans. Use your helicopters, man, or we’re lost!”\r\n\r\nThere was a jerk and a roar as Bevans hastily threw the helicopters into\r\ngear, then a rapid upward movement that glued them to the floor until\r\ntheir bodies had gained momentum.\r\n\r\nQuick though he had been in carrying out orders, the pilot was not quick\r\nenough for the forces of Nature. As if incensed at this puny attempt of\r\nman to conquer her, she seized the frail craft in the grasp of her\r\npowerful winds and played with it as if it had been a feather. At the\r\nfirst impact Ted saw Roger strike his head on the edge of the\r\nrefrigerator and slump to the floor. He tried to go to him, but found\r\nthis impossible. The craft dipped dizzily, spun like a top, and rolled\r\nend over end. Gripping the doorknob, unable to help his fallen\r\ncompanion, he found his feet sometimes in midair, sometimes on the wall,\r\nand sometimes on the very ceiling. There was an unending glare of\r\nlightning and a continuous roar of thunder. Rain, sleet, and ice pellets\r\nalternately beat in through the unclosed rear window.\r\n\r\nThe craft steadied a bit for an instant, and Ted succeeded in seizing\r\nRoger’s ankle. Dragging the limp form of his companion toward him, he\r\npassed his arm beneath the slender body and held it as best he could,\r\nmeanwhile keeping a tight grip on the doorknob. Though the storm\r\ncontinued outside, Bevans seemed to be getting the plane under control\r\nonce more, for it rocked less and less as time went on.\r\n\r\nPresently, too, the lightning flashes appeared farther apart, and the\r\nintervening darkness grew steadily lighter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able to release his grip on the doorknob, Ted gently\r\nlowered his assistant to the floor of the disordered cabin. Switching on\r\nthe light, he made a hasty examination of the gash in the pale forehead\r\nand found, to his relief, that there was no skull fracture. After\r\ncarefully dressing it from the contents of the emergency kit, he placed\r\na pillow beneath the head of the still unconscious Roger, and made his\r\nway to the rear window. At a glance, he saw that they had risen above\r\nthe electrical storm, but were still beneath a dense cloud stratum that\r\nshut off the sunlight like a blanket. He shouted up to the pilot:\r\n\r\n“All right, Bevans?”\r\n\r\n“Sound as a dollar, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Good. Keep those helicopters going and see if we can get up into the\r\nsunlight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nRoger moaned feebly, then opened his eyes as Ted bent over him.\r\n\r\n“Wh-what happened?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“You were knocked out. Nothing dangerous. Be all right soon. Want\r\nanything?”\r\n\r\n“Cigarette.”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing. Here.”\r\n\r\nTed placed it between the ashen lips and fired it with his atomic\r\nlighter.\r\n\r\n“Lie still for a while,” he counseled. “I’m going to try to make some\r\nobservations if we can ever get above these confounded clouds.”\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the welcome flash of sunlight appeared. After\r\nmaking his observations, Ted calculated that they had been driven more\r\nthan three hundred miles southwest of their course by the storm. When\r\nthe plane was once more headed toward the point where they hoped to find\r\nthe Hawaii, he descended the stairway to see what he could do for Roger.\r\nHe found him in one of the cabin chairs, curiously examining a film of\r\ndust that had formed on the map-table.\r\n\r\n“Where do you suppose that came from?” he asked, poking it with his\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n“Volcanic ash,” replied Dustin. “Sometimes travels clear around the\r\nworld, so we needn’t be surprised to find it here after that huge\r\nupheaval. How’s the head feeling now, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Better, thanks.”\r\n\r\n“Good. We’ll just have time for a cold snack before we board the\r\nHawaii.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had eaten, Ted took food up to the pilot and steered the\r\nship while he ate.\r\n\r\n“Nearly there, aren’t we, sir?” asked Bevans, after he had swallowed the\r\nlast morsel.\r\n\r\n“Almost. I’ll give you the signal to descend, from the cabin. We’re\r\ngoing to need our searchlight, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\nOnce more in the cabin, Ted consulted his instruments. Presently he gave\r\nthe order to descend. In a moment they were plunged into deep gloom\r\nwhich the mighty searchlights failed to penetrate for more than fifty\r\nfeet in any direction.\r\n\r\n“We’ll never find them this way,” said Ted. “Try the radio, Roger, will\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nSanders sat down in front of the powerful instrument and turned the\r\ndials.\r\n\r\n“She’s dead,” he announced. “That electrical storm must have burned out\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“Here. You keep watch while I see what’s wrong,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\nIt only took the inventor a moment to find the trouble.\r\n\r\n“Burned out every tube,” he said, “and I forgot to bring a spare set.\r\nWe’ll just have to keep cruising around, I guess, and hope for luck. A\r\nnice mess we’ve gotten into.”\r\n\r\n“For my part I’m thankful to be alive, radio or no radio,” said Roger.\r\n\r\n“Righto, but I’ll certainly be disappointed if I can’t be aboard the\r\nHawaii with those official observers when the projectile strikes the\r\nmoon. We may be able to see it with our binoculars, but I doubt it.”\r\n\r\nAs they cruised about in ever widening circles, the time slipped away,\r\nbut there was no sign of the Hawaii. Presently, when the chronometer\r\nshowed 6:20 Ted gave up the search and ordered Bevans to hurry back to\r\nthe designated observation point. They barely reached it at 6:50, and\r\nanother minute was consumed in rising above the highest cloud stratum.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and the half-illumined orb of the moon was just above\r\nthe western horizon. Both men trained their binoculars on it\r\nsimultaneously. Came 6:53 and they waited tensely for the thirteenth\r\nsecond, at which instant the projectile was calculated to strike.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth second came and went without incident. The fourteenth—and\r\nthen—directly in the center of the celestial target things happened.\r\nBoth men simultaneously saw a tiny light flash for an instant across the\r\ndark side of the moon’s sunrise line, while a small black spot slowly\r\ngrew in size on the sunlit side of the line.\r\n\r\n“Hurray! She hit dead center!” shouted Roger.\r\n\r\nTed watched the black spot in silence for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Seems to have landed plumb in the middle of the crater, Hipparchus,”\r\nreplied Ted. “Thought I had miscalculated the time, for an instant, but\r\nI see the reason now. We saw the flash just 1¼ seconds after it took\r\nplace because it takes light that long to travel from the moon to the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nThe black spot faded perceptibly. In a minute more it had disappeared\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n“There goes our evidence,” said Ted. “I hope they saw it while it\r\nlasted.”\r\n\r\nHe called up through the speaking tube:\r\n\r\n“Back to Chicago, Bevans.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         III. STARTLING RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dustin reached his office in Chicago, he found a terse radiogram\r\nfrom the commander of the U.S. Aerial Battleship, Alaska, awaiting him.\r\n\r\n  Just found the Hawaii, wrecked on surface of Pacific with radio out of\r\n  commission. Official observers unable to see moon on account of\r\n  clouds. Am towing the Hawaii to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n                                               J. C. Farrell, Commander,\r\n                                                      _U.S.A.B. Alaska_.\r\n\r\nHe read it in silence, then handed it to Sanders.\r\n\r\n“Does this mean that we lose, Ted?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It means,” replied Ted, gamely trying to disguise the quiver of\r\ndisappointment in his voice, “that Theodore Dustin, Inc., will be sold\r\nfor the benefit of creditors—lock, stock and barrel, within the next\r\nthirty days.”\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed, Ted and Roger were kept busy putting the\r\naffairs of the company in order, preparatory to turning it over to its\r\ncreditors. At the final moment their attorney had secured them an extra\r\nthirty day extension, but this, after all, was only a prolonging of the\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nA Russian manufacturer had made the highest bid for the plant and\r\npatents, and sorrow prevailed in the entire organization when it was\r\nannounced that the creditors would, in all probability, accept the bid.\r\n\r\nThe indignant official observers had, as Ted had predicted, unanimously\r\ndeclared against even a probability that his projectile had struck the\r\nmoon. True, an unofficial observer in Guatemala had reported seeing a\r\nflash and a dark cloud near the crater Herschel at the appointed time,\r\nbut this statement was unsupported from other quarters and, therefore,\r\nof no value to Ted’s claims.\r\n\r\nThe eruption and storm had made it impossible for the South American\r\nobservatories to view the moon at all at that time, while all other\r\nobservatories so situated as to have even slight opportunity for a\r\nglimpse at the proper moment, reported exceptionally cloudy weather.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 5th, Dustin sat moodily in his private office,\r\nsurrounded by a thick cloud of blue smoke from his black briar, when\r\nSanders burst into the room waving a newspaper which he thrust beneath\r\nthe eyes of his employer.\r\n\r\n“Can you beat this, Ted?” he asked. “They say your projectile came back\r\nto the earth and nearly destroyed London!”\r\n\r\nTed read the screaming headline, and gasped.\r\n\r\n                    _TERRIFIC EXPLOSION NEAR LONDON!_\r\n                        _MAY BE DUSTIN PROJECTILE_\r\n                           _RETURNED TO EARTH_\r\n\r\n  _At four thirty this morning a huge missile fell into the Thames River\r\n  near Gravesend. It exploded with terrible force, killing more than\r\n  fourteen hundred people, and injuring thousands. The shock of the\r\n  explosion was felt all over the British Isles as well as on\r\n  continental Europe, and was registered by seismographs all over the\r\n  world._\r\n\r\n  _Scientists have calculated that the projectile fired by the inventor,\r\n  Theodore Dustin, would return to the earth in thirty days, but they\r\n  now believe it must have traveled in a larger orbit than they\r\n  estimated, and that this is the missile of Dustin returning later than\r\n  predicted._\r\n\r\nTed pushed the paper aside wearily.\r\n\r\n“The ‘I told you so’ boys are at it again, Roger,” he said. “They make\r\nme sick. In order to prove a pet theory, they’re trying to make a\r\nwholesale murderer of me in the eyes of the world. I’m weary of it all.”\r\n\r\nThen a voice suddenly issued from the radiovisiphone. It was the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dustin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Station WNB-437 announces that it is about to broadcast important\r\ninternational news. Shall I tune it in for you?”\r\n\r\n“Please.”\r\n\r\nA picture instantly flashed on the disc of the radiovisiphone—the\r\nannouncer for the World News Broadcasters, standing in the station at\r\nWashington, D.C. He held a paper in one hand, and a watch in the other,\r\nevidently waiting for the exact second to begin his announcement.\r\nPresently he cleared his throat and looked up.\r\n\r\n“We have just received a communication from Paris, France,” he\r\nannounced. “A projectile similar to that which fell in the Thames near\r\nGravesend has fallen into the heart of Paris. The city is in ruins and\r\nthere has been a terrific loss of life, unestimated at this time. This\r\nshock, like the one which came a few hours ago, has been recorded by\r\nseismographs all over the world. Scientists who hold that the previous\r\nexplosion was caused by the Dustin projectile have issued no statements\r\nregarding this one. No one we have consulted can offer any explanation\r\nof this singular and terrible occurrence.”\r\n\r\nThe announcer paused, then turned to receive a new sheet of paper from a\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n“The situation with regard to these projectiles is becoming more serious\r\nevery minute,” he said. “I have here a radio message from New York City.\r\nA third missile has just fallen into New York Harbor, sinking or\r\ndestroying all shipping in the vicinity, killing and maiming thousands\r\nof people, and shattering glass in the windows for miles around. Two\r\nBroadway skyscrapers are reported to have toppled to the street, adding\r\nto the shambles as panic-stricken people scurrying for shelter were\r\ncrushed in the ruins.”\r\n\r\nAgain the announcer paused to receive a new sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n“A message from Professor Fowler of the Yerkes Observatory states that\r\nhe was looking at the moon this morning between the hours of one and\r\nfour o’clock, and that during that period he saw five distinct and quite\r\nbrilliant flashes of light in the region of the crater, Ptolemy. He has\r\njust learned of the explosions at London, Paris and New York, and thinks\r\nthat they may have some connection with what he saw on the moon early\r\nthis morning. It is his theory that the moon is suffering from a\r\nbombardment similar to that which the earth is undergoing.”\r\n\r\nThe picture of the announcer suddenly disappeared from the disc and that\r\nof Dustin’s operator appeared.\r\n\r\n“I had to tune out WNB-437, sir,” she apologized. “The President of the\r\nUnited States is calling.”\r\n\r\n“Tune him in,” replied Dustin.\r\n\r\nInstantly there flashed on the disc the familiar countenance of\r\nPresident Whitmore. He looked worried, and his voice trembled slightly\r\nas he asked:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dustin, have you any explanation of the calamities that have\r\novertaken the world in the last few hours?”\r\n\r\n“I have no facts for you at present, Mr. President,” replied Dustin,\r\n“but I have a theory.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?”\r\n\r\n“It is my belief that the moon is bombarding the earth. She reached an\r\nadvantageous firing position last night, and Professor Fowler saw five\r\nflashes between one and four o’clock this morning. According to my\r\ntheory she left five huge interplanetary mines in the path of the earth\r\nand we have already run afoul of three of them. Moreover, they were\r\naimed and timed with such accuracy that one of our chief cities has been\r\ndestroyed and two more came near to meeting the same fate.”\r\n\r\n“You have stated that your projectile struck the moon. Do you believe\r\nthat our satellite is inhabited, and that the explosions we have\r\nexperienced were mines or missiles, fired in reprisal by the lunar\r\ninhabitants?”\r\n\r\n“That is my belief, Mr. President.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Mr. Dustin, you are jointly responsible with the Associated\r\nGovernments of the Earth for this horrible and unexpected catastrophe,\r\nand we shall look to you to see that the bombardment is stopped.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Mr. President, but I am without funds, and my company is to\r\nbe taken from me by my creditors in a few days.”\r\n\r\n“This, Mr. Dustin,” replied the President, “is an international\r\nemergency, and must be met with every ounce of power at our command. We\r\nneed you—the world needs you and your organization. Draw on the\r\ngovernment for such funds as you require at once, and I will issue an\r\norder on the treasury for sufficient funds to satisfy every one of your\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\n“At present I can only promise you the cooperation of our own\r\ngovernment, but I am calling a meeting of the Associated Governments\r\ntoday, and I feel sure they will be with us. Do all you can, as quickly\r\nas you can, and spare no expense to carry the thing through as swiftly\r\nas possible.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best, Mr. President,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the President faded from the disc, and Roger rose from\r\nhis seat, his face aglow with enthusiasm for this new undertaking.\r\n\r\n“Atta boy, Ted!” he said. “When do we start? And how?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IV. MOON PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day the factory of Theodore Dustin, Inc., hummed with\r\nan activity it had not known for weeks.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Ted’s prediction regarding the other two missiles from the\r\nmoon had come true shortly after he had uttered them, solidified public\r\nconfidence in him to a degree even greater than that he had enjoyed\r\nbefore the firing of his own projectile and his subsequent condemnation\r\nby the official observers.\r\n\r\nThe last two missiles to strike the earth had apparently not been aimed\r\nso accurately as the others, but the intent of those who fired them had\r\nbeen just as evident, for one had plumped into the middle of Lake\r\nMichigan, not far from Chicago, and the other had alighted in the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea near Rome, both causing tidal waves and some damage to\r\nshipping, but without the large number of fatalities which attended the\r\nfalls of the others.\r\n\r\nThere were people, of course, who condemned Ted for having fired his\r\nprojectile to the moon and thus having brought about the bombardment in\r\nreprisal—a bombardment which, for all they knew, might take place every\r\nmonth at the time the moon was in a favorable firing position.\r\n\r\nNone there were, however, who condemned the youthful scientist so\r\nthoroughly as he condemned himself. Not that he spent his time, or any\r\npart of it, in self-reproach. There was, in fact, no time for anything\r\nbut work, with the busy program he had set for himself and his men.\r\n\r\nTwo major projects, both being carried on at once, claimed every minute\r\nof his waking time. One was the building of a gigantic radio station,\r\nwith which he hoped to get into communication with the inhabitants of\r\nthe moon. The other, the construction of an interplanetary vehicle\r\ndriven by atomotors, in which he hoped to reach the moon in person. The\r\nradio, he expected to have ready for service in two weeks, but the\r\nvehicle, because the manufacture of many of its delicate and intricate\r\nparts could only be entrusted to a few of his best men, would take six\r\nweeks to complete at the very least.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three days and nights he worked without sleep. Then\r\noutraged nature asserted itself, and he was compelled to rest. From then\r\nuntil the day of the completion of the radio station, he put himself on\r\na sleep ration of four hours a day.\r\n\r\nOn May 19th, just two weeks after the projectiles from the moon had\r\nstruck the earth, and nearly two months from the day Dustin’s projectile\r\nhad exploded on the moon, there was a large and august assemblage in the\r\ngeneral office of Theodore Dustin, Inc.\r\n\r\nForty of the world’s leading linguists, representing every race and\r\ncolor on the globe, talked excitedly in a multiplicity of tongues. Nor\r\nwere modern languages solely represented, for there was a small group of\r\nmen whose life studies had been the forgotten languages of the past—men\r\nwho had wrested from crypts, pyramids, monuments, caves, and the ruins\r\nof ancient cities, temples and fortresses, the secrets of the speech of\r\nthe ancients.\r\n\r\nNor were these all. A still smaller group consisted of the greatest men\r\nof science, sent by the leading nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, they glanced expectantly at the door of Dustin’s\r\nprivate office.\r\n\r\nPresently the door opened and Dustin stepped out, accompanied by\r\nPresident Whitmore of the United States.\r\n\r\nInstantly the buzz of conversation ceased, as Ted held his hand aloft\r\nfor silence.\r\n\r\n“We are ready, gentlemen,” he announced. “Follow me to the elevators.”\r\n\r\nThree trips of the elevators landed everyone on the roof. In the center\r\nwas a building containing the sending and receiving apparatus. Overhead\r\nwere stretched the wires of the gigantic aerial.\r\n\r\nTed conducted his party to the doorway of the building and into a small\r\nauditorium with seats and desks arranged in a semicircle. Here Sanders\r\nmet them and assisted Ted in showing each man to the desk which had been\r\nprovided for him.\r\n\r\nWhen all were seated, Ted and Roger pulled back two sliding doors which\r\ndisclosed a small stage and a radiovisiphone with a disc ten feet in\r\ndiameter, which faced the gathering.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. President,” said Ted, “if you will do us the honor of pressing\r\nthe button on the desk before you, you will close the circuit of the set\r\nthrough which we hope to establish communication with the inhabitants of\r\nthe moon. The zero hour has arrived. In accordance with the orders of\r\nthe Associated Governments of the Earth, every broadcasting station in\r\nthe world has ceased to function.”\r\n\r\nThe President smiled and pressed the button. A terrific crackling roar\r\nfrom the radiovisiphone followed his action.\r\n\r\nTed speedily adjusted a set of dials on the desk before him, and the\r\nroar subsided. Then he stepped before the radiovisiphone.\r\n\r\n“People of the Moon,” he said, “we know not in what language to address\r\nyou, so we are about to speak to you in all the known languages of the\r\nearth. Our mission is one of peace—our purpose to make apology for\r\nhaving wronged you—a people of whom we know nothing, and whose very\r\nexistence we did not suspect. Will you answer us, People of the Moon?”\r\n\r\nThe young inventor evidently did not expect a reply—not so soon, at\r\nleast. He turned, and beckoned to the German linguist to take his place.\r\nIt was his purpose to have the speech repeated in each language in turn.\r\nAbout to step down from the platform, he was startled by sudden cries of\r\namazement from the men facing him.\r\n\r\n“Look, Ted! Look quickly, behind you!” he heard Roger shout.\r\n\r\nAs he faced the radiovisiphone once more, it was his turn to gasp in\r\nastonishment not unmingled with awe, for revealed in the pellucid depths\r\nof the ten foot disk, and apparently not five feet from him, stood a\r\nwoman—a glorious vision of feminine beauty that held him entranced.\r\n\r\nShe was not large—a scant five feet in height, he judged—but there was a\r\ncertain dignity in her bearing which somehow made her appear taller. The\r\ngolden glory that was her hair, dressed in a style new and strange to\r\nthe inventor, was held by a band of platinum-like metal powdered with\r\nglistening jewels. Her clothing, if judged by earthly standards, was not\r\nclothing at all. Gleaming meshes of white metal, woven closely together,\r\nformed a light, shimmering garment that covered though it revealed the\r\nlines of her shapely breasts, slender waist, and lissom hips, leaving\r\narms, shoulders and legs bare. A jeweled dagger hung from a chain-like\r\nbelt about her waist, and a huge ruby blazed on the index finger of her\r\nleft hand. On her feet were sandals, apparently constructed from the\r\nwhite metal.\r\n\r\nBehind the young lady whose appearance had so amazed the distinguished\r\ngathering of scientists, stood two men, each well over six feet tall.\r\nThey appeared to be guards, for each leaned on the hilt of a huge,\r\nbroad-bladed, scimitar-like weapon that reached from the floor to the\r\nlevel of his breast, and both wore shining plate armor and helmets of\r\nstrange design.\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled, revealing at the same time, a set of small, even white\r\nteeth, and a most adorable pair of dimples. Then she spoke. Ted stood\r\nlike one bewitched, listening to the clear, flute-like tones, but Roger\r\nhad the presence of mind to turn on the recorder.\r\n\r\nShe had not spoken more than a dozen words, however, when the image in\r\nthe disc blurred and her voice was drowned by a confusion of discordant\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong?” asked the President of the United States, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Another station cutting in, damn it!” replied Ted, frantically turning\r\nhis wave-trap dial with one hand and the selector dials with the other.\r\n\r\nWhile he labored with the dials an image seemed slowly to be forming in\r\nthe disc, taking the place of the one which had just disappeared. For a\r\ntime, two voices were heard, one unmistakably that of the girl, growing\r\nfainter and fainter, the other, the coarse tones of a man, constantly\r\nincreasing in intensity.\r\n\r\nAs the new image cleared, it proved to be that of a man of remarkable\r\ndimensions—with a body that was almost globular, to which were attached\r\nincongruously slender arms and legs. Although he could not have been\r\nmore than five feet tall, his round head was nearly twice as large as\r\nthat of the average earth man of six feet. His nose was flat, and his\r\neyes slanted toward his temples above exceptionally prominent cheek\r\nbones. As he spoke in sing-song monosyllables, he disclosed rat-like\r\nteeth, set far apart, and wobbled a long, thin moustache, the two ends\r\nof which drooped from the corners of his mouth to his breast.\r\n\r\nOn his head was a tall pointed helmet of gleaming yellow metal, built up\r\nin tiers like a pagoda and ending in a sharp spike. His body was encased\r\nin scale-like armor of the same yellow metal, and his breast was crossed\r\nby two purple sashes, fastened at their intersection by a golden\r\nmedallion on which was emblazoned a scarlet dragon. From one of these\r\ndepended a sword with a small, round guard, and a hilt nearly a foot in\r\nlength, and from the other, a weapon which slightly resembled an\r\nautomatic pistol. Behind him stood a semicircle of smaller beings of\r\nsimilar rotund shape, whose helmets were shorter and of copper-colored\r\nmetal, as were their suits of armor. They wore brown sashes and copper\r\nmedallions emblazoned with green dragons, and in addition to weapons\r\nsimilar to those of the larger man, carried tall poles surmounted by\r\nsharp discs that slightly resembled buzz-saws with exceptionally long\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the girl had created a stir in the room, but when\r\nthese grotesque creatures became plainly visible on the disc, animated\r\nwhispers turned to an uproar, and Ted was forced to call for silence.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the confusion abated, ere an aged Chinese doctor arose and\r\ncame up beside Ted.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Dr. Wu?” asked the young scientist, his hands busy with the\r\ndials. “Can you understand him?”\r\n\r\n“A word, here and there, seems intelligible—something like the language\r\nof my revered ancestors.”\r\n\r\nAt sight of Dr. Wu, the speaker in the disc paused and nodded. It was as\r\nif he had recognized someone racially akin to him. The doctor bowed and\r\nsmiled in return, and said something in a monosyllabic tongue. Its\r\nphonetic similarity to that which had come from the globular being was\r\nstriking, as was the fact that there was a slight facial resemblance\r\nbetween Dr. Wu and the lunar speaker.\r\n\r\nThe Lunite pursed his lips and knit his brows as if endeavoring to\r\nunderstand. He turned to the semicircle of men behind him. They all\r\nappeared puzzled. Then he dispatched one of them, who disappeared from\r\nthe disc, and facing Dr. Wu once more, uttered a short sentence.\r\n\r\nIt was the doctor’s turn to knit his brows and shake his head. Again he\r\nessayed speech with the armored man. Apparently he was not understood.\r\nThe process was repeated several more times with the same result. It\r\nseemed that the two were on the verge of understanding each other, yet\r\ncould not quite make themselves intelligible.\r\n\r\nThen the man who had disappeared from the disc a few minutes before\r\nreappeared with another, a bent figure who hung on his arm for support.\r\nHis face was wrinkled and toothless, his sparse moustache was gray, and\r\nhis limbs were more spindly than those of the others. Instead of armor\r\nhe wore a garment of quilted black cloth over his emaciated form.\r\n\r\nThe man in the gold armor looked at Dr. Wu, then pointed to the old man\r\nand uttered a few words. The doctor nodded, and addressed him. The old\r\nfellow pondered for a moment, then shook his head. Again Dr. Wu spoke to\r\nhim. He shook his head once more, and reaching beneath his robe, drew\r\nforth a scroll and writing brush. After rapidly tracing a number of\r\ncharacters on the scroll, he held it up. The writing bore a striking\r\nresemblance to Chinese.\r\n\r\nSeizing Ted’s sleeve, the doctor spoke excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Is the photo-recorder on?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I believe I can translate that writing, given time.”\r\n\r\nFacing the old man in the disc, Dr. Wu again nodded and smiled. Then he\r\npointed skyward and said:\r\n\r\n“_T’ien._”\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded, smiled, and repeated excitedly: “_T’ien! T’ien!_”\r\nthen bowed as if in devotion.\r\n\r\nThe doctor also made the devotional obeisance and said:\r\n\r\n“_Shang Ti._”\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head, signifying that he could not understand.\r\nThen he pointed to the man in the golden armor, and said:\r\n\r\n“_P’an-ku._”\r\n\r\n“_P’an-ku!_” repeated the doctor with a look of astonishment on his\r\nface, and made obeisance to the golden one.\r\n\r\nThat individual, with a look of annoyance, suddenly turned on the old\r\nman and released a volley of monosyllables. The old fellow groveled\r\nbefore him and shook his head.\r\n\r\nThen he of the golden armor made a sign with his hand, whereupon the\r\ndisc suddenly became blank.\r\n\r\n“Guess the interview is over,” said Ted, shutting off the radio. “Now\r\nhow can we find out what it was all about?”\r\n\r\n“I can explain the last three words,” said Dr. Wu. “‘_T’ien_,’ is the\r\noldest word in our language which has the meaning of ‘The Heavens’ or\r\n‘God.’ This word was understood. ‘_Shang Ti_,’ a later word for ‘God,’\r\nwas unintelligible. The old man pointed to the one who was evidently the\r\nruler, and said: ‘_P’an-ku_.’ According to our traditions, ‘_P’an-ku_’\r\nwas the first human being, corresponding to the ‘Adam’ of your Bible.”\r\n\r\n“From which one might deduce,” said Ted, “that the people we have just\r\ninterviewed are remotely related to your earliest ancestors.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems. If you will let me have the phonetic and written records,\r\nand a fast electroplane, I believe that by consulting our ancient\r\nwritings I may be able to render a translation in a few days.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid!” replied Ted. “Both will be ready within an hour.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        V. ULTIMATUM OF P’AN-KU\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later Ted received a radiogram from Peiping, reading as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Honorable Sir:\r\n\r\n  I avail myself of the privilege of submitting below the result of my\r\n  poor efforts at deciphering the written characters of the Moon People.\r\n  The spoken language was, with the exception of a few scattered words\r\n  which cannot be put together to make sense, wholly unintelligible to\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n  Here follows my sorry translation:\r\n\r\n  _Why have you destroyed Ur? You, the people of Du Gong have thrown to\r\n  us, the Imperial Government of P’an-ku, mightiest emperor of Ma Gong,\r\n  the tcha-tsi_ (meaning unknown to translator) _of war. We are greater\r\n  and wiser than you, and can crush you with ease._\r\n\r\n  _You have demonstrated that you are not fit to govern yourselves—that\r\n  you are a menace to the people of the great Lord Sun, his eight\r\n  apostles and their children. The Imperial Government of P’an-ku will\r\n  send a viceroy to rule over you. Submit, and you will live happily,\r\n  the subjects of P’an-ku. Resist, and you will be destroyed._\r\n\r\n  In my humble and unworthy opinion, the word, “_tcha-tsi_,” means\r\n  either some instrument of war or perhaps a challenge to war, and has\r\n  the same symbolical significance as does the gauntlet in English.\r\n\r\n                                                                  Dr. Wu\r\n\r\nThe contents of this message were immediately transmitted to the\r\nPresident of the United States, and he lost no time in calling a council\r\nof the Associated Governments of the Earth by radiovisiphone. Ted Dustin\r\nwas a party to the conference, and assisted in drafting a placatory note\r\nto P’an-ku. The note, which was sent to Dr. Wu for translation into the\r\nLunite language, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _To the Imperial Government of P’an-ku_:\r\n\r\n  _Greeting_:\r\n\r\n  The Associated Governments of the Earth regret the destruction of Ur,\r\n  and are willing to do all in their power to make amends.\r\n\r\n  The destruction was unintentional, as the Associated Governments of\r\n  the Earth were unaware that Ma Gong was inhabited.\r\n\r\n  The Associated Governments of the Earth make full apology for having\r\n  wronged the people of Ur, and stand willing to pay a reasonable\r\n  indemnity in treasure, food, raw materials, or manufactured products,\r\n  but are united in the purpose to resist and retaliate for any attempt\r\n  at conquest.\r\n\r\nAfter the note had been drafted and dispatched it was unanimously\r\ndecided at the meeting that Ted was entitled to the million dollar\r\nreward, there being now no longer any doubt that his projectile had\r\nstruck the moon. The treasurer of the association was, accordingly,\r\nordered to pay him that amount.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening when Ted called Roger into his private\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n“Get that translation from Dr. Wu, yet?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I had it painted in large white letters on a black placard and\r\nmounted on an easel in front of the big disc.”\r\n\r\n“Good. We’ll go up now. Everything will be ordered off the air in five\r\nminutes, and we’ll try to get it through.”\r\n\r\nThey took the elevator to the tower room, where the linguists,\r\nscientists, and representatives of the associated powers were assembled\r\nas before. President Whitmore was not present, however, because of\r\nurgent business in Washington. His place was taken by the Secretary of\r\nState. Dr. Wu, who was also unable to be present, was represented by Dr.\r\nFang, a Chinese scholar of almost equal repute.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock, the zero hour, Ted promptly pressed the button and began\r\nmanipulating the dials.\r\n\r\nThis time he was instantly rewarded by the appearance of the dazzlingly\r\nbeautiful girl who had faded from his vision on the occasion of his last\r\nattempt at communication. She was attended by two armed guards as\r\nbefore, and in addition by a bent, graybearded man who wore a richly\r\nembroidered robe of dark blue, and sandals.\r\n\r\nBoth glanced at the writing on the placard which Ted held up. Eagerly\r\nwatching their faces, he saw that they registered amazement and horror.\r\nWondering what there could be about this pacific message to cause such a\r\nreaction, he called Dr. Fang and asked him to write the query: “What is\r\nwrong?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor, a thin, rat-faced Manchu, came forward, but said he did not\r\nknow the symbols for the words.\r\n\r\nThe girl, meanwhile, had a scroll and writing brush brought forward by a\r\nfemale attendant. The latter held the scroll aloft so its surface was\r\nfully visible, and the girl began rapidly writing two sets of characters\r\nthereon. One set was similar to those which had been used in the\r\nprevious communication. The other was totally unlike it and bore no\r\nresemblance to any known earthly characters. Her purpose, however, was\r\nquite evident. The two sets of characters were written in alternating\r\nperpendicular line side by side, in order that the former language might\r\nbe used as a key to the latter.\r\n\r\nQuick to grasp her idea, Ted called for the photo-record of the message\r\nfrom the Imperial Government of P’an-ku. Beside it, he wrote the English\r\ntranslation, using Roman capital letters for the sake of simplicity.\r\nThen beside the placarded note to the Government of P’an-ku, he wrote\r\nthe original of that note, also in Roman capitals. In addition, he\r\npointed out and distinctly pronounced the English words, one by one.\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded, smiled, and pointed questioningly at him.\r\n\r\n“Ted Dustin,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to herself and said:\r\n\r\n“_Maza an Ma Gong._”\r\n\r\nHe repeated the name after her, and pointed to the scroll she had\r\nwritten. She was pronouncing and pointing out each word when she was\r\nsuddenly crowded out as before by the appearance of P’an-ku and his\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nThe rotund and imperious P’an-ku read the message on the placard, then\r\nturned to the old man who stood beside him and smiled. Ted thought there\r\nwas a trace of a sneer in his smile. He ordered the old fellow to write\r\nhis reply, then turned and stalked majestically out of the range of\r\nvision. The old man held his message aloft for a few moments as if fully\r\naware that it was being recorded. Then he let his arm fall to his side,\r\nand the disc became blank.\r\n\r\nAfter supplying Dr. Fang with a set of photo-records of the messages,\r\nand dispatching another to Dr. Wu, Ted and Roger went to the private\r\noffice of the former for a conference.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Ted, after he had his briar going, “that there’s\r\nsomething putrid in Denmark. Did you notice the expression of horror on\r\nthe faces of the girl and the graybearded man when they read our\r\nmessages?”\r\n\r\n“Queer, wasn’t it?” replied Roger. “Must have been something in that\r\nmessage that was quite a shock to them. Wonder what it could have been.”\r\n\r\n“That’s precisely what I’ve been wondering—and it has led to a rather\r\nunpleasant thought. I wouldn’t mention it to anyone in the world but\r\nyou—not at present, anyhow—but it looks to me as if Dr. Wu may have\r\ndouble crossed us.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By writing a message of his own in the place of the one we asked him to\r\ntranslate for us.”\r\n\r\n“But what message of his own could he possibly have written?”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Ted, “is what I propose to try to find out just as soon as\r\nI possibly can. Just before we came up here I sent Bevans to Peiping in\r\nthe 800. He has orders to bring Professor Ederson back with him. We can\r\nbank on the professor to shoot square, and it’s quite possible that he\r\ncan check up on Wu’s message. At any rate, he’s probably the best versed\r\nwhite man in the world on the ancient writings of China and Tibet. Has\r\nmade a life-time study of them, I’m told.”\r\n\r\n“What about the learned Manchu, Dr. Fang?”\r\n\r\n“I think he was bluffing. If there’s mischief afoot, you can safely bet\r\nhe’s in on it, and knows how to play his part. He’s not so ignorant as\r\nhe pretends to be. Did you notice the expression on the face of the man\r\nin the golden armor? He smiled when he read our message, but the smile\r\nwas half a sneer.”\r\n\r\n“It was a mean smile, all right,” agreed Roger. “More like the snarl of\r\nan animal than the smile of a human being.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather have a person frown at me than smile that way,” said Ted.\r\n\r\nShortly after midnight a radiogram from Professor Fowler of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory arrived. He stated that he had seen five flashes on the\r\nmoon, coming from the region of the lunar crater, Stadius.\r\n\r\nIn the wee, small hours of the morning, Chicago was shaken by a terrific\r\ndetonation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VI. TREACHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after five o’clock when all the reports were in. Five\r\nprojectiles, larger than the former, and each destructive over a fifty\r\nmile radius, had struck the earth. The one which had so shaken Chicago\r\nhad struck at Rochelle, Illinois, completely destroying that city and\r\nspreading death and destruction up to the very suburbs of Chicago on one\r\nside and across the Mississippi into Iowa on the other.\r\n\r\nThe second projectile had demolished Cincinnati, Covington and\r\nsurrounding cities and hamlets with terrific loss of life. The third had\r\nstruck squarely in the center of Birmingham, England, destroying,\r\nkilling and maiming as far as Stafford, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Worcester\r\nand Rugby. The fourth, alighting in the harbor of Tunis, had sunk and\r\ndestroyed shipping, and created a tidal wave which had drowned many\r\npeople on shore. The fifth had laid waste to Quito, Ecuador and the\r\nsurrounding territory.\r\n\r\nAt five thirty, a report from Peiping stated that Khobr and nearby towns\r\nhad been destroyed or suffered terrific casualties from a sixth\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nLeaving Roger in charge, Ted promptly took a super-electroplane to\r\nWashington. While he was closeted that morning in conference with the\r\nPresident, fifty aerial fleets of army engineers left the Capital,\r\nflying in various directions, but with their destinations kept secret.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, representatives of various nations were called into the\r\nconference. Each representative, as he left the President’s office, was\r\nseen to speed away in a fast electroplane. Not one representative of a\r\nMongoloid Asiatic nation was asked into conference.\r\n\r\nAfter a busy day, Ted rushed back to his office where he found Roger up\r\nto his eyebrows in work, endeavoring to placate his wife for his\r\ntardiness to dinner, over his wrist radiophone.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Leah,” he was saying. “I simply can’t get away now. I’m trying\r\nto manage things alone, you know, and—hello! Ted’s here now. Be home,\r\ntoot sweet, honey. Bye bye.”\r\n\r\n“You married men—” began Ted.\r\n\r\n“Have got it all over you single ones in many ways,” interrupted Roger.\r\n“Get things going in Washington?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty well. I’ve organized our defense force, and have warned every\r\nnation that we have reason to believe is friendly. Before the moon gets\r\ninto favorable firing position again we’ll have enough powerful magnetic\r\npoles set up to take care of the United States, and if the other\r\ncountries keep on their toes they’ll be ready, too.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know the poles will work?”\r\n\r\n“Fragments of the lunar projectiles show that they contain large\r\nquantities of steel. We’ve divided the country into fifty zones, in each\r\nof which a powerful electro-magnet will be erected. Having erected these\r\nin the least populated districts of each zone, and warned the\r\ninhabitants to leave the danger area, our sole remaining problem is to\r\nmake them powerful enough to attract the projectiles, which we can\r\neasily do with the resources at our command. Our power plants will be\r\nfar enough from the magnetic poles to keep them from injury, and as soon\r\nas one pole is destroyed another can be quickly erected.”\r\n\r\n“You sure have some head on you, Ted. What about the Mongoloid Asiatics?\r\nFind out anything?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing definite. For the present we’re sitting tight and saying\r\nnothing. Professor Ederson will, no doubt, be able to check up on them.\r\nIf they haven’t double crossed us there will still be plenty of time to\r\nexplain my plan of defense to them.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Ederson did not arrive until late the following afternoon.\r\nRoger met him on the roof, and immediately escorted him to Ted’s private\r\noffice. He was a little, wizened man, with a grizzled Van Dyke, a thin,\r\naquiline nose, and huge, thick-lensed glasses which gave him an owl-like\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been studying the translation of Dr. Wu while Bevans, your\r\nadmirable pilot, conducted me here,” said the professor when greetings\r\nwere over. “It seems to me to be quite accurate.”\r\n\r\n“What about the message he wrote for me?” asked Ted.\r\n\r\n“I cannot, for the life of me, understand why you sent so belligerent a\r\nmessage,” replied the professor.\r\n\r\n“Belligerent? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nTed quickly produced an English copy of the message which he has asked\r\nDr. Wu to translate into the Lunite language for him.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the professor, scanning it in surprise, “this is nothing\r\nlike the message I have translated.”\r\n\r\n“Let me have your translation,” requested Ted.\r\n\r\nThe professor produced a sheaf of papers from his inside coat pocket,\r\nselected one, and handed it to Ted.\r\n\r\nThe latter read it aloud:\r\n\r\n  _To the Imperial Government of P’an-ku_:\r\n\r\n  _Greeting_:\r\n\r\n  The Associated Governments of the Earth have found cause for much\r\n  mirth in the note of the Imperial Government of P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n  It is the intention of the Associated Governments of the Earth to\r\n  quickly and completely destroy Ma Gong (The Moon) if its inhabitants\r\n  refuse to submit to the viceroys which the Associated Governments of\r\n  the Earth are preparing to send to rule over them.\r\n\r\n  The Imperial Government of P’an-ku has complained of the destruction\r\n  of Ur. This is only a minute sample of the destruction which will be\r\n  wrought on Ma Gong if there are any further acts of hostility on the\r\n  part of the Imperial Government of P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“Whew!” exclaimed Roger. “No wonder the girl and the old man looked\r\nhorrified.”\r\n\r\n“And it’s no wonder the imperious and belligerent P’an-ku sneered,” said\r\nTed. “Looks as if we’re in for it, sure enough, now.”\r\n\r\n“What about having Professor Ederson fix up a new note, right away,\r\nexplaining everything and trying to patch things up?” asked Roger.\r\n\r\n“We’ll try it,” replied Ted, “but I can’t bring myself to feel very\r\nsanguine as to the result.”\r\n\r\n“Before we draft the note,” said the professor, “there are two things I\r\nshould like to bring to your attention. First, a gigantic radio station\r\nhas been set up in Peiping. Second, despite the fact that China reported\r\nthe destruction of Khobr and nearby towns, I flew over Khobr and\r\nvicinity and could see no sign that there had been a disturbance there\r\nof any kind.”\r\n\r\n“Professor Fowler only saw five flashes, all of which were accounted\r\nfor,” said Ted. “The destruction of Khobr would have meant a sixth\r\nprojectile, which left the moon without a telltale flash. As always, two\r\nand two continue to make four. There can only be one reason why Dr. Wu\r\nmiswrote our pacific message—only one reason why the government of China\r\nlied about Khobr.”\r\n\r\n“And the reason?” asked the professor.\r\n\r\n“A secret alliance projected—perhaps even perfected by now—between the\r\nChinese royalists and the Imperial Government of P’an-ku.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely my theory,” said Professor Ederson. “The Chinese and racially\r\nallied peoples revere their ancestors to the point of actual worship.\r\nSmall wonder, then, if they should have reverence for the living\r\nrepresentative of their supposed first earthly ancestor, P’an-ku, and\r\ncast their lot with him and his people. Why man, the thing was\r\ninevitable.”\r\n\r\n“And terrible to contemplate,” said Ted, dejectedly. “A united world\r\ncould have fought off a dozen moons, but a divided world will have a\r\nslim chance. And the whole damnable affair is my fault.”\r\n\r\n“Millions of sparks fall harmlessly, but here and there one starts a\r\nhuge conflagration,” said the professor. “No earthly being could have\r\nforeseen the far-reaching effect of your apparently harmless spark, and\r\nyou certainly are not morally responsible.”\r\n\r\n“I hold myself so,” said Ted, “and it would be a small thing to me,\r\ncould I but forfeit my own life to end the conflict. I have a plan, but\r\nI may not speak of it yet.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you are not contemplating any foolhardy personal risks,” said\r\nthe professor. “The world needs you more than any other living man, at\r\npresent. We have thousands of scientists, but only one Ted Dustin.”\r\n\r\n“Who has proven himself the greatest calamity yet born to the earth,”\r\nreplied Ted. “But let’s prepare that message.”\r\n\r\nA half hour elapsed before a message, satisfactory to all, had been\r\ndrafted for the Imperial Government of P’an-ku. It took the professor an\r\nhour more to put it in the language of the Lunites. Then the air was\r\ncleared, and the three men went aloft to the gigantic radio tower.\r\n\r\nWhile the professor held the message on a placard, Ted worked at the\r\ndials and Roger managed the recorder.\r\n\r\nTheir first efforts were rewarded by the faint sound of a woman’s voice\r\nand a dim vision of the beautiful girl seen on two previous occasions.\r\nAlmost as soon as it began to appear, the image was blotted from the\r\ndisc, and from then on until early morning, when the three tired men\r\nrelinquished their unsuccessful attempt, they were rewarded only by\r\nblackness and a faint rumbling sound which greatly resembled distant\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n“Looks as if P’an-ku had severed diplomatic relations,” said Roger,\r\nrising from his seat at the recorder and stretching his cramped limbs.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you are right,” replied the professor, leaning his placard\r\nagainst a chair.\r\n\r\n“We’ll try again, and keep on trying,” said Ted. “The Lunites should be\r\namenable to reason if we can get the message through.”\r\n\r\nTry they did, the following night, and each night thereafter for nearly\r\ntwo weeks. The results were only darkness, and the distant thunderous\r\nrumbling. Even the image of the girl had failed to appear for so much as\r\na fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nWhen the efforts of the last night had proved unavailing, Ted threw off\r\nthe switch and rose with a look of grim determination.\r\n\r\n“We must face the facts,” he said. “War is inevitable unless P’an-ku can\r\nbe reached and influenced by a specific message. It will take two more\r\nweeks at the very least, to complete our large interplanetary vehicle.\r\nBy that time the war will undoubtedly be in full progress.”\r\n\r\n“What do you propose to do about it?” asked the professor.\r\n\r\n“I will take the message in person,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\n“How?” chorused his two surprised companions in unison.\r\n\r\n“Come with me and I’ll show you, but you must preserve absolute\r\nsecrecy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         VII. PERILOUS JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nTed led Roger and the professor through a side door, and out onto the\r\nroof, which was illuminated by the silvery glory of the moon. A watchman\r\nchallenged them, then saluted respectfully as he recognized his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the hangars of Ted’s fleet of electroplanes, more\r\nwatchmen challenged and saluted.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, they came to a square shed of steel, the heavy metal door\r\nof which Ted unlocked with a key taken from his pocket. As his two\r\ncompanions entered he closed the door after them, then pressed a light\r\nswitch.\r\n\r\n“Here is my secret,” he said. “Isn’t she a little beauty?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll say she is!” exclaimed Roger, looking admiringly at a craft of\r\nsilver gray metal about sixteen feet in length, gracefully shaped, and\r\ndecked over like an Esquimauan kayak, but with a centrally located\r\nturret which projected above and below the hull. This turret was of\r\nglass braced with the same silver-gray metal which formed the hull, and\r\nwithin it could be seen a bewildering array of buttons and levers which\r\nfronted a revolving upholstered seat. Projecting from the upper half of\r\nthe turret, pointing fore, aft, and to each side, were four tubes, each\r\nof which ended in a glass lens. The lower turret was similarly equipped.\r\nThe hull itself was provided with four searchlights, set to sweep in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nTed opened a heavily-gasketed door in the side of the upper turret, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Look her over if you want to, while I put on my driving suit.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been keeping something from me, Ted,” said Roger reproachfully\r\nwhile he and the professor admired the snug interior of the craft.\r\n\r\nThe young inventor laughed, as he opened a drawer and produced therefrom\r\na costume and helmet greatly resembling those worn by deep sea divers.\r\n\r\n“Wanted to surprise you,” he said, stepping into the one-piece suit and\r\nscrewing down the clamps which closed the front. “Besides, you had too\r\nmuch on your mind as it was.”\r\n\r\n“But what is the purpose of the thing?” asked the professor, still\r\npeering into the interior. “You don’t mean to tell me this craft will\r\nfly without planes, rudder or propeller.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” replied Ted, “although if it does, this will be its maiden\r\nflight.”\r\n\r\n“But how?” persisted the professor.\r\n\r\n“Atomotor,” said Ted, shortly, attaching his helmet to an affair which\r\nslightly resembled a knapsack. “It will fly in the same manner as my\r\nprojectile flew to the moon, but more slowly, because I don’t dare give\r\nit the terrific start imparted to my projectile.”\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” smiled Roger. “It would be burned to a cinder. How far are you\r\ngoing tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know exactly,” replied Ted, “but if luck is with me I hope to\r\nland on the moon before the middle of this week.”\r\n\r\n“What!” gasped Roger. “You expect to go to the moon alone and unarmed?”\r\n\r\n“Alone,” grinned Ted, “but not unarmed.” He had donned the helmet and\r\nopened a glass slide in front for conversational purposes. After\r\nadjusting the straps of the thing which resembled a knapsack, he took a\r\nbelt from the drawer and buckled it about his waist. Attached to the\r\nbelt were two holsters from which pistol-like handles projected.\r\n\r\n“Do you expect to defend yourself against super-intelligences as seem to\r\nexist on the moon, with a couple of pistols?” asked the professor.\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” replied Ted. “The things you think are pistols are not pistols\r\nat all, but pistol degravitors. They operate on the same principle as\r\nthe eight degravitors on my craft, but on a smaller scale.”\r\n\r\n“You mean those eight tubes sticking out of the turret?” asked Roger.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\n“What deadly substance do they shoot?”\r\n\r\n“They don’t shoot,” Ted answered with a smile. “They radiate—and when\r\ntheir rays strike matter it disintegrates.”\r\n\r\n“But how—”\r\n\r\n“I can only take a minute to explain, as time is pressing,” replied Ted,\r\n“but I’ll give you a demonstration very shortly. All matter is composed\r\nof atoms which are, in turn, composed of protons and electrons, always\r\nin motion, the latter whirling around the former as the planets whirl\r\naround the sun. The force, therefore, which holds them in their orbits\r\nis analogous to the force of gravity, hence I have applied the word\r\nuntil a better one can be found. When I press the firing button of the\r\ndegravitor, it immediately releases two sets of invisible rays, cathode\r\nand anode, both of which when properly pointed, strike the same object\r\nat the same time, but at slightly different angles. The positively\r\ncharged protons are instantly torn from their atoms by the cathode rays,\r\nwhile the negatively charged electrons are taken up by the anode rays.\r\nAs the two types of rays diverge, they are torn apart, and the matter\r\nwhich they form immediately disintegrates and disappears.”\r\n\r\n“Remarkable!” exclaimed the professor.\r\n\r\n“Good head!” said Roger. “But how on earth did you manage to make all\r\nthese things without my knowing it?”\r\n\r\n“Easily,” replied Ted. “I had the parts made separately in the shop and\r\nassembled them here, myself. The hull is supposed to be the fuselage of\r\na new type of electroplane, to which the wings have not yet been\r\nattached. The atomotor is assumed to be a model. I fitted it into the\r\nhull, myself. As for the degravitors, I had the parts made, assembled\r\nthem, and fitted the larger ones into the turret, working nights in this\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“I might add that I have put through an order for ten thousand of the\r\nsmall and a hundred thousand of the large degravitors. Directions for\r\nassembling and firing them are in the safe, and you, Roger, will see to\r\nit that our soldiers and combat planes are equipped with them as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“But enough of explanations. I must go. If I do not return, you, Roger,\r\nwill know where to find all of my plans, including those for the\r\ndegravitors. Use them, and arrange for the defense as best you can,\r\nwithout me.”\r\n\r\nHe entered the turret and switched on a tiny, inner light.\r\n\r\n“I have your valuable translations, professor,” said Ted, “and hope that\r\nI may be able to use them to advantage. Goodbye.”\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, and good luck,” echoed both men as he closed the front of his\r\nhelmet and slammed and fastened the door of the turret.\r\n\r\nThey watched him as he slowly elevated the upper forward degravitor.\r\nWhen he pressed the button no visible rays shot forth, but in the metal\r\nroof toward which it was aimed there suddenly appeared a clean cut hole\r\nwhich was rapidly widened by circumscribing it with the degravitor rays.\r\nThe metal did not glow as if burned away, but simply disappeared with a\r\nquick, scintillating flash wherever the rays touched it.\r\n\r\nWhen the hole had been enlarged sufficiently, Ted waved a last adieu.\r\nThen his craft rose gracefully, hung for a moment at a point about a\r\nthousand feet above the roof, and disappeared with a burst of terrific\r\nspeed, traveling in a direction which might be reckoned about 80 degrees\r\nto the east of the moon in the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VIII. DEATH RAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nA week elapsed, after the departure of the young inventor, with no word\r\nfrom Ted. During this time, Roger, busy with the duties of the chief\r\nexecutive, ate and slept in the office of his employer.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ederson had meanwhile tried nightly to get into communication\r\nwith the Lunites, but without success.\r\n\r\nIt was on this, the seventh night, that a terrific storm struck Chicago.\r\nUnable to sleep because of the howling wind and terrific peals of\r\nthunder, Roger switched on the lights and was about to step to the\r\nwindow when his name was called from the disc of the radiovisiphone.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sanders.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the instrument and saw the face of the night operator.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“The President of the United States is calling Mr. Dustin. What shall I\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dustin is not in,” said Roger, who had shared the secret of his\r\nemployer’s absence only with Professor Ederson. “Let me talk to him.”\r\n\r\nIn an instant the face of President Whitmore appeared on the disc. To\r\nhis intense surprise, Roger noticed that he wore a fur cap and a great\r\nfur coat with the collar turned up. That he was in an intensely cold\r\nplace was indicated by the visibility of his breath as he spoke and\r\nexhaled.\r\n\r\n“Where is Mr. Dustin?” were his first words on seeing Roger instead of\r\nthe man he had called.\r\n\r\n“He is not here,” replied Roger. “As his assistant, can I be of service\r\nto you?”\r\n\r\n“You have not answered my question,” persisted the President. “_Where_\r\nis Mr. Dustin?”\r\n\r\n“I—I promised not to tell,” answered Roger. “He left here a week ago in\r\nthe interests of our country and our allies.”\r\n\r\nThe President frowned.\r\n\r\n“You forget, Mr. Sanders,” he said, “that this is a war emergency, that\r\nthe country is on a military basis, and that I am Mr. Dustin’s superior\r\nofficer as well as yours. I demand to know where he is.”\r\n\r\nRoger was nonplussed. He had told everyone that Ted had gone away on\r\nbusiness for the country, leaving them to assume what they pleased in\r\nthe matter. People had, of course, assumed that he had gone to some\r\nother city, and would be back shortly. But the President was within his\r\nrights in demanding to know where he was. Ted, himself, would not have\r\nhad the right to refuse this demand.\r\n\r\n“He left for the moon a week ago,” said Roger, “and I have heard nothing\r\nfrom him since.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\nThe President appeared dumfounded.\r\n\r\n“How did he go? Who went with him?”\r\n\r\n“He went alone in a small interplanetary vehicle of his own invention,\r\nknowing that the war would be in full swing before his larger vehicle\r\ncould be completed.”\r\n\r\n“Well I’ll be damned!” exploded the President. “This is a pretty how\r\nd’ye do. Gone just when we need him most.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” answered Roger, “but he hoped to be able to stop the war by\r\nthis trip. If there’s anything I can do—”\r\n\r\n“Maybe there is,” said the President, with forced calmness. “Perhaps you\r\ncan explain some things that I had hoped he could explain. For instance,\r\nwhat is the cause of this intensely cold weather in the middle of the\r\nsummer, and why does the moonlight appear green?”\r\n\r\n“We can’t see the moon from here,” replied Roger, “and it’s not cold.\r\nThere is a terrific storm raging, plenty of lightning, rain and wind,\r\nbut no cold.”\r\n\r\n“A devastating cold wave has spread over this part of the country,\r\naffecting Washington and Baltimore, and extending as far south as\r\nRichmond,” said the President. “The Potomac is frozen solid, and\r\nalthough we have our heating plants going to the utmost capacity, it is\r\nimpossible to keep warm. Thousands of people, caught unexpectedly, have\r\nperished from the intense cold. My thermometer here in the White House\r\nregisters 10° above zero. Outside, I am told the thermometers have\r\ndropped under 60° below zero, Fahrenheit.”\r\n\r\n“And you say the moon looks green?”\r\n\r\n“As green as grass. The country is bathed in a weird, green light at\r\nthis moment.”\r\n\r\n“Must be some connection,” mused Roger, “I mean between the green light\r\nand the intense cold localized around Washington. Wish Mr. Dustin were\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“But he isn’t,” snapped the President, “so see what _you_ can find out,\r\nand report back, either by radiovisiphone or in person at your earliest\r\nconvenience. Off!”\r\n\r\nAs the face of the President disappeared from the disc, Roger slumped\r\ndown in his chair and lighted a cigarette. What should he do? What could\r\nhe do?\r\n\r\nThere was a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he said, listlessly.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ederson entered.\r\n\r\n“No use to try to use the radio tonight,” he said. “With the unknown\r\ninterference we have been getting lately and this storm, it would be\r\nuseless to try to communicate with the moon. I had our operator notify\r\nall stations that we wouldn’t attempt it tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Hear about the cold snap in the east?” asked Roger.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Got it on the small set just before I came down. Terrible thing,\r\nisn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“And about the green moonlight?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Some new wrinkle of the Lunites, I fancy. They are clever and\r\nresourceful and, for all we know, a thousand years ahead of us in\r\nscientific knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose it is?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. An observation might be made from here, seeing that this\r\npart of the country is unaffected, if it were not for the raging storm.\r\nBut it would be suicidal to go up in an electroplane just now.”\r\n\r\n“If I thought there were anything to be learned, I’d go up,” said Roger,\r\n“danger or no danger.”\r\n\r\n“I mentioned it only as a possibility,” replied the professor. “The\r\nprobability is, that if you did learn anything, it would be of no\r\nmaterial value, even if you were to be so extremely fortunate as to get\r\nback alive with it.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” replied Roger, “I’m going up, just on the strength of\r\nthat possibility.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be an utter fool,” warned the professor, but Roger was already\r\ncalling Bevans.\r\n\r\n“Have the Blettendorf 800 ready in five minutes,” he said. “I’ll be up\r\nin a jiffy.”\r\n\r\nHe dressed rapidly while the professor remonstrated with him.\r\n\r\n“No use,” said Roger, “I’m going.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied the professor. “If you must go I’ll go with you.\r\nPerhaps the two of us can bring back some information of value—if we get\r\nback.”\r\n\r\nThey took the elevator to the top, stepped out on the roof, and battled\r\ntheir way through the driving rain, in which there was beginning to be a\r\nhint of sleet, to the electroplane. Eight men held it, just outside the\r\nhangar, while Bevans, in the pilot’s seat, tested the motor.\r\n\r\nThe two men entered and took their seats. Then Roger gave the order to\r\nascend. Came a roar from the helicopter blades, and they were off.\r\n\r\nAs they rose above the skyscrapers of Chicago, their craft tossing and\r\ncareening like a leaf in a gale, Roger took two parcels from beneath the\r\nseat, one of which he handed to the professor.\r\n\r\n“Folding parachutes,” he said. “Bevans is wearing one. Watch how I strap\r\nmine on, and do likewise. We may need them.”\r\n\r\nThe wind swept them out over Lake Michigan—then they plunged into a\r\nswirling, blinding snowstorm, and everything below, even the powerful\r\nguide-lights of Chicago’s great landing fields, vanished.\r\n\r\nWith propeller and helicopter blades roaring, Bevans drove the plane\r\nhigher and higher, until they at length emerged above the seething,\r\nmoon-silvered clouds.\r\n\r\n“No green moonlight here,” said the professor.\r\n\r\n“But look—look to the southeast!” exclaimed Roger.\r\n\r\nThe professor looked, and saw a green band of light, wide at the bottom,\r\nbut narrowing as it extended upward straight toward the gibbous moon.\r\n\r\n“The moon looks green from Washington,” said the professor, “because the\r\ninhabitants had to look through the green lights to see it.”\r\n\r\nRoger shouted an order through the speaking tube.\r\n\r\n“Hover.”\r\n\r\nAs the big plane, now riding in comparatively calm air, hung smoothly\r\nsuspended by its helicopter blades, he turned a pair of powerful\r\nbinoculars on the moon. He focused them, looked for a moment longer,\r\nthen handed them to the professor.\r\n\r\n“It’s coming from the ring-mountain, Copernicus,” he said. “Looks as if\r\na beam from an enormous green searchlight were coming directly from the\r\ncenter of the crater.”\r\n\r\n“So it is,” said the professor, after a careful scrutiny. “From the very\r\ncenter of the crater.”\r\n\r\nThen, before he had lowered the glasses, the green light winked out. So\r\nsudden was the transformation, and so calm and natural did the moon\r\nappear, that it seemed to both observers that the thing had not really\r\nbeen—that it was a figment of their imaginations.\r\n\r\nCame a call from Bevans:\r\n\r\n“Three strange craft on the starboard quarter, sir. They seem to be\r\ncoming this way.”\r\n\r\nThe professor trained the binoculars in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n“My word, what odd looking craft,” he exclaimed. “They are globular in\r\nform—globes, to each of which two whirling discs are attached.”\r\n\r\n“An International Patrol Plane is coming from the port quarter,” called\r\nBevans. “It’s signaling the three strange craft, but they do not\r\nrespond. They are running without lights.”\r\n\r\n“Ascend,” called Roger, “and turn off all lights.”\r\n\r\nThere was an answering roar as the Blettendorf shot upward.\r\n\r\n“Too late for that,” said the professor. “We must have been seen.”\r\n\r\nAs the two men watched the one sided aerial parley below, they saw two\r\nmore Patrol Planes emerge from the upper cloud stratum and take places\r\nbehind the first.\r\n\r\n“That makes the numbers even, at least,” said Roger.\r\n\r\nThe two squadrons drew together without sign or signal from the strange\r\ncraft, until the two leaders were within two thousand feet of each\r\nother. Then a narrow green ray suddenly shot out from the foremost\r\nglobe, striking the first patrol plane. For a moment the plane seemed to\r\nshrink—to draw together as if crushed in from all sides. Then it\r\ncrumbled asunder, and the pieces fell into the swirling clouds beneath.\r\n\r\nThe forward turret guns of the two remaining planes immediately went\r\ninto action, concentrating their fire on the foremost globe, but with no\r\napparent effect. Green rays shot out from the two other globes\r\nsimultaneously, and the planes shared the fate of their leader.\r\n\r\nThen a green ray from the first globe sailed upward.\r\n\r\n“Jump!” shouted Roger. “It’s our only chance. They’ll find us in a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nThe professor tore the door open and jumped first. His parachute opened\r\njust as Roger leaped after him followed by Bevans.\r\n\r\nRoger could not see upward because of the parachute spread above him,\r\nbut fragments of the shattered Blettendorf began falling around him\r\nbefore he had dropped far, and he was thankful that they had leaped in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLooking downward to see how it fared with the professor, he saw to his\r\nhorror that the linguist was falling directly onto one of the globes.\r\n\r\nThen he shot past the same globe himself, heard the hum of its rapidly\r\nwhirling discs, and dropped into the enveloping grayness of the raging\r\nstorm clouds beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IX. VICIOUS PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the metal shed which had housed his one-man vehicle, Ted\r\nDustin hovered for a moment to get his bearings—then shot away from the\r\nearth at such speed that his exterior thermometer registered a terrific\r\nheat from the shell of his craft before five seconds had elapsed. Forced\r\nto slacken his speed because of the danger of crippling his machine, he\r\nproceeded at a more leisurely pace until his instruments told him he was\r\nentirely out of the earth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOnce assured of this, he set his meteoroid detector—an extremely\r\nsensitive magnetic instrument which registered the approach of all\r\nmeteoric masses, automatically repelling the smaller ones by blasts from\r\nthe exhaust of the atomotor, and driving the craft away from those of\r\ngreater mass. He next set his automatic course corrector, which was\r\ndesigned to throw the machine back on its course after each forced\r\ndeviation. Then he set the motor for full speed ahead.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise and satisfaction he found, on glancing at the magnetic\r\nspeedometer, that the little untested motor was driving the craft almost\r\ntwice as fast as he had anticipated. He would thus, barring accidents,\r\nbe able to reach the moon in a day and a half instead of the three days\r\nhe had previously allowed himself for the undertaking. This necessitated\r\nthe setting of a new course, as he would otherwise have arrived at the\r\nmoon’s path just a day and a half ahead of that satellite.\r\n\r\nHaving made his calculations and adjusted his instruments accordingly,\r\nhe opened his visor, swallowed a concentrated food pellet, drank a cup\r\nof hot coffee from the thermos tank, and lighted his black briar.\r\nFinding the cabin uncomfortably cold with his visor open, he drew up an\r\nextra set of glass panels all around and turned on his atomic heater.\r\nThen he studied the translations of the professor, hoping that he might\r\nthus learn enough of the Lunite writing to form a basis for intelligent\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nWhen the first hour had elapsed he looked back at the earth, which\r\nappeared as an enormous, semi-luminous globe set in a black sky, its\r\nseas and continents faintly defined by the light of the full moon. The\r\ndisc of the sun remained hidden behind the earth, but other heavenly\r\nbodies were far brighter in appearance, shining from this black sky,\r\nthan he had ever seen them appear from on earth.\r\n\r\nAs the hours passed and the apparent size of the earth grew less while\r\nthat of the moon grew correspondingly greater, he was surprised at not\r\nhaving encountered a single meteor. Presently, after about twelve hours\r\nof travel, one caused the craft to swerve, and he noticed with\r\nsatisfaction that the automatic course corrector functioned perfectly.\r\n\r\nHe swallowed another food pellet, sipped his coffee, and tried to sleep,\r\nbut despite the fact that he had trained himself to take rest or go\r\nwithout it as the occasion required, he found sleep out of the question.\r\nThe excitement of his thrilling race with the earth’s satellite was too\r\nmuch for that. He could scarcely bear to close his eyes for a moment,\r\nfor looking and wondering.\r\n\r\nBefore he realized it, twenty-four hours had slipped by. The shrinking\r\nshape of the earth was now on his left—the silver disc of the moon, with\r\ncraters, hills and valleys, was now plainly visible to the naked eye, on\r\nhis right. He was traveling with his keel in the plane of the ecliptic.\r\nAs he progressed, the prow leaned more and more toward the moon’s north\r\npole.\r\n\r\nThe last twelve hours were packed with wonders, thrills, and dangers.\r\nPreviously he had encountered only a relatively few meteoroids. Now, he\r\nfound they traveled in swarms in and near the neutral gravity point\r\nbetween moon and earth. His craft swerved this way and that—dropped—or\r\nshot suddenly upward, as huge masses of meteoric matter hurtled\r\ndangerously near it. He caught fleeting glimpses of these desultory\r\ntravelers, some of them almost perfectly spherical, others jagged lumps\r\nof rock and metal—grim remnants of some planetary or planetoidal tragedy\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nWith the neutral gravity point well past and the moon directly beneath\r\nhis keel, the danger from meteoroids was considerably lessened. The\r\ndelays were more than compensated for by the increasing pull of the moon\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nHis goal almost realized, Ted’s next problem was to decide where to\r\nland. Copernicus, plainly visible to the north east with its brilliant\r\nyellow ray system, and Tycho, to the south, with its still more dazzling\r\nwhite rays branching out in all directions, were the two most\r\nconspicuous objects on the lunar landscape.\r\n\r\nAlthough his purpose was to find the belligerent ruler, P’an-ku, his\r\nonly hint as to his whereabouts was the probability that the crater,\r\nHipparchus, was somewhere within the limits of that worth’s empire,\r\nwhich might be as extensive as the moon itself, or confined to a\r\nrelatively small area. The thing to do, he decided, was to land at\r\nHipparchus and investigate.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the great ring-mountain, Ted saw no signs of life. The\r\ndamage wrought by his projectile, however, was evident—for in the center\r\nof the huge, enclosed plain, gaped a jagged black hole fully five miles\r\nin diameter, while the interior of the crater was strewn with jagged\r\nrock debris, some of the larger fragments the size of a terrestrial city\r\nblock. Of the city of Ur, mentioned in the radio message, he saw no sign\r\nwhatever. Greatly puzzled, he slowly circled the crater, then crossed\r\nthe rim and set out in a widening spiral, flying only a few thousand\r\nfeet above the ground, looking for some sign of a human being or\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nAlthough there had been no sign of vegetation in the enormous crater\r\nwhich had been laid waste by his projectile, Ted now began to notice\r\nsigns of lunar forests and meadows. Flying slowly at an altitude of two\r\nhundred feet, he passed over level areas covered with velvety stretches\r\nof gray vegetation that resembled mosses and lichens, and over hills and\r\nvalleys clothed with forests of weird, grotesque growths.\r\n\r\nThere were fungi shaped like saucers, umbrellas, cones, spearheads, and\r\neven upraised hands, all rusty black in color. There were black stalks,\r\nfully fifty feet in height, topped by five-pointed purple stars, huge\r\ngray pear-shaped growths from which there curled sinuous branches that\r\nresembled the tentacles of cuttle fish, and black trees, some of which\r\nwere a hundred feet in height, with branches that unrolled like the\r\nleaves of sword-ferns.\r\n\r\nDisposed to view some of these wonders at closer range, Ted lowered his\r\ncraft to the ground. A glance at his exterior thermometer showed the\r\noutside temperature to be 210° above zero, Fahrenheit, almost the\r\nboiling point of water at sea level on earth! He accordingly closed his\r\nvisor and turned on the valve of his insulated compressed air tank\r\nbefore opening the door of his turret. Slamming this quickly behind him,\r\nhe stepped down from his craft, sinking ankle deep in the soft, gray\r\nmoss that coated the forest floor.\r\n\r\nAs the suit he wore protected him from either extreme heat or cold he\r\nwas able to maintain a normal body temperature, but the comparatively\r\nslight gravitational pull of the earth’s satellite gave him an uncanny\r\nfreedom of motion. His first incautious step shot him ten feet in the\r\nair and landed him, with startling suddenness, face downward in a tangle\r\nof black creepers fully twenty feet from where he had started.\r\nInstinctively he scrambled erect and was as suddenly precipitated on his\r\nback at a distance of fifteen feet in the opposite direction. This time\r\nhe arose slowly, stepped forward with great care, and found himself able\r\nto progress after a somewhat jerky fashion.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, to a degree, mastered the art of walking on the moon, he\r\ntook the opportunity to observe the queer vegetation around him. To his\r\nintense surprise, he saw that it was growing _visibly_! Although the\r\nrates of growth varied in different plants, he could see that all were\r\nswelling and elongating with amazing rapidity. Watching an umbrella\r\nshaped fungus which was on a level with his eyes, he calculated that it\r\nwas growing taller at the rate of a foot an hour! The black, fern-like\r\nbranches of a great tree unrolled and enlarged before his eyes. Spore\r\npods beneath the leaves, swelled and burst, scattering tiny dust-like\r\nparticles which floated about, or settled on the surrounding vegetation,\r\nrocks and soil. A tall, black and gray fungus opened its gills,\r\nreleasing a cloud of silver spores that glittered in the sunlight like\r\nmica dust.\r\n\r\nTed was attracted by the movements of the tentacles of an octopus-like\r\nplant a short distance ahead of him, and walked toward it. They writhed\r\nand twisted like the snakey locks of a Medusa, yet the roots which held\r\nthe pear-shaped trunk showed the vegetable nature of the monstrosity.\r\nPrompted by a rash curiosity, he had no sooner arrived beside the\r\ngrotesque anomaly than he grasped one of the slithering branches,\r\nexpecting, from its slimy appearance, to find it soft and yielding. To\r\nhis surprise and dismay it suddenly coiled around his forearm with a\r\ngrip as firm and unyielding as the loops of a steel cable. He was jerked\r\noff his feet, straight toward a black, horny lipped opening of\r\ntriangular shape, which yawned at the top of the pear-shaped body.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, he reached with his free hand for his pistol degravitor,\r\nbut too late. A score or more of tough, unyielding tentacles bound his\r\narms to his sides and circled his body with such force that his bones\r\nwould have been instantly crushed and his flesh reduced to pulp had it\r\nnot been for the metal plates of his protective armor. Even these\r\ncreaked, and seemed about to give way, as he was drawn, head downward,\r\ninto the yawning, spike-toothed opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              X. ABDUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he plunged into the awful death trap, Ted noticed that, for a moment,\r\nthe sun was darkened above him and there was a sound which resembled the\r\nwhistling of giant pinions. Then came the click of enormous teeth\r\nagainst the armor which covered his thighs, and blackness.\r\n\r\nThe powerful tentacles had released their hold on his arms and the upper\r\npart of his body, but their place was instantly supplanted by the walls\r\nof the huge, vegetable craw which exerted even greater pressure. He\r\nwondered if the digestive juices of the plant would be corrosive enough\r\nto quickly penetrate his protective suit, or if a long, lingering death\r\nawaited him—a death which, even though the suit held, was bound to come\r\nas soon as his supply of air gave out.\r\n\r\nHanging there in stygian solitude, unable to move a finger, Ted was\r\nsuddenly startled at sight of a brilliant ray of red light which cut the\r\ndarkness near his face. It blinded him temporarily, but when he could\r\nuse his eyes once more he was astonished to see that the lower wall of\r\nhis vegetable tomb had practically disappeared, while the bright, red\r\nray, flashing intermittently, consumed the blackened edges still further\r\nwith puffs of smoke and flame.\r\n\r\nHere, he judged, was some human agency. Here was hope of rescue, for the\r\nred ray, thus far, had not touched him. He could now move his head and\r\nshoulders, but dared not do so for fear of intercepting the red ray with\r\ndisastrous results.\r\n\r\nThe ray ate its way slowly upward beside one of his arms. It was free. A\r\nmoment, and the other was loosed. Then the jaws relaxed their hold on\r\nhis thighs and he slid down into the charred, jelly-like remains of the\r\noval body, of which now only half the wall was standing. Two arms were\r\nslipped beneath his own, helping him to rise. Then he turned and faced\r\nhis rescuer.\r\n\r\nPrepared as he was for almost any sight, Ted gasped in amazement when he\r\nbeheld the person who had saved his life, for standing before him in a\r\nsuit of soft, clinging white fur resembling astrachan, her head encased\r\nin a helmet of bell-shaped glass, was the gloriously beautiful girl he\r\nhad seen in the disc of the radiovisiphone—the girl who had called\r\nherself “_Maza an Ma Gong_.” In her right hand was a short, tubular\r\ninstrument which greatly resembled a flash-light, and which he judged\r\nwas the weapon that had compassed his freedom.\r\n\r\nAs he could not speak to her he was trying to think of a way to express\r\nhis gratitude for his unexpected rescue while she smiled encouragingly,\r\nwhen he suddenly noticed a most fearful creature behind her. It\r\nresembled nothing living that he had ever seen or heard of, but was\r\nstrikingly like pictures he had seen of winged dragons—pictures he had\r\nalways previously imagined were due solely to the imagination of\r\nmedieval artists.\r\n\r\nBelieving the girl in dire peril, he whipped out both pistol degravitors\r\nand was about to destroy the beast when she struck down his weapons with\r\na look of alarm. Then, beckoning the thing with her hand she stood,\r\nunafraid, while the hideous creature stretched forth its scrawny, scaly\r\nneck and laid its ugly, armor-plated muzzle on her shoulder. She fondled\r\nit for a moment, scratching its horny nose while it closed its eyes and\r\nlaid back its short ears as if greatly pleased by these attentions. Then\r\nshe pushed the head away and turned once more to the amazed young\r\nscientist.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there beside him he noticed for the first time that what he\r\nhad taken for a plume, resembling an aigrette and protruding through the\r\ntop of her glass helmet was, in reality, a group of fine, metallic radio\r\nantennae. The small set which they operated was evidently attached just\r\nbeneath them—shaped like and no larger than his own wrist radiophone.\r\n\r\nHe wished that he had had the foresight to attach a similar contrivance\r\nto his own outfit, but since he had not, he found it necessary to resort\r\nto more primitive means for making himself heard.\r\n\r\nTaking the girl lightly by the shoulders, and thereby eliciting a look\r\nof startled surprise from her, he bent over and placed the glass of his\r\nhelmet against hers, an expedient which had been much in use among deep\r\nsea divers for making themselves intelligible to each other before the\r\nadvent of under water radio sets.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Maza an Ma Gong, for saving my life,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and replied:\r\n\r\n“_Di tcha-tsi_, Ted Dustin.”\r\n\r\nRecalling that “_tcha-tsi_” had something to do with a challenge to war,\r\nhe was somewhat puzzled, yet her attitude was quite peaceful. She\r\ncontinued to smile, and pointed toward the great hulking beast behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“_Nak-kar_,” she said, then pointed to herself and continued: “_Uma\r\nnak-kar_.”\r\n\r\nThe beast, at this moment, lowered its head to crop some moss, and let\r\nits wings, which had been folded across its back, droop slightly,\r\ndisplaying a most comfortable looking, highbacked seat strapped to its\r\nback. He judged, therefore, that the lady was telling him this was her\r\npalfrey—truly a most hideous one.\r\n\r\nHe led her to the spot where he had cached his interplanetary vehicle,\r\nwhile the great beast lumbered meekly after her, pointed to the craft\r\nand, with his helmet against hers, said:\r\n\r\n“Ship.” Then, pointing to himself: “My ship.”\r\n\r\nWhen she seemed not to understand, he said: “_Uma nak-kar_.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded understandingly, and both laughed.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and helped her into the small cab. Then stepping in\r\nhimself and sharing the revolving seat with her, he closed it and took\r\nher for a short ride above the trees—or the growths which answered for\r\ntrees on that weird landscape. She was as excited as a child, and\r\nclapped her hands with glee as they soared, and did several stunts,\r\nfinally landing as lightly as a feather.\r\n\r\nAs he helped her from the cab she stood on tiptoes so her helmet touched\r\nhis, and said: “_Um nak-kari na Ultu_.” As she spoke she pointed first\r\nto her mount, then toward the east. Then: “Ted Dustin _nak-kari na\r\nUltu_.”\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not know the meaning of all her words, he felt that he\r\nunderstood what she wanted. She seemed to take it for granted that he\r\ndid, for springing lightly into her saddle she struck the shoulder of\r\nthe great winged monster with her gloved palm, whereupon it ran,\r\nsprawling clumsily for fifty feet or so with wings outspread, then took\r\nto the air in which it seemed quite at home and flapped lazily eastward.\r\n\r\nHe hurried to his vehicle as he did not want to lose sight of her,\r\nentered, closed the door, and pressed the starter lever. To his surprise\r\nand alarm it did not respond. He pressed it again with the same negative\r\nresult. Then he remembered that he had carelessly left the door open for\r\nseveral minutes. The interior of the cab had thus been exposed to the\r\nterrific heat of the lunar surface. Unscrewing the top of the starter he\r\ninstantly saw the cause of his trouble. A connection, on which he had\r\nhastily used wax instead of solder and tape, had melted, breaking the\r\ncircuit. Several minutes elapsed before he could make the temporary\r\nrepair, using his temperature equalizer, meanwhile, to cool the cab.\r\n\r\nOnce more he pressed the starter, the atomotor responded, and he rose\r\nhigh in the air in order that he might quickly locate the girl and her\r\nstrange steed. He saw her instantly, about a mile east of his position.\r\nHer mount, he noticed, was flapping forward with greater speed than\r\nbefore, and high above it was a globe circled by two transverse belts,\r\nand to which were fastened two whirling discs, oppositely placed.\r\nSuddenly the globe swooped downward like a falcon on its prey.\r\n\r\nAs he darted forward he saw a tiny red ray shoot upward from the hand of\r\nthe girl. It struck one of the belts of the descending craft, and sparks\r\nand smoke flew out from the spot. Then a green ray shot out from the\r\nglobe, crossing the red ray. At the point where they crossed both rays\r\ndisappeared and the sparks and smoke from the craft ceased. Then another\r\ngreen ray flashed out from the globe, striking one of the wings of the\r\nmonster. The wing seemed to shrivel—then broke in pieces, and the beast\r\nfell, fluttering wildly with its remaining wing until it crashed with\r\nits rider into a tall forest of black-stemmed purple star plants.\r\n\r\nWhile he watched this unequal battle, which lasted only a few seconds,\r\nTed had been hurtling forward at terrific speed. Just as the girl fell,\r\nhe shot between her and the attacking globe, narrowly missing one of the\r\ngreen rays which still extended downward. Bringing his vehicle about, he\r\ntrained his forward degravitor on the descending globe and pressed the\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nAlthough no visible ray leaped out, the effect on the globe was readily\r\napparent, for it flashed where it had struck, then gaped wide as the\r\ndegravitor rays cut a tunnel through it.\r\n\r\nA green ray instantly flashed back in retaliation, striking Ted’s prow\r\nand breaking it into fragments. His craft then did a nose dive which he\r\nwas powerless to prevent, the forward exhaust pipes of the atomotor\r\nhaving been cut away. It buried itself in a cluster of the huge purple\r\nstar plants, so thick that they shut out the light of day.\r\n\r\nAs he had not strapped himself to his seat, Ted landed on his instrument\r\nboard when the craft struck, and laid there for several moments in a\r\nsemi-stupor, the breath knocked from his body. Presently, his breath\r\nreturning in short gasps, he found himself able to rise and force the\r\ndoor part way open. A black stem of one of the star-like plants blocked\r\nit, but he cut this away at the base with his pistol degravitor, waited\r\nuntil it crashed among its fellows, and then stepped out to freedom,\r\nthis time remembering to close the door after him.\r\n\r\nAfter leaping to the ground, he looked about him, trying to orient\r\nhimself in the darkness. Here and there faint glimmers of light showed\r\nbetween black trunks, but there was nothing to give him even a hint of\r\ndirections. He started for the light spot directly ahead of him as it\r\nlooked the brightest and probably issued from the largest open space.\r\n\r\nTreading noiselessly over the soft gray moss which grew between the\r\nclosely packed black trunks, he presently reached the clearing from\r\nwhich the light had issued. It was but a small opening in the forest,\r\nand it seemed to him that something more than chance had directed his\r\nfootsteps as he saw the girl standing at bay with her red ray projector\r\nin her hand before a short, round-bodied individual clad in yellow fur\r\nand wearing a glass and copper helmet shaped, at the top, like a pagoda.\r\n\r\nThe two were fencing, but not with blades of steel. They fenced with\r\nsomething infinitely more destructive, for as the girl sought to reach\r\nher antagonist with the red ray he warded it off with a green ray from a\r\nsmall projector which he held in his hand, and in turn, menaced her with\r\nhis weapon while she parried with the red ray.\r\n\r\nNear her lay the remains of her huge mount, now a mere hulk of flesh,\r\nwith head, neck and one wing gone.\r\n\r\nDrawing a pistol degravitor, Ted leveled it at the wielder of the green\r\nray and pulled the trigger. It was aimed at his head, which instantly\r\ndisappeared, the torso slipping to the ground with the green ray\r\nprojector still clasped in the lifeless hand. The ray struck the base of\r\na giant star-tree, which shriveled at the bottom, then crashed to the\r\nground. Another and another instantly shared its fate, falling only a\r\nsecond or two apart, but in these Ted was not interested.\r\n\r\nHe was about to disclose himself to the astonished girl when two long,\r\nlean arms clad in yellow fur suddenly reached out from the clump of fern\r\nlike growths behind her and jerked her backward. Her red ray winked\r\nonce, then went out, and Ted leaped forward to her assistance. He\r\nmanaged to follow by means of the trail of trampled and broken\r\nvegetation left by her abductors. Presently he reached another clearing\r\njust in time to see her hustled aboard the globe which had attacked her\r\nsome time before, by two yellow-clad Lunites.\r\n\r\nThe globe, he now saw, was of yellow metal. The two transverse belts he\r\nhad seen from a distance proved to be combination ladders and bridges. A\r\nman could walk around the one which happened to be horizontal, or climb\r\nthe one which happened to be vertical, using the supporting bars of the\r\nrailing for ladder rounds.\r\n\r\nProjecting from the two points where these belts crossed were shaft\r\nhousings, on the end of each of which were the discs he had previously\r\nnoticed. The faces of both discs resembled brightly polished mirrors,\r\none convex, the other concave.\r\n\r\nJust above and below the lines traced by the bridges were rows of\r\ndiamond-shaped, glassed openings which he judged answered as port holes.\r\nThere was a diamond-shaped door on the side of the craft nearest him,\r\nand it was into this that the girl was thrust by her two captors, while\r\nTed stood helpless, unable to use his weapons for fear of harming her.\r\n\r\nOne of the men closed the door after them. Then both discs started\r\nwhirling. The craft began to rise, and Ted bounded forward, just in time\r\nto grasp a round of one of the ladders as it cleared the ground.\r\nClimbing quickly up beneath the whirling concave disc, he stepped onto\r\nthe bridge and crouched there, to be out of sight from the port holes\r\nand to plan his next move.\r\n\r\nThere were only two ways for him to enter the craft. He must either cut\r\na hole with his pistol degravitor or go in through the hole which he had\r\ncut with his large degravitor before his craft fell. This hole was high\r\nup in the shell of the globe and could only be reached by climbing the\r\nbelt ladder, then sliding down the smooth shell until the hole was\r\nreached. It was a hazardous undertaking in more ways than one, with\r\nscant hope of success. First, he stood little chance of being able to\r\nclimb the ladder without being seen from one of the ports. That he had\r\nreached his present position undetected was little short of a miracle.\r\n\r\nThen, should he be able to reach the proper position unseen, sliding\r\ndown the shell was a most uncertain and perilous thing to do. There was\r\nnothing to cling to, and the chances were ten to one that he would miss\r\nthe hole he was striving to reach.\r\n\r\nBut assuming that he should reach the hole, there was every probability\r\nstill against him. Undoubtedly, a dozen green ray projectors would\r\ninstantly be turned on him, ending his career without accomplishing his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTrue, he might cut his way into the craft with his pistol degravitor,\r\nbut this would endanger the girl. For all he knew, she might, at that\r\nvery moment, be separated from him only by the shell of the craft which\r\nhe had thought of cutting, and an inch or two of air. She might be at\r\nany point in the craft through which he should elect to cut his way.\r\n\r\nLooking through the bars of the railing, he saw that they were sailing\r\nswiftly over the very spot where he had come near to losing his life to\r\nthe flesh-eating plant only a short time before, and were headed\r\neastward. A moment more and they passed over the rugged rim of the great\r\nring-mountain, Hipparchus. The craft dipped as they passed over the\r\nbarren, debris-strewn inner plain. Were they headed for the destroyed\r\ncity of Ur? And would others of their kind be there to meet them? If so,\r\nhe must act quickly.\r\n\r\nAbandoning all caution, he sprang up the ladder. He expected, at every\r\nstep, that a green ray would shoot out from one of the port holes and\r\ndestroy him, and was surprised when he found himself sitting on top of\r\nthe craft, alive and unharmed. On his right, about ten feet below him,\r\nwas the hole through which his degravitor ray had come out. On his left,\r\napproximately eighteen feet below him, was the hole where it had\r\nentered, cutting a slanting tunnel through the globe. Just above this\r\nhole was a jagged streak of partly cut metal caused by his quick,\r\nunconscious elevation of the degravitor gun just before his craft fell.\r\nThis streak reached almost to where he clung to the ladder, and looked\r\nas if it might afford a means of descent. It was, at least, less\r\nslippery than the smooth, coppery sides of the globe, the metal having\r\nbeen honeycombed in the path of the ray as if eaten by acid.\r\n\r\nStretching himself prone, Ted sought and found holds for his gloved\r\nfingers in the pitted metal and began the descent, head first. He had\r\ncovered a third of the distance when he suddenly noticed a dark wall\r\nlooming beside him. Looking around, he saw that the craft had plunged\r\ninto the great black hole which had been torn in the crater floor of\r\nHipparchus by his interplanetary projectile.\r\n\r\nAs the wall hurtled past him he caught glimpses here and there of\r\ntunnel-like openings, some quite large, all partly choked with debris.\r\nThere came the realization that he must act quickly, as a landing would\r\nprobably be made here, so he turned resolutely to his task of reaching\r\nthe hole.\r\n\r\nHis fingers had barely gripped the edge of the opening by which he\r\nexpected to enter, when the globe slowed down and came to an abrupt\r\nstop. He slipped from his position, but caught one arm over the edge of\r\nthe opening and managed to keep from falling. Quickly drawing himself\r\nup, he crawled inside the craft. He was in a small upper chamber lighted\r\nby the diamond-shaped port holes above. It had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the floor lay the partly destroyed bodies which had been struck by\r\nhis degravitor ray. He found a trap door and opening it, discovered a\r\nladder which led to a room below. He judged, from the array of levers\r\nand buttons, that it was the pilot’s room, but found it also untenanted.\r\nOpening a diamond-shaped door in the rear of this room, he suddenly came\r\nupon a score of Lunites who were passing, single file, out of a side\r\ndoor. All were armed with their deadly ray projectors, but they were as\r\nmuch taken by surprise as he. Drawing both pistol degravitors with\r\nlightning quickness, he raked the line from both ends toward the middle\r\nbefore a single green ray projector could be brought to bear on him.\r\n\r\nOne Lunite only, quicker than the others, escaped by leaping through the\r\ndoor. The others fell, a huddled heap of human remains.\r\n\r\nQuickly bounding to the door, Ted stepped out on the bridge, then ducked\r\njust in time to avoid a green flash. Aiming through the bars of the\r\nrailing he destroyed the man who had projected it.\r\n\r\nThe craft had landed before the explosion-scarred remains of an immense\r\nedifice, the portico of which was supported by gigantic human figures\r\ncut from brown stone. In lieu of steps leading into the building there\r\nwas an inclined ramp, the beautiful tile pattern of which showed here\r\nand there between heaps and fragments of debris.\r\n\r\nHurrying up this ramp were three figures, and he saw that the one in the\r\ncenter who was being dragged forward by the others, was Maza an Ma Gong.\r\nNot daring to use his weapons for fear of striking the girl, he leaped\r\nfrom the bridge to the ground, then started out in pursuit just as the\r\nthree disappeared inside the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XI. CAVERNS OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt only took Ted a moment to reach the huge diamond-shaped door through\r\nwhich the girl and her two abductors had disappeared, but when he\r\nentered it there was no one in sight.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in an immense room, the ceiling of which was supported\r\nby carved figures scarcely less colossal than the ones which held up the\r\nportico. They represented huge, bandy-legged, round-bodied Lunites, with\r\nenormous heads and scrawny arms. The walls were shelved clear to the\r\ntop, and the shelves were piled high with thousands of metal cylinders,\r\nvarying in their diameters from two to about eight inches, but uniformly\r\nabout fifteen inches in length. A few ornate ladders, the gilded sides\r\nof which represented lean-bodied dragons, stood against the walls, but\r\nmany had fallen to the floor as had a number of the cylinders.\r\n\r\nGreat cracks and breaches here and there in the walls showed the\r\ndevastating effects of the explosion of his projectile, as did a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fallen plaster and stone.\r\n\r\nThe place was lighted by an indirect yellow radiance which came from the\r\ntops of the heads of the colossi, and was reflected by the glossy\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nSprawled and huddled here and there on the floor were a great number of\r\nbodies of fallen Lunites. They were surrounded by great swarms of\r\ninsects, and he judged from the appearance of those nearest him that\r\nthey were in an advanced state of putrefaction. As he glanced around, he\r\nsaw a huge gray creature, rat-like in appearance, but as large as a full\r\ngrown Shetland pony, dart through one of the breaches in the wall, seize\r\na body, and quickly carry it back whence it had come.\r\n\r\nThe bodies, he noticed, were clothed in loose-fitting garments which\r\nslightly resembled pajamas, and the massive heads were not covered with\r\nglass helmets as had been those of the Lunites in the spherical craft he\r\nhad just quitted. Evidently these were the bodies of a few of the people\r\nof Ur who had been slain by the explosion of his projectile.\r\n\r\nTed gave slight heed to all these sights as he looked this way and that\r\nin the hope of seeing Maza an Ma Gong and her abductors. That they could\r\nnot have traversed the length of the great hall in so short a time was\r\nobvious. They might, however, have been able to slip through the nearest\r\nbreach in the wall before he reached the doorway.\r\n\r\nAs he bounded forward to investigate this possibility, his path led him\r\npast one of the colossi. Without warning, a deadly green ray suddenly\r\nflashed from behind one of the gigantic limbs. As it struck the helmet\r\nof the young scientist he instinctively pointed and fired a pistol\r\ndegravitor in the direction whence it had come. There was a flash of\r\nbrilliant green light, a terrific pain in his head, and he crashed to\r\nthe floor, the glass of his helmet tinkling on the hard tiles. Then came\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay unconscious on the floor of the huge, subterranean\r\nbuilding, Ted had no means of estimating. He awoke with a dull headache\r\nand the feeling that something was crushing him—bearing down on his body\r\nand limbs with terrific force.\r\n\r\nRaising his head to investigate, he cut his chin on the jagged remnant\r\nof his shattered glass visor before he was able to see what was lying\r\nacross him—a number of pieces of what appeared to be broken plaster.\r\nAfter considerable effort he managed to work his arms free and unscrew\r\nthe now useless collar of his helmet, with its menacing glass fragments.\r\n\r\nThe air of the place, he noticed, was fairly cool and practically as\r\ndense as the atmosphere of the earth—a condition far different from that\r\non the surface of the moon, where the atmosphere was extremely tenuous\r\nand the heat of the lunar mid-day far too great for the existence of\r\nunprotected men. It was good, he thought, to be able to breathe outside\r\na glass helmet once more, even though the air was laden with unpleasant\r\ncharnel odors.\r\n\r\nFive minutes of exhausting labor freed his body and lower limbs from the\r\nheavy fragments which pinned them to the floor. When he rose to survey\r\nthe scene the cause of the fall of plaster was immediately apparent. His\r\ndegravitator ray, fired in the direction from which the green ray, which\r\nhad destroyed the top of his helmet, had come, had cut away the base of\r\nthe supporting colossus behind which his assailant had been concealed,\r\nand this had crashed to the floor, carrying with it a considerable\r\nportion of the plastered ceiling which it had supported.\r\n\r\nBeside a leg of the image he saw the remains of a Lunite, partly\r\ndestroyed by his degravitor ray—probably his attacker. Beneath the leg\r\nwas the crushed, dead body of another Lunite, but of Maza an Ma Gong he\r\nsaw no sign. Had she escaped, leaving him for dead beneath the heap of\r\nplaster? Or did her slender body lie crushed and bleeding under the\r\nfallen statue?\r\n\r\nFilled with apprehension, he walked clear around the prostrate image\r\nwithout seeing a sign of her whom he sought. Then he was startled to\r\nhear his name called: “Ted Dustin. Ted Dustin.” It was the voice of\r\nMaza, and seemed to issue from the colossus. He leaped astride the giant\r\nbody, seeking some hollow which might explain the enigma, but it was not\r\nuntil he had stepped out on one of the huge thighs that he saw the girl.\r\nShe was imprisoned on the floor in the hollow between the two enormous\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nDrawing a pistol degravitor, he found it but the work of a moment to cut\r\naway enough of one of the huge legs to free the girl.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she was unhurt, he judged little short of miraculous, but\r\nwhether it was due to chance or to her own dexterity he had no means of\r\nfinding out. She had the front of her helmet open, and he noticed that\r\nthe antennae of her miniature radiophone were smashed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was free she picked up a green ray projector which one of\r\nthe Lunites had dropped, and started for the door, beckoning him to\r\nfollow. They had barely reached the ramp when Ted heard a great clatter\r\nbehind them and the sound of running feet. Turning, he saw a horde of\r\narmed men rushing through an archway in the rear of the building.\r\nInstead of glass helmets and furry clothing, these men wore metal\r\nhelmets and plate armor, and carried, in addition to their ray\r\nprojectors, long swords, and spears with heads like long-toothed buzz\r\nsaws.\r\n\r\nWith his degravitors leveled in two lethal arcs, Ted cut down the\r\nforemost ranks of the attackers and gave the others pause. Evidently\r\nthey were dumfounded at the sight of weapons that fired invisible rays.\r\nWhile they hesitated he caught up his companion, and turning, bounded\r\ndown the tiled ramp with mighty fifty foot leaps that amazed them still\r\nmore, crossed a circular plaza over which were scattered\r\nindiscriminately, rock debris, fallen and broken statuary, and dead\r\nbodies, many of which were partly devoured, and dodged in among the\r\nremains of a fallen colossus.\r\n\r\nThe clank of arms and accoutrements became increasingly audible, and Ted\r\nturned to see if any of their pursuers were in sight. At that moment his\r\nfoot encountered empty air, and he fell, dragging his companion with\r\nhim, into a steeply slanting tunnel which was about four feet in\r\ndiameter at the mouth.\r\n\r\nSliding and tumbling, the two at length brought up against the wall of a\r\ntransverse passageway which slanted downward to their left.\r\n\r\nA shout and the clatter of weapons from the ground above brought Ted\r\nquickly to his feet. Helping his companion to arise, he took her hand\r\nand the two hurried down the inclined ramp. They had not covered more\r\nthan a hundred feet before the way grew dark and the tunnel tortuous, so\r\nthey were forced to proceed with the utmost caution. They felt their way\r\nalong in the inky blackness for some time. Presently all sounds save\r\nthose of their own footsteps ceased. Then Ted was suddenly and\r\ntemporarily blinded by a glare of light. When his eyes had become\r\naccustomed to it, he saw that it came from a small lens fastened in his\r\ncompanion’s helmet just above her forehead. Evidently she had not turned\r\nit on before for the sake of caution.\r\n\r\nThen it was the girl who became the leader in their flight. As they\r\nencountered a labyrinth of passageways, she would turn now to the right,\r\nnow to the left, always following the ramps which slanted downward, and\r\nTed saw her glance from time to time at queer Lunite symbols painted on\r\nthe walls, which evidently marked the way.\r\n\r\nPresently she switched off her light, and Ted noticed that there was a\r\nstrange, phosphorescent luminescence in the passageway ahead of them.\r\nIts source became apparent when they suddenly emerged from the end of\r\nthe tunnel into a wide lane which wound through a thick grove of tall\r\nstraight plants that appeared to Ted like gigantic shoots of asparagus\r\npainted with phosphorus. They varied from a thickness of six inches to\r\nwell over three feet at the base, and some of the tallest towered fully\r\nseventy feet into the air. The light they gave off was quite as\r\nbrilliant as the full moon appears from the earth, and was reflected by\r\nmyriads of gleaming, white stalactites depending from an arched vault\r\nfar above them. Stalagmites, also, gleamed here and there among the\r\nshining plants, and the lane or road which they were following was\r\nevidently made from the same white material crushed into small fragments\r\nand rolled smooth.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the girl grasped Ted’s arm, and pulling him in among the tall,\r\nluminous trunks, secreted herself behind one of the larger ones and\r\nmotioned him to do likewise.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he followed her example, ere there came to his ears a\r\ncracking, rumbling sound. Then, from around the bend in the lane, there\r\nwaddled a huge, hulking creature of most fearsome aspect. Ted had seen\r\npictures of wingless Chinese dragons, and this ugly vision, now less\r\nthan fifty feet from him, was one of those pictures immensely\r\nmagnified—for it was as tall as a camel and three times as long. Just in\r\nfront of its spiny crest and behind its relatively small ears, a\r\nround-bodied Lunite was perched on its massive head. Luminous vapor\r\nissued from its nostrils at intervals of a few seconds, and the myriad\r\nscales that covered its long, twisting body, as well as its thousands of\r\nsharp dorsal spines, reflected the phosphorescent light of the forest\r\nthat bordered the lane.\r\n\r\nThis ugly monster straddled a long pole with its four bowed legs, the\r\nfront end of which was attached to a U shaped collar that circled its\r\nscaly neck, and the rear end of which was fastened to a long chain of\r\ncreaking, bumping carts, fastened together by hooks and rings. Each of\r\nthese carts traveled on two large rollers in lieu of wheels, and\r\ncontained many metal cylinders which jolted and banged together as the\r\nvehicle lumbered along.\r\n\r\nWalking beside the cart on each side was a long row of Lunites clad in\r\nsandals and coarse, loose fitting tunics that reached to the knees. The\r\nlong black hair of these workmen was twisted up in a pointed,\r\npagoda-like effect on top of the head. Each man carried a two handled\r\nmetal urn, a short tube pointed at one end like a quill, and a small\r\nmallet.\r\n\r\nBehind the first dragon came two others, similarly harnessed and\r\nattended, and Ted, noticing that the last dragon snatched from time to\r\ntime at the shoots of the luminous plants which grew by the roadside,\r\nmunching each phosphorescent mouthful with apparent relish, saw the\r\nreason these creatures appeared to breathe fire. It was some time later\r\nthat he learned this was a crew of sap gatherers, returning with a\r\nsupply of cylinders filled with the luminous fluid with which the Lunite\r\nchemists made the yellow, light-emitting liquid which, suspended in\r\ntransparent containers, lighted their underground cities.\r\n\r\nWhen the cavalcade had passed out of sight down the road the girl\r\nmotioned him to rise, and together they resumed their flight. They\r\npassed many cross-lanes in the luminous forest, unmolested. Then the one\r\non which they were traveling came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated area now gave way to an immense tangle of luminous and\r\nnon-luminous plants of various hues and shades—a tremendous hodge podge\r\nof winding creepers, low fungi of every conceivable shape, and tall\r\ntrunks, jointed, smooth, and spiny—some topped like mushrooms, spears,\r\nstars or globes, others with long waving fronds like palms or ferns.\r\n\r\nMost of the non-luminous plants were white, although some were gray or\r\nblack. Here and there among the common phosphorescent types of luminous\r\nplants were scattered groups and individuals which gave off red, green,\r\npink, violet or yellow light. Some of them emitted two or three shades\r\nof one color, or even several colors of light. The whole scene was a\r\nvast, weird, fairyland of color and shade—at once, beautiful and\r\nforbidding.\r\n\r\nInto this tangle the girl plunged without the slightest hesitation. Ted\r\nfollowed, a pistol degravitor in his hand ready for instant action.\r\n\r\nAs they progressed further and further into this subterranean wilderness\r\nthe fauna of the place became more and more in evidence, indicating to\r\nTed that, if one might judge from the conduct of the wild things, they\r\nwere gradually receding from the haunts of man.\r\n\r\nFrom the shadows many pairs of burning eyes glared out at them. Small\r\nanimals, sensing their approach, scurried hastily from their pathway.\r\nFeatherless birds, or winged reptiles—Ted did not know which to call\r\nthem—flitted among the branches above their heads. Larger ones, some of\r\nthem appearing huge enough to have flown off with elephants, soared far\r\nup near the vaulted roof or flapped lazily back and forth above the\r\ntree-tops, evidently in search of prey. Some of them had luminous body\r\nareas which gleamed dully as they flew, but flashed from time to time\r\nfrom crests, throats, or wing-tips like the display of a swarm of\r\nfireflies magnified ten thousand fold.\r\n\r\nThere were luminous insects and worms, also, of various shades—and\r\nluminous serpents coiled on boles and branches, some of them flashing\r\ncrests or tail-tips when disturbed as if to warn an intruder of their\r\ndangerous presence.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with a cacophonous medley of roars, bellows, croaks,\r\nshrieks, growls and hisses, sometimes interspersed with more melodious\r\nwarbling, whistling or bell-like tones.\r\n\r\nAt times huge monsters, most of them dragon-like dinosaurs, crashed\r\nfearlessly through the jungle, pausing now and again to crop herbage or\r\ndevour huge mouthfuls of luminous fungus, and exhaling great clouds of\r\nphosphorescent vapor that hung like wraiths in the still air above their\r\nenormous heads.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere was a dank, musty odor as if mold and matches had been\r\nmixed with stagnant water and brewed in a cauldron over a slow fire.\r\n\r\nPresently they emerged from the jungle into a broad savanna of white,\r\njointed grass with luminous tips, that reached to Ted’s shoulders. They\r\nwalked side by side, now, and Ted noticed that the girl often glanced at\r\na small instrument clamped on her wrist—evidently a compass.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his attention was distracted by a pair of enormous\r\ncreatures, each well over fifty feet in height, browsing leisurely not\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile to his right. Then a fearful thing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nTed’s first intimation of it was the whistle of giant pinions just\r\nbehind him. Then something struck the back of his head, knocking him\r\nflat on his face.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled to his feet and quickly brought up his pistol degravitor as\r\nhe saw the girl, already far above the ground, struggling in the talons\r\nof a mighty flying reptile. His finger trembled on the trigger yet he\r\ndid not pull it, for there suddenly came to him the realization that to\r\ndestroy the monster would be to as surely kill the girl. A fall from\r\nthat great height would have crushed her frail body to a pulp.\r\n\r\nThe creature flew with terrific speed, and in a moment, had disappeared\r\nfrom view with its prey.\r\n\r\nDejectedly, Ted holstered his degravitor. His downward glance fell on\r\nthe green ray projector which the girl had carried—evidently knocked\r\nfrom her hand by the swoop of her captor.\r\n\r\nHe was about to pick it up, when suddenly far off in the dim mistiness\r\ntoward which she had been carried, he saw a brilliant, star-like light,\r\nmoving rapidly. It was unlike the phosphorescent gleam of the light\r\ncarrying flyers, and he instantly recognized its import. Maza had\r\nlighted her brilliant head lamp in a last, desperate effort to guide him\r\nto her rescue.\r\n\r\nWith mighty bounds which, on earth, would have been phenomenal, but on\r\nthe moon were quite normal leaps for his earth-trained muscles, he set\r\nout in swift pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           XII. AERIAL BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Roger Sanders plunged downward from the sky, the fragments of Ted’s\r\nshattered Blettendorf dropping around him, the three strange globes that\r\nhad wrought such swift destruction with their green rays in so short a\r\ntime, disappeared from view in a blinding whirl of cloud and snow. His\r\nparachute was whipped about by the force of the wind until he feared the\r\nlashings would be torn loose, but they held, and he presently landed,\r\nwaist deep, in a snow drift.\r\n\r\nHe was floundering about, endeavoring to extricate himself from the\r\nclutches of the wet, sticky mess, when suddenly he heard his name\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sanders.”\r\n\r\nHe answered, and a moment later a figure shuffled toward him and helped\r\nhim from the drift. It was Bevans.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t fall in as deeply as you, sir,” he said. “Landed in the middle\r\nof the road, while you went in the ditch. I’ve been walking along,\r\ncalling your name in the hope of locating you.”\r\n\r\n“Did you notice where the professor fell?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. He leaped before I did, and I saw him fall on the bridge of\r\nthat strange globe. He tried to jump off again, but one of those\r\ndiamond-shaped port holes opened, and he was dragged inside. I suppose\r\nthey slaughtered him. A horrible ending for one of the greatest minds of\r\nthe century.”\r\n\r\n“Awful,” replied Roger. “Ted will be broken up when he hears it—that is\r\nif he lives to hear it. But we can’t help things any by crying about\r\nthem. Any idea where we are?”\r\n\r\n“I should say we’re somewhere in Indiana, sir, and not far from a flying\r\nfield. Have you noticed the flashes of light and dark in the snow above\r\nus at regular intervals? Must be from a beacon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s see if we can find out.”\r\n\r\nGuided by the dimly seen flashes, the two at length found themselves at\r\nthe airdrome of the South Bend Flying Field—a government training\r\nstation for student aviators since the advent of planes equipped to rise\r\nor descend vertically, and the consequent ability of experienced pilots\r\nto land “on a dime”.\r\n\r\nRidding themselves of a considerable weight of sticky snow by brushing\r\neach other, they entered the building, where a watchman, with a huge,\r\nfoul-smelling cob pipe in his mouth, was playing a game of solitaire.\r\n\r\nSpying a radiovisiphone, Roger was hurrying toward it to make his report\r\nwhile Bevans explained things to the watchman, when the figure of a man\r\nin military uniform suddenly appeared in the disc. He read from a sheet\r\nof paper held in his hand:\r\n\r\n  M. O. 318,246\r\n\r\n  Three flying globes sighted by U. S. S. P’s 347, 1098 and 221. 347\r\n  destroyed by strange green ray from one of the globes. 1098 and 221\r\n  shelling them without apparent effect when their radios were silenced.\r\n  All combat planes in Zone 36 are ordered to report, fully manned, to\r\n  division headquarters, and stand by for orders.\r\n\r\n                                                 General J. Q. Marshall.\r\n\r\n“Oh, boy! There’ll be some scrap, now!” said Roger, “but I’m afraid our\r\nplanes won’t stand much chance against those green rays. I’d like to be\r\nin on it, though.”\r\n\r\n“I, too, sir,” said Bevans.\r\n\r\nRoger rapidly whirled the dials of the radiovisiphone, presently\r\nobtaining direct communication with President Whitmore, to whom he made\r\nhis report. He was ordered back to Chicago at once, a plane being\r\nrequisitioned from the flying field for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs he and Bevans were about to take off they noticed six combat planes,\r\nmanned and waiting orders. These rose only a few seconds after they did.\r\n\r\nThe air was now much warmer, the snow having been replaced by a faint\r\ndrizzle of rain. This, too, subsided before they had flown half way to\r\ntheir destination, but a heavy fog, following the swift melting of the\r\nsnow, made the visibility exceedingly low.\r\n\r\nDespite this handicap, however, the skillful Bevans landed his plane\r\nneatly on the roof of the Dustin Building, turning it over to another of\r\nTed’s pilots to be returned immediately to the flying field.\r\n\r\nThe cold weather had passed as quickly as it had come, and this fact\r\nadded to the evidence that it had been directly produced by the giant\r\ngreen ray from the moon.\r\n\r\nBack in his office, Roger quickly communicated with his wife by wrist\r\nradiophone—then waded into the mass of work which had accumulated during\r\nhis absence. According to the shop reports the great interplanetary\r\nvehicle would soon be ready for launching. But fully as important as\r\nthis, he found that ten thousand pistol degravitors and a thousand large\r\ndegravitors for use on combat planes were completed and ready to be\r\nloaded with the special anode-cathode ray batteries in process in\r\nanother division. Turning to the report of the superintendent of the\r\nbattery division, he found that a hundred of the large and five hundred\r\nof the small batteries were ready for use.\r\n\r\nGoing to the safe, he took out the directions for assembling and firing\r\nwhich Ted had left, and after giving them a careful reading, ordered ten\r\nof the large and a hundred of the small weapons and an equal number of\r\nsuitable anode-cathode batteries sent up to his office.\r\n\r\nMorning came before he had completed his work of assembling them. Then,\r\ncarrying a large and a small degravitor to the roof, he tested them on\r\nthe remains of Ted’s metal hangar and found that they worked\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\nHurrying back to his office he set the safety catch on every weapon—then\r\nordered them packed and loaded into one of Ted’s freight-carrying\r\nelectroplanes. An hour later, with Bevans as pilot, he was on his way to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the capital he used his binoculars on the surrounding\r\nterritory, and noticed the havoc wrought by the green rays. At points\r\nwhere the effects of the rays had ended, rivers and creeks were blocked\r\nby ice gorges, overflowing the surrounding territory. The vegetation was\r\nwilted and lifeless, as if blighted by a heavy frost. In the villages\r\nand towns, Red Cross workers were going from house to house, relieving\r\nthe sufferings of the survivors, followed by undertakers’ cars and large\r\ntrucks, loaded with the canvas-wrapped remains of those who would suffer\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at the Capitol he sought and gained an immediate\r\ninterview with the President.\r\n\r\nThe chief executive of the country looked up from the stack of papers on\r\nhis desk as Roger entered, and greeted him with:\r\n\r\n“Now, what the devil are you doing here? I thought I ordered you back to\r\nChicago last night. Who is going to look after your plant and radio\r\nstation with both you and Dustin away?”\r\n\r\n“Important business,” replied Roger. “I’ll be leaving for Chicago again\r\nwithin the hour, but I’ve something to show you that, for the present, I\r\ndon’t dare make public over the air.”\r\n\r\n“What about your code? Afraid someone will figure them out?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, but this is something you will have to be shown. I have\r\nsome new weapons invented by Mr. Dustin, a few of which have been\r\nmanufactured in his plant under my direction during his absence—weapons\r\nwith which I believe we can successfully combat the green rays of the\r\nmoon men.”\r\n\r\n“Where are they?”\r\n\r\n“In one of our freight carriers, now on the roof of the Lincoln Hotel\r\nunder guard.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to hear more, President Whitmore seized his hat and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“We’ll have a look at them right now.”\r\n\r\nOn the way out he gave orders that Secretary of War Jamison and General\r\nMarshall meet him on the roof of the Lincoln in fifteen minutes. Once\r\nout of the Capitol, they were quickly transported to the hotel roof in\r\nthe President’s private helicopter limousine.\r\n\r\nRoger brought out one of the pistol degravitors, unwrapped it, and\r\nexplained its use to the chief executive. Then he had an old propeller\r\nblade suspended on a wire, and proceeded to demolish it before the eyes\r\nof the astonished President.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Secretary Jamison and General Marshall arrived, and\r\nanother old blade was disintegrated for their benefit.\r\n\r\nSecretary Jamison, a newly appointed civilian, showed wonder and\r\namazement, but General Marshall seemed unconvinced.\r\n\r\n“What is the effective range of this weapon?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“The theoretical range of this one,” replied Roger, “as worked out by\r\nMr. Dustin, is one mile. In other words, it is supposed to completely\r\ndisintegrate any known matter of any possible hardness or tensile\r\nstrength, up to that distance. Beyond that distance, however, it would\r\nbe deadly to man or animals, even though it should not completely\r\ndestroy their bodies, up to a distance of perhaps two miles. I have with\r\nme, also, weapons constructed on the same principle, but much larger,\r\nwith a theoretical range of twenty-five miles.”\r\n\r\n“Have the weapons been tested at the ranges you name?”\r\n\r\n“Not to my knowledge, but when Mr. Dustin figures something out it is\r\nusually right.”\r\n\r\n“I would respectfully suggest, Mr. President,” said the General,\r\nstiffly, “that they be so tested.”\r\n\r\n“And I was about to suggest the same thing,” rejoined Roger.\r\n\r\n“We’ll make the tests at once,” decided the President. “While the\r\nGeneral is arranging for the aerial targets you may get out one of the\r\nlarger weapons, Mr. Sanders.”\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, Roger and the President were hovering on the\r\nshore of Chesapeake Bay in the latter’s helicopter limousine. Several\r\nhundred feet above the General and the Secretary of War hovered in a\r\ngovernment plane, while one of their men directed the four aerial\r\ntargets, miniature helicopter planes controlled by radio.\r\n\r\nWhen one of them had flown a distance of a mile out over the bay the\r\nGeneral signaled Roger who promptly brought it down with his pistol\r\ndegravitor. A second, placed two miles away, presently crumpled and\r\nfell, although it withstood about five minutes’ exposure to the rays of\r\nthe small weapon at that distance.\r\n\r\nThen Roger mounted his large degravitor on a tripod, and with the\r\nassistance of his powerful field glasses, brought down one of the\r\ntargets which meanwhile had been stationed at a distance of twenty-five\r\nmiles up the bay. The fourth target, placed thirty-five miles away,\r\nwhich was as far as he could see it with his glasses, suffered a similar\r\nfate after only a few seconds exposure to the rays.\r\n\r\n“Marvellous!” commented the President, as they winged their way back to\r\nthe Capitol. “How many of these degravitors are ready for use?”\r\n\r\n“I brought ten of the large and a hundred of the small ones with me,”\r\nreplied Roger. “Within the week I can send you ninety more of the large\r\nand four hundred of the small.”\r\n\r\n“And how fast can you turn them out after that?”\r\n\r\n“We are equipped to turn out five hundred small and one hundred large a\r\nweek. If more are required we can enlarge our capacity at any time.”\r\n\r\n“Let the order stand on the weekly basis you mention, then,” said the\r\nPresident as they got out of the limousine, “unless I send you word to\r\nincrease it.”\r\n\r\nThey returned once more to the President’s office, where he was\r\nimmediately signaled by the radiovisiphone operator.\r\n\r\n“World News Broadcasters on the air will announce important tidings from\r\nChina in one minute. Shall I tune them in, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the President, seating himself at his desk and watching\r\nthe disc.\r\n\r\nA picture of the World News Announcer quickly flashed on the screen, and\r\nhe stood looking at them for a moment, holding his chronometer in one\r\nhand and a sheet of paper in the other. Then he said:\r\n\r\n“Our correspondent in Peiping announces that the three strange globes\r\nfrom the moon, which destroyed three scout planes with their green rays\r\nlast night and then disappeared, arrived in Peiping this morning.\r\n\r\n“A dozen of the queer, round-bodied men immediately went into conference\r\nwith the Chinese president and his cabinet. As soon, however, as the odd\r\nvisitors had been described to the Chinese people, and, of course, seen\r\nby many of them, and it became generally known that the government\r\npurposed submitting to the rule of the moon government and assisting the\r\nlunar emperor to conquer the earth, a revolution was fomented and the\r\nCapitol attacked.\r\n\r\n“The Chinese president and the members of his cabinet were all slain in\r\nthe battle that followed, as were the twelve moon men closeted with\r\nthem. After laying waste the greater part of the city, and killing\r\nhundreds of thousands with their green rays, the globes then departed,\r\nflying eastward. They were last sighted flying high over southern Japan\r\nwith terrific speed, apparently bound for the United States.\r\n\r\n“General Fu Yen, the revolutionary leader and new provisional president,\r\nannounces his intention to stand by the other nations of the world in\r\nthe war with the moon, and will shortly send official messages to the\r\nother powers to that effect. It is believed that he is supported in this\r\ndecision by at least ninety percent of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\n“One of his first official acts was to place Dr. Fang, the Manchu, under\r\narrest as an instigator of the plot to sell out the nation to the moon\r\nmonarch, Dr. Wu, his co-conspirator, having been slain with the former\r\npresident and cabinet members during the attack on the Capitol.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting, and vastly relieving, if true,” commented the President,\r\n“so far as the Chinese are concerned. But we still have those flying\r\nglobes to contend with. They are on their way over here now, and nobody\r\nknows how fast they can travel. I think you brought out the new weapons\r\nin the nick of time, Mr. Sanders. Would you care to direct a combat\r\nsquadron sent out to meet our belligerent visitors?”\r\n\r\n“I’d be delighted with the honor,” replied Roger.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Hurry over and get your weapons unlimbered. I’ll have ten\r\nexpert gunners over at the hotel roof in as many minutes, and while you\r\nare explaining the weapons to them, five combat planes will be made\r\nready.”\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, Roger, with the help of Bevans, was hastily\r\nunloading the large degravitors from the freighter, when an air alarm\r\nsiren sounded below them, followed by another and another until the city\r\nwas in an uproar.\r\n\r\nIn a moment a fleet of combat planes left the ground and headed\r\nwestward. Using his glasses, Roger saw the reason. The three huge lunar\r\nglobes which had, only a few minutes before, been reported on the way to\r\nthe United States, were flying swiftly toward the Capitol, raking the\r\nground beneath them with their deadly green rays, more than a dozen of\r\nwhich shone from each globe—and occasionally destroying aircraft that\r\napproached them.\r\n\r\nStanding on the hotel roof beside Ted’s aerial freighter was the\r\nhelicopter limousine of the President. Its chauffeur was idly leaning\r\nagainst a wing, watching the fast disappearing squadron which had just\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\n“Quick, Bevans!” said Roger. “It’s you and me for it! Grab those\r\ncontrols and I’ll bring a degravitor!”\r\n\r\nThey rose, a moment later, with helicopters roaring, while the\r\nPresident’s pilot, who had lost his prop and his balance, scrambled to\r\nhis feet and gaped after them. The plane was a swift one, and in a few\r\nminutes Bevans had brought it close behind the aerial squadron.\r\n\r\n“Straight up, now,” ordered Roger, “and make it snappy.”\r\n\r\nAs they began their ascent the battle started with the rattle of machine\r\nguns and the boom of rapid fire turret guns. Then the globes, apparently\r\nunharmed by the gunfire, began systematically wiping out the defense\r\nsquadron with their green rays. One by one, huge combat planes were\r\ncrumpling and crashing to the ground, when Roger brought his degravitor\r\nto bear on the foremost globe. His invisible ray cut a round hole about\r\nfour feet in diameter clear through the center of the lunar vehicle,\r\nwith no apparent effect on its progress or lethal ray projectors. But he\r\nhad only to lower, then slightly elevate his weapon, and the globe was\r\ndivided as neatly as a knife divides an apple, both halves crashing\r\ninstantly to the ground.\r\n\r\nSwinging his degravitor into line on another globe, Roger proceeded to\r\nhalve it as he had the first, but before he could turn it on the third\r\nglobe, the latter, its commander apparently fearing the fate of the\r\nfirst two, elevated its forward disc and shot straight up into the air\r\nwith such appalling speed that it disappeared completely in a moment.\r\n\r\nRoger clapped his binoculars to his eyes, but even they failed to reveal\r\nthe swiftly flying globe.\r\n\r\n“No use to follow that bird, Bevans,” he said. “He’s well on his way to\r\nthe moon by this time. Let’s go and have a look at the ones we brought\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nThey descended, but a half dozen of the government combat planes were\r\nahead of them, and the men were dragging the bodies of stunned and dead\r\nLunites from the wrecks when they arrived. Forty dazed prisoners, most\r\nof whom had fractured limbs, were taken from the wrecks, and twenty-six\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nRoger’s great fear was that he might find the body of Professor Ederson\r\nin the wrecks, but there was no sign of it. Either he had been\r\ncompletely destroyed by the degravitor rays, or was in the globe which\r\nhad escaped.\r\n\r\nOnly thirty of the squadron of fifty combat planes which had flown out\r\nto meet the foe accompanied Roger back to the Capitol. The others,\r\ntogether with their crews, had been utterly destroyed by the green rays.\r\n\r\nBack in the President’s office, Roger received the commendation of the\r\nchief executive with a deprecatory shrug.\r\n\r\n“It was nothing,” he said. “Easier than breaking clay pigeons with a\r\ntrap gun.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe the General will ask for any more demonstrations,”\r\nsmiled the President. “From now on, he’ll be crying night and day for\r\ndegravitors.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the President’s radiovisiphone operator appeared in the\r\ndisc and said:\r\n\r\n“Chicago is calling Mr. Sanders, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Tune them in,” said the President.\r\n\r\nThere instantly appeared in the disc, the face of Ted’s day operator,\r\nMiss Whitley.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Stanley, in charge of the big radiovisiphone, thinks the moon\r\npeople are trying to get in touch with us,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Tell him to hold them, if he can, until we can silence all broadcasting\r\nstations,” replied Roger. “Then connect me with him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         XIII. FLYING REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the mighty bounds with which Ted Dustin pursued the hideous\r\nflying reptile which was carrying off Maza of the Moon, the star-like\r\ngleam of her head lamp quickly grew more dim, showing that he was being\r\nrapidly outdistanced.\r\n\r\nPresently it twinkled and went out, but he continued his pace, unabated,\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\nAs he hurried on, huge herbivorous dinosaurs, disturbed at their\r\nfeeding, raised their massive heads from time to time to contemptuously\r\nsnort fiery vapor at the queer and insignificant creature that bounded\r\npast them. Mighty reptilian carnivores, their bloody feasts interrupted,\r\nwere more hostile, snarling or roaring hideously when he passed close to\r\nthem, but he paid no heed to either.\r\n\r\nOnce his path was barred by a great, quill covered creature resembling a\r\ntiger, with the exception of the tail, which was a short, thick,\r\nspine-covered stub. It was larger than a draft horse, and presented a\r\nmost fearsome appearance. With gleaming tusks bared, and sickle-like\r\nclaws unsheathed, it sprang for him.\r\n\r\nHe halted, digging his toes into the ground for an instant to stop his\r\nforward momentum—then leaped backward, alighting fully fifty feet behind\r\nthe spot on which he had stood. Before the creature could spring again\r\nhe brought both pistol degravitors into play, and although the invisible\r\nbeams played for but a moment across the huge breast of the beast, it\r\nwas as if a giant scythe had suddenly cut through it, dividing the\r\ndorsal part of the body from the ventral. The claws and belly,\r\napparently impelled by something akin to reflex action, leaped weakly\r\nforward, but the head and upper part of the body slipped off and fell to\r\nthe ground behind them.\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to view the unusual sight of four massive legs wabbling\r\ndisjointedly about carrying a great, sagging belly, Ted again pressed\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nPresently the character of the country he was crossing changed. At first\r\nthe shimmering, undulating surface of the savanna was broken by\r\noccasional outcroppings of white stone, mostly conical in form, but as\r\nhe progressed, the vegetation grew more and more sparse until it\r\ndisappeared altogether. He was in a forest of white columns, cones and\r\npyramids—mighty stalagmites that dwarfed to insignificance anything of\r\nwhich he had ever heard or read, reaching upward toward equally huge\r\nstalactites, depending from the vaulted roof above. The ground beneath\r\nhis feet was completely covered by rock fragments, varying in bulk from\r\nmere white powder to huge boulders weighing thousands of tons—evidently\r\nthe remains of both stalactites and stalagmites dislodged by seismic\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nHis pace was slackened by these constant obstructions, and by the fact\r\nthat the light gradually diminished in intensity as he drew away from\r\nthe luminous vegetation. As he penetrated further and further into the\r\ndeepening gloom that shrouded the ghostly columns there came to him the\r\nconviction that his quest was well nigh hopeless. There came, also, in\r\nthe dark moment, the realization that the girl he had known for so short\r\na time had come to mean far more to him than a mere companion in\r\nadventure—that if she were dead, life would have little to offer him.\r\n\r\nTired and dejected, he sat down on a boulder to rest and to think.\r\nAutomatically he reached in his pocket for his black briar. As he did\r\nso, a tiny pebble suddenly fell at his feet. Several more followed as he\r\nquickly glanced upward.\r\n\r\nJust behind him the huge stump of a broken stalagmite, fully a hundred\r\nfeet in diameter and forty feet to where it had been cracked off, reared\r\nits shattered head. Turning his gaze toward it, he saw the tip of a huge\r\npinion brushing back and forth across the edge as if its owner were\r\nengaged in a struggle. But most important of all, he noticed that the\r\nend of the wing as well as the broken edges of the stalagmite were\r\nbathed in a white radiance which differed in color and appearance from\r\nthe phosphorescent luminosity of the lunar flora and fauna. Was it from\r\nthe head lamp of Maza?\r\n\r\nBounding to his feet, he looked in vain for a place to climb the\r\nstalactite. Then, remembering the advantage his earthly muscles gave\r\nhim, he backed up for a few paces, took a running start, and sprang into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped to be able to catch hold of the rim of the broken top, but\r\nto his surprise, he passed completely over it, alighting in a cup-like\r\ndepression about twenty feet in diameter which housed two of the\r\nhomeliest looking creatures on which he had ever set eyes. They were\r\nscrawny, long legged, goggle eyed caricatures of the flying reptile\r\nwhich had carried off his companion some time before. Standing on the\r\nedge of the rim, dangling the girl by one leg in its huge mandibles and\r\nbalancing itself with outspread wings, was the reptile itself,\r\napparently trying to feed her to its young. That they had been unable,\r\nthus far, to do more than strip some of the wool from her armor, was\r\nevinced by the condition of their saw-edged bills, which both were\r\nshaking for the evident purpose of trying to rid them of the annoying\r\nfuzz.\r\n\r\nAll this, Ted saw at a glance, and no sooner saw than he acted. Whipping\r\nout a degravitor, he completely severed the great, arched neck of the\r\nreptile with a single sweep of its deadly ray—then caught the girl in\r\nhis arms as she fell head-long, and was himself knocked to the floor by\r\nthe falling, hissing head of the monster, while its giant body fluttered\r\nand toppled backward to crash to the ground a moment later. Partly\r\nstunned though he was by the blow from that huge head, he quickly\r\ndispatched the two hideous young ones with his degravitors—then turned\r\nhis attention to the girl who lay across his lap.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were closed and her head hung limply against the side of her\r\nglass helmet. Quickly opening her visor, he chafed her cheeks and\r\nforehead and blew on her eyelids, the faint flutter of which presently\r\nnotified him that her consciousness was returning.\r\n\r\n“Ted—Ted Dustin,” she murmured, and snuggled more closely to him.\r\n\r\nHe held her thus for a few moments, his heart beats registering an\r\nacceleration that could not possibly have been due to his recent\r\nexertions. Then she opened her great blue eyes, looked up into his, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“_Kari na Ultu._”\r\n\r\nThis, he interpreted to mean: “Go to Ultu,” so he, not having sufficient\r\nlunar vocabulary to ask her in what direction, managed to convey his\r\nquestion by signs.\r\n\r\nShe sat up, looked at the instrument strapped to her wrist for a moment,\r\nthen pointed in the direction in which they had been traveling.\r\n\r\n“Ultu,” she said.\r\n\r\nFor answer, he rose, still holding her in his arms, walked to the edge\r\nof the stalagmite, and stepped off, alighting at the end of the forty\r\nfoot fall with no more of a jar than a similar step from a height of\r\nseven feet would have caused on earth.\r\n\r\nHer little exclamation of alarm as they fell was changed to a cry of\r\nsurprise and delight when she saw they had reached the ground unhurt.\r\nThen she signed that she wished to be put down.\r\n\r\nHe gently lowered her to her feet, and together they pressed on into the\r\ndeepening gloom—their way now made easier by the light of the girl’s\r\nhead lamp, reflected with many weird effects by the spectral white\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nFor many miles they traveled through murk so black that it seemed almost\r\nto have solidity, their range of vision limited to the small area\r\nlighted by Maza’s head lamp. Then a faint phosphorescent twilight\r\ntempered the thick darkness, and scattered tufts of luminous vegetation\r\nled into a mighty, tangled jungle, as well lighted by its own flora as\r\nthe first one they had crossed.\r\n\r\nBefore they entered it, Ted unholstered one of his degravitors and,\r\nhanding it to his companion, showed her how to fire it by pressing the\r\ntrigger. She tested it, first on a clump of luminous toadstools and then\r\non a small flying reptile, and he was delighted to see that her\r\nmarksmanship was excellent, due, no doubt, to her proficiency with a red\r\nray projector.\r\n\r\nThen she extinguished her head lamp, and together they plunged into the\r\nriotous medley of sound and color, of strange smells and stranger sights\r\nthat constituted a lunar subterranean forest.\r\n\r\nAfter more than an hour of travel through the jungle without molestation\r\nfrom any of its queer creatures, they arrived at the bank of a swiftly\r\nflowing stream about sixty feet across.\r\n\r\nThe girl took a small drinking cup from a pocket of her armor, dipped it\r\nin the stream, and offered it to Ted, but he gallantly shook his head,\r\nindicating that she should drink first. She did so, sipping the water\r\nslowly as if it had been the last glass of some priceless wine of rare\r\nand ancient vintage. Ted filled his canteen in the meanwhile, and drank\r\na deep draught, finding the water slightly alkaline, but quite\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nHaving drunk her water, Maza opened two clasps which loosed her glass\r\nhelmet, and lifted it from her head. Then she sat down on a low\r\ntoadstool and began a minute examination of the fine wires on the crest\r\nwhich constituted the antennae of her radio set. She worked with them\r\nfor some time, her white brow often wrinkled in puzzlement, but\r\npresently gave up with a shrug of disappointment.\r\n\r\nThen Ted, who had been watching her intently, took the helmet from her\r\nhands and closely examined the broken head-set himself. His knowledge of\r\nradio, combined with his extraordinary inventive genius, stood him in\r\nsuch good stead that it was not long before he had located the source of\r\nthe trouble.\r\n\r\nWhile he set rapidly to work to repair the damage with tools from his\r\npocket kit, his companion gathered some dried and broken ribs of tree\r\nfronds that had fallen nearby and ignited them with a tiny red ray from\r\na small lighter she carried. Then, taking Ted’s hunting knife from its\r\nsheath, she cut several slabs from a pear shaped mushroom that grew near\r\nthe water’s edge, spitted them on a green frond, and grilled them over\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nBy the time Ted had finished his work of repairing her small radio set,\r\nshe had spread the top of a toadstool with large flat leaves in lieu of\r\na table cover, and placed thereon tastily grilled slabs of mushrooms,\r\ntogether with several varieties of small fruits which grew in abundance\r\nall around them.\r\n\r\nReturning her helmet to her, Ted showed his admiration of her lunar\r\nwoodcraft and culinary skill by seating himself opposite her and\r\nheartily falling to. The mushroom slabs were delicious, and the odd\r\nfruits exceptionally palatable.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, Maza pressed the signal button connected to her\r\nhead-set, there was an answering voice, and she immediately began a\r\nconversation which lasted several minutes, but which Ted was, of course,\r\nunable to understand. Once he saw her glance at the instrument on her\r\nwrist, and judged that she was telling someone their location. Presently\r\nshe ceased talking, walked to a bed of moss beneath some long,\r\noverhanging fronds, and lay down as if to sleep, motioning Ted to do\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nTired as he was, Ted could not bring himself to even think of closing\r\nhis eyes in so insecure a spot, so he sat down on the moss beside her,\r\nunholstered his degravitor, and patting it, indicated that he would\r\nguard her while she slept. She closed her eyes without protest, and\r\npresently the regular rise and fall of her small, shapely bosom\r\nindicated that she was asleep.\r\n\r\nFor several hours Ted amused himself by watching the strange creatures\r\nof the earth, air and water. Giant saurians, with necks gracefully\r\narched, paddled lazily past, sometimes darting their heads with\r\nlightning like rapidity into the water, and usually bringing up fish or\r\nsmall amphibians in their powerful jaws. Small flying reptiles, soaring\r\nlow, sometimes descended to the surface of the water, sometimes dived\r\nbeneath it, triumphantly emerging with living, wriggling food morsels\r\nwhich they usually swallowed as they flew, with little or no\r\nmastication.\r\n\r\nBut tired nature gradually asserted itself, and Ted finally caught\r\nhimself nodding. He shook himself awake, but eventually nodded again,\r\nand thinking to close his eyes for but a moment, slept.\r\n\r\nHis awakening, he knew not how long thereafter, was rude and startling,\r\nfor a warrior clad in glittering silver armor was kneeling on his chest,\r\nholding the point of a keen sword to his throat while two others,\r\nsimilarly accoutred, held his arms against the ground. His first thought\r\nwas for the safety of his girl companion, but a glance showed him that\r\nshe was completely surrounded by a ring of the armored soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          XIV. NOTE OF APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving leaped from Ted’s Blettendorf ahead of his companions, Professor\r\nEderson was unable to see what had become of Roger and Bevans, for his\r\nparachute opened almost instantly, shutting out his view above.\r\n\r\nWhat he did see, however, filled him with apprehension and horror, for\r\nhe was falling directly onto one of the huge globes that had wrought\r\nsuch havoc with the Blettendorf and with the government patrol planes.\r\n\r\nIn vain, he endeavored to sway his body to one side as he hurtled\r\ndownward toward the enemy craft. There was a sudden shock as he struck\r\nthe curved bridge—then his parachute bellied out to a horizontal\r\nposition. Badly shaken though he was, he tried to rise and leap over the\r\nrailing, but at this moment a diamond-shaped door opened, and a rotund\r\nfigure clad in yellow fur and wearing a pagoda shaped helmet with a\r\nglass visor raised, leaped upon him. With a short, curved knife, his\r\nassailant slashed the ropes which bound him to his parachute—then\r\ndragged him inside the globe, slamming a door after him.\r\n\r\nDespite his feeble struggles, for he had been weakened by the shock of\r\nhis fall, his captor bound his wrists behind him and jerked him to his\r\nfeet. Then he pushed him roughly along a narrow hall—opened a\r\ndiamond-shaped door, and flung him into a tiny cell. The door clanged\r\nbehind him as he fell, bruised and half stunned, to the metal floor, and\r\nhe was left alone in stuffy, inky darkness.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay in the black hole, suffering from a dozen bruises and\r\nthe pain of his tightly bound wrists, the professor had no means of\r\nknowing, for his luminous chronometer was on his left wrist, and his\r\nhands were tied behind him.\r\n\r\nHe judged, however, that he had spent slightly more than an hour in the\r\nstuffy room when the door opened. He was jerked to his feet by the\r\nfellow who had captured him, and led down a narrow passageway into a\r\ncommodious cabin where an extremely portly Lunite, whose pagoda-like\r\nhelmet was taller than that of his fellows, sat cross-legged on a raised\r\ndais, examining a scroll which lay on a small, diamond-shaped table\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nHe looked up as the professor was dragged before him, disclosing a\r\npuffy, rotund countenance decorated by a long, thin moustache that\r\ndrooped below the lowest fold of his enormous triple chin. His little,\r\nslanting eyes glittered triumphantly as they took in the figure of the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\n“You have done well, Lin Ching—even better than I thought,” he said,\r\n“for this is the worm who tried to communicate with our great lord,\r\nP’an-ku, after all diplomatic relations had been severed with Du Gong. I\r\nrecognize him from the picture flashed on our screens when he tried to\r\nsend a message to which we refused to respond. He is evidently a\r\nlinguist—perhaps can even speak with us.”\r\n\r\n“If this be true, I will begin by teaching him manners,” said Lin Ching.\r\n“Make obeisance, low and miserable creature of Du Gong, to the mighty\r\nKwan Tsu Khan, commander in chief of the Imperial Navy of P’an-ku.”\r\n\r\n“I am an Am-Er-I-Khan, myself,” replied the professor slowly, in order\r\nthat he might properly use the unaccustomed language, “and make\r\nobeisance to none but the great God of my fathers.”\r\n\r\nThe fat Kwan Tsu Khan rubbed his chubby hands together and actually\r\nbeamed.\r\n\r\n“Better and better, Lin Ching,” he said “You have captured a great as\r\nwell as a wise man.” He turned to the professor. “How did you learn our\r\nlanguage, Am-Er-I-Khan?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“By studying the modern speech and ancient manuscripts of the\r\ndescendants of that P’an-ku who, thousands of years ago, journeyed from\r\nyour world to mine,” replied the professor.\r\n\r\n“Bring a cushion for the Khan from Du Gong, and cut his bonds,” ordered\r\nKwan Tsu Khan. “Then retire outside the door, that we may hold private\r\nconverse.”\r\n\r\nLin Ching drew his sharp knife and severed the bonds which held the\r\nprofessor’s numbed wrists behind his back. Then he brought a great,\r\nthick cushion which he placed on the floor behind his captive, and\r\nassisted him to sit down. After a deep obeisance toward the dais, he\r\nretired to the passageway, closing the diamond-shaped door after him.\r\n\r\n“Now, Am-Er-I-Khan,” said Kwan Tsu Khan, “just how much do you know\r\nabout the history of that great and worshipful P’an-ku who journeyed to\r\nyour world so long ago? And what can you tell me of his descendants?”\r\n\r\n“I have only conjectured that such a person existed and traveled to our\r\nworld,” replied the professor, chafing his numbed wrists. “Even his\r\ndescendants, who are today numerous as the celestial stars, refer to him\r\nonly as the first man, their first ancestor. It was by combining the\r\nstatements in your message to us with the traditions of the descendants\r\nof P’an-ku and noting the easily recognized racial resemblance as well\r\nas the philological similarity, that I formed my theory.”\r\n\r\n“Your conjecture,” said Kwan Tsu Khan, “must be correct, for our most\r\nancient records tell of the journey of one of the mightiest of our\r\nP’an-kus to Du Gong, after our terrific battle with Lu Gong had vitiated\r\nour surface atmosphere to such an extent that life on Ma Gong was\r\nimpossible except in the deepest caves. But nothing was ever heard from\r\nP’an-ku thereafter, and it was thought that he lost his life in the\r\nattempt to reach Du Gong.”\r\n\r\n“That is interesting,” answered the professor. “I understand that you\r\nrefer to your world as Ma Gong, and to mine as Du Gong, but may I ask\r\nwhat Lu Gong is?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Lu Gong is the world which circles the great Lord Sun in an orbit\r\njust outside that of Du Gong—the world which appears red to your\r\nwatchers of the sky.”\r\n\r\n“Then Lu Gong is the world we call Mars,” said the professor. “And you\r\nhave a tradition of a war with Mars?”\r\n\r\n“We have more than a tradition. Our world carries the scars of that war,\r\nand will carry them to eternity.”\r\n\r\n“I should be interested in hearing about it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, but I can only review it briefly, as time presses. Many\r\nthousands of years ago our world was a planet with its own orbit, which\r\nwas midway between that of your world and Lu Gong, or Mars, as you call\r\nit. It rotated on its axis, even as do your planet and Lu Gong, and its\r\ndays and nights were shorter and its years longer than your own are\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n“For millions of years my people had inhabited and dominated Ma\r\nGong—developing a high civilization, and scientists who had explored the\r\ninfinitely small and the infinitely great. Our interplanetary vehicles\r\nhad traveled to and explored the other worlds that served the Great Lord\r\nSun, as well as their numerous satellites, and on some of these we found\r\nhuman beings, but on none but Lu Gong did we find beings with a culture\r\nthat even approached our own.\r\n\r\n“Soon a regular freight and passenger line was in service between Ma\r\nGong and Lu Gong, and we traded and visited with that accursed race of\r\nslim, white beings in all friendliness. Then they sent a colony of their\r\npale people to live on Ma Gong, and we sent a colony of our own people\r\nto settle on Lu Gong. From the start these white colonists made trouble.\r\nPresently blood was shed, reprisals followed, and things went so far\r\nthat war was eventually declared between the two worlds—a war which\r\nwiped out the people of Lu Gong, and most of the people of Ma\r\nGong—destroying also, the culture of a million years on our world.\r\n\r\n“The terrific weapons which the people of Lu Gong used were huge\r\nclusters of meteoroids which they hurled at us, after condensing them in\r\ninterplanetary space by bringing into play certain magnetic lines of\r\nforce which they were able to control. The face of our world still bears\r\nthe hideous dents where these clusters fell. Many wiped out millions of\r\nhelpless people, destroying the work of centuries. The interplanetary\r\nfleets, battling with their rays—ours green, those of Lu Gong\r\nred—practically destroyed each other.\r\n\r\n“Our people were unable to condense and hurl meteoric matter as the\r\npeople of Lu Gong did, but they were not lacking in scientific\r\nknowledge, and the great P’an-ku who ruled them at the time set up great\r\nray projectors clear around our world, several of which were constantly\r\ntrained on the enemy planet. The purpose of these rays was to destroy\r\nthe atmosphere of Lu Gong, dissipating it into interplanetary space, and\r\neventually stifling all the inhabitants of that world.\r\n\r\n“The worst drawback to this method of warfare was that it slowly\r\nvitiated our own atmosphere where the beams passed through it, and thus\r\nconstituted a system of slow suicide.\r\n\r\n“No quarter was asked, and there was none given on either side.\r\nMeanwhile our scientists, who had succeeded experimentally in slightly\r\nperturbing the motion of our world around the sun, asked permission of\r\nP’an-ku to construct a huge electro-magnetic power plant with which they\r\nmight control the motion of Ma Gong at will, and thus dodge the huge\r\nmissiles of Lu Gong which were daily wiping out our cities and\r\ndecimating our population. He granted them permission, and they soon\r\nincreased the number of their power units to such a degree that they\r\nwere ready to try to control the orbit of Ma Gong.\r\n\r\n“The units worked, and the plan was to move Ma Gong behind your world,\r\nwhere it would be shielded from the bombardment of meteoric clusters.\r\nThis was accomplished, but when the proper place had been reached, the\r\nscientists came in contact with terrific magnetic forces on which they\r\nhad not counted—their power units were incapacitated, and they found\r\nthemselves not only bound to the Great Lord Sun, but to your world as\r\nwell. Ma Gong’s axial rotation was affected, so it eventually became as\r\nyou now observe it. Its orbit, after it settled down, was much as it is\r\ntoday, so that it was now behind your world, now racing ahead on an\r\nouter curve, now lagging behind on an inner one, only to be caught up at\r\na certain point and jerked forward once more to repeat the whole\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n“The bombardment from Lu Gong continued until both worlds were nearly\r\nwithout people to carry on the battle. P’an-ku, himself, was slain when\r\nthe imperial city was destroyed by a meteoric cluster. The atmosphere of\r\nMa Gong became so thin that the few people who remained alive did so\r\nbecause they retreated into the great inner caverns where what remained\r\nof the atmosphere had flown like water flows—toward the source of\r\ngravitational pull.\r\n\r\n“The operators of the great ray projectors finally died at their posts\r\nfor want of air. The bombardment from Lu Gong gradually waned as its\r\ninhabitants succumbed to the power of our ray projectors, until it\r\nceased altogether.\r\n\r\n“Only a few hundreds of our people were left alive in the great caverns,\r\nand there was not among them one scientist—for the scientists had all\r\ndied in defense of our world. So far as scientific knowledge went, the\r\nrace was thus set back for thousands of years. The simple people who had\r\nfled to the caves—for the most part agriculturalists and tradesmen—knew\r\nnot how to construct an interplanetary vehicle, a green ray projector,\r\nan atmosphere disintegrator, or any of the thousands of useful but\r\nintricate devices formerly made by† the scientists. They were forced to\r\nbegin with simpler things and gradually build a new civilization and a\r\nnew school of scientists.\r\n\r\n“Even the libraries, which would have been of inestimable value to them,\r\nwere on the airless surface of Ma Gong where they could not be reached,\r\nand most of these had been destroyed by the meteoric clusters projected\r\nfrom Lu Gong. The others succumbed to age and the incessant battering of\r\nplanetesimal particles which followed the destruction of our atmosphere,\r\nbefore they could be reached.\r\n\r\n“The eldest son of P’an-ku, who became P’an-ku at the death of his\r\nfather, had been commander in chief of our interplanetary war fleets,\r\nand had been taken prisoner by the ruler of Lu Gong. He had left a wife\r\nwith child, and she fled with the few hundreds who were the progenitors\r\nof our present race into the great caverns of our world. There a male\r\nchild was born to her, and as he was the eldest son of that P’an-ku who\r\nnever came back to us, he was the hereditary ruler of my people, and his\r\ndescendants have directed their destinies ever since.\r\n\r\n“Nearly a thousand years after the great war, our ancestors, who had\r\nmultiplied in numbers and increased in knowledge, were able to construct\r\nsuits in which they could explore the surface of our world, breathing\r\nair which was concentrated in tanks they carried with them. While\r\nsearching the ruins of the ancient capital of P’an-ku, they came upon a\r\nmetal cylinder which contained a message left there by his eldest son a\r\nthousand years before. It stated that he had escaped from Lu Gong, as\r\nthere were none left alive there to detain him, and had come to Ma Gong\r\nin his one man space flyer, only to find his world destitute of people\r\nand untenable because of its lack of atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“He stated that he was leaving for Du Gong—that world inhabited, in\r\nthose days, by strange monsters and savage peoples, and that he would\r\nnever have deserted Ma Gong had he found but a single one of his\r\nsubjects alive, but that he could no longer stay in a dead world when\r\nthere was a chance that he might find life and an empire in a live one.\r\nIn closing, he implored the Great Lord Sun to pardon him for† this\r\ndesire to live and, if possible, perpetuate his race and his imperial\r\nline.”\r\n\r\n“But what of the white race which now inhabits Ma Gong?” asked the\r\nprofessor. “Whence did they come?”\r\n\r\n“About twelve hundred years after the great war,” said Kwan Tsu Khan, “a\r\nparty of our ancestors who were exploring the surface of our world, met\r\na party of white people, descendants of the Lu Gong colonists they\r\nafterward learned, who had fled to the inner caverns during the great\r\nwar. They, too, had invented heat proof, cold proof suits and\r\nconcentrated air tanks which enabled them to travel on the crust of our\r\nworld. A parley was started, but because of the great hatred between the\r\ntwo races, a quarrel quickly became a battle, and only a few of the\r\nexplorers from either side returned to tell their stories to their\r\nrespective countrymen.\r\n\r\n“This started a war between the two races once more, and my people were\r\nconquered because, while the enemy had succeeded in manufacturing their\r\nred ray projectors, our scientists had been unable, thus far, to\r\nreproduce the green ray projectors of their ancestors. For hundreds of\r\nyears thereafter the heirs of P’an-ku ruled only as viceroys for the\r\nemperors of the white race. This lasted until half a century ago, when\r\nour people were freed by a magnanimous and peace loving ruler of the\r\nwhite people named Mazo Khan. The languages of the two races were,\r\nmeanwhile, fused into one, which is now the universal speech of Ma Gong.\r\n\r\n“Our scientists had been quietly at work for centuries, endeavoring to\r\nregain the secret of the green ray, as well as to reconstruct\r\ninterplanetary vehicles as efficient as those of their ancestors. When\r\nthey were set free by the magnanimous Mazo Khan work went on with\r\nredoubled vigor and, as you see, we now have both.\r\n\r\n“The present ruler of the white race, who still calls herself ‘Maza of\r\nMa Gong,’ the hereditary title of the supreme ruler of Ma Gong, is the\r\ngranddaughter of the man who set us free, and even though she may desire\r\nto once more enslave us, she cannot do so because we now have the green\r\nray and the interplanetary vehicles.\r\n\r\n“We, on our part, could enslave her and her people only† by a terrific\r\nloss of life on both sides, so we prefer to leave her unmolested as long\r\nas she does not bother us, and extend our conquests along lines of less\r\nresistance for the present. Of course we must conquer her people\r\neventually, for there cannot be two rulers of Ma Gong, but the time is\r\nnot yet ripe.\r\n\r\n“The arrested motion of the vehicle tells me that we are now at our\r\ndestination, so I must leave the globe for a while. If you will give me\r\nyour word that you will not attempt to escape I will permit you the\r\nfreedom of my ship.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” asked the professor.\r\n\r\n“We are in the capital city of the descendants of that P’an-ku who\r\nvisited your world many thousands of years ago. I am to meet some of his\r\ndescendants in conference.”\r\n\r\n“I will give you my word not to try to escape,” said the professor.\r\n\r\n“Very well. So long as you stay on the ship you will be unmolested.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button in the wall behind him, and Lin Ching instantly\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n“You will permit the wise Khan, Am-Er-I, the freedom of the ship, Lin\r\nChing,” he said, “but you will see that he is either recaptured or\r\nkilled if he attempts to leave it.”\r\n\r\n“Lin Ching hears, and Lin Ching obeys,” replied that individual, bowing\r\nthe professor out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe professor strolled around the ship, examining its interior with\r\nconsiderable interest. Then he opened one of the diamond-shaped doors,\r\nand stepped out onto the bridge—instantly recognizing a section of\r\nPeiping with which he was familiar. He saw that the other two flying\r\nglobes hovered near the one he was on and that several Lunites were\r\ndescending each of the swaying ladders which hung down from the\r\ninterplanetary vehicles.\r\n\r\nHe was gazing idly down at the crowd which milled in the street below\r\nhim, when he suddenly spied a familiar face looking curiously up at him.\r\nA smile of recognition crossed the face of the Chinaman in the crowd\r\nbeneath, but the professor instantly made a gesture of caution and then\r\nindicated that he wanted his friend to wait below him.\r\n\r\nHastily jerking pencil and notebook from his pocket, the professor\r\nquickly wrote a short note in Chinese characters. It was addressed to\r\nGeneral Fu Yen, its contents as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I am a prisoner on a lunar globe, and have given my word of honor\r\n  that I will not try to escape while here. I have not, however, made\r\n  any promise that I will not write notes to my friends.\r\n\r\n  “My captors are now negotiating with your government for the purpose\r\n  of finally signing the agreement which will make your people the\r\n  subjects of a round-bodied monarch who calls himself P’an-ku, and\r\n  rules a race which inhabits the moon.\r\n\r\n  “Your people have fought and bled for freedom and a voice in their\r\n  government. Are they going to renounce all this now? You, and you\r\n  only, my friend, can save them. Act quickly if you would not be too\r\n  late.\r\n\r\n                                  Sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                          Geo. Ederson.”\r\n\r\nCrumpling the note into a ball, the professor called softly to the man\r\nbelow, who instantly took off his large helmet and held it upside down.\r\nInto this wide, inverted bowl, the professor dropped the note.\r\n\r\n“For Fu Yen,” he called, softly.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman nodded, pocketed the note, replaced his hat on his head,\r\nand moved away, a part of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThen, with unexpected suddenness, vise-like fingers closed on the neck\r\nof the professor, and he was shaken like a rat.\r\n\r\n“Worm,” grated a voice in his ear. “Tell me what you tossed to that\r\nperson in the crowd, or by the Great Lord Sun, you shall not live to say\r\naught else.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            XV. MOON TRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAwakened with each of his arms pinned to the ground by an armored\r\nwarrior and the sword of a third who knelt on his chest menacing his\r\nthroat, Ted blinked dazedly and wondered if he was indeed awake, or only\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\nThen he heard the voice of Maza utter a sharp command.\r\n\r\nThe three warriors instantly released him and stood at attention as he\r\nrose unsteadily to his feet. Evidently these were her own soldiers who\r\nhad mistaken him for an enemy. Their white skins and non-Mongoloid\r\nfeatures showed that they were not of the race of P’an-ku.\r\n\r\nAt a second command from the girl the men filed down to the water’s\r\nedge, where a long, low craft constructed of white metal, was moored. It\r\nwas fashioned in the shape of a flying dragon like the one he had seen\r\nthe girl riding some time before, the metallic wings held upward with\r\nedges closing at the top to make a fantastic roof for the cabin. As it\r\nwas without rudder, oars or paddles, Ted was puzzled as to its means of\r\nlocomotion.\r\n\r\nBeckoning him to follow, the girl leaped lightly aboard. As the earth\r\nman stepped in after her, one of the warriors pushed off and another,\r\nseated in the prow before a small keyboard, pressed several buttons with\r\nhis fingers. There was a roar from the rear of the craft and it shot\r\nbackward into midstream. The helmsman pressed another row of buttons and\r\nthe boat started down stream with a louder roar and a terrific burst of\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nMaking his way astern, Ted saw that the boat was both propelled and\r\nsteered by two sets of three jointed pipes each, which extended from the\r\nback of the boat under water. Something, either highly compressed air or\r\nsome other gas, rushed out of each pipe as the correct button was\r\ntouched by the operator, and the wake, as a result, was a mass of\r\nseething bubbles. To turn right or left the helmsman had only to shut\r\noff the set of pipes on the side toward which he wished to go. To\r\nreverse the boat, he but needed to press buttons which bent the flexible\r\njointed ends of the pipes downward and toward the front, thus reversing\r\nthe direction of the pressure.\r\n\r\nGoing forward once more, Ted crouched by the side of the girl and\r\nwatched the queer lunar scenery hurtle past them. The boat, he judged,\r\nmust be making at least a hundred miles an hour, so his glimpses of the\r\nqueer, subterranean flora and fauna were but cursory. The phosphorescent\r\nvegetation with its eerie luminosity persisted as league after league of\r\nthe winding stream was left behind them. Gigantic flying reptiles\r\nsometimes darted downward at the boat, but invariably underestimated its\r\ngreat speed, striking the water from one to two hundred feet behind it,\r\nthen rising to flap lazily and disgustedly away in search of other less\r\nelusive quarry.\r\n\r\nAfter they had traveled in this manner for nearly six hours the helmsman\r\nsuddenly reversed his power, bringing the craft to a stop before two\r\nhuge, heavily barred gates which extended from the bottom of the stream\r\nto the surface of a great arch of masonry that marked the beginning of a\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nA warrior in the stern then struck a gong three times, and the gates\r\nslowly swung back, whereupon the boat entered the tunnel, which was\r\nlighted from above by a soft, phosphorescent radiance that emanated from\r\nhemispherical dome lights placed at regular intervals. Armored guards\r\nwith long spears in their hands, and swords and ray projectors strapped\r\nto their belts, stood on each side of the gateway before small block\r\nhouses. Ted noticed that they reversed their spears and bent the knee as\r\nthe boat passed—evidently the military obeisance to their ruler.\r\n\r\nThree more gates, similarly guarded, were opened for them at distances\r\nof about a quarter of a mile apart along the tunnel. Then Ted saw, a\r\nshort distance ahead, a fifth gate through which a flood of bright light\r\npoured. This gate, too, opened in response to three strokes of the gong,\r\nand the boat emerged into an open stream once more.\r\n\r\nA few buildings of white stone dotted the banks of the stream, which\r\nappeared to be under cultivation. Each of the buildings was surmounted\r\nby an enormous metal contrivance supported by a shaft that projected\r\nupward from the center of the roof, and was shaped like an umbrella\r\nturned inside out. That these were for the purpose of capturing and in\r\nsome way utilizing the sun’s energy, Ted did not doubt.\r\n\r\nNoticing that all were tilted at precisely the same angle, he glanced\r\nupward to note the position of the sun, only to meet with a new\r\nsurprise, for the entire valley into which they had come, nearly ten\r\nmiles in width at this point, was roofed over with a vault of glass,\r\nfitted in large frames and braced with elaborately constructed metal\r\narches. The nearer walls of the valley rose, sheer and rugged, for about\r\ntwo miles. The farther walls were shrouded in blue mist that made them\r\nbarely discernible.\r\n\r\nPresently the boat stopped at a dock which projected out over the water\r\nfrom the side of a large building surmounted by a tall, round tower.\r\nFour taut cables, stretching from a row of similar towers about a mile\r\nto the left, passed through a great arched opening near the top of the\r\ntower, continuing through a row of towers, the first of which was about\r\na mile to the right.\r\n\r\nTwo attendants saluted with bent knees and bowed heads, then held the\r\nboat while Maza and Ted stepped out.\r\n\r\nThey entered a building and passed through a large, arched room where a\r\nnumber of men, women and children bent the knee as Maza passed. A few of\r\nthe men wore armor and carried weapons, but the greater number appeared\r\nto be civilians. Among these, the men wore brightly colored sleeveless\r\ncloth jackets that reached to their thighs and were belted about the\r\nwaist, and which included nearly all the colors of the rainbow. They\r\nwere bare armed and bare legged, and many were bare footed, although a\r\nfew wore coarse sandals of plaited grass held by strands of grass rope.\r\n\r\nThe women were uniformly attired in white, clinging garments of\r\ntranslucent material that half revealed, half concealed their forms, and\r\nTed was struck by this contrast to earthly customs where women dress\r\nbrightly and men usually wear somber colors.\r\n\r\nThe very small children romped about quite naked. Those a little older\r\nwore breech clouts, and the larger imitated their elders according to\r\ntheir sexes.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed this room, Maza and Ted entered a lift which quickly\r\nwhisked them to the place near the top of the tower which he had\r\npreviously noticed, and through which the four cables were stretched.\r\nSuspended on overhead wheels from one of these cables was a\r\nbullet-shaped car of white metal with transparent panels in the sides\r\nand a sliding door near the center, which had apparently been held\r\nawaiting their coming.\r\n\r\nAn attendant closed the door after them as they stepped in and sank into\r\nluxuriously cushioned seats. Then the vehicle started smoothly,\r\naccelerating rapidly until Ted computed that they were going at least\r\nfour hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAs hour after hour slipped by and their speed continued unabated, Ted\r\nwondered at the great length of the valley. He consulted his wrist\r\ncompass and noticed that they were traveling toward the southeast. The\r\nvalley appeared quite uniform in width, and although there were a few\r\nwooded areas was, for the most part, apparently under cultivation. Most\r\nof the farms were irrigated by small ditches which branched out from a\r\nbroad canal that extended down the center of the valley, and was fed\r\nfrom time to time, by streams which flowed through tunnels in the rocky\r\nwalls on either side. Men and women were at work in the fields, some\r\nusing farm machinery of unknown motive power, some assisted by\r\ndragon-like draft animals, and others using only hand tools.\r\n\r\nNoticing that Ted was apparently trying to compute the distance and\r\ndirection they had traveled, his companion took a rolled parchment from\r\na pocket in the wall. It proved to be a map of the moon. She spread it\r\nout before them and pointed to the longest known lunar ray—the one which\r\nextends from the crater, Tycho, near the bottom of the southeast\r\nquadrant of the moon, curves across the southwest and northwest\r\nquadrants, and ends near the north pole in the _Mare Frigoris_.\r\n\r\nWith the pink tip of her dainty forefinger she indicated their start at\r\nthe crater Hipparchus, their underground trip to the glassed over crack\r\nor valley in the moon’s surface which terrestrial astronomers had always\r\nreferred to as “one of the rays of Tycho,” and the distance they had\r\ntraveled since they entered the cable railway. She then pointed to Tycho\r\nand said: “Ultu.”\r\n\r\nTed understood from this that Tycho or “Ultu” was their destination, and\r\nwas probably a subterranean lunar city. As Ultu was the center of the\r\nmost extensive ray system on the moon, Ted assumed that it was probably\r\nthe capital of one of the most populous nations.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished with the map, Ted took a note book and pencil\r\nfrom his pocket and wrote some of the Lunite words he had learned from\r\nthe translation of Professor Ederson. The girl helped him to construct\r\nand pronounce sentences, indicating meanings by signs and by drawing\r\npictures. Then Ted, in turn, helped his fair companion with her English.\r\nThus the time was passed pleasantly until their arrival in Ultu.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the great central station, from which cable railways\r\nradiated in all directions, and Maza stepped out of the car, her easy\r\ncamaraderie disappeared, and Ted saw her on her dignity as a royal\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nEvidently the news of her escape from capture at the hands of P’an-ku\r\nhad become the common property of all of her subjects, as the huge\r\nterminal was crowded with people and the city streets around it were so\r\nchoked with human beings that all traffic had been suspended. Two files\r\nof soldiers held open a lane for her as she walked down from the landing\r\nplatform to where a number of gorgeously decked individuals who sparkled\r\nwith jewels, some in shining armor and others in civilian attire, waited\r\nto greet her with bent knees and what Ted took to be fervent\r\nexclamations of joy at her deliverance. These were evidently the great\r\ncivil and military dignitaries of her realm.\r\n\r\nBehind the lines of soldiers, the common people were equally\r\ndemonstrative. Many of the men as well as the women, wept for joy. It\r\nwas plain to be seen that the young ruler was as popular as she was\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nUntil they had reached the great arched opening which led to the street,\r\nTed had walked behind Maza in company with two of her most magnificently\r\nattired nobles. When they reached this point, however, she took his arm\r\nand holding one hand aloft, addressed the people. To the surprise of\r\nTed, they all burst into loud cheering when she had finished, and the\r\ngreat nobles crowded around him, jostling each other for the honor of\r\nkissing his hand. It was evident that he had been given quite favorable\r\nmention for his part in her rescue from the soldiers of P’an-ku and the\r\nflying reptile.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the steps a carriage magnificently decked in silver and\r\ncrimson and drawn by two wingless dragons awaited the Princess. She kept\r\nTed’s arm, and together they descended the stairs. He assisted her into\r\nthe carriage, but hesitated to enter until she took his hand and drew\r\nhim in after her.\r\n\r\nA path was instantly cleared for them by the soldiers, and the two great\r\nreptiles that had appeared so huge and awkward started away at a fast\r\nclip.\r\n\r\nA few minutes ride took them to the imperial palace—an imposing building\r\nof shining black stone set in white metal in lieu of mortar.\r\n\r\nHere Ted’s companion turned him over to a pompous appearing chamberlain\r\nwho conducted him to a sumptuous private suite. A young, but well\r\ntrained valet assisted him to remove his armor and drew a bath for him.\r\nAfter a refreshing bath and a shave, he was given a suit of shimmering\r\ngolden yellow fabric trimmed with black binding, of a style worn by the\r\nnobles of the court. Then his attendant strapped comfortable, soft soled\r\nsandals on his feet, and buckled his belt containing his degravitors and\r\npocket pouch, about his waist.\r\n\r\nPresently the pompous chamberlain appeared at the door and beckoned to\r\nhim. He followed the officer, who led him through a maze of hallways\r\ninto a large, arched throne room, where Maza, attired in the gleaming\r\nwhite metal in which he had first seen her with his radiovisiphone—her\r\ngolden hair held by a band of platinum-like metal powdered with\r\nglistening jewels—presided on a throne of scarlet and silver that was\r\nraised on a dias at one end of the room.\r\n\r\nStanding at respectful attention on either side of the throne were her\r\nguards, men and women attendants, and notables both civil and military.\r\n\r\nAs he advanced beside the chamberlain, Ted noticed a familiar figure\r\nstanding at the left near the foot of the throne—a venerable graybeard\r\nwho wore a richly embroidered robe of dark blue. He instantly recognized\r\nhim as the old man who had been with the princess when he had tried, for\r\nthe second time, to communicate with the moon by radiovisiphone.\r\n\r\nThe court officer, having conducted him before the throne, bowed low and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nAlthough gracious and smiling, Maza was dignified, as befitted a royal\r\nprincess at a formal audience. With such English words as she could\r\nmuster, she introduced Ted to all the notables in turn, each of whom\r\nbowed low as his name was pronounced. The last one to be presented was\r\nthe venerable graybeard.\r\n\r\n“Ted Dustin, greatest scientist of Du Gong,” she said “give _di\r\ntcha-tsi_ to Vanible Khan, greatest scientist of Ma Gong.”\r\n\r\n“_Di tcha-tsi_,” said Ted, uttering this unintelligible word of greeting\r\nbecause it seemed the thing to do.\r\n\r\n“_Di tcha-tsi na mu_,” replied the great Lunite, bowing profoundly.\r\n\r\n“Vanible Khan, you will instruct Ted Dustin in our language, then report\r\nto me,” commanded Maza.\r\n\r\nMaking profound obeisance, the old man motioned Ted to follow him, and\r\nthey departed. In the suite which had been assigned to him, Ted began\r\nhis lessons that day. His slight knowledge of the Lunite language and\r\nVanible Khan’s slight knowledge of English helped them greatly at the\r\nstart. He learned that “_di tcha-tsi_” meant “no challenge” or “peace”\r\nand “_na mu_” was translated “to you.”\r\n\r\nFor two days the two scientists pursued their linguistic studies,\r\nstopping only to eat and sleep. Each found the other such an apt pupil\r\nthat they progressed with amazing rapidity. Toward the end of the second\r\nday, Vanible Khan said:\r\n\r\n“Come with me. I have something to show you.”\r\n\r\nTogether they went to the palace courtyard, where two flying dragons\r\nwere saddled and ready for them.\r\n\r\n“To direct your mount,” said Vanible Khan, “simply use our words for the\r\nright or left, up or down, or straight. The beast will proceed\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\nBoth men mounted.\r\n\r\n“Up,” commanded Vanible Khan. “Up,” shouted Ted, and both beasts after\r\nrunning forward for a short distance with outspread wings, took to the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThey presently alighted before a large building near the outskirts of\r\nthe city, and leaving their mounts in charge of an attendant, entered a\r\ngreat, arched doorway.\r\n\r\nTed found himself in one of the largest factories he had ever seen.\r\nHundreds of bullet shaped cars of a kind he had ridden in with Maza on\r\nhis trip to Ultu were here being manufactured or repaired by thousands\r\nof busy workers.\r\n\r\nHe cried out in pleased surprise when he suddenly spied his own\r\ninterplanetary vehicle. Evidently it had been brought in by the order of\r\nMaza, and had just arrived, for workmen were removing chains by which it\r\nhad been carried.\r\n\r\n“We have many skilled mechanics here,” said Vanible Khan. “If your flier\r\ncan be repaired, you have but to command us.”\r\n\r\n“Summon a headman,” said Ted, “and I will show him what to do.”\r\n\r\nWhile the chief mechanic was being brought, Ted quickly took pad and\r\npencil from his belt pouch and drew diagrams of the missing parts. Under\r\nhis and Ted’s joint direction, with linguistic assistance when\r\nnecessary, from Vanible Khan, the wreckage of the prow was cut away and\r\norders were put through for the missing parts.\r\n\r\n“In two days your flier will be ready,” said the chief mechanic, when he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, when Ted, in company with Vanible Khan, called at the\r\nfactory, he entered the cab, and closing it, flew about under the great\r\narched roof of the factory. The motor and controls worked perfectly.\r\nDelighted, he returned to the assembling floor, invited his fellow\r\nscientist into the cab, and darting out of the large doorway, flew with\r\nhim to the roof of the palace in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely alighted from the craft when a messenger hurried\r\nbreathlessly up to them, and bowed low.\r\n\r\n“Her Imperial Majesty summons your lordships to the observation room, at\r\nonce,” he said. “The people of Du Gong are in deadly peril.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            XVI. TED ATTACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nTed and his companion, Vanible Khan, hurried down a maze of stairways\r\nand hallways until they arrived in a large, square room, the walls of\r\nwhich were divided into panels. On each panel was a moving picture which\r\nseemed to shine through from the rear. An operator sat at a switchboard\r\nin the center of the room, pressing various buttons on the instrument\r\nbefore him from time to time.\r\n\r\nMaza was there with two of her gigantic guards, and several of her\r\noldest counselors. She pointed to one of the panels as they entered.\r\n\r\n“P’an-ku is attacking your people with a terrible weapon, Ted Dustin,”\r\nshe said. “Look.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at the panel she indicated, and saw as through a powerful\r\ntelescope, a side view of the great lunar crater which he had learned to\r\nrecognize as Copernicus. Shooting upward from the center of the crater\r\nwas a bright band of green light.\r\n\r\n“Now look at this picture,” continued Maza, pointing to another panel.\r\n\r\nHe looked, and saw a telescopic view of the earth. Despite the many\r\nstorm areas which hid outlines of land and water, he made out the shape\r\nof North America, and saw that Washington and the territory surrounding\r\nit were in an immense spot of green light.\r\n\r\n“What can those rays do at that distance?” he asked Vanible Khan.\r\n\r\n“That,” replied the lunar scientist, thoughtfully stroking his long\r\nwhite beard, “depends wholly on the power of the ray projector which\r\nP’an-ku is employing. If powerful enough, the green rays will contract\r\nand destroy all matter which they come in contact. When nearly spent,\r\nthey still have the power to remove much of the heat from everything\r\nthey touch. I should say, off hand, that the area they reach at present\r\nis intensely cold—perhaps even uninhabitable for human beings.”\r\n\r\nTed turned suddenly to Maza.\r\n\r\n“May I have a glass helmet and a suit of insulated armor?” he asked. “My\r\nown suit is useless until I can fit a new helmet to it.”\r\n\r\n“You may, of course. But where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“To destroy that green ray projector.”\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand of my _nak-kar_ cavalry will fly with you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You are very kind to offer help,” he replied, “but I prefer to go\r\nalone. This is my war and my people are being killed.”\r\n\r\n“You refuse?” He could see that she was nettled.\r\n\r\n“I decline with sincere thanks, if you please. Time is precious, and in\r\nmy vehicle I can reach the projector before your flying beasts are well\r\non the way, thereby saving many lives which otherwise might be\r\nsacrificed by delay.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. It is your war now, because I have not yet officially\r\ndeclared war on P’an-ku. I will do so immediately. Then, if we cannot be\r\nallies, I will fight him in my way and you in yours.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to one of the armored nobles who stood nearby.\r\n\r\n“See that Ted Dustin is outfitted for surface flying at once,” she\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, Ted stood on the roof of the palace attired in\r\nthe bell-like glass helmet and white, wooly, insulated armor of Maza’s\r\npeople. He fidgeted impatiently while a great _nak-kar_ was being\r\nsaddled in order that its rider might guide him up through one of the\r\nhuge and tortuous air shafts which led from the subterranean city of\r\nUltu to the ringed plain of Tycho above.\r\n\r\nAt his side stood Vanible Khan, stroking his long white beard and coolly\r\nsupervising the preparations. When the flying dragon was saddled and its\r\nrider seated, the old scientist placed his hand on Ted’s shoulder, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“You are taking desperate chances, boy. It is doubtful if you will ever\r\nget near enough to the projector to destroy it, but if you do you will\r\nalmost certainly be killed. I bid you farewell, and my prayers and those\r\nof our people go with you.”\r\n\r\n“I realize the chances and thank you for your good wishes. Goodbye,”\r\nreplied Ted, closing his visor and turning to climb into his craft.\r\n\r\nJust as he placed his foot on the lower step a hand was laid on his arm.\r\nHe turned and saw Maza, flushed and panting from the exertion of\r\nhurriedly climbing to the roof. As he turned and looked down into her\r\neyes he saw they were flashing with anger.\r\n\r\nShe reached up and raised his visor with dainty, pink-tipped fingers.\r\n\r\n“How dare you leave me, Ted Dustin, without saying farewell,” she said.\r\n“Why you might n-never come back.”\r\n\r\nA tear rolled down her velvety cheek, and she shook her fluffy head to\r\ndislodge it.\r\n\r\nHe started to bend over—to kiss her hand. Her eyes softened—drew him to\r\nthe beautiful upturned face. Before he knew what had happened, he was\r\nkissing her, and she was returning his kiss with closed eyes, her arms\r\naround his neck, her small, lithe body close to his.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he released her, leaped into the cab, and signaled the\r\n_nak-kar_ rider that he was ready. He elevated his craft slowly while\r\nthe great dragon clumsily lumbered forward with wings outspread—took to\r\nthe air, and circled upward toward a dark opening above.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flying reptile moved swiftly through the maze of\r\npassageways and caverns, evidently of volcanic origin, which led upward,\r\nit seemed to Ted that their progress was exceedingly slow. The _nak-kar_\r\nrider kept his bright head lamp lighted until they reached the surface,\r\nwhere it was no longer necessary. Then, with a wave of his hand, he\r\nindicated a vertical band of green light which emerged from the\r\nnortheastern horizon, and made a circle of green light on the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nWith an answering wave of farewell, Ted seized the controls and gave the\r\nLunite such an exhibition of speed as must have commanded his awe and\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nFlying high above the moon’s surface in the tenuous lunar atmosphere, he\r\ntraveled at a speed far surpassing that of the bullet cars which the\r\nLunites used in traversing the glazed ray-valleys. As he progressed\r\ntoward Copernicus he noticed that the valleys which radiated from Tycho\r\ngrew fewer and further apart, and that there were other glazed valleys\r\ncoming down from the north. While the former had appeared a glistening\r\nwhite in the sunlight, these latter were yellowish in appearance,\r\nevidently due to the fact that they were roofed with amber instead of\r\nclear glass. The great green ray, the projector of which it was his\r\npurpose to destroy, gave him the exact location of Copernicus and showed\r\nhim that these yellow ray-valleys ramified from that place.\r\n\r\nHe was less than a hundred miles from his objective when the spherical\r\nbulk of a lunar flying globe suddenly loomed ahead. A deadly green ray\r\ninstantly shot toward him, but Ted was now ready to profit by his first\r\nexperience with the war globes of P’an-ku.\r\n\r\nInstead of continuing on his course, he suddenly dropped for a thousand\r\nfeet, and while manipulating his atomotor with his left hand brought a\r\ndegravitor gun into play with his right. His aim was true, and the\r\nforward revolving disc of the flying globe flashed and disappeared when\r\nstruck by the invisible rays. The globe instantly made a half turn and\r\ncommenced a swift nose dive groundward. Before the aft disc could be\r\nreversed, Ted aimed his degravitor at this, also, destroying it\r\ninstantly. A half dozen green rays shot out from various parts of the\r\nglobe, flashing like the spokes of a giant wheel as the craft hurtled to\r\nthe ground—then disappeared as a lurid explosion announced the\r\ndestruction of the ship.\r\n\r\nFearing that, having been seen by the aerial patrol, his presence had\r\nbeen announced by radio, Ted decided to attack at once. He therefore\r\naimed his craft as if it had been a projectile, in a curved trajectory\r\nwhich would carry him at a height of about ten miles over the huge rim\r\nof Copernicus, and downward toward the central source of light. With\r\nboth forward degravitors turned on and the atomotor running at the\r\nmaximum speed possible in the presence of the tenuous atmospheric gases,\r\nthe craft instantly became a terrific missile of destruction.\r\n\r\nSo swiftly did it fly that the view of the rugged, crater-pitted\r\nlandscape beneath became blurred, despite the great size and sharp\r\ndetail of the major formations.\r\n\r\nTed spotted his objective before he was above the great outer ring of\r\nCopernicus. It was the tallest of the five great central mountain peaks\r\nwhich project upward from the floor of the crater. The great green ray\r\nwhich was trained on the earth was coming directly from the tip of this\r\npeak, and the entire crater of the mighty ring mountain was bathed in a\r\nweird green light, evidently reflections of the ray from the glistening\r\nwalls and peaks.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Ted was directly over the southwest rim of the huge crater.\r\nInstantly, he pointed his craft downward, and the invisible rays of the\r\ntwo forward degravitors struck the peak of the tallest inner\r\nmountain—still more than thirty miles away. Even at that distance the\r\ntelltale flash from the mountain top told him that his aim was true.\r\nThen, with degravitors set rigidly in position, he dived straight for\r\nhis target.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the pits beneath, a green ray of ordinary dimensions\r\nsuddenly burst forth. Others flashed out, searching the sky for the\r\nmarauder who had dared this attack on the mighty ray projector of\r\nP’an-ku. But Ted was flying so swiftly and his craft was so high in the\r\nair and so small that it was not easy for the Lunites to locate him. At\r\nthe moment they only knew of his presence because the tip of the\r\nmountain peak which surrounded their green ray projector was rapidly\r\nmelting away under the attack of his invisible rays.\r\n\r\nAs he progressed toward the central peak, Ted noticed that the searching\r\ngreen rays grew thicker and thicker. Suddenly one sheared away the stern\r\nof his craft, and with it the rear atomotor outlets. The crippled\r\nvehicle was carried forward for a few seconds by its own momentum, but\r\ngradually succumbing to the insistent pull of gravity it deviated from\r\nits course—wobbled unsteadily, and began to fall groundward.\r\n\r\nReleasing his now useless atomotor controls, Ted concentrated his\r\nattention on the two forward degravitors. As his ship fell, wobbling\r\nthis way and that, he kept his two ray guns steadily pointed at the\r\nmountain top from which the great green ray emerged. His craft was\r\nfalling with terrific speed when he had the satisfaction of seeing the\r\ngreen ray wink out, and the section of the mountain top containing what\r\nwas left of the projecting machinery, topple over, hurtle down the\r\nmountainside in an avalanche of debris, and crash to the ground in an\r\nenormous cloud of dust and smoke.\r\n\r\nBut he had not noticed his own proximity to the crater floor. There came\r\na sudden shock that smashed the keel of his craft like an egg shell—then\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             XVII. ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding before the big radiovisiphone of the President of the United\r\nStates, in Washington, Roger Sanders waited impatiently for the\r\nsilencing of all terrestrial stations that he might be tuned in with Ted\r\nDustin’s powerful super-station which was to relay a message from the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nPresently the signal: “All clear,” came through, and Roger, looking into\r\nthe disc of the President’s instrument, saw, as if reflected in a\r\nmirror, the huge disc of Ted’s radiovisiphone with the operator seated\r\nbefore it manipulating the dials.\r\n\r\nIndistinct figures appeared a number of times in the pellucid depths of\r\nthe great disc, and there were a few unintelligible sounds. Then it\r\nsuddenly cleared, and Roger and President Whitmore were dazzled, as\r\nbefore, by the appearance of the beautiful Maza with two armored guards\r\nand the aged scientist, Vanible Khan.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of both, Vanible Khan addressed them in English.\r\n\r\n“Despite the powerful interference waves broadcasted by P’an-ku, we have\r\nat last succeeded in breaking through,” he said. “Do I address friends\r\nof Ted Dustin?”\r\n\r\n“You are speaking to his superior, President Whitmore of the United\r\nStates of America, and also to his assistant, Roger Sanders,” replied\r\nRoger.\r\n\r\n“That is indeed fortunate,” said the old scientist, smiling. “I am\r\nVanible Khan, chief scientist of Ma Gong, and speak for Her Imperial\r\nMajesty, Maza an Ma Gong. She bids me inform you that Ted Dustin left\r\nUltu, her capital, which is situated beneath the crater which you on Du\r\nGong call ‘Tycho,’ two revolutions of your planet ago. He went with the\r\navowed intention of destroying the projector of the great green ray\r\nwhich was turned on your world. It appears that he has succeeded in\r\ndestroying the ray, but as he has not returned we assume that he has\r\neither been killed or captured. The ray, as you are no doubt aware, was\r\nprojected from a central peak of the ring mountain which you call\r\nCopernicus. Beneath this mountain is the capital city of P’an-ku, which\r\nis called Peilong.\r\n\r\n“Since the departure of Ted Dustin, Her Majesty has declared war on\r\nP’an-ku. Tonight she will personally conduct a mighty army which will\r\nmarch on Peilong through the subterranean forests. She has not thought\r\nit wise to use her _nak-kars_—the flying beasts which can live for nine\r\nof your days without air—because of their slowness and inefficiency\r\ncompared to P’an-ku’s flying globes.\r\n\r\n“She intends to attack Peilong in five of your days. If you, the friends\r\nof Ted Dustin, have a way to simultaneously strike from above, it is\r\npossible that we may save him or avenge his death, and subdue P’an-ku,\r\nthus bringing about peace between the peoples of Du Gong and the yellow\r\nrace of Ma Gong.\r\n\r\n“Her Majesty awaits your answer.”\r\n\r\n“I have a way,” replied Roger, half turning toward the President as he\r\nspoke. “The powerful interplanetary battleship we are building will be\r\nready in four days. With your permission I will then leave for the moon,\r\nand will attack Peilong in conjunction with the army of Her Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“But what of the flying globes of P’an-ku?” asked the President “He may\r\nhave hundreds of them, in which case your task will be hopeless, and\r\nwe’ll have nobody left to run the Dustin factory.”\r\n\r\n“The factory can run under the directions of our superintendents whether\r\nTed and I are present or not,” replied Roger, “and there will be no\r\nlet-down in production if we never return, as long as money and\r\nmaterials are supplied. As for flying globes, if P’an-ku has thousands\r\nof them, I will still be glad to go, counting it a small sacrifice to\r\nrisk my life in this mighty battleship when Ted has braved the same\r\ndangers in his tiny, one-man flier.”\r\n\r\n“Go then, with my best wishes for a glorious victory and a safe return,”\r\nreplied the President. “If it were not for the demands of the nation\r\nwhich especially require my presence in this crisis, I should like to go\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“You may tell Her Majesty,” said Roger, addressing Vanible Khan, “that I\r\nwill attack P’an-ku from above in five days.”\r\n\r\nMaza evidently understood his reply, for she smiled and spoke for the\r\nfirst time during the interview.\r\n\r\n“In five days, then, Roger Sanders, I will meet you in the imperial\r\npalace at Peilong, and may we be in time to save Ted Dustin.”\r\n\r\nThe disc suddenly became blank, and Roger, after bidding farewell to\r\nPresident Whitmore, hurried away to his electro-plane, which Bevans had\r\nready for the trip to Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XVIII. TORTURE CHAMBERS\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Ederson was small but wiry, and it took him but a moment to\r\nsquirm from the grasp of the Lunite who had seized him from behind after\r\nhe dropped a note addressed to General Fu Yen from the bridge of the\r\nflying globe. Turning, he beheld Lin Ching, his features contorted with\r\nrage. He whipped out a sword, and in his great anger would surely have\r\nbeheaded the professor then and there, had not Kwan Tsu Khan appeared on\r\nthe scene and seized his sword arm from behind.\r\n\r\n“What’s this, Lin Ching?” he asked. “Has the prisoner attempted to\r\nescape, that you threaten his life?”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that, my lord Kwan Tsu Khan,” replied Lin Ching. “The\r\nmiserable worm just dropped something to someone in the crowd and\r\nrefuses to tell me what it was.”\r\n\r\n“I refused nothing,” cut in the professor. “This man came up behind me\r\nand, seizing me by the neck, shook me. As I dislike being shaken, I\r\ntwisted from his grasp.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps then, you will tell _me_ what it was that you dropped to the\r\nperson in the crowd.” said Kwan Tsu Khan.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” replied the professor. “I dropped a note, written to a\r\nfriend of mine who lives here.”\r\n\r\n“And what did the note say?”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied the professor, “is strictly my business.”\r\n\r\n“I will make it _my_ business to find out when I have more time,” said\r\nKwan Tsu Khan with his suave smile. “In the meantime, Lin Ching, put the\r\nprisoner where he can send no more notes. I go, now, to confer with our\r\nallies.”\r\n\r\nLin Ching bowed and grinned. Then he pointed with his sword to the\r\ndiamond-shaped door behind him.\r\n\r\n“Enter, Am-Er-I-Khan,” he commanded, “and follow the passageway until I\r\nbid you halt.”\r\n\r\nThe professor did as he was told, and was eventually stopped before a\r\ndoor near the opposite side of the globe.\r\n\r\nTaking a bunch of keys from his belt pouch, Lin Ching unlocked the door,\r\nthen bade his prisoner enter.\r\n\r\nThe savant found himself in a small, windowless room, faintly\r\nilluminated by a tiny dome light overhead. In the center of the room was\r\na chair, suspended on powerful coil springs. Other springs connected it\r\nto the floor, and still others to the walls on four sides.\r\n\r\n“Be seated,” ordered Lin Ching.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the professor seated himself in the chair than his captor\r\nproceeded to strap him down securely. His hands were so fastened to the\r\narms of the chair that he was unable to reach the fastenings of the\r\nstraps which held his body, legs and feet.\r\n\r\nHaving completed his work, Lin Ching stood back with arms akimbo and\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n“His lordship will make you glad to talk when he returns,” he said. “In\r\nthe meantime I wish you pleasant and profound meditations.”\r\n\r\nWith that, he stepped out and closed and locked the door. A moment later\r\nthe dome light snapped off, and the savant was left, alone and helpless,\r\nin total darkness.\r\n\r\nHow long he hung there in his suspended chair in complete silence the\r\nprofessor had no means of knowing. Suddenly, however, sounds came to him\r\nwhich indicated that projectiles of some sort were striking the outer\r\nshell of the craft. Despite his predicament, he smiled to himself in the\r\ndarkness, for this was, he felt sure, the reply of his friend, General\r\nFu Yen to his hastily written note.\r\n\r\nHe felt the craft dart suddenly upward a short time thereafter, and was\r\nthankful for the coiled springs which surrounded his chair. Had they not\r\nbeen there to absorb the shock, he would have been badly injured if not\r\nkilled outright by so sudden a movement of the globe.\r\n\r\nFor some time he could sense the quick movements of the craft hither and\r\nthither, while projectiles rattled intermittently against its armor.\r\nThen it settled down to a swift sustained flight and the bombardment\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThe even flight was maintained for several hours. Then projectiles\r\nrattled once more against the shell of the craft. This second\r\nbombardment lasted for perhaps five minutes. Then the globe shot\r\nsuddenly upward with such terrific speed that, protected though he was\r\nby the coiled springs, the professor lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen he regained his senses once more, the savant was being unstrapped\r\nfrom his chair by Lin Ching. Another Lunite was holding a bottle of some\r\npungent smelling liquid beneath his nostrils. The sharp fumes smarted\r\nthem, and he jerked his head back to escape the pain, whereupon Lin\r\nChing smiled.\r\n\r\n“So you flinch at the smell of _sarvadine_, ah, Am-Er-I-Khan? It will be\r\na pleasure to watch you when the real torture begins.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we?” asked the professor, noticing that the motion of the\r\nglobe had ceased.\r\n\r\n“In Peilong, the capitol city of His Imperial Majesty, P’an-ku,” replied\r\nLin Ching.\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” exclaimed the professor, whereupon Lin Ching, dumfounded,\r\nprodded him with his sword and ordered him to get out into the\r\npassageway and keep moving.\r\n\r\nAt his first step he bumped his head on the ceiling, then fell to the\r\nfloor in a heap. Convinced that he was indeed on the moon, by this\r\ndemonstration of the lessened gravity pull, he carefully got up, and\r\nmade his way forward with a peculiar, toddling gait that seemed to amuse\r\nhis captors.\r\n\r\nAs he emerged from the diamond-shaped doorway in the shell of the craft,\r\nhe saw that the great globe had settled into a circular depression in\r\nthe level floor of a great dock made to contain its lower half. All\r\naround him similar depressions were occupied by craft of exactly the\r\nsame size and type. It seemed that P’an-ku had a quite formidable\r\narmada.\r\n\r\nStanding on the dock with several other round-bodied Lunites was Kwan\r\nTsu Khan, his face bandaged and one arm in a sling. With him there also\r\nstood another, slender of figure, whom the professor instantly\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Wu!” he exclaimed in surprise. “How did you get here?”\r\n\r\n“I had the honor of being your fellow passenger, professor,” replied the\r\nChinaman, bowing slightly.\r\n\r\n“Come! Over the railing, worm!” grated Lin Ching, with another prod of\r\nhis sword.\r\n\r\nThe professor quickly vaulted the railing, alighting on the dock.\r\n\r\n“You will feed the Am-Er-I-Khan, Lin Ching,” commanded Kwan Tsu Khan,\r\nafter the latter had followed his prisoner over the railing. “I will\r\nsend for him later.” Then he turned and walked away, chatting amiably\r\nwith Dr. Wu, while the other Lunites followed at a respectful distance\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe savant was conducted off the docks, which were lighted by globes\r\nsuspended from the arched ends of gracefully constructed lamp posts. He\r\ncould not determine the nature of the light, which was yellow in color,\r\nand seemed to come from a liquid with which the globes were filled. Far\r\nabove him, he caught glimpses of the rugged top of the great arched\r\ncavern in which the lunar city was situated, particularly at points\r\nwhere white stalactites reflected the light from the globes below.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the docks, he threaded many narrow and crooked streets.\r\nThe houses, which were set closely together, were mostly octagonal or\r\ncylindrical in shape, and the popular fashion in doors and windows\r\nseemed to be the diamond shape—one hinge only at the left corner of the\r\ndiamond, and one catch at the right. The roofs were sharply pointed, and\r\nwere either of yellow metal or heavy stone. He wondered why roofs should\r\nbe needed at all in an underground city, and especially roofs of such\r\nheavy construction, until he saw a fragment of a stalactite fall on one\r\nof the metal roofs and glance off, alighting in the street not far from\r\na group of round-bodied Lunites.\r\n\r\nThe lighting system in the city was the same as at the docks—endless\r\nrows of suspended globes containing a substance which radiated yellow\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nPresently the professor and his captor emerged from the narrow streets\r\nand entered a broad open park, or plaza, planted with luminous trees and\r\nshrubs of variegated forms and hues. Standing in the center of this park\r\nwas a huge building, octagonal in shape, and crowned with a narrower,\r\npagoda-like structure, the point of which reached nearly to the pendant\r\nstalactites on the arched vault above. The lower part of the building\r\nwas of red stone, but the upper part was of burnished yellow metal\r\nsurrounded by rings of yellow globes and reflecting their light with\r\nsuch brilliance as to light up a considerable portion of the city as\r\nwell as the upper reaches of the cavern.\r\n\r\nThe professor was hustled into a door at the ground level of this\r\nbuilding, and down a spiral ramp into a dimly lighted room where a\r\nnumber of men, some of the round-bodied yellow race, and others of the\r\nwhite lunar race, were chained by collars around their necks to rings in\r\nthe wall. He was promptly clapped into a vacant place, and a burly\r\njailer whose touch was far from gentle, snapped and locked a metal\r\ncollar around his neck.\r\n\r\n“You will feed this contemptible maggot,” said Lin Ching to the jailer.\r\n“Then report to me.”\r\n\r\nThe burly fellow saluted, and Lin Ching withdrew. Presently the jailer\r\nwent out and returned with a bowl and a cup which he set before the\r\nprofessor. The bowl contained some chunks of stewed fungus of a leathery\r\ntexture though not unpleasant flavor, and the cup, water with a slightly\r\nalkaline taste.\r\n\r\nThe savant was both hungry and thirsty, and disposed of his meagre\r\nrations with gusto before Lin Ching came to him.\r\n\r\n“Now, O pestilent spawn of a grub,” said Lin Ching, seizing the\r\nprofessor’s neck chain which the jailer had unfastened from the wall,\r\nand giving it a vicious jerk, “we will learn the fate of one who defies\r\nthe servants of the mighty P’an-ku.”\r\n\r\nAfter being dragged up the spiral ramp and half choked from the pressure\r\nof his metal collar, Professor Ederson was hustled through a maze of\r\nhallways and passageways to a place where Kwan Tsu Khan stood before a\r\ngreat, diamond-shaped doorway, guarded by two armored warriors who\r\ncarried spears with heads like long-toothed buzz saws, while from the\r\nbelt of each there depended a sword on the left and a ray-projector on\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nThe Khan waited until a brilliantly robed major domo bade him enter—then\r\ntook the prisoner’s chain from the hands of Lin Ching and led him into a\r\nlarge, brilliantly lighted audience chamber, the walls of which were\r\nmagnificently decorated with gaudily colored bas-reliefs of hunting and\r\nbattle scenes in which the round-bodied moon men and strange animals and\r\ndragons figured conspicuously.\r\n\r\nSeated on a massive cushioned throne, placed on a raised platform at the\r\nfar end of the room, his great round belly cradled between his spindly\r\nknees, was P’an-ku, ruler of the yellow skinned moon men. Standing to\r\nthe right and left of the dais were guards, richly clad courtiers, and\r\nliveried attendants.\r\n\r\nThe Khan slowly led his prisoner to a place before the throne. Then,\r\ndropping to his knees, he pressed his forehead and the palms of his\r\nhands to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Rise, Kwan Tsu Khan,” said P’an-ku. “What have you here?”\r\n\r\n“I have brought you the first captive of war from Du Gong, O Lord of the\r\nUniverse,” replied Kwan Tsu Khan.\r\n\r\n“You are slightly in error, Kwan Tsu Khan,” replied P’an-ku, twisting\r\none end of his drooping moustache, and leering. “You have brought the\r\n_second_ prisoner of war from Du Gong. The first is already chained in\r\nour deepest dungeon for such time as we care to keep him there, while\r\ndevising a lingering death suitable to his case.”\r\n\r\n“A prisoner from Du Gong? Your humble servant craves indulgence, for he\r\nfails to understand, O King of the Age.”\r\n\r\n“It does not matter,” replied P’an-ku. “We will attend to the prisoner\r\nbefore us. Your report can wait, although I observe that you have been\r\nwounded, and that two of the other observer globes have not returned.\r\nLet us dispose of this prisoner, first. Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“The miserable microbe, who calls himself Am-Er-I-Khan, fell on the\r\nbridge of our globe from a ship of Du Gong which we destroyed, and was\r\ntaken captive by one of my men. When we had reached the capital of the\r\nland of the descendants of your illustrious ancestor, he dropped a\r\nmessage to someone in the crowd below the craft. Shortly thereafter,\r\nwhen we were in conference with the powers of that land, a revolt broke\r\nout in which eleven of our men were slain. Your humble slave barely\r\nescaped with his life, having been left for dead.\r\n\r\n“A man of that land who remains loyal to Your Majesty, and who calls\r\nhimself ‘Dr. Wu,’ was also left for dead, but being less badly wounded\r\nthan your servant, assisted him in getting back to the craft. After\r\ntaking vengeance on the revolting city, we departed for the other side\r\nof Du Gong, where—”\r\n\r\n“That part of your story can wait, Kwan Tsu Khan,” interrupted P’an-ku.\r\n“I take it that you suspect this Am-Er-I-Khan of having fomented the\r\nrevolution in the land of our former allies.”\r\n\r\n“Your wisdom, O Sole Vicar of the Great Lord Sun, is as brilliant and as\r\npenetrating as His rays.”\r\n\r\nP’an-ku glared down at the professor.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say for yourself, Am-Er-I-Khan?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” replied the professor.\r\n\r\n“You see, O Light of Knowledge, this vile father of many crawling\r\nmaggots admits his guilt.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” replied P’an-ku. “Ho, Tzien Khan. Take the prisoner to the\r\ntorture rooms and give him the death of the many water drops.”\r\n\r\nThe Lunite designated as Tzien Khan stepped forth and took the\r\nprofessor’s chain from the hand of Kwan Tsu Khan. Although the grizzled\r\nhairs of his long, stringy moustache and the many wrinkles of his\r\nparchment like countenance betokened great age, he seemed sprightly and\r\nquite muscular. His sadistic grin, as he jerked the prisoner away to\r\nexecute the order of the monarch, revealed a single, fang-like tooth in\r\nthe upper jaw, and but two below.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing his sentence, Professor Ederson had expected the slow,\r\ntorturing death of having water dripped on his forehead. He was\r\nsurprised, therefore, when he learned the true nature of the Lunite\r\ndeath of the many water drops.\r\n\r\nAfter being led through a large room filled with many instruments of\r\ntorture, and resonant with the shrieks of the victims of the wrath of\r\nP’an-ku, he was conducted to a small anteroom where two men, under the\r\ndirection of Tzien Khan, removed his metal collar and seated him in a\r\nheavy metal chair which was bolted to the floor. These two men, as well\r\nas the others whose work it was to torture the prisoners, had their\r\nfaces hideously painted with rings and lines of red and blue pigment.\r\n\r\nWhen they had the professor strapped securely in the chair, they\r\nmeasured his head. Then they went out, and presently returned with a\r\nmetal helmet with a ring in the top. The helmet fitted his skull almost\r\nas tightly as if it had been made to order for him, and a metal chin\r\npiece which was fastened beneath the ears on either side was fitted in\r\nplace and secured. A metal cable with hooks on each end was next passed\r\nthrough two stout pulleys suspended from the ceiling, one of which was\r\ndirectly above his head and the other about three feet in front of it.\r\n\r\nOne end of the cable was hooked through the ring in his helmet. Then one\r\nof the men lifted a large, cylindrical vessel with a funnel-like opening\r\nand basket-like handle at the top, and hooked it on the other end.\r\n\r\nThis done, Tzien Khan turned a valve, and a drop of water fell into the\r\nvessel. Noting its fall he watched a small instrument, evidently a\r\nchronometer, which he took from his belt pouch, until a second had\r\nfallen. For some time he continued to adjust the valve, until the\r\nfalling drops seemed timed to his liking. Then he dismissed his two\r\nattendants and turned to the professor with his cruel, toothless grin.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, O spawn of a slimy worm,” he said. “In your slow and painful\r\npassing, meditate on the folly of opposing your puny will to that of the\r\nLord of the Universe.”\r\n\r\nThe professor was unable to make a reply, even had he desired to do so,\r\nfor the weight of the vessel had pulled the helmet and chin piece so\r\nhigh that speech was impossible. The cords of his neck began to pain him\r\nsharply, and he tried to think of something which would take his mind\r\noff the pain.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his wrist watch, he calculated that the water was\r\ndripping into the container at the rate of a drop every minute. A dram\r\nan hour. Three ounces in a day. How much weight could the cords and\r\nmuscles withstand? How long had he to live?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XIX. DUNGEONS OF DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTed Dustin’s first glimmer of returning consciousness after his space\r\nflier had crashed with him in the crater of Copernicus, was a queer,\r\nswinging sensation.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes and saw the broad shoulders of an armored warrior, on\r\none of which rested a pole. The other end of the pole was carried by\r\nanother warrior behind, and he was swinging in a net, each end of which\r\nwas fastened to the pole. Two more warriors armed with long spears with\r\nheads that resembled long-toothed buzz saws, and with swords and ray\r\nprojectors belted about their waists, walked on either side. He could\r\nhear the clanking armor of many more behind. An officer, in gaudy armor,\r\nwalked ahead.\r\n\r\nThe young scientist saw that he was being carried through a beautiful\r\ngarden of luminous trees, shrubs and plants, toward a tall, hexagonal\r\nbuilding crowned with a pagoda-like structure of yellow metal,\r\nbrilliantly lighted.\r\n\r\nPresently the column came to a halt before a broad flight of steps\r\nleading up to a great diamond-shaped door. Standing on the lower step,\r\nsurrounded by his courtiers, slaves and attendants, he recognized the\r\nhuge rotund figure of P’an-ku.\r\n\r\nAt a command from the leader he was lowered to the ground. Then the two\r\nmen who had been carrying him seized him on each side, and jerking him\r\nerect, dragged him before the monarch.\r\n\r\n“O, Vicar of the Great Lord Sun,” intoned the officer. “I bring you\r\nalive, the presuming parasite from Du Gong who destroyed the\r\nexperimental ray projector.”\r\n\r\n“By the sacred bones of my worshipful ancestors!” exclaimed P’an-ku,\r\npeering down at the prisoner over his puffy cheeks, and twisting his\r\nlong, stringy moustache. “If Dr. Wu sent us the correct description, it\r\nis none other than the upstart who calls himself a scientist, Ted\r\nDustin.”\r\n\r\n“And if I mistake not,” replied Ted, smiling, “you are P’an-ku, the\r\nmaster of bombast who calls himself ‘Lord of the Universe.’”\r\n\r\n“O, slimy worm and wriggling maggot of Du Gong,” grated P’an-ku. “Think\r\nyou that you have performed a great service for your people by\r\ndestroying my experimental ray projector? Know then, that I am building,\r\nand will have completed in less than five of your days, a projector with\r\nten times its power. You could have destroyed it as easily as the other,\r\nbut you have merely saved me the effort of dismantling the smaller\r\nprojector.”\r\n\r\n“Everything in its turn,” replied Ted, feigning a complacency he did not\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\n“As to your death,” continued P’an-ku, closely watching his prisoner for\r\nsigns of fear, “I will ponder over it. It was you who destroyed Ur—you\r\nwho defied me—you who thought to break my power by destroying a small\r\nexperimental projector. I must have leisure to devise a punishment\r\nbefitting your crimes.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the officer who had brought up the prisoner, saying:\r\n\r\n“Away with him, to the dungeons of eternal darkness.”\r\n\r\nTed was hustled away to a small side entrance on the ground level of the\r\npalace, along a hallway, through a torture chamber where victims\r\nshrieked their anguish and hideously painted torturers laughed at their\r\nagonies, then down a spiral ramp dimly lighted by small globes of\r\nluminous yellow liquid, which appeared almost endless, so deeply did it\r\npenetrate the damp rock.\r\n\r\nPresently, when it seemed to the young scientist that he must be at\r\nleast a mile beneath the palace, the two men who were dragging him\r\nhalted at a sharp command from the officer who led the way.\r\n\r\nThe officer then lighted a head lamp on the front of his pagoda-like\r\nhelmet, and plunged into a dark hole in the wall, followed by the two\r\nwarriors with their prisoner.\r\n\r\nThey were in a hand-hewn cavern, roughly circular in form. Cut in the\r\nwall at irregular intervals were the openings of passageways which led\r\naway from the cavern in all directions. The officer led the way into one\r\nof these passageways which was filled with a horrible, sickening stench\r\nthat became stronger as they advanced.\r\n\r\nPresently the passageway widened, and the cause of the foul odors became\r\napparent, as Ted saw, leaning against the back of a niche cut in the\r\nwall at the right, a bloated, festering corpse, chained by the neck to a\r\nring in the wall in such a manner that had the person been living he\r\nwould neither have been able to stand erect nor lie down.\r\n\r\nIn niches on both sides of the passageway there now came into view more\r\ncorpses in all stages of decay from cadavers of the freshly dead to mere\r\nskeletons. The floors of all the niches were littered with human bones,\r\nas was the passageway itself, but the warriors stepped over them or\r\nkicked them out of the way without notice.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from the gloom ahead, there came a horrible, blood-curdling\r\nshriek, followed by peal after peal of demoniac laughter.\r\n\r\n“Aiee-yah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Aiee-yah! Men and light! Light and life! Darkness\r\nand death! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!”\r\n\r\n“Shen Ho still lives in body,” whispered one of the soldiers to the\r\nother, “but his mind is dead.”\r\n\r\n“A mighty mind while it lived,” replied the other. “No puny intellect\r\ncould have given us back the green ray of our ancestors.”\r\n\r\n“Yet none but a fool would dare oppose P’an-ku, Lord of the Universe,”\r\ncountered the first.\r\n\r\n“All wise men are fools in some things,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nA moment later Ted saw the madman, squatting in his filthy niche and\r\ncombing his stringy gray beard with bony, clawlike fingers. A few dirty\r\nshreds of clothing still clung to his wasted body—clothing which had\r\nevidently been made from the richest of materials of the kind worn by\r\ngreat nobles.\r\n\r\n“Aiee!” he shrieked. “Another victim of the darkness!”\r\n\r\nThe officer had stopped, and was peering into the niche opposite that of\r\nthe madman. A skeleton, on which there hung a few unclean rags that had\r\nonce been clothing, half leaned against the wall, the white skull\r\nnesting in the metal collar which hung at the end of the short, stout\r\nchain fastened to the wall.\r\n\r\n“This one will do,” he said, and entering, kicked the moulding bones\r\ninto a corner with one foot while he shook the chain to dislodge the\r\nskull from the collar.\r\n\r\nWith a key taken from his belt pouch, the officer unlocked the heavy\r\ncollar and sprung it open. Then, while the two warriors held the\r\nprisoner in position, he snapped it on his neck, locked it, and replaced\r\nthe key in his belt pouch.\r\n\r\n“I leave you in distinguished company, O wise fool of Du Gong,” said the\r\nofficer. “Dead men who have been doughty warriors and mighty Khans, and\r\na madman who was once the mightiest and wisest of all khans. Farewell.”\r\n\r\nTed, who was now chained so he could neither stand erect nor lie down,\r\nsquatted on his haunches among the bones of his filthy den, and watched\r\nthe light from the head lamp of the departing officer grow more dim,\r\nuntil it finally disappeared and he was left in complete blackness.\r\n\r\nThen he reached back to open his suit of insulating armor, which\r\nfastened in the back with an arrangement somewhat resembling a\r\nterrestrial zipper. With this armor off it would be an easy matter for\r\nhim to get rid of his collar and chain, and he would have a fighting\r\nchance for his life, as his two pistol degravitors were underneath the\r\narmor and over the court suit he had been wearing when he had suddenly\r\ndecided to attack the green ray projector in his flier.\r\n\r\nTo his consternation, however, the fastening would not budge. Like its\r\nterrestrial cousin the zipper, it worked beautifully when in good order,\r\nbut when jammed it proved ten times as stubborn. Evidently it had been\r\nbent out of shape when his ship crashed with him in the crater. He\r\nworked futilely at it for more than two hours, then gave up the attempt\r\nas hopeless.\r\n\r\nPresently a new idea occurred to him, and he began picking and pulling\r\nat the fuzzy exterior of his armor on his right side. If he could only\r\nmake a hole big enough to get his hand on the pistol degravitor that\r\npressed against his thigh the rest would be easy. But the armor proved\r\nas baffling as its fastenings, for interwoven with its tough fibres were\r\ntiny metal wires of extraordinary strength. He was still picking\r\nhopelessly at these wires when the madman in the cell across from him,\r\nwho had been quiet up to this time, spoke.\r\n\r\n“Who are you, white man?” he asked.\r\n\r\nSurprised at the calm tones of this perfectly sane question, Ted\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“Men call me Ted Dustin.”\r\n\r\n“A peculiar name,” mused Shen Ho. “From what part of Ma Gong do you\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\n“I am from Du Gong,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\n“From Du Gong! Are you mad, or can it be that I am as mad as I have\r\npretended to be? If you are from Du Gong how did you get here?”\r\n\r\n“In my space flier,” answered Ted.\r\n\r\n“You are a scientist?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I, too, am a scientist. I rediscovered the secret of the green ray of\r\nour ancestors, after it had been lost for thousands of years. It was my\r\nidea to use the ray for defense, but P’an-ku decided to use it for\r\nconquest. I objected. That is why I am here—have been here for more than\r\na year. He would have killed me long ago by torture had it not been that\r\nhe thought he might want to use my brain for his benefit later. As I\r\nhave nothing left to live for, I feign madness in the presence of the\r\nguards, hoping that my execution will be ordered and I may be released\r\nfrom this horrible existence—this living death. Why has P’an-ku sent you\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“I am his prisoner of war,” replied Ted, and recounted all that had\r\nhappened from the time he had fired his projectile at the moon. It was a\r\nrelief to have someone to talk to there in the stinking darkness.\r\n\r\n“Many strange things can happen in a year,” said Shen Ho, when Ted had\r\nfinished his story. “And to think, he has used not only my invention,\r\nbut the inventions of my two younger brothers for a war of conquest. My\r\nbrother Wen Ho, who is five years younger than I, invented the flying\r\nglobe. My brother, Fen Ho, who is seven years my junior, was the\r\ninventor of the powerful explosive projectiles and firing mechanism. We\r\nof the house of Ho spent our lives and our talents on these inventions\r\nin order that our people might have adequate defensive weapons and live\r\nin peace forever. But P’an-ku thought differently about these things,\r\nand his word is law.”\r\n\r\n“Did he jail your brothers, also?” asked Ted.\r\n\r\n“They were condemned to these dungeons at the same time as I,” replied\r\nShen Ho, “but we were all chained in separate passageways. I know not\r\nwhether they are living or dead.”\r\n\r\n“If you found an opportunity to escape, what would you do?” asked Ted.\r\n\r\n“First I would search for my brothers and attempt to rescue them or\r\nassure myself that they had perished. This accomplished, I would seek\r\nP’an-ku.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“And then, the Lord Sun willing, P’an-ku should die.”\r\n\r\n“I have the means of escape at hand, yet cannot reach them.” said Ted,\r\nexplaining the nature and position of his two pistol degravitors. “If I\r\ncould but get my hand on one of these weapons, I could destroy our\r\nfetters. Then we could help each other.”\r\n\r\nFor some time Shen Ho was silent. Then he suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“I have a way!”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By persistent rubbing, human teeth will sever that wire.”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t bite my own hip,” replied Ted. “That’s out.”\r\n\r\n“There are several skulls in your cell,” said Shen Ho, “and in the jaws\r\nare teeth.”\r\n\r\n“Right!” exclaimed Ted. “We have a saying on Du Gong that two heads are\r\nbetter than one.”\r\n\r\n“And you will find,” replied Shen Ho, “that if the first set of teeth\r\nwears out, two or three skulls are better than one. When and if you run\r\nout of skulls I have plenty more over here.”\r\n\r\nAfter groping about in the darkness for some time, Ted finally secured a\r\nskull, tore the jaw bone loose, and began sawing at the armor over his\r\nright hip. It was slow work. The wires were tougher by far than he had\r\nthought possible, and as Shen Ho had predicted, the teeth in the jaw\r\nbone he used were being ground away. When he had worn them down to the\r\nbone after many hours of patient labor, he discarded the lower jaw and\r\nwent to work with the upper set of teeth. These, also, were nearly worn\r\naway with but slight effect on the armor, when a light suddenly appeared\r\nfar down the passageway.\r\n\r\n“It is a slave with our food and drink,” whispered Shen Ho. “Cease your\r\nlabors until he has gone. I will feign madness, as usual.”\r\n\r\nTed laid the skull on the floor and sat down with his back against the\r\nwall, while Shen Ho laughed and shrieked until the whole cavern\r\nresounded with his weird cries.\r\n\r\nThe slave, a yellow, round-bodied Lunite who wore a light strapped to\r\nhis forehead, a long, loose shirt of some coarse material, and straw\r\nsandals, set a bowl of stewed fungus and a large cup of water before\r\neach prisoner. Although he was without appetite in his ill-smelling\r\nsurroundings, Ted choked down the fungus and drank the water, not\r\nknowing how soon he might again be offered food and drink.\r\n\r\nWhen the prisoners had finished their frugal meal the slave took the\r\nbowls and cups and departed, leaving them in total darkness once more.\r\n\r\nTed picked up a skull, the position of which he had marked while eating\r\nhis meal, tore off the jaw bone, and resumed work on the armor. When he\r\nfelt sure the slave was out of earshot, he asked Shen Ho how often food\r\nand drink were served.\r\n\r\n“The slave comes once in a rotation of your world,” replied Shen Ho.\r\n“Our world moves so slowly on its axis that we use the rotation of yours\r\nto mark our measurement of time. We have our chronometers, of course,\r\nbut your world is the great chronometer in the sky by which our own are\r\nguided and corrected. I had a small timepiece when I was brought here,\r\nbut it ceased to function long ago and I gave it to a slave as a bribe\r\nfor some few morsels of better food than is sent here regularly. A short\r\ntime thereafter, that slave was chained in the niche you now occupy. He\r\ncursed me when he told me he had been caught with my chronometer and\r\nforced to confess his defection. Being quite superstitious, he died from\r\nterror in a short time, and it was his skeleton that was kicked into the\r\ncorner by the guard and his skull that was shaken out of the collar to\r\nmake a place for you.”. . . .\r\n\r\nFour times, thereafter, the slave came with food, thus marking the\r\npassage of five earth days in all. Ted had used up all the available\r\nteeth in his own niche, and was working with the upper set of the last\r\nskull which Shen Ho had been able to produce and toss over to him, but\r\nalthough he had cut through many wires in his armor, he was still unable\r\nto reach his degravitor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a light, brighter than the headlamp of the slave, appeared at\r\nthe entrance of the passage way. The clank of arms and the footsteps of\r\nmailed warriors resounded through the cavern.\r\n\r\n“Where have they hidden this miserable worm from Du Gong?” asked a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“The officer said he was far back in the passageway, excellency,”\r\nanswered another.\r\n\r\n“I know that first voice,” whispered Shen Ho. “It is the cruel Tzien,\r\nwho is Khan of the Torture Chambers. With him are four of his painted\r\ntortures. Work fast, Ted Dustin, or you are doomed.”\r\n\r\nTed scraped frantically at the remaining wires which kept him from\r\nreaching his degravitor. Several snapped, and he attempted to insert his\r\nhand, but the opening was still too small.\r\n\r\n“Hurry!” called Shen Ho. “They are almost here!”\r\n\r\nGripping the skull in both hands, Ted scraped in frenzied haste while\r\nthe footfalls and clanking armor grew louder. More wires snapped, yet he\r\ncould not get his hand in the opening.\r\n\r\nBefore he could move, Tzien Khan, with his cruel features contorted in a\r\ngrin of sadistic delight, stepped into view followed by four of his\r\nbrawny, hideously painted torturers. Then Shen Ho howled and laughed,\r\nand muttered of light and life, and of darkness and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XX. TRAPPED\r\n\r\n\r\nP’an-ku, his hands clasped about his ample equatorial region, leaned\r\nback in his luxuriously cushioned throne and listlessly contemplated the\r\nhumped figure of his major domo who, with palms and forehead pressed to\r\nthe floor before the dais, awaited permission to speak.\r\n\r\n“Now what low person disturbs our meditations?” demanded P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“O, worshipful Lord of the Universe,” replied the major domo, “Kai Lo,\r\nKhan of Scouts, begs leave to impart tidings.”\r\n\r\n“Admit him,” said P’an-ku. Then he turned to Dr. Wu, who stood at the\r\nright of the throne, having advanced himself in the graces of the\r\nmonarch he regarded almost as a god, and said: “I presume he will tell\r\nme that the white Princess is about to storm the city. I knew this five\r\ndays ago when my spies in Ultu informed me of her pact with the worm of\r\nDu Gong who called himself Roger Sanders.”\r\n\r\nKai Lo Khan, a short individual with an oval body and thin, crafty\r\nfeatures, entered and prostrated himself before the throne.\r\n\r\n“Speak,” commanded P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“O, Paragon of Wisdom and Fountain of All Authority,” said Kai Lo Khan,\r\n“the army of the Princess Maza is surrounding the city. With her are a\r\nhundred thousand _nak-kar_ cavalry and five hundred thousand foot.”\r\n\r\n“Dolt!” thundered P’an-ku. “I knew all this was to be five days ago, and\r\nam prepared.”\r\n\r\n“But Majesty, that is not all. She has sent a party to the western gate\r\nof the city under a banner of truce.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! She would parley. Go then to the gate and take her message.”\r\n\r\nAgain prostrating himself, Kai Lo Khan hastily departed.\r\n\r\nNot more than twenty minutes elapsed before he returned and made\r\nobeisance.\r\n\r\n“I have brought the message of the Princess, O Vicar of the Sun,” said\r\nhe, producing a scroll.\r\n\r\n“Read it,” commanded P’an-ku.\r\n\r\nKai Lo Khan unrolled the scroll, cleared his throat, and read:\r\n\r\n                  _Her Imperial Majesty, Maza an Ma Gong\r\n                                    to\r\n                 His Royal Highness, P’an-ku an Peilong_\r\n\r\n  Greeting:\r\n\r\n  Surrender the person of Ted Dustin, living and unharmed, and Peilong\r\n  will be spared. Refuse, and my army will destroy it utterly.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Maza an Ma Gong_\r\n\r\n“Tell her,” thundered P’an-ku, “that Ted Dustin will this day be made to\r\nsuffer the death of the hot oil. Tell her further, that we are prepared\r\nfor her attack, and that—”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, O just and mighty Dictator of the Universe!” It was Dr. Wu who\r\nhad interrupted. The courtiers looked at him in amazement, apparently\r\nexpecting P’an-ku to have him executed for his temerity, but he\r\ncontinued. “May your worthless slave from Du Gong suggest a plan?”\r\n\r\n“Speak,” replied P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“Would it please Your Majesty to have the white Princess as a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing would suit me better,” replied P’an-ku. “Tzien Khan, here,\r\ncould very quickly persuade her to become my queen, could you not, my\r\nKhan of the Torture Chambers?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly, O King of the Age, if she should be so foolish as to need\r\nsuch persuasion,” replied Tzien Khan with a bow.\r\n\r\n“After which,” continued P’an-ku, “with her armies and her wealth at my\r\ndisposal, I could quickly bring both Du Gong and Lu Gong under my\r\nundisputed sway. But what is your plan, Dr. Wu?”\r\n\r\n“It is apparent from her message,” said the wily doctor, “that the\r\nPrincess loves this Ted Dustin. If the prisoner, therefore, or someone\r\npurporting to be the prisoner, were sent out, she would not overlook an\r\nopportunity for speech with him.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” replied P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“I suggest therefore,” continued the crafty doctor, “that you dress one\r\nof your white prisoners who is about the size of Ted Dustin in a suit of\r\ninsulating armor and glass helmet of the kind worn by the people of\r\nUltu. Send a note to the Princess stating that you will constitute Ted\r\nDustin your messenger for a peace parley at a point half way between the\r\nwestern gate and the front line of her army, stipulating that she be\r\naccompanied by not more than ten unmounted men, and that a like number\r\nwill accompany Ted Dustin.\r\n\r\n“Men can be posted at suitable points along the wall with green ray\r\nprojectors to lay down a barrage at a prearranged signal. This will\r\nprevent her from getting back to her army, or prevent the army from\r\nreaching her. In the meantime, her guard can easily be destroyed and the\r\nPrincess taken prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“What think you of this plan, Kai Lo Khan?” asked P’an-ku.\r\n\r\n“It sounds feasible, O Bright and Shining Cousin of the Sun,” replied\r\nthe Khan of Scouts, cautiously.\r\n\r\n“And you, Tzien Khan?”\r\n\r\n“I believe it would work, O Lord of Worlds,” replied the Khan of\r\nTorturers.\r\n\r\n“We will try it,” decided P’an-ku. “You, Tzien Khan, will take one of\r\nthe Ultuan prisoners who resembles Ted Dustin in physical proportions\r\nand dress him in a suit of the armor we took when we captured a troop of\r\nthe surface scouts of the white princess.\r\n\r\n“You, Kai Lo Khan, will go to Chu Yan, Khan of my army, inform him of\r\nour plans, and see that he has men with ray projectors suitably posted\r\non the walls and ten men ready to accompany the prisoner to the meeting\r\nplace. I will send a messenger with a note to the Princess, at once.\r\n\r\n“And, Tzien Khan. When you have prepared a prisoner to represent the\r\nyoung scientist of Du Gong, you may take Ted Dustin from the dungeons of\r\neternal darkness to the torture chambers, and there inflict on him the\r\ndeath of the hot oil. I had thought to delay his death and prolong his\r\ntorture indefinitely, but with the prospect of the honor of a visit from\r\nthe fair Princess who foolishly believes she loves him, it will be\r\nbetter to put him permanently out of her reach at once.\r\n\r\n“Now go, both of you.” . . . .\r\n\r\nSeated on the back of her great, fighting _nak-kar_ in one of the glades\r\nof the luminous forest which surrounded the city of Peilong, Maza waited\r\nimpatiently for P’an-ku reply to her message. She wore a suit and helmet\r\nof shining white armor, and a sword and red ray projector depended from\r\nthe belt which encircled her slender waist. Beside her, similarly\r\narmored and mounted, was the aged Vanible Khan.\r\n\r\nRanged before her were line after line of her foot soldiers, and more,\r\nsteadily coming up from the rear, were being hurried into place by their\r\nofficers as the army encircled the city. Her _nak-kar_ cavalry had\r\ndeployed for attack, and the huge supply wagons, drawn by great,\r\nlumbering, wingless dragons, were rumbling into position.\r\n\r\n“P’an-ku ponders long over his reply, Your Majesty,” said Vanible Khan.\r\n\r\n“It may be that he does not intend to make one,” replied Maza. “He\r\nseems, however, to have respected my banner of truce.”\r\n\r\n“I would not rest too strongly on the belief that Ted Dustin is alive,”\r\nsaid Vanible Khan. “If he escaped the green rays of the defenders when\r\nhe attacked the great projector it would be amazing, but if P’an-ku were\r\nto capture him and spare his life it would indeed be astounding.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I shall go on believing him alive until I have proof to\r\nthe contrary,” answered Maza. “I seem to feel it, here.” She pressed her\r\nhand over her heart.\r\n\r\nSailing gracefully over the treetops, a _nak-kar_ alighted in the glade.\r\nIts rider dismounted, rushed to where Maza sat in her saddle, made\r\nobeisance, and presented a scroll.\r\n\r\n“A message from P’an-ku,” he announced.\r\n\r\nThe Princess eagerly seized and unrolled the missive, hastily scanning\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\n“He lives! Ted Dustin lives!”\r\n\r\n“And will P’an-ku surrender him without a struggle?” asked Vanible Khan.\r\n\r\n“I will read the message,” she replied.\r\n\r\n           _His Imperial Majesty, P’an-ku an Ma Gong tu Du Gong\r\n                                    to\r\n                    Her Royal Highness, Maza an Ulta_\r\n\r\n  If you care to meet him in person, Ted Dustin will tell you the terms\r\n  I propose. He will advance half way to your front lines, accompanied\r\n  by ten of my guards, who will slay him at the first sign of treachery.\r\n  Meet him there, on foot, with ten of your unmounted warriors, and\r\n  perhaps a satisfactory settlement can be arranged.\r\n\r\n                                        _P’an-ku an Ma Gong tu Du Gong._\r\n\r\n“The ruler of Peilong assumes mighty titles since he has acquired the\r\ngreen ray and the fighting globe,” said Vanible Khan. “Emperor of Ma\r\nGong and Du Gong, indeed! He will soon have the other planets, their\r\nsatellites, and the Lord Sun under his domination, if words can do the\r\ntrick. And he insultingly addressed Your Majesty as ‘Ruler of Ulta,’\r\nignoring your greater title.”\r\n\r\n“I will overlook that for the present—to save Ted Dustin,” replied Maza.\r\n\r\n“But, Your Majesty,” remonstrated the aged scientist. “Don’t you see\r\nthat this bloated monster is setting a trap for you—a trap baited with\r\nthe man you love?”\r\n\r\n“Trap or no trap,” said Maza, “I am going.”\r\n\r\n“Majesty, I implore you not to go. For the sake of Ulta—for the sake of\r\nthe millions of subjects who love you—”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” she said. “The terms are fair enough—a trap well nigh\r\nimpossible. I will be accompanied by ten of my warriors, who can, if\r\nneed be, account for the ten accompanying Ted Dustin. I will be within\r\nplain sight and ray-range of the advance guard of my army. They will be\r\ninstructed to protect me with a ray barrage at the slightest sign of\r\ntrickery.”\r\n\r\n“But, Majesty—”\r\n\r\n“Not another word. I leave my army in your care until my return. If I do\r\nnot come back—if I am killed or captured—attack the city at once, and\r\ncontinue the fight until Peilong is utterly destroyed. Goodbye, my\r\nworthy Khan and lifelong friend.”\r\n\r\nGrief stricken, Vanible Khan bowed his head in farewell obeisance, while\r\ntears trickled down his furrowed cheeks. When he raised his tear-dimmed\r\neyes the _nak-kar_ with his beloved young ruler was disappearing over\r\nthe treetops.\r\n\r\nAlighting just behind the front line of her troops Maza dismounted,\r\ntossed her reins to a soldier, and addressed a young officer who ran\r\nquickly to her side and made obeisance.\r\n\r\n“Pick me ten of your bravest soldiers at once,” she said. “They will go\r\nwith me for a parley midway between my front line and the city gate.\r\nInstruct the men in the front line to be ready to throw a ray barrage\r\naround me at the least indication of treachery.”\r\n\r\nShe watched the gate while the young officer selected the men who were\r\nto go with her. One by one they took up a position in a line behind her.\r\n\r\nPresently the gate opened, and she saw a man the size and build of Ted\r\nDustin emerge therefrom, followed by ten of P’an-ku’s soldiers. She had\r\nlast seen Ted attired in one of the insulated suits with glass helmet\r\nwhich her people wore for surface travel, and this man was so attired.\r\nHer heart leaped with joy, and as she went out expecting to meet the man\r\nshe loved, followed by her ten soldiers, there was not the slightest\r\ndoubt in her mind that this was really Ted Dustin.\r\n\r\nAs she drew nearer to the man who was coming toward her, Maza felt that\r\nthere was something about him which was not just as it should be. What\r\nis it? Ah, his gait. He did not walk with long, easy strides like those\r\nof the earth man, whose muscles, accustomed to a greater gravity pull,\r\ninvoluntarily carried him much further at each step than the stride of\r\nthe most athletic of moon men. Besides, if he felt as she did, he would\r\nhurry to meet her, in which case she knew the mighty bounds through\r\nspace of which he was capable.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she paused, doubting. Then came the thought that Ted might\r\nbe adapting his stride to suit that of his captors—might indeed be\r\ncompelled to do so. Furthermore, the size, build and attire were\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWhen within fifty feet of the man she strained her eyes to see his face\r\nin the glass helmet. The light from the luminous forest was quite dim at\r\nthis point, and the yellow lights from the city were more of a hindrance\r\nthan a help as they shone in her eyes from behind him without lighting\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nA distance of twenty feet was reached, and it seemed that if she could\r\nnot recognize the man he, with the light in his favor, should be able to\r\nrecognize her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he called out:\r\n\r\n“Retreat Majesty, quickly! It is a trap!”\r\n\r\nThe voice and face she recognized simultaneously. The man was one of her\r\n_nak-kar_ scout officers she had believed slain in a battle with the\r\nflying globes.\r\n\r\nInstantly a green ray from the projector of one of the warriors behind\r\nhim cut him down.\r\n\r\nMaza whipped out her own red ray projector and the man who had flashed\r\nhis green ray disappeared in a sudden burst of flame. Not a second\r\nelapsed before her men were drawing their ray projectors, but the nine\r\nremaining warriors of P’an-ku were already on guard. The battle\r\ncommenced with fencing, deadly as it was beautiful—green rays against\r\nred, red against green.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, a barrage of green leaped out from the city walls and a\r\nbarrage of red flashed out from the front rank of Maza’s army. Where the\r\nrays met they neutralized each other, but enough green rays got through\r\nto form a triangle past which Maza and her little party could not\r\nretreat, while a similar triangle of red rays made it possible for the\r\nwarriors of P’an-ku to retreat.\r\n\r\nOne of Maza’s men fell, crumpled to nothingness by a green ray, but as\r\nhe fell he took with him his opponent in a brilliant flash of light.\r\nThen a ray from the wall, swinging unexpectedly into the little group,\r\ncut down three of the white warriors. This left seven red rays, counting\r\nMaza’s, against eight green rays. With the odds in their favor, the\r\nyellow men redoubled their attack. The whites fought back furiously, and\r\nin a moment both parties were wiped out with the exceptions of Maza and\r\none of P’an-ku’s warriors.\r\n\r\nAt ray-fencing, the Princess was the equal of any trained soldier in her\r\narmy, but her opponent, she found, was the most skillful she had ever\r\nencountered. His tactics, however, were purely defensive except as he\r\ntried to destroy her projector. Evidently his orders had been to bring\r\nher in alive. He would feint, swinging his ray as if he meant to strike\r\nher down, but never in a direct line with her body. Noticing this, she\r\nresolved to stake everything on one long chance. Accordingly, she held\r\nher projector away from her—a tempting bait. He swung for the lure,\r\nleaving his guard open for but an instant. But in that instant her red\r\nray struck him full in the chest and he was no more.\r\n\r\nWhile this duel was in progress Maza’s men were rushing to her rescue\r\nfrom behind. And P’an-ku’s men were pouring out of the city gate to meet\r\nthem. She was alone in the center of a terrific battle, unable to move\r\nmore than twenty feet in any direction because of the double ray barrage\r\nwhich surrounded her.\r\n\r\nThrough the network of rays encompassing her, she saw a detachment of\r\nher _nak-kar_ cavalry flying swiftly above the heads of her foot\r\nsoldiers, the riders aiming their ray projectors at the men on the walls\r\nand pouring through the gate. Here and there great sections of the wall\r\ndisappeared in bursts of smoke as the red rays cut through the green\r\nbarrage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flying cavalry was doing terrific execution, its casualties\r\nwere exceedingly heavy. Soon a number of the great beasts were\r\nriderless, but more were struck down by the green rays, _nak-kars_ and\r\nriders falling together on the heads of the soldiers below. These and\r\nthe fragments of rock and huge stalactites which fell from the roof of\r\nthe cavern far overhead whenever green or red rays were accidentally\r\ndirected too vertically, constituted almost as much of a menace as the\r\nrays themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the first flying detachment was wiped out, a second flew into the\r\nbreach, and the fighting became doubly furious.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of her flying warriors, the foot soldiers were\r\ngaining ground when a score of huge flying globes suddenly sailed out\r\nfrom over the city walls. They flew in a V shaped formation, with green\r\nrays ten times as powerful as those used by the soldiers, shining from\r\ntheir diamond-shaped port holes.\r\n\r\nThe _nak-kar_ cavalry fought bravely, but unavailingly as this solid\r\nwall of deadly green light approached. In less than ten minutes the\r\nentire detachment was wiped out. The globes then suddenly descended\r\ngroundward, their rays forming a solid, impenetrable wall, and cutting\r\noff the red barrage rays which had formerly shielded Maza.\r\n\r\nAnother globe then shot out from over the gate, and before she was aware\r\nof its purpose, had dropped a huge net around the Princess which knocked\r\nher red ray projector from her hand and entangled her in its meshes. She\r\nwas drawn swiftly up to the bridge and dragged through one of the\r\ndiamond-shaped openings while the globe sped swiftly back over the gate.\r\nThen, while two warriors held her, an officer whose face was bandaged\r\nand whose left arm hung in a sling, took her sword from her and cut the\r\nmeshes of the net.\r\n\r\nWith a scarcely perceptible jar, the globe alighted on the ground before\r\na huge building which she instantly recognized from its pictures and\r\ndescriptions as the palace of P’an-ku. The bridge of the globe leaned\r\nagainst a jutting balcony which was almost on a level with it.\r\n\r\nStepping out of the door, the officer vaulted the railing, alighting on\r\nthe balcony, and ordered the two soldiers to follow him with the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nMaza was lifted over the railing and hurried along a corridor which led\r\nto a great diamond-shaped door on each side of which two armed guards\r\nwere posted.\r\n\r\nA major domo announced in a loud voice: “Her Royal Highness, Maza an\r\nUltu,” and the Princess marched into the throne room between her two\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nThe officer who had captured her advanced and made profound obeisance.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Kwan Tsu Khan,” said P’an-ku. “Take a place of honor, here\r\non my right hand, and we will speak of your reward later.”\r\n\r\nThe officer bowed his thanks and took a position beside Dr. Wu at the\r\nright of the throne. Then P’an-ku raised his hand and the two guards\r\nbrought the prisoner before the throne, after which each prostrated\r\nhimself before the monarch and stepped back twenty paces.\r\n\r\nStanding there alone in the middle of the floor, surrounded by enemies,\r\nMaza looked up unflinchingly into the gloating eyes of the porcine\r\nmonster on the throne.\r\n\r\nP’an-ku rose ponderously and bowed—a ceremony due visiting royalty.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to Peilong, Princess of Ultu,” he said. “We are deeply grateful\r\nfor the honor of this unexpected visit.”\r\n\r\n“What have you done with Ted Dustin, treacherous monster?” she demanded.\r\n\r\nP’an-ku smiled evilly, while he deliberately consulted his chronometer.\r\n\r\n“By this time,” he said, “the worm of Du Gong who calls himself a\r\nscientist is undoubtedly dead—that is unless his white skin is so tough\r\nas to be impervious to boiling oil.”\r\n\r\nThe face of the Princess turned deathly pale. She swayed, and would have\r\nfallen to the floor had not the two guards behind her bounded forward\r\nand caught her by the arms.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, however, she recovered her poise and shook herself free.\r\n\r\n“You have ordered the death of Ted Dustin,” she said, “but in so doing\r\nyou have pronounced the doom of Peilong and certified your own death\r\nwarrant. When my army has finished with Peilong and with you, the\r\ndynasty of the P’an-kus will have ended forever. My grandfather made the\r\nmistake of granting your father freedom, and I am paying for his error,\r\nbut the warriors of Ultu will take full vengeance.”\r\n\r\nP’an-ku rose, and laughed sneeringly.\r\n\r\n“Your army will not long survive your lover,” he said. “As for Ultu, a\r\nhundred of my globes left their hangars long before your clumsy attack\r\non Peilong commenced, with commands to either capture or destroy the\r\ncity. With their superior weapons and armament they cannot fail.\r\n\r\n“You are hopelessly beaten, O Princess, yet I am not the savage and\r\nrelentless victor you seem to think me. True, I am a conqueror, and\r\nconquerors must be ruthless with their enemies. In the conquest of Ma\r\nGong I have only begun to extend my domination. Next will come Du Gong,\r\nthen Lu Gong, and finally all the inhabited and inhabitable planets that\r\ncircle the great Lord Sun. I will be the greatest conqueror of all\r\ntime—not merely a conqueror of nations, but a conqueror of worlds.\r\n\r\n“But with all this, I have a kind and generous heart. I could take\r\nvengeance on you, order your torture and death, or make you my slave,\r\nyet so magnanimously am I disposed toward you that I offer you the honor\r\nof becoming my queen—of ruling with me, the mightiest empire that has\r\never come under the control of one man.”\r\n\r\n“And thus,” replied Maza, scornfully, “heap insult upon injury. Give me\r\ndeath—by torture if you will, in preference to that.”\r\n\r\n“You speak hastily,” said P’an-ku, apparently unperturbed, “and in the\r\nheat of anger. Like most women you are temperamental. But I do not\r\ndemand your answer now. You shall have time to think it over. And in the\r\nmeantime, I have something to show you that will make you forget the\r\nrelatively insignificant conquest of your people. Come with me and I\r\nwill show you, even at this moment, the beginning of my conquest of a\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nHe signed to the two guards, who closed in on each side of the Princess\r\nonce more. She was then compelled to follow P’an-ku out of the throne\r\nroom and down a hallway which led to a large, bullet-shaped elevator.\r\nInto this they stepped, and were shot swiftly upward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         XXI. EARTH’S OFFENSIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Bevans at the helm and Roger Sanders in command, the mighty\r\ninterplanetary battleship which was the child of Ted Dustin’s fertile\r\nbrain, took off from Chicago just four days after Roger’s radio\r\nconversation with Maza, and one day before his appointment with her in\r\nPeilong.\r\n\r\nBuildings, housetops and thorofares were packed with millions of people\r\nwith every conceivable eye-aid from opera glasses to telescopes, tensely\r\nawaiting the departure of the “Luna”—for such she had been christened.\r\n\r\nShe was only two hundred feet in length—smaller than the mighty aerial\r\nbattleships of the United States Navy. But despite her relative\r\nsmallness, she could easily have wiped out, in a few minutes, the entire\r\nfleet of a hundred great aerial battleships which formed a cordon around\r\nTed’s plant, to see her off, and to fire parting salvos. The air about\r\nthis mighty fleet swarmed with every conceivable type of air craft from\r\nthe small helicopter taxicabs to huge passenger ships.\r\n\r\nEscorted by this stupendous array of air craft, the Luna soared\r\ngracefully upward to a height of ten miles—the utmost distance to which\r\nany of the other craft could follow her—then shot toward the zenith with\r\nsuch speed that in less than a minute she was lost to the view of the\r\nbeholders.\r\n\r\nBuilt for warfare of a type never previously contemplated by men of\r\nearth, she was a marvel of mechanical perfection and offensive and\r\ndefensive efficiency. Her powerful atomotor could send her through space\r\nat a speed far greater than that attained by any of the planets in\r\ncircling the sun—a speed so swift that no human eye could follow her\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nShe had two sets of degravitors—one for offensive and the other for\r\ndefensive purposes. Each of the four central turrets above deck mounted\r\nfour cannon-like degravitors that would disintegrate the toughest steel\r\nup to a distance of twenty-five thousand miles, and other substances at\r\nlesser or greater distances according to their various cohesive powers.\r\nThe two end turrets, fore and aft, each mounted six degravitors of the\r\nsame size and power as the others, and midway between keel and rail each\r\nside of the craft bristled with twelve more of these potent projectors\r\nof destruction, which were in movable, ball-in-socket mounts, capable of\r\nbeing pointed in any direction.\r\n\r\nThe defensive degravitors were much smaller and shorter than those to be\r\nused for offense, and instead of being pointed at the ends had short\r\nbarrels and flaring blunderbuss-like muzzles. Instead of projecting\r\ntheir anode and cathode rays in nearly parallel lines, these weapons\r\nshot them out at widely diverging angles—scattered them so much that,\r\nplaced as they were, their various rays united to form an invisible\r\nscreen about the craft, impervious either to matter, light rays, or\r\nenergy rays. When they were turned on the craft could have passed\r\nthrough a rapidly moving planetoid or even a planet without great shock,\r\nor danger either from heat, cold, or gravitational force. Sunlight, when\r\nstriking them, was neither reflected nor absorbed, but converted into a\r\nwhite, innocuous luminescence, electrically and magnetically neutral,\r\nyet visible and transparent—a physical paradox that seemed like a ghost\r\nof real light.\r\n\r\nWith these rays turned on, projectiles fired at the craft would be\r\ndisintegrated before they could reach it. Concentrated rays of either\r\ncontraction or dispersion, cold or hot, would be rendered harmless, even\r\nthough they might be admitted in the form of mild, ghostly light.\r\n\r\nSitting in the control cabin in the front of the craft, Roger watched\r\nthe earth swiftly receding while Bevans, seated before a bewildering\r\narray of levers and buttons sent the craft hurtling swiftly toward the\r\nmoon. The thick glass panels afforded a view upward, downward, straight\r\nahead, and to either side, and mirrors connected with periscopes gave a\r\nclear view to the rear.\r\n\r\n“This baby sure can step,” remarked Roger, glancing at his speedometer.\r\n“Thirty-five miles per second on the head at this instant.”\r\n\r\n“She can that, sir,” replied Bevans, “and I haven’t opened her up all\r\nthe way, either.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred and twenty-six thousand miles per hour,” calculated Roger,\r\n“and still accelerating. Why man, we’ll be there in a couple of hours at\r\nthis rate—a day ahead of time! It’s all right, though. We can hide out\r\nin some crater, do a little exploring, get accustomed to the lunar\r\ngravity and have target practice with the degravitors. We’ll need it if\r\nP’an-ku sends a bunch of those fighting globes of his after us.”\r\n\r\nPresently Roger looked out the forward window, then said:\r\n\r\n“We’re getting pretty close to the moon, now. Start easing her down\r\nwhile I decide on a landing place. Better not go too close to Copernicus\r\ntoday. Too near the scene of activities. We might get into a scrap\r\nbefore our allies get there. On the other hand, if we land at Tycho we\r\nmay be mistaken for enemies and have to fight Maza’s guards. I think the\r\nwise thing to do will be to land on the central peak of the crater,\r\nPitatus. It’s sort of in line between Tycho and Copernicus, and far\r\nenough from the latter so we would not be involved in a battle before\r\nwe’re ready. We can keep a sharp lookout, and duck down into that deep\r\nvalley between Pitatus and Hesiodus if we don’t care to fight an\r\napproaching enemy.”\r\n\r\nBevans, who had memorized the outstanding features of the moon,\r\ninstantly pointed the craft toward Pitatus while he gradually slowed her\r\nheadway with blasts from the forward exhaust arms of the atomotor.\r\n\r\nIn less than two hours after they left Chicago, they landed in a slight\r\ndepression on the sharp central peak of Pitatus.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was spent in degravitor practice, and in preparation\r\nfor the morrow’s battle. So far as light was concerned, the night was\r\nexactly like the day, nevertheless, officers and crew took their turns\r\nat sleeping and watching.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly noon of the next day by their earthly chronometers when\r\nRoger, who was about to give orders for the flight to Copernicus, was\r\nstartled by a call from a lookout in one of the turrets. The voice of\r\nthe man came from a small electric speaker at his elbow.\r\n\r\n“A big fleet of globes coming from the northeast, sir.”\r\n\r\nRoger took up his binoculars and trained them toward the northeast.\r\n\r\n“Must be at least a hundred of them,” he said to Bevans, “and they’re\r\ncoming at quite a lively clip. Too late to try and dodge out of sight\r\nnow. I think the best plan is to keep perfectly still. Moving objects\r\ncatch the eye much quicker than stationary ones.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe they’ll notice us here, at all, sir,” answered Bevans,\r\nusing his own glasses. “Looks as if they are going to pass right over\r\nthe center of Hesiodus, in which case they’ll miss us by about\r\nforty-five miles.”\r\n\r\nThe globes were traveling with such speed that it took but a minute for\r\nthem to confirm Bevans’ assertion, which they did, almost to a mile,\r\ncontinuing on toward the southwest.\r\n\r\n“Wonder what they’re up to,” mused Roger. “They seem to be heading\r\nstraight toward Tycho. Why, it’s plain as day. They’re sneaking over to\r\nattack Maza’s capital from above ground while she’s attacking theirs\r\nfrom below. Mighty clever of old P’an-ku. Well, here’s where our little\r\nLuna gets busy.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a few brief orders, and the Luna gently rose from her resting\r\nplace and set out after the menacing fleet. As soon as he got near\r\nenough to Tycho to use his binoculars, Roger saw that the battle was\r\nalready in progress. Red rays were flashing out at the invaders from the\r\ncrater walls and central peaks, and _nak-kar_ riders swarmed upward from\r\nthe underground shafts like bees from a hive. The raiders had formed in\r\na huge circle sixty miles in diameter, just outside the crater rim, and\r\nwere pouring their powerful green rays in on the defenders with deadly\r\neffect Roger saw two of the globes burst into flames and fall, but\r\nduring that time more than a score of the stationary rays were put out\r\nof business, and hundreds of _nak-kar_ riders were wiped out.\r\n\r\nThe fleet of P’an-ku was easily slated for a quick victory before the\r\nLuna suddenly entered the lists. Then the degravitors went into action,\r\nand the menacing globes began dropping right and left, emitting lurid\r\nflashes of light where the invisible rays struck them. Before a green\r\nray could even be trained toward the Luna half of the magnificent war\r\nfleet of P’an-ku had been destroyed. Then the green rays came thick and\r\nfast, but Roger did not mind them, for his degravitor barrage made them\r\nas harmless as sunlight.\r\n\r\nNot more than a dozen of the globes remained when the commander of the\r\nfleet evidently discovered that his rays could not harm the strange\r\ncraft from earth, and that his only chance for safety would be in\r\nflight. These remaining globes shot swiftly upward—so swiftly that it\r\nwas difficult for the eye to note their progress, but the Luna was after\r\nthem in an instant, and kept them well in range while her marksmen used\r\nthe degravitors with deadly effect. Soon but one lone globe remained. It\r\nseemed to have an especially clever helmsman, who dodged hither and\r\nthither with such speed and in such unexpected ways that he had been\r\nable to elude the Luna’s gunners. He suddenly set out in a zig-zag\r\ncourse toward Copernicus, with the Luna in swift pursuit. A degravitor\r\nray brought him down inside the crater just after he had crossed the rim\r\nand was ready to drop to safety.\r\n\r\nBevans was unable to instantly check the forward flight of the Luna, and\r\nher momentum carried her ten miles past the crater rim and only a little\r\nover fifteen miles from the nearest central peak. Hundreds of powerful\r\ngreen rays instantly flashed up at the invader, and giant globes swarmed\r\nupward from the yawning mouths of mighty shafts, to attack. The globes\r\nwere cut down by Roger’s marksmen almost as fast as they emerged, and\r\nthe green rays did no damage.\r\n\r\nThen there suddenly flashed from the second peak of the central group, a\r\nmighty green ray so powerful it would easily have made a thousand of the\r\nsmaller defensive rays. It was pointed straight upward at the earth\r\nhanging in the heavens above them, and the spot where it\r\nstruck—apparently some five hundred miles in diameter, plainly showed as\r\na great greenish-white area in the Pacific Ocean when, a moment later,\r\nthe ray winked out.\r\n\r\nThe operators evidently had stopped for a moment to note its\r\neffect—perhaps to send a radio message to earth demanding instant\r\nsurrender or threatening annihilation.\r\n\r\n“Turn the degravitors on the peak of that mountain,” ordered Roger. “The\r\nglobes can wait. We’ll get them later.”\r\n\r\nBefore his instructions could be carried out it seemed that the ray\r\noperator had anticipated them, for the huge green ray flashed out once\r\nmore, but this time it did not strike the earth. Instead, its powerful,\r\ndeadly green light enveloped the Luna.\r\n\r\nAlthough the earth-craft was insulated against the cold of absolute\r\nzero, and was, in addition, protected by her aura of degravitor rays,\r\nshe could not help feeling the tremendous power of the terrific\r\ndeenergizing rays. In an instant her interior temperature, which had\r\nbeen kept comfortably warm at 70° Fahrenheit, dropped to the freezing\r\npoint and rapidly went lower.\r\n\r\n“Up,” ordered Roger, and Bevans shot the craft upward, temporarily\r\nescaping the paralyzing effect of the great ray. But the projector could\r\nbe turned swiftly, and in a moment it was trained on them again. It was\r\nnow the turn of the Luna to do some zig-zagging and dodging. As for her\r\noffensive tactics, Roger found that his degravitor rays were rendered\r\nharmless when in conflict with the rays from the great projector, and\r\nonly took effect at times when they could, for a moment, elude the huge\r\ngreen beam which came from the mountain top.\r\n\r\n“We can’t keep this up,” said Roger, as the cabin grew colder and\r\ncolder. “Try diving toward the base of the mountain, then up beneath the\r\nprojector. I don’t believe it can be pointed towards its own base, and\r\nP’an-ku will destroy his own city if he points it downward too far.”\r\n\r\nBevans instantly dropped the craft to within a hundred feet of the\r\ncrater floor, then shot toward the base of the peak on which the ray was\r\nmounted. The mighty green ray followed them down so far it clipped a\r\ngreat valley through the crater wall behind them, but it could go no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n“Now!” said Roger, “Let them have it!”\r\n\r\nThe degravitors were instantly trained on the mountain peak while the\r\ncraft shot swiftly upward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         XXII. FALL OF PEILONG\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Tzien Khan and his four painted torturers confronting him in his\r\ndungeon cell, Ted Dustin tried frantically to reach his pistol\r\ndegravitor through the hole he had scraped in his insulating armor, but\r\nhis efforts were of no avail. The hole was too small. He quickly dropped\r\nhis hand to his side in order that his attempt to reach the weapon might\r\nnot be detected.\r\n\r\nTzien Khan took a key from his belt pouch, and said:\r\n\r\n“Bend down your head, O spawn of a maggot, that I may remove your\r\ncollar. And if you have a god, pray to him, for you have but a short\r\ntime to live.”\r\n\r\nTed bent over as directed, and as he did so he heard a tearing sound\r\nthat filled his heart with hope. While Tzien Khan fumbled with his\r\ncollar lock his hand stole to his right hip and confirmed his hopes. The\r\nact of stooping over had completed the work of the past few days, and\r\nhis fingers closed over the butt of his degravitor.\r\n\r\nAs the collar dropped from about his neck, Tzien Khan ordered him to\r\nstraighten up. He obeyed, but as he did so, whipped out his degravitor,\r\npressed the trigger, and swung it in a narrow arc. The Khan and his four\r\ntorturers were wiped out before one of them had an opportunity to use a\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Ted Dustin!” called Shen Ho from the opposite cell. “I had\r\ngiven you up for dead.”\r\n\r\nWith the aid of his degravitor, Ted quickly got rid of his clumsy suit\r\nof insulating armor and appeared before the astonished Shen Ho in the\r\nrich garments of black and gold he had worn in Maza’s court. Then he\r\nreleased his fellow prisoner by the simple expedient of flashing the\r\ndegravitor rays for an instant on the collar lock.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was freed from his metal collar, Shen Ho armed himself\r\nwith the weapons of Tzien Khan, belting the richly jeweled sword and ray\r\nprojector about his waist. Then he took the weapons of the others, made\r\nthem into a bundle bound together with one of the belts, and strapping\r\nthe head lamp of Tzien Khan to his forehead, said:\r\n\r\n“Come, Ted Dustin. Help me release my brothers, and I will help you\r\nfind, and, if the great Lord Sun wills, to slay the cruel tyrant who\r\ndisgraces the great name of P’an-ku.”\r\n\r\n“If you will help me to find and destroy the big green ray he is going\r\nto use against the earth I’ll go anywhere with you,” answered Ted.\r\n\r\n“That I promise to do, also, or give my life in the attempt,” replied\r\nShen Ho as they hurried along the passageway.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived in the circular room at the base of the spiral ramp,\r\nShen Ho turned into the first passageway at his right. Other than bones\r\nand dead bodies, he found only four half dead wretches, none of whom he\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nHurrying out of this passageway, he entered the next, and to his delight\r\nfound Fen Ho, his youngest brother, alive and able to travel. After the\r\nyoung inventor of the projectiles and firing mechanism had been released\r\nand armed, the three men hurried out to the central room and back to the\r\nother passageways, one at a time, to search for Wen Ho. They found the\r\ninventor of the flying globe in the last passageway, sick, and barely\r\nable to talk. Shen Ho took a small phial of medicine from the belt pouch\r\nof Tzien Khan, a little of which he dropped on his brother’s tongue. Fen\r\nHo, meanwhile, busied himself with cutting the collar from his brother’s\r\nneck with his green ray projector, and belting a sword and projector\r\nabout his waist.\r\n\r\nThe medicine, it appeared, had marvelous stimulating qualities, for Wen\r\nHo quickly recovered his strength, and not only was able to travel with\r\nsword and projector belted to him, but insisted on carrying one of the\r\nlong spears with a buzz saw-like head, which the torturers of Tzien Khan\r\nhad dropped, and which Shen Ho had brought in his bundle.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Shen Ho, “we must pass through the torture chambers in order\r\nto get to the upper rooms of the palace. Every man must have his weapons\r\nready as the torturers of Tzien Khan are armed, and quick to draw.”\r\n\r\nTed, with a degravitor in each hand, now insisted on taking the lead as\r\nthey mounted the spiral ramp. On the way up, he met a guard, whose head\r\ninstantly vanished from the man’s neck before a leveled degravitor, and\r\nwhose weapons were appropriated by the Ho brothers.\r\n\r\nShen Ho extinguished his head lamp, now no longer necessary because of\r\nthe yellow rays from small globes of luminous liquid, and enjoined\r\nabsolute silence. As they mounted higher, however, this precaution was\r\nmade unnecessary by the agonized shrieks of the tortured victims above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the door of the torture chamber, Ted, with both\r\ndegravitors ready for action, led a quick rush into the room. Twenty\r\npainted torturers, taken by surprise, reached for their weapons, but not\r\none reached in time. Then Ted and Fen Ho plunged into the series of\r\nsmaller chambers on the right, while Shen Ho and Wen Ho took those on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nOne after another, painted torturers went down before the degravitors of\r\nTed or the green ray projectors of Fen Ho. Presently they reached the\r\nlast chamber of the series and found no torturer present. It was\r\noccupied by but one victim, and Ted cried out in surprise as he\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\n“Professor Ederson!” he exclaimed, “and I thought you safe in Chicago!”\r\n\r\nA flash of his degravitor cut the heavy cable which held the cylinder of\r\nwater that was straining the professor’s neck cords, and it crashed to\r\nthe floor. Then, while Fen Ho swiftly released the savant’s hands and\r\nfeet, Ted removed the helmet and chin clamp.\r\n\r\nThe professor attempted to speak, but his voice failed him, and he\r\nsuddenly fainted, toppling into the arms of his young friend.\r\n\r\n“I’ll carry him to the main torture chamber,” said Ted. “You find Shen\r\nHo and get that little bottle of medicine that revived Wen Ho. It may\r\nwork on my friend.”\r\n\r\n“It will,” replied Fen Ho, speeding away.\r\n\r\nWhen Ted reached the central chamber with the slight form of the\r\nprofessor drooping in his arms, he found the three Ho brothers awaiting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Every torturer has been slain,” said Shen Ho as he dropped some\r\nmedicine on the tongue of the professor, “and no alarm has been given as\r\nyet, but we must work swiftly.”\r\n\r\nThe professor regained consciousness and the power of speech with\r\nremarkable speed, while Fen Ho and Wen Ho busied themselves with\r\nreleasing such torture victims as were not yet mortally injured and\r\nmercifully dispatching the others. These men were armed with the weapons\r\nof the torturers and instructed to hold the chambers against all comers.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Ted,” said the professor, “and these friends of yours for\r\nsaving my life. I had reached the end of my rope both literally and\r\nfiguratively. A few more drops of water in that cylinder would have\r\nsnapped my cervical vertebrae.”\r\n\r\nTed introduced the three brothers to his old friend, and in a few\r\nmoments the professor declared himself able not only to walk unaided,\r\nbut to bear weapons. He declined one of the pistol degravitors when it\r\nwas preferred him, but took a green ray projector, sword, and buzz-saw\r\nspear.\r\n\r\n“Now for that big projector of P’an-ku’s,” said Ted.\r\n\r\n“It will be in the second peak,” answered Shen Ho. “Follow me, and I’ll\r\nget you there in the shortest possible time.”\r\n\r\nHe led them along a narrow, winding passageway in which two palace\r\nattendants were met and summarily dispatched, to the base of a\r\ncylindrical shaft in which there was a diamond-shaped door. Shen Ho\r\npulled once, then twice, then once again, on a tasselled cord that hung\r\ndown from the center door, and the clang of a gong within answered each\r\npull. Then there was a humming sound from behind the door, and it slid\r\nupward, revealing the interior of a large, bullet-shaped car with a lone\r\noperator who was attired in armor of brown metal and wore a sword and\r\nray projector in his belt.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he see the five men in the passageway, than he reached for\r\nthe control lever with one hand and his ray projector with the other. He\r\nhad no chance to use either, however, for Wen Ho, anticipating this,\r\nswiftly thrust with his buzz-saw spear for the neck of the operator. As\r\nhe thrust, he pressed a button in the side of the shaft which started\r\nthe blade whirling and Ted, for the first time, saw the terrible\r\nefficiency of this weapon, the teeth of which cut through the armor\r\nplate as if it had been cheese, instantly shearing the head of the guard\r\nfrom his body.\r\n\r\nThen body and head were tossed from the car, and the five men, with Shen\r\nHo at the controls, shot upward.\r\n\r\nThrough the small diamond-shaped windows of the car, Ted saw that they\r\npresently shot above the roof of the palace, swiftly climbing a slender\r\ncable which extended up into the stalactite covered vault above. Just\r\nbeyond the distant city walls, in every direction, he could see the\r\nflashing of green and red rays which told him that Maza was attacking\r\nthe city, though he did not suspect that she had been taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe car continued to travel upward on the slender cable until it entered\r\nan enormous, cone-shaped shaft more than a mile in diameter at the base,\r\nand slanting upward toward a glassed in opening at the top which was\r\nabout five hundred feet across, and admitted a considerable amount of\r\nlight to which there was a queer, greenish cast.\r\n\r\nShen Ho, also looking upward, said:\r\n\r\n“See, Ted Dustin. Already they are using the great ray against your\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“I hope and pray that we will be able to prevent them from using it much\r\nlonger,” replied Ted.\r\n\r\n“Amen,” said the professor fervently.\r\n\r\nAlthough the car was traveling upward in the shaft, which was plainly a\r\nvolcanic crater, at a terrific rate of speed, Ted chafed impatiently\r\nuntil Shen Ho moved the control lever, gradually bringing it to a stop.\r\nHe moved another lever and the diamond-shaped door slid upward,\r\nrevealing a railed landing platform fastened to the side of the crater.\r\n\r\nTed was the first to step out, and as he did so, he saw a party of\r\npeople not more than fifty feet away on the same platform. Instantly he\r\nrecognized the slender figure of Maza, still in her shining armor, being\r\ndragged along between two burly warriors while P’an-ku walked ahead.\r\nThey had just stepped out of a car similar to the one in which he and\r\nhis companions had come up, and P’an-ku, one foot on a winding stairway\r\nwhich led up into the rock, was saying:\r\n\r\n“So now, little white Princess, I will show you the conquest of a world,\r\nafter which you will perhaps not think so ill of me as a prospective\r\nhusband. At the head of these stairs is my—”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, for Ted, at this instant, blasted the\r\nheads from both the warriors who held Maza, with his degravitors, and\r\nthe sound of their armored bodies clattering to the floor interrupted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe whirled, whipping out a green ray projector, but before he could\r\nlevel it, Ted had destroyed it with a flash from one of his degravitors.\r\nHe could as easily have destroyed his arch enemy then and there, but\r\npreferred to take him prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” he commanded, “or—”\r\n\r\nThe sentence remained unfinished, for P’an-ku, with an alacrity which\r\nwas astounding for one of his weight and years, had suddenly turned and\r\ndarted up the winding stairway, disappearing beyond a curve in the wall.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the professor and the three Ho brothers had stepped out\r\non the platform and were gazing at Ted, the Princess, and the two fallen\r\nwarriors in an effort to understand just what had taken place.\r\n\r\n“Guard the Princess,” Ted called to them. “I’m going after P’an-ku.”\r\n\r\nWith one terrific leap he landed at the foot of the stairway, then\r\nbounded up taking ten steps at a time with ease, momentarily expecting\r\nto overtake the yellow monarch around each curve. But P’an-ku had had a\r\ngood start, and evidently was climbing with a speed far greater than\r\nthat of which he appeared capable.\r\n\r\nAt length Ted sighted him, climbing a metal ladder which led upward from\r\na platform at the head of the stairway to a room above which was filled\r\nwith an intricate array of machinery worked by more than a score of\r\narmed men and guarded by an equal number. Just above it the giant green\r\nray flashed out horizontally.\r\n\r\nThis time it was no part of Ted’s intention to waste words on P’an-ku.\r\nDeliberately he raised a degravitor and sighted for the bullet head of\r\nthe monarch.\r\n\r\nBut before he could press the trigger there was a blinding flash of\r\nlight, and the monarch, ladder, men, machinery and projector—all\r\ndisappeared from view as completely as if they had never existed. Then\r\nthere hove into view the prow of a flying vessel on which was inscribed\r\nthe word “Luna,” and Ted shouted for joy, waving frantically at two\r\nfigures in the control cabin whom he recognized as Roger and Bevans.\r\n\r\nThe air where he stood was being rapidly vitiated by its sudden contact\r\nwith the tenuous atmosphere of the outer surface, but Ted stayed long\r\nenough to gesture toward the glazed top of the shaft, patted his\r\ndegravitor, and then pointed one finger downward. Roger nodded as if he\r\nunderstood, and the Luna started for the glazed opening. Then the young\r\nscientist, gasping for breath, plunged down the stairway to the platform\r\nwhere Maza, the professor, and the Ho brothers awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe Luna had already cut through the glazed top when he arrived, and was\r\ndescending toward the little group on the platform. She drew alongside,\r\nopened a door and admitted them before there was any notable change in\r\nthe quality of the air.\r\n\r\nIn the happy reunion that followed, Ted, with his arm around his radiant\r\nlittle Princess, presented each of his friends in turn. Then he said:\r\n\r\n“We still have work to do. The army of the Princess is storming the city\r\nand, I’m afraid, fighting a losing battle against the globes of\r\nP’an-ku.”\r\n\r\n“We can settle those globes in short order,” replied Roger. “After ’em,\r\nBevans! You should have seen what we did to the fleet sent against\r\nUltu.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do to them?”\r\n\r\n“Cleaned ’em out to the last globe,” replied Roger.\r\n\r\n“Then you saved my city!” exclaimed Maza. “How can I thank you?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t thank me,” replied Roger, “thank Ted. Besides, he’s in a better\r\nposition to collect a reward than I am. Excuse me, please, while I\r\ndirect the degravitor fire.”\r\n\r\nProtected by her degravitor barrage, the Luna first descended to a\r\nposition just above the great docks of P’an-ku, where she made short\r\nwork of the reserve fleet. Then she rose and circled the city, safe from\r\nthe menace of either red or green rays, leveling the walls with her keel\r\ndegravitors while the gunners in the turrets picked off the globes.\r\n\r\nQuickly recognizing a friend in the strange and seemingly indestructible\r\ncraft, the hosts of Ultu cheered, and went into the battle with\r\nredoubled vigor. In less than twenty minutes after the Luna had come on\r\nthe scene, the last globe was destroyed and the city was in the hands of\r\nMaza’s army.\r\n\r\nThe Luna stopped in the palace courtyard for several hours, during which\r\ntime Maza proclaimed Shen Ho Viceroy of Peilong—then proceeded to Ultu,\r\nwhere Ted and his Princess were married in regal magnificence, according\r\nto the ancient rites and customs of Maza’s people.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTIS ADELBERT KLINE has been described by the founder of The Burroughs\r\nBibliophiles as “the only author to be compared with Edgar Rice\r\nBurroughs, but whose work is as original as Burroughs’ own.” A\r\ncontemporary of the author of Tarzan, Kline wrote his own series of\r\nnovels of interplanetary adventures, all of which have become classics\r\nof science-fiction. Available from Ace Books are the following:\r\n\r\n  THE SWORDSMAN OF MARS (D-516)\r\n  THE OUTLAWS OF MARS (D-531)\r\n  PLANET OF PERIL (F-211)\r\n  PRINCE OF PERIL (F-259)\r\n  THE PORT OF PERIL (F-294)\r\n\r\nand another story of “The Planet of Peril” is included in the anthology\r\nSWORDSMEN IN THE SKY (F-311).\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: Maza of the Moon]\r\n\r\n\r\n              ONE MAN AGAINST THE HIDDEN WORLD OF THE MOON\r\n\r\nAs soon as he arrived on the Moon, Ted Dustin found himself thrown into\r\ndesperate action. _Maza an Ma Gong_, the beautiful ruler of the friendly\r\nfaction of Moon-people, had been attacked by a weird globe-ship, and had\r\nfallen with her winged mount to the surface. As Ted hurried to her\r\nrescue he saw a fantastic sight:\r\n\r\nThe girl was standing at bay before one of the round-bodied enemy\r\nMoon-men. The two were fencing—not with blades of steel, but with ray\r\nprojectors. As Maza sought to reach her antagonist with her red ray he\r\nwarded it off with a green ray from his own projector, and in turn\r\nmenaced her with his weapon while she parried with the red ray.\r\n\r\nTed drew his pistol degravitor to dispatch the man—but he was unaware\r\nthat there were many more of the enemy creeping toward them in the dark\r\nof the Moon’s surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Copyright notice provided as in the original—this e-text is public\r\n  domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n--Generated a Table of Contents based on the original chapter headings.\r\n\r\n--Omitted still-copyrighted illustrations from the printed original.\r\n\r\n--Generated a new Cover Image based on elements from the book.\r\n\r\n--Silently corrected palpable typos; left non-standard spellings and\r\n  dialect unchanged.\r\n\r\n--In the text versions, delimited italics text in _underscores_ (the\r\n  HTML version reproduces the font form of the printed book.)\r\n\r\n--Reversed the order of pages 86 and 87 to make the text coherent (and\r\n  marked the exact limits of the re-ordered blocks by a dagger, †).",
