A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the passage of the \"Free Alcohol Act\" there has been a constantly\r\nincreasing demand for information as to the manufacture of industrial\r\nalcohol. This, with the favorable reception accorded to the first edition\r\nof this book has lead the publishers to bring out a second edition.\r\n\r\nThe entire volume has been carefully revised and not only has the\r\noriginal text been amplified but new chapters have been added explaining\r\nthe most modern and approved methods and appliances both as used in\r\nEurope and in this country. Another valuable feature of the present\r\nvolume is the collection of U. S. de-naturing formulas covering the\r\nspecial denaturants necessitated by the various arts and by the\r\nGovernment requirements. The chapters on modern distilling apparatus\r\nrectifiers and modern plants have been very carefully prepared in order\r\nto give the reader a clear idea of the various types of apparatus in use\r\nto-day and of their general place in a distillery system. The value of\r\nthe book has been further increased by numerous additional illustrations.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in the compass of one small volume to describe all\r\nthe practical details of alcohol manufacture particularly as these\r\ndetails vary with every distillery, but it has been the aim of the author\r\nto give sufficient information to enable every reader to understand the\r\ntheory and general practice of the art, leading him from the simple\r\nmethods and apparatus used until the last ten years to the more\r\ncomplicated stills and processes which have been lately devised.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the manufacture of industrial alcohol has been most highly\r\nperfected in France and Germany, use has been made of the best European\r\nauthorities and in particular the author begs to acknowledge his\r\nindebtedness to Sa Majeste L'Alcohol by L. Beaudry de Saunier. The\r\npublishers' and author's acknowledgements are also due to the Vulcan\r\nCopper Works Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, and to the Geo. L. Squier\r\nManufacturing Company, Buffalo, New York, for their kindness in allowing\r\nillustrations to be given of modern American distilling apparatus.\r\n\r\n                                                         F. B. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n     New York, Aug. 1, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the majority of persons Alcohol connotes liquor. That it is used to\r\nsome extent in the arts, that it is a fuel, is also common knowledge, but\r\nAlcohol as a source of power, as a substitute for gasoline, petroleum,\r\nand kindred hydrocarbons was hardly known to the generality of Americans\r\nuntil the passage of the \"De-naturing Act\" by the last Congress.\r\n\r\nThen Alcohol leaped at once into fame,--not merely as the humble servant\r\nof the pocket lamp, nor as the Demon Rum, but as a substitute for all the\r\nvarious forms of cheap hydrocarbon fuels, and as a new farm product, a\r\nnew means for turning the farmer's grain, fruit, potatoes, etc., into\r\nthat greatest of all Powers, _Money_.\r\n\r\nThat Alcohol was capable of this work was no new discovery accomplished\r\nby the fiat of Congress, but the Act of June 7, 1906, freed de-natured\r\nAlcohol from the disability it had previously labored under,--namely, the\r\nhigh internal revenue tax, and so cheapened its cost that it could be\r\neconomically used for purposes in the arts and manufactures which the\r\nformer tax forbade.\r\n\r\nThis Act then opens the door of a new market to the farmer and the\r\nmanufacturer, and it is in answer to the increased desire for\r\ninformation as to the source of Alcohol and its preparation that this\r\nbook has been written. The processes described are thoroughly reliable\r\nand are such as have the approval of experience.\r\n\r\nAs was stated above, Alcohol is not a natural product, but is formed by\r\nthe decomposition of sugar or glucose through fermentation. This leaves\r\nAlcohol mixed with water, and these in turn are separated by\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nThe literature treating of the distillation of Alcohol from farm products\r\nis very scant. But due credit is here given to the following foreign\r\nworks which have been referred to: Spon's EncyclopÊdia of the Industrial\r\nArts, which also contains an article on Wood Alcohol, Mr. Bayley's\r\nexcellent Pocketbook for Chemists, and Mr. Noel Deerr's fine work on\r\nSugar and Sugar Cane.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK,\r\n    Oct. 31, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                ALCOHOL, ITS VARIOUS FORMS AND SOURCES.\r\n\r\n  Its chemical structure.

Formula, C_{2}H_{6}O.\r\n\r\nPure alcohol is a liquid substance, composed of carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen, in the following proportions:\r\n\r\n                            C     52.17\r\n                            H     13.04\r\n                            O     34.79\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100.00\r\n\r\nIt is the most important member of an important series of organic\r\ncompounds, all of which resemble each other closely, and possess many\r\nanalogous properties. They are classed by the chemist under the generic\r\ntitle of \"Alcohols.\"\r\n\r\nAlcohol does not occur in nature; it is the product of the decomposition\r\nof sugar, or, more properly, of _glucose_, which, under the influence of\r\ncertain organic, nitrogenous substances, called _ferments_ is split up\r\ninto alcohol and carbonic anhydride. The latter is evolved in the form of\r\ngas, alcohol remaining behind mixed with water, from which it is\r\nseparated by distillation. The necessary purification is effected in a\r\nvariety of ways.\r\n\r\n     TABLE I.--THE BOILING POINTS OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS OF DIFFERENT\r\n   STRENGTHS, AND THE PROPORTIONS OF ALCOHOL IN THE VAPORS GIVEN OFF.\r\n\r\n  ===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========\r\n   Proportion|           |Proportion |Proportion |           |Proportion\r\n   of alcohol|Temperature|of alcohol |of alcohol |Temperature|of alcohol\r\n     in the  |  of the   |in the     |  in the   |  of the   |  in the\r\n    boiling  |  boiling  |condensed  |  boiling  |  boiling  |condensed\r\n   liquid in |  liquid.  |vapor in   | liquid in |  liquid.  | vapor in\r\n   100 vols. |           |100 vols.  | 100 vols. |           | 100 vols.\r\n  -----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n      92     |  171.0 F. |    93     |     20    |  189.5 F. |    71\r\n      90     |  171.5 F. |    92     |     18    |  191.6 F. |    68\r\n      85     |  172.0 F. |    91.5   |     15    |  194.0 F. |    66\r\n      80     |  172.7 F. |    90.5   |     12    |  196.1 F. |    61\r\n      75     |  173.6 F. |    90     |     10    |  198.5 F. |    55\r\n      70     |  175.0 F. |    89     |      7    |  200.6 F. |    50\r\n      65     |  176.0 F. |    87     |      5    |  203.0 F. |    42\r\n      50     |  178.1 F. |    85     |      3    |  205.1 F. |    36\r\n      40     |  180.5 F. |    82     |      2    |  207.5 F. |    28\r\n      35     |  182.6 F. |    80     |      1    |  209.9 F. |    13\r\n      30     |  185.0 F. |    78     |      0    |  212.0 F. |     0\r\n      25     |  187.1 F. |    76     |           |           |\r\n  ===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========\r\n\r\nPure, absolute alcohol is a colorless, mobile, very volatile liquid,\r\nhaving a hot, burning taste, and a pungent and somewhat agreeable odor.\r\nIt is very inflammable, burning in the air with a bluish-yellow flame,\r\nevolving much heat, leaving no residue, and forming vapors of carbonic\r\nanhydride and water. Its specific gravity at 0∞ C (32∞ F.) is .8095, and\r\nat 15.5∞ C. (60∞ F.) .794; that of its vapor is 1.613. It boils at 78.4∞\r\nC. (173∞ F.). The boiling point of its aqueous mixtures are raised in\r\nproportion to the quantity of water present. Mixtures of alcohol and\r\nwater when boiled give off at first a vapor rich in alcohol, and\r\ncontaining but little aqueous vapor; if the ebullition be continued a\r\npoint is ultimately reached when all the alcohol has been driven off and\r\nnothing but pure water remains. Thus, by repeated distillations alcohol\r\nmay be obtained from its mixtures with water in an almost anhydrous\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nAbsolute alcohol has a strong affinity for water. It absorbes moisture\r\nfrom the air rapidly, and thereby becomes gradually weaker; it should\r\ntherefore be kept in tightly-stoppered bottles. When brought into contact\r\nwith animal tissues, it deprives them of the water necessary for their\r\nconstitution, and acts in this way as an energetic poison. Considerable\r\nheat is disengaged when alcohol and water are brought together; if,\r\nhowever, ice be substituted for water, heat is absorbed, owing to the\r\nimmediate and rapid conversion of the ice into the liquid state. When one\r\npart of snow is mixed with two parts of alcohol, a temperature as low as\r\n5.8∞ F. below zero is reached.\r\n\r\nWhen alcohol and water are mixed together the resulting liquid occupies,\r\nafter agitation, a less volume than the sum of the two original liquids.\r\nThis contraction is greatest when the mixture is made in the proportion\r\nof 52.3 volumes of alcohol and 47.7 volumes of water, the result being,\r\ninstead of 100 volumes, 96.35. A careful examination of the liquid when\r\nit is being agitated reveals a vast number of minute air-bubbles, which\r\nare discharged from every point of the mixture. This is due to the fact\r\nthat gases which are held in solution by the alcohol and water separately\r\nare less soluble when the two are brought together; and the contraction\r\ndescribed above is the natural result of the disengagement of such\r\ndissolved gases. The following table represents the contraction undergone\r\nby different mixtures of absolute alcohol and water.\r\n\r\n              TABLE II.--100 VOLUMES OF MIXTURE AT 59∞ F.\r\n\r\n  ========+============++========+============++========+============\r\n  Alcohol.|Contraction.||Alcohol.|Contraction.||Alcohol.|Contraction.\r\n  --------+------------++--------+------------++--------+------------\r\n    100   |    0.00    ||   65   |    3.61    ||   30   |    2.72\r\n     95   |    1.18    ||   60   |    3.73    ||   25   |    2.24\r\n     90   |    1.94    ||   55   |    3.77    ||   20   |    1.72\r\n     85   |    2.47    ||   50   |    3.74    ||   15   |    1.20\r\n     80   |    2.87    ||   45   |    3.64    ||   10   |    0.72\r\n     75   |    3.19    ||   40   |    3.44    ||    5   |    0.31\r\n     70   |    3.44    ||   35   |    3.14    ||        |\r\n  ========+============++========+============++========+============\r\n\r\nAlcohol is termed \"absolute\" when it has been deprived of every trace of\r\nwater, and when its composition is exactly expressed by its chemical\r\nformula. To obtain it in this state it must be subjected to a series of\r\ndelicate operations in the laboratory, which it would be impossible to\r\nperform on an industrial scale. In commerce it is known only in a state\r\nof greater or less dilution.\r\n\r\nAlcohol possesses the power of dissolving a large number of substances\r\ninsoluble in water and acids, such as many inorganic salts, phosphorus,\r\nsulphur, iodine, resins, essential oils, fats, coloring matters, etc. It\r\nprecipitates albumen, gelatine, starch, gum, and other substances from\r\ntheir solutions. These properties render it an invaluable agent in the\r\nhands of the chemist.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is found in, and may be obtained from, all substances--vegetable\r\nor other--which contain sugar. As stated above, it does not exist in\r\nthese in the natural state, but is the product of the decomposition by\r\nfermentation of the saccharine principle contained therein; this\r\ndecomposition yields the spirit in a very dilute state, but it is readily\r\nseparated from the water with which it is mixed by processes of\r\ndistillation, which will subsequently be described. The amount of alcohol\r\nwhich may be obtained from the different unfermented substances which\r\nyield it varies considerably, depending entirely upon the quantity of\r\nsugar which they contain.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is produced either from raw materials containing starch, as\r\npotatoes, corn, barley, etc., or raw materials containing sugar, as\r\ngrapes, beets, sugar-cane, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most important sources from which alcohol\r\nis obtained: Grapes, apricots, cherries, peaches, currents, gooseberries,\r\nraspberries, strawberries, figs, plums, bananas, and many tropical\r\nfruits, artichokes, potatoes, carrots, turnips, beet-root, sweet corn,\r\nrice and other grains. Sugar-cane refuse, sorgum, molasses, wood, paper,\r\nand by a new French process from acetylene. On a large scale alcohol is\r\nusually obtained from sugar beets, molasses or the starch contained in\r\npotatoes, corn and other grains. The starch is converted into maltose by\r\nmixing with an infusion of malt. The maltose is then fermented by yeast.\r\nSulphuric acid may be used to convert even woody fibre, paper, linen,\r\netc., into glucose, which may in turn be converted into alcohol.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE III.--PRINCIPAL ALCOHOLS.\r\n\r\n  =================+=======================+==============+==============\r\n  Chemical Name.   |        Source.        |   Formula.   |Boiling Point\r\n                                                                 ∞F.\r\n  -----------------+-----------------------+--------------+--------------\r\n   1 Methyl Alcohol|Distillation of Wood   |CH_{3}OH      |    150.8\r\n   2 Ethyl     \"   |Fermentation of sugar  |C_{2}H_{5}OH  |    172.4\r\n   3 Propyl    \"   |   \"         \" grapes  |C_{3}H_{7}OH  |    206.6\r\n   4 Butyl     \"   |   \"         \" beets   |C_{4}H_{9}OH  |    242.6\r\n   5 Amyl      \"   |   \"         \" potatoes|C_{5}H_{11}OH |    278.6\r\n   6 Caproyl   \"   |   \"         \" grapes  |C_{6}H_{13}OH |    314.6\r\n   7 Aenanthyl \"   |Distillation castor oil|C_{7}H_{15}OH |    347.\r\n                   |  with potatoes        |              |\r\n   8 Capryl    \"   |Essential oil hog weed |C_{8}H_{17}OH |    375.8\r\n   9 Nonyl     \"   |Nonane from petroleum  |C_{9}H_{19}OH |\r\n  10 Rutyl     \"   |Oil of Rue             |C_{10}H_{21}OH|\r\n  11 Cytyl     \"   |Spermaceti             |C_{16}H_{33}OH|\r\n  12 Ceryl     \"   |Chinese wax            |C_{26}H_{53}OH|\r\n  13 Melisyl   \"   |Bees' wax              |C_{30}H_{61}OH|\r\n  =================+=======================+==============+==============\r\n\r\nAmong a variety of other substances which have been and are still used\r\nfor the production of alcohol in smaller quantities, are roots of many\r\nkinds, such as those of asphodel, madder, etc. Seeds and nuts have been\r\nmade to yield it. It will thus be seen that the sources of this\r\nsubstance are practically innumerable; anything, in fact, which contains\r\nor can be converted into sugar is what is termed \"alcoholisable.\"\r\n\r\nAlcohol has become a substance of such prime necessity in the arts and\r\nmanufactures, and in one form or another enter so largely into the\r\ncomposition of the common beverages consumed by all classes of people\r\nthat its manufacture must, of necessity, rank among the most important\r\nindustries of this and other lands.\r\n\r\nOf the alcohols given in the above table only two concern the ordinary\r\ndistiller, or producer of alcohol for general use in the arts. Methyl\r\nalcohol, the ordinary \"wood alcohol,\" or wood naphtha, and Ethyl alcohol,\r\nwhich is produced by the fermentation of sugar and may therefore be made\r\nfrom anything which contains sugar.\r\n\r\nEthyl alcohol forms the subject of this treatise. Aside from its chemical\r\nuse in the arts as a source of energy and as a fuel, alcohol will likely\r\nsoon compete with petroleum, gasoline, kerosene, etc., under the Act of\r\nCongress freeing the \"de-naturized\" spirit from the Internal Revenue tax.\r\nThis act and the de-naturing process are covered in the last chapters of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n              THE PREPARATION OF MASHES, AND FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcohol may be produced either from, (1) farinacious materials, such as\r\npotatoes or grains, (2), from sacchariferous substances such as grapes,\r\nsugar beets, sugar cane, or the molasses produced in sugar manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE PREPARATION OF STARCHY MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n=Saccharification.= =Preparatory Mashing.= With starchy materials it is\r\nfirst necessary to convert the starch into a sugar from which alcohol can\r\nbe produced by the process of fermentation. This is called\r\nsaccharification.\r\n\r\n=Gelatinizing.= The first step in this process is gelatinizing the\r\nstarch;--that is, forming it into a paste by heating it with water, or\r\ninto a liquid mass by steaming it under high pressure. The liquid or\r\nsemi-liquid mass is then run into a preparatory mash vat and cooled.\r\n\r\n=Saccharifying.= The disintegrated raw materials or gelatinized starch in\r\nthe preparatory mash vat is now to be \"saccharified\" or converted into\r\nsugar. This is effected by allowing malt to act on the starch. This malt\r\ncontains a certain chemical \"ferment\" or enzyme, called \"diastase\" (\"I\r\nseparate\").\r\n\r\nThis is able under proper conditions to break up the gelatinized starch\r\ninto simpler substances--the dextrins--and later into a fermentable sugar\r\ncalled maltose.\r\n\r\n=Fermentation.=--The maltose or sugar in the \"mash\" is now to be\r\nconverted into alcohol. This is accomplished by fermentation, a process\r\nof decomposition which converts the sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol.\r\nFermentation is started by yeast, a fungus growth, which in the course of\r\nits life history produces a matter called zymose which chemically acts on\r\nthe sugar to split it up into carbonic acid gas and alcohol.\r\n\r\nYeast may be either \"wild\" or cultivated. If the mash is left to stand\r\nunder proper condition the wild yeast spores in the air, will soon settle\r\nin the mash and begin to multiply. This method of fermentation is bad\r\nbecause other organisms than yeast will also be developed,--organisms\r\nantagonistic to proper fermentation. As a consequence, pure or cultivated\r\nyeast is alone used.\r\n\r\nThis yeast is cultivated from a mother bed in a special yeast mash and\r\nwhen ripened is mixed with the mash in the fermenting vat. At a\r\ntemperature between 50∞ F. and 86∞ F. the yeast induces fermentation,\r\nconverting the sugar of the mash into carbon dioxid which escapes, and\r\nalcohol which remains in the decomposed mash, or \"beer\" as it is termed\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to separate the alcohol from the water of the beer with\r\nwhich it is mixed. This is accomplished by distillation and\r\nrectification, as will be fully described in the chapters following.\r\n\r\n\r\n         PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL FROM SACCHARIFEROUS SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nSubstances such as grape juice, fruit juice, sugar beets, cane sugar and\r\nmolasses already contain fermentable sugar. Saccharification is therefore\r\nnot needed and juices or liquids from these matters are either directly\r\nfermented as in the case of sugar cane, or--as in the case of sugar\r\nbeets--the sugar in juice is transferred by yeast into a fermentable\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MASHING STARCHY MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider in more detail the preparation of mashes from\r\nstarch-containing substances.\r\n\r\n=Gelatinizing Apparatus.= These comprise either ordinary vats, into which\r\nsteam at low pressure is admitted (see Fig. 44), cookers and stirrers\r\nsuch as shown in Fig. 1 and 45 or the Henze steamer (Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Vacuum Mash Cooker. (_To face page 10_)]\r\n\r\nAn example of a cooking and mashing apparatus and its connections is\r\nshown in Fig. 1. This is the vacuum cooker put on the market by the\r\nVulcan Copper Works Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio. This consists of a\r\ncylindrical steel vessel the interior of which is fitted with stirrer\r\narms attached to a shaft making about sixty revolutions per minute. The\r\nsteam enters the vessel at the bottom by means of pipes conducting it\r\nfrom a manifold, or header, in the same manner as is shown in the\r\napparatus illustrated in Fig. 45. Attached to each pipe at its point of\r\nentrance is a check valve to spray the steam through the mash. A\r\nthermometer for registering the temperature and a water gauge are placed\r\nin the manifold. The grain enters the cooker from the grain hopper by way\r\nof a spout. The cylinder has been previously supplied with hot water and\r\nduring the mixing of the meal with the hot water the mass is constantly\r\nstirred. The malt is mixed with water in the small grain tub which is\r\nprovided with a stirrer. The malt mash is admitted into the cooker and\r\nthe mass thoroughly mixed by the arms. After the mashing, the product\r\npasses off to the drop tub and from thence to the mash coolers where it\r\nis cooled to the proper temperature for fermentation. The gearing for\r\nagitating the malt mash and the grain or potato mash is evident from the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe pressure steamers used in mashing are shown in Fig. 2. They comprise\r\na cylindrical vessel preferably conical or partly conical, provided with\r\nsteam entrance pipes, air valves and a manhole. At the bottom of the cone\r\nforming the lower end of the steamer is a grating located in an exit\r\npipe provided with a valve. One of the steam entrance pipes is so located\r\nthat the steam is forced in at the top of the cylinder while the other\r\nallows steam to enter at the bottom of the cylinder. The device is\r\nprovided with a pressure gauge and an air cock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Henze Steamer.]\r\n\r\nIn use the body of the apparatus is partly filled with water and the\r\nmaterial to be treated. This is acted upon by a steam pressure of two\r\natmospheres, which is later increased to three, steam entering by the\r\nlowermost pipe, passing up through the water and potatoes thoroughly\r\nagitating the same and passing away by the steam gauge. After standing at\r\nthe last pressure for ten or fifteen minutes the lower steam inlet is\r\nclosed; the upper inlet and the blow-out valve are opened. The steam is\r\nthen increased to its highest point or about four atmospheres and the\r\nlower valve is opened. The disintegrated material is forced out by the\r\nsteam through the grating at the bottom of the cone. This comminutes it\r\nand pulps it before it passes into the preparatory mash tub. Blowing out\r\nrequires about 40 to 50 minutes. Steaming and blowing out together cover\r\na space of two hours. The pressure of the steam before blowing out should\r\nbe such that the steam is constantly being blown off through the safety\r\nvalve. Thus the mass in the steamer is agitated and the material entirely\r\ndisintegrated and gelatinized.\r\n\r\n=Process.= Into these apparatuses the potatoes and corn or grain first\r\nground into mash, or even corn or grain unground, if the pressure is high\r\nenough, are disintegrated and cooked by steam under high pressure. During\r\nthis process the starch becomes partially dissolved and partially\r\ngelatinized, which occurs when a pressure of some 65 pounds has been\r\nattained, with a temperature of about 300∞ F.\r\n\r\n=Saccharifying.= It is now necessary to saccharify the gelatinized mass.\r\nThis is accomplished by adding to it a certain amount of malt, whereby\r\nmaltose or sugar is formed through the action of the diastase. The amount\r\nof maltose so created is in proportion to the amount of malt used, the\r\nlength of time it is acting, the dilution of the mash, and the existence\r\nof a proper temperature. The temperature best fitted for this action lies\r\nabove 122∞ F., but in order to entirely dissolve the starch a temperature\r\nof 145∞ F. should be used. In addition, at this higher temperature, the\r\nbacteria inimical to fermentation are destroyed. A higher temperature\r\nthan 145∞ F. should not be allowed, except in extraordinary cases as it\r\ninjures the effectiveness of the diastase.\r\n\r\n=Apparatus.= The mixture of the malt with the mash may either take place\r\nin the heater and cooker itself (see Fig. 2) or in a preparatory mash\r\nvat.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the malt is allowed to enter the cooking cylinder\r\nwhen the temperature of the mash is about 145∞ F. The mash is stirred\r\nuntil thoroughly mixed when the product is drawn into a receptacle called\r\na drop tub and later reduced to a proper fermenting temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen the Henze type of steamer is used, the pulped mass (see Page 121) is\r\nblown into a preparatory mash vat, at the proper temperature. It is left\r\nto stand at this temperature for a period varying from twenty minutes to\r\nan hour and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooling the Mash.= Saccharification takes place at a temperature above\r\n122∞ F., but the proper fermenting temperature is only about 63∞ F. to\r\n68∞ F., and hence some means must be adopted for cooling the hot mash to\r\nthis temperature and for so cooling it in a relatively short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Mash Cooler, Air System.]\r\n\r\n=Cooling= may be accomplished by submitting the mash to currents of air;\r\nto contact with cold water coils or by the use of ice. One of the\r\nsimplest coolers of the first class is shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a shallow panlike tank A having means for introducing\r\nand drawing off the mash. Rotating in the center of the tank is a\r\nvertical shaft _C_ carrying radiating stirrer arms _B_. Braces _M_\r\nextend to the middle of these arms and the arms carry a number of blades\r\nor paddles _b_, which extend down into the mash. Above the arms, mounted\r\nloosely on the same shaft, but rotating in the opposite direction, are\r\nfans _H_ supported by arms _J_ which create air currents over the\r\nagitated mash. These fans move at a much faster rate than the stirrers\r\n_B_.\r\n\r\nA simple form of driving gear is shown. The main shaft _C_ is rotated by\r\na large bevel gear _D_, meshing with a small pinion _E_ on the end of a\r\ndriving shaft _F_, which is driven by a belt. This shaft also carries a\r\nbevel gear _L_, which meshes with a bevel gear _K_ mounted on a sleeve.\r\nThis sleeve surrounds and rotates freely on the central shaft _C_, being\r\nsupported at its lower end in ball bearings _m m_, mounted on the shaft.\r\nThis combination gives opposite rotation to the faces and stirrer arms\r\nand at different speeds. The driving mechanism can be of course varied.\r\n\r\nAnother simple method of air cooling would be to let the mash run down a\r\nseries of enclosed steps or chutes, the casing being kept cool by an air\r\nblast. Mashes may be even cooled by mere stirring by paddles, but this\r\ntakes a long time and much labor.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory mash vats used to-day are almost all provided with\r\nstirrers formed of hollow blades capable of a rapid stirring movement\r\nthrough the mash. Through the hollow blades cold water is forced. Mash\r\nvats of this kind should have the following qualities. They should be\r\nstrongly built, particularly as regards the stirrers so as to be used\r\nwith thick mashes. They should thoroughly and uniformly stir and mix the\r\nmash and they should be capable of cooling the mash within an hour, and\r\nshould be so constructed as to be easily cleaned.\r\n\r\nBy using coils of pipe which may be inserted or withdrawn from the mash\r\ntub, and through which cold water is forced, the mash may be effectively\r\ncooled, but the best plan for quick cooling is to bring a comparatively\r\nthin layer of the mash in contact with the coils. This may be\r\nconveniently done by using a system of comparatively large water pipes\r\nenclosing small pipes for the passage of the mash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Mash Cooler, Water System.]\r\n\r\nThis should be arranged in a stand like the coils of a radiator with an\r\nincline from the inlet end of the top pipe to the outlet end of the\r\nlowermost pipe. As stated, the small pipe carries the mash, the large\r\npipe the water.\r\n\r\nPreferably the mash flows downward while the water is forced upward in a\r\ncontrary direction by means of a pump or a high level reservoir. The\r\ncooled mash should flow into the fermenting tank at a temperature of\r\nabout 68∞ F.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of mash cooling apparatuses on the market of\r\nmore or less complication suited to the needs of large and expensive\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe form of cooler best to be used depends upon the circumstances of each\r\ncase and whether thick or thin mashes are to be distilled. The cooler\r\nshould, however, be capable of thorough cleansing so that no portion of\r\none mashing be carried to another.\r\n\r\n=Fermentation= is an obscure and seemingly spontaneous change or\r\ndecomposition which takes place in most vegetable and animal substances\r\nwhen exposed at ordinary temperatures to air and moisture. While\r\nfermentation broadly covers decay or putrifaction, yet it is limited in\r\nordinary use to the process for producing alcoholic liquors from\r\nsacchariferous mashes.\r\n\r\nFermentation is brought about by certain bodies called ferments--these\r\nare either organized, as vegetable ferments such as yeast, or unorganized\r\nas diastase--the enzyme of germinated malt. The last is used to convert\r\nstarch into maltose, the first is used to convert maltose into\r\nfermentable sugar. The organized ferments are either to be found floating\r\nfreely in the air under the name of wild yeast or are artificially\r\nproduced. If a solution of pure sugar be allowed to stand so that it can\r\nbe acted on by the organisms in the air, it will remain unaltered for a\r\nlong time, but finally mold will appear upon it and it will become sour\r\nand dark-colored. If, however, a suitable ferment is added to it, such as\r\nyeast, it rapidly passes into a state of active fermentation by which the\r\nsugar is split up into alcohol and carbon dioxid, the process continuing\r\nfrom 48 hours to several weeks according to the temperature, the amount\r\nof sugar present, and the nature and quantity of the ferment.\r\nFermentation cannot occur at a temperature much below 40∞ F., nor above\r\n140∞ F. The limits of practical temperature, however, are 41∞ to 86∞ F.\r\nBrewer's yeast is chiefly employed in spirit manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe most striking phenomena of fermentation are the turbidity of the\r\nliquid, the rising of gas bubbles to the surface, and the increase in\r\ntemperature, the disappearance of the sugar, the appearance of alcohol\r\nand the clearing of the liquid. At the end a slight scum is formed on the\r\ntop of the liquid and a light colored deposit at the bottom. This deposit\r\nconsists of yeast which is capable of exciting the vinous fermentation in\r\nother solutions of sugar. The lower the temperature the slower the\r\nprocess, while at a temperature above 86∞ F. the vinous fermentation is\r\nliable to pass into other forms of fermentation to be hereafter\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThere are many theories of fermentation, of which the two most important\r\nare those of Pasteur and Buchner. The first teaches that fermentation is\r\ncaused purely by the organic life of the yeast plant and is not a mere\r\nchemical action, whereas the second view most largely held to-day is that\r\nfermentation is a purely chemical change due to certain unorganized\r\nsubstances called \"enzymes\" present in the yeast.\r\n\r\nThe theory need not detain us. It is sufficient that the yeast plant in\r\nsome manner acts to decompose the saccharified mash into alcohol and\r\ncarbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n=Yeast= is a fungus, a mono-cellular organism, which under proper\r\nconditions propogates itself to an enormous extent. There are many races\r\nor varieties of yeast each having its peculiar method of growth.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes we may divide the yeast races into two classes, wild\r\nyeast and cultivated yeast. Originally any of the yeast races were\r\nsupposed to be good enough to effect fermentation but to-day every effort\r\nis made to procure and use only those races which have the greatest power\r\nto decompose sugar. It was for this reason that the old distiller kept\r\nportions of his yeast over from one fermentation to the next. This was\r\nyeast whose action they understood and whose abilities were proven. This\r\nyeast so kept was open, however, to the chance of contamination and yeast\r\nto-day is as carefully selected and bred as is a strain of horses, or\r\ndogs, or plants.\r\n\r\nAfter getting a portion of selected pure yeast for breeding purposes, it\r\nmay be sowed, that is, propagated very carefully in a yeast mash, in\r\nsterilizing apparatus, where all chance of contamination by bacteria or\r\nwild yeast is avoided. From this bed of mother yeast, or start yeast, the\r\nyeast for the successive yeast mashes is taken.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the various varieties of yeast mashes is too lengthy\r\nto be set forth except in special treatises on the subject, but the\r\nordinary method of yeasting is as follows, reference being made to Fig.\r\n5, which shows the apparatus used in the yeasting and fermenting\r\ndepartments of a distillery, as installed by the Vulcan Copper Works, of\r\nCincinnati. The yeast tubs are shown to the left of the illustration.\r\nThey are each provided with cooling coils and stirrers.\r\n\r\nThe yeast mash we will assume is composed of equal parts of barley malt\r\nand rye meal. Hot water at 166∞ F. is first put into the mash tub. The\r\nrake or stirrers are then rotated and the meal run in slowly. The\r\nstirring is continued for twenty minutes after the meal is all in, during\r\nwhich the mash has become saccharified.\r\n\r\nThe mash is then allowed to stand for about twenty hours, and to grow\r\nsour by lactic fermentation. The lactic acid so produced protects the\r\nmother yeast from infection by suppressing wild yeast and bacteria.\r\nDuring this period great care is taken to prevent the temperature of the\r\nmash falling below 95∞ F. and consequent butyric and acetous fermentation\r\nfollowing. After it has so stood the sour mash is cooled by circulating\r\nwater in the coils and stirring until it is reduced to from 59∞ to 68∞ F.\r\ndepending on whether the mash is thin or thick. Start yeast during the\r\ncooling of the mash when at above 86∞ F. is added and stirred in. For the\r\nnext twelve hours the yeast ferments and when a temperature of 84∞ F. has\r\nbeen attained the mash is cooled to 65∞ F. at which temperature it is\r\nmaintained until allowed to enter the fermenting tubs through the pipe\r\nleading thereto from the yeast tub.\r\n\r\nThere are four principal kinds of fermentation: alcoholic, acetous,\r\nlactic and viscous.\r\n\r\n=Alcoholic Fermentation.= This may be briefly described as follows: The\r\nmash in the fermenting vat having been brought to the proper temperature,\r\nthe ferment is thrown in, and the whole is well stirred together.\r\n\r\nThis is known as pitching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Yeasting and Fermenting Apparatus.\r\n(_To face page 22_)]\r\n\r\nThe proper pitching temperature varies with the method of fermentation\r\nadopted, the length of the fermenting period, the materials of the mash,\r\nits thickness or attenuation. It must always be remembered that there is\r\na great increase in the temperature of the \"beer\" during fermentation and\r\nthat the temperature at its highest should never under any circumstances,\r\nbecome greater than 86∞ F. and with thick mashes that even a less heat is\r\ndesirable. Therefore the pitching temperature should be such that the\r\ninevitable rise due to fermentation shall not carry the temperature to or\r\nbeyond the maximum point desired for the particular mash being\r\ntreated. It is to accurately control the pitching temperature and the\r\nfermenting temperature that the fermenting tanks are provided with\r\ncooling appliances.\r\n\r\nIn about three hours' time, the commencement of the fermentation is\r\nannounced by small bubbles of gas which appear on the surface of the vat,\r\nand collect around the edges. As these increase in number, the whole\r\ncontents are gradually thrown into a state of motion, resembling violent\r\nebullition, by the tumultuous disengagement of carbonic anhydride. The\r\nliquor rises in temperature and becomes covered with froth. At this\r\npoint, the vat must be covered tightly, the excess of gas finding an exit\r\nthrough holes in the lid; care must now be taken to prevent the\r\ntemperature from rising too high, and also to prevent the action from\r\nbecoming too energetic, thereby causing the contents of the vat to\r\noverflow. In about twenty-four hours the action begins to subside, and\r\nthe temperature falls to that of the surrounding atmosphere. An hour or\r\ntwo later, the process is complete; the bubbles disappear, and the\r\nliquor, which now possesses the characteristic odor and taste of alcohol,\r\nsettles out perfectly clear. The whole operation, as here described,\r\nusually occupies from forty-eight to seventy-two hours. The duration of\r\nthe process is influenced, of course, by many circumstances, chiefly by\r\nbulk of the liquor, its richness in sugar, the quality of the ferment,\r\nand the temperature.\r\n\r\n=Acetous Fermentation.= This perplexing occurrence cannot be too\r\ncarefully guarded against. It results when the fermenting liquor is\r\nexposed to the air. When this is the case, the liquor absorbs a portion\r\nof the oxygen, which unites with the alcohol, thus converting it into\r\nacetic acid as rapidly as it is formed. When acetous fermentation begins,\r\nthe liquor becomes turbid, and a long, stringy substance appears, which\r\nafter a time settles down to the bottom of the vat. It is then found that\r\nall the alcohol has been decomposed, and that an equivalent quantity of\r\nacetous acid remains instead. It has been discovered that the presence of\r\na ferment and a temperature of 68∞ to 95∞ F. are indispensable to acetous\r\nfermentation, as well as contact with the atmosphere. Hence, in order to\r\nprevent its occurrence, it is necessary not only to exclude the air, but\r\nalso to guard against too high a temperature and the use of too much\r\nferment. The latter invariably tends to excite acetous fermentation. It\r\nshould also be remarked that it is well to cleanse the vats and utensils\r\ncarefully with lime water before using, in order to neutralize any acid\r\nwhich they may contain; for the least trace of acid in the vat has a\r\ntendency to accelerate the conversion of alcohol into vinegar. A variety\r\nof other circumstances are favorable to acetification, such as the use of\r\na stagnant or impure water, and the foul odors which arise from the vats;\r\nstormy weather or thunder will also engender it.\r\n\r\n=Lactic Fermentation.= Under the influence of lactic fermentation, sugar\r\nand starch are converted into lactic acid. When it has once begun, it\r\ndevelops rapidly, and soon decomposes a large quantity of glucose; but as\r\nit can proceed only in a neutral liquor, the presence of the acid itself\r\nspeedily checks its own formation. Then, however, another ferment is\r\nliable to act upon the lactic acid already formed, converting it into\r\n_butyric acid_, which is easily recognized by its odor of rank butter.\r\nCarbonic anhydride and hydrogen are evolved by this reaction. The latter\r\ngas acts powerfully upon glucose, converting it into a species of gum\r\ncalled _mannite_, so that lactic fermentation--in itself an intolerable\r\nnuisance--becomes the source of a new and equally objectionable waste of\r\nsugar. It can be avoided only by keeping the vats thoroughly clean; they\r\nshould be washed with water acidulated with five per cent of sulphuric\r\nacid. An altered ferment, or the use of too small a quantity, will tend\r\nto bring it about.\r\n\r\nThe best preventives are _thorough cleanliness_, and the use of good,\r\nfresh yeast in the correct proportion.\r\n\r\n=Viscous Fermentation.= This is usually the result of allowing the vats\r\nto stand too long before fermentation begins. It is characterized by the\r\nformation of viscous or mucilaginous matters, which render the liquor\r\nturbid, and by the evolution of carbonic anhydride and hydrogen gases the\r\nlatter acting as in the case of lactic fermentation and converting the\r\nglucose into mannite. Viscous fermentation may generally be attributed to\r\nthe too feeble action of the ferment. It occurs principally in the\r\nfermentation of white wines, beer, and beet-juice, or of other liquors\r\ncontaining much nitrogenous matter. It may be avoided by the same\r\nprecautions as are indicated for the prevention of lactic fermentation.\r\n\r\n=Periods of Fermentation.= The operation of fermentation may be\r\nconveniently divided into three equal periods.\r\n\r\nThe first or pre-fermentation period is that when the yeast mixed into\r\nthe mash is growing; the temperature should then be kept at about 63 to\r\n68∞ F. during which time the yeast is propagated. The growth of the yeast\r\nis manifested by the development of carbonic acid gas and by a slight\r\nmotion of the mash. When alcohol is produced to an extent of say five per\r\ncent. the growth of the yeast stops.\r\n\r\nThe second period of chief fermentation then begins. Carbonic acid is\r\nfreely developed and the sugar is converted into alcohol. The temperature\r\nat this time should not exceed 81.5∞ F. The second period of fermentation\r\ncontinues about 12 hours, when the last period commences.\r\n\r\nDuring the third period or after fermentation there is a lessening of the\r\nformation of carbonic acid and a lowering of the temperature. In this\r\nstage the mash is kept at a temperature of 77∞ to 81∞ F.\r\n\r\nIn order to conveniently regulate the temperature of the mash the vat may\r\nbe provided with a copper worm at the bottom thereof, through which cold\r\nwater is forced. This, however, need only be used for thick mashes. There\r\nare also various kinds of movable coolers used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different forms which fermentation may take. The\r\ninsoluble constituents of the mash in the process of fermentation are\r\nforced to the surface, and form what may be termed a cover. If the\r\ncarbonic acid gas bubbles seldom break this cover it indicates that the\r\nconversion of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid is proceeding very\r\nslowly and imperfectly. If, however, the cover is swirling and seething,\r\nand particularly if the cover is rising and falling with every now and\r\nthen a discharge of gas, it is an indication that the conversion is\r\nproperly proceeding. Foaming of the mash is to be prevented, as the froth\r\nor foam flows over the mash tank and considerable loss is sustained. It\r\nmay be prevented by pouring a little hot lard into the vat, or petroleum,\r\nprovided its odor will not interfere with the use of the alcohol when\r\ndistilled.\r\n\r\nWater is added in small quantities near the termination of the second\r\nperiod of fermentation. This dilutes the alcohol, in the mash and lessens\r\nits percentage, and thus the further growth of the yeast is permitted.\r\n\r\nAfter fermentation the mash takes either the form of a thick diluted pulp\r\nor of a thin liquor. Again the reader is reminded that the mash after\r\nfermentation contains alcohol mixed with water--and that the next step in\r\nthe process--distillation is necessary merely to separate the alcohol\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\nThere is always some loss in the process of fermentation; in other words,\r\nthe actual production is below the theoretical amount due. Theoretically\r\none pound of starch should yield 11.45 fluid ounces of alcohol. With a\r\ngood result 88.3 per cent. of this theoretical yield is obtained; with an\r\naverage result of 80.2 per cent. and with a bad result only about 72.6\r\nper cent. or less.\r\n\r\n=Fermenting Apparatus.= It remains now to describe briefly the vessels or\r\nvats employed in the processes of fermentation. They are made of oak or\r\ncypress, firmly bound together with iron bands, and they should be\r\nsomewhat deeper than wide, and slightly conical, so as to present as\r\nsmall a surface as possible to the action of the air. Their dimensions\r\nvary, of course, with the nature and quantity of the liquor to be\r\nfermented. Circular vats are preferable to square ones, as being better\r\nadapted to retain the heat of their contents. The lid should close\r\nsecurely, and a portion of it should be made to open without uncovering\r\nthe whole. For the purpose of heating or cooling the contents when\r\nnecessary, it is of great advantage to have a copper coil at the bottom\r\nof the vat, connected with two pipes, one supplying steam and the other\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\n=Iron vats= have also been used, having a jacketed space around them,\r\ninto which hot or cold water may be introduced. As wooden vats are porous\r\nand hence uncleanly they have to be constantly scrubbed and disinfected.\r\nIt is advisable to cover the interior with linseed oil, varnish or with a\r\nshellac varnish. The diameter of the coil varies according to the size of\r\nthe vat.\r\n\r\n=The room= in which the vats are placed should be made as free from\r\ndraughts as possible by dispensing with superfluous doors and windows; it\r\nshould not be too high and should be enclosed by thick walls in order to\r\nkeep in the heat. As uniformity of temperature is highly desirable, a\r\nthermometer should be kept in the room, and there should be stoves for\r\nsupplying heat in case it be required. The temperature should be kept\r\nbetween 64∞ F. and 68∞ F.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution must be taken to ensure the most absolute cleanliness;\r\nthe floors should be swept or washed with water daily, and the vats, as\r\npointed out above, must be cleaned out as soon as the contents are\r\nremoved. For washing the vats, lime-water should be used when the\r\nfermentation has been too energetic or has shown a tendency to become\r\nacid; water acidulated with sulphuric acid is used when the action has\r\nbeen feeble and the fermented liquor contains a small quantity of\r\nundecomposed sugar. Care must be taken to get rid of carbonic anhydride\r\nformed during the operation. Buckets of lime-water are sometimes placed\r\nabout the room for the purpose of absorbing this gas; but the best way of\r\ngetting rid of it is to have a number of holes, three or four inches\r\nsquare, in the floor, through which the gas escapes by reason of its\r\nweight. The dangerous action of this gas and its effects upon animal life\r\nwhen unmixed with air are too well know to necessitate any further\r\nenforcement of these precautions.\r\n\r\n=The beer= obtained by mashing and fermenting consist essentially of\r\nvolatile substances, such as water, alcohol, essential oils and a little\r\nacetic acid, and of non-volatile substances, such as cellulose, dextrine,\r\nunaltered sugar and starch, mineral matters, lactic acid, etc.\r\n\r\n=The volatile constituents= of the liquor possess widely different\r\ndegrees of volatility; the alcohol has the lowest boiling point, water\r\nthe next, then acetic acid, and last the essential oils. It will thus be\r\nseen that the separation of the volatile and non-volatile constituents by\r\nevaporation and condensation of the vapors given off is very easily\r\neffected, and that also by the same process, which is termed\r\n_distillation_, the volatile substances may be separated from one\r\nanother. As the acetic acid and essential oils are present only in very\r\nsmall quantities, they will not require much consideration.\r\n\r\nThe aim of distillation is to separate as completely as possible the\r\nalcohol from the water which dilutes it. Table I shows the amount of\r\nalcohol contained in the vapors given off from alcoholic liquids of\r\ndifferent strength, and also their boiling points.\r\n\r\nA glance at this table shows to what an extent an alcoholic liquor may be\r\nstrengthened by distillation, and how the quantity of spirit in the\r\ndistillate increases in proportion as that contained in the original\r\nliquor diminishes. It will also be seen that successive distillations of\r\nspirituous liquors will ultimately yield a spirit of very high strength.\r\n\r\nAs an example, suppose that a liquid containing five per cent, of alcohol\r\nis to be distilled. Its vapor condensed gives a distillate containing 42\r\nper cent. of alcohol which, if re-distilled, affords another containing\r\n82 per cent. This, subjected again to distillation, yields alcohol of\r\nover 90 per cent. in strength. Thus three successive distillations have\r\nstrengthened the liquor from five per cent. to 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be clear that the richness in alcohol of the vapors given\r\noff from boiling alcoholic liquids is not a constant quantity, but that\r\nit necessarily diminishes as the ebullition is continued. For example a\r\nliquor containing seven per cent. of alcohol yields, on boiling a vapor\r\ncontaining 50 per cent. The first portion of the distillate will,\r\ntherefore, be of this strength. But as the vapor is proportionally richer\r\nin alcohol, the boiling liquor must become gradually weaker, and, in\r\nconsequence, must yield weaker vapors. Thus, when the proportion of\r\nalcohol in the boiling liquid has sunk to five per cent., the vapors\r\ncondensed at that time will contain only 40 per cent.; at two per cent.\r\nof alcohol in the liquor, the vapors yield only 28 per cent., and at one\r\nper cent., they will be found when condensed to contain only 13 per cent.\r\nFrom this it will be understood that if the distillation be stopped at\r\nany given point before the complete volatilization of all the alcohol the\r\ndistillate obtained will be considerably stronger than if the process had\r\nbeen carried on to the end. Moreover, another advantage derived from\r\nchecking the process before the end, and keeping the last portions of the\r\ndistillate separate from the rest, besides that of obtaining a stronger\r\nspirit, is that a much purer one is obtained also. The volatile,\r\nessential oils, mentioned above, are soluble only in strong alcohol, and\r\ninsoluble in its aqueous solutions. They distill also at a much higher\r\ntemperature than alcohol, and so are found only among the last products\r\nof the distillation, which results from raising the temperature of the\r\nboiling liquid. This system of checking the distillation and removing the\r\nproducts at different points is frequently employed in the practice of\r\nrectification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                         DISTILLING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Apparatus= employed in the process of distillation is called a\r\n_still_, and is of almost infinite variety. A still may be any vessel\r\nwhich will hold and permit fermentated \"wash\" or \"beer\" to be boiled\r\ntherein, and which will collect the vapors arising from the surface of\r\nthe boiling liquid and transmit them to a condenser. The still may be\r\neither heated by the direct application of fire, or the liquid in the\r\nstill raised to the boiling point by the injection of steam. The steam or\r\nvapor rising from the boiling liquid must be cooled and condensed. This\r\nis done by leading it into tubes surrounded by cold water or the \"cold\r\nmash.\"\r\n\r\nThe very simplest form of still is shown in Fig. 6, and consists of two\r\nessential parts, the still, or boiler _A_, made of tinned copper, the\r\ncondenser _C_ which may be made of metal or wood and the worm _B_ made of\r\na coil of tinned copper pipe.\r\n\r\nThe liquor is boiled in _A_ and the vapors pass off into the worm _B_,\r\nwhich is surrounded by the cold water of the condenser, the distillate\r\nbeing drawn off at _f_.\r\n\r\nThe heated vapors passing through the worm _B_ will soon heat up the\r\nwater in _C_ thereby retarding perfect condensation. To prevent this, a\r\ncold water supply pipe may be connected to the bottom of _C_ making a\r\nconnection at the top of _C_ for an over flow of the warmed up water. By\r\nthis means the lowest part of the worm will be kept sufficiently cool to\r\nmake a rapid condensation of the vapors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--A Simple Still.]\r\n\r\nThe boiler _A_ can be made in two parts; the upper part fitting into the\r\nlower part snugly at _d_. The pipe from the upper part fitting the worm\r\nsnugly at _e_. This will enable the operator to thoroughly cleanse the\r\nboiler before putting in a new lot of liquor. The joints at _e_ and _d_\r\nshould be luted with dough formed by mixing the flour with a small\r\nportion of salt and moistening with water. This is thoroughly packed at\r\nthe junctions of the parts to prevent the escape of steam or vapor.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 shows such a Still as manufactured by the Geo. L. Squier Mfg. Co.,\r\nBuffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Simple Direct-Heated Still.]\r\n\r\nIn an apparatus of this kind, the vapors of alcohol and water are\r\ncondensed together. But if instead of filling the condenser _C_ with cold\r\nwater, it is kept at a temperature of 176∞ F. the greater part of the\r\nwater-vapor will be condensed while the alcohol, which boils at 172.4∞ F.\r\npasses through the coil uncondensed. If therefore the water be condensed\r\nand collected separately in this manner, and the alcoholic vapors be\r\nconducted into another cooler kept at temperature below 172.4∞ F., the\r\nalcohol will be obtained in a much higher state of concentration than it\r\nwould be by a process of simple distillation.\r\n\r\nSupposing, again, that vapors containing but a small quantity of alcohol\r\nare brought into contact with an alcoholic liquid of lower temperature\r\nthan the vapors themselves, and in very small quantity, the vapor of\r\nwater will be partly condensed, so that the remainder will be richer in\r\nalcohol than it was previously. But the water, in condensing, converts\r\ninto vapor a portion of the spirit contained in the liquid interposed, so\r\nthat the uncondensed vapors passing away are still further enriched by\r\nthis means. Here, then, are the results obtained; the alcoholic vapors\r\nare strengthened, firstly, by the removal of a portion of the water\r\nwherewith they were mixed; and then by the admixture with them of the\r\nvaporized spirit placed in the condenser. By the employment of some such\r\nmethod as this, a very satisfactory yield of spirit may be obtained, both\r\nwith regard to quality, as it is extremely concentrated, and to the cost\r\nof production, since the simple condensation of the water is made use of\r\nto convert the spirit into vapor without the necessity of having recourse\r\nto fuel. The construction of every variety of distilling apparatus now in\r\nuse is based upon the above principles.\r\n\r\nA sectional view of another simple form of still is shown in Fig. 8; _V_\r\nis a wooden vat having a tight fitting cover _a_, through the center of\r\nwhich a hole has been cut. The wide end of a goose neck of copper pipe\r\n_g_ is securely fitted over this aperture, the smaller end of this pipe\r\npasses through the cover of the retort _R_ extending nearly to the\r\nbottom; _f_ is the steam supply pipe from boiler; _M_ the rectifier\r\nconsisting of a cylindrical copper vessel containing a number of small\r\nvertical pipes surrounded by a cold water jacket; _o_ the inlet for the\r\ncold water which circulates around these small pipes, discharging at _n_;\r\nthe pipes in _M_ have a common connection to a pipe _p_, which connects\r\nthe rectifier with coil in cooler _C_; _s_ is a pipe to the receptacle\r\nfor receiving the distillate; _u_ cold water supply pipe to cooler, and\r\n_W_ discharge for warmed-up water, _k_ discharge for refuse wash in vat\r\n_V_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Simple Still, with Rectifier.]\r\n\r\nThe operation is as follows: The vat _V_ is nearly filled with fermented\r\nmash and retort _R_ with weak distillate from a previous operation. Steam\r\nis then turned into the pipe _f_ discharging near the bottom of the vat\r\n_V_ and working up through the mash. This heats up the mash and the\r\nvapors escape up _g_ over into _R_ where they warm up the weak\r\ndistillate. The vapors thus enriched rise into _M_, where a good\r\npercentage of the water vapor is distilled, that is, condensed by the\r\ncold water surrounding the small pipes. The vapor then passes over\r\nthrough _p_ into the coil, where it is liquified and from whence it\r\npasses by pipe _s_ into the receiver. The cold water for cooling both _M_\r\nand _C_ can be turned on as soon as the apparatus has become thoroughly\r\nheated up.\r\n\r\nThe stills in use to-day in many parts of the South for the production of\r\nwhiskey are quite as simple as those above described, and some for the\r\nmaking of \"moonshine\" liquor are more so.\r\n\r\nThe first distilling apparatus for the production of strong alcohol on an\r\nindustrial scale was invented by Edward Adam, in the year 1801. The\r\narrangement is shown in Fig. 9, in which _A_ is a still to contain the\r\nliquor placed over a suitable heater. The vapors were conducted by a tube\r\ninto the egg-shaped vessel _B_, the tube reaching nearly to the bottom;\r\nthey then passed out by another tube into a second egg _C_; then, in some\r\ncases, into a third, not shown in the figure, and finally into the worm\r\n_D_, and through a cock at _G_ into the receiver. The liquor condensed in\r\nthe first egg is stronger than that in the still, while that found in the\r\nsecond and third is stronger than either. The spirit which is condensed\r\nat the bottom of the worm is of a very high degree of strength. At the\r\nbottom of each of the eggs, there is a tube connected with the still, by\r\nwhich the concentrated liquors may be run back into _A_ for\r\nredistillation after the refuse liquor from the first distill has been\r\nrun off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Adam's Still.]\r\n\r\nIn the tube is a stop-cock _a_, by regulating which, enough liquor could\r\nbe kept in the eggs to cover the lower ends of the entrance pipes, so\r\nthat the alcoholic vapors were not only deprived of water by the cooling\r\nwhich they underwent in passing through the eggs, but were also mixed\r\nwith fresh spirit obtained from the vaporization of the liquid remaining\r\nin the bottom of the eggs, in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nAdam's arrangement fulfilled, therefore, the two conditions necessary for\r\nthe production of strong spirit inexpensively; but unfortunately it had\r\nalso serious defects. The temperature of the egg could not be maintained\r\nat a constant standard, and the bubbling of the vapors through the liquor\r\ninside created too high a pressure. It was, however, a source of great\r\nprofit to its inventor for a long period, although it gave rise to many\r\nimitations and improvements.\r\n\r\nThe operation of distilling is often carried on in the apparatus\r\nrepresented in Fig. 22. It is termed the Patent Simplified Distilling\r\nApparatus; it was originally invented by Corty, but it has since\r\nundergone much improvement. _A_ is the body of the still, into which the\r\nwash is put; _B_ the head of the still; _c c c_ three copper plates\r\nfitted in the upper part of the three boxes; these are kept cool by a\r\nsupply of water from the pipe _E_, which is distributed on the top of the\r\nboxes by means of the pipes _G G G_. The least pure portion of the\r\nascending vapors is condensed as it reaches the lowest plate, and falls\r\nback, and the next portion as it reaches the second plate, while the\r\npurest and lightest vapors pass over the goose-neck, and are condensed in\r\nthe worm. The temperature of the plates is regulated by altering the flow\r\nof water by means of the cock _F_. For the purpose of cleaning the\r\napparatus, a jet of steam or water may be introduced at _a_. A regulator\r\nis affixed at the screw-joint _H_, at the lower end of the worm, which\r\naddition is considered an important part of the improvement. The part of\r\nthe apparatus marked _I_ becomes filled soon after the operation has\r\ncommenced; the end of the other pipe _K_ is immersed in water in the\r\nvessel _L_. The advantage claimed for this apparatus is that the\r\ncondensation proceeds in a partial vacuum, and that there is therefore a\r\ngreat saving in fuel. One of these stills, having a capacity of 400\r\ngallons, is said to work off four or five charges during a day of 12\r\nhours, furnishing a spirit 35 per cent. over-proof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Corty's Simplified Distilling Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nFig. 11 represents a double still which was at one time largely employed\r\nin the colonies. It is simply an addition of the common still _A_ to the\r\npatent still _B_. From time to time the contents of _B_ are run off into\r\n_A_, those of _A_ being drawn off as dunder, the spirit from _A_ passing\r\nover into _B_. Both stills are heated by the same fire; and it is said\r\nthat much fine spirit can be obtained by their use at the expense of a\r\nvery inconsiderable amount of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Double Still.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compound Distillation.= Where stills of the form shown in Figs. 6 and 8\r\nare used the alcohol obtained is weak. Hence it is necessary that the\r\ndistillate be again itself distilled, the operation being repeated a\r\nnumber of times. In the better class of still, however, compound\r\ndistillation is performed the mash is heated by the hot vapors rising\r\nfrom the still and the vapors are condensed and run back into the still\r\ngreatly enriched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Dorn's Compound Still.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of compound distillation is well shown in Dorn's apparatus,\r\nFig. 12. This consists of a still or boiler _A_ having a large\r\ndome-shaped head, on the interior faces of which the alcoholic vapors\r\nwill condense. Thus only enriched vapors will pass up through goose-neck\r\n_B_ to the mash heater _D_. _C_ is a worm the end of which passes out to\r\na compartment _E_ through an inclined partition _F_. From the compartment\r\n_E_ a pipe _e_ leads into the still _A_. An agitator _H_ is used for\r\nstirring the mash, so that it may be uniformly heated. A pipe _d_\r\nprovided with a cock allows the mash to be drawn off into the still _A_.\r\nFrom the highest point of the compartment _E_ a pipe _M_ leads to\r\ncondensing coil _K_ in a tub _J_ of cold water, having a draw-off cock\r\n_I_.\r\n\r\nAt the exit end of the condensing worm _K_ the tube is bent in a U form\r\nas at _L_, one arm of which has a curved open-ended continuation _n_,\r\nthrough which the air in the worm is expelled. The other arm opens into\r\nan inverted jar _l_ containing a hydrometer, for indicating the strength\r\nof the spirit. The spirits pass off through _m_ into a receiver.\r\n\r\nIn operation the mash is admitted into the heater _D_ through _G_ until\r\nthe heating tank is nearly filled. A certain amount of mash is then\r\nallowed to run into the still _A_ through the pipe _d_. The cock in _d_\r\nis closed and the fire lighted.\r\n\r\nThe vapors from the still are condensed in worm _C_ and the condensed\r\nliquid drops down into compartment _E_. Any vapor passing through _B_ and\r\n_C_ so highly heated as to be uncondensed in coils _C_ passes through\r\nthe layer of liquid in compartment _E_, collects in the highest portion\r\nof the compartment and passes through pipe _M_ to coil _K_ where it is\r\nentirely liquefied. If the liquid in _E_ rises beyond a certain level it\r\npasses through pipe _e_ back to the still. Any vapors which may collect\r\nin the upper part of _D_ pass into the small bent pipe opening into the\r\nfirst coil of worm _C_. Water for rinsing the heater _D_ may be drawn\r\nthrough cock _s_ from the tub _J_ and warm water for rinsing the still,\r\nthrough pipe _d_ from the heater.\r\n\r\nAnother form of compound still is shown in Fig. 13. In this the still _S_\r\nis divided into an upper and lower compartment by a concavo-convex\r\npartition _d_, having at its crown an upwardly extending tube _t_ from\r\nwhich projects side tubes _p_. A pipe _P_ opens above and extends from\r\ntube _t_. _C_ is the mash heater and condenser. Connected to the head of\r\nthe still is a pipe _T_ through which the vapors pass to a condensing\r\ncoil _f_ formed on the wall of the heater _C_. At its bottom the coil _f_\r\nextends out of the heater, through the water tub _W_ and out to receiver\r\nas at _F_. In the heat of this heater is a valve _V_ whereby any vapors\r\nwhich may arise from the heated mash are conducted by pipe _U_ to _T_.\r\n\r\nThe heater _C_ is filled through funnel _Y_ and the mash is admitted to\r\nthe still through pipe _b_ having cock _a_. The pipe _P_ extends to the\r\nupper part of the water tub _W_ and then downward to the bottom, where it\r\nagain enters the still.\r\n\r\nAn opening in the partition _d_ is controlled by a valve _G_ which allows\r\nliquid in the upper compartment of the still to flow into the lower.\r\nSpent mash may be drawn off through _c_ and the height of the water in\r\ntub _W_ be regulated by pipe _Z_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Compound Still.]\r\n\r\nThe operation of this still is similar to Dorn's still. Mash is put into\r\n_C_ and a quantity of it is let into the upper compartment of the still\r\nand into the lower compartment by valve _G_. This valve is closed and the\r\nfire started. The vapors pass upward through _t_. If they are quite\r\nhighly vaporized they pass onward up _P_, are condensed in their passage\r\nthrough the cool water tub and return as liquid to the upper compartment\r\nwhere they are further heated.\r\n\r\nThe liquid in the upper compartment is thus constantly enriched and the\r\nvapor therefrom passes out through pipe _T_ into condensing coils _f_\r\nwhere it is condensed into spirit and passes off by _F_.\r\n\r\nThe funnel tube _Y_ acts also as a means of warning the attendant as to\r\nthe condition of the mash. If it is too high in level and the pressure of\r\nvapor in the heater _C_ too great, liquid will be forced out of _Y_; if\r\non the contrary, the mash sinks below the level of the pipe then vapor\r\nwill escape and the heater needs refilling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Compound Direct Fire Still.]\r\n\r\nFig. 14 shows a simple form of compound direct fire still as manufactured\r\nby the Geo. L. Squier Mfg. Co., of Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\nCellier-Blumenthal carrying this principle further devised an apparatus\r\nwhich has become the basis of all subsequent improvements; indeed, every\r\nsuccessive invention has differed from this arrangement merely in detail,\r\nthe general principles being in every case the same. The chief defect in\r\nthe simple stills was that they were intermittent that is required the\r\noperations to be suspended when they were recharged, while that of\r\nCellier-Blumenthal is continuous; that is to say, the liquid for\r\ndistillation is introduced at one end of the arrangement, and the\r\nalcoholic products are received continuously, and of a constant degree of\r\nconcentration, at the other. The saving of time and fuel resulting from\r\nthe use of his still is enormous. In the case of the simple stills, the\r\nfuel consumed amounted to a weight nearly three times that of the spirit\r\nyielded by it; whereas, the Cellier-Blumenthal apparatus reduces the\r\namount to one-quarter of the weight of alcohol produced. Fig. 15 shows\r\nthe whole arrangement, and Figs. 16 to 17 represent different parts of it\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Cellier-Blumenthal Still.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 15 _A_ is a boiler, placed over a brick furnace; _B_ is the\r\nstill, placed beside it, on a slightly higher level and heated by the\r\nfurnace flue which passes underneath it. A pipe _e_ conducts the steam\r\nfrom the boiler to the bottom of the still. By another pipe _d_, which is\r\nfurnished with a stop cock and which reaches to the bottom of the still\r\n_A_, the alcoholic liquors in the still may be run from it into the\r\nboiler; by turning the valve the spent liquor may be run out at _a_. The\r\nglass tubes _b_ and _f_ show the height of liquid in the two vessels. _K_\r\nis the valve for filling the boiler and _c_ the safety valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Details of Rectifier Column.]\r\n\r\nThe still is surmounted by a column _C_, shown in section in Fig. 16.\r\nThis column contains an enriching arrangement whereby the liquid flowing\r\ndown into the still _B_ is brought into intimate contact with the steam\r\nrising from the still. The liquid meets with obstacles in falling and\r\nfalls downward in a shower, which thus presents multiplied obstacles to\r\nthe ascent of the vapor. The liquid is thus heated almost to the boiling\r\npoint before it falls into the still _B_. The construction for effecting\r\nthis is shown at _C_, Fig. 16 and consists of an enclosed series of nine\r\nsets of circular copper saucer-shaped capsules, placed one above the\r\nother, and secured to three metallic rods passing through the series so\r\nthat they can be all removed as one piece. These capsules are of\r\ndifferent diameters, the larger ones which are, nearly the diameter of\r\nthe column, are placed with the rounded side downwards, and are pierced\r\nwith small holes; the smaller ones are turned bottom upwards, a stream of\r\nthe liquid to be distilled flows down the pipe _h_ from _E_, into the top\r\ncapsule of _C_ and then percolating through the small holes, falls into\r\nthe smaller capsule beneath, and from the rim of this upon the one next\r\nbelow, and so throughout the whole of the series until it reaches the\r\nbottom and falls into the still _B_. The vapors rise up into the column\r\nfrom the still and meeting the stream of liquid convert it partially into\r\nvapor which passes out at the top of _C_ considerably enriched, into the\r\ncolumn _D_.\r\n\r\nFig. 16 shows a sectional view of the column _D_, the \"rectifying column\"\r\nas it is called. It contains six vessels, placed one above the other, in\r\nan inverted position, so as to form seals. These are so disposed that the\r\nvapors must pass through a thin layer of liquor in each vessel. Some of\r\nthe vapor is thus condensed and the condensed liquid flows back into\r\ncolumn _C_, the uncondensed vapor considerably enriched passing up the\r\npipe _J_, into the coil _S_ in the condenser _E_, Fig. 17, which is\r\nfilled with the \"wash\" to be distilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Details of Condenser and Mash Heater.]\r\n\r\nEntering by the pipe _t_, Fig. 15, the undistilled liquid or \"wash\" is\r\ndistributed over a perforated plate _y y_, and falls in drops into the\r\ncondenser _E_, where it is heated by contact with the coil _S_ containing\r\nthe heated vapors. The condenser is divided into two compartments by a\r\ndiaphragm _X_ which is pierced with holes at its lower extremity;\r\nthrough these holes the wash flows into the second compartment, and\r\npasses out at the top, where it runs through the pipe _h_, into the top\r\nof the column _C_.\r\n\r\nThe vapors are made to traverse the coil _S_, which is kept at an average\r\ntemperature of 122∞ F., in the right hand compartment, and somewhat\r\nhigher in the other. They pass first through _J_ into the hottest part of\r\nthe coil, and there give up much of the water with which they are mixed,\r\nand the process of concentration continues as they pass through the coil.\r\nEach spiral is connected at the bottom with a vertical pipe by which the\r\ncondensed liquors are run off; these are conducted into the retrograding\r\npipe _p p_. Those which are condensed in the hottest part of the coil,\r\nand are consequently the weakest, are led by the pipe _L_ into the third\r\nvessel in the column _D_, Fig. 16, while the stronger or more vaporized\r\nportions pass through _L¥_ into the fifth vessel. Stop-cocks at _m_, _n_,\r\n_o_ regulate the flow of the liquid into these vessels, and consequently\r\nalso the strength of the spirit obtained.\r\n\r\nLastly, as the highly concentrated vapors leave the coil _S_ at _R_, they\r\nare condensed in the vessel _F_, which contains another coil. This is\r\nkept cool by a stream of liquid flowing from the reservoir _H_ into the\r\nsmaller cistern _G_ from which a continuous and regular flow is kept up\r\nthrough the tap _v_ into a funnel _N_ and thence into condenser _F_. It\r\nultimately flows into condenser _E_ through pipe _t_, there being no\r\nother outlet. The finished products run out by pipe _x_ into suitable\r\nreceivers.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the condenser _E_ has two functions. First it\r\ncondenses the alcoholic vapors before transmitting them to the final\r\ncondenser _F_, rejecting and sending back those vapors which are not\r\nhighly enough vaporized. Second it heats the wash intended for distilling\r\nby appropriating the heat of the vapors to be condensed. Thus two birds\r\nare killed with one stone. It will be noticed that the same result is\r\naccomplished in the columns _C_ and _D_. This is the principle of all\r\nmodern stills.\r\n\r\nAnother form of still which is very analogous to that last described is\r\nCoffey's apparatus, shown in Fig. 18, and is the immediate prototype of\r\nthe stills used to-day in all but the simplest plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Coffey's Rectifying Still.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of two columns, _C_ the analyser, and _H_ the rectifier,\r\nplaced side by side and above a chamber containing a steam pipe _b_ from\r\na boiler _A_. This chamber is divided into two compartments by a\r\nhorizontal partition _a_ pierced with small holes and furnished with four\r\nsafety valves _e e e e_. The column _C_ is divided into twelve small\r\ncompartments, by means of horizontal partitions of copper, also pierced\r\nwith holes and each provided with two little valves _f_. The spirituous\r\nvapors passing up this column are led by a pipe _i_ to the bottom of the\r\nsecond column or _rectifier_. This column is also divided into\r\ncompartments in precisely the same way, except that there are fifteen\r\nof them, the ten lowest being separated by the partitions, which are\r\npierced with holes. The remaining five partitions are not perforated, but\r\nhave a wide opening as at _w_, for the passage of the vapors, and form a\r\ncondenser for the finished spirit. Between each of these partitions\r\npasses one bend of a long zig-zag pipe _m_, beginning at the top of the\r\ncolumn, winding downwards to the bottom, and finally passing upwards\r\nagain to the top of the other column, so as to discharge its contents\r\ninto the highest compartment. The apparatus works in the following way:\r\nThe pump _Q_ is set in motion, and the zig-zag pipe _m_ then fills with\r\nthe wash or fermented liquor until it runs over at _n_ into the highest\r\ncompartment of column _C_. The pump is then stopped, and steam is\r\nintroduced through _b_, passing up through the two bottom chambers and\r\nthe short pipe _F_ into the analyzing column, finally reaching the bottom\r\nof the other column by means of the pipe _i_. Here it surrounds the coil\r\npipe _m_ containing the wash, so that the latter becomes rapidly heated.\r\n\r\nWhen several bends of the pipe have become heated, the pump is again set\r\nto work, and the hot wash is driven rapidly through the coil and into the\r\nanalyzer at _n_. Here it takes the course indicated by the arrows,\r\nrunning down from chamber to chamber through the tubes _h_ until it\r\nreaches the bottom; none of the liquor finds its way through the\r\nperforations in the various partitions, owing to the pressure of the\r\nascending steam.\r\n\r\nAs the liquid cannot pass through the holes in the partitions it can only\r\npass downward through the drop-pipe tubes _h_. By this means the mash is\r\nspread in a thin stratum over each partition to the depth of the seal _g_\r\nand is fully exposed to the steam forcing its way up through the holes,\r\nthe alcohol it contains being thus volatilized at every step.\r\n\r\nIn its course downwards the wash is met by the steam passing up through\r\nthe perforations, and the whole of the spirit which it contains is thus\r\nconverted into vapor. As soon as the chamber _B_ is nearly full of the\r\nspent wash, its contents are run off into the lower compartment by\r\nopening a valve in the pipe _V_. By means of the cock _E_, they are\r\nfinally discharged from the apparatus. This process is continued until\r\nall the wash has been pumped through.\r\n\r\nThe course taken by the steam will be readily understood by a glance at\r\nthe figure. When it has passed through each of the chambers of the\r\nanalyzer, the mixed vapors of water and spirit pass through the pipe _i_\r\ninto the rectifying column. Ascending again, they heat the coiled pipe\r\n_m_, and are partially deprived of aqueous vapors by condensation. Being\r\nthus gradually concentrated, by the time they reach the opening at _w_\r\nthey consist of nearly pure spirit, and are then condensed by the cool\r\nliquid in the pipe, fall upon the partition and are carried away by the\r\npipe _y_ to a refrigerator _W_. Any uncondensed gases pass out by the\r\npipe _R_ to the same refrigerator, where they are deprived of any alcohol\r\nthey may contain. The weak liquor condensed in the different compartments\r\nof the rectifier descends in the same manner as the wash descends in the\r\nother column; as it always contains a little spirit, it is conveyed by\r\nmeans of the pipe _S_ to the vessel _L_ in order to be pumped once more\r\nthrough the apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The condensed spirit= gathered over the plates _v_ passes out through\r\nthe pipe _y_ to the condensing worm _T_. If any vapors escape the\r\ncondensing plates they pass into _R_ and are condensed in the worm _T_\r\nalso. From worm _T_ the spirit flows into a suitable receiver _Z_.\r\n\r\nBefore the process of distillation commences, it is usual, especially\r\nwhen the common Scotch stills are employed, to add about one lb. of soap\r\nto the contents of the still for every 100 gallons of wash. This is done\r\nin order to prevent the liquid from boiling over, which object is\r\neffected in the following way: The fermented wash always contains small\r\nquantities of acetic acid; this acts upon the soap, liberating an oily\r\ncompound which floats upon the surface. The bubbles of gas as they rise\r\nfrom the body of the liquid are broken by this layer of oil, and hence\r\nthe violence of the ebullition is considerably checked. Butter is\r\nsometimes employed for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nFigs. 19 and 20 show a diagrammatic section and a plan of a still used\r\nfor thick mashes which are liable to burn. This comprises a circular\r\nchamber _B_ supported over suitable heating means, having on its bottom a\r\nseries of concentric partitions _b_ which divide the bottom of the\r\nchamber into shallow channels for the mash. Running diametrically through\r\nthe chamber is a partition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Rotary Current Still.]\r\n\r\nThe mash passes from a tank as _A_ by a passage _a_ to an opening on one\r\nside of the central portion and into the outside channel _b_. The current\r\nof liquid passes along the outer channel until it is deflected by the\r\ncentral partition into the next interior channel _b_ and so on until it\r\narrives at the center when it passes through the central partition into\r\nthe other half of the chamber. Here it passes around back and forth and\r\ngradually outward to the outermost channel from which it passes off\r\nthrough an adjustable gate in outlet _c_. By adjusting this gate, and a\r\ngate or cock in inlet passage _a_, the passage and consequent depth of\r\nthe liquid in the channels may be regulated. The vapor rising from the\r\nmash is carried over to a condenser through pipe _D_. In order to keep\r\nthe mash from burning a chain _g_ is rotarily reciprocated along the\r\nchannels by means of the bar _G_, the gear _E_ and the crank shaft _e_.\r\nVarious modifications of this construction have been devised. The\r\nadvantage of the still lies in submitting the mash in a thin current to\r\nthe action of the heat, and the consequent rapid vaporization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Rotary Current Still.]\r\n\r\nEvery distillation consists of two operations: The conversion of liquid\r\ninto vapor, and the reconversion of the vapor into liquid. Hence perfect\r\nequilibrium should be established between the vaporizing heat and the\r\ncondensing cold. The quantity of vapor must not be greater or less than\r\ncan be condensed. If fire is too violent the vapors will pass out of the\r\nworm uncondensed. If the fire is too low the pressure of the vapor is\r\nnot great enough to prevent the entrance of air, which obstructs\r\ndistillation. As a means of indicating the proper regulation of the fire,\r\nthe simple little device shown in Fig. 21 may be used.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a tube of copper or glass having a ball _B_ eight inches\r\nin diameter. The upper end _E_ of the tube is attached to the condensing\r\nworm. The lower end of the tube is bent in U-shape; the length of the two\r\nbends from _b_ to outlet is four feet. The ball has a capacity slightly\r\ngreater than the two legs of the bend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Indicator for Regulating the Distilling Fire.]\r\n\r\nNormally the liquid in the two legs will stand at a level. If, however,\r\nthe fire is too brisk the vapor will enter the tube and drive out the\r\nliquor at _d_, and thus the level in the leg _C_ will be less than in the\r\nleg _D_. If, however, the fire is low, the pressure of vapor in the worm\r\nwill decrease and the pressure of the outside air will force down the\r\nliquid in leg _D_ and up leg _C_ into the ball.\r\n\r\nA more perfected device but operating on the same principle is shown in\r\nFig. 26.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to present in the small compass of this book a\r\ndescription of all the varieties of stills used, but these which have\r\nbeen described illustrate the principles on which all stills are\r\nconstructed and were chosen for their simplicity of construction and\r\nclearness of their operation. The principle of their operation is exactly\r\nthe same as the more modern forms now to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                      MODERN DISTILLING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we have given a description of small, simple\r\nstills, such as were used until late years, and which are yet used in\r\nmany localities where distilling is carried on on a small scale. We will\r\nnow describe the principle features of more complicated and elaborate\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nAll modern distilling apparatus for the production of a high grade of\r\nalcohol is based upon the principle set forth in the description of the\r\nCoffey still; that is, upon using a distilling column and a concentrating\r\ncolumn, wherein the \"wash\" or mash fermented as described, passes over a\r\nseries of plates or other obstructions in contact with an ascending\r\ncolumn of heated vapor. This heated vapor extracts the alcohol from the\r\nwash, or from the low wines of the concentrator, and is continually\r\nstrengthened during its journey until it passes off to a condenser as a\r\nvapor very rich in alcohol. The converse of this is true with the wash,\r\nwhich in its downward course is gradually deprived of its alcohol until\r\nit finally passes off at the bottom of the column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Diagramatic View of Column Still and Accessory\r\nApparatus. (_To face page 64_)]\r\n\r\nFig. 22 is illustrative of the general form and arrangement of such a\r\ncolumn and its adjuncts; the details, however, will vary with each make\r\nof still. In this the \"column\" consists of a casing really continuous but\r\ndivided into two portions--the distilling portion _A_ and the rectifying\r\nportion _B_. The operation is alike, however, in principle in both\r\nportions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-Section of Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Distilling Plate.]\r\n\r\nThe wash by means of a suitable pump is forced into an overhead tank or\r\nconcentrator _G_ where it is warmed by the hot vapors as will be later\r\ndescribed. It passes around the interior of the concentrator in a coil\r\n_c_ and then passes off by a pipe _a_ to the uppermost plate of the\r\ndistilling portion _A_ of the column.\r\n\r\nThe plates, as before explained on page 55, are each formed with a\r\ndropping tube _O_ (see Fig. 23), which extends above the plate to an\r\nextent slightly less than the desired thickness of the layer of liquid on\r\neach plate, and with perforations each having an upwardly projecting rim,\r\nand each covered with a cap _A_. This rim and cap form a trap. The\r\nascending vapors pass up through the perforations, down between the rim\r\nand the edge of the cap and thus out through the layer of wash contained\r\non the cap. The wash remains constantly level with the top of the tube\r\n_O_, the excess running off through the tube _O_ to the compartment or\r\nplate beneath.\r\n\r\nTo return to Fig. 22, the wash by the pipe _a_ enters the distilling\r\nportion of the column at the uppermost plate thereof and, as described\r\nabove, drops down from plate to plate. A steam pipe _S_ enters the bottom\r\ncompartment of the distilling portion of the column and the steam as it\r\nrises through the little traps, bubbles out through the layer of wash and\r\nin each compartment enriches itself with alcohol. Thus the rising column\r\nof vapor is constantly becoming richer and the downward current of wash\r\nconstantly weaker until at last it passes away as spent wash at the very\r\nbottom of the column by the pipe _D_.\r\n\r\nThe hot vapors, as before described, pass upward and enter the rectifying\r\nportion of the column _B_. This consists of a series of compartments\r\nhaving perforated bottoms and dropping tubes. The vapor passes upward\r\nthrough these perforations of the plates,--the condensed portion of it\r\ndropping back again on to the lower plates or on to the distilling plates\r\nto be again vaporized and concentrated and the more highly vaporized\r\nportion passing out at the top of the column through the pipe _E_ to the\r\nconcentrator _G_.\r\n\r\nThe concentrator consists of a tank containing water within which is\r\nsupported a vessel _F_ having double walls. The interior of this vessel\r\nis likewise filled with water. Between the double walls and surrounding\r\nthe coiled pipe _c_ passes the vapors from pipe _E_.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the vessel _F_ is a compartment _f_ connected by a pipe\r\n_F¥_ with the upper compartment of the rectifying column. The less highly\r\nheated vapors will be condensed by the passage through the double walls\r\nof the vessel and the condensation will collect in the compartment _f_,\r\nand from there pass off by pipe _F¥_ back to the rectifying column, to be\r\nagain vaporized and strengthened by the descent from plate to plate of\r\n_B_.\r\n\r\nThe rich and highly vaporized vapors which have passed the test of this\r\npreliminary concentration, pass out of the compartment _f_ by a pipe _M_.\r\nHere again the water surrounding the pipe tends to condense all but the\r\nmost highly charged vapor and send it back to compartment _f_ but the\r\nvapor which succeeds in passing over through pipe _G_ is carried downward\r\nto a condenser _H_ where it is finally condensed and drawn off as at _g_.\r\nIt is necessary that the rate of mash feed be regulated so that neither\r\ntoo much mash shall be pumped into the mash heater _G_, or too little,\r\nand the pipe leading from the pump to the heater is therefore provided\r\nwith a tap and an indicating dial.\r\n\r\nIn these modern stills the following are particularly important points to\r\nbe especially brought to the consideration of the distiller.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly impressed that effectiveness of the distilling\r\ncolumn depends on the plates dividing it,--that is, upon the\r\nhorizontality of the plates and the form of the traps or perforations. If\r\nthe plates are not horizontal the wash is not maintained at a uniform\r\nlevel across the entire extent of the plate and hence some of the\r\nascending vapor will pass out without contacting with the wash through\r\nuncovered traps, while others of the traps will be so deeply submerged in\r\nwash that the vapor cannot bubble through.\r\n\r\nAgain the caps should be so made as to divide the vapor into fine streams\r\nand bring it into contact with each part of the wash. Plates simply\r\nperforated and uncapped give excellent results for they molecularize the\r\nvapor ascending through the liquid contained on the plates, but they\r\nrequire a constant pressure of vapor, and any variations of pressure\r\ntends to discharge them. In addition these perforations gradually enlarge\r\nby the action of acids in the wash or clog up, and the apparatus soon\r\nworks badly.\r\n\r\nGood forms of capped traps are those shown in Figs. 24, 25 devised by\r\nBarbet. These are provided with an interior upwardly projecting rim.\r\nExtending over the rim and down around it is a copper cap having its\r\nmargin slitted.\r\n\r\nThe wash carried on the plate circulates about the caps and the alcoholic\r\nvapors bubble out through the slits and up through the wash, the vapor\r\nthus being finely divided and coming into intimate contact with each\r\nportion of the wash and thus more thoroughly depriving it of its alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Barbet Trap.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Barbet Trap.]\r\n\r\nBesides this there is another advantage resident in these caps, namely,\r\nthat distillation may be stopped for several hours and then re-started\r\nwithout trouble for the reason that the wash has been retained on the\r\nplates, whereas were the plates simply perforated the wash would ooze\r\nthrough and the plates have to be recharged. This form of plate may be\r\neasily repaired and does not necessitate the removal or replacement of\r\nthe plate itself. The caps alone need be removed.\r\n\r\nFor thick washes, which tends to obstruct the slits of the cap, Barbet\r\nhas devised the cap shown at the right in Fig. 25. This cap extends down\r\nto the plate itself, and has very narrow slits in its periphery. With\r\nsuch a cap as shown in Fig. 24, the bran, sediments, etc., would tend to\r\nsettle upon the top of the cap, enter beneath it and through the slits.\r\nThe cone-shape of the top of this cap prevents the deposit of dregs\r\nthereon and the very narrow slits oppose the entrance of bran or\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nWhile, for the sake of clearness, an old form of concentrator, _G_, has\r\nbeen shown, the concentrator, preheater for the wash, and condensers,\r\nto-day, are usually composed of bundles of tubes through which the vapors\r\npass surrounded by water or the cool wash. These should be of bronze or\r\ncopper and made without solder. The tubes should be capable of being\r\ntaken out for cleaning or repairing.\r\n\r\nIn many distilling apparatuses the distilling column and the rectifying\r\ncolumn are in two parts, one beside the other. This overcomes the\r\nobjection of having a very high column and also prevents the low wines,\r\n_i.e._, the weak alcoholic liquor after its first concentration, from\r\npassing into the wash as it would do with the continuous column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Steam Regulator.]\r\n\r\nIn order that the amount of steam entering the column may be regulated,\r\nthe column is usually provided with a steam regulator (Fig. 26); whose\r\nprinciple of operation may be easily under stood by referring to Fig. 22.\r\nIt comprises an upper and a lower chamber _Z Z¥_ connected by a central\r\ntube _K_ which projects down nearly to the bottom of the lower chamber. A\r\npipe _W_ communicates with the steam chamber _R_ of the column and enters\r\nthe chamber _Z_ above the level of the water contained therein. In the\r\nupper chamber _Z¥_, is a float _X_, connected to the differential lever\r\n_T_ of a steam valve _T¥_ which controls the inlet of steam passing\r\nthrough pipe _S_ to the steam chest _R_. The principle of operation is\r\nvery simple. When the pressure in the steam chest _R_ becomes too great,\r\nsteam in the pipe _W_ and chamber _Z_ forces the water therein up in tube\r\n_K_, thus lifting the float _X_ and closing the steam entrance valve\r\n_T¥_. When the pressure of steam is low, the level of the liquid in _Z_\r\nrises and liquid in _Z¥_ runs into _Z_, the float _X_ falls opening valve\r\n_T¥_ and allowing a greater flow of steam.\r\n\r\nAs it is often desirable to change the pressure of steam in the column at\r\nvarious points in the operation, the best regulators are usually provided\r\nwith means to that end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Gauge Glass for Regulatur.]\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the output of the still, there is attached thereto a\r\ngauge glass (_J_ in Fig. 22), a diagram of which is shown in Fig. 27.\r\nThis consists of a jar _A_ connected at its lower end at _b_ by an\r\nannular passage _B_ to a chamber _E_ from which proceed the taps _F_.\r\nCentrally through the passage _B_ passes a tube _c_ connected at its\r\nlower end to the pipe _C_ leading from the condenser. The tube _C c_\r\nprojects upward into the jar _A_ and is open at its upper end.\r\n\r\nNow the opening _b_ is of a certain size and it is obvious that it will\r\ncarry off a certain amount of liquid when running full or the amount\r\nallowed to flow out by the exit tap _F_. If now, more than that quantity\r\nof alcohol is produced, the alcohol will rise in the jar _A_ until the\r\nrate of inflow and outflow is equal. If, however, the still is producing\r\nless than that quantity then the level of liquid in _A_ will gradually\r\ndrop. Hence, by observing the level of the liquid in _A_ and its\r\nconstancy or variation in level, it is possible to tell precisely how\r\nmuch alcohol is running per hour and if the rate is steady. The jar _A_\r\nis provided with a cap _G_ whereby an alcoholometer may be inserted\r\ninto tube _c_ for the purpose of testing the strength of the liquor. The\r\ntaps _F_ are for the purpose of collecting the first runnings, the pure\r\nalcohol and the last runnings or \"feints.\"\r\n\r\nThese principles are also embodied in the apparatus designed by the\r\nVulcan Copper Works Co., of Cincinnati, and illustrated in Fig. 28. The\r\napparatus comprises the still, a wash heater and a condenser. The still\r\nis composed of a series of chambers from 12 to 24, the internal\r\nconstruction of which is shown in Fig. 29. Each chamber consists of a\r\npeculiarly perforated plate _A_, a drop pipe _B_, a seal _C_, into which\r\nthe drop pipe from the plate above projects, and a central standard _D_.\r\n\r\nReturning now to Fig. 28, at the bottom of the column is a manifold _E_,\r\nwith pipes _F_ and _G_ whereby either exhaust or live steam may be\r\nadmitted. _H_ designates the discharge or slop valve, controlled by a\r\nfloat _I_ whereby a constant level of slop or spent wash is kept in the\r\nbottom chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Continuous Distilling Apparatus, with External\r\nTubular Condenser. (_To face page 72_)]\r\n\r\nTo the right of the column is seen the slop tester _J_ and hydrometer\r\n_L_, whereby the spent wash may be tested to see if the spirit is being\r\nproperly extracted. The steam pressure is indicated by means of a float\r\n_N_ contained within a vessel _M_, a tally weight moving against a scale\r\n_K_, showing the pressure of steam entering through pipe _O_ and acting\r\nagainst water contained in vessel _M_. Each chamber is provided with a\r\nmanhole plate _P_, and a try-cock _Q_, whereby the operation of each\r\nchamber may be tested. _R_ is a gage glass to show the level of the slop\r\nin the bottom chamber.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the column are three rectifying chambers fitted with\r\nboiling pipes and traps _T_, which distribute the ascending vapor and\r\nboil out the low wines returned from the wash-heater or fore-warmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Detail of Chamber, Continuous Still.]\r\n\r\nThe heater consists of a shell enclosing a series of tubes extending into\r\nan upper and lower chamber. The wash or \"beer,\" is pumped into the lower\r\nchamber of the heater, and passes upward through the tubes to the upper\r\nchamber from which is it carried by a pipe to the plate _A_ next below\r\nthe rectifying plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Detail of Perforated Plate _A_.]\r\n\r\nThe vapor from the column passes into the middle compartment of the\r\nheater and surrounds the beer tubes. The vapors give their heat to the\r\nbeer and are thus cooled, the low wines being condensed and flowing back\r\nonto the uppermost rectifying plate, while the highly vaporized portions\r\npass out to the condenser. This is of the same general construction as\r\nthe heater, the vapor being cooled and condensed to liquid by the tubes\r\nthrough which a constant current of cool water is passed. This enters at\r\n_U_ and passes out at _V_. These tubular condensers are particularly good\r\nas they may be easily cleaned. From the condenser the spirit passes to a\r\ndischarge box _W_. A portion of the flow passes into a test tube _X_,\r\nprovided with a hydrometer. A trap _Y_ and an air pipe _Z_ provide means\r\nfor the escape of gas.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the form of perforations in the plates of a column\r\nthrough which the vapor pass upward through the beer or wash is\r\nparticularly important. The steam must be thoroughly diffused through the\r\nbeer, or else particles of mash are carried up, accumulate around the\r\nperforations, baking there and clogging them up. The clogging and\r\neventual stoppage of the perforations prevent the agitation of the mash\r\ncarried on the plate, and a layer of mash accumulates and bakes on the\r\nhead, or plate, above. Thus the operating capacity of the still is\r\nreduced and a larger quantity and greater pressure of steam is necessary\r\nwith consequent waste of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Detail of Perforated Plate _A_.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary then that the form of perforation or trap through which\r\nthe vapor ascends should be such that agitation of the beer shall be\r\nenforced in its movement across the plate, and that the steam shall be\r\nthoroughly diffused through the beer. In the Vulcan still above referred\r\nto, these results are accomplished by forming each perforation with a\r\ntongue, as shown in the fragmentary view of a plate, Figs. 30 and 31, the\r\ntongues of all the holes being directed towards the periphery of the\r\nplate. It is claimed that by this construction the steam is diverted\r\nforward and injected into the beer, throwing the beer into vigorous\r\nmotion, completely diffusing the steam and accelerating the motion of the\r\nbeer from the seal _C_ to the drop pipe _B_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Continuous Distilling Apparatus with Goose\r\nSeparator. (_To face page 76_)]\r\n\r\nFig. 32 illustrates another form of distilling apparatus manufactured by\r\nthe same company, which is practically the same as the apparatus\r\npreviously described except that it is provided with a \"goose-necked\"\r\nseparator, interposed between the wash-heater and the enclosure. This\r\nconsists of a series of convoluted tubes contained in a tank of cold\r\nwater. The vapor from the heater passes into these convolutions. The\r\nheavier vapors are condensed therein and returned to the heater from\r\nwhich they descend into the column while the more volatilized vapors pass\r\nover into the final condenser. The _U_-bends at the bottoms of each\r\nconvolution act like so many low wine chambers in the still shown in Fig.\r\n9 the highly heated vapor continually bubbling through the condensed\r\nvapor in the _U_ bend and there becoming greatly enriched and\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, it is claimed, is applicable to the distillation of\r\ngrain, molasses or cane juice and will yield 170 or 180 per cent., or the\r\nequivalent to 85-90 G. L. or 34-36 Cartier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Section of Gillaume's Inclined Column Still.]\r\n\r\nA distinctly modern type of still, though akin to the still shown in\r\nFigs. 19 and 20, is the inclined column of Gillaume, shown in section in\r\nFig. 33 and in full view in Fig. 34. Gillaume in devising this form of\r\napparatus had particularly in mind the distillation of thick washes, and\r\nthe necessity of compelling a circulation of the wash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Gillaume's Inclined Column Still.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the inclined column _A_ is divided by lateral extending,\r\nupwardly projecting plates or partitions _a_ forming a continuous\r\nchannel through which the wash passes from side to side and from top to\r\nbottom and then out through a regulator. The upper plate of the column\r\nhas downwardly projecting partitions _b_ which with the partitions _a_\r\nform a series of traps. The steam enters at the bottom of the column into\r\na reservoir, and in order to pass upward is forced beneath each partition\r\n_b_ and through the washer contained in the channels of the bottom. When\r\nit reaches the upper end of the column it has passed through a continuous\r\nseries of wash-filled compartments containing a constantly moving current\r\nof wash.\r\n\r\nThe vapors from the top of the column pass off to the wash heater or to a\r\nconcentrator.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 34 is shown a form of Gillaume still designed to distill all\r\nsorts of liquids whether thin or thick. The wash is supplied from an\r\noverhead tank to a regulating tank _K_ from which a pipe _k_ leads to a\r\nregulating tap _m_. The wash re-ascends into the wash heater _B_ and when\r\nheated descends by pipe _F_ into the uppermost compartments of the column\r\n_A_. The vapor passes to the condenser _B_, by a pipe _H_, and the spent\r\nwash is discharged by a siphon _C_. In addition to the parts above\r\nreferred to, _a_ designates entrance of wash into heater, _b_ exhaust\r\ntest tube, _d_ steam entrance tap _G_ alcohol test glass, _G¥_ exhaust\r\ntest glass, _o_ valve for regulating strength of spirit, _O_ steam\r\nregulator, _p_ water entrance tap, _r_ exit tap, and _D_ the spent wash\r\nextractor.\r\n\r\nThe Gillaume apparatus is particularly valuable for the production of\r\nindustrial or agricultural alcohol. It is claimed that it is easily\r\nunderstood and operated even by unskilled labor, while it produces a\r\nlarge proportion of alcohol of a high strength.\r\n\r\nA view of a complete apparatus on a large scale is shown in the Fig. 40\r\nin the chapter on rectification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                             RECTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe product of the distillation of alcoholic liquors, which is termed\r\n_low wine_, does not usually contain alcohol in sufficient quantity to\r\nadmit of its being employed for direct consumption. Besides this it\r\nalways contains substances which have the property of distilling over\r\nwith the spirit, although their boiling points, when in the pure state,\r\nare much higher than that of alcohol. These are all classed under the\r\ngeneric title of _fusel-oil_; owing to their very disagreeable taste and\r\nsmell, their presence in spirit is extremely objectionable. In order to\r\nremove them, the rough products of distillation are submitted to a\r\nfurther process of concentration and purification. Besides fusel-oil,\r\nthey contain other substances, such as aldehyde, various ethers, etc.,\r\nthe boiling points of which are lower than that of alcohol; these must\r\nalso be removed, as they impart to the spirit a fiery taste. The whole\r\nprocess is termed _rectification_, and is carried on in a distillatory\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the wash as discharged into the still consists of\r\nalcohol mixed with water and a variety of impurities from which the\r\nalcohol must be separated. In order that the process may be better\r\nunderstood we will assume that a mixture of pure alcohol and water is to\r\nbe operated on in place of the wash as above referred to. Distillation in\r\nthis case is intended to deprive the water of its alcohol, the operation\r\ntheoretically leaving water in one chamber and alcohol in another. This\r\nis accomplished by reason of the differences in the boiling points of\r\nwater and alcohol. The alcohol vaporizes at a lower degree (173∞ F.) than\r\nwater (212∞ F.) Thus the liquid at the end of the operation has been\r\ndivided into two parts or _fractions_.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not a clean division for the reason that while in the\r\nbeginning the vapors contain a large quantity of the more volatile\r\nalcohol, at the end they will contain a large portion of the less\r\nvolatile water. The whole of the alcohol will be separated in this\r\nmanner, but it will still be mixed with some water and in order to again\r\ndivide the alcohol from the water the first distillate would have to be\r\nredistilled until at last the water is reduced to a minimum or entirely\r\neliminated, if possible.\r\n\r\nBut as it requires less heat to vaporize alcohol than water, so it also\r\nrequires more cold to condense alcoholic-vapor than water-vapor. If then\r\nwe pass the mixed vapors into a condensing chamber cooled to a certain\r\ntemperature low enough to condense water-vapor but not the alcohol-vapor,\r\nthen the water-vapor will fall down as water while the alcohol-vapor\r\nbeing uncondensed passes on to another chamber where its temperature\r\nfalls to a point where it in turn condenses into liquid.\r\n\r\nIn intermittent distillation, as by the simple still, the vapors of mixed\r\nalcohol and water at first contain a great deal of alcohol and a little\r\nwater, then more water and less alcohol, and then a great deal of water\r\nand hardly any alcohol. It may be asked: \"Why not take only the runnings\r\nrich in alcohol and leave the others?\" The answer to this is that if this\r\nbe done then _all_ the alcohol is not extracted from the wash and there\r\nis just that much loss. The solution of the problem is to get all the\r\nalcohol out mixed with the water that is inevitably with it and then\r\nredistill this result thus getting out (sifting away) some of the water,\r\nand again distill this result, and so on until only pure alcohol is left.\r\nThis, however, is a very troublesome business and has been abandoned as a\r\nmeans of removing impurities such as water, the ethers, and fusel oil\r\nexcept by makers of whiskey, brandy and other beverage spirits, in favor\r\nof continuous distillation and continuous rectification.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from what has gone before that there are two means of\r\nseparating alcohol and water; one by an initial difference in heating and\r\nby a further difference in cooling or condensing.\r\n\r\nIt is on this foundation that the whole art of fractional distillation or\r\nrectification rests. While we have for illustration been considering a\r\nmixture of pure alcohol and water, the wash or liquid formed by the\r\nfermentation of grain, etc., contains a variety of ingredients of\r\ndifferent boiling points, some more volatile than alcohol, some less. The\r\nfermented wash consists first of non-volatile or only slightly volatile\r\nmatters, such as salts, proteins, glycerin, lactic acid, yeast, etc., and\r\nsecond, volatile bodies such as alcohol, water, various ethers, etc.,\r\nfusel oils and acetic acid.\r\n\r\nWhen wash is distilled in the ordinary simple or pot still, the first\r\npart to come over consists of the very volatile matters,--more volatile\r\nthan alcohol even,--that is, the ethers mixed with some alcohol. This is\r\nknown as the fore-shot or first runnings, and is collected separately.\r\nWhen the spirit coming over possesses no objectionable odor, the second\r\nstage has begun. This running would be of the alcohol proper, getting\r\nweaker and weaker, however, as the running continues and this would be\r\ncaught separately as long as it is of sufficient strength. At last would\r\ncome the weak spirit containing much fusel oil. It is to be understood,\r\nhowever, that there is no defined line between these divisions. They\r\ngraduate one into the other. The first and last runnings in the old\r\npractice were mixed together and distilled with the next charge. When a\r\nstrong spirit was required, rectification would be repeated several\r\ntimes. It is customary, however, with the improved modern apparatus, to\r\nproduce at the outset spirit containing but little fusel oil and at least\r\n80 per cent of alcohol. This is then purified and concentrated in the\r\nabove manner and afterwards reduced with water to the required strength.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the offensive flavor of the products of distillation is\r\nthe presence of various acids, which exist in all fermented liquors; they\r\nare chiefly tartaric, malic, acetic, and lactic acids. The excessive\r\naction of heat upon liquors which have been distilled by an open fire has\r\nalso a particularly objectionable influence upon the flavor of the\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe first operation in the process of rectification is to neutralize the\r\nabove-mentioned acids; this is effected by means of milk of lime, which\r\nis added to the liquor in quantity depending upon its acidity; the point\r\nat which the neutralization is complete is determined by the use of\r\nlitmus paper. In the subsequent process of distillation, the\r\ndetermination of the exact moments at which to begin and to cease\r\ncollecting the pure spirit is very difficult to indicate. It must be\r\nregulated by the nature of the spirits; some may be pure 20 or 30 minutes\r\nafter they have attained the desired strength; and some only run pure an\r\nhour, or even more, after this point. The product should be tasted\r\nfrequently, after being diluted with water, or a few drops may be poured\r\ninto the palm of the hand, and after striking the hands together, it will\r\nbe known by the odor whether the spirit be of good quality or not; these\r\ntwo means may be applied simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Rectifying Still.]\r\n\r\nThe process of rectification may be carried on in the apparatus shown in\r\nFigs. 35 and 36. _A_ is a still which contains the spirit to be\r\nrectified; it should be four-fifths full. The condenser _E_ and the\r\ncooler _G_ are filled with water. After closing the cocks _L_ and _I_,\r\nthe contents of the still are heated by steam, which is introduced at\r\nfirst slowly. The vapors of spirit given off pass, by tubes _b_, above\r\neach plate _a_, of the series in column _B_, and escape through _C_ and\r\n_D_ into the condenser _E_, where they are condensed on reaching the\r\nlentils _d d¥_, and return in a liquid state through pipe _f_ and\r\nconnections _g g¥_ to the upper plates of the column _B_. In these return\r\npipes the liquid is volatilized, and constantly recharged with alcohol to\r\nbe again condensed, until the water in the condenser is hot enough to\r\npermit the lighter alcoholic vapors to pass into the coil _c c c_,\r\nwithout being reduced to the liquid state. When this is the case, the\r\nvapors pass through _F_ into the cooler _G_, where they undergo complete\r\ncondensation. Great care must be taken that the heat is not so great as\r\nto permit any of the vapors to pass over uncondensed or to flow away in a\r\nhot state; and also to keep up a constant supply of water in the cooler\r\nwithout producing too low a temperature; the alcoholic products should\r\nrun out just cold. The highly volatile constituents of the spirit come\r\nover first, that which follows becoming gradually purer until it consists\r\nof well-flavored alcohol; after this comes a product containing the\r\nessential oils. The more impure products are kept apart from the rest\r\nand re-distilled with the next charge. Some hours generally elapse before\r\nalcohol begins to flow from the cooler. The purest alcohol is obtained\r\nwhile its strength is kept between 92∞ and 96∞ Baume, and the operation\r\nis complete when the liquid flowing through the vessel marks not more\r\nthan 3∞ or 4∞ Baume; it is better, however, to stop the still when the\r\nbacking or \"faints\" indicate 10∞, because the product after this point\r\ncontains much fusel-oil, and is not worth collecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Section of Rectifying Still.]\r\n\r\nIn order to cleanse the apparatus--which should be performed after each\r\nworking--the still _A_ is emptied of water by opening the cock _Q_. The\r\ncontents of the condenser are then emptied in like manner by opening the\r\ncock _J_, through which they flow upon the plates in the column _B_, and\r\nwash out essential oils which remain in them. These two cocks are then\r\nclosed, and the door _U_ in the still head is removed. The water in the\r\ncooler _G_ is then run by means of pipe into the still _A_, so as\r\npartially to cover the steam-coil in the latter. After again securing the\r\ndoor _U_, a strong heat is applied, and the water in the still is well\r\nboiled, the steam evolved thoroughly cleansing all the different parts of\r\nthe apparatus; this is continued for 15 or 20 minutes, when the heat is\r\nwithdrawn and the still left to cool gradually.\r\n\r\nIn the intermittent rectifying still above described the impure products\r\nare distilled with the next charge. In the apparatus as perfected and\r\nused in large distilleries or rectification plants, the division of the\r\nseveral products composing the phlegm or raw spirit is made at one time\r\nand continuously on the principle now to be described.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the beginning of this chapter that the various\r\nimpurities in alcohol, the ethers, the water and the fusel oils, have\r\neach their own vaporizing point and each their own condensing point. As\r\nthis is so, they may be separated from each other and from the alcohol on\r\nthe same principle as we have seen that water is separated from the\r\nmixture of pure alcohol and water; that is, by fractionation, as it is\r\ntermed, or by \"sifting out\" one body from another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Fractional Distilling Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThus in fractional distillation, each condenser or retort in the\r\napparatus shown in Fig. 37, above acts as a sieve or trap, letting pass\r\nthe most volatile substances but retaining those of a less degree of\r\nvolatility. By passing the mixed vapor together through a good condensing\r\nmedium the temperature of which is lower than the boiling point of the\r\nless volatile, but not so low as the boiling point of the more volatile\r\nthe vapors of the less volatile liquid will be condensed, while the more\r\nvolatile will retain their gaseous form. Thus by having a number of\r\ncondensing mediums each one slightly lower in temperature than the other,\r\nthe various vapors with their various points of volatilization will be\r\nsuccessively condensed, allowing the passage of the more volatile vapors\r\nover to the condenser beyond.\r\n\r\nIf we had mixed gravel and sand and desired to separate the gravel into\r\nassorted sizes and get the sand by itself, we would pass the mass through\r\na series of sieves of gradually smaller mesh. The first sieve of course\r\nwould catch all the largest pebbles, the next in size would let all the\r\nsecond sized gravel through, and so on until the final sieve would have\r\nseparated the coarse sand from the fine. In this figure of illustration,\r\nthe coarse pebbles may be taken to represent the water and the fusel oils\r\nwhich are mixed and partly tend to rise with the alcohol, and the alcohol\r\nmay be represented as the gravel larger than the sand, and the fine sand\r\nas the etheric vapors. If this gravel were forced upwardly through a\r\nseries of sieves gradually growing finer, it would be analogous\r\nfiguratively to the upward passage of the vapors through a distilling\r\ncolumn composed of plates or chambers; the water and fusel oils would be\r\nretained in the lower portion of the column and continually sent back\r\nthere; the alcohol would pass into the upper chambers of the column and\r\nthe ethers or fore-shots would pass out from the very fine sieve at the\r\ntop of the column.\r\n\r\nThe vertical chambers above each plate of the rectifying column are\r\nto-day used as the separate eliminating chambers referred to above. It\r\nhas been found in practice that as before stated, each plate of a column\r\ncontained upon it liquid of a certain temperature and above it vapors of\r\na certain degree of vaporization. That is, in a continuous column fed\r\nregularly by condensation from above and supplied with a constant flow of\r\nphlegm, each plate carries upon it a liquid of constant composition\r\nrelative to the boiling point of the fluid on that plate. As many\r\nextractions may thus be made from the various plates as there are\r\ndifferent liquids to be isolated. Thus by tapping different portions of\r\nthe column, vapors of different degrees of vaporization are found and may\r\nbe carried off and the phlegm be thus fractionated. In the case of one\r\ncolumn the first runnings or fore-shot would be found in the upper\r\nportion of the column to which they would have risen by reason of their\r\ndegree of volatility. The last runnings or oils, aldehydes, etc., would\r\nbe found in the lower portion of the column still mixed with the spirit,\r\nwhile upon the plates of the middle portion of the column would be found\r\nthe vapor of the alcohol freed from the fusel oils and from the,ethers.\r\n\r\nIt is understood, of course, throughout this description that the liquid\r\nbeing treated is not wash but phlegm; that is, the raw spirit containing\r\nthe fusel oils, ethers, water and alcohol.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 represents a simple rectifying apparatus designed for small or\r\nmedium sized plants, and manufactured by the Vulcan Copper Works Co., of\r\nCincinnati. The still is upright, with a chambered column above it, of\r\nthe usual type. The chambers are fitted with a vapor boiling pipe and cap\r\nand a drop pipe, and each is provided with cocks whereby it may be\r\ndrained for cleansing. Above the column is a separator, comprising a\r\ncasing containing a series of tubes. The vapor from the column circulates\r\naround the tubes through which passes a current of cool water. The\r\ncondenser is of the same construction as the separator and is provided\r\nwith a gage glass and a draw-off cock. The operation is the same as in\r\nother simple rectifiers; part of the vapor from the column is condensed\r\nin the separator and passes back on to the upper plates, while the more\r\nhighly vaporized portions pass over into the condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Rectifying Apparatus with External Tubular\r\nCondenser. (_To face page 94_)]\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the still is large relatively to its depth so as to yield\r\nan economical and at the same time highly effective distribution of heat\r\nthrough the charge. This also affords an extended boiling area from which\r\nthe vapor rises evenly and regularly, thus ensuring conditions peculiarly\r\nconducive to produce the best fractionating. The floor space required for\r\nthis still and others of the same character built by this company is very\r\ncompact and excessive weight on the top floor of the building is\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\nWe have shown in Figs. 39 and 40 two forms of rectifying apparatus, one a\r\ntwin column Barbet rectifier and the other a rectifier of the Gillaume\r\ntype combined with inclined column still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Twin Column Barbet Rectifier.]\r\n\r\nIn the twin column apparatus, Fig. 39, the first column or clarifier _A_\r\nreceives the raw phlegm and accomplishes the elimination of ethers. The\r\nclarified phlegm passes then to the second column where the alcohol\r\nis separated from the last runnings or fusel oil. In other words, the\r\nphlegm or impure raw alcohol is only raised to such a temperature in the\r\nfirst column as to drive off the very volatile constituents such as the\r\nethers. These therefore pass off at the top of the first column into the\r\ncondenser _C_, the retrogradation or condensed alcohol being returned to\r\n_A_, while the boiling phlegm taken from the middle of the column and\r\nstill containing the aldehydes, oils, etc., is conducted by a pipe _E_ to\r\nthe second column _B_ wherein the last runnings or amylic oils, etc., are\r\nseparated from the purified spirits.\r\n\r\nThe vapors in this column are carried to the condensers _D_ and _F_ and\r\nfrom there to a refrigerator _G_. The fusel oils are extracted from the\r\nplates slightly below the center of the column and are carried to an oil\r\nconcentrating apparatus _H_.\r\n\r\nIn the most complete forms of apparatus used to-day, there is a variation\r\nof this construction. The first runnings, middle runnings and the last\r\nrunnings are each led off from the main column to separate coolers,\r\ncondensers, etc., and the purified result from each of these columns is\r\nin turn led to a trunk rectifier common to all where the product is\r\nredistilled and entirely freed from impurities. This gives a very high\r\ngrade of alcohol by a process practically continuous. At the same time\r\nthe impurities are not returned to the first or main column to\r\ncontaminate the vapors therein and add to the amount of fusel oils\r\ncontained on the lower plates. In construction of this character there\r\nis a very large saving in the cost of the fuel and the result is much\r\nbetter in every way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Gillaume's Rectifier and Inclined Still.]\r\n\r\nFIG. 40.--GUILLAUME'S DIRECT DISTILLATION-RECTIFICATION APPARATUS FOR\r\n\"AGRICULTURAL\" DISTILLATIONS.\r\n\r\n  _A_  Distilling Column.\r\n  _a_  Tank for Wash to be Distilled.\r\n  _b_  Cold Water Tank.\r\n  _C_  Rectification Column.\r\n  _D_  Final Purification Column.\r\n  _I_  Wash Heater.\r\n  _K_  Condenser.\r\n  _K¥_ Refrigerator of Ethers.\r\n  _O_  Refrigerator for high-grade Alcohol and the First Runnings.\r\n  _Q_  Refrigerator for the Products of the Last Runnings.\r\n  _R_  Spent Wash Extractor.\r\n  _r_  Siphon Carrying off Spent Wash.\r\n  _S_  Steam Regulator.\r\n  _s_  Tap and Pipe for Carrying Wash to Distilling Column.\r\n  _U_  Water Regulator.\r\n  _u_  Taps for the Extraction of Intermediate Impurities.\r\n  _V_  Receiver Accumulator.\r\n  _v_  Tap for the Extraction of the Last Runnings.\r\n  _X_  Test Glass for the High-Grade Alcohol.\r\n  _Y_  Test Glass for First Runnings.\r\n  _Y¥_ Test Glass for Last Runnings.\r\n  _Z_  Test Glass for Determining Degree of Exhaustion of Spent Wash.\r\n\r\nIn this apparatus the still proper is of the form heretofore described on\r\npage 78. The liquid to be distilled enters at the top of the inclined\r\ncolumn _A_ and descends to the base thereof. The alcoholic vapor rises\r\nthrough the column and passes off from the head thereof into the\r\nrectifying column. At the head of the column _A_ it has a strength of\r\nabout 40∞ to 50∞ F. The column _C_ is supported upon an accumulating\r\nreservoir _V_ which acts to regulate the flow of the phlegm through the\r\nrectifying column and prevents too great an exhaustion of the plates of\r\nthe column. It acts as a reservoir to contain any excess of phlegm or to\r\nsupply an additional amount of phlegm to the plates when they have become\r\nnearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe oils or products of the last running accumulate at the base of the\r\ncolumn, and are carried off to their special refrigerator _Q_. The\r\nalcoholic vapors concentrate while rising in the column and quickly\r\nattain a strength of 92∞ or 94∞ F. At a height within the column\r\ncorresponding to the plates whereon alcohol of that strength is to be\r\nfound, there are provided three taps _u_ whereby the middle runnings or\r\nmedium grade of alcohol may be drawn off, which have a maximum\r\nconcentration of 92∞ and 94∞ F. Above these middle plates the alcohol\r\nvapors are completely separated from the products of the \"tail\" that is\r\nthe aldehydes, amylic oils, etc., and at the upper portion of the column\r\nthere is found the condenser _K_ which separates the products of the\r\nhead; that is the first runnings from the alcohol which has passed over\r\nwith such products to the condenser. The alcohol so separated is\r\ncompletely rectified in the column of final purification _D_ and the\r\nfinished alcohol is cooled in the refrigerator _O_ below the column of\r\nfinal condensation. In this apparatus the gauge glasses which regulate\r\nthe exit of the various alcohols and mixtures are controlled by taps\r\nhaving verniers or scales whereby they may be very carefully adjusted, to\r\nregulate the relative proportion of the various products. This apparatus\r\nis able to produce about 75 or 80 per cent. of first-class alcohol, 10 to\r\n15 per cent. of middle class alcohol, and 5 per cent. of ethers and 5 per\r\ncent. of fusel oils, the alcohol produced being about 96∞ Cartier.\r\n\r\nThe alcohol is thus obtained in one single operation and with, it is\r\nasserted, only a very small loss in rectification. The apparatus is\r\nclaimed to be so simple that it may be operated even by unskilled farm\r\nlabor. It is also claimed that purification by chemical treatment or\r\nfiltration is unnecessary with the Guillaume apparatus. It may be stated,\r\nhowever, that the Guillaume system has many opponents.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the rectifying apparatus has a good deal of influence\r\nupon both the quantity and the quality of the spirit obtained. Besides\r\nbeing much more difficult to manage, a small apparatus will not yield so\r\nlarge a proportion of spirit as a more capacious one, nor will its\r\nproducts be of equally good flavor. The proportion of alcohol which may\r\nbe obtained from a successful rectification is very variable; it depends\r\nupon the nature of the spirit rectified, the method of extracting the\r\nsugar, and the manner of conducting the distillation; it will also be in\r\ninverse proportion to the quantity of fusel-oil contained in the raw\r\nspirit. The average loss of pure alcohol during the process of\r\nrectification is generally estimated at about five per cent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rectifying as above described, alcohol may be further\r\npurified by filtration through charcoal, by chemical means or by\r\nelectrolysis. The last two methods have not so far been successful. The\r\nchemicals used merely act to disguise the disagreeable taste or smell of\r\nthe spirit and do not really purify. They but substitute one impurity for\r\nanother. The agents used are many--sulphuric and nitrate acids, soaps,\r\noils and fats soda, lime and potash have each and all been tried, but\r\nwith no permanent success. As agents for disguising the taste of new and\r\nraw spirits, alcoholic extracts of fruits have also been used.\r\n\r\nPurification and aging by electricity has been tried many times and in\r\nmany different forms, but so far has not been commercially practicable.\r\n\r\nFiltration still remains the best and simplest adjunct to the rectifier.\r\nIn small plants, a filter bed several feet in thickness of bone black\r\nor beachwood or charcoal is used, laid upon a foundation of gravel in a\r\nfiltering tank. In the larger plants a series of these vats is used, the\r\ncharcoal being used in lumps varying from 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\nTwo different views of the purification by charcoal are held--one that\r\nthe charcoal purifies by chemical means, the other that it is purely a\r\nphysical filtration agent. After filtration the charcoal must be steamed\r\nto recover the spirits retained therein and should be heated to a red\r\nheat every now and then to cleanse and regenerate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                                MALTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat, oats, rye, potatoes, and other amalyceous or starchy materials\r\ncontain starch insoluble in water and to render it soluble, and to change\r\nthe starch to maltose they must be mashed with a certain small proportion\r\nof malt,--or grain in which germination has been artificially induced and\r\nthen interrupted at a certain stage. This increases the diastase\r\ncontained in the grain so germinated, and this diastase is able to\r\ntransform starch into soluble form. Hence, malted grain gives lightness\r\nand liquidity to the wash, and prevents the starch falling to the bottom\r\nof the mash tub or \"back,\" and also prevents the starch falling to the\r\nbottom of the still and consequent burning.\r\n\r\nWhile all varieties of grain including rice are suitable for the\r\npreparation of malt, barley is preferred to all others, and is most\r\ncommonly used.\r\n\r\n=The best barley= for malting is that having the following\r\ncharacteristics; a thin skin; a mealy interior; grains of a uniform size;\r\nof the greatest weight; which has been stored for three months. Barley on\r\nharvesting has but slight germinating power. The reason for the\r\nuniformity in the grains lies in necessity of a uniform steeping of the\r\ngrain so that the period of germination shall be the same for the whole\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nLike all materials for distillation, the barley should be thoroughly\r\ncleaned of impurities--not only dust, seeds and weeds, but fungi and\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nThis may be partly accomplished in the ordinary fanning mills, usual on\r\nfarms, but a better machine would be a \"tumbling box\" of wire mesh. This\r\nis inclined, so that grain put in the upper end, will pass downward to\r\nthe lower, being thrown about as the box or cylinder is rotated. The\r\ndust, seeds, etc., fall through the meshes of the wire as do the smaller\r\ngrains. After this cleaning, the barley should be thoroughly washed. This\r\nmay be either done in the steeping vat itself--and the water afterwards\r\ndrawn off--or in special machines. If the barley be allowed to soak in\r\nwater for a day or two, the later washing will completely cleanse it.\r\nThis preliminary cleaning is most important as impurities reduce the\r\ngerminating power of the grain, as well as introduce bacteria inimical to\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nWashing in some instances is done by forcing compressed air into the\r\nsteeping tub, thus violently agitating and swirling the water therein,\r\nand washing away the impurities. Another method is by passing the steeped\r\ngrains along a trough supplied with moving water, the trough being\r\nprovided with rotary agitators. Any fairly ingenious mechanic could\r\ndevise a capable cleansing machine. Care being taken that it shall not\r\ninjure the grains.\r\n\r\nAfter cleansing, the barley should be steeped. For this purpose tanks of\r\nmetal or cement are to be preferred to wood. All vats should be kept\r\nthoroughly cleaned by frequent scrubbing with lime water.\r\n\r\nThe barley placed therein should at all times be entirely covered with\r\nfresh water to a depth of a few inches, and for the first few hours the\r\ngrains should be carefully stirred in order that no grain should escape\r\nwetting. At the end of that time the still floating grains should be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn 36 or 48 hours the grain will usually be sufficiently steeped,--but\r\nthis varies with weather conditions. The warmer the water the quicker the\r\nsteeping, and in winter proper steeping may not be accomplished before\r\nfour or five days.\r\n\r\nA simple test is to rub the grain strongly between the hands, If it is\r\nentirely crushed, and no solid matter is left it has been steeped\r\nsufficiently. Barley should be capable of compression lengthwise and the\r\nhull should become easily detached. It should be easily bitten, and not\r\ncrack under the teeth. In order to prevent fermentation in summer, it is\r\nwell to renew the water a few times during steeping. Over steeping is\r\nworse than under steeping.\r\n\r\nAfter the barley is in proper condition the vat or tank is opened and the\r\nwater drained away. The draining should be complete, and therefore the\r\ngrain should be left to drain about 12 hours.\r\n\r\n=Germinating.= The grain is now taken to the malting floor. In practice\r\nit is well to locate the steeping vat above the malting floor, so that\r\nthe steeped grain may be run down on to the floor without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt is best to first spread the grains out on the floor to a depth of a\r\nfew inches in order that it may somewhat dry out. This is not necessary\r\nwhen it has not been steeped to a great extent.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 or 12 hours of drying, the grain is placed in a heap until warm\r\nto the touch, which may occur in from 12 to 24 hours. It is then disposed\r\nin a layer from eight inches to 20 inches thick. This is called the \"wet\r\ncouch.\" The lower the temperature the thicker the couch should be. It\r\nshould be turned every six or eight hours in this stage.\r\n\r\nThe heat so germinated after 25 or 30 hours produces at the end of each\r\ngrain a small white rootlet. The grain in the middle of the layer is the\r\nfirst to sprout, as it is the warmest, hence the couched grain should be\r\nfrequently turned so as to give all the grains a uniform heat, and a\r\nuniform germination. At this period the grains beneath the surface are\r\ndampish to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe height of the couch is now successively lessened to layers of from\r\nsix to two inches called \"floors,\" the height of each floor of course\r\ndepending on the temperature, as before.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that the growing grain requires both dampness and\r\nair, hence the \"floor\" should not be thinned so rapidly as to deprive it\r\nof moisture, and the barley should be turned at least twice a day to give\r\neach grain a proper aeration. During this period the small white rootlets\r\nor radicals should be white and shiny. If they begin to fade, it is a\r\nsign that they lack water and the grain should be sprinkled. Germination\r\nusually requires from a week to ten days, or sometimes two weeks,\r\ndepending on the previous steeping, the quality of the grain and the\r\ntemperature. When the fibers or rootlets of the grain are about equal to\r\nthe length of the grain, germination is complete.\r\n\r\nIt used to be considered that malt was in its best condition in eight or\r\nten days. To-day, however, \"long malt\" is used,--requiring a germinating\r\nperiod of twenty days, being frequently moistened and turned during this\r\ntime, and the temperature being kept at 65∞ F. This malt is very strong\r\nin diastase.\r\n\r\nThe effect of germination is to produce a change particularly favorable\r\nto mashing. The barley becomes sweetish, the gluten is partially\r\ndestroyed and what is left is soluble. Thus the fecula or starch is set\r\nat liberty and free to be acted on by the yeast used in fermenting.\r\n\r\nMarch is the best month in which to malt; and while the malt is best used\r\nimmediately, it can not be kept in its green state and must be therefore\r\ndried for future use.\r\n\r\n=Drying.= This is accomplished either in the air of a warm, dry room in\r\nhot weather, or by means of a drying kiln. In the first process the malt\r\nis spread in a thin layer and frequently turned. In the second the grain\r\nis spread out in a layer from eight inches to a foot thick on the grain\r\nfloor of the kiln.\r\n\r\nBeneath the grain floor a fire is maintained. In the beginning the\r\ntemperature of the drying floor should be about 85∞ F., but this is\r\nincreased gradually to about 104∞ F. until most of the moisture has been\r\nremoved. The heat is then raised to from 120∞ F. to 130∞ F., thus\r\ncompletely drying the grain.\r\n\r\nThe germinated green or dried barley is called malt. It is of good\r\nquality when the grain is round and flowery; when it crumbles easily and\r\nwhen its taste is sweetish and agreeable. Pale malt or that which has\r\nbeen hardly altered from its original color is the best for distillation.\r\n\r\nBefore the malt can be used it should be screened so as to remove the\r\nrootlets.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and twenty lbs. of barley should yield from 275 to 350 lbs.\r\nof green malt, about 200 lbs. of air dried malt, and from 175 to 190 lbs.\r\nof kiln dried malt.\r\n\r\nIn large plants malting is now so carried on that the steeping\r\ngermination and drying are all accomplished in one vessel or container,\r\nby one continuous operation. This vessel is commonly in the form of a\r\ndrum of sheet iron, revolving at a very slow speed. Moist air is\r\nintroduced and the carbonic acid laden air withdrawn. After germination\r\nthe malt is dried by passing in dry air at the proper temperature.\r\n\r\nAs these systems are only adopted to large distilleries, using expensive\r\nmachinery, further reference to them is not considered necessary in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nPrevious to use the malt must be finely ground or crushed either before\r\nor after mixing with the materials to be mashed. It is not necessary or\r\nadvisable that the malt be reduced to flour. The use of malt with other\r\nmaterials in order to form a fermentible mash, will be considered in the\r\nchapters on specific mashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                         ALCOHOL FROM POTATOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn certain countries, as for instance Germany and France, potatoes form\r\nthe greatest source of alcohol, particularly for industrial purposes.\r\nWith the possible exception of corn and beets they will probably be most\r\nused in America.\r\n\r\nThe best potatoes for distilling are those which are most farinaceous\r\nwhen boiled. In other words, those which are \"mealy\" and most appetizing.\r\nThese give the largest yield of alcohol per bushel. The best season of\r\nthe year in which to use potatoes is from October to March, when they\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes should be kept in dry cellars, and at even temperatures,\r\nwarm enough to prevent freezing and yet not so warm that they will rot or\r\nsprout. Diseased potatoes may however be used, if they have not been\r\nattacked by dry rot, though they are not so easily worked. Frosted\r\npotatoes may be also used, but they must not have been completely frozen.\r\n\r\nBefore being steamed, the potatoes should be washed, either by hand or by\r\na machine, care being taken to remove all stones, clods of earth, and\r\nother foreign substances which might impede the subsequent operations.\r\n\r\nThere are three main methods of saccharifying the fecula or starch of the\r\npotato. The first and most important by reducing the tubers to a pulp,\r\nand malting the entire mass. The second and third, by rasping the\r\npotatoes and so separating the fecula or starch grains from the mass, and\r\nthen making a thin liquor or wash containing this fecula.\r\n\r\nOriginally, in the first process, the washed potatoes were submitted to\r\nthe action of boiling water, but later cooking by steam at a temperature\r\nof 212∞ F. was used, as being much more convenient to handle and more\r\neffective in action. The object of steaming is to break the coating and\r\nreduce the contents thereof to a pasty condition, wherein the starch is\r\nmore effectively acted on by the malt and yeast. Ordinary steaming does\r\nnot, however, render the pulp sufficiently pasty; some of the starch\r\nremains undissolved and is lost, hence in the modern practice, steam is\r\nturned into the steaming vat under a pressure of three or four atmosphere\r\n(45 to 60 lbs. to the square inch).\r\n\r\nHigh pressure steaming will be later described but the simple and older\r\nmethod of mashing and apparatus therefor, used prior to 1870, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFig. 41 shows a section of a steaming vat. This consists of a conical\r\nwooden tub _H_ provided at its top with a suitable cover _O_ having a\r\ntrap or door _P_ for putting in the potatoes. This as shown, consists of\r\na hinged lid, having a button _p_ or other fastening means. This lid and\r\ncover should be of course steam tight, and it would be better to have it\r\nclamped down by a screw clamp than held by a button.\r\n\r\nSomewhat above the bottom of the vat, a steam inlet pipe _I_ enters,\r\nconnected at its other end by a coupling _i_ with a suitable steam\r\ngenerator (see Fig. 43), Preferably the outlet of this pipe is screened\r\nby a perforated plate _M_ so that it may not be clogged by the pulp. It\r\nis also best that a filling piece be placed at the junction of the bottom\r\nwith the sides in order that there be no sharp corner from which the pulp\r\nmay not be easily cleaned out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Steaming Vat for Potatoes.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the vat may either have a discharge door at the side as in\r\nFig. 44 or at the bottom, as in Fig. 41.\r\n\r\nAn under side view of the latter construction is shown in Fig. 42. The\r\nbottom of the vat is made in two parts or doors _J K_. These are held\r\nclosed by a transverse bar _L_ inserted at its end into a stirrup _l¥_\r\nand supported at its other end by a button _l_, or other means.\r\n\r\nWhile various forms of steam generators may be used, Fig. 43 shows a\r\nsimple construction well adapted to the needs of a small distillery. _D_\r\ndesignates the brick work of a furnace, and _A_ the boiler. This is so\r\nset that an annular space _E_ surrounds the sides of the boiler, through\r\nwhich the products of combustion must pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Bottom of Steaming Vat.]\r\n\r\nThe head of the boiler is connected by a pipe _B_ and collar _b_ to the\r\nsteam inlet pipe _I_ of the steaming vat, heretofore described, as by the\r\ncollars _b i_.\r\n\r\nA filling tube _C_ enters the boiler and projects nearly to the bottom,\r\nand the water outlet-pipe _F_ with cock _f_ leads off from the upper\r\nwater line. The tube _C_ forms also a safety valve, for if the steam\r\npressure becomes too great in the boiler and connected vat, it will force\r\nwater up and out through the tube. If, however, the water falls below the\r\nlevel of the lower end of the tube, steam will issue and warn the\r\nattendant that water is too low. It would be best however, to provide a\r\nsteam gauge, whereby the pressure of steam in the boiler and vat could be\r\naccurately indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Steam Generator.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that when steamed the potatoes will swell and occupy\r\nmore space and that the steam vat should therefore not be much more than\r\ntwo-thirds filled with potatoes.\r\n\r\nWith the steaming vat above shown, the potatoes are delivered mixed with\r\na considerable quantity of water, but a better plan is to have a\r\nperforated false bottom to the tub, whereby the condensed water may be\r\ncarried away, the steamed potatoes remaining behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Potato Steamer and Crusher.]\r\n\r\nTwo hours of steaming should reduce the potatoes to proper condition,\r\nwhich may be tested by introducing a pointed iron rod through a suitable\r\naperture, normally kept closed. If the rod passes freely inward, the\r\npotatoes are done and may be discharged into the crusher, shown in Fig.\r\n44. In this Fig. the steaming vat _A_ is shown mounted above the crusher.\r\nA pipe _B_ with cock _b_ leads to the steam generator. The steamed\r\npotatoes are shoveled out through the door _a_, which is usually held\r\nclosed by means of the clamps or buttons _a¥ a¥¥_.\r\n\r\n=The crusher= consists of a hopper _C_ whose bottom fits closely against\r\ntwo adjacent smooth faced rolls _H I_ of iron. These are driven by gears\r\n_D E_. The shafts of these gears have cranks _d d_ whereby it may be\r\noperated. These gears are unequal so that the rolls shall move at\r\ndifferent speeds, and thus one will have a grinding action against the\r\nface of the other. A counter weighted scraper _e_ bears against the face\r\nof the roll.\r\n\r\nThe crushed potato pulp passes between the rolls and into a bin beneath,\r\nhaving adjustable walls made of boards _F_, sliding in suitable guides\r\n_f_, from which the pulp may be shoveled into the mashing tank or \"back.\"\r\nThe crusher might, however, be arranged to deliver immediately into the\r\nmashing tank, if the latter is provided with means for stirring the\r\ndelivered pulp.\r\n\r\nThe pulp or paste thus made is now placed in a vat, holding about 650 to\r\n850 gals., in which the saccharification takes place. About 2200 lbs. of\r\nthe crushed potatoes and 155 lbs of broken malt are introduced, and\r\nimmediately afterwards water is run in at a temperature of about 97∞ F.\r\nto 104∞ F., the contents being well stirred with a fork meanwhile. The\r\nvat is then carefully closed for half an hour, after which boiling water\r\nis added until the temperature reaches 140∞ F., when the whole is left\r\nfor three or four hours. The process of fermentation is conducted in the\r\nsame vat. Alternate doses of cold and boiling water are run in upon the\r\nmixture, until the quantity is made up to 700 or 775 gallons, according\r\nto the size of the vat, and so as finally to bring the temperature to 75∞\r\nF. or 79∞ F. Five and a half to six gallons of liquid brewer's yeast are\r\nthen added, and fermentation speedily sets in. This process complete, the\r\nfermented pulp is distilled in the apparatus devised by\r\nCellier-Blumenthal (see Fig. 15) for distilling materials of a pasty\r\nnature; the product has a very unpleasant odor and taste.\r\n\r\nThe process above described is the old method of pulping the potatoes by\r\nusing steam. Under the modern method, however, and with modern apparatus,\r\nin preparing potatoes for distillation in large quantities, the steaming\r\nof the material is accomplished at one time and under a high steam\r\npressure. The apparatus is also used for the preparation of corn,\r\npotatoes and other starch-containing substances.\r\n\r\nThere are many apparatuses which have been devised for the purpose, but\r\nthe principle on which they work is practically the same in all cases.\r\nThey comprise a closed tank, fitted with stirrers, agitators, or other\r\nmeans for mixing and comminuting the contents, means for admitting steam\r\nunder pressure, means for cooling the mixture to the proper mashing\r\ntemperatures, and means for forcing the steamed material out of the tank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Bohn's Steamer and Crusher.]\r\n\r\n=The Steamer.= One of the earliest forms of steamer was that of\r\nHallefreund devised in 1871, and adapted for working on a large scale. A\r\nmodified form of the apparatus known as Bohn's steamer and masher is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 45. This comprises a steaming cylinder _A_, having a\r\nsecurely closed opening _D_ for the introduction of the potatoes.\r\nCentrally through the cylinder passes a hollow shaft _B_, which is\r\nrotated by the power pulley _K_. Hollow arms _b_ project radially from\r\nthe shaft _B_. These act as mixers of the mash and as coolers. The shaft\r\n_B_ at one end is connected to a cold water supply pipe _M_ as by a\r\ncoupling _C_, the supply pipe being provided with a cock. _E_ designates\r\na discharge opening for the mash. A pipe _F_ provides for the entrance of\r\nsteam into the cylinder. _G_ is a pipe through which malt is put in to be\r\nmixed with the pulp. _L_ is a steam gauge and _J_ a safety valve. _H_\r\ndesignates a water pipe. For the relation of the steamer to other\r\napparatus, see Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nIn operation the potatoes are placed in the cylinder _A_ and submitted to\r\nthe action of steam at about 46 lbs. to the square inch, and at a\r\ntemperature of from 266∞ F. to 275∞ F.\r\n\r\nWhen disintegrated, the steam is blown off, and the potatoes crushed by\r\nrotating the stirring shaft. As the pulp must be reduced from 275∞ F. to\r\n149∞ F., the mashing temperature, cold water is forced into the stirrer\r\nwhich chills the blades and quickly cools the mass.\r\n\r\nIn the vacuum mash cooker shown in Fig. 1, the steaming cylinder is\r\npartly filled with hot water at 140∞ F. to 150∞ F. The potatoes to be\r\nmashed are fed into the cylinder whole. The steamer is then closed and\r\nsteam admitted while the mash is stirred until a pressure of 65 pounds is\r\nreached, when the dissolution of the starch is complete. The steam is\r\nthen exhausted and the temperature reduced to 212∞ F. To reduce this\r\ntemperature to the proper saccharifying point of 145∞ F., the hot air is\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nBarley malt meal in the proportion of 6 to 10 per cent. is used. This has\r\nbeen previously mixed with cold water in the small grain masher. The malt\r\nis admitted to the cylinder and thoroughly mixed with the potato, when\r\nthe mixture is withdrawn into a drop tub, where it is still further\r\nstirred. It is then cooled as described on page 15 and then fermented.\r\n\r\nWhile the crushed potatoes are being cooled and stirred, a mixture of\r\ngreen malt with water is prepared in an adjacent vat, and when the pulp\r\nin the cylinder has been reduced to 149∞ F. the malt mixture is\r\nintroduced into the cylinder through the pipe _G_, and thoroughly mixed\r\nwith the crushed potatoes. The mass is now left to saccharify; the\r\nstirrer being operated at intervals throughout this period. This machine\r\nmight be readily modified so that the steam should enter through the\r\nstirrers, by tubes attached to the arms, then the steam may be shut off\r\nand cold water sent into the arms themselves to cool the mash.\r\n\r\nA variety of steamer used in various forms and modifications in all the\r\nlarger distilleries, is known as the Henze steamer, Fig. 2. In this,\r\nthere are no stirrers. The cylinder is conical, and has steam pipes\r\nleading to the interior. At the end of its cone-shaped bottom it\r\nterminates in a blow-off tube, having in it a grate formed of sharp-edged\r\nbars. In operation, steam is introduced at a pressure of one to two\r\natmospheres until the potatoes are cooked. More steam is then suddenly\r\nadmitted at high pressure and the softened potatoes forced through the\r\ngrating at the bottom and into the mashing apparatus in a finely divided\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nIn steaming under pressure it is best that the safety valve be so\r\nregulated that the steam will constantly blow off as this action keeps\r\nthe potatoes in motion and facilitates disintegration. Care should also\r\nbe taken to see that everything about the apparatus is in good condition,\r\nas in working under the high pressures used in the last apparatus there\r\nis liability of explosion. Rust should be particularly guarded against.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus a preparatory mash vat is used into which the\r\ncontents of the steamers are blown out, malt and water to form milk\r\nhaving been previously let into the mash vat. Blowing out is accomplished\r\nin 45 or 50 minutes at 130∞ F. and about one-sixth of the charge in the\r\nsteamer is retained in the steamer. The mash in the vat is stirred and\r\ncooled and the remainder of the mash blown in raising the temperature to\r\n145∞ F. when the mash is left to stand from half an hour to an hour. With\r\nheavy mashes, rich in sugar, even higher temperatures than 145∞ F. can be\r\nused for saccharifying.\r\n\r\nThe processes of crushing and saccharifying, above referred to, which are\r\nalmost entirely used to-day, require steam. The following methods provide\r\nfor the isolation of the fecula or starch, without steam and the\r\nproduction of a wash of a more watery consistency, therefore easier to\r\nhandle in ordinary stills, and with less liability to burn.\r\n\r\nTwo operations are necessary by this method: First, rasping, or reducing\r\nthe potatoes to a finely crushed and pulpy condition by means of a\r\nmachine described in the chapter on Beet Mashing; and second, the\r\nseparation of the fecula.\r\n\r\nTo this latter end the potato pulp is placed on a sieve, having side\r\nwalls and net work of horse-hair, which is placed over a suitable tub.\r\nWater is run gradually through the pulp and sieve, while the pulp is\r\nrubbed up by hand. When the water comes through clear, then all the\r\nfecula of the pulp has been washed out, and the refuse left in the sieve\r\ncan be thrown aside or used as a food for cattle.\r\n\r\n=For a mashing tub= of say about 32 bushels capacity, the fecula from\r\nabout 800 lbs. of potatoes is used. This is deposited in the mash tub\r\nwith sufficient cold water to form a fairly clear paste. About twice as\r\nmuch water as fecula will bring the paste to proper consistency. This\r\nmixture should be constantly stirred as otherwise the fecula will sink to\r\nthe bottom. About 40 gallons of boiling water are then added gradually.\r\nThe mixture has at first a milky appearance, but at the last becomes\r\nentirely clear.\r\n\r\nThis liquid is mashed with about 45 lbs. of malted barley or Indian corn,\r\nground into coarse flour. In ten minutes the mixture will be completely\r\nfluidified. It is then left to subside for three or four hours when it\r\nwill have acquired a sweetish taste and be what is termed as \"sweet\r\nmash.\" The fluid is then further diluted by the addition of sufficient\r\nwater to give about 290 gallons of wash. Two or three pints of good yeast\r\nwill bring this mixture to a ferment.\r\n\r\nA less laborious method of accomplishing the same result is that at one\r\ntime used in English distilleries. In this a double bottom tub is used,\r\nsomething like that shown in Fig. 41, the upper bottom of which is\r\nperforated, and raised above the solid lower bottom. A draw-off cock\r\nopens out from the space between the two bottoms.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the tub is of 220 gallons capacity, then from 2 to 20 lbs.\r\nof chaff are spread over the perforated bottom and pulp from 800 lbs. of\r\nraw potatoes placed on that. This is thoroughly drained for half an hour,\r\nthrough the draw-off cock. The pulp is then stirred while from 90 to 100\r\ngallons of boiling water are added gradually. The mass then thickens into\r\na paste. The paste is mashed with about 65 lbs. of well steeped malt,\r\nand the liquid left to subside for three or four hours. It is then\r\ndrained off through the perforated bottom into a fermenting back or tub.\r\nFor this amount of material the back should be of about 300 gallons\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n=The leavings= left in the preparatory tub still contain considerable\r\nstarch, and after they are well drained they should be mixed with from 50\r\nto 55 gallons of boiling water. The mixture is then agitated and drained\r\noff into the fermenting back. The sediment left is again sprinkled with\r\nwater, this time cold, which is drained off into the back. This\r\ncompletely exhausts the husks left on the upper bottom. By this process\r\n200 lbs. of potatoes should produce something over 12-1/2 gallons of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the last method described is that the spirit so obtained\r\nis unpleasant to taste and smell, but this would probably not be an\r\nobjection for industrial uses.\r\n\r\nThe only means of obtaining alcohol of good quality from potatoes is to\r\nextract the starch separately and then convert it into sugar. This\r\nsaccharification of the starch may be accomplished by sulphuric acid or\r\nby the action of diastase.\r\n\r\nBy the first of these methods the potatoes are disintegrated in such an\r\napparatus as the Bohn steamer described on page 118. A mixture is made of\r\none-third potatoes, two-thirds water, and onetenth part of sulphuric\r\nacid. The mixture is steamed for six or eight hours under pressure. The\r\nmash is then cooled and the acid neutralized by milk of lime. It is then\r\nfermented.\r\n\r\nBy the second and preferable method, dry or wet potato starch is used,\r\nwhich is malted, and the saccharine solution fermented with yeast. The\r\nproportions and method for a vat of say 800 gallons capacity are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and sixty-five gallons of water are mixed with 1100 lbs. of\r\ndry or 1650 lbs. of moist starch. This mixture is well agitated, and 450\r\ngallons of boiling water run in, together with 165 lbs. of malt. The\r\nwhole is then stirred energetically and left to saccharify for three or\r\nfour hours. The saccharine solution thus formed must be brought to 6∞ or\r\n7∞ Baume, at a temperature of from 71∞ to 75∞ F. To this is then added\r\n1-1/100 lbs. of dry yeast for every 220 gallons of \"must.\" Fermentation\r\nis soon established and usually occupies about 36 hours. After remaining\r\nat rest for 24 hours the \"must\" is distilled. From each 220 lbs. of\r\nstarch there should be a yield of about nine gallons of alcohol,\r\nat 90∞ F.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation of the potato mash is carried on as described in Chapter\r\nII. For the preparation of malt see Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n       ALCOHOL FROM GRAIN--CORN, WHEAT, RICE, AND OTHER CEREALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different cereals constitute a very important source of alcohol in\r\nall countries, particularly of course for use in the manufacture of\r\nwhiskey and gin.\r\n\r\nAll cereals contain an abundance of starchy substance which under the\r\ninfluence of diastase,--that is, malt,--is converted into fermentible\r\nsugar. The quantity of sugar and hence the yield of alcohol differs\r\nwidely. The following table shows the results obtainable by good\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\n          220 lbs. Wheat         gives 7.0  gallons pure alcohol\r\n           \"   \"   Rye             \"   6.16    \"     \"      \"\r\n           \"   \"   Barley          \"   5.5     \"     \"      \"\r\n           \"   \"   Oats            \"   4.8     \"     \"      \"\r\n           \"   \"   Buckwheat       \"   5.5     \"     \"      \"\r\n           \"   \"   Corn (Indian)   \"   5.5     \"     \"      \"\r\n           \"   \"   Rice            \"   7.7     \"     \"      \"\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there are other raw materials containing starch\r\nwhich are sometimes used, as millet (55 per cent starch), chestnuts (28\r\nper cent.), and horse chestnuts (40 per cent.). The last is very\r\ndifficult to work however.\r\n\r\nRice, wheat, rye, barley and corn are more frequently employed than other\r\ngrains. Wheat gives a malt which is as rich in diastase as barley. Barley\r\nand buckwheat are added to these in some proportions. Oats, owing to\r\ntheir high price, are rarely used. Rice, of all the grain is the most\r\nproductive to the distillers, but on account of its value as a food is\r\nnot much used for the production of alcohol, unless damaged. Corn is the\r\ncereal most largely used for the production of industrial alcohol.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised in making choice of grain for fermentation\r\nwhere the best results are desired. Wheat should be farinaceous, heavy\r\nand dry. Barley should be free from chaff, quite fresh and in large\r\nuniform grains of a bright color (see Malting, Chapter VI).\r\n\r\nRice should be dull white in color, slightly transparent, without odor,\r\nand of a fresh, farinaceous taste.\r\n\r\nThe flour or farinaceous part of grain is composed of starch, gluten,\r\nalbumen, mucilage, and some sugar. The following table gives the\r\nproportions of these substances in the commonest grains.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions the albumen or gluten in the grain has the power\r\nof converting starch into saccharine matter. This is better effected by\r\nan acid such as sulphuric acid, or by a diastase. This latter substance\r\nis a principle developed during the germination of all cereals but\r\nespecially of barley. It has the property of reacting upon starchy\r\nmatters, converting them first into a gummy substance called dextrine,\r\nand then into glucose or grape sugar, see Chapter II.\r\n\r\nThe action of diastase upon starch or flour made into a paste is\r\nremarkable, 50 grains of diastase being sufficient to convert 220 lbs.\r\n(100 kilogrammes) of starch into glucose. The rapidity of this change\r\ndepends on the quantity of water employed, and the degree of heat\r\nadopted in the operation.\r\n\r\n                               TABLE IV.\r\n\r\n       PROPORTIONS OF STARCH, GLUTEN, ETC., IN PRINCIPAL GRAINS.\r\n\r\n      Column A = Grains.\r\n      Column B = Starch.\r\n      Column C = Gluten and other Azotized Substances.\r\n      Column D = Detrine, Glucose and similar Substances.\r\n      Column E = Fatty Matter.\r\n      Column F = Cellulose.\r\n      Column G = Inorganic Salts.

Barley germinated according to\r\nproper methods is called malt, and its preparation is fully described in\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nThere are many methods of preparing grain for fermentation, but all use\r\nat least two of the following operations:--grinding, gelatinizing,\r\nsteeping, or steaming, mashing saccharifying.\r\n\r\n=Grinding.= Where cookers or the Henze steamers are not used every form\r\nof grain should be crushed or ground into a coarse flour. This is in\r\norder that the starchy interior may be easily acted on by the diastase.\r\nIf the grain is not to be mixed with malt later it must be ground more\r\nfinely so that it may be thoroughly penetrated by the water. The grains\r\nshould not be ground except as required, as ground grain is liable to\r\nheating and consequent loss of fermentability, and is also liable to\r\nbecome musty, in which condition it loses much of its fermentability.\r\n\r\n=Steeping.= This operation is best carried on in vats or tanks of iron or\r\ncement, for the reason that wood absorbs impurities, which are\r\ncommunicated to the grain, thus lessening its germinative power. Wooden\r\nvats should be thoroughly scrubbed after use, and be kept continually\r\nwhitewashed. The steeping tub should hold about two-thirds more than the\r\namount of ground grain to be steeped.\r\n\r\nSteeping is affected by pouring on to the crushed grain hot and cold\r\nwater in such quantity that after 10 minutes or so of brewing the mixture\r\nwill have a temperature of 75∞ to 95∞ F.\r\n\r\nThis warmth makes the water more penetrating. The water should not be\r\npoured in all at once, but a little at a time, until the grain is covered\r\nto a depth of three or four inches. Care should be taken not to let the\r\ntemperature get too high, not above 95∞ F., as a temperature above that\r\npoint kills the germinating power.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of crushed grain and water is now stirred for 10 minutes and\r\nthen left to subside for half an hour. It is then stirred again and the\r\nmixture left to steep for 30 or 40 hours, depending on the temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere, the dryness of the grain, and the character of the water.\r\nIn very warm weather the water should be changed every few hours by\r\nrunning it off through a hole in the bottom of the tub and running in\r\nfresh at the top. This prevents fermentation setting in prematurely.\r\n\r\nWhen the grain swells, and yields readily between the fingers it has been\r\nsufficiently steeped, and the water is run off. This is an old method of\r\ngelatinizing grain, but a better is by the use of cookers or high\r\npressure steamers as described for potatoes.\r\n\r\n=Mashing.= This consists in mixing the coarse flour with malt and then by\r\nmeans of certain operations and mechanisms bringing it to a condition\r\nmost favorable to fermentation through the action of yeast. The mixing of\r\nthe raw flour with barley or other malt effects the conversion of the\r\nstarch of the grain into maltose. The yeast afterwards converts this\r\nmaltose into sugar.\r\n\r\n=Saccharifying.= To effect the action of the diastase of the malt on the\r\ngrain, in the old methods, boiling water must be poured into the vat\r\nuntil the temperature of the mass reaches about 140∞ to 168∞ F., the\r\nwhole being well stirred meanwhile; when this temperature has been\r\nreached, the vat is again covered and left to stand for four hours,\r\nduring which time the temperature should, if possible, be maintained at\r\n140∞ F., and on no account suffered to fall below 122∞ F., in order to\r\navoid the inevitable loss of alcohol consequent upon the acidity always\r\nproduced by so low a temperature. In cold weather the heat should of\r\ncourse be considerably greater than in hot. It should be also remarked\r\nthat the greater the quantity of water employed, the more complete will\r\nbe the saccharification, and the shorter the time occupied by the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nHaving undergone all the above processes, the wash is next drawn from the\r\nmash tub into a cistern, and from this it is pumped into the coolers.\r\nWhen the wash has acquired the correct temperature, viz., from 68∞ to 78∞\r\nF., according to the bulk operated upon, it is run down again into the\r\nfermenting vats situated on the floor beneath. Ten to twelve pints of\r\nliquid or 5-1/2 to 6-1/2]** fraction] lbs. of dry brewer's yeast are then\r\nadded for every 220 lbs. of grain; the vat is securely covered, and the\r\ncontents are left to ferment. The process is complete at the end of four\r\nor five days, and if conducted under favorable conditions there should be\r\na yield of about 6-1/6 gallons of pure alcohol to every 220 lbs. of grain\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different methods of mashing, having each its\r\nadvantages, and applicable to particular varieties of grain.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider the mashing of the steeped grain in general by one\r\nof the older and simpler processes.\r\n\r\nThe grain to be mashed, which has been ground and steeped as before\r\ndescribed, is mixed with malt in the proportion of four to one, or even\r\neight to one. In addition, three or four pounds of chaff to every hundred\r\nor so pounds of steeped grain should be used.\r\n\r\n=Mash.= Water is then run into the mash tub in the proportion of about\r\n600 gallons to each 60 bushels of grain. Its temperature should be\r\nbetween 120∞ and 150∞ F. During the entrance of water, the mass is well\r\nstirred so as to cause the whole of the grain to be thoroughly soaked and\r\nto prevent the formation of lumps. It is best to add the grain to the\r\nwater gradually and to stir thoroughly.\r\n\r\nTo this mass about 400 gallons of boiling water is gradually added to\r\nkeep the temperature at about 145∞ F. During the addition of the boiling\r\nwater the mash should be continually stirred so that the action of the\r\nwater shall be uniform. This operation should last about two and one half\r\nhours. The vat should be then covered and left to stand from\r\nthree-quarters to one hour for saccharification.\r\n\r\nAnother method of saccharifying is to turn boiling water gradually into\r\nthe mash tank until the mixture has acquired a temperature of from 140∞\r\nto 180∞ F. The mass is thoroughly stirred and the tub is covered and left\r\nto subside for from two to four hours, during which time the temperature\r\nshould not be allowed to fall below 120∞ F. A small tub needs more heat\r\nthan a larger tub, and more heat is required in winter than in summer.\r\n\r\nA convenient method of regulating the temperature of the mash tank, would\r\nbe by a coil of pipes on the bottom. This would be connected by a two-way\r\ncock to a steam boiler and to a source of cold water. Heat should never\r\nbe carried over 180∞ F., and the best temperature is from 145∞ to 165∞ F.\r\n\r\nThe greatest effect of the diastase of the malt upon the gelatinized\r\nstarch is at 131∞ F. For ungelatinized starch this is not great enough,\r\nhence the greater part of the mashing is carried on at the lower\r\ntemperature and only towards the end should the temperature be raised to\r\nthe maximum 150∞ F.\r\n\r\nEvery distiller uses his own judgment as to the amount of the mashing\r\nwater used, its temperature, the length of time during which the mash\r\nrests, and the length of time for saccharification.\r\n\r\nSaccharification may be recognized by the following signs: The mash loses\r\nits first white mealy look, and changes to dark brown. It also becomes\r\nthin and easily stirred. The taste is sweet and its odor is like that of\r\nfresh bread.\r\n\r\nCorn and other grain may be mashed conveniently in such an apparatus as\r\nthat described on page 10, as used for potatoes the steam being\r\nintroduced under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe water is first placed in the steamer. Steam is introduced into the\r\nwater and it is brought to a boil. The corn is then introduced gradually,\r\nthe steam pressure increased to its maximum, and the mass blown out as\r\ndescribed in Chapter VII. Hellefreund's apparatus (see page 118) may also\r\nbe used with ground corn.\r\n\r\nThe corn or grain not previously crushed or ground is introduced into a\r\nsteamer in the proportion of 200 lbs. of corn to 40 gallons of water. The\r\nsteamer should have about 100 gallons of steam space for this amount.\r\n\r\nThe mashes described above are thick, more or less troublesome to distil,\r\nand only simple stills can be used. By the following method a clear\r\nsaccharine fluid or wort can be obtained.\r\n\r\n=A mash vat= is used having a double bottom. The upper bottom is\r\nperforated and between the two bottoms is a draw-off pipe and a pipe for\r\nthe inlet of water.\r\n\r\nUpon the upper perforated bottom is first placed a layer of between two\r\nand three pounds of chaff. Upon this is turned in a mixture of 400 lbs.\r\ncorn and malt in the proportions of 1/5 malt to 4/5 grain. Eighty-seven\r\ngallons of water at a temperature of from 85∞ to 105∞ F. is then let in\r\nto the bottom, while the mixture is thoroughly agitated for 10 minutes.\r\nIt is then left to subside for half an hour.\r\n\r\nAfter this steeping process, the mass is again agitated while 175 gallons\r\nof water at 190∞ F. are let into the tub while the mass is continually\r\nand thoroughly stirred by mechanical stirrers. Brewing lasts for half an\r\nhour, and the liquid is then left to stand for seven hours.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period the grain is covered by clear liquid which is\r\ndrained off through the draw-off cock into the fermenting back.\r\n\r\nTo the contents left in the steeping tank 135 gallons of boiling water\r\nare added as before and the liquid therefrom drawn into the fermenting\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIt usually requires three infusions to extract the whole of the\r\nsaccharine and fermentiscible matters contained in the grain. In some\r\nplaces, it is customary to boil down the liquors from the three mashings\r\nuntil they have acquired a specific gravity of about 1.05, the liquor\r\nfrom a fourth mashing being used to bring the whole to the correct degree\r\nfor fermentation, the liquors from the third and fourth being boiled down\r\nto the same density and then added to the rest. In a large Glasgow\r\ndistillery, the charge for the mash tubs is 29,120 lbs. of grain together\r\nwith the proper proportion of malt. Two mashings are employed, about\r\n28,300 gallons of water being required; the first mashing has a\r\ntemperature of 140∞ F., and the second that of 176∞ F. In Dublin the\r\nproportion of malt employed is only about one-eighth of the entire\r\ncharge. One mashing is employed, and the temperature of the water is kept\r\nat about 143∞ F. The subsequent mashings are kept for the next day's\r\nbrewing.\r\n\r\nBy this process the grain is entirely deprived of all fermentible\r\nsubstances which have been carried away in a state of liquid sugar.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation of preparing and saccharifying grain is to-day\r\ncarried on in steamers, such as described on page 11, and cooking\r\napparatus such as shown in Fig. 1, or in the Henze high pressure steamers\r\nand preparatory mash vats described in Chapter II.\r\n\r\nIn steaming grain without pressure, the finely crushed grain is poured\r\nslowly into a vat previously nearly filled with water at a temperature of\r\nabout 140 degrees F. A little less than half a gallon of water is used\r\nfor each pound of grain. Care must be taken to stir the mass constantly\r\nto prevent lumping. When all the corn is mixed in, steam is allowed to\r\nenter and the temperature raised to about 200 degrees F. It should be\r\nleft at this temperature for an hour, or an hour and a half, when the\r\ntemperature is reduced to 140∞ F. when about 10 per cent. of crushed malt\r\nis added and the temperature reduced to 68∞ F. by means of suitable\r\ncooling devices.\r\n\r\nWhen steam cookers are used, the cylindrical boiler is first filled to\r\nthe proper degree with water at a temperature of 140∞ F. The meal is then\r\nlet in gradually being constantly stirred the while. The boiler is then\r\nclosed and steam gradually let in while the mass is stirred until a\r\npressure of 60 pounds and a temperature of 300∞ F. has been reached. The\r\nstarch then becomes entirely gelatinized, the pressure is relieved, and\r\nthe temperature reduced to 212∞ F. and then rapidly brought to 145∞ F.\r\nThe malt is added mixed with cold water, at such a stage before the\r\nsaccharifying temperature is reached that the cold malt and water will\r\nbring it to 145∞ F. The malt is stirred and mixed with the mash for five\r\nor ten minutes and the mixed mass let into a drop tub when\r\nsaccharification is completed. It is then cooled as described.\r\n\r\nWhen the Henze steamers are used the grain may be treated in either the\r\nwhole grain or crushed, as the high pressure to which it is subjected and\r\nthe \"blowing out\" act to entirely disintegrate it. In this mode of\r\noperation, water is first let into the steamer and brought to a boil by\r\nthe admission of steam. The grain is then slowly let into the apparatus.\r\nThe water and grain should fill the steamer about two thirds full. The\r\nsteamer is left open and steam circulated through the grain and water\r\nfor about an hour, but without any raising of pressure. This acts to\r\nthoroughly cook and soften the grain.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently softened the steam escape cock in the upper part of the\r\nsteamer (see Fig. 2) is regulated to allow a partial flow of steam\r\nthrough it and a greater flow of steam is admitted through the lower\r\ninlet. This keeps the grain in constant ebullition under a pressure of 30\r\nlbs. or so. After another period of an hour the pressure in the steamer\r\nis raised to 60 lbs. at which point it is kept for half an hour, when the\r\nmaximum steam pressure is applied, and the greater portion of the\r\ndisintegrated mass blown out into a preparatory mass tub, into which malt\r\nhas been placed mixed with water. The blowing out should be so performed\r\nthat the temperature in the mass in the tubs shall not exceed 130∞ F. The\r\nmass is stirred and cooled and then the remainder of the mass in the\r\nsteamer admitted to the tub which should bring the temperature of the\r\nmass up to 145∞ F. It is kept at this temperature for a period varying\r\nfrom half an hour to one and one-half hours and is then cooled to the\r\nproper fermenting temperature.\r\n\r\nAnother method of softening corn so that its starch is easily acted upon\r\nby the diastase of the malt is to steep it in a sulphurous acid solution\r\nat a temperature of about 120∞ F. for from fifteen to twenty hours. The\r\nmass is then diluted to form a semi-liquid pulp and heated to about 190∞\r\nF. for an hour or two during which the mass is constantly stirred. The\r\nmalt is then added, the mass is saccharified, cooled and then fermented.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to place mixed grain and hot water in a cooker of the\r\nBohn variety (Fig. 45). After half an hour of stirring and cooking under\r\nordinary pressure, the steam pressure is raised to 45 lbs. This is kept\r\nup for from two to three hours when the grain is reduced to a paste.\r\nConcentrated muriatic acid equal to 2-1/2 per cent of the weight of\r\ngrain is then forced in, under steam pressure. In half an hour the grain\r\nwill be entirely saccharified and ready for fermenting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                          ALCOHOL FROM BEETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.= The beetroot (_Beta vulgaris_), indigenous to Europe, is\r\ncultivated in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, Austria,\r\nRussia, and to a very small extent in England and New Zealand, and to a\r\nvery large extent in the United States and Canada. There are many\r\nvarieties. The most important to the sugar-maker is the white Silesian,\r\nsometimes regarded as a distinct species (_B. alba_); it shows very\r\nlittle above ground, and penetrates about 12 in.; it has a white flesh,\r\nthe two chief forms being distinguished by one having a rose-colored skin\r\nand purple-ribbed leaves, the other a white skin and green leaves. Both\r\nare frequently grown together, and exhibit no marked difference in\r\nsugar-yielding qualities.\r\n\r\nGood sugar-beets possess the following broad characteristics: (1) Regular\r\npear-shaped form and smooth skin; long, tapering, carrot-like roots are\r\nconsidered inferior; (2) white and firm flesh, delicate and uniform\r\nstructure, and clean sugary flavor; thick-skinned roots are spongy and\r\nwatery; those with large leaves are generally richer; (3) average weight\r\n1-1/2 to 2-1/2 lbs., neither very large nor very small roots being\r\nprofitable to the sugar-manufacturer; as a rule, beets weighing more than\r\n3-1/2 lbs. are watery, and poor in sugar; and roots weighing less than\r\n3/4 lb. are either unripe or too woody, and in either case yield\r\ncomparatively little sugar; the sp. gr. of the expressed juice, usually\r\n1.06 to 1.07, even reaching 1.078 in English-grown roots, indicating over\r\n14 per cent. of crystallizable sugar, is the best proof of quality; juice\r\npoor in sugar has a density below 1.060; (4) in well-cultivated soil, the\r\nroots grow entirely in the ground, and throw up leaves of moderate size.\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Roots.= Internally the root is built up of small\r\ncells, each filled with a juice consisting of a watery solution of many\r\nbodies besides sugar. These include several crystallized salts (mostly of\r\nwhich are present in minute traces only), such as the phosphates,\r\noxalates, malates, and chlorides of potassium, sodium, and calcium, the\r\nsalts of potash being by far the most important; and several colloid\r\nbodies (albuminous [nitrogenous] and pectinous compounds); as well as a\r\nsubstance which rapidly blackens on exposure to the air. The greater part\r\nof the sugar in ripe beets is crystallizable, and, when perfectly pure,\r\nis identical in composition and properties with crystallized cane-sugar;\r\nbut it is more difficult to refine this sugar so as to free it from the\r\npotash salts, and commercial samples have not nearly so great sweetening\r\npower as ordinary cane-sugar. Beets contain no uncrystallizable sugar;\r\nthe molasses produced in beet-sugar manufactories is the result of\r\nchanges which cannot be entirely avoided in extracting the crystallizable\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n=Soil.= The best soil for beets contains a fair proportion of organic\r\nmatter, is neither too stiff nor too light, and crumbles down into a nice\r\nfriable loam; it must be capable of being cultivated to a depth of at\r\nleast 16 in. The subsoil should be thoroughly well drained, and rendered\r\nfriable by autumn-cultivation and free admission of air. A deep friable\r\nturnip-loam, containing fair proportions of clay and lime, appears to be\r\nthe most eligible land for sugar-beets. Lime is a very desirable element.\r\nWell-worked clay-soils, especially calcareous clays, are well adapted, if\r\nproperly drained and of sufficient depth. Peaty soils and moorlands are\r\nquite unsuitable, as well as lands which are too dry, like the thin\r\ngravelly soils resting on siliceous gravel sub-soils, or too wet and\r\ncold, like many of the thin soils above impervious chalk marl.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the best soils for sugar-beet are precisely those on\r\nwhich other root-crops can be grown to perfection, that is, land which is\r\nneither too heavy nor too light, which has a good depth, is readily\r\npenetrated by the roots, and naturally contains lime, potash, clay, and\r\nsand, as well as organic matter, is such proportions as in good friable\r\nclay-loams. An analysis of the soil should be made previous to planting\r\nit with the sugar-beet, as the salts presented in solution in the soil\r\nwill pass into the juice, and greatly interfere with the processes of\r\nsugar manufacture. Certain soils may be at once indicated as unsuitable;\r\nthey are clover-land, recent sheep-pastures, forest-land grubbed during\r\nthe preceding 15 years, the neighborhood of salt works, volcanic and\r\nsaline soils of all kinds. The beet requires a certain supply of potash\r\nand soda salts in the soil, but if these are present in excess, as in\r\nrecent forest-land, the juice does not work well, nor give its proper\r\nyield of sugar.\r\n\r\n=Manures.= Sugar-beets should be grown with as little farmyard manure as\r\npossible; when dung has to be used, as in the case of very poor soils, it\r\nshould be applied in autumn, or as early as possible during the winter\r\nmonths. The effect of heavy dressings of animal nitrogenous matters or\r\nammoniacal salts, is to produce abundance of leaves, and big watery\r\nroots; the latter are comparatively poor in sugar, and contain potash\r\nsalts derived from the animal matters, which greatly interfere with the\r\nextraction of sugar in a crystallized state. Common salt, and saline\r\nmanures in general, though useful in moderate doses (224 lbs. to 336 lbs.\r\nper acre on light soils), should be avoided on the majority of soils, for\r\nsugar-beets grown on soils highly manured with common salt produce juice\r\nlargely impregnated with salt, which is dreaded by the manufacturer even\r\nmore than albuminous impurities, and nearly as much as excess of potash\r\nsalts.\r\n\r\nIf the land is in good condition, containing sufficient available\r\nnitrogen to meet the requirements of the crop, neither guano nor sulphate\r\nof ammonia should be used. They largely increase the weight of the\r\nproduce per acre; but heavy crops are generally poor in sugar, and\r\nfurnish a juice that presents much difficulty to the manufacturer. If the\r\nland is very poor, and if farmyard manure cannot be obtained and be\r\napplied in autumn, 336 to 448 lbs. of Peruvian guano, or 224 lbs. of\r\nsulphate of ammonia, mixed with 224 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, per\r\nacre, may be sown broadcast in autumn, and 224 lbs. more of\r\nsuperphosphate may be drilled in with the seed in spring. Superphosphate\r\nof lime and bones are excellent for sugar-beets, and never injure the\r\nquality of the crop, like the indiscriminate use of ammoniacal manures.\r\nOn light soils, in which potash is often deficient, the judicious use of\r\npotash salts has been found serviceable, but only in conjunction with\r\nsuperphosphate and phosphatic guanos.\r\n\r\n=Sowing.= The best time for sowing beetroot is the beginning or middle of\r\nApril. If sown too early, the young plants may be partially injured by\r\nfrost; if later than the first week in May, the crop may require to be\r\ntaken up in autumn, before it has had time to get ripe. About 10 to 12\r\nlbs. of seed is required per acre. As regards the width between the\r\nplants, generally speaking, the distance between the rows and from plant\r\nto plant should not be less than 12 nor greater than 18 in. Should the\r\nyoung plants be caught by a night's frost, and suffer ever so little, it\r\nis best to plough them up at once and re-sow, for they are certain to run\r\nto seed, and are then practically useless for the manufacture of sugar.\r\nSugar-beets require to be frequently horse- and hand-hoed. As long as the\r\nyoung plants are not injured, the application of the hoe from time to\r\ntime is attended with great benefit to the crop. It is advisable to\r\ngather up the soil round each plant, in order that the head may be\r\ncompletely covered with soil. Champonnois' researches point to the\r\nadvantage of planting in ridges, by which the supply of air to the roots\r\nis greatly facilitated.\r\n\r\nThe conditions best calculated to ensure the roots possessing the\r\ncharacters most desirable from a sugar-maker's point of view are chiefly\r\nas follows: (1) Not to sow on freshly-manured land; it is eminently\r\npreferable not to manure for the beet crop, but to manure heavily for\r\nwheat in the preceding year; (2) not to employ forcing manures, nor to\r\napply manure during growth; (3) to use seed from a variety rich in sugar;\r\n(4) to sow early, in lines 16 in. apart, at most, the plants being 10 to\r\n11 in. from each other; there will then be 38,000 beets on an acre,\r\nweighing 21 to 28 ounces each, or 52,800 to 70,400 lbs. per acre; (5) to\r\nweed the fields as soon as the plants are above ground, to thin out as\r\nearly as possible, and to weed and hoe often, till the soil is covered\r\nwith the leaves of the plants; (6) never to remove the leaves during\r\ngrowth; (7) finally, not to take up the roots, if it can be avoided,\r\nbefore they are ripe, the period of which will depend upon the season.\r\n\r\nGood seed may be raised by the following means: The best roots, which\r\nshow least above ground, are taken up, replanted in good soil, and\r\nallowed to run to seed. This seed is already good; but it may be further\r\nimproved by sowing it in a well-prepared plot possessing all the most\r\nfavorable conditions; the resulting plants are sorted, set out in autumn,\r\nput into a cellar, and in the spring, before transplanting, those of the\r\ngreatest density, and which will give seeds of the best quality, are\r\nseparated. These are transplanted at 20 in. between the rows and 13 in.\r\nbetween the feet, which are covered with about 1-1/2 in. of earth.\r\nFinally they are watered with water containing molasses and\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, as recommended by Corenwinder.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting.= Sugar-beets must be taken up before frost sets in. When the\r\nleaves begin to turn yellow and flabby, they have arrived at maturity,\r\nand the crop should be watched, that it may not get over-ripe. If the\r\nautumn is cold and dry, the crop may be safely left in the ground for\r\nseven to ten days longer than is needful, but should the autumn be mild\r\nand wet, if the roots are left in the soil, they are apt to throw up\r\nfresh leaves, and nothing does so much injury. In watching the ripening\r\nof the crop, a good plan is to test the sp. gr. of the expressed juice. A\r\nroot or two may be taken up at intervals, and reduced to pulp on an\r\nordinary hand-grater, the juice obtained by pressing the pulp through\r\ncalico, and the density observed by a hydrometer. As long as the gravity\r\nof the juice continues to increase, the crop should be left in the land.\r\nGood sugar-yielding juice has a sp. gr. of about 1.065, rising to about\r\n1.070. Immature roots, cut across, rapidly change color on the exposed\r\nsurface, turning red, then brown, and finally almost black. If newly-cut\r\nslices turn color on exposure, the ripening is not complete; but if they\r\nremain some time unaltered, or turn only slightly reddish, they are\r\nsufficiently ripe to be taken up. The crop should be harvested in fine,\r\ndry weather. In order that the roots may part with as much moisture as\r\npossible, they are left exposed to the air on the ground before being\r\nstacked, but not for longer than a few days, and they need to be guarded\r\nagainst direct sunlight. Perhaps the best plan is to cover them loosely\r\nwith their tops in the field for a couple of days, then trim them, and at\r\nonce stack them.\r\n\r\n=Storing.= For storing roots, especial care should be taken to prevent\r\ntheir germinating and throwing out fresh tops, which is best done by\r\nselecting a dry place for the storage ground. They may be piled in\r\npyramidal stacks, about six feet broad at base, and seven feet high. At\r\nfirst, the stacks should be thinly covered with earth, that the moisture\r\nmay readily evaporate; subsequently, when frosty weather sets in, another\r\nlayer of earth, not exceeding one foot in thickness, may be added. This\r\nis essentially the method generally adopted for storing potatoes and\r\nbeets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Stack for Storing Beets.]\r\n\r\nIn continental Europe and Canada, extra precaution is necessitated by the\r\nrigorous climate. In S. Russia, the plan shown in Fig. 46 is sometimes\r\nused. The beets are disposed completely below the surface of the soil, in\r\na trench dug with sharply sloping sides. At about 15 in. from the bottom,\r\nis an openwork floor of reeds, on which the beets are piled to within a\r\nfew inches of the level of the exterior soil. On the top, and following\r\nthe apex of the heap, is laid a triangular ridge-piece _a_, for the\r\npurpose of facilitating evaporation. The whole is covered with a layer\r\n_b_ of straw and fine earth, the thickness of which is varied according\r\nto the indications of the thermometer _c_ placed in the center of the\r\nmass. Between the floor of the trench and the openwork floor is a space\r\n_d_, communicating with two vertical channels leading to the outer air,\r\nthus providing ventilation. The outlets of the channels can be opened and\r\nclosed at will. The Russians also often employ regular cellars, as shown\r\nin Fig. 47. The structure consists of two stories, covered with a bed of\r\nearth, each furnished with a floor of hurdles or open planking, on which\r\nthe beets are piled to the depth of about one yard. Lateral passages\r\nfacilitate ventilation, and openings in the roof permit the heated air to\r\nescape. The cost of erecting these cellars is heavy, but there is great\r\nsaving of labor in storing the beets, as it suffices to simply pile them\r\nup on the floors. Moreover, the arrangement permits the examination of\r\nthe contents beyond the indications of a thermometer; and enables any\r\nportion to be removed, even during snowy weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Storage Cellar for Beets.]\r\n\r\n=Alcohol from Beets.= Beets contain 85 per cent. of water, and about 10\r\nper cent. of cane sugar, the remainder being woody fibre and albumen;\r\ncane sugar not being in itself fermentible,--as is grape sugar,--it has\r\nto be converted into \"inverted sugar\" by a ferment as yeast. Either the\r\nsugar beets may be mashed or the molasses which remains from the\r\nmanufacture of beet sugar (as described in Chapter X). The conversion of\r\nthe sugar into alcohol is effected in several different ways, of which\r\nthe following are the principal:\r\n\r\nBy rasping the roots and submitting them to pressure, and fermenting the\r\nexpressed juice.\r\n\r\nBy maceration with water and heat.\r\n\r\nBy direct distillation of the roots.\r\n\r\nThe first two methods are the best as by them the woody fibre of the\r\nplant which is non-fermentible is separated from the fermentible juice.\r\nIn both the first and second processes the beets must first be entirely\r\ncleaned of adhering dirt, trash and clods of earth, and then rasped,\r\npulped or sliced by certain machinery.\r\n\r\n=Cleaning.= Care must be taken in this operation that the beets shall be\r\nfreed from small stones and adhering hard lumps of earth which would\r\notherwise get into the rasping machinery to the damage and stoppage of\r\nthe mechanism.\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of cleaners but all are alike in this,--that the\r\nbeets shall be subjected to the action of water while traveling through\r\nor over a perforated casing. The simplest machine, and one easily\r\nconstructed by any carpenter, comprises an elongated cylinder formed of\r\nlathes or strips spaced apart such distance as will allow dirt and stones\r\nto pass between them. This is mounted on a central shaft and revolves in\r\na tank of water. It should be slightly inclined so that the potatoes or\r\nbeets to be washed may feed downward from the open upper end-disk or\r\nwheel, to the lower end where they are thrown out. At the upper end is a\r\nhopper and at the lower, the end disk has inwardly projecting lips, which\r\nas the cylinder revolves lifts the beets up and tumbles them out on to an\r\nincline which carries them to the rasping machine.\r\n\r\nAnother form of machine comprises a perforated cylinder of sheet iron,\r\nrevolving in a tank of water. A better form of cleaner than either of\r\nthose consists of an inclined trough in which a spiral feeding screw of\r\nsheet iron rotates. The beets are fed into the trough at its lower end\r\nand are carried upward, slowly, by the feeding screw. Above the trough is\r\na water pipe having a number of outlets by which water may fall on to the\r\nbeets and into the trough. The water rushing down the inclined trough\r\ncarries with it all dirt and stones, and by the time the beets have\r\nreached the upper end they are entirely cleaned and ready for slicing or\r\nrasping.\r\n\r\nFor pressing out the juice, the beets are mashed into a pulp, while for\r\ndiffusion the beets are sliced.\r\n\r\n=Rasping.= Fig. 48 shows one form of rasping machine. On a suitable\r\nsupporting frame is mounted a cylinder _a_ having a diameter of about 24\r\ninches. The cylinder is formed of alternate saw blades and wooden washers\r\nholding them a slight distance apart. The saws or teeth are so set on the\r\ncylinder as not to slice the beets but to shred them up into a fine pulp.\r\nThe cylinder rotates at a speed of 800 to 1000 revolutions a minute in\r\nfront of an inclined table, having a jigger whereby the beets are fed\r\ndownward against the toothed cylinder. The teeth carry the pulp downward\r\nand it falls into a receptacle beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Beet and Potato Rasp.]\r\n\r\nIt is best to add to this pulp a small portion of sulphuric acid, say\r\ntwo-tenths of one per cent. This prevents by-fermentations.\r\n\r\n=Pressing.= The pulp obtained from the raspers has now to be expressed.\r\nThis is either done by platen presses or by roller presses. With platen\r\npresses the first pressing may be done by screws, but the final pressing\r\nshould be accomplished by hydraulic presses.\r\n\r\nFor the hydraulic press, the pulp is placed in woolen sacks, containing\r\n10 to 12 lbs., superposed in the press with their mouths doubled under,\r\nand separated by iron plates; about 25 are collected, and the pile is put\r\ninto a screw-press, called a \"preparatory\" press, which extracts about 45\r\nto 50 per cent. of the juice. These pressed sacks are piled anew on the\r\nmovable plate of a powerful hydraulic press, which takes 50 at a charge.\r\nEach preparatory press can supply four hydraulic presses, which are\r\nranged around it, so that of the four presses, there will be one\r\ncharging, one commencing to press, one in full pressure, and one\r\ndischarging, at the same moment. Motion is communicated to the four\r\nhydraulic presses by four pumps mounted on the same bed, and tended by\r\nthe same workman who directs the pressing. An improvement upon the\r\ngeneral form of hydraulic press is that devised by Lalouette, which\r\nenables two workmen and one boy to work five presses. These presses turn\r\nout about 34,200 lbs. per 24 hours in the first pressing, and 68,400 lbs.\r\nin the second. Hydraulic presses are rapidly falling into disuse in the\r\nbeet-sugar industry, by reason of the superior merits of continuous\r\npresses, and the extended adoption of the diffusion system.\r\n\r\nContinuous presses for beet were suggested by the roller-mills used in\r\nthe cane-sugar industry. But the conditions in the two cases are widely\r\ndifferent; the begass of the cane is solid, and readily parts from the\r\njuice; whereas the pulp and juice of the beet have a strong tendency to\r\ncombine, and the roller-surface must therefore be permeable only by the\r\njuice. In Poizot et Druelle's press, the pulp passes between two\r\ncylinders, carried by endless cloths. The object is to unite the best\r\nfeatures of the hydraulic press. To this end, a first gentle pressing is\r\nproduced against the first cylinder by the elasticity of the principal\r\ncloth on which it is borne. Then, encountering a series of four little\r\nrollers, performing the functions of the preparatory press, it is next\r\nseized between the second and first cylinders, and deprived of the\r\nmaximum quantity of juice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Dujardin's Roll Press.]\r\n\r\nDujardin's roll press is shown in Fig. 49, which is a vertical section of\r\nthe machine, the side plate being removed. The pulp is forced upward\r\nthrough a pipe _C_ under high pressure. This has a regulating slide valve\r\n_D_. The rolls _B B_ revolve towards and nearly in contact with each\r\nother, and they are perforated so that the expressed juice may run off\r\nthrough the rolls. These perforations are conical in form with the apex\r\nof the cone outward. The cylinders are also covered with a webbing of\r\ncloth or horse hair. Below the rolls is block _C¥_, which with the outer\r\nwalls of the chamber, form diverging passages which extend upward, as\r\nshown, on either side of the rolls and then downward along the lower\r\nfaces of the rolls to the point when they contact. The pulp is compressed\r\nwith great force against and between the rolls, the juice is forced\r\nthrough the perforations and the residue passes upward and outward under\r\nthe presser bar _E_ in the form of a ribbon which is guided away by the\r\ntrough _F_. The pressure of the bar _E_ is regulated by screws and the\r\ntighter said bar is pressed against the rolls the greater will be the\r\npressure of the pulp behind the bar and against the rolls, and the\r\ngreater the juice expressed.\r\n\r\nThe rolls revolve very slowly only about seven or eight times a minute\r\nbut the capacity of the machine is very great, it being capable of\r\npressing the pulp of from 85,000 to 175,000 lbs. of beets daily. The\r\nresidue from the first pressing should be submitted to a further pressing\r\nafter being macerated with spent wash. This residue may be fed to cattle.\r\nThe utmost cleanliness is essential to these processes; all the utensils\r\nemployed should be washed daily with lime-water to counteract acidity.\r\n\r\n=Extraction by Maceration and Diffusion.= The object of this process is\r\nto extract from the beets by means of water or spent liquor all the sugar\r\nwhich they contain, without the aid of rasping or pressure. Spirit is\r\nthus produced at considerably less expense, although it is not of so high\r\na quality as that yielded by the former process. The operation consists\r\nin slicing up the beets in a specially constructed slicing machine, into\r\nslices of regular thickness, and then allowing the slices to macerate in\r\na series of vats at stated temperatures. It is essential that the knives\r\nby which the roots are cut should be so arranged that the roots are\r\ndivided into slices having a width of 4/10 of an inch and a thickness of\r\n4/100 of an inch, and a variable length; the roots are, of course, well\r\nwashed before being placed in the hopper of the cutter.\r\n\r\nWhen cut, the beets are covered with boiling water in a macerator of wood\r\nor iron for one hour, the water should contain 4.4 of sulphuric acid to\r\nevery 2200 lbs. of beets. After this, the water is drawn off into a\r\nsecond vat in which are placed more beets, and allowed to macerate again\r\nfor an hour. This is repeated a third time in another vat, and the juice,\r\nwhich has now acquired a density equal to that obtained by rasping, is\r\nrun off into the fermenting vat. When the first vat is empty it is\r\nimmediately refilled with boiling water and fresh beets; the juice from\r\nthis operation is run into the second vat, when the contents of that one\r\nare run into the third. To continue the operation, the beets are\r\ncompletely exhausted by being macerated for an hour with a third charge\r\nof boiling water (acidulated as in the former case). The exhausted pulp\r\nis removed to make room for fresh slices; and the first vat is then\r\ncharged with juice which has already passed through the second and third\r\nvats. After macerating the fresh beets for one hour, the charge is ready\r\nfor fermentation. In ordinary weather, the juice should now be at the\r\nright heat for this process, viz., about 71.1∞ or 75.2∞ F., but in very\r\ncold weather it may require some re-heating.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 50 is shown a series of vats for the extraction of the sugar from\r\nbeets such as is termed a \"diffusion battery.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Diffusion Battery.]\r\n\r\nThe vessels, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are of wood or sheet iron. Each vessel has a\r\nbottom sieve and a top sieve between which the beet slices are to be\r\nplaced. From the bottom of each vessel below the sieve a pipe _D_ runs to\r\nthe top of the vessel next in order. From the bottom of the last vessel 4\r\nof the series a pipe _C_ runs back to the top of the one first used.\r\nPipes _A_ and _B_ are connected to each vessel for the admission of water\r\nand spent wash respectively. A discharge pipe _E_ leads from each vessel\r\nto a collecting vat 5.\r\n\r\nMaceration and diffusion is accomplished as follows: The sliced beets are\r\nplaced between the sieves in vessel 1 and water or spent wash at a\r\ntemperature of 185∞ F. is let in and the beets allowed to macerate for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, meanwhile tub 2 is charged with sliced beets.\r\nThe cock or pipe _D_ between the vessels is opened when the time, three\r\nquarters of an hour, has elapsed; hot water or spent wash is admitted by\r\npipes _A_ or _B_ to the vessel 1, which forces the sugar solution therein\r\ninto vessel 2. When the required amount of fluid has been passed into 2\r\nfrom 1, the inlet of water into 1 is stopped, and the vessel heated to\r\n185∞ F.\r\n\r\nVessel 3 is charged with beet slices and in three-quarters of an hour\r\nvessels 1, 2 and 3 are connected and water or wash admitted into 1, which\r\nforces the solution in 1 into 2 and that in 2 into 3 when it is again\r\nraised to 185∞ F.\r\n\r\nThe same operation is repeated as to vessel 4 and in three-quarters of an\r\nhour all the vessels are connected, hot water or spent wash is admitted\r\nto 1 and the sugar solution drawn off from 4 into the vat.\r\n\r\nThe beets in tub 1 having now been exhausted, the fluid in that vessel is\r\ndrawn off and the exhausted beets thrown away. 1 is now recharged with\r\nbeets and the pipe between it and 4 opened. The former operation is\r\nrepeated except that now vessel 4 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 4. These\r\nsuccessive chargings and dischargings are continued; vessel 3 becomes 1\r\nin its turn and so on.\r\n\r\n=Fermentation.= Before fermentation the juice procured as has been\r\ndescribed is brought to about 82∞ F.; at this temperature it is run off\r\ninto the fermenting vats. Here it is necessary, as before noted, to add\r\nto the juice a small quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid, for the\r\npurpose of neutralizing the alkaline salts which it contains, and of\r\nrendering it slightly acid in order to hasten the process; this quantity\r\nmust not exceed 5-1/2 lbs. to every 1220 gallons of juice, or the\r\nestablishment of fermentation would be hindered instead of promoted. The\r\naddition of this acid tends also to prevent the viscous fermentation\r\nto which the juice obtained by rasping and pressure is so liable.\r\nAlthough the beet contains albumen, which is in itself a ferment, it\r\nis necessary, in order to develop the process, to have recourse to\r\nartificial means. A small quantity of brewer's yeast--about 1-3/4\r\noz. per 22 gallons of juice--is sufficient for this; the yeast must\r\npreviously be mixed with a little water. An external temperature of\r\nabout 68∞ to 78∞ F. must be carefully maintained. Fermentation lasts for\r\nfrom four to five hours.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation of acidulated beet-juice sets in speedily. The chief\r\nobstacle to the process is the mass of thick scum which forms upon the\r\nsurface of the liquor. This difficulty is sometimes obviated by using\r\nseveral vats and mixing the juice, while in full fermentation, with a\r\nfresh quantity. Thus, when three vats are employed, one is set to\r\nferment; at the end of four or six hours, half its contents are run into\r\nthe second vat and here mixed with fresh juice. The process is arrested,\r\nbut soon starts again in both vats simultaneously; the first is now\r\nallowed to ferment completely, which is effected with much less\r\ndifficulty than would have been the case had the vat not been divided.\r\nMeanwhile the second vat, as soon as the action is at its height, is\r\ndivided in the same manner, one-half its contents being run into the\r\nthird. When this method is employed, it is necessary to add a little\r\nyeast from time to time when the action becomes sluggish.\r\n\r\n=Direct Distillation of the Roots.= This process, commonly called\r\n\"Leplay's method,\" consists in fermenting the sugar in the slices\r\nthemselves. The operation is conducted in huge vats, holding as large a\r\nquantity of matter as possible, in order that the fermentation may be\r\nestablished more easily. They usually contain about 750 gallons, and a\r\nsingle charge consists of 2200 lbs. of the sliced roots. The slices are\r\nplaced in porous bags in the vats, containing already about 440 gallons\r\nof water acidulated with a little sulphuric acid; and they are kept\r\nsubmerged by means of a perforated cover, which permits the passage of\r\nthe liquor and of the carbonic acid evolved; the temperature of the\r\nmixture should be maintained at about 77∞ or 80∞ F. A little yeast is\r\nadded, and fermentation speedily sets in; it is complete in about 24\r\nhours or more, when the bags are taken out and replaced by fresh ones;\r\nfermentation declares itself again almost immediately, and without any\r\naddition of yeast. New bags may, indeed, be placed in the same liquor for\r\nthree or four successive fermentations without adding further yeast or\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nThe slices of beets charged with alcohol are now placed in a distilling\r\napparatus of a very simple nature. It consists of a cylindrical column of\r\nwood or iron, fitted with a tight cover, which is connected with a coil\r\nor worm, kept cool in a vessel of cold water. Inside this column are\r\narranged a row of perforated diaphragms or partitions. The space between\r\nthe lowest one and the bottom of the cylinder is kept empty to receive\r\nthe condensed water formed by the steam, which is blown into the bottom\r\nof the cylinder in order to heat the contents. Vapors of alcohol are thus\r\ndisengaged from the undermost slices, and these vapors as they rise\r\nthrough the cylinder vaporize the remaining alcohol, and finally pass out\r\nof the top at a considerable strength and are condensed in the worm. When\r\nall the contents of the still have been completely exhausted of spirit,\r\nthe remainder consists of a cooked pulp, which contains all the nutritive\r\nconstituents of the beet except the sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                 ALCOHOL FROM MOLASSES AND SUGAR CANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother common source of alcohol is molasses. Molasses is the\r\nuncrystallizable syrup which constitutes the residiuum of the manufacture\r\nand refining of cane and beet sugar. It is a dense, viscous liquid,\r\nvarying in color from light yellow to almost black, according to the\r\nsource from which it is obtained; it tests usually about 40∞ by Baume's\r\nhydrometer. The molasses employed as a source of alcohol must be\r\ncarefully chosen; the lightest in color is the best, containing most\r\nuncrystallized sugar. The manufacture is extensively carried on in\r\nFrance, where the molasses from the beet sugar refineries is chiefly used\r\non account of its low price, that obtained from the cane sugar factories\r\nbeing considerably dearer. The latter is, however, much to be preferred\r\nto the former variety as it contains more sugar. Molasses from the beet\r\nsugar refineries yields a larger quantity and better quality of spirit\r\nthan that which comes from the factories. Molasses contains about 50 per\r\ncent. of saccharine matter, 24 per cent. of other organic matter, and\r\nabout 10 per cent. of inorganic salts, chiefly of potash. It is thus a\r\nsubstance rich in matters favorable to fermentation. When the density of\r\nmolasses has been lowered by dilution with water, fermentation sets in\r\nrapidly, more especially if it has been previously rendered acid. As,\r\nhowever, molasses from beet generally exhibits an alkaline reaction, it\r\nis found necessary to acidify it after dilution; for this purpose\r\nsulphuric acid is employed, in the proportion of about 4-1/2 lbs. of\r\nthe concentrated acid to 22 gallons of molasses, previously diluted\r\nwith eight or ten volumes of water. Three processes are thus employed\r\nin obtaining alcohol from molasses; dilution, acidification, and\r\nfermentation. The latter is hastened by the addition of a natural\r\nferment, such as brewer's yeast. It begins in about eight or ten hours,\r\nand lasts upwards of 60.\r\n\r\nAbout three gallons of Alcohol may be obtained from one hundred pounds of\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\n=Beet Sugar Molasses.= The first step in the process of rendering the\r\nmolasses fermentable is to mix the molasses with water, to a certain\r\ndilution, in the proportion of two parts of water to one of molasses.\r\nThis may be done by hand, but preferably it is performed in a vat\r\nprovided with stirring or agitating mechanism, such as will effectually\r\nmix the water with the viscid syrup, and whereby also the wash may be\r\nthoroughly agitated and aerated.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous forms of mixing vats, all working however, on the\r\nprinciple shown in Fig. 51. In this, the vat _A_ is provided with a\r\ncentral shaft _C_ carrying radial mixing blades _E_. This shaft is\r\ndriven by bevel gears _D_, _F_. As the rotation of these blades would\r\nmerely tend to create a rotary current of molasses and water, and not to\r\nmix them, some means should be used for impeding and breaking up this\r\ncurrent. To that end the cover is provided with downwardly projecting\r\nrods _I_ which create counter currents, and thoroughly intermingle the\r\ntwo liquids. Another and even better form of mixer consists of a tank\r\ninto the lower portion of which enters a perforated pipe of relatively\r\nlarge diameter. This is provided at the end with an air entrance and a\r\nsteam injector. The injected steam draws in air and the steam and air are\r\nforced under pressure into the vat, thus diluting the contained molasses,\r\nagitating it and thoroughly aerating it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Mixing Vat.]\r\n\r\nThe molasses as it comes from the sugar house may contain anywhere from\r\n30 to 45 per cent of sugar, and this should be diluted with water to a\r\nconcentration of 16 to 18 per cent of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe density of the wash after \"setting up\" is 1.060. It is to be noted\r\nthat though with improved apparatus a wash as concentrated at 12∞ or 15∞\r\nBaume may be worked; yet where simple apparatus is used six degrees or\r\neight degrees is better and much more favorable to rapid and complete\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up, one gallon of strong sulphuric acid and 10 lbs. of\r\nsulphate of ammonia are added for each 1000 gallons of wash. This\r\nneutralizes the alkaline carbonates in the beet juice which would\r\notherwise retard fermentation, and it assists the yeast to invert the\r\ncane sugar as formerly described. The addition of ammonia is in order to\r\ngive food to the yeast and obtain a vigorous fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe yeast used for fermenting molasses is prepared either from malt or\r\ngrain and is used as concentrated as possible, and in the proportion of\r\nabout 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe \"pitching\" temperature of a molasses wash varies with the\r\nconcentration of the wash, being higher for strongly concentrated\r\nsolutions than for weak ones. When the wash tests as high as 12∞ Baume,\r\nfermentation begins at about 77∞ F. and is raised during fermentation to\r\n85∞ or 90∞ F. A temperature around 82∞ F. is best on the average as this\r\nis most conducive to the growth of yeast.\r\n\r\nWhere the vats are large and the syrup considerably diluted the\r\ntemperature rises very quickly and must be moderated by passing a current\r\nof cold water through a coil of pipe on the bottom of the vat.\r\n\r\nIn the making of molasses mashes it must be remembered that every gallon\r\nof molasses will be diluted with about five gallons of water or other\r\nfermented liquid matter, and therefore 50 gallons of molasses wash will\r\nrequire a still capable of working up about 300 gallons. It is possible\r\nto distill four or five charges during the day of 12 hours and hence a\r\nstill of 60 gallons will be capable of distilling the beer or wash made\r\nwith 50 gallons of molasses. A still with a capacity of 100 gallons\r\noperating on wash having a strength of one gallon of molasses to five of\r\nwater, will produce about 10 gallons of proof spirit from each charge;\r\nthus a 100 gallon still will make from 40 to 80 gallons of spirit in a\r\nday. With unskilled labor, however, it is impossible to get this rate of\r\nproduction and the best that can be done will be about four charges a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that in getting estimates on stills it is best to\r\naccompany the request with a statement of the character of the mash\r\nintended to be treated, the amount of raw materials intended to be used\r\nup, the charging capacity required, number of gallons of mash desired to\r\nbe worked up every 12 hours.\r\n\r\n=Fermenting Raw Sugar.= This is accomplished by dissolving the sugar in\r\nhot water, then diluting it, and then adding a ferment,--fermentation\r\nbeing aided by adding sulphuric acid to the diluted molasses, in the\r\nproportion of one-half to one pound of acid to every hundred pounds of\r\npure sugar used.\r\n\r\nThe wash is pitched with compressed yeast in the proportion of 2-1/2[**\r\nfraction] to 8 per cent of the weight of the sugar used. The pitching\r\ntemperature is from 77∞ to 79∞ F., and the period of fermentation is 48\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n=Cane Sugar Molasses.= Besides the molasses of the French beet sugar\r\nrefineries, large quantities result from the manufacture of cane sugar in\r\nJamaica and the West Indies. This is entirely employed for the\r\ndistillation of _rum_. As the pure spirit of Jamaica is never made from\r\nsugar, but always from molasses and skimmings, it is advisable to notice\r\nthese two products, and, together with them, the exhausted wash commonly\r\ncalled _dunder_.\r\n\r\nThe molasses proceeding from the West Indian cane sugar contains\r\ncrystallizable and uncrystallizable sugar, gluten, or albumen, and other\r\norganic matters which have escaped separation during the process of\r\ndefecation and evaporation, together with saline matters and water. It\r\ntherefore contains in itself all the elements necessary for fermentation,\r\n_i.e._, sugar, water, and gluten, which latter substance, acting the part\r\nof a ferment, speedily establishes the process under certain conditions.\r\n_Skimmings_ comprise the matters separated from the cane juice during\r\nthe processes of defecation and evaporation. The scum of the clarifiers,\r\nprecipitators, and evaporators, and the precipitates in both clarifiers\r\nand precipitators, together with a proportion of cane sugar mixed with\r\nthe various scums and precipitates, and the \"sweet-liquor\" resulting from\r\nthe washing of the boiling-pans, etc., all become mixed together in the\r\nskimming-receiver and are fermented under the name of \"skimmings.\" They\r\nalso contain the elements necessary for fermentation, and accordingly\r\nthey very rapidly pass into a state of fermentation when left to\r\nthemselves; but, in consequence of the glutinous matters being in excess\r\nof the sugar, this latter is speedily decomposed, and the second, or\r\nacetous fermentation, commences very frequently before the first is far\r\nadvanced. _Dunder_ is the fermented wash after it has undergone\r\ndistillation, by which it has been deprived of the alcohol it contained.\r\nTo be good, it should be light, clear, and slightly bitter; it should be\r\nquite free from acidity, and is always best when fresh. As it is\r\ndischarged from the still, it runs into receivers placed on a lower\r\nlevel, from which it is pumped up when cool into the upper receivers,\r\nwhere it clarifies, and is then drawn down into the fermenting cisterns\r\nas required. Well-clarified dunder will keep for six weeks without any\r\ninjury. Good dunder may be considered to be the liquor, or \"wash,\" as it\r\nis termed, deprived by distillation of its alcohol, and much concentrated\r\nby the boiling it has been subjected to; whereby the substances it\r\ncontains, as gluten, gum, oils, etc., have become, from repeated\r\nboilings, so concentrated as to render the liquid mass a highly aromatic\r\ncompound. In this state it contains at least two of the elements\r\nnecessary for fermentation, so that, on the addition of the third, viz.,\r\nsugar, that process speedily commences.\r\n\r\nThe first operation is to clarify the mixture of molasses and skimmings\r\nprevious to fermenting it. This is performed in a leaden receiver holding\r\nabout 300 or 400 gallons. When the clarification is complete, the clear\r\nliquor is run into the fermenting vat, and there mixed with 100 or 200\r\ngallons of water (hot, if possible), and well stirred. The mixture is\r\nthen left to ferment. The great object that the distiller has in view in\r\nconducting the fermentation is to obtain the largest possible amount of\r\nspirit that the sugar employed will yield, and to take care that the loss\r\nby evaporation or acetification is reduced to a minimum. In order to\r\nensure this, the following course should be adopted. The room in which\r\nthe process is carried on must be kept as cool as it is possible in a\r\ntropical climate; say, 75∞ to 80∞ F.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the fermenting vat has a capacity of 1000 gallons, the\r\nproportions of the different liquors run in would be 200 gallons of\r\nwell-clarified skimmings, 50 gallons of molasses, and 100 gallons of\r\nclear dunder; they should be well mixed together. Fermentation speedily\r\nsets in, and 50 more gallons of molasses are then to be added, together\r\nwith 200 gallons of water. When fermentation is thoroughly established, a\r\nfurther 400 gallons of dunder may be run in, and the whole well stirred\r\nup. Any scum thrown up during the process is immediately skimmed off. The\r\ntemperature of the mass rises gradually until about 4∞ or 5∞ above that\r\nof the room itself. Should it rise too high, the next vat must be set up\r\nwith more dunder and less water; if it keeps very low, and the action is\r\nsluggish, less must be used next time. No fermenting principle besides\r\nthe gluten contained in the wash is required. The process usually\r\noccupies eight or ten days, but it may last much longer. The liquid now\r\nbecomes clear, and should be immediately subjected to distillation to\r\nprevent acetous fermentation.\r\n\r\nSugar planters are accustomed to expect one gallon of proof rum for every\r\ngallon of molasses employed. On the supposition that ordinary molasses\r\ncontains 65 parts of sugar, 32 parts of water, and three parts of organic\r\nmatter and salts, and that, by careful fermentation and distillation, 33\r\nparts of absolute alcohol may be obtained, we may then reckon upon 33\r\nlbs. of spirit, or about four gallons, which is a yield of about 5-2/3[**\r\nfraction] gallons of rum, 30 per cent. over-proof, from 100 lbs. of such\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\nThe following process is described in Deerr's work on \"Sugar and Sugar\r\nCane.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Mauritius a more complicated process is used; a barrel of about 50\r\ngallons capacity is partly filled with molasses and water of density 1.10\r\nand allowed to spontaneously ferment; sometimes a handful of oats or rice\r\nis placed in this preliminary fermentation. When attenuation is nearly\r\ncomplete more molasses is added until the contents of the cask are again\r\nof density 1.10 and again allowed to ferment. This process is repeated a\r\nthird time; the contents of the barrel are then distributed between three\r\nor four tanks holding each about 500 gallons of wash of density 1.10 and\r\n12 hours after fermentation has started here, one of these is used to\r\npitch a tank of about 8,000 gallons capacity; a few gallons are left in\r\nthe pitching tanks which are again filled up with wash of density 1.10\r\nand the process repeated until the attenuations fall off, when a fresh\r\nstart is made. This process is very similar to what obtains in modern\r\ndistilleries save that the initial fermentation is adventitious.\r\n\r\n\"In Java and the East generally, a very different procedure is followed.\r\nIn the first place a material known as Java, or Chinese, yeast is\r\nprepared from native formulÊ; in Java, pieces of sugar cane are crushed\r\nalong with certain aromatic herbs, amongst which galanga and garlic are\r\nalways present, and the resulting extract made into a paste with rice\r\nmeal; the paste is formed into strips, allowed to dry in the sun and then\r\nmacerated with water and lemon juice; the pulpy mass obtained after\r\nstanding for three days is separated from the water and made into small\r\nballs, rolled in rice straw and allowed to dry; these balls are known as\r\nRaggi or Java yeast. In the next step rice is boiled and spread out in a\r\nlayer on plantain leaves and sprinkled over with Raggi, then packed in\r\nearthenware pots and left to stand for two days, at the end of which\r\nperiod the rice is converted into a semi-liquid mass; this material is\r\ntermed Tapej and is used to excite fermentation in molasses wash. The\r\nwash is set up at a density of 25∞ Balling and afterwards the process is\r\nas usual. In this proceeding the starch in the rice is converted by means\r\nof certain micro-organisms _Chlamydomucor oryzae_ into sugar and then\r\nforms a suitable habitat for the reproduction of yeasts which are\r\nprobably present in the Raggi but may find their way into the Tapej from\r\nother sources. About 100 lbs. of rice are used to pitch 1,000 gallons of\r\nwash.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                             ALCOHOLOMETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcoholmetry is the name given to a variety of methods of determining the\r\nquantity of absolute alcohol contained in spirituous liquors. It will\r\nreadily be seen that a quick and accurate method of making such\r\ndeterminations is of the very utmost importance to those who are engaged\r\nin the liquor traffic, since the value of spirit depends entirely upon\r\nthe percentage of alcohol which it contains. When alcoholic liquors\r\nconsist of simple mixtures of alcohol and water, the test is a simple\r\none, the exact percentage being readily deducible from the specific\r\ngravity of the liquor, because to a definite specific gravity belongs a\r\ndefinite content of alcohol; this is obtained either by means of the\r\n_specific gravity bottle_, or of hydrometers of various kinds, specially\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nAll hydrometers comprise essentially a graduated stem of uniform\r\ndiameter, a bulb forming a float and a counterpoise or ballast. The\r\nhydrometers may either be provided with a scale indicated on the neck or\r\nelse with weights added to sink the hydrometer to a certain mark. The\r\nfirst instruments are called hydrometers of \"constant immersion,\" the\r\nothers, of \"variable immersion.\"\r\n\r\nAt the latter end of the last century, a series of arduous experiments\r\nwere conducted by Sir C. Blagden, at the instance of the British\r\ngovernment, with a view to establishing a fixed proportion between the\r\nspecific gravity of spirituous liquors and the quantity of absolute\r\nalcohol contained in them. The result of these experiments, after being\r\ncarefully verified, led to the construction of a series of tables,\r\nreference to which gives at once the percentage of alcohol for any given\r\nnumber of degrees registered by the hydrometer; these tables are\r\ninvariably sold with the instrument. They are also constructed to show\r\nthe number of degrees over-or under-proof, corresponding to the\r\nhydrometric degrees. Other tables are obtainable which give the specific\r\ngravity corresponding to these numbers.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the percentage of absolute alcohol in spirituous\r\nliquors is almost invariably expressed in volume rather than weight,\r\nowing to the fact that such liquors are always sold by volume.\r\nNevertheless, the tables referred to above show the percentage of spirit\r\nboth by volume and weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Syke's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the standard liquor, known as _proof spirit_,\r\ncontains 92.3 per cent. by weight and 94.9 per cent. by volume, of\r\nabsolute alcohol; it has a specific gravity of .9186 at 60∞ F. A proof\r\ngallon contains by measurement 100 parts of alcohol and 81.5 parts of\r\nwater. The strength and therefore the value of spirituous liquors is\r\nestimated according to the quantity by volume of anhydrous spirit\r\ncontained in the liquor with reference to this standard. Thus the\r\nexpression \"20 _per cent. overproof_,\" \"20 _per cent. underproof_,\" means\r\nthat the liquor contain 20 volumes of water for every 100 volumes over\r\nor under this fixed quantity, and that in order to reduce the spirit to\r\n_proof_, 20 per cent. of water by volume, must be subtracted or added, as\r\nthe case may be. Any hydrometer constructed for the measurement of\r\nliquids of less density than water may be employed. That known as\r\n\"Syke's\" is most commonly used for alcoholometric purposes. It is shown\r\nin Fig. 52 and consists of a spherical brass ball _A_, to which is fixed\r\ntwo stems; the upper one _B_ is also of brass, flat, and about 3-1/2[**\r\nfraction] in. in length; it is divided into ten parts, each being\r\nsubdivided into five, and the whole being numbered as shown in the\r\nfigure. The lower stem _C_ is conical, and slightly more than an inch\r\nlong; it terminates in a weighted bulb _D_. A series of circular weights,\r\nof the form shown in the figure, accompany the instrument; these are\r\nslipped upon the top of the lower stem _C_, and allowed to slip down\r\nuntil they rest upon the bulb _D_. The instrument is used in the\r\nfollowing way: It is submerged in the liquor to be tested until the whole\r\nof the upper stem is under the surface, and an idea is thus gained of the\r\nweight that will be required to _partly_ submerge the stem. This weight\r\nis added, and the hydrometer again placed in the liquor. The figure on\r\nthe scale to which the instrument has sunk when at rest is now observed,\r\nand added to the number on the weight used, the sum giving, by reference\r\nto the tables, the percentage by volume of absolute alcohol above or\r\nbelow the standard quantity.\r\n\r\nIn exact estimations, the temperature of the liquor tested must be\r\ncarefully registered, and the necessary corrections made. In Jones's\r\nhydrometer, which is an improvement upon Syke's, a small spirit\r\nthermometer is attached to the bulb, and by noting the temperature of the\r\nliquor at the time of the experiment, and referring to the tables\r\naccompanying the instrument, the strength is found at once without the\r\nneed of calculation.\r\n\r\nDica's hydrometer is very similar to Jones's instrument above described.\r\nIt is of copper, has a stem fitted to receive brass poises, a\r\nthermometer, a graduated scale, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Gay-Lussac's hydrometer and tables are chiefly used for\r\nalcoholometric testing. This instrument is precisely similar in\r\nconstruction to those of Twaddle and Baume. On the scale, zero is\r\nobtained by placing it in pure distilled water at 59∞ F., and the highest\r\nmark, or 100, by placing it in pure alcohol at the same temperature, the\r\nintermediate space being divided into 100 equal divisions, each\r\nrepresenting one per cent. of absolute alcohol. The correction for\r\ntemperature, as in the above cases, is included in the reference tables.\r\n\r\nAnother hydrometer, used in France for alcoholometric determinations, is\r\nCartier's. In form it is precisely similar to Baume's hydrometer. Zero is\r\nthe same in both instruments, but the point marked 30∞ in Cartier's is\r\nmarked 32∞ in Baume's, the degrees of the latter being thus diminished in\r\nthe proportion of 15 or 16. Cartier's hydrometer is only used for liquids\r\nlighter than water.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholmeter of Tralles is the official instrument for testing\r\nalcoholic liquors in the U. S. but the instrument which is most generally\r\nused both here and abroad is that of BeaumÈ. There are two instruments\r\nbearing BeaumÈ's name, one for liquids lighter than water, the other for\r\nthose which are heavier. All hydrometers, alcoholmeters and\r\nsaccharometers work on the same principle, though they are each\r\ndifferently graduated for the particular work to be done and the details\r\nof the measuring process are slightly different. All these instruments\r\nare provided with tables whereby their readings may be corrected and the\r\nspecific gravity of the liquid determined.\r\n\r\nThe above hydrometric methods can be safely employed only when the spirit\r\ntested contains a very small amount of solid matter, since, when such\r\nmatter is contained in the liquor in quantity, the density alone cannot\r\npossibly afford a correct indication of its richness in alcohol. Many\r\nmethods have been proposed for the estimation of alcohol in liquor,\r\ncontaining saccharine coloring and extractive matters, either in solution\r\nor suspension. Undoubtedly the most accurate of these, though at the same\r\ntime the most tedious, is to subject the liquor to a process of\r\ndistillation by which a mixture of pure alcohol and water is obtained as\r\nthe distillate. This mixture is carefully tested with the hydrometer, and\r\nthe percentage of alcohol in it determined by reference to the tables as\r\nabove described; from this quantity and the volume of the original liquor\r\nemployed the percentage by volume of alcohol in that liquor is readily\r\nfound. The condensing arrangement must be kept perfectly cool, if\r\npossible in a refrigerator, as the alcohol in the distillate is very\r\nliable to be lost by re-evaporation. When great accuracy is desired, and\r\ntime is at the operator's disposal, the above method is preferable to all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is performed in the following manner: Three hundred parts of the\r\nliquor to be examined are placed in a small still, or retort, and exactly\r\none-third of this quantity is distilled over. A graduated glass tube is\r\nused as the receiver, in order that the correct volume may be drawn over\r\nwithout error. The alcoholic richness of the distillate is then\r\ndetermined by any of the above methods, and the result is divided by\r\nthree, which gives at once the percentage of alcohol in the original\r\nliquor. The strength at proof may be calculated from this in the ordinary\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIf the liquor be acid, it must be neutralized with carbonate of soda\r\nbefore being submitted to distillation. From eight to ten per cent. of\r\ncommon salt must be added, in order to raise the boiling point, so that\r\nthe whole of the spirit may pass over before it has reached the required\r\nmeasure. In the case of the stronger wines it is advisable to distil over\r\n150 parts and divide by two instead of three. If the liquor be stronger\r\nthan 25 per cent. by volume of alcohol, or above 52 to 54 per cent.\r\nunder-proof, an equal volume of water should be added to the liquid in\r\nthe still, and a quantity distilled over equal to that of the sample\r\ntested, when the alcoholic strength of the distillate gives, without\r\ncalculation, the correct strength required. If the liquor be stronger\r\nthan 48 to 50 per cent. under-proof, three times its volume of water must\r\nbe added, and the process must be continued until the volume of the\r\ndistillate is twice that of the sample originally taken. In each case the\r\nproportionate quantity of common salt must be added.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of alcohol in wines, liquors, etc., the following\r\nmethod may be employed: A measuring flask is filled up to a mark on its\r\nneck with the liquor under examination, which is then transferred to a\r\nretort; the flask must be carefully rinsed out with distilled water, and\r\nthe rinsings added to the liquor in the retort. About two-thirds are then\r\ndrawn over into the same measuring flask, and made up to its previous\r\nbulk with distilled water, at the same temperature as that of the sample\r\nbefore distillation. The strength is then determined by means of Syke's\r\nhydrometer, and this, if under-proof, deducted from 100, gives the true\r\npercentage of proof-spirit in the wine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Field's Alcoholometer.]\r\n\r\nA quick, if not always very exact, method consists in determining the\r\npoint at which the liquor boils. The boiling point of absolute alcohol\r\nbeing once determined, it is obvious that the more it is diluted with\r\nwater the nearer will the boiling point of the mixture approach that of\r\nwater; moreover, it has been proved that the presence of saccharine and\r\nother solid matters has but an almost inappreciable effect upon this\r\npoint. Field's alcoholometer, since improved by Ure, is based upon this\r\nprinciple. It is shown in Fig. 53, and consists, roughly speaking, of a\r\ncylindrical vessel _A_, to contain the spirit; this vessel is heated from\r\nbeneath by a spirit lamp, which fits into the case _B_. A delicate\r\nthermometer _C_, the bulb of which is introduced into the spirit, is\r\nattached to a scale divided into 100 divisions, of which each represents\r\none degree over-or under-proof. This method is liable to several small\r\nsources of error, but when a great many determinations have to be made,\r\nand speed is an object rather than extreme accuracy, this instrument\r\nbecomes exceedingly useful. It does not answer well with spirits _above_\r\nproof, because the variation in their boiling points are so slight as not\r\nto be easily observed with accuracy. But for liquors under-proof, and\r\nespecially for wines, beer, and other fermented liquors, it gives results\r\nclosely approximating to those obtained by distillation, and quite\r\naccurate enough for all ordinary purposes. Strong liquors should\r\ntherefore be tested with twice their bulk, and commercial spirits with an\r\nequal bulk, of water, the result obtained being multiplied by two or\r\nthree, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAnother very expeditious, but somewhat rough, method was invented by\r\nGeisler. It consists in measuring the tension of the vapor of the spirit,\r\nby causing it to raise a column of mercury in a closed tube. The very\r\nsimple apparatus is shown in Fig. 54. _A_ is a small glass bulb, fitted\r\nwith a narrow tube and stop-cock. This vessel is completely filled with\r\nthe spirit, and is then screwed upon a long, narrow tube _B_, bent at one\r\nend and containing mercury. This tube is attached to a graduated scale\r\nshowing the percentage of absolute alcohol above or below proof. To make\r\nthe test the cock is opened, and the bulb, together with the lower part\r\nof the tube, is immersed in boiling water, which gradually raises the\r\nspirit to its boiling-point. When this is reached, the vapor forces the\r\nmercury up the tube, and, when stationary, the degree on the scale to\r\nwhich it has ascended gives directly the percentage of alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Geisler's Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nAnother method, which is not to be relied on for very weak liquors, but\r\nwhich answers well for cordials, wines, and strong ales, is that known as\r\nBrande's method. The liquor is poured into a long, narrow glass tube,\r\ngraduated centesimally, until it is half-filled. About 12 or 15 per cent.\r\nof subacetate of lead, or finely powdered litharge, is then added, and\r\nthe whole is shaken until all the color is destroyed. Powdered anhydrous\r\ncarbonate of potash is next added until it sinks undissolved in the tube,\r\neven after prolonged agitation. The tube is then allowed to rest, when\r\nthe alcohol is observed to float upon the surface of the water in a\r\nwell-defined layer. The quantity read off on the scale of the tube and\r\ndoubled, gives the percentage by volume of alcohol in the original\r\nliquid. The whole operation may be performed in about five minutes, and\r\nfurnishes reliable approximative results. In many cases it is necessary\r\nto add the lead salt for the purpose of decolorizing the liquid.\r\n\r\nFor the investigation of the amount of sugar in, or the concentration of\r\nthe mash, or beer, a specially scaled hydrometer is used which is termed\r\na saccharometer. Sugar possesses a higher degree of specific gravity than\r\nwater, and hence it follows that the greater the amount of sugar in the\r\nmash the higher will be the specific gravity. The less the hydrometer\r\nsinks into the fluid the greater the amount of sugar present.\r\nSaccharometers are provided with thermometers whereby the reading may be\r\ncorrected to a standard temperature, usually 59∞ F. The saccharometer is\r\ncorrect for solutions containing sugar alone but it is only approximately\r\ncorrect for mash liquor which contains a variety of other matters in\r\nvariable quantities.\r\n\r\nIt is a prime necessity that the distiller should be able to determine if\r\nthe mash has been completely saccharified by the malt. For this purpose a\r\nsolution of iodine is used. Iodine gives to starch a blue color. If the\r\nstarch however, has been completely changed into sugar there will either\r\nbe no discoloration or the filtered mash liquid which is at first a\r\nyellowish red becomes blue, then violet, and at last red.\r\n\r\n=Determination of the Purity of Alcohols.= While the knowledge of the\r\namount of alcohol contained in a liquid is of great practical utility,\r\nthis does not give any idea of the impurities present.\r\n\r\nAn alcohol of 100 degrees or an absolute alcohol, may contain numerous\r\nimpurities which may greatly affect its quality. It is therefore\r\nnecessary in addition to analyze the purity of the alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn commercial practice there are certain simple processes which will give\r\na basis by which to determine the impurities left after distillation and\r\nrectification. These processes are largely empirical. They are based on\r\nthe perception of the senses and are consequently of an entirely relative\r\ndegree of precision. Nevertheless, when made by a practical expert, the\r\noperation may give very useful preliminary indications.\r\n\r\nThis test is made in a glass of special shape broad at the bottom and\r\nnarrowing at the top in order to concentrate the aroma of the product.\r\nOrdinary brandies are tested undiluted. Commercial alcohols, of about 95\r\ndegrees must be diluted with water to a maximum of 30 degrees. Otherwise\r\nthe burning tang of the alcohol would preclude any delicacy of perception\r\nand allow impurities to pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe operation is begun by examination by sense of smell. The glass is\r\nhalf filled with the liquid diluted with one half of pure water. The\r\nglass is covered with one hand and shaken violently for a few seconds.\r\nImmediately upon uncovering it, the quality of the alcoholic vapors may\r\nbe ascertained by their odor.\r\n\r\nFor the examination by sense of taste, the operator rinses his mouth for\r\na moment with the liquid itself. The taste of ethyl alcohol is fairly\r\ntransient;--it disappears quickly allowing the taste of the accompanying\r\nforeign matter to be perceived almost immediately afterward. With a\r\nlittle practice this test enables one to distinguish by their flavor the\r\nprimal origin of alcohols and to judge of their purity. Some\r\nprofessionals succeed by training in arriving at high degree of skill in\r\nthe art of tasting alcohol as it should be done.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the purity of alcohol there are besides chemical\r\ntests used by the trade. These tests, which consist in characterizing and\r\nmeasuring separately the impurities which alcohol may contain, such as\r\nacids, ethers, aldehydes, bases, etc., belong exclusively to analytical\r\nchemistry; they are extremely delicate and complicated. We will not\r\nventure to touch upon them here.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest tests for purity is that of Barbet. This is based\r\nupon the time taken to discolor a solution of permanganate of potash\r\nunder the action of the tested alcohol. It is not only very rapid but in\r\ngeneral more practical than other tests. It allows the aggregate of the\r\nimpurities contained in an alcohol to be ascertained in a single\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe permanganate solution used is very weak (0. gr. 200 of salt), and of\r\na violet-red color. The technique of the proceeding is as follows: 50\r\ncubic centimeters of the alcohol to be tested are placed in a glass\r\nvessel the temperature of which is maintained at 64.40∞F. 2 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the permanganate solution are abruptly added and the time\r\nnoted to within a second. Discoloration is awaited and as soon as it\r\ntakes place the time is again noted. The total discoloration of the\r\npermanganate is not very marked and passes through intermediate stages;\r\ntherefore it is preferable not to await complete discoloration but to\r\nstop at a pale salmon tint, which tint may be comparatively fixed by a\r\nsample of colored liquid (say a solution of fuchsine and chromate of\r\npotash).\r\n\r\nThe comparative times of discoloration obtained by M. Barbet with various\r\ncommercial alcohols, are as follows:\r\n\r\n         Pure alcohol                           43 min. 30 sec.\r\n         Extra fine alcohol                      5  \"   30  \"\r\n         Semi fine alcohol                       5  \"   10  \"\r\n         Medium flavor alcohol (first running)   5  \"    5  \"\r\n         Mediocre alcohol                        5  \"   11  \"\r\n         Medium flavor alcohol (last running)    2  \"   12  \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n      DISTILLING PLANTS: THEIR GENERAL ARRANGEMENT AND EQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the manufactories of to-day with their complicated\r\nmachinery, their extensive equipment, their great boilers, and engines\r\nand their hundreds of employees, we are liable to forget that good work\r\nwas turned out by our ancestors, with equipment of extreme simplicity and\r\nthat to-day while there are, for instance, thousands of wood-working\r\nmills, complete in every detail and covering under a multitude of roofs\r\nevery variety of complicated and perfected wood-working machinery, yet\r\nthere are many more thousands of small plants, comprising a portable\r\nboiler, fed with refuse, a small engine and a few saws which are making\r\nmoney for the owners and doing the work of the world.\r\n\r\nThe reader therefore, must be warned against any feeling of\r\ndiscouragement because of the cost and complicated perfection of\r\nelaborate distilling plants. Where the business is to be entered into on\r\na large scale, to take the products from a considerable section of\r\ncountry and turn them into alcohol to compete in the great markets, the\r\nbest of apparatus and equipment is not too good, but the person\r\ncontemplating the mere manufacture of alcohol on a small scale, to serve\r\nonly a small section, must remember that distillation is really a very\r\nsimple matter, for years practiced with a most rudimentary apparatus and\r\nstill so practiced in the country districts particularly in the South.\r\n\r\nThis is well illustrated by the fact that an illicit distiller confined\r\nin one of the North Carolina penitentiaries for transgressing the revenue\r\nlaws, was able while in durance, to continue his operations unknown to\r\nthe prison authorities, his plant consisting of a few buckets, and a\r\nstill whose body was a tin kettle, a few pieces of pipe and a worm which\r\nhe had bent himself. This example is not given as encouragement to\r\nillicit or \"blockade\" distilling but merely to show vividly how simple\r\nthe rudimentary apparatus really is.\r\n\r\nThe simplest regular plants, those of the South for instance, comprise a\r\nbuilding of rough lumber some thirty feet by twelve wide, with a wooden\r\nfloor on which the fermenting vats rest and an earthern floor immediately\r\nin front of the still and furnace. This is to permit the fires being\r\ndrawn when the charge has been exhausted in the boiler. The still is of\r\nthe fire-heated, intermittent variety, such as described on page 35. It\r\nconsists of a brick furnace or oven, large enough to burn ordinary cord\r\nwood and supporting a copper boiler of fifteen or twenty gallons\r\ncapacity. On top of this is a copper \"head\" with the usual goose neck,\r\nfrom which a copper pipe leads to a closed and locked barrel containing\r\nraw spirits, this barrel acting on the principle of the condensing\r\nchamber shown in the still in Fig. 8. From the upper part of this barrel,\r\nwhich acts as a concentrator, the vapors pass to a copper worm immersed\r\nin a tub of cold water. Here the vapors are condensed and pass by a pipe\r\nto a small room, containing a locked receiving tank. This room is kept\r\nlocked and is under the immediate charge of the Government officer in\r\ncharge of the still, or, in the case of alcohol intended for de-naturing,\r\nthe alcohol would pass to a locked tank from whence it would be taken and\r\nde-natured under the charge of the proper Government officer.\r\n\r\nThe fermenting vats may be six or more in number so as to allow the mash\r\nin each tank to be at a different stage of fermentation. A hand pump is\r\nused for pumping the contents of any of the tanks into the boiler or the\r\nstill. A hand pump is also provided for supplying water to the vats and\r\ncondensers.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the distilling and fermenting building there are small\r\nbuildings for storing the grain, malt, etc., for the storage of the\r\nalcohol and for the keeping of the various books, records, and stamps\r\nrequired by law. Such plants as these are located adjacent to a good\r\nclear spring or even a small brook, and preferably in a position\r\nconvenient to the carriage of materials and the transportation of the\r\nwhiskey or other liquor produced.\r\n\r\nThe buildings are of the cheapest construction and arranged in the\r\nmanner which compels the least labor in filling the mash vats and turning\r\nthe contents into spirits. There are no special mash coolers, no\r\ncomplicated stirrers. The \"beer\" as the fermented mash is called is\r\nstirred by a paddle in the hands of a strong negro and the mash is mixed\r\nand fermented by rule of thumb, without the use of any scientific\r\nappliances. Primitive, as it is, however, those small plants in certain\r\nsections of the country make money for their proprietors and serve a\r\nlarge number of customers. The spirits so produced are low grade, fiery\r\nand rough in taste, but the point is that alcohol may be and is so\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nBetween these simple beginnings and the elaborate plants of big\r\ndistilleries there is a wide range, so wide that it is impossible within\r\nthe limits of this book to go into detail. The makers of distilling\r\napparatus furnish all grades of stills and to those contemplating\r\nerecting a plant it is suggested that their best course is to communicate\r\nwith such manufacturers, giving the circumstances of the case, the\r\nparticular product to be worked and the capacity desired. The object of\r\nthis book is to give an understanding of the processes of distillation\r\nand of this chapter to give a general idea of the arrangement of a number\r\nof typical distilling plants, suitable for various kinds of work.\r\n\r\nThat the simple, direct-heated pot still such as referred to above, used\r\nfor fifteen hundred years and over, is still used is largely due to the\r\nsimplicity of its construction and operation, but its capacity is small,\r\nand its operating expense relatively heavy. It is still used for making\r\nliquors, but for industrial purposes it has been entirely superceded by\r\nconcentrating and rectifying stills. A simple form of the latter is found\r\nin the still shown in Fig. 11 and in the distilling apparatus of Adam\r\n(Fig. 9).\r\n\r\nOriginally all stills were heated by direct contact with fire. This was\r\nopen to a serious objection, namely, that the mash if thick was liable to\r\nbe scorched. Stirring devices were used by Pistorious but these required\r\nconstant attention. As a consequence, direct firing gave place to heating\r\nby steam, by which not only was scorching of the wash avoided but much\r\ngreater certainty of operation was attained.\r\n\r\nThe steam may be used to simply heat the boiler, thus taking the place of\r\nthe direct heat of the fire, but it is far better in every way to admit\r\nthe steam directly to the mash as in the Coffey still, Fig. 18, and all\r\nmodern stills. It is possible to apply this principle to all compound\r\nstills, but the best results with greatest economy of fuel are, of\r\ncourse, gotten from the plate or column stills especially constructed for\r\nsteam. In order to get the best results it is necessary that the entry of\r\nsteam be regulated so that there may be absolute uniformity of flow. A\r\nconvenient form of regulator is that invented by Savalle, and described\r\non page 70, hut there are a number of other forms on the market each one\r\nhaving its special advantages.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen then that while the simple pot still, fire-heated, may be\r\nused, the practical plant for the fermentation of industrial alcohol\r\nshould have a modern continuous still and rectifier and a boiler for\r\ngenerating the necessary steam for it and for the operations of mashing\r\nand fermenting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FERMENTING ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe fermenting room has three main requirements for successful commercial\r\ndistillation. It must allow a uniform temperature to be maintained in the\r\nvats; it must have thorough ventilation without any draftiness, and it\r\nmust be absolutely clean. It should have also plenty of light so that it\r\nmay be thoroughly inspected. It is true that in the primitive plants all\r\nthese requisites were violated, but there is no reason for this. The\r\nfirst cost is but little added to by building with these requisites in\r\nmind and it is far more profitable in the long run; and it is only by the\r\nelimination of the bacteria which are inimical to proper fermentation\r\nthat the fermenting operation can be performed with any certainty.\r\n\r\nFor the regulation of the temperature reliance may be had on stoves or\r\nheaters, or on special mash heaters and coolers by which the temperature\r\nof the mash in the tubs may itself be controlled without reference to\r\nthe temperature of the fermenting room. When, however, no special and\r\nadequate-heating means is provided, the walls should be double with an\r\nair space between and the doors and windows should either be also double\r\nor limited in number.\r\n\r\nTo ensure good ventilation and plenty of space above the vats wherein to\r\nwork or install suitable vatting machinery, the walls should be at least\r\ntwelve feet in height. Outlet openings should be formed around the base\r\nof the room leading to the outer air and closed by controllable shutters.\r\nThese are to allow the escape of the carbonic acid gas evolved during\r\nfermentation. These should be most carefully constructed, however, to\r\nprevent drafts.\r\n\r\nThe walls and floor of the fermenting rooms should be so made that they\r\nmay be easily washed down and kept clean. Concrete floors are excellent\r\nfor this purpose and the walls also may be faced with concrete or cement\r\ncovered with a coating composed of a mixture of asphalt and coal tar.\r\nThis mixture may be also applied to plaster walls with good results.\r\n\r\nThe fermenting vats, as before stated, are made of wood for small plants,\r\nand of iron for larger plants, and are usually from three and a half to\r\nfour and a half feet in height. After the chief fermenting period, it is\r\nnecessary that the temperature of the mash be prevented from rising\r\nbeyond 86∞ F. and to that end movable cooling tubes, coils and stirrers\r\nare used. These consist of parallel frames made up of tubes, preferably\r\nof copper, through which cold water is passed and which are moved about\r\nin the vat, either vertically or rotatively. There must be space above\r\nthe vats, therefore, for the introduction and removal of these cooling\r\nframes, and for the gearing whereby they are driven.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, mashes to-day are mostly prepared by steaming and\r\ndisintegrating in a mash cooker of the type shown in Figs. 1 and 41 or in\r\nHenze steamers, from which the mash is blown into the preparatory mash\r\nvat, where it is stirred and brought to the proper temperature for\r\nfermentation. A convenient arrangement of mash cooker, coolers, pump and\r\nvats is shown in Fig. 1. Where Henze steamers are used they are arranged\r\nin batteries, the blow-off pipes being connected to the preparatory mash\r\nvats. These are preferably provided with water cooled stirrers consisting\r\nof a frame of straight and vertical tubes mounted on a tubular arm\r\nprojecting from a tubular shaft, and rotated in a horizontal plane within\r\nthe closed mash vats, by suitable gears. The rotation of the arm stirs\r\nand automatically mixes the mash while cooling it. Another form of cooler\r\nis shown diagrammatically in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nWhatever form of cooling apparatus is used, attention should be paid to\r\nthe ease with which the stirrers or tubes can be kept clean, and to the\r\nstrength of the apparatus, gears, etc. Concentrated or thick mashes\r\nrequire that the stirrers be of massive construction, capable of being\r\nrapidly rotated in the liquid.\r\n\r\nIn preparatory mash vats for use with concentrated mashes, means must\r\nalso be provided for clearing the mash. These mash cleaners and husk\r\nremovers usually form part of, or are attached to the vat itself and are\r\ndriven by gearing from the main shaft carrying power to the mashing room.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the general arrangement and correlation of the various\r\napparatus of a plant may be gathered from the sectional view of a grain\r\ndistillery shown in Fig. 55. It will be seen from this that the mashing\r\napparatus, steamers and mixers are located on the several floors of one\r\nbuilding and in such relation to each other that the several operations\r\nof saccharifying are carried on in a continuous movement of mash towards\r\nthe fermenting vats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Continuous Grain Alcohol Distillery--Barbet's\r\nSystem.]\r\n\r\nAdjoining the fermenting vat room is a section of the plant given up to\r\nthe manufacture of pure yeast and this and the fermenting rooms are level\r\nwith the ground, have solid walls whereby a uniform temperature is\r\nobtained, and plenty of space for proper ventilation of the vats. A\r\ngallery traverses the room about midway the height of the vats so that\r\nconvenient access may be had to them. The distilling room is high enough\r\nto allow for the setting of the various columns, separators and\r\ncondensers at their proper heights relative to each other, and should\r\nbe so arranged as to its several floors or stages that access to the\r\nvarious pipes and apparatus may be easily had. The steam generator for\r\nthe column is located in an adjacent room.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this there should be a malt house for the preparation of\r\nmalt, located conveniently to the saccharifying building; an engine and\r\nboiler room so placed that power may be conveniently transferred to the\r\nmixers, stirrers and pumps and to generate steam for the Henze boilers;\r\nwhile adjacent to the distilling building should be the storage tanks and\r\nde-naturing department.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Grain Distillery. Capacity 2,500 Bushels per\r\nday. (_To face page 198_)]\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement of apparatus for a grain distillery with a capacity\r\nof 2500 bushels per day is illustrated in Fig. 56. This plant was erected\r\nby the Vulcan Copper Works Co., and includes separate stills for gin,\r\nalcohol, and rye whiskey, as well as a spirit rectifying column.\r\n\r\nThe milling and grain mixing departments, the yeast room and the\r\nfermenting room are arranged on the several floors of one building, in\r\nthe basement of which is located the vacuum cooker and drop tub and\r\ncoolers described on page 11 from which the mash is pumped into the\r\nfermenting tubs.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the building contains the distilling apparatus,\r\nstorage tanks, charcoal rectifiers and spirit rectifying apparatus, while\r\nthe third section of the building comprises the boiler house and engine\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57--Small Beet Distillery.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 57 is shown a view of a small plant for the distillation of\r\nbeets, the figure giving a good idea of the arrangement of the\r\ndiffusion battery in relation to the still and rectifier. The juice from\r\nthe diffusion battery is pumped into the overhead tanks from which it\r\ndescends into a dephlegmator and from thence into the still, the vapors\r\nfrom the still passing into the rectifier. The still is a direct,\r\nfire-heated still and adjacent to the still is a water heater from which\r\nthe water passes to the hot water reservoir located above and to one side\r\nof the diffusion vats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Large Beet Distillery.]\r\n\r\nA large plant for the distillation of beets is shown in the Section Fig.\r\n58. The beets from the beet silos are carried to suitable washing\r\nmachines, _A_, see Chapter VII, in which they are thoroughly cleaned of\r\ndirt and gravel. From the washers they are lifted by a conveyor _B_ to a\r\ndistributor _C_ by which they are conveyed to the cutters or slicers.\r\nThese consist of horizontal apertured plates revolving at a high speed,\r\nand carry knives which plane off slices from the beets. These drop\r\nthrough the apertures of the plate and are conveyed to the diffusion\r\nbatteries, as by a movable chute _D_ oscillated with a jigging motion\r\nthrough suitable gearing.\r\n\r\nThe diffusers _F_ should be arranged so that small trucks may be driven\r\nbeneath them to receive the spent slices and carry them to the spent beet\r\nsilos. _U_ indicates a gauging tank into which the juice runs from the\r\ndiffusers. From thence it passes to coolers (not seen) and thence to the\r\nfermentation tanks _G_. _R_ indicates a small engine for driving the\r\nbeet slicers and _S_ a battery of pumps whereby the wash may be forced up\r\ninto the reservoir _I_ from which the wash descends into the still _K_.\r\n_H_ and _J_ are reservoirs for hot and cold water respectively.\r\n\r\nFrom the distilling column _K_ the phlegm or raw spirit passes to the\r\nphlegm tank _L_ from which it is drawn as desired into the rectifying\r\ncolumn _M_, thence into the coolers and condensers and thence into the\r\nalcohol tanks _N_.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the building as indicated by the chimney is the\r\nboiler for generating the motive power for the plant and for supplying\r\nthe steam necessary for the distilling and rectifying columns and the hot\r\nwater for the diffusion batteries. The boiler should be very capacious\r\nand it would be well to have two, one in reserve.\r\n\r\nIf possible, advantage should be taken of the natural slope of the ground\r\nso that the trucks bringing beets from the silo to the washer and\r\ncarrying the spent beets away may roll downward by their own weight. The\r\nsilos for the spent beets should be excavated from the ground and the\r\ntrucks be constructed to tip their contents into these pits. The natural\r\nslope of the bottom of these pits should drain away the water and means\r\nbe provided whereby carts can load with the spent beets to carry them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe spent liquors should flow off into ponds from which they may be drawn\r\naway to fertilize land.\r\n\r\nA very convenient method of carrying beets from the silos to the washing\r\nmachine is by means of a narrow canal of rapidly flowing water, flowing\r\nbetween the silos and entering the washing machines. Beets pitched into\r\nthis stream are carried along by the current to the washers and at the\r\nsame time undergo a preliminary washing. By laying out a system of\r\nchannels throughout the beet yard the labor of handling is reduced to a\r\nminimum. These channels may be covered by boards on which the beets may\r\nbe piled. These may be lifted and the beets thereon dumped into the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nA plant for the distillation of potatoes would be arranged very much\r\nafter the plan of the grain distillery heretofore described except that\r\nit would have to be provided with apparatus for washing the potatoes and\r\nremoving stones and adhering clods of earth. These washers, as put on the\r\nmarket, comprise a slotted rotating drum, which tumbles the potatoes\r\nabout and loosens the dirt. When they escape from the drum they enter a\r\nwashing trough where they are stirred about by revolving blades and acted\r\nupon by a swift current of water. The trough should be about two feet\r\nlong to properly wash the potatoes. They are then lifted by an elevator\r\nto the mouth of the Henze pulpers (see Fig. 2) or the vacuum cookers see\r\nFig. 1).\r\n\r\nIt is of advantage that the washing apparatus be so located that the\r\npotatoes as they are received may be shoveled into it immediately. The\r\nscale for weighing the potatoes as they are brought in should be so\r\nlocated that the manager may attend to the weighing without having to\r\nleave the distillery. This and other like details may seem of small\r\nmoment but it is care in such details which conduces to the success of a\r\nplant. As before stated in describing a beet distillery, advantage should\r\nbe taken of the lay of the land in laying out the plant so that the spent\r\npulp may be easily disposed of, the spent wash carried away, and the\r\nfinished product conveniently handled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Molasses Distillery. Capacity 2,500 gallons per\r\nday.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 59, is shown a plant for distilling molasses, designed by the\r\nVulcan Copper Works, before referred to, and erected for the Rio Tamposo\r\nSugar Co., of Tamposo, S. L. P., Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe molasses as before explained at page 164 being too concentrated, is\r\nfirst pumped into the steam mixing tank on the ground floor of the\r\ndistilling building. Here it is diluted and heated, mixed with sulphuric\r\nacid and pumped into the long ranges of cooling pipes, located along the\r\nfermenting room and built on the principle shown in Fig. 4. Here it is\r\nfurther diluted and yeast is added. From the fermenting tubs the molasses\r\nbeer is pumped into the beer heater and thence into such a still as is\r\nshown in Fig. 32.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the plant contains a rectifying apparatus for the\r\nhigh wines produced by the beer still, comprising a spirit still, charged\r\nfrom a high wine tank, a rectifying column, separator, and tubular\r\ncondenser from which the rectified spirit is carried to the storage\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\nCane sugar distilleries are practically arranged the same as the molasses\r\ndistillery above described. The cane is crushed between the rolls of cane\r\ncrushers on the receiving floor and is then strained to remove the\r\n\"begasse.\" The clarified juice is then pumped up to the mixing tanks. In\r\nthese the molasses is mixed with spent wash from other fermentations or\r\nwith water, after which it is acidified and flows to the fermenting vats.\r\nThe fermenting house should be provided with means for forcing in\r\nfiltered air and for ventilating, as molasses wash is very sensitive to\r\nchange in temperature and very liable to become contaminated by injurious\r\nferments. (See Fig. 60).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Molasses Fermenting House.]\r\n\r\nAbove each vat should be a cooling coil capable of being lowered into the\r\nvat and a water spraying pipe, whereby the mash may be diluted when\r\ndesired. From the vats, the wash is pumped to the distilling and\r\nrectifying columns. In Jamaica the still shown in Fig. 37, is largely\r\nused, as also the Coffey still, Fig. 18.\r\n\r\nIt is very often not profitable to distill spirit from molasses or sugar\r\ncane directly at the sugar factories, there being no market on the spot\r\nand transportation of the spirit in casks being very costly and\r\ndifficult, not only because of the lack of transporting means but because\r\nthe tropical climate tends to warp the empty casks. Transportation of the\r\nmolasses in casks to a distillery is likewise open to objections of cost\r\nand the action of the hot sun in fermenting the molasses and bursting the\r\ncask.\r\n\r\nBarbet has suggested a way out of the difficulty. This consists in\r\nboiling the molasses in vacuo, and then running it into molds lined with\r\nsheets of paper. These are set by dipping in cold water. When set the\r\nloaves wrapped in their paper coverings are as easily handled as sugar\r\nloaves. There is no dead weight nor any \"empties\" to be returned as in\r\nthe case of casks. The molasses is in a most concentrated form and this\r\nmakes for economy in freight. There is no risk of deterioration and the\r\nloaves may be stored in an ordinary warehouse. This method allows the\r\ndistillery to be located at centers of transportation or at seaports,\r\nwhile the sugar factories are on the plantation.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken in selecting the site for a distillery that an\r\nabundance of pure water may be supplied. The purer the water the better,\r\nand where water is not pure, purifying apparatus should be provided. The\r\ncoolness of the water is a factor which must be taken into consideration.\r\nThe greater amount of water will be used for cooling, and it follows then\r\nthat the cooler the water the less of it will have to be used.\r\n\r\nThe horse-power of the engines used in driving the distilling apparatus\r\nvaries, of course, with the capacity of the still, the average being\r\nbetween 6 H.P. and 30 H.P., for plants having fermenting vats of\r\ncapacities ranging between two hundred and fifty, and twelve hundred\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the coal consumption of a plant depends\r\nupon the economy of heating means in the distilling apparatus, the\r\nperfection with which the heat of the vapors is used to heat the wash,\r\nthe perfection of the boiler grates and the method of firing. These\r\nlatter matters should be obvious to any distiller, but it is in economy\r\nin little things that the successful operation of a plant resides.\r\n\r\nNothing is more surprising than the difference in the coal consumption of\r\ndifferent distilleries. Some use a third more than others. This is caused\r\nby poor coal, by poor firing, by poor boilers, by hard water, or by poor\r\ndistilling equipment. With regard to the latter this word of advice may\r\nbe given: The greater the number of plates in the distilling column, the\r\nless the coal consumed per gallon of alcohol produced. It must, however,\r\nbe taken into account that a large number of plates in a column means a\r\ncolumn of considerable height and that in turn means a correspondingly\r\ntall still house and increased first cost. Hence it is more economical to\r\nuse the best forms of traps on the plates and fewer plates, and the best\r\nforms of these traps as pointed out in Chapter III, are those wherein the\r\nlargest quantity of vapor in a finely divided state may come into contact\r\nwith the greatest number of liquid particles.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be said that dirt, neglect, carelessness and a too\r\ngreat desire for economy in first cost are all factors in lowering the\r\neconomical productiveness as well in a distillery as in other\r\nmanufacturing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n               DE-NATURED ALCOHOL AND DE-NATURING FORMUL∆\r\n\r\n\r\nThe uses of alcohol are very numerous and varied, the principal being, of\r\ncourse, for the production of all alcoholic liquors such as brandy, gin,\r\nrum, whiskey, liquors, etc.; that distilled from grain is almost entirely\r\nconsumed in the manufacture of whiskey, gin, and British brandy. In the\r\narts, strong alcohol is employed by the perfumers and makers of essences\r\nfor dissolving essential oils, soaps, etc., and for extracting the odor\r\nof flowers and plants; by the varnish-makers for dissolving resins; by\r\nphotographers in the preparation of collodion; by the pharmaceutists in\r\nthe preparation of tinctures and other valuable medicaments; by chemists\r\nin many analytical operations, and in the manufacture of numerous\r\npreparations; by instrument makers in the manufacture of delicate\r\nthermometers; by the anatomist and naturalist as an antiseptic; and in\r\nmedicine, both in a concentrated form (rectified spirit), and diluted\r\n(proof spirit, brandy, etc.), as a stimulant, tonic, or irritant, and for\r\nvarious applications as a remedy. It is largely consumed in the\r\nmanufacture of vinegar; and in the form of methylated spirit it is used\r\nin lamps for producing heat. It has, in fact, been employed for a\r\nmultitude of purposes which it is almost impossible to enumerate.\r\n\r\nThe common form of alcohol known as \"de-natured spirit\" consists of\r\nalcohol to which one tenth of its volume of wood alcohol, or other\r\nde-naturizing agents has been added, for the purpose of rendering the\r\nmixture undrinkable through its offensive odor and taste. Methylated\r\nspirit being sold tax free, may be applied by chemical manufacturers,\r\nvarnish makers, and many others, to a variety of uses, to which, from its\r\ngreater cost, duty-paid spirit is commercially inapplicable. Its use,\r\nhowever, in the preparation of tinctures, sweet spirits of nitre, etc.,\r\nhas been prohibited by law. It has often been attempted to separate the\r\nwood spirit from the alcohol, and thus to obtain pure alcohol from the\r\nmixture, but always unsuccessfully, as, although the former boils at a\r\nlower temperature than the latter, when boiled they both distil over\r\ntogether, owing probably to the difference of their vapor densities.\r\n\r\nIt is Germany which has led the way in the manufacture and use of\r\n\"de-natured\" alcohol or \"spiritus,\" as it is there known. Germany has no\r\nnatural gas or oil wells, and gasoline and kerosene are not produced\r\nthere, hence the necessity of using some other form of liquid fuel. This\r\nfuel--in many ways better than any petroleum product--was found in\r\nalcohol. The sandy plains of northern Germany, and indeed any\r\nagricultural district of that empire, produce abundant crops of potatoes\r\nand beets.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, alcohol can be so easily manufactured that the processes\r\nare within the understanding and ability of any farmer. The second is\r\nused in the manufacture of beet sugar,--one of the great German\r\nindustries, and the crude molasses, from a refuse product,--still\r\ncontains from 40 to 50 per cent. of sugar, from which alcohol can be\r\nmade. Under these circumstances and the great demand for liquid fuel for\r\nmotor carriages and gas engines, alcohol for \"de-naturing\" came rapidly\r\nto the front as one of the most important of agricultural products, as\r\none of the most valuable \"crops\" which a farmer could raise. Potatoes are\r\nchiefly raised. The potatoes are grown by the farmers and manufactured\r\ninto alcohol in individual farm distilleries and in cooperative\r\ndistilleries.\r\n\r\nWhile England and France were somewhat behind Germany in fostering this\r\nindustry--yet they both were far ahead of the United States in this\r\nmatter. De-natured alcohol could be readily gotten in these countries,\r\nfor industrial purposes, while the United States continued to charge a\r\nhigh internal revenue tax on all but wood alcohol. This prevented the use\r\nof alcohol in competition with gasoline or kerosene, and limited its use\r\nin arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 1906, however, Congress passed the \"De-naturing Act,\" as it is\r\ncalled, which provided in brief that alcohol, which had been mixed with\r\na certain proportion of de-naturing materials sufficient to prevent its\r\nuse as a beverage should not be taxed.\r\n\r\nThe passage of this Act was alcohol's new day, and is destined to have a\r\nwide influence upon the agricultural pursuits of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of small engines and motors alone one estimate places the\r\nfarm use of these at three hundred thousand with an annual increase of\r\none hundred thousand. This means an economical displacing of horse and\r\nmuscle power in farm work almost beyond comprehension. If now the farmer\r\ncan make from surplus or cheaply grown crops the very alcohol which is to\r\nfurnish the cheaper fuel for his motors, he is placed in a still more\r\nindependent and commanding position in the industrial race.\r\n\r\nAs an illuminant the untaxed alcohol is bound to introduce some\r\ninteresting as well as novel conditions. The general estimate of the\r\nvalue of alcohol for lighting gives it about double the power of\r\nkerosene, a gallon of alcohol lasting as two gallons of the oil. In\r\nGermany, where the use of alcohol in lamps is most fully developed, a\r\nmantle is used. Thus in a short time it may be expected that an entirely\r\nnew industry will spring up to meet the demand for the illuminating lamps\r\nembodying the latest approved form of mantle. The adapting of the\r\ngasoline motors of automobiles to alcohol fuel will in itself create a\r\nvast new manufacturing undertaking. When this is accomplished it is\r\nbelieved that we shall no more be troubled with the malodorous gasoline\r\n\"auto\" and \"cycle\" burners on our public streets and parkways.\r\n\r\nDe-natured alcohol is simply alcohol which has been so treated, as to\r\nspoil it for use as a beverage or medicine, and prevent its use in any\r\nmanner except for industrial purposes.\r\n\r\nDe-naturing may be accomplished in many ways.\r\n\r\nIn England a mixture suitable for industrial purposes, but unfit for any\r\nother use, is made by mixing 90 per cent. of ethyl alcohol (alcohol made\r\nfrom grain, potatoes, beets, etc.), with 10 per cent. of methyl or \"wood\r\nalcohol.\" Under the new law the proportion of wood alcohol is cut to five\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIn Canada \"methylated spirits,\" as it is known, is composed of from 25\r\nper cent. to 50 per cent. of wood alcohol mixed with ethyl alcohol. This\r\nproportion of wood alcohol is far more than is required in any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the de-naturing law passed in 1887 was so framed as to\r\nmaintain the high revenue tax on alcohol intended for drinking, but to\r\nexempt from taxation such as should be de-naturized and used for\r\nindustrial purposes. De-naturing is accomplished by mixing with the\r\nspirit a small proportion of some foreign substance, which, while not\r\ninjuring its efficiency for technical uses, renders it unfit for\r\nconsumption as a beverage. The de-naturing substances employed depend\r\nupon the use to which the alcohol is to be subsequently applied. They\r\ninclude pyridin, picolin, benzol, toluol, and xylol, wood vinegar, and\r\nseveral other similar products. As a result of this system Germany\r\nproduced and used last year 100,000,000 gallons of de-natured spirits, as\r\ncompared with 10,302,630 gallons used in 1886, the last year before the\r\nenactment of the present law.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the other de-naturants used in Germany:\r\nCamphor, oil of turpentine, sulphuric ether, animal oil, chloroform,\r\niodoform, ethyl bromide, benzine, castor oil, lye.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n              In France the standard mixture consists of:\r\n\r\n                      150 liters of Ethyl alcohol,\r\n                       15 liters of wood alcohol,\r\n                      1/2 liter of heavy benzine,\r\n                        1 gram. Malachite green.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of de-naturing on a large scale is given by the methods\r\nand operations of a large London establishment. On the ground floor are\r\nfour large iron tanks holding about 2500 gallons each. On the next floor\r\nare casks of spirit brought under seal from the bonded warehouse. On the\r\nthird floor are the wood alcohol tanks, and on the fourth floor cans of\r\nmethylating materials. On the fourth floor the covers to the wood alcohol\r\ntanks were removed (these tank covers were flush with that floor) and the\r\ncontents gauged and tested. The quantity to be put into the tanks on the\r\nfirst floor was run off through pipes connecting with the first-floor\r\ntanks and the upper tanks relocked. Then going to the second floor, each\r\ncask of the grain spirit was gauged and tested and the tank covers, which\r\nwere flush with the floor, were removed and the casks of the grain spirit\r\nwere run into the tanks below. The mixture was then stirred with\r\nlong-handled wooden paddles and the tank covers replaced, and the\r\nmaterial was ready for sale free of tax. The mixture was 10 per cent.\r\nwood alcohol and 90 per cent. ethyl alcohol made from molasses, and was\r\nwhat is known as the ordinary methylating spirit used for manufacturing\r\npurposes only and used under bond. The completely de-natured spirit is\r\nmade by adding to the foregoing three-eighths of one per cent. of\r\nbenzine.\r\n\r\nThis benzine prevents re-distillation.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there are at present two general formulas for\r\nde-natured alcohol in use, either one of which may be used by any\r\nmanufacturer, who can use de-natured alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe first and most common one is made up as follows:\r\n\r\n                       Ethyl Alcohol 100 gallons.\r\n                       Methyl  \"      10     \"\r\n                       Benzine       1/2     \"\r\n\r\nWhere such a formula as this is required in an aqueous solution the\r\nbenzine is of course thrown out, giving the solution a milky appearance.\r\nIn this case the other general formula may be used.\r\n\r\n                      Ethyl Alcohol  100 gallons.\r\n                      Methyl  \"        2   \"\r\n                      Pyridine Bases 1/2   \"\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two general formulas for de-natured alcohol a number\r\nof special formulas have been authorized to be used in the manufacture of\r\ncertain classes of goods. In order to buy these specially de-natured\r\nalcohols it is necessary, of course, to obtain a permit first from your\r\nCollector of Internal Revenue, a simple permit to use de-natured alcohol\r\nwill not suffice.

The greater part of the 60,000,000 gallons of alcohol\r\nconsumed in the United States is used in the manufacture of whiskey and\r\nother beverages. The revenue tax prevents the use of alcohol to any great\r\nextent in the industries of the country. The bill passed by Congress in\r\n1906, designed to promote the use of untaxed alcohol in the arts and as\r\nfuel, took effect January 1, 1907. The first effect of free alcohol\r\nwould, it was said, supplant the 12,000,000 gallons of wood alcohol which\r\nare used in the manufacture of paint, varnishes, shellacs, and other\r\npurposes. Another use that is expected of de-natured alcohol is in the\r\nmanufacture of certain products, such as dyestuffs and chemicals, which\r\ncan not now be manufactured commercially in this country because of the\r\nhigh cost of alcohol, and which are imported largely from Europe. A very\r\nrapid development of the industry of manufacturing chemicals as a result\r\nof free alcohol is looked for. In the production of alcohol there is\r\nalways formed as a by-product a certain amount of fusel oil, which is\r\nvery useful in manufacturing lacquers which are used on metallic\r\nsubstances, fine hardware, gas fixtures, and similar articles. The\r\nindustries manufacturing these wares will undoubtedly receive a great\r\nstimulus as a result of cheaper fusel oil caused by the increased\r\nproduction of alcohol.\r\n\r\n=A Safe Fuel.= The use of de-natured alcohol as a fuel has yet to be\r\nfully developed. Although alcohol has only about half the heating power\r\nof kerosene or gasoline, gallon for gallon, yet it has many valuable\r\nproperties which may enable it to compete successfully in spite of its\r\nlower fuel value. In the first place it is very much safer. Alcohol has a\r\ntendency to simply heat the surrounding vapors and produce currents of\r\nhot gases which are not usually brought to high enough temperature to\r\ninflame articles at a distance. It can be easily diluted with water, and\r\nwhen it is diluted to more than one-half it ceases to be inflammable.\r\nHence it may be readily extinguished; while burning gasoline, by floating\r\non the water, simply spreads its flame when water is applied to it.\r\nAlthough alcohol has far less heating capacity than gasoline, the best\r\nexperts believe that it will develop a much higher percentage of\r\nefficiency in motors than does gasoline. Since gasoline represents only\r\nabout two per cent. of the petroleum which is refined, its supply is\r\nlimited and its price must constantly rise in view of the enormous demand\r\nmade for it for automobiles and gasoline engines in general. This will\r\nopen a new opportunity for de-natured alcohol. Industrial alcohol is now\r\nused in Germany in small portable lamps, which give it all the effects of\r\na mantel burner heated by gas. The expense for alcohol is only about\r\ntwo-thirds as much per candle-power as is the cost of kerosene. Even at\r\n25 or 30 cents a gallon, de-natured alcohol can successfully compete with\r\nkerosene as a means of lighting.\r\n\r\nObjection has been made to the use of alcohol in automobiles and other\r\ninternal-explosive engines, that it resulted in a corrosion of the metal.\r\nThis is vigorously denied by the advocate of alcohol fuel and the denial\r\nis backed by proofs of the use of alcohol in German engines for a number\r\nof years without any bad results.\r\n\r\nA recent exhibition in Germany gave a good illustration of the broad\r\nfield in which de-natured alcohol may be used.\r\n\r\nHere were shown alcohol engines of a large number of different makes,\r\nalcohol boat motors as devised for the Russian navy, and motors for\r\nthreshing, grinding, wood-cutting, and other agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nThe department of lighting apparatus included a large and varied display\r\nof lamps, chandeliers, and street and corridor lights, in which alcohol\r\nvapor is burned like gas in a hooded flame covered by a Welsbach mantle.\r\nUnder such conditions alcohol vapor burns with an incandescent flame\r\nwhich rivals the arc light in brilliancy and requires to be shaded to\r\nadopt it to the endurance of the human eye. There has been each year a\r\ngreat improvement in the artistic models and finish of lamps and\r\nchandeliers for alcohol lighting. At the beginning they were simple and\r\nof rather ordinary appearance, but now they are up to the best standard\r\nof modern fixtures for gas and electricity, with which alcohol lighting\r\nis now competing with increasing success in that country.\r\n\r\nSimilarly attractive and interesting was the large display of alcohol\r\nheating stoves, which, for warming corridors, sleeping rooms, and certain\r\nother locations, are highly esteemed. They are made of japanned-iron\r\nplate in decorative forms, with concave copper reflectors, are readily\r\nportable, and, when provided with chimney connections for the escape of\r\nthe gases of combustion, furnish a clean, odorless, and convenient\r\nheating apparatus.\r\n\r\nCooking stoves of all sizes, forms, and capacities, from the complete\r\nrange, with baking and roasting ovens, broilers, etc., to the simple tea\r\nand coffee lamp, were also displayed in endless variety.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to give an idea of the capabilities and values of\r\nthis new form of fuel,--at least, and as far as the United States is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nWith its advent not only will American genius perfect the machinery for\r\nits use, but the American farmer is given a new market for his crops.\r\n\r\nDistilleries, big and little, are likely to be set up all over the\r\ncountry, and the time is not far distant when the farmer will be able to\r\ncarry his corn to his local distillery, and either return with the money\r\nin his pocket, or with fuel for farm engines, machinery, and perchance\r\nhis automobile.\r\n\r\nWhen our government shall have become as far-sighted as the German\r\ngovernment in this matter, every farmer will be able to manufacture his\r\nown de-natured spirits. The wisdom of the German system established by\r\nthe law of 1887 has long ceased to be a question of debate. For every\r\nreichsmark of revenue sacrificed by exempting de-natured spirits from\r\ntaxation the empire and its people have profited ten-fold by the stimulus\r\nwhich has been thereby given to agriculture and the industrial arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FREE ALCOHOL ACT OF 1906, THE AMENDMENT OF 1907 AND INTERNAL REVENUE\r\n                              REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PUBLIC--NO. 201.\r\n\r\nAn Act for the withdrawal from bond, tax free, of domestic alcohol when\r\nrendered unfit for beverage or liquid medicinal uses by mixture with\r\nsuitable de-naturing materials.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That from and after January\r\nfirst, nineteen hundred and seven, domestic alcohol of such degree of\r\nproof as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and\r\napproved by the Secretary of the Treasury, may be withdrawn from bond\r\nwithout the payment of internal-revenue tax, for use in the arts and\r\nindustries, and for fuel, light, and power, provided said alcohol shall\r\nhave been mixed in the presence and under the direction of an authorized\r\nGovernment officer, after withdrawal from the distillery warehouse, With\r\nmethyl alcohol or other de-naturing material or materials, or admixture\r\nof the same, suitable to the use for which the alcohol is withdrawn, but\r\nwhich destroys its character as a beverage and renders it unfit for\r\nliquid medicinal purposes; such de-naturing to be done upon the\r\napplication of any registered distillery in de-naturing bonded warehouses\r\nspecially designated or set apart for de-naturing purposes only, and\r\nunder conditions prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with\r\nthe approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe character and quantity of the said de-naturing material and the\r\nconditions upon which said alcohol may be withdrawn free of tax shall be\r\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who shall, with the\r\napproval of the Secretary of the Treasury, make all necessary regulations\r\nfor carrying into effect the provisions of this Act.\r\n\r\nDistillers, manufacturers, dealers and all other persons furnishing,\r\nhandling or using alcohol withdrawn from bond under the provisions of\r\nthis Act shall keep such books and records, execute such bonds and render\r\nsuch returns as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval\r\nof the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation require.

As soon as the stamped packages of de-natured alcohol are empty\r\nthe dealer or manufacturer, as the case may be, must thoroughly\r\nobliterate and completely destroy all marks, stamps, and brands on the\r\npackages.\r\n\r\nThe stamps shall under no circumstances be re-used, and the packages\r\nshall not be refilled until _all_ the marks, stamps, and brands shall\r\nhave been removed and destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  MANUFACTURERS USING COMPLETELY DE-NATURED ALCOHOL TO SECURE PERMIT.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 75. Manufacturers desiring to use completely de-natured alcohol,\r\nsuch as is put upon the market for sale generally, may use such alcohol\r\nin their business subject to the following restrictions:\r\n\r\nA manufacturer using less than an average of 50 gallons of de-natured\r\nalcohol per month will not be required to secure permit from the\r\ncollector or to keep records or make returns showing the alcohol received\r\nand used.\r\n\r\nManufacturers who use as much as 50 gallons of completely de-natured\r\nalcohol a month must procure such alcohol in stamped packages, and before\r\nbeginning business the manufacturer must make application to the\r\ncollector of the proper district for permit, in which application he will\r\nstate the exact location of his place of business, describing the lot or\r\ntract of land upon which the plant is located, and must keep the alcohol\r\nin a locked room until used.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 79. As the agents adapted to and adopted for use in complete\r\nde-naturation render the alcohol de-natured unfit for use in many\r\nindustries in which ethyl alcohol, withdrawn free of tax, can be\r\nprofitably employed, therefore in order to give full scope to the\r\noperation of the law, special de-naturants will be authorized when\r\nabsolutely necessary. Yet the strictest surveillance must be exercised in\r\nthe handling of alcohol incompletely or specially de-natured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  FORMULA FOR SPECIAL DE-NATURANTS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSIONER.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 80. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue will consider any formula\r\nfor special de-naturation that may be submitted by any manufacturer in\r\nany art or industry and will determine (1) whether or not the manufacture\r\nin which it is proposed to use the alcohol belongs to a class in which\r\ntax-free alcohol withdrawn under the provisions of this act can be used.\r\n(2) whether or not it is practicable to permit the use of the proposed\r\nde-naturant and at the same time properly safeguard the revenue. But one\r\nspecial de-naturant will be authorized for the same class of industries,\r\nunless it shall be shown that there is good reason for additional special\r\nde-naturants.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner will announce from time to time the formulas of\r\nde-naturants that will be permitted in the several classes of industries\r\nin which tax-free alcohol can be used.\r\n\r\nThe specially or incompletely de-natured alcohol can only be used by\r\nspecial permission, for which the manufacturer must apply, at the same\r\ntime giving full details as to business, plant, premises, the special\r\nde-naturants desired to be used, and the reason therefor, etc. (Section\r\n81).\r\n\r\nSection 82 recites the necessary requirements as to storerooms, etc., and\r\nSections 83 to 87 relate to the form of application and the inspection of\r\nthe plant. Section 88 recites the form of bond necessary to be given by\r\nthe manufacturer, and Sections 89 to 104 relate to the general\r\nrequirements as to records, books, affidavits, etc.\r\n\r\nSections 105 and 106 rule that the alcohol must be used just as received,\r\nand as called for in the permit, and that a manufacturer quitting\r\nbusiness may dispose of his specially de-natured alcohol to other\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO MANUFACTURERS USING EITHER SPECIALLY OR\r\n                     GENERALLY DE-NATURED ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 107. Under no circumstances will de-naturers, manufacturers, or\r\ndealers, or any other persons, in any manner treat either specially or\r\ncompletely de-natured alcohol by adding anything to it or taking anything\r\nfrom it until it is ready for the use for which it is to be employed. It\r\nmust go into manufacture or consumption in exactly the same condition\r\nthat it was when it left the de-naturer. Diluting completely de-natured\r\nalcohol will be held to be such manipulation as is forbidden by law.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 108. Manufacturers using either specially or completely de-natured\r\nalcohol must store it in the storeroom set apart for that purpose, the\r\nplace for deposit named in the bond and application, and nowhere else.\r\nLikewise they must deposit recovered alcohol in said storeroom as fast as\r\nit is recovered. It will be held to be a breach of the bond and a\r\nviolation of the law if any alcohol of any kind, character, or\r\ndescription should be found stored at any other place on the premises.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of special de-naturants is one of great importance to the\r\nmanufacturer, and should be carefully studied. The distiller who succeeds\r\non a large scale will be he who is most expert in preparing alcohol\r\nspecially de-natured to suit the requirements of the various arts.\r\nGermany has done most in this line, and the German practice should be\r\ncarefully studied.\r\n\r\nParts IV and V of the Rules relate to that portion of the De-Naturing\r\nAct, referred to in Section 2 thereof--the recovering, restoring and\r\nre-de-naturing of alcohol used by manufacturers employing processes in\r\nwhich the formerly de-natured spirits are? expressed, or evaporated. This\r\nnot being within the plan of this book, the rules relating thereto are\r\nnot quoted.\r\n\r\nThose desirous of acquiring full information as to the rules regulating\r\nthe operation of distilleries for the manufacture of alcohol and\r\nde-natured spirits can procure the same by applying either to the\r\ncollectors of Internal Revenue for their respective districts or to the\r\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE DE-NATURING ACT.\r\n\r\nThe De-naturing Act as passed and the regulations thereunder are\r\nundoubtedly too complicated in their character to remain very long in the\r\nStatute Books. There has already arisen a cry for simpler regulations\r\nwhich shall place the manufacture of de-natured alcohol on a plane with\r\nthe practice in Germany, France and other countries which have carried\r\nthe manufacture and use of alcohol, for industrial purposes to a very\r\nhigh plane. Both in England and America the Excise and Internal Revenue\r\nregulations have been of very troublesome character, and the production\r\nof spirits has been so carefully guarded, watched and checked that the\r\ndistiller aside from the high tax he has had to pay has been greatly\r\nhampered. In Germany and France, however, things are different. There the\r\nmanufacture of Industrial Alcohol from farm products has been encouraged\r\nand as a consequence the regulations are of very much simpler character.\r\nIn Germany the number of agricultural or co-operative stills is very\r\nlarge and these stills are practically free from the constant\r\nsupervision of internal revenue officials.\r\n\r\nUntil the wash passes into the still there is practically no Governmental\r\nsupervision except as to the proper gauging of the vats and to the proper\r\nsealing of all joints or pipes leading from the vats to the still. From\r\nthat point onward, however, to the final receiver every vessel is locked\r\nand sealed and no access to the spirit can be obtained by the distiller.\r\nThe quantity of spirit distilled and its quality is ascertained by the\r\nRevenue Officer from this final receiver and on this spirit so found is\r\ncomputed the vat tax and the distillery tax which have to be paid by the\r\ndistiller. There are none of the cumbersome regulations regarding the\r\nwarehouses, storehouses, storekeepers, etc., which are found in our own\r\nrevenue laws. To provide security against abstraction of wash in the\r\nfermenting tanks, reliance is placed upon frequent but uncertain\r\nvisitations.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that in the fulness of time our own laws and\r\nregulations will be very much simplified for all industrial plants. An\r\nattempt has been made to so simplify the laws by Act of Congress No. 230,\r\napproved March 2, 1907 and taking effect on September 1, 1907, the text\r\nof which is appended, and undoubtedly other acts will follow as the\r\ncountry becomes more and more sensible of the benefits to be derived from\r\nfree industrial alcohol. The text of the act is as follows:\r\n\r\n                           [PUBLIC--NO. 230.]\r\n\r\n     An Act to amend an Act entitled \"An Act for the withdrawal from\r\n     bond tax free of domestic alcohol when rendered unfit for beverage\r\n     or liquid medicinal uses by mixture with suitable denaturing\r\n     materials,\" approved June seventh, nineteen hundred and six.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress Assembled_, That notwithstanding anything\r\ncontained in the Act entitled \"An Act for the withdrawal from bond tax\r\nfree of domestic alcohol when rendered unfit for beverage or liquid\r\nmedicinal uses by mixture with suitable de-naturing materials,\" approved\r\nJune seventh, nineteen hundred and six, domestic alcohol when suitably\r\ndenatured may be withdrawn from bond without the payment of\r\ninternal-revenue tax and used in the manufacture of ether and chloroform\r\nand other definite chemical substances where said alcohol is changed into\r\nsome other chemical substance and does not appear in the finished product\r\nas alcohol: _Provided_, That rum of not less than one hundred and fifty\r\ndegrees proof, may be withdrawn, for de-naturation only, in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of said Act of June seventh, nineteen hundred and\r\nsix, and in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, may authorize the establishment of central\r\nde-naturing bonded warehouses, other than those at distilleries, to\r\nwhich alcohol of the required proof may be transferred from distilleries\r\nor distillery bonded warehouses without the payment of internal-revenue\r\ntax, and in which such alcohol may be stored and de-natured. The\r\nestablishment, operation, and custody of such warehouses shall be under\r\nsuch regulations and upon the execution of such bonds as the Commissioner\r\nof Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nmay prescribe.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. That alcohol of the required proof may be drawn off, for\r\nde-naturation only, from receiving cisterns in the cistern room of any\r\ndistillery for transfer by pipes direct to any de-naturing bonded\r\nwarehouse on the distillery premises or to closed metal storage tanks\r\nsituated in the distillery bonded warehouse, or from such storage tanks\r\nto any denaturing bonded warehouse on the distillery premises, and\r\nde-natured alcohol may also be transported from the de-naturing bonded\r\nwarehouse, in such manner and by means of such packages, tanks or tank\r\ncars, and on the execution of such bonds, and under such regulations as\r\nthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, may prescribe. And further, alcohol to be de-natured may\r\nbe withdrawn without the payment of internal-revenue tax from the\r\ndistillery bonded warehouse for shipment to central de-naturing plants in\r\nsuch packages, tanks and tank cars, under such regulations, and on the\r\nexecution of such bonds as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of\r\nInternal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. That at distilleries producing alcohol from any substance what\r\never, for de-naturation only, and having a daily spirit-producing\r\ncapacity of not exceeding one hundred proof gallons, the use of cisterns\r\nor tanks of such size and construction as may be deemed expedient may be\r\npermitted in lieu of distillery bonded warehouses, and the production,\r\nstorage, the manner and process of de-naturing on the distillery premises\r\nthe alcohol produced, and transportation of such alcohol, and the\r\noperation of such distilleries shall be upon the execution of such bonds\r\nand under such regulations as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with\r\nthe approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may prescribe, and such\r\ndistilleries may by such regulations be exempted from such provisions of\r\nthe existing laws relating to distilleries as may be deemed expedient by\r\nsaid officials.\r\n\r\nSEC. 5. That the provisions of this Act shall take effect on September\r\nfirst, nineteen hundred and seven.\r\n\r\n  Approved, March 2, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adam's Still, 38\r\n    faults of, 39\r\n    operation of, 38\r\n\r\n  Air necessary to fermentation, 18\r\n    cooling for mashes, 15\r\n\r\n  Alcohol, absolute, 2\r\n    as fuel, 221\r\n    boiling point of, 2\r\n      points of mixture, 2\r\n    composition of, 1, 6\r\n    contraction in mixtures of, 4\r\n    de-natured, 143\r\n    determination of purity, 186, 188\r\n    estimation of, 179\r\n    estimating by Geisler's method, 183\r\n      Brand's method, 184\r\n      sugar in \"Beer\", 185\r\n    ethyl, 7\r\n    methyl, 7\r\n    measuring in mixtures, 174, 179\r\n      by hydrometers, 176, 178\r\n    proof, 175\r\n    rectification of, 82, 92\r\n    relative amounts in different grains, 126\r\n    specific gravity of, 2, 174\r\n    strengthening, 31\r\n    under proof, 176\r\n    wood, 7\r\n\r\n  Alcoholometer, Cartier's, 178\r\n    Field's, 182\r\n    Tralle's, 179\r\n\r\n  Alcoholometry, 174\r\n\r\n  Alcohols, principal, 6\r\n    boiling points of principal, 6\r\n    composition of principal, 6\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barbet's still, 93\r\n    traps, 68\r\n    test for alcoholic purity, 187\r\n\r\n  Barley best for malting, 103\r\n    cleaning, 104\r\n    draining after steeping, 105\r\n    drying malt from, 108\r\n    effect of germination on, 107\r\n    germination of, 106\r\n    steeping, 105\r\n    test of sufficient steeping, 105\r\n    washing, 104\r\n\r\n  Beet-cleaners, 151\r\n    -juice, extraction of by maceration and diffusion, 157, 158\r\n    pulp, addition of sulphuric acid to, 153, 156, 160\r\n    presses, 154, 156\r\n    rasp, 152\r\n\r\n  Beets, alcohol from, 150\r\n    cellars for storing, 149\r\n    cultivation of, 140\r\n    characteristics of good, 140\r\n    cleaning, 151\r\n    composition of, 141\r\n    conditions for cultivating, 142, 144, 145\r\n    diffusion battery for, 158\r\n    direct distillation of, 161\r\n    distilling apparatus for, 162, 200, 201\r\n    distilling plant for, 199, 201\r\n\r\n  Beets, fermenting juice of, 160\r\n    harvesting, 146\r\n    how to tell when ripe, 147\r\n    hydraulic presses for, 153\r\n    macerating, 156, 159\r\n    manures for, 143\r\n    roll press for, 154\r\n    soil for growing, 142\r\n    sowing, 144, 146\r\n    stack for storing, 148\r\n    storing in winter, 149\r\n    scum forming during fermentation of, 160\r\n    transportation of, 203\r\n\r\n  Boiling over, to prevent in still, 58\r\n    points of alcoholic liquors, 2\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carbonic anhydride, to get rid of, 25\r\n\r\n  Cellar for beets, 149\r\n\r\n  Cellier-Blumenthal still, 48\r\n\r\n  Cleaning barley, 103\r\n    beets, 150\r\n    grain, 104\r\n    potatoes, 110, 204\r\n      apparatus for, 151\r\n\r\n  Coal consumption, 208\r\n\r\n  Coffey's still, 54\r\n\r\n  Column distillery, 64, 66\r\n    rectifying, 51, 87, 94\r\n\r\n  Condenser, Cellier-Blumenthal's, 48\r\n    Coffey's still, 54\r\n    and mash heater, 41, 43, 46, 52, 64, 74\r\n\r\n  Concentration of alcohol by distillation, 31\r\n\r\n  Continuous distillation, 50\r\n\r\n  Cooling mashes by air, 15\r\n    by water, 17, 133, 196\r\n\r\n  Corn, mashing, (see Grain).\r\n\r\n  Couch, wet, 106\r\n\r\n  Covered fermentation, 27\r\n\r\n  Current still, 59\r\n\r\n\r\n  De-Naturants, formulas for, 211, 214, 216, 219, 254\r\n    prescribed in U.

The favorable attention which they attracted lead\r\nthe author to believe that there was a real demand for a book treating in\r\na theoretical as well as a practical way on centrifugal fans. The\r\narticles have been thoroughly revised, added to, and made as complete as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n                         Contents of Chapters.\r\n\r\n     1.

Knowing the value of them in saving time, simplifying work and\r\nensuring correct calculations he feels confident that they will be\r\nappreciated by engineers, architects and contractors, for whose benefit\r\nthey have been compiled. Care has been taken to make the charts as clear\r\nand as easily understood and, above all, as accurate as possible. They\r\nhave been based upon theoretical considerations, modified by what is\r\nconsidered to be good practice in this country.\r\n\r\nCHART 1.--This chart is for determining the number of square feet of\r\nheating surface of a low pressure steam heating system, pressure not to\r\nexceed 5 lbs. per square inch by the gauge, necessary to supply the heat\r\nlost through the various kinds of wall surfaces of rooms.

W.\r\nHartley's \"Gas Analyst's Manual\" and \"Gas Measurement\" form the\r\njustification of the present work, which embodies practically the entire\r\ncontents of those two volumes. It has been found, however, that their\r\nscope was too narrow to comply with modern requirements in various\r\ndirections, although ample at the time they were written, and so I have\r\nventured to add such extensions as appeared to be necessary in order to\r\nmeet the demand which exists for a comprehensive work on Gas Apparatus\r\nand its use.\r\n\r\nThis large work has been in course of preparation for the past three\r\nyears by Mr. Jaques Abady, and has been very carefully revised by other\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\nMany valuable tables of data have been included, a number of which come\r\nfrom the private note books of the Author, being practically results\r\nobtained by him during many years of work as Expert, Gas Engineer and\r\nGas-Works Materials Manufacturer.\r\n\r\n                         CONTENTS OF CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n   1.--Photometry (58 pages.)\r\n   2.--The table photometer and Photometer Room (38 pages.)\r\n   3.--Standard of Light (32 pages.)\r\n   4.--Calorimetry and Specific Gravity, with a note on Mond Gas\r\n       (48 pages.)\r\n   5.--The Referees' Test for Sulphur and Ammonia in Gas (28 pages.)\r\n   6.--Coal Testing (22 pages.)\r\n   7.--Testing Enrichment and Purification Materials (33 pages.)\r\n   8.--Purity Tests for Gas in the Various Stages of its Manufacture\r\n       (43 pages.)\r\n   9.--Testing Bye-products (35 pages.)\r\n  10.--Technical Gas Analysis (63 pages.)\r\n  11.--Meter-Testing Apparatus (48 pages.)\r\n  12.--Meter and Governor Testing (34 pages.)\r\n  Appendix.
