Of course,\r\nbeing a prince, people said this: but it was true besides. When he\r\nlooked at the candle, his eyes had an expression of earnest inquiry\r\nquite startling in a new-born baby. His nose--there was not much of it\r\ncertainly, but what there was seemed an aquiline shape; his complexion\r\nwas a charming, healthy purple; he was round and fat, straight-limbed\r\nand long--in fact, a splendid baby, and everybody was exceedingly\r\nproud of him. Especially his father and mother, the King and Queen of\r\nNomansland, who had waited for him during their happy reign of ten\r\nyears--now made happier than ever, to themselves and their subjects, by\r\nthe appearance of a son and heir.\r\n\r\nThe only person who was not quite happy was the king's brother, the\r\nheir-presumptive, who would have been king one day, had the baby not\r\nbeen born. But as his Majesty was very kind to him, and even rather\r\nsorry for him--insomuch that at the Queen's request he gave him a\r\ndukedom almost as big as a county,--the Crown Prince, as he was called,\r\ntried to seem pleased also; and let us hope he succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's christening was to be a grand affair. According to the\r\ncustom of the country, there were chosen for him four-and-twenty\r\ngodfathers and godmothers, who each had to give him a name, and promise\r\nto do their utmost for him. When he came of age, he himself had to\r\nchoose the name--and the god-father or godmother--that he liked best,\r\nfor the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nMeantime, all was rejoicing. Subscriptions were made among the rich to\r\ngive pleasure to the poor: dinners in town-halls for the working men;\r\ntea-parties in the streets for their wives; and milk and bun feasts for\r\nthe children in the schoolrooms. For Nomansland, though I cannot point\r\nit out in any map, or read of it in any history, was, I believe, much\r\nlike our own or many another country.\r\n\r\nAs for the Palace--which was no different from other palaces--it was\r\nclean \"turned out of the windows,\" as people say, with the preparations\r\ngoing on. The only quiet place in it was the room which, though the\r\nPrince was six weeks old, his mother the Queen had never quitted.\r\nNobody said she was ill, however; it would have been so inconvenient;\r\nand as she said nothing about it herself, but lay pale and placid,\r\ngiving no trouble to anybody, nobody thought much about her. All the\r\nworld was absorbed in admiring the baby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_All the people in the palace were lovely too--or\r\nthought themselves so, ...from the ladies-in-waiting down ..._\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_The poor little kitchenmaid ... in her pink cotton\r\ngown ... thought doubtless, there never was such a pretty girl._\"]\r\n\r\nThe christening-day came at last, and it was as lovely as the Prince\r\nhimself. All the people in the palace were lovely too--or thought\r\nthemselves so, in the elegant new clothes which the queen, who thought\r\nof everybody, had taken care to give them, from the ladies-in-waiting\r\ndown to the poor little kitchenmaid, who looked at herself in her pink\r\ncotton gown, and thought, doubtless, that there never was such a pretty\r\ngirl as she.\r\n\r\nBy six in the morning all the royal household had dressed itself in\r\nits very best; and then the little Prince was dressed in his best--his\r\nmagnificent christening-robe; which proceeding his Royal Highness did\r\nnot like at all, but kicked and screamed like any common baby. When he\r\nhad a little calmed down, they carried him to be looked at by the Queen\r\nhis mother, who, though her royal robes had been brought and laid upon\r\nthe bed, was, as everybody well knew, quite unable to rise and put them\r\non.\r\n\r\nShe admired her baby very much; kissed and blessed him, and lay looking\r\nat him, as she did for hours sometimes, when he was placed beside her\r\nfast asleep; then she gave him up with a gentle smile, and saying \"she\r\nhoped he would be very good, that it would be a very nice christening,\r\nand all the guests would enjoy themselves,\" turned peacefully over on\r\nher bed, saying nothing more to anybody. She was a very uncomplaining\r\nperson--the Queen, and her name was Dolorez.\r\n\r\nEverything went on exactly as if she had been present. All, even the\r\nKing himself, had grown used to her absence, for she was not strong,\r\nand for years had not joined in any gaieties. She always did her royal\r\nduties, but as to pleasures, they could go on quite well without her,\r\nor it seemed so. The company arrived: great and notable persons in this\r\nand neighboring countries; also the four-and-twenty godfathers and\r\ngodmothers, who had been chosen with care, as the people who would be\r\nmost useful to his Royal Highness, should he ever want friends, which\r\ndid not seem likely. What such want could possibly happen to the heir\r\nof the powerful monarch of Nomansland?\r\n\r\nThey came, walking two and two, with their coronets on their\r\nheads--being dukes and duchesses, prince and princesses, or the like;\r\nthey all kissed the child, and pronounced the name which each had given\r\nhim. Then the four-and-twenty names were shouted out with great energy\r\nby six heralds, one after the other, and afterwards written down, to\r\nbe preserved in the state records, in readiness for the next time they\r\nwere wanted which would be either on his Royal Highness's coronation\r\nor his funeral. Soon the ceremony was over, and everybody satisfied;\r\nexcept, perhaps, the little Prince himself, who moaned faintly under\r\nhis christening robes, which nearly smothered him.\r\n\r\nIn truth, though very few knew, the Prince in coming to the chapel had\r\nmet with a slight disaster. His nurse--not his ordinary one, but the\r\nstate nursemaid, an elegant and fashionable young lady of rank, whose\r\nduty it was to carry him to and from the chapel, had been so occupied\r\nin arranging her train with one hand, while she held the baby with the\r\nother, that she stumbled and let him fall, just at the foot of the\r\nmarble staircase. To be sure, she contrived to pick him up again the\r\nnext minute, and the accident was so slight it seemed hardly worth\r\nspeaking of. Consequently, nobody did speak of it. The baby had turned\r\ndeadly pale but did not cry, so no person a step or two behind could\r\ndiscover anything wrong; afterwards, even if he had moaned, the silver\r\ntrumpets were loud enough to drown his voice.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a pity to let anything trouble such a day of\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\nSo, after a minute's pause, the procession had moved on. Such a\r\nprocession! Heralds in blue and silver; pages in crimson and gold; and\r\na troop of little girls in dazzling white, carrying baskets of flowers,\r\nwhich they strewed all the way before the nurse and child,--finally the\r\nfour-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, as proud as possible, and so\r\nsplendid to look at that they would have quite extinguished their small\r\ngodson--merely a heap of lace and muslin with a baby-face inside--had\r\nit not been for a canopy of white satin and ostrich feathers, which was\r\nheld over him wherever he was carried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_The procession had moved on. Such a procession!\r\nHeralds in blue and silver; pages in crimson and gold._\"]\r\n\r\nThus, with the sun shining on them through the painted windows,\r\nthey stood; the King and his train on one side, the Prince and his\r\nattendants on the other, as pretty a sight as ever was seen out of\r\nfairyland.\r\n\r\n\"It's just like fairyland,\" whispered the eldest little girl to the\r\nnext eldest, as she shook the last rose out of her basket; \"and I think\r\nthe only thing the Prince wants now is a fairy godmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he?\" said a shrill but soft and not unpleasant voice behind; and\r\nthere was seen among the group of children somebody--not a child--yet\r\nno bigger than a child: somebody whom nobody had seen before, and who\r\ncertainly had not been invited, for she had no christening clothes on.\r\n\r\nShe was a little old woman dressed all in grey: grey gown, grey\r\nhooded cloak, of a material excessively fine, and a tint that seemed\r\nperpetually changing, like the grey of an evening sky. Her hair was\r\ngrey and her eyes also; even her complexion had a soft grey shadow over\r\nit. But there was nothing unpleasantly old about her, and her smile was\r\nas sweet and childlike as the Prince's own, which stole over his pale\r\nlittle face the instant she came near enough to touch him.\r\n\r\n\"Take care. Don't let the baby fall again.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand young lady nurse started, flushing angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Who spoke to me? How did anybody know?--I mean, what business has\r\nanybody--?\" Then, frightened, but still speaking in a much sharper tone\r\nthan I hope young ladies of rank are in the habit of speaking--\"Old\r\nwoman, you will be kind enough not to say 'the baby,' but 'the Prince.'\r\nKeep away; his Royal Highness is just going to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I must kiss him. I am his godmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" cried the elegant lady nurse.\r\n\r\n\"You!!\" repeated all the gentlemen and ladies in waiting.\r\n\r\n\"You!!!\" echoed the heralds and pages--and they began to blow the\r\nsilver trumpets, in order to stop all further conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's procession formed itself for returning--the King and his\r\ntrain having already moved off towards the palace--but, on the topmost\r\nstep of the marble stairs, stood, right in front of all, the little old\r\nwoman clothed in grey.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself on tiptoe by the help of her stick, and gave the\r\nlittle Prince three kisses.\r\n\r\n\"This is intolerable,\" cried the young lady nurse, wiping the kisses\r\noff rapidly with her lace handkerchief. \"Such an insult to his Royal\r\nHighness. Take yourself out of the way, old woman, or the King shall be\r\ninformed immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"The King knows nothing of me, more's the pity,\" replied the old woman\r\nwith an indifferent air, as if she thought the loss was more on his\r\nMajesty's side than hers. \"My friend in the palace is the King's wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kings' wives are called queens,\" said the lady nurse, with a\r\ncontemptuous air.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" replied the old woman. \"Nevertheless, I know her\r\nMajesty well, and I love her and her child. And--since you dropped him\r\non the marble stairs (this she said in a mysterious whisper, which made\r\nthe young lady tremble in spite of her anger)--I choose to take him for\r\nmy own. I am his godmother, ready to help him whenever he wants me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You help him!\" cried all the group, breaking into shouts of laughter,\r\nto which the little old woman paid not the slightest attention. Her\r\nsoft grey eyes were fixed on the Prince, who seemed to answer to the\r\nlook, smiling again and again in causeless, aimless fashion, as babies\r\ndo smile.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty must hear of this,\" said a gentleman-in-waiting.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty will hear quite enough news in a minute or two,\" said the\r\nold woman sadly. And again stretching up to the little Prince, she\r\nkissed him on the forehead solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Be called by a new name which nobody has ever thought of. Be Prince\r\nDolor, in memory of your mother Dolorez.\"\r\n\r\n\"In memory of!\" Everybody started at the ominous phrase, and also at a\r\nmost terrible breach of etiquette which the old woman had committed. In\r\nNomansland, neither the king nor the queen were supposed to have any\r\nChristian name at all. They dropped it on their coronation-day, and it\r\nwas never mentioned again till it was engraved on their coffins when\r\nthey died.\r\n\r\n\"Old woman, you are exceedingly ill-bred,\" cried the eldest\r\nlady-in-waiting, much horrified. \"How you could know the fact passes my\r\ncomprehension. But even if you did not know it, how dared you presume\r\nto hint that her most gracious Majesty is called Dolorez?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Was_ called Dolorez,\" said the old woman with a tender solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe first gentleman, called the Gold-stick-in-waiting, raised it to\r\nstrike her, and all the rest stretched out their hands to seize her;\r\nbut the grey mantle melted from between their fingers like air; and,\r\nbefore anybody had time to do anything more, there came a heavy,\r\nmuffled, startling sound.\r\n\r\nThe great bell of the palace--the bell which was only heard on the\r\ndeath of some of the Royal family, and for as many times as he or she\r\nwas years old--began to toll. They listened, mute and horror-stricken.\r\nSome one counted: One--two--three--four--up to nine and twenty--just\r\nthe queen's age.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, the Queen. Her Majesty was dead! In the midst of the\r\nfestivities she had slipped away, out of her new happiness and her\r\nold sufferings, neither few nor small. Sending away her women to see\r\nthe sight--at least, they said afterwards, in excuse, that she had\r\ndone so, and it was very like her to do it--she had turned with her\r\nface to the window, whence one could just see the tops of the distant\r\nmountains--the Beautiful Mountains, as they were called--where she was\r\nborn. So gazing, she had quietly died.\r\n\r\nWhen the little Prince was carried back to his mother's room, there was\r\nno mother to kiss him. And, though he did not know it, there would be\r\nfor him no mother's kiss any more.\r\n\r\nAs for his Godmother--the little old woman in grey who called herself\r\nso--whether she melted into air, like her gown when they touched it,\r\nor whether she flew out of the chapel window, or slipped through the\r\ndoorway among the bewildered crowd, nobody knew--nobody ever thought\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\nOnly the nurse, the ordinary homely one, coming out of the Prince's\r\nnursery in the middle of the night in search of a cordial to quiet\r\nhis continual moans, saw, sitting in the doorway, something which she\r\nwould have thought a mere shadow, had she not seen shining out of it\r\ntwo eyes, grey and soft and sweet. She put her hand before her own,\r\nscreaming loudly. When she took them away, the old woman was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody was very kind to the poor little Prince. I think people\r\ngenerally are kind to motherless children, whether princes or peasants.\r\nHe had a magnificent nursery, and a regular suite of attendants, and\r\nwas treated with the greatest respect and state. Nobody was allowed to\r\ntalk to him in silly baby language, or dandle him, or above all to kiss\r\nhim, though, perhaps, some people did it surreptitiously, for he was\r\nsuch a sweet baby that it was difficult to help it.\r\n\r\nIt could not be said that the Prince missed his mother; children of\r\nhis age cannot do that; but somehow after she died everything seemed\r\nto go wrong with him. From a beautiful baby he became sickly and pale,\r\nseeming to have almost ceased growing, especially in his legs, which\r\nhad been so fat and strong. But after the day of his christening they\r\nwithered and shrank; he no longer kicked them out either in passion or\r\nplay, and when, as he got to be nearly a year old, his nurse tried to\r\nmake him stand upon them, he only tumbled down.\r\n\r\nThis happened so many times that at last people began to talk about it.\r\nA prince, and not able to stand on his own legs! What a dreadful thing!\r\nwhat a misfortune for the country!\r\n\r\nRather a misfortune to him also, poor little boy! but nobody seemed to\r\nthink of that. And when, after a while, his health revived, and the\r\nold bright look came back to his sweet little face, and his body grew\r\nlarger and stronger, though still his legs remained the same, people\r\ncontinued to speak of him in whispers, and with grave shakes of the\r\nhead. Everybody knew, though nobody said it, that something, impossible\r\nto guess what, was not quite right with the poor little Prince.\r\n\r\nOf course, nobody hinted this to the King his father: it does not do to\r\ntell great people anything unpleasant. And besides, his Majesty took\r\nvery little notice of his son, or of his other affairs, beyond the\r\nnecessary duties of his kingdom. People had said he would not miss the\r\nQueen at all, she having been so long an invalid: but he did. After\r\nher death he never was quite the same. He established himself in her\r\nempty rooms, the only rooms in the palace whence one could see the\r\nBeautiful Mountains, and was often observed looking at them as if he\r\nthought she had flown away thither, and that his longing could bring\r\nher back again. And by a curious coincidence, which nobody dared to\r\ninquire into, he desired that the Prince might be called, not by any\r\nof the four-and-twenty grand names given him by his godfathers and\r\ngodmothers, but by the identical name mentioned by the little old woman\r\nin grey,--Dolor, after his mother Dolorez.\r\n\r\nOnce a week, according to established state custom, the Prince, dressed\r\nin his very best, was brought to the King his father for half-an-hour,\r\nbut his Majesty was generally too ill and too melancholy to pay much\r\nheed to the child.\r\n\r\nOnly once, when he and the Crown Prince, who was exceedingly attentive\r\nto his royal brother, were sitting together, with Prince Dolor playing\r\nin a corner of the room, dragging himself about with his arms rather\r\nthan his legs, and sometimes trying feebly to crawl from one chair to\r\nanother, it seemed to strike the father that all was not right with his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n\"How old is his Royal Highness?\" said he suddenly to the nurse.\r\n\r\n\"Two years, three months, and five days, please your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"How old is his Royal Highness?\" said he suddenly to\r\nthe nurse._]\r\n\r\n\"It does not please me,\" said the King with a sigh. \"He ought to be far\r\nmore forward than he is now, ought he not, brother? You, who have so\r\nmany children, must know. Is there not something wrong about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said the Crown Prince, exchanging meaning looks with the\r\nnurse, who did not understand at all, but stood frightened and\r\ntrembling with the tears in her eyes. \"Nothing to make your Majesty at\r\nall uneasy. No doubt his Royal Highness will outgrow it in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Outgrow--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A slight delicacy--ahem!--in the spine; something inherited, perhaps,\r\nfrom his dear mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, she was always delicate; but she was the sweetest woman that ever\r\nlived. Come here, my little son.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the Prince turned round upon his father a small, sweet, grave\r\nface--so like his mother's--his Majesty the King smiled and held out\r\nhis arms. But when the boy came to him, not running like a boy, but\r\nwriggling awkwardly along the floor, the royal countenance clouded\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have been told of this. It is terrible--terrible! And for a\r\nprince, too! Send for all the doctors in my kingdom immediately.\"\r\n\r\nThey came, and each gave a different opinion, and ordered a different\r\nmode of treatment. The only thing they agreed in was what had been\r\npretty well known before: that the prince must have been hurt when he\r\nwas an infant--let fall, perhaps, so as to injure his spine and lower\r\nlimbs. Did nobody remember?\r\n\r\nNo, nobody. Indignantly, all the nurses denied that any such accident\r\nhad happened, was possible to have happened, until the faithful country\r\nnurse recollected that it really had happened, on the day of the\r\nchristening. For which unluckily good memory all the others scolded her\r\nso severely that she had no peace of her life, and soon after, by the\r\ninfluence of the young lady nurse who had carried the baby that fatal\r\nday, and who was a sort of connection of the Crown Prince, being his\r\nwife's second cousin once removed, the poor woman was pensioned off,\r\nand sent to the Beautiful Mountains, from whence she came, with orders\r\nto remain there for the rest of her days.\r\n\r\nBut of all this the King knew nothing, for, indeed, after the first\r\nshock of finding out that his son could not walk, and seemed never\r\nlikely to walk, he interfered very little concerning him. The whole\r\nthing was too painful, and his Majesty had never liked painful things.\r\nSometimes he inquired after Prince Dolor, and they told him his Royal\r\nHighness was going on as well as could be expected, which really was\r\nthe case. For after worrying the poor child and perplexing themselves\r\nwith one remedy after another, the Crown Prince, not wishing to offend\r\nany of the differing doctors, had proposed leaving him to nature; and\r\nnature, the safest doctor of all, had come to his help, and done her\r\nbest. He could not walk, it is true; his limbs were mere useless\r\nadditions to his body; but the body itself was strong and sound. And\r\nhis face was the same as ever--just his mother's face, one of the\r\nsweetest in the world!\r\n\r\nEven the King, indifferent as he was, sometimes looked at the little\r\nfellow with sad tenderness, noticing how cleverly he learned to crawl,\r\nand swing himself about by his arms, so that in his own awkward way he\r\nwas as active in motion as most children of his age.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little man! he does his best, and he is not unhappy; not half\r\nso unhappy as I, brother,\" addressing the Crown Prince, who was more\r\nconstant than ever in his attendance upon the sick monarch. \"If\r\nanything should befall me, I have appointed you as Regent. In case of\r\nmy death, you will take care of my poor little boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly; but do not let us imagine any such misfortune. I\r\nassure your Majesty--everybody will assure you--that it is not in the\r\nleast likely.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew, however, and everybody knew, that it was likely, and soon\r\nafter it actually did happen. The King died, as suddenly and quietly\r\nas the Queen had done--indeed, in her very room and bed; and Prince\r\nDolor was left without either father or mother--as sad a thing as could\r\nhappen, even to a Prince.\r\n\r\nHe was more than that now, though. He was a king. In Nomansland, as in\r\nother countries, the people were struck with grief one day and revived\r\nthe next. \"The king is dead--long live the king!\" was the cry that rang\r\nthrough the nation, and almost before his late Majesty had been laid\r\nbeside the queen in their splendid mausoleum, crowds came thronging\r\nfrom all parts of the royal palace, eager to see the new monarch.\r\n\r\nThey did see him--the Prince Regent took care they should--sitting\r\non the floor of the council-chamber, sucking his thumb! And when\r\none of the gentlemen-in-waiting lifted him up and carried him--fancy,\r\ncarrying a king!--to the chair of state, and put the crown on his head,\r\nhe shook it off again, it was so heavy and uncomfortable. Sliding down\r\nto the foot of the throne, he began playing with the golden lions that\r\nsupported it, stroking their paws and putting his tiny fingers into\r\ntheir eyes, and laughing--laughing as if he had at last found something\r\nto amuse him.\r\n\r\n\"There's a fine king for you!\" said the first lord-in-waiting, a friend\r\nof the Prince Regent's (the Crown Prince that used to be, who, in the\r\ndeepest mourning, stood silently beside the throne of his young nephew.\r\nHe was a handsome man, very grand and clever looking). \"What a king!\r\nwho can never stand to receive his subjects, never walk in processions,\r\nwho, to the last day of his life, will have to be carried about like a\r\nbaby. Very unfortunate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exceedingly unfortunate,\" repeated the second lord. \"It is always bad\r\nfor a nation when its king is a child; but such a child--a permanent\r\ncripple, if not worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope not worse,\" said the first lord in a very hopeless tone,\r\nand looking towards the Regent, who stood erect and pretended to\r\nhear nothing. \"I have heard that these sort of children with very\r\nlarge heads and great broad foreheads and staring eyes, are----well,\r\nwell, let us hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. In the\r\nmeantime----\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" said the Crown Prince, coming forward and kissing the hilt\r\nof his sword--\"I swear to perform my duties as regent, to take all\r\ncare of his Royal Highness--his Majesty, I mean,\" with a grand bow to\r\nthe little child, who laughed innocently back again. \"And I will do\r\nmy humble best to govern the country. Still, if the country has the\r\nslightest objection----\" But the Crown Prince being generalissimo, and\r\nhaving the whole army at his beck and call, so that he could have begun\r\na civil war in no time; the country had, of course, not the slightest\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nSo the king and queen slept together in peace, and Prince Dolor reigned\r\nover the land--that is, his uncle did; and everybody said what a\r\nfortunate thing it was for the poor little Prince to have such a clever\r\nuncle to take care of him. All things went on as usual; indeed, after\r\nthe Regent had brought his wife and her seven sons, and established\r\nthem in the palace, rather better than usual. For they gave such\r\nsplendid entertainments and made the capital so lively, that trade\r\nrevived, and the country was said to be more flourishing than it had\r\nbeen for a century.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Regent and his sons appeared, they were received with\r\nshouts--\"Long live the Crown Prince!\" \"Long live the Royal family!\"\r\nAnd, in truth, they were very fine children, the whole seven of them,\r\nand made a great show when they rode out together on seven beautiful\r\nhorses, one height above another, down to the youngest, on his tiny\r\nblack pony, no bigger than a large dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_And, in truth, they were very fine children, the whole\r\nseven of them._\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_They made a great show when they rode out together on\r\nseven beautiful horses._\"]\r\n\r\nAs for the other child, his Royal Highness Prince Dolor--for somehow\r\npeople soon ceased to call him his Majesty, which seemed such a\r\nridiculous title for a poor little fellow, a helpless cripple, with\r\nonly head and trunk, and no legs to speak of--he was seen very seldom\r\nby anybody.\r\n\r\nSometimes, people daring enough to peer over the high wall of the\r\npalace garden, noticed there, carried in a footman's arms, or drawn in\r\na chair, or left to play on the grass, often with nobody to mind him, a\r\npretty little boy, with a bright intelligent face, and large melancholy\r\neyes--no, not exactly melancholy, for they were his mother's, and she\r\nwas by no means sad-minded, but thoughtful and dreamy. They rather\r\nperplexed people, those childish eyes; they were so exceedingly\r\ninnocent and yet so penetrating. If anybody did a wrong thing, told\r\na lie for instance, they would turn round with such a grave silent\r\nsurprise--the child never talked much--that every naughty person in the\r\npalace was rather afraid of Prince Dolor.\r\n\r\nHe could not help it, and perhaps he did not even know it, being no\r\nbetter a child than many other children, but there was something about\r\nhim which made bad people sorry, and grumbling people ashamed of\r\nthemselves, and ill-natured people gentle and kind. I suppose, because\r\nthey were touched to see a poor little fellow who did not in the least\r\nknow what had befallen him, or what lay before him, living his baby\r\nlife as happy as the day was long. Thus, whether or not he was good\r\nhimself, the sight of him and his affliction made other people good,\r\nand, above all, made everybody love him. So much so, that his uncle the\r\nRegent began to feel a little uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nNow, I have nothing to say against uncles in general. They are usually\r\nvery excellent people, and very convenient to little boys and girls.\r\n\r\nEven the \"cruel uncle\" of \"The Babes in the Wood\" I believe to be quite\r\nan exceptional character. And this \"cruel uncle\" of whom I am telling\r\nwas, I hope, an exception too.\r\n\r\nHe did not mean to be cruel. If anybody had called him so, he would\r\nhave resented it extremely: he would have said that what he did was\r\ndone entirely for the good of the country. But he was a man who\r\nhad been always accustomed to consider himself first and foremost,\r\nbelieving that whatever he wanted was sure to be right, and, therefore,\r\nhe ought to have it. So he tried to get it, and got it too, as people\r\nlike him very often do. Whether they enjoy it when they have it, is\r\nanother question.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he went one day to the council-chamber, determined on making\r\na speech and informing the ministers and the country at large that\r\nthe young King was in failing health, and that it would be advisable\r\nto send him for a time to the Beautiful Mountains. Whether he really\r\nmeant to do this; or whether it occurred to him afterwards that there\r\nwould be an easier way of attaining his great desire, the crown of\r\nNomansland, is a point which I cannot decide.\r\n\r\nBut soon after, when he had obtained an order in council to send the\r\nKing away--which was done in great state, with a guard of honour\r\ncomposed of two whole regiments of soldiers--the nation learnt, without\r\nmuch surprise, that the poor little Prince--nobody ever called him king\r\nnow--had gone on a much longer journey than to the Beautiful Mountains.\r\n\r\nHe had fallen ill on the road and died within a few hours; at least, so\r\ndeclared the physician in attendance, and the nurse who had been sent\r\nto take care of him. They brought his coffin back in great state, and\r\nburied it in the mausoleum with his parents.\r\n\r\nSo Prince Dolor was seen no more. The country went into deep mourning\r\nfor him, and then forgot him, and his uncle reigned in his stead. That\r\nillustrious personage accepted his crown with great decorum, and wore\r\nit with great dignity, to the last. But whether he enjoyed it or not,\r\nthere is no evidence to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what of the little lame prince, whom everybody seemed so easily to\r\nhave forgotten?\r\n\r\nNot everybody. There were a few kind souls, mothers of families, who\r\nhad heard his sad story, and some servants about the palace, who had\r\nbeen familiar with his sweet ways--these many a time sighed and said,\r\n\"Poor Prince Dolor!\" Or, looking at the Beautiful Mountains, which\r\nwere visible all over Nomansland, though few people ever visited them,\r\n\"Well, perhaps his Royal Highness is better where he is than even\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not know--indeed, hardly anybody did know--that beyond the\r\nmountains, between them and the sea, lay a tract of country, barren,\r\nlevel, bare, except for short stunted grass, and here and there a\r\npatch of tiny flowers. Not a bush--not a tree--not a resting-place for\r\nbird or beast was in that dreary plain. In summer, the sunshine fell\r\nupon it hour after hour with a blinding glare; in winter, the winds\r\nand rains swept over it unhindered, and the snow came down, steadily,\r\nnoiselessly, covering it from end to end in one great white sheet,\r\nwhich lay for days and weeks unmarked by a single footprint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_One large round tower which rose up in the center of\r\nthe plain._\"]\r\n\r\nNot a pleasant place to live in--and nobody did live there, apparently.\r\nThe only sign that human creatures had ever been near the spot, was\r\none large round tower which rose up in the centre of the plain, and\r\nmight be seen all over it--if there had been anybody to see, which\r\nthere never was. Rose, right up out of the ground, as if it had grown\r\nof itself, like a mushroom. But it was not at all mushroom-like; on the\r\ncontrary, it was very solidly built. In form, it resembled the Irish\r\nround towers, which have puzzled people for so long, nobody being\r\nable to find out when, or by whom, or for what purpose they were made;\r\nseemingly for no use at all, like this tower. It was circular, of very\r\nfirm brickwork, with neither doors nor windows, until near the top,\r\nwhen you could perceive some slits in the wall, through which one might\r\npossibly creep in or look out. Its height was nearly a hundred feet\r\nhigh, and it had a battlemented parapet, showing sharp against the sky.\r\n\r\nAs the plain was quite desolate--almost like a desert, only\r\nwithout sand, and led to nowhere except the still more desolate\r\nsea-coast--nobody ever crossed it. Whatever mystery there was about the\r\ntower, it and the sky and the plain kept their secret to themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a very great secret indeed--a state secret--which none but so\r\nclever a man as the present king of Nomansland would ever have thought\r\nof. How he carried it out, undiscovered, I cannot tell. People said,\r\nlong afterwards, that it was by means of a gang of condemned criminals,\r\nwho were set to work, and executed immediately after they had done, so\r\nthat nobody knew anything, or in the least suspected the real fact.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the fact? Why, that this tower, which seemed a mere mass\r\nof masonry, utterly forsaken and uninhabited, was not so at all. Within\r\ntwenty feet of the top, some ingenious architect had planned a perfect\r\nlittle house, divided into four rooms--as by drawing a cross within a\r\ncircle you will see might easily be done. By making skylights, and a\r\nfew slits in the walls for windows, and raising a peaked roof which was\r\nhidden by the parapet, here was a dwelling complete; eighty feet from\r\nthe ground, and as inaccessible as a rook's nest on the top of a tree.\r\n\r\nA charming place to live in! if you once got up there, and never wanted\r\nto come down again.\r\n\r\nInside--though nobody could have looked inside except a bird, and\r\nhardly even a bird flew past that lonely tower--inside it was furnished\r\nwith all the comfort and elegance imaginable; with lots of books and\r\ntoys, and everything that the heart of a child could desire. For its\r\nonly inhabitant, except a nurse of course, was a poor little solitary\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nOne winter night, when all the plain was white with moonlight, there\r\nwas seen crossing it a great tall black horse, ridden by a man also\r\nbig and equally black, carrying before him on the saddle a woman and\r\na child. The woman--she had a sad, fierce look, and no wonder, for\r\nshe was a criminal under sentence of death, but her sentence had been\r\nchanged to almost as severe a punishment. She was to inhabit the lonely\r\ntower with the child, and was allowed to live as long as the child\r\nlived--no longer. This, in order that she might take the utmost care\r\nof him; for those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying\r\nand of his living. And yet he was only a little gentle boy, with a\r\nsweet sleepy smile--he had been very tired with his long journey--and\r\nclinging arms, which held tight to the man's neck, for he was rather\r\nfrightened, and the face, black as it was, looked kindly at him. And\r\nhe was very helpless, with his poor small shrivelled legs, which could\r\nneither stand nor run away--for the little forlorn boy was Prince Dolor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_He was rather frightened, and the face, black as it\r\nwas, looked kindly at him._\"]\r\n\r\nHe had not been dead at all--or buried either. His grand funeral had\r\nbeen a mere pretence: a wax figure having been put in his place, while\r\nhe himself was spirited away under charge of these two, the condemned\r\nwoman and the black man. The latter was deaf and dumb, so could neither\r\ntell nor repeat anything.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the foot of the tower, there was light enough to see\r\na huge chain dangling from the parapet, but dangling only half way.\r\nThe deaf-mute took from his saddle-wallet a sort of ladder, arranged\r\nin pieces like a puzzle, fitted it together and lifted it up to meet\r\nthe chain. Then he mounted to the top of the tower, and slung from it a\r\nsort of chair, in which the woman and the child placed themselves and\r\nwere drawn up, never to come down again as long as they lived. Leaving\r\nthem there, the man descended the ladder, took it to pieces again and\r\npacked it in his pack, mounted the horse, and disappeared across the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nEvery month they used to watch for him, appearing like a speck in the\r\ndistance. He fastened his horse to the foot of the tower and climbed\r\nit, as before, laden with provisions and many other things. He always\r\nsaw the Prince, so as to make sure that the child was alive and well,\r\nand then went away until the following month.\r\n\r\nWhile his first childhood lasted, Prince Dolor was happy enough. He\r\nhad every luxury that even a prince could need, and the one thing\r\nwanting--love, never having known, he did not miss. His nurse was very\r\nkind to him, though she was a wicked woman. But either she had not been\r\nquite so wicked as people said, or she grew better through being shut\r\nup continually with a little innocent child, who was dependent upon her\r\nfor every comfort and pleasure of his life.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unhappy life. There was nobody to tease or ill-use him,\r\nand he was never ill. He played about from room to room--there were\r\nfour rooms--parlour, kitchen, his nurse's bed-room, and his own; learnt\r\nto crawl like a fly, and to jump like a frog, and to run about on\r\nall-fours almost as fast as a puppy. In fact, he was very much like a\r\npuppy or a kitten, as thoughtless and as merry--scarcely ever cross,\r\nthough sometimes a little weary. As he grew older, he occasionally\r\nliked to be quiet for awhile, and then he would sit at the slits of\r\nwindows, which were, however, much bigger than they looked from the\r\nbottom of the tower,--and watch the sky above and the ground below,\r\nwith the storms sweeping over and the sunshine coming and going, and\r\nthe shadows of the clouds running races across the blank plain.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by he began to learn lessons--not that his nurse had been\r\nordered to teach him, but she did it partly to amuse herself. She was\r\nnot a stupid woman, and Prince Dolor was by no means a stupid boy; so\r\nthey got on very well, and his continual entreaty \"What can I do? what\r\ncan you find me to do?\" was stopped; at least for an hour or two in the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull life, but he had never known any other; anyhow, he\r\nremembered no other; and he did not pity himself at all. Not for a long\r\ntime, till he grew to be quite a big little boy, and could read easily.\r\nThen he suddenly took to books, which the deaf-mute brought him from\r\ntime to time--books which, not being acquainted with the literature of\r\nNomansland, I cannot describe, but no doubt they were very interesting;\r\nand they informed him of everything in the outside world, and filled\r\nhim with an intense longing to see it.\r\n\r\nFrom this time a change came over the boy. He began to look sad and\r\nthin, and to shut himself up for hours without speaking. For his nurse\r\nhardly spoke, and whatever questions he asked beyond their ordinary\r\ndaily life she never answered. She had, indeed, been forbidden, on\r\npain of death, to tell him anything about himself, who he was, or what\r\nhe might have been. He knew he was Prince Dolor, because she always\r\naddressed him as \"my prince,\" and \"your royal highness,\" but what a\r\nprince was he had not the least idea. He had no idea of any thing in\r\nthe world, except what he found in his books.\r\n\r\nHe sat one day surrounded by them, having built them up round him\r\nlike a little castle wall. He had been reading them half the day, but\r\nfeeling all the while that to read about things which you never can\r\nsee is like hearing about a beautiful dinner while you are starving.\r\nFor almost the first time in his life he grew melancholy: his hands\r\nfell on his lap; he sat gazing out of the window-slit upon the view\r\noutside--the view he had looked at every day of his life, and might\r\nlook at for endless days more.\r\n\r\nNot a very cheerful view--just the plain and the sky--but he liked\r\nit. He used to think, if he could only fly out of that window, up to\r\nthe sky or down to the plain, how nice it would be! Perhaps when he\r\ndied--his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave\r\nthe tower till he died--he might be able to do this. Not that he\r\nunderstood much what dying meant, but it must be a change, and any\r\nchange seemed to him a blessing.\r\n\r\n\"And I wish I had somebody to tell me all about it; about that and many\r\nother things; somebody that would be fond of me, like my poor white\r\nkitten.\"\r\n\r\nHere the tears came into his eyes, for the boy's one friend, the\r\none interest of his life, had been a little white kitten, which the\r\ndeaf-mute, kindly smiling, once took out of his pocket and gave\r\nhim--the only living creature Prince Dolor had ever seen. For four\r\nweeks it was his constant plaything and companion, till one moonlight\r\nnight it took a fancy for wandering, climbed on to the parapet of the\r\ntower, dropped over and disappeared. It was not killed, he hoped, for\r\ncats have nine lives; indeed, he almost fancied he saw it pick itself\r\nup and scamper away, but he never caught sight of it more.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I wish I had something better than a kitten--a person, a real\r\nlive person, who would be fond of me and kind to me. Oh, I want\r\nsomebody--dreadfully, dreadfully!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there sounded behind him a slight tap-tap-tap, as of a\r\nstick or a cane, and twisting himself round, he saw--what do you think\r\nhe saw?\r\n\r\nNothing either frightening or ugly, but still exceedingly curious. A\r\nlittle woman, no bigger than he might himself have been, had his legs\r\ngrown like those of other children, but she was not a child--she was\r\nan old woman. Her hair was grey, and her dress was grey, and there was\r\na grey shadow over her whereever she moved. But she had the sweetest\r\nsmile, the prettiest hands, and when she spoke it was in the softest\r\nvoice imaginable.\r\n\r\n\"My dear little boy,\"--and dropping her cane, the only bright and rich\r\nthing about her, she laid those two tiny hands on his shoulders--\"my\r\nown little boy, I could not come to you until you had said you wanted\r\nme, but now you do want me, here I am.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_She laid those two tiny hands on his shoulders--'My\r\nown little boy, I could not come to you until you had said you wanted\r\nme.'_\"]\r\n\r\n\"And you are very welcome, madam,\" replied the Prince, trying to speak\r\npolitely, as princes always did in books; \"and I am exceedingly obliged\r\nto you. May I ask who you are? Perhaps my mother?\" For he knew that\r\nlittle boys usually had a mother, and had occasionally wondered what\r\nhad become of his own.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the visitor, with a tender, half-sad smile, putting back the\r\nhair from his forehead, and looking right into his eyes--\"No, I am not\r\nyour mother, though she was a dear friend of mine; and you are as like\r\nher as ever you can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell her to come and see me then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She cannot; but I dare say she knows all about you. And she loves\r\nyou very much--and so do I; and I want to help you all I can, my poor\r\nlittle boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you call me poor?\" asked Prince Dolor in surprise.\r\n\r\nThe little old woman glanced down on his legs and feet, which he did\r\nnot know were different from those of other children, and then at\r\nhis sweet, bright face, which, though he knew not that either, was\r\nexceedingly different from many children's faces, which are often so\r\nfretful, cross, sullen. Looking at him, instead of sighing, she smiled.\r\n\"I beg your pardon, my prince,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am a prince, and my name is Dolor; will you tell me yours,\r\nmadam?\"\r\n\r\nThe little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells.\r\n\r\n\"I have not got a name--or rather, I have so many names that I don't\r\nknow which to choose. However, it was I who gave you yours, and you\r\nwill belong to me all your days. I am your godmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the little prince; \"I am glad I belong to you, for I\r\nlike you very much. Will you come and play with me?\"\r\n\r\nSo they sat down together, and played. By-and-by they began to talk.\r\n\r\n\"Are you very dull here?\" asked the little old woman.\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I have plenty to eat and\r\ndrink, and my lessons to do, and my books to read--lots of books.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you want nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Yes--perhaps--If you please, godmother, could you bring me\r\njust one more thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little boy to play with.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked very sad. \"Just the thing, alas, which I cannot\r\ngive you. My child, I cannot alter your lot in any way, but I can help\r\nyou to bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. But why do you talk of bearing it? I have nothing to bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor little man!\" said the old woman in the very tenderest tone of\r\nher tender voice. \"Kiss me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is kissing?\" asked the wondering child.\r\n\r\nHis godmother took him in her arms and embraced him many times.\r\nBy-and-by he kissed her back again--at first awkwardly and shyly, then\r\nwith all the strength of his warm little heart.\r\n\r\n\"You are better to cuddle than even my white kitten, I think. Promise\r\nme that you will never go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must; but I will leave a present behind me--something as good as\r\nmyself to amuse you--something that will take you wherever you want to\r\ngo, and show you all that you wish to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A travelling-cloak.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince's countenance fell. \"I don't want a cloak, for I never go\r\nout. Sometimes nurse hoists me on to the roof, and carries me round by\r\nthe parapet; but that is all. I can't walk, you know, as she does.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more reason why you should ride; and besides, this\r\ntravelling-cloak----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!--she's coming.\"\r\n\r\nThere sounded outside the room door a heavy step and a grumpy voice,\r\nand a rattle of plates and dishes.\r\n\r\n\"It's my nurse, and she is bringing my dinner; but I don't want dinner\r\nat all--I only want you. Will her coming drive you away, godmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; but only for a little. Never mind; all the bolts and bars\r\nin the world couldn't keep me out. I'd fly in at the window, or down\r\nthrough the chimney. Only wish for me, and I come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Prince Dolor, but almost in a whisper, for he\r\nwas very uneasy at what might happen next. His nurse and his\r\ngodmother--what would they say to one another? how would they look\r\nat one another?--two such different faces: one, harsh-lined, sullen,\r\ncross, and sad; the other, sweet and bright and calm as a summer\r\nevening before the dark begins.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was flung open, Prince Dolor shut his eyes, trembling all\r\nover: opening them again, he saw he need fear nothing; his lovely old\r\ngodmother had melted away just like the rainbow out of the sky, as he\r\nhad watched it many a time. Nobody but his nurse was in the room.\r\n\r\n\"What a muddle your Royal Highness is sitting in,\" said she sharply.\r\n\"Such a heap of untidy books; and what's this rubbish?\" kicking a\r\nlittle bundle that lay beside them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing--give it me!\" cried the prince, and darting after\r\nit, he hid it under his pinafore, and then pushed it quickly into his\r\npocket. Rubbish as it was, it was left in the place where she had sat,\r\nand might be something belonging to her--his dear, kind godmother, whom\r\nalready he loved with all his lonely, tender, passionate heart.\r\n\r\nIt was, though he did not know this, his wonderful travelling-cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what of the travelling-cloak? What sort of cloak was it, and what\r\ngood did it do the Prince?\r\n\r\nStay, and I'll tell you all about it.\r\n\r\nOutside it was the commonest-looking bundle imaginable--shabby and\r\nsmall; and the instant Prince Dolor touched it, it grew smaller still,\r\ndwindling down till he could put it in his trousers pocket, like a\r\nhandkerchief rolled up into a ball. He did this at once, for fear his\r\nnurse should see it, and kept it there all day--all night, too. Till\r\nafter his next morning's lessons he had no opportunity of examining his\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nWhen he did, it seemed no treasure at all; but a mere piece of\r\ncloth--circular in form, dark green in colour, that is, if it had any\r\ncolour at all, being so worn and shabby, though not dirty. It had a\r\nsplit cut to the centre, forming a round hole for the neck--and that\r\nwas all its shape; the shape, in fact, of those cloaks which in South\r\nAmerica are called _ponchos_--very simple, but most graceful and\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor had never seen anything like it. In spite of his\r\ndisappointment he examined it curiously; spread it out on the floor,\r\nthen arranged it on his shoulders. It felt very warm and comfortable;\r\nbut it was so exceedingly shabby--the only shabby thing that the Prince\r\nhad ever seen in his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Prince Dolor had never seen anything like it. In spite\r\nof his disappointment he examined it curiously._\"]\r\n\r\n\"And what use will it be to me?\" said he sadly. \"I have no need of\r\noutdoor clothes, as I never go out. Why was this given me, I wonder?\r\nand what in the world am I to do with it? She must be a rather funny\r\nperson, this dear godmother of mine.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, because she was his godmother, and had given him the\r\ncloak, he folded it carefully and put it away, poor and shabby as it\r\nwas, hiding it in a safe corner of his toy-cupboard, which his nurse\r\nnever meddled with. He did not want her to find it, or to laugh at it,\r\nor at his godmother--as he felt sure she would, if she knew all.\r\n\r\nThere it lay, and by-and-by he forgot all about it; nay, I am sorry\r\nto say, that, being but a child, and not seeing her again, he almost\r\nforgot his sweet old godmother, or thought of her only as he did of the\r\nangels or fairies that he read of in his books, and of her visit as if\r\nit had been a mere dream of the night.\r\n\r\nThere were times, certainly, when he recalled her; of early mornings\r\nlike that morning when she appeared beside him, and late evenings, when\r\nthe grey twilight reminded him of the colour of her hair and her pretty\r\nsoft garments; above all, when, waking in the middle of the night,\r\nwith the stars peering in at his window, or the moonlight shining\r\nacross his little bed, he would not have been surprised to see her\r\nstanding beside it, looking at him with those beautiful tender eyes,\r\nwhich seemed to have a pleasantness and comfort in them different from\r\nanything he had ever known.\r\n\r\nBut she never came, and gradually she slipped out of his memory--only\r\na boy's memory, after all; until something happened which made him\r\nremember her, and want her as he had never wanted anything before.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor fell ill. He caught--his nurse could not tell how--a\r\ncomplaint common to the people of Nomansland, called the doldrums,\r\nas unpleasant as measles or any other of our complaints; and it made\r\nhim restless, cross, and disagreeable. Even when a little better, he\r\nwas too weak to enjoy anything, but lay all day long on his sofa,\r\nfidgetting his nurse extremely--while, in her intense terror lest he\r\nmight die, she fidgetted him still more. At last, seeing he really was\r\ngetting well, she left him to himself--which he was most glad of, in\r\nspite of his dulness and dreariness. There he lay, alone, quite alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Even when a little better, he was too weak to enjoy\r\nanything, but lay all day long on his sofa, fidgetting his nurse\r\nextremely._\"]\r\n\r\nNow and then an irritable fit came over him, in which he longed to get\r\nup and do something, or go somewhere--would have liked to imitate his\r\nwhite kitten--jump down from the tower and run away, taking the chance\r\nof whatever might happen.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing, alas! was likely to happen; for the kitten, he\r\nremembered, had four active legs, while he----\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed\r\nso bitterly? I wonder why I can't walk straight and steady like my\r\nnurse--only I wouldn't like to have her great noisy, clumping shoes.\r\nStill, it would be very nice to move about quickly--perhaps to fly,\r\nlike a bird, like that string of birds I saw the other day skimming\r\nacross the sky--one after the other.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the passage-birds--the only living creatures that ever\r\ncrossed the lonely plain; and he had been much interested in them,\r\nwondering whence they came and whither they were going.\r\n\r\n\"How nice it must be to be a bird. If legs are no good, why cannot one\r\nhave wings? People have wings when they die--perhaps: I wish I was\r\ndead, that I do. I am so tired, so tired; and nobody cares for me.\r\nNobody ever did care for me, except perhaps my godmother. Godmother,\r\ndear, have you quite forsaken me?\"\r\n\r\nHe stretched himself wearily, gathered himself up, and dropped his\r\nhead upon his hands; as he did so, he felt somebody kiss him at the\r\nback of his neck, and turning, found that he was resting, not on the\r\nsofa-pillows, but on a warm shoulder--that of the little old woman\r\nclothed in grey.\r\n\r\nHow glad he was to see her! How he looked into her kind eyes, and felt\r\nher hands, to see if she were all real and alive! then put both his\r\narms round her neck, and kissed her as if he would never have done\r\nkissing!\r\n\r\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried she, pretending to be smothered, \"I see you have\r\nnot forgotten my teachings. Kissing is a good thing--in moderation.\r\nOnly, just let me have breath to speak one word.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dozen!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tell me all that has happened to you since I saw you--or\r\nrather, since you saw me, which is a quite different thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has happened--nothing ever does happen to me,\" answered the\r\nPrince dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"And are you very dull, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"So dull, that I was just thinking whether I could not jump down to the\r\nbottom of the tower like my white kitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that, being not a white kitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were!--I wish I were anything but what I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can't make yourself any different, nor can I do it either. You\r\nmust be content to stay just what you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe little old woman said this--very firmly, but gently, too--with her\r\narms round his neck, and her lips on his forehead. It was the first\r\ntime the boy had ever heard any one talk like this, and he looked up in\r\nsurprise--but not in pain, for her sweet manner softened the hardness\r\nof her words.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my prince--for you are a prince, and must behave as such--let us\r\nsee what we can do; how much I can do for you, or show you how to do\r\nfor yourself. Where is your travelling-cloak?\"\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor blushed extremely. \"I--I put it away in the cupboard; I\r\nsuppose it is there still.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never used it; you dislike it?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, not wishing to be impolite. \"Don't you think it's--just a\r\nlittle old and shabby, for a prince?\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman laughed--long and loud, though very sweetly.\r\n\r\n\"Prince, indeed! Why, if all the princes in the world craved for it,\r\nthey couldn't get it, unless I gave it them. Old and shabby! It's the\r\nmost valuable thing imaginable! Very few ever have it; but I thought I\r\nwould give it to you, because--because you are different from other\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" said the Prince, and looked first with curiosity, then with a\r\nsort of anxiety, into his godmother's face, which was sad and grave,\r\nwith slow tears beginning to steal down.\r\n\r\nShe touched his poor little legs. \"These are not like those of other\r\nlittle boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!--my nurse never told me that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely not. But it is time you were told; and I tell you, because\r\nI love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what, dear godmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you will never be able to walk, or run, or jump, or play--that\r\nyour life will be quite different to most people's lives: but it may be\r\na very happy life for all that. Do not be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid,\" said the boy; but he turned very pale, and his lips\r\nbegan to quiver, though he did not actually cry--he was too old for\r\nthat, and, perhaps, too proud.\r\n\r\nThough not wholly comprehending, he began dimly to guess what his\r\ngodmother meant. He had never seen any real live boys, but he had seen\r\npictures of them; running and jumping; which he had admired and tried\r\nhard to imitate, but always failed. Now he began to understand why he\r\nfailed, and that he always should fail--that, in fact, he was not like\r\nother little boys; and it was of no use his wishing to do as they did,\r\nand play as they played, even if he had had them to play with. His was\r\na separate life, in which he must find out new work and new pleasures\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nThe sense of _the inevitable_, as grown-up people call it--that we\r\ncannot have things as we want them to be, but as they are, and that we\r\nmust learn to bear them and make the best of them--this lesson, which\r\neverybody has to learn soon or late--came, alas! sadly soon, to the\r\npoor boy. He fought against it for a while, and then, quite overcome,\r\nturned and sobbed bitterly in his godmother's arms.\r\n\r\nShe comforted him--I do not know how, except that love always comforts;\r\nand then she whispered to him, in her sweet, strong, cheerful\r\nvoice--\"Never mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think I do mind--that is, I _won't_ mind,\" replied he,\r\ncatching the courage of her tone and speaking like a man, though he was\r\nstill such a mere boy.\r\n\r\n\"That is right, my prince!--that is being like a prince. Now we know\r\nexactly where we are; let us put our shoulders to the wheel and----\"\r\n\r\n\"We are in Hopeless Tower\" (this was its name, if it had a name), \"and\r\nthere is no wheel to put our shoulders to,\" said the child sadly.\r\n\r\n\"You little matter-of-fact goose! Well for you that you have a\r\ngodmother called----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n\"Stuff-and-nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff-and-nonsense! What a funny name!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some people give it me, but they are not my most intimate friends.\r\nThese call me--never mind what,\" added the old woman, with a soft\r\ntwinkle in her eyes. \"So as you know me, and know me well, you may give\r\nme any name you please; it doesn't matter. But I am your godmother,\r\nchild. I have few godchildren; those I have love me dearly, and find me\r\nthe greatest blessing in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe it,\" cried the little lame Prince, and forgot\r\nhis troubles in looking at her--as her figure dilated, her eyes grew\r\nlustrous as stars, her very raiment brightened, and the whole room\r\nseemed filled with her beautiful and beneficent presence like light.\r\n\r\nHe could have looked at her for ever--half in love, half in awe; but\r\nshe suddenly dwindled down into the little old woman all in grey, and\r\nwith a malicious twinkle in her eyes, asked for the travelling-cloak.\r\n\r\n\"Bring it out of the rubbish cupboard, and shake the dust off\r\nit, quick!\" said she to Prince Dolor, who hung his head, rather\r\nashamed. \"Spread it out on the floor, and wait till the split closes\r\nand the edges turn up like a rim all round. Then go and open the\r\nsky-light--mind, I say _open the skylight_--set yourself down in the\r\nmiddle of it, like a frog on a water-lily leaf; say 'Abracadabra, dum\r\ndum dum,' and--see what will happen!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince burst into a fit of laughing. It all seemed so exceedingly\r\nsilly; he wondered that a wise old woman like his godmother should talk\r\nsuch nonsense.\r\n\r\n\"Stuff-and-nonsense, you mean,\" said she, answering, to his great\r\nalarm, his unspoken thoughts. \"Did I not tell you some people called me\r\nby that name? Never mind; it doesn't harm me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she laughed--her merry laugh--as child-like as if she were the\r\nprince's age instead of her own, whatever that might be. She certainly\r\nwas a most extraordinary old woman.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me or not, it doesn't matter,\" said she. \"Here is the cloak:\r\nwhen you want to go travelling on it, say _Abracadabra, dum dum dum_;\r\nwhen you want to come back again, say _Abracadabra, tum tum ti_. That's\r\nall; good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nA puff of pleasant air passing by him, and making him feel for the\r\nmoment quite strong and well, was all the Prince was conscious of. His\r\nmost extraordinary godmother was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Really now, how rosy your Royal Highness's cheeks have grown! You seem\r\nto have got well already,\" said the nurse, entering the room.\r\n\r\n\"I think I have,\" replied the Prince very gently--he felt kindly and\r\ngently even to his grim nurse. \"And now let me have my dinner, and go\r\nyou to your sewing as usual.\"\r\n\r\nThe instant she was gone, however, taking with her the plates\r\nand dishes, which for the first time since his illness he had\r\nsatisfactorily cleared, Prince Dolor sprang down from his sofa, and\r\nwith one or two of his frog-like jumps, not graceful but convenient, he\r\nreached the cupboard where he kept his toys, and looked everywhere for\r\nhis travelling-cloak.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was not there.\r\n\r\nWhile he was ill of the doldrums, his nurse, thinking it a good\r\nopportunity for putting things to rights, had made a grand clearance\r\nof all his \"rubbish,\" as she considered it: his beloved headless\r\nhorses, broken carts, sheep without feet, and birds without wings--all\r\nthe treasures of his baby days, which he could not bear to part with.\r\nThough he seldom played with them now, he liked just to feel they were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThey were all gone! and with them the travelling-cloak. He sat down on\r\nthe floor, looking at the empty shelves, so beautifully clean and tidy,\r\nthen burst out sobbing as if his heart would break.\r\n\r\nBut quietly--always quietly. He never let his nurse hear him cry. She\r\nonly laughed at him, as he felt she would laugh now.\r\n\r\n\"And it is all my own fault,\" he cried. \"I ought to have taken better\r\ncare of my godmother's gift. O, godmother, forgive me! I'll never be so\r\ncareless again. I don't know what the cloak is exactly, but I am sure\r\nit is something precious. Help me to find it again. Oh, don't let it be\r\nstolen from me--don't, please!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed a silvery voice. \"Why, that travelling-cloak is\r\nthe one thing in the world which nobody can steal. It is of no use to\r\nanybody except the owner. Open your eyes, my prince, and see what you\r\nshall see.\"\r\n\r\nHis dear old godmother, he thought, had turned eagerly round. But no;\r\nhe only beheld, lying in a corner of the room, all dust and cobwebs,\r\nhis precious travelling-cloak.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor darted towards it, tumbling several times on the way,--as\r\nhe often did tumble, poor boy! and pick himself up again, never\r\ncomplaining. Snatching it to his breast, he hugged and kissed it,\r\ncobwebs and all, as if it had been something alive. Then he began\r\nunrolling it, wondering each minute what would happen. But what did\r\nhappen was so curious that I must leave it for another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any reader, big or little, should wonder whether there is a meaning\r\nin this story, deeper than that of an ordinary fairy tale, I will own\r\nthat there is. But I have hidden it so carefully that the smaller\r\npeople, and many larger folk, will never find it out, and meantime the\r\nbook may be read straight on, like \"Cinderella,\" or \"Blue-Beard,\" or\r\n\"Hop-o'-my Thumb,\" for what interest it has, or what amusement it may\r\nbring.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I return to Prince Dolor, that little lame boy whom\r\nmany may think so exceedingly to be pitied. But if you had seen him\r\nas he sat patiently untying his wonderful cloak, which was done up in\r\na very tight and perplexing parcel, using skilfully his deft little\r\nhands, and knitting his brows with firm determination, while his eyes\r\nglistened with pleasure, and energy, and eager anticipation--if you had\r\nbeheld him thus, you might have changed your opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen we see people suffering or unfortunate, we feel very sorry for\r\nthem; but when we see them bravely bearing their sufferings, and making\r\nthe best of their misfortunes, it is quite a different feeling. We\r\nrespect, we admire them. One can respect and admire even a little child.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Dolor had patiently untied all the knots, a remarkable\r\nthing happened. The cloak began to undo itself. Slowly unfolding, it\r\nlaid itself down on the carpet, as flat as if it had been ironed; the\r\nsplit joined with a little sharp crick-crack, and the rim turned up all\r\nround till it was breast-high; for meantime the cloak had grown and\r\ngrown, and become quite large enough for one person to sit in it, as\r\ncomfortable as if in a boat.\r\n\r\nThe Prince watched it rather anxiously; it was such an extraordinary,\r\nnot to say a frightening thing. However, he was no coward, but a\r\nthorough boy, who, if he had been like other boys, would doubtless have\r\ngrown up daring and adventurous--a soldier, a sailor, or the like. As\r\nit was, he could only show his courage morally, not physically, by\r\nbeing afraid of nothing, and by doing boldly all that it was in his\r\nnarrow powers to do. And I am not sure but that in this way he showed\r\nmore real valour than if he had had six pairs of proper legs.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself, \"What a goose I am! As if my dear godmother would\r\never have given me anything to hurt me. Here goes!\"\r\n\r\nSo, with one of his active leaps, he sprang right into the middle of\r\nthe cloak, where he squatted down, wrapping his arms tight round his\r\nknees, for they shook a little and his heart beat fast. But there he\r\nsat, steady and silent, waiting for what might happen next.\r\n\r\nNothing did happen, and he began to think nothing would, and to feel\r\nrather disappointed, when he recollected the words he had been told to\r\nrepeat--\"Abracadabra, dum, dum, dum!\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated them, laughing all the while, they seemed such nonsense.\r\nAnd then--and then----\r\n\r\nNow, I don't expect anybody to believe what I am going to relate,\r\nthough a good many wise people have believed a good many sillier\r\nthings. And as seeing's believing, and I never saw it, I cannot be\r\nexpected implicitly to believe it myself, except in a sort of a way;\r\nand yet there is truth in it--for some people.\r\n\r\nThe cloak rose, slowly and steadily, at first only a few inches, then\r\ngradually higher and higher, till it nearly touched the skylight.\r\nPrince Dolor's head actually bumped against the glass, or would have\r\ndone so, had he not crouched down, crying, \"Oh, please don't hurt me!\"\r\nin a most melancholy voice.\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly remembered his godmother's express command--\"Open the\r\nskylight!\"\r\n\r\nRegaining his courage at once, without a moment's delay, he lifted\r\nup his head and began searching for the bolt, the cloak meanwhile\r\nremaining perfectly still, balanced in air. But the minute the window\r\nwas opened, out it sailed--right out into the clear fresh air, with\r\nnothing between it and the cloudless blue.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor had never felt any such delicious sensation before! I\r\ncan understand it. Cannot you? Did you never think, in watching the\r\nrooks going home singly or in pairs, oaring their way across the calm\r\nevening sky, till they vanish like black dots in the misty grey, how\r\npleasant it must feel to be up there, quite out of the noise and din of\r\nthe world, able to hear and see everything down below, yet troubled by\r\nnothing and teased by no one--all alone, but perfectly content.\r\n\r\nSomething like this was the happiness of the little lame Prince when he\r\ngot out of Hopeless Tower, and found himself for the first time in the\r\npure open air, with the sky above him and the earth below.\r\n\r\nTrue, there was nothing but earth and sky; no houses, no trees, no\r\nrivers, mountains, seas--not a beast on the ground, or a bird in the\r\nair. But to him even the level plain looked beautiful; and then there\r\nwas the glorious arch of the sky, with a little young moon sitting in\r\nthe west like a baby queen. And the evening breeze was so sweet and\r\nfresh, it kissed him like his godmother's kisses; and by-and-by a few\r\nstars came out, first two or three, and then quantities--quantities! so\r\nthat, when he began to count them, he was utterly bewildered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_By-and-by a few stars came out, first two or three,\r\nand then quantities!_\"]\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the cool breeze had become cold, the mist\r\ngathered, and as he had, as he said, no outdoor clothes, poor Prince\r\nDolor was not very comfortable. The dews fell damp on his curls--he\r\nbegan to shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I had better go home,\" thought he.\r\n\r\nBut how?--For in his excitement the other words which his godmother\r\nhad told him to use had slipped his memory. They were only a little\r\ndifferent from the first, but in that slight difference all the\r\nimportance lay. As he repeated his \"Abracadabra,\" trying ever so many\r\nother syllables after it, the cloak only went faster and faster,\r\nskimming on through the dusky empty air.\r\n\r\nThe poor little Prince began to feel frightened. What if his wonderful\r\ntravelling-cloak should keep on thus travelling, perhaps to the world's\r\nend, carrying with it a poor, tired, hungry boy, who, after all, was\r\nbeginning to think there was something very pleasant in supper and bed?\r\n\r\n\"Dear godmother,\" he cried pitifully, \"do help me! Tell me just this\r\nonce and I'll never forget again.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the words came rushing into his head--\"Abracadabra, tum, tum,\r\nti!\" Was that it? Ah, yes!--for the cloak began to turn slowly. He\r\nrepeated the charm again, more distinctly and firmly, when it gave a\r\ngentle dip, like a nod of satisfaction, and immediately started back,\r\nas fast as ever, in the direction of the tower.\r\n\r\nHe reached the skylight, which he found exactly as he had left it,\r\nand slipped in, cloak and all, as easily as he had got out. He had\r\nscarcely reached the floor, and was still sitting in the middle of his\r\ntravelling-cloak--like a frog on a water-lily leaf, as his godmother\r\nhad expressed it--when he heard his nurse's voice outside.\r\n\r\n\"Bless us! what has become of your Royal Highness all this time? To\r\nsit stupidly here at the window till it is quite dark, and leave the\r\nskylight open too. Prince! what can you be thinking of? You are the\r\nsilliest boy I ever knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" said he absently, and never heeding her crossness; or his only\r\nanxiety was lest she might find out anything.\r\n\r\nShe would have been a very clever person to have done so. The instant\r\nPrince Dolor got off it, the cloak folded itself up into the tiniest\r\npossible parcel, tied all its own knots, and rolled itself of its own\r\naccord into the farthest and darkest corner of the room. If the nurse\r\nhad seen it, which she didn't, she would have taken it for a mere\r\nbundle of rubbish not worth noticing.\r\n\r\nShutting the skylight with an angry bang, she brought in the supper and\r\nlit the candles, with her usual unhappy expression of countenance. But\r\nPrince Dolor hardly saw it; he only saw, hid in the corner where nobody\r\nelse would see it, his wonderful travelling-cloak. And though his\r\nsupper was not particularly nice, he ate it heartily, scarcely hearing\r\na word of his nurse's grumbling, which to-night seemed to have taken\r\nthe place of her sullen silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_She brought in the supper and lit the candles,\r\nwith her usual unhappy expression ... he only saw his wonderful\r\ntravelling-cloak._\" _Page 58._]\r\n\r\n\"Poor woman!\" he thought, when he paused a minute to listen and look at\r\nher, with those quiet, happy eyes, so like his mother's. \"Poor woman!\r\n_she_ hasn't got a travelling-cloak!\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he was left alone at last, and crept into his little\r\nbed, where he lay awake a good while, watching what he called his\r\n\"sky-garden,\" all planted with stars, like flowers, his chief thought\r\nwas, \"I must be up very early to-morrow morning and get my lessons\r\ndone, and then I'll go travelling all over the world on my beautiful\r\ncloak.\"\r\n\r\nSo, next day, he opened his eyes with the sun, and went with a good\r\nheart to his lessons. They had hitherto been the chief amusement of\r\nhis dull life; now, I am afraid, he found them also a little dull. But\r\nhe tried to be good--I don't say Prince Dolor always was good, but he\r\ngenerally tried to be--and when his mind went wandering after the dark\r\ndusty corner where lay his precious treasure, he resolutely called it\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n\"For,\" he said, \"how ashamed my godmother would be of me if I grew up a\r\nstupid boy.\"\r\n\r\nBut the instant lessons were done, and he was alone in the empty room,\r\nhe crept across the floor, undid the shabby little bundle, his fingers\r\ntrembling with eagerness, climbed on the chair, and thence to the\r\ntable, so as to unbar the skylight--he forgot nothing now--said his\r\nmagic charm, and was away out of the window, as children say, \"in a few\r\nminutes less than no time!\"\r\n\r\nNobody missed him. He was accustomed to sit so quietly always, that\r\nhis nurse, though only in the next room, perceived no difference. And\r\nbesides, she might have gone in and out a dozen times, and it would\r\nhave been just the same; she never could have found out his absence.\r\n\r\nFor what do you think the clever godmother did? She took a quantity\r\nof moonshine, or some equally convenient material, and made an image,\r\nwhich she set on the window-sill reading, or by the table drawing,\r\nwhere it looked so like Prince Dolor, that any common observer would\r\nnever have guessed the deception; and even the boy would have been\r\npuzzled to know which was the image and which was himself.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while the happy little fellow was away, floating in the\r\nair on his magic cloak, and seeing all sorts of wonderful things--or\r\nthey seemed wonderful to him, who had hitherto seen nothing at all.\r\n\r\nFirst, there were the flowers that grew on the plain, which, whenever\r\nthe cloak came near enough, he strained his eyes to look at; they were\r\nvery tiny, but very beautiful--white saxifrage, and yellow lotus,\r\nand ground-thistles, purple and bright, with many others the names\r\nof which I do not know. No more did Prince Dolor, though he tried to\r\nfind them out by recalling any pictures he had seen of them. But he\r\nwas too far off; and though it was pleasant enough to admire them as\r\nbrilliant patches of colour, still he would have liked to examine them\r\nall. He was, as a little girl I know once said of a playfellow, \"a very\r\n_examining_ boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" he thought, \"whether I could see better through a pair of\r\nglasses like those my nurse reads with, and takes such care of. How I\r\nwould take care of them too! if only I had a pair!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately he felt something queer and hard fixing itself on to the\r\nbridge of his nose. It was a pair of the prettiest gold spectacles ever\r\nseen; and looking downwards, he found that, though ever so high above\r\nthe ground, he could see every minute blade of grass, every tiny bud\r\nand flower--nay, even the insects that walked over them.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" he cried in a gush of gratitude--to anybody or\r\neverybody, but especially to his dear godmother, whom he felt sure had\r\ngiven him this new present. He amused himself with it for ever so long,\r\nwith his chin pressed on the rim of the cloak, gazing down upon the\r\ngrass, every square foot of which was a mine of wonders.\r\n\r\nThen, just to rest his eyes, he turned them up to the sky--the blue,\r\nbright, empty sky, which he had looked at so often and seen nothing.\r\n\r\nNow, surely there was something. A long, black, wavy line, moving on\r\nin the distance, not by chance, as the clouds move apparently, but\r\ndeliberately, as if it were alive. He might have seen it before--he\r\nalmost thought he had; but then he could not tell what it was. Looking\r\nat it through his spectacles, he discovered that it really was alive;\r\nbeing a long string of birds, flying one after the other, their wings\r\nmoving steadily and their heads pointed in one direction, as steadily\r\nas if each were a little ship, guided invisibly by an unerring helm.\r\n\r\n\"They must be the passage-birds flying seawards!\" cried the boy, who\r\nhad read a little about them, and had a great talent for putting two\r\nand two together and finding out all he could. \"Oh, how I should like\r\nto see them quite close, and to know where they come from, and whither\r\nthey are going! How I wish I knew everything in all the world!\"\r\n\r\nA silly speech for even an \"examining\" little boy to make; because, as\r\nwe grow older, the more we know, the more we find out there is to know.\r\nAnd Prince Dolor blushed when he had said it, and hoped nobody had\r\nheard him.\r\n\r\nApparently somebody had, however; for the cloak gave a sudden bound\r\nforward, and presently he found himself high up in air, in the very\r\nmiddle of that band of ærial travellers, who had no magic cloak to\r\ntravel on--nothing except their wings. Yet there they were, making\r\ntheir fearless way through the sky.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor looked at them, as one after the other they glided past\r\nhim; and they looked at him--those pretty swallows, with their changing\r\nnecks and bright eyes--as if wondering to meet in mid-air such an\r\nextraordinary sort of a bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_They looked at him ... as if wondering to meet in\r\nmid-air such an extraordinary sort of bird._\" _Page 62._]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish I were going with you, you lovely creatures!\" cried the\r\nboy. \"I'm getting so tired of this dull plain, and the dreary and\r\nlonely tower. I do so want to see the world! Pretty swallows, dear\r\nswallows! tell me what it looks like--the beautiful, wonderful world!\"\r\n\r\nBut the swallows flew past him--steadily, slowly, pursuing their course\r\nas if inside each little head had been a mariner's compass, to guide\r\nthem safe over land and sea, direct to the place where they desired to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked after them with envy. For a long time he followed with\r\nhis eyes the faint wavy black line as it floated away, sometimes\r\nchanging its curves a little, but never deviating from its settled\r\ncourse, till it vanished entirely out of sight.\r\n\r\nThen he settled himself down in the centre of the cloak, feeling quite\r\nsad and lonely.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll go home,\" said he, and repeated his \"Abracadabra, tum,\r\ntum, ti!\" with a rather heavy heart. The more he had, the more he\r\nwanted; and it is not always one can have everything one wants--at\r\nleast, at the exact minute one craves for it; not even though one is a\r\nprince, and has a powerful and beneficent godmother.\r\n\r\nHe did not like to vex her by calling for her, and telling her how\r\nunhappy he was, in spite of all her goodness; so he just kept his\r\ntrouble to himself, went back to his lonely tower, and spent three days\r\nin silent melancholy without even attempting another journey on his\r\ntravelling-cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth day it happened that the deaf-mute paid his accustomed\r\nvisit, after which Prince Dolor's spirits rose. They always did, when\r\nhe got the new books, which, just to relieve his conscience, the King\r\nof Nomansland regularly sent to his nephew; with many new toys also,\r\nthough the latter were disregarded now.\r\n\r\n\"Toys indeed! when I'm a big boy,\" said the Prince with disdain,\r\nand would scarcely condescend to mount a rocking-horse, which had\r\ncome, somehow or other--I can't be expected to explain things very\r\nexactly--packed on the back of the other, the great black horse, which\r\nstood and fed contentedly at the bottom of the tower.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor leaned over and looked at it, and thought how grand it\r\nmust be to get upon its back--this grand live steed--and ride away,\r\nlike the pictures of knights.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I was a knight,\" he said to himself; \"then I should be obliged\r\nto ride out and see the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut he kept all these thoughts to himself, and just sat still,\r\ndevouring his new books till he had come to the end of them all. It\r\nwas a repast not unlike the Barmecide's feast which you read of in the\r\n\"Arabian Nights,\" which consisted of very elegant but empty dishes, or\r\nthat supper of Sancho Panza in \"Don Quixote,\" where, the minute the\r\nsmoking dishes came on the table, the physician waved his hand and they\r\nwere all taken away.\r\n\r\nThus, almost all the ordinary delights of boy-life had been taken away\r\nfrom, or rather never given to, this poor little Prince.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" he would sometimes think--\"I wonder what it feels like to\r\nbe on the back of a horse, galloping away, or holding the reins in\r\na carriage, and tearing across the country, or jumping a ditch, or\r\nrunning a race, such as I read of or see in pictures. What a lot of\r\nthings there are that I should like to do! But first, I should like to\r\ngo and see the world. I'll try.\"\r\n\r\nApparently it was his godmother's plan always to let him try, and try\r\nhard, before he gained anything. This day the knots that tied up his\r\ntravelling-cloak were more than usually troublesome, and he was a\r\nfull half hour before he got out into the open air, and found himself\r\nfloating merrily over the top of the tower.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in all his journeys he had never let himself go out of sight\r\nof home, for the dreary building, after all, was home--he remembered\r\nno other; but now he felt sick of the very look of his tower, with its\r\nround smooth walls and level battlements.\r\n\r\n\"Off we go!\" cried he, when the cloak stirred itself with a slight slow\r\nmotion, as if waiting his orders. \"Anywhere--anywhere, so that I am\r\naway from here, and out into the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the cloak, as if seized suddenly with a new idea, bounded\r\nforward and went skimming through the air, faster than the very fastest\r\nrailway train.\r\n\r\n\"Gee-up, gee-up!\" cried Prince Dolor in great excitement. \"This is as\r\ngood as riding a race.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he patted the cloak as if it had been a horse--that is, in the way\r\nhe supposed horses ought to be patted; and tossed his head back to meet\r\nthe fresh breeze, and pulled his coat-collar up and his hat down, as he\r\nfelt the wind grow keener and colder, colder than anything he had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter though?\" said he. \"I'm a boy, and boys ought not\r\nto mind anything.\"\r\n\r\nStill, for all his good-will, by-and-by he began to shiver exceedingly;\r\nalso, he had come away without his dinner, and he grew frightfully\r\nhungry. And to add to everything, the sunshiny day changed into rain,\r\nand being high up, in the very midst of the clouds, he got soaked\r\nthrough and through in a very few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I turn back?\" meditated he. \"Suppose I say 'Abracadabra?'\"\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, for already the cloak gave an obedient lurch, as if it\r\nwere expecting to be sent home immediately.\r\n\r\n\"No--I can't--I can't go back! I must go forward and see the world. But\r\noh! if I had but the shabbiest old rug to shelter me from the rain, or\r\nthe driest morsel of bread and cheese, just to keep me from starving!\r\nStill, I don't much mind; I'm a prince, and ought to be able to stand\r\nanything. Hold on, cloak, we'll make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a most curious circumstance, but no sooner had he said this than\r\nhe felt stealing over his knees something warm and soft; in fact, a\r\nmost beautiful bearskin, which folded itself round him quite naturally,\r\nand cuddled him up as closely as if he had been the cub of the kind\r\nold mother-bear that once owned it. Then feeling in his pocket, which\r\nsuddenly stuck out in a marvellous way, he found, not exactly bread and\r\ncheese, nor even sandwiches, but a packet of the most delicious food\r\nhe had ever tasted. It was not meat, nor pudding, but a combination of\r\nboth, and it served him excellently for both. He ate his dinner with\r\nthe greatest gusto imaginable, till he grew so thirsty he did not know\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I have just one drop of water, if it didn't trouble you too\r\nmuch, kindest of godmothers.\"\r\n\r\nFor he really thought this want was beyond her power to supply.\r\nAll the water which supplied Hopeless Tower was pumped up with\r\ndifficulty, from a deep artesian well--there were such things known\r\nin Nomansland--which had been made at the foot of it. But around, for\r\nmiles upon miles, the desolate plain was perfectly dry. And above it,\r\nhigh in air, how could he expect to find a well, or to get even a drop\r\nof water?\r\n\r\nHe forgot one thing--the rain. While he spoke, it came on in another\r\nwild burst, as if the clouds had poured themselves out in a passion of\r\ncrying, wetting him certainly, but leaving behind, in a large glass\r\nvessel which he had never noticed before, enough water to quench the\r\nthirst of two or three boys at least. And it was so fresh, so pure--as\r\nwater from the clouds always is, when it does not catch the soot from\r\ncity chimneys and other defilements--that he drank it, every drop, with\r\nthe greatest delight and content.\r\n\r\nAlso, as soon as it was empty, the rain filled it again, so that he\r\nwas able to wash his face and hands and refresh himself exceedingly.\r\nThen the sun came out and dried him in no time. After that he curled\r\nhimself up under the bearskin rug, and though he determined to be the\r\nmost wide-awake boy imaginable, being so exceedingly snug and warm and\r\ncomfortable, Prince Dolor condescended to shut his eyes, just for one\r\nminute. The next minute he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he found himself floating over a country quite unlike\r\nanything he had ever seen before.\r\n\r\nYet it was nothing but what most of you children see every day and\r\nnever notice it--a pretty country landscape, like England, Scotland,\r\nFrance, or any other land you choose to name. It had no particular\r\nfeatures--nothing in it grand or lovely--was simply pretty, nothing\r\nmore; yet to Prince Dolor, who had never gone beyond his lonely tower\r\nand level plain, it appeared the most charming sight imaginable.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a river. It came tumbling down the hillside, frothing\r\nand foaming, playing at hide-and-seek among rocks, then bursting out in\r\nnoisy fun like a child, to bury itself in deep still pools. Afterwards\r\nit went steadily on for a while, like a good grown-up person, till it\r\ncame to another big rock, where it misbehaved itself extremely. It\r\nturned into a cataract and went tumbling over and over, after a fashion\r\nthat made the Prince--who had never seen water before, except in his\r\nbath or his drinking-cup--clap his hands with delight.\r\n\r\n\"It is so active, so alive! I like things active and alive!\" cried he,\r\nand watched it shimmering and dancing, whirling and leaping, till,\r\nafter a few windings and vagaries, it settled into a respectable\r\nstream. After that it went along, deep and quiet, but flowing steadily\r\non, till it reached a large lake, into which it slipped, and so ended\r\nits course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_After a few windings and vagaries, it settled into a\r\nrespectable stream._\"]\r\n\r\nAll this the boy saw, either with his own naked eye, or through his\r\ngold spectacles. He saw also as in a picture, beautiful but silent,\r\nmany other things, which struck him with wonder, especially a grove of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nOnly think, to have lived to his age (which he himself did not know,\r\nas he did not know his own birthday) and never to have seen trees! As\r\nhe floated over these oaks, they seemed to him--trunk, branches, and\r\nleaves--the most curious sight imaginable.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only get nearer, so as to touch them,\" said he, and\r\nimmediately the obedient cloak ducked down; Prince Dolor made a snatch\r\nat the topmost twig of the tallest tree, and caught a bunch of leaves\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nJust a bunch of green leaves--such as we see in myriads; watching them\r\nbud, grow, fall, and then kicking them along on the ground as if they\r\nwere worth nothing. Yet, how wonderful they are--every one of them\r\na little different. I don't suppose you could ever find two leaves\r\nexactly alike, in form, colour, and size--no more than you could find\r\ntwo faces alike, or two characters exactly the same. The plan of this\r\nworld is infinite similarity and yet infinite variety.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor examined his leaves with the greatest curiosity--and also\r\na little caterpillar that he found walking over one of them. He coaxed\r\nit to take an additional walk over his finger, which it did with the\r\ngreatest dignity and decorum, as if it, Mr. Caterpillar, were the most\r\nimportant individual in existence. It amused him for a long time; and\r\nwhen a sudden gust of wind blew it overboard, leaves and all, he felt\r\nquite disconsolate.\r\n\r\n\"Still, there must be many live creatures in the world besides\r\ncaterpillars. I should like to see a few of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloak gave a little dip down, as if to say \"All right, my Prince,\"\r\nand bore him across the oak forest to a long fertile valley--called in\r\nScotland a strath, and in England a weald--but what they call it in\r\nthe tongue of Nomansland I do not know. It was made up of cornfields,\r\npasturefields, lanes, hedges, brooks, and ponds. Also, in it were what\r\nthe Prince had desired to see, a quantity of living creatures, wild\r\nand tame. Cows and horses, lambs and sheep, fed in the meadows; pigs\r\nand fowls walked about the farmyards; and, in lonelier places, hares\r\nscudded, rabbits burrowed, and pheasants and partridges, with many\r\nother smaller birds, inhabited the fields and woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_It was made up of cornfields, pasturefields, lanes,\r\nhedges, brooks, and ponds._\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_In it were what the Prince had desired to see, a\r\nquantity of living creatures._\"]\r\n\r\nThrough his wonderful spectacles the Prince could see everything;\r\nbut, as I said, it was a silent picture; he was too high up to catch\r\nanything except a faint murmur, which only aroused his anxiety to hear\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"I have as good as two pairs of eyes,\" he thought. \"I wonder if my\r\ngodmother would give me a second pair of ears.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he spoken, than he found lying on his lap the most curious\r\nlittle parcel, all done up in silvery paper. And it contained--what do\r\nyou think? Actually, a pair of silver ears, which, when he tried them\r\non, fitted so exactly over his own, that he hardly felt them, except\r\nfor the difference they made in his hearing.\r\n\r\nThere is something which we listen to daily and never notice. I mean\r\nthe sounds of the visible world, animate and inanimate. Winds blowing,\r\nwaters flowing, trees stirring, insects whirring (dear me! I am quite\r\nunconsciously writing rhyme), with the various cries of birds and\r\nbeasts--lowing cattle, bleating sheep, grunting pigs, and cackling\r\nhens--all the infinite discords that somehow or other make a beautiful\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nWe hear this, and are so accustomed to it that we think nothing of it;\r\nbut Prince Dolor, who had lived all his days in the dead silence of\r\nHopeless Tower, heard it for the first time. And oh! if you had seen\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nHe listened, listened, as if he could never have done listening. And\r\nhe looked and looked, as if he could not gaze enough. Above all, the\r\nmotion of the animals delighted him: cows walking, horses galloping,\r\nlittle lambs and calves running races across the meadows, were such\r\na treat for him to watch--he that was always so quiet. But, these\r\ncreatures having four legs, and he only two, the difference did not\r\nstrike him painfully.\r\n\r\nStill, by-and-by, after the fashion of children--and, I fear, of many\r\nbig people too--he began to want something more than he had, something\r\nthat would be quite fresh and new.\r\n\r\n\"Godmother,\" he said, having now begun to believe that, whether he saw\r\nher or not, he could always speak to her with full confidence that she\r\nwould hear him--\"Godmother, all these creatures I like exceedingly--but\r\nI should like better to see a creature like myself. Couldn't you show\r\nme just one little boy?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sigh behind him--it might have been only the wind--and the\r\ncloak remained so long balanced motionless in air, that he was half\r\nafraid his godmother had forgotten him, or was offended with him for\r\nasking too much. Suddenly, a shrill whistle startled him, even through\r\nhis silver ears, and looking downwards, he saw start up from behind a\r\nbush on a common, something--\r\n\r\nNeither a sheep, nor a horse, nor a cow--nothing upon four legs. This\r\ncreature had only two; but they were long, straight, and strong. And\r\nit had a lithe active body, and a curly head of black hair set upon\r\nits shoulders. It was a boy, a shepherdboy, about the Prince's own\r\nage--but, oh! so different.\r\n\r\nNot that he was an ugly boy--though his face was almost as red as his\r\nhands, and his shaggy hair matted like the backs of his own sheep. He\r\nwas rather a nice-looking lad; and seemed so bright, and healthy, and\r\ngood-tempered--\"jolly\" would be the word, only I am not sure if they\r\nhave such an one in the elegant language of Nomansland--that the little\r\nPrince watched him with great admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Might he come and play with me? I would drop down to the ground to\r\nhim, or fetch him up to me here. Oh, how nice it would be if I only had\r\na little boy to play with me!\"\r\n\r\nBut the cloak, usually so obedient to his wishes, disobeyed him now.\r\nThere were evidently some things which his godmother either could\r\nnot or would not give. The cloak hung stationary, high in air, never\r\nattempting to descend. The shepherd lad evidently took it for a large\r\nbird and, shading his eyes, looked up at it, making the Prince's heart\r\nbeat fast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_The shepherd lad evidently took it for a large bird._\"]\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing ensued. The boy turned round, with a long, loud\r\nwhistle--seemingly his usual and only way of expressing his feelings.\r\nHe could not make the thing out exactly--it was a rather mysterious\r\naffair, but it did not trouble him much--_he_ was not an \"examining\"\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nThen, stretching himself, for he had been evidently half asleep, he\r\nbegan flopping his shoulders with his arms, to wake and warm himself;\r\nwhile his dog, a rough collie, who had been guarding the sheep\r\nmeanwhile, began to jump upon him, barking with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Down Snap, down! Stop that, or I'll thrash you,\" the Prince heard him\r\nsay; though with such a rough hard voice and queer pronunciation that\r\nit was difficult to make the words out. \"Hollo! Let's warm ourselves by\r\na race.\"\r\n\r\nThey started off together, boy and dog--barking and shouting, till it\r\nwas doubtful which made the most noise or ran the fastest. A regular\r\nsteeple-chase it was: first across the level common, greatly disturbing\r\nthe quiet sheep; and then tearing away across country, scrambling\r\nthrough hedges, and leaping ditches, and tumbling up and down over\r\nploughed fields. They did not seem to have anything to run for--but as\r\nif they did it, both of them, for the mere pleasure of motion.\r\n\r\nAnd what a pleasure that seemed! To the dog of course, but scarcely\r\nless so to the boy. How he skimmed along over the ground--his cheeks\r\nglowing, and his hair flying, and his legs--oh, what a pair of legs he\r\nhad!\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor watched him with great intentness, and in a state of\r\nexcitement almost equal to that of the runner himself--for a while.\r\nThen the sweet pale face grew a trifle paler, the lips began to quiver\r\nand the eyes to fill.\r\n\r\n\"How nice it must be to run like that!\" he said softly, thinking that\r\nnever--no, never in this world--would he be able to do the same.\r\n\r\nNow he understood what his godmother had meant when she gave him his\r\ntravelling-cloak, and why he had heard that sigh--he was sure it was\r\nhers--when he had asked to see \"just one little boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I had rather not look at him again,\" said the poor little\r\nPrince, drawing himself back into the centre of his cloak, and resuming\r\nhis favourite posture, sitting like a Turk, with his arms wrapped round\r\nhis feeble, useless legs.\r\n\r\n\"You're no good to me,\" he said, patting them mournfully. \"You never\r\nwill be any good to me. I wonder why I had you at all; I wonder why I\r\nwas born at all, since I was not to grow up like other little boys.\r\n_Why_ not?\"\r\n\r\nA question, so strange, so sad, yet so often occurring in some form\r\nor other, in this world--as you will find, my children, when you are\r\nolder--that even if he had put it to his mother she could only have\r\nanswered it, as we have to answer many as difficult things, by simply\r\nsaying, \"I don't know.\" There is much that we do not know, and cannot\r\nunderstand--we big folks, no more than you little ones. We have to\r\naccept it all just as you have to accept anything which your parents\r\nmay tell you, even though you don't as yet see the reason of it. You\r\nmay some time if you do exactly as they tell you, and are content to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor sat a good while thus, or it appeared to him a good while,\r\nso many thoughts came and went through his poor young mind--thoughts of\r\ngreat bitterness, which, little though he was, seemed to make him grow\r\nyears older in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThen he fancied the cloak began to rock gently to and fro, with a\r\nsoothing kind of motion, as if he were in somebody's arms: somebody who\r\ndid not speak, but loved him and comforted him without need of words;\r\nnot by deceiving him with false encouragement or hope, but by making\r\nhim see the plain hard truth, in all its hardness, and thus letting him\r\nquietly face it, till it grew softened down, and did not seem nearly so\r\ndreadful after all.\r\n\r\nThrough the dreary silence and blankness, for he had placed himself so\r\nthat he could see nothing but the sky, and had taken off his silver\r\nears, as well as his gold spectacles--what was the use of either when\r\nhe had no legs to walk or run?--up from below there rose a delicious\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nYou have heard it hundreds of times, my children, and so have I. When I\r\nwas a child I thought there was nothing so sweet; and I think so still.\r\nIt was just the song of a skylark, mounting higher and higher from the\r\nground, till it came so close that Prince Dolor could distinguish its\r\nquivering wings and tiny body, almost too tiny to contain such a gush\r\nof music.\r\n\r\n\"O, you beautiful, beautiful bird!\" cried he; \"I should dearly like to\r\ntake you in and cuddle you. That is, if I could--if I dared.\"\r\n\r\nBut he hesitated. The little brown creature with its loud heavenly\r\nvoice almost made him afraid. Nevertheless, it also made him happy;\r\nand he watched and listened--so absorbed that he forgot all regret and\r\npain, forgot everything in the world except the little lark.\r\n\r\nIt soared and soared, and he was just wondering if it would soar out\r\nof sight, and what in the world he should do when it was gone, when it\r\nsuddenly closed its wings, as larks do, when they mean to drop to the\r\nground. But, instead of dropping to the ground, it dropped right into\r\nthe little boy's breast.\r\n\r\nWhat felicity! If it would only stay! A tiny soft thing to fondle and\r\nkiss, to sing to him all day long, and be his playfellow and companion,\r\ntame and tender, while to the rest of the world it was a wild bird of\r\nthe air. What a pride, what a delight! To have something that nobody\r\nelse had--something all his own. As the travelling-cloak travelled on,\r\nhe little heeded where, and the lark still stayed, nestled down in his\r\nbosom, hopped from his hand to his shoulder, and kissed him with its\r\ndainty beak, as if it loved him, Prince Dolor forgot all his grief, and\r\nwas entirely happy.\r\n\r\nBut when he got in sight of Hopeless Tower, a painful thought struck\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"My pretty bird, what am I to do with you? If I take you into my room\r\nand shut you up there, you, a wild skylark of the air, what will become\r\nof you? I am used to this, but you are not. You will be so miserable,\r\nand suppose my nurse should find you--she who can't bear the sound of\r\nsinging? Besides, I remember her once telling me that the nicest thing\r\nshe ever ate in her life was lark pie!\"\r\n\r\nThe little boy shivered all over at the thought. And, though the merry\r\nlark immediately broke into the loudest carol, as if saying derisively\r\nthat he defied anybody to eat _him_--still Prince Dolor was very\r\nuneasy. In another minute he had made up his mind.\r\n\r\n\"No, my bird, nothing so dreadful shall happen to you if I can help it;\r\nI would rather do without you altogether. Yes, I'll try. Fly away, my\r\ndarling, my beautiful! Good-bye, my merry, merry bird.\"\r\n\r\nOpening his two caressing hands, in which, as if for protection, he\r\nhad folded it, he let the lark go. It lingered a minute, perching on\r\nthe rim of the cloak, and looking at him with eyes of almost human\r\ntenderness; then away it flew, far up into the blue sky. It was only a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nBut, some time after, when Prince Dolor had eaten his supper--somewhat\r\ndrearily, except for the thought that he could not possibly sup\r\noff lark pie now--and gone quietly to bed, the old familiar little\r\nbed, where he was accustomed to sleep, or lie awake contentedly\r\nthinking--suddenly he heard outside the window a little faint\r\ncarol--faint but cheerful--cheerful, even though it was the middle of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThe dear little lark! it had not flown away after all. And it was\r\ntruly the most extraordinary bird, for, unlike ordinary larks, it kept\r\nhovering about the tower in the silence and darkness of the night,\r\noutside the window or over the roof. Whenever he listened for a moment,\r\nhe heard it singing still.\r\n\r\nHe went to sleep as happy as a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Happy as a king.\" How far kings are happy I cannot say, no more than\r\ncould Prince Dolor, though he had once been a king himself. But he\r\nremembered nothing about it, and there was nobody to tell him, except\r\nhis nurse, who had been forbidden upon pain of death to let him know\r\nanything about his dead parents, or the king his uncle, or, indeed, any\r\npart of his own history.\r\n\r\nSometimes he speculated about himself, whether he had had a father and\r\nmother as other little boys had, what they had been like, and why he\r\nhad never seen them. But, knowing nothing about them, he did not miss\r\nthem--only once or twice, reading pretty stories about little children\r\nand their mothers, who helped them when they were in difficulty, and\r\ncomforted them when they were sick, he, feeling ill and dull and\r\nlonely, wondered what had become of his mother, and why she never came\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\nThen, in his history lessons, of course, he read about kings and\r\nprinces, and the governments of different countries, and the events\r\nthat happened there. And though he but faintly took in all this, still\r\nhe did take it in, a little, and worried his young brain about it, and\r\nperplexed his nurse with questions, to which she returned sharp and\r\nmysterious answers, which only set him thinking the more.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time for thinking. After his last journey in the\r\ntravelling-cloak, the journey which had given him so much pain, his\r\ndesire to see the world had somehow faded away. He contented himself\r\nwith reading his books, and looking out of the tower windows, and\r\nlistening to his beloved little lark, which had come home with him that\r\nday, and never left him again.\r\n\r\nTrue, it kept out of the way; and though his nurse sometimes dimly\r\nheard it, and said, \"What is that horrid noise outside?\" she never got\r\nthe faintest chance of making it into a lark pie. Prince Dolor had his\r\npet all to himself, and though he seldom saw it, he knew it was near\r\nhim, and he caught continually, at odd hours of the day, and even in\r\nthe night, fragments of its delicious song.\r\n\r\nAll during the winter--so far as there ever was any difference between\r\nsummer and winter in Hopeless Tower--the little bird cheered and amused\r\nhim. He scarcely needed anything more--not even his travelling-cloak,\r\nwhich lay bundled up unnoticed in a corner, tied up in its innumerable\r\nknots. Nor did his godmother come near him. It seemed as if she had\r\ngiven these treasures and left him alone--to use them, or lose them,\r\napply them, or misapply them, according to his own choice. That is all\r\nwe can do with children, when they grow into big children, old enough\r\nto distinguish between right and wrong, and too old to be forced to do\r\neither.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor was now quite a big boy. Not tall--alas! he never could be\r\nthat, with his poor little shrunken legs; which were of no use, only an\r\nencumbrance. But he was stout and strong, with great sturdy shoulders,\r\nand muscular arms, upon which he could swing himself about almost like\r\na monkey. As if in compensation for his useless lower limbs, nature had\r\ngiven to these extra strength and activity. His face, too, was very\r\nhandsome; thinner, firmer, more manly; but still the sweet face of his\r\nchildhood--his mother's own face.\r\n\r\nHow his mother would have liked to look at him! Perhaps she did--who\r\nknows!\r\n\r\nThe boy was not a stupid boy either. He could learn almost anything\r\nhe chose--and he did choose, which was more than half the battle. He\r\nnever gave up his lessons till he had learnt them all--never thought it\r\na punishment that he had to work at them, and that they cost him a deal\r\nof trouble sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" thought he, \"men work, and it must be so grand to be a man;--a\r\nprince too; and I fancy princes work harder than anybody--except kings.\r\nThe princes I read about generally turn into kings. I wonder\"--the\r\nboy was always wondering--\"Nurse\"--and one day he startled her with a\r\nsudden question--\"tell me--shall I ever be a king?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman stood, perplexed beyond expression. So long a time had passed\r\nby since her crime--if it was a crime--and her sentence, that she now\r\nseldom thought of either. Even her punishment--to be shut up for life\r\nin Hopeless Tower--she had gradually got used to. Used also to the\r\nlittle lame prince, her charge--whom at first she had hated, though she\r\ncarefully did everything to keep him alive, since upon him her own life\r\nhung. But latterly she had ceased to hate him, and, in a sort of way,\r\nalmost loved him--at least, enough to be sorry for him--an innocent\r\nchild, imprisoned here till he grew into an old man--and became a dull,\r\nworn-out creature like herself. Sometimes, watching him, she felt more\r\nsorry for him than even for herself; and then, seeing she looked a less\r\nmiserable and ugly woman, he did not shrink from her as usual.\r\n\r\nHe did not now. \"Nurse--dear nurse,\" said he, \"I don't mean to vex you,\r\nbut tell me--what is a king? shall I ever be one?\"\r\n\r\nWhen she began to think less of herself and more of the child, the\r\nwoman's courage increased. The idea came to her--what harm would it be,\r\neven if he did know his own history? Perhaps he ought to know it--for\r\nthere had been various ups and downs, usurpations, revolutions, and\r\nrestorations in Nomansland, as in most other countries. Something might\r\nhappen--who could tell? Changes might occur. Possibly a crown would\r\neven yet be set upon those pretty, fair curls--which she began to think\r\nprettier than ever when she saw the imaginary coronet upon them.\r\n\r\nShe sat down, considering whether her oath, never to \"say a word\" to\r\nPrince Dolor about himself, would be broken, if she were to take a\r\npencil and write what was to be told. A mere quibble--a mean, miserable\r\nquibble. But then she was a miserable woman, more to be pitied than\r\nscorned.\r\n\r\nAfter long doubt, and with great trepidation, she put her finger to her\r\nlips, and taking the Prince's slate--with the sponge tied to it, ready\r\nto rub out the writing in a minute--she wrote--\r\n\r\n\"You are a king.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_After long doubt ... she put her finger to her lips,\r\nand taking the Prince's slate ... wrote--'You are a king.'_\"]\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor started. His face grew pale, and then flushed all over;\r\nhis eyes glistened; he held himself erect. Lame as he was, anybody\r\ncould see he was born to be a king.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said his nurse, as he was beginning to speak. And then,\r\nterribly frightened all the while--people who have done wrong always\r\nare frightened--she wrote down in a few hurried sentences his history.\r\nHow his parents had died--his uncle had usurped his throne, and sent\r\nhim to end his days in this lonely tower.\r\n\r\n\"I, too,\" added she, bursting into tears. \"Unless, indeed, you could\r\nget out into the world, and fight for your rights like a man. And fight\r\nfor me also, my prince, that I may not die in this desolate place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old nurse!\" said the boy compassionately. For somehow, boy as he\r\nwas, when he heard he was born to be a king, he felt like a man--like a\r\nking--who could afford to be tender because he was strong.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely slept that night, and even though he heard his little lark\r\nsinging in the sunrise, he barely listened to it. Things more serious\r\nand important had taken possession of his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" thought he, \"I were to do as she says, and go out into the\r\nworld, no matter how it hurts me--the world of people, active people,\r\nas active as that boy I saw. They might only laugh at me--poor helpless\r\ncreature that I am; but still I might show them I could do something.\r\nAt any rate, I might go and see if there was anything for me to do.\r\nGodmother, help me!\"\r\n\r\nIt was so long since he had asked her help, that he was hardly\r\nsurprised when he got no answer--only the little lark outside the\r\nwindow sang louder and louder, and the sun rose, flooding the room with\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor sprang out of bed, and began dressing himself which was\r\nhard work, for he was not used to it--he had always been accustomed to\r\ndepend upon his nurse for everything.\r\n\r\n\"But I must now learn to be independent,\" thought he. \"Fancy a king\r\nbeing dressed like a baby!\"\r\n\r\nSo he did the best he could--awkwardly but cheerily--and then he leaped\r\nto the corner where lay his travelling-cloak, untied it as before,\r\nand watched it unrolling itself--which it did rapidly, with a hearty\r\ngood-will, as if quite tired of idleness. So was Prince Dolor--or felt\r\nas if he was. He jumped into the middle of it, said his charm, and was\r\nout through the skylight immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, pretty lark!\" he shouted, as he passed it on the wing, still\r\nwarbling its carol to the newly-risen sun. \"You have been my pleasure,\r\nmy delight; now I must go and work. Sing to old nurse till I come back\r\nagain. Perhaps she'll hear you--perhaps she won't--but it will do her\r\ngood all the same. Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nBut, as the cloak hung irresolute in air, he suddenly remembered that\r\nhe had not determined where to go--indeed, he did not know, and there\r\nwas nobody to tell him.\r\n\r\n\"Godmother,\" he cried, in much perplexity, \"you know what I want--at\r\nleast, I hope you do, for I hardly do myself--take me where I ought to\r\ngo; show me whatever I ought so see--never mind what I like to see,\"\r\nas a sudden idea came into his mind that he might see many painful and\r\ndisagreeable things. But this journey was not for pleasure--as before.\r\nHe was not a baby now, to do nothing but play--big boys do not always\r\nplay. Nor men neither--they work. Thus much Prince Dolor knew--though\r\nvery little more. And as the cloak started off, travelling faster\r\nthan he had ever known it to do--through sky-land and cloud-land,\r\nover freezing mountain-tops, and desolate stretches of forest, and\r\nsmiling cultivated plains, and great lakes that seemed to him almost as\r\nshoreless as the sea--he was often rather frightened. But he crouched\r\ndown, silent and quiet; what was the use of making a fuss? and,\r\nwrapping himself up in his bear-skin, waited for what was to happen.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he heard a murmur in the distance, increasing more\r\nand more till it grew like the hum of a gigantic hive of bees. And,\r\nstretching his chin over the rim of his cloak, Prince Dolor saw--far,\r\nfar below him, yet with his gold spectacles and silver ears on, he\r\ncould distinctly hear and see--What?\r\n\r\nMost of us have sometime or other visited a great metropolis--have\r\nwandered through its network of streets--lost ourselves in its crowds\r\nof people--looked up at its tall rows of houses, its grand public\r\nbuildings, churches and squares. Also, perhaps, we have peeped into its\r\nmiserable little back alleys, where dirty children play in gutters all\r\nday and half the night--or where men reel tipsy and women fight--where\r\neven young boys go about picking pockets, with nobody to tell them it\r\nis wrong, except the policeman; and he simply takes them off to prison.\r\nAnd all this wretchedness is close behind the grandeur--like the two\r\nsides of the leaf of a book.\r\n\r\nAn awful sight is a large city, seen anyhow, from anywhere. But,\r\nsuppose you were to see it from the upper air; where, with your eyes\r\nand ears open, you could take in everything at once? What would it look\r\nlike? How would you feel about it? I hardly know myself. Do you?\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor had need to be a king--that is, a boy with a kingly\r\nnature--to be able to stand such a sight without being utterly\r\novercome. But he was very much bewildered--as bewildered as a blind\r\nperson who is suddenly made to see.\r\n\r\nHe gazed down on the city below him, and then put his hand over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"I can't bear to look at it, it is so beautiful--so dreadful. And I\r\ndon't understand it--not one bit. There is nobody to tell me about it.\r\nI wish I had somebody to speak to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you? Then pray speak to me. I was always considered good at\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that squeaked out this reply was an excellent imitation of\r\nthe human one, though it came only from a bird. No lark this time,\r\nhowever, but a great black and white creature that flew into the cloak,\r\nand began walking round and round on the edge of it with a dignified\r\nstride, one foot before the other, like any unfeathered biped you could\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the honour of your acquaintance, sir,\" said the boy politely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_One half the people seemed so happy and busy._\" _Page\r\n90._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_The other half were so wretched and miserable._\" _Page\r\n90._]\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am, if you please. I am a mother bird, and my name is Mag, and\r\nI shall be happy to tell you everything you want to know. For I know\r\na great deal; and I enjoy talking. My family is of great antiquity;\r\nwe have built in this palace for hundreds--that is to say, dozens of\r\nyears. I am intimately acquainted with the King, the Queen, and the\r\nlittle princes and princesses--also the maids of honour, and all the\r\ninhabitants of the city. I talk a good deal, but I always talk sense,\r\nand I dare say I should be exceedingly useful to a poor little ignorant\r\nboy like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a prince,\" said the other gently.\r\n\r\n\"All right. And I am a magpie. You will find me a most respectable\r\nbird.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" was the polite answer--though he thought in\r\nhis own mind that Mag must have a very good opinion of herself. But she\r\nwas a lady and a stranger, so, of course, he was civil to her.\r\n\r\nShe settled herself at his elbow, and began to chatter away, pointing\r\nout with one skinny claw while she balanced herself on the other,\r\nevery object of interest,--evidently believing, as no doubt all its\r\ninhabitants did, that there was no capital in the world like the great\r\nmetropolis of Nomansland.\r\n\r\nI have not seen it, and therefore cannot describe it, so we will just\r\ntake it upon trust, and suppose it to be, like every other fine city,\r\nthe finest city that ever was built. \"Mag\" said so--and of course she\r\nknew. Nevertheless, there were a few things in it which surprised\r\nPrince Dolor--and, as he had said, he could not understand them at all.\r\nOne half the people seemed so happy and busy--hurrying up and down\r\nthe full streets, or driving lazily along the parks in their grand\r\ncarriages, while the other half were so wretched and miserable.\r\n\r\n\"Can't the world be made a little more level? I would try to do it if\r\nI were the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not the king: only a little goose of a boy,\" returned the\r\nmagpie loftily. \"And I'm here not to explain things, only to show them.\r\nShall I show you the royal palace?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a very magnificent palace. It had terraces and gardens,\r\nbattlements and towers. It extended over acres of ground, and had in\r\nit rooms enough to accommodate half the city. Its windows looked in\r\nall directions, but none of them had any particular view--except a\r\nsmall one, high up towards the roof, which looked on to the Beautiful\r\nMountains. But since the Queen died there, it had been closed, boarded\r\nup, indeed, the magpie said. It was so little and inconvenient, that\r\nnobody cared to live in it. Besides, the lower apartments, which had no\r\nview, were magnificent--worthy of being inhabited by his Majesty the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_It had terraces and gardens, battlements and towers\r\n... and had in it rooms enough to accommodate half the city._\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_Its windows looked in all directions ... except a\r\nsmall one, high up towards the roof, which looked on to the Beautiful\r\nMountains._\"]\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see the King,\" said Prince Dolor.\r\n\r\nBut what followed was so important that I must take another chapter to\r\ntell it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, I wonder, would be most people's idea of a king?\r\n\r\nWhat was Prince Dolor's?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a very splendid personage, with a crown on his head, and a\r\nsceptre in his hand, sitting on a throne, and judging the people.\r\nAlways doing right, and never wrong--\"The king can do no wrong\" was\r\na law laid down in olden times. Never cross, or tired, or sick, or\r\nsuffering; perfectly handsome and well-dressed, calm and good-tempered,\r\nready to see and hear everybody, and discourteous to nobody; all things\r\nalways going well with him, and nothing unpleasant ever happening.\r\n\r\nThis, probably, was what Prince Dolor expected to see. And what did he\r\nsee? But I must tell you how he saw it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the magpie, \"no levée to-day. The King is ill, though his\r\nMajesty does not wish it to be generally known--it would be so very\r\ninconvenient. He can't see you, but perhaps you might like to go and\r\ntake a look at him, in a way I often do? It is so very amusing.\"\r\n\r\nAmusing, indeed!\r\n\r\nThe Prince was just now too much excited to talk much. Was he not going\r\nto see the King his uncle, who had succeeded his father, and dethroned\r\nhimself; had stepped into all the pleasant things that he, Prince\r\nDolor, ought to have had, and shut him up in a desolate tower? What\r\nwas he like, this great, bad, clever man? Had he got all the things he\r\nwanted, which another ought to have had? And did he enjoy them?\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows,\" answered the magpie, just as if she had been sitting\r\ninside the Prince's heart, instead of on the top of his shoulder. \"He\r\nis a king, and that's enough. For the rest nobody knows.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke Mag flew down on to the palace roof, where the cloak\r\nhad rested, settling down between the great stacks of chimneys as\r\ncomfortably as if on the ground. She pecked at the tiles with her\r\nbeak--truly she was a wonderful bird--and immediately a little hole\r\nopened, a sort of door, through which could be seen distinctly the\r\nchamber below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_She pecked at the tiles with her beak ... a little\r\nhole opened ... 'Now look in, Prince. Make haste, for I must soon shut\r\nit up again.'_\" _Page 92._]\r\n\r\n\"Now look in, my prince. Make haste, for I must soon shut it up again.\"\r\n\r\nBut the boy hesitated. \"Isn't it rude?--won't they think us--intruding?\"\r\n\r\n\"O dear no! there's a hole like this in every palace; dozens of holes,\r\nindeed. Everybody knows it, but nobody speaks of it. Intrusion! Why,\r\nthough the Royal family are supposed to live shut up behind stone\r\nwalls ever so thick, all the world knows that they live in a glass\r\nhouse where everybody can see them, and throw a stone at them. Now, pop\r\ndown on your knees, and take a peep at his Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty!\r\n\r\nThe Prince gazed eagerly down, into a large room, the largest room he\r\nhad ever beheld, with furniture and hangings grander than anything he\r\ncould have ever imagined. A stray sunbeam, coming through a crevice\r\nof the darkened windows, struck across the carpet, and it was the\r\nloveliest carpet ever woven--just like a bed of flowers to walk over;\r\nonly nobody walked over it; the room being perfectly empty and silent.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the King?\" asked the puzzled boy.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Mag, pointing with one wrinkled claw to a magnificent\r\nbed, large enough to contain six people. In the centre of it, just\r\nvisible under the silken counterpane--quite straight and still--with\r\nits head on the lace pillow--lay a small figure, something like\r\nwaxwork, fast asleep--very fast asleep! There were a quantity of\r\nsparkling rings on the tiny yellow hands, that were curled a little,\r\nhelplessly, like a baby's, outside the coverlet; the eyes were shut,\r\nthe nose looked sharp and thin, and the long grey beard hid the mouth,\r\nand lay over the breast. A sight not ugly, nor frightening, only solemn\r\nand quiet. And so very silent--two little flies buzzing about the\r\ncurtains of the bed, being the only audible sound.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the King?\" whispered Prince Dolor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the bird.\r\n\r\nHe had been angry--furiously angry; ever since he knew how his uncle\r\nhad taken the crown, and sent him, a poor little helpless child, to be\r\nshut up for life, just as if he had been dead. Many times the boy had\r\nfelt as if, king as he was, he should like to strike him, this great,\r\nstrong, wicked man.\r\n\r\nWhy, you might as well have struck a baby! How helpless he lay! with\r\nhis eyes shut, and his idle hands folded: they had no more work to do,\r\nbad or good.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with him?\" asked the Prince again.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" said the Magpie with a croak.\r\n\r\nNo, there was not the least use in being angry with him now. On the\r\ncontrary, the Prince felt almost sorry for him, except that he looked\r\nso peaceful, with all his cares at rest. And this was being dead? So,\r\neven kings died?\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, he hadn't an easy life, folk say, for all his grandeur.\r\nPerhaps he is glad it is over. Good-bye, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nWith another cheerful tap of her beak, Mistress Mag shut down the\r\nlittle door in the tiles, and Prince Dolor's first and last sight of\r\nhis uncle was ended.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the centre of his travelling-cloak silent and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" said the Magpie. \"There's nothing much\r\nmore to be done with his Majesty, except a fine funeral, which I\r\nshall certainly go and see. All the world will. He interested the\r\nworld exceedingly when he was alive, and he ought to do it now he's\r\ndead--just once more. And since he can't hear me, I may as well say\r\nthat, on the whole, his Majesty is much better dead than alive--if\r\nwe can only get somebody in his place. There'll be such a row in the\r\ncity presently. Suppose we float up again, and see it all. At a safe\r\ndistance, though. It will be such fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will be fun?\"\r\n\r\n\"A revolution.\"\r\n\r\nWhether anybody except a magpie would have called it \"fun,\" I don't\r\nknow, but it certainly was a remarkable scene.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Cathedral bell began to toll, and the minute guns to\r\nfire, announcing to the kingdom that it was without a king, the people\r\ngathered in crowds, stopping at street corners to talk together. The\r\nmurmur now and then rose into a shout, and the shout into a roar. When\r\nPrince Dolor, quietly floating in upper air, caught the sound of their\r\ndifferent and opposite cries, it seemed to him as if the whole city had\r\ngone mad together.\r\n\r\n\"Long live the King!\" \"The King is dead--down with the King!\" \"Down\r\nwith the crown, and the King too!\" \"Hurrah for the Republic!\" \"Hurrah\r\nfor no Government at all.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the shouts which travelled up to the travelling-cloak. And\r\nthen began--oh, what a scene!\r\n\r\nWhen you children are grown men and women--or before--you will hear and\r\nread in books about what are called revolutions--earnestly I trust that\r\nneither I nor you may ever see one. But they have happened, and may\r\nhappen again, in other countries beside Nomansland, when wicked kings\r\nhave helped to make their people wicked too, or out of an unrighteous\r\nnation have sprung rulers equally bad; or, without either of these\r\ncauses, when a restless country has fancied any change better than no\r\nchange at all.\r\n\r\nFor me, I don't like changes, unless pretty sure that they are for\r\ngood. And how good can come out of absolute evil--the horrible evil\r\nthat went on this night under Prince Dolor's very eyes--soldiers\r\nshooting people down by hundreds in the streets, scaffolds erected, and\r\nheads dropping off--houses burnt, and women and children murdered--this\r\nis more than I can understand.\r\n\r\nBut all these things you will find in history, my children, and must\r\nby-and-by judge for yourselves the right and wrong of them, as far as\r\nanybody ever can judge.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor saw it all. Things happened so fast after one another that\r\nthey quite confused his faculties.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me go home,\" he cried at last, stopping his ears and shutting\r\nhis eyes; \"only let me go home!\" for even his lonely tower seemed home,\r\nand its dreariness and silence absolute paradise after all this.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, then,\" said the magpie, flapping her wings. She had been\r\nchatting incessantly all day and all night, for it was actually thus\r\nlong that Prince Dolor had been hovering over the city, neither eating\r\nnor sleeping, with all these terrible things happening under his very\r\neyes. \"You've had enough, I suppose, of seeing the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have--I have!\" cried the Prince with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"That is, till next time. All right, your Royal Highness. You don't\r\nknow me, but I know you. We may meet again sometime.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with her clear piercing eyes, sharp enough to see\r\nthrough everything, and it seemed as if they changed from bird's eyes\r\nto human eyes, the very eyes of his godmother, whom he had not seen for\r\never so long. But the minute afterwards she became only a bird, and\r\nwith a screech and a chatter spread her wings and flew away.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor fell into a kind of swoon, of utter misery, bewilderment,\r\nand exhaustion, and when he awoke he found himself in his own\r\nroom--alone and quiet--with the dawn just breaking, and the long rim of\r\nyellow light in the horizon glimmering through the window panes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Dolor sat up in bed, trying to remember where he was,\r\nwhither he had been, and what he had seen the day before, he perceived\r\nthat his room was empty.\r\n\r\nGenerally, his nurse rather worried him by breaking his slumbers,\r\ncoming in and \"setting things to rights,\" as she called it. Now, the\r\ndust lay thick upon chairs and tables; there was no harsh voice heard\r\nto scold him for not getting up immediately--which, I am sorry to say,\r\nthis boy did not always do. For he so enjoyed lying still, and thinking\r\nlazily, about everything or nothing, that, if he had not tried hard\r\nagainst it, he would certainly have become like those celebrated\r\n\r\n                  \"Two little men\r\n            Who lay in their bed till the clock struck ten.\"\r\n\r\nIt was striking ten now, and still no nurse was to be seen. He was\r\nrather relieved at first, for he felt so tired; and besides when he\r\nstretched out his arm, he found to his dismay that he had gone to bed\r\nin his clothes.\r\n\r\nVery uncomfortable he felt, of course; and just a little frightened.\r\nEspecially when he began to call and call again, but nobody answered.\r\nOften he used to think how nice it would be to get rid of his nurse and\r\nlive in this tower all by himself--like a sort of monarch, able to do\r\neverything he liked, and leave undone all that he did not want to do;\r\nbut now that this seemed really to have happened, he did not like it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Nurse--dear nurse--please come back!\" he called out. \"Come back, and I\r\nwill be the best boy in all the land.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when she did not come back, and nothing but silence answered his\r\nlamentable call, he very nearly began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do,\" he said at last, dashing the tears from his eyes.\r\n\"It's just like a baby, and I'm a big boy--shall be a man some day.\r\nWhat has happened, I wonder? I'll go and see.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang out of bed--not to his feet, alas! but to his poor little\r\nweak knees, and crawled on them from room to room. All the four\r\nchambers were deserted--not forlorn or untidy, for everything seemed\r\nto have been done for his comfort--the breakfast and dinner-things\r\nwere laid, the food spread in order. He might live \"like a prince,\"\r\nas the proverb is, for several days. But the place was entirely\r\nforsaken--there was evidently not a creature but himself in the\r\nsolitary tower.\r\n\r\nA great fear came upon the poor boy. Lonely as his life had been,\r\nhe had never known what it was to be absolutely alone. A kind of\r\ndespair seized him--no violent anger or terror, but a sort of patient\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world am I to do?\" thought he, and sat down in the middle\r\nof the floor, half inclined to believe that it would be better to give\r\nup entirely, lay himself down and die.\r\n\r\nThis feeling, however, did not last long, for he was young and strong,\r\nand I said before, by nature a very courageous boy. There came into his\r\nhead, somehow or other, a proverb that his nurse had taught him--the\r\npeople of Nomansland were very fond of proverbs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \"For every evil under the sun\r\n                    There is a remedy, or there's none;\r\n                    If there is one, try to find it--\r\n                    If there isn't, never mind it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wonder--is there a remedy now, and could I find it?\" cried the\r\nPrince, jumping up and looking out of the window.\r\n\r\nNo help there. He only saw the broad bleak sunshiny plain--that is, at\r\nfirst. But, by-and-by, in the circle of mud that surrounded the base\r\nof the tower he perceived distinctly the marks of a horse's feet, and\r\njust in the spot where the deaf-mute was accustomed to tie up his great\r\nblack charger, while he himself ascended, there lay the remains of a\r\nbundle of hay and a feed of corn.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's it. He has come and gone, taking nurse away with him. Poor\r\nnurse! how glad she would be to go!\"\r\n\r\nThat was Prince Dolor's first thought. His second--wasn't it\r\nnatural?--was a passionate indignation at her cruelty--at the cruelty\r\nof all the world towards him--a poor little helpless boy. Then he\r\ndetermined--forsaken as he was--to try and hold on to the last, and not\r\nto die as long as he could possibly help it.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it would be easier to die here than out in the world, among the\r\nterrible doings which he had just beheld. From the midst of which, it\r\nsuddenly struck him, the deaf-mute had come--contrived somehow to make\r\nthe nurse understand that the king was dead, and she need have no fear\r\nin going back to the capital, where there was a grand revolution, and\r\neverything turned upside down. So, of course she had gone.\r\n\r\n\"I hope she'll enjoy it, miserable woman--if they don't cut off her\r\nhead too.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then a kind of remorse smote him for feeling so bitterly towards\r\nher, after all the years she had taken care of him--grudgingly,\r\nperhaps, and coldly; still, she had taken care of him, and that even\r\nto the last: for, as I have said, all his four rooms were as tidy as\r\npossible, and his meals laid out, that he might have no more trouble\r\nthan could be helped.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly she did not mean to be cruel. I won't judge her,\" said he.\r\nAnd afterwards he was very glad that he had so determined.\r\n\r\nFor the second time he tried to dress himself, and then to do\r\neverything he could for himself--even to sweeping up the hearth and\r\nputting on more coals. \"It's a funny thing for a prince to have to do,\"\r\nsaid he laughing. \"But my godmother once said princes need never mind\r\ndoing anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he thought a little of his godmother. Not of summoning her,\r\nor asking her to help him--she had evidently left him to help himself,\r\nand he was determined to try his best to do it, being a very proud and\r\nindependent boy--but he remembered her, tenderly and regretfully, as\r\nif even she had been a little hard upon him--poor, forlorn boy that he\r\nwas! But he seemed to have seen and learned so much within the last few\r\ndays, that he scarcely felt like a boy, but a man--until he went to bed\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child, I used often to think how nice it would be to live\r\nin a little house all by my own self--a house built high up in a tree,\r\nor far away in a forest, or half way up a hillside,--so deliciously\r\nalone and independent. Not a lesson to learn--but no! I always liked\r\nlearning my lessons. Anyhow, to choose the lessons I liked best, to\r\nhave as many books to read and dolls to play with as ever I wanted:\r\nabove all, to be free and at rest, with nobody to teaze, or trouble, or\r\nscold me, would be charming. For I was a lonely little thing, who liked\r\nquietness--as many children do; which other children, and sometimes\r\ngrown-up people even, cannot always understand. And so I can understand\r\nPrince Dolor.\r\n\r\nAfter his first despair, he was not merely comfortable, but actually\r\nhappy in his solitude, doing everything for himself, and enjoying\r\neverything by himself--until bedtime.\r\n\r\nThen, he did not like it at all. No more, I suppose, than other\r\nchildren would have liked my imaginary house in a tree, when they had\r\nhad sufficient of their own company.\r\n\r\nBut the prince had to bear it--and he did bear it--like a prince: for\r\nfully five days. All that time he got up in the morning and went to\r\nbed at night, without having spoken to a creature, or, indeed, heard\r\na single sound. For even his little lark was silent: and as for his\r\ntravelling-cloak, either he never thought about it, or else it had been\r\nspirited away--for he made no use of it, nor attempted to do so.\r\n\r\nA very strange existence it was, those five lonely days. He never\r\nentirely forgot it. It threw him back upon himself, and into\r\nhimself--in a way that all of us have to learn when we grow up, and are\r\nthe better for it--but it is somewhat hard learning.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day, Prince Dolor had a strange composure in his look, but\r\nhe was very grave, and thin, and white. He had nearly come to the end\r\nof his provisions--and what was to happen next? Get out of the tower he\r\ncould not; the ladder the deaf-mute used was always carried away again;\r\nand if it had not been, how could the poor boy have used it? And even\r\nif he slung or flung himself down, and by miraculous chance came alive\r\nto the foot of the tower how could he run away?\r\n\r\nFate had been very hard to him, or so it seemed.\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind to die. Not that he wished to die; on the contrary,\r\nthere was a great deal that he wished to live to do; but if he must\r\ndie, he must. Dying did not seem so very dreadful; not even to lie\r\nquiet like his uncle, whom he had entirely forgiven now, and neither be\r\nmiserable nor naughty any more, and escape all those horrible things\r\nthat he had seen going on outside the palace, in that awful place which\r\nwas called \"the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great deal nicer here,\" said the poor little Prince, and\r\ncollected all his pretty things round him: his favourite pictures,\r\nwhich he thought he should like to have near him when he died; his\r\nbooks and toys--no, he had ceased to care for toys now; he only liked\r\nthem because he had done so as a child. And there he sat very calm and\r\npatient, like a king in his castle, waiting for the end.\r\n\r\n\"Still, I wish I had done something first--something worth doing, that\r\nsomebody might remember me by,\" thought he. \"Suppose I had grown a man,\r\nand had had work to do, and people to care for, and was so useful and\r\nbusy that they liked me, and perhaps even forgot I was lame. Then, it\r\nwould have been nice to live, I think.\"\r\n\r\nA tear came into the little fellow's eyes, and he listened intently\r\nthrough the dead silence for some hopeful sound.\r\n\r\nWas there one--was it his little lark, whom he had almost forgotten?\r\nNo, nothing half so sweet. But it really was something--something which\r\ncame nearer and nearer, so that there was no mistaking it. It was the\r\nsound of a trumpet, one of the great silver trumpets so admired in\r\nNomansland. Not pleasant music, but very bold, grand, and inspiring.\r\n\r\nAs he listened to it the boy seemed to recall many things which had\r\nslipped his memory for years, and to nerve himself for whatever might\r\nbe going to happen.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was this.\r\n\r\nThe poor condemned woman had not been such a wicked woman after all.\r\nPerhaps her courage was not wholly disinterested, but she had done a\r\nvery heroic thing. As soon as she heard of the death and burial of\r\nthe King, and of the changes that were taking place in the country, a\r\ndaring idea came into her head--to set upon the throne of Nomansland\r\nits rightful heir. Thereupon she persuaded the deaf-mute to take her\r\naway with him, and they galloped like the wind from city to city,\r\nspreading everywhere the news that Prince Dolor's death and burial\r\nhad been an invention concocted by his wicked uncle--that he was alive\r\nand well, and the noblest young Prince that ever was born.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold stroke, but it succeeded. The country, weary, perhaps,\r\nof the late King's harsh rule, and yet glad to save itself from the\r\nhorrors of the last few days, and the still further horrors of no rule\r\nat all, and having no particular interest in the other young princes,\r\njumped at the idea of this Prince, who was the son of their late good\r\nKing and the beloved Queen Dolorez.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for Prince Dolor! Let Prince Dolor be our sovereign!\" rang\r\nfrom end to end of the kingdom. Everybody tried to remember what a\r\ndear baby he once was--how like his mother, who had been so sweet and\r\nkind, and his father, the finest looking king that ever reigned. Nobody\r\nremembered his lameness--or, if they did, they passed it over as a\r\nmatter of no consequence. They were determined to have him to reign\r\nover them, boy as he was--perhaps just because he was a boy, since in\r\nthat case the great nobles thought they should be able to do as they\r\nliked with the country.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with a fickleness not confined to the people of\r\nNomansland, no sooner was the late King laid in his grave than they\r\npronounced him to have been a usurper; turned all his family out of\r\nthe palace, and left it empty for the reception of the new sovereign,\r\nwhom they went to fetch with great rejoicing; a select body of lords,\r\ngentlemen, and soldiers, travelling night and day in solemn procession\r\nthrough the country, until they reached Hopeless Tower.\r\n\r\nThere they found the Prince, sitting calmly on the floor--deadly pale\r\nindeed, for he expected a quite different end from this, and was\r\nresolved if he had to die, to die courageously, like a prince and a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nBut when they hailed him as prince and king, and explained to him how\r\nmatters stood, and went down on their knees before him, offering the\r\ncrown (on a velvet cushion, with four golden tassels, each nearly as\r\nbig as his head)--small though he was and lame, which lameness the\r\ncourtiers pretended not to notice--there came such a glow into his\r\nface, such a dignity into his demeanour, that he became beautiful,\r\nking-like.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"if you desire it, I will be your king. And I will do\r\nmy best to make my people happy.\"\r\n\r\nThen there arose, from inside and outside the tower, such a shout as\r\nnever yet was heard across the lonely plain.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor shrank a little from the deafening sound. \"How shall I be\r\nable to rule all this great people? You forget, my lords, that I am\r\nonly a little boy still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very little,\" was the respectful answer. \"We have searched\r\nin the records, and found that your Royal Highness--your Majesty, I\r\nmean--is precisely fifteen years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" said Prince Dolor; and his first thought was a thoroughly\r\nchildish pleasure that he should now have a birthday, with a whole\r\nnation to keep it. Then he remembered that his childish days were\r\ndone. He was a monarch now. Even his nurse, to whom, the moment he saw\r\nher, he had held out his hand, kissed it reverently, and called him\r\nceremoniously \"his Majesty the King.\"\r\n\r\n\"A king must be always a king, I suppose,\" said he half sadly, when,\r\nthe ceremonies over, he had been left to himself for just ten minutes,\r\nto put off his boy's clothes, and be re-attired in magnificent robes,\r\nbefore he was conveyed away from his tower to the Royal Palace.\r\n\r\nHe could take nothing with him; indeed, he soon saw that, however\r\npolitely they spoke, they would not allow him to take anything. If\r\nhe was to be their king, he must give up his old life for ever. So he\r\nlooked with tender farewell on his old books, old toys, the furniture\r\nhe knew so well, and the familiar plain in all its levelness, ugly yet\r\npleasant, simply because it was familiar.\r\n\r\n\"It will be a new life in a new world,\" said he to himself; \"but I'll\r\nremember the old things still. And, oh! if before I go, I could but\r\nonce see my dear old godmother.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, he had laid himself down on the bed for a minute or\r\ntwo, rather tired with his grandeur, and confused by the noise of\r\nthe trumpets which kept playing incessantly down below. He gazed,\r\nhalf sadly, up to the skylight, whence there came pouring a stream of\r\nsun-rays, with innumerable motes floating there, like a bridge thrown\r\nbetween heaven and earth. Sliding down it, as if she had been made of\r\nair, came the little old woman in grey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_There came pouring a stream of sun-rays ... like a\r\nbridge ... Sliding down it, as if she had been made of air, came the\r\nlittle old woman in grey._\"]\r\n\r\nSo beautiful looked she--old as she was--that Prince Dolor was at first\r\nquite startled by the apparition. Then he held out his arms in eager\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\"O, godmother, you have not forsaken me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, my son. You may not have seen me, but I have seen you,\r\nmany a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, never mind. I can turn into anything I please, you know. And I\r\nhave been a bear-skin rug, and a crystal goblet--and sometimes I have\r\nchanged from inanimate to animate nature, put on feathers, and made\r\nmyself very comfortable as a bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" laughed the Prince, a new light breaking in upon him, as he\r\ncaught the infection of her tone, lively and mischievous. \"Ha, ha! a\r\nlark, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or a magpie,\" answered she, with a capital imitation of Mistress\r\nMag's croaky voice. \"Do you suppose I am always sentimental and never\r\nfunny?--If anything makes you happy, gay or grave, don't you think it\r\nis more than likely to come through your old godmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that,\" said the boy tenderly, holding out his arms. They\r\nclasped one another in a close embrace.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Prince Dolor looked very anxious. \"You will not leave me now\r\nthat I am a king? Otherwise, I had rather not be a king at all. Promise\r\nnever to forsake me?\"\r\n\r\nThe little old woman laughed gaily. \"Forsake you? that is impossible.\r\nBut it is just possible you may forsake me. Not probable though. Your\r\nmother never did, and she was a queen. The sweetest queen in all the\r\nworld was the lady Dolorez.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about her,\" said the boy eagerly. \"As I get older I think I\r\ncan understand more. Do tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now. You couldn't hear me for the trumpets and the shouting. But\r\nwhen you are come to the palace, ask for a long-closed upper room,\r\nwhich looks out upon the Beautiful Mountains; open it and take it for\r\nyour own. Whenever you go there, you will always find me, and we will\r\ntalk together about all sorts of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"And about my mother?\"\r\n\r\nThe little old woman nodded--and kept nodding and smiling to herself\r\nmany times, as the boy repeated over and over again the sweet words he\r\nhad never known or understood--\"my mother--my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I must go,\" said she, as the trumpets blared louder and louder,\r\nand the shouts of the people showed that they would not endure any\r\ndelay. \"Good-bye, Good-bye! Open the window and out I fly.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Dolor repeated gaily the musical rhyme--but all the while tried\r\nto hold his godmother fast.\r\n\r\nVain, vain!--for the moment that a knocking was heard at his door, the\r\nsun went behind a cloud, the bright stream of dancing motes vanished,\r\nand the little old woman with them--he knew not where.\r\n\r\nSo Prince Dolor quitted his tower--which he had entered so mournfully\r\nand ignominiously, as a little helpless baby carried in the deaf-mute's\r\narms--quitted it as the great King of Nomansland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_So Prince Dolor quitted his tower ... quitted it as\r\nthe great King of Nomansland._\" _Page 111._]\r\n\r\nThe only thing he took away with him was something so insignificant,\r\nthat none of the lords, gentlemen, and soldiers who escorted him with\r\nsuch triumphant splendour, could possibly notice it--a tiny bundle,\r\nwhich he had found lying on the floor just where the bridge of sunbeams\r\nhad rested. At once he had pounced upon it, and thrust it secretly into\r\nhis bosom, where it dwindled into such small proportions, that it might\r\nhave been taken for a mere chest-comforter--a bit of flannel--or an old\r\npocket-handkerchief!\r\n\r\nIt was his travelling-cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid Prince Dolor become a great king? Was he, though little more than\r\na boy, \"the father of his people,\" as all kings ought to be? Did his\r\nreign last long--long and happy?--and what were the principal events of\r\nit, as chronicled in the history of Nomansland?\r\n\r\nWhy, if I were to answer all these questions, I should have to write\r\nanother book. And I'm tired, children, tired--as grown-up people\r\nsometimes are; though not always with play. (Besides, I have a small\r\nperson belonging to me, who, though she likes extremely to listen to\r\nthe word-of-mouth story of this book, grumbles much at the writing of\r\nit, and has run about the house clapping her hands with joy when mamma\r\ntold her that it was nearly finished. But that is neither here nor\r\nthere.)\r\n\r\nI have related, as well as I could, the history of Prince Dolor, but\r\nwith the history of Nomansland I am as yet unacquainted. If anybody\r\nknows it, perhaps he or she will kindly write it all down in another\r\nbook. But mine is done.\r\n\r\nHowever, of this I am sure, that Prince Dolor made an excellent king.\r\nNobody ever does anything less well, not even the commonest duty of\r\ncommon daily life, for having such a godmother as the little old woman\r\nclothed in grey, whose name is--well, I leave you to guess. Nor, I\r\nthink, is anybody less good, less capable of both work and enjoyment\r\nin after life, for having been a little unhappy in his youth, as the\r\nPrince had been.\r\n\r\nI cannot take upon myself to say that he was always happy now--who\r\nis?--or that he had no cares; just show me the person who is quite free\r\nfrom them! But, whenever people worried and bothered him--as they did\r\nsometimes, with state etiquette, state squabbles, and the like, setting\r\nup themselves and pulling down their neighbours--he would take refuge\r\nin that upper room which looked out on the Beautiful Mountains and,\r\nlaying his head on his godmother's shoulder, become calmed and at rest.\r\n\r\nAlso, she helped him out of any difficulty which now and then\r\noccurred--for there never was such a wise old woman. When the people of\r\nNomansland raised the alarm--as sometimes they did--for what people can\r\nexist without a little fault-finding?--and began to cry out, \"Unhappy\r\nis the nation whose king is a child,\" she would say to him gently,\r\n\"You are a child. Accept the fact. Be humble--be teachable. Lean upon\r\nthe wisdom of others till you have gained your own.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so. He learned how to take advice before attempting to give it,\r\nto obey before he could righteously command. He assembled round him all\r\nthe good and wise of his kingdom--laid all its affairs before them, and\r\nwas guided by their opinions until he had maturely formed his own.\r\n\r\nThis he did, sooner than anybody would have imagined, who did not\r\nknow of his godmother and his travelling-cloak--two secret blessings,\r\nwhich, though many guessed at, nobody quite understood. Nor did they\r\nunderstand why he loved so the little upper room, except that it had\r\nbeen his mother's room, from the window of which, as people remembered\r\nnow, she had used to sit for hours watching the Beautiful Mountains.\r\n\r\nOut of that window he used to fly--not very often; as he grew\r\nolder, the labours of state prevented the frequent use of his\r\ntravelling-cloak; still he did use it sometimes. Only now it was\r\nless for his own pleasure and amusement than to see something, or\r\ninvestigate something, for the good of the country. But he prized his\r\ngodmother's gift as dearly as ever. It was a comfort to him in all his\r\nvexations; an enhancement of all his joys. It made him almost forget\r\nhis lameness--which was never cured.\r\n\r\nHowever, the cruel things which had been once foreboded of him did not\r\nhappen. His misfortune was not such a heavy one after all. It proved\r\nto be much less inconvenience, even to himself, than had been feared.\r\nA council of eminent surgeons and mechanicians invented for him a\r\nwonderful pair of crutches, with the help of which, though he never\r\nwalked easily or gracefully, he did manage to walk, so as to be quite\r\nindependent. And such was the love his people bore him that they never\r\nheard the sound of his crutch on the marble palace-floors without a\r\nleap of the heart, for they knew that good was coming to them whenever\r\nhe approached them.\r\n\r\nThus, though he never walked in processions, never reviewed his troops\r\nmounted on a magnificent charger, nor did any of the things which make\r\na show monarch so much appreciated, he was able for all the duties and\r\na great many of the pleasures of his rank. When he held his levées,\r\nnot standing, but seated on a throne, ingeniously contrived to hide\r\nhis infirmity, the people thronged to greet him; when he drove out\r\nthrough the city streets, shouts followed him wherever he went--every\r\ncountenance brightened as he passed, and his own, perhaps, was the\r\nbrightest of all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_When he drove out through the city streets, shouts\r\nfollowed him wherever he went._\" _Page 116._]\r\n\r\nFirst, because, accepting his affliction as inevitable, he took it\r\npatiently; second, because, being a brave man, he bore it bravely;\r\ntrying to forget himself, and live out of himself, and in and for other\r\npeople. Therefore other people grew to love him so well, that I think\r\nhundreds of his subjects might have been found who were almost ready to\r\ndie for their poor lame King.\r\n\r\nHe never gave them a queen. When they implored him to choose one, he\r\nreplied that his country was his bride, and he desired no other. But,\r\nperhaps, the real reason was that he shrank from any change; and that\r\nno wife in all the world would have been found so perfect, so lovable,\r\nso tender to him in all his weaknesses, as his beautiful old godmother.\r\n\r\nHis four-and-twenty other godfathers and godmothers, or as many of\r\nthem as were still alive, crowded round him as soon as he ascended the\r\nthrone. He was very civil to them all, but adopted none of the names\r\nthey had given him, keeping to the one by which he had been always\r\nknown, though it had now almost lost its meaning; for King Dolor was\r\none of the happiest and cheerfullest men alive.\r\n\r\nHe did a good many things, however, unlike most men and most kings,\r\nwhich a little astonished his subjects. First, he pardoned the\r\ncondemned woman who had been his nurse, and ordained that from\r\nhenceforward there should be no such thing as the punishment of death\r\nin Nomansland. All capital criminals were to be sent to perpetual\r\nimprisonment in Hopeless Tower, and the plain round about it, where\r\nthey could do no harm to anybody, and might in time do a little good,\r\nas the woman had done.\r\n\r\nAnother surprise he shortly afterwards gave the nation. He recalled his\r\nuncle's family, who had fled away in terror to another country, and\r\nrestored them to all their honours in their own. By-and-by he chose\r\nthe eldest son of his eldest cousin (who had been dead a year), and\r\nhad him educated in the royal palace, as the heir to the throne. This\r\nlittle prince was a quiet, unobtrusive boy, so that everybody wondered\r\nat the King's choosing him, when there were so many more; but as he\r\ngrew into a fine young fellow, good and brave, they agreed that the\r\nKing judged more wisely than they.\r\n\r\n\"Not a lame prince neither,\" his Majesty observed one day, watching\r\nhim affectionately; for he was the best runner, the highest leaper,\r\nthe keenest and most active sportsman in the country. \"One cannot make\r\noneself, but one can sometimes help a little in the making of somebody\r\nelse. It is well.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said, not to any of his great lords and ladies, but to a good\r\nold woman--his first homely nurse--whom he had sought for far and\r\nwide, and at last found, in her cottage among the Beautiful Mountains.\r\nHe sent for her to visit him once a year, and treated her with great\r\nhonour until she died. He was equally kind, though somewhat less\r\ntender, to his other nurse, who, after receiving her pardon, returned\r\nto her native town and grew into a great lady, and I hope a good one.\r\nBut as she was so grand a personage now, any little faults she had did\r\nnot show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_But as she was so grand a personage now, any little\r\nfaults she had did not show._\" _Page 118.\r\n\r\nThus King Dolor's reign passed, year after year, long and prosperous.\r\nWhether he was happy--\"as happy as a king\"--is a question no human\r\nbeing can decide. But I think he was, because he had the power of\r\nmaking everybody about him happy, and did it too; also because he was\r\nhis godmother's godson, and could shut himself up with her whenever he\r\nliked, in that quiet little room, in view of the Beautiful Mountains,\r\nwhich nobody else ever saw or cared to see. They were too far off,\r\nand the city lay so low. But there they were, all the time. No change\r\never came to them; and I think, at any day throughout his long reign,\r\nthe King would sooner have lost his crown than have lost sight of the\r\nBeautiful Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn course of time, when the little prince, his cousin, was grown into\r\na tall young man, capable of all the duties of a man, his Majesty did\r\none of the most extraordinary acts ever known in a sovereign beloved by\r\nhis people and prosperous in his reign. He announced that he wished to\r\ninvest his heir with the royal purple--at any rate, for a time--while\r\nhe himself went away on a distant journey, whither he had long desired\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nEverybody marvelled, but nobody opposed him. Who could oppose the\r\ngood King, who was not a young king now? And, besides, the nation had\r\na great admiration for the young Regent--and, possibly, a lurking\r\npleasure in change.\r\n\r\nSo there was fixed a day, when all the people whom it would hold,\r\nassembled in the great square of the capital, to see the young Prince\r\ninstalled solemnly in his new duties, and undertaking his new vows.\r\nHe was a very fine young fellow; tall and straight as a poplar tree,\r\nwith a frank handsome face--a great deal handsomer than the King, some\r\npeople said, but others thought differently. However, as his Majesty\r\nsat on his throne, with his grey hair falling from underneath his\r\ncrown, and a few wrinkles showing in spite of his smile, there was\r\nsomething about his countenance which made his people, even while they\r\nshouted, regard him with a tenderness mixed with awe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"_All the people ... assembled to see the young Prince\r\ninstalled solemnly in his new duties and undertaking his new vows._\"\r\n_Page 119._]\r\n\r\nHe lifted up his thin, slender hand, and there came a silence over the\r\nvast crowd immediately. Then he spoke, in his own accustomed way, using\r\nno grand words, but saying what he had to say in the simplest fashion,\r\nthough with a clearness that struck their ears like the first song of a\r\nbird in the dusk of the morning.\r\n\r\n\"My people, I am tired: I want to rest. I have had a long reign, and\r\ndone much work--at least, as much as I was able to do. Many might have\r\ndone it better than I--but none with a better will. Now I leave it to\r\nothers. I am tired, very tired. Let me go home.\"\r\n\r\nThere rose a murmur--of content or discontent none could well tell;\r\nthen it died down again, and the assembly listened silently once more.\r\n\r\n\"I am not anxious about you--my people--my children,\" continued the\r\nking. \"You are prosperous and at peace. I leave you in good hands. The\r\nPrince Regent will be a fitter king for you than I.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" rose the universal shout--and those who had sometimes\r\nfound fault with him shouted louder than anybody. But he seemed as if\r\nhe heard them not.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said he, as soon as the tumult had a little subsided; and\r\nhis voice sounded firm and clear; and some very old people, who boasted\r\nof having seen him as a child, declared that his face took a sudden\r\nchange, and grew as young and sweet as that of the little Prince Dolor.\r\n\"Yes, I must go. It is time for me to go. Remember me sometimes, my\r\npeople, for I have loved you well. And I am going a long way, and I do\r\nnot think I shall come back any more.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a little bundle out of his breast pocket--a bundle that nobody\r\nhad ever seen before. It was small and shabby-looking, and tied up\r\nwith many knots, which untied themselves in an instant. With a joyful\r\ncountenance, he muttered over it a few half-intelligible words. Then,\r\nso suddenly that even those nearest to his Majesty could not tell\r\nhow it came about, the King was away--away--floating right up in the\r\nair--upon something, they knew not what, except that it appeared to be\r\nas safe and pleasant as the wings of a bird.\r\n\r\nAnd after him sprang a bird--a dear little lark, rising from whence\r\nno one could say, since larks do not usually build their nests in the\r\npavement of city squares. But there it was, a real lark, singing far\r\nover their heads, louder and clearer, and more joyful, as it vanished\r\nfurther into the blue sky.\r\n\r\nShading their eyes, and straining their ears, the astonished people\r\nstood, until the whole vision disappeared like a speck in the\r\nclouds--the rosy clouds that overhung the Beautiful Mountains.\r\n\r\nThen they guessed that they should see their beloved king no more.\r\nWell-beloved as he was, he had always been somewhat of a mystery to\r\nthem, and such he remained. But they went home, and, accepting their\r\nnew monarch, obeyed him faithfully for his cousin's sake.\r\n\r\nKing Dolor was never again beheld or heard of in his own country. But\r\nthe good he had done there lasted for years and years; he was long\r\nmissed and deeply mourned--at least, so far as anybody could mourn one\r\nwho was gone on such a happy journey.\r\n\r\nWhither he went, or who went with him, it is impossible to say. But I\r\nmyself believe that his godmother took him, on his travelling-cloak, to\r\nthe Beautiful Mountains. What he did there, or where he is now, who can\r\ntell? I cannot. But one thing I am quite sure of, that, wherever he is,\r\nhe is perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when I think of him, am I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STORY OF THE AUTHOR'S LIFE]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this little book, Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, was a woman\r\nas modest, sweet, and wholesome as the story itself. She lived in\r\nEngland, but her writings endeared her to people all over the world.\r\nSome American ladies who went to call upon her in her home, Wildwood\r\nCottage, in Hampstead, near London, describe her as wearing a black\r\nsilk gown with a plain linen collar, her brown hair drawn smoothly back\r\nfrom an open brow, and her face, gracious and winning to an unusual\r\ndegree, bearing the look of one who had tasted of sorrow. This was when\r\nshe was already a well-known writer, having won her place in literature\r\nby hard and faithful work; but probably she did not dream, even then,\r\nthat she would come to be recognized as, next to Dickens, the most\r\nwidely-read novelist of her time.\r\n\r\nShe was born April 20, 1826, at Stoke-upon-Trent, one of the chief\r\nmanufacturing towns of Staffordshire, England. Staffordshire is the\r\ncentral county of England, and has many curious and interesting\r\nfeatures. It forms the sloping base of a long chain of hills, where in\r\ncountless ages the sea, sometimes covering the land and again driven\r\naway from it by the upheaval of a great body of earth and stone, has\r\nworn down the grit and limestone rock into clay. Did you know that all\r\nclay was mud made by the washing away of rocks? Just think how many\r\nhundreds of years it took to make the little ball of clay you model\r\nwith!\r\n\r\nWell, the people who lived in this country found out, eighteen hundred\r\nyears ago, that they could mould their clay into pots and basins, even\r\nif they could not make things grow in it; so they dug up the clay,\r\nshaped it with their hands, and baked it in the sun, making jars,\r\nbowls, and other useful things which they sold to farmers in exchange\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nAbout that time there came marching over the thickly wooded land,\r\ncompanies of Roman soldiers, who took all the clay bowls they wanted\r\nfor their own use, and showed the potters how to make better ones.\r\nThey also compelled them to make floors, roofs, and wall ornaments of\r\nclay baked in very hot ovens, called kilns. Much of this old Roman\r\npottery was, of course, broken and lost, but still, if you should ever\r\ngo there, you would find pieces of it in the banks of the little rivers\r\nand brooks near the clay pits, pieces more than a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nBecause it is so full of clay--dark blue clay, and red and yellow\r\nochres, used for coloring and painting, as well as red and black\r\nchalk--the country seems to have been made for potteries. Besides this,\r\nthere used always to be plenty of wood to keep the kilns hot, for a\r\ngreat forest covered nearly all the land. This was a continuation\r\nof the Forest of Arden, about which you will read some day, as well\r\nas about Sherwood Forest, which sheltered Robin Hood and his merry\r\nmen.--Have you heard about them yet?--Later, when better fuel was\r\nneeded, two great coal fields were discovered underlying the county,\r\none of them twenty miles long by two broad. Here, then, where all was\r\nso perfectly prepared for his work, it was natural that the greatest\r\npotter of modern times, and one of the greatest of all times, should be\r\nborn--Josiah Wedgwood, who lived for many years in the very town where\r\nMrs. Craik was born. He not only loved to make dishes and jars of all\r\nkinds as perfect as possible, but while shut in with a long illness he\r\nstudied the chemistry and the arithmetic needed in his trade. In years\r\nof hard labor and close study he so mastered his trade that he made it\r\nboth a science and an art. He, more than any other, turned the county\r\ninto one of the busiest places in the world, where thousands of men\r\nwork from morning till night to supply the whole world with every sort\r\nof thing that can be made out of clay. Perhaps on the bottom of your\r\nplates at home you may find printed the words \"Staffordshire, England.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Wedgwood's time--in 1653, to be accurate--Stoke-upon-Trent was\r\na small group of thatched houses and two pot-works, gathered around\r\nthe ancient parish church. In 1762, thirty-two years after Wedgwood's\r\nbirth, it had a population of 8,000, of whom 7,000 were employed, in\r\none way or another, in the pottery trade. The whole country-side is\r\nnow black with smoke from the many factories. At one time, when the\r\npotters used salt to glaze their ware--that is, to put a bright polish\r\non it--they used to open up their huge ovens every Saturday morning,\r\nbetween the hours of eight and twelve, and cast in salt. It would then\r\nmelt, and run over the surface of the clay jugs and things inside, and\r\nleave a smooth, shining surface. If you let some salt and water, very\r\nstrong of salt, boil over an old crock of your mother's, when the fire\r\nis making the stove red-hot, you will see how it works. Indeed, it was\r\nthrough an accidental boiling-over of this sort that salt-glaze was\r\ndiscovered. On Saturdays, when the salt was cast into the kilns, it\r\nmade great clouds of smoke and vapor, filling streets and houses, and\r\nspreading far out into the country, so heavy that travelers to town\r\nlost their way, and persons in the street ran against each other.\r\n\r\nHere lived, and preached, and argued, and laid down the law, a\r\nbrilliant, enthusiastic Irishman, named Thomas Mulock, the father of\r\nthe woman who wrote this book. He was a minister, but one who did\r\nnot agree with any of the other ministers around him. He had a warm,\r\neager nature, and a temper to match, and as the second of twenty-two\r\nchildren must have exercised from his early childhood all that power\r\nof domineering which made Lord Byron nickname him \"Muley Mulock.\" By\r\nthis name he was known over half of Europe, but for all that he was\r\nmuch loved and admired, and moved in the same circle as Byron, Scott,\r\nSouthey, and Wordsworth. From him, Mrs. Craik undoubtedly inherited her\r\ngifts as a writer.\r\n\r\nHer mother was a daughter of Mr. Mellard, a tanner and a member of the\r\nReverend Thomas Mulock's congregation. She was one of three sisters\r\nwho used to talk with the young minister over the wall that separated\r\ntheir gardens. There is a legend that he went all in white to the\r\nwedding, his shoes being of white satin; but this is very likely only a\r\npicturesque bit of gossip, kept alive by the fact that Mr. Mulock was\r\nquite romantic enough and independent enough to have done such a thing\r\nif it had happened to strike his fancy. His wife was a frail little\r\nwoman, and the troubles which soon beset her husband on account of his\r\nstrong, new opinions, were hard for her to bear, as was also the way\r\nin which he, like a hot-blooded Irishman, sure that he was right and\r\nall the rest of the world wrong, marched straight into the thick of\r\nany theological fight that might be going on. Dinah, at last, although\r\nmerely an inexperienced girl, persuaded her mother to go with her to\r\nLondon, to seek a little peace and quiet, leaving the father to fight\r\nout his battles alone in the country place he found--or made--so full\r\nof strife.\r\n\r\nThis was a tremendous responsibility for a young girl with no means to\r\nspeak of and only an ordinarily good education, such as was given to\r\nyoung ladies in the girls' schools of those days. At school she seems\r\nto have been a great favorite, and is described as being always the\r\ncenter of a bevy of girls, who hung round her lovingly, and for whom\r\nshe prophesied the most wonderful things. She was always sure they had\r\ngreat abilities, but seemed to be quite unconscious that she herself\r\nwas the most gifted of them all, and would be remembered when they were\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nEven after she came to London, she made friends among other girls, and\r\nin spite of her unceasing and exacting work, seems always to have had\r\ntime to enjoy them and make them enjoy her. She was only twenty years\r\nold when, in 1846, she went to London, and undertook the main support\r\nof her mother and the two young brothers who soon joined them. She did\r\neverything her pen could find to do, writing stories for fashion books\r\nand other periodicals, and had the satisfaction, finally, of knowing\r\nthat she had succeeded in caring for her aged mother to the end of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOf the two brothers, the elder, Thomas, Jr., true son of his father,\r\ntook part in some act of rebellion while studying at the\r\nRoyal Academy. His father sided with the principals of the school\r\nand approved of the son's being expelled, his own heart aching, most\r\nprobably, while he did what he thought was his duty. The son's heart,\r\nin turn, was sore at what he must have thought unloving conduct on the\r\nfather's part. At any rate, he decided soon after to go to Australia,\r\nand, as he was about to board the ship, fell off the quay and was\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThis was a heavy blow to the brave young sister, now left with only the\r\nyounger brother. He was a musician and a photographer of no mean rank\r\nat a time when few persons thought of photography as an art. Though he\r\nnever proved a support to her, always leaning on her motherly care and\r\ngetting himself into many scrapes from which she had to pull him out he\r\nwas nevertheless the joy of his sister's life.\r\n\r\nIn London Miss Mulock made friends whose assistance, later, was worth\r\na great deal to her. She had published, in 1849, her first novel,\r\n_The Ogilvies_, which brought her recognition, and made men and women\r\nof real power in the world of letters seek her out. When they knew\r\nher personally, her simple cordiality, friendliness, and, above all,\r\nher thorough goodness of heart, made them her warm friends. When she\r\nfound herself able to take a cottage--the \"Wildwood Cottage\" already\r\nspoken of--she quickly gathered around her some of the brightest and\r\nbest people in the great city. From that time on, her books came out\r\nsteadily and in great numbers. In all, she wrote forty-six works,\r\nincluding many novels, some essays, and two or three volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of her novels is _John Halifax, Gentleman_, considered\r\nby many the best story of English middle-class life ever written. This\r\nnovel was translated into French, German, Italian, Greek, and Russian,\r\nand is still one of the most frequently called for books in the public\r\nlibraries. Her poems, _Douglas, Douglas, Tender and True_, and _Philip\r\nMy King_, are known wherever English is spoken.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting story connected with the latter poem. Philip\r\nBourke Marston, the boy to whom it refers, was the son of one of Miss\r\nMulock's London friends, Westland Marston, a famous dramatic poet and\r\ncritic. When his little son was born, August 13, 1850, he asked Miss\r\nMulock to be Philip's godmother, and traces of her deep affection for\r\nthe gifted child are to be found among her writings. _A Hero_ was\r\nwritten for him, and it is to him, evidently, that the lovely little\r\npoem, _A Child's Smile_, refers. The boy lost his sight when only three\r\nyears old. The cause is said to have been too much belladonna, given to\r\nprevent scarlet fever. For many years enough sight remained to enable\r\nhim, in his own words, to see \"the three boughs waving in the wind,\r\nthe pageant of sunset in the west, and the glimmer of a fire upon the\r\nhearth.\" Shut in thus to the inner world of thought and feeling, Philip\r\nindulged in an imaginative series of wonderful adventures, and in long\r\ndaydreams excited by music. Perhaps his blindness, coupled with his\r\nvivid imagination, is the reason why the beautiful poems he wrote when\r\nhe grew older show such a wonderfully vivid power of portraying nature.\r\nWhen he saw a tree-bough waving in the wind, he saw it only dimly with\r\nhis outward eyes, but as he sat dreaming over it afterward, it became\r\nmore real to him than any bough was likely to become to an everyday,\r\nhearty boy who saw so many trees, with so many branches, that he hardly\r\nnoticed them at all. It must have been a great comfort to him to have\r\nsuch a godmother as Miss Mulock--a real fairy godmother, who could\r\nweave magic spells of the most interesting stories, and heal the aches\r\nof his poor heart by sweet little poems.\r\n\r\nIt was at Wildwood Cottage that Miss Mulock formed that close\r\nacquaintance with George Lillie Craik that finally led to her marriage\r\nwith him. Mr. Craik met with a serious railroad accident near her\r\nhouse, which she promptly gave up to him, she staying with a friend\r\nnear by; in the long days of convalescence they learned to know each\r\nother thoroughly. The marriage was singularly happy. Mr. Craik was a\r\nman of letters as well as a publisher, and they had every taste in\r\ncommon. Their life together was beautiful and full of a deep peace.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had no children of their own, they had an adopted\r\ndaughter, Dorothy, and she it is for whom _The Adventures of a Brownie_\r\nwas written. It is probably because of Mrs. Craik's devotion and love\r\nfor her that the little book is so free from self-consciousness, so\r\nevidently written wholeheartedly \"as told to my child.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Craik's death, which took place in 1887, was, like her life, full\r\nof self-sacrificing affection and obedience to duty. She had not been\r\nill, beyond a few attacks of heart-trouble that no one considered\r\nserious. By some blessed chance, on the morning of her last day on\r\nearth, her husband took an especially loving farewell of her--so much\r\nso that Dorothy laughed at him, and Mrs. Craik, smiling happily,\r\nreminded her that, although they had been so long married, they were\r\nlovers still. It was within a few weeks of Dorothy's marriage when the\r\nsudden heart failure came, and Mrs. Craik's one wish was that she might\r\nbe permitted to live four weeks longer, so that her death might not\r\novershadow her daughter's wedding. She resigned even this unselfish\r\nwish when she saw that it was not God's will.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of her character, it may be supposed, quite as much as any\r\npeculiar merit in her writings, led Queen Victoria, who always tried\r\nto reward uprightness of life as well as unusual skill in any art, to\r\nbestow upon Mrs. Craik the only mark of recognition in her power. This\r\nwas a small pension, and although she often was criticised for keeping\r\na sum of money she did not need, while many less fortunate writers\r\ndid need it, she retained it as her right, to use as her conscience\r\ndictated. She set it aside for struggling authors who would accept help\r\nfrom the queen's bounty that they would refuse from her private funds.\r\n\r\nOther writers may be more brilliant and more profound than Mrs. Craik,\r\nbut her tales of simple goodness bring, not only a sense of rest and\r\nrelief to the reader, but also a new desire to put goodness into his\r\nown daily life. In all her stories Mrs. Craik makes goodness as lovely\r\nas it really is. There are sad things in them, but the sadness is\r\nalways made sweet at last by courage and patience and kindliness.",
